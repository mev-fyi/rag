00:00:00.250 - 00:00:29.240, Speaker A: So let's start today's q A. Hi everyone, I'm Anna, marketing and business development executive at Nettermind, and together with William, our marketing and partnership intern, we will be hosting today's Q A. So welcome and big thanks for joining us today. Brian from Sorare is on our panel and let's set the stage to begin with a brief introduction. Could you, Brian, give us a short introduction, please?
00:00:29.770 - 00:01:12.740, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So I'm Brian Hagen. I'm growth lead at Silver. Silver is the fancy NFT game. We have built a fancy football game where you can basically use officially licensed NFTs of football players and so leverage them. And with these NFTs, compose a team, enjoy the live experience of fantasy and watching the game live and then based on your performance, win rewards every week. So it's a game where you can trade productive assets and earn money by playing this game.
00:01:12.740 - 00:01:38.460, Speaker B: That's basically it. It's a game built on Ethereum. And so we actually spoke at ETCC last Tuesday because we are actually scaling the game on layer two right now, namely Starcore and roll ups. And actually, I think we are working with you on that roll up. So. Yeah, glad to be here.
00:01:39.790 - 00:01:47.360, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. Okay. So would you mind, tell us a little bit, how did you get into that? How did you start?
00:01:49.410 - 00:03:01.506, Speaker B: Yeah, I started back in 2014, actually. That's really the first time I got interested in bitcoin. I listened to a podcast by Wenzis Casseris, who was talking about bitcoin as a store of value for Argentinians. And so that struck a chord for me because I knew Argentinians and Argentino a bit and I was studying economics then. And yeah, that's when I started looking at bitcoin a bit more and then bought my first piece of a bitcoin in 2015. And from there I kind of fell down the crypto rabbit hole with bitcoin and then with Ethereum and been working in the industry full time since beginning of 2017 and was working in a place in Paris called Lemisaunder bitcoin, which was the first bitcoin center in Europe and in France and subsequently became coinhouse. It was part of ledger and then I met all the kind of european crypto industry by organizing events.
00:03:01.506 - 00:03:48.360, Speaker B: And I met the sore founders very early in their journey and decided to join the team in January 2020. And since then it's been joining a rocket ship because it's been growing massively. And obviously nfts today is something that more and more people know about but back then it was still very obscure. And for me it was the first time that NFTs made sense by bringing utility layer to NFTs. And that layer is a game where you can really use these NFTs and have some interest based on your expertise and based on your knowledge of football or any other sport, maybe in the future.
00:03:49.370 - 00:03:57.430, Speaker C: So for people that aren't really well versed in what so rare does, for some reason I keep pronouncing it, Sarah.
00:03:58.330 - 00:03:59.590, Speaker B: That'S what I imagine.
00:04:03.050 - 00:04:16.030, Speaker C: What's the best? I would call it centralized finance, but gaming is not centralized finance. What's the Normie version of so rare?
00:04:16.930 - 00:04:20.938, Speaker B: What do you mean by the Normie version? Like NFT version?
00:04:21.114 - 00:04:29.940, Speaker C: Yeah, sort of like how Pokemon is the Normie version of Axie Infinity, although Axie Infinity is becoming pretty mainstream in and of itself. Yeah.
00:04:31.830 - 00:05:14.958, Speaker B: The Normie version would be for english people, that would be fancy Premier League. So there's about ten people playing fancy Premier League in England. For us based people, it would be sort of draftkings and fanduel. The difference lies in the details, though. Fancy sports is more than 300 million people are playing fancy sports in the world. It's a segment that is growing. And when it comes to fancy soccer, there's no real fancy soccer that talks to population, to everybody, because there's FPL in England, there's Dacauci in Italy, there's kickbase in Germany.
00:05:14.958 - 00:05:53.466, Speaker B: And so we are building a fantasy football game that speaks to all these different audiences, but that is based on these items that are digital trading cards. That's the first difference. Second difference is obviously these digital trading cards are nfts and then these digital trading cards, you'll enter them in competitions. And if you are good in the game, well, you can earn rewards that are both new cards but also ETH. And so that's very different to any other fancy game. But yeah, to keep it short, the normal version would be a mix of fancy Premier League and DraftKings, or Fanduel.
00:05:53.658 - 00:05:59.280, Speaker C: Then what about FIFA? I saw some comparisons being drawn to FIFA on your website where does.
00:06:00.290 - 00:07:05.806, Speaker B: Yeah, so, so FIFA is a video game in the sense that it's a console game and you take console and you play with a friend and that's about it. The similarity with FIFA is so Sora is different because it's a strategic game, right? So it's more about composing a team, managing a team, thinking about what are your next moves. FIFA is a bit more of an intuition live game where you play with your fingers, but there's less a strategic element in it. However, in FIFA they have an online game which is called FIFA Ultimate Team. And that's the similarity here, is that FIFA actually doesn't make money because they sell a game in October for â‚¬60. They make a bit of money off that, but they actually make a ton of money out of a different mode called FIFA Ultimate Team. That's the online mode, and with that mode you can collect what they call icons.
00:07:05.806 - 00:07:54.914, Speaker B: And these icons are items in the Ea or in the FIFA world. And with these icons you can compose a team and play that shared online mode and depending on the icon that you get, your team will be more or less good. These icons are sold through loot boxes or blind packs, just like NBA topshot. The issue here in Europe is that these loot boxes or blind packs are considered as gambling. So they are slowly going away from that because regulators are looking at the addictiveness of the game. And that's a big difference with server, is that we don't do any blind packs or loot boxes, which are arguably very exciting but also quite addictive. But the main difference is not about that.
00:07:54.914 - 00:08:40.034, Speaker B: It's obviously about the items. FIFA's items are Fifas and you cannot really truly trade them. You can trade them on their marketplace for their little credits, but you cannot leave the game. You cannot trade them for money, you cannot sell them on any other marketplace and you cannot use them in other games than FIFA with Sora cards because these are east assets. You can trade them on any other platform and you can use them in any other game. And as a matter of fact, we built one game which is our fancy football game. But there's seven other games built on top of Sora cards, including a game built by Ubisoft, the video game studio that builds like AAA games such as Assassin's Creed and stuff like this.
00:08:40.034 - 00:09:07.910, Speaker B: So they've actually built a game on top of silver cards just to kind of experiment how you can do that. Start experimenting with gaming assets that are not game native, but game native, but just assets native and see what would be the results. And I think they've been very happy about that. And they're going to continue explore blockchain games with this idea of having assets that can go between games.
00:09:08.070 - 00:09:38.840, Speaker C: Yeah, that's pretty cool. And you mentioned that whole idea of being addictive. And I think that really strikes a tone with me because the way it is right now with the current gaming industry, it's always trying to get you hooked on the game. How do we increase engagement so that these people get addicted and they watch more ads. The whole play to earn gaming model, really. And this whole micro payments thing, it allows for a greater alignment of incentives. Right.
00:09:38.840 - 00:10:01.340, Speaker C: Instead of having to become addicted to it, you can actually play and actually you can still have a good time without having to be really addicted to it. It's not all about getting the most amount of time for each user on the app, whatever is fine with them.
00:10:01.810 - 00:10:38.600, Speaker B: Yeah. It changes the relationship between the game studio and the gamer, because the gamer is now actually part of the game and he actually owns part of the game. So it's not as if he's just consuming something the game created, he's actually owning what the game is creating. And so with that, he's actually co creating by being able to build new experiences on top. And so I think that's very different than the kind of EA model or traditional gaming model these days.
00:10:38.970 - 00:10:56.734, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a good point to jump off of. Like you mentioned how it's sort of like an ownership economy, especially with gaming. But I think gaming is a lot more different. Right. With Uniswap, you can just let uniswap run for 100 years and granted there are no security vulnerabilities, it'll be fine. Right. But gaming is a lot more different.
00:10:56.734 - 00:11:10.530, Speaker C: Right. You want to add game features, you want to add hot fixes. Should gaming be more centralized versus other protocols? And how do you ensure that the Dow whole community gets control model works for gaming?
00:11:11.830 - 00:12:13.478, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's still in the early days, Axio Infinity did a great thing, is they kind of decentralized the control of the game and the future iteration of the game. I'm not versed enough to know exactly how they did that. I think there needs to be. When you build a game, it's hard to have a game, that game that's governed by a community, because game design and being a game economist is such a hard job and a new job in itself that I'm not sure the power of the community can actually do that. But I think what's really exciting in gaming and the forefront of this innovation is the items. Being able to own the items in itself is a real revolution. I think being able to design the game as a community is something different and it's something that we haven't truly unlocked yet.
00:12:13.478 - 00:13:22.698, Speaker B: Like all the axmpt today, for instance, they have a governance token. But I don't know if with that governance token you can take decisions on how the game is going to be built in the future. I think it's still the game studio that takes these decisions. Right. And so for surreal, basically the assets are completely decentralized in the sense that the gamers truly own them and they can do whatever they want with them and they can trade them wherever they want and use them wherever they want. However, the actual fancy game in itself is centralized because it didn't really make sense for us to decentralize these decisions in the sense that it was really complicated and bringing a layer of complexity that we wouldn't be truly able to manage. And to be honest, the thesis and the ambition is to bring mainstream football fans to crypto without really having them noticing what crypto, or needing to understand what crypto is, but really building a product that tells the crypto story for you, where you understand the benefits of crypto.
00:13:22.698 - 00:13:40.910, Speaker B: And for that, what it means is through NFTs, you can truly own these assets, use them wherever you want, and just making sure they understand the superpowers that gaming items based on blockchain can bring them versus traditional gaming items.
00:13:41.070 - 00:14:19.390, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true. That's really true. I guess being a Dow can be interesting, but when you just want to play the damn game, you don't really want to care about what the governance does and et cetera, et cetera. It's just too much complexity to add to the gaming experience. So I totally agree, especially maybe for gaming. You're right that it is probably better to offload some of the more complicated tasks to the game studio. Okay, let's say I want to put in my notice for Nethermind tomorrow, and I want to jump into so rare for full time as a gamer.
00:14:19.390 - 00:14:21.680, Speaker C: How much would I make?
00:14:23.430 - 00:14:58.940, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. It depends on your level of involvement, and it depends on if you work on it, like day in, day out. And if you have a bit of capital to start with, it'll be different than if you play 1 hour or two per day. So someone who's playing division four, for instance, twice per week, you can earn very easily 0.2 e. So that would be 0.4 e per week.
00:14:58.940 - 00:15:45.946, Speaker B: But then the value isn't really the ETH, it's actually the card. So if you in the top ten, you'll win like a really cool card that will be valued between 0.1 e to 0.3 E. If you're in the top three, you can win a card that's valued three, four, five ETH. So some users are making or earning somewhere around probably like 20 to year per week, maybe more if they get also lucky other users. And the average user, I'd say, is earning between like one hundred dollars to two hundred dollars per week by playing the game in a very, relatively not cost intensive way.
00:15:45.946 - 00:16:02.458, Speaker B: And that's it. At the end of the day, you can play and earn, but the idea is to make a game that's really fun. And so the earning part is a bonus, but it's not necessarily the end goal.
00:16:02.634 - 00:16:19.986, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a really strong point. When I look at Axio Infinity and I see people grinding for 910 hours a day, I'm thinking, is that really fun? At one point, does it stop becoming a game and just becoming something like cookie clicker?
00:16:20.178 - 00:17:09.478, Speaker B: Well, the question, that's the thing, the interesting question is, and that we've asked our users already, is why do you play the game? Is it to make money or is it because it's fun? And so I think the first answer you get is to make money. It's the day where you actually stop being a game and you are something different. You do a hybrid between a financial app and a game or something else, but a game is not about necessarily making money, but it's mostly. And that should be the number one metric to optimize for, is to have fun and so on. So people hang out on Soar's discord or on sober because they love football. Because they love hanging out with other people that love football. They love talking about it.
00:17:09.478 - 00:17:27.180, Speaker B: And I think earning, some people obviously, kind of are full time tour and making money. But it's not the end goal for us. For us, it's really building a game that's fun. And if you want to reach mainstream audience all around the world, it should be about fun and not necessarily about making money.
00:17:27.550 - 00:17:29.914, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true. That's true. Yeah.
00:17:29.952 - 00:17:39.550, Speaker A: When we're in the topic of actually community, today is the last day of IPSCC. So could you tell us a little bit more about your presentation on IPSCC?
00:17:40.770 - 00:18:41.918, Speaker B: Yeah, for, you know, we did a presentation on Tuesday. It was a presentation about basically, like, giving a rundown about what sovereign was, why we started, where we're going, but then mostly about the technical aspect. And technical aspect is something that's interesting, because when we started sober in 2019, we built sober on the layer two called Loom. At the time, Loom was the first layer two in production on Ethereum, and their thesis was doing a layer two for game apps. So actually axe and PNT was also a loom, just like us. And what we did is we were there until February 2020. And that's when they told us, listen, Loom is changing direction and we want to now cater for business blockchain apps.
00:18:41.918 - 00:19:46.530, Speaker B: And so you'll have to find another home, another infrastructure. We decided that we had to migrate somewhere else. Back in February 2020, you didn't really have that many options in terms of layer twos. Everything was still very experimental, nothing was in production. We talked to a few different blockchains, to a few different layer two solutions, and we decided that the safest option was just to go back and to go on Ethereum on the main chain. So it wasn't the best of timing, because when we arrived on the main chain on Ethereum, that's when DFI Summer 2020 started. So gas fees were super high and actually on soar, what we always did and what we still do is we sponsor the Ethereum fees for our users, because we consider that as a user, as a gamer, you shouldn't be thinking about transaction fees, gas fees, and that complexity should be in the background and it should be managed by the actual game publisher.
00:19:46.530 - 00:20:28.870, Speaker B: So that's what we did. And quickly enough during D five summer 2020, we realized that, listen, Ethereum is never going to be a long term sustainable solution. But we really knew that. And so we started looking for the best long term solution for scaling. And so we discussed with all the layer ones again. We looked at all the different layer twos and all the different optimistic rollups, zk roll ups solutions, and we ended up with choosing Starquare as our scaling solution. And Starkware is building stark technology on top of Ethereum.
00:20:28.870 - 00:21:13.134, Speaker B: And these roll ups are quite interesting for NFT projects because for zika rollups, you don't need to be EVM compatible. Today. They don't support EVM compatible smart contracts. When you are doing NFT on Ethereum, you usually have contracts that are pretty easy to understand, easy to use. It's like a bank transfer, it's like a payment mechanism to transfer assets and issue assets. And so we were able to go and DT roll ups with Starquare and we've migrated there. We are currently migrating on Starcore as we speak since yesterday.
00:21:13.134 - 00:21:39.100, Speaker B: And I think it'll be live, fully live tonight or tomorrow morning. So that's a very exciting part of a very exciting milestone for us because it will allow a much better gaming experience in Sora for our users. There won't be any delays, everything will be instantaneous and it will really help us drive the next wave of adoption of the game for the next few weeks and months.
00:21:40.050 - 00:22:40.110, Speaker C: Yeah, that's really cool. And I love how you guys are actively thinking about the UX, especially by sort of sponsoring those gas costs. And I think another thing that I'm also thinking about when it comes to that is when you guys are talking with partners like licensing IP, how do you explain it to how open to them are they? The idea that you can use maybe your trading cards for something else, like, let's say I want to bring Ronaldo to my metaverse world and maybe he can jump around and play with the cryptokitties. Right. How do you explain to them that it's not really restrictive in terms of IP and that it's super duper?
00:22:42.450 - 00:23:41.090, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's an interesting question. I think the IP is very controlled in the sense that the Ronaldo card will never change once it's issued. It's mutable. And so that IP in itself, in the solar world is very authenticated and mutable. But then actually bringing that card somewhere else is a great feature that for some of them they know, for others they don't. And we try and educate them, but we're not always into that kind of discussion about how far these assets can go in terms of interoperability with other games. But basically, I think as long as these cards are in an ecosystem or doesn't have to do with anything with porn or arms or anything like that, it's absolutely fine.
00:23:41.090 - 00:23:52.950, Speaker B: So we are very mindful of that ourselves because it's also the reputation of sort of cards in general. But at the end of the day, you can do whatever you want with these cards.
00:23:53.370 - 00:24:17.920, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think moving on to in terms of people who are getting on IP, how excited have IP holders been? Are you guys getting emails all day about, hey, can I get my card? Or is it like you have to approach them, you have to explain them, and it takes quite a bit of time to tell them, but after you explain to them, they get it and they want it.
00:24:20.770 - 00:25:45.980, Speaker B: They've been very excited about the opportunity here at play. We do have some miniban requests from football clubs and other sports asking about creating sort of cards for their players. So that's been very exciting. I do think that they've been looking at this space a lot more since the hype around NFTs and trying to understand what is the business opportunity for the leagues, for the clubs at play, and trying to understand the category a bit more, the NFT category and seeing who are different players. So for us, it's been a lot of education before, especially in 2019 when we started a lot of convincing to make them understand that there was a lot of great opportunities around NFT licensing in terms of revenue stream, but also exposure as a brand to new audiences of gamers, of crypto enthusiasts and guys like that. And now it's been easier in 2020 because we had enough IP to be very credible. Once you've onboarded clubs like Real Madrid, Liverpool, PSG, Juventus, you start gaining that credibility and the domino effect starts playing, say.
00:25:45.980 - 00:26:20.390, Speaker B: But then when you look at the bigger leagues and the bigger clubs, these discussions take time and they are generally very excited. So I do think that all the bigger leagues and clubs in the sport world in the next two, three years will be on NFTs and will be on some form or another NFT provider. And our ambition here at silver is to onboard all the top 20 leagues in the world, onboard the top 50 football associations in the world, and potentially one day onboard other sports.
00:26:21.130 - 00:26:34.986, Speaker C: Yeah. And speaking of other sports, what does the criteria look like? Will I be able to match up LeBron with my Liverpool lineup or something like that? And then we can see how well LeBron does a penalty kick or something like that.
00:26:35.168 - 00:27:22.970, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's not how a fancy works, unfortunately, except if LeBron one day starts playing football, but it'll be hard to have a fancy experience where you can bridge different sports together. Maybe one day we'll come around that, but it's not a priority to be. But no, in terms of different sports, we do have a model that is a unique model in this space, building a fancy game around NFTs. There's no real other company that's doing that today. So the category is very clear. And then other sports or sports IP are very excited about that. Because when you think about NFTs, there's been a massive surge of interest in NFTs, around art, around collectibles.
00:27:22.970 - 00:28:11.526, Speaker B: But what we've realized is that if you don't give them any utility, at some point it could look a bit like a fad. And you need this layer of utility to have long term and reputable retention for a specific company or business. And that's what we do. Players are coming back every week to play because it's fun and because these are productive assets and you can make money. So I think for a league or a sports organization, it's very interesting to see that and to see that people will be interacting with your brand, with your club, with your players every week, and some extent buying more, selling more, collecting more, trading more, meaning that potentially making more money for that IP. Yeah.
00:28:11.548 - 00:28:33.200, Speaker C: You mentioned that you want to onboard various different other clubs. Let's say I wanted to join an area club and the club just happened to have an agreement with so rare. Would that mean I'm able to play with Messi and Ronaldo and then I can have a dream team and then me tacked onto the side? I mean, I'm part of the dream as well. But would that be possible?
00:28:35.090 - 00:28:38.910, Speaker B: I'm not sure. So can you repeat your question? I'm not sure. I feel you understood.
00:28:39.070 - 00:28:53.350, Speaker C: I don't know. Like I joined an area football club and that area football club happens to have an agreement with Soraya to turn each player into NFTs. Would I be able to create a team that has like Ronaldo, Messi and then me for the dream?
00:28:59.050 - 00:29:53.420, Speaker B: A if you're a football player and you're joining a club that's under license in a sower, is that what you're. I mean, if I'm a football player and I join a club like a jaily club, Siriuso Osaka is a club in Japan and I join them as a professional player, well, then automatically what we can do at Silver is create a card of that player and start selling NFTs with that player. And so as server user and manager, I can buy cards of that player. And if I do own a Messi and a Ronaldo card in silver, well then I can actually play these different players together. So I'll be able to play Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and, you know, the new player at Osaka in my team at the same time. And so you'll be sitting beside them and you'd be looking good?
00:29:54.030 - 00:30:18.900, Speaker C: Yeah, I always look good, but I'll look especially good next to them. So I think something that's really interesting is that doing that whole gaming aspect and building games on top. Is there any discussions or plans of implementing some FIFA like thing where you actually play games with those players and have them boot the ball around?
00:30:20.710 - 00:31:06.100, Speaker B: Is that something that we want to do? Yeah, definitely. Is that something that we will do? Yeah, for sure. When will we start doing that? Unfortunately, it's been very hard to organize such things in the past few months because of COVID But this year is going to be different. So we do want to organize. Money can't buy experiences for our community with rule players in stadiums, in training grounds. And these are things that and opportunities that are opening up with within clubs and leagues based on the fact that just COVID is ending and there's less restrictions around what they can do in the stadium, in the training grounds, and players themselves, too.
00:31:07.030 - 00:31:33.500, Speaker C: Yeah, that sounds really cool, and I think I'd be really interested in doing something like that. And I think you have a really cool platform with, you have each person owning cards of other players. Is there a possibility of maybe turning so rare into a platform where you can buy equity in certain players as well, on top of the cards that you own.
00:31:35.710 - 00:31:39.100, Speaker B: By equity of certain players? What do you mean by.
00:31:39.870 - 00:32:00.820, Speaker C: I mean, I think in the NBA you had some players that turned their future earnings into equity, maybe. Would it be possible to have some kind of equity component to owning the cards where you own that card? And as their stardom grows, you can also own some of a cut of their earnings as well.
00:32:02.950 - 00:33:06.642, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's an interesting idea. I think you could have a card that represents a claim to future earnings of the company. To be honest, that's something that we haven't explored yet. We are very close to many footballers, JR, PK, Anton Grie's man, and other tier one footballers that have invested in the company, but we don't yet have footballers that are so deep into the NFT space that have actually started thinking about doing things like that and ourselves. It's a great idea. I've never thought of it, but again, I haven't thought of it because we're actually deeper into the gaming space and trying to build a really fun game for the future rather than kind of financialize it a lot. So the financialization of the game is pretty clear with the fact that these are assets that you can trade, that these are assets that are productive because with the game you can earn rewards.
00:33:06.642 - 00:33:13.034, Speaker B: However, we're not really after defying it as much as possible, but rather making a fun game.
00:33:13.152 - 00:33:15.194, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, this is my DJ inside coming out.
00:33:15.232 - 00:33:16.300, Speaker B: But yeah.
00:33:18.110 - 00:33:30.720, Speaker C: I guess looking at more of the fun aspect, have you guys considered turning into. You can join this person's fan club if you own a certain amount of their cards. Has there been interest in developing that out.
00:33:33.570 - 00:34:24.558, Speaker B: With the players, you mean, for instance? Yeah, it is an interesting idea. I think we would need to have players more involved within the space itself, a bit like the previous point. What is a person's fan club as an athlete, when do you become part of his fan club? If we take the example of Neymar, he's got, or Ronaldo, he's the player with the highest number of followers in the world on Instagram, maybe on Twitter, too. And so, actually, I'm pretty sure Elon Musk has more followers than Ronaldo. On Twitter, but on, you know, let's say someone. We have users that own Cristiano Ronaldo cards. We have users that own multiple Ronaldo cards.
00:34:24.558 - 00:34:28.834, Speaker B: How would you set this up yourself? Actually, since you're asking the questions, the.
00:34:28.872 - 00:34:46.486, Speaker C: Question, I don't know, you own these cards, and then maybe you can get better pricing on certain games at the club, or you can have the pricing to a meetup, or you can.
00:34:46.588 - 00:35:40.520, Speaker B: Yeah, I think with the athlete, you need a direct relationship with them to organize such a thing. And it's possible with the club, it's different because we have the relationships. And so these are things that we are exploring. If you own, let's say, more than ten cards of a certain club, that gives you an access for certain discount for tickets. If you own the card of a player and you actually play it in that fancy game, in that fancy tournament that weekend, and you are actually in the stadium, and the player that you own, that is playing in your team, but that is also playing on the pitch, scores during the game where you are physically in the stadium, well, then that could unlock an experience at the stadium because you're there. This is also something that's totally do.
00:35:42.750 - 00:35:50.540, Speaker C: All right. Okay. I've reinvited Brian. Oh, my goodness. Cut him through. Midway through.
00:35:52.370 - 00:35:54.960, Speaker A: The same sentence, like, over and over again.
00:35:55.890 - 00:36:23.222, Speaker C: Yeah. For those uninitiated, we had the same error yesterday, and it was just. Yeah, it was a really solid discussion, and I think everyone, a lot of people enjoyed it quite a bit. Yes. In any case, we'll end today's discussion right here. Thanks, everyone, for coming, especially if you were on the first before the session, and we'll end it right here. Thank you.
00:36:23.222 - 00:36:24.834, Speaker C: And. All right, bye bye.
00:36:24.962 - 00:36:27.250, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks, guys. Thanks so much. Bye.
