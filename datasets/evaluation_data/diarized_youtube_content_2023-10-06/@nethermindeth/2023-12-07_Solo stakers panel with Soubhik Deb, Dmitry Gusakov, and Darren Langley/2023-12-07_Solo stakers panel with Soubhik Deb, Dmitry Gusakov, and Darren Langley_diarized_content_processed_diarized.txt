00:00:02.650 - 00:00:21.760, Speaker A: Hello guys, let me very briefly introduce our guests today. So we have Dimitri from Lido. We have Shubik from Eigen Layer, and we have Darren from Rocket. Guys, could you tell us a bit more about yourself and about the projects you are in?
00:00:22.770 - 00:00:54.640, Speaker B: Thank you. So my name is Dimitri and I'm a Lido contributor working on community staking project. The main goal of community staking project is to allow variety of ways for community stakers, being individuals or groups, to join Lido in a permission or permissionless way, whatever they like, with as many options as possible, including traditional solo or DVT or any other new initiatives that will appear in the nearest future.
00:00:55.970 - 00:01:11.650, Speaker C: Hi, I'm Shabik. I'm head of protocol research at Eigen Layer. And Eigen layer is a restaking platform that enables any distributed system to inherit security from Ethereum's trust layer beyond the Ethereum's consensus protocol.
00:01:13.430 - 00:01:38.060, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Darren, I'm from rocket pool. So rocket pool is the second largest liquid staker now. We're a decentralized liquid staking protocol. So we have over 3000 individual node operators in about 133 different geographic locations running our kind of validated. We also have a liquid staking token called re.
00:01:42.130 - 00:01:48.590, Speaker A: Thanks. So my first question is, how do you define solo stakers?
00:01:50.130 - 00:02:15.560, Speaker B: Okay, so from my personal perspective, as I see it, solo stakers is people running nodes individually, being independent economically, I wouldn't say economically motivated, I would say ideologically motivated to make Ethereum better and more decentralized. That's my thing.
00:02:17.930 - 00:02:59.750, Speaker C: From my perspective, I would consider staking modalities to be like can be dissected into two parts. One where the staker is running its own operations of running the validator nodes, and another is where the staker is not running its own operations and get delegated to someone else to run that operation for that staker. Now within the first category, where the staker is running its own operation, it solves the principal agent problem in the first place. And within this first category, if you have put small amount of stake, then I'd call it solid staker, which is the 32 E. But if you have a lot of stake and you are running your own operations, then you would call it institutional staker. So that would be my definition.
00:03:02.250 - 00:03:31.518, Speaker D: I would class it as like a non commercial service staker. Not necessarily. I'm motivated by economics though. I think that they are definitely economically motivated, but certainly non commercial. They're not selling their services to another party, they are actually running it for themselves. Generally. Generally they are staking their own E as well, running their own E.
00:03:31.518 - 00:03:35.070, Speaker D: So that's how I would kind of class it at the solo stake.
00:03:38.280 - 00:03:41.110, Speaker A: Do they need to stake the whole of 32 E?
00:03:42.780 - 00:04:29.320, Speaker B: From my perspective, not, because at the current state of Ethereum, they need 32 eve. And as Darren mentioned, he thinks that they can be economically motivated. But let's be honest, if you have 32 eve, you can easily stake it with any liquid staking protocol, with rocket pool, with, I know, even with Coinbase, and you will get returns approximately the same as just staking, as just running a node, but you don't need to run a node. So I do think that solo stakers not necessarily need to provide all the capital, and I think that the best case scenario here is that they can provide as less capital as really required for security, while the rest of the capital can be provided by delegators.
00:04:31.340 - 00:04:43.340, Speaker C: From my perspective, I'd say that go with Dimitri. What is saying that you put as much stake that solves the principal agent problem as much as possible and keeps the system safe?
00:04:45.680 - 00:05:28.824, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely agree. Proof of stake has to have something at stake. And so those agents that are put in a, I'd say a powerful position, because you're essentially God for twelve sentence when you propose a block. So the idea there is that you have to have something at stake. I think you also have to have something at stake, because you need to be kind of economically aligned. You need to be economically aligned with the delegated stake that you've been given, so that there's definitely like a protocol thing there. You need to have something on the line, and you have to be working with the same incentives as the people that you're serving.
00:05:28.824 - 00:05:30.700, Speaker D: In other words, delegate staking.
00:05:33.600 - 00:05:34.350, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:05:35.040 - 00:06:15.736, Speaker A: Last year, Lido commissioned a report on solo stakers. The report was provided by rated. According to rated report, only 6.5% of the stake is controlled by the solo stakers. And the definition for solo stakers that rated us was very similar to the definition you used. So they didn't require the whole stake to come from the validator, from the stake. So here's my next question.
00:06:15.736 - 00:06:18.620, Speaker A: Do we need solo stakers?
00:06:20.080 - 00:07:09.980, Speaker B: I think not only we, but Ethereum itself for sure needs solo stakers. Because again, the key feature and the key principle and definition of solo stakers is that it is independent actor. And the key principles of decentralization is that the decentralized system should be made out of independent actors. Because if you have like three or four players being either maybe independent, okay, but it's not enough for decentralization or if you have, let's say 100 players, but they really depend on each other, this is also not decentralization. So yeah, I think Ethereum do need solo stakers and according to the research, 6.5%. For me personally it is extremely low. And I do understand that there are some reasons for it, either.
00:07:09.980 - 00:07:24.620, Speaker B: Economical reasons, technical complexity, lack of education, and we all hear we can reduce these barriers, we can make it better. And that's why I'm personally working on communities taking ElidA.
00:07:25.940 - 00:07:53.400, Speaker C: I would answer this question by classifying the faults that there could be in. Faults here mean the attacks that could be there. On Ethereum, basically there is a safety fault and the liveness fault. The safety fault here is the state transition function being wrongly executed, or the double signing. For that you don't need solo staking. Basically it's observable to anyone. But for the liveness fault, like chain growth or like chain not growing or censorship being happening, you need solo staking.
00:07:53.400 - 00:08:30.390, Speaker C: That's why, for example, Ethereum has something called inactivity leak. If the chain is not growing, at least the solo stakers, if they are honest and they are substantially big, suppose there is not enough collusion happening, then they can still grow the chain and slash the people who are not growing the chain, who are not participating in proposing blocks to grow the chain. And the social consensus will coalesce into assuming, accepting that small poke where the inactivity leak has been happening as the canonical fork. So for that exactly this liveness false, you need so to stay.
00:08:32.120 - 00:09:32.440, Speaker D: So it really depends on what we want from Ethereum itself. So if we want Ethereum to be this kind of like global financial and non financial platform that helps coordinate massive human efforts and really make a big impact on the world, then it needs to be incredibly neutral, censorship resistant and highly robust and secure. And it can only really be those things with decentralization, decentralization, equal banks get those things. And so solo stakers are extremely important in that whole process. There's always going to be some sort of power law in terms of the amount of stake. But that long, long tail is really, really important. A long tail of validators, node operators that are running small amounts of nodes, small amounts of validators is really, really important because they bring all of those characteristics to Ethereum.
00:09:35.430 - 00:09:47.880, Speaker A: So if I understand correctly, guys, solo stakers are, if everything is new, then they are the guys who will remain there to keep the chain going.
00:09:48.890 - 00:09:49.640, Speaker D: Thanks.
00:09:50.490 - 00:10:55.002, Speaker A: Okay, let's talk a bit about barriers to entry. So maybe more like personalized questions. Lida is not well known know allowing solo stakers not yet to join, but I understand he will tell us more about the recent efforts. Shubi Eigen layer is sometimes maybe not accused, but maybe accused of creating bigger incentives for bigger players in cost of solar staking. If you could elaborate on that, on how to lift the barriers. And Darren, rocket pool is like OG for the solo staking. You started with requiring 16 if right from operators to join and you reduced this barrier.
00:10:55.002 - 00:11:07.070, Speaker A: So if you could tell us more about what kind of analysis allowed you to reduce security, maybe that's this bum.
00:11:11.510 - 00:11:36.730, Speaker B: We have three questions. My part is to tell you guys here about community staking initiative. Precisely. Community staking module. So with community staking module we do want to reduce barriers for solo stakers. And as I mentioned before, the main ones is economical barrier. You do need a lot of ETH to be a solo staker.
00:11:36.730 - 00:12:42.238, Speaker B: The second one being technical barrier. You do need to be technically advanced to run node software, validator software to keep it everything up and running with a decent quality. And the third barrier is general understanding of how this ecosystem works. Why do I even need to participate in crypto in ethereum ecosystem and why this impact is important. And we do want to reduce all of these three barriers, starting with economical principle, with economical barrier. At the moment with rocket pool, for example, you need eight ETH plus some lPL collateral to enter and very soon I heard it will be four E and that's great. And with Lido community staking module, we will try to move this barrier even lower, as low as it is possible to keep security on a distant level, yet make it more appealing with the hardware and technical part.
00:12:42.238 - 00:13:54.440, Speaker B: We do want to offer the best integrations so that validator setup will be available not only for skilled persons, not only for those who can deal with this console tools, but also for those who used to deal with their own computer just clicking or with their own smartphone, and everything else will be done for them. Yet they will still control the validator, but with simple ux. And the third point about education. We do have several initiatives within Lido, not only about community staking, but about crypto in general. We recently like not recently, but about a year ago, prepared a book for kids with this small introduction to crypto. And we will push this initiative further so that guys who do have enough capital and probably do have enough technical skills, but not aware of what crypto is and what Ethereum is and why it is important, will know about it and will be able to join. I think that's the key features that we are focusing on.
00:13:57.050 - 00:15:19.698, Speaker C: As for Il, in contrast to the assumptions that people have about the relationship between decentralization and Ilair, I say that Ilair instead helps in the growth of a pricing market for decentralization. Like what is the value of decentralization? So to give you an example, seeing that with eigenve there will be a growth of premium decentralization services, which many other services would want to have it. So why am I calling it premium? To understand that, I'll give an example of decentralization services like data availability. You cannot have a data availability solution without decentralization, decentralized sequencing, you need decentralization for that. Proof of location, you need decentralization for that threshold signature, you need decentralization for that. And all these four services that I just mentioned, they'll be very poor services that other services would want to have, other middlewares would want to use as a black box. Now this means that any operators, any solo stakers who opt into such decentralization services, they will get high significant rewards because these services have, these are like premium decentralization services and everyone will want to use it.
00:15:19.698 - 00:15:51.900, Speaker C: And the four examples that I gave about the data availability threshold signature, then the decentralized sequencing, and they are very lightweight if you design properly. For example, the idea that we are assuming that we are building is very lightweight. So because these are lightweight, so for any solo staker it would incur very little infrastructure cost. So it actually helps in boosting the solar staking narrative in the first place.
00:15:55.090 - 00:16:07.200, Speaker A: On the other hand, each AVs will have some limited number of potential operators, right? And this number is not very high, as I understand.
00:16:10.310 - 00:16:49.200, Speaker C: It'S not necessary. This is more of an intersubjective question. So suppose if an ABS, an ABS can determine how many operators it wants. If an ABS wants many operators, like for the decentralized ones, because you need as many operators as possible, you want to recruit as many operators as possible. Now we believe that this will give rise. I'm just purely speculating here, because the protocol is at the beginning stage, the ecosystem. So there might emerge like certain services, which are like task allocation services.
00:16:49.200 - 00:17:30.940, Speaker C: So if there are too many operators, there'll be too much task. So coordinating too many tasks is hard. So you can have a random sorting of tasks, like something like sharding, where certain group of operators are assigned to do this task for this Abs at that point in time. So it's like a task allocator. So what happens is that not every operator is doing tasks for every ABs at the same time, which reduces the management of the task. In this kind of emergent ABs, you can have scenarios where this abs can have as many operators as possible.
00:17:33.400 - 00:18:16.384, Speaker D: Okay, so in terms of lowering the barrier to entry for Simon stakers, particularly, the bond said, we reduced it from 16 to eight. That was kind of off the back of fantastic community members analysis on the threats. You might be sitting in the audience. Basically, we went through and analyzed what the effects are and really the risks to re. Okay, so a normal slashing risk, you have to cover normal slashing risk. But that's the thing that happens most often. Then there's a whole heap of tail risks with staking.
00:18:16.384 - 00:18:45.000, Speaker D: So staking is very low risk, but it's not risk free. There are definite risks with staking. Right. And the tail risks are very, very unlikely, but they can affect the stake. So we have to take those into consideration when we're designing the protocol, and particularly when we're choosing the bond. With 16 e, we were extremely conservative. With eight e, we are still quite conservative.
00:18:45.000 - 00:19:45.392, Speaker D: And so we can kind of, like, lower that just on those things. As you lower it, though, other issues kind of come about. So things like Mev stealing and this sort of thing, those are things that kind of crop up when you kind of lower the stake. When you also lower the stake, efficiency of the protocol itself becomes very, very important, because when you lower the bond, if it costs you a lot of money to interact with the protocol, you're essentially wiping out, like, half a year's staking rewards. So you have to kind of balance out the cost of using the protocol and the bond as well. So there's a lot of work that we've been doing to basically line up our kind of, like, product roadmap so that we get to that end goal of, we have everything in line, basically. It'll be a great product.
00:19:45.392 - 00:19:47.090, Speaker D: When we get to that point.
00:19:49.780 - 00:19:53.890, Speaker A: Maybe you could tell us more about MeV stealing when the bomb is.
00:19:55.940 - 00:20:25.948, Speaker D: Okay, Mev is very spiky. First of all, the amount of times that you propose a block is random. So it's like a normal distribution. You might get five blocks per year like that, but you could also be very unlucky and get zero. Or you can get super lucky and have ten. Right? And so everyone is on this normal distribution. And so even the times that you.
00:20:25.948 - 00:21:30.256, Speaker D: So that makes it that very random. Then you have mev. Now Mev, again, on average, you might get an MEV block of zero, two e, but then you could get one of 200 E, right? Now, that would be a lottery that we call a lottery block, where it's extremely unlikely, but they do happen. So the variance in that is very, very high. Now, you can have people who, nothing saves a protocol from a lorry, but you want to make sure that somebody can't consistently steal the MEB, because there's a mechanism where a node operator actually sets their fee recipient, which is the address that Mev goes to, but they can set that to what they want. And there's not really kind of a mechanism to enforce that's a particular address. So you have to have some sort of crypto economic incentive or penalty over the top that enforces that they do that.
00:21:30.256 - 00:22:07.630, Speaker D: So that's kind of like the main thing there. And so really you just have to make sure that somebody can't come in and consistently steal MeV. What it does is it lowers the Apr of your Lst. They're not necessarily stealing funds, although they're just taking more than they should, but they are lowering the APR of the NFT. And essentially, it's not fair for the NFT holders because that just wouldn't be a return that was able to so those sorts of things.
00:22:10.480 - 00:23:10.384, Speaker B: So I would like to share my thoughts on MEV stealing. That's a really challenging topic, and I do agree with most of the things Darren just said. What I want to add here is that from my perspective and how I see it, it is really impossible to protect protocol 100% from MEV stealing, especially from stealing huge blocks. But what can be done is you can create incentive for good behavior. So if you participate for a long time, let's say a year or so, and you have a bunch of validators running provider or rocket pool, no matter if you are doing well, if you've never been detected, if MeV stealing has never been detected for you, and you never committed it, then you get better and better and better conditions. So, for example, bond might be reduced or something like that. And in case of MeV stealing detection, all these benefits go away.
00:23:10.384 - 00:24:08.230, Speaker B: And that's the incentive. It creates a perspective for you that if you will do well, instead of trying to catch this lottery block and get your chance to lose all these benefits just for small amount of ease, you would rather prefer to act correctly. That's one thing. And the second thing that can be done here, and that would be done in CSM, is that Bond will be associated with a not operator but not individual validator. It helps a lot in cases of, again, not like extremely huge MeV stealing, because it's almost impossible to cover 200 stolen as MeV, but it will make it even less attractive for validators to play this game. And if they have, let's say ten E or even 16 e for many validators at stake, it wouldn't be interesting for them to even try to participate in this game. That's my thought.
00:24:09.800 - 00:24:19.000, Speaker A: Thanks. Could you tell us how big bond the operators need to put in the lido community sticking module?
00:24:19.660 - 00:25:40.156, Speaker B: That's a question that I get frequently asked since we are from six to nine months away from official mainnet launch from proposing module to the main net launch, and the module design itself is agnostic to the actual size of the bond, we are not committing to any values at the moment. The only thing that I can say right now is numbers from the research published about a half a year ago by Lido contributors where the conclusion was that four E is sufficient enough to cover most of realistic case scenarios, including MeV stealing like most cases, and two E is probably sufficient to cover direct losses like slashing and all. It's important to note here that this research was done in two assumptions. The first one being that triggerable exits will go live at least within a year from the main net release. That's important consideration. And the second one that the portion of lid of safe allocated to community staking module is like from 1% to 2%. So it's very conservative research and before Mainet launch I think within maybe six months another research will be conducted more precise so that the actual value can be proposed to the Dow.
00:25:40.156 - 00:25:46.644, Speaker B: But I do think that it wouldn't exceed four E for sure and would probably be somewhere between four E and.
00:25:46.682 - 00:25:48.470, Speaker D: Two e as a starting value.
00:25:49.880 - 00:25:59.210, Speaker A: Thanks. Do you know how much of lido stakes can go to the community staking noodle? Is it this one to two?
00:25:59.980 - 00:26:54.170, Speaker B: At the starting point it will be 1% and it is described in the proposal. It is due to give a chance to battle test a module and after that it can be gradually raised. From my personal perspective, it shouldn't be raised more than 10% and there are some reasons for it, with one being that it is not the only staking module. And I think that within two years we will see from three or even from four to six staking modules within Lido, each one having like from ten to 20%. And community staking module wouldn't be the only way to enter lido permissionlessly. There is also dvt modules on the way for sure. It will take a bit longer for them to be developed, but I do think that once they will go live and once they will become permissionless, maybe it would start not permissionless, I don't know.
00:26:54.170 - 00:27:14.930, Speaker B: It's not my project. But anyway, once DVT modules, permissionless DVT modules will be in place, I think they will be even more attractive for stakers than just a solo module. So my assumption here is that the share can be raised up to 10%, but initial share will be 1% for proper battle test.
00:27:17.300 - 00:27:32.630, Speaker A: Shubik, any idea how to make solo stakers life easier and more profitable with ABs? Some ABs that are targeted for source stakers to benefit from.
00:27:33.960 - 00:28:44.940, Speaker C: Yeah, for example, ind that we are building, it has like horizontal scaling so it can sustain hundreds of Mbps data bandwidth and it can go even higher based on the data requirements. So as we start having more on chain gaming rollups, social networks on chain, so the InDa requirements will go higher and higher. But because we are using azure codes, so each of these solo stakers, they'll be storing only small amount of bandwidth, so they will get lot of payments, the fees via ident from the rollups. And it's like an additional yield on top of whatever they're already making from Ethereum staking and there'll be other services like proof of location sequencing, like espresso is building sequencing. And there'll be of course other ads teams who might do sequencing and the proof of location and threshold signatures. So this will be like a lot of exciting projects from which they can earn additional yields.
00:28:47.120 - 00:29:54.560, Speaker A: Yeah, I hope that ABS providers will also provide tools for less sophisticated stakers to be able to join. Okay, so maybe let's talk about changes in Ethereum, some maybe not planned by some proposals. So I listed four proposals. One is Max churn, which limits the queue of validators to get in, get out. Another max effective balance, a proposal to increase max effective balance to 3200, as I recall from 32 ethers minimum viable issuance and validator to keep the number of validators of Ethereum lower. If you could share your opinion on how these points affect solostakers.
00:29:57.080 - 00:30:53.072, Speaker B: So I would start with the last one, and to be honest, I'm not that aware of the last one. Yeah, about the validator cap. So let's just skip it and then moving on to first. So with term limits, I do think that it will affect any validators on Ethereum, no matter are you solo staking or not solo staking? And it really depends on the market situation. So a couple of months ago we saw a huge queue, and for about a half a year before there was a huge queue and at the moment we see that there is no queue at all. So I don't think that it will particularly affect solo stakers. I do think that it might, in case of a huge queue, it might make it less attractive for vanilla solo stakers to actually take place in this queue and wait for a relatively long time for their validator to be activated.
00:30:53.072 - 00:31:37.296, Speaker B: But I don't think that it will drastically change situation. So we had Q before, we will have it in future probably. So no major things here about max effective balance. That's a pretty interesting thing because in terms of Ethereum in general and in terms of significantly large protocols, I think this proposal do make sense to reduce load on Ethereum network. But I personally not really like the way how it is motivated that it is beneficial for solo stakers. And the main motivation is that, okay, solo stakers do not need to take care of this extra rewards. They will be so called auto compounding.
00:31:37.296 - 00:32:15.152, Speaker B: But that's not actually true. If we look at the mechanics of bitcoin chain, we know that validator rewards are proportional to effective balance and effective balance is a rounded value. And for a single validator to flip this value from, let's say 32 that you start with to 32.5, it will take from three to four months, I guess. And during this period of time these rewards would be doing nothing. While in case of sweep, I think that solo staker can do something with it. He can sell it, he can use it for something like that.
00:32:15.152 - 00:32:51.470, Speaker B: On the other hand, yes, for sure it's good when your rewards are compounding. But let's be realistic. If you run only one validator with your 32 Eve, the chances of you getting another validator is relatively low and you would rather prefer to get something out of it rather than sitting and compounding for a bit more rewards. Or you would prefer to participate in a protocol like rocket pool, lido or any other LSD protocol. Well, you get more flexibility on it. I'm speaking about my minimal liable insurance. Sorry.
00:32:51.470 - 00:33:50.460, Speaker B: I do think that the chances of it being accepted is low. And if it will be accepted, the solo staking wouldn't be dead at all, but it would become way less attractive than it is now. Again, let's be realistic if we have one validator. We are saying that solo stakers are mostly not financially motivated, and we are saying it not because we do believe that even though they are getting this tons of money, they shouldn't care of it. No, we are saying it also because of the fact that real profits of solo staking are not that great. And in case of reducing issuance, these profits will become even lower and would probably be not sufficient enough to cover even like Internet costs or some super basic costs. That's my thinking of its proposals.
00:33:52.660 - 00:34:43.090, Speaker C: From my perspective, the Max churn rate, it was proposed from the unexpected acceleration in the people being so interested in staking. So everyone becomes staking, Maxine, and I feel like that with this proposal, the existing players, there's a consolidation among them and there is like an entry barrier for the new players to enter. So because of the churn rate, there's a queue out there where you can't do anything, you're just there not earning anything. So you might give it to existing players and just have an LST token which you can use for something. What is the second one?
00:34:43.620 - 00:34:49.116, Speaker A: We have Max churn, max effective balance, minimum viable issuance and validate.
00:34:49.228 - 00:35:13.530, Speaker C: So the max effective balance, I think I'll go with what you are saying. It depends on how many solo stakers have staked. Like 33, 34, 35. Eat something like that and they're earning on the effective balance around 31.25, I think. So how many such stakers are there? So it depends on that. And if there are way too many stakers, then it will benefit them.
00:35:13.530 - 00:36:25.276, Speaker C: If there are not that many stakers like that who are staking some intermediate values, then it does not affect that much. As for the minimum value data issuance, it's a very interesting proposal. It says that there should be as much stake which gives enough security to the projects that are deployed on top of Ethereum, which is important because in today's Ethereum, the fees that are given is proportional to the amount of compute that is being done. But in a world, ideally you'd want to have infinite computation, like when you have AWS and everything, you have infinite compute resource. So if you have imagined something like analogous in blockchain, then if there's an infinite computation, that means the reward from computation, that is today's gas fees and the rewards, it will go down dramatically. That will negligible rewards you'll get from staking. That means in those cases you want to give fees or the rewards based on the security that they are providing.
00:36:25.276 - 00:37:55.100, Speaker C: So this is where the protocols like stake share that Shiram talked about in the previous talk becomes important because stake shared, like in this proposal, the minimum validatory issuance, it misses very one important aspect that how do you measure how much security is needed? The protocol like stakeholder, it puts a positive incentive for the user to state that how much security it wants and it gives the premium for the solo staker or any staker, they will earn additional rewards from that insurance. So just minimum validator insurance does not work, I feel, but which takes sure it makes it working. As for the last one, what is it? Yeah, validator cap, I don't have exact opinion on that. But for the validator cap you want some kind of random churning so that as new people can enter, an existing player can go out and it should be somewhat random or pseudo random, maybe use random or that something. But if you don't have that mechanism, then new players cannot enter and existing players, there'll be consolidation. Again that additional churning capability, randomized churning capability is important for selection.
00:37:57.280 - 00:39:03.490, Speaker D: So with the churn one and the max effective balance, they're trying to solve the same issue. The main issue is around the kind of like network capacity of Ethereum. So we've got so many validators that the actual underlying network is getting a bit flooded and a bit fragile. So that's what they were trying to do with that. I definitely think the heat is off a little bit because the queue has gone down, but I would kind of support, I guess a slowdown of kind of like new validators if it gave the dev some time to kind of performance tune that element. Because ultimately I'm not being alarmist, but if that fails, then we've got bigger problems than necessarily people can't stake as much as they want to stake. So I think that's definitely the priority in terms of the max effective balance, it tries to do the same thing.
00:39:03.490 - 00:40:11.130, Speaker D: It tries to consolidate the number of validators. The only issue is that for solo stakers, for solo stakers, they're not going to provide as much value to that goal. So very large operators running thousands and thousands of validators, that's a big deal because they can consolidate their validators, whereas with a silo staker, maybe on rocket pool, the median number of validators per node is two. So it's really not going to make that much difference from a rocket pool perspective or towards that goal. I think it's a good VIP, but from our perspective, we're not going to have much value to it in terms of the minimum issuance. So that's a hard one, because the trouble is, totally agree. If you reduce that issuance, solo stakers are economically minded and there is an ROI with running staking, you at least need to get a machine right.
00:40:11.130 - 00:40:58.984, Speaker D: There's a lot of kind of like that involved. If you reduce it too far, it becomes uneconomical for somebody to run a node as a solo staker. The problem there is that you then start turning staking into a bowling business because the margins are so small, you have to squeeze out as much as possible. So then staking becomes a bowling business, and then the centralized providers become the best place to stake because they can squeeze out every last drop, whereas with kind of smaller providers they can't. So you'll actually just consolidate the network, consolidate with the big centralized providers rather than all the small. Even the small centralized providers won't be able to compete. So I guess I'm pretty down on that one.
00:40:58.984 - 00:41:01.770, Speaker D: But yeah, the others are kind of fun.
00:41:04.620 - 00:41:11.590, Speaker A: Guys, thank you so much for coming. That was my last question. Thanks a lot.
