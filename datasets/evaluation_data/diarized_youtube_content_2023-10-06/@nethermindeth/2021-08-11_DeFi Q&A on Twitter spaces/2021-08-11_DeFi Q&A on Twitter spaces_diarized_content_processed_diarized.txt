00:00:00.090 - 00:00:23.920, Speaker A: Hello everyone, and welcome to this space on Twitter. Big thanks to everyone joining us today. For those who don't know, this is basically an audio broadcast that we are going to be having a live Q A with IFCC speakers for those who are not able to make it to FCC. So everyone can catch up on the most interesting highlights during these three days before, let's have a short intro on what FCC actually is. William, could you explain that a little bit?
00:00:24.370 - 00:00:43.466, Speaker B: Yeah. So ECC is event hosted by the French Ethereum, people in Ethereum who are based in France, and they're holding a user conference in Paris right now for three days, and it's all about discussing the newest advancements in DeFi and Ethereum. Great.
00:00:43.568 - 00:01:36.490, Speaker A: So today is the long awaited first day of FCC. So what happened on the first day? Many topics like Dapps Ui, Ux, web free defi security, and many more were covered by professional speakers. We chose DeFi as today first topic to discuss, and we have four amazing speakers here to tell us all about their talks and maybe share with Us Secrets from today's FCC, please welcome Joseph Delong, chief technology officer at Sushi Swap, formerly senior software engineer at consensus Stani Kolachev, founder and CEO at Ave, leading blockchain startup on decentralized lending PwC top 50 blockchain startups David Bezo, a dev at Stoic Darrow and Greg Vardy, software engineer in our Nethermind Nubia team. Hi guys. Thank you for being here. We're super excited to have this opportunity to host this Q A. So let's get started.
00:01:36.490 - 00:01:49.040, Speaker A: As we mentioned before, today's spaces will be about DeFi, also called decentralized finance for those who are not familiar with Defi. Joseph, could you please give us a short intro on that?
00:01:50.210 - 00:01:51.038, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
00:01:51.124 - 00:02:03.620, Speaker C: So decentralized finance is a set of non custodial protocols built on smart contracts that allow you to access financial infrastructure in a permissionless way.
00:02:05.270 - 00:02:15.270, Speaker A: All right, that's really great explanation of such a sophisticated system. Could you tell to our newcomers what is the best way to get started with DeFi, in your opinion?
00:02:16.170 - 00:02:51.106, Speaker D: Well, I mean, obviously over the past few months, the best way to get started in DeFi is to get into the APy yield farming projects. I think this defi yield farming thing brought a lot of people into DeFi, and it's really easy for people to understand because they can just take some assets and then make some yield out of it. So I think people understand the concept since they all into it to make money. That was probably the biggest way to get more people into Defi, I guess.
00:02:51.288 - 00:03:00.200, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true, and it's really great to start. Thank you, Greg, can you think of some good use cases for DeFi and tell us how it actually works in real life?
00:03:01.130 - 00:03:59.320, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think one of the most interesting ones, well, a really great one, is automated market makers and decentralized exchanges. And I'll sort of explain why I say that. So, traditionally, if you wanted to buy an asset or hold an asset, you'd have to use a centralized exchange or a broker that uses a centralized exchange. And there's a lot of sort of sketchy things that go on with relation to high frequency trading and dark pools, et cetera, et cetera. And it's custodial service, too. So automated market makers, Dexes, essentially cut out that middleman. And an example of why that's a good thing is during the black Monday crash, when a lot of the exchanges, the crypto exchanges, were essentially freezing users'funds and preventing them from withdrawing all the Dexes and automated markets continued to operate exactly as you would expect.
00:04:00.010 - 00:04:00.470, Speaker B: Perfect.
00:04:00.540 - 00:04:07.578, Speaker A: That, I guess, already gave us a really good background to begin with. What do you think are the biggest challenges for Defi at the moment?
00:04:07.744 - 00:04:50.380, Speaker C: I think the usability sucks in Defi right now. The user experience from beginning to end is terrible. From wallets, like, wallets that you need to install fiat on. Ramps are terrible, nonexistent. And then the need for holding ETH to pay for gas is like, this whole system is a very bad user experience. And while we say it's for an emissionless, it kind of reserves itself to a very narrow set of nerds who know how to use it. And I think going forward, the things that we need to build are the tools that make the platforms accessible for everybody.
00:04:50.910 - 00:04:57.420, Speaker A: Yeah, fair enough. Looks like there is still plenty of work to do. So, William, let's start with some ECC connected questions.
00:04:57.790 - 00:05:11.070, Speaker B: Yeah, so y'all presented today, and I think I saw some of your presentations, and they were all really fantastic. Why don't you give a quick intro to your speeches? Sort of like, what's the Eiffel power level view of the topic?
00:05:11.410 - 00:05:14.370, Speaker D: What I talked today on the main stage.
00:05:15.350 - 00:05:16.100, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:17.350 - 00:06:27.898, Speaker D: I gave presentation about automographet maker, how automographet maker are basically winning and taking control of the traditional finance at the moment. Not necessarily winning, but how they will basically control the entire market of finance in a medium or long term vision. And I gave presentation of curve, how curve is doing on the governance level. All the curve walls with all the different projects, building on top of curve, trying to take control of the governance. And I match this vision with the video of wrecked opium, dystopian dreams. And this video is about like twelve minutes. I'm not sure if you guys seen it before, but if you don't, I really highly recommend to watch it because it's a very high quality video with a lot of different piece of parts inside and it gives the vision about how DeFi is disrupting the world.
00:06:27.898 - 00:07:00.386, Speaker D: But at the same time, we are getting against traditional finance, government, nation state, stable coins. People that had control of the power before because they were able to print money, well, now people with the ability to print stable coin, they are trying to take control of that power or that money worldwide. And that's the reason why big institutions, big corporations are fighting back and trying to regulate or trying to censor this technology.
00:07:00.568 - 00:07:10.978, Speaker B: Yeah, that's great. I actually watched it and I loved how fancy it was done. It was just like, oh my goodness, I almost shed a tear. It was so well produced.
00:07:11.154 - 00:07:16.642, Speaker D: Yeah, the people in the audience, they were pretty shocked, I think. Pretty shocked.
00:07:16.706 - 00:07:34.398, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, Joseph, I know you had some crazy announcements with the sushi swap, V two, I believe, with the whole trident stuff. That was pretty nuts, like all the new innovations you guys are doing. Why don't you provide like a quick overview of what you're doing? Yeah, sure.
00:07:34.484 - 00:08:26.826, Speaker C: So Sushi Trident is our new platform that we built out. It's our new amm, and it's an amm that we built on top of our bento box platform. Our Bento box platform is a platform in which tokens come in and then apps have the ability to access those tokens as a virtual balance, and the underlying balances are actually invested into yield strategies. So say, for instance, that you're going to be an LP, right? You would normally deposit 50 50 of each token. Unless there's a swap going on, those assets are sitting idle. And the idea is that not everybody's going to come back at the exact same time, withdraw 100% from the amm. So up to 80% of the underlying tokens get taken and exercised in yield strategies.
00:08:26.826 - 00:08:42.498, Speaker C: And so you get your swap fees on top, and then you also get the return on strategy from the underlying token. And there's like a whole slew of stuff that we did around that.
00:08:42.664 - 00:09:18.990, Speaker B: Yeah, that's cool. I think particularly the thing that was most interesting from the announcement for me was the whole routing thing where you guys were able to, you could swap different pairs and the sushi would do it automatically for you, for example, I want axes. I think that was the example stated in there. And I only have USDC. It would automatically swap from USDC to ETH and then ETH to AXs. So I think all that stuff is really cool. I don't think Stani is on right now, so he won't be able to talk about credit delegation.
00:09:18.990 - 00:09:26.260, Speaker B: But, yeah. What was the cool, sort of briefly alluded to at the beginning? What's the coolest thing that you've seen at ECC today?
00:09:27.990 - 00:09:59.740, Speaker C: I mean, all my friends in a post COVID world, that's the real thing that I've seen. But really, mostly I was preparing for the talk. And so I haven't really seen anything yet. But the talk I'm planning on going to tomorrow is with Sirtora Mooli, the CEO of Sirtora, who's our formal verifier. All of our contracts are formally verified. He's going to give a talk, and I can't wait to hear from what he has to say.
00:10:01.630 - 00:10:04.538, Speaker D: Julian, your talk was cool, man.
00:10:04.704 - 00:10:06.540, Speaker B: Joseph, really, like.
00:10:08.590 - 00:10:25.182, Speaker C: Dude, can you believe that? Remember not even that long ago, like a year ago, we're sitting at East Denver just talking about what we're going to do, right. We had no fucking clue what was going to happen afterwards. Yeah, crazy. This world is.
00:10:25.256 - 00:10:27.960, Speaker D: Yeah, upstairs we're like, man, what do we.
00:10:31.370 - 00:10:32.120, Speaker B: Mean?
00:10:32.730 - 00:10:38.374, Speaker D: Sushi is nuts right now. You guys are killing it.
00:10:38.412 - 00:10:39.366, Speaker B: I really like it.
00:10:39.468 - 00:10:51.266, Speaker D: And yeah, the concept, also the new routing mechanism. This is all these different things that you guys are building potentially. It looked like you're also going against little fight with curve.
00:10:51.318 - 00:10:52.160, Speaker B: I've seen.
00:10:53.570 - 00:11:10.850, Speaker C: Well, I'll tell you what, we really liked the design of curve V two, but the sticky part about curve v two is the research that went into it. We can't even copy that. Right. That research is so good. And you kind of have to do that to make those pools efficient.
00:11:12.230 - 00:11:17.638, Speaker D: Yeah, six months. Michael did pretty intense and savage work on that.
00:11:17.724 - 00:11:26.386, Speaker B: And then I guess, moving on, what projects people excite you most in DeFi right now? Maybe things that you've seen at CCE.
00:11:26.578 - 00:12:05.960, Speaker E: Yes, I think I'll take this one. So I'm really, really impressed with all the people at stockware, and I'm definitely not biased at all because I'm working on the EVM for Gyrospyla. But, yeah, starkware seems to be doing something really incredible. And that sort of ties into what Joseph spoke about earlier with the not great user experience and L2s potentially coming to the rescue with respect to the fee situation, et cetera, et cetera. And yeah, they just have some really cool technology and hopefully we'll be bringing it, helping bring EVM compatible languages to start net soon.
00:12:08.010 - 00:12:34.574, Speaker C: Not necessarily at ECC, but elementfi. I really love that project. I mean, obviously it's run by my super tight homie Johnny Ray and Will's here, but that project is really cool. The idea of decoupling yields from the underlying asset into yield coupons is brilliant. It's a new DeFi primitive, and it's going to be like we're going to see it everywhere soon.
00:12:34.772 - 00:12:36.160, Speaker B: Julian, you?
00:12:37.250 - 00:13:13.750, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, for me, what I'm very excited about is all the project around options and futures. So any project working around that area, I'm pretty passionate about. And also like some new solution for stablecoins. For example, a project called Angle. It's a new algorithmic stablecoin. Hopefully it won't get wrecked. But yeah, I think some new design around stablecoin and using very advanced derivative mechanism to keep the peg.
00:13:13.750 - 00:13:37.246, Speaker D: This, for me, is pretty interesting because it will lead define. So. Stablecoin is already taking control of the entire market cap, but it will even more a bigger volume in the future. So everyone building some very advanced stablecoins that are not backed by custodial solution and are completely decentralized.
00:13:37.278 - 00:13:40.260, Speaker B: I think it's very that.
00:13:40.630 - 00:13:41.330, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:13:41.480 - 00:14:07.580, Speaker E: I think that part of the reason why DeFi is so interesting, and why it succeeded so quickly is that you guys are talking about all these interesting new technologies and the new sushi swap, et cetera, et cetera. The rate of iteration is just so fast, it's incredible. And in sort of like traditional financial institutions, that is just completely impossible to do.
00:14:08.190 - 00:14:08.554, Speaker B: So.
00:14:08.592 - 00:14:12.460, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's definitely one of the reasons DeFi is so great.
00:14:12.830 - 00:14:25.620, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a bit of a follow up, but what projects are like, the DeFi space are like, are you sort of jealous? But not a bad way, but more of like, dang, I wish I could do that as well if I had extra time.
00:14:28.390 - 00:14:47.750, Speaker C: It hasn't been built yet, but David White and Sam Bankman fried their write up about kind of everlasting options. I wish I had the time to build that thing, because it's super badass, Greg.
00:14:49.630 - 00:15:12.480, Speaker E: Not directly related to DeFi protocols, but very high impact on DeFi. I think flashbots is super, super cool. I've been to a couple of the brainstorming sessions, and they really have Ethereum's best intentions at heart, and they're solving a really difficult problem that people have sort of very heated ideas on. So yeah, flashboards are pretty cool.
00:15:13.650 - 00:15:39.430, Speaker B: All right, well, yeah, I think institutional adoption has been pretty big portion of what DeFi has been about. I think it's kind of interesting for sushiswap. But has there been any institutional interest in Dexes or have they all been about what concerns have they raised regarding KYC and et cetera, et cetera?
00:15:41.790 - 00:16:19.830, Speaker C: We've had institutional clients that are interested in, not clients, but institutions that we talk to that are interested in lping on Dexes. The problem is like KYC, AML, and we need to kind of accommodate that. We are going to build out something with regard to that after the trident rollout, but not before, so that we can kind of allow them to onboard that liquidity. But the problem is, it isn't really like decentralized finance because they kind of like whitelist who can LP and who can swap. It's kind of like we'll have a preferred, I don't know, arbitrager essentially for their pools.
00:16:20.730 - 00:16:34.198, Speaker B: Yeah. Are there any concerns about, are you guys going to bifurcate pools so that you have all KYC and the other. It's just normal defi?
00:16:34.374 - 00:16:38.220, Speaker C: Yeah, that's how it would go. That's kind of like the design we've been working on.
00:16:38.590 - 00:16:57.700, Speaker B: Yeah. And I guess the other question I have is, what's one needing defi that isn't being served right now? Ideas that could be interesting, but you haven't really had time or bandwidth going for. I know you hinted at the whole everlasting options thing, but any other things, ideas, things that you would.
00:17:04.460 - 00:17:16.732, Speaker E: I think. I do think that the whole options and derivative developments are super interesting and there's a lot of really cool stuff to be done there. So if I had more time, I'd definitely want to be working on that.
00:17:16.866 - 00:17:17.900, Speaker B: You, Joseph?
00:17:18.320 - 00:18:04.828, Speaker C: Oh, I was just going to say no, that everlasting options is what I would be building if I had that bandwidth too, but I really don't. Nothing else really piques my interest right now. Options just overall are an interesting space, and it's hard because the way that the design of Amms has worked is basically made it so that the platform can't go fractional at any point in time. But options underwriting is much different. We had it built into dairy swap, but it's not always going to be perfect. And so the platform could go fractional at some point. You can't predict the future.
00:18:04.828 - 00:18:08.990, Speaker C: And so how do you underwrite options for Defi? It's a bit difficult.
00:18:10.660 - 00:18:18.240, Speaker B: Yeah. So what you're telling me, is there any way for optics to be done via an amm?
00:18:19.300 - 00:18:34.950, Speaker C: I haven't seen any good examples yet. I know that there are some people working on it where it's like, there's a relatively good guarantee that it won't go fractional, but I haven't seen kind of like a provably guaranteed way that it won't go and solve it at some point.
00:18:35.640 - 00:18:55.336, Speaker B: Okay. That's think. You know, Greg, you had some questions for Joseph in particular, as I. Oh, okay. That's Joseph. It's been like a crazy. All right, ignore all that graffiti.
00:18:55.336 - 00:19:04.690, Speaker B: But it's been a crazy six months for sushi swap. What do you think is your biggest achievement from the last year or so or last six months?
00:19:07.860 - 00:19:32.090, Speaker C: In the last six months, we launched Kashi Bento, Box miso. We've updated our UI, we've implemented limit orders, and today we're announcing Trident. Probably like 30 to 60 days. I really like Kashi. I think it's like a unique platform that would probably be the most, like the crowning achievement in my view.
00:19:33.100 - 00:19:34.570, Speaker B: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
00:19:35.660 - 00:19:46.060, Speaker E: I actually do have the question. I just thought of one and Joseph. Are you guys planning on doing any other l two integrations?
00:19:48.560 - 00:19:50.030, Speaker C: What do you mean by that?
00:19:51.520 - 00:19:56.910, Speaker E: Like, directly building on, like, building on an l two.
00:19:57.780 - 00:20:35.852, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, totally. We're definitely going to arbitram. In fact, our legacy amm is already deployed there, and as soon as that goes live, we'll be live. We haven't really thought about optimism yet. We're still a little annoyed that they wouldn't allow us to launch. Even though we were helping them debug their platform, they preferred to allow only uni to go first. So I don't know that we'll go there, but we're definitely going to arbitram and whatever ZKl two comes up first.
00:20:35.852 - 00:20:39.116, Speaker C: We're so down. Okay, cool.
00:20:39.218 - 00:21:50.560, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, we should definitely get in touch because I'm working on an EVM Takara transpiler, which is Cairo is the language that is used on Stocknet, which is starkware Z l two. And it's a ZK roll up. And the reason Cairo is so brilliant is that traditionally, when you want to make a smart contract amenable to zero knowledge proof, you would have to first convert it into an algebraic circuit and then convert that into a quadratic arithmetic program, et cetera, et cetera. So you get this sequence of really complicated steps, and it's quite daunting if you're not a cryptography ninja and you write a smart contract and you need to write a proving system with that too, which uses your Qap. So you end up with like really application specific code. So let's say you have an AmM running on this fictitious L two, and you want to add like a derivative service. You'd have to write the whole new algebraic circuits, et cetera, et cetera, a new proof system, another smart contract on layer one, and have that smart contract audited.
00:21:50.560 - 00:22:07.220, Speaker E: But with Cairo there's sort of none of that. And the cleverness behind it means that you can assert the validity of a whole bunch of l two transactions using a single proof, regardless of whether they are NFT trades tokens.
00:22:07.300 - 00:22:08.492, Speaker B: I think you kind of cut out.
00:22:08.626 - 00:22:09.644, Speaker C: Can you hear me?
00:22:09.762 - 00:22:13.310, Speaker B: Yeah, no, you're fine. Okay. Where did I get cut out?
00:22:14.960 - 00:22:16.252, Speaker D: I think you were fine.
00:22:16.386 - 00:22:18.750, Speaker B: I could hear same.
00:22:19.680 - 00:22:48.890, Speaker E: Yeah. So with Cairo in the example I gave before, you don't need to write a whole, you don't need to do any of that complicated algebraic circuit writing stuff. You just write a new Cairo contract. And so the sort of idea behind it all is that all the Cairo programs have a single algebraic intermediate representation that makes them sort of all equally amenable to proof. So you'd be able to use the same l one contract too.
00:22:49.820 - 00:23:21.250, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the goal is like starks or snarks circuits for EVM. Right. While I appreciate Cairo, the problem is that people aren't willing to kind of rewrite their contracts and people aren't going to trust a transpiler. But this EVM to Cairo is going to be fantastic. I can't wait. It's also going to allow us to maintain our code bases and maintain composition with other defi dapps. I can't wait.
00:23:21.940 - 00:23:26.900, Speaker E: What do you think of a formally verified transpiler?
00:23:27.240 - 00:23:27.748, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:23:27.754 - 00:23:31.830, Speaker C: It doesn't really make any difference for me because we still have to formally verify our code.
00:23:32.760 - 00:23:33.220, Speaker B: Okay.
00:23:33.290 - 00:23:50.250, Speaker E: Yeah, makes sense. Sorry, I just like, got another follow up question on that. You mentioned that you would enjoy an EVM to Cairo setup, but that's essentially a transpiler. Can you go into a bit more detail on.
00:23:51.340 - 00:24:24.070, Speaker C: Sorry, like maybe I misspoke there. I don't want to have to build on Cairo. I want to continue to build. Like, this is the reason that we're not on platforms that are good and have lots of liquidity like Solana and other upcoming platforms that have different contract formats. The main sticking problem is we can't interact with them or we have to rewrite our entire code base. It's like new language. This EVM to Cairo transpiler is great.
00:24:24.070 - 00:25:01.730, Speaker C: We'll be able to use that. And then the other thing is, we're looking at it at some point a Cairo implementation. The problem is it's kind of like, would build it, it would be a one off, and it wouldn't really have necessarily the composability with other Defi applications. But if we're doing EVM transpiling. Yeah, that's great. We can use our same code base and we can deploy that and we'll have composition with the other apps who are like EVM compatible as.
00:25:02.660 - 00:25:23.528, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Actually, our work was just open source recently. It's on GitHub at the Nethermind GitHub. It's called warp the transpiler. And we should be releasing a demo of transpiling an ERC 20 solidity contract and deploying it to stocknet within the next week or two.
00:25:23.614 - 00:25:23.816, Speaker B: So.
00:25:23.838 - 00:25:25.130, Speaker E: Yeah, look out for that.
00:25:25.500 - 00:25:45.536, Speaker B: Yeah. All right. And this is also another question, sort of following up. I mean, not really following up, but why was the decision to make it to the Trident to GPL? I know Sushiswap has their code under a more restrictive license. Why open it up?
00:25:45.638 - 00:26:24.510, Speaker C: So we don't have our code under a restrictive license? There are platforms that we built, we co developed that we don't own ventil and kashi. We don't own, we don't own the license. We were granted an unlimited license from boring crypto as we co developed it. It was part of the payment. This goes into a whole other conversation that I have about how shitty incentives are in DAos and how it's hard to structure Dao in such a way that you can allow people to act as founders, like we had to have with Kashi and Ben Hillbox. Everything else has been gpl three and Trident will be GPl three. And we really believe in this.
00:26:26.000 - 00:26:35.856, Speaker B: Okay, then how would you prevent someone from. I mean, not prevent, but what would stop someone from doing another vampire attack?
00:26:36.038 - 00:27:02.330, Speaker C: Just working your stuff again. I don't lack confidence in our community, in our team. We're better engineers and we have a better community. So try and fork us out. I actually challenge you to try and fork Sushi and have a better community and a better engineering team.
00:27:02.780 - 00:27:25.040, Speaker B: All right, I'll book a time tomorrow and then I'll take a stab. But, yeah, you make a good point. Sushi community is super duper strong, and maybe we won't be able to see the same kind of vampire attack. One of the other questions, what are the benefits of MeV that are introduced to sushi swap?
00:27:26.500 - 00:28:03.660, Speaker C: We can't really do anything about MeV other than kind of minor mitigations. MeV really comes down to this idea of can introduce. If we introduce asynchrony into a transaction, essentially all MeV can be mitigated. If we insert changes into the protocol of Ethereum that allow a different way to do block ordering, then we can mitigate MeV. But there really is no way to mitigate MeV without introducing asynchronous, which breaks Ethereum's composition.
00:28:04.640 - 00:28:05.356, Speaker B: That's pretty cool.
00:28:05.378 - 00:28:24.636, Speaker E: Yeah, I agree. I think it's sort of virtually completely, you know, any attempt to ignore it or try stave it off without doing the things that Joseph mentions probably just results in it happening behind closed doors instead of in the open, like it happens now with Flashbox.
00:28:24.828 - 00:28:31.190, Speaker C: I think Flashbox is the best near term solution, but long term, that's a terrible solution in my view.
00:28:31.800 - 00:28:47.130, Speaker E: Yeah, I think they might agree with that. Flashbox in its current form. Obviously, the organization is going to evolve, and they're pretty dedicated to doing everything they can to solve the MeV problem.
00:28:47.680 - 00:28:54.940, Speaker B: Yeah, and jumping off of sushi. What do you think it'll take for Defi to go mainstream?
00:28:55.680 - 00:29:43.630, Speaker C: Yeah, we got to fix this whole UX problem. Ux is so bad. We can't keep continuing on ignoring the problems with gas that are necessary with gas abstraction. And the speed of the network is really slow having people install wallets. In my opinion, the network that has this solved the most is flow. And they have kind of like really nice integrated wallets with nice fiat on ramps. They can kind of go custodial or, you know, but still, we need to solve some of those UX issues, and then everybody can use it.
00:29:44.320 - 00:29:46.670, Speaker A: Ian, Greg, what are you thinking about that?
00:29:47.440 - 00:30:23.450, Speaker E: Yeah, I think pretty much agree with every single thing Joseph just said. And I think in the short term, the L two s are a huge solution to some. I don't know if I'm thinking about why my friends don't use DFI or ethereum. The majority of them don't use it, either because they think it's too complicated which ties into the UX experience, or that the fees are just way too high, which sort of ties into what we're doing. Building the EVM to Cairo transpiler. Definitely the fees and the user experience.
00:30:25.020 - 00:30:56.944, Speaker B: Okay. All right. Also, audience, if you have any questions, feel free to dm us and we'll try to answer them right now. Yeah. All right, so we're going to play a game that financial times that they do under their interview. Another thing that us defiers are stealing from Tradfi and it's basically called long short. Are you long or do you like the idea or are you short an idea? And it'll be sort of like a lightning round.
00:30:56.944 - 00:31:28.990, Speaker B: And audience, if you have any ideas for things that you want to hear us long short about, ideas that you want to take on, just feel free to DM that to us as well. But yeah, so we'll sort of do it like a lightning round. I'll spam them to you and then you can say whether you're long, short or in the middle about it. And if you want to explain why you take that particular position. All right, are you guys ready?
00:31:29.540 - 00:31:30.290, Speaker D: Ready.
00:31:31.860 - 00:31:34.060, Speaker B: All right. ETH killers.
00:31:34.220 - 00:31:34.930, Speaker E: Short.
00:31:35.940 - 00:31:36.690, Speaker C: Short.
00:31:37.860 - 00:31:51.604, Speaker B: Okay. USD as a stable Us. The US dollar as like the stablecoin of choice, short. All right. Algorithmic stablecoins, short.
00:31:51.802 - 00:31:58.120, Speaker C: Well under collateralized. Algorithmic stablecoin, short. Long. Over collateralized.
00:31:58.620 - 00:32:03.560, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Institution only. Defi markets.
00:32:05.580 - 00:32:07.850, Speaker C: Indifferent. I don't know, what's the middle one?
00:32:08.860 - 00:32:11.068, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess indifferent. Indifferent is fine. Yeah.
00:32:11.074 - 00:32:15.532, Speaker E: I think it's hard to see how that plays out. I might just say short, though.
00:32:15.586 - 00:32:20.844, Speaker B: Okay. More spectacular rug pulls and bigger wrecks. More people getting wrecked.
00:32:20.892 - 00:32:21.730, Speaker C: So long.
00:32:22.580 - 00:32:25.010, Speaker E: Yeah. That'll give julian lots more content.
00:32:27.540 - 00:32:37.060, Speaker B: All right. We're all going to make it. All right. That's true. That's true. And this might be a little bit of a deal breaker. We might have to end it early.
00:32:37.060 - 00:32:40.416, Speaker B: Response. Pineapple on pizza.
00:32:40.608 - 00:32:41.910, Speaker E: The work has taken.
00:32:43.320 - 00:32:46.310, Speaker C: You know, it isn't that bad. I'll go.
00:32:48.840 - 00:32:49.384, Speaker E: My man.
00:32:49.422 - 00:33:08.124, Speaker B: My man. Greg, unfollow me on Twitter. Joseph is my new best friend. Yeah. All right. I think because of Greg's unsatisfactory answer, we'll have to end it early. Just a last minute thing.
00:33:08.124 - 00:33:12.560, Speaker B: Any cool stories from event today's event? How was Paris after the first time? After COVID?
00:33:13.620 - 00:33:33.510, Speaker C: It was great, man. It was really great seeing everybody. I'm really grateful to ECC to have us and kind of help us out. This is one of the premier events for ethereum and I'm just happy to be back in Paris again.
00:33:35.080 - 00:33:38.550, Speaker B: Oh, any good restaurant recommendations around the area?
00:33:41.740 - 00:33:44.810, Speaker C: I don't know. I'm more of like a Google kind of person.
00:33:48.320 - 00:33:50.910, Speaker B: Okay. All right, that's fair enough. Fair enough.
00:33:51.920 - 00:33:58.750, Speaker A: I would also like our audience to request to open the mic and maybe ask a little questions that they have.
00:34:00.560 - 00:34:05.936, Speaker B: Yeah. If you have any last minute questions you want, feel free to request. Or you can dm us.
00:34:05.958 - 00:34:08.400, Speaker A: Yeah, we would love to. We would love shy.
00:34:08.980 - 00:34:29.980, Speaker B: All right, we have one request. All right, let's hear it. Okay. All right. Looks like it might have been a bust. It could be a Twitter error as well. Okay.
00:34:30.050 - 00:34:38.530, Speaker A: Actually, we have also. I have one more question to Greg. How does wrap fit into everything?
00:34:40.680 - 00:35:30.640, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think the main thing we're trying to do with wolf ties into what Joseph was talking about where you have an l two protocol. Sorry, an L1 protocol. And they want to build on an l two, but they really don't want to have to rewrite everything in a new language. But part of the reason that Starknet or starkware. Starknet is so brilliant is because of Cairo, because of the fact that you don't have to write a whole new quadratic arithmetic program, et cetera, et cetera, for each different program to construct a proof, you know, that really makes it unique among the ZK roll ups. And zk roll ups have a really nice property that optimistic roll ups can't. That is that you don't have that withdrawal delay, which is like.
00:35:30.640 - 00:36:01.180, Speaker E: Also ties into what Joseph was talking about with respect to the not great user experience. And it's really not great if you want to withdraw your money to l one and transfer it to another l two or something, and you have to wait a week for that transfer to go through. So, yeah, I think what we're trying to do is basically just make it a lot easier for developers to be able to just write solidity or Viper, et cetera, and not have to worry about anything relating to Cairo so they can keep the composability, et cetera.
00:36:03.200 - 00:36:45.500, Speaker B: All right, ball is life. You want to pop in a question? Thank you for bringing me up. It's for Joseph. I was just curious recently, it's pretty big governance news for sushi with the recent raise and at the price that a lot of the VCs got the raise. I was just curious because it seems like, from what I saw on Twitter, and I don't know, it seems like it was something like you kind of found out about after the fact. I'm just curious as to your take on it. I'm just playing like the devil's advocate.
00:36:45.500 - 00:37:18.068, Speaker B: People are obviously very critical because it doesn't seem fair or decentralized. I don't know. I'm just curious as how you think the incentives will play out. There's been people tracking wallets that have dumped tokens relating to those VCs or those VCs have dumped sushi tokens recently. So I'm just curious as to your perspective. Sure.
00:37:18.234 - 00:37:46.030, Speaker C: So there's a bit to dissect there. First thing, there's been no sale. There's been a proposal. There's been a forum post written up as a proposal, and there's been debate about it. The way that the proposal is phrased, framed in the forum, I hate it. I think our community hates it, too. And they've done a really good job of being like the white blood cells of that.
00:37:46.030 - 00:38:22.570, Speaker C: There is no proposed sale that is going through. And also, when I said on Twitter, just got back something about, like, I heard that we sold out the VCs. That was tongue in cheek. I had been following it all along, but I've been focused on the Trident build up and I wanted to stay off Twitter because I think I'm famous for being the biggest shit poster on Twitter ever. And so I wanted to kind of take my time and.
00:38:24.460 - 00:38:25.176, Speaker E: Stay off of.
00:38:25.198 - 00:39:03.476, Speaker C: Twitter so I could focus on, like, this VC thing came up. The deal is getting refined every day. In fact, they're doing three hour sushi community forums every day this week to discuss a new deal. And I don't even think the original deal is even close to what's happening for me. I think the maximum that we should sell is like 20 million max. And I think the community is pushing more towards a no discount with a lockup, which is like, I don't know how they pulled off that 4d chest, but it seems to be working. So that's good for them.
00:39:03.476 - 00:39:18.270, Speaker C: But I'm also not super close to it. Everything will be continued to be discussed until there's, like, a rough consensus. Nothing would be put up as a proposal to be voted on without their feeling that there's, like, a rough consensus from the community.
00:39:20.160 - 00:39:24.924, Speaker B: Cool. Thank you for that. Yeah.
00:39:24.962 - 00:39:38.160, Speaker A: Actually, I would like to ask you guys about Mev. So firstly, maybe to Joseph very overall question of what do you think the benefits would be for sushi swap with Mev introduced?
00:39:39.460 - 00:40:35.504, Speaker C: I mean, Mev is already. I mean, it would be very great if we could have basically zero Mev because why am I paying a miner a transaction fee for them to include me in the block? And then they can kind of like, this is all around protocol design MeV, it's like the block producer has the sole right to do block ordering and a malicious block order. In my view, the block ordering should be natural on the basis of your gas payment. But there's no provable way to do that inside of a consensus mechanism. So block orders can do whatever they want, and if block orders can do whatever they want, they can do MeV. Until we come up with a solution around like block ordering, we're going to have MeV. And I think it sucks.
00:40:35.504 - 00:40:46.200, Speaker C: It sucks for the users, and it's great for block producers. By that I mean miners right now and in the future, e two block producers.
00:40:47.580 - 00:40:48.488, Speaker B: Okay, perfect.
00:40:48.574 - 00:41:31.380, Speaker E: I agree with the theme there, because it's sort of inevitable with the current base layer of ethereum design. What you really don't want is you don't want, like MeV happening completely in private, where no one knows who's doing what, and people are making deals behind closed doors, et cetera, et cetera. So I think for the moment, that's something that really flashbots has done a great job to mitigate and allow sort of anyone who knows solidity and some JavaScript or go maybe to try extract some meV themselves and not necessarily let the miners get everything or just do all the MeV. But yeah, it does kind of suck.
00:41:31.720 - 00:41:34.070, Speaker C: But it's sort of got to stay.
00:41:35.660 - 00:41:45.604, Speaker B: Is there a blockchain that's been structured that better tackles this? Can you think of one that's like big ish?
00:41:45.732 - 00:42:47.052, Speaker C: Now there are solutions, there are solutions, but they introduce asynchronous. The best one that exists, I think, is made by Algorand. They have this, their VRF, right? They have this whole strategy for revealing as a group, it is really great platform, it works, but it fails for liveness. So if not enough people are online or a bunch of the users fall offline, the reveal won't happen. And so the introduction of asynchrony into. And also, do you want natural block ordering? Do I want to order the block on the basis of payment or do I want to order the block on the basis of the natural order? That's like the order of arrival. Why should somebody get in a block in a specific space? I'm happy with the system.
00:42:47.052 - 00:43:24.250, Speaker C: Now, let's say pre nev, where it's like block ordering is on a basis of what kind of gas payment you make, right? But why should they order the block any specific way? Right? There are ways that you can order a block that allow the trade to happen in a more intelligent way as well. But I don't know where I was going with that. Anyway, Mev is just kind of like an outcome of the block order.
00:43:25.680 - 00:44:38.824, Speaker E: On that last point you made about there are ways to order transactions that could be more optimal for users. I think incorporating the inevitability of MeV on Ethereum could help you come up with some interesting designs. Like for example, let's say you want to implement some sort of limit order system on your decks. And a way to incentivize or a way to create more liquidity at certain price levels is that you could have bots who hold a token that someone would like to buy, and the price that they want to buy at is currently much lower or lower than the price that is available for the token. You could have some sort of set up where the guy who, the bot who owns a lot of that token, he could sell a bit of it and then allow the other guy to buy, and then, sorry, he could buy a bit of it and then allow the other guy to go and sort of like back run him. So the human non bot gets the lower price he wants, and the bot gets a better price afterwards for his tokens that he holds.
00:44:38.952 - 00:44:39.292, Speaker B: Sure.
00:44:39.346 - 00:44:50.064, Speaker C: But any solution right now, if we don't solve it, if we want a perfect solution that basically eliminates MeV.
00:44:50.192 - 00:44:51.510, Speaker E: If we want to do that.
00:44:53.400 - 00:45:23.330, Speaker C: It starts to introduce asynchronous, right? We have these beautiful, composable synchronous transactions right now in Ethereum, and I like to keep that as long as we can. I don't know, we could keep it forever. But if we introduce some sort of new thing for housewap, for instance, it's like an asynchronous platform, right? It essentially eliminates mev in most senses. But we have to introduce asynchrony or we have to fix it at the protocol level.
00:45:24.340 - 00:45:29.170, Speaker E: Well, wouldn't introducing asynchrony require changes at the protocol level?
00:45:29.940 - 00:46:00.030, Speaker C: No, I mean, for the instance of cowswap is like they kind of put up these transactions and they have a solver submit, right? It's like right now I can swap, add liquidity, remove, take a flash, loan, swap, remove, liquidity. I can do all of that in a single synchronous transaction. Right? But if I'm to do this in an asynchronous way, then I'm kind of like waiting for everything to be batched together, and I can't do simultaneous actions unless we create some sort of system for those to hook in.
00:46:01.280 - 00:46:02.590, Speaker E: Okay, interesting.
00:46:03.680 - 00:46:16.576, Speaker B: And I don't know, I don't think all Mav is bad. I think it's only sandwich attacks that are like the worst. But otherwise maybe shouldn't be something that we should completely eliminate as something.
00:46:16.678 - 00:46:55.820, Speaker E: Yeah. I mean, in the proof of stake world, it could help make, might help make Ethereum more secure by attracting more stakers, because the prospects of getting a higher yield on your staked ethereum, if you're able to partake in mev, et cetera, et cetera. So it's definitely not all bad. Another example where it might be good is liquidations, when, well, Mev in the sense through flashbots, where you aren't having these crazy bidding wars in the mempool, causing gas prices to go to like 1000 g way like they did a couple of months ago. So you have it sending through Coinbase.
00:46:59.200 - 00:47:16.864, Speaker C: Sorry, I'm going to take the opposite stance. All Mev is bad, right? The only reason that it exists is because we can't prevent it. But the whole goal of MeV is instead of me robbing you, wouldn't it be good if I extorted you more regularly?
00:47:16.992 - 00:47:17.670, Speaker B: Right.
00:47:18.200 - 00:47:25.396, Speaker C: That's the whole design of anti MeV platforms.
00:47:25.588 - 00:47:26.392, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree.
00:47:26.446 - 00:47:40.380, Speaker E: I agree with that. But I was sort of like talking from this perspective of it's inevitable and it's there and it sort of can't be mitigated. Currently on Ethereum, with the current protocol.
00:47:44.000 - 00:47:50.700, Speaker C: And. Right, with protocols, we're only guaranteed what the protocol guarantees. They can do it and be assholes.
00:47:50.780 - 00:47:51.410, Speaker B: Right?
00:47:53.060 - 00:47:55.810, Speaker C: But they can do it. They're allowed to do it, right?
00:47:56.340 - 00:48:28.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to say it also sucks when mining becomes more concentrated, and I don't know if that will kind of go over when staking occurs, with big staking pools having a lot of power as well. And I was just curious, Joseph, have you considered implementing a system like cowswap that uses asynchronous verification for transactions in order to mitigate Mev?
00:48:29.180 - 00:48:47.890, Speaker C: No, but we look at all of, of, we kind of have a really good team to give an analysis on these different protocols, but for the most part, we haven't really talked about doing an implementation of a cow swap on our end.
00:48:49.380 - 00:49:35.840, Speaker E: Yeah, I also think there's like a big difference between being provably MeV free in the mathematical sense and probably MeV free, because probably MeV free is probably worse than just not claiming to be MeV free, because a lot of people might think that it's impossible to do, and you might end up with a situation where groups of highly motivated, well funded, highly intelligent people figure it out. And so Mev sort of becomes on that platform like this thing that only very few people can partake in, where currently. Now, if you work hard enough and you know, a bit of solidity, et cetera, you can be a searcher and capture some MEV.
00:49:39.380 - 00:49:40.512, Speaker A: Hi, guys.
00:49:40.646 - 00:50:00.212, Speaker F: Quick question for someone who might not be following everything you're saying, but in terms of you mentioned that there is no way to mitigate MeV without an asynchrony. Could you just run me through the basics? And what is this asynchrony that you're mentioning? And why is this, like, the reason why you can't mitigate Mev?
00:50:00.356 - 00:50:02.120, Speaker B: That makes sense. Sure.
00:50:02.190 - 00:51:15.292, Speaker C: Yeah. So right now, you can do a bunch of simultaneous actions in a single transaction. So in that transaction, I can do stuff like I can trade on sushi and I can stake in Aave, but if I were to create a platform that kind of like, well, if I were to create something that solved MeV, there would be, like, most of them involve a commit reveal scheme. And a commit reveal scheme is a scheme where I kind of, like, commit to something with a hash of what I'm going to provide later or signed message of what I'm going to commit later. And then there's a reveal period where I am then revealing that. And this kind of falls in the opposite direction in that the user can go, oh, the transaction that I'm about to reveal is not advantageous, so I'm not going to reveal, but that still kind of introduces asynchronous nature in that I can only do a single action in particular. So MeV really is focused on swaps.
00:51:15.292 - 00:52:11.504, Speaker C: Right. And the problem is that when I send my transaction to swap, I don't know how much the pool will have shifted. And so I kind of set some tolerance. It says, like, I don't know, one to 3%, something like that. Right. I'm hoping that by the time I'll accept this price, within 1% to 3%, MeV is like, they have this way of, because the block producer isn't paying for gas in the block, they can kind of surround that transaction, and they can swap in the direction to push you up to your 3%, and then after they execute your transaction, then they can swap back in the other direction. And so we have to have some system where the ordering of those transactions is fair.
00:52:11.622 - 00:52:11.904, Speaker B: Right.
00:52:11.942 - 00:52:20.436, Speaker C: And right now, the block producer can order them in whatever way that they want. Does that make more sense? I don't know. I think I probably went crazy again.
00:52:20.618 - 00:52:41.868, Speaker F: Well, I mean, it's so hard to. There's so many bits to kind of unravel, of course. But I feel like you've really described the problem but I still don't quite know how one would go about mitigating and finding that fair way of ordering the transactions. But that might be for a different kind of talk.
00:52:42.034 - 00:52:42.364, Speaker B: Sure.
00:52:42.402 - 00:52:50.496, Speaker C: No, we'll put them in like, this is the idea. Okay. We put them in a digital hat, right? And we have somebody reach into the digital hat and pull one out.
00:52:50.678 - 00:52:51.410, Speaker B: Right.
00:52:51.860 - 00:53:03.090, Speaker C: But that whole system creates a system that's not synchronous because we have to have kind of like a point in which they reach into the hat and pull out the piece of paper.
00:53:03.620 - 00:53:04.288, Speaker B: All right.
00:53:04.374 - 00:53:05.890, Speaker F: Yeah, that makes sense.
00:53:07.240 - 00:53:15.370, Speaker B: Hey, guys, don't want to take over discussion, but I was wondering if I could ask Joseph a question real quick.
00:53:16.300 - 00:53:17.736, Speaker C: Yeah, shoot, man.
00:53:17.918 - 00:53:59.300, Speaker B: So hearing about or seeing your presentation with Sushi swap today, I'm a big sushi supporter and I'm also a token developer. My main issue with V three was with uniswap. V three was how don't stopping you. Where was I? How they kind of killed the composability with their platform, with how they did non fungible positions. I was curious, with the different pools that you guys have, are you going to, with the capital efficient one, going to be able to do fungible lp positions or will it also be nfts.
00:54:00.120 - 00:54:48.820, Speaker C: For our concentrated liquidity positions, which is the most similar, we're not going to have ERC 720 ones. We're going to have ERC 1155s, which are like tranche multiples of non fungible positions. The problem is the design of concentrated liquidity positions mandates it. There are only so many ways that you can build certain things under the sun, and this one in particular has design constraints that require you to have non fungible positions. But that being said, we're going to have lots of ancillary contracts that are going to make those simple and composable. We don't plan on breaking yield farming or anything in the near future. We'll bring some designs to make those very simple processes.
00:54:50.120 - 00:55:13.630, Speaker B: That's awesome. Thank you, Joseph. One more if I may. How are you guys going to route your yield farming on LP or on liquidity? Is it going to continue to be like first party through bentobox? Or are you guys going to go for more of like a routing aggregator type deal?
00:55:15.600 - 00:55:44.484, Speaker C: If you're already staked in the MasterChef B two, like you're staked on sushi swap, that's going to get automatically migrated to Trident, you won't have to do anything. It'll just get moved for you. Those positions, now that you have that are like farming for sushi. The underlying tokens will also get utilized in strategies as well. So it's like you're going to get a lot more yield out of this.
00:55:44.522 - 00:55:45.108, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely.
00:55:45.194 - 00:55:54.570, Speaker B: How are you guys organizing the strategies or picking highest yield? Or will it just be like, okay, this one's going to compound, this one's going to ave and that kind of stuff.
00:55:55.260 - 00:56:22.070, Speaker C: We have to do low, no risk strategies and we're still working out some of it. We really only have one strategy written like compound. And so I welcome anybody who wants to help us make new strategies. We're going to have kind of $2 billion to work with here. So I think it's worth someone's while to become a strategist for that. But in the near term, we just kind of have compound wrapping for just tokens in general.
00:56:24.040 - 00:56:26.550, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you, Joseph. I appreciate it.
00:56:28.280 - 00:56:37.850, Speaker A: Okay, so last year was D five summer. This year is l two summer. So what's on the horizon for next summer? What do you guys think?
00:56:39.260 - 00:56:40.264, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know.
00:56:40.302 - 00:56:41.508, Speaker C: Normie Summer.
00:56:41.684 - 00:56:43.224, Speaker E: Yeah, that's what I was about to say.
00:56:43.262 - 00:56:43.416, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:56:43.438 - 00:56:47.800, Speaker E: Defi becoming normies. Welcoming in Defi.
00:56:48.220 - 00:57:02.972, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's pretty good. Okay, so thanks, everyone for joining. Thanks for listening. Huge thanks to all of the speakers. It was great to have you here. And see you guys next time. That means tomorrow, the same time.
00:57:02.972 - 00:57:04.700, Speaker A: Six, seven p. M. CST.
00:57:05.600 - 00:57:06.012, Speaker B: Cool.
00:57:06.066 - 00:57:07.800, Speaker E: Thanks, guys. Thanks, Joseph.
00:57:07.960 - 00:57:11.070, Speaker C: Yeah, guys, thanks for having me. It was awesome.
00:57:12.760 - 00:57:13.124, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:13.162 - 00:57:14.050, Speaker A: Thank you guys very much.
