00:00:06.320 - 00:01:15.252, Speaker A: Hi, my name is Shrimin. I'm the founder of Token Kitchen and the author of the book Token Economy in the third edition of Token Economy. In the book daos and purpose driven tokens, I have developed a token design thinking framework which I would like to present at the bar camp in Paris in a light, workshop style. Which means that I will be speaking about I will be presenting the design thinking framework, the step by step process, and then I'm hoping to have an interactive session where I get feedback from you, answer any questions you might have, but also get feedback from especially the more seasoned token engineers from you to see how we might be able to improve this design thinking framework. The framework I will present will also exist as an online tool. Hopefully by July it will be ready. An open source tool that anyone can use and we can collectively amend it approaches the question of how to design the token or the tokens in your system from four different perspectives.
00:01:15.252 - 00:02:07.770, Speaker A: But it starts with the question of the purpose. What is the purpose? Do you have one single? And how many purposes do you have? Should you have multiple purposes? How many token types do you need? And then analyzing the token types from the perspective of what political system, what economic system you want to create and derived from that, you can then look at the properties the tokens will need to have in order to fulfill their purpose. And then you look at the legal compliance aspects, how to design or make your tokens legally compliant, and on which infrastructure to ultimately deploy your token system. But the legal and technical questions come last, and last but not least, and it's an iterative process, so I'm hoping to delve and deep dive more into all these questions together with you in Paris. See you soon.
