00:00:00.410 - 00:01:01.820, Speaker A: Hello. This is Rex from the Bonnie Curve Research Group and a contributor of the token Engineering Commons, and this is my pitch for the session called modelling bonding curves with conding. Now, in the bonding curve research group, we really believe that these mechanisms are truly underappreciated, created and overlooked in many of the instances. So we've been over the last couple of months, been categorizing, analyzing, and building out tools to understand them and to be able to make better use of them. As part of this process, we've built out a python package called conding with a number of different bonding curve models, including, well, beginning with TC models, but it also, of course, includes Univ, two Bancorp and some others.
