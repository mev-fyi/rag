00:00:07.210 - 00:01:12.126, Speaker A: So we're going to talk about a bonding curve setup. So probably a lot of you know what a bonding curve is, but I'm going to kind of introduce it anyway. So if you're building a crypto economic system like Golem, be one example that we've mentioned before, then what you might decide to do is for payments in your network to either use something generic like ETH, or you might want to use your own native token. And there are different reasons why you would or would not to do that. I think one good reason you might want to do that, and I quite like this kind of way of thinking, is that your native token allows the price of your token to be correlated to what's going on in your network if needed. And that kind of feedback loop could be very useful for your system. If you're using ETH and there's something going on in your network, it's extremely unlikely that the price of ether is going to evolve somehow correlated to what's going on in your network.
00:01:12.126 - 00:02:11.622, Speaker A: And that's something you might want with your native token. You're still not guaranteed, because what we see a lot is that there might be a lot of speculation around your token, and still the movement of your price might be more around the speculation rather than what's going on in the network. But at least that way you give it a chance that what's going on in the network actually is reflected in the price. And so if you do use your own native token, you need some way of creating it and some way of getting it into the hands of the users, and why? One way of doing that is to use a bonding curve. And what a bonding curve is is this smart contract that sits on the blockchain. And at any point in time any user can either buy your native token from it or sell your native token to it. And what this bonding curve specifies, this one is quadratic, is what the price of the token is at any given point in time.
00:02:11.622 - 00:03:14.966, Speaker A: So on the y axis we have the price of the token, and on the x axis we have the number of tokens in circulation. So we can see that the price of the token is just a function of the number of tokens in circulation and it increases quadratically. So if we do some simple math, then we can see that if you want to buy a volume v of tokens, then it's going to increase quadratically with the number of tokens in circulation. So thanks to that we might have this kind of useful behavior that, well, first of all, the more tokens there are in circulation, the higher the price. Right. So that would give some sort of a soft limit on the number of tokens in circulation. But also, if you imagine this kind of scenario where your users, some of your users are kind of very devoted to the project and some aren't as involved, and maybe those who aren't as involved want to exit the system, then what will happen is that those people would maybe choose to sell their token, which means that we would go down the bonding curve.
00:03:14.966 - 00:03:39.090, Speaker A: And then what would happen is that the number of tokens of circulation would be lower and it would be just enough for those really devoted users for the system to get stable again at this lower price. So there's kind of a nice feature of this bonding curve. And from our point of view, this whole setup is just another part of our system design.
00:03:39.160 - 00:03:39.346, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:39.368 - 00:04:30.260, Speaker A: So this is another hyperparameter that potentially we might want to want to tune, because that's definitely going to affect the resultant behavior of our users. So that's why we want to do some work of designing this thing. So now, before we go into the experiment, it would be great to kind of hear your thoughts on what you think would be things to consider, and we can kind of, again, divide them into those three groups. So, hyperparameters, what do you think the important hyperparameters would be? So the things that kind of define our system and are in our control. So we get to decide them. Then there are parameters which are out of our control, and those are the things that define what happens in the system after it's been launched. And then we have some assumptions about what it is that our users might care about.
00:04:30.260 - 00:04:44.246, Speaker A: If you have some ideas for any of these that we might want to consider, then feel free to suggest something. Okay. Do we have the mic or not?
00:04:44.428 - 00:04:51.338, Speaker C: The maximum number of token one agent can acquire or buy at any time or in total?
00:04:51.504 - 00:04:57.990, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, that could be useful. Yeah. So that would go into our hyperparameters.
00:04:58.070 - 00:04:58.314, Speaker D: Right.
00:04:58.352 - 00:05:01.470, Speaker A: Because that's something we can specify initially.
00:05:04.290 - 00:05:11.550, Speaker E: You could have a spread between buy and sell. Spread between the buy and sell price. So not just a single curve.
00:05:12.370 - 00:05:25.800, Speaker A: Okay, interesting. So we could have a separate bonding curve for selling. Okay, interesting. And that would be for kind of the system to accumulate money.
00:05:26.250 - 00:05:43.942, Speaker E: Well, it's used by a few projects also to reduce shorting because there's a cost. And so depending on how wide the spread is. So it can be used for capital accumulation, but it can also be used as a disincentive to shorting.
00:05:44.006 - 00:05:44.940, Speaker A: Okay, interesting.
00:05:46.990 - 00:06:00.670, Speaker F: Yeah. For different agents. You might want to assume a short and a long intention to participate in this economy, let's say. And additionally you might want to choose initial capital available for both the short and the long.
00:06:00.740 - 00:06:04.754, Speaker A: Exactly. So like a budget constraint for every agent. Yeah, that would go, yeah.
00:06:04.872 - 00:06:05.810, Speaker G: Assumptions.
00:06:07.110 - 00:06:07.890, Speaker A: Mmhmm.
00:06:12.150 - 00:06:22.120, Speaker H: Something like the stickiness of tokens. So availability, maybe some other use cases in the system so that they are there, but they are not available.
00:06:24.650 - 00:06:25.654, Speaker A: I'm not sure if I.
00:06:25.692 - 00:06:35.930, Speaker H: So for example, you can use a token to buy things, so people start saving it. And so they were there, but they are not available for others who want to buy tokens. So this will then have market price.
00:06:36.000 - 00:07:11.558, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. So you could say that people might have some private utility for those tokens just to hold it, or maybe they can buy another asset, which would be an extra mechanism. Okay, so I think we covered some hyperbounders and assumptions. And what about some parameters? So what about some things that we observe over the system and are out of our control? I think we haven't. Yeah. So the token price is probably one of the most important ones here, I guess.
00:07:11.558 - 00:07:13.126, Speaker A: Still, something I was thinking about in.
00:07:13.148 - 00:07:35.502, Speaker F: Terms of equilibrium is that if you have, let's say a whale, or if you had an individual whale, or if you had agents that were acting as a consortium, then one equilibrium at the ending is that, yeah, there's a massive majority, whatever, like 80% or something of the tokens end up in one buying group or controlling group, however you want to call that.
00:07:35.636 - 00:07:50.098, Speaker A: Okay, so maybe you want to define separate groups of users and then observe how skewed the distribution of the token is. Right. And you'd rather have it more uniform than it could be, because to put.
00:07:50.104 - 00:08:06.870, Speaker F: It into a concrete example, you mentioned news, or let's say forecasting on news. So it could be in the interest of a group to come in and simply own that market, and then they're able to have an overwhelming influence, which is against the mechanism of that ecosystem.
00:08:07.390 - 00:08:08.540, Speaker A: Yeah, makes sense.
00:08:12.430 - 00:08:40.980, Speaker C: I think that one parameter is of course the actual value of the network. So how the activity within the network, and also because of course, let's say in a prediction market activity also depends on the question to bet on and how relevant this is for the total number of contributors or agents.
00:08:42.150 - 00:09:29.602, Speaker A: Yeah, that's an interesting point. And something to add here is that when we think about the total value of the network, that is very likely to scale with what we assume the budget of the users is, but also to scale with what we assume users utility, like you mentioned, of the token is. Right. And that's again something where the hyperparameter will heavily affect the outcome. Right. If we assume that all users have high private utility for the tokens, then obviously they would be more likely to buy them in the first place, and then possibly more likely to hold them and so on. So when we talk about the total value of the network, we must remember that there will be some hyperparameters which would just increase that there.
00:09:29.602 - 00:09:37.400, Speaker A: We should probably talk about trends rather than absolute values of hyperparameters that affect them.
00:09:38.890 - 00:10:21.298, Speaker F: And one last thought, I'm not sure exactly how you would encode this, but as an unknown outcome, we haven't talked about the environment. Most of these things that we're talking about are for ethereum blockchain. So if we have, I don't know, whatever the next cryptokitties is, you can have too much noise in the environment for people to participate. If there is some kind of epoch that could disrupt people being able to participate. And additionally, if we were to think about a golem, maybe it simply is too expensive to do what they want to do. Maybe for live peer, it's simply too expensive to do video encoding in such a network. And instead, I don't know, they have their little video encoder in a box that they have at home or something.
00:10:21.384 - 00:10:43.660, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. A bonding curve, as we said, is just a mechanism for distributing tokens. So it would never really live on its own, but it would be kind of a backbone of some network that does something like a golem could use it, or some other system that uses that native token. So like you said, there will be always stuff kind of on top of it.
00:10:44.670 - 00:11:07.140, Speaker G: I was just wondering, in terms of stabilizing a token, then we've seen a lot of problems in the past. Is there any way in a system that you could have an underwriting for a token, so you're at a certain price, that it's more going back to supply and demand, and actually what underwriters do is staking for a token and making sure the price does not tank, or people are just not manipulating the price.
00:11:07.750 - 00:11:20.562, Speaker A: Yeah, so that could be like an extra mechanism that we introduce kind of along our bonding curve, for example, and we could. Sorry. Yeah, okay.
00:11:20.616 - 00:11:48.026, Speaker G: And then I've got gray hair and I'm ancient and I've got wrinkles. So I'm going to ask you a question. Now that I've been dying and I haven't had the answer from anybody, why do you use a bonding curve? What's happened to supply and demand. I mean, if you're starting to have a bid and offer on a bonding curve, well, that sounds to me like it's supply and demand. So how does that play? Sorry, I had to ask him on that. You see what I'm saying? I mean, you're talking about a bottom price for a supply and a demand curve. I mean, that's supply and demand.
00:11:48.026 - 00:11:50.734, Speaker G: It's not a bonding curve anymore, is it?
00:11:50.852 - 00:11:55.074, Speaker F: If you're able to mint or not mint, make more tokens for that, then.
00:11:55.112 - 00:11:57.406, Speaker A: What is it you're able to mint.
00:11:57.438 - 00:12:04.420, Speaker G: But you have to have an incentive. So your incentive is the price, which is a factor of demand and supply. Right?
00:12:06.890 - 00:12:11.080, Speaker A: Okay. Yes and no.
00:12:12.010 - 00:12:13.960, Speaker G: I'm still having a problem with that.
00:12:14.970 - 00:12:16.440, Speaker E: Repeat the question again.
00:12:17.370 - 00:12:40.906, Speaker G: The question really is we're talking about bonding curves. And there we've just talked about a bonding curve that has a bottom and it has a top. So it basically has a supply and a demand. And so I'm asking, why does the crypto world insist on calling these things bonding curve and just not go back to supply and demand? Because when you make a market, it's supply and demand, isn't it? And you guys want to make a market. So I don't stand the bonding curve.
00:12:40.938 - 00:12:41.920, Speaker A: Just one more question.
00:12:43.730 - 00:12:45.406, Speaker G: It is an automated market maker.
00:12:45.438 - 00:12:46.050, Speaker A: I agree.
00:12:46.200 - 00:12:50.580, Speaker G: But then you have to be able to show supply. You have to have a bid in an offer, don't you?
00:12:52.950 - 00:13:05.320, Speaker E: Well, what this tries to do is to not have to have market makers. So you're actually bidding an offering to the contract, not rather than to a counterparty. So the contract, right.
00:13:08.570 - 00:13:31.710, Speaker A: Yeah. How I like to think about it is that. Okay, let's see. I want to create something on the blockchain and I want people to be able to buy and sell the token from me. Right. And then I'm going to specify, all right, I've come up with this way of saying that depending on the number of tokens in circulation, that's the price I'm going to pick.
00:13:31.780 - 00:13:32.014, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:32.052 - 00:13:54.040, Speaker A: And that's kind of my design. And now we want to kind of evaluate that design. But all this does is specifies some mechanism of distributing the token, like you said, like market making. I'm not sure if there's any philosophy, but. Yeah, okay, maybe we can. Yeah.
00:13:57.930 - 00:14:27.470, Speaker B: How do you put the risk preferences into the system? Because obviously it's a system where you can buy in very cheap in the beginning. And that means there could be a hype. People run into this asset or into this token, but as soon as it starts declining the risk preferences decides if there is something like a run on the token, and everyone tries to be the first that gets out and not the last. So this is associated with risk preference.
00:14:29.650 - 00:16:03.200, Speaker A: So risk preferences in general, they're very important for many projects, like for instance, when you're talking about insurance, because insurance is kind of run by our risk preferences. So one easy kind of way to encode it would be to say that most agents would always prefer to incur a small continuous cost in small chunks, rather than be exposed to your risk of the one big hit, even if in the former case, their expectation of their output is lower. So that's one way to encode it, right? But there are other aspects from behavioral economics, for example, that people care more about losses than they do about winnings, right? That there's more emotional response connected with losing $100 than winning $120, actually, because we're more kind of wired that way. And all these things would be part of the kind of objective function. So in your case, the agent might have some of their own idea of what the utility of the token is, and it could also change its idea for the value of the token based on what's happening as well, right. And that's something we might see at the very, very end. So it's all kind of baked into the objective function.
00:16:03.200 - 00:16:40.110, Speaker A: I think we've pretty much covered this. Your ideas were way more detailed than this simulation is going to be. Not all these things have been covered. So the simulation setup is the following. I call the native token the asset token, and then the token that kind of everyone has is like eth is the reference token. So asset token is the one that you buy from the bonding curve. Smart contract, using the reference token to enter the system.
00:16:40.110 - 00:17:17.240, Speaker A: And we would define some budget constraints for the agents, and we also define objectives for the agents. And in this simulation, the objective will be fairly simple, is for the agents to make as much money as possible in the long run. So that's what the agents care about. They're kind of greedy in that sense. And the possible actions, again, is very simple. Agents can do nothing or can buy from the contract or can sell to the contract. Those were the components that they would use to build up their strategy, that would optimize for their objective function, which is to make as much money as possible.
00:17:17.240 - 00:18:05.334, Speaker A: In some scenarios, what you can do is to use heuristics based agents. So those are the agents whose actions are actually defined by some simple rules. So something like price goes up, sell price goes down, buy and those are sometimes useful to kind of create the sort of background for the simulation. But in most cases, kind of the most important part is the machine learning based agents. And those would be like the key part of each simulation. So those are the agents who observe the environment, observe the possible actions, and given their budget constraints, they come up with a strategy that maximizes their objectives, so allows them to make as much money as possible in the long run and in terms of the simulation output. So the parameters that we observe and that we care about.
00:18:05.334 - 00:18:41.634, Speaker A: Yeah, like you said, that would be the evolution of the price. That feels like it's very important. And that would also include the price volatility. Right. So something that we might want to look at and we might also care about kind of agent strategies. So the great thing about using this software is that you can actually kind of look inside agents heads and really understand the decisions that they were making and see the kind of motivation behind particular decisions. So these are the graphs that we're going to be looking at.
00:18:41.634 - 00:18:44.622, Speaker A: And this is the evolution of the price of the token.
00:18:44.686 - 00:18:44.962, Speaker D: Right?
00:18:45.016 - 00:19:15.114, Speaker A: So on the y axis we have the price, on the x axis we have time, and this is the evolution of the price. So again, not to be confused with the bonding curve. The bonding curve just specifies the rules of how you interact with the bonding curve. Smart contract. And this is what actually happened in the simulation. And I marked here some interesting events. So for instance, here agent 18 bought 100 asset tokens here very early on.
00:19:15.114 - 00:20:07.406, Speaker A: And this is relatively high volume. And then what we observe is that agent 18 sold 70 here, bought 50 here, sold 60 here, sold 60 here. And each time agent 18 pretty much did something, it was a high volume transaction, which caused a large move in the price of the token. So what we observed first of all is that early on we can see the price going up and then reaching this level of roughly 50,000. And again, this level of roughly 50,000 would be kind of the kind of average approximation of average, like utility agents have for this token. But when this level is reached, there is quite a bit of oscillation going on around it. And that's because we have this one agent who has quite a bit of power to move the price up and down on the market.
00:20:07.406 - 00:21:17.822, Speaker A: So that kind of tells us something about the initial distribution of the token being quite skewed, which means that there is like one party or one agent that has a lot of power in the market. And then a different example is here, where we have several agents who early on bought smaller amounts and what we see is that the overall behavior is similar. So again, the price reaches roughly the same point and oscillates there, but the oscillations are much smaller because there's no kind of one entity that has a lot of power in the market to move the price up and down. Okay, so now we're going to look at some of particular agent strategies to be able to understand the particular decisions made by the agents. So we're going to take an example of, first of all, this agent 18, who bought 100 tokens here and decided to hold them up until this point, and at this point sold 70. So this is what describes the kind of thinking process of the agent. So we can see that at timestamp 101, these are the top three actions that the agent considered.
00:21:17.822 - 00:22:08.790, Speaker A: These three, and these are the approximate kind of scores that the agent associated with them. We can see the highest score was associated with this one, which it chose. But what you also see is the subsequent action. The agent kind of was planning to follow up, to follow this one, to follow up with this one. So it's not to say that the agent necessarily would choose that action on the next occasion, because in the meantime, the environment change, might choose something else. But at this point in time, on timestamp one, one, that sort of strategy seemed the best for the agent, and we can see that it indeed chose to sell 70. But the second best strategy, as we can see, was actually to buy five more, so not to exit anymore, and presumably hope that some other agents will follow and some more agents will buy in.
00:22:08.790 - 00:22:58.626, Speaker A: The price will go further up, and then you go and sell almost all your tokens, so even more than here. And that strategy seemed to be almost as good as the one with selling immediately. So here, a bit more risky, hoping that price would go up a bit more. And now, as another example, we will look at this agent 16, who bought 40 tokens here and held them all the way until timestamp roughly 200, and only at that point decided to sell them. And we're going to be able to see how the agent make decisions along the way to finally decide to sell them here. So at timestamp, timestamp seven. So very early on, when the price was 36,000, so pretty low, we can see that the agent didn't really consider selling very seriously.
00:22:58.626 - 00:24:08.620, Speaker A: We can see that those two actions dominate and have much higher score, although the agent does potentially consider selling later on. However, when it comes to timestamp 86 and the price is now 48,000, we can see that now the decision is much closer. So the agent is much less confident and the scores are close, but he does decide to buy one more token, which is essentially to wait and only sell afterwards. But the second best action is to start selling already and then sell even more later on. But the score is slightly lower. But then even later on where the price got as high as 55,000, then eventually the top action was to sell 40 and the agent was, well, fairly confident, then that's the best action to take. So the key findings from this simulation were that what we've observed is the asset token price would, across kind of all scenarios, go up to this level of around 50,000 and kind of stay there and oscillate around that level.
00:24:08.620 - 00:24:50.060, Speaker A: But the amount of the amplitude of oscillation seemed to be dependent on how uneven the initial distribution of the token is. So if the volatility of the price is something that you care about as the system designer, then you might want to introduce some measures into your system that make sure that it's difficult or impossible for particular agents to get a lot of tokens for themselves. For example, by introducing a limit on how many tokens you can buy early on a single agent. Okay, so that's it for this case study, and if there are any questions before we go to the next one.
00:25:00.210 - 00:25:09.662, Speaker F: For these simulations, each time step meant that every agent had the opportunity to make one choice, and that was always fair.
00:25:09.716 - 00:25:10.320, Speaker A: Correct?
00:25:10.770 - 00:25:14.900, Speaker F: As in every agent, every time step got to choose to do one thing.
00:25:16.390 - 00:25:35.720, Speaker A: The actual specifics of how the setup kind of vary. That's one way to do it, another way to do it, to have sample agents randomly on different timestamps. So different ways to do it, but kind of in the long run, on a long enough horizon, that shouldn't make a huge difference how that happens.
00:25:40.510 - 00:25:49.580, Speaker D: Just wondering, have you compared your key findings to any publicly available data?
00:25:51.570 - 00:26:16.260, Speaker A: So for this particular case, no, not really. So I don't think we have probably look into that, like cases where bonding curves were actually deployed and how that was done. I know that a lot of teams do spend a lot of time kind of planning the distribution of their tokens. So for example, to avoid situations like that. But, yeah, that's a good point.
00:26:20.950 - 00:26:35.100, Speaker D: It the agents have a concept of, or how did you model the concept of low price, high price for the agents? Do they have an absolute scale to compare to? Or do they only compare to their previous actions, what may or may not be a high price?
00:26:35.470 - 00:27:09.478, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's a good question. So essentially, if you're an agent, then you want to kind of choose actions that make you money. Right. But it is true that you can use different reference points. So you can either say that I start off where I am right now, and whatever money I make from now on is going to make me happy. But another way to look at it, which is potentially another of these non rationality behaviors, is that maybe where I am right now is also important.
00:27:09.564 - 00:27:09.862, Speaker G: Right.
00:27:09.916 - 00:27:20.854, Speaker A: Because maybe I got what people say about moving prices. Right. How I got here also makes a difference. Right. And this is another behavioral economics thing.
00:27:20.892 - 00:27:21.334, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:21.452 - 00:27:40.330, Speaker A: So this is something that can be also incorporated in the objective function is that if I got where I am by things getting better than my approach would be different if I got here by things getting worse. Righteous.
