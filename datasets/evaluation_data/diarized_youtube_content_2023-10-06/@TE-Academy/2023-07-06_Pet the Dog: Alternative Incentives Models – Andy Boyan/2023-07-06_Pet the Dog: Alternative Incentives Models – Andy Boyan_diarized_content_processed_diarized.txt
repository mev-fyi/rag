00:00:04.100 - 00:01:03.908, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Andy from Infinity Keys, and I wanted to bring a game to the TEC workshop that features other incentive models that can go alongside tokens. So I'm doing a talk earlier in the week about token incentive models versus game incentive models and how games kind of tap into these other incentives that don't require these extrinsic motivations, but rather they kind of bring something up inside that makes you want to complete them and finish them. So I would like to propose a game that's a really simple interface, and we'll see if we can get people to complete it at the workshop and beyond. And the game is basically this. There are a series of images, and the first image is a hand almost petting a dog. And when you complete a few different tasks, collecting some lens post, collecting a mirror post, doing some retweets, the next picture shows the hand getting closer to petting the dog. And after a few more of these, very few, probably three whole steps.
00:01:03.908 - 00:01:27.792, Speaker A: The final one is once you've completed all the tasks, then the hand pets the dog, and the dog has a very satisfied look on its face. And it's called pet the dog. That's the game is just pet the dog, do things so that the dog gets pet. And it's meant to be an example of an internal incentive. It's not a real dog, it's an image. It's not real petting. But the hypothesis is that people will want to pet the dog.
00:01:27.792 - 00:01:51.030, Speaker A: It feels good to accomplish something when it's at a low stake. So then the intent is to get people to think about what are some other gamification type experiences, game type experiences that we can add alongside token incentives to create more robust communities. Anyways, I'm Andy Boyne. My project is Infinity keys. You can check out some of our games at Infinity keys IO. I'm looking forward to being a part of this workshop, whether or not I get to do a game or not. Thank you.
