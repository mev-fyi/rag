00:00:07.530 - 00:00:43.020, Speaker A: So we gave you a wallet with a few east and PNK so you can import it into metamask. Keep in mind that you use for the workshop after if you want to move the east to a wallet to control, because that's the key that we generated. So otherwise we could steal your east if we were malicious. So don't put all your money into this wallet. Well, I'll do it, but you know what will happen. So let's look at dodge and trial. So let's import a key.
00:00:43.020 - 00:01:29.782, Speaker A: So here you have import a wallet while it's in French, but you should see the same. And you pass your private key here and it gets imported and you should get 6.5 cent of east and PNK in it. And if you haven't received the wallet, you can just do it with your own ease and you will get reimbursed if your image is accepted. So now we want to submit a dodge. Do I submit a dodge? No, I'm going to submit a cat. I'm malicious.
00:01:29.782 - 00:02:03.646, Speaker A: I want the two east. Which cat do we take? Well, this cat has a tie. That seems cute. So you have enough east to do one action. So you're going to choose if you want to submit a cat, submit a dodge, or if you want to challenge an image, preferably a cat. Otherwise you risk to lose your ease. So I'm going to put a cat here, you put the link to the image.
00:02:03.646 - 00:02:58.974, Speaker A: That can be something on Internet or that can be something that you have on your computer. And okay, I fucked up my copy and pass, I guess. Whoa. Not an image or the strange. Okay, I'm going to save it. It. Okay, so now I have the image and I have a deposit of east.
00:02:58.974 - 00:04:21.030, Speaker A: That's not the cost to add an image, that's the deposit. So this means that if no one challenges it, or if some people challenge it and I win, I will get this east refunded. So here it's a cat. So it's probably not going to win, especially because there is lots of people in this room being the crypto police. What happened? So it's going to take a bit of time before being mined. Can look at your scan. Wow.
00:04:21.030 - 00:05:29.656, Speaker A: Definitely need to put more gas because they say it's going to take 40 minutes. Way too much. You have a speed up button if you want to put more gas on your transaction. Okay, I'm going to put fast. Anyone has an issue to put an image, why did you put. No. Currently it's store centrally, but the ash is saved such that we could centrally like censor it.
00:05:29.656 - 00:05:34.250, Speaker A: But we could not fake it by putting other images because ashes would not match.
00:05:35.180 - 00:05:37.160, Speaker B: The picture gets deleted.
00:05:37.520 - 00:05:51.400, Speaker A: So that was just an experiment. But for other dap we're developing, we have ipfs to store the images and that's, I think, a better way to store images.
00:05:51.480 - 00:06:04.320, Speaker B: And I mean, picture is just like one kind of one block in the whole ecosystem. But you could provide evidence and all these materials in complex cases.
00:06:04.480 - 00:07:34.848, Speaker A: Yeah, everything that we develop now, we put in ipfs, but this one was done a lot of months before we started working with ipfs. But even with ipfs, there's still some unresolved issue, which is the speaker listener fault equivalence, which is that if you don't get an image, the blockchain cannot know if this image is unavailable, that the person who should have given the image to you hasn't, or if you're just lying. So we don't know if someone forgot to speak or if someone pretended not to hear. And that's a bit problematic because you could have people submitting images on ipfs, but actually never, I don't know if you call it seeding, but never seeding these images to other people so that people cannot know if the image is legit or not. And apparently it's quite complex problem, because even the Asian foundation has issue like that. And one potential solution will be to penalize both. So you put someone who is responsible of giving the data, and if the person which gets the data can prove it got the data, nothing bad happens.
00:07:34.848 - 00:08:26.050, Speaker A: But if this person cannot prove that they got the data, you penalize both. And you need to ask approved that they got the data, because otherwise, if they don't need to show a proof that they got the data, even if when they don't get the data, they will always say I got it, because otherwise they will be penalized when there is a fault. But this way they cannot pretend to have gotten the data when they haven't. So if they don't get the data, both are penalized. So both have to cooperate to get the data. But that's the best answer that you may have currently. So I hope other people are working on it, or perhaps slightly better solution on how to deal with people which will keep data and not see this data.
00:08:26.050 - 00:09:26.580, Speaker A: So here you see a cat, you see a dodge of dog. I guess that's a dodge version of bug. Anyone else managed to put a picture? Or is it just because it's taking time to mine? Okay, so I'm going to pretend I'm someone else and switch to another address. And I see a cat here. So I want to get a part of this deposit. So I'm going to send this cat to trial. And what happened? Well, I guess if I play both role that looks strange to metamask and I send this cat to trial.
00:09:26.580 - 00:10:10.330, Speaker A: Ten minutes. People are using ethereum today. I don't know why.
00:10:18.320 - 00:10:20.728, Speaker B: When you send to trial, you also have to pay the deposit.
00:10:20.824 - 00:11:06.810, Speaker A: You also put a deposit. And if the juror rules that this is a dodge, you're going to lose your deposit. Alpha to the jurors and alpha to the symmetre. So I'm going to put more gas. So if someone tried to challenge a cat, I'm front running you to get some cent of east back. If your transaction hasn't been mine, you can look at it on metamask and put speed up. So here there should be a speed up button.
00:11:06.810 - 00:11:10.760, Speaker A: Yeah, you should have a speed up button where you pay more gas.
00:11:11.500 - 00:11:13.770, Speaker B: Okay. Is the network under.
00:11:14.860 - 00:11:46.800, Speaker A: It's because lots of people are using it. So gas price need to be higher. Okay. So here I got it confirmed. And now we have this cat, which is a challenge. And next time it will be the time to vote. Juror will vote on those images.
00:11:46.800 - 00:12:06.664, Speaker A: So currently it's the time to vote on Claros. So you cannot deposit token currently, but in one or two days. I think it's today. Yeah, in two days it will be the time to. Oh, no. Okay, that's more. Yeah.
00:12:06.702 - 00:12:06.904, Speaker B: Okay.
00:12:06.942 - 00:12:49.650, Speaker A: At the end of the month it will be the time where you could deposit tokens again. So you've been given tokens, you won't be able to deposit them today, but you get 1000 PNK that you can use after the workshop if you want to be a drawer. We got more pictures. So for now, only real dodges. Did anyone put a cat? Raise your hand if you put a cat. No one put a cat. I was assuming this one is a cat.
00:12:49.650 - 00:13:35.096, Speaker A: This the one is what? Oh, this one? Yeah, it seems to be a dodge. I will not challenge it. Yeah, well, you can challenge it if you think it's a cat. So if anyone has some issue, you can raise your hand. I'm going to come to help. No, everyone's fine. And can any picture challenge be challenged at any time? Yeah, you challenge at any time and it gets put into the next voting period.
00:13:35.096 - 00:14:06.390, Speaker A: So currently it's already a voting period. So it's going to be put in half a week on the next version of kerose. We are going to streamline the cases so that you can have voting on one case at the point and another case in the added period. And so you don't have to wait for that because for now period are global. But next release, which is next month, payers will be dispute specific so you won't need to wait much.
