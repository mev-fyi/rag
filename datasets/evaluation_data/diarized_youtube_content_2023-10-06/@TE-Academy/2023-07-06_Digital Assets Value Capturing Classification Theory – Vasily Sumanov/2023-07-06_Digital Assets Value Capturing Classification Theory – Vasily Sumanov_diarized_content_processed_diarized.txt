00:00:06.260 - 00:00:15.000, Speaker B: My name is Anthony, and today I'm speaking with Vasili about his upcoming talk at the token engineering bar camp at EFCC week. Paris. Avasili.
00:00:15.740 - 00:00:52.656, Speaker A: Yeah. Hi Anthony. Hi everybody. So my upcoming talk is devoted to the digital assets value capturing classification theory. So I'm a token engineer and head of research in purple protocol. So I'm also a, like a DeFi scientist, I explored a lot of token models, made simulations, dig deep into the projects and found a lot of economic similarities and stuff that led as a foundation to my classification framework. Finally, since we need to understand economic value behind tokens much better than we can now, so I designed it and I'm ready to deliver this small pitch.
00:00:52.656 - 00:00:55.184, Speaker A: So Antonio, let's get started, let's get started.
00:00:55.242 - 00:01:00.616, Speaker B: It sounds really interesting. Can you give us some highlights about your theory? What's that all about?
00:01:00.718 - 00:01:49.784, Speaker A: Yes, of course. So it's all about understanding the value networks and coordination value inside them, how the agents produce this value, and what is the result of all this coordination. So finally, it's going to the origins of value that are elementary economic patterns that are results of discordination, value capture mechanisms that are combination of origins of value and value capture implementation patterns that are particular code implementations. So it's a three Iraq classification. So we have origins of value, value capture mechanisms as interaction of this origins of value inside one token model, and value capture implementation patterns as particular code implementation. As I said before, so we can refer to the GRS and bike chain as the end product, and we have described all the value capturing mechanisms there. So it's quite interesting.
00:01:49.982 - 00:01:57.620, Speaker B: That seems really interesting. Well, what sort of value can your theory bring to token engineers? How can it be applied?
00:01:57.780 - 00:02:04.660, Speaker A: Yes, so token engineers can decompose existing token models and understand the economic value behind them and create new utility tokens. See you on bearcamp.
