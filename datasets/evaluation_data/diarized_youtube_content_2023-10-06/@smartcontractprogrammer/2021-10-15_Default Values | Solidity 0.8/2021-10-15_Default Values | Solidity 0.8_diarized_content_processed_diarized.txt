00:00:00.490 - 00:00:30.706, Speaker A: State variables and local variables in solidity have a default value. If you don't assign a value to a variable, then that variable will have a default value. Let's take a look at default values for some of the variables here. I'm going to create some state variables. We'll compile the contract and then deploy it and actually see what the default values are. So to start off with I'll create a state variable for boolean. The default value for a Boolean data type is false.
00:00:30.706 - 00:01:09.700, Speaker A: I'll create a state variable. So I'll declare boolean public and name this state variable b. And to remind you I'll comment that the default value for the boolean is false. The default value for un is zero. I'll create a un state variable so un public and then name it u put a comment here saying that the default value for un is zero. The default value for int type is also zero. I'll name this variable I and put a comment here to remind you that the default value for int is zero.
00:01:09.700 - 00:01:41.270, Speaker A: The default value for address is the zero address. I'll name this variable a and what does the zero address look like? The zero address looks like this. It is a sequence of 40 zeros. The default value for bytes 32 is similar to address. I'll name this variable b 32. The default value is a 32 byte hexadecimal representation of zero. And it looks like this.
00:01:41.270 - 00:02:13.400, Speaker A: It's a sequence of 64 zeros. Okay, let's compile the contract, deploy it, and I'll actually show you the default values in remix. So I'll hit ctrl s to compile it and then deploy the contract. Scroll down, expand the contract, and you can see here that we have the state variables that we declared over here. Let's take a look at what these values are. So a is for address. What is the default of address? It is the zero address.
00:02:13.400 - 00:02:39.050, Speaker A: How about for Boolean it's false. And for bytes 32 it's a sequence of 64 zeros. And for int is zero. And for un it's also zero. Now there are defaults for mapping structs, enums and fixed sized arrays. And I'll show you the default values for each of these data types when I introduce these data types.
