00:00:00.330 - 00:00:01.966, Speaker A: In the previous video, we found out.
00:00:01.988 - 00:00:06.174, Speaker B: That to find the fee growth between two ticks I lower and iupper, we.
00:00:06.212 - 00:00:24.046, Speaker A: Can use this equation. The current fee growth minus Fb minus fa, where Fb tracks the length of these red rectangles below tick lower and fa tracks the length of these red rectangles above tick upper. In this video, we'll look at some simple examples that will give us an.
00:00:24.068 - 00:00:26.338, Speaker B: Idea of how to track Fb.
00:00:26.514 - 00:00:55.150, Speaker A: Okay, so let's start with some definitions and a simple example. To find Fb, we'll define f of Gt to equal fee growth at time t for token y, and fb will define this to be fee growth below tick I for token y. So here's a simple example and we want to find what Fb is. So let's take a look at this example. The fee growth starts from zero. And let's say at some time t goes zero, the fee growth crosses over some tick I.
00:00:55.300 - 00:00:59.534, Speaker B: At this point, the height of this fee growth. We'll label it f of g of.
00:00:59.572 - 00:01:04.538, Speaker A: Zero and after it crosses over, it keeps increasing. And let's say that the current fee.
00:01:04.554 - 00:01:06.454, Speaker B: Growth is equal to Fg.
00:01:06.602 - 00:01:08.306, Speaker A: So in this case, what would be.
00:01:08.328 - 00:01:10.030, Speaker B: The value of fb?
00:01:10.190 - 00:01:12.814, Speaker A: Again, let's go back to the definition of fb.
00:01:12.862 - 00:01:28.086, Speaker B: We said that this is equal to the fee growth below tick I. For token y, here's tick I. And what is the fee growth below this tick I? Well, here I've highlighted the fee growth below tick I. So the fee growth below tick I.
00:01:28.188 - 00:01:33.346, Speaker A: Will be the height of this red rectangle. In this case, since the tick crossed.
00:01:33.378 - 00:01:37.738, Speaker B: That f of geo zero, fb will be equal to f of geo zero.
00:01:37.904 - 00:01:39.226, Speaker A: This is the height at which the.
00:01:39.248 - 00:01:41.934, Speaker B: Fee growth crossed over tick I.
00:01:42.052 - 00:01:45.994, Speaker A: Let's look at another example. Let's say that after time t equals.
00:01:46.042 - 00:01:48.334, Speaker B: Zero, where the fee growth crossed over.
00:01:48.372 - 00:01:51.214, Speaker A: Tick I after some time later, it.
00:01:51.252 - 00:01:53.706, Speaker B: Crossed back below tick I, the fee.
00:01:53.738 - 00:02:02.338, Speaker A: Growth at the time that it went below tick I. We'll label this f of g one. And let's say that the current fee growth is somewhere over here.
00:02:02.424 - 00:02:04.382, Speaker B: I've labeled this as Fg.
00:02:04.526 - 00:02:08.278, Speaker A: And again, let's ask the question. What is fee growth below tick I?
00:02:08.364 - 00:02:17.266, Speaker B: Fb? What would this be equal to? Well, previously we said that fb is equal to f of g zero. F of g zero is the height.
00:02:17.298 - 00:02:21.642, Speaker A: Of this red rectangle. Okay, so this is the previous fee growth in red.
00:02:21.696 - 00:02:23.382, Speaker B: I've highlighted the part of phi growth.
00:02:23.446 - 00:02:27.514, Speaker A: Below tick I since it crossed below at f of g one.
00:02:27.632 - 00:02:29.770, Speaker B: So the previous fee growth below was.
00:02:29.840 - 00:02:40.014, Speaker A: The height of this rectangle. The new fee growth below tickai will be the height of this rectangle plus the height of this rectangle. The height of the previous rectangle is.
00:02:40.052 - 00:02:42.302, Speaker B: This, which is equal to f of g zero.
00:02:42.436 - 00:03:02.754, Speaker A: And to this, we need to add the height of this rectangle. So what is the height of this rectangle? Well, we know that the starting position of this rectangle is f o g of one, and the current phi growth is fog. So if we do fog minus f of g one, we get this height of this small rectangle. So, to get the current fee growth.
00:03:02.802 - 00:03:07.398, Speaker B: Below tick I, f of b to the previous fee growth below f of.
00:03:07.404 - 00:03:09.714, Speaker A: G zero, we add this new height.
00:03:09.762 - 00:03:11.114, Speaker B: Over here, which will be f of.
00:03:11.152 - 00:03:17.610, Speaker A: G minus f of g of one. Okay, let's say that some time has passed and the current fee growth has.
00:03:17.680 - 00:03:20.694, Speaker B: Crossed above tick I, the fee growth.
00:03:20.742 - 00:03:22.170, Speaker A: When it crossed tick I.
00:03:22.240 - 00:03:24.254, Speaker B: We'll label this as f of g.
00:03:24.292 - 00:03:26.634, Speaker A: Of two, and our current fee growth.
00:03:26.682 - 00:03:28.190, Speaker B: Will be somewhere over here.
00:03:28.340 - 00:03:30.414, Speaker A: Okay, and let's ask the question again.
00:03:30.532 - 00:03:34.058, Speaker B: What is f of B? Well, previously, f of b was equal.
00:03:34.074 - 00:03:37.566, Speaker A: To this equation, which I've copied over here.
00:03:37.668 - 00:03:39.826, Speaker B: To find the fee growth below, what.
00:03:39.848 - 00:03:46.526, Speaker A: We need to do is add up the height of these red rectangles. The first one is easy. We know that this one is equal.
00:03:46.558 - 00:03:47.826, Speaker B: To f of g zero.
00:03:48.008 - 00:03:53.766, Speaker A: So how about this one? How did it change from the previous example? In the previous example, we said that.
00:03:53.788 - 00:03:55.446, Speaker B: The height of this is f of.
00:03:55.468 - 00:03:58.502, Speaker A: G minus f of g of one. But how about now?
00:03:58.556 - 00:04:00.214, Speaker B: What would this height be?
00:04:00.332 - 00:04:08.266, Speaker A: Well, we know that the starting height is f of g of one, and the ending height is f of g o two. So the height of this rectangle will.
00:04:08.288 - 00:04:10.026, Speaker B: Be equal to f of g o.
00:04:10.048 - 00:04:18.954, Speaker A: Two minus f of g one. This is the height of this rectangle, and this is the fee growth below tick I when the current fee growth.
00:04:19.002 - 00:04:21.454, Speaker B: Fog is above tick I.
00:04:21.572 - 00:04:23.418, Speaker A: Okay, let's look at two more examples.
00:04:23.514 - 00:04:25.434, Speaker B: Previously, we had the fee growth above.
00:04:25.482 - 00:04:29.662, Speaker A: Tick I, and let's say that some time has passed and the fee growth.
00:04:29.726 - 00:04:31.250, Speaker B: Crossed below tick I.
00:04:31.320 - 00:04:33.186, Speaker A: And our current fee growth, which you.
00:04:33.208 - 00:04:41.942, Speaker B: See over here, is below tick I, the point at which fee growth crossed below tick I. We'll label this height as f of g of three.
00:04:42.076 - 00:04:44.630, Speaker A: Okay, so again, let's ask the question.
00:04:44.780 - 00:04:47.398, Speaker B: How has phi growth below tick I?
00:04:47.484 - 00:04:51.174, Speaker A: How has it changed? Well, to this equation, we'll highlight the.
00:04:51.212 - 00:04:53.030, Speaker B: Part of phi growth that is below.
00:04:53.100 - 00:05:14.330, Speaker A: Tick I in a red rectangle. Measure the height, and then add the height to here. So here's the rectangle that represents phi growth below tikai. And what is the height of this rectangle? Well, the height of this rectangle is fg minus f of g of three. So, to this equation, we add this height, which is equal to fg minus.
00:05:14.410 - 00:05:15.678, Speaker B: F of g of three.
00:05:15.844 - 00:05:22.258, Speaker A: Okay. Last example, let's say that the fee growth crossed above tick I again. So the current fee growth will be over here.
00:05:22.344 - 00:05:23.486, Speaker B: Let's say that the height of fee.
00:05:23.518 - 00:05:26.370, Speaker A: Growth when it last crossed above tick I.
00:05:26.440 - 00:05:28.710, Speaker B: Let's label this as fog of four.
00:05:28.780 - 00:05:31.794, Speaker A: So again, let's ask the question, what is fb?
00:05:31.922 - 00:05:34.406, Speaker B: What is the fee growth below tick I?
00:05:34.508 - 00:05:36.278, Speaker A: Again, what we're doing is highlighting the.
00:05:36.284 - 00:05:40.154, Speaker B: Parts of phi growth that is below tick I, which you see over here.
00:05:40.272 - 00:05:55.310, Speaker A: And then adding up the height of these red rectangles previously. In this example, the phi growth below was this equation. What do we need to do to this equation to get the current phi growth below? Well, we know from the previous example.
00:05:55.380 - 00:05:57.630, Speaker B: That the height of this last red.
00:05:57.700 - 00:06:01.694, Speaker A: Rectangle was fg minus fog three, which.
00:06:01.732 - 00:06:03.134, Speaker B: We see over here.
00:06:03.252 - 00:06:24.342, Speaker A: So how do we need to update this to match the current phi growth below? Well, let's take a look at this red rectangle. The height of this red rectangle is fog of four minus fog three. So all we need to do to update this equation is to update this term. Change f of g to f of g of four minus f o g of three.
00:06:24.476 - 00:06:26.134, Speaker B: This is the height of this red.
00:06:26.172 - 00:06:28.406, Speaker A: Rectangle, and this is the equation for.
00:06:28.428 - 00:06:30.198, Speaker B: The phi growth below tick I.
00:06:30.284 - 00:06:31.926, Speaker A: When the current phi growth f of.
00:06:31.948 - 00:06:34.102, Speaker B: G is above the tick I.
00:06:34.236 - 00:06:46.330, Speaker A: All we did to get this equation is we assumed that phi growth started below the current tick I, and then every time it crossed over, we calculate the height of this red rectangle and then add it to fob.
