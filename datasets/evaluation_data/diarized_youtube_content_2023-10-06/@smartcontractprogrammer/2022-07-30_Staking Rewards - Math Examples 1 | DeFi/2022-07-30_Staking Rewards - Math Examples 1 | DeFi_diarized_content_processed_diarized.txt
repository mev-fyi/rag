00:00:00.250 - 00:00:41.286, Speaker A: Let's go through an example of how many rewards a user earns by using this equation. For this example, we'll say that Alice stakes 100 tokens for 3 seconds. And using this formula, we'll calculate how many rewards earned by Alice on a graph. The y axis represents the total stake and the xaxis represents time in seconds. Let's say that at 3 seconds, Alice stakes 100 tokens, and then at six, 6th, 2nd, she withdraws all of her tokens. So in total she staked 100 tokens for the duration of 3 seconds. Let's calculate how many rewards Alice has earned in this 3 seconds and we'll be using this equation to calculate how many rewards Alice has earned.
00:00:41.286 - 00:01:09.270, Speaker A: At 3 seconds, Alice had 100 shares, so that will be 100. The total stake by all users is also 100. This will be just Alice. We times this by the reward rate per seconds r, and that is the amount of rewards that Alice has earned from 3 seconds to 4 seconds. From 4 seconds to 5 seconds. The amount of tokens staked by Alice is also 100. The total staked by all users is just Alice.
00:01:09.270 - 00:01:44.942, Speaker A: So this will be again be 100, and the reward rate will be still be r. So that will be the amount of rewards earned by Alice from four to 5 seconds. And lastly from seconds five to six again, the amount staked by Alice is still 100 and the total is also 100. So that will be 100 over 100 multiplied by r. We add all of these terms up and this is equal to three r. 100 over 100 times r is just simply r. Again for the second term, 100 over 100 is one.
00:01:44.942 - 00:02:13.926, Speaker A: One times r is r and the same for the last term. Adding three r's, we get three r. So three r is the amount of rewards that Alice gets for staking 100 token for 3 seconds. Let's look at another example. Alice Stakes 100 tokens for 4 seconds and Bob stakes 200 tokens for 5 seconds. Let's calculate how many rewards are earned by Alice. Here is the graph showing how much tokens were staked by each user and the duration they were staked for.
00:02:13.926 - 00:02:52.226, Speaker A: At 3 seconds, Alice Stakes 100 token at 5 seconds, Bob Stakes 200 tokens, and at seven second, Alice withdrawals the 100 token. And at ten second, Bob withdrawals his 200 tokens. Let's calculate how much rewards are earned by Alice at 3 seconds. Alice had 100 tokens staked, so that will be 100. The total amount staked at 3 seconds is also 100, so that will be 100 over 100. We times this percentage by the reward rates per second, so that will be by timing it by r. That's the amount of rewards earned by Alice for 1 second from seconds three to four.
00:02:52.226 - 00:03:29.360, Speaker A: At 4 seconds, the amount of rewards staked by Alice is also 100, and the total staked is also 100. Again, we multiply this by r. So between 4 seconds and 5 seconds, Alice has earned 100 over 100 times our amount of tokens. However, at 5 seconds, the amount of staked by Alice is still the same 100. So that will be 100 over the total staked by all users. At 5 seconds, Bob stakes 200 100 plus 200 is 300. So the total staked is 300 times this by the reward rate per seconds r.
00:03:29.360 - 00:03:53.334, Speaker A: And that is the amount earned by Alice at 5 seconds. At 6 seconds, Alice still has 100 staked. The total staked by all users, Alice and Bob are still 300. So we add another 100 over 300 multiplied by r. At 7 seconds, Alice withdrawals so she is no longer earning any rewards. So this is the total amount earned by Alice. Let's now simplify this.
00:03:53.334 - 00:04:27.806, Speaker A: This is equal to 100 over 100 simplifies to one, and the same goes for the second term. 100 over 300 simplifies to one over three, so this will be one over three. And the last term, 100 over 300 again simplifies to one over three. Let's add all of these up. The first two terms will be r plus r, so that will be two r plus the last two terms are one over three r, plus one over three r. So that will be two of those. So this will be two over three r.
00:04:27.806 - 00:04:59.410, Speaker A: Let's simplify this one more step. Two r is equal to six over three r. Six over three r plus two over three r is eight over three r. So the amount of rewards earned by Alice first taking 100 token from seconds three to seven is eight over three r. Those were two examples of calculating the amount of rewards earned by a user using this equation. In the next video, we'll go over an example of calculating the amounts of rewards earned by a user using this equation. Bye.
