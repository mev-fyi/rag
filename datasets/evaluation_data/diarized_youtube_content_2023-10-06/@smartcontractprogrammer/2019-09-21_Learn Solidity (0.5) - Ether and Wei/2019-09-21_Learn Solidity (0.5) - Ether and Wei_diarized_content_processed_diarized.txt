00:00:00.810 - 00:00:46.426, Speaker A: When you deploy a contract or create a transaction in remix, you'll see words like ether and wei in account balance and transaction logs. What are they? In this video I'll explain what ether is and some common units of ether, Ether, way and wei. Similar to how the currency of us is dollar, the currency used within Ethereum is ether. Ether is used to pay block rewards, pay for transaction fees, and you can also transfer it between accounts. The smallest unit of ether is way, and one ether is equal to ten to the 18 way. Here's a complete list of units, and you can use way, sabo, Finney, and ether in solidity, but we'll focus on the more commonly used ones way and ether. Let's go through an example.
00:00:46.426 - 00:01:27.750, Speaker A: Here we have our contract. Inside the contract, there's a variable set to one way and another variable set to one ether units can only be added after literal numbers. For example, one ether is a ballot code, but you won't be able to write x ether, where x is some number variable. The only effect of appending a unit to a number is a multiplication by a power of ten. So one way is the same as multiplying one by ten to the zero, which is simply just one, and one ether is equal to multiplying one by ten to the 18. 1st compile and deploy the contract. Call the function one way and you can see here that it returned one.
00:01:27.750 - 00:02:09.686, Speaker A: Next, call one ether and you can see here that it returned a big number. This number should be ten to the 18, but it's kind of tedious to count the number of zeros, so we'll let solidity check it for us. Back in our code we have a function named test one ether. Inside this function, we check that one ether is equal to ten to the 18 way. We have already seen that a way is equal to one, so this function returns true if one ether is equal to the number ten to the 18 and returns false. Otherwise, under our deployed contract, hit the test one ether button and the function returns true, just as we expected. GuI stands for gigaway and it is equal to 1 billion way.
00:02:09.686 - 00:02:44.538, Speaker A: The most common situation where you would see the word guay is when you submit a transaction to the blockchain for the transaction fee. Guay is used to set the gas price. Gas and gas price are the topics of the next video. So for now, all you need to know is that guay is equal to 1 billion way and you see it with transactions. For example, open your favorite browser and visit Etherscan IO and click on any transaction. Scroll down, click on the transaction detail, and you can see here that the gas price was set in GUI. Ether is the currency of Ethereum.
00:02:44.538 - 00:02:52.380, Speaker A: One ether is ten to the 18 way. One GUI is 1 billion way, and you see it often in transactions. I'll see you in the next video.
