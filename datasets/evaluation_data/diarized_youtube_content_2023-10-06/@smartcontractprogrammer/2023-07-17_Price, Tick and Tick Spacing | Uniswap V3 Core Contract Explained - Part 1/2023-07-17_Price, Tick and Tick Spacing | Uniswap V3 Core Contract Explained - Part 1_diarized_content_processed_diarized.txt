00:00:00.330 - 00:00:32.230, Speaker A: What is price tick and tick spacing? Let's start with price. Let's say that x is equal to some amount of token zero and y is equal to the amount of token one. And we'll say that p is equal to the price of x in terms of y. This is equal to the ratio of the two tokens y divided by x. This is the equation for the price in uniswap b two. But this is also a useful equation to remember for uniswap b three. However, in unison B three, the way the price is calculated is by this equation, p is equal to 1.1
00:00:32.230 - 00:01:09.858, Speaker A: raised to some tick in unison b two, the price is calculated by the amount of token zero and the amount of token one inside the pool. However, inside unison b three. To calculate the amount of tokens inside the pool, you'll need to know three things, the liquidity, the price range, and the current price. Once you know all three of these, then the amount of tokens can be calculated in a given price range. Let's look at an example of price and tick. Here is the current tick that I got for e USDC pool from arbitrum. And using the equation that I just explained, the price will be equal to 1.1
00:01:09.858 - 00:01:42.714, Speaker A: raised to this tick. Let's see what this number turns out to be. So I'll execute this python code and I get a small number over here. 1.927 raised to the power of ten to the minus nine. I expect the current price of ETH to USDC to be around 1924. So how can we fix this number to be that number? To do that, we'll have to multiply by the token decimals inside this pool, token zero is e, so it has 18 decimals and token one is USDC.
00:01:42.714 - 00:02:19.666, Speaker A: This has six decimals. To put this price back into 1924, what we will do is multiply this p by decimal zero and then divide it by decimals one. Let's execute this python code again and we get that the current price of ETH to USDC is 1924. So that was an example of price and tick. What about tick spacing? What is it? Tick spacing is the number of ticks to skip when the price moves. Every time there's a swap, the price moves. The price can either increase or decrease in steps of tick spacing.
00:02:19.666 - 00:02:55.110, Speaker A: For example, let's say that the tick spacing is equal to two. Let's also say that the current tick is equal to zero and then the price increases. Since the tick spacing is equal to two, the next tick will be two let's say that the price increases again the tick spacing is equal to two so the next tick can only be four. Let me give you another example. Let's again say that the price is over here tick is equal to zero and the price decreases. The tick spacing is equal to two, so the next tick can only be equal to minus two. And if the price decreases again the next tick will be minus four.
00:02:55.110 - 00:02:59.220, Speaker A: They jump in steps of two since the tick spacing is equal to two.
