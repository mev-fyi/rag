00:00:00.250 - 00:00:03.998, Speaker A: What is square root price x 96? It is the square root of price.
00:00:04.084 - 00:00:16.718, Speaker B: Multiplied by some scalar. First, let's go over the definition of a price. Let's say that there are x amount of token zeros and y amount of token one. Then we define P to be the price of x in terms of y.
00:00:16.804 - 00:00:18.378, Speaker C: This can be expressed as a ratio.
00:00:18.394 - 00:00:35.686, Speaker B: Of y divided by x. For example, if x is E and y is USDC, and let's say that one e is 1800 USDC, then y will be 1800 USDC and x will be one e. Okay, what is square root price x 96?
00:00:35.788 - 00:00:37.334, Speaker A: Well, it is the square root of.
00:00:37.372 - 00:00:45.402, Speaker B: P times q 96. What is q 96? Q 96 is simply two raised to the 96 power.
00:00:45.536 - 00:00:47.322, Speaker A: If we know square root price x.
00:00:47.376 - 00:00:50.554, Speaker B: 96, how do we calculate the price p?
00:00:50.672 - 00:00:53.030, Speaker A: Well, what we'll do is first divide.
00:00:53.110 - 00:01:22.402, Speaker B: Both sides by q 96, and then you will take the power of two on both sides. To remove the square root, take the power of two on both sides, and on the left side we have square root price x 96 over q 96 raised to the power of two is equal to p. These are the two equations to keep in mind. Square root price x 96 is equal to the square root of p multiplied by q 96. And to get back p when we know square root price x 96, we'll use this equation.
00:01:22.546 - 00:01:33.946, Speaker C: Here's an example of calculating the price from square root price x 96. I've got the square root price x 96 from the arbitram e USDC pool. And then we define q. Q is.
00:01:33.968 - 00:01:41.818, Speaker B: Equal to two to the 96, and to get p the price, all you have to do is take the square root price x 96 divided by q.
00:01:41.904 - 00:02:09.700, Speaker C: And then raise that to the power of two. Next, we need to multiply and divide this p by decimals. Token zeros is eve, so it has 18 decimals. USDC is token one and it has six decimals. We multiply p by decimal zero so by ten to the 18 and then divide by ten to the six. Let's execute this code and we get that the price in terms of USDC is 1888.
