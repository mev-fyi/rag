00:00:00.250 - 00:00:43.706, Speaker A: What is rye and how does it compare with other stablecoins? Rye is a nonpegged, decentralized stablecoin. What does it mean for a stablecoin to be nonpegged and decentralized? Nonpegged stablecoin is a stablecoin that is not pegged to $1. To illustrate what this means, I'm going to group different stablecoins into either pegged or nonpegged and centralized or decentralized. Here's how I'm going to group the stablecoins. If the stable is pegged to $1, then I'll put them above this line, and if it is decentralized, I'll put it to the right, and if it is centralized, I'll put it to the left. If the stablecoin is not pegged to $1, then I'll put it below the horizontal line. If it is centralized, I'll put it to the left, and if it is decentralized, I'll put it to the right.
00:00:43.706 - 00:01:11.918, Speaker A: Okay, here are some stablecoins that's grouped in as either pegged or not pegged and centralized or decentralized. Let's start with some famous ones. For example, let's start with USDC. Is USDC pegged to $1? Is it always equal to or very close to $1? Yes, it is. However, USDC is not decentralized, it is centralized. So I'll put it over here, and the same goes for USDT. USDT is pegged to $1.
00:01:11.918 - 00:01:48.138, Speaker A: However, it is centralized. How about Dai? Dai is also pegged to $1. Dai isn't complete decentralized, it aims to be decentralized. However, because some of the collaterals are backed by centralized coins like USDC. I'll put it somewhere between centralized and decentralized, and the same goes for fracs. Frax is fractionally backed by USDC, so I'll put it here under pegged, but somewhere between centralized and decentralized. Lusd is another stablecoin that is pegged to $1, and I'll put this as decentralized.
00:01:48.138 - 00:02:25.954, Speaker A: So far, all of the stablecoins that we looked at are pegged to $1. Are there any stablecoins that are not pegged to $1? Well, this is rye. Rye is a decentralized stablecoin that is not pegged to $1. It is decentralized because the only collateral that EPs is ETH, and unlike the other stablecoins, it is not pegged to $1, meaning that this is a coin where the price can go above $1. And go below $1. Last time I checked it was around $2.77. And lastly, UST was a decentralized stablecoin that was pegged to $1, but since it's crashed, it is no longer pegged to $1.
00:02:25.954 - 00:02:27.220, Speaker A: So I'll put it somewhere around here.
