00:00:00.250 - 00:00:32.822, Speaker A: In this video, I'll give you some examples of spot price in constant product amm. This applies to both uniswap b two and b three. I'll also show you that if the spot price of one token is p, then the spot price of the other token will be one divided by p. Let's start off with uniswap b two x is the amount of token a in the pool and y is the amount of token b inside the pool. From the previous video, we derived that the price of token b in terms of token a. We'll name it. P of y is equal to y divided by x.
00:00:32.822 - 00:01:04.750, Speaker A: The amount of token b in the pool divided by the amount of token a. Now, we could have run through the same argument for token A, and we'll get that price of token A in terms of token B. We will name it. P of x is equal to x divided by y here. Notice that the price of the two tokens are the reciprocal of each other. If we let p equal to y divided by x, then p of y is equal to p and p of x is equal to one divided by p. P of y and p of x are the reciprocal of each other.
00:01:04.750 - 00:01:10.722, Speaker A: If you know the price of one token, then the price of the other token is one divided by the price.
00:01:10.856 - 00:01:12.834, Speaker B: We will revisit this equation again when.
00:01:12.872 - 00:01:16.770, Speaker A: We derive the time weighted average price in uniswap b three.
00:01:16.920 - 00:01:18.706, Speaker B: Okay, so let's see some examples of.
00:01:18.728 - 00:01:59.886, Speaker A: Povi and plbx in Uniswap b. Two. Let's say that there are 30,000 dies and ten e inside uniswap b two pool. What is the price of e in terms of die? Here, e is y and die is x. So we're trying to find p of y which is equal to y divided by x, and this will be equal to ten e over 30,000 di. We can cancel out the zeros and say one e over 3000 die. So what is the price of e in terms of die? Well, it is equal to one e is equal to 3000 die.
00:01:59.886 - 00:02:39.870, Speaker A: Let's look at another example. What is the price of die in terms of e? Die is x and e is y. So here we're looking for p of x. P of x, by definition, is equal to x divided by y. This is equal to 30,000 di divided by ten e. So this will be equal to, again, the zeros cancel out and this will be equal to 3000 die over one e. So what is the price of die in terms of ef? Well, it is 3000 die equals one e.
00:02:39.870 - 00:02:56.758, Speaker A: Or divide both sides by 3000 and we get one die is equal to one over 3000 e. If I have one over 3000 above e, then this is equal to one die. Now, this example also applies to unisop b three, except that there is a slight difference.
00:02:56.924 - 00:02:59.622, Speaker B: In uniswap B, two, x and y.
00:02:59.676 - 00:03:11.974, Speaker A: Are actual amounts of token inside the pool, whereas in uniswap b three, x and y are virtual amounts. In uniswap B three, this is called virtual reserves. So what are virtual reserves?
00:03:12.102 - 00:03:14.186, Speaker B: Well, virtual reserve means that only some.
00:03:14.208 - 00:03:17.174, Speaker A: Of the amounts are actually there inside the pool.
00:03:17.302 - 00:03:19.082, Speaker B: Let's say that in unison B two.
00:03:19.136 - 00:03:25.834, Speaker A: We have x amount of token a and y amount of token b. These are actual amounts that are inside the pool.
00:03:25.962 - 00:03:28.526, Speaker B: However, in unison B three, some of.
00:03:28.548 - 00:03:30.234, Speaker A: These amounts are virtual.
00:03:30.362 - 00:03:32.126, Speaker B: The actual amount that is inside the.
00:03:32.148 - 00:03:40.690, Speaker A: Pool might be less than the virtual reserves. For example, x, sub r is the real amount inside this pool and x of b is the virtual amount.
00:03:40.840 - 00:03:42.546, Speaker B: When you add these together, you get.
00:03:42.568 - 00:04:17.786, Speaker A: The full amount of x. Likewise, for the quantity y, some of them are real and the others are virtual amounts, amounts of tokens that actually do not exist inside the pool. We can write x in terms of the real amount and the virtual amount. The virtual reserve x is equal to the virtual amount of token a plus the real amount of token a. Likewise, the virtual reserve of y is equal to the virtual amount of token b plus the real amount of token b. I'll make another video about how the virtual reserves are calculated and how this graph is also determined, but for now we'll ignore the details.
00:04:17.898 - 00:04:19.166, Speaker B: What I want you to remember in.
00:04:19.188 - 00:04:37.478, Speaker A: This video is that we let p equal to y divided by x, then pl y. The price of token b in terms of token a is equal to p, and the price of token a in terms of token b is equal to one divided by p. This holds for both uniswap b three and uniswap b two.
00:04:37.644 - 00:04:39.606, Speaker B: We will visit this equation again when.
00:04:39.628 - 00:04:43.060, Speaker A: We derive the time weighted average price in uniswap b three.
