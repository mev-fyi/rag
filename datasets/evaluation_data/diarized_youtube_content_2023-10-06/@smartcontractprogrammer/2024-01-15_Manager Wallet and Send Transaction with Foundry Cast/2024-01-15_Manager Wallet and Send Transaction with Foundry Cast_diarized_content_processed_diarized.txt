00:00:00.330 - 00:00:32.306, Speaker A: Cast is a command line tool that comes with foundry that allows you to call smart contracts and send transactions. Recently I learned how to use this tool. So today I'll be sharing with you how to import a wallet using cast, how to list the wallet, and how to remove the wallet. And later I'll show you how to send transactions and call smart contracts. The first thing that I'll show you is how to set up a wallet using cast. For this example, I'll import the private key to create a new wallet using cast. We'll type cast wallet, import and then the name of the wallet.
00:00:32.306 - 00:00:52.534, Speaker A: I'll name it burner. We'll set up a new wallet from a private key. So I'll type private key and then inside here go ahead and type your private key. I'm not going to share my private key with you. However, I did store this in a variable. So type private key, execute the command. It's going to ask for a password.
00:00:52.534 - 00:01:18.290, Speaker A: I'll set up a password. And now we successfully set up a wallet using cast for this address. If you wanted to see the wallets that's managed by cast, you would type cast wallet list. For this example, we set up a burner wallet. So here you see one account named Burner. Now, if you wanted to delete this wallet, all you have to do is delete the file. So I'll say RmRF.
00:01:18.290 - 00:01:51.390, Speaker A: The file is stored under home foundry keystore. And then the name of the account. I've named this account burner, so type burner, and then I'll delete all of the files on the burner. And then if we list the wallets again, you'll see that it returns nothing. So this was an example of how to set up a wallet using private key. List the wallets that's managed by cast, and then remove the wallet. I'm going to set up this wallet again so that I can show you an example of how to send transactions and query a smart contract.
00:01:51.390 - 00:02:25.686, Speaker A: I deployed a contract called storage on the Gorli testnet. It has a single state variable called Val and it stores a unit 256. It also has a function where we will be able to set this Val. For the next two example, we're going to use cache to set the value of Val and also query the value of Val back inside my terminal, I'm going to set some variables that we will be using. DST will be the address of the contract. Next we'll set a variable for the function that we're going to be calling. I'll name this variable funk sig.
00:02:25.686 - 00:03:01.318, Speaker A: This will be equal to the function that we're going to be calling is called set, and it's going to take a single parameter un 256. The argument that we're going to be passing to this function set, let's say args is equal to let's pass the number eight. And then we're also going to need the RPC URL. For the RPC, I'll be using alchemy. So say RPC is equal to RPC that I copied over from alchemy. Okay, next we'll send the transaction to this contract to call the function set and set the value to eight eight. To do this, I'll type cast send.
00:03:01.318 - 00:03:36.494, Speaker A: We will use the burner account that we set up. So say account burner. The RpC URL, rpcurl will be stored inside the variable RpC, the address of the contract DST, and then the function that we're calling funk sig, and the parameter that we're going to be passing to this function. Args execute the command to send the transaction. Okay, I've waited about a minute for the transaction to go through. Let's try querying the contract. I'll clear the terminal to query a smart contract using cast.
00:03:36.494 - 00:04:09.238, Speaker A: We'll use cast call and then the RPC URL. Rpc URL. The RPC URL for this example is stored in a variable called RPC. The address of the contract is stored in DST and we'll call the function bell. This is the state variable that stores the number that we just set. When we call this function, we expect to return a unit 256, Un 256, and execute the command. And we get eight eight eight back when we send the transaction, we set the bell to eight eight.
00:04:09.238 - 00:04:20.570, Speaker A: And here we query the smart contract. Then we got back eight eight. So in this video I showed you an example of how to account management using cash, how to send a transaction, and how to query a smart contract.
