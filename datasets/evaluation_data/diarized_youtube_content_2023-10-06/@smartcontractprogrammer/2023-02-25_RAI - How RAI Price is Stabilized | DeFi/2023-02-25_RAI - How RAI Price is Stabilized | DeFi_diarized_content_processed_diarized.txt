00:00:00.330 - 00:00:28.418, Speaker A: The topic of this video is how the price of rye is stabilized. Let's start with definitions. The market price is the price of rye on the market. For example, this can be like the price that you see on Coingecko or centralized exchanges or something like a Dex like uniswap. So this is the price at which rye is trading at the moment. The redemption price is the target price of rye, set by the protocol and redemption rate. This is the rate at which the redemption price is changed by the protocol.
00:00:28.418 - 00:00:57.166, Speaker A: Let's take a look at example illustrating these terms. In orange is the market price. As you can see, it is going up and down. The redemption price is the price set by the ride protocol. It also goes up and down, but it goes in a much smoother way. Take a note that in this section, the redemption price is decreasing, and between here to here, the redemption price is increasing, and then from beyond it is decreasing again. The rate at which this redemption price changes is called a redemption rate.
00:00:57.166 - 00:01:31.302, Speaker A: So in this section, the redemption rate is negative since the redemption price is decreasing. In the next section, you can see that the redemption price is increasing. So in this section, in this green section, the redemption rate is positive. And from here you can see that the redemption price is going down. So the redemption rate is negative. Also, you may have noticed that in general, when the market price is above the redemption price, the redemption price is decreasing. And when the market price is below the redemption price, the redemption price is increasing.
00:01:31.302 - 00:02:13.030, Speaker A: And again, when the market price goes above the redemption price, the redemption price decreases. And at the end, the market price and the redemption price converges. We'll go over in more details how the redemption price and the market price converges, but for now, I want to answer the question, how is the redemption price set? How is the redemption rate set? The redemption rate is set by an algorithm inside the ride smart contract. The algorithm that is being used to calculate the redemption rate is called a PID controller. This is an algorithm widely used in control theory. Here I won't go into the details of a PID controller, but let me give you an analogy of what a PID controller is doing. The PiD controller is like.
00:02:13.030 - 00:02:46.498, Speaker A: It's like taking a shower. When you take a shower, you turn the knob until the temperature is right. When you want to take a hot shower, you first turn on the knob until you get some hot water out. If you turn on too much of the hot water, then the hot water will come out. So now you would want to turn on the knob to get some cold water out. You repeat this process of turning the knob for more hot water or for more cold water until the temperature is right for you. Similar to adjusting the temperature of the hot water, the PID controller adjusts the redemption rate until the market price converges to the redemption price.
00:02:46.498 - 00:03:24.958, Speaker A: But how does changing the redemption rate converge the market price to the redemption price? We will take a look at two cases when the market price is greater than the redemption price, and later when the market price is less than the redemption price. How does changing the redemption rate converge the market price to the redemption price? So let's say that the market price is greater than the redemption price. Here is a graph. Here is the redemption price. And overall, you can see that the market price is above the redemption price. Also note that at some points, the market price is below the redemption price, like over here and over here. But in general, the market price is above the redemption price.
00:03:24.958 - 00:04:10.490, Speaker A: So in this case, how would we converge the redemption price and the market price? What we need to do is bring the market price closer to the redemption price. Bringing the market price down. How can we bring the market price down? Well, what we need to do is create sell demand so that the market price goes down. And to do this, what the Rye protocol does is it decreases the redemption rate. Let's see how decreasing the redemption rate will bring the market price down. To understand how decreasing the redemption rate will bring the market price down, we need to consider two types of participants in the Rye protocol, the rye borrower and the rye holder. The rye borrower is a user who has borrowed, right? So this will be a user who has opened a ri safe, deposited some ETH collateral, and borrowed, right.
00:04:10.490 - 00:04:43.862, Speaker A: The riholder will be anyone holding the right. Let's see how these two participants should act when the redemption rate is decreased. Let's start with rye borrower. For the ride borrower, the future ride debt is cheaper. For example, if you borrow ride over here at $100 and the redemption rate is decreasing, let's say to $90, then your debt will be $90 in the future. So that is what I mean by future ride debt is cheaper. If your future ride debt is cheaper, then what should the ride borrower do? Well, he knows that the ride debt can be paid cheaper in the future.
00:04:43.862 - 00:05:17.890, Speaker A: So what he can do is borrow more rye now, sell it immediately, and when the debt is cheaper in the future, he can buy back and then repay rye. We'll go over example of how this can make a profit for the rye borrower. But first, let's see how the rye holder should act when the redemption rate is decreased. For the rye holder, this will be a user who is holding on to rye. The future price of rye might go down. If you expect the price of something to go down, then what should you do now? Well, you should sell your rye. So these are the two ways the rye protocol creates sell demand by decreasing the redemption rate.
00:05:17.890 - 00:05:46.054, Speaker A: Let me give you an example of how the rye borrower can make some profit by doing this strategy. Borrow more rye, sell immediately, and then buy and repay rye later. For example, let's say that the current price of rye is $3. Let's also say that the redemption rate is -10% annualized. So assuming that the redemption rate stays the same, this means that one year from now, the rye will be 10% cheaper. 10% of $3 is $0.30. So minus $0.30
00:05:46.054 - 00:06:20.150, Speaker A: from $3, we get that the rye in one year, assuming that the redemption rate is constant, will be $2.70. Assuming that, we strongly believe that the price of rye one year from now will be $2.70. What can we do today to make profit? Well, what we can do is borrow rye today, sell it, and then repay one year from now. Let's go through the numbers of how this can make profit. We borrow 100 rye from the Rye protocol. The price of rye today is $3. We borrowed 100 rye, so our debt in USD dollar terms will be $300.
00:06:20.150 - 00:06:48.122, Speaker A: The amount of USD dollars we have so far is $0. And then we immediately sell the rye that we just borrowed. Our debt will still be $300. The price of rye today is $3 and we still owe the rye protocol 100 rye. However, since we sold the rye at $3, now we have a cash of $300.01 year later, let's assume that the market price of Rye has converged to $2.70. Let's buy back the 100 rye that we owe and see how we can make a profit.
00:06:48.122 - 00:07:19.218, Speaker A: At the current price, one rye is equal to 270 and we need to buy back 100 rye. So our debt in terms of USD is $270. This is the amount of USD that we need to buy back 100 rYe. And when we buy back 100 rye at $2.70 each, since we started with $300 in cash, we still have $30 left over. After buying the 100 rye, we repay this 100 rye back to the rye protocol. So our debt is now equal to zero and we have an extra $30 cash in profit.
00:07:19.218 - 00:08:07.382, Speaker A: So this is how a rye borrower can make money. Knowing that the redemption rate is negative. Next, I'm going to go over how the Rye protocol incentivizes participants to bring the market price closer to the redemption price. When the market price is below the redemption price. For example, let's say that here is the redemption price, and overall the market price is below the redemption price. And like the previous example of when the market price was greater than the redemption price, there are some points where the market price is above the redemption price, but overall, the market price is below the redemption price. In this case, what would the RyE protocol do to incentivize participants to bring the market price closer to the redemption price? Well, to bring the market price closer to the redemption price, what we need to do is bring the market price up.
00:08:07.382 - 00:08:44.958, Speaker A: And how can we do this? We can do this by creating buy demands. And the way the rye protocol creates by demand is by increasing the redemption rate. Let's see how increasing the redemption rate will create by demand for the rye. Again, there's going to be two participants that we'll consider, the rye borrower and the ride holder. If you are a ride borrower, then your future debt is more expensive. If your ride debt is $100 today, since the redemption rate is increasing, it might be worth $110 in the future. And if you are a rye borrower, this means that you have Ef as collateral, and you don't want your e be liquidated.
00:08:44.958 - 00:09:21.758, Speaker A: So you have a strong incentive to repay your rye. If you are a rye borrower and you sold your rye in the past, now you need to go buy it back. So this is how the rye protocol creates buy demand for the rye borrower. How about for rye holders? Well, if you're a holder of rye, then you might be thinking that the future price of rye might go up. This is because the redemption price is going up. So, as a rye holder, what should you do? Well, one way you might be able to make money is to hold rye or buy rye now and then sell later again. This will create a buy demand to bring the market price up and closer to the redemption price.
00:09:21.758 - 00:10:03.546, Speaker A: In summary, the redemption price is the target price of rye set by the protocol. Redemption rate is the rate at which the redemption price is changed by the protocol. The redemption rate is set by the smart contract in the rye protocol using what's called a pid controller. When the market price is greater than the redemption price, the rye protocol will decrease the redemption rate, and this will create sell demand on the market. The rye borrowers are incentivized to borrow more rye, and the rye holders are incentivized to sell their rye. On the other hand, when the market price is less than the redemption price, the rye protocol sets the redemption rate to positive. It increases the redemption rate and this will create a buy demand for the rye borrower.
00:10:03.546 - 00:10:14.140, Speaker A: The debt is getting more expensive, so they are incentivized to repay their rye debt now. And for the rye holder, they are incentivized to hold their rye for now and then sell later.
