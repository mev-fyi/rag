00:00:00.570 - 00:00:39.260, Speaker A: What you're seeing here is Metamask. And Metamask is an Ethereum wallet that you can install inside your browser. By installing metamask, web applications are able to interact with smart contracts on the blockchain. In this video, I'm going to show you how to connect truffle with metamask and then import the accounts from truffle into metamask. The first thing that you would need to do is run a local blockchain using truffle. So, open your terminal and type truffle develop. And this will start a local blockchain running inside your computer.
00:00:39.260 - 00:01:23.480, Speaker A: All right, so the next thing that we would want to do is connect this local blockchain to Metamask. So, inside the truffle console, if you scroll up, you can see here that the blockchain is running at localhost port 9545. So we're going to copy this address, and back inside Metamask, select the network, and then select custom RPC. This will open up a form where we can tell metamask which URL our blockchain is running. So for the network name, I'll just name it Deb. And for the URL, we'll paste the URL that we copied over from truffle console. And that's all you need.
00:01:23.480 - 00:02:03.010, Speaker A: So hit save, and that is all you need to do to connect metamask with the local blockchain running using truffle. Let's just quickly go over what we did. So, inside our terminal, we typed in truffle develop, and then copy the URL where the local blockchain is running on. Back in metamask, we selected custom URL, which opened up the form. And then we pasted the URL inside here and then hit save. And now we can switch between networks. So, for example, we could select the Robson test network.
00:02:03.010 - 00:02:32.538, Speaker A: And we can also select the dev network that we just created. Next, let's go over how to import these accounts into metamask. To import an account, the first thing that we need to do is scroll down in the truffle console. And here you'll see some private keys. The first private key corresponds to the first account. The second private key corresponds to the second account. The third private key corresponds to the third account.
00:02:32.538 - 00:03:12.470, Speaker A: And so on. I'm going to show you how to import the first account. So I'm going to copy this private key back in Metamask over to the top right, and then click import account. And inside here, we'll paste our private key and then hit import. And that's all you have to do to import the account provided by truffle into Metamask. Note that this account has 100 ether only inside your local blockchain. And to show you this, if you switch over to account to a testnet, you can see here on the left that this same exact account no longer has 100 ether.
00:03:12.470 - 00:03:35.900, Speaker A: You'll also notice here that it has 1.95 ethers. And this is because I deposited some ether to this account. I'll show you in another video how you can get some ether for your account on the Robson network. That completes the setups needed to start building a web application. Thanks for watching and see you in the next video.
