00:00:00.250 - 00:00:03.994, Speaker A: An ERC 1155 contract manages multiple tokens.
00:00:04.042 - 00:00:05.274, Speaker B: In a single contract.
00:00:05.402 - 00:00:06.846, Speaker C: Let's take a look at example of.
00:00:06.868 - 00:00:13.210, Speaker A: A contract that manages multiple ERC 20 tokens and also an ERC 1155 contract.
00:00:13.290 - 00:00:16.314, Speaker B: That manages multiple tokens in a single contract.
00:00:16.442 - 00:00:18.094, Speaker C: For this example, we will be taking.
00:00:18.132 - 00:00:21.294, Speaker D: A look at uniswap B three and uniswap B four.
00:00:21.412 - 00:00:23.454, Speaker E: Let's say that in uniswap B three.
00:00:23.492 - 00:00:25.270, Speaker D: I want to swap die to.
00:00:25.460 - 00:00:27.782, Speaker C: And for this example, we'll also say.
00:00:27.836 - 00:00:31.074, Speaker D: That there is only two pools, DaiUsDC.
00:00:31.122 - 00:00:34.018, Speaker F: Pool and USDC WEF pool.
00:00:34.114 - 00:00:35.814, Speaker E: So in this situation, if I wanted.
00:00:35.852 - 00:00:38.246, Speaker F: To trade dai to WEF, then I.
00:00:38.268 - 00:00:40.674, Speaker E: Will first need to transfer my dai.
00:00:40.722 - 00:00:44.266, Speaker F: Into daiUSDC pool, get some USDC, and.
00:00:44.288 - 00:00:47.494, Speaker D: Then transfer the USDC to USDC WEF.
00:00:47.542 - 00:00:50.586, Speaker F: Pool, trade the USDC into WEF and.
00:00:50.608 - 00:00:51.814, Speaker D: Then I get the WEF.
00:00:51.942 - 00:00:53.374, Speaker C: This is an example of how we.
00:00:53.412 - 00:00:56.414, Speaker D: Trade erc 20s in unison B three.
00:00:56.532 - 00:00:58.014, Speaker C: Next, let's take a look at how.
00:00:58.052 - 00:01:01.706, Speaker D: Uniswap B four will handle these token transfers.
00:01:01.818 - 00:01:03.554, Speaker A: Again, we'll be swapping from Dai to.
00:01:03.592 - 00:01:08.894, Speaker D: WEF and uniswap B four is an ERC 1155 contract.
00:01:09.022 - 00:01:11.522, Speaker E: As I mentioned earlier, this contract can.
00:01:11.576 - 00:01:16.502, Speaker A: Manage multiple tokens in a single contract. So what you see over here is.
00:01:16.556 - 00:01:19.558, Speaker F: That we have die USDC pool and.
00:01:19.644 - 00:01:22.994, Speaker D: USDC WEF pool inside a single contract.
00:01:23.122 - 00:01:28.806, Speaker A: The token transfers are internal to this contract. Hence, we'll be saving some gas when.
00:01:28.828 - 00:01:30.546, Speaker D: We trade on unison before.
00:01:30.668 - 00:01:32.154, Speaker C: Let's take a look at an example.
00:01:32.272 - 00:01:34.166, Speaker A: So again, a user wants to trade.
00:01:34.198 - 00:01:39.654, Speaker D: Die to F, so he would transfer the die into the unison B four contract.
00:01:39.782 - 00:01:42.098, Speaker A: Now, unlike Unison B three where tokens.
00:01:42.134 - 00:01:46.494, Speaker D: Were transferred in and out of different pools, here all of the pools are.
00:01:46.532 - 00:01:48.186, Speaker B: Inside a single contract.
00:01:48.298 - 00:01:51.166, Speaker F: The transfer from DaI to USDC will.
00:01:51.188 - 00:01:53.422, Speaker D: Be internal, will be done inside this.
00:01:53.476 - 00:01:56.026, Speaker A: Contract, and the USDC will be traded.
00:01:56.058 - 00:01:58.234, Speaker B: To WEF inside this contract.
00:01:58.362 - 00:02:00.810, Speaker F: And lastly, the user receives the WEF.
00:02:00.890 - 00:02:02.778, Speaker A: So that is the difference between unison.
00:02:02.794 - 00:02:04.966, Speaker F: B three and B four MB three.
00:02:05.028 - 00:02:07.138, Speaker A: There are multiple token transfers.
00:02:07.234 - 00:02:09.126, Speaker F: However, in B four, all of the.
00:02:09.148 - 00:02:11.442, Speaker B: Token transfers are internal.
00:02:11.586 - 00:02:15.410, Speaker D: This is all managed inside this ERC 1155 contract.
