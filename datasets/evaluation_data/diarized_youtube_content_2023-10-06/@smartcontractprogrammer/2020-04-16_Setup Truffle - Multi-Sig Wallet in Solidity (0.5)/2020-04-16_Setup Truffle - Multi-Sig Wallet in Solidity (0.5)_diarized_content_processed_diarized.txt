00:00:00.330 - 00:00:03.738, Speaker A: So we have our Multisig wallet contract in remix.
00:00:03.914 - 00:00:05.566, Speaker B: And remix is a good tool to.
00:00:05.588 - 00:00:09.146, Speaker C: Use when you're just getting started with solidity.
00:00:09.338 - 00:00:11.086, Speaker A: However, when it comes to testing the.
00:00:11.108 - 00:00:14.206, Speaker D: Smart contract or building a web based.
00:00:14.308 - 00:00:18.080, Speaker B: Application, remix isn't the best tool to use.
00:00:18.610 - 00:00:20.286, Speaker A: So in this video, I'm going to.
00:00:20.308 - 00:00:22.810, Speaker B: Introduce you to a tool called Truffle.
00:00:22.890 - 00:00:24.686, Speaker E: Which will allow us to test our.
00:00:24.708 - 00:00:27.350, Speaker D: Smart contract and set up a local.
00:00:27.420 - 00:00:33.590, Speaker E: Blockchain that will allow us to build our web application that connects to our contract.
00:00:35.130 - 00:00:37.490, Speaker B: So here I've created a folder called.
00:00:37.580 - 00:00:41.994, Speaker D: Solidity Multisig wallet and I've opened the.
00:00:42.032 - 00:00:45.626, Speaker F: Code editor inside it. And the first thing that we're going.
00:00:45.648 - 00:00:47.850, Speaker E: To do is install truffle.
00:00:49.070 - 00:00:55.390, Speaker G: So inside your terminal, type mpmi g truffle.
00:01:01.010 - 00:01:02.754, Speaker A: Once that is done, you can check.
00:01:02.792 - 00:01:05.970, Speaker G: That truffle was installed by typing truffle.
00:01:07.910 - 00:01:10.740, Speaker C: And you'll see a list of commands that is available.
00:01:11.990 - 00:01:14.466, Speaker D: Once Truffle is installed, we'll create a.
00:01:14.488 - 00:01:17.906, Speaker H: Truffle project inside this folder solidity multisig.
00:01:17.938 - 00:01:21.510, Speaker G: Wallet by typing in truffle.
00:01:23.210 - 00:01:24.150, Speaker F: Init.
00:01:27.700 - 00:01:30.576, Speaker D: And that will create some folders on the.
00:01:30.598 - 00:01:32.436, Speaker H: Top left here you can see some.
00:01:32.458 - 00:01:35.444, Speaker C: Of the folders that truffle created, and.
00:01:35.482 - 00:01:37.668, Speaker D: I'll explain what these folders are for.
00:01:37.754 - 00:01:39.110, Speaker H: As we need them.
00:01:39.480 - 00:01:42.004, Speaker D: We need to install some NPM packages.
00:01:42.132 - 00:01:45.540, Speaker H: That will be really helpful to have for our testing.
00:01:45.700 - 00:01:48.916, Speaker D: So first, we'll create a package JSon.
00:01:49.108 - 00:01:54.588, Speaker G: By typing NPm init F. And on.
00:01:54.594 - 00:01:56.188, Speaker H: The top left corner of the screen.
00:01:56.274 - 00:01:59.660, Speaker C: You can see here that package Json was created.
00:02:00.160 - 00:02:16.400, Speaker G: Next, we'll install some NPm packages. So type NPm PI save Deb, and we'll install chai and chai. As promised.
00:02:18.900 - 00:02:19.844, Speaker D: We'Re going to be using.
00:02:19.882 - 00:02:22.324, Speaker C: These two packages when we write our test.
00:02:22.442 - 00:02:25.312, Speaker D: I'll explain why these packages are useful.
00:02:25.456 - 00:02:27.350, Speaker F: Later when we write our test.
00:02:27.960 - 00:02:30.532, Speaker D: So we've created a truffle project and.
00:02:30.586 - 00:02:33.368, Speaker C: Installed some NPm packages that we need.
00:02:33.534 - 00:02:34.936, Speaker D: The next thing that we need to.
00:02:34.958 - 00:02:37.524, Speaker H: Do is copy our multisig wallet smart.
00:02:37.572 - 00:02:40.840, Speaker E: Contract from remix into truffle.
00:02:41.340 - 00:02:43.144, Speaker H: So first, I'm going to copy the.
00:02:43.182 - 00:02:45.980, Speaker E: Code of the multisig wallet from remix.
00:02:46.800 - 00:02:49.900, Speaker D: And back in our code editor. I'm going to open the folder called.
00:02:49.970 - 00:02:58.880, Speaker G: Contracts and create a file called Multisigwallet Soul.
00:02:59.460 - 00:03:06.236, Speaker D: And inside the file, I'm going to paste the code. We can test that our code compiles.
00:03:06.268 - 00:03:10.160, Speaker G: By typing truffle compile.
00:03:12.580 - 00:03:14.956, Speaker D: You can see here that truffle compiled.
00:03:14.988 - 00:03:17.040, Speaker E: Our multisig wallet contract.
00:03:17.540 - 00:03:18.896, Speaker D: So I've showed you how to set.
00:03:18.918 - 00:03:22.120, Speaker E: Up a truffle project and compile a contract.
00:03:22.540 - 00:03:24.216, Speaker D: In the next video, I'll show you.
00:03:24.238 - 00:03:26.660, Speaker C: How to test this contract. Bye.
