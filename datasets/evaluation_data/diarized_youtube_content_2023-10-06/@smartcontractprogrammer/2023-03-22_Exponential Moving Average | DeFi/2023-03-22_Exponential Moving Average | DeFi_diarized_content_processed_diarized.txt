00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.094, Speaker A: Exponential moving average is a way of.
00:00:02.132 - 00:00:10.318, Speaker B: Calculating the average of the historical prices. Here I have a graph of price of something. It goes up and down, up and down and up and down.
00:00:10.404 - 00:00:12.446, Speaker A: The exponential moving average will be a.
00:00:12.468 - 00:00:53.374, Speaker B: Smoothed out version of this price graph. How do we calculate this? Let's start with definitions. We'll define that mot is equal to the exponential moving average at time t, and p of t is equal to the price at time empty. To calculate the exponential moving average, we first set m zero, the exponential moving average at time t equals zero to the price at t equals zero, p zero, and then for all t afterwards, we define mot to be equal to some variable. Alpha times the price at t plus one minus alpha times the previous exponential moving average and with t minus one. And we also restrict that alpha must be between zero and one.
00:00:53.492 - 00:00:55.054, Speaker A: What we're doing here is we are.
00:00:55.092 - 00:01:12.500, Speaker B: Taking the weighted average of the past and the present prices. The present price is pot and the past prices. The average of the past prices is stored in m of t minus one. Let's go through an example, and in the process, I'll explain where the term exponential comes from.
00:01:13.670 - 00:01:15.682, Speaker A: Let's say that we have exponential moving.
00:01:15.736 - 00:02:04.660, Speaker B: Averages up to t equals 100. M of 100 is equal to alpha times the price at t equals 100 plus one minus alpha times the exponential moving average at t equals 99. The exponential moving average at t equals 99 is equal to alpha times the price at t equals 99 plus one minus alpha times the exponential moving average at t equals 98. And likewise for exponential moving average at t equals 98. M 98 is equal to alpha times p 98 plus one minus alpha times m of 97. We can keep on repeating this process until m zero, the exponential moving average at time t equals zero, which will be simply b equal to p zero. So, to understand where the term exponential comes from, let's expand m 100.
00:02:04.660 - 00:02:27.770, Speaker B: So what is m 100? Let's start off here, copy this, paste this here. Next, I'm going to expand m 99. So first I'll remove this and then I'll copy this term. This is m 99. Paste it here. And we need to multiply this term by one minus alpha. So I'll wrap this in apprentices.
00:02:27.770 - 00:03:05.142, Speaker B: These terms inside the orange dotted box is equal to m 99. Okay, let's simplify this equation. So copy this and then paste it here. And the terms inside here are being multiplied by one minus alpha. So this will be one minus alpha times alpha times p 99 plus another. One minus alpha times one minus alpha times m 98. We can simplify this part of the equation by simply saying this is equal to one minus alpha square.
00:03:05.142 - 00:03:38.658, Speaker B: Okay, similar to what we did here, let's expand m 98. M 98 is equal to this term. I'll paste it here. And we're going to be multiplying these terms by one minus alpha square. So this will be move this over to the right for now, one minus alpha square times alpha times p 98. And we also need to multiply this term by one minus alpha square. So this will be plus one minus alpha square times one minus alpha times m 97.
00:03:38.658 - 00:04:10.298, Speaker B: One minus alpha squared times one minus alpha is simply one minus alpha cube. I wrote M 97 over here. And if we expand m 97, it's going to be multiplied by one minus alpha to the cube. So the first term will be alpha times p 97. So let me put this in another line. So the first term will be multiplied by alpha times p 97. And then the next term will be one minus alpha times m 96.
00:04:10.298 - 00:04:21.006, Speaker B: And we're going to be multiplying this by one minus alpha cube. So the next term will be one minus alpha raised to the power of four times m 96.
00:04:21.108 - 00:04:21.582, Speaker A: So far.
00:04:21.636 - 00:04:47.590, Speaker B: Notice that for each term we have a one minus alpha. We have a one minus alpha here, and then the next one has a one minus alpha raised to the power of two. And the next one has one minus alpha raised to the power of two. And it continues until m zero. Also notice that all of the terms have an alpha which is being multiplied by the price at t. Here it is multiplied by p 99. Here it is multiplied by p 98.
00:04:47.590 - 00:05:19.186, Speaker B: Here it is multiplied by p 97 and so on. So if you continue this process of expanding the exponential moving average, we can do this up to m zero. At m zero, we will have one minus alpha raised to the power of 100. And we'll be multiplying this by the price pe zero. How about the alpha? Well, if I scroll up, notice that the exponential moving average mot has alpha for all terms except t equals zero. At t equals zero. M zero is just p zero.
00:05:19.186 - 00:05:51.098, Speaker B: It is not multiplying by an alpha. So here for the last term, we don't multiply by alpha, but for all of the terms other than the last term, we multiply the price by alpha. Okay, let's write this into a more concise equation. So we have m sub 100 is equal to. Let's try to generalize all of the terms except the last one. Since the last one doesn't have an alpha, all of them except the last one has an alpha. So we'll paste it here as well.
00:05:51.098 - 00:06:15.442, Speaker B: And then we do some kind of summation. We're going to be summing all of the terms except the last. So we'll be summing all the way up to 99. And for each term, I see the price p 100, p 99, p 98. We're starting from I equals zero, and the first term is 100. The next term is 99. The next term is 98, and the next term is 97.
00:06:15.442 - 00:06:57.250, Speaker B: Each term is subtracting one from 100. So this will be starting from 100 minus I. And then we also have for each term, we have a one minus alpha, one minus alpha square, one minus alpha cube, and so on, except for the first term. But we can also say that there is a one minus alpha raised to the power of zero, which is simply equal to one. So we multiply each term by one minus alpha raised to the power of I. So this equation summarizes this part of the equation all the way except the last term. So for the last term, just copy this and then paste it here.
00:06:57.250 - 00:07:32.646, Speaker B: This is a concise way of writing this equation. How about if we generalize it? How about if we say exponential moving average of some time big t. Here we said 99 was one -100 or we can generalize this to be t minus one. Here we have a 100. We can replace this 100 with o t. And we also have a 100 over here, which we can replace this with o t. And this is the general equation for the exponential moving average at time t.
00:07:32.646 - 00:07:40.842, Speaker B: So why is this called exponential? Well, it's called exponential because all of the terms are multiplied some power of one minus alpha.
00:07:40.906 - 00:07:42.574, Speaker A: The prices that are closer to the.
00:07:42.612 - 00:08:19.982, Speaker B: Most recent price are multiplied by a small power of one minus alpha. As the price gets further and further away from the most recent price, it is getting multiplied by a bigger power of one minus alpha. For example, over here, p 98 is more recent than p 97, or p 97 is older than p 98. So it is getting multiplied by a bigger power of one minus alpha. Here we have a one minus alpha raised to the two. And here we have a one minus alpha raised to the three. And if you go further back in history, the first price, p zero, is getting multiplied by one minus alpha raised to the 100.
00:08:19.982 - 00:08:27.690, Speaker B: So this is why this is called an exponential moving average. The older the price, it is getting multiplied by a higher power of one minus alpha.
