00:00:00.330 - 00:00:34.486, Speaker A: Here's a constant product curve. X times y equals l square and the curve for the real reserves. If the price was to move from p of a to p of b, then this much amount of token X will exit the pool. In other words, for the price to move from p of a to p of b, we need this much amount of token. Next, we'll call this amount x zero. Similarly, if the price was to move from p of b to p of a, then this much amount of token Y will exit the pool. In other words, for the price to change from p of b to p of a, we will need this much amount of token Y.
00:00:34.486 - 00:01:00.974, Speaker A: We'll call this amount Y of zero. But what is the exact amount of x zero and y zero? So, in this video, we'll figure out what x zero and Y zero are. So, recall from the previous video that we derived the equation for the real reserves curve. And you see it over here. Using this equation, we'll be able to solve for x zero and y zero. Let's start by solving for x zero here. I've copied the equation from over here.
00:01:00.974 - 00:01:39.418, Speaker A: To solve for x zero, let's plug in x zero for x subar. Remember that x subar is a variable. So when x sub r is equal to x zero, when x subar is at this point, then what is the value for yr? Well, if we trace the line over here, we know that yr must be equal to zero. So when xr is equal to x zero, then yr must be equal to zero. And now we can do a simple algebra to solve for x zero. So I'm going to remove this yr. Next, I'm going to divide both side of the equation by l times the square root of p of a.
00:01:39.418 - 00:02:08.326, Speaker A: The l on the top and the l on the bottom cancels out. And finally, I'll bring this over to the right and we have our final equation for x zero. X zero is equal to l divided by the square root of p of a minus l divided by the square root of p of b. This is the amount of token x that is needed between the price ranges p of a to p of b, given the liquidity l. Okay, let's also solve for y zero. Again. We'll start by copying this equation over to the right.
00:02:08.326 - 00:02:39.386, Speaker A: And then for yr, we'll plug in Y zero. When yr is equal to Y zero, what is xr? Well, let's take a look. When yr is equal to y zero, we'll be over here and the x component will be equal to zero. So xr will be equal to zero. When yr is equal to y zero, xr will be equal to zero. So let's simplify this equation. I'll paste the code over here and then we can remove the xr and we're left with this equation.
00:02:39.386 - 00:03:14.006, Speaker A: We can divide both side of the equation. So this will come over to the right and on the right side of the equation. Now we can cancel out the l on the top and the l on the bottom. And this square root of p of b will come to the top minus l times the square root of p of a from both side of the equation. So this will come over to the right with a minus sign. Now we have that y zero is equal to L times a square root of p of b minus l times a square root of p of A. This is the amount of token Y that is needed between the price ranges p of b to p of a.
00:03:14.006 - 00:03:15.300, Speaker A: Given the liquidity l.
