00:00:00.650 - 00:00:37.978, Speaker A: The syntax for writing if and else statement in solidity is similar to a JavaScript. I'll show you a basic example, and there's also a shorthand way to write an if else statement. This is called a ternary operator. I'll also give you an example of that. Let's start off with a basic example of writing an if else statement. Here I have a function called example, and it takes in an input of u x. We will write a conditional statement saying if the input x is less than ten, then we'll return one else.
00:00:37.978 - 00:01:19.654, Speaker A: If x is less than 20, then we'll return two else, we'll return three. This is a basic example of an if else statement here. In this case, we can also omit the last else statement, so that we remove the parentheses and just return three. Whether to write your if else statement like this or like this is up to you. Next, I'm going to give you an example of a ternary operator. Here we have an if else statement. If x is less than ten, we return one else, we return two.
00:01:19.654 - 00:01:56.298, Speaker A: Using the ternary operator, we can write all of this code in one line. Let me show you how, so I'll comment this out, and to write the equivalent code as above, we say return is the input x less than ten. Question mark. If it is, then we one. Otherwise we return two semicolon and this is an example of a ternary operator. This code is equivalent to this commented out code over here. Sometimes you will have a very short, simple if else statement.
00:01:56.298 - 00:01:58.860, Speaker A: In that case, the ternary operator might be a.
