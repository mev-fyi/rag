00:00:00.330 - 00:00:23.242, Speaker A: In this video, I'll explain how to borrow and repay rye. And in the next video, I'll explain how the price of rye is stabilized. Let's start with borrowing rye. How does a user borrow rye? The first step for a user is to create what's called a vault. In rye terms, this is called a safe. Once you create your vault, the next step is to deposit ETH. Once the ETH is locked inside the vault, you can finally borrow rye.
00:00:23.242 - 00:00:47.878, Speaker A: Okay, but how much rye can we borrow? Roll. The amount of ride that you can borrow is determined by this equation. Minimum collateral ratio. This has to be equal to 135%. And this minimum collateral ratio is equal to e collateral in USD terms divided by rye debt. In USD terms, ride debt here means the amount of ride that you borrowed. Let's go over example of how much rye we can borrow.
00:00:47.878 - 00:01:16.370, Speaker A: Let's say that one e is equal to $1,685, and one rye is equal to $2.77. And let's also lock three e as collateral. So, at the current price of e and at the current price of rye, how much rye can we borrow? Let's find the maximum amount of rye that we can borrow. We'll call this r. Okay, so, our objective is to find R. And to find R, we'll be using this equation. So, what I'm going to do is copy this equation and then paste it here.
00:01:16.370 - 00:01:49.726, Speaker A: Minimum collateral ratio means that the amount of beef that we logged in USD terms over the amount of ride that we borrowed at the current market price, has to be greater than 135%. So this 135% that you see over here is the maximum amount of ride that we can borrow. So let's start with ETH. Collateral in USD. How much ETH did we lock as collateral? We locked three e. So, over here, I'll type three e. And what is the price of e? The price of EEF is 1685.
00:01:49.726 - 00:02:13.670, Speaker A: So I'll put that over here. And the maximum amount of rye that we want to borrow, that will be r. So that will be over here. I'll replace this rye debt with R. And what is the price of rye for this example? Well, it is $2.77. So this will be r times $2.77. Now, we can use simple algebra to find R.
00:02:13.670 - 00:02:46.478, Speaker A: First, I'll copy this equation and then paste it here to bring r over to this side. To the left side of the equation, I'll multiply both side of the equation by R. So this will bring r to this side, and this r will be cancelled out. So I'll just delete it. And to bring this 135% over to the right side of the equation, we'll divide both side of the equation by 135 percent. From the left side, it will be equal to one, and on the right side, it will be divide by 135%. So, I'll just bring it over here.
00:02:46.478 - 00:03:25.790, Speaker A: And that is R. R the maximum amount of ride that we can borrow at the current market price, given that we log three e as collateral, will be this number. Using my calculator, this turns out to be 5055 over $3.73 with some extra numbers. And then putting these numbers into my calculator again, I get that R. The maximum amount of dye that we can borrow is 1351.78. So, to summarize, the maximum amount of rye that we can borrow, when one e is equal to 1685 and one rye is equal to $2.77,
00:03:25.790 - 00:04:03.878, Speaker A: is 1351.78 rye. Okay, so we mentioned that the minimum collateral ratio has to be greater than 135%. But what happens if we go below that minimum collateral ratio? What happens when the collateral ratio is less than or equal to 135%? What's going to happen when your collateral ratio is less than the minimum is liquidation. Remember that e that you locked up to borrow rye? The e that you locked inside the vault to borrow rye. When a liquidation happens that ETH that you locked inside the vault will be liquidated. The protocol will take the ETH collateral that is locked inside your safe and then sell it on an auction.
00:04:03.878 - 00:04:52.594, Speaker A: So this means that when you borrow too much rye, or the price of ETH goes down, or the price of rye goes up too quickly, then you'll lose your ETH that you locked inside your vault. Okay, so let's say that you managed to avoid liquidation. You were able to maintain your minimum collateral ratio above 135%. So now how do you repay the rye back? How do you repay rye and then also withdraw your ETH collateral? You have the rye that you borrowed, and your ETH is locked inside the bolt. To get your ETH back, you first have to repay the ride that you borrowed, and plus there is some fee on the ride that you borrowed. Once you repay the ride, plus the fees to the rye protocol, then you'll be able to withdraw your ETH, and that is how you repay rye and withdraw ETH. In this video, I explained how to borrow Rye and repay Rye.
00:04:52.594 - 00:04:56.130, Speaker A: In the next video, I'll explain how the price of Ri is stabilized.
