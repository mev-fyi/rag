00:00:00.250 - 00:00:38.306, Speaker A: How do you specify the solidity compiler version inside foundry? Here I have a simple contract, and the solidity version that it targets is greater than or equal to zero 8.17. And this is the same for the counter contract, which also targets solidity version greater than or equal to zero 8.17. This is what the carrot means. This carrot means that this contract is targeting a solidity version greater than or equal to 0.8.17. But let's say that we want this contract to only target 0.8.17, nothing above exactly 0.8.17. So for this example I'm going to remove the carrot.
00:00:38.306 - 00:01:15.326, Speaker A: And now this contract will only compile first lidity 0.8.17 and I'm going to do the same for this other contract. Hello world, remove the carrot. And now how do we tell foundry that we want our solidity compiler version to be 0.8.17? The way you would do it is you will open the foundry tumble, and inside this configuration file what you will type is type sulk, underscore version, and then double quotes. And inside this double quotes we will put our solidity version. For this example we're targeting 0.8.17.
00:01:15.326 - 00:01:48.234, Speaker A: So inside here I will type 0.8.17. Okay, let's give it a try. So I'll save this file and then open my terminal and then type forge build, and the contract compiles to double check. Let's change the solidity version that we're targeting here. The contracts specify that they should be 0.8.17, but how about inside the configuration file, we target another version of solidity. For example, let's say that solidity version has to be equal to 0.8.16.
00:01:48.234 - 00:02:20.758, Speaker A: Save the file again, open the terminal, and then let's try building the contracts again. And now notice that I am getting some errors. If we take a look at the errors. For example, if you look over here it says source file requires different compiler version. The current compiler version is 0.8.16, but our contract specifies that the solidity version must be 0.8.17. It looks like our configuration file is working, so let's go fix it, close the terminal, and then again inside here I'll fix this to 0.8.17.
00:02:20.758 - 00:02:58.630, Speaker A: And that is how you specify your solidity version inside your foundry project. Next, I'm going to show you how to set the optimizer configurations. When you usually deploy a smart contract, you also specify two other settings for the compiler. These are whether to turn on or turn off the optimizer and then there's a number called Optimizer runs. This is usually set to 200. And to do that, I'll type optimizer is equal to true, we're enabling the optimizer, and then we also type optimizer underscore runs is equal to 200, and then save the file. Let's just double check.
00:02:58.630 - 00:03:28.780, Speaker A: Let's open our terminal and then try building our contract again. And the contract builds. For more configuration settings for Foundry, we can visit this website. So I'll copy this, paste it inside my browser, and this will take me to this website, the official GitHub repo for foundry. And if I scroll down and scroll down further, you'll see all of the configurations available for your foundry projects, and it has some comments on what each of these configurations are.
