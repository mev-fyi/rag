00:00:01.530 - 00:00:26.918, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Thank you for staying a little bit later for this panel. I know that it's been a pretty long day today at the conference, so our panel is going to be focused on governance. It will take an hour and I think we'll have time for some questions at the end. My name is Karina. I'm your moderator today. And a little bit about me is I have some and governance experience as well.
00:00:26.918 - 00:00:50.910, Speaker A: I was before in the growth team at Makerdao. After that I started my own consulting company. And recently, last week actually, I joined the defiant as the new head of growth. So this is me. And today we have these wonderful experts in their fields. From the web free space, we have Mohammed from Ens.
00:00:51.570 - 00:00:52.320, Speaker B: Hi.
00:00:53.570 - 00:00:57.390, Speaker A: Actually, I would love for you all to introduce yourselves.
00:00:57.890 - 00:01:12.898, Speaker B: Sure. I'm Juan Matarukulu, full stack developer in ENS. So doing pretty much everything like protocol, infrastructure, sometimes the governance tooling and everything.
00:01:12.984 - 00:01:13.620, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:13.990 - 00:01:14.980, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:01:16.070 - 00:01:57.060, Speaker D: I'm Julian Zvisovsky. I run Golem foundation. The story of Golem foundation is so complicated they will skip it here. I just mentioned that our main project is octant, which is a platform for community funding of public goods project and also revenue generating for GLM token holders. And also we did quite a lot of research of other aspects of governance for our project. But this is mostly theoretical still. You said expert, so expert does not have to have a practical experience.
00:01:57.830 - 00:01:58.820, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:01:59.590 - 00:02:22.650, Speaker C: Hi, my name is Chris, I'm from ltobit. If you don't know LTBT, you definitely should check it out, especially if you're using l two s. And as ltobit, we are delegates in many protocols, including arbitrum, optimism, hop, uniswap, and probably some more coming soon. Yeah, and I'm leading the governance. So I am the delegate from Altobit.
00:02:23.550 - 00:02:43.440, Speaker E: Hi everyone, Bianca Butte here, head of developer relations at Luxo. You saw my colleague column earlier. So Luxo is l one EVM compatible, focused on creative economies, and also founder of Devil Uni, where we teach people how to start in developer relations.
00:02:44.450 - 00:03:37.860, Speaker A: Thank you very much for this intro. And I would like to start this panel with a question that I really, really love. And the context for it is that when I started working in a dow, it wasn't even a very big thing in crypto yet, and nobody really understood what a dow is. I had to explain what the hell I'm doing to my parents. And in my case, this took an eight hour drive where everybody was locked in a car and they had nowhere to run for me to explain it to them. But I would like to ask you, how would you explain governance and dows to sort of a five year old or a parent? Because I feel like summarizing this kind of work is really important, especially if we want to expand the work that we're doing with new governance tools. Who wants to start?
00:03:40.710 - 00:04:20.910, Speaker C: I can start. So I don't think that there is a single description of the DAO because it depends on what the Dow actually is in question. However, when I describe what I'm doing, I'm simply describing that what I'm doing is coordinating and decision making within a group of people. And depending on what exactly I'm explaining, it's usually also with some stake at hand that needs to be governed. So, yeah, this is basically decision making. I think that the closest metaphor or closest something that is familiar to everybody is politics, simply. So we are experimenting with politics.
00:04:21.890 - 00:04:52.970, Speaker E: Personally, I think I would probably use an example. So I would say something along the lines like, you have a group of people, sometimes these people can be spread all over the world and they have like a common goal that they're working on. And the difference from a business, for example, a traditional business, is that no one is in charge. So instead, everyone votes. And based on the results of those votes, then they use computer software to kind of execute those choices.
00:04:54.030 - 00:05:19.970, Speaker B: So I try to explain many things to my parents, but never thought about the Dao. If I would try to explain, I think it will be not that hard because I'm living in a country that the nepotism is just super high and we have rules, but these Rules are not for everyone. So we have rulers. These rulers are quite vip.
00:05:20.470 - 00:05:21.778, Speaker A: What country is that?
00:05:21.864 - 00:05:22.558, Speaker C: Turkey.
00:05:22.654 - 00:05:23.106, Speaker A: Okay.
00:05:23.208 - 00:05:23.860, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:24.390 - 00:06:09.634, Speaker B: And what I would say probably think a world, there are rules but not rulers. And I also probably would give some sort of examples and it will be possibly from the nature, like a swarm intelligence, like how bees are working, how the fishes are working, or the ants. There are really simple rules you need to follow. There is no rulers that telling you like do this, do that, but they are just sharing all the information and all the intelligence together. When there's a food, there's a food and the rest just goes and just grab the food. So they keep living. So I think I would go with that.
00:06:09.832 - 00:06:10.642, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:06:10.776 - 00:07:05.300, Speaker D: Yeah, I really like that definition, but I don't really like the term dow. I think it is a little bit misleading, but I think it comes from the desire of our space to have ways of deciding about things. Because if you think what decentralization really is on a philosophical level, I think it is about putting the power into the hands of the people or the users in term of a software product, and then how it is implemented in a form of a governance that can be named Dao or whatever other name is the implementational detail. But this is in fact about empowering these people who are not empowered in the legacy model.
00:07:06.410 - 00:07:12.470, Speaker A: Can I ask you to elaborate? Why did you say that the term dao is misleading, in your opinion?
00:07:12.890 - 00:07:50.254, Speaker D: Because I think this term derived from the centralized autonomous organization. I believe it is more description of the technical implementation of the concept and not description of the concept itself. So you can have daos about many different things, many different governance models that would, I can imagine even Dao that would replicate some parts of the things that Muhammad does not like about turkey. So this is rather a technical cut all term.
00:07:50.382 - 00:07:51.058, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:51.224 - 00:07:59.974, Speaker D: And then what I'm fascinated about are different mechanism design, different procedures or algorithms you can use to solve governance problems.
00:08:00.172 - 00:08:46.740, Speaker A: I very much agree with that view, actually. I feel like we're in the state of the dows today. We're kind of missing the a in DaO, like the autonomous part, because we usually decentralization is about in communities, about involving a lot of people, and the autonomous part is about not involving as few people as possible for decision making. I'll also give you my own term that I use for daos for people. Normally, I just try to explain it, like, imagine if you owned a stock in Apple, but you could also see real time data on what's going on inside Apple, and you could also use that stock to vote on what should happen next in Apple. Something like this. Okay.
00:08:46.740 - 00:09:25.150, Speaker A: And then we've seen sort of the rise of the dows, maybe around 2021. We've seen a lot of communities starting, it's a little bit of a buzword as well. And I've personally seen a lot of use cases or uses where protocols or Dapps or communities don't necessarily need a dow or a governance model with onchain voting for that. What are your opinions on the actual use cases for governance voting, and when is it needed for a business ens?
00:09:29.410 - 00:10:06.480, Speaker B: So, like, it really depends on the use case, I would say. So. The ENS is a protocol, so it just applies very well when there is the governance. They're just giving a decision about how the protocol works, how the smart contracts needs to be updated because we have the upgradability of the smart contracts level. So for us, the lines are pretty clear. And probably I couldn't generalize the way how the governance should work for everyone or everything. And for ens it just works fine.
00:10:08.370 - 00:10:09.600, Speaker A: Anyone else?
00:10:11.570 - 00:10:14.094, Speaker D: The question is when do you need governance?
00:10:14.222 - 00:10:16.210, Speaker A: Yeah, when is it needed?
00:10:16.360 - 00:11:35.770, Speaker D: You always need some kind of governance. And there is a great term by Corey Doctorov which is like a called n certification of a platform. And basically the concept boils down to a notion that if the platform has too much power, then it's starting abuse that power towards the users or the clients and it becomes like a shitty platform that drives on the network effect and like a monopolistic position. And obviously you need the governance for that, probably like a governance from the users really. And what sort of governance? That of course depends on the case, but I think at some point you need that governance from the people who are most interested in the given, like a software product, like a platform protocol to prevent that thing turning against them. Because I think what we could see over many, many years of the capitalism is that companies turn against their customers whenever they can extract more profit. This model does not work well in the monopolies, in the asymmetry of information and in many other cases.
00:11:36.190 - 00:12:31.414, Speaker C: That's a good point, yeah, I basically agree. And I also agree that the term Dow is basically so overloaded and it's so cryptic that it actually creates more confusion. That helps. And for me, where do we need governors? Everywhere where we have something to govern. So interesting fact for everybody outside of Poland and outside of Warsaw is that we are actually here, right here we are inside one of the biggest daos that I have seen, because interesting fact for you is that in Warsaw we have something that is called citizens budget. So basically there is a budget reserved for citizens to decide what they want to spend it on. And citizens actually vote every year on projects like everybody can provide some idea for a project that budget should be funded with, that it should be funded from this budget.
00:12:31.414 - 00:13:18.982, Speaker C: And then citizens vote on the projects that they like and after that those projects get funded. So we have a Warsaw Dow at some kind, like with 3 million voters. And we did have dows even in software before, like 20 years ago when we were developing Linux, different kinds of Linux distribution flavors. Each of those distributions was a Dow, like when we were developing Linux pal, for example. In Poland we made decisions simply, we didn't have voting mechanisms, we didn't have smart contracts to actually automate how the decisions are being executed. But we did decisions simply on Usenet and in private email communication. But they were also dows and we were governing this public good, which was a Linux distribution.
00:13:18.982 - 00:13:35.970, Speaker C: And it's exactly what we are doing right now, for example, in optimism, arbitrum and so on, we are doing exactly the same, but we have better tools. And that's why I'm so passionate about governance, actually, because it allows us to experiment with better tools for decision making at scale.
00:13:37.350 - 00:13:47.320, Speaker A: Amazing. That's really interesting information. And about the budget that you referred to in Warsaw, this is coming from the government or the local?
00:13:48.570 - 00:13:55.458, Speaker C: I think it's from the local, like the capital government. So it's coming from the city budget.
00:13:55.634 - 00:13:56.118, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:13:56.204 - 00:13:57.960, Speaker C: I believe, but I'm not sure.
00:13:58.830 - 00:14:02.780, Speaker A: Really interesting. Bianca, do you have anything to add?
00:14:03.150 - 00:14:27.458, Speaker E: Yeah, I also agree that some sort of governance is needed, but this doesn't always mean that you need a token for that. There are other means to do that, governance. And also, I would add that a lot of the so called Taos we have nowadays, a large number of them are actually communities. So again, you don't really need a token for that.
00:14:27.624 - 00:14:51.290, Speaker A: Yeah, understandable. So let's dive a little bit deeper into different governance tools and modalities to run a governance, actually. And we have one of the biggest Daos or well known dows ens right here. And I would definitely like to hear more about the governance tools that you're using and how does your process looks like.
00:14:51.440 - 00:15:08.190, Speaker B: Sure. So the ENS Dow create, like we like ENS Dow released in eigth of November in 2021. And on that time, we did a huge airdrop.
00:15:08.770 - 00:15:09.678, Speaker A: I got it.
00:15:09.764 - 00:15:10.254, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:10.372 - 00:15:10.942, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:15:10.996 - 00:15:34.200, Speaker B: There was 137,000 addresses got the airdrop. And then just right after the Dow just started the work on the constitution, and everybody who is involved in the airdrop was eligible to just sign that constitution. So I actually want to show.
00:15:36.810 - 00:15:42.390, Speaker A: Oh, you have it? Yes, we have a constitution here, guys. This is DNS.
00:15:42.470 - 00:15:43.100, Speaker C: Wow.
00:15:43.550 - 00:15:44.202, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:15:44.336 - 00:15:45.660, Speaker C: That's a huge one.
00:15:46.110 - 00:15:52.622, Speaker B: I think 84,000 addresses signed for it.
00:15:52.756 - 00:15:53.582, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:15:53.716 - 00:16:04.450, Speaker B: Yeah. And these are just really simple rules. Like five of them, and it just tells about. It's super simple. It tells about how the ENS Dow should behave.
00:16:05.430 - 00:16:06.180, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:16:07.030 - 00:16:07.682, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:07.816 - 00:16:09.970, Speaker A: How many copies do you have of this?
00:16:10.120 - 00:16:23.906, Speaker B: I think that this was the 50, but you can download a digital copy if you want. And there is also another edition. This is just how to say, like some premium edition.
00:16:24.098 - 00:16:24.790, Speaker A: Amazing.
00:16:24.940 - 00:16:32.950, Speaker B: Yeah. So, yeah, after the constitution, we start. Just divide the people to our working groups.
00:16:33.030 - 00:16:34.300, Speaker C: I'll just leave it here.
00:16:35.150 - 00:16:38.294, Speaker A: Closer. Microphone. Closer.
00:16:38.342 - 00:16:39.420, Speaker C: Oh, sorry. Yeah.
00:16:39.890 - 00:17:27.670, Speaker B: So there are working groups, basically, they are using the regular forums like this, discuss and these other forums or other communication channels to just work about the things they need to work like the ecosystem group and the meta governance group and public good group. So each of them has their own duty and their own budgets. And for the DAO itself, we have two types of voting. The off chain voting. This is more like a social consensus voting, and we just use a snapshot for that. And then everything is kept in the ipfs and we have the on chain voting. So we call them like an executive voting.
00:17:27.670 - 00:17:55.806, Speaker B: So anything needs to be executed on the blockchain level. The people are using tully as a tool. And apart from that, as an ENS lab, we also time to time building our own tools to help the DAO to better govern or delegate the people. And currently I'm working on one project called the multi delegation manager.
00:17:55.838 - 00:17:56.740, Speaker A: What is that?
00:17:57.930 - 00:18:40.978, Speaker B: Currently, none of the delegation managers provide you the way to multi delegate the people. I have rights to votes, I have tokens, because the ENS is token weighted, basically. And in the current implementation in Openzeppelin, you just go to the delegation manager and you just pick your delegate, just only one, or you have to divide your tokens and just manage all these assets. Instead, I'm just creating a sort of smart contract that will handle all this multi delegation from one address, so you don't have to worry, like dividing your.
00:18:41.144 - 00:19:15.338, Speaker A: Watching power, basically doing it manually. Okay, interesting. Now that you started speaking about delegation, Christoph here is a delegate in different ecosystems, and we have seen actually a big rise in the demand for delegation services. We've also seen a lot of new companies offering these delegation services. Can you tell us more about how it is like to be a delegate, and what are the responsibilities of a delegate?
00:19:15.514 - 00:20:39.830, Speaker C: This is actually a very interesting question, because I believe that we need to discuss it more. What does it even mean to be a delegate? What is expected of delegates? If I'm a delegate, what should I be expected to do? And right now it's not very clear. And if you look into all those systems and look into delegates, there are sometimes random people who became a delegate because they were popular in the time of airdrop. Basically, that's the history right now. And even though we do have some, like there was this delegation week recently, which goal was to encourage people to redelegate their tokens to whoever they find more suitable than their previous delegate. But right now, I would say that there are no clear expectations of what the delegate should do. And we need to change it, basically because we need to establish expectations of what delegates should do, especially if those delegates are managing like $4 billion treasury, like in Bitroom's case, or if they decide on the future of the protocol like Optimus or a bitrum, then definitely I would expect that if somebody has a voting power, I treat this voting power that we have as a responsibility, and I experiment with different tools that allow me to actually be a better delegate.
00:20:39.830 - 00:21:38.474, Speaker C: So one thing that we recently launched and we are experimenting with is office hours. So similar as the parliamentary members that are open for the citizens to come to them and raise some issues that they have, so that they can raise it to the council. We are trying to do something like that. So right now, at this moment, we do have arbitrum office hours, for example, and my friend from the team syncus is available at Google Meet. If anybody has any issues with arbitrum, or any ideas for arbitrum that should be launched there, anybody can come to this call and tell us that. And we are actually taking it further higher in the hierarchy. But speaking about tools, I would say that the most important tools for me is telegram and Zoom and Google Meet, because of course, those voting mechanisms like tally or open separate governor contracts, these are important.
00:21:38.474 - 00:22:23.526, Speaker C: These are important, especially in our space. But governance is not about voting. Governance is about decision making and coordination for some cost. And for that, we need to use old fashioned tools like discuss things, meet in person, simply raise issues, get another people's opinions and so on. And you asked me about what is expected to be a delegate. I think that delegates should be saving for the community that they are being a delegate in. So if I'm in arbitrum, I should be doing anything I can so that I can provide the community more power and more possibilities in order to execute actions.
00:22:23.718 - 00:22:34.670, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Actually, I will ask one more question here. I'm very curious, what is the process of selecting a delegate in different ecosystems?
00:22:35.490 - 00:23:29.040, Speaker C: Well, it depends on the system, but usually it is that during some time, usually before the airdrop, there is a delegate thread on some discourse, on some forum, and people either nominate themselves or they nominate some other people. It depends from system to system. And usually there is some form, like there is some template that you have to use to say what you will be doing. But for now, all those templates lack the commitment that the person is doing. So what they will actually do. And for me, the most important thing is commitment of time, being a delegate, and really actually doing your job as a delegate. This requires a lot of time and also resources, because you don't know about everything.
00:23:29.040 - 00:24:11.760, Speaker C: Even we at altobit, we don't know everything. So there are some things that we have to ask others about, and probably maybe we should get some paid opinion. We are knowledgeable about risks in l two s and security assumptions like attack vectors and so on, but we do not know that much about economical models and economical parameters. So for that. But still we are making decisions. Like if I make a decision on an inflation of a token in a given ecosystem, how do I make the decision? I should have a budget to ask people that actually know about it to get some informed opinion on that.
00:24:12.770 - 00:25:00.210, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you. And now that we talk about delegation and governance, I just remembered at the very beginning in maker, the very first problem that we had in our DaO was that the voting ratio, or the number of voters was really low. A lot of people would own our token, but very few people would start voting. And this is why then we introduced a delegation system. So we'd have specific delegates that would say, okay, if you guys don't have time to vote, we're going to do it for you and we'll make responsible decisions. And we were always in search for ways to incentivize token holders to participate in voting.
00:25:00.210 - 00:25:08.750, Speaker A: And I know Julianne, you told us that at Golem foundation you recently found a new way to also incentivize your token holders.
00:25:09.490 - 00:26:46.960, Speaker D: Yeah, so just a we, we started, but we are in the middle of the first epoch, so we are still like testing hyper around how it's going to work at the moment. The system works like that, that you have to time lock your token like a Golem network token, and then in time you're entitled to the reward that the reward in monetary terms is similar to reward you will get from ETH staking, because this is done against the ETH we stake, and then the user can take decision whether to claim that ETH for themselves or donate them to projects. If they donate them to a public goods projects, then it gets like a matching funding from the rest of the pool of the ETH staked. And depending on the parameters, that can be even like a five to ten times as much of this match fund than what they donate. So far people are coming in locking for the first epoch, so this is still growing. We admittedly don't have that many tokens locked yet. We have about, I think a couple of hundreds of users and about like a 3% of the total token supply, although I think the number is here more important than the total supply, because you always have a lot of things that get locked in the cold, wallets, exchanges and so on.
00:26:46.960 - 00:27:57.030, Speaker D: Apart from the obvious fact that this is a monetary incentivization mechanism that you have to come and lock to have this yield. Then when the allocation windows come, when you're to take your yield, you actually have to go there and see all the projects you can donate to and decide, no, I'm not donating to those projects, I'm taking everything for myself. So this is like a first, I would say like a psychological trick that you have to make a conscious decision that I'm not self taxating myself. And in fact, the self taxating is a governance process, because that's where you decide which project will get how much. And the best part of it is that if you do not come in this like a certain window, then you do not get this reward. So you are left with nothing. And this is of course on purpose.
00:27:57.030 - 00:28:47.554, Speaker D: Then there are some other fancy mechanism on how the marginal effects work. So this is more interesting for people. They got a bigger leverage at the smaller amounts of number of tokens locked in total. So that's incentivized coming to the project to octant itself. Other thing is, as I said, this is like a time paced, so things happens in time on the regular intervals and then you can get accustomed with that. But I think at the end of the day, this is for people who are interested in that. We cannot force people into governance if they are not really interested about that.
00:28:47.554 - 00:29:35.618, Speaker D: So this is why I think things like delegation are extremely important. Perhaps we'll be doing something like that in octant in the future. But my general remark is that if you look at democracies, this is also how I think we should look at the governance. Governance is not necessarily about taking really fine grained decisions on how to do things, how to build things. People usually don't have time and don't have a competencies to do that. Western democracies are not really built around choosing the best guy to do the job. They are built around the notion of the peaceful change of the government.
00:29:35.618 - 00:30:22.994, Speaker D: So whenever people are peaced off with their government, they can induce in a peaceful way. And then if the government knows that they will be changed eventually, and there is like a rule of law, then that limits what they can do. And if that mechanism start failing, like in Turkey or in Poland or in many places, then you get into troubles. So I would say that we sometimes would need a very simple mechanism for governance to just achieve a very great result. If we only are able to build a simple mechanism with simple incentives, which is not actually the octant case. But we have some other ideas that are purely theoretical for now.
00:30:23.192 - 00:30:35.414, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you. And for everybody, in case you want to note, he was speaking about octant app. If you want to check out the app and the incentives that he was.
00:30:35.452 - 00:30:40.054, Speaker D: Speaking about, I will give like the half an hour presentation tomorrow at four.
00:30:40.252 - 00:30:42.200, Speaker A: Awesome. Yes. What time?
00:30:42.650 - 00:30:45.402, Speaker D: Excuse me, what time for 04:00 p.m.
00:30:45.456 - 00:31:31.050, Speaker A: 04:00 p.m. Be here and listen about octane app. Amazing. And actually what you said, I found this initiative quite interesting. It's similar to governments when at least in Moldova, where I'm from, the government allows me to give, I think, 2% of my taxes instead of them going to the government to donate them to a charity. Except I cannot take my taxes back in my case as a citizen. And speaking of tokens, actually, what are your opinions? Do you feel like every dao is not a dao until they have a token? Do you feel like tokens are important in Dao governance?
00:31:33.390 - 00:31:42.880, Speaker C: No, I don't think the token is necessarily one of the ogs daos, like Bolog Dao, they didn't have token, and still they were probably one of the most successful ones.
00:31:43.890 - 00:32:05.286, Speaker E: Personally, I feel like it matters a lot what type of dao it is and what does the Dao do. So for example, in daos related to the Defi world? Yeah, in most of the cases it makes sense. But for example, for a social DAO, probably you don't need a token. And for other use cases, how do.
00:32:05.308 - 00:32:15.400, Speaker A: You incentivize people then? What kind of incentives do you feel like would be for DAo participants and sort of members?
00:32:16.970 - 00:33:00.818, Speaker E: I think reputation plays an important role here. Personally, I'm bullish on daos that are coming where you can have identifiable stakeholders. And this is something that it's happening right now. You can have this with the universal profiles on Luxo, for example. So instead of having simply a key, you can have like a smart contract account. And what's interesting about that smart contract account is that you can have your identity, so you can put unlimited metadata. Basically, you can have like a profile, you can have description tags, links.
00:33:00.818 - 00:33:13.722, Speaker E: So it really allows you the flexibility to build an identity instead of only having a key. So it's much more easier to kind of build a reputation. And that's like your power.
00:33:13.856 - 00:33:34.370, Speaker A: Yeah, very good point. And this is a question for everybody. What do you feel like is the state of the daos? Right. And how do you feel about dows now and in the future? Do you have an optimistic view over how things are developing?
00:33:36.390 - 00:34:13.038, Speaker B: So maybe, in short, things are developing. That's a good thing. So I definitely see that we're going to see many other use cases for the dows and they're going to be much more easier to manage. And I always believe, for example, not everyone using computer every day. So we should definitely have this decision making much more easier as a tooling. So we have mobile phones and we should literally have the tools for it. And this is one thing and another the bad part of it.
00:34:13.038 - 00:34:45.410, Speaker B: So basically everything is unclear regarding the laws and tax liabilities and everything, or regular liabilities. So the delegates or the voters do not know if anything will happen to them after the decision. So these regulations should be in place. Then we may say more about what will be the future of the DAO.
00:34:45.570 - 00:34:47.510, Speaker A: I guess understandable.
00:34:49.930 - 00:35:07.498, Speaker D: If we replace DaO with governance, then I'm optimistic. In fact, the potential of the Ethereum as a governance tool was one of the reasons why I got interested in it back in 2014.
00:35:07.594 - 00:35:08.430, Speaker A: So amazing.
00:35:08.500 - 00:35:29.530, Speaker D: While, and I'm still waiting for something that will really scale and really work, we can see some early examples of successes. We could see a huge and really interesting failures. I don't know who in the room remembers the Dow. Not the Dow, but the Dow.
00:35:29.630 - 00:35:45.450, Speaker C: Actually, the DAO was the thing that got me into crypto. I was rejecting bitcoin previously and it was cool, but not that much. And then when I first learned about the, like, I was in, of course.
00:35:45.600 - 00:36:18.070, Speaker D: A month after Zdao was like this thing, if you don't know the story, you should check it out. And also, that was like years ago when there was like a hyperdao. I read a blog post by Vitalik, who recommended Daniel Suarez book. I think that's the name of the guy called demon. Yeah. And I read it and I thought, oh, wow, so this is what we are building. And then later, like a radical.
00:36:18.650 - 00:36:22.854, Speaker A: Sorry, is the book about governance or what is the book about?
00:36:23.052 - 00:36:26.040, Speaker D: Yeah, well, you should read it.
00:36:28.350 - 00:36:29.702, Speaker A: No spoilers.
00:36:29.846 - 00:37:35.198, Speaker D: I would say like a technological trailer, like a pretty good one. And then the next building block. For me, this necessarily was like a radical market, the book, and I think we have more or less all the building blocks in place already to start building a great governance solution. I think the problem is that we don't really have things to govern in our space. And that may sounds provocative, but I think that apart from protocols, we don't have that many great projects that are not financially oriented or for profit maximization. That would make a great governance subject. And this is why I got very much also with octant into this regenerative public school funding, because I think that's where we can experiment with the governance method and when we will figure out the next things.
00:37:35.198 - 00:37:54.980, Speaker D: I'm not saying we don't have at all the great projects to govern we have. It's one of the examples. There are many, many others. But in general, we are missing a general use cases, like a project that we would go outside of our space. And the same is true for governance because of that reason.
00:37:55.690 - 00:37:56.600, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:37:56.970 - 00:39:16.270, Speaker C: So I'm personally super bullish about dows. I already mentioned that day Dao was something that brought me into crypto. And I think that when the society learns that we are not trying to scam everyone over there, but we are actually using this technology to coordinate and to achieve something, some common cause. There are so many use cases out there around us that could actually facilitate this technology and those coordination mechanisms that I can't imagine it not happening. Actually, it is just a matter of time that people realize, okay, instead of doing those strange, stupid crowdfunding things and then non transparent, like shady processes behind the scenes of how to actually allocate those funds, we can do it in a transparent and effective way without paying everybody else to just coordinate this. From the technical standpoint, this will definitely be a big thing. And I believe that for the first time in many, many years, even centuries, we actually have the opportunity to experiment with politics on a scale with something at stake.
00:39:16.270 - 00:40:17.374, Speaker C: We are not organizing our hobbyist club. We are organizing what are we going to do with a treasury of $4 billion in a protocol? How are we actually going to use it in order to grow the ecosystem? How are we going to spend the revenue that this protocol is bringing? The thing that you are doing is amazing. You are using those funds that you have to actually experiment with intents and coordination within people. RPGF is also another example, like the citizen house in optimism that divides where the RPGF is being allocated. This is like one of the best experiments I've seen in recent years. And I'm coming from the free software and open culture movements from the early two thousand s. And one thing that we lacked at that time was actually those models to sustain those systems.
00:40:17.374 - 00:40:40.070, Speaker C: We didn't have any tools to actually make those great projects long term, and usually they were captured by huge corporations. Anything of value has been captured by corporates, and now we can do differently. I don't think that we will actually end up differently, but we at least have a chance of experimentation.
00:40:40.650 - 00:41:15.362, Speaker E: I also agree with experimentation, and I think what we're going to see, in the near future, it's kind of a shift of where decisions are being made. So right now most of the decision are still being made. Off chain snapshot is the most popular one. I think in the future we're going to kind of slowly move to on chain voting. But to do that we need to ensure kind of two things. First is like scalability of the blockchains and secondly, low fees. And I think we're working together as an ecosystem to tackle these two challenges and we're going to get there.
00:41:15.496 - 00:41:30.810, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely agree. Any last words or predictions or hopes about what do you hope would change in the state of the Dow and what do you hope to see in the future or to not see anymore?
00:41:32.910 - 00:42:12.422, Speaker C: I can start. I really hope that we'll find new processes, structures and we will experiment more with how to make those more effective. And we shouldn't be afraid of some centralization factors. For example, we shouldn't be afraid on establishing working groups, workforces to allocating budgets for specific tasks. We should experiment more like there is too much hesitance in the space of maybe let's think it through. No, let's do it. Let's try this and then if it fails, let's try that one and then this one.
00:42:12.422 - 00:42:40.880, Speaker C: And we should have much more ideas and much more discussion about it. So I'm super happy that we have a panel like this one and we should definitely have more and more of that. Yeah. And I believe that we will professionalize it a bit. We will learn how to do it in a professional, effective way, and then everybody will be shocked that we used to do it in such a random, meaningless way.
00:42:41.490 - 00:43:20.070, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, I agree. Maybe sometimes that was my experience with daos, and not just daos, but any sort of new technology that came along. There are groups that are more idealistic and they might say, like, this is not decentralized enough or this is not conforming with our ideology. But I agree that we should just experiment and test out what works and then scale from there. Thank you all very much. We have a little bit of time for questions, if anybody has any.
00:43:20.070 - 00:43:21.840, Speaker A: Oh, there. Thank you.
00:43:25.090 - 00:44:38.760, Speaker F: Hey, I have two questions. First, one is mostly related to the delegated part. So we're talking about incentives and incentivizing users to vote. If these users are being incentivized in any way and they are delegating their tokens to someone who is actually doing their work, wouldn't that tap into potentially securities or tap into how we test and wouldn't that represent a potential barrier later on, since they are buying a token for a common kind of like entity, they are expecting some type of incentive or expectation of profit, maybe incentive, and they are doing this, or they expect this through the work of someone else who would be the person voting or actively participating in this. The first question would be, what are your thoughts on this? If this might be something that might represent an obstacle, a barrier, later on, or if this is just an erroneous take. And the second question, or. Well, yeah, the second question was mostly, hold up, I have it right here.
00:44:39.850 - 00:44:43.480, Speaker A: Let's stop at the first one. First. Does anyone want to take this?
00:44:47.690 - 00:45:13.890, Speaker C: Know, one of the advantages living in Poland is that polish government couldn't even spell Howie, not even understanding it. So we don't have to care about Howie tests as much. I do see those risks, I do see this potential troubles with that, but I wouldn't hurt it much at this moment.
00:45:14.040 - 00:45:27.480, Speaker B: Probably it's going to change from state to state. So it's really hard to answer this question just directly. But as said, there is always this potential risk of.
00:45:28.890 - 00:45:33.030, Speaker F: Yeah, I guess they could also be kind of like set up in places where it's.
00:45:33.370 - 00:45:34.214, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:45:34.412 - 00:46:24.038, Speaker C: But if I, if I can add to like, I believe that this is something that we have to figure out. Of course, now we have those troubles with legislation in the US and how they don't understand what we are doing, and they're trying to basically use the old tools to our space. But I treat it as some temporary burden that will pass. Simply. I can't imagine a future in which this irrational troubles will persist. Simply, we will find a way to solve it, to explain to those who are making decisions on top of our government that we are not trying to do anything fishy. We are actually doing good stuff and we are being more efficient in coordination and decision making.
00:46:24.038 - 00:46:27.138, Speaker C: And that's what we are doing. And we are not trying to scam.
00:46:27.154 - 00:46:29.480, Speaker D: People or you're a fork us.
00:46:30.270 - 00:47:04.386, Speaker A: Yeah. I want to add here. I really agree with what he says. We see a lot of discussion with the SEC. There's a lot of confusion around dows. But I think every country will understand at the end of the day that if they don't collaborate and kind of adapt to the new times, they will lose and they will scare off a lot of businesses and big investors from their country. I'm pretty sure there's many countries already in Europe where tokenized assets and digital assets are highly regulated and everything is very clear.
00:47:04.386 - 00:47:15.350, Speaker A: And this is exactly what we need. I don't think the crypto space is running away from regulation. I think we're welcoming it in a way that we want them to understand what we're doing.
00:47:15.420 - 00:47:17.906, Speaker B: Like Christophe said, trying to find the ground.
00:47:18.018 - 00:47:19.670, Speaker A: Yeah, perfect.
00:47:19.740 - 00:47:47.522, Speaker F: Thank you. And the second question, a little more optimistic. One, what do you all think? Or do you all think account abstraction will have a big role in dows? Like maybe making easy the participation in them, or just kind of like more normies coming into the industry and seeing this as clubs that they can just vote from their phone or et cetera, and not having to interact with a wallet per se?
00:47:47.656 - 00:48:03.400, Speaker D: Account abstraction and proof of uniqueness, I think those are like two things that are really needed for the more mainstream adoption. But both of them, account abstraction is not enough.
00:48:04.010 - 00:48:28.320, Speaker B: So for me, account abstraction anyway is the UX of the usage of the blockchain, basically. So if all the features that's going to be shipped as we speak right now, but apart from that, is there anything related to Dow that account abstraction solves? I don't really know at this moment. It's super early.
00:48:30.050 - 00:48:59.130, Speaker E: Personally, I think that with account abstraction, as you said, more newbies will come to the space because it's going to be so much easier to onboard them. They don't need to know about stuff like seed phrases or fearing that they're going to lose their account. So I think once we solve these problems with account obstruction, naturally they're going to be interested about daos and other forms of governance.
00:49:01.150 - 00:49:02.780, Speaker A: Thank you for the question.
00:49:03.630 - 00:49:50.230, Speaker G: Hi, my name is Wukesh. I got a question about what do you think about the prospects of using the models, the lessons learned in the Daos that you participate in, to extend those lessons learned to other things that can be governed, other goods, other processes, other public goods than those related to technology, to tokens, to technological infrastructure. So how do you see the prospects of expanding the Dow processes to, like, a real world goods or objects?
00:49:52.650 - 00:49:54.358, Speaker A: Can you summarize the question?
00:49:54.444 - 00:49:54.646, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:54.668 - 00:51:02.560, Speaker G: Okay, so this is my problem. So sometimes I try to explain to normies about the blockchain and crypto world to show them that it's not just about the multiplication of capital, it's about decentralization, about consensus. And I try to show the examples of gitcoin, for example, or now octant, and show them that these are the ways of efficient funding goods, efficient funding of public goods. And I'm being asked at this point what kind of goods are being found? And I'm saying, well, protocols, technology, infrastructure. The answer is, well, basically, again, the space is basically finding itself so my question is, how can these mechanisms that you are working on, what are the prospects of actually using them to efficiently governing other goods, like goods outside of the blockchain space?
00:51:06.230 - 00:51:51.310, Speaker E: When I heard your question, I also thought about gitcoin and quadratic voting. I think this is a very interesting mechanism of basically putting the power into the hands of many instead of the hands of the most wealthy ones. So basically, to describe briefly about quadratic voting, it gets quadratically more expensive for a certain person to add an additional vote. So you incentivize basically the crowd to have a say. And I think this model can be used externally as well, like to fund other public goods. For example, right now you don't really get to say how your tax money goes and what gets funded and what doesn't.
00:51:54.290 - 00:52:19.762, Speaker D: Exactly. I don't think a mechanism we are experimenting with or others are experimenting with in the space are like a blockchain specific. So you easily imagine applying those techniques outside of blockchain. And in fact it is happening. So in both ways, quadratic voting is not originally the blockchain native concept, which was adapted from outside.
00:52:19.916 - 00:53:27.006, Speaker C: Yeah. And I believe that if anybody in this audience worked with ngos in their experience, they know how hard it is to actually get funding for ngos. And this is like, in my opinion, it's a perfect matching so that we can actually fund those organizations that are doing great job for us. But right now they are struggling with getting banks to accept donations, recurring donations. It's super awful and troublesome. So that's why they're usually reliant on government grants, for example, which in our country we know that it tends to be problematic if the government is not really cooperating. So yeah, I believe that right now the biggest struggle we have is the public perception of crypto, because I'm working with a lot of ngos in Poland and I would love them to use crypto in order to fund what they're doing.
00:53:27.006 - 00:54:19.230, Speaker C: I don't know if polls from the audience know the project like this project, I am biased because I was co funding it, but this is a great project that is doing so much good and it struggles to get funding year after year. And probably we could fund like ten years of existence of this project just by a single gitcon round so those tools will be used. But I would also say that it can go other way around as well. Here in dows, we can learn so much more for the real world coordination techniques and how we gather around specific topics, how politics is actually being done. We should learn from each other on both sides.
00:54:20.610 - 00:54:21.920, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
00:54:23.090 - 00:54:52.630, Speaker H: Yeah, just maybe one sentence. It's a bit weird because I wanted to answer the previous question rather than ask a new one, but I thought about this a lot, and one of the things I am excited about is the idea of actually computer games being created and managed and expanded by the dows, right. Because there are a lot of abandoned ware games that nobody picked up, or there are some games that people create but just leave later. I can imagine a dow where people vote on code changes. Like there's new levels, new graphics, et cetera.
00:54:52.710 - 00:54:53.350, Speaker B: Factorio.
00:54:53.430 - 00:54:54.154, Speaker H: If it goes through.
00:54:54.192 - 00:54:56.138, Speaker B: Sorry, Factorio. One exam.
00:54:56.224 - 00:55:14.946, Speaker H: Yeah, for example. Right. And then if enough voting goes, then the code can be actually pushed through to actually have a new version of the game. Right? So I can imagine this kind of thing where there's no company behind the game, just the community, and by voting, they actually go forward. Like for example, tezos, which the patches to the source code are actually voted for and going forward, but.
00:55:14.968 - 00:55:39.560, Speaker C: Sorry, just wanted to comment, actually, Austin Griffith was experimenting with this idea, and he created this game in which players could vote on changing the mechanics of the game. So imagine civilization, multiplayer civilization game, where you can actually vote on, I don't know, taxes or vote on the cost of technologies and so on and so on. There is so much potential there.
00:55:41.050 - 00:55:49.090, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Our time is out. Thank you all for coming and listening, and thank you to all of our speakers for this discussion.
00:55:49.250 - 00:55:49.734, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:55:49.772 - 00:55:50.620, Speaker C: Thank you. Thank you.
