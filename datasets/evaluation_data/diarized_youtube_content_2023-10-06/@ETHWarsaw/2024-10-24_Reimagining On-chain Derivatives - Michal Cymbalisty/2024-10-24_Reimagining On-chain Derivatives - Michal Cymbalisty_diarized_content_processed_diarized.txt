00:00:03.480 - 00:00:38.699, Speaker A: Awesome. What's up everyone? I'm Michael from Domination Finance and we're reimagining on chain derivatives in a little bit different of a way than you guys are used to. Bear with me, I'm going to give a super quick primer on Dex's AMM's order books just to give everyone good working knowledge. Obviously a Dex is a peer to peer swap market built on a blockchain user exchange crypto for another one. And I would say it was really Defi's true use case. I don't know when everyone got into the industry, but Dexes have been around actually before Uniswap, Ether Delta was probably the first one and they used what was called an order book. So ether Delta was 2016, 2017 era UX was shit.
00:00:38.699 - 00:01:09.045, Speaker A: But order books are how they function and it's actually how all centralized exchanges work. So you pretty much have a list of open, you know, buy and sell orders by price and then order matching systems execute trades and obviously based on how that's done determines the efficiency and robustness of an exchange. Centralized exchanges really, really good at doing that. It's why everyone was on Binance, Poloniex, Bitfinex back then. Ether Delta was doing this on chain and it kind of sucked because gas was expensive. No one used that. There was huge slippage and for those of you not familiar, this is what it looked like.
00:01:09.045 - 00:01:46.037, Speaker A: And these are six hour candles by the way. So you can see the slippage is pretty atrocious and it was really an unusable experience. But it kind of paved the way for what I would call call True Defi, which was really obviously Uniswap with the amm, but it didn't start there. Automated market makers are obviously the style we're kind of used to seeing today. They're a little bit different than order books, which is kind of ironic because centralized exchanges still operate on order books and we're seeing on chain exchanges go there. But Uniswap really took off creating bonding curves, right? They managed the price by increasing the swap rate every time a token is removed from the pool. And it was really cool because anyone can participate.
00:01:46.037 - 00:02:09.721, Speaker A: Obviously back in 2020, 2019, this is why everyone got excited. The history of AMMs though, people think it's Uniswap, but it was actually Bancor. I don't know if any OGs remember it. They paired every single token that was created against bnt. So kind of the thing where we looked at and we're like, all right, damn, Ethereum is volatile. There's impermanent loss. They took it one step further and paired it with their altcoin.
00:02:09.721 - 00:02:43.295, Speaker A: So people really didn't love that. But obviously it paved the way for Uniswap V2 and that's where we get the constant product. Obviously this has kind of kick started a huge high timeframe trend of more and more volume moving to Dexes from centralized exchanges, both spot and derivatives. Quite obvious stuff, right? So diving into derivatives, for those of you that don't know, it's effectively a financial instrument that is derived from the value of an underlying asset index or rate that's let people speculate on things without necessarily needing to hold them. Right. I want to speculate on oil. It's really annoying if I need a custody of the barrels.
00:02:43.295 - 00:03:21.857, Speaker A: It's good for speculation hedging if you hold an asset. And obviously leverage trading which is probably the most common use case. It's hands down the most common way I would say to trade in crypto most volume even on centralized and decentralized exchanges is coming through derivatives around 70% based on the recent month. And as we see on chain has really taken off in the last two years. Back here in like late 21 I would say it was only really DYDX and we've obviously had an influx of users and actually broke 300 billion in March of this year when markets were hot. But this is probably going to be up and to the right and a primer on perps. This is the most common type of derivative you see.
00:03:21.857 - 00:03:55.027, Speaker A: If you guys are traders you'll be super familiar with it. It's obviously you can keep it open perpetually because it doesn't have an expiration date as long as you're not liquidated. And obviously the funding and borrow rates have an influence there. Use the balance OI just to make sure people can actually get filled at a reasonable rate. And this is what we're kind of seeing in the industry right now. So the reason I kind of prefaced AMMs and order books is we're actually seeing a combination of all these models coming on chain. Obviously I think order books are going to be inevitable for the long long term on chain and with recently hyperliquid kind of stealing a lot of mind share and a lot of volume.
00:03:55.027 - 00:04:27.317, Speaker A: It's kind of being the proven thesis. But a lot of these other models create some really cool perks. So obviously order books are still super constrained by gas prices. You want to be able to have bid ask spreads, you want to have market makers or market making strategies Adjust dynamically and cheaply. If it's happening truly on chain, it's going to be really damn expensive. So that's why it's really, really hard to have this on like lower performant, lower throughput chains having fully on chain order books there. I don't know if will ever happen just because the frequency at which market makers or automated strategies need to adjust it will not work.
00:04:27.317 - 00:05:16.795, Speaker A: But we're seeing some really, really cool solutions obviously in the likes of Solana and especially Injective Hyperliquid and DYDX with the app chain model. A couple of these other ones though provide some really, really cool use cases. Obviously spot AMMs and like using leverage is really cool because you can use something like Gearbox to actually get like spot leverage in a truly decentralized fashion, which is all really damn cool. And you have a bunch of these other, you know, obviously aggregators in play and then Oracle based derivatives which let us trade some really cool things. As long as there's a price feed available. Obviously there you're still dealing with the task of having fragmented liquidity because you pretty much either need to do what GMX V2 is doing where you have a pool per pair or you aggregate it all under the hood, which is really common in like vams and Oracle based models. Baskets of assets kind of introduce the same impermanent loss solution.
00:05:16.795 - 00:06:08.733, Speaker A: But all of this really comes down to the fact that we've reached the state where the innovation in derivatives is taking place and how liquidity is provided, which don't get me wrong, is really damn important. I just think there's a lot of people that are doing that really, really damn well and we're going to reach a breaking point where it's going to become kind of a chicken or the egg match, it's going to be a fee race to zero because traders are going to go where it's cheap and they can get filled with the lowest slippage and liquidity. Most volume is still happening on BTC and ETH and those derivatives and there's only a handful of places, you know, forget the airdrop hunting, forget the points, forget the farming, the games, they're just going to go either to a centralized exchange or to something. Now realistically, hyper liquid DYDX and trade for the low because they're getting filled really well, every single thing. It seems redundant because it honestly is like I said, most volumes on BTC and Ethan. That's what we're seeing. And we have the liquidity models and Oracles constraining what they can even offer.
00:06:08.733 - 00:06:53.711, Speaker A: So like, how do derivatives evolve from here? And I think that's where what we're doing at domination finance comes into play. So at a super high level we're introducing the concept of dominance trading. I would also say for a lot of crypto we've been porting Tradfire Web 2 into Web 3, right. RWAs were tokenizing treasuries, you know, ave money markets on chain, Uniswap the stock exchange on chain. This is something where I had the inklings of it from my past time outside of crypto, but I realize is really applicable in both places. So from a high level you can speculate on the market share, not the price that gives it market agnostic durability. It's relevant when there's upward pa, downward PA crab markets because you're literally betting on a project.
00:06:53.711 - 00:07:30.455, Speaker A: Assets tokens dominance. Right? So what does that look like? Obviously bitcoin dominance might have come to mind as I was talking through for most of you, it's where I actually got the idea because I saw this charted all the time, but you couldn't trade it anywhere. Traders on Twitter were referencing it, they were talking about macro cycles, portfolio rotations, referencing this metric, but no one actually did it. And I like to joke that this stems from like literally 6th grade algebra. Like it's Bitcoin's market cap over total crypto. But the use case is damn cool because you have dominance moving when bitcoin doesn't and vice versa. Bitcoin can move a lot and dominance will creep forward, which provides some obviously really cool hedging opportunities.
00:07:30.455 - 00:08:07.849, Speaker A: So this bucket is what I call market cap dominances. We're going to be launching with a top five by market cap and I would say it's comfortably the currently most commonly referenced type of dominance pair. Really simple calculation, you have the assets market cap over total crypto. This seems super rudimentary. So like why has no one done it? It's because this total market cap comes with a lot of differing opinions in the space. You go on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap and Trading View, you're going to see a significantly dominance. Ever different dominance everywhere because Trading View is doing like 125 that they snapshotted when they listed it.
00:08:07.849 - 00:08:54.165, Speaker A: CoinGecko is doing every single coin they support, whereas CoinMarketCap is doing every coin they support. And Binance even has like a bastardized pair that trades as an index. So instead of trading as 58% it trades as like 2232 which is also such an abstract thing to make dominance. So what we're doing is obviously not only having built an exchange, but we're actually curating all of this Data at a 10 millisecond latency with our own custom methodology that we want to make industry standard because that's something that's missing from being able to get this thing on order books where we've already talked with some market makers and obviously this is something that's never been traded. No one's done this. The only way to do it is via a pool, which is why I broke it down that way. But long term we hope to be the source of truth and introduce a brand new way to trade in crypto and out.
00:08:54.165 - 00:09:24.887, Speaker A: So market cap may not be that exciting, but I guess sector dominances you can call them are where we've heard a lot of interest from our discussions behind the scenes. We can effectively invent index like exposure to categories within crypto, right? Like let's say you want to be long AI on its dominance or market share. You can create a basket of coins, right? Whatever. Render tao a cash and peg that against the whole crypto market so you don't even need there to be upwards price movement. Like let's just say they dropped less. You would have done great if you were long meme dom. You would have made a bunch of money.
00:09:24.887 - 00:10:02.931, Speaker A: Even though USD prices could be down 70%. So it creates some really cool opportunities to adapt to any narrative across any cycle. All you need is to pretty much have like an agreed upon numerator and denominator and you can create dominance of anything, which our Oracle already has the capabilities to do. We can plug in any type of data on both sides, calculate it, stream it real time and have a tradable on our exchange. So it really is unlocking the speculation of a lot of uninvestable or non traditional asset classes. One people have really liked here that we've talked to is Tether's dominance of stablecoins, for example. So you would have Tether's market cap over a basket of other stables, whatever, take the top six.
00:10:02.931 - 00:10:37.733, Speaker A: You don't even need a bet on a dpeg. You can literally bet on stablecoin flows. So it's really cool because you don't really need stablecoin insurance, but you can be betting that you know Athena's market cap is going to grow even though you know their price may have dropped 80% while their market cap tripled, which is something we literally saw play out. So it really tightens the loop between Speculation and fundamentals and lets people bet on market share directly of underlying metrics. Here are a couple you actually already see on Defi llama like this is hidden in plain sight across the board. You can have, you know, chain link dominance of total value secured or path or Redstone etc. Etc.
00:10:37.733 - 00:11:09.024, Speaker A: There's sometimes limited ways to really get financial upside when wanting to be speculative on the tech, right? Like for example with pith I could have been bullish on them for four years and what I would need to have done is use pith powered dapps. That's not really great. I would love to have had a way to go wait. I really like what they're doing. It's different than chainlink. This is going to be a more used standard in the industry and I want to be able to long their market share of the fundamental fundamental metric they're improving. And obviously you can use stuff like TVL, transaction count, etc.
00:11:09.024 - 00:11:38.345, Speaker A: For Ethereum L2s and things along those lines. And as I briefly mentioned, no one's really done this yet because it's not provided by any existing Oracles. As a founder of a Perpetux, I'll tell you the playbook and why there's so many forks. You guys probably saw come out. You go you for GMX or gains network based on the type of model you want. You go with chainlink, path, redstone, etc. Aka your oracle and then just slap on all these fees into your exchange and you're trading what the Oracle offers.
00:11:38.345 - 00:12:19.453, Speaker A: There's not that much legwork that needs to be done. It's actually really low hanging and I think most people could fork a per tax in like one to two weeks if you're a relatively seasoned developer. And then the other is that on the dominance calculations that exist in the industry there's a really large discrepancy as I mentioned between Coingecko, Coin, Market cap, trading, view etc. Ak, there's no data standard for this type of metric. So what we've done was obviously thought of the derivative class. This is something that is hidden there in plain sight and that traders are actually utilizing as an indicator but not able to trade directly, which we're going to change. We built our own Oracle to calculate and publish this stuff real time at a 10 millisecond latency and incubated the perp decks which is actually the way users will interact with it.
00:12:19.453 - 00:12:47.581, Speaker A: This will probably be the first place to trade it on chain long term. We do hope to open up the data for Other people to integrate and build other cool products like options, prediction markets, etc. But this is our live test right now. As you see it mimics the feel of an on chain or centralized exchange. Hopefully you've got stop losses, take profits, leverage sliders. This is how people will get accustomed to trading dominance. You can't really have it be in an abstract form and obviously it kind of plays into the narrative of most activity is on BTC and eth.
00:12:47.581 - 00:13:07.415, Speaker A: So we could probably expect some trickle through on this side. And obviously you guys may be thinking like oh, dominance doesn't really move that much. The appeal really changes just based on what this number is. Everyone knows traders chase that. So if you guys want you can follow us on Twitter. Check out our testnet today. We'll probably be launching on Mainnet late October, early November.
00:13:07.415 - 00:13:18.375, Speaker A: And that's how we're reimagining derivatives. Not by how liquidity is provided by, but what you can actually trade one slide back. Yeah, no worries.
00:13:22.035 - 00:13:23.497, Speaker B: Awesome, awesome.
00:13:23.561 - 00:13:24.577, Speaker A: Really interesting chat there.
00:13:24.601 - 00:13:28.845, Speaker B: I think there's some really cool things that can be done with this. Does anyone have any questions?
00:13:29.305 - 00:13:30.085, Speaker A: Yes.
00:13:31.545 - 00:13:35.805, Speaker B: This obviously tax nothing with central exchanges. Right?
00:13:36.185 - 00:13:39.345, Speaker A: Yeah. Like eventually. Yes. Though hopefully.
00:13:39.465 - 00:13:43.325, Speaker B: So then you might run into BMR territory.
00:13:44.465 - 00:13:45.569, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:13:45.737 - 00:13:58.955, Speaker B: That's the only thing I'm a bit great. Genuinely can get it good hedges. Well, for certain instances. I'm just kind of worried about the calculation part.
00:13:58.995 - 00:14:00.075, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:14:00.235 - 00:14:04.451, Speaker B: Is there like an independent data provider for you or you guys.
00:14:04.603 - 00:14:16.125, Speaker A: So we're doing it now but we've looked at others. Right. And what we're doing now is we're going in direct from websocket from a lot of exchanges, centralized and decentralized and doing the top 200 well.
00:14:16.425 - 00:14:18.561, Speaker B: And we are actually.
00:14:18.633 - 00:14:19.325, Speaker A: I know.
00:14:20.065 - 00:14:38.921, Speaker B: So it's not that easy I'm afraid. Right. That's why we have three math professors that will do that stuff. Right. The outliers are there like especially if you go like Kraken and the rest of the market have it like over this year. Right. We're cracking for a whole half a day trades 5% off bloody Bitcoin.
00:14:38.953 - 00:14:40.165, Speaker A: Right, right, right.
00:14:40.875 - 00:14:48.403, Speaker B: So I'm just more. Will you publish them like a paper kind of how you determine it. So it's kind of.
00:14:48.459 - 00:14:51.211, Speaker A: Yeah. Our methodology is going to be transparently in the docs. Yeah.
00:14:51.243 - 00:15:01.851, Speaker B: Because that's the other thing. I mean I think for to get trust in these type of things. That's why most exchanges take an external data provider. The reason because like it can't Be manipulated.
00:15:01.923 - 00:15:02.875, Speaker A: For sure. For sure.
00:15:02.915 - 00:15:13.207, Speaker B: So that's the only thing. Definitely the product per se is phenomenal. Right. It's clearly, clearly something that makes sense. But I will still kind of. I would at least have you consider.
00:15:13.351 - 00:15:27.191, Speaker A: For sure. No, no, for sure. It's a super iterative process. Right. And it's one of those things where there is no standard. Right. Like I wish there was some cutoff and we could see some redundancy across like some of these data aggregators because that's where we stemmed from and had our MVP.
00:15:27.191 - 00:15:30.915, Speaker A: And we've talked with like Geico, CoinMetrics, etc.
00:15:31.695 - 00:15:35.125, Speaker B: Yeah, it's for finite tokens.
00:15:35.585 - 00:15:35.945, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:35.985 - 00:15:49.953, Speaker B: Bitcoin is doable, but like if something all the time then it's but what you can do. And that's kind of what people do when they do build derivatives or perks on Litecoin. You can have a cutoff and have as you said, the 200.
00:15:50.009 - 00:15:50.625, Speaker A: Yep.
00:15:50.785 - 00:15:55.345, Speaker B: Which could be tricky to kind of keep up if you allow.
00:15:55.465 - 00:16:25.485, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So what we're doing now is we're cross referencing with Coingecko for like supply and other providers there. But we have like a heart heartbeat on the circulating supply where then cross references the 200 and then what we're pulling in and does like a full 200 match. But you need a cutoff. Right. That's why we chose to go with a cutoff. And it's weird because it's one of those things where you think there would be like hard opinions on what is total crypto Market Cap, but it's not because like as you guys know at Kaiko, Coingecko and Coin Market Cap, their percentages different by.
00:16:25.485 - 00:16:31.829, Speaker A: Differ by a lot because it's just based on what they list. Like it's just blanket with all due respect to the.
00:16:31.957 - 00:16:32.493, Speaker B: These two.
00:16:32.549 - 00:16:39.941, Speaker A: Right, yeah. As well. Right, right, right.
00:16:40.013 - 00:16:43.437, Speaker B: Because we actually built for like the next step of this whole thing.
00:16:43.461 - 00:16:54.741, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. More than happy to have chats in that direction because also I've talked with, I think I've actually talked to someone from your team. We've talked with like the Thai coin metrics, like more, more institutional grade. But yeah, no one was doing it. No, no, yeah.
00:16:54.853 - 00:17:00.393, Speaker B: I don't think we do it per se. We couldn't do it because we have the index. We can't make a hard cut.
00:17:00.449 - 00:17:00.969, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:17:01.017 - 00:17:05.161, Speaker B: But that's why we struggle to publish market.
00:17:05.233 - 00:17:33.594, Speaker A: Right, right, yeah, yeah. So that discussion we're super open to and obviously like on this side we would love to be the brand affiliation for the trusted source of the data and how we're publishing it is decentralized. We've built out like an Oracle network under the hood too which is kind of annoying but had to be done right, because you can't stream the single source. You guys can be institutional grade if we're only going from caico single source, like God forbid your web socket or API goes down. Like the Oracle is kaput, which is tough as well.
00:17:33.674 - 00:17:34.394, Speaker B: We have all.
00:17:34.514 - 00:17:44.674, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, perfect. Yeah, a hundred percent. Love that though. Love that. Yeah. What's the architecture of the. It's so it's like the VAM liquidity vault.
00:17:44.674 - 00:18:14.631, Speaker A: Right? Because market makers don't have strategies to offset their risk. Most market makers, when you're going on the institutional side will have like multiple venues. They'll be able to hold spot, go short here. There's no underlying spot like this doesn't exist. So anyone can come in. We'll probably have a couple of vaults for Mainnet but maybe like a yield accruing stable or like a wrapped ETH variant and then LPs deposit that and traders use the same thing to trade. So we can spin up as many vaults as we want, but we'll probably concentrate liquidity in one or two.
00:18:14.631 - 00:18:42.589, Speaker A: Yeah, it's super similar to like gains network if you're familiar with them. Yeah, yeah, very similar to gains. Like super similar in that sense. It's one liquidity pool which services all the trading and then the way you do risk parameterization is you kind of limit how much like exposure you have per pair in relation to the pool. Stuff like that. So there's a bunch of like risk profiling that goes into these models. But yeah, it's the tldr you were.
00:18:42.637 - 00:19:20.855, Speaker B: Saying that you are trying to like move from thread by to defi. And you also mentioned basically this derivative. You can have derivative on anything that you have a stable data and you are making this derivative on dominance parameter metric are like institutional players from thread 5 from current DeFi interested in this kind of trading instrument because like they used to they are using derivatives on token prices. But I didn't heard hear that anybody like use derivative.
00:19:21.195 - 00:19:23.491, Speaker A: Yeah, well you can't trade it anywhere literally.
00:19:23.563 - 00:19:34.307, Speaker B: That's the thing that's my question is your positioning. You are like hoping for retail users right now, not like institution.
00:19:34.411 - 00:19:58.161, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to be a combo of both. We speak to some institutions that are heavily active on chain. Obviously it's starting there. So any institution that's only on centralized exchanges kind of goes out, but we've gotten a lot of. It's like retail and I would call sophisticated on chain institutions that come in. And even then for like larger whales or institutions to get filled, like it kind of needs to be a flywheel where you can take a relatively large position with low slippage. Right.
00:19:58.161 - 00:20:16.719, Speaker A: So it's chicken or the egg to start, especially for something brand new. But ultimately the bet is. Yeah. That this type of trading will take off at the point we're going to start as the monopoly of it centralized or decentralized. Hopefully can get the data provision as robust and industry standard as possible. We would love this thing to be on like Binance and Bybit perps in two years. Like that would be awesome.
00:20:16.719 - 00:20:36.055, Speaker A: Right. Like it's a chance to create a brand new way to trade that isn't something where I looked at, you know, the stock market and went, oh, this would be super cool to trade in crypto. Like it was like this market share concept makes a lot of sense and people do it subconsciously. People already referenced this metric to rotate. Why not give the ability to speculate on it directly?
00:20:38.195 - 00:20:44.791, Speaker B: Any other questions? Sorry, you mentioned like five first instruments that you plan to launch with.
00:20:44.883 - 00:20:51.383, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's very simple. It's just the top five coins by market cap, so.
00:20:51.439 - 00:20:59.967, Speaker B: All right. And then I understand that the next iteration might be like indexes for subsections of the market. Yeah, like AI memes.
00:21:00.031 - 00:21:19.911, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. Lots of things to do as well though. You know, you could do like Lido's dominance of stake thief, Jito's dominance of stake soul. Really anything we can get the data curated for in a trusted enough fashion that there's, you know, desire for. We would love to have trade, which is why we hope to get buy in long term from the community. Right. Because like governance is a meme.
00:21:19.911 - 00:21:28.635, Speaker A: But like here if you have a really good idea, like eventually we want people to be able to come in and kind of like mad lib style dominance and then you could just trade exactly what you create.
00:21:28.975 - 00:21:32.759, Speaker B: So the model is roughly following transfer indexes in that sense.
00:21:32.807 - 00:21:34.399, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. It's a good account.
00:21:34.527 - 00:21:38.503, Speaker B: Will you publish like a weighted composition as well or.
00:21:38.679 - 00:21:41.515, Speaker A: Yeah, that's all very possible. Yeah.
00:21:42.175 - 00:21:45.175, Speaker B: The beauty of it being in crypto, you can have that real time, Right?
00:21:45.215 - 00:21:45.887, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:46.071 - 00:21:56.191, Speaker B: And public real time. So once, once you like what you don't have in traditional finance, you have like whatever S P calculations. That's. That's once a day.
00:21:56.223 - 00:21:56.783, Speaker A: Right, Right.
00:21:56.839 - 00:21:58.311, Speaker B: And this thing can be real time.
00:21:58.383 - 00:22:02.355, Speaker A: Yeah. Which is sweet more transparent methodology.
00:22:03.865 - 00:22:08.753, Speaker B: You mentioned TVL based indexes, but would you expect to be counterpart for these.
00:22:08.849 - 00:22:16.321, Speaker A: Indexes on the actual exchange? Sure.
00:22:16.433 - 00:22:23.965, Speaker B: So how do you expect to price these derivatives? Because try to imagine find counterparty to match, for example.
00:22:26.665 - 00:22:49.479, Speaker A: Yeah. So the counterparties are the LPs here, which obviously is offset with like borrow fees and like to their liquidity providers. Unless traders are losing. Right. Really badly, which most do over time. Like that's the whole reason exchanges make money. If traders didn't lose historically, exchanges would be out of business a lot of the time.
00:22:49.479 - 00:23:02.459, Speaker A: Right. So. So the PNL charts tend to go that way. But yeah, obviously it's going to be the first party to incentivize. Right. And this is going to come later and it's going to have a lot of risk where we're only going to expose let's 0.5% of the vault.
00:23:02.459 - 00:23:05.987, Speaker A: So you take it in steps based on per pair performance plus that there.
00:23:06.011 - 00:23:11.763, Speaker B: Should be a natural deviation between the index ultimately and reality like it is, you know.
00:23:11.819 - 00:23:12.195, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:12.275 - 00:23:13.195, Speaker B: Traditional ETFs.
00:23:13.235 - 00:23:13.651, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:13.763 - 00:23:18.571, Speaker B: And someone like a citadel whatever kind of would just go there and take the art.
00:23:18.723 - 00:23:19.415, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:20.395 - 00:23:25.763, Speaker B: Why you can't use just for example top hundred coins because it's a very skewed distribution.
00:23:25.819 - 00:23:29.813, Speaker A: Yeah. We're doing top 200. That's exactly what we're doing. So we're capping it too. Yeah.
00:23:29.949 - 00:23:33.261, Speaker B: Because it's much more simpler because I.
00:23:33.293 - 00:24:03.403, Speaker A: Expect duration between 100 and 200 to like 250. It actually is larger than you think. But yeah, that's why we didn't go you know, top thousand because then it doesn't matter and you're just increasing like the computational intensity of everything you're doing. And realistically part of the thought process here was have it mirror trading view more or less similarly because it's the reference that people are already charting. Right. So you want, when you're introducing something so new, like a brand new way to trade, you want at least there to be a sense of familiarity. Which is why we want the exchange to feel very similar.
00:24:03.403 - 00:24:19.935, Speaker A: Right. From a interface standpoint. But we also honestly want the index to mirror trading view similarly ask just so there's not a huge discrepancy. Right. Because that's where people are going to do dominance ta right now. But that's all like more psychological user components. Right.
00:24:21.595 - 00:24:31.251, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you so much. Now it's lunchtime. If, if we turn. Sorry. Another round of applause. This is actually something way of thinking.
00:24:31.283 - 00:24:33.155, Speaker A: About the new way of.
