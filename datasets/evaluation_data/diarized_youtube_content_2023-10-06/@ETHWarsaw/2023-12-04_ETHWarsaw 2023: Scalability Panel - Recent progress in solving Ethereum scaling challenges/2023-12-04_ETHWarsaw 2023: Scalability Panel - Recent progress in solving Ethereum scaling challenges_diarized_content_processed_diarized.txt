00:00:00.090 - 00:00:00.638, Speaker A: Are there?
00:00:00.724 - 00:00:22.746, Speaker B: Okay. Hello? Hello, can everyone hear me? I'm being told that there will be a graphic coming up. I'm not sure what it will be about. I hope it will be the pretty pictures of all of us. My name is Piotr. I'm from L Two Beat, and I would like to welcome every one of you to this Panel. We're going to talk about recent progress in solving ethereum scalability challenges.
00:00:22.746 - 00:00:34.422, Speaker B: And I think we have some Fantastic Panelists tOday. So I hope you all will enjoy the Panel. And I would like each and every one of you to now introduce yourself quickly. You and your PRoject. Marcus, you're first.
00:00:34.476 - 00:00:37.494, Speaker C: Sure. Hi, I'm Marcus. Can you hear me okay?
00:00:37.612 - 00:00:39.734, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe like a little closer.
00:00:39.862 - 00:00:45.580, Speaker C: Hi, I'm Marcus. I'm with Tyco. Tyco is a type one Zke EVM. Roll Up.
00:00:46.670 - 00:01:00.640, Speaker A: Oh, hi, everyone. My name is Patrick McCrory. I work at the Arbitrum Foundation. I'm supposed to focus on research and education, so this panel is really relevant. But recently I focused a LOT of TimE on GovErNance and working with the Dow, which is also his own Fun, unique experience.
00:01:02.850 - 00:01:17.430, Speaker D: Thank you. Hi, everyone, I'm Esteban. I work for metal labs. I'm a community manager at Metal Labs. The team behind ZK sync. ZK sync is a type four ZkVM. And yeah, I've been also studying and completing my PhD in studying online communities.
00:01:18.570 - 00:01:33.740, Speaker E: Hello, I'm orest. I'm an engineer at scroll, just following the order. Scroll is a type two Zkevm. But what that means for you as a dev is that you can copy paste your code and it should just work.
00:01:34.990 - 00:01:50.240, Speaker B: Okay, thank you. And now I think we'll just start with a warm up question to get us started. What, in your opinion, are the biggest challenges that Ethereum is facing right now in terms of scalability? And feel free to pick it up in any order.
00:01:53.410 - 00:02:32.960, Speaker E: I have an answer, a non conventional one, is that the biggest challenge, in my opinion, is actually not a technical one, but rather one that has to do with the meta level, as in we are still in a super, super early stage and we are in a niche of a niche of a niche. And so just alone, this leads to this situation where there's a huge shortage of talent, a huge shortage of users, and in the end, also not really big mass of use cases. And so that kind of bottlenecks the development, the pace of development of this space a lot.
00:02:35.330 - 00:03:19.542, Speaker A: Yeah, I can jump in. I mean, I think the technical problem is if you just consider Ethereum itself is the cost of data. The ultimate bottleneck is how much data can be pushed through the network at any moment. What are the bandwidth constraints there in a short period of time? Because that's the data availability problem that roll ups have to rely on. And I think that should really be the big focus for at least the Ethereum community in the short and medium term is proto dank sharding data availability, sampling, and really just trying to optimize, for one, publishing data and storing recent data. But I think just on that point, that was also why I was thinking, what's the biggest challenge right now? Because we're all techies, we love to think about deep technical problems that are very objective and easy to solve. But the user experience is terrible.
00:03:19.542 - 00:03:35.314, Speaker A: I mean, I told the gnosis safe guys this. I'm like, guys, build a better website. I'm stuck using safe now. And it's so difficult. I mean, raise your hand if you think gnosis safe is hard to use. Some people, I can't actually see the audience, but okay, I don't think anyone raised their hands.
00:03:35.352 - 00:03:35.746, Speaker E: There you go.
00:03:35.768 - 00:04:05.260, Speaker A: Maybe that's the joke, but no, but I think wallets need to be improved at some point. We're going to have 1020, 30, 50 different roll ups or off chain systems. And trying to migrate your assets from one system to another is still very painful. Or even just trying to withdraw your assets from that system is also very painful. So I think a huge focus should be on the wallet experience and just making it easier for people to use this system. Like what's the point of scaling if it's just very hard to use? Not even expensive, just difficult.
00:04:07.550 - 00:04:45.302, Speaker D: I agree there, and I would piggyback on both of your answers. And I think there is obviously a technical issue, a technical problem that needs to be solved in order to reach the masses. But there is also like a social component to it, an educational component to it for educating and onboarding the next billion of users. I think scaling technically is. I think the community has a pretty clear vision of where to go, but the social layer remains very much understudied. And how to the UX problems, how do I bring my grandmother on chain? How do I bring my little brother on chain? How do I.
00:04:45.356 - 00:04:46.006, Speaker E: And why?
00:04:46.108 - 00:05:02.890, Speaker D: Yeah, and why? Exactly. So the application layer, for what kind of application? We will bring the people on chain. So I agree with both of you that there is a technical issue and social issue, but also like the educational and user experience that remains bottlenecks to bringing the next billion of users.
00:05:03.310 - 00:05:36.760, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say it's a mix between marketing and technical aspects of it. So from a marketing perspective, I have a family member that has been using Ethereum for years, but he has done very little with it. I don't think he's ever even used uniswap before, which is crazy to me. But yeah, I think advocating for roll ups and scalability is great. The other blocker is the technical aspect of it. So I think with the EIP 4844, I think we'll have way more scalability. I think it's estimated to have maybe ten times the amount of scalability, roughly depending on the transaction type.
00:05:36.760 - 00:05:48.570, Speaker C: Again, the blocker is just like Ethereum has fixed block space, and we just need to find a way to make the most out of it, out of not only the execution layer, but the consensus layer.
00:05:50.110 - 00:06:26.790, Speaker B: I think these are all great points, and with the following questions, I hope that we can get more into both the technical aspect, but also some of the less technical, maybe governance aspects of all of this. A follow up question that I will have is we kind of assume and take it as granted and never question this, I think, right now, but the current roadmap to scaling Ethereum is roll ups, right? There were some other solutions, but why is it roll ups? Actually, why each and every one of you just decided, yeah, roll ups are the best, and we're going to have our companies build roll ups.
00:06:29.050 - 00:06:57.390, Speaker A: I mean, I have a really silly thesis around this that I've been running with since 2016, and hopefully people don't laugh at it too much. So back in 2016, I was a PhD student and I was focused on cryptocurrencies. My advisor told me at the time, when he was younger, he used to play horse racing games on the Internet. You get your money, you put it in the website, you play this horse racing game. I think he probably got rugged a few times, but he likes to gamble on virtual horses. That's what people like to do. I don't question their interests.
00:06:57.390 - 00:07:34.974, Speaker A: But after hearing about that story, I thought, well, the whole point of cryptocurrency is to minimize trust. So what would be cool is if I could take my assets, lock it into a website, play this horse racing game, withdraw my funds, and thought that entire experience, I never had to trust the operator. I didn't have to trust them with my funds, I didn't have to trust them of the rules of the game. They're just providing me a service and they're collecting a fee for doing that. So it's always been my sort of running thesis. How can we make this sort of dream come alive? And I thought that bitcoin Lightning network could do that back in 2016. So I spent a lot of time working on state channels, and then we realized it's solving the wrong problem.
00:07:34.974 - 00:08:14.074, Speaker A: The whole point of payment channels is given three different databases. Can you synchronize and update across those databases? Channels are amazing at doing that. They're like a fast bridge where really what solves that problem is roll ups in a roll up. This is a better way to build this off chain system where I don't have to trust the operator, but I still get this really nice web two experience, fast confirmation. They can build whatever funky games that they want, or Daps, but custody becomes optional. Or even, as I guess, as Vitalik's blog post said, back in 2019, custody becomes a liability. They don't want to take custody of our funds, but they want to provide us a service.
00:08:14.074 - 00:08:24.350, Speaker A: So to me that's always been my running thesis of why this technology is really exciting. And again, it's a really dinky example. But I was a student, that's how you pursue interests and ideas.
00:08:26.050 - 00:09:25.042, Speaker E: Maybe some context to add to this. At least my way of thinking about a blockchain such as bitcoin or Ethereum is it only is valuable because people believe it is valuable. And so what Patrick says is we now want to be building out systems that take advantage of Ethereum's security. But the security is so high because over the past years, the market decided such that people believe Ethereum is secure and there's a lot of money in the system and it has been proven because of that. And it's a self reinforcing cycle. And so I would argue, I like Ethereum, don't get me wrong. But one of the main reasons why we are here and 1234 people are working at roll ups is not that roll ups are such a great thing or Ethereum is such a great thing.
00:09:25.042 - 00:10:02.830, Speaker E: It's that because of some coincidence and streak of luck, it is ethereum that became established as the standard. And it might not be the best one, it might be the qwerty of this decade that is not the best one objectively, but it has historical roots. But now that it is around, it pays off to lay out your keyboard shortcuts such that you can copy and you can paste easily using the QWERTY keyboard and not the Borac one. And so I guess that's what we are doing. We are taking what we have and we are trying to make the best out of it. Like I guess Marcus indicated.
00:10:07.170 - 00:10:51.966, Speaker D: I would argue that there was perhaps some external forces that led also to the adoption of rollup when there were all the later one, I would say wars. I think the public and the community has noticed that there were strong properties in Ethereum that you wanted to have in the blockchain. You wanted permissionlessness, you wanted credible neutrality, you wanted a censorship resistance. And these properties, they were not guaranteed in other layer ones. And I think there were perhaps a shift in the community vision of how we could use Ethereum. Moving computation off chain was apparently appropriate in order to scale Ethereum. And while keeping these properties, that makes Ethereum valuable as a community.
00:10:51.966 - 00:11:16.950, Speaker D: So I think that's a bit like over the years, we as a community came to the realization, seeing all of the landscape of hot player one, that Ethereum had some very valuable properties and you could move some less valuable one, like computation off chain. And that's how I think rollup came up to become the preferred solution to scale Ethereum.
00:11:17.930 - 00:11:57.918, Speaker C: Yeah, there was a talk during, I think ZK Warsaw this week, talking about infinitely scaling Ethereum. And I think through history, originally they were planning on having maybe like 64 different shards for Ethereum. But the issue with that is you're fragmenting kind of like the security of Ethereum potentially with that. So the new roadmap that I think Vitalik is really just really passionate about is a roll of future because of keeping most of the security the same, while being able to abstract all the execution layer type of data to a roll up that the same levels of security with the consensus and execution layers of Ethereum.
00:11:58.014 - 00:12:16.242, Speaker A: Can I add one more comment actually, because I forgot about that. Maybe a raise of hands. Does anyone remember the old execution sharding proposals by Ethereum or any of the academic ones? Okay, maybe raise your hand if you thought they could be implemented. Exactly. Look at that. No one raised their hand. The proposals were awful.
00:12:16.242 - 00:12:54.642, Speaker A: They were just terrible. There's also another question I wanted to ask one more question because it occurred to me when others were speaking, and this is sort of like, why are roll ups as a technology stack important? So I'm going to ask a question to everyone here. Has anyone here ever lost a job opportunity because they couldn't be trusted? Has anyone here ever lost a job opportunity because they couldn't be trusted? Okay. That's what I expected. So no one raised their hand. So I was in Nigeria recently in Kenya, and I asked exactly the same question to the audience and nearly every single person in the audience raised their hand. And they also laughed about it a little bit because they're like, this is so obvious.
00:12:54.642 - 00:13:34.014, Speaker A: Of course we've lost job opportunities because we couldn't be trusted. And that's so sobering because it sort of highlights the difference between people here, like all of us, who are sort of quite privileged, where we don't lose job opportunities because we can be trusted, where in other countries, especially like Nigeria, this technology stack allows them to join the global community in a way where they can provide us a service and we don't have to trust them. So they no longer lose these opportunities. And to me that was just like a sobering moment where you're like, wow, this can actually really impact people who suffer these problems. That's so alien to everyone here. So I just wanted to highlight that because it's a very recent experience and I still think about it.
00:13:34.212 - 00:13:35.474, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's a very good.
00:13:35.512 - 00:14:08.198, Speaker B: Point, especially with what you guys have talked before, that scaling has actually these two phases, right? The technical phase, but also like the human face. Like why do more people want to join this space? How can they do it? What are the UX challenges, all of this? I would like to actually now go to some questions to each one of you specifically, and starting with Marcus, you're working with Tyco, of course. How has Tyco approached the issue of Ethereum scalability and what sets it apart from other solutions?
00:14:08.374 - 00:14:56.666, Speaker C: So yeah, we're a type one ZKE EVM and we're trying to be as close to Ethereum as possible. So under the hood, what's happening is we're using Geth to kind of have our execution layer environment and we're really trying as closely as possible not to modify that to be true to Ethereum. And right now we're also exploring other clients, potentially because the Go Ethereum client is like the flagship client that the Ethereum foundation supports. But there's other up and coming clients that are extremely performant, like the rust Ethereum client. And we're planning on actually integrating that because I think the sync time is like 50 hours or something like that. It's insane, the performance. So I think we need just the east get proof with like a storage component of that and then we'll start testing the rest.
00:14:56.666 - 00:14:58.890, Speaker C: Ethereum client for potential integration.
00:14:59.790 - 00:15:29.160, Speaker B: Okay, you mentioned you want to be as close to Ethereum as possible. I looked at your roadmap and there is a lot of talk about zk proofs and the fee structure. Right. And so how does these two plays out, for example, especially the fees? Right? One thing with roll ups is that because they are on layer two, it might not be obvious what the costs for all of the different operations should be. How are you looking into this?
00:15:29.690 - 00:15:51.370, Speaker C: Yeah, so when we originally launched our testnet, we did not support EIP 1559, but we now do. And I think that really came down to just supporting the RLP proofs for that. And I actually want to kind of expand on that in terms of just like being up to date. We're actually also testing the RLP component of EIP 44th, the blob data format.
00:15:51.710 - 00:15:56.430, Speaker B: So how does the blob data format work if the blobs are on Tyco?
00:15:57.010 - 00:16:07.380, Speaker C: So the main thing is we were trying to just make sure that if it's submitted on L one, we're able to parse the data to make sure that all the blob data is correct on itself.
00:16:08.310 - 00:16:26.550, Speaker B: Okay. Okay, makes sense. So maybe the good person next would be arist, because scroll is also a ZK rollup that is similarly to Tyco, not yet released. And I have a question about what's the steps required for you to actually be live on Mainnet?
00:16:27.630 - 00:17:17.190, Speaker E: Yeah, that's a very well timed question. In fact, we have just two weeks ago launched our final milestone prior to Mainnet, the Sepolia Scroll Sepolia testnet that has full feature parity with our future Mainnet. So what we are still working on in order to go mainnet is actually all sorts of security audits. This is very high priority on our roadmap. And this is something that we don't want to make compromises on. So we are having several audit teams audit our components. And other than that, we are still, of course, improving performance and improving resilience and site reliability in the back end.
00:17:17.190 - 00:17:52.660, Speaker E: But you are basically as a user, able to experience what scroll mainnet will be like already. And I can tell you as a developer, it's actually quite surprising that you literally go to remix.org and you literally exchange the RPC endpoint and things work. There is things that I think we will come to discuss at length later, such as proof overflow issues and so on that are in the little asterisk. But other than that, yeah, give it a go.
00:17:53.270 - 00:17:53.682, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:17:53.736 - 00:18:39.540, Speaker B: Actually, the asterisks might be important because as I think everyone knows, just building those roll ups is like a super complex task, especially with the things that we found that are easy. Right? It turns out that. Oh, actually because of some special things, like for example, for fraud proof system, it turns out that maybe proving the execution is actually quite easy. But then there is this whole game, theoretic aspects of getting people to coordinate. And for like ZK systems, oh, maybe the actual execution is easy, but for example, for scroll, maybe supporting forced transactions is hard. And I wanted to ask what are the challenges that you would say you were facing or you were facing with scroll when building all of this?
00:18:40.950 - 00:19:57.738, Speaker E: We care about decentralization a lot, and this is a very awkward thing to say because decentralizing things is really hard. And at the same time you face all of the pressure from the community to finally go mainnet and to finally be usable. And it also feels to an engineer, again, it feels kind of sensible to give a half baked product to the community because it's already ten times better than what maybe the alternative would be. But it's not what you are aiming for. And so right now, in fact, decentralizing the provers has been our first priority. And that has been quite challenging in terms of even those, again, nontechnical and boringly human dimensions, such as how do we orchestrate having all of the people who are running approver with a big machine and so on, to actually upgrade the software when we want to go fast and roll out new features and so on, and we don't want to have those long notice periods and so on. We want to be able to move fast.
00:19:57.738 - 00:20:11.920, Speaker E: These things are quite challenging. And what's going to be way more challenging, of course, is going to be decentralizing the sequences. So that's something that we will not have at Mainnet, but that's something we are working on already and that's something we care about deeply as well.
00:20:12.290 - 00:20:44.938, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. And you touched a bit upon the decentralization aspect, especially with giving away control to the community. And so I think, Patrick, you're the best person to follow up on that. I know arbitrum has made this bold move to actually give control to the DAO, and I'm wondering how would you reflect on that? What were the good things that came out of this? I know there have also been some bumps in the road, so maybe you can follow up on this.
00:20:45.104 - 00:21:02.510, Speaker A: Yeah, and get some context. So I've been at the arbitram foundation now for about six months. Prior to that I was mostly independent. I wasn't in any rollout project. And six months ago was the arbitram airdrop. Maybe raise your hand. Did anyone here receive the airdrop says that of interest? That's awesome.
00:21:02.510 - 00:21:26.050, Speaker A: Congratulations, guys. Welcome to the Dow. No, but I guess the point is that the airdrop happened the DAO was launched, and I've never worked with a dow in my life. I'm a technical researcher. I like the understand how stuff works under the hood. I have no experience with Daos whatsoever. And on my third day at the foundation, I was making slides about proof of stake Ethereum for a presentation.
00:21:26.050 - 00:22:05.230, Speaker A: And next thing I know, everything's exploding on Twitter. And I'm like, what's going on, guys? What happened? And then in hindsight, and I think this is really important, by the way. So the way the foundation wanted to be funded was that we put a proposal to the DAO that the DAO would hopefully approve and fund us and let us start executing on our mission statements. And of course, the DAO, they discovered the proposal and they're like, why are we giving you money? Why are we giving money to the foundation? And they rejected it outright. Complete rejection. And I think that's really important. It really set the tone that the Dow is not going to accept.
00:22:05.230 - 00:22:25.014, Speaker A: They're not going to rubber stamp our proposals. There's a real DAo out there. There's real people who are active on a daily basis evaluating proposals that reach the Dow. And of course, anything we propose, they're also going to evaluate it on equal merit. So I think that's really important. It's a real dao. It is also extremely powerful.
00:22:25.014 - 00:23:14.154, Speaker A: Both over. For example, after that episode, the way it was resolved was that the foundation's funding and treasury is in a vesting wallet over four years, and the DAO has the power to slow down, accelerate, or totally remove the remaining vesting of our treasury. And so how many rollout projects out there can have their treasury removed by their Dao? I don't think any other project would take that. Know, we're very accountable to our Dao. I'm trying to think. I think what also is important to highlight in terms, know, working towards this decentralized governance, the way the foundation likes to think about it, is that we like to think that DAO is the brain and we're the hands. So we have our own mission statements that we execute on.
00:23:14.154 - 00:24:02.434, Speaker A: The DAO has given us that right. But we've made a deliberate decision to try to step back as a neutral party and allow the DAO the right proposals, work together and get their proposals funded and then execute on it. So if there's anyone in the room, let's just say you think, oh, I don't like how the foundation is doing XYZ. Or maybe you're thinking, oh, why is the foundation not doing XYZ, you can actually just go straight to the Dow, write a proposal, work with the delegates. If it gets approved, you can get funded to go execute on the proposal that you care about. And our job is just to be there and help you operationally to execute on it. And so as part of that, I think initially, early on, because I don't think this has ever really existed, to the best of my knowledge.
00:24:02.434 - 00:24:37.000, Speaker A: So I think the Dow is a bit slow in the first two months because everyone's getting their head around this new setup, the amount of autonomy and control and power that they have. But now, six months in, it's very active. There's a lot of proposals going through the form, a lot of proposals being voted on, and there's a lot of active discussions among the delegates and how the DAO should move forward towards the betterment of arbitram and Ethereum. So, yeah, it's been a really fun six months, and also, it is pretty crazy how much power has been given to the Dow. And I think that's the right decision that was done. Obviously, I wasn't part of that decision, but I think they made the right decision on that.
00:24:37.610 - 00:25:02.870, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you. And the other part about arbitrum outside of the Dao, is I was going to ask a question about bold, and then today I wake up, I go to Twitter, and there's this new thing called Stylus. So I'm going to ask, like, a double question. Right. The two new recent things that you announced are bold and stylus. And can you just explain, what are they? How do they help scalability?
00:25:03.030 - 00:25:30.646, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. I think the important distinction here is that both proposals came from off chain labs. So, in the arbitrum ecosystem, you could say that right now, there's three big entities that are part of it. There's the arbitrum Dao and the foundation. And at the foundation, our job is to represent the DAo and support the DAO in its mission. Off chain Labs is a completely separate entity, and they've came up with two new proposals. One is bold, which is a better design for the raw proof system that we can talk about.
00:25:30.646 - 00:26:06.490, Speaker A: And then stylus is more of a better, let's say, virtual machine, where you can implement solidity smart contracts, but you can also implement in languages that compile down the wasm, like Rust C, and it's a first class citizen alongside solidity. And they can also talk to each other. So let's say you have your contracts in solidity. Someone has their smart contracts in rust. They can also be interruptable and communicate with each other. I think it even goes so far that for the wasm aspect of it, they even reuse the data model for Ethereum. So they're very compatible back and forth.
00:26:06.490 - 00:26:42.730, Speaker A: That was one of big part of the design. But what's important to highlight is that those proposals came from offchain labs. And in order for that to get in the arbitram, the network arbitram one, or arbitrum nova, it has to go through the DAO. So they're going to have to make a proposal with enough evidence that will convince the DAO to vote for this and actually include it in the arbitrum network as well. So that sort of demonstrates again, the power of the DAO, that we just can't upgrade the network with these new features anymore. It has to actually be proposed and hopefully they'll vote for it, because I think they're cool ideas, but it's always up to the dow to decide.
00:26:43.150 - 00:26:50.846, Speaker B: I must say personally I'm very happy about that because l two B is one of the biggest delegates there. And so in a way we can.
00:26:50.868 - 00:26:54.050, Speaker A: You have a lot of influence, more influence than I do. I can't even vote.
00:26:55.430 - 00:27:31.200, Speaker B: But yeah, I'm looking forward to both arbitrum governance and governance in other systems. And speaking of which, Esteban, it's time for you. I actually want to start with a question about decentralization. ZK sync was a project that started very early on and implemented a lot of features. And one of the things that happened early on in Zksync is the introduction of the Security Council, which is one good step towards decentralization. But now my question is, how are you planning to further decentralize the project?
00:27:32.210 - 00:28:02.994, Speaker D: So there are several steps that are being taken towards decentralization. One obvious step that's been talking about is decentralizing the sequential. That's an obvious step that we need to go through to ensure also credible neutrality. We don't want to be a sole operator of an order of transactions. The second one is the decentralization of the prover. That's something that remains to be done. I don't think any project has, well, you have been experimenting, I think, with the decentralized proverb network.
00:28:02.994 - 00:28:25.854, Speaker D: This is another step that needs to be done. And in the end there will be governance as well. What kind of, we have distributed provers. Oh, you have as well, not incentivized yet on the testnet for us, we still remain to do that. We've been working on optimizing the prover and lowering the hardware requirement. And then there will be the decentralization that is needed. And finally there will be.
00:28:25.854 - 00:28:55.462, Speaker D: Governance is like, what kind of decision making do you want to grant the community? Patrick has been mentioning, you can be very generous, like in term of power that you grant the community, or more restrictive ethereum has been. I'm not sure that there is much power that is granted to the community itself to actually upgrade Ethereum. So there are different models that here needs to be considered. But, yeah, decentralization of the sequencer, decentralization of the poofer. Decentralization of decision making.
00:28:55.596 - 00:29:16.746, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I cannot comment about the ethereum comment because I think that's really important. I give his talk two days ago as well about towards decentralized governance. And in Ethereum and bitcoin, the way it works is rough consensus. Has anyone ever heard that term before? Rough consensus? No one has. Okay, so rough consensus is a bit like a hot potato. It's a bit like you having a potato.
00:29:16.746 - 00:29:38.686, Speaker A: You don't want to hold it. So you pass it to me and I pass potato on. No one wants to take responsibility for governing Ethereum. And so the way governance actually works is that someone submits a proposal, and then the key stakeholders in the network, the proof of the stakers, the people on the peer to peer network, the dev community, they all issue a signal. They say, here's a signal. I am happy. The upgrade, I'm ready.
00:29:38.686 - 00:30:22.850, Speaker A: The upgrade. And if there's enough signals and you can do a bit of a sniff test, you can sniff it and say, I think there's enough signals out there, then there's a flag day decided, and then the upgrade actually happens. So, yeah, no one takes any responsibility in Ethereum governance, and that's on purpose because it wants to make it difficult to capture. If you don't define how governance works, then it's very difficult to do a governance attack where for these roll ups, rough consensus doesn't really work, because in rough consensus, if two parties disagree, you can fork and go your separate ways. You have Ethereum and Ethereum classic. They went their separate ways. They disagreed on the future of Ethereum, where in a roll up, you can't do that because the funds are held in a smart contract and you can't fork a smart contract.
00:30:22.850 - 00:30:51.610, Speaker A: If all the assets are there, then you need to convince the smart contract that change the rules. And the only way to do that is to have explicit governance, like some voting protocol. So, for example, that's what the arbitram Dao does. There's on chain governance where people can cast their vote. If it exceeds the threshold, then it will go through the smart contract suite and the upgrade will execute on chain with the smart contracts themselves. So there's no multi stake that's doing the upgrade. It's actually on chain governance with direct voting.
00:30:51.610 - 00:30:58.270, Speaker A: And that seems like the best of all evils in terms of governance so far for these systems.
00:30:58.930 - 00:31:43.070, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess maybe we were a bit too enthusiastic about roll ups for the past 40 minutes. I guess there's so many things that need to be said that many people don't realize. This problem gets exaggerated by the fact that roll ups suffer from an economy of scale. And so it's quite likely that if one roll up amass a lot of users, it will be preferred over other roll ups. So this becomes way more of an issue even then, because it's kind of difficult to establish a future in which there's many roll ups. And if one roll up needs like this explicit governance decision, it's not that bad. So yeah, there's many, many issues with roll ups still when it comes to decentralization.
00:31:43.970 - 00:32:17.814, Speaker B: But one thing that I think can be said about the governance of rollups is that on one hand, of course, you have the issue of how do you upgrade it, steer it and stuff. But also there is this other path where, and I think ZKsync is exploring it and I'm framing it uniquely now, but letting the users decide their own security. And I think this is what ZK Porter wants to do. And what is even ZK Porter and what's the roadmap there?
00:32:18.012 - 00:32:54.500, Speaker D: So ZK Porter is a proof of concept and soon product that is going to be released in which that we call volition. Volition is not a term that has been coined by Matterlabs or Zksync. It has been coined by Starkware. And essentially here you let the user choose what the security assumptions they want to have. And the trade off is between security and cost. I think what we've noticed in the past years is that people are ready to sacrifice a bit of security assumptions in order to have.
00:32:57.350 - 00:33:01.220, Speaker B: Unfortunately. Why don't you care about security, guys?
00:33:01.670 - 00:33:03.030, Speaker E: Yes, seriously.
00:33:03.450 - 00:33:15.210, Speaker D: However, I think so giving that opportunity to the users might not be the. I mean, here we can ask the question, we would be willing to sacrifice a bit of security for cheaper.
00:33:17.630 - 00:33:29.582, Speaker A: Mean. Does anyone here use Coinbase? Raise your hand. Who uses Coinbase? Okay. And I'm not the tax authorities. Don't worry, I'm joking. So the point is, most people use exchanges. So they do trade off security.
00:33:29.716 - 00:34:09.814, Speaker D: Exactly. So ZK Porter is that realization that you could scale massively in term of performance at the expense of a little bit of security, while sharing the liquidity with the roll up. So you can decide for each transaction, you can let the user choose what kind of security assumptions they want and what kind of cost profile they would decide. Yeah, while not sharing the problem of fragmenting the liquidity at the same time. So that's essentially what Zkpor is about. The data availability is guaranteed by a committee that we call the guardians, and that should be incentivized. And this is more a social problem.
00:34:09.814 - 00:34:17.200, Speaker D: What kind of incentivization do you need for them to guarantee that availability? That's essentially what Zika Porter is.
00:34:17.570 - 00:35:24.466, Speaker B: You know, one reason that people are exploring solutions like Zika Porter or Validia for scaling is that data, even though we figured out that with rollups we can just offload the computation off chain and then just keep the data, it turns out that the data is still expensive. Right? And so this is why the current thinking is maybe we could have this data off chain. But of course, this comes with security trade offs, as you said. But one of the exciting things coming to Ethereum, hopefully soon, is dank sharding or like protodank sharding or alpha version of it. But anyway, and for those of you who don't know, it's a proposal that will allow posting data blobs to Ethereum, which are going to be cheaper, have some other trade offs of data availability. My question is how this proposal affects your thinking about your project and what it can do. And Marcus, maybe you can start.
00:35:24.648 - 00:35:40.550, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a pretty critical upgrade, and I think Tyco plans to launch for mainnet after, because out of the get go, we want to make sure that we have optimized the scalability with the upgrade. For the roll ups.
00:35:42.810 - 00:36:29.058, Speaker A: I think dark tank sharding highlights. I'm trying to think the best way to phrase this. So for roll ups, one of the security assumptions for roll ups today is that anyone can look at the Ethereum blockchain, grab all the data, all the historical data, execute all the historical data, and then a computer copy of the roll up themselves. They can compute the same database as everyone else because they can get access to all the historical data, because it's on Ethereum today. The problem is that the peer to peer network does not guarantee that historical data can be retrieved. They just do that today out of convenience. If I'm a node on the network, I can delete the entire blockchain and just keep around the recent blocks.
00:36:29.058 - 00:36:38.700, Speaker A: So the only thing the peer to peer network really guarantees is that recent data is publicly available, that you can get access to the recent data for this roll up.
00:36:39.070 - 00:37:05.614, Speaker B: This is why the term like data availability can be confusing for anyone that doesn't know what we're talking about. I really recommend a recent Twitter thread by Bartek Kaposhevsky. He goes into how data availability is actually about term and we should have the data publication, which is at the point of posting the transactions, and then data storage, which is what you mentioned, like what happens to the data afterwards.
00:37:05.742 - 00:37:36.830, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So when dank sharding comes along in its full beast mode, then historical data just won't be publicly available anymore. Or, I mean, there's a good chance that it won't be. You'll only have access to recent data, and that fundamentally changes the security model for a lot of these roll apps, or even just your ability to compute a copy of the database, because you're just missing historical transactions. You literally can't compute a copy of it. And so for me, that's the big thing about Dank sharding, is how it's going to impact the security assumptions that we make for roll ups.
00:37:38.530 - 00:38:34.106, Speaker D: I think what is super interesting with Dank sharding and AP 44 in general, is that we are seeing a new market that is being created, something new that is being priced, which is this additional blub space. So we will have, I think, ultimately a market in which there is gas fees, in which that is going to be priced hopefully cheaper with the new blob space. We're going to have blob space that is going to be priced hopefully cheaper than gas prices as well. And then with roll up, we will have in addition, the cost of proofs that it should be, with the recent development, marginal compared to storing on layer one. So I think we all going to benefit from this additional blob space. It's going to be interesting in how the competition among layer two for this blob space is going to affect the price of that additional storage, this ephemeral storage that is going to be available on Ethereum.
00:38:34.298 - 00:38:41.118, Speaker B: That's a good point. I'm actually worried people are going to start uploading movies to the Ethereum blockchain.
00:38:41.294 - 00:39:22.560, Speaker D: And I think this is an important point, is that in a lot of technologies, if we look at the energy sector, for example, we observe what we call a rebound effect. That is, every increase in efficiency leads to an increase in consumption. They've observed that with the energy sector. I think it might be the case also with Ethereum. Every increase in efficiency and performance in Ethereum, or decrease in price gas fees will ultimately lead to an increase in consumption. At least this is the promise of scaling, is that we want more users, more transactions. So there will be this interesting dynamic, I think, and it's going to be mainly observed in term of price, but this dynamic is going to be interesting to observe, I think.
00:39:23.090 - 00:39:42.326, Speaker E: Well, now it sounds like it's almost a bad thing. It's not a bad thing, let's be honest. First of all, we want data and we want state to expire. We don't want people to have to keep everything forever and never ever be able to remove it. That's a feature, not a back.
00:39:42.508 - 00:39:46.150, Speaker A: Second, cog rolls on stage. Now that's normally his pitch.
00:39:46.490 - 00:39:58.860, Speaker E: But second of all, isn't that what we all want? People putting movies on the blockchain or people using the blockchain more? I don't know. I don't think we should be complaining about that.
00:39:59.630 - 00:40:25.026, Speaker B: I'm sorry. The only reason I mentioned movies was like a mental shortcut from I thought we wanted this block space for roll ups, right? And I was worried other people might just take it away. And I'm not making a judgment. I actually would love to see a future where you could put everything on the blockchain and you wouldn't care. It will all be secure and it will be magically everything. It will be great, right?
00:40:25.128 - 00:40:29.718, Speaker E: I'm sorry. There's decentralization. Some people might decide to put a movie up.
00:40:29.804 - 00:40:40.326, Speaker A: You know what I think actually back in 2010, 2011, someone did put an ASCII, ASCII ASCII movie on the bitcoin blockchain. And it's still there, obviously, because it's there.
00:40:40.428 - 00:40:59.360, Speaker E: No, but seriously, just to give maybe some numbers, I think a general user, a normal user, can think about a roll up as an order of magnitude and cost decrease and protodunk sharding as another order of magnitude and cost decrease. So I think that's what most people expect these days.
00:41:01.090 - 00:41:32.230, Speaker B: Okay. And the next question would be to actually just loop back to the start with things that you mentioned, that scaling is not just technical things. And I wanted to ask about UX challenges related to scaling with more users with more capacity. We start to feel it even today that the tools that we use might not be adequate for the job. And I was wondering, how do you envision the UX challenges of this space being mean?
00:41:32.380 - 00:41:59.838, Speaker A: I think the first example that's very rural Pacific is for, let's say, Security Council members. Ideally they should all be using hardware wallets for signing transactions. But then you need to check. If I'm a Security council member, there's a proposed upgrade that fixes a critical bug. I need to evaluate what I'm signing before I sign it. And if you use a ledger, a ledger will give you a domain hash. And trying to work out what the hell that is is such a difficult task.
00:41:59.838 - 00:42:14.450, Speaker A: The first step is just tell people what they're signing, make it easy to check. Oh, this is what was proposed to me and I can actually check on the hardware. Oh yeah. That is. I can sign this now. That seems like the lowest hanging fruit for security council members. That needs to be fixed.
00:42:14.450 - 00:42:21.402, Speaker A: A proper Ui for these bloody hardware wallets. Sorry, I'll let someone else go next. I just want to get that frustration out.
00:42:21.536 - 00:43:19.526, Speaker E: I think it's necessary and I think we are seeing some progress. I remember, I think last year on this stage we were talking about how the most popular wallet out there asks you for token spend permission and it says, do you want to authorize 2.57 eight e 68 token spend? And so at least now that is gone, I think we are seeing some improvements. And I think that with roll ups, I guess standardizing soon, hopefully there will actually be more critical mass and also just more incentive to be working on better wallets and better UX overall. And also, I think just the fact alone, by the virtue of a lower average transaction fee alone, there will be just more incentive to actually invest into your DAP because there will be more users.
00:43:19.718 - 00:43:28.590, Speaker B: Just like throw a bone into all of this. Do you actually think Dux should come first or the user should come first, they should complain and then we fix the UX.
00:43:30.210 - 00:43:54.834, Speaker D: I'm happy to. Well, there I'm speaking on my behalf. I don't know about the whole team, but I would say that the UX is the most important ultimately today. I don't care about the technology that is behind my email box. I don't care about the technology that helps me to enjoy Netflix on my laptop. So I think the UX is going to be a very important one in that regards. I think there were several important steps.
00:43:54.834 - 00:44:26.740, Speaker D: Account abstraction has been one of them, how to be able to bring on board the next generation of users. We can now subsidize their gas fees, we can now offer them social recovery. We can now have different signature schemes. So I think this is a big advance for Ux. We haven't seen yet. I would say the killer app that will allow to onboard easily non crypto native users. But I think it's a step in the right direction already.
00:44:28.550 - 00:44:58.310, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to say I think we should have a proactive approach to this because we shouldn't be like, oh, let's wait for a fire to start. It's like, no, let's prevent fires from happening as much as possible. And I had a conversation with a deverel one time regarding ux. They said ideally your documentation should be so good that there shouldn't be any questions, but if there is, then you have to be very proactive and understand why they're asking this and try to fill in those gaps. So I think it really just, again boils down to documentation and just clarity.
00:44:58.470 - 00:45:07.280, Speaker E: At what cost do you work on the documentation in your basement for two years and there's none for two years to have a perfect one? Two years in.
00:45:08.050 - 00:45:38.034, Speaker C: Well, I would say you start with what you think is there and then maybe go through your comms, maybe through Discord or Telegram or Twitter and see where people might get stuck and then be proactive and be like, oh, I didn't even think of that. I thought that was intuitive, but that actually isn't because I didn't know that about the protocol. So then hearing that feedback or looking at even maybe a GitHub issue, because I think GitHub is such a powerful tool to just quickly be like, oh, here's an issue, here's the PR, and then it's all resolved.
00:45:38.162 - 00:46:02.682, Speaker A: Can I make one comment on this? So I know as a community we always use the Microsoft code from the 80s where they're like, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers. And we do need more developers. Developers are really important, but we need designers. We need designers, designers, designers. We need people who understand humans. Programmers should never make interfaces because we don't understand people. Yes, we need designers, designers, designers.
00:46:02.682 - 00:46:07.886, Speaker A: And so, yeah, I think we just need to expand our pool of people we really, really want in this industry.
00:46:08.078 - 00:46:20.840, Speaker B: Yeah. And now, speaking of questions that people might have to the protocols, I think we still have like three minutes left and maybe we can take some audience questions. Yeah, we see one.
00:46:23.850 - 00:46:24.600, Speaker A: Was.
00:46:27.870 - 00:46:28.620, Speaker B: It.
00:46:30.350 - 00:46:31.100, Speaker D: Check.
00:46:31.950 - 00:46:32.410, Speaker E: Okay.
00:46:32.480 - 00:46:44.000, Speaker F: So the question is if you would have to name other layer two that you are a fan of, but not the one that you work for. So which one would be and why?
00:46:47.170 - 00:47:05.380, Speaker C: I'll start, I guess maybe like optimism because they're not here just to give a shout out. They have a great Twitter vibes. So it's like, yeah, they're cool to hang out with and they had a really cool booth at Eve Denver as well. They had this kind of flower thing. It was really cool.
00:47:08.790 - 00:47:26.700, Speaker A: I can go next. I'm trying to think the best. But the answer is I like most of the rollout mean I can give you a momentum model of how I think about them. Maybe start with optimism. They got great vibes. It's all about the culture for optimism. I like to think Starknet are like crazy wizards with their Cairo stuff.
00:47:26.700 - 00:47:50.706, Speaker A: I always see scroll as being extremely ethereum aligned. They're basically Ethereum. Well, they're not basically Ethereum, but they're so, so Ethereum focused as part of their core blood or their blood. Zk sync are extremely product focused. They keep a lot of things close to their chest because they're just focused on the product. I've always saw arbitram as sort of exceedingly focused. Like at first I made the joke during my presentation the other day.
00:47:50.706 - 00:48:15.882, Speaker A: I thought they'd take their funding in 2019 and write papers, but they're just exceedingly focused on delivery. And they want to get this pie on the L two beat website. They want the green slices, they want a spinach pie. That is one big focus of their goal. And then I guess Tyco is more new on the block. They were previously with loop ring. They have proven history that they can build these systems, but I'm still trying to work out the two word vibe that I want to give them.
00:48:15.882 - 00:48:25.280, Speaker A: So yeah, that's a work in progress right now. So ask me in a year and I'll have a better description of the project. Well, they got a cool Zelda like logo, I guess, so that's pretty cool.
00:48:26.130 - 00:48:27.306, Speaker C: The triforce.
00:48:27.418 - 00:48:31.550, Speaker A: Triforce, exactly. So I guess they're nerds, aren't they? They're big gamers.
00:48:32.770 - 00:49:05.046, Speaker D: I agree. Each project has different strengths. I think optimism has been very interesting to watch in term of governance, their experiment, I think it's splitting into the governance and having the collective. I think optimism has been doing a great job in governance. I mean, arbitram obviously has fraud proof implemented, which is something that is also interesting to watch. Scroll, you've been also working very well into the developer experience and bringing the ZK roll up. Starquare has been, we all innovate the technology developed by Starquare mostly.
00:49:05.046 - 00:49:23.070, Speaker D: I mean they've been innovating in that space with zero knowledge proofs and Tyco as well. You've been also very close to the Ethereum community and to the PSE. So I think all the projects have different strengths and we can all learn from each other, and we all are thinking, watching a bit each other, to learn from each other's strength.
00:49:24.530 - 00:49:28.320, Speaker E: You're right. Did we forget to call PSe a roll up?
00:49:29.730 - 00:49:45.766, Speaker B: I see. Okay, I'm going to have a hot take on this fuel V one. The only roll up. It just has one fault. It's not even written in solidity. We have time for one last question. Let's make it a short one.
00:49:45.766 - 00:49:46.534, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:46.652 - 00:50:30.740, Speaker F: As a smart contract developer, I think the first thing that came to my mind when I think about scaling is asynchronous and synchronous blockchains. Like, we can take an example, a salana blockchain and asynchronous blockchains, they have kind of different vision of solving the problem with scalability. Because when we have, for example, a bunch of users, let's say 1 million users, sending, let's say some transaction to some smart contract, at the same time, we need to process that transactions either synchronously or asynchronously. So what can you say about asynchronous blockchain and their future?
00:50:31.270 - 00:51:42.806, Speaker A: I mean, I remember in the early days when Ethereum was getting started, they considered adding an async command to the EVM. And I think everyone's glad they didn't do that because that would have been so complicated back in 2015. You start off simple with just getting this to work, and then you add on the cool features. I think this is really important to highlight is that what makes blockchain, this entire ecosystem, so exciting is that people can take their funky idea, they can deploy it into this marketplace, and it's really the users who decide what's valuable. Do we care about these asynchronous blockchains? Do we care about Ethereum? Do we care about the EVM or this special new programming language that everyone wants to adopt? And then it's really the marketplace that decides what's ultimately valuable. And I guess for something like Solana versus the Ethereum bitcoin community there, it's really to do with what does it mean to be decentralized? I think for me that always goes back to that. There's sort of this triangle is a sort of, can you decentralize who runs the network? Can you decentralize who can check that the network is correct and valid, know the verifiers? And then can you decentralize who can afford to use the network? And for a very long time, for maybe ten years, that was this weird triangle that we couldn't solve.
00:51:42.806 - 00:52:22.262, Speaker A: So if you look at, like, slana, sui, et cetera, they went towards less decentralized user step by making transactions fee as much as they can. But then the operators are fairly centralized. It's only like a handful of parties like definity. Back in the day, you had to buy the hardware from an approved supplier before you could be an operator on their system. Not necessarily the most decentralized vision, where ideally with roll ups, that's one way to break the triangle because Ethereum can still maintain its goal of maximizing the operators. Then you leech off that like we're leeches in a way. We leech off their security and then try to build a scalable system that's affordable for users.
00:52:22.262 - 00:52:36.126, Speaker A: So maybe that's my answer, sort of. Our approach is try and break that triangle now so we don't have to make those. Then we get to have async operations on a roll up. Maybe you can finally port that over after all these years.
00:52:36.308 - 00:52:57.926, Speaker E: I just add briefly, on top of what we discuss in terms of decentralization, I think diversification is an important element, and just having teams around that work on completely different concepts, I think that's very valuable. And we are early. There may be a first or second move advantage, but I think the last move advantage will ultimately count most.
00:52:58.108 - 00:53:04.470, Speaker B: Okay, thank you. And I think that will conclude today's panel. So please, thank you to the panelists.
00:53:05.770 - 00:53:06.760, Speaker C: Thank you.
