00:00:00.570 - 00:00:42.170, Speaker A: Hello guys, my name isinabronzevska and I'm the co founder of eforceo foundation. And I would like to welcome you to the Defi panel that I prepared with titled the current state of Defi and its promises for the future. And I would like to also welcome and ask you guys, the panelists, to join me at this stage. Yeah, please guys, don't worry. Yeah, big round of applause for them. So we have Martin Defi, Nicola David Defi and Ryan Rodenbaugh today. And please guys, take some time and introduce yourselves.
00:00:42.170 - 00:00:48.380, Speaker A: Maybe, Martin, you can start. Tell us few words about you. What do you do?
00:00:49.150 - 00:01:16.454, Speaker B: Okay, so hi everyone. I hope you still have some energy after the opening presentations. Right now you had a very good one about oracles. Super important topic. So my name is Marcin and I say it already, third time, but I'm going to repeat it during this time. Have you ever seen this meme of Spider man, like free Spider man pointing on each other? So I feel like this during this event because I'm a co founder of Redstone, which is also an oracle. I'm a co founder of Eve Warsaw over here.
00:01:16.454 - 00:02:12.658, Speaker B: And yeah, also I try to stand up from time to time. So with Redstone, my job is to run business operations and basically grow our exposure to EVM and non EVM chains. What differentiate us is from the very, very beginning we said, okay, oracles with the push model are too expensive and are not going to be for the future of multi chain word. So instead of just simply taking the packages and sending them on chain, we created an off chain component that is called data distribution layer, where signed data packages are distributed and anyone can pick them and deliver to the destination chain, no matter which one it is, as long as it's EVM and non EVM, we can also create specific adapters. So just me, in a nutshell, I'm in the space since 2017, used to be at Google Cloud like program manager, and did a couple of other things in the past, but yeah, that's impressive.
00:02:12.754 - 00:02:16.242, Speaker A: Thank you, Martin. Then we have David Defy.
00:02:16.386 - 00:03:25.870, Speaker C: Yeah, GM and Chow to everyone. I'm David Defy, the general manager of trader Joe, one of the leading decks in the entire Defi space. Constantly top ten decks by volume on Defalama. And what we do is that we have our own Defi Dex exchange. So decentralized exchange, which is not a standard uni vitu fork, but rather our own creation as we have created our custom concentrated liquidity protocol called Liquidity Book, which offers unique advantages overall alternative solutions. We are the leading Dex on the avalanche blockchain, second on Arbitrum. We are also on BNB and we also have an NFT marketplace called Jobegs which is the leading NFT marketplace on avalanche.
00:03:26.610 - 00:03:34.314, Speaker A: Great. It's great. Seriously, a lot of things is happening on your side. Thank you very much. And then we have Ryan Rodenbaum.
00:03:34.442 - 00:04:03.210, Speaker D: Good morning, Warsaw. My name is Ryan Rodenbaugh. I'm co founder of a new company called Wallfacer Labs along with Justina up here. We do a few things today, but one thing that I might actually point you two is a new product we're launching. I'm actually giving a lightning talk on it tomorrow. It's called vaults. Vaultsfyi and it's kind of I think, new take on how to think about yield in the crypto space and hopefully a great place where you can go to find interesting on chain yield opportunities.
00:04:03.210 - 00:04:05.626, Speaker D: But yeah, that's all I got.
00:04:05.728 - 00:04:11.918, Speaker A: Thank you, Ryan. And then last but not least, Defi Nicola, please tell us something from you.
00:04:12.004 - 00:04:14.142, Speaker E: Thanks. Hello everyone. From me too.
00:04:14.276 - 00:04:15.678, Speaker A: Can you keep your mic?
00:04:15.844 - 00:04:58.154, Speaker E: Sorry. Hello everyone. It's always glad to see Defi enthusiasts around. I'm Defi Nicola and I'm doing research, ecosystem research and product at Defi Saver which is basically a one stop management dashboard for the Defi lending positions. We also have automation feature to protect you from getting liquidated in Defi. And yeah, I'm kind of a guy that does the research and gives the overview of protocols internally as well as externally about the protocols we should or should not integrate on our platform.
00:04:58.352 - 00:05:32.210, Speaker A: Thank you very much. That's a great product. Awesome. All right guys, so I prepared a few questions for today and I would like to have deeper conversation. I know that I want to cover a lot of topics but hopefully we have time and we can get there. All right, so first I wanted to start from the past and talk about the impact it had on the space because we saw a lot of things happening the last twelve months. Growing L2s, improvements in progress in zero knowledge.
00:05:32.210 - 00:06:09.282, Speaker A: We also a lot of new project launched and there were also some failures and hacks that happened last year. So here comes my first question. Does it work? Okay, I will in a second show you this question, but what do you consider the most significant or intriguing event in the DeFi in the last twelve months and how has it influenced the space? Who wants to take this question first? Any volunteers? Okay, definical, go for it.
00:06:09.416 - 00:07:12.230, Speaker E: Thanks. Well, I would like to emphasize the impact and the importance actually of the merge itself, because I believe that it has brought a lot dynamics when it comes to liquid staking and DFI. In the last year we have seen a massive growth of liquid staking protocols. Now, I think over 20% of all ETH is staked and 40% of all staked ETH is being staked via pools. I think it has had a great impact in DFI because those liquid staking tokens are used across DFI as collateral. And I believe that even the Shanghai upgrade that happened this year has contributed significantly to tightening the peg of those liquid staking tokens and thus lowering the liquidation risks in the DeFi positions that are using lsds as collateral.
00:07:12.810 - 00:07:14.040, Speaker A: That's very important.
00:07:14.490 - 00:07:57.800, Speaker D: All right, I swear that was also my answer. So I'll give you my second answer. Maybe my second answer would have been that obviously we're still in the one year window of FTX blowing up, which obviously was the thing that made global headlines in every country in the world. The flip side of that though, I think is actually that the resilience that a lot of on chain protocols showed following that time period, I think is a strong testament to what many of the people in this room or on stage are building, and I think kind of speaks to why many people work in this industry. I think Defi showed a lot of resilience in that time and something for this part of the industry at least to be proud of. So I'd put that as my significant event.
00:07:58.170 - 00:09:47.960, Speaker C: Yeah, both these answers were part of the common thoughts. So merging them together on why I think that both of them are relevant and where the most crucial that have happened in the last twelve months is that due to the loss of complete blind trust, people crypto users had in centralized exchanges, and the refound desire of self custody and having users own assets on chain, the entire DeFi space has seen again a surge in interest in things that centralize exchanges were just handling through a database. While DeFi does with proof of verification and actual innovation, we are talking about the fact that now tokens staying on a chain are constantly seeking passive yield through, for example, liquid staking instead of just basic assets, or through how users want to participate in a more active way, not only in trading their assets on an exchange, but also in participating as hobbyist market makers on liquidity markets directly on chain. Something that before they were just doing on other platforms. And now together with all the new L2s and fragmentation of liquidity, we are starting to see due to all these roll ups happening in the space, liquidity on chain is going to be the thing that we have to unfold due to all that has happened.
00:09:49.790 - 00:10:29.846, Speaker B: Yes, I suppose I already have a limited choice over there, but let me tell you that it's been a ride these past twelve months, right? So I would say we've had ups and downs starting. So David just reminded me that the merge happened like 15 September. So it's almost a year, it's not a year yet. So fingers crossed, nothing bad is going to happen on that side. But we are well positioned. I would say Lido itself also should get a shout out for holding the door, let's call it, because the redemptions were enabled and nothing scary happened. Like everything works as normal, like new eaters being staked and so on.
00:10:29.846 - 00:11:17.974, Speaker B: Of course, the whole FTX collapse and drama, that's a bigger thing to unfold both on the, let's say, behavioral and people perspective, but also on chain versus off chain trading and activities. I would say going forward. There are a couple of others that I would like to mention. So an example, the deepeg of USDC. In my point of view, that was super intriguing. So I wouldn't call it super tremendous as the previous one, but it was intriguing because people understood that stable coins actually are not always stable, right? And one, you have to understand how they work, like how the reserves work, how they behave on the very stressful moments. Because to me, the one single thing that stablecoins should be, should be stable, right? And it happens that sometimes it's not.
00:11:17.974 - 00:11:42.214, Speaker B: And for oracles as well, it's super important that protocols don't peg $1 to one stablecoin because then when there is a deepg, it can have disastrous effects. Right? And we've seen truly extremely great protocols out there. Having hard coded like $1 to one USDC. Thankfully not so many dramas happen. Another one that I want to mention is Euler. So the whole ural hack, it was huge. It was massive.
00:11:42.214 - 00:12:13.378, Speaker B: Like, I don't remember the exact amount, but it was like $150,000,000 stolen. And in my opinion, the hack is not the most important. For me, the most important is that the entire amount was given back. So as the DFI ecosystem, we also learned how to manage these kind of cris situations. It's not like the protocol disappears and people go underground and you cannot meet them. No, they're taking full action. They are working with the government, they are working with forensic and security companies in order to restore user funds.
00:12:13.378 - 00:13:04.294, Speaker B: In my opinion, it's super, super important because people, when think about defi they think about, okay, it's too scary when something that happens is like end of the world. But it shows that of course there are huge risks, but also we learn more and more as the industry how to manage them and how to basically behave after it happens. So I could go on with many more, but let me also mention two more that are important from my perspective as an oracle. So one is the multichain bridge, like disappearing, let's call it going down. Who has ever used Phantom as the chain? Okay, so it's not the, let's say like 30%, but basically the whole chain almost disappeared because of multichain drama. And right now they're considering whether to become l two or something else. But it also has shown how vulnerable bridges are.
00:13:04.294 - 00:13:48.554, Speaker B: And in case something happens to bridges, there is a huge earthquake on the industry and people who are affected are. Okay, I'm going to use the word fucked, right? It's truly scary. I know people from Phantom. I know people from Phantom foundation and they were like, it's catastrophic to experience something like this. And then the second one. So Terra Luna has been already like over a year ago, right? It was May 2022, but because of terra luna, a lot of traumatic stuff happened in the space. So for example, there was a bad debt on a lending protocol convenience on BNB that has been sitting there for over a year and it was just waiting for BNB to go down below a certain threshold.
00:13:48.554 - 00:14:18.682, Speaker B: And then it had to be eaten by someone. Right, like bad debt. What it means is a loan that the collateral is below the borrowed amount. So there is no point for a borrower to give it back, basically. And at one point it has to be liquidated and somewhere the damage has to be controlled. So over there, it's not ethereum ecosystem, but in my opinion, also a really important ecosystem like BNB chain. The foundation, as far as I remember, basically took the loan and paid the debt, which was also, in my opinion, well handled.
00:14:18.682 - 00:14:24.082, Speaker B: I mean, for the lending protocol, for the users that have loans over there, they weren't affected that much.
00:14:24.216 - 00:14:27.140, Speaker A: Definitely. Thank you, Martin, for this answer.
00:14:28.230 - 00:15:04.510, Speaker E: Speaking of the hacks, I would like just to add something to what Martin said. It's not the event per se, but I would say a new movement, and that is the oracle free protocols. Oracle free lending protocols. Bear in mind, those protocols are just shifting the oracle risks from the core protocols to the users themselves. So the oracles are still going to be used, just not by the protocols themselves, rather than rather by the users using that protocol. So I think that. I like to say that DeFi is moving fast.
00:15:04.510 - 00:15:56.640, Speaker E: And the positive thing about it is that we are looking out for the problems that might appear, like the oracle hacks, like permissionless lending protocols that happened over the last couple of years. And then that brought attention to the builders, who decided to make something different, some new primitive. And now we have a couple of solutions offering those kind of protocols, like pawn finance, buller lending, and arjuna protocol offering, like completely oracle free lending and borrowing. And that's like by protocol design. So I think it's important to emphasize that the builders are shifting their attention to solving real problems to lower the amount of hacks happening.
00:15:57.250 - 00:16:30.070, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. But we still have them example like curve hack lately. That was actually devastating. A little bit. All right, guys, so let's jump to the next topic. Because we spent a lot of time talking about the last events, I wanted to also talk about RWA real world assets. For those who don't know what that like, we had a lot of conversation last year about rwas, like everywhere.
00:16:30.070 - 00:16:54.820, Speaker A: When you didn't go to any conference, you heard about it. Everyone wanted to invest in RWA. Everyone wanted to build RWA. And here comes my next question. How do you view the progress of AWA to date? Do you think the sector can accelerate in the coming years? What factors would enhance its likelihood of success? Who would like to answer first?
00:16:56.310 - 00:18:50.258, Speaker C: Yeah, I can start. As Dex, we have seen the race of RWA from all directions. One of the first questions that we posed ourselves is what has changed now compared to the previous cycle? We always wanted to tokenize Euroboard assets. So why is it picking up now in 2023? Finally, as a topic, and there's various factors, but one is for sure the fact that now passive yield of bare dollars, thanks to, for example, tokenized t bills, are very quickly accelerating the desire of institutions and Defi participants to access this, what could be called free yield, but directly on chain, on their dollars, as liquid staking wants to guarantee the gains from the staked positions of Ethereum or whichever assets they are representing. The dollar also is very static currently, but there is actually yield that could be unlocked behind it and institutions around, if I said the word is a bit too inclusive, let's say Europe and beyond are definitely getting all ends into the tokenization of assets in Europe. Every other month we hear about new legislation passing for institutions being allowed to experiment and test this sector. And the issue with on chain real world asset access is actually that there is a lot of overhead on who's going to verify and authenticate the users.
00:18:50.258 - 00:19:38.950, Speaker C: So we are still at a very juvenile state of being able to open RWA to the masses as currently authentications. Know your customer or know your business, or all these different type of verification systems are still being a very relevant part of as a blocker or as a potential path for success for this. So we will definitely see many protocols getting into the real world assets. I personally think that is one of the reasons that actually may make crypto and Defi meaningful, as we want every user to access on chain finance.
00:19:40.890 - 00:20:15.790, Speaker D: Hang on. So one of the things that my company, Wallfacer Labs, does is we contribute to Trufi, which is an on chain credit market protocol. So within RWA, and actually last year, around the same time, I sat on the same stage with someone from Makerdao and centrifuge and somewhere else, and that was almost about the peak of outstanding loans in the RWA market. And if you go to this website, RWA XYZ, the chart of kind of RWA adoption looks like kind of flat. It's kind of flat, and then it spikes up, and now it's kind of like back in, know, smaller.
00:20:18.690 - 00:20:19.258, Speaker B: You know.
00:20:19.284 - 00:20:55.086, Speaker D: I think RWA has a lot of structural challenges that don't exist with other DeFi protocols. So, for example, in most cases, the LP token that you get back from lending to an RWA protocol will not be transferable. So you can't swap it on a money market. Sorry. You can't swap it on a dex, you can't deposit it as collateral into a money market. And so it lacks some of the composability that exists throughout the rest of defi. So when you look at a trufi, a maple, a goldfinch, a centrifuge, whoever, in general, they're kind of isolated from the rest of the market.
00:20:55.086 - 00:21:48.058, Speaker D: You don't see them as collateral posted at other venues. Now, I think with the current rise of the popularity of T bills, that's maybe starting to change a bit. And I think one of the things that makes T bills maybe more natural for crypto is that each T bill essentially is fully fungible, right? One three month treasury bill is the same as another three month treasury bill. That's not the same as one loan to a trade receivables company and a loan to a emerging market credit type of firm. So I think having more of these fungible types of loans or bonds on chain are probably the right way to go. That said, I still think there's a lot of hurdles just on the overall people have to do Kyc. And it's just a new learning flow for users, essentially.
00:21:48.058 - 00:21:53.890, Speaker D: And Truefi definitely has a tebow portfolio. You should absolutely go check it out just as a small plug, naturally.
00:21:55.430 - 00:22:09.846, Speaker B: Yeah. So maybe let me take a step back first. So who knows what real world assets are. Raise your hand. Okay, let me claim it. 50%, maybe 60%. There are some people a little bit.
00:22:09.868 - 00:22:13.720, Speaker A: Higher, more than use this phantom link.
00:22:14.090 - 00:22:40.958, Speaker B: I'm not good in quick canding. Sorry for that, guys. In any case, I would say real world assets still require a bit more of the distribution when it comes to what stand, what real world assets are. I mean, of course T bills. But then we can also talk about gold, like tokenized gold. It is like real world asset. Then we have real estate, we can have art, we can have wine, and we have many other things, like basically tangible things.
00:22:40.958 - 00:23:16.074, Speaker B: So to unpack all of that, that's pretty funny that we have this panel today, because today I give you some alpha. 03:00 p.m. If you go on Twitter to at redstone Underscore Finance Defi Sorry. You are going to see a result, a fruit of one month of research that our team did together with Chaos Labs, one of the leading risk assessment companies, and we published a 30 page report on real world assets. We analyzed 31 projects. We had like over 20 contributors to the report. So it's a super heavy stuff.
00:23:16.074 - 00:23:51.590, Speaker B: So I tell you, free p m. You check it out. And as for the question itself, tbls and protocols such as companies such as centrifuge, Ondo, Flux matrix, Doc, all of them are pushing boundaries in that sense. And I will let Defi Nicola to talk probably more on the Defi end. What I want to also touch upon is ESG. So companies that are doing like for example, carbon credits and stuff around more sustainability. So there are companies such protocol, Zenken, Klimadao and others that are also expanding within this area.
00:23:51.590 - 00:24:20.574, Speaker B: And in my opinion, in the long term, it's going to be also a super important vertical in real world assets. And then the second one, angle, you can check angle money. What the guys are doing, they're creating a stablecoin. And right now they are utilizing real world assets to back the stablecoin, for example, t bills, but also some etfs of european bonds. So it tries to bring less risk and more stability to stablecoins in general.
00:24:20.692 - 00:24:23.140, Speaker A: Thank you, if any. Paola, please.
00:24:23.750 - 00:25:41.366, Speaker E: Pretty good answers so far. I would just like to add that I think the tokenization of financial instruments from the stratify world can be important for DeFi because it brings a lot more use cases like fractional ownership. Those tokens, whether they are fungible or not fungible, are easy to transfer on chain. They also bring new investment opportunities. And I think there is, of course, some regulatory friction, because we would need institutions to onboard and start to support and recognize those kind of assets. On the other hand, there is always a risk of the custodian providing and tokenizing this kind of service. One interesting approach, in my opinion, is what maker is doing currently with their current stage of their end game, and that is sort of diversifying the centralization risk by having, like last time I checked, ten different custodians, which they are using their collateral, their tokens, their real world assets to collateralize their stablecoin die.
00:25:41.366 - 00:25:57.790, Speaker E: So I think it's an interesting approach. So they have different exposures to different custodians. I mean, in the long run, that could maybe the solution of just not having the centralization risk that high when it comes to custodians.
00:25:58.770 - 00:26:26.726, Speaker A: Thank you guys for the answers. And maybe now let's talk about stablecoins a little bit, because that's very important topic, and we can't talk about DeFi without stable coins, and we already mentioned that a few times. So what approach to stablecoins do you find the most reliable on, or you like the most? And why? Maybe. Let's make it quick answers. Maybe. Who wants to start that?
00:26:26.828 - 00:26:55.700, Speaker E: I can go first. Okay, go on. In my opinion, the LUSD, the liquidities LUSD is, I think, the most resilient one, because it is immutable protocol, and it has a pretty straightforward redemption mechanism where you can redeem one LUSD for $1 of ETH, and it's like completely on chain and transparent. So I think I'll go with that one as a short answer.
00:27:02.390 - 00:27:51.538, Speaker D: I think the market has kind of spoken in that it likes us dollar backed stablecoins the most. Just tether and USDC basically dwarf everything else. I will say that I find curve's new stablecoin CRV USD to be really kind of innovative. They have this llama, maybe you know what it stands for, the soft liquidation type of module that basically operates behind the stablecoin, so that if the value of your collateral is slipping, they'll slowly liquidate you into stables, and basically vice versa as well if the value starts to increase, which I think is just something kind of new and different in the market at the same time. It also, we have a blog post about this on Wallfacerlabs. Substac.com basically looking at how it feels like everyone today is planning to launch a stablecoin or is probably thinking about it.
00:27:51.538 - 00:28:13.900, Speaker D: Obviously Aave has go which they've launched very recently, currently kind of struggling with the know. I think there's a lot of things that are now launching stablecoins around liquid staking tokens as well. And I think it's just within Defi maybe there's not a ton of great business models, but stablecoins certainly are one. And so a lot of people are interested in that launching something.
00:28:16.590 - 00:29:23.058, Speaker C: With Trader Joe. We have been in close proximity with quite some stable coins over the time. We were the highest resource of Mim. We had a lot of ust on the chain. And what we have learned over time is that leaderless stablecoins are usually best. And what might sound boring, but I think that USDC and Euroc, so the circle dollar and circle Euro being battle tested from a very competent company that is running it feels very solid at this point. The approach that people should take with stablecoins is just not to fall in love with their stables and to just consider the reserve and to stay as safe as possible from whatever option that there could be.
00:29:23.058 - 00:30:02.560, Speaker C: But yeah, I will also say that tetter is an interesting company that has a lot of. Seems to create a lot of animated conversations. I've listened to some Arduino's talks on how it is being used a lot in newly developing countries. It is very interesting how people are very emotional about stable coins. We shall not bring any emotion, they shall just try to be stable. But that's what we are all trying to achieve on stability and long lasting experience.
00:30:04.290 - 00:30:38.994, Speaker B: Yeah. So just to recap, the three major categories in stablecoins are fiat backed. So USDC, USDT, Tether, TUSD for example and PayPal's stablecoin that has been announced recently. The second is CDP, so corrupted debt position stablecoins for example, go curve, USD, LUSD and so on and so forth. And the third category, which is probably the smallest, is like algo stables. Has anyone heard of UST? Yeah, no one uses that anymore, right? Because it deepaked and it's non existent anymore. And many people felt it very badly.
00:30:38.994 - 00:31:08.414, Speaker B: Right. But there is also for example, fracs that is doing a hybrid, let's call it. There is mentor on silo chain. So there is quite a few. And in my opinion, the three most exciting right now to my perspective one are CDP is backed by liquid staked assets. So for example, raft, gravita, prisma, finance, what these guys are doing is what liquidy does. So taking if, but instead of if you take staked eth, you take sweat.
00:31:08.414 - 00:31:34.342, Speaker B: If you take ethx. So various types of lsts and then you produce a stablecoin. Second is angle, they are creating an ag euro. So euro stablecoin. And as I said, they are experimenting with real world assets. In my opinion, in the long term it's going to be super important category as the collateral. And last but not least, I already mentioned that Frax, Frax is also trying to expand right now to reward assets and they have a very solid team and has been steadily growing.
00:31:34.342 - 00:31:37.900, Speaker B: So I would look for some innovation over there.
00:31:38.670 - 00:32:09.720, Speaker A: Thank you guys, that's definitely interesting. And obviously we can't have conference in 2023 without mentioning, even mentioning a L2s. So here is my next question about it. What challenges could the expansion of L2 pose for DFI? How might L2 aid crypto's overall growth? Anyone? Maybe this time someone else might start. I don't know. David, would you like L2?
00:32:10.330 - 00:34:25.380, Speaker C: We launched on Arbitrum last Christmas and now basically we have seen so many new L2s, not only in trying to get mind share, but also being spun up or wanting to call themselves the next big thing happening. And there are some aspects about L2 that people have to consider. One is fragmentation of liquidity is technically bad because the more fragmented the liquidity we have on DeFi on 30 chains, the less efficient this liquidity is going to be. And we are just overcomplicating then access to efficient markets which need active participants, good protocols that can unleash this efficiency. But what we really need to unlock regarding L2 is mostly cross chain interoperability, which I think is the next big step that will happen in the space when we talk about ZK chains or EVM compatible chains or alt layer ones. The main thing that I think we will be ending up trying to solve is cross chain interoperability of liquidity pools and liquidity usage amongst users. The fact that they currently have to bridge their token five times a day in order to balance their liquidity across different chains is something that we expect evolutions of L2 to try to solve, but it's going to take time and we need to solve this faster also, hopefully thanks to all the different bridging technologies that are becoming popular and of daily use.
00:34:25.380 - 00:34:34.430, Speaker C: So I don't know if you have different angles around. What do you think challenge wise?
00:34:34.510 - 00:35:24.542, Speaker D: I was going to very much agree with you actually. I think each of the individual l two s is doing a lot for interoperability within their ecosystem. So optimism's got the super chain and ZK syncs got the hyperchain, and arbitrum has something, I'm sure. And those things will all be able to move very freely between each other and not have that liquidity fragmentation, as you said. But between each of these different ecosystems, we're going to have a billion dollars here and billions of dollars here. And it actually kind of reminds me of when centralized exchanges at one point used to have multiple stablecoin denominated pairs. So binance, for example, would have markets denominated in tether and BUSD and USDC fragmenting liquidity across these three different markets.
00:35:24.542 - 00:36:14.100, Speaker D: And then FTX, ironically enough, introduced just one USD denominated market. And that was actually great for liquidity. I have no idea what the parallel is in the l two world, but I agree. And then there was a second part to the question, right, which is how my l two s overall growth. This is kind of a new opinion that maybe I wouldn't have said a couple of weeks ago, but with the rise of friendtech, which obviously has been very popular, it's not that that couldn't have existed on Ethereum layer one, but that lower fees make it more accessible to a wider cohort of users. So maybe we will actually finally see some more mainstream consumer type applications as a result of L2s. And I think that'd be very exciting for everyone in the space.
00:36:16.310 - 00:37:01.682, Speaker B: Yes, I love that answer, actually, of your davide like liquidity is the single most troublesome thing when it comes to manual tools popping out. And as an oracle, that's super challenging for us, because if you have a local liquidity at a certain chain, you can fairly easily manipulate the price and then you create a hack and whatever. Therefore, as Redstone right now, we deliver not only like spot price, so what's the price of a given asset, but we also give liquidity at certain pools from which we pull. So that would help the DeFi protocols to mitigate such events. I'm not going to repeat. So maybe let's introduce something new. I mentioned phantom already.
00:37:01.682 - 00:37:53.666, Speaker B: Also on this conference, we have silo or telo. So these are the two chains that consider becoming like l two, so called on Ethereum, instead of keeping being as an l one. And Eigen layer, like the restaking protocol, is also enabling that innovation and will probably, in my opinion, be one of the driving factor for innovation in that space. Like popping up basically the new l two s, one of the thing about the bridging I see is I usually look into the past and try to analyze the trends and how they will apply in the current form. So right now, at least in Poland, if you want to send money from one bank to another, and these are not the same banks that say mbank to ing, then you have to wait for these sessions, right? Like for the clearing. If you want to send money internationally, then you probably have to wait for a day or even more, right?
00:37:53.768 - 00:37:54.740, Speaker A: Seven days.
00:37:55.110 - 00:38:35.540, Speaker B: Seven days, right. Or it depends on the bank. But basically right now, the time you have to wait between the l two s is lower. In my opinion, as we will be going forward, it's going to be even lower and lower as for the time waiting to get from one chain to the other. And I hope within, let's say one, two, maybe five years, we are going to create a seamless experience going there and over, because with the status of banks, I don't see any improvement. It's been the same for years and we kind of accepted that, right? Whereas in DFI it's not true. Like in DFI, people try to push the frontier and improve and try to minimize the cost and the time that you have to wait.
00:38:37.350 - 00:39:29.570, Speaker E: When it comes to challenges of l two s, I would like to see how many people in the room believe that decentralizing the sequencer of l two s is the biggest problem currently. The biggest issue. Okay. Not a lot of people, because I'm happy to see that actually, because I would argue that, because when it comes to challenges, I think that having fraud proofs and removing the instant updatability by multisigs is way higher on the priority list than decentralizing sequencer. But it's definitely a challenge that we should tackle in the long run. And I would just agree with that. Liquidity fragmentation is definitely presenting an issue.
00:39:29.570 - 00:39:48.060, Speaker E: Like for projects like DeFi, say, we are constantly in the discussion about where we should go next and which one should we choose to onboard our users because a lot of them still have some security issues and we need to pick the ones with the lowest number of those.
00:39:48.990 - 00:40:24.766, Speaker A: Thank you. And we can check out ltobits.com to view all the data you're talking about. Thank you. I wanted to also talk about maybe a little bit about zero knowledge because we see a lot of innovations there and it's obviously like very difficult topic and we won't go into the deep map, et cetera. I just wanted to ask you about the impact it has on defi. So my next question is how might advances in zero knowledge impact defi defi.
00:40:24.766 - 00:40:28.040, Speaker A: Nicola, would you like to start now? Go.
00:40:28.810 - 00:41:19.990, Speaker E: Well, I think that the Zk impact on DFI is actually pretty indirectly being indirectly because DL two s are probably like the biggest use case of ZK we have seen so far, besides privacy. And I think that DL two s has onboarded new use cases for DFI, actually, because we now can have projects that are doing leverage trading, that are creating leverage trading protocols which need high transaction throughput, which need low transaction fees that we didn't have on l one in DFI. And I think that's like the indirect impact that the Zk is having on DFI.
00:41:20.490 - 00:41:24.194, Speaker A: Thank you, Martin. Any thoughts on zero knowledge?
00:41:24.322 - 00:41:54.222, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm very big fan of L two s. Like ZK. L two s, Scroll Lina, Zksync, Starknet and so on and so forth. And we are going to see more of them, but I will be short this time. Storage proofs. Storage proofs are going to revolutionize in the long run how we do cross chain messaging right now. They are fairly slow and expensive, but as such companies as Risk zero and other efforts like Herodotus is doing, like, storage proofs themselves.
00:41:54.222 - 00:42:20.940, Speaker B: But risk Zero is like lowering the cost of proof creation and verification. Right. So basically minimizing the cost in the time of proofs to be created and validated, I would see in the long term to be truly revolutionary, but it's going to be something similar to, let me call it, for example, smartphones. So it's not going to happen overnight. It's going to be rather steady. At one point, you're going to realize, hey, I cannot live without that.
00:42:21.550 - 00:42:25.180, Speaker A: Thank you, Martin, anyone?
00:42:27.950 - 00:42:31.210, Speaker D: I think from the user perspective.
00:42:33.490 - 00:42:34.046, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:42:34.068 - 00:43:15.670, Speaker D: I feel like there hasn't actually been a huge pull from users to demand more privacy in a lot of their on chain transactions. I think it's one of those things where people might say that they want it, but to the extent that they have to do any sort of additional action to get privacy, the demonstrated action is that they don't actually do it. Maybe there is some case to be made that institutions will find privacy more interesting for large scale kind of trade transactions, to the extent that things like that ever happen on a blockchain. But, yeah, I actually don't have many strong opinions on privacy.
00:43:15.830 - 00:43:17.130, Speaker A: Thank you. Zike.
00:43:17.950 - 00:44:46.310, Speaker C: Yeah. When users of our decks ask every other week when ZK chain, and then we try to understand what they're looking for, then the answer is always just deploying on that ZK chain. And this represents often just the fact that we are still at an early stage of completely unleashing what ZK technologies will mean for real users. Because deploying an EVM compatible protocol on a ZK chain is not the end goal of what zero knowledge was meant to be. I'm sure that many new ways to protect the identity of users and transactions is going to be seeked, especially in the real world asset sector or by institutions which are more desiring to look for privacy by default instead of just nice to have. And we will see then next iterations that will use real ZK knowledge probably in the next wave of new protocols that are going to happen. So I will say just pure EVM compatibility.
00:44:46.310 - 00:44:55.926, Speaker C: It's not the end goal, but we will get into really finding great use cases for this sector, hopefully.
00:44:56.038 - 00:45:12.000, Speaker A: Thank you guys. We are running out of time, but we have one more question to go. So guys, which upcoming projects or ideas are you the most enthusiastic about? Who wants to start? Okay, you can go for it.
00:45:12.870 - 00:45:57.950, Speaker E: Well, there is a bunch of those, to be honest. The project I'm really looking forward to is, for example, liquidity version two. They're sort of building a new stable coin that will be reserve backed and that will use perpetuals as a hedging mechanism. Another 1 may be something that is cooking in the Defi saver labs. Should I call? And that's Eth saver. You're basically releasing it on Monday. And it's the project for managing your leverage, staking positions and creating them in one click and shifting between different underlying protocols you're using to gain that leverage.
00:45:57.950 - 00:46:07.202, Speaker E: I don't know. I would leave the others. I mean, we're short of time. But yeah, I have a full list of those.
00:46:07.336 - 00:46:17.090, Speaker A: Okay, thank you guys. You can ask always Defi Nicola, after the panel about his most interesting projects. Yeah, Ryan, go for it.
00:46:17.160 - 00:46:17.538, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:17.624 - 00:47:10.310, Speaker D: One thing that I was going to touch on actually, you mentioned it kind of earlier, is that I feel that in onchain lending there's a lot of interesting new and innovative things coming to market. Whether it's ajna blend from blur, even things like compound v three, which took a very different design approach to how to do an onchain money market morpho I find very exciting. There's a lot of interesting stuff happening in lending and I think it's really cool to see that type of innovation coming from a bunch of different, you know, maybe I just contrast that a bit with the deck space. Excluding Trader Joe, of course, which I know continues to do interesting things, it seems. Know some things like uniswap have maybe kind of moved into the mode of they're just trying to kind of gather all of the features rather than a bunch of smaller players having a chance to rise up. So I've been kind of newly interested and invigorated by on chain lending markets.
00:47:10.650 - 00:47:11.910, Speaker A: Thank you, Ryan.
00:47:12.410 - 00:48:25.258, Speaker C: Yeah, already hinted at the multi chain liquidity aspect, so what I'm really looking forward currently we are very strong partners with layer zero and we are also interested. And our token is an oft token. We are looking into messaging as the next way for protocols to interoperate across all the chains. They are. And what I'm really looking forward to is seeing how messaging could solve the multi block delay of cross chain swapping and trading together with the possibility of users to interact on multiple chains by just doing a transaction on one chain and transmitting tokens, messages and executions all within a few seconds. If we get to unlock this, we are going to be in a much better space overall in Defi. So really looking forward to see where we get there.
00:48:25.424 - 00:48:26.380, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:48:27.070 - 00:48:50.114, Speaker B: Yes. So let me maybe make the full cycle. We started at the very beginning with demerge, which enabled like the LST boom. And in my opinion, the boom is still exploding. So we have, what, 22% of east staked. So in comparison to other proof of stake chains, it's really little. So there is still a lot of ether to be staked and like innovation to be pushed towards that direction.
00:48:50.114 - 00:49:08.966, Speaker B: And Lido has become like a kind of, let's say, established golden standard over there. But I see a lot of innovation happening from other protocols such as stakewise. They are releasing their v three very soon. Like os eth. There is swell, truly. Guys check out swell. Like what their guys are doing is tremendous.
00:49:08.966 - 00:50:10.586, Speaker B: One, they are having a very security approach, and two, they're making gamification of staking ether, which is like, wow, really crazy. And they are growing all the time. There's stader, there are these CDP stablecoins that are utilizing the staked ether assets and then creating stablecoin again. The second is RWA already talked about that, but centrifuge on the flux matrix, docs doc and so on and so forth. Last but not least, haven't mentioned yet on the panel are perps. In my opinion, okay, many people are already fed up with perps. I'm fed up with people trying to raise money for perp, but I'm not fed up with innovation with perps because perps is super hard and for example, one vertical within perps that I really would like to see is making them a bit more user friendly because I see them being very well used by people who know how to use it, but I see even more people who don't know how to use it burned with them, like not understanding what cost, what, how to make it, how to use it, and so on and so forth.
00:50:10.586 - 00:50:16.866, Speaker B: So maybe a bit more even education within that space. Yes, I would say perps is still also a viable market.
00:50:16.968 - 00:50:27.480, Speaker A: Right. Thank you guys. Thank you. It was really amazing to have you here. Maybe we can take one question from the audience, like very quick. Anyone wants to ask?
00:50:28.010 - 00:50:30.918, Speaker E: Yeah, in the front here, please, for.
00:50:30.924 - 00:50:32.230, Speaker B: The mic, for the stream.
00:50:32.730 - 00:50:40.362, Speaker E: What's your opinion on Frac's ETH and their division between staking and trading as.
00:50:40.416 - 00:50:44.134, Speaker C: Two different assets in their min maxing.
00:50:44.182 - 00:50:47.050, Speaker E: Of the yield that comes into the staked eth?
00:50:49.470 - 00:52:00.990, Speaker C: Yeah, it's actually a true problem to push volume versus TVL, for example, as a Dex, if we will have the need to push the two different directions, we will have to implement completely different strategies as incentivizing volume is not the same as incentivizing passive liquidity. On one side, you want market makers to be extremely efficient when you want to push volume. So you want to go for example, with a concentrated liquidity protocol, while when you want, because then high trading efficiency is key and that could be much more leveraged compared to the liquidity that is actually available, while the staking part is actually something that is very passive. Stake and forget. And then it's just normally a classic farmer where you want to gain your passive yield and just not look at that anymore. But that cannot really be used that liquidity for the trading part, as then it implies a certain exposure towards impermanent loss.
00:52:03.930 - 00:52:09.178, Speaker A: All right, guys, thank you very much. Thank you for the panel and round of applause.
00:52:09.274 - 00:52:10.346, Speaker E: Thank you for listening.
00:52:10.458 - 00:52:12.334, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Thank you.
00:52:12.372 - 00:52:12.700, Speaker D: Thank you, guys.
