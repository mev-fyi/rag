00:00:02.090 - 00:00:57.546, Speaker A: So now let me tell you just a few words about Alex before we connect him. So Alex is a very well known Persona in the Defi and in the blockchain and ethereum space. Alex was, I believe he was like fifth, maybe 6th, one of the first employees of Ethereum foundation. Just, just very early after the ICO happened and the whole thing started to be shaping. Alex was involved in very base projects in Ethereum space. He created blockies of the small icons that you can see either in metamask or in many other applications. That was idea that came from Alex and he created that and he worked on many interesting projects.
00:00:57.546 - 00:01:30.700, Speaker A: First wallets. Together with Alex, we were working on unilogging. And today Alex is working. And I want to mention before the final thing, Alex was involved in white hat hack when there was a hack in the wallet that led into leaking a lot of money. Alex was there in the room when they hacked those wallets. Take the money and return the money to the holders so that the black hats and the thieves could not utilize the hack to do that. That was a huge event a few years ago.
00:01:30.700 - 00:01:58.178, Speaker A: Now today Alex is working for balancer. And Balancer is one of the top Defi projects we have today in the space. They are second to uniswap and that's pretty much it. And they have very innovative idea. If Defi space is not innovative idea, if uniswap is not innovative, decentralized exchange, then balancer is even more innovative. And all about that. Alex will tell you just in a moment.
00:01:58.178 - 00:02:07.310, Speaker A: So without further ado, I think we can have Alex joining us now. And here comes Alex. Alex, great to see you.
00:02:07.480 - 00:02:11.240, Speaker B: Thanks for the lovely introduction. Thank you.
00:02:11.770 - 00:02:36.606, Speaker A: Just want to say before you start, it's a great pleasure to have you today. We have a lot of viewers, so it's always a little bit weird in your mole when you talk to the screen, but just by amount of questions that we had for the first presentation, I think there is plenty of people listening. So without further ado, Alex van I.
00:02:36.628 - 00:02:44.640, Speaker B: Will share my screen. Let's see here. Okay. Can you see it?
00:02:49.570 - 00:02:55.750, Speaker A: Can I proceed? Yeah, everything fine.
00:02:55.900 - 00:02:59.894, Speaker B: I'm leaving you alone, but I will.
00:02:59.932 - 00:03:03.014, Speaker A: Rejoin if something happens. But I think it's going to be all fine.
00:03:03.132 - 00:03:31.806, Speaker B: Perfect. So this is actually my first presentation about balancer. I joined the project in December last year, so I'm still learning a lot. And during the process of me learning, I always like to try to make them into presentations. So this presentation is a lot the process of how I learn what balancer is. And the point of view of what exactly that is and what attracted me to the project. Right.
00:03:31.806 - 00:04:03.050, Speaker B: So, first of all, this is sugar cane. I'm in Brazil. We have a lot of sugar cane here. And you probably know that if you take sugar cane and you add it to a meal, you get sugar. But the other thing you also get is baguettes. And bagasse is a byproduct of sugarcane. But turns out, and that usually was just discarded, it turns out that baguette is actually very rich in energy, and you can make it a biodiver out of it.
00:04:03.050 - 00:04:33.618, Speaker B: That can be more valuable in some places than sugar. So you can say that cane, if you mute the cane, you get sugar and the gas. But you can also say that, in fact, you get the gas and a byproduct of it is sugar. In the same way, if you get arbitrage on a curve, you get exchange and liquidity poop. That's sort of like amm's work. That's sort of uniswap work. But you can imagine that as the can maybe.
00:04:33.618 - 00:05:26.366, Speaker B: What if I told you liquidity pools, the project is the main product and the exchange is just a byproduct? So what happens? So, first, let's talk about how automatic market maker works, right? So most automated market makers units, the most famous one is the most used one. They use a constant product function that just means there's a curve, that there's a constant that is always. If you multiply x by y, there will always be a constant. The curve looks something like this. And why does a curve like this magically make the project work? Right, so first, let's explore the characteristic of what this curve means. So basically it means that one is the. Sorry about the types.
00:05:26.366 - 00:06:21.862, Speaker B: I just had a presentation set up and had to change the computer last minute, so all my phones are messed up. But you can imagine that one of those, the x axis is the amount of tokens a in a pool, and the other will be the amount of tokens being a pool. An interesting thing is like a uniswap or ne, they actually don't know anything about the prices. All the information they have to work is the amount of tokens they have in a pool. And whenever you move and you add more tokens in the pool, in one side, the ball simply moves on that direction. Right? And you can imagine the way you can think of it, of course, the exact formula is you actually get the delta of those two. But you can imagine as if you're getting the amount it's sort of similar to getting the amount of tokens similar to that.
00:06:21.862 - 00:07:12.022, Speaker B: Right. So as you move the pool on that direction now, you're getting more green tokens than the blue tokens. And if you move it in the other direction now, you get more blue tokens than the green tokens until it reaches some equilibrium. But why exactly does it work that that equilibrium always be the same prices? And not only you reach an ecligum where you have the same prices, but you reach an ecligum where the liquidity pool always will have the same amount of value in the pool. Which is interesting, because again, unisup doesn't know what is the price of the pool. It just happens that every liquidity pool will have an equal amount of ether, an equal amount of dai or whatever tokens that is. Right.
00:07:12.022 - 00:07:54.930, Speaker B: So if we need to think about, the interesting thing is that actually there's nothing to do with the product function curve. It would work the same way if it was a curve like this, or a curve like this, or even whatever. A curve like this. It doesn't actually matter which type of curve you use. It's just that we are using this constant product because it's a practical curve and there are some interesting characteristics about it. But what I want you to think about is the value of tokens in the pool. Right? How do we think about what is the value of tokens in the pool? And of course, value is the amount times the price.
00:07:54.930 - 00:08:24.080, Speaker B: So you can think of the price as a multiplicator. So if this token a is worth $2, you can imagine it as a multiplication. And then we can simply fold that line. And if the amount of tokens b is 50, like the other tokens were $0.50, think of it as housing. And then all you need to do is get the half. Folded it in, right? So this is really the amount.
00:08:24.080 - 00:09:09.430, Speaker B: Now you can see that the values, while you had equal amounts of tokens, the values are completely wrong. Which means that basically, if you give them tokens b, you get tokens a and it's free money. If you get one dollars of token b in the pool, you get $4 out of token a, which of course you should. Then people are going to go to here. So imagine that as sort of like two vectors. When they are out of equilibrium, people push them in one direction. And the more you push, and the more you put token b and token a, the more they will reach some sort of equilibrium.
00:09:09.430 - 00:09:38.594, Speaker B: I'm doubling one side and half the other side. Imagine it's all happening faster than the price is changing. Right. Until you reach an equilibrium. And from that point on, you can see now that the green line is bigger than the blue line. So it's going to push it down again to that other point. So I want you to think of EmN not really as mathematics, but really as physics.
00:09:38.594 - 00:10:27.074, Speaker B: It's basically, imagine there's a ball on those two points. That's the gravity. It's going to find the little point where the gravity sort of reaches an equilibrium and it's going to stick there. And because it will stop that. It will stop at a point where value times amount is equal. That's why you get a liquidity pool, in which meaning that if you add liquidity to uniswap and you add eater and you add die, if you add $100 of eater and $100 of die, you always have an equal amount of eater, equal amount of die. And why is this important? It's important because it means that uniswap is used for trading.
00:10:27.074 - 00:11:16.150, Speaker B: It was built for trading. And as a byproduct, you get a self balancing portfolio of two tokens. Balancer actually was created almost at the same time as Uniswap and in order to create a self balancing portfolio. And they ended up finding independently in the same solution of one, but from the other direction. Meaning balancer creates self balancing portfolios for any number of tokens. And as a byproduct, you get trading. So the idea here is that you can create any sort of self balancing portfolio for a number of tokens.
00:11:16.150 - 00:11:50.042, Speaker B: And the traders, the arbitrage people, they will be the ones that will be managing, and they will be automatically changing the amounts in your portfolio. And why that is important. Right. Let's think about sizes of product. Right now, balancer is at number ten in the typos we just crossed. The 1 billion mark maker has 6 billion av. Five compound, four curve tree subtree.
00:11:50.042 - 00:13:16.138, Speaker B: Right? If we think about them visually, it's going to look something like that. If $1 million is just the size of the dot in the eye, then $1 billion is this ball, which is big, and that would be the amount of uniswap, like 3 billion and $5 billion, which means, look, balancer is big, but who is really bigger, right? If you compare it for Robin Hood, which I suppose it's going to go down a little bit now, but last time we checked, they had $20 billion in assets, which, I mean, it's a lot bigger, but even bigger than that would be Berkshire Hathaway. That's just a fund, right? And what they do in the fund is that they have a self balanced portfolio. They keep 20%, 10% in cash, 20% in option in this, stock options, 30% in this and that. Right? And usually what they do is they just set up a strategy in the beginning of the year, and they just really follow it. Right? So maybe if you could automate it, even. Berkshire highway is small fish, if you think about it.
00:13:16.138 - 00:13:56.742, Speaker B: So this is vanguard, which is not showing, but I think it's $5 trillion. So, again, this is us. This is home. The pale blue dot, right? This tiny thing there, which represents balancer, is a billion dollars. All those tiny moons there, the little circles, this whole thing that our friends have been talking about, defi, we are just like a tiny moon compared to the big stars. That is most of those index funds and those automated etfs. And my point being, we can probably automate that.
00:13:56.742 - 00:14:42.662, Speaker B: If you want ethereum to be the future of finance, then we probably can think of, how can we automate Berkshire Hatway? Can we just replace every asset manager at Bangward with just a bot, where you set a strategy and you let the bot do everything? And I think that's an interesting proposition. So we can think of pools. Bounds or. Pools are mostly just three things. There's a bunch of assets, there's a strategy, which is a trade curve. You can set, really any sort of trade curve that you want. And there's a governance, which, of course, can be done.
00:14:42.662 - 00:15:36.070, Speaker B: You can set it. I'm going to create this pool in the beginning, and it's going to be like the same thing forever. Right? No, governance is a type of governance, and with just those three things, you can build a lot of different things. My point really is that I see pools as almost a new primitive, new economic primitive, that you can build a lot of cool things, and, in fact, if you're building things with them, it saves you a lot of time and trouble. So, for instance, you can start with basic pools. Basic pools are what we have right now in monster, which is just, you create, at the moment, up to eight tokens, and you set, I want to have 64 of this, 40% of that. I want to have eight tokens with this distribution.
00:15:36.070 - 00:17:00.254, Speaker B: And then you set up a trading fee and a few other things, and you have, like, you can put a million dollars in, or a billion dollars, or one dollars, whatever, and pool always self balance. And it self balances because whenever there is indifference of the size of the pool by people trading in the balancer exchange, which is connected with other exchanges, and there are people running arbitrage bots on it. They will make sure that Europe will always go back to where it was. An interesting thing is that instead of paying an asset manager to make sure your money is with the right proportions, what actually is happening that you're being paid to do it, because whenever someone trades, they pay liquidity fees and that liquidity fees will go back to the liquidity owners. So it's a great way. Imagine instead of you paying berkshire hard way, you can be paid by just putting your money there, which sort of how it should work, but you can do a lot of other things. So for instance, Pydao is building autonomous index funds and balancer.
00:17:00.254 - 00:18:19.590, Speaker B: They are using a smartphone in their back end. And basically what they do is they help create you a dow. And it's great because balancer is super flexible. You can just plug any sort of ownership on that. And every pool has their own pool tokens, so you can use that pool automatically to be your user's voting mechanism, right? So you can imagine a discussion of reinvesting or investing or cash flow or anything as just you trading percentage. You can say, look, we have right now a million dollar, half of it's in Ethereum, half of it is in Dai, and you can say, look, I want to invest $100,000 in this project that in the size of balancer, which is simply mean, we're going to take a little slice of 1% of the die amount and we are going to convert that in 1% of this redeemable token or this other token that represents somehow your project, right? And the nice thing of this is that. Let's talk about Molokdao.
00:18:19.590 - 00:19:25.780, Speaker B: I'm not sure if you have heard of, but Molokdao is a very popular minimum governance now, in which idea is that people discuss, people vote where the money goes, where the money doesn't go. And if you disagree with whatever with discussion at any point, you can simply quit the Dow and get the tokens out of it and you're good for it. An interesting thing, by putting that on a smart pool, you get a lot of that automatically. Because the minute you hold a balancer pool, token of any pool, it means that you can always trade that. You can always burn your tokens and burn your liquidity tokens and then get the tokens themselves, right? Another project, Catnip. Catnip became very popular at the end of last year because they try to bring prediction markets. They are building prediction markets on balancer, right? Now.
00:19:25.780 - 00:20:14.340, Speaker B: And they do a prediction market as simple as uniswap. If you go to their website, it was like, oh, who is going to win this election? You either buy Biden token or you buy a Trump token. And that was it, right? It was relational market stripped down to bare minimums. And they are building it on balancer, pidao. Primedao is building liquidity bootstrapping pools, balancer. So that's another very interesting thing that's happening. I know there are a lot of people using ldps, and I want to explain what they are, because I like to think of liquidity bootstrapping as almost the new.
00:20:14.340 - 00:20:52.718, Speaker B: It's almost like the new ICO, right? You want to raise money or you want to launch a token. And how do you do it? You probably heard about average dollar cost averaging. Dollar cost averaging, meaning? Means you have $100. Let's say you have $100 and you want to buy $100 in bitcoin, right? Or you have $1,000. You want to buy $1,000 in bitcoin. You could just go there and buy $1,000 in bitcoin. What will happen is that if the price goes up, yeah, luck, you, you got in a nice moment.
00:20:52.718 - 00:21:59.870, Speaker B: But if the price goes down, then you could have bought a lot of bitcoin for cheaper, right? So instead of doing just buying $1,000 in bitcoin, suppose that you buy $100 or $10 every day, or one dollars every day until you get every month, every week, you buy a little bit of bitcoin. What's going to happen is in the end, when you get $1,000, you're going to be exposed, basically to the average moving price of bitcoin. When bitcoin was going down, you bought more of it. When bitcoin was going up, you bought less of it. But in the end of today, in the end of the period, you have bought $1,000 in bitcoin, probably at a much better price than if you had randomly picking picked any moment. So liquidity bootstrapping tool does that. But if a pool that you set to automatically change the amount so it starts, let's say, 99% f and 1% a new token, right? It can be if, it can be die.
00:21:59.870 - 00:22:58.102, Speaker B: Let's say it stores an 80% of if or a very popular token, and it stores as a 1% of one token. Suppose that one token doesn't have really a lot of liquidity in it, so you don't even know what is the correct price that this token should have. The cool thing is that if you start a pool with a million dollars of die or ether on it, or of course these million dollars can be by multiple people. I'm not saying you need a billionaire to do that. The point is that the pool will start with a tiny percentage of that, of the token, which the market will sort of try to figure out what is the correct price of that token. And then the next day will be 2%, and the next day it will be 3%. The next day will be 4%.
00:22:58.102 - 00:24:07.682, Speaker B: What's going to happen is while the market is still trying to figure out what amount of tokens, what is the value of that token, you're starting to give it more and more and more liquidity until by the end of it, you basically sold oliter. You bought that token at the price that you helped discover. So the advantage of that is that first of all, you don't know the market price of a token. And that can work with any market price of the token, right? Because it's always at, let's say at this week it's going to be a 5%, it's going to sell, buy more that token. Suddenly the token price goes up or down. Your pool will buy and sell ether, sell the token, buy the token and sell eater to always have 5%, right? So the pool is sort of absorbing, it's absorbing the changes in the token. By the end of it, you get great liquidity for a token.
00:24:07.682 - 00:24:57.466, Speaker B: So advantages number one for people buying this token, it allows you to buy a token that you don't know the price without being too much exposed to price variance. You are going to be basically buying that token over a week or two weeks or a month, depending on the liquidity bootstrapping event. For the token launchers, it's great because they are helping the market figure out, and by the end of the event they will have a huge liquidity for that token. And now it's harder to move the market around. So the goal here, that's all happening in Baltimore right now. But right now we are really working on V two. And what V two does is interesting.
00:24:57.466 - 00:26:57.614, Speaker B: First of all, we are really focusing on making it gas efficiency. The way that every automatic market maker works right now is that every pool holds their own tokens and you plug in the curve and it's one contract, right? What we are doing is that instead of adding all that logic in the same contract, we are working with a very secure and super audited contract that it's going to hold all the tokens and you connect emms into it, right? And I think it's fantastic because you can create any sort of emm you want and just plug it in and say this is how much token, this is how you trade tokens and then you can add tokens through it. Another super advantage of that is that when you do multiple token trades, when you do arbitrage, it's actually a lot more gas efficient because first of all, so let's say you have like three or four pools, and you figure out if you exchange token a in that pool, token b in that pool, and token c in that other pool, you get one die arbitrage per arbitrage. If you want to do that in Amm right now, you need to have all those tokens and you need to execute all those buy and sell, you need to buy and sell those tokens constantly in all those pools. So you spend a lot of tokens. If you doing that in balancer V two just means that you're going to send the information of all the trades that you want to do and it's going to just execute on chain the net result right in the end of the transaction, all the tokens that will move is the tokens are the net result. So what could happen is, in fact you could get an arbitration profit without even having any tokens.
00:26:57.614 - 00:28:12.650, Speaker B: How cool is that? You never put any tokens in. You just realize that if you trade with a, with B with c with D, you get per profit out of it. So it's good for gas efficiency and it's also good because it increases liquidity in our pools overall. Another cool thing. Oh, I just figured, I just explained both things at the same time, right? So this is the idea that before we had two sort of pools, and then it allows you to have really any highly customizable logic, any customizable logic, in fact, because the project curve finance is really launched. Interesting, one of the things that they do is that they have a very different curve for stable tokens that you have for normal variable tokens. So if you have a pool of USDC and Dai and teeter, you can have a very different type of curve that you would have with, let's say eater and bitcoin and baker.
00:28:12.650 - 00:29:34.370, Speaker B: And the final thing I think that sort of like blows my mind is capital efficiency. When you put 1000 tokens in the Dow in the vault, right? You probably only a tiny percent of those is going to be used in trading. Most of them are going to just be sitting there on the vault and with new token. With the new v two, we have this concept of an asset manager where you can set a contract, you automatically pull those tokens, add them to a lending protocol, which is, let's say like compound or something like that, and then bring them back as you need it. So it's almost as you have $1,000 there and you realize that you only trade an average $100 per day, or maybe $50 per day. You only need to have like $100 in that actually queue, live in the pool. And as those tokens get traded out, then you bring them out from compound or any lending platform, which is fantastic because now you can keep your pool.
00:29:34.370 - 00:30:35.238, Speaker B: You don't need to choose, oh, I have one die. Should I put it in compound or curve or balance or this or that? You can actually put it in multiple places at the same time. And before you say, oh, that doesn't mean that you don't have the collateral, right? No trade will actually be taken place unless the collateral is actually there and exists. Right. And if I try to make a big trade with a given pool and it doesn't have that, we are not even send that trade to that guy because that transaction will fail. So my bigger point is, Balancer is really for builders. We want to build a project and we are building an app and we are excited about building an app.
00:30:35.238 - 00:31:22.534, Speaker B: But really what we want is to build something that others people can build on top of. It's almost like in this universe of money Legos, we are launching this new little customizable piece that can connect a lot of other things. And it's a very powerful piece. And you can build a lot of new things in this money Lego. And you can learn a lot more about balancer by going to balancer finance or balancer or Twitter at Balancer Labs. And we're hiring. So if you are excited about this, if you're excited about working on the future of money Legos and being a part of this Defi resolution, we are just shoot an email right now.
00:31:22.534 - 00:31:41.840, Speaker B: We are looking for all sorts of positions on UI, on front end, on back end. So if you have any sort of interest in that space, just shoot us an email and we'll be happy to talk. That is the talk. Thank you.
00:31:48.690 - 00:32:07.080, Speaker A: And we're back. Thank you for a great presentation, Alex. That was pretty fast. I think there might be some questions. I think we have at least one question here. I'm going to read it in a moment, but I will wait for the question to show up. Mataw is able to.
00:32:07.080 - 00:32:19.880, Speaker A: It was 30 minutes. So the time was good. Okay, I'll start reading the question. Okay, here comes.
00:32:20.750 - 00:33:01.570, Speaker B: Yes. Will Balancer be available on second layer? We are working on that. We are looking at that. So one interesting thing on that change that I mentioned on balancer, that very cool thing is that we are making our contract, a very basic car contract that you can plug in, plug in a lot of other things. Right. So as soon as we want to move to, anyone can actually create a pool that is just pointing out to a second layer. And we are also looking at roll ups and VK things and all of those technologies that will create this own pool that will connect you to the second layer.
00:33:01.570 - 00:33:20.860, Speaker B: So yes, we are looking at layer two. We haven't seen any solution that we truly believe in and we are sort of like skeptical of solutions that run their own chain. We are very excited about those that are basically rolling up into ethereum chain. So we are waiting for that.
00:33:21.550 - 00:33:56.502, Speaker A: I will just add a couple of words of explanation because not everyone might know what l two is yet. L two are scalability solutions for blockchain that are just emerging right now. There was really nothing working just half a year ago and now there is at least a few. And in a month we're going to have a meeting exactly about layer two solutions. So everything going to be explained and I think it's time for the next question. Let's see if our studio. Okay, very nice.
00:33:56.502 - 00:33:59.030, Speaker A: Buy pr with exposition.
00:34:00.170 - 00:34:10.060, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a vibrazio hashtag. I'm not sure what he's talking about.
00:34:10.430 - 00:34:21.840, Speaker A: Let's see the question first then. Why is people designed to be unusable after any liquidity is no more than there and I can't even be added back.
00:34:23.430 - 00:34:50.380, Speaker B: So I hope that the bug that you found somewhere, if you're having any trouble adding query to a pool or feel free to share to jump into our discord. We have a discord. We have a black and I would love to hear more about. Maybe we can try to figure out what the problem is that you're having. I'm not sure what you're talking about. Sorry.
00:34:50.910 - 00:34:56.966, Speaker A: Yeah, we're going to have networking. Alex, will you have a little bit more time to stay with us on networking session?
00:34:57.158 - 00:34:59.146, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Awesome.
00:34:59.248 - 00:35:35.270, Speaker A: So let's take it there. Let's see if we have more questions. I think we still have time for two or more questions. Okay, I can read one. I'm not sure it's not showing up here. In a classical governed portfolio, you have exposure to different assets and rebalance let's say every half a year, some assets perform better and some worse won't. Too short feedback loop and too frequent getting rid of well performing assets caused too much impermanent loss.
00:35:35.270 - 00:35:48.186, Speaker A: Yeah. So the question is, if we're going to rebalance too often. Yeah. Then impermanent loss. Did we explain what impermanent loss is?
00:35:48.288 - 00:36:41.598, Speaker B: I didn't explain what impermanent loss is. The reason is that I haven't still found a great solution, a great way to explain it. But the short version of this, because of the way that Emms work slowly, as asset prices just diverge, and that doesn't really. Some people call it divergence loss, which I think is interesting, meaning that when prices sort of diverge, the amount of money that the amount of value that you get by holding a token of that pool is a little bit less than just, say, holding that pool. So let's say you have a pool which is 50% eater, 50% die, right. And then you bought it when eater was like $500. Now eater is $1,000.
00:36:41.598 - 00:37:41.550, Speaker B: Right. The amount of money, the value of that pool will not be the same as if you had just kept half eater or half if you had just held one eater on one die back then, right. It's always going to diverge, and usually the way that is usually compensated by trading fee. Right. So the more people are trading, the more basically they get that back. Permanent loss or diverge loss will sort of disappear if the tokens come back to the original price that you bought. The impermanent loss depends on when you bought an asset or what the market conditions were, and they are always better.
00:37:41.550 - 00:38:11.222, Speaker B: And it's usually like there's a trade off. If the pool has enough liquidity of trading, you get that back. So an interesting thing is that it doesn't depend on how often you trade. We don't rebalance pools. Pools are rebalanced every time someone buys one token or buys the other token in our exchange. Then they are rebalancing almost like every pool that they touch. Right.
00:38:11.222 - 00:38:19.900, Speaker B: And in permanent loss, it doesn't depend on how often you rebalance. It just depends on what price you bought a token and what price tokens are right now.
00:38:22.270 - 00:39:09.610, Speaker A: Well, okay, there is one more I just want to add about empowerment loss that it is tricky to understand. It is a little bit tricky to understand, but important part is that if the value of the assets change, so let's say ether is getting more expensive versus dollar, then there is some loss to those who provided liquidity. But if they came back to the same price. The loss is effectively you get the money back. So this is a little bit unintuitive at the beginning. I propose we do one more question, the one that we see here, and then we can go to networking. So, question about scalability and expansion plans.
00:39:09.610 - 00:39:26.020, Speaker A: What are the main challenges and constraints you see to overcome large fins, defis or fintechs? Large fins. And to start talking about small midwealth management companies.
00:39:28.390 - 00:39:55.786, Speaker B: If I understand. It's basically how do we get out of this Defi and human bubble and how do we start tackling on getting actual finance people right. I think there is a lot of that that is about scalability right now. It's just very expensive to do it. There's a lot of it that is about UI. And that's the part where I'm more excited about. That's the part where I'm working directly on it.
00:39:55.786 - 00:40:35.794, Speaker B: So one of the things that attracted me into balancer is that I really dislike their current website and toolings. Right. I see they're great projects, but their current site is a little bit confusing because if you actually go balancer site, you don't actually discover any of those things I've been talking about. It sort of looks just like a unisoft clone, but you get into it, you have to click on add liquidity and then you figure out, oh, there's all those cool things happening here. And then that's sort of where you get into that. I think that's what working. So we are working on just improving the UX.
00:40:35.794 - 00:40:43.260, Speaker B: So that fun as beautiful, let's say using Robinhood, right. And I hope that we get there.
00:40:45.070 - 00:41:06.218, Speaker A: Wonderful. So let's point ourselves to networking. So here is a link. You can see it on the screen. HTP beatly Zeroxnetwork so we're meeting on Remoca platform. I think it's called Remoca. It says Remoca.
00:41:06.218 - 00:41:47.280, Speaker A: Remoca, yeah, Remo co and the platform, you need to go there, you need to connect there. And when you do that, you will need to click on a specific table, and on the table you're going to need to enable your camera and enable your microphone. And then we can talk. I think Bartek is already there and myself and Alex is joining any second now. So yeah, I will stay here for one more minute to make sure you can see the link. And we're also going to post the link on Facebook and on Twitter and maybe on YouTube as well. Let's see if we can actually do that.
00:41:47.280 - 00:41:58.460, Speaker A: So I think Alex is already gone for networking, and I'll be with you there as well in just a second.
