00:00:00.810 - 00:00:01.518, Speaker A: Hi, everyone.
00:00:01.684 - 00:00:05.466, Speaker B: So we'll start with the panel on Defi.
00:00:05.578 - 00:00:08.400, Speaker A: So I'll let you introduce yourself.
00:00:10.610 - 00:00:40.410, Speaker B: Thank you. Can you hear me? Well, I suppose, yes. So welcome again to the discussion panel. The title is Defi uncomplicated and what we are going to talk about is what value does Defi offer to an average user? And what can we do to make this defi even more usable? My name is Barte Grudkowski. I'm going to be your host. And these are my fabulous guests, Alessandro, Johannes and Conor. Welcome them with a round of applause.
00:00:40.910 - 00:00:42.140, Speaker C: Thank you so much.
00:00:44.190 - 00:00:55.790, Speaker B: Okay, so before we get into it, let's start with a round of introductions, guys. Please tell us a little about yourself. What are you doing in the space? What's your background? What makes you an expert?
00:00:57.170 - 00:01:28.914, Speaker A: I think there's no experts in crypto. Right? It's so new in a way. But anyways, I'm Alessandro, founder of Brahma Phi. So what we're working on currently, we're building a custody and execution environment using safe for asset management. So think of like fireblocks, but built with smart contract wallets instead of NPC technology. So things like transaction policies, automation, team accesses to use Defi. And before this we were a prop trading firm in centralized crypto.
00:01:28.914 - 00:01:36.218, Speaker A: So we used to trade on centralized exchanges and then we fully transitioned to working on essentially on chain liquidity. And this is how we got here.
00:01:36.304 - 00:01:37.450, Speaker B: Great direction.
00:01:38.350 - 00:02:04.690, Speaker C: Yeah. Hi, everyone. My name is Johannes. I'm one of the founders of Narif Network. What we're basically doing is we're trying to make web3 suck a bit less. And we do that by building automation. So what you can do with Narif as a developer is building or just automating all those back end processes, be it for D five, be it for what we call the volume driven world, Gamefi, social media and so on.
00:02:04.690 - 00:02:49.540, Speaker C: So you can really focus on what matters for you, which is building your product, building your business logic, and also building a really good user experience and user interface. From a background, why can I talk about DFI as well? Is I spent a couple of years of my career building or helping to set up an asset manager, investment manager in the web3 space. So I know kind of the world from both sides as an investor, as an institutional kind of startup investor, but also as a founder, being very much in the weeds of building and implementing decentralized application and what it means to struggle with the technical limitation blockchain gives us to this day.
00:02:50.790 - 00:02:51.634, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:02:51.832 - 00:03:18.250, Speaker D: I agree. There's no experts in blockchain. So I'm Connor, the founder of Ensofinance. For those who don't know, we are a unified API to interact with all DeFi primitives. So if you want to embed, let's say, lending, farming, borrowing, swapping, whatever it may be, natively within your application, you can just plug in our API to do this. We are a solver for cowswap as well, and we're going to be a solver for many other platforms.
00:03:19.230 - 00:03:53.110, Speaker B: Awesome. So now, as we know our guests a little more, we can start off with a first question. And before we jump into how we can make Defi better, let's start with why. Why do we want to make DeFi better? So let's start with outlining some of the key features that you have in mind that make DeFi compelling to users in comparison with fintech applications or traditional finance applications or products that they offer. Why DeFi makes sense for the users, in your opinion?
00:03:55.210 - 00:04:22.442, Speaker D: It's open, permissionless. You don't have any barriers. Anyone can interact with this ecosystem the way they would like. Nobody can tell you what you can and cannot do. For me, that's kind of the core purpose. To get more people to use DeFi, we need to have better aggregation tools, and we also need to have better user experience. Right now, if you want to interact with, let's say, a beefy vault, very basic defi interaction, you need to go to four different interfaces and do eight different transactions.
00:04:22.442 - 00:04:29.140, Speaker D: So ultimately, if we want more normies to interact with a space, we need to create better user experience.
00:04:31.030 - 00:04:59.574, Speaker C: I would go a step further and kind of differentiate here a bit. Right. We have to be very clear that I'm Swiss and probably in Switzerland, the penetration of having a bank account is 99.9% or something. So most of those tools or DFI primitives, which are relevant for the end user, I mean, you're not leverage trading. I don't necessarily see that as necessary for the average retail user. We have a bank account, I can do payment, I can use this thing called twint.
00:04:59.574 - 00:05:34.194, Speaker C: And so it's on, which doesn't really work properly, but it's there. It's free to make transactions. At the same time, we have probably about two thirds of the world population, which does not have access to this kind of banking system. It doesn't have an account. So we need to make. And that's where Defi is a real big chance, where they can suddenly basically be on the same terms, no matter if you live in Burundi or in Switzerland, right. You can have the same quality of financial services, have that access, and that's where really DeFi can have a huge impact.
00:05:34.194 - 00:06:35.500, Speaker C: But in order to actually leverage that, we need to make it accessible. So we need to have a user experience and a user interface which is easy to use, where, as you very rightly put, so we don't have to use four different interfaces. I can very easily get my harder money on this somehow without. That's where stablecoms come in. Having to fear that I have a 200% analyzed volatility and I don't actually have any idea how much my money is going to be worth tomorrow or if it's going to be rock pulled. Just having more stability in a sense, making it more boring, but just kind of to work very simple, but work and work forever and work very cheaply. And I think the project, a combination of tools which can pull that off and which can penetrate those markets and be on par from a UX perspective with something like a revolute is going to rain the world.
00:06:36.350 - 00:06:53.790, Speaker A: I agree and disagree with some parts, but generally speaking, cross border can only be enabled by crypto, clearly. Otherwise you have to use something like Swift or some really web two standard with people in Excel. But for example, does anybody know what UPI is? UPI in India.
00:06:54.210 - 00:06:54.574, Speaker B: Great.
00:06:54.612 - 00:07:15.078, Speaker A: Okay, that's good. That nobody knows. That's cool. So UPI is like a payment network that the government of India established with all the banks. So all the banks by default have to be integrated. And you can basically have a QR code that you spin up with a phone and Internet connection. And you have 24/7 instant payments, no fees, and you can offload it to any bank account whenever you'll have a bank account.
00:07:15.078 - 00:07:43.454, Speaker A: So like part of my team in India, when I go there, you want to buy a smoothie on the road, literally like a food truck stall with one dollars vegetable cart. They have a UPI code and you will just pay like that. A bit like in China with WeChat. So that is already possible with government rails, but it's only applicable to India. So if Switzerland wants to integrate, to make it cross border, there's no way. I mean, they would have to create a consortium. So this is what crypto can solve, the cross border part of it.
00:07:43.454 - 00:07:58.310, Speaker A: I agree. The actual payment, unbanked infrastructure, country by country, is already solved. Like UPC has 90% penetration in India, meaning 90% of people with a mobile use that. So that's like a lot of people, like almost a billion people.
00:07:58.380 - 00:07:59.574, Speaker C: That's India, right?
00:07:59.692 - 00:08:33.502, Speaker A: India, Russia, also has a similar system, but cross border. I agree. For me it's compatibility. So if I develop an app in fintech, there are like unicorns that were born only to connect banking APIs like plate, because the standards are so old and so bad. And in crypto, anybody could integrate with Enzo and Narif and Brahma at the same time. So we just lack the regulation in a way to allow web two parties to integrate us into their stack. I think like revolut to use Enzo, they wouldn't until there's some sort of regulatory framework that tells them they're not breaking the law.
00:08:33.636 - 00:08:49.174, Speaker C: Good example. So revolut pulled it off. I think it's been live a couple of months now. But you can withdraw. I think it's been free and to any wallet. Yes.
00:08:49.292 - 00:08:49.622, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:49.676 - 00:08:51.574, Speaker C: And the other way around as well.
00:08:51.772 - 00:09:12.394, Speaker A: You saw beam? Beam is like a payment app in crypto, beam echo. So they use Mastercard direct, where whenever you deposit, you receive a deposit to beam in crypto, like Connor sent me. Some if automatically gets off ramped instantly to my bank account or debit card. But this is like, you have to adhere to Mastercard rules and obviously. Right.
00:09:12.512 - 00:09:44.274, Speaker D: So I think there is already a lot of regulation. So I've worked in Cigna bank and I created the cold storage, hot storage. And if those who aren't aware, it's basically a fully licensed and regulated crypto bank. So there is regulations already here in certain jurisdictions, in particular, Switzerland. Now, for these regulated entities to interact with DeFi, since it is a fully permissionless system, is a whole other ballgame. Because then it's seen as mixing, it's seen as money laundering because you cannot identify the counterparty and a banking.
00:09:44.402 - 00:09:59.734, Speaker C: That's why I'm so impressed with revolut, because it's like, even with a big provider like bitcoin, Swiss, you have to, in a sense, make proof of ownership of a wallet to withdraw to. You don't have to do it with revolut. I can literally withdraw to any wallet.
00:09:59.862 - 00:10:04.330, Speaker A: But you can withdraw because you're already KyC. You cannot send money from a crypto wallet to revolut.
00:10:04.770 - 00:10:05.342, Speaker B: You can.
00:10:05.396 - 00:10:06.414, Speaker A: Oh, sorry, we went off track.
00:10:06.452 - 00:10:46.330, Speaker B: Yes, sorry. I'm going to chime in. No, that was very interesting. We went with the flow. But the outcome from this question, what I'm hearing is that Defi makes sense. And even there are some communities around the world that seem like to be in desperate need of DeFi. So regulations were meant already, but what are the pieces of infrastructure or whatever else that are missing or are blocking us from seeing DeFi being the kind of default way to interact financially with each other.
00:10:46.480 - 00:11:12.718, Speaker C: If I would have to mention one thing, I would say on ramps, like cheap on ramps, which are available basically everywhere. Once again, we don't have the problem in Switzerland, but I don't even market that well. But for example, in Latin America, every country has its own on ramp, which is like a 4% fees to get crypto. And it's like super slow. So if you ask me, I would say on ramp.
00:11:12.894 - 00:11:14.178, Speaker B: On ramp. Okay.
00:11:14.264 - 00:11:15.858, Speaker C: Not sure. What do you guys think?
00:11:15.944 - 00:11:56.382, Speaker A: Yeah, I think on ramp and ease of use for wallets. So like pasky wallets, if you tried one recently, like Alembic did a demo that is really cool. I saw it at FCC. So it's demo alembic tech. And you can basically from your device, you just use your face id or know fingerprint scanner on your Mac and that establishes a wallet and instantly can do a transaction without any gas, any private key storage, because it's on device. So we also like my team hacked something at DFCC for generating a safe, creating a safe from fingerprint, and then doing a swap on one inch. So this kind of instant on ramp without friction for a private key.
00:11:56.382 - 00:12:27.180, Speaker A: People don't want to store private keys. I mean, I tried literally with friends like, oh, set up a wallet, set up a ledger, and people are just like, oh, I'm going to lose it. And then they end up using maybe argent and rainbow, which is already good, right. Social recovery and some level of abstraction. So I think abstraction and then on ramp is like what I mentioned would be more holy held. Like these payment apps with cards that make it really easy to get into and out of crypto. Mostly out of crypto is the problem usually into is.
00:12:28.110 - 00:12:52.130, Speaker D: I agree with all the points. I would just abstract all of defi away. People don't even need to know that there's blockchain underneath. They just need to know what the benefit is. So if I can put my funds here and I can generate this rewards or I can even borrow funds, whereas before I would need to go to a bank and so forth. So just subtract all of this away and just make it extremely simple for people to get part of this ecosystem.
00:12:53.190 - 00:13:29.422, Speaker B: Awesome. So I see two main points. One is on ramping. On ramping seems to be like a very complicated thing and very closely related to the regulatory environment. And that's probably kind of slow and not only in the hands of builders, but user friendliness, I guess. Is something that we could work on. So I wanted to ask you, what are in your opinion, the most promising developments that will make the interfaces more user friendly? And I will here ask especially about the things that account obstruction might enable that.
00:13:29.422 - 00:13:42.420, Speaker B: You already touched base on that, but I'm wondering if this is going to allow some sort of a breakthrough or is this just like a small step forward? One of many, and we'll need many more. What do you think?
00:13:45.530 - 00:14:31.362, Speaker C: I mean, I have to plug narrative here, obviously, right? No, it is a part. I would say it's more an evolution than a revolution. It's a very much needed spot to kind of make programmable wallets, if you will, right. Which enables stuff you just mentioned, social recovery and so on. I don't think accounting abstraction for the mass user adoption, I mean, the same with narrative, like automation. Also not. It's not a silver bullet, it has to be a package which is in total so compelling that it basically gets that growth flywheel going.
00:14:31.362 - 00:15:03.206, Speaker C: So it's definitely an important part for me. I think it's very exciting to be able to very easily use something like safe and kind of the surrounding toolings. But that is once again, we have to be careful that we're not getting too excited about technical stuff, because we're building it. Because for the end user that is completely relevant, as you said, very rightly. In the end it has to be a seamless experience. And the user doesn't even has to know that there is like blockchain underneath. So account abstraction doesn't say anything to the end user.
00:15:03.206 - 00:15:08.670, Speaker C: That's something we're excited about, which is an important part. But as I said, I don't think it's a silver bullet.
00:15:10.850 - 00:15:52.498, Speaker D: I personally, smart accounts quite a lot just use safe, don't build your own smart contract wallet. It creates a lot more fragmentation in the ecosystem. Just stick to that and then start plugging all these different tools on top. For me, personally, I think account abstraction is nice to have things standardized. I think it's been overhyped quite a lot. In particular, smart accounts already existed. Bundlers and relayers, also known as openzeppelin GSN, which has been around for six years, then kind of multicol of bundling transactions together also has its limitations, right? You can't use the output of the first queue transaction into the next one and so forth.
00:15:52.498 - 00:16:28.040, Speaker D: So there are some limitations. So generally on the technological side, I would say smart accounts for sure to abstract this private key infrastructure and so forth away, and then having very seamless user experience on top and also relaying and paying transactions on other people's behalf. So I think kind of this as a foundational layer. And then what are the use cases that go on top? So this is kind of the base layer of what we can start providing value to people. If you want to borrow or you want to avoid a bank account and so forth, you use this first. And I think the second part we haven't truly figured out just yet.
00:16:29.050 - 00:17:09.334, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, everything makes sense, I think. Definitely. Smart contract wallets, right? We're all building on smart contract wallets in a way. Like, we chose smart contract wallets versus an EOA in an NPC because of the benefits. Multicol gas abstraction. Most importantly, I think people that use any financial app, they have limits and policies that they can set easily, right? Like Max amount that can go out of my wallet at any point in time, even if my account is fished somehow or I'm Sim swapped. And the other thing is, this is anecdotal, but when I talk to Normie friends and I ask them if they use Google off or like a two fa app, like offi, they're like, what is it? And I'm like, bro, it's like 2023.
00:17:09.334 - 00:17:46.226, Speaker A: Yeah. A lot of people still use smsotps unless they are pushed and obliged to change. So we need the lowest friction for gas is horrible. Like web two, people don't understand gas. And why would they, right? It's a fluctuating price currency that they have to send to a chain before they can do something there. So I think you have to obstruct away gas, which is possible with relayers already. And you need to allow people to set policies on their smart contract wallets in a super easy way, like when you onboard onto revolute and you actually can set some limits and some specific assets you're going to trade or protocols that you trust.
00:17:46.226 - 00:17:56.290, Speaker A: And that is in a total web two ux style. And behind there's a standardized transaction that gets triggered to impose a guard on your wallet.
00:17:56.710 - 00:18:41.326, Speaker B: Makes sense. I think the kind of revolt direction is very natural and mentioned quite often in the space, though I have a question. How far can it go? I mean, right, we have the private keys sort of protected by the social recovery, by maybe we can set a password, different set of policies, maybe at the end of the day, we'll end up not having the private key at all. Is this something that you think is one of the ways that will attract more people? Or does it go against the values of the web free? Like, not your keys, not your coins. Is it really the song of today, or do we need to prepare that some users just don't want their keys and want only the password.
00:18:41.518 - 00:19:08.314, Speaker D: I mean, you need to give them what they want. You can have your fundamental beliefs in life, and you can stick to it and continue on that way. Or we can be realistic and say some people in this room, like that, some people don't. And Normie, users don't want to care about the private key. And if we want more people to get in this industry, we need to give them what they need to take away our, let's say, philosophical beliefs to a certain regard. And if somebody in this room is not going to do that, somebody else is going to do it. Right.
00:19:08.314 - 00:19:11.550, Speaker D: And it will just propel this ecosystem even further.
00:19:11.890 - 00:19:58.362, Speaker C: I mean, there's a reason why there is banks. Banks, historically speaking, obviously now they're different business, historically speaking, a place where you could store your values. Technically, there will always be a private key. And the question is now, okay, who is holding that private key? Who is holding a baby? And this is a long standing discussion I've had. I personally believe here that banks will actually develop towards that, that they are regulated, transparent, trustworthy, because there's the legal framework, there's a social frame, which in the end of makeup nation states, who will hold those private keys for you, where you go away from this. Right now we have centralized exchanges, which are shady at best. Right.
00:19:58.362 - 00:20:40.620, Speaker C: You don't really know what is actually happening. The difference will be, right now I have to use banks if I want to access the financial system in the future. I can choose to use them, but I also have the ability to do it myself if I choose to do so. So that's where I see that going. And then that one basically answers the question of, will I have a private key? Not necessarily. And I have a system in place which is legally protected, which is in a society, like, adopted and kind of part of that whole societal control, if you will, which does that for me.
00:20:41.070 - 00:20:50.070, Speaker D: If I can add on to this, this is already happening in Switzerland. They've got, like, sub custody. So all these hsms, they're then licensing.
00:20:50.230 - 00:20:52.138, Speaker C: Technically, yes. Technically, yes.
00:20:52.224 - 00:20:55.150, Speaker D: But is it been used effectively? So far, no.
00:20:55.300 - 00:21:10.658, Speaker C: And then maybe just for people who don't know that how this is being done in Switzerland, I'm saying technically, yes, because, yes, technically there is hsms, and they are basically holding your keys, but they are restricting you from doing whatever you want with your keys. You can only know get your. Well, a certain.
00:21:10.824 - 00:21:12.482, Speaker D: They're going to start changing that.
00:21:12.616 - 00:21:13.378, Speaker C: I hope so.
00:21:13.464 - 00:21:24.040, Speaker D: Yeah. They're going to have, like, sub custody accounts, and then that will go to different companies, then they manage that KYC, and then it shifts some liability away and then normies can then start plugging into that as well.
00:21:24.490 - 00:22:05.394, Speaker A: Depends a lot what kind of user you are, like Connor said. But also, if we're talking as a Defi panel and you want to do defi, your main vector of attack, like getting attacked is not the private key is usually what you sign. So I think there's a lot more work to be done on that regard, like understanding what you're signing. Why intense. Like Rabi and some other companies are doing really well. Private key storage is like, there are people that have gold under their mattress and there are people that actually store gold at banks historically, like Johannes was saying. So if you want the security in a way of a trusted, regulated party, and if somebody comes at your home, you really have no access to the gold unless they bring you there with a gun, then you go for a storage solution, right.
00:22:05.394 - 00:22:22.460, Speaker A: For any goods, like whatever your good is. And bitcoin, Wixapo in the Switzerland in whatever, 20, 15, 16 was the main proposition. They were basically like a mountain storage with like vaults. That was how Sapo and the whole custody ecosystem started.
00:22:23.310 - 00:22:54.626, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it sounds like maybe there is a way to eat the cookie and have the cookie, because on one hand we want the security, but on the other we want the seamless experience. And before one of you mentioned the SMS verification with banks, maybe there is something that we can do like that here that will still make you hold your keys, but do something that's better than nothing. It's better than not holding your keys, but far easier. Do you think that there is something like that?
00:22:54.648 - 00:22:59.766, Speaker C: Multisix? You can have a save multisig and give one of the keys to your.
00:22:59.788 - 00:23:26.026, Speaker A: Bank, but also pass keys is exactly that in a way like just storing your private key in your device or even in a backup. Like, look at how rainbow has like icloud backup. I don't know how many users use it, but you can choose. And then in a multistig you need a smart contra wallet. Then you can set policies and you can say anything above this amount. Like in a bank, they would call you and verify with you. Are you getting scammed? And they do it for the stupidest reasons.
00:23:26.026 - 00:24:08.314, Speaker A: I sent a $2,000 transfer to Amsterdam. Like not to buy anything illicit. It was to pay an event at FCC that maven organized and they called me up and I said, it's €2000 at Sepa transfer. And they're like, oh, it's a random check. So with a Multisig, you can set a second, a third hot or, like, cold key with somebody else as well, that you trust and say only above a certain transaction value. I need a third signature, I need a fourth. And you store your primary key in your device, but nothing can happen if you put a time block, I mean, nothing horrible can happen, like, compared to a normal wallet and just signing something with infinite approval and getting drained in one block, that cannot happen.
00:24:08.512 - 00:25:12.710, Speaker D: I think it really depends on the person's choice, which we're all saying, right? One thing of, let's say, storing your private key, I'm sure most of everyone's aware Lastpass got hacked, and many wallets where people were storing their private keys in Lastpass, and Lastpass haven't even said that they got exploited, but its tailor has already proven that it was lastpass and so forth. So giving people the choice is fundamental. If somebody wants to go and drink ten beers at this time of day, they can do that. You don't take the choice away. So giving them the choice of having a smart account or doing an eoa, maybe having these different recovery methods, or using a normalized custodians. A lot of foundations don't do self custody, and I don't think many people talk about this, but the larger foundations store their money at crypto regulated banks because they don't want all of this overhead of managing all of their keys. They segregate their custody into, let's say, hot wallets, which might be multi sigs or even eoas.
00:25:12.710 - 00:25:22.770, Speaker D: And then the larger funds they're all depositing into these crypto banks inside of Switzerland. So just giving people the choices is fundamentally what will improve the ecosystem.
00:25:24.870 - 00:26:09.294, Speaker B: Awesome. So, kind of one thing that comes to my mind, like, at hog, do you think that there is going to be someone, or actors, kind of like tech support of blockchain? I mean, in a sense, because with all these institutions, there is someone to call and ask, hey, my. Whatever disappeared, my balance changed. Y. There's someone to call that, hey, there's the big transaction going out of your wallet. I mean, some of these things can be automated, but at the end of the day, probably there needs to be a human input. Do you think that the community can develop or help grow actors that will guide very non technical users into DeFi or.
00:26:09.492 - 00:26:11.186, Speaker C: Yeah, I hope so.
00:26:11.288 - 00:26:38.140, Speaker D: And what generation do you want to target for that one because I think duck support, right. I think each generation is very different. I think all of our generations are younger and so forth. They're very self able to do stuff. They will figure out themselves, they will try to understand, they will try to learn. The older generation maybe not so much, and they need this. And the question is, should we shift our resources and time to accommodate to that generation or not?
00:26:38.910 - 00:27:36.286, Speaker A: But I think support and education are two different things, right? You kind of club them together. So support, it's the provider that you interact with which gives you support, right? Like if something happens on the RPC level or on the EVM level, like a compiler issue, whatever we've seen, you will still talk to the UniSoP support at one point. You will not talk to the Viper team or whoever else, for example. And when it comes to actual education, yes, you probably need the furon foundation to actually do education towards normies or make an education dial where we all contribute a little bit and we start explaining the benefit. But so far the value is all over the place. You have to first have a value that you want to align and convey. Like again, UPI example, they conveyed that wherever you are with an Internet access, you can receive and pay money 24/7 crypto does exactly that, but we just didn't compile it into a solution that people can really use, like out of the box, no matter where they are.
00:27:36.468 - 00:28:08.120, Speaker D: I think just add on to this. So I think a lot of crypto companies already with their discord have service support. So it's kind of already there. But you need to understand that you need to go to the discord first to then get that support. So maybe we need to go to the steps above there. But I think a lot of people are doing education. For me personally, I think particular companies that try and create all of this educational pieces are actually losing focus of their core product and they're turning into an educational platform.
00:28:08.120 - 00:28:14.746, Speaker D: Maybe, like you said, if we go into an educational dow, then we can all contribute, but it allows us to self focus on our.
00:28:14.848 - 00:28:15.306, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:28:15.328 - 00:28:19.260, Speaker A: Just like basic education. I agree. Until we're ready with the value of.
00:28:19.950 - 00:28:22.640, Speaker D: But there is, you just Google. That's the thing.
00:28:23.250 - 00:28:49.654, Speaker C: Keep in mind here we're once again talking about individual product. I can go to discord of Uniswap. However, if we're talking about mass adoption, people will not use uniswap. People will use some kind of user interface which will have great customer support. Exactly. So once again here, I would say this is going to be a part of this packages business model, right, where it actually already is moving away.
00:28:49.692 - 00:28:49.846, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:49.868 - 00:29:21.520, Speaker C: The banks were free for everyone because they made so much money with our money, right. Because of the interest rate differences and the money they were lending out. And this will move back into kind of a service type, which you see with rolode right now, where you have kind of, all transactions are free. The foreign exchange is very free, but you pay a monthly service fee basically for that. And in that service fee, you have support included. So that's where I see it going, where you have this unbundling, where in a sense it becomes. And there's even a legal aspect to that.
00:29:21.520 - 00:29:52.298, Speaker C: I'm not a lawyer, maybe I'm telling a half truth now, but I think it's in Mika two. Sorry, Mifid two, in the european regulation, where banks now have to basically separately charge for the research they do. So even on the legal side, this is kind of going towards that, where you have this unbundling. And it becomes very clear to an end client, what is he paying for and where does the money come from and where is the money being made?
00:29:52.464 - 00:30:24.740, Speaker B: Guys, as we are arriving at the end of our time together, just one final question, and let's make it prompt. What are just single one, what is the single most thing that comes to your mind when you think about what will make defi better? What's the single most exciting thing in defi that will make it better? Tough one.
00:30:30.870 - 00:30:58.986, Speaker A: I think it. What time frame? Just anything you can pick any time frame. So I think that now, if you ask me, a year back, it was the start of l two chains. And this kind of development of ramification of how many chains are going to be there. Now with the op stack and base and so many, we're seeing that this is definitely a flourishing business model. Right? Like sequencer l two s. And now we're splitting liquidity into smaller and smaller blocks.
00:30:58.986 - 00:31:27.880, Speaker A: So for DFI to be efficient, you need liquidity. For DeFi to really be able to onboard even like five X. The customers we have now, which is not a lot, and actively trade and efficiently earn, yield, whatever, without slippage, you need liquidity. So I'm excited for anybody who's bringing back some sanity to performing transaction in an efficient way, across chains without a lot of the friction. But wallets play a lot into that, which is not d five.
00:31:28.810 - 00:31:29.560, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:31:30.810 - 00:31:35.490, Speaker C: It's a really hard question. I said that before. I don't think it's one thing, it's.
00:31:35.650 - 00:31:37.190, Speaker A: Just the one you're most excited about.
00:31:37.260 - 00:31:41.390, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like this success, but many cuts, you know what I mean?
00:31:41.580 - 00:31:44.254, Speaker A: Where, which cut do you choose?
00:31:44.372 - 00:31:53.638, Speaker C: Yeah, honestly, it's tough. It's very tough.
00:31:53.754 - 00:32:06.050, Speaker D: I'll let you go first try maybe some controversy. Stop doing ponzies. Stop doing token incentivizations. Build real defi products. Lending and borrowing is useful.
00:32:06.650 - 00:32:07.560, Speaker C: Oh yeah.
00:32:08.490 - 00:32:14.806, Speaker D: So stop the token incentivization bullshit. It doesn't help anyone. It doesn't create good products.
00:32:14.908 - 00:32:18.134, Speaker A: But that's what people currently users want. Like perps are.
00:32:18.252 - 00:32:19.826, Speaker C: No, wait, who are the users?
00:32:19.858 - 00:32:21.158, Speaker D: Perps is a useful product.
00:32:21.244 - 00:32:28.166, Speaker A: I know, but perps have been incentivized for liquidity to go on purpose. It's not like they just put some perp contracts and the volume came. There was incentives everywhere.
00:32:28.198 - 00:32:36.240, Speaker D: Yeah, but how many people, let's say you use revolut, let's say you use any application. Did you sign up for that because you would get free money given to you? No, you sign up, you do.
00:32:37.810 - 00:32:40.126, Speaker A: You use Uber eats because you get coupons, right?
00:32:40.148 - 00:32:42.942, Speaker D: Okay, well, maybe I fucked up there, guys, so maybe we need to wrap up.
00:32:42.996 - 00:32:51.680, Speaker B: Let's end with a sentence that everyone started using revolut because of its functionality, not the rewards. And let's have defi the same way. Thank you very much.
00:32:52.210 - 00:33:07.686, Speaker C: I have one more thing to say though. I have a bit of Alpha to share there. We have a really cool side event tonight. I have a handful of Scots to give away, tacos to give away. So if you want tacos, well, find me.
00:33:07.868 - 00:33:10.210, Speaker B: Yes, you can reach out to us after the panel.
