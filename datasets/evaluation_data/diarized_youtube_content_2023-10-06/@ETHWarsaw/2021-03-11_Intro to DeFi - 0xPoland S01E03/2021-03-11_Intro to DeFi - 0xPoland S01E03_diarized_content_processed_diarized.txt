00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:02.450 - 00:00:32.230, Speaker B: So, yeah, let's wait just a minute or so. And we'll be starting today. We have a lineup of great speakers. We're going to have two speakers, we're going to have a guest speaker. There are plenty of announcements that we're going to do today as well. So I think it's going to be extremely, well, an extremely good meeting today. So really looking forward to it.
00:00:32.230 - 00:01:08.580, Speaker B: And yeah, there are some announcements that we're going to make. I would like also to take that half a minute or so to tell you all that it's been a great journey so far and the amount of people is overwhelming. Who joined Zero X Poland. We more than double the amount of people from the first to the second meetup. We more than double the amount of people who joined us. So it's really great. And yeah, I think without further ado, we're going to start.
00:01:08.580 - 00:01:48.522, Speaker B: So let me tell you, I'm Marek from efworks. We are organizing it together with Maker. And let me remind you why we're doing it. We want to build a lasting developer blockchain community here in Poland, but open to really anyone in the world. And we have a great media partners. Crypto dev tv is resumed bitcoina, who help us promote and who help in our mission to build a lasting community of developers of blockchain developers. And it's going to be our third meeting today, third meetup that we organized.
00:01:48.522 - 00:02:26.506, Speaker B: We also had a workshop last month, a weekend workshop. And I'm going to tell you a little bit more about it in a moment. And we're going to have five more meetings this season, including today. We're going to have student workshops and we're going to have more weekend workshops and we're going to have a hackathon. So I want to tell you that last workshop there was a great amount of demand and thanks to maker, we were able to do two groups instead of one. So there were two groups, each was ten people. Everyone showed up.
00:02:26.506 - 00:03:03.190, Speaker B: So that's really great. And we are only able to invite half of the people who sign up. So therefore we would like to announce that in top of student workshops that we start in just a few weeks and another workshops in May. We're going to do additional workshops in April. That's going to be led by the Merker team, so that anyone who would like to can join and start learning blockchain development. We also announced earlier that we're going to do a hackathon in May. The days for the hackathon has changed.
00:03:03.190 - 00:03:48.600, Speaker B: It's going to be similar time, but a little bit different because it's going to be remote first. So it's going to be fully remote. Hackathon that's going to start on Friday, 21 May, and we're going to finish on May the 29th. And I'm happy to tell you that we're going to have some great partners, some great sponsors. We already secured $25,000 for prizes and I think it's going to be much more than that because we just started working with our partners and sponsors to build this price pool. So we're going to have a great speakers, we're going to have great workshops, and we're going to have great price pool. So I would like to invite you all.
00:03:48.600 - 00:04:39.266, Speaker B: Follow us on our social media, follow us on Twitter on zeroxpoland. But also we just opened Discord, so please join us on Discord. And you can expect announcement of specific partners and prizes and speakers in upcoming weeks. And today we're going to have two presentations. There's going to be introduction to defi by Bartek Rutkowski from iTworks, who's going to explain what the whole decentralized finance bus is all about. And then we have a great guest speaker from Balancer, Alex Vandersande, who's going to explain in particular what is the state of automated market making and why we should already go beyond that. So really great lineup.
00:04:39.266 - 00:04:53.130, Speaker B: And without further ado, I will let Bartek start his. Yeah, I think we're ready. Bardek, are you joining? Wonderful. Hi, Bardek.
00:04:53.710 - 00:05:06.286, Speaker A: Hey. Yes. Great to be here. Yeah. So I think I'll take it from here. So, introduction to DFI. Today we're going to talk about what this whole d five thing is all about.
00:05:06.286 - 00:05:53.558, Speaker A: We've heard on the previous meetup something about ERC 20 token standard. We've heard on the previous event something about coding debt. Now it's time to put all these pieces together and compose a bigger picture that will be actually useful and that will be actually bringing real value to this world so we can utilize it and see why is it so important. So, before I continue, I just want to mention that I'm not a financial advisor. Nothing what I say should be treated as such. And I know my excitement might sound like a financial advice, but it's not one. So it's only my private opinion about everything.
00:05:53.558 - 00:06:58.002, Speaker A: Okay. So what is DeFi? DeFi stands for decentralized finance. And this is whole ecosystem of different sorts of projects that utilize smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain, not necessarily on Ethereum DeFi refers to all of the projects that deliver financial products across different blockchains. But it's mostly ethereum these days as Ethereum holds the majority of utilized liquidity and the most devs create stuff on Ethereum blockchain. And as we can see there is this aggregator of data which is called DeFi pulse. And that's screenshot that I've made for a similar presentation that I was doing around two years ago. So two years ago there were like some projects with some amount of USD locked inside.
00:06:58.002 - 00:07:48.850, Speaker A: The total value locked in the DeFi was half a billion dollar and maker was like a solid leader. And that was actually the only project that was kind of on the scene. And today that's actually the screenshot taken. Today we have 37 billion of dollars locked in different DeFi projects. And maker, which still holds the strongest position on the market, is not a killer, it's not a tyrant that holds everything. So it's growing rapidly. The tempo of growth is outrageous and the ecosystem is really flourishing.
00:07:48.850 - 00:08:14.902, Speaker A: Yeah. So what is this DeFi thing actually doing? We say decentralized finance. So we imagine some financial stuff. So let's start with the simplest example possible. Let's imagine simple banking. What is banking all about? We have our hard earned money and we put it in a bank. We put it in a bank because we want it secured.
00:08:14.902 - 00:09:23.458, Speaker A: And sometime ago we even used to pay for that, right? Because banks provide security. Banks, banks can make sure that we won't lose our money. And we were paying for that sometime passed and banks realized that it's nice to actually use this money inside because it can be lend, it can be utilized in some way, that it brings profit. So we won't need to pay to the banks anymore because the bank can make use of our money, so it can profit. And actually it also brings profit to us, right? Because we deposit money into the bank and we receive some small portion of gains created with the capital that we have put in our bank. Sounds like a simple example, sounds like a simple truth, that we put something in the bank and we get a little bit of profit. So I think it should be possible to do it with smart contracts on a blockchain using primitives that we discussed in previous months.
00:09:23.458 - 00:10:11.150, Speaker A: So let's explore compound first of all. First of all, we have some portion of Dai. Dai is an ERC 20 token token, like one of these we discussed a month ago. And one unit of Dai is always worth one dollars, around one dollars. And let's imagine that compound is this sort of a smart contract bank. And we put these dies into the compound. We put them into there, we deposit our cash into the bank and we get some virtual number, which is in this case another ERC 20 token, which just says this guy deposited this amount of money into the compound.
00:10:11.150 - 00:11:07.406, Speaker A: It represents our share in the whole pool of funds in the compound and how this money, this token in the pool, can bring any profit. On the other end, we have a guy that wants to borrow it, so he puts collateral. And because the value of the collateral is greater than the amount of the funds that we want to borrow, he is able to borrow the funds from the pool. We need to do that because we need to make sure that he pays it back. Because his collateral is more valuable than the dice he took. So he's incentivized to actually pay it back after some amount of time. Oh, actually before that, I think it would be nice to make a comparison to the traditional finance, because imagine a mortgage, right? The collateral might be considered, for example, a piece of real estate.
00:11:07.406 - 00:11:57.506, Speaker A: In normal case, you put the ownership of a piece of real estate, like you pass it to the bank. So the bank can hold the real estate actually, so you can borrow funds needed to complete the purchase. And then after some time, you pay back money and you truly become an owner of the real estate. And similarly here you put ether, for example, some sort of collateral into the compound. You borrow die, and after some amount of time you pay the die back or your collateral is taken from you if you are not willing to pay your debt back. And that generates profit. And that generates profit because that's of course, not for free.
00:11:57.506 - 00:13:10.294, Speaker A: And then the girl on the left side, who was first to deposit her funds, her hard earned dies into the compound, can withdraw with a profit. Most of the profit goes to hair. And some small portion of these funds is left in the compound pool, as compound is indeed not a charity. And this model works extremely well. It's extremely simple and works well. And now there's something I missed, because actually the guy that put the collateral into the compound also receives some token that represents his funds located in the pool, right? Because he also had to locate something into the pool and then he should be able to withdraw it. So now we have an interesting case, because now we see that not only the DAI depositor can borrow ether, not only depositor can borrow Dai, but also depositor can borrow ether.
00:13:10.294 - 00:13:58.966, Speaker A: So both of the sites can deposit something, earn some yield on top of that, and borrow other funds that are located in the pool. And now how does it happen that these funds are not blocked forever. Right? Because we have now the girl on the left who might intend to withdraw her die, and they are not there. Right. So how does she do that? And on the other hand, there is a guy on the right side which might want to withdraw some amount of ether, but it might not be possible because this amount of ether is not present in the pool. So now we have this thing called utilization ratio. And utilization ratio says how valuable an asset in the pool is.
00:13:58.966 - 00:14:43.874, Speaker A: So, as we see, most of the dyes located in the pool, located in the pool are already utilized. So somebody borrowed them. They are not there. And that indicates the high cost of such loan. Right? So high cost of such loan, on one hand, incentivizes more dai depositors to deposit into the pool so they can earn high yield. And on the other, it incentivizes borrowers to pay their loan back because it's just expensive. And we see, similarly with ETH, only small portion of ETH is borrowed, so it's not needed that much anymore.
00:14:43.874 - 00:15:24.890, Speaker A: And we do not incentivize more people to put their ETH into the pool. But on the other hand, borrowing this ETH is not that. It's not that expensive. So anyone can do that. Yeah. And as we now consider these two sides of the compound system, which is pool and collateral, we can actually see that it should be only one thing. Only pool people deposit stuff, whatever it is, they gain borrowing power because they can borrow against their deposit, against their collateral, and they earn yield on top of stuff that they deposited.
00:15:24.890 - 00:16:14.530, Speaker A: Simple and extremely powerful. Actually, I can tell you even more, and that will be only a teaser, because I don't want to dive too deep into this one. But it's possible, actually, to borrow something from the pool without any collateral, but only in such a case, if you do this for a very short period of time. And this period of time is only one transaction. So you need to borrow and pay back a loan in the same transaction. You need a special smart contract for that. And this is extremely useful tool that we cannot see in the traditional banking system, at least not available for retail, for retail users.
00:16:14.530 - 00:17:13.042, Speaker A: And I think that we will explore it sometime later. But, yeah, it's also possible. Synth. So we were talking about this compound example about different sorts of tokens, right? The ERC 20 tokens. And there was this die. I was saying that one die is worth one dollars, but actually, why is die worth one dollars? And actually, why anyone accepts die when anyone can deploy any ERC 20 token, and it's like just a piece of code. So what is actually die at the beginning? Let's synthetic asset like in depth what's essentially a synthetic asset.
00:17:13.042 - 00:18:06.786, Speaker A: So we are going to start with the simplest possible example, which is wrapped ether. Wrapped ether is an asset that solves the one very painful problem of smart contracts. We have an ERC 20 standard. All of the projects utilize ERC 20 tokens. We have dozens, hundreds of different ERC 20 tokens, while we have ETH, which has completely different interface. So whenever you create a system, like for example, compound which utilizes both tokens and ETH, you can implement it for a near c 20 token, which utilizes 99% of the whole market. And then this one edge case for ETH, which is not a near C 20 token.
00:18:06.786 - 00:19:01.802, Speaker A: So how to fix that? So apparently the easiest solution is to just wrap an eth in a token, right? So you can put your eth into the vault. And this vault, whenever you deposit into this vault, will give you exactly the same amount of wrapped eth. This is like extremely simple, right? This is basically the code that's responsible for the logic of depositing and withdrawing. Whenever you deposit stuff, you pay some amount of ether, you receive proper amount of wrapped ether. And the other way around whether you want to withdraw, you just create a transaction that will pull your tokens from your account back to the vault, burn these tokens, and return your eth. As simple as that. And we have a lot of sims like that.
00:19:01.802 - 00:19:55.370, Speaker A: This one is the purest. But this is kind of a synth that we can call custodial synth. This is a synth. There is like one issuer of the token, one issuer of the currency. And this issuer guarantees that anytime you pass them your asset, whether it's bitcoin, whether it's US dollar, they are going to mint you proper amount of token representing deposit. So you can take one bitcoin, pass it to the wrapped bitcoin issuer, and you will get wrapped bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. You can deposit us dollar in a special account, and then you will receive USDC or TUSD on Ethereum blockchain.
00:19:55.370 - 00:20:39.930, Speaker A: But still, it's not die. What is it then? So far we are discussing only tokens which are hard pegged. Hard pegged means that they are hard pegged to their origins. So they can only always one wrapped bitcoin to one USD and especially one if to one wrap if and the other way around. Because that's very simple. Smart contract transaction. Dai doesn't look like that.
00:20:39.930 - 00:21:25.830, Speaker A: So how does it work? Dai is a token which was introduced by the Maker foundation, which was like the first great DeFi project. And the idea is like this. You put your eth into a special vault. This special vault evaluates how much eth you put in there. Like in dollar value terms, right? So, not like it's one ether. It's like there is an ether worth of $200, whatever, and then you can create an amount of die that is always lower than the amount of inside the vault. So die is like kind of.
00:21:25.830 - 00:22:03.330, Speaker A: Let's say for now, it's like ether backed stablecoin, right? So it's a token, it's a currency that's backed by the value kept inside the vaults in different sort of currencies. Like, for example, ether. Like, we had the gold standard, right? So some time ago, like, each Us dollar or whatever else was backed by some amount of gold put in the special vault which was banked. And now we have this. It's not the same. It's not the same. I know it works slightly different, but there are similarities.
00:22:03.330 - 00:22:56.466, Speaker A: And after you create these eyes, you can do anything with them. Like, literally anything. You can sell them, you can exchange them, you can keep them, you can do whatever you want. And then you need to pay them back with a small fee. This fee cannot be paid in die, of course, because how can you get more die than you meant it, right? Of course you can buy these dies from somebody else, but then he won't be able to repay his debt, et Cetera. So you need to pay the debt, you need to pay it back with adding some fee, which is expressed in the MKR token. And what happens if your debt is too large? Like larger than the value of the vault? That probably won't incentivize you to ever pay it back.
00:22:56.466 - 00:23:36.494, Speaker A: Or worse, what happens if the value of ETh drops down? And now it doesn't actually cover the synthetic debt that you issued, so it's no longer backing these synthetically created dies. There is a mechanism for that, of course. It's called collateralization ratio. And this is like a kind of red line. It's simplified here. It's simplified, but I think it explains the rule. It's a line that's drawn between the value of ETH and between the amount of die.
00:23:36.494 - 00:24:28.690, Speaker A: And whenever the value of eth drops down, so these values are met, the system says, okay, whatever, take your dice. We don't want to see them anymore. It's your problem now. We take out your ETH, we'll sell it on the open free market, we will buy die from someone else and we will repay your debt. And basically your vault is closed, your debt is neutralized because we will repay dice from anyone else on the market. You will still manage to keep some small portion of if that was left for you. But generally your position is liquidated because system needs to be sure that all the dies are backed by ether.
00:24:28.690 - 00:25:21.906, Speaker A: The other way around, if your debt raises so high that this ratio is met, the same will happen. The vault will be liquidated, the ether will be taken out, will be sold, and you will just get the rest. And you can keep your die and you don't need to repay the MKR debt anymore. But what happens if the situation is so rapid that within minutes or within one block period of time or whatever, really quickly, the value of if drops so badly that the system is not able to react? Right? It happens. It actually happens one time. I'm not sure if it was only once, but once for sure. March 2020.
00:25:21.906 - 00:26:11.458, Speaker A: And in such a case, the maker system will print new MKR tokens to cover your debt. And that worked. So you can be sure that every Die is always backed by ether. This is one of its trends. There are more, but yeah. So, to summarize, make sure that your dyes are always covered with proper amount of ETH and the vault is safe. And actually, what's interesting, this can be done with other types of collateral as well.
00:26:11.458 - 00:27:13.400, Speaker A: So you can, for example, put your bitcoin into the vault and then borrow against it. So you don't need to actually sell it to use its value, right. You don't need anymore to necessarily sell the currency cryptocurrency, but you can lock it, borrow some dies against it, and then just repay them, use them in a way that you would like to use them. And in the future, that's not true at this point. This is like future, probably. Maybe at some point you will be able actually, for example, to get a mortgage on blockchain, right? Because you would need to lock a tokenized real estate into the vault, and then you'd be able to issue some amount of die that will be able to help you complete the purchase, for example. That's future, I guess.
00:27:13.400 - 00:28:34.402, Speaker A: So what can it be used for, this whole thing? Because now I showed you two simple premises, which is, one is pooling stuff, putting stuff into one pool, and then borrowing, and then paying interest, and now issuing a synthetic asset, which is backed by some other asset, because it sounds like it's very, like, what can it be actually used for? Right? So let's take an example. You can create a leveraged token. So, for example, can put ether into the vault, mint some dice, then sell the dice for more ether, put this ether into another vault or into the same one, whatever you prefer. Then you can mint more dice, buy more eth, et cetera. Like create this leverage position, and then at the end of the day, when you have, at the very beginning, you had $200 of worth of ETH, but then when the price changes, you get more. Of course. Of course it's dangerous, because if the price of eth drops, then you get less.
00:28:34.402 - 00:29:29.442, Speaker A: But what's powerful here is that it's not trusted, right? It's not like there is some sort of central authority that allows you to create or use this kind of product. This is something that's naturally created on top of blockchain. This is something that's fully automatic, that makes sure that everything will be fully backed, repaid and properly managed. And you can be sure that it all works well. You can do shorts, you can, for example, put dies into the compound pool, borrow eth, sell it, and then when the price of eth drops, rebuy it for a cheaper price and keep the rest of the die. Of course, the other way around, you will lose. But that's how market works.
00:29:29.442 - 00:30:59.214, Speaker A: And here there won't be like any stopping the market and deciding that it's volatile and dangerous. Whatever you think is okay, whatever you think is not risky, not too risky for you, and there is no one to stop you, if not the smart contract logic, which is always a making the final decision on what can be done and what cannot be done. And the other thing is just, you can actually buy stuff with these mechanisms, right? Because, for example, believe me or not, but there are some people that consider their cryptocurrencies their wealth, and they do not actually intend to sell that, ever or not in the near future. So if you want to buy something, you can actually put your cryptocurrency into the vault, issue some dice, and then, for example, hope that your debt will be rising slower than the value of your reef, which might happen, might not. You can actually use the value of your currencies without getting rid of them. Or at some point you can just liquidate the vault itself with a flash loan. Right.
00:30:59.214 - 00:32:01.454, Speaker A: So I will explain that sometime in the future, I guess, but that's also what's on the table. Is there more? There is. There are dozens of different kind of things. So, for example, there are decentralized exchanges. It's always very controversial topic, like the decentralized points of failure, right? The stories of the cryptocurrency exchanges that were failing and they were closing the markets or they were just disappearing. This problem doesn't exist anymore. If you are using proper tools, there are products that allow you to exchange stuff on chain without, like, there is of course a risk, the protocol risk that something will fail or the whole blockchain will disappear.
00:32:01.454 - 00:32:53.634, Speaker A: But it's like significantly less risk than using a centralized exchange. And you can also compose stuff that utilizes these exchanges and perform some automatic operations. I won't dive deep into the decentralized exchange kind of topic because we'll have a presentation from Alex and he will explain everything. There is yield farming, which is like a very trendy topic these days. So I wanted to mention it and more or less explain what it's all about. Because probably if you are completely new to deFi, then you probably haven't heard about it. That's fine.
00:32:53.634 - 00:34:05.222, Speaker A: But if you are not new to deFi, then you probably heard that. So what it is, we had this simple compound example, right? There was someone with some amount of Dai tokens which were located to the compound pool. The C DAI were issued, and this depositor was earning some yield on top of that. So this is the simplest form of yield farming, right? It's not very sophisticated, but it is one. And let's stick to the compound. So, because actually, compound probably was the first one to create a product that created the term of yield farming because they started adding a comp token. So the active users of the compulsory protocol were allowed to claim some small amount of comp token.
00:34:05.222 - 00:35:15.314, Speaker A: Comp is like an internal compound governance token which empowers you to take decisions about the future of the protocol and what happened. Apparently the comp token was so valuable that it was okay for you to not only deposit your dies into the pool, earn some interest on your dies, and also earn the comp tokens. Actually, it was profitable for you to deposit dies and borrow eth, then deposit this eth again into the pool. Not repay it, just deposit it again. So you have more deposit, right? Actually, this deposit is losing value because you're both lending and borrowing at the same time, which you cannot profit from that. But this small amount of cop tokens was compensating that, and it was worth it. And then you have borrowing power from the c ether that you have.
00:35:15.314 - 00:36:21.446, Speaker A: So you borrow more die, and then you convert it to the c tokens again, and you again borrow more comp, you acquire more comp and apparently that was pretty scary moment because lots of people were thinking that it's going to blow up and there's going to be disaster. But there was nothing like that. It's not that profitable anymore. However, it's still like using compound is profitable, but these crazy things are not that profitable anymore. And that's how it was all proceeding, let's say. And now all different protocols are also having their own token, which is used for something, and that's supposed to bring value to their holders so people can actually do something interesting. And here we can ask a question about the comp token itself.
00:36:21.446 - 00:37:24.678, Speaker A: Like what is it for? Right? Because it shouldn't have any value at the first glance, right? Because ether is a cryptocurrency. Some people are even at this point of time still asking questions whether cryptocurrencies have value at all. So that's one thing. Then we have these dies, and if we consider ether to be valuable, then probably we should also honor dies and their value. But what is a comp token? Yeah, apparently there is this powerful governance thing which actually makes defi really decentralized. So whether anyone wants to change anything in the compound protocol, people that hold comp token decide whether this is a good option or not, and they vote whether they want this improvement to go live or not. And that's essential because there is like no central authority.
00:37:24.678 - 00:39:05.980, Speaker A: Of course not every project is starting from this point. This is when the projects evolve and develop. They are moving towards this decentralization. And they start probably with an owner, but then at some point they gain some traction, they gain some group of dedicated users, they have a community, and then this community actually governs the protocol. And that's very important because how do we know that these random people from across the Internet will know what's good for the protocol, right? Or will have good intentions, right? Because we are actually now, for example, the creators of compound actually passed the ownership of their child, of their company, to random people across the Internet who can do anything. Why would they act in a way the compound foundation wants? Because by holding this token, they expose themselves to the success of the compound, right? So the value of the comp token will probably go up if the compound is doing well, if compound is successful, if it's aggregating a lot of fees, if it's just prospering and will decrease in value if compound is not doing okay. That's a similar thing to the MKR token, for example.
00:39:05.980 - 00:40:18.306, Speaker A: These holders of this token are really interested in the protocol, doing well. So we actually have a system of really healthy incentives for random people from all across the world to cooperate and to democratically make solid, reasonable decision. And here is no place for populism or pure politics. It's pure meritocracy, where the facts and the best ideas are the ones that are picked. And these decentralized protocols are actually doing extraordinarily well. Right? And there are plenty of other things. There are nfcs, which are digital art, so you can have a unique object like piece of art or anything else.
00:40:18.306 - 00:41:14.850, Speaker A: You can put it on a blockchain and you can put it up for sale. There are options, because I'm now leaning towards the end, actually. At this point, if you have any questions, you can start thinking about them, because there's going to be A-Q-A session at the end. So there are options. So fancy things, fancy instruments for the pro traders, pro investors, there are indexes. So for the less pro investors, if you don't want to pick any one particular token, you can buy sort of an ETF which aggregates a lot of tokens inside and for example allows you to buy a whole sector, not only like a particular one random cryptocurrency that's going to succeed or not, you can just spread the risk. There are insurance protocols that allow you to buy insurance for your smart contract investment.
00:41:14.850 - 00:42:16.966, Speaker A: For example, when there is a bug in smart contract which happens, then you can get some sort of free fund from this protocol. And actually that's very fresh situation because there was some sort of an attack on one of the protocols recently and the insurance went extraordinarily well and people that were using it actually took no loss because they were just insured. There are plenty of other things. I think it's not a bold statement if I say that here on Ethereum blockchain mostly I don't want to exclude other blockchains, but I'm mostly focused on Ethereum blockchain and it's the closest to my heart. We have sort of Internet funding. Ethereum is not a product itself. It's even probably not a platform.
00:42:16.966 - 00:43:11.670, Speaker A: It's like a transact medium that allows new creators, new inventors, new startups to build all sorts of new things on top of what's already existing. And I think it's really exciting and I think it's really worth learning and it's really worth building. And yeah, I hope that you got interested and I hope that you're going to decide to learn more, because here what we saw was just like a tip of the iceberg. It's just like the first sip from the very tall glass of Defi. And I recommend you to deep diver to dive deeper. Okay, thank you. Thank you for your attention.
00:43:11.670 - 00:43:18.040, Speaker A: And if you have any questions then I will be really happy to answer them.
00:43:44.000 - 00:43:54.704, Speaker B: Back. Great to see you. Let's wait and see if we have any questions. Let's give it a couple moments. Here comes the first one.
00:43:54.822 - 00:43:57.250, Speaker A: Okay, I see the first one.
00:43:58.660 - 00:44:01.730, Speaker B: I'm going to read the questions and you're going to answer. How does that.
00:44:03.720 - 00:44:39.360, Speaker A: Have a plan to create tokens pegged to other fiat currencies or other assets? Example gold? I'm not aware of such plans. Of course. Probably the people from Maker foundation would be the best to answer. But what I noticed that there are plenty of other products that issue other fiat currencies. We have at least two types. Two separate synthetic euros. On ethereum blockchain.
00:44:39.360 - 00:45:15.370, Speaker A: There is trust token company which issues through Kong dollar, australian dollar, canadian dollar. There are probably more to be found on the synthetics. When it comes to maker, I'm not aware, but there are plenty of other products that do that. And gold is also available, at least in two different flavors because I've seen it. If it's maker, I'm not sure, but definitely this is something that's present.
00:45:18.240 - 00:45:50.692, Speaker B: I think definitely more than two gold stable coins. Plenty. I heard the rumors that maker is indeed planning more currencies in the future, but that is not official information by any standards, by any means. I think we have at least one more question. Let's see if it's coming. If it's not showing here, I'm going to read it. I.
00:45:50.692 - 00:46:01.160, Speaker B: It was asked by David Thak on Facebook, can I use compound governance protocol to govern my DaO?
00:46:03.020 - 00:47:04.140, Speaker A: So it depends. What's the question exactly about? Because I can see at least two ways to answer that. So, for example, what you can do, you probably can fork the compound governance smart contracts and implement systems similar to theirs. Because it's open source, it of course has some sort of license, but it's public to some limitation, and you can implement mechanisms that will work similarly. That's one approach. The other, if you are, for example, creating some compound related product, you can create smart contracts in a way that holders of the comp token will not only be able to govern the compound protocol, but also your protocol. Yeah, I think I don't know how to approach this in a different way.
00:47:04.140 - 00:47:47.564, Speaker A: Maybe I'm going to read it again, just to make sure. Generally, if we are talking purely about the protocol itself, which is like basic primitives and basic mechanics and the smart contract design and architecture, et cetera. I think that you can utilize these patterns in your project as well, and it might work. Of course, you need to probably first have a community and find a way to distribute these tokens, et cetera. This is the hardest part. I think that creating the protocol is probably the easiest. At the end of the day, we.
00:47:47.602 - 00:47:56.028, Speaker B: Have one more question coming. Again, I think there's going to be. I think we have more questions coming, so let's take this one first.
00:47:56.194 - 00:49:05.572, Speaker A: Okay? Yeah. So do you think we'll see financial NFTs in the near future and what it will do? Yeah, I was actually brainstorming this topic some time ago. I think that we will see more NFT use cases coming. So right now they're almost exclusively collectibles and digital art, which is like probably for a very narrow audience, and not everyone wants to get involved into that. But I think that there are plenty of usages and use cases for nfts which are not related to any sort of art. For example, at this point, some transactions on synthetics that are not atomic and that do not complete within one transaction mint you an NFT, and this NFT then allows you to claim the result of that transaction. So that's one thing.
00:49:05.572 - 00:49:56.992, Speaker A: The other is I think that we will probably see some sort of ownership proxy created with nfts in the future. Right? Because right now there is like one owner of a maker vault, for example. And I think that in the future we will see an ownership of a maker vault as an NFT. And then you can, for example, pass this ownership of maker vault to anyone else, or you can pass it to the protocol and you can actually build on top of that. Also there is Alpha Homora, which allows you to create leveraged yield farming positions. And they are all unique because you cannot participate in alpha Homora in very kind of like crowd sale type of things. So it's not like one pool.
00:49:56.992 - 00:50:46.676, Speaker A: Every position is unique and everyone needs to create and maintain own position similarly to the maker vault. So I think that this position also shouldn't be owned by addresses. Probably they should be some sort of nfts. And I think that a lot more are coming. Anything that is non fungible in a very high level way will be tokenized at some point. I don't know if that answers the question, I hope. Yes, if you want me to leak some real alpha, then I'm afraid I don't have killer up ideas for nfts at this point.
00:50:46.676 - 00:50:54.964, Speaker A: But I think they will be seen in a lot of projects and they will be very useful in the future.
00:50:55.082 - 00:51:07.548, Speaker B: I think we have few more questions. Let's take one more and push all the other questions to the networking at the very end. So let's see if we can see the next question.
00:51:07.714 - 00:51:10.510, Speaker A: It's going to be four, so we can take two.
00:51:13.360 - 00:51:58.968, Speaker B: Waiting to start his presentation. So let's generate a delay. I think the other question was on discord. And thank you for introduction to Defi. Could you tell us a little bit more about real use cases? We are a company that is purchasing insurance claim with a fiat currency, and we would like to explore where DeFi could be potential for financing this instrument. So real use cases, real insurance claim that is bought with fiat currency. And what are the possibilities in terms of Defi being a way of financing real life insurance claims?
00:51:59.064 - 00:53:05.280, Speaker A: Okay, so that's a tough one. So that of course, I think depends on the level of decentralization that you want to have in your product at the first place. Because probably if there's going to be one central authority that's going to, for example, decide whether the claim is rightful or not, then I'm not sure if it's going to be like a perfect fit for a decentralized solution. But generally I think that the whole insurance industry as a whole might move to Defi at some point. Actually, this is like really complicated question. Yeah, I think it might be worth to take it offline to the networking session because there are plenty of different things. Maybe.
00:53:05.280 - 00:53:29.450, Speaker A: I'm going to finish with a statement that I think it makes sense to move insurance products to defi, even if they are bought with fiat money at the retail consumer end. But it heavily depends on the exact use case.
00:53:33.740 - 00:54:27.828, Speaker B: Yeah, I think to summarize, I think there are definitely opportunities, but that hasn't been tried much so far. And that is connecting blockchain virtual space into physical. So that is not that much explored, although we see first loans that are kind of there. So there's, for example, the startup called Trufi that we would know a little bit about, especially Bardec, who was involved in creating this. And the idea is that you have a Dao and there is a voting and the person who is borrowing needs to be approved by the Dow. So it's like one of the first working. I think they actually have tens of millions of dollars already there in the pool.
00:54:27.828 - 00:54:54.450, Speaker B: So it's the first working with reasonable capital kind of use case. But that is a new use case. This is a new thing. This is like, two months old. So this is going to be happening this year. So then the question is, are you going to be a frontier? Because if you do, that's perfect. If you want to look at other people actually doing it before doing it yourself, then it might be not perfect timing for you yet.
