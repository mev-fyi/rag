00:00:10.860 - 00:00:27.024, Speaker A: Okay, since I am online. Hey, everyone who's watching. So thanks. I will be talking about balancer most about self balancing pools and the defi predictive that you should go.
00:00:27.142 - 00:00:27.970, Speaker B: I think.
00:00:28.420 - 00:00:55.672, Speaker A: What is a self balancing pool? That's an interesting question, right? When I first joined balancer, everyone was, hey, like, balancer is just an automatic market maker. And I think there's a much more interesting story there. And the story is, let's say I'm from Brazil. We have sugarcane here. That's sort of how the country started. And if you put sugar cane inside the meal, that's how you get sugar. But turns out you also get baguettes.
00:00:55.672 - 00:01:26.632, Speaker A: And baguettes is a side effect that is actually very useful in some situations. There's actually a lot of energy in it. So the same thing can be thought about curves. You get arbitrage, you put it on a curve and you get an exchange, and you also get a liquidity pool. And the liquidity pool is sort of the side effect of the byproduct of having an exchange. And the liquidity pool works in a very interesting way.
00:01:26.686 - 00:01:27.048, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:27.134 - 00:02:17.780, Speaker A: You probably heard about liquidity pool. They are everywhere. And the way they work is you can think of them as two connecting vessels where as one of the sides starts to grow more, what happens is that, let's say you have ether and bitcoin one. As bitcoin grows, grows, grows, what's going to happen is that going to flow over into the other side, right? And those bitcoins will be sold and turned into ether, and the same thing will happen all the time. As ether goes up, it starts falling on the other side. And as bitcoin goes up, it starts falling. It's a self balancing and a self equilibrium pool, right? And it's literally a pool.
00:02:17.780 - 00:03:06.872, Speaker A: You can think of it as a pool of water. And what I'm saying is, if you think of uniswap, the biggest automatic market maker, it is for trading. And as I buy product, you get a self balancing portfolio of two tokens, right? But balancers started with the idea of trying to build self balanced portfolios, and they got into basically the same mechanism. And we actually want to create self balancing portfolios for any number of tokens. And as I buy product, you get trading. And I think that's a super interesting switch there, because why does self balancing portfolio work?
00:03:06.926 - 00:03:07.336, Speaker B: Right?
00:03:07.438 - 00:03:56.440, Speaker A: Let's take a look at the current defy market, right? Every so often I update those numbers. Right now we have like $13 billion maker, $11 billion in A's $9 billion in compound seven, curve seven in uniswaps. Balancer is at eleven with $2 billion, which a lot of money. But it's just that there's a lot of other competitors there. If you put it in context, right, let's say the dot of the eye is, I think, $2 million, something like that. This would be $2 billion, this would be $7,000,000.11, $13 billion, which is maker.
00:03:56.440 - 00:04:10.312, Speaker A: But putting that in context, that's also Robin Hood, right? You can see that Robin Hood can eat up all of DFI swallow up, and it still fits together inside Robin Hood.
00:04:10.376 - 00:04:10.990, Speaker B: Right?
00:04:12.400 - 00:04:18.750, Speaker A: It's getting shorter, right? It's getting like. We are getting there, but Robin Hood is still bigger than us.
00:04:19.380 - 00:04:20.130, Speaker B: But.
00:04:22.660 - 00:05:10.108, Speaker A: If you get something like Berkshire Hataway, they are $800 billion. If we are the earth, Berkshire Hataway is Jupiter or something like that, right? And if we zoom out, we can go and zoom out more and more and more. What we're going to get is even Berkshire Hathaway is small fish compared to people like Vanguard. And why am I comparing Defi to Vanguard and to Berkshire Hathaway, right? If we are this little planet, Vanguard is the sun. Berkshire Hathaway is like Jupiter, right? This is us. This is home. Like the pale black dots.
00:05:10.108 - 00:05:39.924, Speaker A: Why am I comparing those two things? It seems that they are completely unrelated, but I would say no, because really, what those guys do is just, they do portfolios, right? That's all those guys do. They just keep changing the portfolio. They're just adjusting the portfolio here and there. But you can think of a portfolio as just, there are assets, there's a strategy and there's governance.
00:05:40.052 - 00:05:40.392, Speaker B: Right?
00:05:40.446 - 00:06:25.316, Speaker A: Those three things. It makes what Berkshire Hathaway is, what Bangward is, what Robinhood is, it's just bunch of assets with some governance and some strategy, right? And we can think of the assets. The strategy can be. Assets can be. Of course, assets are in the physical world in Bengalurg and Berkshire Hathaway. I think what pins us all together is the belief that probably everything that is out there, everything that is on Nasdaq, everything that can be traded on a stock market, will be tradable in crypto.
00:06:25.348 - 00:06:25.640, Speaker B: Right?
00:06:25.710 - 00:06:51.084, Speaker A: Everything is being cryptonized. So everything that can be on a crypto asset will be a real asset. Strategy is a trading curve. It's just that. How exactly do you decide, when do you sell and when do you buy? And governance is what decides which assets you have, right. Normally we think of assets. We think of, oh, there are high risk assets.
00:06:51.084 - 00:07:18.356, Speaker A: There are low risk assets. There is a backdrop of assets. You can set all of that inside the making of this curve. And people are doing a lot of curves, right? So we have just basic polls in balance right now, which is just straightforward polls. One, two, or three tokens. Like, it can be up to eight. Used to be, that was up to eight tokens.
00:07:18.356 - 00:08:02.628, Speaker A: Now we launch a new version. It's basically infinite tokens. I think it's like 100 tokens, something crazy like that. Just like, okay, you create a pool, and it's going to forever be those few tokens with that specific rate, right? So maybe it's 80 ball, $20, and it's going to be forever like that. But people are doing other very interesting things, like Pydow. They want to create an autonomous index fund on balancer, and they are doing that. And the idea is really like, look, you get that traditional exposure, that crypto exposure, that cash, you turn that into crypto assets.
00:08:02.628 - 00:08:27.968, Speaker A: You put that in a balancer, right? Catnip exchange. I love this super cute little cat. They are creating prediction markets on wallet. Why? Because a prediction market is always something. It's also a self balancing pool, right? You have one token. Yes. You have token, no.
00:08:27.968 - 00:09:14.948, Speaker A: Maybe you have multiple tokens and you want to sell them, and you want to make sure that they trade at a specific price. So what you can do is you can just set a pool there, and you have a way in which the price sort of like where the price sort of changes according to the market. That pool will provide you the liquidity and allow you to automatically switch to automatically balance that out. A lot of things you could build a prediction market. You just pick a pool, put two tokens there. Yes. And low or whatever is the tokens, and you start selling that pool, you have the liquidity.
00:09:14.948 - 00:09:45.708, Speaker A: You have a lot of the work in building the liquidity prediction market itself is already automated inside the pool. Primedao, it's not five dow before it was primed out. It's helping do liquidity bootstrapping pool. Now, liquidity bootstrapping is something that is super interesting, right? And I think the best way to think of it is ipos.
00:09:45.824 - 00:09:46.490, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:47.180 - 00:11:06.080, Speaker A: When we started the ICO craze of 2017, we think of, oh, 2017, that was the ICO rate. And what happened is that people were really trying to play around with the idea of what is the best way to sell a token online? Do you put it online and then you set a price. And if you set a price that doesn't match wherever is the market price, then you have a problem in which people like it sells out very quickly. And if you force it not to sell out very quickly, or if you force, and what happens is suddenly you have an auction on gas prices, right? Some ICO will started lasting instead of weeks, they would start last a day or last an hour, last five minutes. And the problem is the minute that it starts, your ICO only lasts five minutes. Then the real option was happening on the gas prices. Gas prices were like the miners were getting all the extra value of how the market, if the market wants to pay $1,000 or something that is being sold $100, what happens is people are going to pay $100 for the token and pay $900 for the gas.
00:11:06.080 - 00:12:00.532, Speaker A: And then maybe you do an auction, maybe you do like a dutch action where it goes down. But then often what happens is that you don't have enough liquidity for that. So I think a liquidity bootstrapping tool is something that has been happening with a lot of tokens. And what they do is they create just a token pool that has a schedule to it. So it stores, let's say 90% eater, or maybe it's like 50% eater, 50% die. You store to very, two very liquid tokens and then you just a tiny bit, you take 1% of that and you add a new token on there. What's going to happen is that that tiny percent of that token, the market doesn't still know what price is going to have.
00:12:00.532 - 00:13:03.332, Speaker A: So it's going to go up, it's going to go down. But mostly it's a tiny market cap, so it doesn't really matter. But every day or every hour, you increase that amount a little bit and then a little bit more, right? And let's say you start with a million dollars in very liquid assets like Etern Buy, and you start with like 1% of that is in a very illiquid asset of a new token that nobody really knows what the price is. That pool will work at creating a buy pressure where every hour or so it's going to buy one more percent of that pool, it's going to sell it and want to buy it on that token. And the pool will do that automatically. You just increase the share slowly, and people are able to buy and sell the tokens to that pool at whatever market price they want.
00:13:03.386 - 00:13:03.604, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:03.642 - 00:13:04.644, Speaker A: That's the interesting thing.
00:13:04.682 - 00:13:04.944, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:05.002 - 00:14:20.610, Speaker A: The pool will basically be saying, look, I'm buying this token at this price, and then people sell more token until it sort of figure out the right price, the market price, and then it's basically eating up that volatility until at some point you have a token, you have a pool that is maybe 80% or 50% or whatever radio you want for new token. Why is that interesting? Because suddenly now you have two things. First, you were able to sell the token. You start with a million dollars, and now it's mostly made of token. It meant that if at any moment you joined the pool, you would get like if you joined the pool in the beginning when the pool was just EJ and die, then by the end of it, you bought tokens without having to worry about whatever is the market price. With all the fluctuation, in fact, you gain as a liquidity provider, as someone who wanted to buy token initially, you actually gain interest. You gain all the trading fees of people just buying and selling the token until it found a market.
00:14:20.610 - 00:15:10.000, Speaker A: Imagine if you do that, let's say, with bitcoin or ether. You could do that with just ether and die, right? You could say, look, I want to buy a million dollars in die collectively. Of course you are going to buy a million dollars in ether or buy a million dollars in bitcoin. Maybe you want to sell a million dollars in bitcoin, but you don't know what price to sell it, and you want to do it over a year. You could create a pool that starts with a big amount of money, and slowly it sells, and it sells out, and sells out, and sells out. And in practice, if you work like they call it a dollar average, in which you're just buying the average price. And I think that's a great way of thinking of poll.
00:15:13.540 - 00:15:14.290, Speaker B: Next.
00:15:17.140 - 00:15:56.350, Speaker A: So that's how the physical setting will work. And I think they work. If you just search for how people are launching tokens, you realize there's a whole new universe of people launching tokens one after the other, using the fool. And I think that's super interesting. So balancer virtue, we just launched in beginning of March, beginning of May. We are in May. And I think there's some very cool things, and I think just let's talk about elephants in the room also like Uniswap v three.
00:15:56.350 - 00:16:55.294, Speaker A: Balancer and UNiCEF have an interesting story, right? Because they started together in which they started away, and they sort of converged on the same solution, and now they are diverging it very deeply, right? So balancer wanted. Fernando started writing a white paper because he wanted self balancing portfolios. Uniflap wanted trading. They ended up with the same solution, which is like a liquidity pool. And now Unitslab is very different from where we are going, right? And I think it's great. It's very good for the ecosystem that everyone is trying different things. So first thing that I find super interesting is that before, every time you had to create a pool, you had to create a new smart contract, like with the new assets are on that smart contract.
00:16:55.294 - 00:17:44.514, Speaker A: With the new logic inside the smart contract, whenever someone wants to interact with that, people need to do an approval transaction for that smart contract. In V two, we are changing all of that. There's like one big main smart contract which has been super audited. And it's actually very simple because all it does, it handles the tokens, right? There was like one big smart contract with all the tokens inside. And then whenever you want to create a new pool, you just create the logic for it and it plugs into that big pool and it creates a lot of advantages. You pay less fees on it, you pay less gas on it. And there's also something very cool.
00:17:44.514 - 00:18:36.340, Speaker A: The arbitrage is a lot cheaper on that. Before, if you saw, let's say three or four pools and there was an arbitrage opportunity, if you like, I want to buy this guy and then sell with that guy and trade with that other thing over there, you had to actually own all those tokens and trade off them. Bouncer V two, all you need to do is you realize that arbitrage, you send instructions to the pool and maybe you don't even need to have any tokens out. You don't have to have your own tokens or ever do executive trades. You just get the profit out of that. You just tell, hey, I realize an arbitrage, if you sell this and buy this and sell that and buy this, and then it's going to do all of that sort of internally, and it's just going to send you the profit, like cheaper gas, better profit. And I think that's actually fun.
00:18:36.340 - 00:19:07.790, Speaker A: So it's a lot more gas efficient for that reason. And we all know how gas is right now. So that's when I was also talking about all the assets are now in one big smart contract. And I think that there's a lot of advantage that you can create. Any logic that you want in your smart contract, just plug it to the motor chip and you can launch whatever pool you want.
00:19:07.860 - 00:19:08.382, Speaker B: Right?
00:19:08.516 - 00:19:58.240, Speaker A: Make a prediction marker out of it, make a dow out of it. I think, just think of this dow, like the original didao in which you had a vote and then you had a vote on how to spend things. And if you didn't want, you had to rage, quit. And that's like also Moloch Dow. I think almost all of that is already inside a pool, because when you are part of a pool, you get liquidity pool tokens, which is a token which you could use to share. You could use either to sell and get those tokens out, or you could use to vote and use those votes to, let's say, change a radio, right? And then suddenly creating a dow, it's a lot easier. Another cool thing, and I think that's actually super cool.
00:19:58.240 - 00:20:14.638, Speaker A: Capital efficiency. Normally, like in two tokens pool, you have a large amount of capital, and then you only need a small one that is being used for trading.
00:20:14.734 - 00:20:15.380, Speaker B: Right.
00:20:17.670 - 00:21:11.620, Speaker A: I think this is clearly where we and Uniswap have diverged. And I think it's fantastic. What you do is you allow the pool to automatically take that capital that is not being used and use it everywhere. Elsewhere in a lending platform, let's say, right? So let's say you can have a million dollars in a pool, but only you have only, let's say, trading dollars. So you only need, let's say, pool. The rest of the 800K can be put in compound or put in a lending platform, and automatically that lending goes back to the pool. So by owning a share of the pool, not only you own the trading fees of the pool, not only you get the self balanced portfolio advantage, but you also can be investing it.
00:21:11.620 - 00:21:56.370, Speaker A: Your money is on balancer, but it's also on compound. It's also on Wifi, right? It's also on idle finance. And I think that makes the difference. Balancer is for builders, right? What we want is balancer is for you who want to build stuff. And I hope you come to us and you learn more about how pools work, because pools, in fact, when you learn how they work, you realize, oh, my God, I can do so much with pools. I can build so many other stuff. And I think that's really fantastic.
00:21:56.370 - 00:22:25.280, Speaker A: And that's it. That's my presentation, I think 21 minutes. I think it's good. So you can go to Balancer finance. Actually, you can go to Balancer five, but we have a new address, Balancer Phi, which is just what it's going to get the raiser archive automatically and like, Balancer Labs. And we are hiring. So if you want to work at Balancer, just shoot an email to us and thank you.
00:22:25.280 - 00:22:31.200, Speaker A: That's it. You have any questions?
00:22:31.570 - 00:22:32.320, Speaker B: One.
00:22:41.150 - 00:23:08.420, Speaker A: Okay, well, thanks, Eric Poland, for having me thanks, Anthony. I really hope to see you at some point. After Covid is. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Alex.
00:23:08.880 - 00:23:09.630, Speaker B: You.
00:23:11.120 - 00:23:13.820, Speaker A: Thank you. Bye.
