00:00:00.530 - 00:00:01.080, Speaker A: You.
00:00:02.970 - 00:00:31.086, Speaker B: In it. So, yeah, let's wait just a minute or so. And we'll be starting today. We have a lineup of great speakers. We're going to have two speakers, we're going to have a guest speaker. There are plenty of announcements that we're going to do today as well. So I think it's going to be x extremely well, extremely good meeting today.
00:00:31.086 - 00:01:05.802, Speaker B: So really looking forward to it. And yeah, there are some announcements that we're going to make. I would like also to take that half a minute or so to tell you all that it's been a great journey so far and the amount of people is overwhelming. Who joined Zeroites Poland. We more than double the amount of people from the first to the second meetup. We more than double the amount of people who joined us. So it's really great.
00:01:05.802 - 00:01:44.978, Speaker B: And yeah, I think without further ado, we're going to start. So let me tell you, I'm Marek from ifworks. We are organizing it together with Maker. And let me remind you why we're doing it. We want to build a lasting developer blockchain community here in Poland, but open to really anyone in the world. And we have a great media partners. Cryptodev TV is resume bitcoina who help us promote and who help in our mission to build a lasting community of developers of blockchain developers.
00:01:44.978 - 00:02:25.460, Speaker B: And it's going to be our third meeting today, third meetup that we organized. We also had a workshop last month, a weekend workshop. And I'm going to tell you a little bit more about it in a moment. And we're going to have five more meetings this season, including today. We're going to have a student workshops and we're going to have more weekend workshops and we're going to have a hackathon. So I want to tell you that last workshop there was a great amount of demand, and thanks to maker, we were able to do two groups instead of one. So there were two groups, each was ten people.
00:02:25.460 - 00:03:03.006, Speaker B: Everyone showed up. So that's really great. And we were only able to invite half of the people who sign up. So therefore, we would like to announce that in top of student workshops that we start in just a few weeks and another workshops in May. We're going to do additional workshops in April. That's going to be led by the Merker team, so that anyone who would like to can join and start learning blockchain development. We also announced earlier that we're going to do a hackathon in May.
00:03:03.006 - 00:03:49.026, Speaker B: The days for the hackathon has changed. It's going to be similar time, but a little bit different because it's going to be remote first. So it's going to be fully remote. Hackathon that's going to start on Friday, 21 May, and we're going to finish on May the 29th. And I'm happy to tell you that we're going to have some great partners, some great sponsors. We already secured $25,000 for prizes, and I think it's going to be much more than that because we just started working with our partners and sponsors to build this price pool. So we're going to announce we're going to have a great speakers, we're going to have great workshops, and we're going to have great price pool.
00:03:49.026 - 00:04:21.078, Speaker B: So I would like to invite you all. Follow us on our social media, follow us on Twitter on zeroxpoland. But also we just opened Discord. So please join us on Discord. And you can expect announcement of specific partners and prizes and speakers in upcoming weeks. And today we're going to have two presentations. There's going to be introduction to Defi by Bartek Rutkowski from itworks, who's going to explain what the whole decentralized finance bus is all about.
00:04:21.078 - 00:04:55.570, Speaker B: And then we have a great guest speaker from Balancer, Alex Vandersanda, who's going to explain in particular what is the state of automated market making and why we should already go beyond that. So, really great lineup. And without further ado, I will let Bartek start his. Yeah, I think we're ready. Bartek, are you joining us? Wonderful. Hi, Bardek.
00:04:56.070 - 00:04:56.626, Speaker C: Hey.
00:04:56.728 - 00:04:57.090, Speaker A: Yes.
00:04:57.160 - 00:04:58.340, Speaker C: Great to be here.
00:04:59.510 - 00:04:59.922, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:59.976 - 00:05:40.894, Speaker C: So I think I'll take it from here. So, introduction to DeFi. Today we're going to talk about what this whole d five thing is all about. We've heard on the previous meetup something about ERC 20 token standard. We've heard on the previous event something about coding debt. Now it's time to put all these pieces together and compose a bigger picture that will be actually useful and that will be actually bringing real value to this world so we can utilize it and see why is it so important. So, before I continue, I just want to mention that I'm not a financial advisor.
00:05:40.894 - 00:06:37.214, Speaker C: Nothing what I say should be treated as such. And I know my excitement might sound like a financial advice, but it's not one. So it's only my private opinion about heavy. Okay, so what is DeFi? DeFi stands for decentralized finance. And this is whole ecosystem of different sorts of projects that utilize smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain not necessarily on Ethereum. DeFi refers to all of the projects that deliver financial products across different blockchains. But it's mostly ethereum these days as Ethereum holds the majority of utilized liquidity and the most debts create stuff on Ethereum blockchain.
00:06:37.214 - 00:07:24.942, Speaker C: And as we can see there is this aggregator of data which is called Defi pulse. And that screenshot that I've made for a similar presentation that I was doing around two years ago. So two years ago there were like some projects with some amount of USD locked inside. The total value locked in the DeFi was half a billion dollar and maker was like a solid leader. And that was actually the only project that was kind of on the scene. And today that's actually the screenshot taken. Today we have 37 billion of dollars locked in different DeFi projects.
00:07:24.942 - 00:08:06.000, Speaker C: And maker, which still holds the strongest position on the market, is not a killer, it's not a tyrant that holds everything. So it's growing rapidly. The tempo growth is outrageous and the ecosystem is really flourishing. Yeah. So what is this DeFi thing actually doing? We say decentralized finance. So we imagine some financial stuff. So let's start with the simplest example possible.
00:08:06.000 - 00:08:41.830, Speaker C: Let's imagine simple banking. What is banking all about? We have our hard earned money and we put it in a bank. We put it in a bank because we want it secured. And sometime ago we even used to pay for that, right? Because banks provide security. Banks, banks can make sure that we won't lose our money. And we are paying for that sometime passed. And banks realized that it's nice to actually use this money inside because it can be lend, it can be utilized in some way that it brings profit.
00:08:41.830 - 00:09:42.574, Speaker C: So we won't need to pay to the banks anymore because the bank can make use of our money, so it can profit. And actually it also brings profit to us, right? Because we deposit money into the bank and we receive some small portion of gains created with the capital that we have put in our bank. Sounds like a simple example, sounds like a simple truth, that we put something in the bank and we get a little bit of profit. So I think it should be possible to do it with smart contracts on a blockchain using primitives that we discussed in previous months. So let's explore compound. So first of all, first of all, we have some portion of Dai. Dai is an ERC 20 token token, like one of these we discussed a month ago.
00:09:42.574 - 00:10:27.006, Speaker C: And one unit of DAI is always worth one dollars, around one dollars. And let's imagine that compound is this sort of a smart contract bank. And we put these dies into the compound. We put them into there, we deposit our cash into the bank and we get some virtual number, which is in this case another ERC 20 token, which just says this guy deposited this amount of money into the compound. It represents our share in the whole pool of funds in the compound. And how this money, this token in the pool, can bring a new profit. On the other end.
00:10:27.006 - 00:11:09.766, Speaker C: We have a guy that wants to borrow it. So he puts collateral, and because the value of the collateral is greater than the amount of the amount of the funds that we want to borrow, he is able to borrow the funds from the pool. We need to do that because we need to make sure that he pays it back. Because his collateral is more valuable than the dies he took. So he's incentivized to actually pay it back after some amount of time. Oh, actually before that, I think it would be nice to make a comparison to the traditional finance. Because imagine a mortgage, right? The collateral might be considered, for example, a piece of real estate.
00:11:09.766 - 00:11:59.898, Speaker C: In normal case, you put the ownership of a piece of real estate, like you pass it to the bank. So the bank can hold the real estate actually, so you can borrow funds needed to complete the purchase. And then after some time, you pay back money and you truly become an owner of the real estate. And similarly here you put ether, for example, some sort of collateral into the compound. You borrow die, and after some amount of time you pay the die back or your collateral is taken from you if you are not willing to pay your debt back. And that generates profit. And that generates profit because that's of course, not for free.
00:11:59.898 - 00:12:54.234, Speaker C: And then the girl on the left side, who was first to deposit her funds, her hard earned dies into the compound, can withdraw with a profit. Most of the profit goes to hair. And some small portion of these funds is left in the compound pool. Compound is indeed not a charity. And this model works extremely well. It's extremely simple and works well. And now there's something I missed, because actually the guy that put the collateral into the compound also receives some token that represents his funds located in the pool, right? Because he also had to locate something into the pool and then he should be able to withdraw it.
00:12:54.234 - 00:14:01.346, Speaker C: So now we have an interesting case, because now we see that not only the DaI depositor can borrow ether, not only depositor can borrow die, but also depositor can borrow ether. So both of the sites can deposit something, earn some yield on top of that, and borrow other funds that are located in the pool. And now, how does it happen that these funds are not blocked forever? Right? Because we have now the girl on the left who might intend to withdraw her die, and they are not there. Right. So how does she do that? And on the other hand, there is a guy on the right side which might want to withdraw some amount of ether, but it might not be possible because this amount of ether is not present in the pool. So now we have this thing called utilization ratio. And utilization ratio says how valuable an asset in the pool is.
00:14:01.346 - 00:14:46.266, Speaker C: So, as we see, most of the dyes located in the pool, located in the pool are already utilized. So somebody borrowed them. They are not there. And that indicates the high cost of such loan. Right? So high cost of such loan, on one hand, incentivizes more die depositors to deposit into the pool so they can earn high yield. And on the other, it incentivizes borrowers to pay their loan back because it's just expensive. And we see, similarly with ETH, only small portion of ETH is borrowed, so it's not needed that much anymore.
00:14:46.266 - 00:15:29.870, Speaker C: And we do not incentivize more people to put their ETH into the pool. But on the other hand, borrowing this ETH is not that expensive. So anyone can do that. Yeah. And as we now consider these two sides of the compound system, which is pool and collateral, we can actually see that it should be only one thing. Only pool people deposit stuff, whatever it is, they gain borrowing power because they can borrow against their deposit, against their collateral, and they, in turn, earn yield on top of stuff that they deposited. Simple and extremely powerful.
00:15:29.870 - 00:16:24.000, Speaker C: Actually, I can tell you even more, and that will be only a teaser, because I don't want to dive too deep into this one. But it's possible, actually, to borrow something from the pool without any collateral, but only in such a case, if you do this for a very short period of time. And this period of time is only one transaction. So you need to borrow and pay back a loan in the same transaction. You need a special smart contract for that. And this is extremely useful tool that we cannot see in the traditional banking system, at least not available for retail, for retail users. And I think that we will explore it sometime later.
00:16:24.000 - 00:17:20.398, Speaker C: But, yeah, it's also possible synths. So we were talking about this compound example about different sorts of tokens, right? The ERC 20 tokens. And there was this die. I was saying that one die is worth one dollars, but actually, why is die worth one dollars? And actually, why anyone accepts die when anyone can deploy any ERC 20 token. And it's like just a piece of code. So what is actually die at the beginning? Let's synthetic asset like in depth what's essentially a synthetic asset. So we are going to start with the simplest possible example, which is wrapped ether.
00:17:20.398 - 00:18:22.334, Speaker C: Wrapped ether is an asset that solves one very painful problem of smart contracts. We have an ERC 20 standard. All of the projects utilize ERC 20 tokens. We have dozens, hundreds of different ERC 20 tokens, while we have ETH, which has completely different interface. So whenever you create a system like for example, compound which utilizes both tokens and eth, you can implement it for an ERC 20 token which utilizes 99% of the whole market. And then this one edge case for eth, which is not a near c 20 token. So how to fix that? So apparently the easiest solution is to just wrap an eth in a token, right? So you can put your eth into the vault.
00:18:22.334 - 00:19:06.238, Speaker C: And this vault, whenever you deposit into this vault, will give you exactly the same amount of wrapped eth. This is like extremely simple, right? This is basically the code that's responsible for the logic of depositing and withdrawing. Whenever you deposit stuff, you pay some amount of ether, you receive proper amount of wrapped ether. And the other way around whether you want to withdraw, you just create a transaction that will pull your tokens from your account back to the vault, burn these tokens and return your eth. As simple as that. And we have a lot of sims like that. This one is the purest.
00:19:06.238 - 00:20:00.282, Speaker C: But this is kind of a synth that we can call a custodial synth. This is a synth. There is like one issuer of the token, one issuer of the currency. And this issuer guarantees that anytime you pass them your asset, whether it's bitcoin, whether it's us dollar, they are going to mint you proper amount of token representing deposit. So you can take one bitcoin, pass it to the wrapped bitcoin issuer, and you will get wrapped bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. You can deposit us dollar in a special account, and then you will receive USDC or TUSD on ethereum blockchain. But still, it's not die.
00:20:00.282 - 00:20:42.362, Speaker C: What is it then? So far we are discussing only tokens which are hard pegged. Hard pegged means that they are hard pegged to their origins. So they can only always one wrap. Bitcoin can always and especially one if to one graph, if and the other way around. Because that's very simple. Smart contract transaction. Dai doesn't look like that.
00:20:42.362 - 00:21:28.274, Speaker C: So how does it work? Dai is a token which was introduced by the Maker foundation, which was like the first great DeFi project. And the idea is like this. You put your eth into a special vault. This special vault evaluates how much eth you put in there. Like in dollar value terms, right? So, not like it's one ether. It's like there is an ether worth of $200 whatever, and then you can create an amount of die that is always lower than the amount of e inside the vault. So die is like kind of.
00:21:28.274 - 00:22:05.690, Speaker C: Let's say for now, it's like ether backed stablecoin, right? So it's a token, it's a currency that's backed by the value kept inside the vaults in different sort of currencies. Like, for example, ether. We had the gold standard, right? So some time ago, like, each us dollar or whatever else was backed by some amount of gold put in special vault, which was banned. And now we have this. It's not the same. It's not the same. I know it works slightly different, but there are similarities.
00:22:05.690 - 00:22:58.894, Speaker C: And after you create these eyes, you can do anything with them. Like, literally anything. You can sell them, you can exchange them, you can keep them, you can do whatever you want. And then you need to pay them back with a small fee. This fee cannot be paid in die, of course, because how can you get more die than you meant it, right? Of course you can buy these dies from somebody else, but then he won't be able to repay his debt, et cetera. So you need to pay the debt, you need to pay it back with adding some fee, which is expressed in the MKR token. And what happens if your debt is too large? Like, larger than the value of the vault? That probably won't incentivize you to ever pay it back.
00:22:58.894 - 00:23:38.934, Speaker C: Or worse, what happens if the value of ETH drops down? And now it doesn't actually cover the synthetic debt that you issued, so it's no longer bucking these synthetically created dice. There is a mechanism for that, of course. It's called collateralization ratio. And this is like a kind of red line. It's simplified here. It's simplified, but I think it explains the rule. It's a line that's drawn between the value of ETH and between the amount of die.
00:23:38.934 - 00:24:16.390, Speaker C: And whenever the value of eth drops down, so these values are met. The system says, okay, whatever, take your dice. We don't want to see them anymore. It's your problem now. We take out your ETH, we'll sell it on the open free market. We will buy die from someone else and we will repay your debt. And basically your vault is closed, your debt is neutralized because we will repay dice from anyone else on the market.
00:24:16.390 - 00:25:17.580, Speaker C: You will still manage to keep some small portion of if that was left for you. But generally your position is liquidated, right? Because system needs to be sure that all of the dies are backed by ether. The other way around, if your debt raises so high that this ratio is met, the same will happen. The vault will be liquidated, the ether will be taken out, will be sold, and you will just get the rest and you can keep your die and you don't need to repay the MKR debt anymore. But what happens if the situation is so rapid that within minutes or within one block period of time or whatever, really quickly, the value of if drops so badly that the system is not able to react? Right. It happens. It actually happens one time.
00:25:17.580 - 00:25:53.390, Speaker C: I'm not sure if it was only once, but once for sure. March 2020. And in such a case, the maker system will print new MKR tokens to cover your debt. And that worked. So you can be sure that every die is always backed by ether. This is one of its trends. There are more, but yeah.
00:25:53.390 - 00:26:49.398, Speaker C: So, to summarize, make sure that your dyes are always covered with proper amount of teeth and the vault is safe. And actually, what's interesting, this can be done with other types of collateral as well. So you can, for example, put your bitcoin into the vault and then borrow against it. So you don't need to actually sell it to use its value, right. You don't need anymore to necessarily sell the currency cryptocurrency, but you can lock it, borrow some dies against it, and then just repay them, use them in a way that you would like to use them. And in the future, that's not true at this point. This is like future, probably.
00:26:49.398 - 00:28:16.114, Speaker C: Maybe at some point you will be able actually, for example, to get a mortgage on blockchain, right? Because you would need to lock a tokenized real estate into the vault, and then you would be able to issue some amount of die that will be able to help you complete the purchase, for example. That's future, I guess. So what can be used for this whole thing? Because now I showed you two simple premises, which is like, one is pooling stuff, putting stuff into one pool, and then borrowing and then paying interest, and now issuing a synthetic asset which is backed by some other asset, because it sounds like it's very, like, what can it be actually used for, right? So let's take an example. You can create a leveraged token. So, for example, can put ether into the vault, mint some dice, then sell the dice for more ether, put this ether into another vault or into the same one, whatever you prefer. Then you can mint more dice, buy more eth, et cetera. Like create this leverage position.
00:28:16.114 - 00:29:26.022, Speaker C: And then at the end of the day, when you have, at the very beginning, you had $200 of worth of eth, but then when the price changes, you get more. Of course it's dangerous, because if the price of eth drops, then you get less. But what's powerful here is that it's not trusted, right? It's not like there is some sort of central authority that allows you to create or use this kind of product. This is something that's naturally created on top of blockchain. This is something that's fully automatic, that makes sure that everything will be fully backed, repaid and properly managed. And you can be sure that it all works well. You can do shorts, you can, for example, put dies into the compound pool, borrow eth, sell it, and then when the price of eth drops, rebuy it for a cheaper price and keep the rest of the die.
00:29:26.022 - 00:30:47.300, Speaker C: Of course, the other way around, you will lose. But that's how market works. And here there won't be like any stopping the market and deciding that it's volatile and dangerous, you need more. Whatever you think is okay, whatever you think is not risky, not too risky for you. And there is no one to stop you, if not the smart contract logic, which is always making the final decision on what can be done and what cannot be done. And the other thing is just, you can actually buy stuff with these mechanisms, right? Because, for example, believe me or not, but there are some people that consider their cryptocurrencies their wealth, and they do not actually intend to sell that, ever or not in the near future. So if you want to buy something, you can actually put your cryptocurrency into the vault, issue some dice, and then, for example, hope that your debt will be rising slower than the value of your reef, which might happen, might not.
00:30:47.300 - 00:31:47.190, Speaker C: You can actually use the value of your currencies without getting rid of them. Or at some point you can just liquidate the vault itself with a flash loan. Right? So I will explain that sometime in the future, I guess, but that's also what's on the table. Is there more? There is. There are dozens of different kind of things. So, for example, there are decentralized exchanges it's always very controversial topic, like the decentralized points of failure, right? The stories of the cryptocurrency exchanges that were failing and they were closing the markets or they were just disappearing. This problem doesn't exist anymore.
00:31:47.190 - 00:32:56.046, Speaker C: If you are using proper tools, there are products that allow you to exchange stuff on chain without like, there is of course a risk, the protocol risk that something will fail or the whole blockchain will disappear. But it's like significantly less risk than using a centralized exchange. And you can also compose stuff that utilizes these exchanges and perform some automatic operations. I won't dive deep into the decentralized exchange kind of topic because we'll have a presentation from Alex and he will explain everything. There is yield farming, which is like a very trendy topic these days. So I wanted to mention it and more or less explain what it's all about. Because probably if you are completely new to deFi, then you probably haven't heard about it, that's fine.
00:32:56.046 - 00:34:07.662, Speaker C: But if you are not new to deFi, then you probably heard that. So what it is, we had this simple compound example, right? There was someone with some amount of dai tokens which were located to the compound pool. The C DaI were issued and this depositor was earning some yield on top of that. So this is the simplest form of yield farming, right? It's not very sophisticated, but it is one. And let's stick to the compound. So, because actually, compound probably was the first one to create a product that that created the term of yield farming because they started adding a comp token. So the active users of the compost protocol were allowed to claim some small amount of comp token.
00:34:07.662 - 00:35:17.706, Speaker C: Comp is like an internal compound governance token which empowers you to take decisions about the future of the protocol and what happened. Apparently, the comp token was so valuable that it was okay for you to not only deposit your dies into the pool, earn some interest on your dies, and also earn the comp tokens. Actually, it was profitable for you to deposit dies and borrow eth, then deposit this eth again into the pool, not repay it, just deposit again. So you have more deposit, right? Actually, this deposit is losing value because you're both lending and borrowing at the same time. You cannot profit from that. But this small amount of cop tokens was compensating that, and it was worth it. And then you have borrowing power from the c ether that you have.
00:35:17.706 - 00:35:59.654, Speaker C: So you borrow more die, and then you convert it to the c tokens again, and you again borrow more comp. You acquire more comp. And apparently that was pretty scary moment because lots of people were thinking that it's going to blow up and there's going to be disaster. But there was nothing like that. It's not that profitable anymore. However, it's still like using compound is profitable, but these crazy things are not that profitable anymore. And that's how it was all proceeding, let's say.
00:35:59.654 - 00:37:22.162, Speaker C: And now all different protocols are also having their own token, which is used for something, and that's supposed to bring value to their holders so people can actually do something interesting. And here we can ask a question about the comp token itself. Like what is it for? Right? Because it shouldn't have any value at the first glance, right? Because ether is a cryptocurrency. Some people are even at this point of time still asking questions whether cryptocurrencies have value at all. So that's one thing, then we have these dice, and if we consider ether to be valuable, then probably we should also honor dies and their value. But what is a comp token? Yeah, apparently there is this powerful governance thing which actually makes defi really decentralized. So whether anyone wants to change anything in the compound protocol, people that hold comp token decide whether this is a good option or not, and they vote whether they want this improvement to go live or not.
00:37:22.162 - 00:39:04.578, Speaker C: And that's essential because there is like no central authority. Of course not every project is starting from this point. This is when the projects evolve and develop. They are moving towards this decentralization. And they start probably with an owner, but then at some point they gain some traction, they gain some group of dedicated users, they have a community, and then this community actually governs the protocol. And that's very important because how do we know that these random people from across the Internet will know what's good for the protocol, right? Or will have good intentions, right? Because we are actually now, for example, the creators of compound actually passed the ownership of their child, of their company, to random people across the Internet who can do anything. Why would they act in a way the compound foundation wants? Because by holding this token, they expose themselves to the success of the compound, right? So the value of the comp token will probably go up if the compound is doing well, if compound is successful, if it's aggregating a lot of fees, if it's just prospering and will decrease in value if compound is not doing okay.
00:39:04.578 - 00:40:12.200, Speaker C: That's a similar thing to the MKR token, for example. These holders of this token are really interested in the protocol doing well, so we actually have a system of really healthy incentives for random people from all across the world to cooperate and to democratically, to democratically make solid, reasonable decision. And here is no place for populism or pure politics. It's pure meritocracy, where the facts and the best ideas are the ones that are picked. And these decentralized protocols are actually doing extraordinarily well. Right? And there are like plenty of other things. There are nfcs, which are digital art.
00:40:12.200 - 00:41:17.290, Speaker C: So you can have a unique object like piece of art or anything else. You can put it on a blockchain and you can put it up for sale. There are options, because I'm now leaning towards the end, actually, at this point, if you have any questions, you can start thinking about them because there's going to be A-Q-A session at the end. So there are options. So fancy things, fancy instruments for the pro traders, pro investors, there are indexes. So for the less pro investors, if you don't want to pick any one particular token, you can buy sort of an ETF which aggregates a lot of tokens inside and for example allows you to buy a whole sector, not only like a particular one random cryptocurrency that's going to succeed or not, you can just spread the risk. There are insurance protocols that allow you to buy insurance for your smart contract investment.
00:41:17.290 - 00:42:17.642, Speaker C: So for example, when there is a bug in smart contract which happens, then you can get some sort of refund from this, from this protocol. And actually that's very fresh situation because there was some sort of an attack on one of the protocols recently and the insurance went extraordinarily well and people that were using it actually took no loss because they were just insured. There are plenty of other things. I think it's not a bold statement if I say that here on Ethereum blockchain mostly I don't want to exclude other blockchains, but I'm mostly focused on Ethereum blockchain. It's the closest to my heart. We have sort of Internet funding arising. Ethereum is not a product itself.
00:42:17.642 - 00:43:12.558, Speaker C: It's even probably not a platform. It's like a transact medium that allows new creators, new inventors, new startups to build all sorts of new things on top of what's already existing. And I think it's really exciting and I think it's really worth learning and it's really worth building. And yeah, I hope that you got interested and I hope that you're going to decide to learn more because here what we saw was just like a tip of the iceberg. It's just like the first sip from the very tall glass of Defi. And I recommend you to deep diver to dive deeper. Okay, thank you.
00:43:12.558 - 00:43:20.760, Speaker C: Thank you for your attention. And if you have any questions, then I will be really happy to answer them. It.
00:43:48.330 - 00:43:57.094, Speaker B: Great to see you. Let's wait and see if we have any questions. Let's give it a couple moments. Here comes the first one.
00:43:57.212 - 00:43:59.640, Speaker C: Okay, I see the first one.
00:44:01.050 - 00:44:03.046, Speaker B: I'm going to read the questions and you're going to answer.
00:44:03.148 - 00:44:04.246, Speaker A: How does that.
00:44:04.428 - 00:44:41.750, Speaker C: Okay, so does maker have a plan to create tokens pegged to other fiat currencies or other assets? Example, gold? I'm not aware of such plans. Of course. Probably the people from Maker foundation would be the best to answer. But what I noticed that there are plenty of other products that issue other fiat currencies. We have at least two types. Two separate synthetic euros. On Ethereum blockchain.
00:44:41.750 - 00:45:17.780, Speaker C: There is trust token company which issues through Kong dollar, australian dollar, canadian dollar. There are probably more to be found on the synthetics. When it comes to maker, I'm not aware, but there are plenty of other products that do that. And gold is also available, at least in two different flavors because I've seen it. If it's maker, I'm not sure, but definitely this is something that's present.
00:45:20.630 - 00:45:53.082, Speaker B: I think definitely more than two gold stable coins. Plenty. I heard the rumors that maker is indeed planning more currencies in the future, but that is not official information by any standards, by any means. I think we have at least one more question. Let's see if it's coming. If it's not showing here, I'm going to read it. I.
00:45:53.082 - 00:46:03.550, Speaker B: It was asked by David Thak on Facebook, can I use compound governance protocol to govern my dao?
00:46:05.430 - 00:47:06.578, Speaker C: So it depends. What's the question exactly about? Because I can see at least two ways to answer that. So, for example, what you can do, you probably can fork the compound governance smart contracts and implement systems similar to theirs. Because it's open source, it of course has some sort of license, but it's public to some limitation, and you can implement mechanisms that will work similarly. That's one approach. The other, if you're, for example, creating some compound related product, you can create smart contracts in a way that holders of the comp token will not only be able to govern the compound protocol, but also your protocol. Yeah, I think I don't know how to approach this in a different way.
00:47:06.578 - 00:47:49.986, Speaker C: Maybe I'm going to read it again just to make sure, generally, if we are talking purely about the protocol itself, which is like basic primitives and basic mechanics and the smart contract design and architecture, et cetera, I think that you can utilize these patterns in your project as well, and it might work. Of course, you need to probably first have a community and find a way to distribute these tokens, et cetera. This is the hardest part. I think that creating the protocol is probably the easiest. At the end of the day, we.
00:47:50.008 - 00:47:58.418, Speaker B: Have one more question coming. Again, I think there's going to be. I think we have more questions coming, so let's take this one first.
00:47:58.584 - 00:49:08.042, Speaker C: Okay? Yeah. So do you think we'll see financial nfps in the near future and what it will do? Yeah, I was actually brainstorming this topic some time ago. I think that we will see more NFT use cases coming. So right now they're almost exclusively collectibles and digital art, which is like probably for a very narrow audience, and not everyone wants to get involved into that. But I think that there are plenty of usages and use cases for nfts which are not related to any sort of art. For example, at this point, some transactions on synthetics that are not atomic and that do not complete within one transaction mint you an NFT, and this NFT then allows you to claim the result of that transaction. So that's one thing.
00:49:08.042 - 00:49:59.414, Speaker C: The other is, I think that we will probably see some sort of ownership proxy created with NFTs in the future. Right? Because right now there is like one owner of a maker vault, for example. And I think that in the future we will see an ownership of a maker vault as an NFT. And then you can, for example, pass this ownership of maker vault to anyone else, or you can pass it to the protocol and you can actually build on top of that. Also there is alpha Homora, which allows you to create leveraged yield farming positions. And they are all unique because you cannot participate in alpha Homora in very kind of like crowd sale type of things. So it's not like one pool.
00:49:59.414 - 00:50:35.400, Speaker C: Every position is unique and everyone needs to create and maintain own position similarly to the maker vault. So I think that this position also shouldn't be owned by addresses. Probably they should be some sort of nfts. And I think that a lot more are coming. Like anything that is non fungible in a very high level way will be tokenized at some point. I don't know if that answers the question, I hope. Yes.
00:50:35.400 - 00:50:57.374, Speaker C: If you want me to leak some real alpha, then I'm afraid I don't have killer up ideas for nfts at this point, but I think they will be seen in a lot of projects and they will be very useful in the future.
00:50:57.492 - 00:51:09.940, Speaker B: I think we have few more questions. Let's take one more and push all the other questions to the networking at the very end. So let's see if we can see the next question.
00:51:11.270 - 00:51:17.342, Speaker C: So we can take two. No, just here waiting to start his presentation.
00:51:17.406 - 00:52:01.390, Speaker B: So let's generate a delay. I think the other question was on discord. And thank you for introduction to Defi. Could you tell us a little bit more about real use cases? We are a company that is purchasing insurance claim with a fiat currency, and we would like to explore where Defi could be potential for financing this instrument. So real use cases, real insurance claim that is bought with fiat currency. And what are the possibilities in terms of defi being a way of financing real life insurance claims?
00:52:01.470 - 00:53:07.670, Speaker C: Okay, so that's a tough one. So that of course, I think depends on the level of decentralization that you want to have in your product at the first place. Because probably if there's going to be one central authority that's going to, for example, decide whether the claim is rightful or not, then I'm not sure if it's going to be like a perfect fit for a decentralized solution. But generally I think that the whole insurance industry as a whole might move to defi at some point. Actually, this is like really complicated question. Yeah, I think it might be worth to take it offline to the networking session because there are plenty of different things. Maybe.
00:53:07.670 - 00:53:31.840, Speaker C: I'm going to finish with a statement that I think it makes sense to move insurance products to Defi, even if they are bought with fiat money at the retail consumer end. But it heavily depends on the exact use case.
00:53:36.130 - 00:54:35.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I think to summarize, I think there are definitely opportunities but that haven't been tried much so far. And that is connecting blockchain virtual space into physical. So that is not that much explored, although we see first loans that are kind of there. So there's, for example, the startup called Trufi that we would know a little bit about, and especially Bardak who was involved in creating this. And the idea is that you have a Dao and there is a voting and the person who is borrowing needs to be approved by the Dow. So it's like one of the first working, I think they actually have tens of millions of dollars already there in the pool. So it's the first working with reasonable capital kind of use case.
00:54:35.730 - 00:55:06.510, Speaker B: But that is a new use case. This is a new thing. This is like two months old. So this is going to be happening this year. So then the question is, are you going to be a frontier? Because if you do, that's perfect. If you want to look at other people actually doing it before doing it yourself, then it might be not perfect timing for you yet. I think we should be ready to introduce the new speaker.
00:55:06.510 - 00:55:42.570, Speaker B: I know there are new questions coming, so please bear with us till the end of the second presentation. We're going to have a networking session and hopefully Bartek will be with us. I'll be there. And I think plenty of other people who know a lot about the space will be there. Perhaps Alex will join us as well. So now let me tell you just a few words about Alex before we connect him. So Alex is a very well known Persona in the Defi and in the blockchain and Ethereum space.
00:55:42.570 - 00:56:28.470, Speaker B: Alex was, I believe he was like fifth, maybe 6th, one of the first employees of Ethereum foundation. Just very early after the ICo happened and the whole thing started to be shaping. Alex was involved in very base projects in Ethereum space. He created blockies of the small icons that you can see either in metamask or in many other applications. That was idea that came from Alex and he created that and he worked on many interesting projects. First wallets. Together with Alex, we were working on unilogging.
00:56:28.470 - 00:57:08.770, Speaker B: And today Alex is working. And I want to mention before the final thing, Alex was involved in white hat hack, when there was a hack in the wallet that led into leaking a lot of money. Alex was there in the room when they hacked those wallets. Take the money and return the money to the holder so that the black hats and the thieves could not utilize the hack to do that. That was a huge event a few years ago. Now today Alex is working for balancer, and Balancer is one of the top Defi projects we have today in the space. They are second to Uniswap and that's pretty much it.
00:57:08.770 - 00:57:34.070, Speaker B: And they have very innovative idea. If Defi space is not innovative idea, if uniswap is not innovative, decentralized exchange, then balancer is even more innovative. And all about that, Alex will tell you just in a moment. So without further ado, I think we can have Alex joining us now. And here comes Alex. Alex, great to see you.
00:57:34.240 - 00:57:36.190, Speaker A: Thanks for the lovely introduction.
00:57:37.010 - 00:57:37.920, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:57:38.530 - 00:58:03.334, Speaker B: Just want to say before you start, it's a great pleasure to have you today. We have a lot of viewers, so it's always a little bit weird in your mouth when you talk to the screen. But just by amount of questions that we have for the first presentation, I think there is plenty of people listening. So without further ado, Alex van I.
00:58:03.372 - 00:58:11.340, Speaker A: Will share my screen. See here. Okay. Can you see it?
00:58:16.270 - 00:58:22.442, Speaker B: Can I proceed? Yeah, everything's fine.
00:58:22.576 - 00:58:26.574, Speaker A: I'm leaving you alone, but I will.
00:58:26.612 - 00:58:29.742, Speaker B: Rejoin if something happens. But I think it's going to be all fine.
00:58:29.876 - 00:58:58.518, Speaker A: Perfect. So this is actually my first presentation about balancer. I joined the project in December last year. So I'm still learning a lot. And during the process of me learning, I always like to try to make them into presentation. So this presentation is a lot, the process of how I learn what balancer is and the point of view of what exactly that is and what attracted me to the project. Right.
00:58:58.518 - 00:59:20.234, Speaker A: So, first of all, this is sugar cane. I'm in Brazil. We have a lot of sugar cane here. And you probably know that if you take sugar cane and you add it to a meal, you get sugar. But the other thing you also get is bagasse. And bagasse is a byproduct of sugarcane. But turns out, and that usually was just discarded.
00:59:20.234 - 00:59:53.258, Speaker A: It turns out that baguette is actually very rich in energy. And you can make it a biodiver out of it. That can be more valuable in some places than sugar. So you can say that cane, if you mute the cane, you get sugar and the gas. But you can also say that, in fact, you get the gas, and a byproduct of it is sugar. In the same way, if you get arbitrage on a curve, you get exchange and liquidity pools. That's sort of like Amm's work.
00:59:53.258 - 01:00:32.734, Speaker A: That's sort of uniswap work. But you can imagine that as the can, maybe. What if I told you liquidity pools, the project is the main product and the exchange is just a byproduct. So what happens? So, first, let's talk about how automatic market maker works, right? So, most automated market makers units up, is the most famous one, is the most used one. They use a constant product function. And that just means there's a curve that there's a constant that is always. If you multiply x by y, there will always be a constant.
01:00:32.734 - 01:01:07.518, Speaker A: So the curve looks something like this. And why does a curve like this magically make the project work? Right. So, first, let's explore the characteristic of what this curve means. So, basically, it means that one is, sorry about the types. I just had a presentation set up and had to change the computer last minute. So all my fonts are messed up. But you can imagine that one of those, the x axis, is the amount of tokens a in a pool, and the other will be the amount of tokens B in a pool.
01:01:07.518 - 01:02:30.310, Speaker A: An interesting thing is uniswap or nemm, they actually don't know anything about the prices. All the information they have to work is the amount of tokens they have in a pool. And whenever you move and you add more tokens in the pool in one side, the ball simply moves on that direction, right? And you can imagine the way you can think of it, of course, the exact formula is you actually get the delta of those two. But you can imagine as if you're getting the amount, it's sort of similar to getting the amount of tokens similar to that, right? So as you move the pool on that direction, now you're getting more green tokens than the blue tokens. And if you move it in the other direction, I will get more blue tokens and the green tokens until it reaches some equilibrium. But why exactly does it work that that equilibrium always be the same prices? And not only you reach an equilibrium where you have same prices, but you reach an equilibrium where the liquidity pool always will have the same amount of value in the pool. Which is interesting, because unisapp, again, uniswap, doesn't know what is the price of the pool.
01:02:30.310 - 01:02:59.142, Speaker A: It just happens that every liquidity pool will have an equal amount of ether, an equal amount of dai or whatever tokens that is. Right. So if we need to think about. The interesting thing is that actually there's nothing to do with the product function curve. It would work the same way to a curve like this, or a curve like this, or even whatever. A curve like this. It doesn't actually matter which type of curve you use.
01:02:59.142 - 01:03:43.838, Speaker A: It's just that we are using this constant product because it's a practical curve and there are some interesting characteristics about it. But what I want you to think about is the value of tokens in the pool, right? How do we think about what is the value of tokens in the pool? And of course, value is the amount times the price. So you can think of the price as a multiplicator. So if this token a is worth $2, you can imagine it as a multiplication. And then we can simply fold that line. And if the amount of tokens b is 50, like the other tokens were $0.50, think of it as housing.
01:03:43.838 - 01:04:36.158, Speaker A: And then all you need to do is get the half folded it in, right? So this is really the amount. Now you can see that the values, while you had equal amounts of tokens, the values are completely wrong, which means that basically, if you give them tokens b, you get tokens a and it's free money. If you get one dollars of Token B in the pool, you get $4 out of token a, which of course you should. These people are going to go to here. So imagine that as sort of like two vectors. When they are out of equilibrium, people push them in one direction. And the more you push, and the more you put token b and token a, the more they will reach some sort of equilibrium.
01:04:36.158 - 01:05:11.770, Speaker A: I'm doubling one side and half the other side. Imagine it's all happening faster than the price is changing, right, until you reach an equilibrium. And from that point on, you can see now that the green line is bigger than the blue line. So it's going to push it down again to that other point. So I want you to think of Emn not really as mathematics, but really as physics. It's basically, imagine there's a ball on those two points. That's the gravity.
01:05:11.770 - 01:06:15.950, Speaker A: It's going to find the little point where the gravity sort of reaches an equilibrium and it's going to stick there. And because it will stop that, it will stop at a point where value times amount is equal. That's why you get a liquidity pool in which meaning that if you add liquidity to uniswap and you add eater and you add dai, if you add $100 of eater and $100 on die, you always have an equal amount of eater and equal amount of die. And why is this important? It's important because it means that uniswap is used for trading. It was built for trading. And as a byproduct, you get a self balancing portfolio of two tokens. And balancer actually was created almost at the same time as uniswap and in order to create a self balancing portfolio.
01:06:15.950 - 01:07:03.266, Speaker A: And they ended up finding independently in the same solution of one swap, but from the other direction. Meaning balancer creates self balancing portfolios for any number of tokens. And as a byproduct, you get trading. So the idea here is that you can create any sort of self balancing portfolio for a number of tokens. And the traders, the arbitrage people, they will be the ones that will be managing and they will be automatically changing that amount in your portfolio. And why that is important. Right, let's think about sizes of product.
01:07:03.266 - 01:08:09.862, Speaker A: Right now, balancer is at number ten in the typos we just crossed, the 1 billion mark maker has 6 billion av. Five compound, four curve tree subtree. Right. If we think about them visually, it's going to look something like that. If $1 million is just the size of the dot in the eye, then $1 billion is this ball, which is big, and that would be the amount of uniswap, like 3 billion and $5 billion, which means, look, balancer is big, but who is really bigger, right? If you compare it for Robin Hood, which I suppose it's going to go down a little bit now, but last time I checked, they had $20 billion in assets, which, I mean, it's a lot bigger, but even bigger than that would be Berkshire Hathaway. That's mainly. That's just a fund.
01:08:09.996 - 01:08:10.486, Speaker C: Right.
01:08:10.588 - 01:08:47.780, Speaker A: And what they do in the fund is that they have a self balanced portfolio. They keep 10% in cash, 20% in option in this, stock options, 30% in this and that. Right. And usually what they do is they just set up a strategy in the beginning of the year, and they just really follow it. Right? So maybe if you could automate it. Berkshire Hataway is small fish, if you think about it. So this is vanguard, which is not showing, but I think it's $5 trillion.
01:08:47.780 - 01:09:53.970, Speaker A: So, again, this is us. This is home. The pale blue dot, right? This tiny thing there, which represents balancer, is a billion dollars. All those tiny moons there, the little circles, this whole thing that our friends have been talking about, Defi, which we are just like a tiny moon compared to the big stars? That is both of those index funds and those automated etfs. And my point being, we can probably automate that. If you want ethereum to be the future of finance, then we probably can think of, how can we automate Berkshire hardware? Can we just replace every asset manager at language with just a bot, where you set a strategy and you let the bot do everything? And I think that's an interesting proposition. So we can think of pools.
01:09:53.970 - 01:10:15.866, Speaker A: Monitor. Pools are mostly just three things. There's a bunch of assets. There's a strategy, which is a trade curve. You can set really any sort of trade curve that you want. And there's a governance, which, of course, can be done. I'm going to create this pool in the beginning, and it's going to be like the same thing forever.
01:10:15.866 - 01:11:02.830, Speaker A: Right? No, governance is a type of governance, and with just those three things, you can build a lot of different things. My point really is that I see pools as almost a new primitive, new economic primitive that you can build a lot of cool things. And in fact, if you're building things with them, it saves you a lot of time and trouble. So, for instance, you can start with basic pools. Basic pools are what we have right now in monster, which is just you create at the moment up to eight tokens. And you set, I want to have 64 of this, 40% of that. I want to have eight tokens with this distribution.
01:11:02.830 - 01:12:26.966, Speaker A: And then you set up a trading fee and a few other things, and you have like, you can put a million dollars in, or a billion dollars, or one dollars, whatever. And pool always self balance. And it self balances because whenever there is a difference of the size of the pool by people trading in the balancer exchange, which is connected with other exchanges, and there are people running arbitrage bots on it, they will make sure that your pool always go back to where it was. An interesting thing is that instead of paying an asset manager to make sure your money is with the right proportions, what actually is happening that you're being paid to do it? Because whenever someone trades, they pay liquidity fees, and that liquidity fees will go back to the liquidity owners. So it's a great way. Imagine instead of you paying berkshire hard way, you can be paid by just putting your money there, which sort of how it should work, but you can do a lot of other things. So for instance, Pidao is building autonomous index funds and balancer.
01:12:26.966 - 01:13:11.750, Speaker A: They are using a smartphone in their back end. And basically what they do is they help create you a dao. And it's great because balancer is super flexible. You can just plug any sort of ownership on that. And every pool has their own pool tokens, so you can use that pool automatically to be your. To use as voting mechanism, right? So you can imagine a discussion of reinvesting or investing or cash flow or anything as just you trading percentage. You can say, look, we have right now a million dollar, half of it's in ethereum, half of it is in Dai.
01:13:11.750 - 01:14:34.722, Speaker A: And you can say, look, I want to invest $100,000 in this project that's in the size of balancer, which is simply mean. We're going to take a little slice of 1% of the die amount and we are going to convert that in 1% of this redeemable token or this other token that represents somehow your project, right? And the nice thing of this is that. Let's talk about Molokdao. I'm not sure if you have heard of, but Molokdao is a very popular minimum governance Dao, in which idea is that people discuss, people vote, where the money goes, where the money doesn't go. And if you disagree with whatever with discussion at any point, you can simply quit the dow and get the tokens out of it and you're good for it. An interesting thing, by putting that on a smart pool, you get a lot of that automatically. Because the minute you hold a balancer pool token of any pool, it means that you can always trade that you can always burn your tokens and burn your liquidity tokens and then get the tokens themselves.
01:14:34.722 - 01:15:20.938, Speaker A: Right? Another project, Catnip. Catnip became very popular at the end of last year because they try to bring prediction markets. They are building prediction markets on balancer right now and they do a prediction market as simple as uniswap. If you go to their website, it was like, oh, who is going to win this election? You either buy Biden token or you buy a Trump token. And that was it. Right? It was traditional market stripped down to bare minimums. And they are building it on balancer pidao.
01:15:20.938 - 01:16:19.458, Speaker A: Primedao is building liquidity bootstrapping bull balancer. So that's another very interesting thing that's happening. I know there are a lot of people using lbps and I want to explain what they are because I like to think of liquidity bootstrapping as almost the new, it's almost like the new ICO, right? You want to raise money or you want to launch a token. And how do you do it? You probably heard about average dollar cost averaging. Dollar cost averaging, meaning means you have $100, let's say you have $100 and you want to buy $100 in bitcoin, right? Or you have $1,000, you want to buy $1,000 in bitcoin. You could just go there and buy $1,000 in bitcoin. What would happen is that if the price goes up, yeah, luck, you, you got in a nice moment.
01:16:19.458 - 01:17:26.838, Speaker A: But if the price goes down, then you could have bought a lot of bitcoin for cheaper, right? So instead of doing just buying $1,000 in bitcoin, suppose that you buy $100 or $10 every day, or one dollars every day until you get every month, every week you buy a little bit of bitcoin. What's going to happen is in the end, when you get $1,000, you're going to be exposed basically to the average moving price of bitcoin. When bitcoin was going down, you bought more of it. When bitcoin was going up, you bought less of it. But in the end of the day, in the end of the period, you have bought $1,000 in bitcoin, probably at a much better price than if you had randomly picking picked any moment. So, liquidity bootstrapping tool does that, pool does that. But if a pool that you set to automatically change the amount so it starts, let's say, 99% f and 1%, a new token, right? It can be EI.
01:17:26.838 - 01:18:24.782, Speaker A: It stores an 80% of e or a very popular token, and it stores as a 1% of one token. Suppose one token doesn't have really a lot of liquidity in it, so you don't even know what is the correct price that this token should have. The cool thing is that if you start a pool with a million dollars of die or eater on it, or of course, these million dollars can be by multiple people. I'm not saying need a billionaire to do that. The point is that the pool will start with a tiny percentage of that, of the token, which the market will sort of try to figure out what is the correct price of that token. And then the next day it will be 2%, and the next day it will be 3%. The next day will be 4%.
01:18:24.782 - 01:19:16.534, Speaker A: What's going to happen is, while the market is still trying to figure out what amount of tokens, what is the value of that token, you're starting to give it more and more and more liquidity until by the end of it, you basically sold oil eater. You bought that token at the price that you helped discover. So the advantage of that is that, first of all, you don't know the market price of a token. And that can work with any market price of the token, right? Because it's always at, let's say at this week it's going to be a 5%. It's going to sell or buy more token. Suddenly the token price goes up or down your pool. Buy and sell ether, buy ether, sell the token.
01:19:16.534 - 01:20:18.146, Speaker A: Buy the token on sell ether to always have 5%, right? So the pool is sort of absorbing, it's absorbing the changes in the token. By the end of it, you get great liquidity for a token. So advantages number one for people buying this token, it allows you to buy a token that you don't know the price without being exposed too much, exposed to price variance. You're going to be basically buying that token over a week or two weeks or a month, depending on the liquidity bootstrapping event for the token launchers. It's great because they are helping the market figure out, and by the end of the event, they will have a huge liquidity for that token. And now it's harder to move the market around. So the goal here, that's all happening in Baltimore right now.
01:20:18.146 - 01:21:55.466, Speaker A: But right now we are really working on v two. And what v two does is interesting. First of all, we are really focusing on making it gas efficiency. The way that every automatic market maker works right now is that every pool holds their own tokens and you plug in the curve and it's one contract, right? What we are doing is that instead of adding all that logic in the same contract, we are working with a very secure and super audited contract that it's going to hold all the tokens and you connect emms into it, right? And it's fantastic because you can create any sort of emm you want and just plug it in and say this is how much token, like, this is how you trade tokens and then you can add tokens through it. Another super advantage of that is that when you do multiple token trades, when you do arbitrage, it's actually a lot more gas efficient. Because first of all, let's say you have like three or four pools, and you figure out if you exchange token a in that pool, token b in that pool, and token c in that other pool, you get one die arbitrage per arbitrage. If you want to do that in amm right now, you need to have all those tokens and you need to execute all those buy and sell, you need to buy and sell those tokens constantly in all those pools.
01:21:55.466 - 01:22:42.430, Speaker A: So you spend a lot of tokens. If you doing that in balancer v two just means that you're going to send the information of all the trades that you want to do and it's going to just execute on chain the net result. Right in the end of the transaction, all the tokens that will move is the tokens are the net result. So what could happen is, in fact you could get an arbitration profit without even having any tokens. How cool is that? You will never put any tokens in. You just realize that if you trade with a, with B, with c, with D, you get per profit out of it. So it's good for gas efficiency and it's also good because it increases liquidity in our pools overall.
01:22:42.430 - 01:23:39.330, Speaker A: Another cool thing. Oh, I just explained both things at the same time. Right? Yeah. So this is the idea that before we had two sort of pools, and then it allows you to have really any highly customizable logic, any customizable logic, because the project curve finance is really launched. Interesting. One of the things that they do is that they have a very different curve for stable tokens that you have for normal variable tokens. So if you have a pool of USDC and Dai and teeter, you can have a very different type of curve than you would have with, let's say, eater and bitcoin and baker.
01:23:39.330 - 01:25:01.050, Speaker A: And the final thing I think that sort of like blows my mind is capital efficiency. When you put 1000 tokens in the Dow in the vault, right? You probably only a tiny percent of those is going to be used in trading. Most of them are going to just be sitting there on the vault. And with the new token, with the new v two, we have this concept of an asset manager where you can set a contract, you automatically pull those tokens, add them to a lending protocol, which is, let's say like compound or something like that, and then bring them back as you need it. So it's almost as you have $1,000 there, and you realize that you only trade an average $100 per day, or maybe $50 per day. You only need to have like $100 in that actually queue, live in the pool. And as those tokens get traded out, then you bring them out from compound or any lending platform, which is fantastic, because now you can keep your pool.
01:25:01.050 - 01:26:01.966, Speaker A: You don't need to choose, oh, I have one die. Should I put it in compound or curve or balance or this or that? You can actually put it in multiple places at the same time. And before you say, oh, that doesn't mean that you don't have the collateral, right? No trade will actually be taken place unless the collateral is actually there and exists. Right. And if I try to make a big trade with a given pool and it doesn't have that, we not even send that trade to that guy because that transaction will fail. So my bigger point is, Balancer is really for builders. We want to build a project and we are building an app, and we are excited about building an app.
01:26:01.966 - 01:26:37.434, Speaker A: But really what we want is to build something that other people can build on top of. In this universe of money Legos, we are launching this new little customizable piece that can connect a lot of other things. And it's a very powerful piece. And you can build a lot of new things in this money Lego. And you can learn a lot more about balancer by going to balancer finance or balancer or Twitter at Balancer Labs. And we're hiring. So if you're excited about this.
01:26:37.434 - 01:27:08.600, Speaker A: If you're excited about working on the future of money, Legos and being a part of this DeFi resolution, we are just shoot an email right now. We are looking for all sorts of positions on Ui, on front end, on back end. So if you have any sort of interest in that space, just shoot us an email and we'll be happy to talk. And that is the talk. Thank you.
01:27:15.450 - 01:27:31.500, Speaker B: And we're back. Thank you for a great presentation. Alex. That was pretty fast. I think there might be some questions. I think we have at least one question here. I'm going to read it in a moment, but I will wait for the question to show up.
01:27:31.500 - 01:27:46.560, Speaker B: Matawish is able to. It was 30 minutes, so the time was good. Okay, I'll start reading the question. Okay, here comes.
01:27:47.490 - 01:28:28.250, Speaker A: Yes. Will balancer be available on second layer? We are working on that. We are looking at that. So one interesting thing on that change that I mentioned on balancer, that very cool thing is that we are making our contract, a very basic quarter contract that you can plug in, plug in a lot of other things. Right. So as soon as we want to move to, anyone can actually create a pool that is just pointing out to a second layer. And we are also looking at roll ups and Vicky sync and all of those technologies that will create this own pool that will connect you to the second layer.
01:28:28.250 - 01:28:47.620, Speaker A: So yes, we are looking at L2. We haven't seen any solution that we truly believe in and we are sort of like skeptical of solutions that run their own chain. We are very excited about those that are basically rolling up into ethereum chain. So we are waiting for that.
01:28:48.230 - 01:29:23.230, Speaker B: I will just add a couple of words of explanation because not everyone might know what l two is yet. L two are scalability solutions for blockchain that are just emerging right now. There was really nothing working just half a year ago and now there is at least a few. And in a month we're going to have a meeting exactly about L2 solutions. So everything going to be explained and I think it's time for the next question. Let's see if our studio. Okay, very nice.
01:29:23.230 - 01:29:25.710, Speaker B: By pr with exposition.
01:29:28.450 - 01:29:36.740, Speaker A: That's a vibrazio hashtag. I'm not sure what he's talking about.
01:29:37.110 - 01:29:48.520, Speaker B: Let me read the question first then. Why is people designed to be unusable after any liquidity is no more than there and I can't even be added back.
01:29:50.190 - 01:30:17.060, Speaker A: So I hope that the bug that you found somewhere, if you're having any trouble adding query to a pool or feel free to share, to jump into our discord. We have a discord. We have a black. And I would love to hear more about. Maybe we can try to figure out what the problem is that you're having. I'm not sure what you're talking about. Sorry.
01:30:17.590 - 01:30:23.646, Speaker B: Yeah, we're going to have networking. Alex, will you have a little bit more time to stay with us on networking session?
01:30:23.838 - 01:30:25.826, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. Awesome.
01:30:25.928 - 01:30:52.786, Speaker B: So let's take it there. Let's see if we have more questions. I think we still have time for two or more questions. Okay, I can read one. I'm not sure. It's not showing up here. In a classical governed portfolio, you have exposure to different assets and rebalance, let's say every half a year, some assets perform better and some worse won't.
01:30:52.786 - 01:31:14.898, Speaker B: Too short feedback loop and too frequent. Getting rid of well performing assets caused too much impermanent loss. Yeah. So the question is if we're going to rebalance too often. Yeah. Then impermanent loss. Did we explain what impermanent loss is?
01:31:14.984 - 01:32:01.810, Speaker A: I didn't explain what impermanent loss is. The reason is that I haven't still found a great solution, a great way to explain it. But the short version of this, because of the way that emms work slowly, as asset prices just diverge. And that doesn't really. Some people call it divergence loss, which I think is interesting, meaning that when prices sort of diverge, the amount of value that you get by holding a token of that pool is a little bit less than just, say, holding that pool. Right. So let's say you have a pool which is 50% eater, 50% die, right.
01:32:01.810 - 01:32:41.838, Speaker A: And then you bought it when eater was like $500. Now eater is $1,000. Right. The amount of money, the value of that pool will not be the same as if you had just kept half eater, or if you had just held one eater and one die back then. Right. It's always going to diverge and usually the way that is usually compensated by trading fee. Right.
01:32:41.838 - 01:33:22.890, Speaker A: So the more people are trading, the more basically they get that back. Permanent loss or diverge loss will sort of disappear if the tokens come back to the original price that you bought. So impermanent loss depends on when you bought an asset or what the market conditions were. They are always better. And it's usually like there's a trade off. If the pool has enough liquidity of trading, you get that back. So an interesting thing is that it doesn't depend on how often you trade.
01:33:22.890 - 01:33:49.700, Speaker A: We don't rebalance pools. Pools are rebalanced every time someone buys one token or buys the other token in our exchange, then they are rebalancing almost like every pool that they touch. Right. And in permanent loss, it doesn't depend on how often you rebalance. It just depends on what price you bought a token and what price tokens are right now. Well.
01:33:53.110 - 01:34:49.266, Speaker B: Okay, there is one more I just want to add about impairment loss that it is tricky to understand. It is a little bit tricky to understand, but important part is that if the value of the assets change, so let's say ether is getting more expensive versus dollar, then there is some loss to those who provided liquidity. But if they came back to the same price, the loss is effectively you get the money back. So this is a little bit unintuitive at the beginning. I propose we do one more question, the one that we see here, and then we can go to networking. So, question about scalability and expansion plans. What are the main challenges and constraints you see to overcome large fins, defis or fintechs? Large fins.
01:34:49.266 - 01:34:52.700, Speaker B: And to start talking about small mid wealth management companies.
01:34:55.070 - 01:35:29.774, Speaker A: If I understand. It's basically how do we get out of this defi and human bubble, and how do we start tackling on getting actual finance people right. I think there is a lot of that that is about scalability right now. It's just very expensive to do it. There's a lot of it that is about UI, and that's the part where I'm more excited about. That's the part where I'm working directly on it. So one of the things that attracted me into balancer is that I really dislike their current website and toolings.
01:35:29.774 - 01:36:10.020, Speaker A: Right, I see they're great projects, but their current site is a little bit confusing because if you actually go balancer site, you don't actually discover any of those things I've been talking about, because it sort of looks just like a uniswap clone, but you get into it, you have to click on add liquidity, and then you figure out, oh, there's all those cool things happening here. And then that's sort of where you get into that. I think that's what we're working. So we are working on just improving the UX. So that fun as beautiful, let's say using Robinhood, right. And I hope that we get there.
01:36:11.750 - 01:36:32.978, Speaker B: Wonderful. So let's then point ourselves to networking. So here is a link. You can see it on the screen. HTP beatly zeroxnetwork so we're meeting on Remoca platform. I think it's called Remoca. It says Remoka.
01:36:32.978 - 01:37:05.154, Speaker B: Remoca. Yeah. Remo co. And the platform, you need to go there, you need to connect there. And when you do that, you will need to click on a specific table, and on the table you're going to need to enable your camera and enable your microphone and then we can talk. I think Bartek is already there and myself and Alex is joining any second now. So, yeah, I will stay here for one more minute to make sure you can see the link.
01:37:05.154 - 01:38:14.740, Speaker B: And we're also going to post the link on Facebook and on Twitter and maybe on YouTube as well. Let's see if we can actually do that. So I think Alex is already gone for networking and I'll be with you there as well in just a second. And let me see if it's YouTube as well. I'm just making sure the link is everywhere and then I'm going to leave you and we're going meet again on Remocer. Yeah, the link is there. I think the link is there.
01:38:14.740 - 01:38:21.120, Speaker B: Thank you very much for being with us today and see you on networking event.
