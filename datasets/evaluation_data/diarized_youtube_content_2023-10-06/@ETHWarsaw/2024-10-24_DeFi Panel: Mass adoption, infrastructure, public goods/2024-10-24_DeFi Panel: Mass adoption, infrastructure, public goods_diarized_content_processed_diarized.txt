00:00:04.080 - 00:00:22.113, Speaker A: We have a really exciting panel today. I know some of these people personally. They're really, really cool people. We'll be talking about mass adoption and the infrastructure for public goods. And we all know why we're here. We're all here to make the world a better place, but also make some money in the end because we all have to live at the end of the day.
00:00:22.169 - 00:00:22.765, Speaker B: Right?
00:00:23.465 - 00:00:32.841, Speaker A: So we'll be now introducing all your exciting guests. Today. I'll be introducing Angus from Chronicle. Please come to the stage.
00:00:32.993 - 00:00:33.765, Speaker C: Woo.
00:00:34.465 - 00:00:58.091, Speaker A: We have Artem from Octant. Please come to the stage. We also have Nikolai, the Web3R&D engineer. Please come to the stage. Oh, is that you? Okay. And then we have Jakub, founder of Redstone. And then you have your amazing moderator, Jakub.
00:00:58.091 - 00:01:04.615, Speaker A: Please come to the stage. And I hope you enjoyed this fascinating panel because these are some really smart people. So thank you very much.
00:01:08.195 - 00:01:21.475, Speaker D: One, two. Yeah. Thank you Stas for nice presentation. Happy to be here, guys. How the day was for you so far? Are you okay? Amazing. Awake. Awake.
00:01:21.475 - 00:01:45.819, Speaker D: Because last night was crazy, right? Okay, nice to see you everybody. Hello, guys. A pleasure to be a moderator of this panel. The name of this panel is DeFi panel. With this addition of mass adoption infrastructure, public goods. Okay, so this is what we're going to talk for about next hour. Okay, so guys, pleasure, pleasure to be here.
00:01:45.819 - 00:02:29.155, Speaker D: I'm happy to moderate it. I do represent being crypto, which is a media platform. We are partnering the event. So. So let's start with some of the questions that we going to warm us up. We had some conversations, guys about DeFi, the present state of it, about gates ideas. How can the mass adoption happen? How can people get more comfort, get more adjusted to our ecosystem, web3 blockchain and all beautiful things that are happening.
00:02:29.155 - 00:03:26.825, Speaker D: But there are skirts, there are scared. I've just finished my presentation about missing losing trust in Web3, why people are disappointed, why people are feeling cheated or losing trust basically to us. And it's really hard for them to go back and trust again. So you have your own views, AI from technology, from product development, from beautiful ideas that can change it. So I will like to start with Nicolas. First question would be about this mass adoption. What do you think? Which components, components of defi or generally web3 could help to facilitate, to bring people to our ecosystem, how we can allow this mass adoption to happen.
00:03:26.825 - 00:03:33.905, Speaker D: You talked about onboarding and interface. Could you like start a conversation without telling your insight on this?
00:03:34.725 - 00:04:11.269, Speaker C: Yeah. Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay, thanks for having me. First of all. So basically, I think the main problem with a current mass adoption is the user experience and a lot of painful processes like new users have to go through in order to use Dapps seamlessly. We feel that, like it's been a while since web3 started and basically people who are in the space for a while, they're getting used to manage multiple wallets, multiple accounts, switch networks, deal with like RPCs, chain IDs, etc. But to get the retail into the crypto, I think that's, that's not doable.
00:04:11.269 - 00:04:54.795, Speaker C: Right? Because if I'm using some Web2 app, like I don't have to know if it's like on AWS or GCP or something else. And I think, you know, in crypto we're considering like it's normal, but it isn't. So that's my main take is, you know, we need to make easier and simpler onboarding of retail to the web 3. And they shouldn't know anything except what they actually want to do. Right. So they shouldn't be dealing with like, you know, managing the keys, keeping the seed phrases, et cetera, et cetera, because those are all friction points which are requiring prior knowledge and understanding of some concepts which are definitely not something which everybody should know about.
00:04:56.055 - 00:05:04.155, Speaker D: Okay, thank you guys. Please go on. If you have anything to add to that question or comment, what just Nicolas said, we can open the conversation right now.
00:05:05.785 - 00:06:02.055, Speaker B: I. Hi, everyone. Hi. I sort of agree with that initial aspect. For me, it really boils down to the sort of innate characteristics of crypto, right. Of blockchain technology that effectively is the Rails, that of this is built on, that tokens exist on and that all the value, where all the value effectively lives. And what I mean by that is that you have, you know, these characteristics of like immutability and self custody and all of that is what makes blockchain and crypto so powerful and so new and different.
00:06:02.055 - 00:06:37.185, Speaker B: But it's also the, it's sort of its downfall when it comes to mass adoption and when it comes to the normies, let's say people who haven't taken the time to educate themselves and understand it and understand the real risks of these great opportunities. Right. Because it's sort of a yin and yang thing for me. Right. With great opportunity also comes great risk if you don't know how to manage it properly. So there's a lot to unpack. I think.
00:06:37.185 - 00:07:52.701, Speaker B: Nikolai, was it Nikola or Nikolai? Yeah, what Nikolai was talking about with regards to like the user experience, that's a Big part of it. But we affect, and I'm not going to go into like account abstraction and all the technical things that we can do to fix this, but effectively we do need to abstract away those elements that I just talked about there in some sort of way which makes the whole sort of experience of using crypto and blockchain easy and also like supported, you know, like one of the Great things about Web2 Products and technological products that you can use today is, you know, you can reach out to technical support or customer service if something goes wrong. And generally, you know, they can roll things back or they can help you out or they can fix it. Even with the bank, it's the same situation. Right. And this is sort of part of the issue that we have with crypto is that, you know, again, because of these innate characteristics which are also great opportunities for the right people of self custody and things, immutability, you can't do this. Right.
00:07:52.701 - 00:08:35.877, Speaker B: And I know account abstraction has been talked a lot about a way to get around this. So for me we need to get to a point where we strike a finer balance between the sort of pure characteristics that led to the initial excitement and growth of crypto and blockchain and something that's a bit more consumer friendly. Right. I see those as two opposite ends of the scale. We need to strike a finer balance. I think you've got, you've gotten a number of examples of people going through this now. And I think that's if we talk about where are we in the cycle? I think that's where we are in the cycle.
00:08:35.877 - 00:09:32.691, Speaker B: I think we're at the point now where actually it's really strange and a bit of a struggle. And this is complete conjecture. I mean it's probably not true, but it's just sort of the way I see it is that we're at this point, the cycle now, where we're kind of cannibalizing the original builders, the cypher funks, the people who were here in the early days and got us here to where we are now and by going after the masses, if you like mass adoption. What we're here to talk about right now, we're sort of cannibalizing those, that original crowd, because the needs and the values of both of these two communities don't necessarily align. And a lot of that is related to the technical limitations that I just talked about of this, of cryptocurrencies, right. And blockchain. So you're seeing people go through this.
00:09:32.691 - 00:10:26.335, Speaker B: A good example is around like regulation. So a Lot of stablecoin companies and things. I'm from Chronicle, we're an Oracle provider, we work with a lot of different stablecoins. Some of you all know we were born out of the Makerdao ecosystem. We were originally invented there as the first Oracle to build dai. And DAI is a great example of something recently which, where you're seeing sky, formerly known as Maker, transition their whole ethos and projects and values to something that is more perhaps set up for the future, like more aligned with mass adoption. And that goes on, you know, that goes across every level from the rebrand and making everything more simple and easy to understand.
00:10:26.335 - 00:11:25.407, Speaker B: And yeah, it's sort of. But also the way that they've brought out USDs, this new stablecoin, which is actually more regulatory compliant than DAI, that was sort of the limitation of DAI. And now what you've got is sky sort of sitting in the middle like straddling both of these communities where they're saying, hey, we still got dai, which was going to be pure DAI effectively. And I think that's actually a really good name in a way from Runa, because it speaks to. What I'm sort of explaining here is that DAI is going to be for the purists, DAI is going to be for the cypher funks, DAI is going to be for people who are worried about centralization, who are worried about mutability, people being able to freeze their savings in stablecoins. Because that's sort of the idea with dai. Right.
00:11:25.407 - 00:11:43.035, Speaker B: DAI is immutable. You can't freeze dai. If you make a few million off a meme coin and you put it in die, then you know that's safe. Right. No one can touch it. But if you have it in usdc, even usdt, I think as well they retain the power to freeze that for some reason.
00:11:43.075 - 00:11:43.299, Speaker E: Right.
00:11:43.347 - 00:11:44.251, Speaker B: So it's at risk.
00:11:44.363 - 00:12:10.075, Speaker D: Yep. Angus, thank you for your insight. And I think that finding this sweet spot between the ideals of Web3 and blockchain, of self custody cipher. Thanks. And private keys and between regulations and how can we actually give that responsibility to some third parties. Right. That's the key thing to not jeopardize the ideas of our industry.
00:12:10.075 - 00:12:14.375, Speaker D: Jakub or Alten, do you have any thoughts on that? You would like to continue?
00:12:14.535 - 00:13:13.239, Speaker E: Yeah, I'd like to echo what you just said. I think like the key for me is where we do make trade offs. Right. So I like what you said about account abstraction and I think this is right now a very important level of the development in the space And I think that's the level where we should focus on to bring more users and at the same time make sure that the like the underlying level stays true to its values. And it's like right now what is happening with dai, I'm kind of a little bit concerned about this. I understand what they are doing. They are trying to create mass adoption and actually a month or a couple weeks before they announced sky, there was like a Twitter space between Ava and Makerdao when they were talking about joining forces and kind of announcing the future announcements.
00:13:13.239 - 00:14:40.475, Speaker E: It's not clear for me exactly how they're going to partner, what exactly they're going to do, but it seems that something is coming and sky is the first step. And they also said this and the founder of Mark Makerdao said this phrase on this Twitter space is that we all grow up and we understand that we need to make trade offs and that's true. But also there is like devil in the details, right? Once we have the USDS now and we have this compliant mechanism and we are saying that DAI still stays a part of the ecosystem, how it's going to look like in five years from now, like there is a world where the regulatory framework will say USDA is good, dies bad. I'm not saying this is going to happen, but if there were like this original layer that would stay true to its value, that's going to be immutable, non upgradable, non freezable by an actor, we would be sure that we have the new Rails that are not controlled by the same actor because otherwise we're just replicating the same system on a different technology. And that's kind of my main concern. And I do believe we need to create a good value proposition for the normies for the new people who come on board, but do it on the right level of the technological stack.
00:14:40.595 - 00:14:55.015, Speaker D: Okay, thank you very much. Jakub, you haven't been talking about that. What's your thought about that from more like it perspective? Is it possible from programming that kind of stuff? Or how do you see that? Please comment.
00:14:55.955 - 00:15:39.083, Speaker F: Okay, so let me maybe refer to my co panelists. So I totally agree with the usability. That's something we need to tackle and I think that was like a big step forward is the stable coins and definitely the evolution of stable coins. Like for example, I'm from Redstone, we are an Oracle company so we help to also price stable coins. We work with Etina. That's also an amazing example. Like how can you bring a pretty complex financial Product like arbitrage on options and packaging in a way that let's say like a normal user, mass user can invest into and participate in the yield.
00:15:39.083 - 00:17:06.815, Speaker F: So that was let's say another step of evolution if we can make this complex product actually able to be offered to normal users in the form of stable coins. But also what I'm seeing is the fact that I used to be personally a digital I love like four digit Y. It's like amazing if you can invest in some crazy meme coin and then enjoy this great dealt opportunity. But I think the the capacity and the population of let's say so risk accepting users is limited and we used to work live in this crypto bubble but there are like people who would love to use let's say more traditional product like someone that is representing a tokenized bond with some stability guarantees etc. And we work at Redstone, we are seeing more and more inflow of product that are linked to the real world. So tokenized tbls for example which are like super easy to be bought anywhere in the world and let you park some of the yield gutter from Defi and keep it relatively safe. So I think we'll be seeing more and more real world products that are also reflected in crypto and that are let's say understood and digestible for normal users.
00:17:07.934 - 00:17:49.965, Speaker D: Thank you for that. Talking about usability and the thing that attract people to Web 3.0 or DeFi in particularly is staking. And would you kindly Jacob, continue and tell us how do you see that how staking and restaking things that people actually come get into it to get these yields can be driven forward. What's the future of it in your view? How can we make it sustainable? Right? Those systems that somehow simply collapse under their own weight.
00:17:50.825 - 00:18:50.327, Speaker F: Yeah, I think it's a great question because if you look at the current landscape on Defi, the largest product is liquid staking slido. Basically the third largest is eigenvalue. So they took the ecosystem by storm. And the second largest AAVE got more than 50% of TVL locked in staking or restaking. So basically the vast majority of defect currently is linked to that type of product. And especially restaking is a pretty novel concept and we are still trying to test the water like how sustainable is that? And it's also like an example how crypto becomes much more sophisticated because risk taking is basically like a structured product when you are deploying capital to different AVSs and each AVS got their own risk profile, own slashing condition et cetera. So for example, for us at Redstone it just rises the bar of providing more fine grain data.
00:18:50.327 - 00:19:17.125, Speaker F: Like how can you price a product that is basically a combination of 30 protocols? Like how can you see how risky is it to actually put your money in the LRT when let's say a few percent of that could be slashed. So it's going to be more interesting. Definitely the space of DEFI is progressing but also creates this amazing opportunities to generate more yield from more projects.
00:19:17.665 - 00:19:35.865, Speaker D: Thank you guys. Would you like to comment on staking? Do you still think that this is like a game changer that has been here like two, three, four years ago? Are people still attracted by it or how can you see the future of it in your own perspective?
00:19:39.965 - 00:20:44.871, Speaker E: I think staking is still quite an important part of our infrastructure. I'm from golden foundation, for example. We're using staking to fund public goods and there are more and more protocols like liquid staking protocols appearing on Ethereum and still people doing a lot of staking new projects. I think there is about like web3pi and some other projects that allow people to run staking operations at home. So I think like if we're talking about proof of stake on Ethereum staking mechanism, I think it's the actual, one of the actual mechanisms that generates true value in the system because this capital is used as a collateral to secure the network that then allows everybody to run operations on top of this. So I don't think we're going anywhere from staking right now. But at the same time there is like risks associated with this and especially with liquid staking token and restaking mechanisms.
00:20:44.871 - 00:21:45.875, Speaker E: And it's not like black and white and I think there is a spectrum and it's also requires a lot of expertise to look into where it goes because there is a world where this restaking tokens are put into, let's say not very secure network which risks losing the underlying collateral. Like I'm going now into more like a risk taking part. But I think we need to be careful with this as well to not bring more association with the space with like losing capital and potential risks. Because people already as you mentioned at the beginning, look at the crypto space with a lot of concerns and especially right now I think crypto is one of its lowest points of trust by society. So yeah, trying to stay on the, on the main level and experiment slowly with the new technologies.
00:21:46.755 - 00:21:48.415, Speaker D: Thank you guys.
00:21:49.235 - 00:23:18.185, Speaker B: There's sort of two things that really stand out to me about staking. The first is sort of how does it appeal to, let's call them consumers or users, individual people. And the second is like, how is this technologically beneficial to us as builders? Now, I think from the user's perspective, staking is all about yield, right? I think Jakob just touched on it quite nicely about how the different restaking products and liquid staking products and everything else allows you to create more yield, right? Which is great, but it also creates more complexity. So if we go back to the original point that we discussed is how does this stuff appeal to everyday people, to users, to individuals? Complexity is the opposite of what they want from this sort of thing. If you think about how you're used to getting yield as an individual in Web two, you put money in an account and you get paid an interest rate every month and the interest rate is very transparent. Quite often the banks will tell you ahead of time if they're raising it, if they're lowering it, there's lots of products available. And then depending on risk profile, you can obviously ratchet that up and go from riskier versions of yield, or you can stay with the least risky, which of course is things like interest only bank accounts and things.
00:23:18.185 - 00:24:34.571, Speaker B: So I think from a staking point of view, therefore, the most successful staking opportunities for end users is actually going to be through third parties, like centralized exchanges, right? So where they're able to like put a wrapper around it and sort of offer more protections and more simplicity to the user. Where literally it's just like I think about the Binance Earn program for example, something that I used to be a user of before the UK got attacked by everyone and sort of blocked us from these things based on regulation. And it was so simple for me because, you know, I kept a lot of my assets on a centralized exchange because again, I'm not like a super cipher funk kind of guy. I believe that there's limited risk in keeping assets on large centralized exchanges, although you could argue FTX is a good example of why that's not true. But even that, let's sort of dissect that. Even that decision was based on simplicity. I wanted simplicity.
00:24:34.571 - 00:25:21.765, Speaker B: I wanted to be able to just liquidate in a second if I needed to. I wanted to be able to get yield while I just keep them there in the same place. And I wanted someone else to generate that yield for me, even if that yield was half a percent or 1% less than what I could get elsewhere if I took that under self custody and took on the extra risk and extra complexity myself. So I think the future of staking for users is going to be around these third parties and wrappers as actually centralized entities in it. Which is kind of interesting because staking is obviously supposed to be about decentralization and things. That's not bad for staking and liquid staking and restaking and stuff. All it means is that you're probably going to have fewer entities partaking in it, but with larger amounts of capital or larger amounts of tokens.
00:25:21.765 - 00:26:25.389, Speaker B: Then the second part is about technology and how it sort of enables things. And again, it's sort of got this weird sort of. Not sure what the word is, but it's like it detracts from the original values of staking, right? Which again is supposed to be about decentralization, about distribution. Because basically like liquid staking and restaking is there to enable decentralization in some sort of way, right? Like it allows you to strap decentralization so that you know your protocol, your app, whatever that's based on some form of like consensus mechanism can, can like effectively, like spin up decentralization very quickly, like spin up a decentralized node system or a decentralized governance system or whatever very quickly. But then so many of these protocols and apps. Let's take Oracles for example. There's a number of Oracles exploring this.
00:26:25.389 - 00:28:03.285, Speaker B: I think actually Redstone are exploring this where they want to use liquid restaking as a way to bootstrap node decentralization. Node decentralization is really, really important for Oracle networks because it means that effectively you can't just report whatever you want as an Oracle network and obviously therefore potentially manipulate what the value is that the Oracle reports. But whether it's Oracles or another form of protocol plugging in, this sort of like liquid restaking technological solution to bootstrap decentralization only really works if the rest of the protocol is also decentralized, right? Because at some point there is some point of centralization in there, some weakness, some bottleneck which can be exploited either by the company itself, which in most cases is obvious, like not in their interest to do. But then it's the question of what happens if the company's ops operations, you know, get, get violated, right? Get, get hacked. Then it's like the hacker is in control of the company and the company can then do so. Decentralization, really at its heart as a technological solution, is supposed to be about protecting users, companies, everyone from that eventuality. But really the truth is that so many people just use it as a marketing tool, right? To say, oh look, we're decentralized now because we're using this liquid restaking or whatever else when really if you dig into the protocol and you dig into the rest of the stack, you're like oh no wait, there's point centralization here and here and here.
00:28:03.285 - 00:28:26.039, Speaker B: And actually only like this top part of the stack is decentralized, but you go further down and there's always a weakness in there somewhere. So as a technological solution restaking, we need to get to a point where it is actually employed across every layer of the stack if we want to really achieve what it's there to do, in my opinion.
00:28:26.127 - 00:28:32.799, Speaker D: Thank you very much. Nicolas, would you like to add to staking anything? Can we go on to another question?
00:28:32.927 - 00:29:12.127, Speaker C: I can basically just add a quick thing. I agree with most of the things being said. My main thought here is that we need like, you know, users are going to always go where there is the biggest yield and right. That's what everybody's searching for. And I think in a way like, you know, liquid staking is attractive, but definitely not attractive enough in terms of like there are much higher yield opportunities right now in the, in the web 3. Of course usually the bigger yield is the bigger is the risk, which is kind of which I feel crypto people are like used to go very high risk unfortunately and don't think much about the assets. But.
00:29:12.127 - 00:29:54.521, Speaker C: But interesting angle I wanted to mention which is basically adding on top of the staking is what was mentioned with the tax experience is I feel that people need still to get to an easier way to manage their assets and make sure all their idle capital is basically placed somewhere else to generate additional yield, which is another kind of concern and basically an opportunity as well. I see in the web3 which we can build on and deliver solutions where basically we can make sure that users capital is always efficient rather than just being idle for certain reasons.
00:29:54.713 - 00:30:32.759, Speaker D: Perfect. Thank you guys. We will talk about staking and how can individual users benefit? The easier the user experience is, the better. We talked about that simplicity, that that is a key to introduce it to the masses. Right. But let's wrap our heads around an idea that maybe we as a sector as DeFi Web3 can serve to a higher purpose and through that also gain visibility. You Artem, you mentioned that some of these yields or some mechanisms can be used for public goods.
00:30:32.759 - 00:30:54.725, Speaker D: Right? I know that you talked about that during your presentation. Could you give us your like small overview? How can a public life benefit not just us individuals, but how can we drive that stream of yields or maybe financial products to enhance the public sector.
00:30:56.185 - 00:31:30.495, Speaker E: Yeah. Thank you. So just to like high level overview from Golan foundation, we stick in hundred thousand eth, which is like substantial capital and the yield that is generated from that capital, we not just like take back, but we create a mechanism called Octant. It's a project where we fund public goods. But we not only fund public goods, we also reward users for participating. Participating. Thank you.
00:31:30.495 - 00:32:18.919, Speaker E: Rewards users for participating in the system. And our mission is to balance this. So we are trying to find balance between rewarding users and fund public goods. And so again going back to the level of trust in creating utility and better usability in the system, we believe that blockchain as a technology can serve better people. And we not only can use defi to enrich individuals, which is definitely something that is required. And people, as was said before, usually go for high yield, which is understandable. Also like during my presentation I said this space has a lot of djens, which is not a bad thing.
00:32:18.919 - 00:33:31.273, Speaker E: It's just the results of economical systemic changes that leads people to turn into high risk opportunities to get some returns and like put food on the table or buy a house or start a family. And at the same time like if we just play zero sum games, we're probably not gonna get anywhere. Take into account all the global challenges we're facing right now. And like we all see that and think about whether it's wars or climate change or even like smaller challenges in the space about funding open source software, for example, like Ethereum, as the Ethereum Protocol doesn't have a sustainability mechanism, right. So it's mostly funded by Ethereum foundation or some other foundations or donations and defi protocols as it happens right now, which is great, they can charge a fee and they create the daos and they can fund themselves. So we need to find some kind of common ground how we fund these projects. So there is one of the recipients of file funding, usually they're the top recipient.
00:33:31.273 - 00:34:38.702, Speaker E: They usually receive around 50 or 40 eth every round called Protocol Guild. So Protocol Guild is a product created to fund Ethereum core protocol developer, researchers and qa. And so what we're doing with Octane right now on the next iteration we create on the protocol that will allow different defi protocols, vaults and staking, staking and liquid staking protocols to fund and funnel part of that yield toward Octan Protocol. So it's going to be a mechanism that will allow to take a part of the yield, accumulate in a certain vaults and give the power to the users who contribute to that to choose where it actually goes, what project is going to get funded. But I think the key idea of this project is that the big players like Golem foundation, who have substantial funding, should play a role in this. And that's like what we're doing. We kind of like driving this forward with our big capital and we talk into some other projects that we call dragons.
00:34:38.702 - 00:35:09.649, Speaker E: As I was saying in my presentation, because dragons, they sit on a pile of gold. And we don't think the dragons should just sit on a pile of gold. We think that this capital should be used in a better way. But also most of these dragons who have substantial capital, they want their ecosystems to grow. And one of the good ways to do that is to fund builders, fund public goods projects that can actually create some impact and kick back and reach the ecosystem.
00:35:09.817 - 00:35:34.575, Speaker D: Yes, thank you very much. I believe that a beautiful ideal and maybe a next big narrative that we can build around our sector to attract more people and contribute to the greater good. Gentlemen, any opinions on that? Any comments? Would you like to say to that ideal of getting outside of our own private benefit and go beyond it?
00:35:35.835 - 00:35:37.215, Speaker B: Public goods are good.
00:35:37.675 - 00:35:39.075, Speaker D: Public goods are good. Perfect.
00:35:39.155 - 00:35:39.699, Speaker E: Amen.
00:35:39.787 - 00:35:41.939, Speaker D: Okay. Yes, Jakub.
00:35:42.067 - 00:36:23.805, Speaker F: So congrats to Octant. Obviously it's an amazing idea and I think it's great to build while building a new financial system, not to repeat all of the foundation of the old previous one which was based on the grid only and the efficiency. So the fact that we are sharing something is amazing. So at Redstone for example, we are sharing the data. So all of the data that was ever produced by our Oracle is publicly available, which we heard is stupid because it data over value for some, let's say traders to run models. Because I believe it's like for us it was amazing tool of transparency, accountability. Anyone check how we work, what's the quality, etc.
00:36:23.805 - 00:36:37.385, Speaker F: And if they find it useful to build a new product, that's great. So it worked well. And I think it would be nice to see, let's say more initiative when you share something apart from, let's say consuming value.
00:36:38.765 - 00:37:30.009, Speaker E: I'd like to add one more thing. There is one member of let's say public good space. They wrote an article recently where he compared the budgets of the countries in the world and how much Web3 funded public goods. And the all amount of funding over all time is twice smaller than the smallest country in the world. So just to compare where we are, but there are other verticals that we can look at and one of those verticals is Cost. Right. And if you look at the modern like public goods funding and charity, the cost is extremely high, sometimes like 50% of the money that is coming to charities and mechanisms to fund public goods consumed by those mechanisms themselves.
00:37:30.009 - 00:37:45.145, Speaker E: So the transparency, immutability and lower costs of systems that we're building can potentially allow to bring more value to projects that actually need this. And I believe that's one of the advantages that we have long term.
00:37:45.845 - 00:38:19.645, Speaker D: This is thanks to our technology and skipping many middlemen. Right, perfect. Thank you guys. This basically finishes my set of questions here, but I would like to give a voice to our beautiful audience that we are actually here for you. We got around 15 minutes. Stas, would you help me to spread the microphone? If anybody of you have any question to one or all of our panelists, this is the moment when we can all talk. Go ahead.
00:38:23.985 - 00:38:49.785, Speaker G: Hey, thanks a lot. It was really interesting to listen to your debate. My name is Ferris and I represent Cryptop Malta. It's the crypto community in Malta and we have a lot of, what did you call them? Normies. Like beginners. We try to onboard them and educate them. But looking at the like not recent development but the development of the, let's say past four or five years in the defi space, I really don't know what to tell them anymore.
00:38:49.785 - 00:39:11.021, Speaker G: It's become such a jungle and actually it has become much more complex than it used to be. It's no longer that you just go to AAVE and use one protocol. You stake, you restake, you liquid stake, you get rocked, you like whole exchanges that disappear. There's so much danger. What to tell them? That's my question. What do you suggest? Like to tell those normies, those beginners to start. I don't want to abstract everything away from them.
00:39:11.021 - 00:39:18.065, Speaker G: I want them to be like responsible and have their own private keys. But like how to, how to help them to get started?
00:39:23.005 - 00:40:01.449, Speaker E: I have a question back. You can ask them why they're interested in crypto in the first place. Because like I think like everybody comes to crypto for some reason and if you try to onboard users, if they're interested in a financial product and they're looking into crypto, either they're looking for higher returns, higher yield, or they're looking for new technology. So I guess my suggestion is to understand what they're looking for. And usually like this journey is not just a straight line, there are risks. But it's also very interesting. Maybe some people like interested in building on top of this, creating a business on top of this.
00:40:01.449 - 00:40:07.245, Speaker E: So I guess look exactly what they're looking for and then lead them there.
00:40:08.945 - 00:41:08.719, Speaker C: So basically it's a good question and I don't have exact answer, but I think I have a solution which is something we have to go over and in my opinion it's the things as I mentioned previously, are to spread at the moment and exactly that. Like you don't know where to start, you don't know where to go. If you want to onboard a single user there's a lot of painful processes, especially if it's not a technical person. Right. And I guess we can all agree here that like 99% of the people who are joining crypto are here to make some money. I mean that's a reality and we're thinking and basically my main take of those things is that we need to go towards something which is called more like a chain abstraction and building a layer above everything else where we can abstract not only wallet abstraction is good for some stuff, but definitely not enough still. And our thoughts are going towards more like chain abstraction and that's something which probably will be much easier.
00:41:08.719 - 00:42:33.911, Speaker C: Users should be able to come to a, call it a single UI or a platform where they can see all the yields, all the stuff, maybe some risk assessments of, you know, protocols, etc. But that kind of thing where they get like more, more something like one stop shop for most of the defi stuff rather than being like oh yeah, I like, I mean debunk right now, right? Aggregates your portfolio. So say you use your one wallet like multi chain, you can see where your assets are, but if you want to collect them all, it's, it's painful process. You need like gas stocking on each chain, like cross chain bridges, blah blah blah, which is super painful in my opinion. And exactly these two onboard masses to crypto and even for them to build on, we need to give them more like a tax experience where if you go, we just previously mentioned, if you go to Binance, right, you can just say oh yeah, I want a liquid stake, you know, two bottles and you're in. Or you want to do this, you want to do that. And if you want to go more decentralized approach, which definitely we're all working towards, we need to give more aggregated and abstracted layer to the users so they can get easier to the web 3 which is I still think the main take we need to get towards because I'm a builder and I work with a lot of builders and I usually get a feeling that we are builders and we're building products for the builders.
00:42:33.911 - 00:42:48.297, Speaker C: Right. So usually it's like, who can understand all those concepts, terms, et cetera. I don't think it's easy for like a single person who is. Even from the financial background, who comes, who's going to easily understand. Oh, yeah, this works like that. And understand it. I don't.
00:42:48.297 - 00:43:16.465, Speaker C: And I think that's. That's the main problem. Right. Because we're also getting huge fragmentation right now with, like, builders just building so many things and there is no, like, exactly what you said. It's becoming a jungle and it's super hard to understand new concepts, understand new protocols and see where it goes. So more streamlined process and aggregated, basically aggregated source of all those things will help a lot. Driving towards mass adoption.
00:43:16.465 - 00:43:18.365, Speaker C: Exactly. Which you asked for.
00:43:20.025 - 00:43:22.553, Speaker D: Would you like to answer? Also because we have another question.
00:43:22.609 - 00:43:38.365, Speaker B: So, yeah, just go ahead. One last thing. I'd sort of echo what Nicolai was saying. Firstly, big up Malta. I actually was there last week, my first time, and in Rabat, and it's very beautiful country. If anyone's not been to Malta. I don't work for Malta tourism, but I highly recommend going.
00:43:38.365 - 00:44:24.383, Speaker B: So, yeah, I do think that the way to tackle this is one education. So you're talking about. So is what you do crypto, is it crypto hub crypto, Malta is effectively like an educational community sort of project, right? I think education is really key here because, like, crypto, blockchain, all of this stuff's so complex, right. It's very technological. It's made up of hundreds of thousands of nerds who are some of the smartest brains in the world, right? And they've built some crazy stuff. But if you want to onboard everyday people who are just as. Have just as much right to use this stuff as everyone else, then education is at the heart of it.
00:44:24.383 - 00:45:08.275, Speaker B: And I think it's like everything else you need to fight. Like, for me, what does education mean? Education means like breaking down complex things into a way that makes it easy for people to understand, Right? So it's almost like. I see education as almost like a synonym with translation, right? Like, effective education is effectively translating something into some. Some. Something that people understand. And I think that's the key to onboarding people into crypto is one, like building out a really sort of quite extensive and exhaustive, like, course in a way, like an onboarding course. Like, these are the basics, right? This is what you need to know.
00:45:08.275 - 00:46:02.737, Speaker B: And then pointing them towards some apps or some examples that they can use to Just to get started and not to like rush it and get too deep and like say, right, go on to Uniswap and start trading and like go over here, go on to base and start buying shitcoins with awful names. You know, keep it really simple. This is one of the things that's really great about the industry as of late is that you're seeing. I think you mentioned D Bank as one example. Binance is another of these apps that are becoming available to people which centralize or not centralize but aggregate everything in one place. The most easy to use things, Ledgers is quite a good example as well. With Ledger Live because obviously with Ledger you get the whole like private keys not broadcast thing which gives you that extra security.
00:46:02.737 - 00:46:35.245, Speaker B: But the app itself, the app that you use on your phone gives you just like straight access to like generate yield, buy tokens. You know, these very like basic things where you don't need to be an expert, which you can learn in a few hours really probably I think most people. And then from there start building. Right? Oh, actually I like this. I want to learn more about it. I'm going to read about it a bit more or I'm going to try doing something a bit more advanced. Right, because I, because I made a bit of money off this yield and now actually I want to try buying and selling.
00:46:35.245 - 00:46:42.869, Speaker B: Right. And trading and things. So yeah, I think it's. That's. That would be my like takeaway. Right, perfect.
00:46:42.917 - 00:46:58.945, Speaker D: Let's hope that these recommendations will help Malta community a little bit. You have a question and there's lady in the back having next. Okay, so go ahead. Could you hand her microphone and then she wants to add.
00:47:00.885 - 00:47:48.965, Speaker H: Thank you. Thank you. Hello, I'm Justina, I work at Wolfhaser Labs and I actually we build Volt, FYI and we give those insights regarding Defi project. So I agree with you guys that yeah, education is very, very important in this space and we need more insights and transparent parameters and measurements that we can actually evaluate whether this opportunity is better or the other one. And for example we at Wolfe Labs we built such solution. So we have a dashboard vaults, FYI and you can go there and actually see what are the TVL of any vault, what are the opportunities, what tokens you can use, etc. Etc.
00:47:48.965 - 00:48:40.133, Speaker H: So yeah, totally, I underst. I agree that this is very important but also some of you said that yeah, we need some unified interface that we can use like everything in one place. Because right now the problem is that yeah, fine, cool. You have this opportunity but we@v, FYI, we redirect you to the different protocol page and you need to go there to different app to different UI and you need to understand what's happening there. And the only thing you want to deposit for example your tokens and start earning yield right now and not understanding another protocol. So yeah, this is something that's definitely needed and that's something that we want to build and maybe in the future I can share it with you.
00:48:40.229 - 00:48:49.045, Speaker D: Thank you very much for your comment. I think that after this little panel you can speak privately about the progress. Please, next question.
00:48:49.125 - 00:49:51.443, Speaker I: Yes, hi. Very interesting discussion, especially the point, I like the point about the economy and how it influences on people willing to take more risk. And like currently I'm here with, we're building decentralized trading platforms also decentralized trading platform on chain, on Arbitrum and but our unique approach is that we want to provide advanced risk management to average people. Yeah. And in this aspect we don't allow people to select their own leverage for futures position. And our leverage is based like on risk parameters that lead to your leverage actually being pretty small comparing to like x30 on Binance or something like that. And like my question is will you expect people see this change of like going from YOLO traders to just like responsible traders that yeah.
00:49:51.443 - 00:50:15.795, Speaker I: Want to have research, want to have actually good risk management for their position or it's. You think it's unrealistic in the near future like especially as we see in this cycle meme coins that actually don't have any application just like jeopardizing financial inputs to good projects.
00:50:18.575 - 00:50:59.241, Speaker C: Can I go? Yeah, I mean I think even the current market state is what's happening. It's flushing out the leverage traders mostly. But in my humble opinion like even in web two, right. We were seeing a lot of like a lot of leverage and like time to market traders which is, I think it's always going to exist. And it's another just you know, term and approach people use for trading summer spot traders. Some are definitely you know, going with like you know, 50x100x etc getting liquidated in a second. There is even, there is even a funny phrase which like a couple of months ago Bitcoin was like very stable for a couple of days and there's been a guy who said like, you know, just go 100x leverage and you're going to see how it's not stable at all.
00:50:59.241 - 00:51:51.609, Speaker C: But I think it's organic. That market goes up and down and in my opinion we See now that the whole world economy is prone to a lot of speculations, political stuff, et cetera. So in my opinion there is currently no right risk management in Web3. Even the Web3, Web3 is constantly shaking out with. You can take a look at SM5500 or whatever and even that's like, you know, becoming more, more and more volatile, which is probably the just organic thing which happens. So yeah, I mean that's more or less my take on those, on those things. And I don't think it's going to change, to be honest, because people are always going to, you know, opt in and go like hundred x on dogecoin or something even not understanding what it is.
00:51:51.609 - 00:51:59.275, Speaker C: But you know, they heard it's a good thing and that's the only way they can make like, you know, a big amount with like 100 bucks or something like that.
00:51:59.855 - 00:52:38.535, Speaker B: So my view is that you have different types of products effectively and that's how we need to look at this. And leverage trading is effectively just like a high risk speculative product. Like you can go for the low risk option, which is spot trading, right? Which is just different parts on the scale of the same product. But that's what they are. And therefore like to answer your question, I don't think necessarily like that risk is going to balance out. People are going to get better at taking risk or anything like that. I think people can be educated on the smartest ways to leverage trade, let's say stop losses and things like that.
00:52:38.535 - 00:52:54.889, Speaker B: But I think leverage trading will always be there as that high risk product. Think of it like cars. You buy a Tesla because maybe environmentally conscious, you buy a Lamborghini because you want something fast and loud and flashy.
00:52:54.937 - 00:52:55.145, Speaker D: Right.
00:52:55.185 - 00:53:03.281, Speaker B: Or you just, you know, you buy a Nissan because you just want something that's like stable and you know, low cost.
00:53:03.353 - 00:53:03.537, Speaker D: Right.
00:53:03.561 - 00:53:37.905, Speaker B: But reliable. Notice I didn't pick a ladder there when I said that. So I see like these products as, as the same. Right? Leverage trading is effectively like your super high risk but super high return or super high loss products. Spot trading is your more chill Nissan, Toyota, et cetera, let's say. And I think that'll always be the way, right? That'll always be the case. It won't necessarily depend on the behaviors of the users.
00:53:38.335 - 00:53:41.039, Speaker D: Thank you very much. Altem. You want to do that?
00:53:41.167 - 00:53:56.159, Speaker E: Actually I wanted to ask question back. So you said you kind of create like a suggest to leverage to the user. I wonder how you decide because your business is effectively assessing the risk and then selling the Risk to the user or what kind of algorithm do you use?
00:53:56.207 - 00:54:43.629, Speaker I: Yeah, we have like 100 page white paper with all the calculation what we do. Yeah actually like there is something like a risk parameters we have like cross margin but it's value at risk based so your position actually hedging once again each other. So for example if you are bitcoin long and EC or short they are like colorade. Yeah you effectively will have higher leverage because they correlate and if you are going like bitcoin long is short you will have lower leverage and it's all based on risk parameters. I can't really go into mathematics of that. We have a specific person for that. But yeah, it's all published.
00:54:43.629 - 00:54:47.385, Speaker I: You can read about it if you want. It's cvex.
00:54:48.365 - 00:54:52.909, Speaker E: I wonder what happens if a user gets liquidated. Like do you have insurance for this or.
00:54:52.997 - 00:55:19.055, Speaker I: Yeah, there will be insurance fund and like we are still not in Mainet Mainnet is planted like two months. Yeah we have insurance fund, we have like just normal, I don't know normal properties of every exchange but since its order book is also on chain we have like liquidation bots that will initiate liquidation for your position if needed.
00:55:19.995 - 00:55:35.883, Speaker E: To answer your question, I think there is definitely a demand for high risk opportunities and if your business can really provide I think through like algorithm with additional insurance on top of this, I think they're going to be users especially as the bull market will come at some point.
00:55:35.939 - 00:56:25.517, Speaker I: Yeah, I will just say one thing. When developing this we were thinking that retail people, they will probably want leverage and we were actually thinking about creating this kind of ability to change your leverage but. But in our scenario it would be isolated margin because it doesn't work with war margin and this higher leverage. But we decided that it's not a good idea for traders because as you say they will be easily liquidated. So yeah, we really hope that there will be a change to this kind of more like more responsive responsible traders. But yeah, let's see. Like currently I would say our main focus is like prop traders, institutional traders.
00:56:25.517 - 00:56:43.021, Speaker I: They are coming to this space, they need tools. Like the only good tool right now in the market is DYDX and they are not happy with that. So yeah, I hope that like we will attract whales for sure. Retail probably maybe.
00:56:43.173 - 00:57:20.951, Speaker D: Okay guys, that thumbs up because time's up is actually right now. So perfect ending. If you had any other questions guys please catch our panelists. Once again I want to thank and repeat Jakub Wojciechowski, Nikola Madrajevich sorry for that butchering your name. Artem Braznikov and Angustuki. Give a big round of applause for them. It was my pleasure moderating this panel.
00:57:20.951 - 00:57:23.215, Speaker D: I wish you a great day and season. Thank you.
