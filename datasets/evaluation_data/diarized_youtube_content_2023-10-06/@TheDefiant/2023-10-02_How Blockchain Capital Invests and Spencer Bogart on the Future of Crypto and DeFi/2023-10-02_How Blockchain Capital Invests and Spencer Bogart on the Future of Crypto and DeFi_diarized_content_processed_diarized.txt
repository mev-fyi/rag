00:00:04.650 - 00:00:41.090, Speaker A: Welcome to the Defiant. I'm your host, Tagan Klein. Today we delve deep into the mind of Spencer Bogart, partner at Blockchain Capital, aka the creme della Crypto. Spencer has played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of decentralized technologies and digital assets over the last decade. We get into his journey impact in the blockchain sector her their investment thesis around the controversial world coin and how he's continued to thrive among economic downturn. Many economic downturns. And we get into their recent news, this just in of $580,000,000 for two new funds.
00:00:41.090 - 00:00:44.982, Speaker A: But first, Spencer tells us about the history of the firm.
00:00:45.126 - 00:01:27.346, Speaker B: The firm has definitely been around for a long time. We're actually fortunate enough this year we're celebrating our 10th anniversary. So it's been ten years of solely focused on venture investments in the blockchain industry. It's two of my partners today were amongst the original co founders. That's Bart and Brad Stevens. So they founded the firm a decade ago and really just with a thesis that the industry was going to be much, much larger than it was at the time and that we were going to see it expand far beyond bitcoin into other networks and other types of assets. And they said, listen, instead of just playing from the sidelines and owning some of the assets, we'd like to actually go ahead and invest in a venture firm.
00:01:27.346 - 00:02:14.726, Speaker B: And when they couldn't find one to invest in, they said, let's go ahead and start it. And so they set out, they raised fund one and they actually did something very unconventional, which I'm glad I wasn't there at the time because I don't know if I could have been supportive, which was, let's go launch an asset management business, a venture capital firm that charges no fees. So for the first fund, they charged no fees, no carry nothing, which on the surface is a silly decision. Right? Like, you can't start a business that doesn't make any money. But in hindsight, it was part of their long term vision of let's not focus on trying to maximize on the short term opportunity here. Let's build out a platform that is going to be enduring and be able to capture the upside of the industry over a much longer period of time.
00:02:14.828 - 00:02:20.522, Speaker A: Amazing. And I'm sure that that helped build rapport and relationships. Can you speak to that?
00:02:20.656 - 00:03:06.134, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. For some of the early funds, it was great because a lot of their pitch was really going around to the other founders in the industry. Right. Because there were not even very many family offices or high net worth individuals that were interested in investing in a venture fund that was dabbling in this crazy thing called cryptocurrency. And the firm at the time was actually called cryptocurrency Partners. And so instead, they went to a lot of the early founders, and the pitch was pretty straightforward. It was, hey, listen, what if you're in the right place at the right time, but your company just doesn't make it right? Wouldn't that be so unfortunate? Like, if you go and invest all this time, it's going to be several years in this journey to find out that you were so close and yet so far.
00:03:06.134 - 00:03:25.150, Speaker B: Wouldn't it be great if you could have exposure to some of the other companies in the industry? And it turned out that pitch resonated with a lot of them. And it was a great way to essentially build out a network and really catalyze it early on by having a lot of the earliest founders have a vested interest, not just in blockchain capital, but in each other.
00:03:25.220 - 00:03:25.454, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:25.492 - 00:03:33.182, Speaker B: Because now, all of a sudden, a lot of them owned little tiny pieces of each other's companies, which helped facilitate kind of collaboration and discussion amongst them.
00:03:33.236 - 00:03:46.294, Speaker A: Absolutely. And it shows it pays off to have conviction in the long term and not sacrifice the short term for the long term. And with that, you have big news that just dropped. Can you tell us about the new fund?
00:03:46.412 - 00:04:17.200, Speaker B: Yeah, so we just announced yesterday, or let's see, on Monday the 18th, two new funds totaling 580,000,000 total. And one of the funds is our 6th early stage fund. So that's what we've been doing for the past ten years. This is venture investment in seed stage or series a stage companies. And then we also announced our first opportunity fund. So this is investing in things that are series B or later. So you can think of that as kind of mid to late stage of the market.
00:04:17.200 - 00:04:42.774, Speaker B: And really, our entire thesis there was, when we were looking in the bull market, we imagined a post dislocation vehicle, expecting that market cycles will repeat, and that in that kind of a dislocation, we'd be able to find some very interesting opportunities at that mid stage of the market as a handful of the kind of early stage companies from the last bull run graduated and grew up into that kind of mid stage, the market.
00:04:42.892 - 00:04:49.670, Speaker A: That's very strategic. And what does mid stage look like in the world of crypto? Is that a token that's already kind of launched?
00:04:49.750 - 00:05:33.880, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. So for us, we do investments in both traditional private equity. So these are companies where our eventual exit is via a public offering or an acquisition. And then we also invest in some companies where they might develop a protocol that has a token attached to it. So both of those are possibilities for us. You're right that the labeling on the series can be very fluffy, right? Like, people think of this as a science on the outside, it is 100% more of an art, depending on kind of the label that founders and investors attach to a particular financing. And we can really split hairs in there when we go between a series a extension financing versus a series B.
00:05:33.880 - 00:06:05.054, Speaker B: But for us, we typically think of a series B as a company that has first found product market fit before their series A, and then has demonstrated an ability to kind of scale that into a larger operation and is probably eclipsing, if not 10 million, then $5 million in revenue. Or in the case of a protocol, there could be significant progress in terms of actually developing the protocol, maybe testnet results or other signs of early adoption, like key partnerships or integrations.
00:06:05.182 - 00:06:14.098, Speaker A: Amazing. Super strategic. And what made you all see the crypto industry so early and take such a strong stance on the future?
00:06:14.264 - 00:07:20.422, Speaker B: So let's see. So for Bart and Brad, it was really because they were pretty involved in video game investing early on. So also before it became like a mainstream thing to invest in video games, their major alpha, by the way, fun story is that when the first few video game companies were going public, they're trading on public stock exchanges. People are wondering, what are the results going to be in quarterly earnings? One of their ways to generate Alpha was to get really involved in these games and be playing them aggressively, and especially the games that had in game economies attached to them, because you could really get a sense of whether or not there was a massive uptick in user growth based on kind of some of the economics going on inside of the game. And so then they would parlay that into making bets on whether or not the game company was going to exceed expectations or not. Okay, so you go from video gaming. How does that take you into crypto? So one of the things that they invested in had basically cornered the market on World of Warcraft gold and created a large secondary market for it.
00:07:20.422 - 00:07:54.562, Speaker B: That company wanted to go out and acquire Mount Gox early on because it was already involved in the exchange of these digital assets. They just happened to be kind of trapped inside of this one video game. And so naturally, it was an aha moment when you have something like bitcoin come along and there's an exchange where you don't have the same issues of all these assets being trapped inside of one company. So that came up as a topic of discussion that sent them down the rabbit hole of, wait a minute. If we're going to even talk about acquiring this company, we need to understand it a lot better. We're really very skeptical of this bitcoin thing. We probably want nothing to do with it.
00:07:54.562 - 00:08:16.086, Speaker B: But of course, like any inquisitive investor, when they went down the rabbit hole, they realized that there's something very interesting here. And not just that bitcoin has staying power, but that it was likely to expand into a much more robust ecosystem beyond bitcoin. And so, again, that's kind of the genesis of what led to the formation of blockchain capital.
00:08:16.198 - 00:08:25.818, Speaker A: Amazing. And then you've been through many ups and downs when it comes to the crypto market. What keeps you captivated in this space? What excites you about the crypto industry?
00:08:25.914 - 00:09:09.822, Speaker B: It's probably the pace of innovation. People use this term permissionless, I think, pretty flippantly, but that is the key component that gets me excited about it. When I think about the dynamic for innovation classically, it is hard to predict if we could predict where the next major innovation was. We could just write decrees that said, go build the next big innovation. But that's not how it works. Right? So it's lots of trial and error and it's lots of people tinkering. I like to think of it as, like, if you're going to score a goal in soccer, you have to take shots, right? The more shots on goal, the more likely you are to score a goal, right? And I think of innovation has the same kind of dynamic where it's very uncertain where it's going to come from, but the more people attempting it, the more likely you are to realize the results from it.
00:09:09.822 - 00:09:49.234, Speaker B: So what really captivated me about crypto was this open permissionlessness where all of a sudden anybody can build, right? And when you have this, anyone can build dynamic, it means you're going to get a lot of people trying a lot of crazy things, and a lot of them are going to be awful, right? It's the same dynamic as the Internet, right? Like, anyone can create a website. So what do you know? 99.9% of websites are pure garbage and nobody should ever go to them, and they don't really warrant any kind of attention mentioned. But the 0.1% are incredible, right? Like, these are game changing things. So I think we see the same kind of dynamic in crypto, and it's that overall kind of setup across the ecosystem. That gets me excited about the future growth opportunities.
00:09:49.362 - 00:10:05.194, Speaker A: And let's talk a little bit about fundraising for these funds. So I believe you started at the top of the bull market in 2021. You've now closed, which is no small feat. Tell us, what was it like raising funds during the dramatic 2022 downturn?
00:10:05.322 - 00:10:52.026, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's definitely interesting, and investor appetite definitely ebbs and flows with the market. This is actually a primary reason why we only operate venture funds, and we have resisted the urge to launch a hedge fund, because with those shorter term vehicles, investors love to commit capital near the top of the market, and they want to redeem capital at the bottom of the market. So what does that mean? It means that if you're running a hedge fund and a bunch of new investors give me capital, I need to deploy that right then. And if prices are aggressive, it becomes hard to find opportunities with an attractive risk reward dynamic. And then the flip side is also true. When it's a bear market and prices are down, your investors are typically scared. They're running for the hills, and they're asking for their money back.
00:10:52.026 - 00:11:44.698, Speaker B: That means that you're a forced seller. So even though you're looking at a bunch of your highest conviction opportunities that you've ever seen, you are forced selling into that market. So we have always stuck to doing venture funds because we think it aligns for better return opportunities for our limited partners. Now, of course, the challenge with venture funds is they're long term vehicles, and so you're asking investors to lock up capital for a really long period of time. Now, again, at the beginning of our fundraising process, investor interest was high because the market was hot, and so people were signing up, and that started to dissipate as 2022 came around in Lunatera and then FTX. And so we slowly saw it kind of decline over time. But we're fortunate, and a lot of our limited partners have been with us for multiple funds, and so they're relatively numb to the market cycles.
00:11:44.794 - 00:11:45.054, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:45.092 - 00:12:10.630, Speaker B: So just like most of our team, they've seen this movie before. They've seen the ups and downs, and if anything, when they see a downturn, they're saying, great, this is probably going to be a great time to invest in the industry. And so they want to re up into the funds. But certainly, in all cases, the macro situation and then some of the events within our industry certainly presented headwinds in terms of overall investor interest.
00:12:10.780 - 00:12:19.254, Speaker A: Yeah, understandable. And kind of on that, were you surprised at how overlevered some of the major players were, yes and no.
00:12:19.372 - 00:12:47.506, Speaker B: I think you kind of expected. I mean, this has been part of crypto for a long time, right? I mean, a lot of what brought people in was, for example, Bitmax many years ago and being able to go 20 x 30 x 50 x long on something. And so that dynamic has been there in the industry for a long time. And so on the one hand, it doesn't surprise me, and yet it does, in that every time the industry does get more sophisticated over time.
00:12:47.608 - 00:12:47.922, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:47.976 - 00:13:04.546, Speaker B: And so the question is always how much more and how reckless are some people being? And so, of course, you never know until you go through the full credit cycle. And now we've seen the other side, and it turns out there was a lot more people than I think anybody would have expected that were just really far out in the risk curve.
00:13:04.658 - 00:13:05.126, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:13:05.228 - 00:13:05.446, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:05.468 - 00:13:15.242, Speaker A: It definitely took me by surprise and with, I know we're kind of sick of talking about FTX, but did that surprise you and were you all caught up in that at all?
00:13:15.376 - 00:13:45.826, Speaker B: It did surprise me. So we looked at two different investment opportunities in FTX early on, and we passed on both of them. The reasons were really quite straightforward. It was know there was this idea that we're going to build a better exchange than Coinbase, and the major answer to the questions of how it's going to be better were just, they're going to be better, which is fine. That's just not really something that our investment team would find to be defensible. Right. To just say, I'm going to do it better than what people have already done, without having specific reasons why.
00:13:45.826 - 00:14:23.280, Speaker B: Now, the only real material reason why it might be better was because Alameda had grown to be very significant in terms of overall trading volume and size, and they were going to be captive to FTX. Right. They're saying that we're going to take one of the largest, most active trading desks and it is going to be extremely active on FTX. So the problem, of course, is that it's a conflict of interest. That conflict of interest is ultimately what caused the implosion of know. From a rational standpoint, you have no real reason of why you're going to be better except for this conflict of interest. That's just an easy pass for us.
00:14:23.280 - 00:14:49.254, Speaker B: Of course, it felt like the wrong decision for about three years there, where I was really kicking myself. But even acknowledging the conflict of interest, I did not expect them to implode so miraculously the way that they did. Conflicts of interest exist places you have to be careful of. Them, you want to be mindful of them, you want to avoid them, but it doesn't mean that they always result in this catastrophic event.
00:14:49.372 - 00:15:04.554, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. I remember even when you would fund FTX, you would wire money to Alameda and that was always a little bit interesting. But it's crazy how it kind of unravel and I never thought that stealing client funds would be a part of the equation.
00:15:04.682 - 00:15:16.894, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I wish I could say that we had sussed that out in our due diligence and we just said, you know what, these are some bad apples here and they're going to steal money. But I didn't get that feeling right. I did not get the feeling that this was going to end in fraud and theft.
00:15:17.022 - 00:15:50.860, Speaker D: Looking to grow your community's trust in your project? Explore UNCX network, the home of liquidity locking and secure DFI token services. With over 4000 locks created and a TDL upwards of 200 million, they have a reputation for secure products that developers can rely on. Their services cover most EVM chains and include an ILO launchpad, token vesting, token minting, staking and farms as a service, and the most reputable liquidity lockers on the market.
00:15:51.310 - 00:15:59.406, Speaker A: And let's talk a little bit about the investment thesis around these new funds. What use cases are you most excited about kind of going forward?
00:15:59.588 - 00:17:04.510, Speaker B: So let's see, we probably break. It's actually like this encompasses most of the industry, right? So there are now today some blockchain or crypto venture firms that are specific to one vertical, like maybe just DFI, maybe just kind of consumer social web, three kind of things. It's funny to me to see that, by the way, because when we're raising our early funds, the major pushback from a lot of investors is this is way too narrow of a niche. So now the idea that some people go even more niche, they pick a niche within the niche, makes me laugh and realize how much we've grown since then. But as for blockchain capital, we do have the flexibility to invest across the spectrum of opportunities, tokens, equity, different subsectors of our industry as long as crypto and blockchain related. Now, for us, the question that we typically ask is, is it uniquely enabled by blockchain or crypto? Right. Because there's lots of things, I think we're going to see more of these where yes, there is a blockchain or crypto component, but I have to ask myself, is that at the core of the business? And I don't think every business needs to have blockchain and crypto at the core.
00:17:04.510 - 00:18:06.658, Speaker B: But that's our expertise, right? That is what we can underwrite is when the major piece that's going to decide whether or not this company is a success or not is the crypto component to it. So for us, again, we break this broad industry into six different categories. We do infrastructure, but we break that into decentralized infrastructure and centralized infrastructure. We break finance into DeFI and CFI, and then we have consumer and social, and then we have gaming. So if I go through all of those, centralized finance was probably our biggest, or, sorry, centralized finance and centralized infrastructure was really our two biggest subsectors that we deployed to in our earliest funds, and we will continue to do so where we find the right opportunities. But over time, as certainly evolved or graduated into more of the crypto native or decentralized infrastructure, decentralized finance.
00:18:06.754 - 00:18:12.762, Speaker A: And what's the reason for that? The industry just wasn't ready from a decentralized standpoint, presumably 100%.
00:18:12.816 - 00:18:27.070, Speaker B: We spend a lot of time thinking about sequencing. So if the industry is going where we think it is, which things, which subcategories need to work first to get us there, right? And the centralized infrastructure and the centralized finance is the obvious first answer.
00:18:27.140 - 00:18:27.326, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:27.348 - 00:18:57.826, Speaker B: If you don't get on ramps and off ramps. Correct. If we don't have robust infrastructure, then you can forget about the rest of it right now. As you start to get those things down, then you move into kind of, I think, a greater emphasis on decentralized infrastructure and decentralized, I should just say applications. But I think of DeFi as really the first major category. And so that's kind of how it's gone for us. Probably the next major one that we really hit, like, after the centralized infrastructure and centralized finance is really DFI.
00:18:57.826 - 00:19:47.334, Speaker B: And so we started getting pretty aggressive in DFI, actually about three years too early in 2017. And that was really just looking at the ICOs of 2017 and saying, listen, if you're going to have all of these different assets for all these different applications and need to hold them all to be able to use these applications, which we always thought, by the way, was a funky design model in 2017 of, like, we usually call them friction tokens of, like, you must have this to be able to use the application. That's kind of the opposite of what you want to do to attract users, make it as easy for them to come and use it. Not like you must own some of my stock to use my product. Not that tokens and stock are the same thing. I'm not trying to equate them, I'm trying to equate it from a user dynamic of they need to provide a capital outlay to use an application. Okay.
00:19:47.334 - 00:20:20.142, Speaker B: So if you're going to have all these tokens, then it only makes sense that you're going to have seamless swapping between them. So that takes you to decentralized exchanges. So I think we invested in three different decentralized exchanges back in 2017. And of course, that was just a couple of years too early. And then more recently, I'd say our most active category has been decentralized infrastructure. So that's been things like Eigen layer, matter labs who made ZK sync, and then RISC Zero, which focuses on kind of zero knowledge computation.
00:20:20.286 - 00:20:29.746, Speaker A: Amazing. Love all of those teams. And when you look across the potential deals that you could do, does location matter, or are you more location agnostic?
00:20:29.858 - 00:21:23.762, Speaker B: We're totally agnostic, yeah. I mean, we have teams in most continents, maybe not every continent. Mostly what we do care about is especially to the extent that it's an equity investment, is there a strong rule of law? We're investing where we're investing. Right. Like in that jurisdiction, are property rights going to be respected? And it's actually unique, because when we're investing in a jurisdiction where we're like, property rights are pretty weak here. And by the way, the reason why that matters is because as a venture firm, you have a low probability of success on any investment, and you want to make sure that when the rare opportunity happens, that there's a very successful company that's born out of it, that you actually are able to retain your ownership of it. And the problem in some jurisdictions is a local government authority might just say, listen, you don't own that company anymore.
00:21:23.906 - 00:21:24.214, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:24.252 - 00:21:32.566, Speaker B: And good luck taking us to court. Like, you're definitely not going to beat the government in court in a lot of different jurisdictions as a foreign US investor.
00:21:32.678 - 00:21:33.340, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:34.350 - 00:21:41.210, Speaker B: So all of which is to say that, yes, we invest globally, and I think that'll continue to accelerate.
00:21:41.290 - 00:21:47.386, Speaker A: Amazing. Agreed. And what do you look for in the founders when you're considering deploying capital?
00:21:47.578 - 00:22:25.914, Speaker B: It really depends on the stage of the opportunity, the category that they're in. But so much of what you'll hear all venture investors say is about investment in the right people as much as the right idea. The best situation is you get both of those correct. It's the right group of people or the right person building the right thing from the outset. But if you have to pick one or the other, you prefer to pick the right person, because they'll be able to find their way to the opportunity, even if it's not the one they initially set out on. One thing that we're definitely conscious of is people who might have learned bad habits. Right.
00:22:25.914 - 00:22:52.530, Speaker B: If they're going to come in and build something radically new, we're actually supportive of them coming from the outside of the industry. They're disrupting. It's not clear to me that the next wave of great DFI founders are going to be people with 25 years of experience at Goldman Sachs. They could be. We'll definitely talk to those founders. That does happen, for sure. And I'm someone who comes from traditional finance, so do a lot of my partners at the firm.
00:22:52.530 - 00:23:02.674, Speaker B: But if you're going to truly think in a fresh sense, you need a fresh lens. And that might mean not having the baggage of the way the legacy world operates.
00:23:02.802 - 00:23:11.830, Speaker A: Absolutely. Agreed. And it makes finding talent kind of difficult. Right. Because it's more about potential than it is about your past credentials.
00:23:11.990 - 00:23:20.342, Speaker B: 100%. I care about their ability to logic and reason through problems. More so than having the perfect solution from the outset.
00:23:20.406 - 00:23:44.958, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I know you all kind of have a bullish stance on San Francisco. I remember I was at a dinner with Brad and he said something, and I've actually stolen this many times, but he said, there's no other city in the world where you can talk about your weird, crazy startup idea at dinner and have everyone offer to help you. You can't do that in New York. You'll get kicked out of the dinner. So what's your current stance on San Francisco?
00:23:45.054 - 00:24:00.422, Speaker B: It's a good point. That's a good quote from Brad. I haven't heard that one from him. He needs to say that more often. That's very good, and it's probably true. Yeah, I mean, listen, you know, we've been headquartered in San Francisco for a long time. We're also really ramping up our presence in New York.
00:24:00.422 - 00:24:15.242, Speaker B: Though a lot of the members of our investment team and a lot of our founders are in New York, we're certainly not blind to the fact that San Francisco has deteriorated in terms of living, quality of life. And so we've embraced that. We're not going to fight gravity on these things.
00:24:15.296 - 00:24:15.562, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:15.616 - 00:24:31.486, Speaker B: If we have, all of a sudden a lot of our founders in New York, we have a lot of people on our team that want to be in New York. We're going to do is a, this is a people business and we want to be near our founders, and we want the members of our investment team to work from where they're going to be productive.
00:24:31.598 - 00:24:40.518, Speaker A: Amazing. Love that. And it does feel like there's a lot of founders moving to New York, but other places as well. Lisbon. But I think San Francisco will come back.
00:24:40.604 - 00:25:03.818, Speaker B: It will, it always does. That's the question. It's always know, how bad does it have to be before it gets better? Right. And that part's been very unclear to me and I think has been exacerbated by the natural dynamic of a lot of the people that would like to see it improve end up leaving and therefore the biggest agents for change end up just exiting.
00:25:03.914 - 00:25:11.934, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's a problem of misaligned incentives, which we're trying to solve for with crypto, so hopefully it flows over.
00:25:12.132 - 00:25:30.038, Speaker D: Before we continue, a quick word from our sponsor, unlimited. Grow your business with unlimited borderless payment solutions. Leverage, one of the world's largest proprietary payment infrastructures available in Europe, LATAM, APAC, Africa and the UK. Now back to our show.
00:25:30.204 - 00:25:45.498, Speaker A: And there's so much happening in crypto these days, especially when it comes to the technology. Conferences are still very much packed and the sentiment seems strong. As you go to these different events, how are you thinking about the various crypto sectors and the macro picture around them?
00:25:45.584 - 00:25:49.430, Speaker B: So I don't think it's anywhere near as dire as general perception.
00:25:49.510 - 00:25:49.754, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:49.792 - 00:26:06.958, Speaker B: Like when I look around, all of my favorite leading indicators are near breaching all time highs. So that's going to be all things related to developer activity, deployment of new smart contracts, and I think especially recently, seeing a lot of progress on scaling.
00:26:07.054 - 00:26:07.362, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:07.416 - 00:26:41.834, Speaker B: Because if we're going to see significant growth, it's going to mean that new users come in. New users come in. When you have compelling applications, to have compelling applications, you need developers building them. And in order to actually retain those users, you need scalable infrastructure that can support their wants and needs and user experience expectations. So I think that we've made so much progress on this over the past year that it kind of blows me away, to be honest. I look at what l two s on Ethereum are doing and it's essentially five x the throughput of ethereum over the past twelve months. I think that's pretty incredible.
00:26:41.834 - 00:27:19.730, Speaker B: And I think frankly it's one of these. We're probably right at exponential takeoff there. I think that we're going to see a lot more growth and far faster than people expect. So I'm really optimistic about the progress on that front. And then just honestly, the facts on the ground, right? Like prices decline by 90% or whatever, pick your favorite asset. But the numbers on the ground are just remarkably solid. And I always like to use DeFi as kind of the tip of the spear, right, because I broke out so much of what we're talking about into different subsectors.
00:27:19.730 - 00:28:26.378, Speaker B: But I really see DeFi as like the canary in the coal mine, just because it's the same primitives that are used in DeFi, that are used in, whether it's consumer social gaming, the general value prop and primitives used for all those different subsectors are user ownership, user control, governance, and most of those are kind of recycled from DeFi. So what I see happening in DeFi, I assume, is going to kind of spread out into the other subsectors. So when I zoom in on DFI and I look at some of the metrics just recently, pulling these together was, I think over the past twelve months, there's been $700 million of D five protocol revenue. I think it's $700 billion of Dex volume. Over the past twelve months. There's north of $3 billion of loans outstanding across compound and Ave. I think the Ethereum network is currently processing.
00:28:26.378 - 00:28:55.990, Speaker B: It's kind of capped out at the gas limit, but a billion transactions a month, roughly, that's 30 to 35 million transactions per day before accounting for the new growth from L two s. And then we just have a lot of applications that are working right. So I see a lot of applications that have a substantial deposit base. And overall, this just makes me very constructive on the outlook. Like this is in the depths of a crypto winter. Where does it go from there?
00:28:56.140 - 00:29:18.160, Speaker A: Absolutely super exciting times ahead, and I want to chat a little bit about bitcoin because we wouldn't be here without the bitcoin industry. And bitcoin has very much maintained its blue chip status. What do you think is next for bitcoin? What's exciting in the bitcoin space and the lightning space, or do you think it's more about maintaining a steady ship at this point?
00:29:19.170 - 00:30:04.080, Speaker B: So I'm torn on this one. I think that bitcoin has certainly seeded some ground or some opportunity to other networks by being particularly conservative. I'm not convinced that that's a suboptimal outcome. I think it's in the industry's best interest if bitcoin continues to be successful in what it wants to be as a digital gold. I think that a failure with bitcoin has negative repercussions for the broader industry. So the fact that bitcoin pushes most of the risk outside of its ecosystem. On the one hand, is it holding bitcoin back to some degree? In my opinion, yes.
00:30:04.080 - 00:30:46.566, Speaker B: Is it maybe in the best interest of the industry as a whole? I think probably right. And we've seen Ethereum kind of go this way as well, where it's definitely nowhere near as conservative as the bitcoin network and ecosystem is, but it's getting more conservative over time. That's a necessary kind of growth trajectory. And so we see some of the innovation that maybe Ethereum is not willing or some of the risk that it's willing to undertake kind of being pushed to other networks to experiment with. I think that's great because you push some of these riskier items or initiatives to lower value networks, and I think that's probably net beneficial for the industry.
00:30:46.678 - 00:31:00.542, Speaker A: And then on Ethereum, the layer two ecosystem feels like it's kind of exploding. There's a lot happening with optimistic and zk roll ups every day and also just in kind of zk land. What are you most excited about in the L two space?
00:31:00.676 - 00:31:21.062, Speaker B: Mostly just that it's happening. Honestly, people get really caught up in optimistic roll ups or zk roll ups. I probably have the relatively consensus view here that longer term most things are probably zk roll ups. We'll see. I don't know. The world can unfold in ways differently than you expect. But mostly I'm just glad that these things are starting to work.
00:31:21.062 - 00:31:58.158, Speaker B: There's still some improvements that are going to be needed, but I'm very happy with it. And I mean, again, I referenced the stat earlier that ethel two s have already scaled Ethereum throughput by five x in the past twelve months alone. I think the supply is actually larger than that. That's actually just a measure of the demand. So that's like, I guess maybe a different way of putting it is today the ethereum network is processing five times more transactions than the L one can actually handle because of the support of L two s. So again, that's actually more of a measure of demand than maybe supply.
00:31:58.334 - 00:32:10.230, Speaker A: Yeah. And kind of circling back to what you said on starting out more centralized sequencing, going more decentralized now, can you speak to why you're excited about decentralization?
00:32:10.650 - 00:32:53.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think there's anything about decentralization itself that really gets me excited. Right. But it is about user empowerment. So that is the core component that got me interested in the industry early on is this notion of using bitcoin, using these open networks as a tool for empowerment, for all people, the ability to directly control their own finances have disintermediated applications. All of that resonates very strongly with me. That overall continues to be the major motivating factor for me in terms of why focus on this industry for so long.
00:32:53.832 - 00:33:13.322, Speaker A: Absolutely. Me as well. And kind of removing all of the centralized point of failures so that we can empower the world. And I kind of view the world as becoming either centralized and kind of authoritarian or decentralized and free. And with this technology, I think we can get to more freedom around the world, if that's still popular these days.
00:33:13.456 - 00:33:38.706, Speaker B: 100%. I totally agree. And so much this just honestly, especially my early involvement in kind of bitcoin and interest in it, was really thinking about it. Not necessarily that it needs to be something that everybody's going to use, that it needs absolutely mass adoption, but that it's important that it exists as an alternative for people. Because even just having alternatives helps keep kind of the status quo in check a bit.
00:33:38.808 - 00:33:39.074, Speaker C: Right?
00:33:39.112 - 00:34:30.018, Speaker B: Like when people do have alternatives and they do have a life raft that they can go to, it instills a little bit more responsibility, I hope, in alternatives that people would otherwise. So it is this whole notion, one of my favorite talks is bology's turn of Austin's talk on voice versus exit. And the whole notion of, like, you can either try and change a system from the inside, or you can exit to a new system. And so when I think about things like bitcoin or just the broader crypto ecosystem, it's not that I expect that everybody should want to adopt this right now, but it is important that it exists as that alternative, that they have that opportunity to exit, because otherwise there is none. Like you're trapped. You have zero alternatives of what you can use. So I think that that's probably the most important aspect here.
00:34:30.104 - 00:34:44.978, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I completely agree. And hopefully it is kind of putting pressure on some of those figures in power to do better and maybe create a better world, even if it's not with mass adoption of bitcoin.
00:34:45.074 - 00:35:21.326, Speaker B: 100%. And let's even think about the trajectory here, right. Crypto starts out as this relatively subpar alternative relative to what people are used to using. But that's the nature of any disruptive innovation. As it starts out with these maybe lower value use cases or just these product set, its feature, its convenience is subpar relative to what people already have, except for maybe some small groups that are particularly disenfranchised from the traditional system. But over time, what happens is, again, we go back to that dynamic that you and I were discussing earlier of shots on goal and innovation.
00:35:21.438 - 00:35:22.050, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:22.200 - 00:35:48.634, Speaker B: As that continues to mature, like as you get more shots on goal and you have these breakthrough innovations eventually, this alternative, this parallel system, has a superior feature set, not an inferior feature set, and it starts to actually pull people in, not because they're seeking to exit just because something's going wrong over here, but because they say, listen, this actually just looks like it's going to serve me better. And so that's how I think it'll play out over the next 10, 15, 20 years.
00:35:48.752 - 00:36:10.866, Speaker A: Yeah. And I went to Stanford recently, and what I noticed during that blockchain event was that there's actually a lot of excitement around new layer ones and app chains. And I thought kind of the time for a layer one, launching a layer one as a money grab is over, just given the adoption that we're seeing in l two s, what's your stance on that? Any thoughts there?
00:36:10.968 - 00:36:42.454, Speaker B: So I never want to be dismissive. Right. Most of what I see is not very interesting optimization. Right. Like if we think about the scalability trilemma or we think about anything else that these networks might try to optimize for. Most of what I've been seeing recently, to me, does not seem like it's going to be compelling enough to overcome the network effects of things that are already well established, like the Ethereum ecosystem. But I'm never going to be dismissive of that.
00:36:42.454 - 00:37:24.838, Speaker B: Right. I think that there are absolutely things that we have not considered that somebody might set out to build that could be a complete game changer that competes on a completely different axis than what we think about today. In all cases, I do expect that we're going to see an extreme power law distribution and we could measure that across these blockchain networks. I don't think it's going to be blockchain activity and users are going to be evenly distributed across 100 networks. Right. I just don't see that as being a viable outcome. I think almost certainly 75, 80, 90% of the activity will happen on the top one, two, maybe as many as three networks.
00:37:24.838 - 00:37:33.914, Speaker B: Right. So it's important to make sure that we continue to orient ourselves around who can realistically be one of those top two or three networks.
00:37:34.042 - 00:37:55.930, Speaker A: Absolutely. That makes sense. And then shifting gears a little bit, I know you mentioned the six sectors. I did notice that the NFT industry was not a part of that, blatantly at least. Maybe you could fit it into social. What's your thought on the NFT industry? It definitely came out of nowhere from my standpoint. And we saw maybe mass adoption with NFTs.
00:37:55.930 - 00:37:57.880, Speaker A: What's the latest thinking there?
00:37:58.330 - 00:38:21.350, Speaker B: So we do we bucket NFTs under consumer, so they're a little tucked in there, but not intentionally. I'd say we're relatively constructive on NFTs. So we made two seed investments in OpeNC in 2018 and then maybe again in 2019, or maybe they're both 2018, I forget. And still the NFT boom caught us by surprise.
00:38:21.430 - 00:38:21.674, Speaker C: Right?
00:38:21.712 - 00:39:06.598, Speaker B: So for us, it was mostly looking at it of, it's this broad umbrella term that has many different, like whether it's digital art, it's collectibles, it's in game assets. The core feature across all of those is that users can own them and they can exchange them directly with one another. So for us, it was, I don't know which if any of these are going to take off, but if so, the core feature is the ability to exchange them. So I want to own a marketplace for them. And so that led us to Opensea. Now, frankly, our strongest candidate for what was going to take off was in game assets, not digital collectibles, digital art and PFPs. So that did very much catch us by surprise as far as the question of our nfts dead.
00:39:06.598 - 00:39:29.518, Speaker B: Are they going to come back? They're absolutely going to come back. And I'm not saying this as like a huge NFT person, right? I own a couple of small nfts. That's it. I dabble, but zoom out a little bit. Nfts tap into this core human behavior of collecting stuff. People love to collect shit. They collect stamps, they collect baseball cards.
00:39:29.518 - 00:39:52.698, Speaker B: That's just what we do. I don't know what it is. Humans, we love to collect stuff, right? And then we love to show it off to people, right? And nfts tap into both of those things so well that this is like a base, caveman level human dynamic that is definitely going to play out again. Right. It's way too much fun for people to do, and it's absolutely going to come back.
00:39:52.784 - 00:40:02.942, Speaker A: Absolutely, yeah, completely agree. And everything's going digital, too. So it makes sense that newer generations want to display things in a digital way as opposed to a physical way.
00:40:02.996 - 00:40:18.734, Speaker B: It's actually surprising even how much I can explain this to demographics that would be very outside of the core NFT demographics, right? Particularly older people. And I start explaining to them of, start asking them, hey, do you have any art in your wall?
00:40:18.852 - 00:40:19.520, Speaker C: Right?
00:40:21.650 - 00:40:23.498, Speaker B: Are you a member of a country club?
00:40:23.594 - 00:40:23.854, Speaker C: Right?
00:40:23.892 - 00:40:51.126, Speaker B: And then I start asking them, do you like to show your arts people? Right? Like, do you ever talk about your country club? Right? And they're like, oh yeah. And so then I start explaining NFTs in the same sense of like, okay, this is something that they can show off to millions of people instead of like two dozen that might come to their house in a given three month period. And all of a sudden it clicks and they're like, I get it, 100%. This is definitely going to be a thing. And these are even people that are oftentimes skeptical on crypto, but then they can grock nfts.
00:40:51.238 - 00:41:02.430, Speaker A: Totally. And I think the same thing with money, right? You will want a digital money over a physical money, at least the newer generation. So that can kind of lead people down the bitcoin rabbit hole as well.
00:41:02.500 - 00:41:03.166, Speaker B: 100%.
00:41:03.268 - 00:41:15.298, Speaker A: And then let's talk a little bit about DFI. So the TVLs are a little bit flat. I know we have still impressive numbers, but what do you think will lead defi out of the funk that we're currently in?
00:41:15.384 - 00:42:02.818, Speaker B: It's a good question. So it's going to come back to that dynamic of innovation that I was describing. So, like, you always see these kind of like s curves for any kind of breakout technology. There's like this radical uptick where there's lots of innovation, lots of innovation, and then it kind of levels off. And a lot of times that big uptick kind of kicks off because someone unlocks one particular thing and then other people are making a bunch of iterations on it, applying it in different ways. And so you see this little mini cambrian explosion around it, right? DeFi has definitely been in a lull for a while where I haven't seen anything go any zero to one moments in the past couple of years, right? And there's a lot of people building cool stuff, right? Like, it's a 15% better uniswap and a 10% better ave. And honestly, a lot of cool things.
00:42:02.818 - 00:42:49.570, Speaker B: It's just for us, when we think about most of the industry evolving to a power law distribution, being 10% better is not sufficient. And so we're really watching out for who's going to have another major breakthrough. And I am extremely high conviction that that will happen. And within a relatively short period of time, where I guess for us, a relatively short period of time, let's call it like 24 months, where I think people are going to have a major breakthrough that's going to trigger a string of other major breakthroughs. And I think that'll put us into a whole nother level of interest, hopefully not a mania. I hope that these things stay a little bit under the radar. I hope that we can just play with them in a quiet context a little bit without it being, like, screaming it from the mountaintops.
00:42:49.570 - 00:42:53.826, Speaker B: But that's not really the way life works here.
00:42:53.928 - 00:42:57.414, Speaker A: Totally not the crypto industry we know and love.
00:42:57.532 - 00:42:59.206, Speaker C: So here's something new.
00:42:59.308 - 00:42:59.714, Speaker B: Bumper.
00:42:59.762 - 00:43:27.902, Speaker C: Your assets to defend them from price drops without losing upside exposure. You set a price floor and term length, then lock your tokens into the protocol when your term ends, if the price has fallen under your floor, you leave with stablecoins at the floor's value. Otherwise, you just take back your original asset. Bumper is going live in August, and it's one of the most innovative defi protocols for hedging being built right now. So check out bumper phi. There's links in the description of this video. Now back to our story.
00:43:28.036 - 00:43:44.510, Speaker A: And a podcast isn't fun without a little controversy. So I would consider you all kind of bitcoin OGs. And then you led $150,000,000 round for worldcoin. Tell us about your investment thesis there and how you kind of reconcile that with the crypto ethos.
00:43:44.670 - 00:44:04.250, Speaker B: 100%. Yeah. So you won't find too many people that were more of a probably world coin skeptic than myself. So I give you some context here. Right. We typically use slack to be able to communicate within our team. Typically telegram with our founders run slack, and we're always discussing who's out raising.
00:44:04.250 - 00:44:32.434, Speaker B: Should we invest some significant time into looking into it? Someone mentioned that worldcoin is thinking about raising. Do we want to take a look? My immediate reaction was, absolutely not. Everybody save yourself some time. I want nothing to do with it. I don't even think zero point in anybody wasting five minutes. Fortunately, a few members of our engineering team that are maybe less impacted by popular opinion than myself.
00:44:32.552 - 00:44:33.220, Speaker C: Right.
00:44:33.750 - 00:44:45.826, Speaker B: Listen, I've dug into quite a bit of what they're building, and it's totally fine. We might decide that it's not a fit for the fund, but absolutely, there's a lot of interesting things going on here. Do not be dismissive just because it's unpopular.
00:44:45.938 - 00:44:46.214, Speaker C: Right?
00:44:46.252 - 00:45:12.800, Speaker B: Like, yes, fine, crypto. Twitter hates it. Is that really going to be something that's going to stop this from being successful? So we dug in. It took me a very long time. I had just, like, my laundry list of reasons why we're never going to do this. And slowly just kept chipping away at them. And particularly a couple of the engineers in our team were the ones really challenging my thinking on this, of what's really happening.
00:45:12.800 - 00:45:38.520, Speaker B: Like, all right, worldcoin, what's going on? That's all the context. That's the know worldcoin started. They have this idea. Sam Altman has this idea of, like, okay, this is interesting, this whole crypto thing, but would be really cool is if you could create one that everybody in the world had access. Let's. Let's create a better genie coefficient here, like bitcoin, ethereum. All these are pretty concentrated, and it's pretty hard to get them to most of the world.
00:45:38.520 - 00:45:57.200, Speaker B: Let's just run an experiment where we give an equal portion to everybody in the world and run it from there. That's a pretty cool idea. That's not something that really, I think, for blockchain capital, we're probably not going to underwrite that. We'd say that's a cool experiment. Definitely go and do it. It's like kind of a science project. It might become something, but we're not sure.
00:45:57.200 - 00:46:40.586, Speaker B: Now, of course, in going to do that, they realized the hard problem, which is, how do you actually distribute an asset over the Internet to everybody in the world? Like, how do you give everybody an equal opportunity of acquiring that asset? It is actually insanely difficult. So they first started going through the options, right? One of them is to do kycaml on everybody. Like, make everybody submit a government ID, and then they can claim it. Now, it's actually a horrible solution. Like, one that's extremely dystopian that you're going to make everybody submit an ID to go collect. Like, it really sucks. Second of all, if your objective, and the core objective was to give everybody in the world a chance to get it, well, you just ruled out half the world.
00:46:40.586 - 00:47:13.110, Speaker B: Half the world does not have a suitable digital identity that they can verify to be able to claim their share. And that's actually the half that you're really trying to get it to. So, okay, that's a horrible method. Then you start to go, like, web of trust. And so that was their next major thing that they really tried to think about, if it could work, was like, we start with the two of us, and then we go out and vouch for people. We build this web of trust, and eventually this is a network of real people because we all attested to it. Of course, the problem is this just doesn't scale.
00:47:13.110 - 00:47:51.650, Speaker B: It does not work. You get one bad seed in there, someone attests to a false person, and there's no constraints on that problem. And pretty soon, you don't have a network of real individuals. Okay, so then it takes you into biometrics, right? So then you're like, okay, well, how can we actually identify unique human beings? Well, biometrics are what make us human and what defines how unique we are. So we can go there. So you originally think of things like fingerprints. You think of DNA.
00:47:51.650 - 00:48:25.360, Speaker B: The problem with most of these is either one, they're way too privacy invasive. So, like, collecting somebody's DNA, you're asking them to provide far more information than necessary to prove their uniqueness. And it's really sensitive data, like people's genetic data. I made the mistake of doing 23 andme, and I wish I hadn't. I just don't really want to provide my genetic data to somebody. So that's really not a good alternative. You need the tip of the iceberg, and you're asking for the whole iceberg, right? That's not a good one.
00:48:25.360 - 00:48:52.614, Speaker B: You can go into things like fingerprints. The problem is there's really not that much entropy in it, and people can alter them. So if I just go and burn my finger now, my fingerprint is different, right. It doesn't really necessarily stay the same. And once you scale to billions of people, some fingerprints are going to start colliding with each other's. So the natural one that everyone arrives to is like, Face ID. Let's use that.
00:48:52.614 - 00:49:26.190, Speaker B: Let's use Face ID. I already have my iPhone. I'm already used to using it. That'd be great, right? This hardware already exists out in the wild, in mass supply. The problem is there's not enough entropy in human faces. Actually, once you start scanning past 100 million people, turns out there's a lot of people that look like Spencer Bogart, right? They are not that distinguishable from. So, like, it actually becomes a real ceiling to scaling, because you start getting an absurd number of, let's see, false positives.
00:49:26.190 - 00:49:56.700, Speaker B: So the system, like, someone would go to go do a face ID, and it would say, no, there's already somebody on the network with your ID, so you're actually trying to civil attack. And no, you cannot receive your portion of it, which is fascinating, by the way. I did not realize that that's the case with Face ID. Face ID is solving a totally different problem. Right. It takes a deep embedding of your face, it keeps it on your phone, and each time it's just trying to match. Is this probably the same person whose face is embedded into this phone? Right.
00:49:56.700 - 00:50:36.920, Speaker B: If it has an error rate of one in a million that's totally fine, right? Because what are the chances that the millionth person that looks like you is going to pick up your phone and unlock it? It's very slim, right, but it does not scale. You can't do it at billions of people. So. Okay, I promise I'm getting towards the end here, but this brings us to the solution. Why did they build this orb, and why are they using iris scans? Right, so Iris, turns out, has a ton of entropy in it, right? So you can actually distinguish unique people from someone's iris at the scale of billions of people. What I mean is that we're not ending up with collisions. Right.
00:50:36.920 - 00:51:31.466, Speaker B: There's nobody else's eye in the world. If we scan, 3 billion people is going to look the exact same as mine. You need to do custom hardware for it, though, because to get a high def enough view of the iris, it's going to require some custom scanning, and because the orb has other anti kind of Sybil mechanisms to it, so it's actually also detecting. Am I moving around? Like, am I alive person, or am I a dead person? Like, some kind of morbid things, or is this, like a human eye in front of me or not? It's like doing some body temperature things to make sure that I'm alive. So it needs all these extra sensors, and it needs to be very high definition to be able to capture the iris. Okay, so then from there, why is this privacy preserving? I think the biggest misconception is that worldcoin is somehow just collecting a bunch of people's iris scans. That's not true.
00:51:31.466 - 00:52:16.246, Speaker B: So if you go through the sign up flow and anybody can do this to verify it, by default, they do not store any kind of iris scan. If you would like to, people can go ahead and opt in to have it stored. The only reason why they would choose to do so is out of convenience, because the software on the orb is being upgraded all the time to get higher fidelity. And as it does, it's possible that some people would need to get rescans in the future, right? That it would say, like, listen, actually, at this level, you're starting to collide with somebody. We need to just reverify this. It's unclear if that'll ever happen, but it's a possibility. So people could opt to have an encrypted saved version of their iris scan if they want to suggest that.
00:52:16.246 - 00:52:43.342, Speaker B: Most people just don't if they're concerned about it. Okay, so that's like a really long winded way of explaining why do you end up at irish scanning. What is the purpose of the project? How is this privacy preserving? I guess I haven't gone fully into the privacy preserving portion. There's a ton of materials on this online that anybody's interested. I'd suggest that you go read those. But the important portion is that again, by default, nothing is stored. And then when you go to go use.
00:52:43.342 - 00:53:28.110, Speaker B: So when I get an iris scan, I receive a world ID. I can use that with any application that supports world ID to attest that I am a real unique human being. I do that via zero knowledge proof, so I can go vote in three different governance choices and defi, and then I can go and access an application with my world ID. None of those things are linkable. As long as you understand that zero knowledge proofs are unlinkable, then you get it right. This is all built on largely on semaphore, which is developed by the Ethereum Foundation. Vitalik himself has gone and done a write up on the puts and takes of worldcoin versus other unique identity protocols.
00:53:28.110 - 00:53:43.298, Speaker B: Okay, so that's like a really long winded way taken. I'm going to stop there. I can talk a little bit about why does this matter? Why are we even trying to identify unique humans on the Internet? I realized I didn't cover the problem at all, but I'm also happy to leave it there if it's better.
00:53:43.384 - 00:53:59.078, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that strong stance on privacy is going to be crucial. I'm also really impressed with their zero knowledge team. And I think in a world of AI, we know why it's important to be able to prove you're human online. So that all works. Have you scanned your eye yet?
00:53:59.164 - 00:54:14.126, Speaker B: I did. Of course I did. There's no way I'm going to invest in it without doing it myself. So, yeah, so I got my scan. I am a real unique human being. I have my world ID. And eventually I think there's going to be a lot of applications that care about doing it.
00:54:14.126 - 00:54:29.730, Speaker B: The same way that Twitter is now trying to make you pay to prove that you're not a bot. It's a pretty weak civil resistance mechanism, right? You'll get bots to pay. That's not that hard. So, yeah, it'll be a fun one to watch evolve over the next few years.
00:54:29.800 - 00:54:40.790, Speaker A: Totally. And when the bots can hold bitcoin, then we're in an interesting place in the world. Over the last decade, you've been in crypto. What's the most surprising thing you've seen in the industry?
00:54:44.570 - 00:54:50.554, Speaker B: I think a lot of times it's just acknowledging that things are going to look different than I might expect.
00:54:50.672 - 00:54:51.242, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:51.376 - 00:55:21.474, Speaker B: And you have to be careful about. There's this human tendency, I think, to base the future strictly off what we already know today. And the future, I think, usually looks more different and weirder than we can expect. A good example of this would be in defi. I was very dismissive of amms early on because I come from traditional finance and I'm like, this is a horribly inefficient way to price an asset. No, like an order book exchange is how this works. This is fundamentally not a good way to do this.
00:55:21.474 - 00:55:37.926, Speaker B: And that's true. That's right. Except that I missed that. It also enabled some really core features in terms of convenience and supporting a long tail of assets. And that was actually what was necessary. And over time, things have actually gone to resemble more of like an order book model. Right.
00:55:37.926 - 00:55:52.362, Speaker B: Like Univ. Three is closer to totally. It's not all the way there, but the market has undeniably moved in that direction. But again, you need to be conscious of what the market really needs at a particular point in time and what it's capable of.
00:55:52.416 - 00:56:01.518, Speaker A: Totally. And the transparency aspect of DFI compared to tradfi. Absolutely. Okay. And you have a bunch of fresh money to spend. So how can people get in touch with you?
00:56:01.604 - 00:56:16.982, Speaker B: We do. So listen, I'm always accessible via email. Spencer@blockchaincapital.com you can also reach out to any of my colleagues, especially folks on our investment team. It's usually their first name@blockchaincapital.com. Otherwise you can follow me on Twitter. Dm me.
00:56:16.982 - 00:56:20.694, Speaker B: I'm at Creme de la Crypto on Twitter. Or X.
00:56:20.812 - 00:56:24.920, Speaker A: Awesome. Oh yeah. X. And then how are you? Defiant. That's our final.
00:56:27.770 - 00:56:59.954, Speaker B: Know. I just want to back the founders that are really going to change the future of like, I think that, honestly, people should be extremely disappointed. People should be upset at the lack of innovation that we've seen in fintech and finance over the past two decades. I joke with a lot of my fintech friends that do venture in the category of like, fintech figured out fractionalized shares. That's like Robinhood over collateralized lending to venture firms. That's like Brex APIs, like plaid and stripe. That's about it.
00:56:59.954 - 00:57:19.610, Speaker B: That's like all the innovations over the past two decades. And those are all things that come out of the box for free with crypto. Crypto always does those. I forgot two other things in fintech. Sorry there were some innovations in cross border payments and remittances also free out of the box with. Right. Like, these are all things that it does natively.
00:57:19.610 - 00:57:38.442, Speaker B: The one major fintech innovation that crypto cannot replicate so far is buy now, pay later. So that's like companies like Affirm and Klarna, right, that all do this. Like, hey, you're buying a sandwich. Do you want to pay it off in six? Like, I don't know, maybe. Color me skeptical. I'm not convinced. This is actually, like, a major innovation.
00:57:38.442 - 00:57:57.670, Speaker B: And I think people should be upset about this. Like, finance impacts finance payments, even if they're invisible in your life. It's one of the things that has this most significant impact on your daily life, even if it's invisible in the background. And we should expect more. We should be disappointed. We should be frustrated. And I think that Defi can solve that, and that's why I'm defiant.
00:57:58.010 - 00:58:05.080, Speaker A: Absolutely. Very well said. Well, appreciate the sound and pragmatic approach, as always. Thank you so much for coming on.
00:58:05.610 - 00:58:06.900, Speaker B: Pagan, thanks so much for having me.
