00:00:00.250 - 00:00:03.626, Speaker A: You. One of the most important new tools.
00:00:03.658 - 00:00:07.130, Speaker B: To master in DFI is trading on decentralized exchanges on Ethereum.
00:00:07.210 - 00:00:19.566, Speaker A: For those trading tokens powered by Ethereum ERC 20, it's important that we can find the best trading rates across a growing list of liquidity sources in DFI. It's kind of similar to searching for the best flight rate.
00:00:19.668 - 00:00:22.350, Speaker B: Do you check each airline website one by one?
00:00:22.420 - 00:01:14.334, Speaker A: Or do you rely on search engines or aggregators like Expedia or Google flights to guide you to the best deals? And that's exactly what we'll discuss in this video with the Dex aggregators. Now, while many of us have used popular amms like Uniswap, Balancer curve, and the like, the truth is we should all abandon trading on these individual platforms when Dex aggregators source liquidity from all of these liquidity sources, plus countless others. Sure, you might like uniswap or balancer, but there's no reason to pay higher rates in certain instances when a Dex aggregator can guarantee you a better rate and minimal slippage, whether it comes from uniswap or Kyber or balancer or muniswap. Yes, there's an exchange called Muniswap or sushiswap. Yep, there's one of those two. And more. Think of the Dex aggregator as the search engine for your defi trading.
00:01:14.334 - 00:01:58.674, Speaker A: The aggregators even split up your trade across different liquidity sources to improve the price. And it's not just a matter of knowing where to trade in defi anymore. Due to the algorithmic order routing, you'd likely never be able to find better rates. Searching on your own, you'd be competing against continuously refined algorithms to optimize trade routes, rates slippage, and of course, against the backdrop of major liquidity fluctuations in real time. So if you're interested to try a Dex aggregator, well, where do you go? Well, the most reputable ones on Ethereum in no particular order are as follows. One inch exchange, and this is the one with the highest trade volume. There's also Paraswap, there's matcha by zero X, and there's Dex Ag.
00:01:58.674 - 00:02:31.622, Speaker A: Some catchy names. In the future, you'll likely see Dex aggregators built into every defi wallet and product. And we're starting to see these already in my ether wallet and metamask. And as the API for Dex aggregators becomes the common engine amongst different DeFi applications, this is sure to grow. Zapper exchange is also powered by the same API as Matcha Xyz that uses the Ox API. And if one uses matcha to trade and uses Zapper to track their DFI portfolio. Well, they might as well use zapper exchange, since it's just matcha reincarnated.
00:02:31.622 - 00:02:32.394, Speaker A: Still with me?
00:02:32.432 - 00:02:33.706, Speaker B: You've been watching DFI 101.
