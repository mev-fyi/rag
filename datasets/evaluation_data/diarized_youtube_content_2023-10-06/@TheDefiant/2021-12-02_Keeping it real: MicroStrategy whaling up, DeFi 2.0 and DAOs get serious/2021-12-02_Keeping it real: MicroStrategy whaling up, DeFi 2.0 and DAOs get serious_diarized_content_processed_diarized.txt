00:00:06.410 - 00:00:26.082, Speaker A: Welcome to real Vision Crypto and the Defiance weekly crypto show. Today we are joined once again by real Vision's voice of reason, Ash Bennington, and our very own Camilla Russo, author of the Infinite Machine, soon to be a major motion picture. I'm Robin Schmidt, captain of all things moving image at the Defiant, but sadly, not on the running to helm the true story of the Ethereum, Genesis.
00:00:26.146 - 00:00:28.854, Speaker B: Ash, did you know that Camilla's going.
00:00:28.892 - 00:00:30.402, Speaker A: To be a film producer?
00:00:30.466 - 00:00:31.560, Speaker B: Did you know this?
00:00:32.090 - 00:00:33.510, Speaker C: I just learned that now.
00:00:33.580 - 00:00:36.520, Speaker A: Do tell Tammy, what's the.
00:00:38.410 - 00:01:30.060, Speaker D: I mean, super excited about this. So there's a production company versus Entertainment who bought the options to buy the rights to make a movie out of the Infinite machine. The book I wrote about the history of Ethereum, which was published last year by Harper Collins. So now the goal is to make it into a major motion picture film for a mainstream, you know, like blockbuster Hollywood kind of film goal is like social network for crypto. So, yeah, super excited about that. And of course, being a movie about Ethereum, it will be funded by the Ethereum community via NFTs. So that project in itself is just like, I'm in love with that project.
00:01:30.060 - 00:02:05.410, Speaker D: We've curated 40 artists from emerging countries who are less known in the NFT communities, and they are creating their version of the Ethereum logo. And then we are programmatically combining those Ethereum logos to get a collection of 10,499 e logos. So that will be the collection that will be sold in a couple of weeks. We haven't set the date yet, but that should help fund or at least fund part of the production.
00:02:07.350 - 00:02:09.350, Speaker C: Cammy, who's playing you in the movie?
00:02:10.490 - 00:02:16.070, Speaker D: Maybe I can play myself. I don't know. Should start taking acting lessons.
00:02:16.490 - 00:02:39.518, Speaker A: Well, there's this growing movement of crypto entities for preserving culture, or at least reinforcing culture and taking ownership of culture in different and weird and wonderful ways. And that actually sets up a story we're going to cover later, which is constitution Dow. But we're going to kick off today with the extraordinary story of microstrategy upping their bitcoin holdings to 121,044.
00:02:39.604 - 00:02:41.806, Speaker B: They bought. How many did they buy?
00:02:41.828 - 00:02:55.578, Speaker A: They bought another 7002 bitcoin in the fiscal fourth quarter, cost them $414,000,000. Cammy, how do you feel about this massive company hoovering up so much bitcoin?
00:02:55.774 - 00:03:47.350, Speaker D: First off, it's just incredible that we're at this stage of crypto where we have public companies just having bitcoin in their balance sheet. This is something that's new to this cycle that we hadn't seen before. So in itself, it's huge news. Very interesting. And I think, just like how well that strategy has done for microstrategy will probably inspire others to do the same thing and add crypto to their balance sheet. I mean, why not? It's a way to diversify holdings. But obviously, there's the issue of centralization that comes up when this single entity is holding such a large amount of bitcoin.
00:03:47.350 - 00:04:16.510, Speaker D: And it obviously goes in the opposite direction of what we're trying to achieve with DeFi and with the blockchain and cryptocurrency in general. So, yeah, it's great news for the space for adoption, but I think it does raise those red flags.
00:04:17.330 - 00:04:20.554, Speaker B: Well, it's 28% of all bitcoin created.
00:04:20.602 - 00:04:30.986, Speaker A: Since they started buying, so not 28% of all bitcoin, but since they started actually buying was about 18 months ago. Ash, what's the view from your side of the street? Because from our side, we're a little.
00:04:31.028 - 00:04:33.090, Speaker B: Bit skeptical about this, but I guess.
00:04:33.240 - 00:04:35.060, Speaker A: It sends a strong signal to the market.
00:04:35.510 - 00:05:21.140, Speaker C: Well, Cammy makes some intriguing points there. First, absolutely. The point about centralization is an interesting one, and one that I think we're going to need to talk about more. But second, her point about how early these guys were to the table in the cycle, I think also impressive. But the flip side of that is this idea that really Michael Saylor has been a master of not just understanding bitcoin before, virtually all of his contemporaries who are running publicly traded companies, but also in figuring out the capital structure, arbitrage aspect of this, the way to assemble bitcoin on a public company's balance sheet, things like tax efficiency, understanding how those purchases work, how to fund them, a really interesting thing, and I think certainly something that we may see more of in the future.
00:05:21.830 - 00:05:23.074, Speaker B: What's the downside to this?
00:05:23.112 - 00:05:33.270, Speaker A: When bitcoin does what bitcoin does and enters the down phase of its four year cycle, how's Michael say they're going to react when that happens?
00:05:33.420 - 00:05:50.762, Speaker C: Well, the short answer is less favorably, obviously, when the price of the asset continues to rise, the ability to do so, particularly from a public corporation perspective, is greatly enhanced in terms of where this is going to go in the future. If we see a significant drawdown, we're going to have to wait and see, but I'd have to imagine it's not going to be pretty.
00:05:50.896 - 00:05:58.078, Speaker A: There's this sort of sense that once these guys enter the market, we can all start kind of putting the bunting up and saying, yes, we made it.
00:05:58.244 - 00:06:02.218, Speaker B: But let's be honest, these guys are sharks. They are there for profit.
00:06:02.314 - 00:06:04.014, Speaker A: So is there an incentive for them.
00:06:04.052 - 00:06:05.358, Speaker B: To take the other side of the.
00:06:05.364 - 00:06:15.250, Speaker A: Market and short it on the way down because that would be the most profitable strategy? Or are they really holding because they believe in bitcoin as this, quote unquote, hedge against inflation?
00:06:15.830 - 00:06:36.506, Speaker C: Well, I think Michael Saylor really does have a principled position in his belief in bitcoin. I think he's made that pretty clear over the years. But I would say, look, the thing about capital markets and the thing about the structure and design of bitcoin is that it's intended to be an asset class where people can be sharks, and you still have someone to take the opposite side of the trade. That's what makes capital markets work.
00:06:36.608 - 00:06:41.660, Speaker A: Kimilla, anything else to add on the kind of skepticism around?
00:06:42.590 - 00:07:49.090, Speaker D: I mean, I think kind of your point is exactly why having so much bitcoin in one entity is risky. You're under risk of having one party being able to just dump a bunch of bitcoin in the market when things go south or at any point in time. There's also this idea of microstrategy kind of taking on debt to buy bitcoin. So it's acting as this sort of almost like central bank for bitcoin, which it just leaves the market more susceptible to what a single entity wants to do with its holdings. So, I mean, that's just something to take into account. But like Ash said, it is a free market, and individuals and entities are free to do what they want to hedge their positions, but it's just something to take into account when there's just this one party holding such a large amount.
00:07:49.240 - 00:08:21.934, Speaker C: Yeah, I would probably also add just one other point to that, which is this idea that it's very early. There's a certain capital market arbitrage aspect of this as well. For people who are not able to invest in bitcoin directly because of their investment charters, people and organizations who aren't able to invest, they have the ability to buy a public equity and get exposure to it. That's something that probably will decrease as we go forward. And as this asset class matures, you'll see ability to jump in and buy directly in custody of the assets directly. So that's probably something that will diminish as the years go by.
00:08:22.052 - 00:08:53.846, Speaker A: Well, there's been this repeating pattern of whales, people who have disproportionate amounts of tokens and holdings in different places exerting outsized influence over the protocols or the tokens which they hold. Defi summer last year was fueled by liquidity mining, and VCs rapidly, or at least certain VCs rapidly, understood that there was an enormous amount of money to be made. And so they poured capital and supplied liquidity to protocols, which they then promptly removed once it had become less profitable to do so.
00:08:53.868 - 00:08:57.586, Speaker B: And there's this phenomenal statistic from Nanson.
00:08:57.698 - 00:09:22.078, Speaker A: Which states that 42% of users who enter a farm on the day it launches would exit within 24 hours, and around 16% of the users would leave within 48 hours. And by the third day, 70% of the users would leave the farm. So these protocols, they live or die by the liquidity that's supplied. But if all of it's leaving and a lot of it's predatory, then they're really kind of screwed. And that has set the stage for what we're calling DFI 2.0.
00:09:22.164 - 00:09:23.454, Speaker B: Whether that's the right name or not.
00:09:23.492 - 00:09:30.770, Speaker A: It'S an evolution of protocol owned liquidity. And, Cammie, maybe you can help explain what that actually means.
00:09:30.840 - 00:09:33.620, Speaker B: And maybe in layman's terms, sure.
00:09:34.230 - 00:10:28.818, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think the thing to keep in mind is that right now, as Robin mentioned, DeFi protocols depend on this liquidity, on the amount of assets that are in the protocol. Because all of DeFi right now is fueled by collateral. People need it to take out loans, because we don't have uncollateralized loans in DeFi. And then protocols need these assets to then give out interest to lenders. So this is why liquidity is just so important in DeFi particularly. And so it is really harmful when providers of liquidity just leave to wherever there's a better yield.
00:10:28.818 - 00:11:44.106, Speaker D: And this, I think, was made, even people were, were being incentivized to go to wherever there's a higher yield because of this new kind of yield farming concept that started to pick up in DeFi summer last year. So because of protocols incentivizing liquidity with additional token rewards, it basically made it very easy for people to just go wherever they were being incentivized. So what D five 2.0 is trying to do is to change those incentives to make people stay in the protocol for longer. So instead of being a case where users can withdraw their liquidity whenever they want, as has been the case in DeFi for much of its history, now users are incentivized to keep their liquidity in the protocols for a longer period of time. And in that period of time, these protocols can use that liquidity elsewhere. So that's why it's called protocol owned liquidity.
00:11:44.106 - 00:12:29.434, Speaker D: The protocol can use that liquidity to earn yield in other protocols. So this has the goal of increasing capital efficiency, which DeFi right now, or most of. DeFi isn't very capital efficient because like we mentioned before, there's a bunch of liquidity sitting in smart contracts. The famous total value locked highlights that there's $200 billion sitting in smart contracts, not doing much. So this D five 2.0 movement, what it could potentially accomplish is that it will be able to put this value to work in other protocols. This is good and bad.
00:12:29.434 - 00:13:08.674, Speaker D: It obviously raises risk, because as a user, if I'm putting value or my crypto in a smart contract now, I don't have the guarantee that it'll be there when I go claim it back. So I think there's those risks to weigh. Of course, there can be kind of limits to how much of those assets can be used, and there's ways to diminish that risk. But while it makes defi more efficient, it also makes it a bit more risky.
00:13:08.802 - 00:13:17.226, Speaker A: This is quite a lot to take on board. You must have questions about why liquidity provision was a problem in the first place, or where potential problems arise, I'm.
00:13:17.248 - 00:13:20.250, Speaker B: Sure because it's quite opaque, this whole subject.
00:13:20.830 - 00:13:58.630, Speaker C: Yeah, it's fascinating. First of all, great statistics, Robin, talking about the sort of the fickleness of that capital. I guess it shouldn't be surprising. People who are interested in providing liquidity are not there because of philosophical reasons. They're there to get yield. So it's a really intriguing question, I think, to Cammy's points, understanding how to redesign these structures so that you can incentivize longer term capital is an intriguing question, but also the point that she made about additional risk. When you put that capital to work, if it goes into riskier places, there's always the risk that that yield will come at the cost of greater potential for impermanent losses, and in fact, permanent losses when those positions get closed.
00:13:59.130 - 00:14:01.382, Speaker A: Well, I think the situation is that.
00:14:01.516 - 00:14:04.070, Speaker B: Protocols make a deal with the devil, to a degree.
00:14:04.150 - 00:14:15.678, Speaker A: They partner up with VCs who say, I'll supply you capital, and then they make these kind of slightly wafty promises about what they will supply in terms of additional benefits, and those never really come good, but the protocol gets the.
00:14:15.684 - 00:14:18.334, Speaker B: Benefit of saying, x is with us.
00:14:18.452 - 00:14:21.502, Speaker A: And they get a bunch of discounted tokens which they then dump on the market.
00:14:21.556 - 00:14:25.198, Speaker B: And it's deeply detrimental to a protocol's sentiment.
00:14:25.294 - 00:14:27.234, Speaker A: And that is then deeply detrimental to.
00:14:27.272 - 00:14:29.922, Speaker B: The protocol's overall picture in the market.
00:14:30.056 - 00:14:32.354, Speaker A: Which is problematic because it's not something.
00:14:32.392 - 00:14:33.938, Speaker B: They have any control over.
00:14:34.104 - 00:14:38.962, Speaker A: So this new movement is basically saying, if we own our liquidity, we manage.
00:14:39.016 - 00:14:40.438, Speaker B: Our token price, and if we can.
00:14:40.444 - 00:14:43.702, Speaker A: Manage our token price, we manage our sentiment, and then we can manage everything.
00:14:43.756 - 00:14:46.578, Speaker B: Else accordingly, because people are not suffering.
00:14:46.594 - 00:14:52.618, Speaker A: These massive swings and drops in fortune over which we have no control, which is good and it's bad.
00:14:52.704 - 00:14:55.050, Speaker B: So the project that's done the most.
00:14:55.120 - 00:14:58.506, Speaker A: To kind of start this movement is called Olympus Dow, and Olympus Dow is.
00:14:58.528 - 00:15:01.478, Speaker B: One of those protocols that makes no sense when you look at it.
00:15:01.504 - 00:15:04.654, Speaker A: It offers insanely high apys, it's built.
00:15:04.692 - 00:15:06.446, Speaker B: Around a meme three three.
00:15:06.628 - 00:15:08.666, Speaker A: But effectively what they're doing is they're.
00:15:08.698 - 00:15:11.406, Speaker B: Saying, give us your liquidity, or give.
00:15:11.428 - 00:15:21.582, Speaker A: Us some assets like stablecoins that we can use to prop up our treasury, and we'll give you discounted tokens. And they've acquired somewhere in the region of 99.7% of their own liquidity.
00:15:21.646 - 00:15:30.438, Speaker B: So anytime there is a trade for their token Ohm on sushi swap, they earn money because they get fees for.
00:15:30.444 - 00:15:39.586, Speaker A: Those swaps, so they have a profit generating a revenue generating asset that they've swapped for their own token, and now they're profitable and it's generated this virtuous.
00:15:39.618 - 00:15:42.746, Speaker B: Flywheel that is making them really interesting.
00:15:42.848 - 00:15:50.138, Speaker A: But alongside it comes this real kind of, well, hang on, you own all of your own liquidity, 99.7% of it.
00:15:50.224 - 00:15:56.398, Speaker B: You own all of it. That's not decentralized at all. So it's wonderful because they escaped the.
00:15:56.404 - 00:15:59.306, Speaker A: Clutches of predatory liquidity miners, but they've.
00:15:59.338 - 00:16:04.874, Speaker B: Also walked into this second problem, which is, well, now they have all the power and they have all the control.
00:16:04.932 - 00:16:06.722, Speaker A: And we're starting to see them now.
00:16:06.856 - 00:16:09.906, Speaker B: Sit up and say, well, actually we.
00:16:09.928 - 00:16:11.266, Speaker A: Have all these other tokens, and those.
00:16:11.288 - 00:16:14.954, Speaker B: Tokens grant us governance rights over protocols like curve.
00:16:15.022 - 00:16:18.166, Speaker A: Well, maybe we can accumulate more governance rights and more power.
00:16:18.268 - 00:16:26.258, Speaker B: And you're starting to see these very problematic movements pop up around protocol owned.
00:16:26.274 - 00:16:36.374, Speaker A: Liquidity, which I'm watching very closely, because it feels like we're just repeating the same cycle of whales accumulating power and then exerting that power and getting upset.
00:16:36.422 - 00:16:40.910, Speaker B: When people don't like it. Camilla, have you got any thoughts over that?
00:16:41.060 - 00:18:22.480, Speaker D: Governance in DFI and web three obviously continues to be a work in progress, and I think that governance tokens can be a way maybe to remedy that. So maybe the protocol can own its liquidity but maybe it can offer other participants governance rights to have a say on how the protocol is run. And I think we've seen so many experiments with token based democracy and then delegated democracy, that these mechanisms are still very much in flux by very far from perfect. But I'm still optimistic that there's enough experimentation going on in the space that we're not at a place to say that, oh wow, we have replicated the old system. I think everyone still is aware that this needs to be improved. And I think we are at least seeing the right infrastructure being built to get there with better tools for tracking votes, with easier platforms for people to participate with governance tokens themselves, which I think will be proven to have been kind of revolutionary in web three, kind of giving individual users a say on how protocols are run.
00:18:23.810 - 00:18:27.706, Speaker B: Ash, I'm curious whether Wall street entities.
00:18:27.898 - 00:18:32.798, Speaker A: The likes of Michael Saylor are thinking about DeFi. Do you have any inkling of that at all?
00:18:32.884 - 00:18:34.880, Speaker B: Are they looking at this space in any way?
00:18:35.410 - 00:19:06.586, Speaker C: Well, I'm sure that based on the growth, they absolutely are. There's no question about that. Look, the reality is it's one thing that traditional finance people are very good at. It's the ability to spot appreciation in capital assets or in digital assets. I'm kind of curious, as we talk a little bit about Olympic Dow, if you could give us a sense from the OHM token, what governance actually means here for people who may be relatively new to this. What's the significance of governance in a liquidity provision protocol? And how does it matter here specifically in DFI 2.0?
00:19:06.688 - 00:19:32.686, Speaker A: Well, governance is one of those things which is, unless you participated in it, it makes no sense at all. It's actually, you have a token, it grants you a right to vote on something. And you have these snapshots, these proposals that are put forward in Olympus, they're called OIPs. Every different protocol has its own thing, but they're very simple. Someone proposes something and pretty much anyone can propose, which is wonderful. As this protocol scales, then you start to get whitelisted.
00:19:32.718 - 00:19:35.314, Speaker B: People who can propose, but that's the beauty of it.
00:19:35.352 - 00:19:39.926, Speaker A: Anyone can propose something and people will vote with their tokens and it'll either.
00:19:39.948 - 00:19:43.090, Speaker B: Be passed or it won't. And if it's passed, then it's passed.
00:19:43.250 - 00:19:45.000, Speaker A: And so it will come to pass.
00:19:45.690 - 00:19:48.722, Speaker B: With Olympus, they're getting to the size.
00:19:48.796 - 00:20:03.514, Speaker A: Now where they have some serious heft. They actually have an enormous treasury. And the popularity of that protocol is such that they are starting to exert a kind of gravitational pull on other protocols such as curve, and that means.
00:20:03.552 - 00:20:07.454, Speaker B: That their governance is meaningful. On most protocols, it's probably not because.
00:20:07.492 - 00:20:14.062, Speaker A: Only about ten people vote anyway, but in something where you've got that amount of heft and it starts to get political, then the governance really matters.
00:20:14.126 - 00:20:17.374, Speaker B: And so those entities that have circulated.
00:20:17.422 - 00:20:21.406, Speaker A: And accumulated significant chunks of governance tokens.
00:20:21.438 - 00:20:23.074, Speaker B: And we've seen this play out in.
00:20:23.112 - 00:20:28.250, Speaker A: Curve, particularly where there's massive financial incentives to owning a big chunk of governance tokens.
00:20:28.350 - 00:20:32.518, Speaker B: It can have a huge effect, good or bad, on the health of the.
00:20:32.524 - 00:20:34.694, Speaker A: Protocol and the sentiment around the, you.
00:20:34.732 - 00:20:37.000, Speaker B: Know, we're talking about serious sums of money now.
00:20:37.630 - 00:20:40.922, Speaker A: Camilla, you covered this probably more than I have, in fact.
00:20:40.976 - 00:20:48.780, Speaker B: But have you seen governance working well across Defi protocols in general?
00:20:50.130 - 00:21:41.214, Speaker D: Honestly, I don't think it's working very well at this point. I think participation is. Well, I don't think I've seen participation is very low. I think double digits would be like an overstatement on the percentage of token voters who actually participate. And then tokens themselves are pretty concentrated too. You have VCs own large amounts of tokens and then concentrate a lot of voting power, and those vcs many times can't even participate because of their mandates. So like a 16 C, who owns most of DFI many times cannot be very active in governance at all.
00:21:41.214 - 00:22:26.006, Speaker D: So you have these kind of skewed incentives. I think one token, one vote is a very flawed mechanism because it creates this sort of plutocracy. Right? It's like people with the most money have the most power, and that's kind of the opposite of what we want to get to in crypto. So like I said before, I think there's a lot of experimentation going on. Dow or governance. Politicians is something that's coming up, which is like people who will vote professionally and represent smaller token holders. So I think that might be a good mechanism.
00:22:26.006 - 00:22:39.710, Speaker D: I think other structures like, I'm blanking on the name now. Maybe, Robin, you can help me. What gitcoin does with the grant.
00:22:40.770 - 00:22:42.218, Speaker A: The quadratic voting.
00:22:42.314 - 00:22:46.370, Speaker D: Yeah, quadratic voting, where you can basically.
00:22:46.440 - 00:22:53.954, Speaker A: Indicate your preferences rather than just the direction of your vote. It's something that Vitalik kind of proposed and they used it for that.
00:22:53.992 - 00:23:01.350, Speaker B: And it is a little bit, you know, it's, you know, voting in general is problematic.
00:23:02.170 - 00:23:05.618, Speaker A: Ash, what's your take on this? Do you think Daos are a load.
00:23:05.634 - 00:23:07.480, Speaker B: Of guff or is there something here?
00:23:08.010 - 00:24:15.178, Speaker C: Well, I think there is actually a great deal of promise in Dao. The idea of being able to do things in decentralized ways is fascinating. Talking about the defi aspect of it, it sounds a little bit to me like we're effectively recreating what we have in traditional finance, this sort of multiple structure where you have people who are owners of either the equity or the tokens, who then have basically delegates representing them in the governance thereof. It becomes a little bit indirect, it becomes a little bit diluted, and it sounds maybe more optimistic or promising than the actual reality of it is. We talk about these democratic ideals in DAOs, but the reality is you do see an enormous amount of concentration in the hands of the whales who are actually making these decisions in terms of the governance of these protocols. But I think the idea of dows, I know that we were talking a little bit off camera about Constitution DaO, about the DAO that's being assembled to buy an NBA team. I think it's easy, perhaps to be too cynical and dismissive of those efforts.
00:24:15.178 - 00:24:54.874, Speaker C: Obviously, they didn't win the auction for the US Constitution, a copy of the US Constitution. But I think that what we're seeing here, the idea of individuals being able to pool capital to do collective activities, collective ownership, is something that is going to be just a much larger part of this ecosystem going forward. That said, we have not yet seen regulators weigh in on those types of purchases. I imagine that's something that is coming. But the promise of this technology, I think, is immense, and I suspect that it will find a way to get some of these deals done. Whether it's the NBA team, probably not. In my view, that seems like it's probably a bridge too far.
00:24:54.874 - 00:25:13.310, Speaker C: There have been billionaires. They've tried to buy professional sports leagues for decades and haven't been able to do it. I don't think it happens this time around. But look, this is something that we're getting a glimpse into what the future looks like here, how it gets sorted out, how long it takes, very much open questions. In fact, I'm very curious to hear what you guys think of it. Cammie and Robin.
00:25:14.850 - 00:25:16.100, Speaker B: Cami, you go.
00:25:16.870 - 00:26:37.462, Speaker D: Well, yes. For all my qualms about Dao and decentralized governance not being there yet, I'm hugely excited and encouraged by constitution, Dao, and by the Dow movement in general, because I think the ability of coordinating capital and people globally is now the ability to do that is unprecedented. We've never been able to coordinate capital and people the way that we can now, thanks to this technology. And I think people are constitution, Dow failed, but it didn't fail in inspiring people. So I think that was kind of the main outcome of it. It sparked people's imagination, like, oh, these guys were able to crowdsource over $47 million in under a week from thousands of people all over the world and towards this kind of huge, lofty goal of buying a rare copy of the US constitution. So what else can we do? And so we see all these new projects springing up inspired by this constitution Dao and by the Dow movement.
00:26:37.462 - 00:27:44.462, Speaker D: So we have on the Defiant today something on Swartz Dao, which I think recently changed the name, but the idea of buying together academic papers to put them, to open them up to the public because they are often behind kind of these gated. Yeah, you're talking about an NBA team. Other people were talking about buying SeaWorld. So you have these crazy outlandish projects and ideas. But I think the underlying movement is that people are realizing you can now organize capital and people in a way that we just couldn't before. So now people are thinking, okay, so what can we do with all this now? And I think 2022 will be kind of the year of the Dow. It's kind of cliche to make those grand statements, but I really do think we'll see a lot of more of this activity in the coming months.
00:27:44.596 - 00:28:10.226, Speaker C: Yeah, Camilla, I think that's extremely well said. I don't know whether it's 2022 or 2025. I think two things are true. First, as you point out, this is an incredible opportunity for the ability to accumulate capital, and I think potentially, potentially to empower people on a sort of decentralized way to do things that they would never be able to do before. That said, I think it's extremely early. It's going to take a long time before we're able to get that done. But you said it perfectly.
00:28:10.226 - 00:28:12.810, Speaker C: I think the promise really is immense.
00:28:13.550 - 00:28:23.546, Speaker A: Well, I'm a Dow skeptic. I believe that people are fundamentally flaky and that if given the opportunity, they will run away when things get tough. So I am a bit of a skeptic.
00:28:23.738 - 00:28:25.854, Speaker B: I have a hard time with the.
00:28:25.892 - 00:28:28.414, Speaker A: Leadership aspect of dows because I feel.
00:28:28.452 - 00:28:31.406, Speaker B: Like you need leadership to pick up.
00:28:31.428 - 00:28:36.130, Speaker A: The pieces when the initial surge of excitement goes away. And constitution, Dow is a perfect example.
00:28:36.200 - 00:28:38.834, Speaker B: Of, oh, it's shiny, I'm in.
00:28:39.032 - 00:28:51.682, Speaker A: And then the kind of mess of unpicking what happened after that and running into the problem of refunding people who'd only put in a couple of $100, all of that was eaten up by gas fees. That's not constitution, Dow's fault.
00:28:51.746 - 00:28:59.606, Speaker B: It's just where we are in this phase. But I do have a genuine problem with the long term viability of pretty.
00:28:59.628 - 00:29:08.586, Speaker A: Much all Dows because I believe that kind of informal communities of people are fundamentally unsustainable. But that's just a personal thing. I would like to see where that.
00:29:08.608 - 00:29:10.298, Speaker B: Goes next and how DAos can be.
00:29:10.304 - 00:29:11.846, Speaker A: Accountable over the long term.
00:29:11.958 - 00:29:52.886, Speaker C: Robin, do you think that part of the interesting thing about it is talking about how early it is that with smart contracts in general, we have the ability to create these logical structures to enforce different types of different types of contracts. So that perhaps one of the terms of getting in is that you agree to commit your capital for X number of days. Maybe there's an early refunding fee. Maybe people are willing to make a secondary market in those early refunding claims. I mean, the potential to do things in this format seems virtually limitless. The devil is in the details and it's just extremely early. And it seems like we don't yet have the architecture, the infrastructure to do that yet, but it's just incredibly promising.
00:29:52.886 - 00:30:09.310, Speaker C: And the other point that I think you made that's incredibly important here is absolutely. I think that one of the limiting factors right now is the transaction fees. If you're putting in $500 and 25% of that is getting eaten up by gas fees, it's a much less sort of appealing proposition.
00:30:10.050 - 00:30:11.726, Speaker A: Well, there's definitely a degree to which.
00:30:11.828 - 00:30:14.686, Speaker B: For instance, the defiant could move to.
00:30:14.708 - 00:30:25.780, Speaker A: A Dow structure and it would open up the possibility of incentivizing people all around the world to contribute to a global idea of web three, unbiased journalism. And it's something we talk about all the time.
00:30:27.750 - 00:30:28.754, Speaker B: It's difficult.
00:30:28.872 - 00:30:30.726, Speaker A: I think that's the plain and simple truth of it.
00:30:30.748 - 00:30:33.382, Speaker B: Governance is messy. It just is.
00:30:33.516 - 00:30:34.934, Speaker A: And if you're okay with that mess.
00:30:34.972 - 00:30:39.846, Speaker B: And you're willing to kind of roll your sleeves up and get down and dirty with it, then I think it.
00:30:39.868 - 00:30:44.934, Speaker A: Can be incredibly rewarding. But I suspect most people don't have the stomach for that kind of protracted.
00:30:45.062 - 00:30:47.766, Speaker B: Engagement with dows and DaO protocols.
00:30:47.798 - 00:30:49.574, Speaker A: But I'm very happy to be proven.
00:30:49.622 - 00:30:50.974, Speaker B: Wrong on that front.
00:30:51.092 - 00:30:54.430, Speaker A: Tammy, any last thoughts on that from a defiant perspective?
00:30:54.850 - 00:31:57.780, Speaker D: Yeah. So I agree with you, Robin, that if you have this just like loose array of people contributing sometimes to an organization, that thing will fail. I think you do need leadership and you do need people committed full time, long term to a project. So I believe the way to make these organizations sustainable is to align incentives in such a way that you do have a committed managing structure that can kind of corral this group of global contributors and use them in a way that serves the organization itself. So I don't believe in kind of decentralization as an end. I believe in decentralization as a means, and decentralization should be a means to making a service or a product better. If it's not serving that product, then you don't use it.
00:31:57.780 - 00:32:20.626, Speaker D: I think maybe dows won't be good for every single organization, but maybe for some organizations it will make sense to open up and decentralize somewhat their structures. But I think you need some sort of leadership and a structure in place for things to get done to execute all these wild ideas.
00:32:20.818 - 00:32:23.574, Speaker A: So that is, as Yoda would say.
00:32:23.692 - 00:32:29.998, Speaker B: Brings us ready to thou or thou not, there is no try, and there we shall end.
00:32:30.044 - 00:32:42.762, Speaker A: My thanks to Ash Bennington from real vision and Camilla Russo from the defiant cameo. Can't wait to see the infinite machine, the movie, and we will see you on this next edition of real vision versus the Defiant.
00:32:42.826 - 00:32:43.420, Speaker B: Have a great week.
