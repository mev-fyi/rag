00:00:00.250 - 00:00:40.338, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Cammie, the founder of the Defiant. We're breaking our mold and doubling down on what makes the Defiant great. We launched our YouTube channel in July 2020 right in the middle of Defi summer. Since then, we've taken pride in creating the most daring and best produced videos in the space. Our goal to defiant across all our platforms is to deliver the best information focusing on the decentralized economy. It that's D five, NFTs, web three and all the economic activity that happens on chain. With all the noise and constant shilling in crypto, we want to be the voice you can trust to deliver the news clearly, objectively and following the highest journalistic standards.
00:00:40.434 - 00:01:00.714, Speaker B: You see, our goal has always been to educate newcomers and inform the veterans of our space about the puzzling world of crypto. And going forward we'll be focusing on this goal with more intensity. We're introducing new content, new formats, a brand new schedule and new presenters. So let's hear from the new faces of our channel. I'm Alex Gilbert. I'm a reporter at the Defiant. I'm Jack and I'm a presenter at the Defiant.
00:01:00.714 - 00:01:24.162, Speaker B: I'm Marvin Lanez, journalist at the Defiant. I'm Zarin Pranavik and I'm the video producer at the Defiant. For starters, the Monday quick takes are transforming into a daily show to make sure we keep you informed on the hottest news throughout the week. Hence the rebrand from QuickTake to daily Define. Also, don't worry, we hear you. Tutorials will be back with a new and improved format. Our podcast series is here to stay and we're experimenting with a new co host.
00:01:24.162 - 00:01:47.406, Speaker B: We're also introducing new shows starting with the weekly recaps coming to you live every Friday. Tune in to listen to the defiant writers come together to share insights and analysis about the week's headlines. Going forward. We will also keep you posted with the latest market movements. Expect charts, data and numbers here. And finally, we'll have a monthly special where we go back in time to investigate the biggest stories in detail, delivering a documentary style future video.
00:01:47.508 - 00:02:23.000, Speaker A: We're super excited with the direction of the channel. We're putting all our efforts into being more useful to you with news sold straight up, smart analysis, comprehensive explainers, big stories and big names, the defiant is driven by values that transcend any one single person. We believe the world will be increasingly decentralized and that blockchains will be the underlying infrastructure of the financial system and will add a value layer to the Internet. And we're confident we're the best place to tell this story. The defiant is all of us defierred who believe in these values and we thank you so much for your support.
00:02:24.010 - 00:02:39.950, Speaker B: So here it is. This is the new Defiant video squad. As Vitalik once said, to improve is to change. To. To be perfect is to change often. I'm kidding. That was actually Gary Gensler who, by the way, for his all intents and purposes is nothing more than a regulatory renting him.
00:02:39.950 - 00:02:46.570, Speaker B: In any case, thank you for supporting the Defiant. And if you're new here, consider subscribing. There's more to come. See you tomorrow.
