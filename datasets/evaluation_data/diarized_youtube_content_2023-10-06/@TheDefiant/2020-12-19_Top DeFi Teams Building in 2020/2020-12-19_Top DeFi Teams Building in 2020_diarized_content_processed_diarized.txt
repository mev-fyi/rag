00:00:02.730 - 00:01:21.830, Speaker A: What? Isn't that a clickbaity title to draw you in? Look, first off, there's no ranking for this order, but we did use DeFi, pulse's TVL or total value lots to guide, kind of how we identified the top teams as it's an easy metric to prove DeFi users not only use an app, but they're willing to trust the code with the money they deposit into the apps. So first off, we're looking at Kyber, the Lord of liquidity in DeFi. Now, Kyber is an unsung hero of DeFi, working in the background as an on chain liquidity protocol that lets token holders contribute liquidity. Next up, Zapper, and this is your all in one DeFi dashboard, where you can quickly zap into liquidity provisions in a few clicks with DFI, zaps and trade using their Dex aggregator, Zapper exchange. Loop ring is the fastest Dex currently built on L2 tech on Ethereum, enabling around 2000 transactions per second built on Ethereum, but it feels more like a centralized exchange trading engine. Didx now Didx is a d five darling project that goes back to 2017 with the most trade volume of any decentralized perpetuals market and decentralized margin trading exchange. So it's a derivatives exchange and the first decentralized one to appear on Ethereum.
00:01:21.830 - 00:02:25.446, Speaker A: Nexus Mutual is the godfather of DFI insurance, providing just under $250,000,000 in coverage for DFI users today on Ethereum. And if you're worried about hacks, well, this is the insurance policy you need. Instadap is a DFI Superman cape, empowering users to leverage flash loan recipes in a few clicks on Maker and compound. Ren protocol provides interoperability bridges, which have tokenized about $268,000,000 in BTC onto Ethereum in 2020 alone of the 1.36 billion tokenized BTC in total today. Balancer, launched just this year, is an automated market maker built on Ethereum, where anyone can create or add liquidity to customizable pools and earn trading fees, a huge innovation building upon Uniswap's initial success. Yearn Finance exploded onto the scene this summer, aiming to automate yield farming with a few clicks.
00:02:25.446 - 00:03:12.214, Speaker A: And yearn makes the most powerful strategies accessible to even newcomers. With a product called yvolts. Synthetics pioneered liquidity mining over a year ago. Before it was really a thing, and now we're just under $600 million in TVL. It offers onchain exposure to any asset, including commodities, forex indices, cryptocurrencies not on Ethereum and soon equities. That's right, you'll be able to buy synthetic stocks like Apple or Google on Synthetics exchange. Compound lets users earn interest or borrow assets against collateral, and compound basically kicked off this summer's DFI mania with their comp token launch, which popularized liquidity mining and introduced a whole new scene of yield.
00:03:12.214 - 00:04:07.162, Speaker A: Farmers other boasts $1.3 billion in TvL as today's leading lending and borrowing platform in DFI. And the team has a knack for creative marketing while offering new products like the ability to collateralize multiple crypto assets and borrow against the aggregate value versus maker, which only collateralizes one asset alone. Curve is the largest stablecoin liquidity pool, with over $1.2 billion in total value locked. And then maker, which is really still the OG of DFI with just under $2 billion locked or 3 million ETH in maker being collateralized to mint their decentralized stablecoin DAi and that now has a circulating supply of $860,000,000. And finally the top dog uniswap with over $2.3
00:04:07.162 - 00:04:44.420, Speaker A: billion in TVL, where anyone can quickly swap between ETH, then any ERC 20 token or earn fees by supplying any amount of liquidity. Now the key takeaway here is DFI is no longer some experimental niche community with over $11 billion in assets under protocol and growing daily. It's a vibrant, fast growing, unstoppable force, and you'd be best to learn about these projects sooner rather than later. You've been watching D 5101.
