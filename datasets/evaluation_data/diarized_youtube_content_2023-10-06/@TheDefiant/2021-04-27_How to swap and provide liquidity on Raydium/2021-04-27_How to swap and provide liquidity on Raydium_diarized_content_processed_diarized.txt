00:00:00.330 - 00:00:33.014, Speaker A: Okay, so it's Tuesday and it's time for a tutorial and, well, time for a confession as well, because yesterday we tried to record a different tutorial. We did it three times. We failed three times. And it just goes to show that sometimes you try things and they are just not destined to work. What we tried to do was use the Solana wormhole bridge to send USDC from Ethereum to Solana. And the reason we wanted to do that was because was we wanted to try the bridge. Bridges are going to be a fundamental piece of infrastructure in the interconnected world of blockchain in the future.
00:00:33.014 - 00:00:50.374, Speaker A: We've looked at the Polygon bridge, which worked. It was slow, but it worked. I tried the wormhole bridge on Solana yesterday. It also worked, except up to the point where we needed to get an Ethereum transaction mined. I did this yesterday.
00:00:50.502 - 00:00:52.758, Speaker B: 24 hours later, we are still waiting.
00:00:52.774 - 00:00:55.374, Speaker A: For the ETH transaction to be mined. And it's worth having a look at this.
00:00:55.412 - 00:01:20.226, Speaker B: We all know the feeling of paying high fees and waiting for transactions to confirm when interacting with DFI. Well, no more. Solana has built a fast, censorship resistant blockchain where you can build and use crypto apps that scale. Today, the network supports thousands of transactions per second with fees less than a cent and over 500 validators. To learn more, head over to Salana.com defiant to get started building and join.
00:01:20.258 - 00:01:21.718, Speaker A: Its rapidly expanding community.
00:01:21.804 - 00:01:24.850, Speaker B: And this week is Solana Week on the Defiant.
00:01:24.930 - 00:02:06.930, Speaker A: I'm not going to post what we did yesterday. It was a painful, painful process of just figuring out how to do this thing. And it's not because any of it's specifically difficult. It's just some things are just not ready yet. And I think for something like the wormhole bridge, there is a consumer facing website where you can bridge assets. But for you and me, that's not how we're ever going to interact with these protocols. I'm actually looking at something like Anyswap, which is a cross chain Dex that at the moment allows you to swap between BTC, between all sorts of different chains like fusion.
00:02:06.930 - 00:02:25.882, Speaker A: And Solana is going to be plugged into this. We've got Phantom in there as well. What's going to be running underneath that are bridges. There's actually a tab which says bridge. And these bridges are amazing. They're just clunky as at the moment. And the wormhole bridge was no different.
00:02:25.882 - 00:02:44.690, Speaker A: We built the bridge at Harmony. It was clunky. We used the polygon bridge, little bit clunky every single time. It's the east side of the bridge that trips us up. And so that tutorial went straight in the bin. So today we're going to look at a different tutorial. A lot of what we were talking about is relevant, though.
00:02:44.690 - 00:03:14.254, Speaker A: So we start like this. Yesterday we looked at Coin Gecko, and we looked at where Salana is, number 15 in the chart. Quick look at coin Gecko. This doesn't look so impressive. But if you look at the 90 day or even the 180 day, something is going on here that's propelling Salana upwards and upwards and upwards. And it's not pump and dump, that's for sure. There is a burgeoning, growing level of support in this ecosystem, what it's doing, and primarily in DFI.
00:03:14.254 - 00:03:42.926, Speaker A: My light has gone off where I kind of hang my hat. There's some really interesting things going on. We're going to cover those in detail towards the end of the week. There's a lot to unpick here, not least of which is the proposal for building out Sushiswap on Solana, which is currently being voted on. That involves radium, which is the first amm built on Solana. We're going to jump into that in just a second. We have the wormhole bridge, and we have, obviously, serum, which comes from Sam Bankman fried.
00:03:42.926 - 00:04:29.138, Speaker A: It's a decentralized derivatives exchange. And the way that that ecosystem works, genuinely very, very interesting. That brings us back to radium. Radium is an amm. When you look at the interface, it looks exactly like uniswap. What's the biggie? Well, the interesting thing about the Solana ecosystem is that you have this central order book built on serum, and that basically means that serum processes orders, and serum is also connected to FTX. I won't go into how it's connected to FTX because that's for Friday's video, but it essentially means that if you have an amm, an automated market maker like uniswap, but it's built on Solana, then those amms can provide liquidity to that central order book.
00:04:29.138 - 00:05:14.398, Speaker A: And that means that every amm is not competing with every other amm. So you remember that situation with Uniswap where Sushiswap came along, vampire protocol style, just sucked liquidity directly from Uniswap. That's not what happens in this ecosystem. Anything that provides liquidity is providing it both to this central order book and to all the other liquidity that's sitting around the ecosystem. That is quite a big deal. So you have this enormous plate of different amms, each with their own token, and everyone can kind of jump in and do their thing on that amm. But all of that liquidity is serving everybody else in the ecosystem, and that makes it very, very interesting.
00:05:14.398 - 00:05:46.806, Speaker A: And I don't quite fully understand how it all works yet, so I'm still trying to figure it out. So rather than doing a wormhole bridge tutorial, I thought we'd do a radium tutorial. That gives us a chance to look into the various wallets that you can use for Solana and get into some of the things I discovered while looking into this. So, generally, when we're looking to interact with a Dex, because radium has a Dex facility in there, it does a bunch of other stuff that you'd be familiar with. Liquidity pools, farming, staking, this kind of thing, and some trading as well. There you go. There's the trading interface.
00:05:46.806 - 00:06:31.638, Speaker A: We're going to be looking at some swapping and some pools, and then probably staking if we can get it to work. It's been a little bit clunky today because of my Internet, for some reason, I think they're building downstairs. But anyway, what we're going to look at now is what wallets you can use, why I would pick the particular wallet that I've used, and why there might be another wallet coming. That's better. And then we'll get into actually using radium itself, and then we'll try and figure out just how fast this thing actually is. One last thing to point out is that what I wanted to do yesterday was use the wormhole bridge to send some USDC over to the Solana blockchain, and then do my work with that on Solana with the USDC that I'd sent over. It just didn't work out that way.
00:06:31.638 - 00:06:59.218, Speaker A: So what I had to do was go to binance, buy some Solana tokens, and then send those to a wallet that I set up yesterday. I'll jump into that later. But fundamentally, when I do these tutorials, I'm always trying to do it in a decentralized way. We are a Defi channel. Decentralized finance means decentralized. If we're using a centralized exchange to do this, then, yes, it's fast and it's convenient, but we're not actually true to the philosophy. With all that said, let's get into it.
00:06:59.218 - 00:07:41.790, Speaker A: So just breaking down what radium is, it's an amm. It's essentially a uniswap, but with some differences, and it serves the serum central order book. So you see here, redding provides on chain liquidity to a central limit order book, meaning that pools have access to all order flow and liquidity on serum ecosystem wide liquidity. Such a big idea. And it is the governing philosophy behind all the defi activities on Solana, which is why it is interesting. Obviously, Solana's great appeal, fast cheap, as the token price goes up, though, becomes slightly less cheap. But still, it's a fast, cheap chain.
00:07:41.790 - 00:08:14.038, Speaker A: So far, so good. So what we need to do first is set up a Solana wallet. And there are a few different ways to do that. And generally what I tend to do is if you go to, let's go, for instance, to the serum dex, this is just how you might do this. When you connect to a dex, you need to connect a wallet. And when we ask to connect to serum, it gives us a bunch of options. So here we have solit ledger, Solong, phantom.
00:08:14.038 - 00:08:49.830, Speaker A: There's one that's not listed here, which is soulflare, which is another Solana wallet. And the ones I'm particularly interested in are solit, which has a chrome extension, and Solong, which also has a chrome extension. When I was doing my research, I landed on Solong for one simple reason. When I added the solong chrome extension and I set up a wallet, this is how I did it. So it's sitting there. What I generally do is I click on this jigsaw puzzle piece here, and I pin that extension so it just sits there and I can use it. Now, we set up a wallet usual way.
00:08:49.830 - 00:09:19.230, Speaker A: First we do a password, something nice and memorable. Then we want to do create wallet. I'm going to call it tutorial, actually tutorial two for today, we get some seed phrases. I'm going to just make a note of those. So if I ever have to come back, I can. So I've noted those down and saved. All good.
00:09:19.230 - 00:09:43.942, Speaker A: Make sure you save your seed phrase somewhere good. And always make a backup. If you're actually going to do some more valuable, larger transactions and activity, always back it up. So now we have a salana wallet. Very, very simple. When I was doing this, the first time I did it, the test that I did, there was a button that came up here and it said, show me the money, show me the money. So I clicked on it.
00:09:43.942 - 00:10:25.790, Speaker A: In that instance, I got sent zero, one sol. Now, if you remember, when we did the Polygon bridge, we were actually given some matic tokens the moment we crossed the bridge, which allowed us to get started. It gave you some Solana. It gave us some matic tokens that we were able to power some transactions with on Solana. In this particular wallet, if I want to add a token, let's say I want to add USDC, for instance, if I click add USD coin, it will tell me I do not have enough soul to take this action. So it costs a little bit of soul to add a token. I don't know why it wouldn't cost that on Ethereum, but for some reason it does.
00:10:25.790 - 00:11:13.220, Speaker A: Which meant that when I was trying to do my activities yesterday, I couldn't actually power anything even when I'd set up the wallet. So my recommendation would be, and I can't believe I'm saying this, get hold of some Sol on an exchange like Binance wherever Solana is traded, if you need to know where it's traded, just go to the markets page on Coingecko and it will give you a list of exchanges. And it looks like it's very nicely supported. Binance, OKX, FTX of course, Huobi heavily supported project and lots of different places you can buy it. So I would imagine most people have a finance account. You might not, but if you do, that's the place to get it and then at least you can kind of get started. Wow, it's trading at $45.
00:11:13.220 - 00:11:42.160, Speaker A: Wow. So I'm actually now going to log into the wallet that I set up yesterday, but well worth trying so long. Because if you get the same thing as me and you manage to get some free Salana just to power some transactions, that'd be good, I think. 0.1. Yeah, it's like $0.45, but still, it's enough to get you going. So I'm now just going to log into my wallet that I had before.
00:11:43.330 - 00:12:06.786, Speaker B: And remember your first DeFi transaction. After juggling five plus tabs on your browser, you gazed at that ether scan confirmation feeling like you just contributed to the future of finance. Except you got quickly lost in a world of gas prices, vaults, pools, hard forks, degens and sushi chefs. Fear not, Xerion has built the dream.
00:12:06.818 - 00:12:08.450, Speaker A: Tool for managing your portfolio.
00:12:08.530 - 00:12:37.226, Speaker B: Track all of your token balances across wallets and chains, access every kind of defi asset, including indexes, pools, and yield strategies, and trade at the cheapest rates with no extra fees. And that's because Xerion sources liquidity from every decentralized exchange like uniswap, zero, X and Oneinch. And there's no sign up required, no fees, and a blissfully easy Ui. Simply connect your wallet at App Zion IO now back to the tutorial.
00:12:37.338 - 00:13:05.938, Speaker A: Okay, I'm back in. So now I have a separate wallet that I set up yesterday that has five sol in there. It also has these strange tokens here. These are 50 USDC that I sent from Ethereum over to Salana. And for some reason, one piece of the translation hasn't happened. Or maybe it has happened, but there are 50 tokens in there that it can't read that are in fact USDC, but it hasn't spat them out the right way. I will need to talk to the team at Salana about what's happened here and how I could do it differently.
00:13:05.938 - 00:13:44.434, Speaker A: But for the moment, I would recommend against using the wormhole bridge for now, unless you really know what you're doing. Didn't really work for me. Doesn't mean it's bad. It just means I didn't understand it. So now we have five Sol, and what I want to do is go to the radium swap, and the plan now is to add some liquidity to one of the pools. So I think I'm going to do the ray Sol pool. So if you're familiar with adding liquidity, you need equal amounts of two tokens or however many tokens are in the pool, and then you can make it work.
00:13:44.434 - 00:14:02.458, Speaker A: So the first thing we need to do is connect the wallet. And so now we have some options here. I don't know, Bonfida, but they are working with radium. I think they're listed on the radium page. Let's go down here. If I saw them. Yes, they're listed here.
00:14:02.458 - 00:14:26.594, Speaker A: So the one we want, obviously, is Solong. This one here, phantom, is very, very interesting. I'll be doing a first look on Phantom tomorrow because this is a brand new one. This sort of appears to be the great hope for the Solana ecosystem. A wallet that can do all sorts of cool things. But for now, we're just going to click on Solong. Oh, yeah.
00:14:26.594 - 00:14:30.740, Speaker A: We need to refresh the page, and then we can come back and it will work.
00:14:31.830 - 00:14:34.894, Speaker B: Don't let high gas costs keep you out of Ethereum.
00:14:34.942 - 00:14:35.438, Speaker A: A balancer.
00:14:35.454 - 00:15:02.166, Speaker B: You can trade all you want and get most of the gas costs back in your pocket. In their new ball for gas campaign, traders are receiving six figures worth of ball tokens every week. And with version two, Balancer is becoming the one stop shop for DFI liquidity balancer version two brings stable pools and weighted pools tightly integrated under a single protocol. Flash loans, lending via asset managers, and much more. Check it out at balancer Finance.
00:15:02.358 - 00:15:24.494, Speaker A: So now we can just say, yes, please connect, I want to confirm. And now we're in. So now the Dex can read my wallet. So what we're going to do is we're going to add some liquidity to one of the pools. And the one I'm going to pick is probably the sole USD pool, which is this one. And in order to do so, I need to get hold of some USDC. The first thing we're going to do is do a swap.
00:15:24.494 - 00:16:03.126, Speaker A: So I'm going to swap from Sol to USDC and I'm just going to do a small amount, 2.5 sol to 112 USDC. And if you're wondering why I'm doing such small amounts, well, it's kind of this. The point of a permissionless open financial system is to allow anybody, no matter how large your stack, to join in. It shouldn't just be for the big boys. So if the fees are low enough and the chain is fast enough, then it should be very attractive to do so. So we're going to swap between two and a half, Sol and USDC.
00:16:03.126 - 00:16:29.590, Speaker A: We click on swap, we confirm, and then we wait. Transaction has been confirmed. So we swapped two and a half, sold to 112 USDC. Now, does it show up in the wallet? Yes, it does. So there we have USDCoin 113. So now we're ready to add some liquidity to the pool. So now we just need to go and check which pool we were going to add liquidity to.
00:16:29.590 - 00:17:06.146, Speaker A: So I'm going to use Sol, USDC, and just need to make sure that I balance up the size of the equation. So what I'm actually going to do is click on Max, on USDC, and that will give me exactly the right amount of Sol tokens that I need as well. And now I can click on supply. Always remember that you need a little bit of the native token like Sol to power transactions. You should never run it down to zero, otherwise you'll be stuck. And it's quite hard to do a transaction without any liquidity in your wallet. So we will confirm that transaction.
00:17:06.146 - 00:17:22.460, Speaker A: Transaction has been sent. Should be pretty fast. Transaction has been confirmed. Add liquidity. So now we have LP tokens that represent USDC and Sol. I wonder if they show up in the wallet. They may do, they may not.
00:17:22.460 - 00:17:53.582, Speaker A: No, can't see them there. So now I should be able to stake them. Let's see. Is there a Sol USDC? No, there isn't. Well, I guess that's probably as far as the journey goes for now. If I'd picked ray USDC for instance. I could have added some liquidity in here and staked some LP tokens.
00:17:53.582 - 00:18:31.434, Speaker A: I haven't, which is fine if you wanted to, then that would be the place to do it. So it looks like only the ray pairs are the ones that you can farm on radium. So maybe in a future tutorial we'll do that. But if you wanted to add those LP tokens to a farm and start generating those rewards as well, then you could do looking at the Apr 100 and 6150. That's pretty attractive once you start getting down here. Not so. And Defi is somewhere you're looking at kind of four figure percentages.
00:18:31.434 - 00:19:13.914, Speaker A: Absolutely wild stuff. Will we see those days again? Part of me thinks that we might well do. I'm not sure when, not sure how, but very, very interesting. Anyway, so that's basically how to use radium. What I'm very excited for though is any swap, this cross chain Dex, and how all these bridges will be able to swing tokens from one chain to another. You know, it's going to be clunky to begin with, but there is going to be so much potential to open up liquidity right across the entire blockchain space so that those who are really hunting arbitrage opportunities or really hunting farming opportunities will have the complete buffet to feastome. Very, very exciting.
00:19:13.914 - 00:19:33.998, Speaker A: So tomorrow we will be looking at the phantom wallet the first time. That was my first time really kind of playing with Solana. It's pretty cool. I want to dig in further and do more with it, but yeah, there you go. That's radium. So if you have any suggestions for tutorials for next week, please leave them in the comments below. Until next time.
00:19:33.998 - 00:19:35.120, Speaker A: See ya.
