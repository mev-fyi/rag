00:00:21.690 - 00:00:55.710, Speaker A: Hi, everyone, and welcome to another episode of the defiant weekly recap with part of our print team. I'm Camirusso, the founder. We have YYC Trader, head of news, and Owen, one of our staff reporters. So welcome, everyone. We'll be here discussing the main headlines of this week. Everything important that went on in D five, web three and crypto. So some of the main story were Coinbase suing the SEC to get clear answers on crypto regulations.
00:00:55.710 - 00:01:36.040, Speaker A: Markets were lower this week as the Chappella hype kind of faded. Rocket pool is seeing a rise in adoption thanks to its mini pools and the cosmos community is voting on its shared security model. So those are just some of the headlines we'll cover. And, yeah, let's start with Coinbase. I think that's the biggest story this week. Let me just share our story that we did. Sorry, sharing screen here.
00:01:36.040 - 00:02:40.154, Speaker A: There we go. Okay, so. So what happened was that Coinbase is suing the SEC because it's just pushing for clarity for crypto. As you all know, this has been a common theme that we've been covering here on this podcast and in the defiant. Broadly, there is a lot of regulatory uncertainty in the US and the SEC, the main agency tasked with regulating securities, is just refusing to provide clear guidelines on crypto. So Coinbase, the biggest exchange in the US, filed this action, which follows a petition that it made in July. So the SEC never replied to that July petition.
00:02:40.154 - 00:03:57.426, Speaker A: So Coinbase is suing it because it didn't reply to. So, you know, this is just the latest step on this ongoing battle, if you want to call it that, between the SEC and Coinbase. Earlier this year, in March, the SEC issued Coinbase a wealth notice. So this is this letter that is basically telling Coinbase that the SEC is preparing to sue. We reported on this. This case between Coinbase and the SEC is said to be the defining case of the crypto era because it would answer the main question that is at the core of the issue in kind of crypto regulations in the US, which is, what is a security like, which cryptocurrencies are securities, which aren't, which are commodities, which are something else, potentially. So in March, there was this wealth notice by the SEC.
00:03:57.426 - 00:05:21.700, Speaker A: So there is this lawsuit, this separate lawsuit and legal fight coming between Coinbase and the SEC. And then this week, separately, Coinbase just went ahead and sued the SEC, asking for regulatory clarity. And this comes on the back of, obviously, as we've covered this rising crackdown or tension with US regulators and crypto, there was Gary Gensler the SEC chair, testifying before Congress, where it just became blatantly clear that he just does not want to provide any clarity other than saying all tokens can be securities, but without specifying what makes them securities, which tokens are securities, which aren't. As we covered last week, he refused to even say whether ether was a security or not. So anyways, here's the crypto industry just pushing for clarity while the SEC refuses to give that. The argument is that the rules are there. We don't need new rules for crypto, and crypto just needs to comply and fall in.
00:05:21.700 - 00:05:41.530, Speaker A: That's, that's the biggest story, again, a regulation story kind of making headlines. What did you guys think of this? Where's this all going? Is crypto going to be banned in the US? Are we going to have to move the defined HQ to Dubai?
00:05:46.190 - 00:06:28.600, Speaker B: I can't speak to all that. I will say one piece of news that did cross the headlines on the regulatory front was that there's a new bill in California which would regulate dows as a form of a nonprofit. I'm pulling it up right now. I guess like an unincorporated nonprofit association is the technical term of the entity. Anyways, it's not all anti crypto legislation that's happening. And so we don't have a story out yet. But I did talk to the GC at a 16 z who helped work on the bill.
00:06:28.600 - 00:07:25.946, Speaker B: Basically, they're offering a way for dows to register in California, which would potentially provide legal protection for participants. It's not for all daos. I think there are certain situations where it makes sense and not. But Miles Jennings, who is the GC at a 16 Z, said that your uniswaps were uniswap be able to register. Given this bill passes, it could potentially protect Dow participants from having unlimited liability. And I think we're seeing that with, I think it was like the BZX case. I think people are trying to figure out how liable you are if you're participating in a dow for the mean.
00:07:25.946 - 00:07:45.182, Speaker B: It's just kind of interesting that there is a push on the state level to provide clarity about dows. So it's kind of interesting that people are on the other, and specifically, the language of the bill addresses the lack of clarity for crypto regulation. So anyways, interesting action happening at the state level, which we.
00:07:45.236 - 00:08:07.414, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, super interesting. Didn't know about that bill or push in California. I think there is something similar in Wyoming. Wyoming is also supposed to be just a good place to incorporate or operate. Dallas, I understand yeah, I think, I think so.
00:08:07.452 - 00:08:17.100, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm not sure whether this pushes the ball forward or it's just my California bias that it's an assembly member from San Francisco pushing it through. That made me enthusiastic about.
00:08:20.430 - 00:08:48.774, Speaker A: I mean, it would be amazing if California became more pro crypto. I mean, there's so many startups and investors based there that it would make mean California is more kind of Democrat leaning. Right. And Democrats are usually more. So, you know, that'd be interesting to see if it goes the other.
00:08:48.972 - 00:08:55.366, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It'll be interesting to watch. Maybe make a trip up to Sacramento when they debate it. So we'll see.
00:08:55.548 - 00:09:30.018, Speaker C: It seems like a good step, but how do you call most? Like most dows won't fit the definition of a nonprofit. Right. Most dows are for profit. Like you want your tokens value to go up. I could see cases where they're like volunteer kind of know, or public goods or stuff like that. For know that bill could work, but like uniswap, for example. Like, you mean uni token holders are in it for profit? They're not just looking to govern.
00:09:30.018 - 00:09:30.690, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:30.840 - 00:10:47.546, Speaker B: Yeah, I actually asked him about that and he said that there's a way in which you can, it was kind of a nuanced argument, which I don't think I could replicate. And I don't know if it really holds water, but I think in a straightforward, you're getting dividends way, it's not going to work. But he, but he, he was saying like, if you get extra, if, if it's like used to give you to boost rewards on an lp position or something like that, there may be ways to kind of, I can't make the argument in a sophisticated way, but I did ask that question, and he did seem to think that there are ways where you can profit in a way that allows you to essentially be a nonprofit. And I think that has to do with the nuances of what actions are incentivized with the token. But I had the same question. I was like, yeah, many dows are trying to make money, so I should pull on that string a little more. I'll have to go back to the interview, but it's a good point.
00:10:47.728 - 00:10:52.846, Speaker C: Yeah. Looking forward to seeing the story. And we should have that out for the weekend, right?
00:10:52.948 - 00:10:53.600, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:56.130 - 00:11:05.700, Speaker A: All right. Okay, guys, stay tuned. Let's turn to markets. YYC. What happened? What was going on this week?
00:11:06.950 - 00:12:01.666, Speaker C: Quite a few factors, actually. Well, for one thing, Chappella turned out, like most of Ethereum's major upgrades, to be a sell the news kind of event. Right. So we had prices run up quite sharply into the upgrade, which happened, what, 1012 days ago now? ETH peaked around 2100, just a couple of days after the upgrade. And, yeah, since then it's been kind of a steady sell off. And yesterday we had very weird price action. Was it yesterday or two days ago where there was an apparent alert that went out saying that the US government's bitcoin is on the move and the market cracked, I think, almost 6% in a matter of an hour.
00:12:01.666 - 00:13:18.780, Speaker C: And then Arkham intelligence, which was the platform that put out that alert or said that the system was functioning properly, but it was not anywhere near as big as social media made it out to be. And, yeah, we saw a little bit of a bounce back. And I think some of the euphoria from the upgrade, like, it's done, it went through successfully. I think if it hadn't, yeah, we'd see a lot more kind of volatility. But for the time being, I think it's just like a bout of profit taking. And on the macro front, we had a couple of weak pieces of data from the US, both in terms of employment and the GDP numbers. So stock markets have kind of rallied on that news, basically looking ahead to the Fed meeting in five days, thinking that, okay, economy is softening, so the Fed is more likely to maybe pause, or even though the consensus is for a 25 basis point hike with the first Republic bank also now on the ropes, it's anyone's guess, to be honest.
00:13:18.780 - 00:14:17.214, Speaker C: It's a coin toss, in my opinion, which is why we haven't seen too much of angst from the markets, as we usually see leading into the Fed, because people think, oh, the hike's coming, so let's front run and sell before other people do. Anyway, to sum it all up, this is, of course, my personal opinion. I think we're just seeing some profit taking after a solid run up that we had in the first quarter. But that being said, I still think we have a little bit of unfinished business to the upside before sell in May. And that whole narrative takes over because too many people are talking about it, I think. And it's like when everyone thinks the same way, the market seldom complies, right? We do the opposite. So we might see a bit more of a run into May and then summer volatility is like we see it every year.
00:14:17.214 - 00:14:18.400, Speaker C: So let's see.
00:14:20.610 - 00:14:36.020, Speaker A: Why does that happen? Why does it sell in May? Go away? What is it? Is it just people getting their stuff in order before taking off for summer break or what's the rest?
00:14:37.050 - 00:15:35.974, Speaker C: Volumes always dry off in the summer, right. That's like people on holiday and bank and Hamptons, and there's enough memes about it. So generally from the end of May, to say late August is like a lull in trading, which sometimes leads to excessive volatility because there are fewer participants, less liquidity, et cetera, et cetera. So crypto has actually been kind of decoupling from equities of late this year, at least like I said, the S and P is pushing local highs, but crypto still hasn't kind of picked up. And I think one factor behind that is the dollar because it's been kind of trying to find a bottom for the last week or so. So I think crypto is kind of waiting to see which way it breaks because it follows the dollar more than it does equities, in my opinion. Right.
00:15:35.974 - 00:15:41.610, Speaker C: Because everything's priced in dollars. So inverse relationship usually holds.
00:15:45.070 - 00:15:56.522, Speaker A: But then macro wise, are we in the kind of bad news is good news phase? It's like economy.
00:15:56.586 - 00:17:03.598, Speaker C: I think we have been for the last year and a half, but we never got the bad news. The economy was strong, the jobs numbers kept getting stronger and stronger despite the hikes, and inflation just refused to come down. And even GDP, I think last quarter's numbers were like three, 4% or something ridiculous, right? So we're finally seeing the effects of a year of high interest rates, I think biting into the economy. Of course, too early to tell because it's just one data point, but yeah, a lot of people like the, I wouldn't say the consensus estimate, but a lot of traders who I follow do feel that we're hitting the peak of this interest rate cycle. So it might be just this may hike and that's it. And then they might keep it at that level for a while, but then the next move is going to be down, is what people are thinking. Because as we've seen, banks can't handle these rates.
00:17:03.598 - 00:17:14.520, Speaker C: Right. It's the small ones that are getting beaten up right now. But the longer it stays this way, it's going to move up the food chain. And I don't think that's something that the Fed wants.
00:17:15.530 - 00:17:45.440, Speaker A: So do you think, you know, it's having trouble? Do you think more of these banking failures or crises? Would the market take that as ironically? Would they take it well? Would it just be a sign that, okay, the Fed's probably going to look at this and say, enough with the hike. The banking sector can't take this.
00:17:47.990 - 00:18:04.294, Speaker C: It depends on the size of the domino, to be honest. Right. If it's another first republic or signature or what have you, these are like pennies. If it's another Lehman level or like Credit Suisse or one of things. Yeah. That's going to mess everything up. Right?
00:18:04.412 - 00:18:05.382, Speaker A: Yeah, of course.
00:18:05.436 - 00:18:25.600, Speaker C: And there's so many mid tier banks in the US that you never hear of until something goes wrong. Right. Because banking system or the financial industry in the US is so massive, to be honest. So you never know where the next hit comes from.
00:18:28.450 - 00:18:36.420, Speaker B: I really want a macro lock right now, but I don't know. I haven't been thinking about macro lately, so I appreciate your insights while I see.
00:18:36.870 - 00:18:43.460, Speaker C: Yeah, man, we've just been watching, like, number go up, meme coins. Having fun after a long time.
00:18:44.070 - 00:18:44.820, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:46.330 - 00:18:51.830, Speaker A: What's the latest with our meme coin coverage? Anything new happen?
00:18:51.980 - 00:18:52.680, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:53.290 - 00:18:54.466, Speaker A: Is that dead?
00:18:54.658 - 00:18:57.830, Speaker B: I don't know. The sophisticated world of meme coins.
00:18:58.410 - 00:19:12.906, Speaker C: So there was a coin called Bob that launched yesterday or a couple of days ago, and they tweeted something and Elon replied to them saying, I love Bob, or something like that. And it shot up like 300 x. Oh, my God.
00:19:13.008 - 00:19:36.886, Speaker B: That's like ten year old level stuff. I'm sorry, I don't know if you guys remember, but there's a time in fifth grade when everyone loves that name for some reason. I don't even want to say it because it's so cringe to me, but everyone loves saying Bob. And I taught it at summer camp. No, I taught it at summer camp. And then you're introducing yourself and half of the kids will say their name is Bob, like all the ten year old boys. I don't know.
00:19:36.908 - 00:19:37.880, Speaker A: It's just a thing.
00:19:38.650 - 00:19:41.430, Speaker B: I don't know. Maybe it's a California thing.
00:19:41.580 - 00:19:45.270, Speaker A: I don't know. Wow. I did not know that.
00:19:45.420 - 00:19:47.960, Speaker B: Yeah, there's some.
00:19:48.830 - 00:20:28.134, Speaker A: We had some good meme coin coverage on our YouTube, too, so you guys should check it out. Trade any coin safely in five. Know, just some tips to at least avoid scams and getting rugged. And then know the latest meme coins that popped up in the last few days. Somebody's saying we love Bob. Okay, so, yeah, I guess a meme coin trend isn't totally dead yet. Yeah, still some popping up.
00:20:28.252 - 00:20:33.400, Speaker B: Yeah. Pepe is still above 100 million, which is funny. So see how that goes.
00:20:33.850 - 00:20:47.770, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Okay. Now onto more serious business. Owen, can you catch us up on what happened in the defi world, starting with rocket pool?
00:20:48.190 - 00:21:58.110, Speaker B: Sure. Okay, so high level we have seen deposits in rocket pool, which is the ETH liquid staking derivative protocol, where basically you deposit ETH and you get back out a token which represents that ETH as staked. So you're gaining the rewards, and then you have a token r ETH, which you take around, and you have the best of both worlds. You can use it around DFI while it's also accruing yield. So that increased 11% just since April 17, which is, what? Like ten days ago, thanks to them switching their quote unquote mini pools from 16 ETH to eight ETH in terms of requirements for what people need to deposit. And if you don't know, you need 32 ETH to run a validator yourself. So basically, they're lowering the barrier to entry to participate as a mini pool operator.
00:21:58.110 - 00:22:41.834, Speaker B: And that is obviously going well, considering the increase, which is kind of. It's interesting to just see that this sounds very obvious, but the cost of staking or doing these kind of staking adjacent activities is prohibitive. Right. Like, there's a lot of demand for people who don't have 16 e to stake but want to stake eight. Yeah, that's a high level. A lot of chatter about. Which has been happening for a while, about staked ETH kind of taking over as a base pair in the ecosystem, which is, again, because it's the best of both worlds.
00:22:41.834 - 00:23:31.162, Speaker B: Why would you, if you could be a liquidity provider with staked ETH and die, rather than just straight up ETH, you'd probably rather use the staked one. So I've seen a lot of chatter about that. It'll be interesting in that way to see which pair ends up as the base pair, if any. I think there's kind of going to be a big battle about what is the base pair and trying to become a base pair competitive with ETH. Is it going to be our ETH? It probably could be some meta. I know index co op had a diversified, has a token which represents many different versions of staked ETH. So maybe it'll be some kind of fusion of a lot of them wrapped up in one token.
00:23:31.162 - 00:23:46.262, Speaker B: Maybe it won't happen at all. But anyways, that's a narrative. I've seen that staked ETH is kind of still making its way to become like a more, I don't know, foundational piece used in Defi. So we'll see how that goes.
00:23:46.316 - 00:24:13.902, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. And there are so many new ones coming in, too. Like stator is launching ethx, which will let you run a node with four ETH, right. So I believe that's just around the corner. Ether Phi, which is backed by Arthur Hayes, is launching main net in like four or five days. And then we have swell, which is another one. So, yeah, I totally agree.
00:24:13.902 - 00:24:50.970, Speaker C: That obviously makes sense to use staked ETH as your base asset rather than regular ETH just because you earn yield, so why not? But yeah, it's going to be a big battle, and I think it'll come down to liquidity and who can kind of get incorporated into as many protocols as possible. I mean, stake teeth kind of has the advantage there because first mover and already kind of on many chains, but they haven't expanded as aggressively as I would have expected them to. So I think the others still have a good shot.
00:24:51.710 - 00:25:08.400, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw the guy who left Euler took a job at Lido to handle pushing staked ETH on Binance chain. I thought that was interesting. So just a little tidbit of personnel moving around.
00:25:09.410 - 00:25:17.970, Speaker C: Yeah. And Binance is launching a staked ETH liquid staking token. Who'd have thought, right?
00:25:18.120 - 00:25:20.142, Speaker B: Centralized, like through their exchange.
00:25:20.286 - 00:25:26.450, Speaker C: Yeah, they do staking on behalf of users. Right? So they're issuing like CBe kind of.
00:25:26.520 - 00:25:41.190, Speaker B: Yeah. Everyone loves that business model. Is that just like everyone just wants to take a fee? Like just take a portion of the staking rewards and it's just like a pretty simple fee business once people give you your ETH.
00:25:41.610 - 00:26:06.080, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess. So. Obviously they have to find node operators and et cetera and those costs. But I'm not sure whether Binance runs their own nodes or they outsource it to someone else potentially. But, yeah, I guess it must be a profitable business if every exchange is kind of getting into it. Except Kraken, of course. They had to.
00:26:07.090 - 00:26:12.526, Speaker B: Yeah, but they wouldn't stop if they didn't feel like they needed. Yeah.
00:26:12.708 - 00:26:35.946, Speaker C: Which also tells you that the fee income must not have been substantial enough for them to fight for it. Kind of. You know what I mean? I would assume if it was bringing hundreds of millions risk free, I'd be like, all right, I'm going to fight the SEC or whoever, or at least try and delay closing it down as long as I can. So I appeal and do whatever.
00:26:36.128 - 00:26:39.814, Speaker B: Yeah, you don't know. They paid 20 million to settle, I think, right?
00:26:39.952 - 00:26:52.734, Speaker C: Yeah. So it's possible that they just said, you know what, that revenue just isn't worth the hassle. And other exchanges are taking a different call.
00:26:52.932 - 00:27:02.466, Speaker B: Yeah, whatever. I wonder. Fighting the SEC does not sound like a cheap endeavor. I don't know what the number should be.
00:27:02.488 - 00:27:21.100, Speaker A: Easy enough to see it, right. With Coinbase filings. They're a public company in the US, so potentially we could look through their statements and see how much they're making from their staking business.
00:27:21.630 - 00:27:38.030, Speaker C: Yeah, I wonder if they break that down, though. Yeah, we'll have to see. Okay, sometimes these guys hide it inside other revenue or something. Right. Because they don't want the competitor to know how much they're making. True, but, yeah, we should dive in for sure.
00:27:38.180 - 00:28:08.950, Speaker A: Yeah. And do you guys know, technically how these companies or protocols are able to do this? Because the theorem protocol itself allows for just 32 e validators. So how are these protocols able to allow for smaller stakes? Do you guys know? Are they, like, bundling these and then.
00:28:09.100 - 00:28:10.806, Speaker B: I assume so, yeah.
00:28:10.908 - 00:28:55.480, Speaker C: So in cases where you want to run your own node and you want to be a node operator, let's say you put up four ETH or eight ETH in the case of rocket pool, right. You basically borrow the remaining ETH that you need 24 from the other liquidity providers on the protocol. So then you come up with your 32 e to run your node, essentially, and you need to put up a bond of, I think, what, 2.4 e in RPL tokens. So that's like the first collateral that gets slashed, because you don't want other people's ETH getting slashed. Right. So that's like a safeguard against that.
00:28:58.090 - 00:29:11.418, Speaker B: So you're putting up eight, and then other people are just putting up. You're not matching with other people's eight ETH per se. You're matching up with, just like, people who deposit some amount of ETH through.
00:29:11.504 - 00:29:35.042, Speaker C: Yeah, there's two sides of protocol. Right. Like, we're used to just looking at it from the lido side, which is where we deposit ETH, we get staked ETH, and then they kind of allocate. So you can do the same thing with rocket pool, right, where you deposit ETH, get our ETH, and that's it. But if you actually want to run a node, which is not an option with Lido, because they have their own centralized set of operators. Right.
00:29:35.096 - 00:29:35.810, Speaker B: Got it.
00:29:35.960 - 00:30:06.874, Speaker C: So the whole point of rocket pool was that anyone can run a node, and all you need to put up is, well, eight ETH. Now, I think it's planned to be reduced further to four e down the line. So, yeah, it's making it easier for smaller stakers. So you need to have essentially 10.4 e to run a node instead of 32, which is still like quite a huge reduction. Right. And once it goes down to four e, it'll be, I think, more accessible.
00:30:06.874 - 00:30:17.060, Speaker C: Like you're in the five, six k range. So you're like, okay, I want to kind of contribute to decentralizing Ethereum. Let's spin this node up.
00:30:18.390 - 00:30:22.770, Speaker B: Yeah, it'll be exciting. It is exciting, yeah.
00:30:22.920 - 00:30:52.430, Speaker C: And yeah, etherfi is actually running this campaign right now where if you sign up and get chosen to run a node based on your staking experience or your application or whatnot, they'll send you the hardware and 96 e to run your node and you get a share of the staking rewards. The only catch is you have to, I think, run the node for three years and have a specific bandwidth requirement, et cetera. But, yeah, definitely worth looking into for people.
00:30:52.580 - 00:31:06.180, Speaker A: And you can't be in the. Yeah, yeah. Otherwise we were talking about applying, but yeah, maybe we can get around it.
00:31:06.550 - 00:31:09.806, Speaker C: Yeah, we need to get Alf to get us a node in Europe.
00:31:09.998 - 00:31:18.020, Speaker A: Yes. Okay, then moving on to cake. What happened here?
00:31:18.630 - 00:31:56.642, Speaker B: Sure. So I just heard back from the cake team yesterday. We'll need to update the story, but it doesn't really change it materially. Basically, cake dropped good amount at the time. I wrote the story 24% in a week, which was the most among the top hundred coins. And basically based on my conversations with the trader, that was because they had a locking program where you could lock your cake tokens for up to a year. I think there was a major unlock that happened this week.
00:31:56.642 - 00:33:02.680, Speaker B: And so people sold, I believe it was roughly like 6 million cake, which actually isn't that much, but there's a lot more locked up right now, which is going to be unlocked over the course of the next couple of months. I can't speak to exactly the numbers there, but right now there's like 190,000,000 cakes still locked, some of it unlocking. So basically, big drop on cake. We looked into why. I said why? And there's a lot of debate going around about kind of the tokenomics moving forward, because basically they have been inflating the supply a bit on a per block basis, and they're trying to figure out how to stop doing that. So they had one proposal which got shut down, which was going to reduce the cake emissions by quite a bit. And so then they came back with another proposal, which is live right now, I think, which looks like it's going to pass.
00:33:02.680 - 00:34:02.966, Speaker B: So it's going to kind of reduce the cake emissions from 6.65 cake to three cake for that module where people have all their cake locked up, so that's kind of the beginning and then it's going to keep trailing off from there. So I think some people who did stake felt like it was unfair because they had staked thinking they were going to get six cake. It sounds ridiculous, but now they're like, oh, you can't just ratchet it down in the middle when we locked our tokens up for like a year or something and we have six months to go. So I think there's been some jostling around that and they've kind of reached kind of a moderate conclusion about that. So, yeah, I mean, high level. I thought what was interesting about this was know, pancake swap is still like, we underrate them, we call them a uniswap competitor, but they're the biggest protocol that didn't start on binance in terms of TVL in DeFi.
00:34:02.966 - 00:34:51.290, Speaker B: So they're actually really big and it's interesting to see them as an experiment in terms of can a protocol be achieved blue chip status when it didn't start on? You know, it seems like they're at least serious in that they're responding to my emails about this and trying to actually work in quote unquote real yield, which I think comes from trading fees. So it's interesting to kind of see this protocol try to grow up despite kind of the scammy vibes of binance smart chain and just like, I don't know, not starting on Ethereum and now they're expanding onto Ethereum and Apto. So it'll be interesting to see how they do as they kind of try to become a player beyond binance.
00:34:52.510 - 00:35:36.870, Speaker C: This is problem that's going to hit a lot of protocols, not just pancake swap, because locking tokens was extremely popular during the bull market and was a great way for projects to say, all right, lock it up, get the supply out of circulation, easy to pump price, no dumping, et cetera. But now those chickens are coming home to roost because we're what, almost two years down from peak bull or we will be in. Yeah. So a lot of these protocols that encourage this locking system are going to see these unlocks come on and they're going to have to find a way to deal with it or just see price dump.
00:35:38.330 - 00:35:52.122, Speaker B: Yeah, that's interesting. I don't know what other ones are on. Yeah, I know. Magic did a lock up and the founder acknowledged. They were like, we just need to buy time. He's pretty high integrity and he was like, this is what we need to do so. Yeah.
00:35:52.122 - 00:35:54.190, Speaker B: I don't know if there are other ones on your radar.
00:35:55.090 - 00:36:03.154, Speaker C: I don't know. But anyways, I mean, the CRV unlocks when they happen in. When would it be? 2025, I guess.
00:36:03.192 - 00:36:03.490, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:03.560 - 00:36:11.540, Speaker C: No, 2024 onwards, those are going to be massive chunks of tokens coming on the market.
00:36:11.990 - 00:36:24.054, Speaker A: Were they the first to do that? If not the first? They were definitely one of the biggest ones pushing this model. Right?
00:36:24.252 - 00:36:29.850, Speaker C: Oh yeah, they inspired everyone. Now everyone has a ve token thanks to curve.
00:36:30.910 - 00:36:43.838, Speaker B: I wonder if they did four years. I wonder if they did it to time it with the cycle. Right, with the harvard. Yeah. Hope the market's up every four years so no one sells. I don't know.
00:36:44.004 - 00:36:47.018, Speaker C: I mean, you never know. Man, those guys are some big brained.
00:36:47.194 - 00:36:48.960, Speaker B: They're very smart. Yes.
00:36:50.370 - 00:37:04.260, Speaker C: They just deployed something related to CRV USD last week. Right. Like a related contract or something. So yeah, it'll be interesting to see once the stablecoin actually launches. Should be soon.
00:37:05.450 - 00:37:06.200, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:07.370 - 00:37:24.300, Speaker A: So in this case, is the strategy to reduce selling pressure? The idea is to cut inflation, basically just telling token holders there will be less supply going forward.
00:37:24.910 - 00:37:54.914, Speaker B: Yeah, well, they capped supply in May and I think they're just capping the rate at which they're emitting it to people who have staked in this module called syrup pool. And I think there's some other benefits from staking in syrup pool, which I'd have to look up, but I think it's like maybe a little like sushi swap where you maybe get some trading fees with X sushi. I think it was okay.
00:37:55.032 - 00:37:59.702, Speaker A: And the exact rate was being discussed in this proposal, right?
00:37:59.836 - 00:38:06.840, Speaker B: Yeah, they were working out. Yeah. And I think there's just some nuances about reduce how fast.
00:38:10.750 - 00:38:34.370, Speaker A: Yeah, no, you're right. I mean, it's definitely a protocol to watch. Yeah, I mean, it is the second biggest decks out. Yeah. We'll be keeping tabs on what's happening in governance and price action for sure. Someone, Amsterdam Holland is saying bearish on Cape because it's mintable.
00:38:35.270 - 00:38:37.410, Speaker B: What do you mean, Amsterdam Holland?
00:38:39.030 - 00:38:40.180, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know.
00:38:42.950 - 00:38:56.440, Speaker B: Supposedly they capped the supply at 750,000,000. I think like half of that is in circulation right now. So I mean, we'll see. Obviously they're able to control emissions, which is kind of suspect in and of itself.
00:39:00.350 - 00:39:15.870, Speaker A: Okay. And then moving on to layer zero, this kind of trending hot new protocol that just raised a bunch of money activity triples after Airdrop.
00:39:18.210 - 00:39:41.782, Speaker B: Yeah, I can speed run this. I think we're a little behind schedule, basically. Yeah. It's like, I mean, you can see it in the graph. Arbitram announced its airdrop, and then everyone decided they really think this bridge is very useful all of a sudden. So the subtext of all that is everyone wants an airdrop like layer zero. Just raised money.
00:39:41.782 - 00:40:11.870, Speaker B: I think especially these well moneyed VC projects tend to follow the airdrop model, I want to say. So it does seem like. Sorry about that. It does seem like that's what's happening here. And it's amazing. Like, we saw that with zk sync and Blur, that airdrops seem to very obviously incentivize. It's not just like this niche thing anymore.
00:40:11.870 - 00:40:26.390, Speaker B: There are thousands of threads on Twitter about how to get the next airdrop for the layer zero. And you can see it in the transactions that people are obviously using it to try to get a free money airdrop.
00:40:26.970 - 00:40:33.446, Speaker C: Yeah, it makes sense. Right? Because for the VCs, how else are they going to find a way to dump on us?
00:40:33.628 - 00:40:35.080, Speaker B: Yeah, you said that.
00:40:37.770 - 00:40:43.930, Speaker C: It's like, oh, yeah, airdrop. Free money for everyone. Yes. Now we have 100 million in liquidity. All right, here's our bag.
00:40:44.510 - 00:40:50.446, Speaker B: Yeah. A tail is all this time. What a nice thing.
00:40:50.548 - 00:41:09.410, Speaker A: I don't know. Is the connection to arbitram here, just because, okay. Arbitrum did a huge airdrop recently, layer zero is this other big project, VC funded. They'll probably do an airdrop.
00:41:09.830 - 00:41:26.920, Speaker B: I think it was. I didn't get anyone on record to say that, but the correlation was just like, too. I feel like it was just too extreme. It was just to the day, which I think people realized how big the arbitram airdrop was too, like, biggest on record.
00:41:27.450 - 00:41:59.234, Speaker C: No one expected that. In the months leading up to the arbitram airdrop, a lot of people even ignored it because they said, I mean, what's it going to be worth? $50, $100? That was the expectation because total bear market sentiment. And when it actually happened and people got, like, tens of thousands of dollars, that kind of woke everyone else up and said, all right, enough slacking. Get to work. Right. Yeah. It's layer zero Zksync, which are the other ones.
00:41:59.234 - 00:42:18.540, Speaker C: There's some testnets running for, like, sui. Sui just is launching their main net, I believe, on the third, and the token is already live, I believe. Yeah. It might be an interesting summer if there's more airdrops on the way.
00:42:20.670 - 00:42:46.820, Speaker A: Sure. I don't know. It seems so unsustainable. We've talked about this before, but it's just marketing. In the end, it's just giving away a bunch of money to get people to use your thing. And then it's like, how much of that liquidity or how many of those users will actually stick around?
00:42:49.830 - 00:42:58.722, Speaker C: We get tokens for responsible governance. That's why we don't sell, we don't dump, we delegate.
00:42:58.786 - 00:43:41.250, Speaker A: No, everyone's just there to participate in governance. Of course. Anyways, I don't know. Yeah. Again, it seems very unsustainable. We've tried to do this story before and I don't think we've really nailed it. But just the math on how much these protocols are spending per user with these airdrops and has it been worth it long term? I think we should take another crack at investigating that and just comparing it with regular web two CAC.
00:43:43.190 - 00:44:22.750, Speaker B: Yeah, but they're not necessarily paying anything in the same way because they create the tokens out of thin air. I guess it's like, well, there's like airdrops and then there's the liquidity mining, which I guess is like, arguably, I don't know, I'd have to think through how those are different. But maybe liquidity mining is more like customer acquisition and airdrops are something else, like Yyc said, like liquidity for your bags. I don't know, to me, because, yeah.
00:44:22.820 - 00:44:38.760, Speaker C: They'Re not really burning cash to acquire these customers. Right. You spin up a contract and suddenly it's worth $2 billion. That token didn't exist yesterday and it didn't cost you more than a couple of e to deploy the contract and airdrop it to everybody.
00:44:40.010 - 00:44:40.760, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:43.610 - 00:44:55.900, Speaker A: It just doesn't seem right. Can you actually do that? Just make money out of thin air? It seems like there has to be a cost there for them.
00:44:56.430 - 00:45:16.866, Speaker C: If anything else, it's the promise of future, I don't know, a stake, I guess, in the future of the project, or if you want to call it that, or a say in what happens. I mean, that's the whole sales pitch of Dow governance. Right. Like you get to decide what the project does.
00:45:17.048 - 00:45:22.034, Speaker B: Yeah. Without expectations of profit, because that would make it a security, right.
00:45:22.152 - 00:45:22.820, Speaker C: Yes.
00:45:25.050 - 00:45:35.720, Speaker A: Obviously the underlying promise there is you get to vote. Therefore at some point you get to vote to get some of the revenue yourself.
00:45:38.430 - 00:45:48.220, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's a good point. And it's good to hammer that home and not say it's not all bogus dows have potential to do well.
00:45:48.590 - 00:46:31.580, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. But I think this is, I mean, we can see why vcs or anyone who can access seed rounds love crypto, right? Because whether a project succeeds or fails, you can still dump your bag at 2345 X as soon as the token goes live. Now, traditional startup world, let's say you give seed money to a startup. If the business collapses in the real world and dies, you get nothing. In this case, you can still just hype up a few medium posts, Twitter, get some influencers on board and do a launch pad event on finance and boom, you've exited like five x even though the project is dead like three months later.
00:46:34.270 - 00:46:56.462, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean that's like the, honestly, it's like the sickest game in crypto, I guess. I'll say it. Yeah, it's so good. Yeah, because the company doesn't have to succeed. I mean, optimally a company goes public and that's how you make money, right? Like you bet on innovation in the future. But yeah, it's like in crypto VC world, it's like, yeah, you don't even need product market fit, you just need.
00:46:56.596 - 00:46:58.846, Speaker A: Like you said, the token to pump.
00:46:59.038 - 00:47:28.954, Speaker B: Yeah, you can marketing and get in at a low seed round. Anyways, it's a whole thing. I mean, people do stuff like people invested, like coin list, which I think is open, but they're only open to accredited investors. But they did some stuff. I think there were some things you could participate in the Solana, I think initial token allocation or at least around through coin list and filecoin and stuff. But it's still kind of a bad game that people play these days.
00:47:29.152 - 00:47:51.060, Speaker C: I mean, just today on the finance launchpad, there is this education startup doing something, I don't know, some sort of educational dow and it's oversubscribed by something like 1100 x. These are like bull market vibes. They're looking to raise like 2 million and people have thrown like a billion dollars at it.
00:47:51.590 - 00:47:52.820, Speaker A: Really? Why?
00:47:53.350 - 00:47:57.800, Speaker C: I have no idea. I just saw some tweets about it.
00:47:58.570 - 00:47:59.174, Speaker A: Wow.
00:47:59.292 - 00:48:02.840, Speaker B: Do you think they just want that low seed price?
00:48:03.530 - 00:48:10.138, Speaker C: Yeah, now that it's so oversubscribed, it's almost guaranteed it's going to pump out of the gate. Right?
00:48:10.304 - 00:48:10.634, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:10.672 - 00:48:18.234, Speaker C: No idea what it is or whether the project even has anything substantial behind it.
00:48:18.272 - 00:48:20.778, Speaker B: But you don't need to know that. It's all good.
00:48:20.864 - 00:48:29.360, Speaker C: I mean, back in 2021, launch pad stuff was just 10, 20, 30 xing on the back of like a one page or half page white paper.
00:48:29.730 - 00:48:30.480, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:33.350 - 00:48:55.320, Speaker A: To be sure, vcs often have vesting periods. They do have lockups. I don't know how common it is that they can actually just dump their tokens right away, at least not kind of overtly or legally. It's not what most of them agree.
00:48:57.370 - 00:49:09.610, Speaker C: Alameda. Alameda was famous for that. Right. They'd say, yeah, we're going to hold the tokens that's vested, and just dump them as soon as they get them. They did that with a couple of projects. I think it was reef finance or something.
00:49:09.680 - 00:49:11.358, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I remember that.
00:49:11.524 - 00:49:19.040, Speaker C: They signed the deal like, yeah, it's vested, three years, whatnot. And the next day they dubbed them, like, all of.
00:49:23.010 - 00:49:50.810, Speaker B: Yeah, no, but Kimmy, you're. Yeah, good ones have vesting periods, and if some unlock, not all of them unlock. That said, it still is a new model where it's like, there's no acquisition or, I don't know, a project just doesn't have to be that successful by the time tokens unlock, or the unlocking isn't tied to certain milestones, which I think it somewhat is in the traditional equity world. So I think it's kind of a broken part of crypto.
00:49:51.230 - 00:49:51.786, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:51.888 - 00:50:14.900, Speaker C: And usually by the time the token generation event happens, the price is so much higher than the seed price that even that 5% that you get unlocked is enough to cover the capital you invested and potentially a bit of profit, too. And then that's ideal, right? You've got your money out, and then you're loaned the rest the degen way.
00:50:18.310 - 00:50:46.010, Speaker A: Okay, moving on to sand token, which just this very mysterious, I guess, or obscure project that somehow accounts for 11% of Ethereum gas consumption. It's such an interesting story. What does this token actually do? And why is it making up for so much activity on Ethereum?
00:50:46.670 - 00:51:29.734, Speaker B: Yeah, so with regards to what it does, like, well, you know, it. It, like, well, yeah, I mean, I guess the questions about what it does and why it is using so much gas are linked, and that's because basically it's this token which you can mint a lot of, and all you have to do is pay gas on a network, bitcoin, TV, good old fashioned Ponzi, I don't know. Jury's out, man. Yeah. And then blue blum.
00:51:29.782 - 00:51:29.946, Speaker C: Yes.
00:51:29.968 - 00:52:04.902, Speaker B: It is a very low bar of entry because basically you mint it and all you have to pay is the minting cost, so you don't even have to buy it. And right now you can get a lot for a little, basically. And I think it's starting that's going to tail off on a curve. And so basically, I think that's why you're seeing gas spike on Ethereum, is because that's one of the networks it's deployed on and people are minting a bunch of it, and that's kind of what happens. Go ahead.
00:52:04.996 - 00:52:10.098, Speaker A: Is it? Is it? I mean, okay, so it's a token that you can mint for cheap.
00:52:10.274 - 00:52:11.702, Speaker B: Mint for free.
00:52:11.756 - 00:52:12.630, Speaker A: For free. Okay.
00:52:12.700 - 00:52:13.880, Speaker B: Save gas. Yeah.
00:52:14.810 - 00:52:19.340, Speaker A: Okay, so you can mint this token for free except for gas costs. And then what?
00:52:19.870 - 00:52:42.560, Speaker B: And then you can bridge it to a burgeoning network of other projects. So basically, then you can burn Zen to move into different projects which do various things. I'm trying my best here.
00:52:43.250 - 00:52:45.780, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm sorry.
00:52:47.270 - 00:53:01.910, Speaker B: I had to deal with my own skepticism about it, and I was very surprised because the guy I interviewed, I was ready to just be like, okay, this is insane. But the guy I interviewed was very cogent and knew about Defi and was very sane.
00:53:02.810 - 00:53:22.858, Speaker A: Okay, so blue bump says you can stake it. You can batch mint with NFTs, send his fair launch crypto. I like the idea of minting for free. I think that's awesome. But, yeah, I'm just trying to get my head around, like, okay, no, totally. What else?
00:53:23.024 - 00:53:56.150, Speaker B: It's a weird one. I mean, there are lots of weird things and it's very mysterious. I wrote about it first, like half a year ago because it. And I was frustrated then because I felt like I didn't really understand it, and I still don't really. But the basic idea is that there are a bunch of apps kind of getting built around it. In order to use those apps, you have to transfer your Zen into another token. And in so doing, some zen, if not all, is burned.
00:53:56.150 - 00:54:40.678, Speaker B: And so that's the basic idea. I haven't thought through the economics, but I will say the guy I talked to was very kind of cogent. And he knew a lot about, like, I kind of assumed it would be. Or at least he knew all the people in Defi and knew who Hayden Adams was and he wasn't know. With some of these things, I think we can be very skeptical because it's not like this Ethereum kind of core blue chip, quote unquote, projects, which I felt like the same thing about cake. And I'm trying to look beyond that and be like, yeah, who knows? It's an interesting experiment. And they talked a lot about know, like, I talked to one guy involved and briefly with the founder who's like this.
00:54:40.678 - 00:55:16.898, Speaker B: They're kind of like lionizing him, which I also think is very know. We've seen, like, Doe Kwan lionize himself and Sam. And so they're kind of lionizing this guy who used to work at Google, who's the founder, as the major creator of it. But yeah, we'll see. It's on like ten chains. They're doing a very different thing. And as blue bum said, yeah, it's like, yeah, they didn't take BC money from what I understand.
00:55:16.898 - 00:55:34.550, Speaker B: So I mean, at least like that is out the window. So we'll see. You know, I don't know, but it is a mysterious one, and one that kind of tests biases. And you're like, oh, if it's not like Ethereum, then it's not real. But I don't think that's accurate.
00:55:35.450 - 00:56:06.302, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I don't think that's fair, but at least there's some aspects of it which are really interesting. Here. Buvam is saying there's no admin keys, and then BitcoinTV says send has no fixed supply and send tokens will be created in perpetuity. However, send has no initial supply either, so it starts from zero. And every user mints their own send. Okay, so that's pretty interesting. If nothing else, it's just a cool experiment around tokenomics.
00:56:06.302 - 00:56:39.770, Speaker A: And my only question is like, okay, there's this token with an interesting tokenomics, but you still need to use it for something, for it to gain value. But I guess, okay, that depends on what people build with this platform. In any case, interesting. It's just so weird that this mysterious protocol, we're struggling to understand what it actually does. It's the second most active contract on Ethereum.
00:56:44.130 - 00:56:55.040, Speaker B: You usually look on that list and it's like C port, which was developed by Openc, like uniswap and stuff, you know, and USDT. And then all of a sudden there was.
00:56:56.950 - 00:57:13.190, Speaker A: Super interesting. Okay, and then we're coming up on time. Maybe we can end the live stream with NFTs. Why? We see what's happening in the wild world of non fungible tokens.
00:57:15.370 - 00:58:24.186, Speaker C: In one word, dead. To be honest, I wrote an article last week about how most of the alpha channels in NFT discord these days are dedicated to. I mean, the market's been sort of weird for the last few months, for one thing. The blur farming, completely distorted price action, price discovery price anything, to be honest, since it's been live, especially for the more valuable collections with a lot of volume, like the Yuga labs or Clonex, et cetera. Of course, now that's all pretty much done with after last week's sale of, I think, what was it, 27 apes that basically tanked the market on apes. And then that cascaded into other bidders, basically giving up and saying, you know what? These points aren't worth it. Worth getting dumped.
00:58:24.186 - 00:59:42.466, Speaker C: Hundreds of ETH worth of NFTs on your head when you're bidding, which was the risk to the whole program to begin with because you'd get more points for bidding closer to floor. But the closer to floor you are, the more likely it is that someone's going to hit your bid and you'll end up with that NFT. Now, while in the beginning of the program, when you had a lot of whales kind of competing and a ton of liquidity getting sold, an NFT wasn't really so bad because you could probably turn around and dump it on the next bidder for a minimal loss, like maybe zero, one ETH, two e, something like that. So it was still worth it. But now the liquidity has just dried up and collections have just been lower and lower. And there was this analysis from a popular account on Twitter saying that traders have been dumping, or rather realizing $2 million or so, 1000 e worth of losses every day for the last nine months. Is it capitulation? We must be close because just look at something that was trading for 20 E, for example, Clonex.
00:59:42.466 - 01:00:43.420, Speaker C: Right? It's gone from 20 ETH to two e and ETH has also gone from, what, 4000 plus to 1800. So someone who bought it at the peak or close to the peak, and they stayed at around that 20 e range for a while, 18 to 20 is down like 96, 97%. So I think, yes, they can still fall further, obviously. And the community believes that there have been missteps made along the way. I mean, Clonex was doing really well because I spoke of that example until they came out with their last drop, which was rather than giving holders a benefit, it gave you like a discount pass to buy something. And people weren't happy with that at all. They're like, after all this, and I've spent, I don't know, five, six ETH on this monolith and you're going to give me, you want more money from me? Plus, it was just taken the wrong way, I think.
01:00:43.420 - 01:01:01.070, Speaker C: Yeah. Getting off topic there. But, yeah, NFTs so far, pretty dead. Not much interest in humans. Of course, there are some bright spots, like ordinals. The bitcoin NFTs have crossed 2 million inscriptions.
01:01:01.730 - 01:01:06.660, Speaker B: Malaysians are going crazy, man. Malaysians over Twitter. It's crazy.
01:01:07.110 - 01:01:23.990, Speaker C: Yeah. Apparently there's a rumor going around that they were behind a lot of these meme coins, including and some of the profits are being funneled back into buying Maladys or whatnot.
01:01:26.890 - 01:01:32.890, Speaker B: Yeah, some guy told me basically that who had a Malady PFP for whatever it's.
01:01:34.830 - 01:01:45.680, Speaker A: What do you think is going on with ardenals? Is it just people on bitcoin who've missed out on NFTs and this is their chance or something else?
01:01:47.330 - 01:02:38.880, Speaker C: When they first came out, I was on holiday, so I missed the initial rush and then I faded it because I was like, you know what? Why would someone want to trade? At the time, you were trading basically OTC using an Excel sheet, and I was like, how is this ever going to catch on? But the infrastructure has built up really quickly, so now you have wallets, marketplaces, everything, and it's quite a seamless experience. So I think that's definitely one part of it. The bitcoin community is kind of enjoying NFTs, maybe for the first time, maybe pure maxis who said, I'm not going to touch any of these shitcoins. And now they're like, okay, NFTs are on our chain, so we can play with them now. So it could be.
01:02:39.970 - 01:02:41.360, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense.
01:02:41.810 - 01:02:47.060, Speaker A: Yeah. But overall, it's looking pretty bleak. Yeah.
01:02:47.830 - 01:02:51.666, Speaker B: Picture in mind, there are a few.
01:02:51.768 - 01:03:09.980, Speaker C: Collections that are doing somewhat well. I'd say, like, the meme land collection, the captains is holding up pretty well. Azuki also kind of picked up from the bear market. But, yeah, I'd say 99% of the stuff out there is, like, real, just doubt bad.
01:03:10.670 - 01:03:11.274, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:11.392 - 01:03:19.900, Speaker B: Well, we said that it was like the ICOs of this last bear market where I felt like, were nfts this very.
01:03:20.270 - 01:03:21.020, Speaker C: Absolutely.
01:03:21.890 - 01:03:32.990, Speaker A: For sure. The question is, is there still value in them long term, or were they just this passing fad?
01:03:36.710 - 01:04:08.730, Speaker B: I think there are, yeah. I think the idea of organizing people with these tokens, I don't know, I kind of like it. I feel like there probably is, I don't know, where tokens end and nfts start. I don't know. I wish I had tweeted this before because I saw Kobe tweet it and I thought that same thing, which is their altcoins with pictures. I think they're a little different anyways. But I do think it's kind of interesting of organizing people with these tokens.
01:04:08.730 - 01:04:11.760, Speaker B: I don't know how it's all going to turn out.
01:04:14.930 - 01:04:15.920, Speaker A: Of it.
01:04:20.450 - 01:04:45.250, Speaker C: In their current form with the liquidity, the way it is, like how pseudoswap and NFT amms and things have come into play and blurbid pools, et cetera. They have kind of become shitcoins with pictures because no one cares about the unique traits anymore. Because it's just about trading the floor price, essentially.
01:04:45.410 - 01:05:16.290, Speaker B: Yeah. But like Cammie said, the community aspect, is it a way to organize people and attach people to this idea and quickly? I don't know, be able to do things? Considering that everyone is attached to something. I think maladys are interesting. I don't know. What does it mean? Can you efficiently organize a party or something? I feel like everyone gives these party events. Like, people go to parties all the time. I don't know.
01:05:16.290 - 01:05:25.880, Speaker B: But yeah, I don't know. I'm not sure it's a whole discussion. Probably not to have at the end of the hour.
01:05:26.490 - 01:05:45.260, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. I don't know why my camera wasn't working anyways. Yeah. So I hate to kind of end the stream in kind of such a down note. Like NFDs are dead. Well, users volumes are definitely down.
01:05:45.260 - 01:06:51.920, Speaker A: I do think that there is long term value, at least definitely on non fungible tokens more broadly because there are other use cases for NFTs besides PFPs and art and collectibles, the financial aspect of it representing property, representing invoices, stuff like that on chain. That definitely, I think has legs long term. I think collectibles on art does too. But maybe it was way overvalued in the last cycle and now it's just correcting to what things like community access to parties and stuff like that are actually worth. Like, maybe they're not actually worth billions of dollars, but we'll see what the price actually is down the line. Yeah. And what else? Just a couple more headlines that we did.
01:06:51.920 - 01:07:43.410, Speaker A: There's arbitrum teaming up with Alt. Layer in layer. Yeah, we're not even kind of have just like a solid layer two ecosystem, but people are already thinking on layer three. And then Google is partnering with Google Cloud partnering with Polygon. We're working on the story on Franklin Templeton also launching, I think, a fund on, you know, there's just so much activity like partnerships on Polygon all the time. It seems like these announcements are coming in every week. So, yeah, that was this week.
01:07:43.410 - 01:08:19.850, Speaker A: Tons happening. To recap, I think biggest story was Coinbase suing the SEC. There's this kind of battle to define crypto regulation. Coinbase is pushing for clarity. The SEC seems like doesn't want to give it. And yeah, markets were down. There's this push to decentralized Ethereum staking and yeah, NFDs are dead.
01:08:19.850 - 01:08:46.440, Speaker A: It's summing up what happened. And then if you see our banner there, subscribe to our channel if you want ETH to reach ten K. Yeah, that's definitely going to happen. If you subscribe, you'll see ETH shoot to the moon. But seriously, it really helps us if you give us a like and subscribe if you enjoyed this. And I think that's it, we'll wrap up and hope to see you all next week.
01:08:47.850 - 01:08:48.840, Speaker B: Right on.
01:08:49.690 - 01:09:01.300, Speaker A: Bye, guys. We want to.
