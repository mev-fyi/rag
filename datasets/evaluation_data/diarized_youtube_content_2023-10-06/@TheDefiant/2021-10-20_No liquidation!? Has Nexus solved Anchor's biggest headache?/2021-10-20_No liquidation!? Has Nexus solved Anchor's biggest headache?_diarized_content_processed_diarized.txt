00:00:00.490 - 00:00:15.646, Speaker A: It's Wednesday, which means it's time for first look our unboxing series. And today I'm very excited to be talking about Nexus protocol. Not to be confused with Nexus mutual. This is a yield optimizer. It's liquidation protection for Terra. It is wild. I love it.
00:00:15.646 - 00:00:38.194, Speaker A: It has the nicest design I have seen on a website in a long time. But none of that matters. What does matter, though, is our sponsors. So let's hear from them first. Hit it. Don't let high gas costs keep you out of Ethereum, but Balancer's a gas optimized vault architecture makes trading cheaper than anywhere else. Liquidity providers can optimize their fee earnings using the dynamic fee system that automatically adjusts to market conditions.
00:00:38.194 - 00:01:13.858, Speaker A: You can also use asset managers to lend out idle assets, dramatically increasing your capital efficiency. And because balancer is an open platform for flexible automated markets, you can choose from stable pools or weighted pools. And in the future more designs will be created that they don't even know about yet. Check it out at balancer Phi.

Sign up now at Nanthan AI and become a smarter investor today. So yes, we're talking about Nexus protocol and in particular one product, the anchor vaults. Now there are a couple of different vaults on Nexus. We're not going to look into all of them because just getting your head around what Nexus is doing simply with these anchor vaults is big enough for today's first look. But there's more to dig into later on with their delta neutral strategy and the ethnexis product as well. So much cool stuff going on here, and what I'm hoping is that what's being built here will be reflected in other chains.
00:01:55.998 - 00:02:48.382, Speaker A: I'm looking in particular at a Carla that we covered yesterday in our tutorial because this really starts to give you a flavor of what might be possible during extended bearish periods for DeFi in particular, to create a backstop, a safe place. Well, I say safe for capital to go and keep generating returns. Because when you think about Defi and what it's actually about, it's not about farms, it's not about absurd APIs. It's about making your money do more for you in a decentralized manner than it could possibly do in a centralized manner. And right now, nobody really thinks they need that. But trust me, in like 18 months, you're really going to want this. So here's the basic idea between around Nexus.
00:02:48.382 - 00:03:28.234, Speaker A: It's about defending your assets and supercharging your yield. That's their headline, not mine. Nexus offers better yield, maximize your yields in the Terra ecosystem with Terra's first yield optimizer and liquidation protection vaults. So it's kind of a little bit like yearn. So it's taking complex strategies that you might find intimidating and making them simpler and also giving you a little bit of peace of mind that some of the bad things that you have heard will happen, don't happen. And specifically, if you remember back in May, we looked at anchor from the point of view of the borrow side of the market. So anchor offers this incredible rate of return, 20% on UST.
00:03:28.234 - 00:04:12.474, Speaker A: But in order to do so, it needs both sides of the market to be content. And so they massively, massively incentivize the borrow side of the market to entice borrowers to come in to put collateral into the system and that will create a healthier market in general and bring the levels back to a place where everything looks right. So Nexus is designed to help that happen. That is basically what they're about. And it's designed to take advantage of a few different pieces of the terra ecosystem to allow this to be possible. So in their words, it's designed to make yield farming simple, deliver optimized sustainable yield, and bolster the borrower side of the terra ecosystem. There are two products on the nexus side at the moment.
00:04:12.474 - 00:04:43.062, Speaker A: There's the anchor vault and there's the ust mirror vault. We're not going to look at the mirror vault, but we'll just drop a few words about it later on. But specifically, we're looking at the anchor vault. So if you can think about it this way, when capital flees to safety, it's going to want a stable return and it's going to be lending. So it's going to go for that 20% APY on the earn side of the anchor market. Now what we can do is go and have a look at anchor. If you're not familiar with anchor, this is the anchor money market.
00:04:43.062 - 00:05:06.654, Speaker A: So here's the earn side. APY is 19.48%. Doesn't tend to hit 20% anymore, but still 19.48%. And remember, this is fixed pretty much it has been around this level for months and months and months and months and months. Doequan has said it will come down, but it's going to come down very, very slowly. On the other side, you have the borrow side of the market. So here's the borrower side.
00:05:06.654 - 00:05:33.826, Speaker A: And here the net APR is eleven point 75%. The borrow Apr and the distribution Apr. So back in May, this was around 100%. So when the market is bearish, this goes up significantly. So what this tells you at the moment is that people are happily borrowing. They're very, very happy in the market, and they are putting a lot of money into the borrow side. And that means that people on the earn side are doing very, very nicely.
00:05:33.826 - 00:06:00.666, Speaker A: This is what you would expect when the market is bullish. You'd expect the earn side to be healthy, the borrow side to be healthy, and the earn side, well, people are not that fussed about that at the moment. Because when you borrow money, you can put it into doing other things. You can leverage down on your collateral and do more with it. When the market is bearish, this flips complete the other way. People desperately want 20% because it's the best they can get. And so the borrower side gets heavily incentivized to make it up because people don't want to borrow.
00:06:00.666 - 00:06:31.110, Speaker A: They just don't want to borrow. And in order to borrow on the anchor money market, you have to supply collateral in the form of a bonded staking asset. And for the longest time, it's been Luna. The staking rewards on Luna are sold off on the bonded lunar, that is, to fund the earned side of the market. But now we have bonded ETH as well. So there's a ton of bonded ETH that's now been joined to the borrowers side of the market. And so you basically take staked ETH via lido.
00:06:31.110 - 00:07:00.046, Speaker A: This has just been added, and then you add it to the money market and they take the staking rewards and funnel them back into anchor. That's how you get paid. There's other incentives for borrowing. You get ANC, the anchor token. And anchor also benefits from the staking rewards as well. Any profits that come through anchor also get paid out to ANC holders. So there's a bunch of different incentive mechanisms designed to make you a happy camper when you're using anchor.
00:07:00.046 - 00:07:29.654, Speaker A: So anchor has a target utilization ratio. And this is the bit where anchor is healthier. And this is how it works. So there's a 20% or thereabouts APY on anchor UST deposits, which is subsidized by the staking yields of deposited staking derivatives. As we just looked. So your staked lunar or your staked ETH generates rewards. Those rewards are sold off and they're given back to you as you deposit.
00:07:29.654 - 00:08:01.254, Speaker A: So the borrowing incentives are mediated by the NC token incentives. We just talked about that. And then during extended or volatile bearish market conditions, demand for borrowing declines. As we looked. So the earn side is then subsidized by the UST reserve pool. So as borrowing declines, the levels at which the borrowing can make up the rewards for the earned side of the market decrease. Now, the LTV, the loan to value of a loan on anchor is set at a certain rate.
00:08:01.254 - 00:08:41.762, Speaker A: It was 50%, it's now 60%. So you can't take out 100% loan on your collateral. So there's a bunch of collateral that's earning interest, that's earning staking rewards, that is outperforming how much you're able to borrow on it. So there are extra rewards going into the earned side of the market, and that's how you can have a 60% utilization target and still be fine. So the earned side is subsidized by the UST reserve pool. When that drops. And that reserve pool is, I forget what size it is the moment, but they had to put quite a lot into that reserve pool because it was getting depleted at a rapid rate during that bear market phase in May.
00:08:41.762 - 00:09:07.638, Speaker A: But they managed to sustain it just about. Just about. It did drop to around 18 and a half percent, I seem to remember. But that reserve did its job, of course, that wasn't that long a bearish period. And if you imagine 18 months to two years of that, it will just get destroyed. So if you add on top of that things like Orion money. So Orion money is a front end for ETH anchor.
00:09:07.638 - 00:10:17.218, Speaker A: And ETH anchor allows you to deposit ETH based stablecoins into Orion and then benefit from the 20% that's coming out on anchor. So from a user point of view, you just put DAi or USDC into Orion, and you get spat out a healthy and generous percentage in earning rate because they're leveraging the ETH anchor and anchor itself. If you imagine then that's an ETH anchor, there's probably going to be a Sol anchor and a BSC anchor, and a harmony anchor, and probably a bunch more as well, maybe an atom anchor to bridge to cosmos. So that's basically allowing stakers on those different networks to have a really easy experience of just earning that anchor rate, because it's the most attractive one in crypto right now. And like I said, I'm looking to see whether Akala takes notes from this and tries to do the same thing. So all of this means that borrower demand needs to scale proportionately to the earned demand. So we're looking for a borrower collateral target utilization ratio of around 60% to 65% or higher.
00:10:17.218 - 00:10:58.318, Speaker A: And if we get that, then anchor's yield reserve will gradually increase. So you want to outperform the number of people who are putting their tokens into the earn sign. Of course, during a bear market, we're expecting a lot more people to go defensive and put money into the earn. And like I said, there is now the addition of state ETH into as collateral on anchor. You can imagine that there will be Salana, probably harmony, most definitely, given the way things are evolving there. And here is the Orion interface, and as you can see, earn up to 20% interest on your favorite stablecoins. If you've had a look at the rates on DFI rate recently, they're not that great at the moment.
00:10:58.318 - 00:11:28.326, Speaker A: So this looks attractive. So you have this existential threat of volatile markets, and if we remember back in May, Luna dropped over 81%, and this is what that looked like. It was just this sharp fall off a cliff. It was horrific. It's easy to forget just how bad that was. I remember Doquan getting quite angry on Twitter about people kind of basically jumping on him and saying, well, this is an experiment that went wrong. UST is falling off its peg, and this is a bad, bad thing.
00:11:28.326 - 00:11:40.438, Speaker A: So here's basically what happened. The market crashed. The whole market crashed. And if you remember, it was Elon. Elon was up. It's great. And then he said, actually, you know what? TEslA's no longer accepting bitcoin for payments.
00:11:40.438 - 00:12:16.070, Speaker A: There was a bunch of other stuff as well. But, yeah, it's all Elon's fault. So what happened was b lunar, which is the collateralized bonded lunar, started liquidating, and those liquidations accelerated into a cascading Wave, and that put downward pressure on the lunar price. Then the outstanding loan positions for b lunar on anchor, with an LTV loan to value above the minimum ratio of 50%, were liquidated. And that put huge sell pressure on the Beluna lunar pair on terra swap. And then there was a large premium for lunar relative to b lunar. The liquidation queue flooded the mempool space on the terra blockchain, and basically nobody could do anything.
00:12:16.070 - 00:12:41.742, Speaker A: And the whole thing was a giant mess. And until everything kind of just eased off. Everybody was screwed. Not a good look, not a good thing. So here's basically the long and the short of it. If you can prevent liquidation, you keep everything else healthy. If you can prevent that cascading liquidation tidal wave, then you can actually keep everything in the right place.
00:12:41.742 - 00:13:28.542, Speaker A: And there was actually a big crash a week or so ten days ago, and UST performed perfectly. Nothing really happens. So I think a lot of the lessons learned from that catastrophic event have been taken on board, and there are some very smart people figuring this stuff out. The Nexus team saw that and decided they needed to do something about it, or that they could do something about it. So this is what they said. Following the liquidation collapse that happened in May, Nexus opted to first solve what we consider to be the most immediate need in the terror community, a safe vault for anchor borrow, which maximizes users yield while eliminating the risk of principal protection, principal liquidation. So, as we said, if you want that 20% earn interest rate, there has to be some borrowing, otherwise it doesn't work.
00:13:28.542 - 00:14:10.342, Speaker A: The system cannot support that. But if you want to have a healthy borrowing market, you've got to be able to prevent liquidations. So that was the problem that Nexus is aiming to solve, and they do that via principal protected single asset staking. That is the tilde. If you require nothing else out of this presentation, it's that principal protected single asset staking, the simplest possible version of events, is the best one. So we know that anchor's earned side 20% interest rate is like a benchmark product for people looking to gain exposure to a simple idea. In DeFi, this creates the same product on the borrow side, because the borrow side is exposed to liquidation risk.
00:14:10.342 - 00:14:48.946, Speaker A: That's problematic for some people. So how do they do this exactly? Well, it's actually quite simple. Terra and Anchor have a bot that determines the price of lunar, and this bot basically kind of calculates the price every 30 seconds. It pulls a price every 15 seconds, and then it actually calculates the price off chain, and then it republishes it to the chain on chain every 30 seconds. So that means that there's a gap in the price. What nexus does is they create the same bot, but they reprice everything every 15 seconds, which means they can actually front run the terabot. Weird.
00:14:48.946 - 00:15:30.326, Speaker A: Yes, it is a bit weird, but that's effectively what they're doing. They're saying there is a window of time in which we can jump in and understand what the price movement is going to be before the liquidation engine on anchor determines that a liquidation can happen. And that means there's this little pocket of time where they can get busy and they can optimize the LTV so they can say, okay, you can have this LTV at a certain level and then we can know ahead of time whether something bad is going to happen and protect you from that and perform the necessary operations to keep you safe. That is it. It's a front running bot. And of course that raises some questions. But effectively there are three pieces to that and here's how they work.
00:15:30.326 - 00:16:15.838, Speaker A: So the first part is the automated anchor liquidation level optimization just trips off the tongue, doesn't it? So this is what happens. Nexus optimizes borrowing capacities and protects open borrower positions from liquidation. Depositors in the vault before liquidation is triggered by automatically paying down at risk loans when necessary. So they check whether you're going to be liquidated, and if you are at risk of liquidation, then they perform the necessary actions to protect you, which means paying back some UST. Then there's the automated borrowed UST function. So this serves as a backstop for paying down positions in danger of liquidation. On anchor, borrowed UST is deposited into the vault and deployed in low risk yield maximizing strategies and is only diverted to repaying loans in danger of liquidation when the hazard manifests.
00:16:15.838 - 00:17:06.078, Speaker A: So there's this flywheel where UST can be generating yield and the excess of that yield can be used to pay off loans at risk of liquidation. Then there's the automated ANC rewards claiming and interest balancing. So as we said before, when you're borrowing on anchor, you get ANC rewards which you have to claim manually. This automates all of that, and then the portion of the rewards is used to pay off interest accrued from borrowing positions to stave off liquidation sustainably. So your ANC is now paying off bits of your loan as well. So it's hopefully paying off the interest. Are you starting to see how powerful this is? It's basically taking all the kind of different pieces of yield and interest earning that happen in the market and just using them to carve off pieces of debt so that they're just managing that a bit more sustainably.
00:17:06.078 - 00:17:27.894, Speaker A: Crazy stuff. Absolutely love it. So I know what you're thinking here. You have an anchor price oracle, and you have a Nexus price oracle. What happens if something goes wrong? Well, there are three different modes for operations on Nexus, and here's how they work. The first one up is the optimal mode. This says the nexus Oracle itself is functioning perfectly.
00:17:27.894 - 00:18:06.070, Speaker A: LTV management is happening at smart contract level, and that ensures protection of liquidation whether the web app is functioning or not. So if the whole system gets clogged up and there's too much demand, all of this is happening at the smart contract level without any of that getting in the way, which means it just functions. So that's optimal mode. Everything is. It's taking the LTV loan to value ratio and just getting as close to the maximum as possible to earn you the maximum interest, the maximum collateral, and then triggering the safety mechanisms as and when they're required. However, the Nexus Oracle could fail. What happens then? Then safe mode kicks in.
00:18:06.070 - 00:18:44.754, Speaker A: The protocol automatically changes the LTV management strategy to capture the anchor price oracle instead. So instead of repricing every 15 seconds, it reprices every 30 seconds. So it goes back to the default standard. And of course the whole point of Nexus is to front run that oracle and get a better rate. But of course, in the event that the Nexus Oracle fails, then you go to the next best thing, which is the anchor price oracle itself. And then what happens is they enforce ultra conservative LTV levels, so the maximum LTV at the moment is 60%. So the LTV levels will be enforced to keep you out of danger of being liquidated if something like the may crash happens.
00:18:44.754 - 00:19:17.022, Speaker A: So they model the may crash and said, if that were to happen again, this is the LTV that would keep you safe. Ultra conservative. But then there's a third mode, emergency mode. What happens if the Nexus Oracle fails and the anchor oracle fails? Well, then what happens is this, the Nexus decreases their target LTV to half instantly. So from 60% to 30% or thereabouts. Because if the anchor oracle fails, then anchor liquidations are paused. So the whole anchor market shuts down, but the rest of the market does not.
00:19:17.022 - 00:19:38.278, Speaker A: So you could see, for instance, a rapid decrease in price in lunar. And that means that once anchor is switched on, then anything that's above the maximum LTV will be instantly triggered and liquidated. And you don't want that to happen. So Nexus automatically assumes the worst, I. E. Collateral assets are depreciating. Of course, if Luna goes up, then there's no issue.
00:19:38.278 - 00:20:15.722, Speaker A: But if Luna is decreasing, and let's face it, if something catastrophic happens, it's usually because of too much load. Then Nexus does what it needs to do, which is decreases the target LTV by half instantly. And then once anchor comes the price oracle comes back online, then the system reboots. But hopefully if they model it correctly, you will be safe. So at the moment there's safe mode and emergency mode those are active right now and there will be an upgrade to bring optimal mode online Q four 2021. That's exciting. And that's kind of the capital flow.
00:20:15.722 - 00:20:40.018, Speaker A: You can find all this on the Nexus light paper, which I highly recommend reading. Actually. It's very easy to find on their website. If you go to Nexus protocol at the top, you can find the light paper there. Beautifully designed, very, very simple to read and very well written. It's just a joy to go through. So this will give you an idea of the capital flow for Nexus.
00:20:40.018 - 00:21:20.466, Speaker A: I won't go into that now, but I will briefly touch on the last two products, or at least the next two products that are coming. The Ust mirror vault is a delta neutral strategy using mirror. Mirror is a protocol for creating synthetic assets on terra. So previously we've looked at MSLV, which is mirror's version of silver. So you can trade silver, you can trade Tesla, I believe, on there. What the mirrorville is looking to do is outperform anchor's 20% rate because 20% is not enough. So by using a delta neutral strategy, your UST deposits could be earning considerably more.
00:21:20.466 - 00:21:56.286, Speaker A: So I'm curious to see how that one's going to play out. And we will look at that in a future episode because again, it's fascinating stuff. And then the other product is ethnexis. So ethnexis is basically a staking reward product for ETH. So they're looking to determine a staking reward mechanism for ETH holders that will outperform standard ETH staking. Doesn't that sound fun? I think the target is around 10% or something like that. So could be very, very exciting for people who are long term ETH holders and are looking to gain extra rewards.
00:21:56.286 - 00:22:34.720, Speaker A: Because we should all be greedy, shouldn't we? So that is Nexus protocol. It's one of a suite of very interesting products that are coming on the market at Terra. The mirrorvolt definitely going to be something that we look at as we kind of prepare for what might be a multi year bear. These are going to be the products that keep us warm during that long winter. If you have any suggestions for us for first look, drop them in the comments below. This was an absolute pleasure. It's easy to get carried away and get too excited about Terra, but it really is pointing the way towards a collection of Defi products that really represent the best of what Defi can do.
00:22:34.720 - 00:22:59.090, Speaker A: And it's exciting to see how it's developed since that crash in May when everything looked bad. But more and more products like this are coming along and just bolstering that ecosystem, and it's great to see, but like I said, I want to see other ecosystems adopt some of these strategies as well, because it just makes so much sense. I'll see you on the next one. Peace. Bye.
