00:00:00.250 - 00:00:27.366, Speaker A: And this is a really interesting take by Arthur Hayes, which we wrote up at the defiant. Arthur Hayes, you know, very well respected investor. He's a Bidmex co founder, I guess, like well respected in terms of like his investments and, you know, thought leadership and so on. But he was under regulatory scrutiny. So anyways, that caveat there, but he.
00:00:27.388 - 00:00:29.606, Speaker B: Has some really smart takes on the market.
00:00:29.708 - 00:00:36.038, Speaker C: And he was saying that bitcoin is rallying and will continue to rally because.
00:00:36.204 - 00:00:40.498, Speaker B: Not because of the ETF, but because of macro conditions.
00:00:40.594 - 00:00:49.494, Speaker C: So his argument is that the US is about to embark on this spending.
00:00:49.542 - 00:00:59.454, Speaker B: Frenzy because of the international conflicts that it's involved in, namely Ukraine and Israel Hamas war.
00:00:59.572 - 00:01:08.386, Speaker C: So with all this increased spending, with the economy not improving in the long.
00:01:08.408 - 00:01:11.890, Speaker B: Term, with inflation still not under control.
00:01:12.040 - 00:01:18.386, Speaker C: But overall with the economy not picking up, that means that long term rates.
00:01:18.498 - 00:01:21.398, Speaker B: Will be lower, there will be a.
00:01:21.404 - 00:01:27.730, Speaker C: Lot of spending, which means that more liquidity in the market, lower rates, and.
00:01:27.820 - 00:01:35.514, Speaker B: That, of course, is fuel for crypto, for risk assets. This is the argument that Arthur Hayes is making.
00:01:35.632 - 00:01:38.406, Speaker C: The US is going to be involved.
00:01:38.438 - 00:01:42.826, Speaker B: In two international conflicts, Ukraine and Israel. Hamas.
00:01:42.938 - 00:01:50.714, Speaker C: That there will be increased spending because of these military conflicts, that the economy.
00:01:50.762 - 00:02:07.974, Speaker A: Is in bad shape and it will continue deteriorating. This all means that treasury bonds and the US dollar will sell off and that investors will seek returns elsewhere and.
00:02:08.012 - 00:02:11.160, Speaker C: Also with more liquidity in the market from.
00:02:12.890 - 00:02:21.378, Speaker B: Higher spending and lower rates. That is usually fuel for crypto and for risk assets.
00:02:21.474 - 00:02:25.746, Speaker C: So that to me, is more convincing.
00:02:25.858 - 00:02:31.166, Speaker B: Than a bitcoin ETF driving a long term rally. Like I see the argument for a.
00:02:31.188 - 00:02:36.926, Speaker C: Short term rally from ETF news. For sure, I don't see ETF news.
00:02:37.028 - 00:02:39.550, Speaker B: Kickstarting a full fledged bull market.
00:02:39.700 - 00:02:42.590, Speaker C: But if Arthur Hayes is right about.
00:02:42.660 - 00:02:49.930, Speaker B: These macro conditions, then that could be a much more sustainable setup for increasing crypto prices.
