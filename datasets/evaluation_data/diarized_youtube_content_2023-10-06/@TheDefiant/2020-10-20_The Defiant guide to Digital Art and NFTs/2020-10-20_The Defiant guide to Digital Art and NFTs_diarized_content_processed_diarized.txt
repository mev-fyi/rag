00:00:25.010 - 00:00:35.670, Speaker A: Face the trash, Mary, don't.
00:00:37.370 - 00:00:37.734, Speaker B: Eat.
00:00:37.772 - 00:01:26.840, Speaker A: Present the kission. Damn straight. This week it's art. Let's pick it apart put the horse before the car think you're smart? Take your eyes off the chart and lead with your heart. Shall we start? Digital art. It's divisive, it's provocative, and now it's highly profitable. But can there really be art hiding behind something as meaningless as a simple QR code? Or is it a cruel experiment designed to teach us the meaning of greed? All of that coming up.
00:01:26.840 - 00:02:18.706, Speaker A: Hello, it's art. And yes, I'm super excited to talk about this one, because art is something that hits deeply home to things that I care about immensely, the value of creative endeavor. Now, advanced warning, this is a huge topic and we are going to cover a lot of ground, like a lot, and we probably won't cover all of it. But anyway, suffice it to say that it's been quite a ride for the NFT space in the last month. There was the rise and immediate fall of few, with its accompanying surge of social media outrage. There was the meteoric rise of meme, with its promise of NFT farming and new experiments in art and technology. But the news that really connected with a lot of people was the auction of Robert Alice's Block 21 from his series Portraits of a mind at Christie's on the 7 October.
00:02:18.706 - 00:03:14.538, Speaker A: Now, this piece is just one of a monumental collection of monolithic painted discs in 24 carat gold leaf, suspended pigment and acrylic on canvas. But the big thing is that it also came with an NFT, which is a core part of the artwork. Now, that NFT is developed by Async Labs and is described as spatio temporally connected to the artwork, meaning, basically, that the digital component is only visible during daylight within the time zone in which it is geographically located. And as the owner of the NFT, the buyer can control the visibility of the artwork by changing where it's located. So an NFT with actual functionality built in, not just a cool collectible, you know what I mean? So if we look at the Christie's page for the piece, the estimate was twelve to $18,000. But it sold for $131,250. Robert Alice nailed it.
00:03:14.538 - 00:04:16.670, Speaker A: And if I'm honest, when I look at this piece and I look at the concept and the thought behind it, I think it's fantastic. It's bold, it's monolithic, it's beautiful, and yeah, it's art. And yeah, I want it. It took him three years to complete the series, and it's like a genuine artistic achievement, you know? So what was the idea behind the NFT? Well, according to an interview with the Career Times, by showcasing and selling an NFT at Christie's, I hope other contemporary artists will take a look at the NFT space, not just for its radical creative potential, but for its real potential in giving artists more control and a better stake in their practice over the long term. Blockchain, unlike the Internet, suffers because it's not an inherently visual medium of place. It's textual and ledger based. Yet its histories and the complex cultural and political dynamics out of which it was born fascinated me, particularly the founding myth of Satoshi.
00:04:16.670 - 00:05:21.106, Speaker A: There is so much here to unpack, but really it boils down to this. We have a technology, but we also have a mystique, a narrative, a mythology behind it, which is the bit that's seductive, the code on its own isn't the thing. And I think that is the inherent paradox of NFTs, their appeal, why people use them, and why ultimately, they could be considered art and artistic. And this is something I struggle with every week as I try to bring to life the stories that speak to me in the space. And I've long been fascinated by digital art, not least because I find myself constantly interrogating my own work on its artistic merits. And whether film or video, which is released freely into the world and consumed freely as well, can even pretend to be considered alongside art like this does the effort and work I put into a video like the Avagotchi one count in the same way as Robert Alice's and crypto, as it always does, reduces this question down to simply, will anyone buy it?
00:05:21.288 - 00:05:51.798, Speaker C: History teaches us one certain thing, that critics, when they fish out the crystal ball and start trying to guess what the future will be, are almost invariably wrong. And I don't think we are ever again obliged to look at a plywood box or a row of bricks on the floor, or a videotape of some twit from the University of central paranoia sticking pins in himself and think, this is the real thing. This is the necessary art of our time. This needs respect, because it isn't, and it doesn't, and nobody cares.
00:05:51.894 - 00:06:37.834, Speaker A: And that brings us, neatly, to pomp pom pom pom pom pom pom pom. Anthony Pompliano, or Pomp as he likes to call himself, loves to troll the DFI and Ethereum communities. Spoiler it's a game, everyone, and he's winning. And in his September 21 newsletter, he had this to say Jason Williams and I are making a big bet on digital art. In my opinion, one of the easiest ways to pursue a non consensus investment strategy is to look for markets that have either a been abandoned by the crowd, or b are so new that most investors do not realize that they exist. Selecting the right market is the most important decision. This second category, the industries that are incredibly early in their lifecycle, is my favorite place to go hunting for opportunity.
00:06:37.834 - 00:07:11.522, Speaker A: Bang, bang. Jason Williams and I have been searching for a new market that is too early for most people to have spent the time building an investment thesis. We finally think we found the perfect opportunity. Digital art. Similar to how bitcoin is superior to gold in almost every way, digital art is superior to traditional art in almost every way also. Well, that is a big statement, and it's one I don't actually agree with. And given his history, I kind of feel that pomp is probably just trolling here to a degree.
00:07:11.522 - 00:07:52.302, Speaker A: But let me make the case for traditional art. I used to spend a lot of time making films, and one of the clients I made films for was Sotheby's. Now, Sotheby's and Christie's are the top auction houses in the world. And we would go to Sotheby's and we would take our cameras and our filming equipment and we would film the paintings. So you're this close to pieces of art that cost millions of dollars, and I really do mean that, millions of dollars. And if your camera were to fall over and tear a hole in that piece of art, well, that would be a massive insurance bill. But what was always striking to me was the way you would be this close to a painting, and you could see the imperfections, you could see the roughness of brushstrokes.
00:07:52.302 - 00:08:37.230, Speaker A: You could see that it was made by human hands. And there was an immediacy to that impression, there was an immediacy to that experience, and it brought you closer to the human being that had made it in the first place. And that is very, very special. And I always feel like that humanity of real art is the thing that digital art will never be able to replicate. And you simply cannot state that it is superior to physical art because of this one very reason. Now, one of my best friends and collaborators is Simon Wong, a frankly intimidating, creative multi hyphenate with not one, but, well, probably five strings to his bow. He's as skilled a writer as he is musician, actor, author and artist.
00:08:37.230 - 00:08:59.030, Speaker A: Now he creates street art effectively using sharpies, using his hands to manipulate those kind of permanent strokes of the sharpies to the shapes of his choosing. And we have been arguing for weeks and weeks and weeks now over the validity of NFTs as digital art and whether all this crypto malarkey is basically just a bunch of Bs.
00:09:00.650 - 00:09:33.742, Speaker B: So my name's Simon won. This isn't a cup of tea. This is a sharpies. Because that's how I do my art. I do cats and exploding korean robot tanks with animated sushi and cat girls on the shoulders of their dads. Why do they wear under MCT shirts with a small boy who has a tool to explode things? And this is a pineapple. Essentially, it's asking the question, what is valuable? I see everyone wanting NFts.
00:09:33.742 - 00:09:47.398, Speaker B: I understand that it's essentially a ticket. You own a ticket or a voucher and maybe you can swap it for something else. Whoa. So great. I've always blown my mind. Wow. It's changed the art world.
00:09:47.398 - 00:10:06.960, Speaker B: Has it, though? I don't understand it. I make art. I do it because I want to. I do it because I like it. I do it because in that moment where I'm scratching colors on it just makes you feel good, just makes you feel nice. And at the end, if you want to buy it, you can. I sell things.
00:10:06.960 - 00:10:41.318, Speaker B: I sell them all around the world. People like them because they look nice on a wall. Nfts, though, it's just a jPeg. What I would like is someone to make these into something awesome. And if they create a buzz, if they create some kind of new wave or a way of thinking or just challenge the way everyone keeps saying that art is changing because of blockchain and ownership and value is changing. Is it though one person owns something or one person shares something with someone else? I don't know. I'm a moron.
00:10:41.318 - 00:10:55.562, Speaker B: I literally draw cats and pineapples with felt tip pens. Don't listen to me. I'm not an artist. This isn't weed. Anyway, love you, blockchain.
00:10:55.706 - 00:11:31.386, Speaker A: Now, coming back to pomp, he's been good enough to actually disclose some of his recent purchases, one of which was Trevor Jones's Bitcoin bull. Now, this is a physical artwork that's been given an additional augmented reality layer, which can be viewed using his own creative app. That animation was then minted as three NFTs of increasing scarcity. Gold, bronze and silver. And finally, as a one off piece in its own right. And that animation, which was a single, unique, original piece, was bought on Nifty Gateway for $55,555. Now, pump actually bid on that piece of digital art.
00:11:31.386 - 00:12:06.494, Speaker A: And he didn't get it. But what did he do next? He immediately purchased the original painting that the NFT is based on for 55 grand directly from the artist. So this original artwork, with all its texture, with all its craftsmanship, was worth less than the animation that he pulled from it as a piece of digital art. Wow. Like, wow. Digital art is superior to traditional art in almost every way. Well, the headline here is that the animation was sold for more than the physical artwork.
00:12:06.494 - 00:12:41.150, Speaker A: Not by much, granted, but it is a win for digital nonetheless, which kind of makes me sad. But anyway, trevor is, to be fair, a bit of a legend. And he was experimenting with QR codes as painting and augmented reality before finding his way into blockchain. And respect to him, because I personally think the work is great. But I guess the question is what it's always been. Art is really only worth what someone is prepared to pay for it, or it's only worth what it's worth to you. I don't know.
00:12:41.150 - 00:13:19.402, Speaker A: I still don't know. Now, digital technology introduced the world to the idea of limitless facsimiles of objects that had previously had value, primarily because of the energy expended in their manufacture. Let's think of music. For instance. The cost of printing a CD was X, but you could sell it for more just because it had this sort of digital quality that was greater than vinyl records or cassette tapes, which was a total illusion. Now, what NFTs do is they create an analog of physical scarcity, the next best thing, so to speak. Or if you were to believe, pomp, the better than previous thing.
00:13:19.402 - 00:13:45.026, Speaker A: That's the new thing that's kind of better, but worth $555 more. Now that brings us on to one of my favorite projects, which is meme. And we've covered meme in depth in a previous film. But if you remember, their original proposition was to create experiments at the intersection of art and technology. The thing is, though, the art bit needs thought. It needs artists willing to commit to the platform. And they found one.
00:13:45.026 - 00:14:04.506, Speaker A: Sven above Sven uses Blender, which is a 3d CGI creation software, and Houdini to create these kind of cartoonish CGI simulations, which are really just designed to put a big smile on your face. Sven's first collection dropped on meme recently, but there was one piece left over which he wasn't really sure what to.
00:14:04.528 - 00:14:51.114, Speaker D: Do with the pineapple. Ponzi was the work I created initially for the pool, but then we decided to put only four works in the pool, and I had it half done already. And it was sitting on my computer. Then I put up a poll in Twitter and asked people if I should auction it on super rare as the fifth and last work. And pretty much everybody said yes. ET, the lead developer of meme, he's seen that poll and he approached me asking if I wouldn't want to auction it on the meme platform. And I said, well, is that possible? He said, not yet, but I'm writing like a mechanism for it and we can auction it one of one right there.
00:14:51.114 - 00:14:52.362, Speaker D: So that's how it started.
00:14:52.496 - 00:14:59.834, Speaker A: So the meme team organized an auction and, well, check this out. 36 grand. Nailed it.
00:14:59.952 - 00:15:34.630, Speaker D: Whenever something sells for a high price, you get a lot of fireballs and a lot of attention. People talk about it. We took a part of the profits and donated it to Shifi and back to the community. So that's cool, because obviously the higher the selling price, the more we donate, but definitely the selling price. It's not everything, and definitely to me, it's not the most important aspect of it. And sometimes it's a bit of a distraction. But right now it's important because it's the first time that we see nfts selling for such a high price.
00:15:34.630 - 00:15:48.746, Speaker D: So people, you just take it more serious if it sells for considerable amount of money. So now that I'm having one of the higher priced NFTs, yeah, that definitely makes me proud, makes me happy. It's good for the space.
00:15:48.848 - 00:16:34.774, Speaker A: There's an important point here, which is about curatorship and audience, and the meme audience is already geared up to be hungry for this kind of product, and it's a valuable community. And Sven was the first artist to really launch there. And all of this adds up to a heady recipe for success. But if you head to opensea or rarible, you're confronted with a confusing jumble of collectibles, crap art, and, let's be honest, scams. And rarible and super rare both found themselves in the news recently for giving the boot to successful creators on their platform, albeit for very, very different reason. And one of those was Robness, who is kind of what you might call a. He writes everything in caps, he's prolific, but he's also kind of fascinating.
00:16:34.774 - 00:17:21.830, Speaker A: Now, Robness was kicked off super rare, which prides itself on curating an elevated level of artistic talent. And this was because he posted a trash gif entitled 64 Gallon Tota. And that looks like this. Now, this is a manipulated image of a 64 gallon trash can. And if you google it, you will find it labeled as a bear resistant residential heavy duty, two wheeled trash can with attached bear tight lid. A bear resistant trash can? How crypto is that? Well, this definitely caused a hoohah, but I suspect it wasn't because of the trash can. According to John Crane, CEO of Super Rare, Robness had switched from tokenizing art that he created himself to art created by others.
00:17:21.830 - 00:17:58.526, Speaker A: And he cites the bitcoin logo and an ethereum logo in there. And yeah, I don't know. Again, are we getting down to this question of what is art now? As I said before, I've always been a fan of Warhol. I've always loved the disposable, mass produced mentality of the factory, the way he produces art. And to be fair, the space that I'm in now is probably my attempt to create my own version of the factory. And Warhol's obsession with taking everyday pop culture constructs and elevating them to fine art really resonates with me. With Warhol, there was always this deep sense of irony.
00:17:58.526 - 00:18:05.878, Speaker A: He was weird and effective, but you kind of knew he was trolling everyone at the same time. There was just a lot of humor there.
00:18:05.964 - 00:18:10.794, Speaker B: What was the interest to you then in that Campbell soup tin? What gave you the idea of doing that?
00:18:10.992 - 00:18:12.426, Speaker E: Oh, I used to eat it every day.
00:18:12.448 - 00:18:13.420, Speaker A: I still do.
00:18:15.150 - 00:18:15.770, Speaker E: I don't know.
00:18:15.840 - 00:18:20.266, Speaker A: And Mr. Billy boy, I think, has some too. Are you american, Mr. Billy Boy?
00:18:20.368 - 00:18:23.638, Speaker E: No, from Mars, I think. Oh, Mars.
00:18:23.734 - 00:19:11.070, Speaker A: So I was ready to dismiss Robness as just a loudmouth, probably on account of all the caps he uses. But if I look at his body of work, I think he was following a similar path in the digital space. And ultimately, this is a reawakening of the dardaoist movement, poking fun at the art establishment while asking the viewer to seriously contemplate how he appreciate art. Now, Robnis, since being kicked off the platform, has launched a tokenized art experiment called Trash. Built his own community around his own token. This is kind of a punk rock you to the current NFT art establishment, and good for him. It's not really my place to make a value judgment on the art itself, but the debate and actually the way it was handled by both super rare and Robnuss is a credit to both of them.
00:19:11.070 - 00:20:16.586, Speaker A: And that credit is definitely not something that can be said about Blue Kirby. Now, I don't really want to dwell too long on this particular saga, but Kirby, who was a meme legend popularizing few understand, for instance, had seen particular success by being essentially the voice of Wifi, the breakout D five success story of 2020. And using that reach, he quickly became the top seller on wearable by selling NFTs. But then the farming bubble deflated and curbs moved to a new project called Off Blue, which obviously had its own token blue. And it didn't take long before the blue account had sold around 2400 e or a little under a million bucks. A million bucks? A million bucks for NFTs. I'm going to say it again, a million bucks for NFTs.
00:20:16.586 - 00:20:41.846, Speaker A: And this was all despite there being little clue as to what this money would actually be used for. And then he disappeared and took the money with him. Or did he, you know, I don't know. And to be honest, I don't really care. All I need to know is written in the closure notice that he left on the off blue website. And it goes a little something like this. Yes, we were going to buy a banksy, cars Warhols and auction them on off blue.
00:20:41.846 - 00:21:38.426, Speaker A: This would have created unimaginable hype for off blue and positioned the decentralized Sotheby's for long term success. I should have communicated the game plan step by step in the manifesto, but I was afraid of the plans leaking and someone else beating us to it. I'm sure someone else will be following the playbook. It's a great one. Why bring digital artists to the blockchain when you can bring the living legends? I sat and thought about this for a long time because it's a cute shell. Decentralized Sotheby's kind of makes sense, and it feels like the little guys closed out by the elite world of art, and decentralizing it is tantamount to democratizing it. Well, I have a big issue with that, because art is the most democratic form of self expression there is.
00:21:38.426 - 00:22:48.430, Speaker A: Everyone at some point has sketched something, drawn something, been forced to use artistic abstraction to convey a point, even if it's just, again, the pictionary. So how does blockchain solve this? And how do I know that Kirby himself understands how to value a banksy or a warhole so as to create an investable position or pay the right price for the art? Surely the skill actually lies in identifying artists of promise and investing in them early and living legends. Well, Banksy and cause, sure. But this guy Warhol, well, he died in 1987. And there was another thing about this closure notice that bothered me. And I went back to that pomp newsletter and within it I found a sponsorship notice from masterworks in the email and it looks like this isn't it a coincidence that Kirby mentioned specifically Banksy and cause out of all the artists that he could have mentioned, no, I don't think so. Now, Warhol reveled in mass produced art and instantly disposable celebrity.
00:22:48.430 - 00:23:15.370, Speaker A: And in Kirby, that's exactly what we have. And now he's gone. And rarerible's response to Kirby was thus. And that was that someone sold something on a platform designed to allow them to do exactly that. And then it turned out what they were selling maybe wasn't what it looked like it was, and all went. I have simply two words for you. Buyer beware.
00:23:15.370 - 00:23:50.786, Speaker A: But I guess there should be some scrutiny on the platforms themselves and how they facilitate artists, how they police themselves. So I'm going to do what I do best and turn the camera on myself. Yes, I made some NFTs, and I made them from one of the videos on this channel where I get hit in the face with a banana. Is that art? Well, I ask you that now. I was going to sell them, and I was going to sell them on Opensea and on Rarible, but you know what? I just didn't feel right, so I gave them away for free instead. And I'll tell you why. It's because I consider myself a filmmaker.
00:23:50.786 - 00:24:11.822, Speaker A: I've never been comfortable with calling myself an artist because I don't consider what I do art. And you know what I learned making these NFTs? Yeah, it's really expensive, it's clunky, it's annoying. It's pretty much every experience you have on Ethereum these days. But fortunately, there's one platform that recognizes this and is making a move to do something about it.
00:24:11.956 - 00:25:17.806, Speaker E: Nothing is perfect right now in the blockchain land. It is all extremely experimental, and we're all trying to figure out what is the best for us. Rewriting all of our contracts from solidity to rust is a big deal because wasm to us, is much more powerful than the EVM. Why is that important for creators? It is really cheap right now, super cheap, and allows us to do a lot more things than we could do within the Ethereum landscape. We can do protocol layer royalties. So there's one type of royalties where, like, super rare has been doing for quite a while, where you sell your art and then someone else buys it later on, then you get a percentage of that cut. These kind of royalties are more of transaction royalties, where if you create something of value, let's say a gaming asset or a piece of art that people actually use back and forth and trade and move around, you can actually accrue 30% revenue from each of those transactions.
00:25:17.806 - 00:26:28.234, Speaker E: And that to us, is going to be pretty powerful. I come from a background where I've dealt with shares of stock and with credit card swiping, basically you swipe a credit card at Starbucks and we'll give you fractional shares of publicly traded stock as a reward. So I got to play with the metal of the current financial system, seeing how gross all of that is, and knowing that we can just get rid of all that and let entrepreneurs to directly interact with the settlement layer, meaning moving large sums of money from A to B without needing to interact with other companies, that's huge. So Carlo and I, my co founder, are driving from Berlin to Lisbon, Portugal right now, and we're actually audiobook listening to snow crash. And just what's going on in there with the metaverses, like crypto voxels, it's just so surreal with entries and passports and all these different angles. I'm more excited about just being able to explore NFTs as packages of these bits of data that we can basically create these ownership mingling goodness. We'll figure out how it goes.
00:26:28.352 - 00:26:39.500, Speaker A: Now look, for all the excitement around NFTs and digital art, I still find myself coming back to one big question. Is it all actually just a bunch of.
00:26:40.830 - 00:27:27.274, Speaker D: Right now, a lot of people focus a lot on the crypto aspect of it and not so much on the art aspect of it, which at this point I think is fine because it's just so new to everybody and it's hard to understand why those images and videos and all that stuff has value. So crypto is sort of the explanation for it. I think in the long term, the art angle of it or the art aspect of it will become more dominant and important when everybody understood, yeah, I don't know. Bitcoin is real money and NFTs have real value. If that's not a debate anymore at all, people will focus only on the art.
00:27:27.392 - 00:28:06.710, Speaker A: And so I find myself in a weird place now because there's no doubt that there's artistic merit in the films I create. But if I am to call myself an artist, I would find it highly presumptuous and a little bit cringe, if I'm honest. And I guess I just have too much respect for the art of art itself. And maybe I shouldn't. Maybe I should just focus on what I consider great art, which is much more than the raw materials or the pure execution. It's the story, it's the philosophy and it's what I like to call the factor. And there hasn't been a better factor moment in art than this peach from west England's finest provocateur.
00:28:06.710 - 00:28:53.334, Speaker A: Art connoisseurs could only watch in horror as an expensive piece was shredded before their eyes. I work with actors a lot, and actors will often criticize you if you say a film looks amazing and challenge you to tell them, how did it make you feel? And that, for me, is the bit I listen to. And that's why I feel that pomp is wrong. Digital art is not superior to traditional art in almost every single way. Digital art is just art. Traditional art is just art, take it or leave it. And that's stop trying to create hierarchies based on externalities like tech or what someone said, just ask yourself how it makes you feel.
00:28:53.334 - 00:29:01.242, Speaker A: And hopefully these films that I make make you feel challenged, or make you laugh, or make you annoyed, but at least feel something.
00:29:01.376 - 00:29:39.702, Speaker C: The basic project of art is always to make the world whole and comprehensible, to restore it to us in all its glory and its occasional nastiness, not through argument, but through feeling. And then to close the gap between you and everything that is not you. And in this way, to pass from feeling to meaning. It's not something that committees can do. It's not a task achieved by groups or by movements. It's done by individuals. Each person mediating in some way between a sense of history and an experience of the world.
00:29:39.836 - 00:30:04.800, Speaker A: We are subjected to so much noise and produced content, it's easy to miss the things that might have the greatest value. But that's exactly why art still has a place. It's to remind us that we can be transported and taken beyond the ordinary, that we can be challenged, that we could be provoked. And for me, I want to provoke you, to challenge you, to question your own moral compass. And I want to do it without you realizing I'm doing it.
00:30:07.410 - 00:30:27.538, Speaker B: So I'm in here, my friend's art gallery, and he's going, look, this is like four or 500 quid. It's a limited edition print. What is the difference between that and a digital print? Where is the value? I am surrounded by art on a daily. My friends finds this gallery. We sell original stuff. I love it in here. I'm struggling because this is digital art.
00:30:27.538 - 00:30:39.286, Speaker B: This could only be done really digitally, but it's a physical thing. How does that physical thing and the digital thing blend art, bitcoin, blockchain, crypto art. How is it going to work? I do art. It's one of mine.

00:30:41.310 - 00:30:52.246, Speaker B: Commission piece. It's beautiful. How do I get it on a blockchain? How do I become a token?
00:30:52.358 - 00:31:22.440, Speaker A: You know, sometimes art, like real art, art that you can buy, is right there in front of you. It's in the Qs, in the R's, in the whole Alphabet of visual media. And as for you, the struggling artists, here are some wise words for you from my own personal hero, Andy Warhol. Don't think about making art. Just get it done. Let everyone else decide if it's good or bad, whether they love it or hate it. And while they're deciding, make even more art.
00:31:22.440 - 00:31:31.570, Speaker A: I've been super massive, and this has been one long ass video. But a good one. Thank you for taking the journey with me. Peace.
