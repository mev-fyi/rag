00:00:00.330 - 00:00:24.160, Speaker A: Good morning. It is Tuesday, which means it's time for another tutorial. And if you've noticed, the last couple of weeks we've been looking at simulators, different ways for you to get exposure to defi protocols like Defi Saver, like the instadap simulator. And today we're doing another one. This time it's specifically for trying out liquidity provision. And we're going to be using LP Royale. Royale, which.
00:00:24.160 - 00:00:44.778, Speaker A: Yeah, love that movie. If you haven't seen it, go watch it now. I know a lot of people have been talking about these the last couple of weeks, asking me where on earth we get them from. I'm going to do it once. This is a Nan light pavo tube. The small one, the six inch worm. This is the one that's magnetic like that.
00:00:44.778 - 00:00:59.934, Speaker A: This is also a Nan light pavo tube. This is the 60 centimeter one. And that is it. That's enough about the neon tubes. Now on with the tutorial. So we're going to go be going to lproyale.com. Now, there's something you just have to bear in mind here.
00:00:59.934 - 00:01:41.078, Speaker A: You will have to sign up, and you will have to do that by adding your email address, which feels a bit off for a decentralized service. But this is the way of the world, and if you're okay with that, then we can proceed. If you're not okay with that, well, then you probably shouldn't watch any further. So, on LP Royale, as it says here, we can try liquidity providing without the risk. You can learn how liquidity providing works, compete with others, and level up your defi skills without investing real money. And as we were looking at with Defi Saver, this is a great way to start to understand how the different protocols can work with each other, and particularly what impermanent loss means. Now, if you don't know what impermanent loss is, I'll just do a quick roundup.
00:01:41.078 - 00:02:23.734, Speaker A: When you add liquidity to a pool, you add tokens in a ratio, so you will have 50% worth of, say, ETH and 50% worth of DAi. Those tokens go into the pool and are represented by LP tokens. Those LP tokens represent your share of the pool, and they have factored in as a ratio of each other. Now, if the price of ETH goes up in relation to Dai, then the ratio of your assets will change, and that means you will suffer impermanent loss. Now, it's impermanent because the price of ETH, for example, if it goes up, could also come back down again. So you might be able to withdraw your LP tokens at the same level as you put them in. But this is crypto.
00:02:23.734 - 00:03:30.218, Speaker A: I mean, how often does that happen? So when you think about liquidity provision, you're always measuring up how much doing so is worth compared to simply just holding the assets themselves. Now, if you're doing pairs like Dai or USDT stablecoin pairs with each other, then obviously the price variation is not going to be very much, barely anything. But if it's something like ETH, then you want to make sure firstly that the fees that you get for providing liquidity are pretty good and you're in the right zone. If you saw our piece on uniswap version three, you can tell uniswap where you want the liquidity to be concentrated, but there's also things like you can stake in farms and you can also gain additional tokens for providing liquidity and use those LP tokens for other things. And you just have to do your math to figure out whether the impermanent loss is something you can swallow, because the overall gains will be greater than the ones you lose. It can be quite difficult to figure these things out. And particularly if you have a new token for a new market that's, come on, that is going up at a rate of knots, then the il can be, yeah, can be pretty hefty.
00:03:30.218 - 00:04:12.378, Speaker A: So something to bear in mind. So if we take a look at LP Royale, it's a pretty cutesy ui, it's got a kind of old school game aesthetic, and down here you'll see a leaderboard. And basically if you do well on this platform, then you can redeem what you win for prizes. And I believe you have to connect your wallet to do so. So you can learn, you can compete, you can win, and it's risk free, so you're not putting real money in. So you get a chance to try out liquidity provision. Given how important lp liquidity providing is to defi and how open it is to anybody, I think taking the time to learn it risk free like this is definitely worth doing.
00:04:12.378 - 00:04:34.482, Speaker A: So I've already signed up. As I said before, you will have to put in your email address and a username. It will send you a link to log in. I have already done so. And once you do, you come to this page. It gives you a couple of pages on what liquidity providing is understanding gains, net market gains versus liquidity pool gains. This is exactly what we're talking about.
00:04:34.482 - 00:05:15.134, Speaker A: It says net market gains come when the price of an asset in the pool that you are providing liquidity for increases on the open market. Liquidity pool gains are driven by the bonding curve and the swapping of tokens, plus any fees you've collected during this time. Market returns include asset token price appreciation, while liquidity pool gains ignore token price appreciation and factor in revenue earned from pool activity, such as swaps, in addition to impermanent loss from price volatility. So that's exactly what we're saying. The external market itself has no bearing on what's happening in the liquidity pool itself. They are separate entities. And what happens is arbitragers then come in and set buys and sells that bring the price back to where it should be.
00:05:15.134 - 00:05:47.766, Speaker A: So there's always bots at work arbitraging to bring the price back in line with where it is in the broader market. How to choose a pool, things to look for when investing in a pool, it's important metrics. You need to be aware of. Volume reserves, AK pool liquidity, volume reserves, price divergence of the tokens. So if you're familiar with market dynamics, you should be starting to get familiar with just how volatile this space is. But things like total value locked, which is also a metric that I think was set up by D five prime things to be aware of. And then pool searches.
00:05:47.766 - 00:06:17.442, Speaker A: Four important criteria to use when searching for pools. Yes, this is quite important. So how long has the pool been around for? You know the saying, the greater the risk, the greater the reward? If you are jumping into a pool that has been set up 24 hours ago, that's risky. If you're jumping into a pool that's been there for a couple of years, that's not risky. But of course, the greater the risk, the greater the rewards, but also the greater the losses. And that's it. So now we can get started.
00:06:17.442 - 00:06:55.818, Speaker A: So this is the fun bit. As we jump in here, you can see we have available capital of $100,000. Now, wouldn't it be nice to have $100,000? I think when we were doing DFI saver, we had 100 e even more, about $100,000. That is something generally when people are approaching DFI, at least on Ethereum, the thinking was that $10,000 was at the bare minimum. You needed to kind of make it make sense because the fees were so high. I would say that 100,000 is probably now the minimum for Ethereum to really kind of do some damage. In D five liquidity provision, that's not the same on Salana, for instance, or avalanche.
00:06:55.818 - 00:07:24.178, Speaker A: We're looking at the moment, or polka dot anywhere where the fees are cheaper, or polygon, for instance. I think you can start with a much smaller stack. But on Ethereum, it's getting to that point where six figures is kind of what you need. But anyway, we're simulating at the moment, so we're going to look for some pools to invest in. So now we're going to have a look at the liquidity pools, and here you have the different pairs that are available to us. So we've got a fay weth pool. And if you're wondering what weth is, a weath.
00:07:24.178 - 00:08:10.230, Speaker A: Not sure exactly how you pronounce it, but weath is wrapped ETH. Now, normally when we think about wrapped tokens, we think about something like wrapped bitcoin, where you're wrapping bitcoin as an ERC 20 token, which means it can interact with other ERC 20 tokens. The funny thing about ETH, it's not an ERC 20 token, which means it doesn't act like an ERC 20 token. So there's a wrapped version of ETH that allows it to function as if it were an ERC 20 token. It pretty much represents exactly the same thing, but it can act as if it were an ERC 20 token. It's complicated why that's important, but when you see weth, it is ETH, it's just wrapped so it can function in that way. So we now need to think about a pool that we would like to join.
00:08:10.230 - 00:08:55.382, Speaker A: So how are we going to do that? So we've got different filters that we can use up here. And wow, there's some pretty hefty, impermanent loss here going on. And that isn't really surprising given the way the market has been. The market's been fairly bearish, some fairly heavy price divergence, and you'd have to say in a sideways market, liquidity providing makes sense. In a pumpy market or a bearish market, probably less sense, and we do get sideways markets. But if we look down here, the Daiweath pool has been looking pretty good, 45.41% over the last seven days.
00:08:55.382 - 00:09:31.582, Speaker A: So we can look on the pool stats. If you see here, the liquidity provider similarly is powered by APY vision. It's worth looking into APY vision, actually, if you are providing liquidity for real, this dashboard will give you a pretty good way of measuring your impermanent loss and where you are at in your LP positions. So it's definitely worth looking into that. I don't think at the moment. They have any other chains but Ethereum in there? I could be wrong. Doesn't look like it at the moment, which is a shame because you'd want to be able to track things like polygon, for instance.
00:09:31.582 - 00:10:00.346, Speaker A: But I don't think we have it there. Okay, so it gives us some statistics here. So the fees ApY, the Il ApY, and the net Apy ApY is annual percentage yield. There we go. It says there, this is the APY you would get if we included the losses the pool incurred. So this one actually looks pretty good. If we're looking at the statistics here, the price of die doesn't fluctuate very much.
00:10:00.346 - 00:10:34.566, Speaker A: Price of wheat has. It's down 4% since yesterday, 10% since over the last seven days. But I mean, the funny thing is we feel bearish, but the last 14 days, we're up 18 and a half percent. Wow. Don't things move fast so we can look at the average fees over that period? APY 54.32%. Il see, the Il doesn't look that bad, to be honest. So if we were to want to go ahead and add liquidity, we can go up here.
00:10:34.566 - 00:11:13.758, Speaker A: I'm just going to have a look at the reserve volume, assets, growth transactions. I mean, it's not looking too bad. I mean, to be honest with you, a die weath pool is probably pretty safe, but let's go ahead and add some liquidity to that. We're going to put in 50,000 in that. So in order to do that, we will need to buy $25,000 worth of die and we will need to buy 7.13. We, because we have to put the two tokens in a ratio of 50 50. And that's why we're buying 25,000 die.
00:11:13.758 - 00:11:37.490, Speaker A: And then the transaction cost is $34. Wow. Still not cheap, is it? Total transaction cost $100. Yeah, this starts to add up after a while. So we're going to confirm that. That's the fun thing about the simulators, everything happens much, much faster. Let's find some more pools and jump in.
00:11:37.490 - 00:12:25.650, Speaker A: Let's see if we can find a really risky one and see how that compares. Let's say we want to wow USDC versus I want a really risky one. One with a giant APY. See how that looks so you can see the volume on these things. The usdc wheath pair, $206,000,000 worth of volume. You'd have to say if you're going to add liquidity to that pair, you'd be pretty safe. I would have thought, let's see if we can find some really low volume ones, like, properly low volume, like, all the way down the bottom.
00:12:25.650 - 00:12:43.864, Speaker A: Let's see what we find. Octo wheat. Let's have a look at this $85,000 worth of volume. The pool reserve is 539,000. Wow. What's interesting here is the weath Dow Phi one. There's a pool reserve of 3.46
00:12:43.864 - 00:13:00.900, Speaker A: million. The volume is only 84,000. And here weath versus coin, 9.54 in pool reserve. Interesting. I'm going to have a look at this octo weath one. What is octo? No idea.
00:13:00.900 - 00:13:33.642, Speaker A: It's 248 days old. It's on uniswap. To be honest with you, in real life, I would not touch this with a barge pole. And if we look at the fees and il Apy, you're losing 100% on this thing over the last seven days. It just looks like the most toxic thing in the world. Wouldn't touch it with a barge pole in bearish moments. If you're providing liquidity, I'd only be in bigger pools, safer pools.
00:13:33.642 - 00:14:12.950, Speaker A: It just doesn't seem like it's worth the risk. Okay, well, let's now go and look at our dashboard and see what we have so it'll tell us what our positions are, and we can then just let that sit and do its thing amazingly just by adding that I'm now number 72 on the dashboard on the leaderboard. Hilarious. I really want to add some liquidity to a really stinky one, see what happens. See how that affects my leaderboard position. Let's go ahead and do that. At the end of the day, there is no risk to this.
00:14:12.950 - 00:14:38.542, Speaker A: So let's go and find ourselves another pool to invest in. Something a bit riskier. Feeling like I want to go into something. Okay, let's have a look at the rye wheat pool. We'll look at the pool stats. So if we look at this pool since inception, it's down 120%. So if you'd been in providing liquidity since the beginning of the pool, you would be down 120%.
00:14:38.542 - 00:15:20.010, Speaker A: It just goes to show that providing liquidity is quite a dangerous activity in terms of potential losses. But that's probably not a pool for us. Yeah, this W doge wrapped doge wrapped ETH pool is looking pretty tasty, isn't it? 24.42% over course of a year. So we're looking at the Wen BTC pool here, and what you're looking for here is these big divergences in the net APY. So you can see that there was a big kind of divergence here over the 30 day average and the 40 day average. So that means that you would have been receiving a lot of impermanent loss over that period.
00:15:20.010 - 00:16:06.182, Speaker A: And yeah, the statistics don't look great, do they? 24 hours you would have done eleven point 77%, but over the rest of the time, not so good. So I think there's a lot of time that you can spend going through these and looking for the right opportunity in the market. And it takes time to kind of learn to read the statistics. But I guess what you're looking for is something that's relatively stable if you're specifically looking to provide liquidity. But of course, there are other ways to leverage your liquidity tokens to make more money. And those are the kind of opportunities you will find on sushiswap or like we looked at Polywale on polygon. That token took a really big nosedive I noticed recently.
00:16:06.182 - 00:16:50.626, Speaker A: So definitely something to bear in mind here. That liquidity provision is sketchy to say the least, but we're going to end this up by just putting some money into the WBTC we pool, and probably what we'll do is come back to this and see where we're at in the leaderboard. So I'm adding those and that's it. I am out of cash, so I have no available capital, gas fees and extra transactions. So I spent nearly $200 in gas and I'm number 67 in the leaderboard. So just by doing those two positions, I've jumped up to the top 25% of people. Well, just under top 25% of people in the dashboard.
00:16:50.626 - 00:17:34.146, Speaker A: Definitely worth trying this out though, and reading the metrics to understand a little bit more about the risks of impermanent loss. Because as you can see, when we looked at those pools, a lot of them, because of the recent market movements, the il was not so good. It'll probably come back up again as the market reinflates. But you can get caught out, you can get caught with your pants down and just have to have your eyes open when you're providing liquidity. But something like LPR Royal is a great way to gain access to that and to gain some exposure to providing liquidity and to start picking through pools and start to understand what those metrics are giving you. Don't let high gas costs keep you out of ethereum, a balancer. You can trade all you want and get most of the gas costs back in your pocket.
00:17:34.146 - 00:18:19.054, Speaker A: In their new ball for gas campaign, traders are receiving six figures worth of ball tokens every week. And with version two, Balancer is becoming the one stop shop for DFI liquidity balancer version two brings stable pools and weighted pools tightly integrated under a single protocol, flash loans, lending via asset managers, and much more. Check it out at Balancer Finance, we all know the feeling of paying high fees and waiting for transactions to confirm when interacting with DFI. I suffer from that every time I do a tutorial or a first look. Well, no more. Salana has built a fast, censorship resistant blockchain where you can build and use crypto apps that scale. Today, the network supports thousands of transactions per second, with fees less than a cent and over 500 validators.
00:18:19.054 - 00:19:12.622, Speaker A: To learn more, head over to Salana.com, defined to get started building and join its rapidly expanding community. Remember your first DeFi transaction? After juggling five plus tabs on your browser, you gazed at that ether scan confirmation feeling like you just contributed to the future of finance. Except you got quickly lost in a world of gas prices, vaults, pools, hard forks, degens and sushi chefs. Fear not, Xerion has built the dream tool for managing your portfolio. Track all of your token balances across wallets and chains access every kind of defi asset, including indexes, pools, and yield strategies, and trade at the cheapest rates with no extra fees. And that's because Xerion sources liquidity from every decentralized exchange like Uniswap, zero X and one inch, and there's no signup required, no fees, and a blissfully easy UI.
00:19:12.622 - 00:19:38.186, Speaker A: Simply connect your wallet at App Xerion IO now back to the tutorial. Sorry, this wasn't the most coherent current tutorial. There was a lot of back and forth and a lot of doorbells ringing. But we'll keep doing these ones where you don't have to spend any money to learn, because I think it's super, super valuable. Any suggestions? Tutorials, drop them in the comments below. Drop us a like, subscribe, do all that stuff. I will see you on the next one.
00:19:38.186 - 00:19:38.630, Speaker A: Bye.
