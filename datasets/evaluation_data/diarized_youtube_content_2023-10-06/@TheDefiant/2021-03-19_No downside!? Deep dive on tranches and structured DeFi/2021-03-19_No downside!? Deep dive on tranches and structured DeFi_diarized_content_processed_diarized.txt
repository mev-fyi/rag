00:00:01.050 - 00:00:42.360, Speaker A: Take one step into crypto and it can feel like you're throwing your life to the gods of thunder. I'm here, you say, take me, throw me into the void and ape that you are, you keep on walking towards that edge, you cry and over you go. But what if there was another way? What if you could have your cake and eat it?
00:00:42.970 - 00:01:31.466, Speaker B: We're talking tranches, structures and downside protection. This is a defiant it dramatic stuff. And if you're a defi trader, figuring out how much risk is enough risk is a tricky balancing act. It's also a delightfully cheesy segue into the very first sponsors message we've ever done on the channel. Yeah, we've got a sponsor and their name is Balancer and they're up to some pretty funky stuff. To help ease the pain of high gas costs on Ethereum, trade as much as you like and recoup most of the gas costs. Well, yeah.
00:01:31.466 - 00:02:22.680, Speaker B: In their new bul for gas campaign, traders are receiving six figures worth of bul tokens every week. And with version two just around the corner, Balancer is becoming a one stop shop for DFI liquidity. Version two will be bringing stable pools and weighted pools tightly integrated under a single protocol with flash loans, lending via asset managers, and much more. Check it out at balancer Finance. Now let's get back to your scheduled broadcast. So look, we all have this idea of what DeFi is, and it's probably apes and monster apys and rug pulls and yield farming and all that craziness, but really, once it matures, DeFi will just be, you know, decentralized. And for it to gain mainstream adoption, it probably won't be the crazy stuff that brings in the masses, but the boring stuff, well, boring is kind of relative, but you know what I mean.
00:02:22.680 - 00:02:36.762, Speaker B: And it all starts with something we're very familiar with, which is credit. And that's the lifeblood of any thriving financial ecosystem. It enables non zero sum wealth creation by allowing those with surplus assets to lend them to borrowers.
00:02:36.826 - 00:02:38.570, Speaker A: I want to be a billionaire.
00:02:38.650 - 00:03:10.714, Speaker B: We have a productive or investment use for those assets. Now look, the global credit market is enormous. If you look at global bond markets in, say, August 2020, we're talking $128.3 trillion. And you probably didn't know, but the interest rate derivatives market is the largest derivatives market in the world. If we go back to the first half of 2019, the total notional amount outstanding for contracts in the interest rate derivatives market was around $524,000,000,000,000. And this isn't all.
00:03:10.714 - 00:03:22.154, Speaker B: This has traditionally been a market that trades OTC between broker dealers and large institutions highly inefficient. So there's likely huge room for disruption and a big opportunity for DeFi protocols.
00:03:22.202 - 00:03:23.278, Speaker A: It's a lot of money, but the.
00:03:23.284 - 00:04:03.590, Speaker B: Bulk of innovation in our crazy little space has been about everything except credit. There's been trading, insurance, aggregation, synthetic assets, but if you want credit in DeFi, then it's only going to be over collateralized crypto backed loans with variable rates. Now we started to scratch the surface of fixed rate income strategies with our DeFi film a few weeks back, but trust me, this area is about to explode. You can really feel it now. Currently, DeFi is a playground for yield hoppers, resulting in token pumper dumps, pump and pump dumps, and surging network fees, none of which is really particularly great for longer term investing and financial planning.
00:04:03.670 - 00:04:05.786, Speaker A: When the world feels off balance, which.
00:04:05.808 - 00:05:10.330, Speaker B: Is basically what a sustainable DeFi ecosystem requires. So let's look at fixed rate lending and here we have to start with Dan Robinson's paper the yield protocol on chain lending with interest rate discovery, which proposed a theory for the creation of on chain zero coupon bonds and yield curves. And what exactly is a zero coupon bond? So it's basically a debt security that doesn't pay interest, but instead trades at a deep discount, rendering the profit at maturity when the bond is redeemed for its full face value. Now UMA launched the first yield dollar token, YUSD Sep 20, which was basically exactly that, a zero coupon bond redeemable for $1 at expiry and tradable against USDC through an automated market maker pool on balancer notional finance is another place to find a fixed rate borrowing or lending protocol through their native primitive called fcash. Now, fcash are transferable tokens that represent a claim on a positive or negative cash flow at a specific point in the future and are tradable against the underlying currency, E. G. Dai.
00:05:10.330 - 00:06:21.090, Speaker B: Within its native amm enabled liquidity pools, lenders buy fcash lock in a rate that represents the amount of the underlying currency that they can claim for their fcash upon maturity, and on the other hand, borrowers mint fcash and can sell it to receive the underlying currency in exchange for the obligation to repay a fixed amount of the underlying currency at a specific future time, and is also a product that's been recently launched by DFI protocol 88 mph when this baby hits 88 mph, you're going to see some serious shit who offer a range of fixed rate opportunities for a decent selection of crypto assets. We're looking at 6% fixed for dai here, or nearly 10% for SUSD, which is not bad at all for a fixed rate. And on the quick search I did in the UK, for instance, 3% was considered a great result for a long term fixed rate savings account. Now, normally deposits on 88 mph are represented by NFTs, which are pretty horrible for liquidity. But by using zero coupon bonds instead, those deposits can then be traded on your choice of decks without issue. Much better. And at the moment you've only got a choice of a compound uni pool and a harvest three CRV pool.
00:06:21.090 - 00:07:22.822, Speaker B: But it's a start, and we'll come back to AtA MPH's zero coupon bonds in a moment. But there is another hangover from legacy finance that's also picking up a lot of interest tranches one of my swaps on mortgage bonds. Now, the word tranche means a division or portion of a pool or whole, and is derived from the French for slice trash. In structured finance, a tranche is one of a number of related securities offered as part of the same transaction. And in the financial sense of the word, each bond is a different slice of the deal's risk. So tranches are segments created from a pool of securities, usually debt instruments such as bonds or mortgages, that are divided up by risk, time to maturity, or other characteristics in order to be marketable to different investors. Now, each portion, or tranche, of a securitized or structured product is one of several related securities offered at the same time, but with varying risks, rewards and maturities to appeal to our diverse range of investors.
00:07:22.822 - 00:08:01.382, Speaker B: Absolutely, we can make it 100 million. And yes, I know the financial crisis with its mortgage backed securities was an absolute rat's nest of tranche products. But if you take a step back, splitting cash flows into different risk profiles. Segmenting investors and offering different types of exposures is very, very powerful. At the most basic level, a tranche works like this. Users deposit their digital assets into a pool which has a fixed rate attached to it. This pool of assets is then lent out to lending protocols like AvA or compound, and the user has the option to deposit into tranche A of the pool or tranche b.
00:08:01.382 - 00:09:01.674, Speaker B: Now, depositors in tranche A are guaranteed to receive the fixed rate attached to the pool over a fixed time period. So if the pool has a fixed return of 10% APY and you deposit $100 into tranche A, you will receive $110, which is $100 principal plus $10 in interest in one year. Now, obviously, the big question here is, how can a fixed rate be guaranteed to tranche a depositors when the pool of assets is being lent out using a protocol that's only offering variable rates? That is where tranche B comes in. Now, depositors in this tranche are speculating on what they think the realized APY of the pool will be. If the realized interest rate is higher than 10% APY after one year, then all of that extra interest is distributed to them. But obviously, it can go the other way, and the realized interest rate could end up being lower than the rate listed on the pool. So less than 10%.
00:09:01.674 - 00:09:45.046, Speaker B: Now, tranche A will still be rewarded there, 10%. But the principal provided by depositors to tranche B is then reduced to compensate the depositors in tranche A. And that is the risk you take. So who's offering tranches? Well, Saffron finance now offers three user facing tranches with varying levels of risk and interest. The risky high interest earning tranche tranche A earns interest according to its principal contribution multiplied by the tranche interest multiplier. The tranche interest multiplier defaults to ten, and as a result, a tranche LPs earn ten X more interest than they would without saffron finance. Likewise, double a tranche LPs earn a 10th of the interest they normally would.
00:09:45.046 - 00:10:40.522, Speaker B: Barnbridge is another example of this, aggregating yields across different protocols and pooling them into higher yielding and lower yielding tranches with different risk profiles. Their smart yield bond, or structured market adjusted risk tranches, pools and deposits collateral into lending protocols or yield generating contracts, the yield of which is then bundled up into different tranches and tokenized. The most senior tranches have lower yields with much safer risk profiles, while the more junior tranches have higher yields with additional risk exposure. And that brings us on to structured products. Now, one of the huge benefits of decentralized money Legos is the ability to create complex, structured products, combining a number of financial instruments together as a bundle, but with smart contracts acting as the broker. And this means they're 100% transparent, which is the exact opposite of the situation in 2008. I don't talk about that.
00:10:40.522 - 00:11:06.162, Speaker B: They reduce the complexity of figuring out hardcore DFI protocols, and they're open to anyone, regardless of the size of your principal. Ribbon finance is one protocol, building a range of these allowing you to long or short volatility stack yield bearing instruments with writing options, accumulate assets through automated put option selling and reinvestment, and principal protection, guaranteeing users will get their money.
00:11:06.216 - 00:11:10.178, Speaker A: Back Whoa, that's profound. I know.
00:11:10.344 - 00:12:10.470, Speaker B: What do critics of cryptocurrency always say? Be prepared to lose all your money. But what if you can't? What are they going to say then? Be prepared to lose all the gains you could have made and don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it. Is that what they're going to say? Well, that brings us back to 88 mph miles per hour and there's zero coupon bonds, which also open up structured products with the same downside protection built in. And how does that work? So this what I'm going to say now is taken verbatim from their medium article. So credit where credits due. Here they say zero coupon bonds enable us to build principal protection structured products that are simply black magic suppose you have $1,000 and you're bullish on ETH. You decide to use $900 to buy 1003 CRV zero coupon bonds, and use $100 to buy an ETH call option, both of which mature after 30 days.
00:12:10.470 - 00:13:17.322, Speaker B: After waiting, your ZCBs have matured into 1003 CRV, which is worth more than $1,000. Since three CRV has been earning trading fees from curve this whole time, the price of ETH has risen, so you exercise your call option to get some nice clean profits. However, even if ETH has dropped in price, making the call option worthless, you would have lost nothing, since the cost of the option was covered by the fixed rate interest from the zero coupon bonds. And with zero coupon bonds, you can speculate on the price of assets in either direction without any cost to you, and earn yield on the principal at the same time. On top of all of that, if you bought ZCBs of speculative assets such as uni, for instance, you would be able to ride along the price action of uni while also expressing your opinion on another asset like ETH or BTC at no extra cost to you. That is some capital efficiency, and that is d five. And if it's just principal protection you're after, then I've been very intrigued by bumper Finance, which is offering price protection for virtually any crypto asset for a nominal premium, which starts at 3%.
00:13:17.322 - 00:14:06.822, Speaker B: Now there are two sides to bumper those taking protection who pay the premium, and those providing stablecoins into a liquidity reserve who earn a yield from the premiums paid on the other side. And here's how it could have worked in this 2021 bull market number 1, January the eigth, you protect one BTC at $40,000 expecting the market to drop. Indeed, the market retraces down to approximately $30,000. On January the 20th, you redeem your bumpered BTC for $40,000, pocketing $10,000 profits minus premium fees. You then buy one BTC at 30,000 and then reprotect. At that price. You've benefited from your bumpered BTC rising to nearly $50,000 minus the nominal premium fees, which is wild.
00:14:06.822 - 00:14:55.690, Speaker B: Now, it's early days, of course, and they are still tweaking the recipe, but I'll link the modeling analysis for bumper below so you can see how it plays out under their recent testing. And finally, one other interesting product I found came from DeXTF, a digital native fund management protocol which enables the creation of highly complex structured tokens. And the first of these will be CPST, the capital protected structured token which guarantees your principal whether the return of an underlying token, I. E is positive or negative. Pretty cool. So that concludes our look at the increasingly diverse world of Defi products. We didn't even get into interest rate markets, which offered the ability to trade future yield as a token in its own right, but you can check in on benchmark or horizon or swivel finance to get familiar with those.
00:14:55.690 - 00:15:11.290, Speaker B: But I think that is for a future video. Now, as someone that used to film base jumping for a living, there's one thing I know for sure, you don't take on those kinds of risks without making damn sure you packed a parachute staring oblivion in its cold, dead eyes. This was the defiant.
