00:00:04.650 - 00:00:47.494, Speaker A: My name is Tagan Klein, and I'm the co founder of Edge and Node. Working on the graph today, we have Tal Chuela, product manager of product engineering at Solana Labs. Solana is a layer one blockchain with high infrastructure requirements and throughput. In our conversation, we dive deep into Tal's work on crypto inside of Facebook meta, the transition to Salana, the resurgence in nfts as of late, all the hype with the bonk meme coin boots on the ground of what it's like working full time in web three and crypto, the Salana phone as well as the tea on Salana post the FTX collapse. But before we get into it, Tal gives us a brief overview of his current focus at Solana.
00:00:47.622 - 00:01:05.178, Speaker B: So my current focus is product engineering at Solana Labs, where we basically build everything that is on top of the network in order to help businesses thrive and developers thrive on Solana.
00:01:05.274 - 00:01:10.782, Speaker A: Amazing. And let's double click into that. Can you talk a little bit about what you're building on top of the network?
00:01:10.926 - 00:01:46.270, Speaker B: So the team, for example, has been very involved in building compression and what we call now provable actions for the network, allowing, for example, for nfts to be way cheaper. We're talking orders of magnitude cheaper for 100 million nfts. We're talking less than $1,000 in minting costs, which no other network is able to do. So there's a lot of exciting stuff that the team is working on and enabling these new types of use cases.
00:01:46.850 - 00:02:02.386, Speaker A: Amazing. And I know there's been a resurgence in nfts, and I want to get to that a little bit later, but excited to chat about that. Before we do, I want to talk a little bit about your journey in crypto. You're kind of an OG, but you started your time in Facebook. Tell us a little bit about your origin story.
00:02:02.568 - 00:03:18.602, Speaker B: My origin story is 2013, so I don't know if like a real OG, I'm sure there are other folks, but reading about the bitcoin paper in a distributed systems class at MIT, that was my first time getting into this decentralized world that we live in now and did not end up investing and thinking about it back then, I think it price just popped up to 300 from like $100 for bitcoin. I was like, oh my God, this is crazy. So I ended up not doing it. And then end of 2016, 2017, a really good friend started sending me these white papers of these different protocols that were coming online and basically started reading them. Really enjoyed really understanding what types of new economies this is going to create. And then in 2021 was offered an opportunity to join the DM group to work on Facebook's Libra and then DM blockchain effort. So worked on that.
00:03:18.602 - 00:03:34.370, Speaker B: And then led product for the crypto platform team that built a lot of the infrastructure for both Instagram and Facebook that is now live and enabling the displaying and minting and selling of nfts.
00:03:34.950 - 00:03:52.262, Speaker A: Amazing. And then a lot of people are kind of currently looking to leave web two, maybe less than there were last year for web three. But I'm super excited to kind of dig into why you actually made that switch. What led you to decide to kind of leave Facebook and join web three.
00:03:52.316 - 00:04:56.074, Speaker B: More natively to me, web three. And I think everybody that has been in the space, the pace of innovation has been the speed of light. You wake up the next morning and your whole world is different and changed, for better or for worse. I think we've seen the lows and highs throughout this experience and it's definitely been something, and to me that's something that has always been exciting. There's a lot of greenfield and innovation happening. I think at the end of the day, web two companies are constrained in what they can do just because of what they are and their current existing use cases and customer base. To me, as an entrepreneur, I'm really excited about these opportunities for innovation, and that's what's driving me and the creativity that goes along with it.
00:04:56.272 - 00:05:10.654, Speaker A: Totally. I think it's one of the most exciting and innovative spaces to be in now. And it's great that you've kind of joined full time, but tell us a little bit about your role at Facebook. I know you're doing a lot of interesting stuff on the blockchain side, so I'd love to hear a little bit about it.
00:05:10.772 - 00:05:12.582, Speaker B: At Facebook or at Solana?
00:05:12.666 - 00:05:15.794, Speaker A: At Facebook. And then we'll jump into Solana in a second.
00:05:15.992 - 00:06:08.466, Speaker B: So, Facebook, or meta, as we shall call it, basically, when I joined the DM team, there have been a lot of different explorations around what we should be doing. A lot of it was spent on strategy. And if we were to move away from DM, what would the world look like? So that has been somewhat exciting to explore this multi chain world. At the end of the day, the world we live in now and the world we probably will live in the future, is a multi chain world. There's not going to be one chain to dominate everything. So how do these things come together? For example, when we launched Instagram, displaying of nfts our vision has always been multi chain, and we support Instagram today supports four different chains, Solana flow, ethereum and polygon. Right.
00:06:08.466 - 00:06:55.246, Speaker B: So I think there's a lot that is happening there in trying to understand what part is meta playing in that space and how do we actually become chain agnostic, because that's the world we live in and meta shouldn't really pick a side in that type of experience. So that's been a lot of the time spent and trying to figure out, trying to figure out which networks we should be doing stuff with, where a lot of the majority of the use cases are living on, and which chains exhibit most of that behavior, as well as overlap with existing audiences, with the type of things that the creators and the users that we already have on the platform.
00:06:55.428 - 00:07:11.634, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah. And I know Microsoft as an example, is using IPFS internally because they have that private feature. And I know meta kind of chose rweave and I would love to kind of understand what the decision was, kind of choosing rweave as opposed to something like ipfs.
00:07:11.762 - 00:08:58.546, Speaker B: So ipfs, I think we can, or at least the majority of us can, I don't know if all of us, but is still somewhat centralized, you still need to run a node. And when we were trying to think through what will the users of meta do, one of the things some of the engineers said, hey, if we decide to pull out of this, and I think this was always kind of like a lingering fear for meta, is like what happens if we pull the plug on this project? What happens if we minted these nfts? What's going to happen to the rest of it? So one of the fears was if we pull the plug on the NFT project and we run this on ipfs, then people will all of a sudden need to run nodes and download their own media and figure out how to do this, and that's not the average meta user, they're not going to start running their own ipfs node and figure out how to retain this NFT. So for us it was a big thing was how do we make it as simple as possible for users to actually retain ownership over these assets? We definitely have a lot of challenges in trying to do this. It's not easy for a web two company that controls its own media to all of a sudden entrust whatever that is into decentralization and basically giving up control over it. And especially meta is held to very high standards in terms of what that media can be. So definitely there are good things and bad things, but we chose the path to give users real ownership over their assets.
00:08:58.738 - 00:09:09.686, Speaker A: Amazing. And I think that that's an impressive step that meta took. Can you tell us a little bit about how crypto and web three is thought about internally inside of Facebook or meta?
00:09:09.798 - 00:10:57.338, Speaker B: I think like a lot of web two companies, there are people that like or are firm believers in decentralizations and blockchains, and there are people who are skeptical about the future and what it brings. To me, there's always attention for web two companies, especially social medias, about what is the potential impact that web three can have on its business and on its core business, partly because of the centralization of the power of the platform versus the web three space. To me, these companies should start innovating as quickly as possible and understanding how they can fit blockchain and web three into their core business, because that is going to become critical in the next several years. That's my opinion. I think some folks at meta definitely share that opinion because we ended up building products for the web free space. But there's still a lot of skepticism, especially with nfts and the way that they are still perceived by a lot of people as sometimes a scam and it's as jpegs that cost a lot of money and potentially are also not the greenest. So definitely it's an uphill battle in some of these companies and trying to understand how to pitch this, how to really explain the value proposition of what it is we're trying to do and focus on the core use case, which for us has been creator monetization.
00:10:57.338 - 00:11:07.940, Speaker B: It's helping creators showcase their work and be able to generate a following as well as sell their art to people.
00:11:08.950 - 00:11:49.678, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think a lot of creators, they're going towards YouTube because YouTube is kind of sharing a lot of the incentives and the rewards with them in terms of advertisements away from something like an Instagram or a TikTok. So I think that that kind of power, it's important to kind of give that back to the users to stay competitive. And then I would love to kind of double click into what it was like working on blockchain technology inside of Facebook, or meta, I should say. And I imagine getting things through like the chain of commands there was not easy. So how did you navigate that? Because I think a lot of people are experiencing that inside of other companies as well.
00:11:49.764 - 00:12:35.914, Speaker B: So we already had, like when I joined, there was leadership buy in to blockchain. It's not like I had to go and convince people from scratch. And I think that's one of the things that really led us. I think David Marcus and Stefan did an amazing job in still propelling that space forward. And Adam Asari, we know the TED talk about basically the types of use cases that this is going to create. So I think having leaders who are bought into this concept of blockchain and the types of things that it can enable, definitely did a lot of the legwork in order to enable this. I think if we hadn't had it, it probably would have been a really big hurdle in trying to even get something out the door and get it funded.
00:12:36.042 - 00:13:13.206, Speaker A: Absolutely. That's great that you had support internally. And then with Duck rebranding, we've heard a lot about the metaverse from Mark Zuckerberg and even kind of rebranding the company to meta. As you mentioned, I personally argue that Facebook meta will never truly be web three or truly be the metaverse, just because the incentives aren't really aligned around that. And I kind of define web three as a brand new platform for truly decentralized applications to live. And it seems like control wants to be held, but maybe that's a projection. What are your thoughts on that? And what do you think crypto's role is inside of the metaverse?
00:13:13.318 - 00:13:44.334, Speaker B: I think you said the metaverse. I don't know if there's going to be a singular metaverse. I think there are going to be a bunch of metaverses. And I think maybe we should start changing the conversation from metaverse to metaverses and how those come together. And I think that web three can act as a bridge between those metaverses. And I think that's what is interesting. But I think one of the challenges that we have today is that web three is becoming synonymous with metaverses, and those are completely separate.
00:13:44.334 - 00:14:38.440, Speaker B: We've had metaverses for a long time. A lot of games that have come through the years have been their own metaverses. But now web three is enabling bridging. I don't know still if we're actually going to use it as a bridge. It feels like we as consumers or decentralization maximists want this thing to happen, but I don't know if it actually makes a lot of business sense for these companies to do it. So I think there's still a lot to prove whether this is a real use case that people really want and is something that is actually going to exist. I think web three is the way to do it, not the only way, but it's a way to give true ownership over the control over these metaverses, at least over assets and maybe even over more.
00:14:39.370 - 00:14:55.530, Speaker A: I appreciate your pragmatic approach and also kind of the framing towards the lens of the user. I think we need more of that in web three. Well, let's talk now about your shift to Salana labs. There are so many different blockchain ecosystems that you could have joined. Why Solana out of all of them?
00:14:55.680 - 00:15:59.694, Speaker B: So Solana is the cheapest, fastest, most reliable, most decentralized, greenest blockchain out know. We met basically as breakpoint started in Lisbon in November, and I think seeing the community come together there was really something spectacular. It's been eye opening to see how the Solana community is very approachable, very accessible, and is a force to be reckoned with. I don't see a lot of other chains that have this. EtH does, and I think a lot of other chains that are EVM based kind of enjoy that type of community that comes from ETH. But Solana has been able to build this from scratch, and I think that that's what's been really amazing. And the type of use cases and value proposition that it really provides the businesses is really interesting.
00:15:59.694 - 00:16:15.890, Speaker B: And I think that the future is really bright for Solana in terms of what it is going to be able to do for users and businesses, and people want to interact with the blockchain. So I'm really bullish, otherwise I wouldn't be here.
00:16:16.040 - 00:16:42.350, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah. And it's interesting that you say it's one of the more decentralized just given. So some people define decentralization as kind of the ability to secure the network yourself at a very low cost. And I know Solana is quite high to secure the network. I think bitcoin, I would say, is probably the gold standard when it comes to decentralization. How is Solana thinking about that and kind of reducing costs for users to be able to secure the network?
00:16:43.170 - 00:17:30.154, Speaker B: I guess it all depends on the definition, right? Like the definition that some other folks are using is the Nakamoto coefficient and the fact that you need to take down a lot of different validators. Right now, I think it's like over 30 that have to collude in order to bring the network down, which is the highest amongst all POS networks. But I think that one of the other things that is interesting, if we take it to the human readable types of things, it's the most censorship resistant, right? Is it about the security or is it about the censorship? So it all depends on how you try to define that. I think that at the end of the day, it's what's critical. Is the censorship resistance more than anything else?
00:17:30.272 - 00:17:56.962, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think censorship resistance is one of the more important things. And I think within the Eth community, a lot of people thought, oh, the government's just going to do the right thing. And we've seen that. Unfortunately, it's not always true. And I think that's one thing that we all need to kind of learn a little bit from bitcoin as well, just on how to be more censorship resistant and taking that into account. But it's great to know that you're thinking about that.
00:17:56.962 - 00:18:27.274, Speaker A: Are you looking for a stress free crypto life in 2023? Forget about the hassles and go selfcusodial with one inch. The one inch wallet is the single app you need to manage crypto. Your one inch wallet acts as a safe box due to hardware. Wallet connection becomes your ultimate coin. Storage when adding custom tokens offers full versatility thanks to multichain support. Easy to use, secure, and selfcusodial. Try one inch.
00:18:27.274 - 00:18:43.778, Speaker A: Now I want to kind of double click into how decentralized the network is. Do you have any data on how much it costs to kind of run your own block producer or how much it costs to kind of run your home cloud validator just to kind of give listeners an idea?
00:18:43.944 - 00:19:27.650, Speaker B: I do not, but there are a variety of companies. I think the latest one is Google, that is kind of joining this. So I think seeing this adoption again by web, two companies that are understanding that there is infrastructure that needs to be built and needs to be provided by these bigger players is amazing. And I think that what's been carrying us are these smaller players that have been doing it. So it's like, kudos to everybody in this ecosystem that have been able to push us to do this, but there are cloud providers that enable you to run this, and the fact that we have so many validators hopefully means that they're able to make money off running those.
00:19:27.800 - 00:19:43.810, Speaker A: Got it. And then how would you say Solana kind of compares to some other Solana killers, as they're called? It's interesting because Solana kind of started as the ETH killer meme, and now it's interesting to see that there are other Solana killers, like Aptos and Sui. How would you say Solana compares?
00:19:43.890 - 00:20:34.040, Speaker B: First of all, being elevated to a point where people want to kill you probably means a. You know, I think, first of all, it just helps us and puts Solana again on the map and showing how big of a force it is in the blockchain space. And so, but I think those two companies and dear friends worked those as those came out of meta and the group that I was in, they are facing an uphill battle. At the end of the day, in the blockchain space, content is king. It's Dapps, it's projects that are built on top of it. And Solana has been, at the end of the day, part of it is tenure. The longer you are, the more things you have, the more developers, the more of a sense of a community that you have.
00:20:34.040 - 00:21:05.006, Speaker B: And I see them trying to copy literally our playbook with now hacker houses and other things. I wish them the best of luck. But at the end of the day, Solana is here to stay, and it will stay. As we mentioned, it's going to be a multi chain world. I think there potentially after Sir Sui will remain. But I think Solana is still the force to be reckoned with. And that's why they're trying to dub themselves, right? I don't know if anybody dubbed themselves except themselves as Solana killers.
00:21:05.006 - 00:21:08.420, Speaker B: So we'll see what's going to happen.
00:21:08.950 - 00:21:27.974, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think that's fair. And to kind of some of the spicy stuff. Obviously, we saw the FTX blow up in 2022. That came like weeks after you joined the Salana ecosystem. Any regrets to your decision to join Salana just in light of that blow up?
00:21:28.172 - 00:22:23.978, Speaker B: No, not at all. I don't know a lot of the relationship that happened because I wasn't a part of Solana before. Basically, I think it happened on my first or second week when I was here. I don't know a lot of the details, but based off of what I'm hearing and seeing already, FTX was not a core part of Solana. The fact that they've invested in rival blockchains that have dubbed themselves as Solana killers just means that it wasn't what people think that it, you know, as we said, blockchain's highs and lows every day, moving at a speed of light, zero regret, super excited about the opportunity and building something awesome, amazing.
00:22:24.064 - 00:22:28.886, Speaker A: And then what was that mood kind of your first or second week on the job, kind of inside the Solano.
00:22:28.918 - 00:23:03.720, Speaker B: Ecosystem and team heads down and building. I think that's what it hasn't changed. I think that's what's really interesting about this community. It happened towards the end of breakpoint, and during breakpoint, everybody's like, this is the time to build. That is still the spirit and the momentum that has been carrying us. I think there are recent projects that have come online that are super interesting in what they're doing, but it's about building.
00:23:04.250 - 00:23:24.594, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think it will make the community stronger in the end to kind of flush some of that out. But it does seem as though a lot of the activity within the Solana ecosystem seems to have been because of SBF. How much of it would you say was organic versus because of SBF?
00:23:24.742 - 00:24:02.106, Speaker B: I have no idea. I cannot comment on that at all. All I can say is some of the things that were sponsored by FTX, kind of like serum, have already been forked into, for example, like Openbook. So I think that the community was able to coordinate on its own and able to push things in the direction of openness and transparency and more open source as this community and the entire blockchain world kind of is a firm believer in.
00:24:02.208 - 00:24:09.914, Speaker A: Absolutely. And then can we talk a little bit about the developer community? It seems like they have mostly stayed. Can you add any color on that?
00:24:10.112 - 00:24:41.830, Speaker B: I think there was a recent report that said we have a lot of different Dapps, a lot of different developers. The community is pretty strong. It's ever growing. I think at the end of the day, when you talk to people and talk about their requirements, I think that's one of the big things. Once you fully understand what their requirements are to build a blockchain experience, you understand that there is no better place than Solana. And I think that's what's exciting about this place and why people are choosing Solana time and time again.
00:24:41.980 - 00:24:55.340, Speaker A: And then can you give us an idea around the size of the ecosystem? How do you generally track that? How do you recommend others track it? Can you give us an idea of the size of the developer ecosystem, the number of projects building?
00:24:55.790 - 00:25:54.890, Speaker B: I would have to refer you to the report that I think just came out like a few weeks ago that has, as we all live in Twitter, it's on Twitter, and I would have to refer you to that. But I think some interesting statistics or KPIs that I'm interested in and I just joined, know the number of developers. It's somewhat hard to quantify, but looking at the number of reusable programs that live on chain Solana is all about reusability. So to me, that's a really interesting metric to look at. I think it's the number of people using sdks that you can see from downloads of forks on GitHub. And it's, at the end of the day, the on chain activity, it's the number of users and the number of wallets and it's the number of transactions that really happen on chain. That's how you know that we're active.
00:25:54.890 - 00:26:04.558, Speaker B: We can have many different developers, but no on chain activity. I think at the end of the day, it's about the utilization of block space. That's what blockchains are.
00:26:04.644 - 00:26:18.386, Speaker A: Got it. And then there seems to have been kind of a resurgence re in nfts, as we alluded to earlier. Can you talk a little bit about the NFT community on Solana and any collections that maybe have gained steam as of late?
00:26:18.578 - 00:27:05.806, Speaker B: There are too many for me to really say what it's about. I think that what's been interesting on Solana is kind of having a distinction between digital collectibles and digital art, and that both live on chain. I think that's one of the really interesting differences from a lot of other chains that we're able to have both. And both of them are growing. And you see the volumes are still pretty high in terms of trading for both digital art and digital collectibles. And the fact that Solana is second only to Ethereum, I think, speaks volumes, no pun intended, around what people can expect from Solana and why people come and again, build their projects on Solana.
00:27:05.918 - 00:27:25.354, Speaker A: When it comes to blockchain technology, there's something called the trilemma, and it's decentralization, security, and scalability. And usually you can't have all three. There are definitely trade offs, and I would love to kind of understand what those trade offs are for Solana and how developers should kind of think about those trade offs when choosing to build in the space.
00:27:25.552 - 00:28:36.478, Speaker B: So I think you definitely see that in other blockchains in how they've made their architectural decisions. I think that a lot of the EVM networks are derivatives of Ethereum, and use Ethereum as the security backbone, which definitely leads to a lot of challenges, because at the end of the day, you're only as fast as your slowest chain. And for all of those, it's ETH. So even though they're all saying, hey, we're super scalable and are able to solve and provide that sense of security, it's all is reliant on ETH. I think Solana again built everything from the ground up with a completely different tech stack and different architectural decisions. So you see the scalability, you see the TPS, even though that's what we can use for fast and scale, is higher than all of the other chains combined. So definitely on the scalability front, it's beating a lot of others on the decentralization, highest Nakamoto coefficient.
00:28:36.478 - 00:29:38.046, Speaker B: So again, if that's how we choose to look at decentralization, I think there has been a lot of advancements, and it's one of the most decentralized, if not the most decentralized chain on the security front. Again, that's a very ambiguous term. And the EVM world loves to go back to ETH and saying security has derived from it, but most times they just rely on the decentralization as the security proxy to understand what it is. Right. It's very hard to take down ETH, and therefore your state is secure by eTh. I think with Solana, if we use the same proxy, we're then the most secure because we're the most censorship resistant and the highest Akamoto coefficient. So to me, even though it's a trilemma, we're potentially stretching the bounds more than any other blockchain.
00:29:38.158 - 00:29:52.598, Speaker A: Super interesting. And then I think with Ethereum, some of the layer twos have kind of helped to solve that scaling problem with getting the security from the main chain, but then being able to scale beyond it. Any thoughts on that? Within the ethereum ecosystem?
00:29:52.774 - 00:30:50.758, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, they're able to scale it, but at the end of the day, scalability. If we just look at a TPS, the question is about finality and the transaction that we're all talking about. Like, you can generate a million TPS on a side chain or an l two, but at the end of the day, it's like, when is this finalized? If it takes you to, you can process a lot of transactions, but only become finalized in an hour, does that really mean that you have a million TPS? So I think that the time, it's all about how we massage the different stats and the messaging to fit what we're trying to say. But at the end of the day, if you look the TPS and the finality time Salana, each block is generated every 400 milliseconds. The TPS is higher than all of the other chains combined. I think it says something about the scalability of Salana.
00:30:50.854 - 00:30:57.920, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And then can you talk a little bit about this bonk thing that everyone has been talking about within the community?
00:30:58.290 - 00:31:45.614, Speaker B: So I think it's what people dubbed as a culture coin. Some people might call it a meme coin. I don't know if a culture coin is a thing, a culture token, but it's probably, in other circles it's probably known as a meme coin. But one of the interesting things is that it actually, unlike maybe previous ones, it was quickly integrated as an actual payment option. So I think it really garnered a lot of momentum by the integration into all of these different dapps as a method to actually be used and utilized. So that is one of the really cool things about it.
00:31:45.732 - 00:31:53.930, Speaker A: Very exciting. Yeah, I think there's a lot of fOMo surrounding it, which we haven't seen so much of as of late. So super exciting.
00:31:54.090 - 00:32:23.078, Speaker C: The globe dollar is a new stablecoin with a very special property. As its market cap goes up, extreme poverty goes down. Glow donates 100% of its profits to people in countries like Kenya and Liberia as basic income. If glow grows as big as Dogecoin, it will lift 1 million people out of poverty. With Glow, you can reduce poverty just by holding a stablecoin. It's launching early 2023. Join the waitlist@glowdollar.org
00:32:23.078 - 00:32:28.970, Speaker C: defiant that's gl odollar.org defiant.
00:32:29.790 - 00:32:42.382, Speaker A: And then tell us a little bit about what is it like kind of working on the ground inside of Salana. Can you talk a little bit about your experience, maybe to the lens of someone listening who is interested in doing something similar?
00:32:42.516 - 00:34:01.962, Speaker B: Yeah, I think to me, one of the really interesting changes coming from a web two company, or any traditional company, to be honest, is a lot of times when you're trying to build something, you use your own engineering power, but working at an l one, and I assume this is probably true also for l two s and others, there is a sense of community around it and people. We are basically a technology provider and looking for people to build stuff on top of us and create that culture and the developer experience and all of those things. So there's definitely a lot of, I don't know if tension. Bates good tension of understanding what are the bounds of what we should be building up, to what extent, and how do we enable others to build on top of us. So it's a very back and forth. It's like this dance of where we should be operating in and how we can help this community and advance it. And I think one of those examples is, for example, the saga phone, raising our hand and building the first web three mobile device and how we can now help the Salana ecosystem move forward.
00:34:01.962 - 00:34:15.358, Speaker B: So I think there's a lot of innovation and creativity that goes into this, and you need to understand where you should be operating in order to help that community advance as quickly as possible.
00:34:15.524 - 00:34:38.760, Speaker A: Amazing. I love that. And let's double click into the Solana phone. Can you tell us a little bit about it? I think that what's exciting for me is that it feels like there was a lot of stale copying within the ecosystem, and this feels like a way to really expand what the crypto space is doing in a new direction. So, yeah, tell us a little bit about the Solana phone. What inspired it? What are you excited about?
00:34:39.290 - 00:36:00.910, Speaker B: I wasn't here when it got started. I can only speak to what has been going on since I joined, but I think we just shipped the first dev kits in December, so I think people are getting their hands on it, and we're seeing the excitement. It opens up new types of experiences, especially in the mobile world, of a centralized management of your keys and basically allowing you to interact with different types of wallets and create new types of experiences that can only be enabled by hardware and not just software. And I think the other part of it is like this DAP store, right? Coming into an ecosystem and creating, in a way, a centralized place where you can get decentralized apps and kind of fixing part of the distribution problem that exists within the DaP world. So hopefully, we'll see a lot of exciting stuff happening in that space. I think it also enabled Salana to move into and enable a lot of the Salana mobile stack, or SMS, as we call it, and kind of create that software layer that will enable web three and mobile devices to interact.
00:36:01.810 - 00:36:22.040, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. And do you think there are plans to kind of decentralize that App Store? Maybe add, like, a moderation protocol so that any app can go there, or decentralized application DAP could go there, but then there's moderators. There's no decentralized moderation protocol so that you can opt into different moderation. Do you foresee that kind of being a potential future?
00:36:23.450 - 00:36:37.834, Speaker B: I do not know. I'm not involved in that part of Solana Mobile and the DAP store, so I cannot speak to their vision. But I think it's a very interesting idea.
00:36:37.952 - 00:36:57.730, Speaker A: Amazing. I think that that's really what will compete with Apple, is something decentralized because Apple holds so much control there. Right. And we're seeing a lot of interesting behavior on the privacy side. But tell us a little bit about the roadmap for Salana. What's coming up in 2023, and what are you excited about?
00:36:57.800 - 00:37:34.394, Speaker B: Still feels like 2020. What am I excited about? I think there's a lot of interesting things that are coming. I think, honestly, we're trying to figure it out. The year just started. We're in the midst of planning for 2023. I think we're waiting for this compression stuff to come live, and we hope that's going to happen in Q one because it's going to enable a bunch of new experiences for games, for social media, for a variety of different applications and use cases. We're waiting.
00:37:34.394 - 00:38:43.890, Speaker B: There's a lot of stuff happening in the Defi space in terms of the types of experiences that we want to see the community create and how we can kind of get involved in that. Gaming, as I mentioned, I think is like a super exciting, the Solana mobile device that is coming, we're seeing a lot of interaction between game studios that want to create these mobile experiences and mobile. So definitely something to watch out for. Yeah, and I think it's just like propelling this ecosystem forward in terms of these experiences and different protocols that we can create. I think the big one has been Solana pay and how I think it creates a lot of different types of things that we're used to seeing in the web two space. So basically, it allows the recipient of a transaction to, in a way, initiate a transaction, which is really interesting. So, for example, what are consented airdrops would look like? I think this is one of the unique features that only Solana can provide.
00:38:43.890 - 00:38:57.346, Speaker B: So a lot of stuff that I think is coming and could be really interesting for a lot of different folks. So excited to see what that is and share more as we kind of finalize our plans.
00:38:57.538 - 00:39:03.242, Speaker A: Totally super exciting. And then what about more broadly, what are you excited about in crypto in 2023?
00:39:03.296 - 00:39:44.760, Speaker B: Mostly, I think games have been super interesting. We've been talking, I think 2021 has been the year of nfts, and then everybody kind of saw games as the next thing. I think now is the era of games. We're seeing some of them now starting to bridge over from like web two games to web 2.5 games, and hopefully very soon into full web three games. I think identity is probably going to be one that is going to be tackled. It's already being tackled by a variety of different teams, but I think this is the time where zks are starting to shine and the types of experiences that we can provide with that.
00:39:44.760 - 00:40:02.960, Speaker B: So I think there's a lot of really cool things of what we can start doing, and I think those are definitely two things that I'm keeping my eye on and I'm excited about, but there was a ton of other things that we're just thinking about, and hopefully we can share more about those soon.
00:40:03.330 - 00:40:08.186, Speaker A: Amazing. And then what is the community doing to survive and thrive during the bear.
00:40:08.218 - 00:40:21.090, Speaker B: Market building, keeping your head down, shipping, really amazing things, product use cases that people are excited about. That's all we can do.
00:40:21.240 - 00:40:26.818, Speaker A: Amazing. And then any advice you have for someone who maybe wants to follow a similar journey as you.
00:40:26.904 - 00:40:53.326, Speaker B: First of all, free to reach out. Always happy to chat with folks, but I think at the end of the day, it's about finding a place where you're excited about the people, as I have been about Solana. You're excited about the tech and the opportunities that it provides and just find something you're really going to enjoy. And so to me, those are the recipes for success.
00:40:53.508 - 00:40:59.342, Speaker A: Amazing. And where can people get in touch with you? Any social media handles you can share?
00:40:59.396 - 00:41:08.846, Speaker B: Yeah, Twitter. It's going to be my name. So tall Chihuahua is how you can reach out.
00:41:08.948 - 00:41:14.110, Speaker A: Awesome. And then the last question is just how are you defiant as an entrepreneur?
00:41:14.610 - 00:41:40.442, Speaker B: I. I mean, I was thinking about this. I don't know if you say a former entrepreneur, I think you were still an entrepreneur at art. Maybe you're a former founder, but as an entrepreneur, you're always trying to push the limits and try to find how to build new, exciting things and challenge the status quo. Right? That's what innovation is. Innovation is about challenging the status quo. So to me, maybe an entrepreneur leader.
00:41:40.442 - 00:41:46.880, Speaker B: You keep defying those things all the time in order to create a better, brighter future.
00:41:47.810 - 00:41:58.686, Speaker A: Absolutely. I love that. Amazing. Well, it was super exciting to learn about your experience kind of inside of Facebook and moving more natively into web three. Thanks so much for coming on.
00:41:58.868 - 00:42:00.240, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
