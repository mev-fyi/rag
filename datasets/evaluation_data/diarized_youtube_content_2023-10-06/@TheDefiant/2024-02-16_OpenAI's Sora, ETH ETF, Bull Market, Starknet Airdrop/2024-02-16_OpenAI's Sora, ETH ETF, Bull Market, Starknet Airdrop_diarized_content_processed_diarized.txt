00:00:00.170 - 00:00:27.880, Speaker A: I think it's great to see that large platforms like OpenAI, Sony, the BBC and Adobe are starting to implement these standards. But you know, they need to be made a lot more secure and trustless by pairing these open standards with an actually open registry like a blockchain, to verify the provenance of this content. So I, I'm sure things are headed that way.
00:00:30.650 - 00:00:34.514, Speaker B: Matcha Dex aggregator finds you the best prices in DFI.
00:00:34.642 - 00:01:12.660, Speaker A: More on them later in the show. Hello everyone, this is crypto with Cammy, where we go through all the main headlines in crypto and DFI in the past week in 30 minutes or less. This is the show for the week starting February twelveth. And before we get to it, please like and subscribe to the defiant one of the biggest news this week that we'll cover didn't come from crypto, but does have crypto implications. OpenAI unveiled its video generation model called Sora. It's pretty wild. We'll go over that in a bit and I'll give you my take.
00:01:12.660 - 00:01:48.800, Speaker A: Meanwhile, markets continue heating up with bitcoin topping fifty K and ether crossing 2800. There's more airdrops action with Starknet announcing its token launch. But not everyone was happy. We have more big name crypto announcements with Citibank and Telephonica, and a couple of headlines in the staking space, of course. Okay, on with OpenAI news. So OpenAI yesterday, Thursday, February 15, unveiled Sora. Here it is on the screen.
00:01:48.800 - 00:02:25.254, Speaker A: Sora, it's kind of like chatty BT. It's a generative AI model that can create video from text, so you give it a description or even a still image. And Sora can create a 62nd movie like scene with multiple characters, different types of motion and backgrounds. It's pretty amazing. I really recommend going through the website and seeing all the examples of video that they give. I'm sure if you're on Twitter you've.
00:02:25.302 - 00:02:25.900, Speaker B: Seen.
00:02:27.870 - 00:02:46.740, Speaker A: The past couple of days people tweeting these videos out, a couple of pirate ships in what looks like to be a cup of coffee, this incredibly realistic looking tropical bird, this underwater life.
00:02:50.390 - 00:03:09.770, Speaker B: That looks like it was created with kind of paper, I guess, and so on. It's just super realistic. And if this can be created with just a prompt like chat DPT, it's pretty mind blowing.
00:03:10.350 - 00:04:12.560, Speaker A: So what does this have to do with crypto? Every day, as we know, billions of images and videos are shared across the web. But as we're seeing these AI tools means that the line between reality and fiction has blurred even further I mean, these images, if you can just create them with a prompt, are pretty mind blowing. They look extremely realistic. So they raise a critical question about authenticity, copyright, and trust in digital content. Deep fakes can become a real threat to personal security and even national security. So how do we know for sure that, for example, the image of a president making an announcement is real or generated by AI? In an example that's close to crypto. How do we avoid others using celebrities likeness to scam people out of their money, for example? So that's where blockchain comes in.
00:04:12.560 - 00:05:26.838, Speaker A: At its core, blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers, ensuring that once a piece of data is recorded, and this is crucial, it cannot be altered retroactively. So when an image or video is created, it can be registered on a blockchain along with its metadata, including details like the creators time of creation and location. So this registration can create a unique digital fingerprint. The blockchain can take all of this information and use encryption to create a hash, and this becomes unique to the image. This hash is then immutable and can serve as a certificate of authenticity so that anyone anywhere can verify the provenance of a blockchain registered image or video by comparing its hash against the blockchain record. This would be an ideal scenario. There already exists an off chain version of this, and it's an open standard that's made to secure the provenance of digital content.
00:05:26.838 - 00:05:42.470, Speaker A: It's called the Coalition for content Provenance and Authenticity, or c two PA, and it was formed through an alliance between Adobe Arm, Intel, Microsoft, and Truepic.
00:05:42.990 - 00:05:54.620, Speaker B: It's pretty interesting. This C two PA standard allows publishers, companies, and others to embed metadata in media for verifying its origin and related information.
00:05:55.150 - 00:06:40.620, Speaker A: So c two pa isn't just for AI generated images. The same standard is also being adopted by camera manufacturers like Sony news organizations like the BBC, and others to certify the source and history and provenance of media content. So what's super interesting, and I had no idea, is that chat DPT started including this C two PA metadata just since this week on February twelveth. So this just happened. And you can use this site called content credentials. It's contentcredentials.org to verify if an image was generated by Chattybt and Dali three.
00:06:40.620 - 00:06:44.046, Speaker A: It's really interesting. I had no idea you could do.
00:06:44.068 - 00:07:19.500, Speaker B: This, but I just tried it out. I generated a cat, of course, the Internet's favorite animal, through Dali three and went to contentcredentials.org to see whether this site could verify that it was in fact created by Dali. Three. So I just saved this image to my desktop and I dragged it here and there it is. It says, issued by OpenAI on February 15, 2024.
00:07:20.430 - 00:07:22.314, Speaker A: So this is really cool.
00:07:22.352 - 00:07:29.174, Speaker B: So you can use this to verify whether the image you're looking at was created using AI.
00:07:29.302 - 00:07:31.774, Speaker A: I think this is really cool, but.
00:07:31.812 - 00:07:49.220, Speaker B: I also think that this C two PA model could work a lot better if that metadata that is saving and the digital signature it uses to verify the content were stored on chain. So C two PA.
00:07:51.430 - 00:08:50.520, Speaker A: Could use its metadata and store that on a blockchain. And that would ensure that the provenance cannot be tampered with or altered down the line. In the end, C two PA is great, but it is a centralized organization, it's a handful of companies control it. I would assume all of this information is stored in servers which can be hacked, they can go down, they can be stolen, it can be leaked and tampered with. So not very secure. So I think this type of coalition would work a lot better if it was storing its information again on chain. It would also mean that anyone can verify the authenticity and history of digital content by checking its C two PA metadata against the blockchain record.
00:08:50.520 - 00:09:48.874, Speaker A: And then the fact that if this process didn't rely on a single centralized authority, it just would improve trust among users of the platform and people wanting to verify this kind of content. We could even go one step further and automate royalty payments to artists using smart contracts. But that would probably be still a ways away as we know how hard that's been even with NFTs. But it would still be a really cool implementation of an on chain content verification system down the line. So interestingly, I tried making a simple edit to this cat image I made with chat DPT and look what happened. So I just went to online paint and drew hearts over the cat and.
00:09:48.912 - 00:09:50.780, Speaker B: Then went back to this page.
00:09:52.670 - 00:09:53.178, Speaker A: And.
00:09:53.264 - 00:09:58.970, Speaker B: Dropped it here and it says no content credential.
00:10:00.210 - 00:11:37.018, Speaker A: So what happened is that just by making a couple of very simple surface level edits to the photo, this website, which can check for metadata credentials, couldn't detect that the original image was an AI generated image and that it was later edited. So there's definitely limitations to how far these credentials go. I think the way that things will evolve is that everyone will just assume that images and video without an authenticity certificate can be fake. So I think these proofs could even extend into the legal realm where only verified images can be used as evidence while others can't. We need a widespread providence standard for content, ideally secured on chain so that the public can regain trust in media and other content creators and so that creators can protect their IP. I think it's great to see that large platforms like OpenAI, Sony, the BBC and Adobe are starting to implement these standards, but they need to be made a lot more secure and trustless by pairing these open standards with an actually open registry like a blockchain, to verify the provenance of this content. So I'm sure things are headed that way.

00:12:06.650 - 00:12:24.746, Speaker A: Now on to more directly crypto content, specifically crypto markets, which continue heating up. ETH has surged 16% in the past seven days. It's now trading above 2800 for the.
00:12:24.768 - 00:12:27.162, Speaker B: First time since May 2022.
00:12:27.296 - 00:12:50.494, Speaker A: That's just before the 40 billion implosion of terra. So interestingly, we've kind of recovered, at least price wise, from that crash. Other interesting data points. On February 7, the amount of ether staked crossed 30 million ETH for the first time, and that's pushing the staking.
00:12:50.542 - 00:12:54.050, Speaker B: Rate above 25%, an all time high.
00:12:54.200 - 00:12:57.794, Speaker A: Also, total value logged in DFI stands.
00:12:57.842 - 00:13:10.586, Speaker B: At 49 billion, a nine month high. So we're just under the 50 billion mark. And helping the ETH rally, of course, continues to be this speculation that there.
00:13:10.608 - 00:13:13.900, Speaker A: Will be a spot ETH ETF approved in May.
00:13:14.270 - 00:13:59.690, Speaker B: And this week, Franklin Templeton filed for its own Ethereum ETF. Meanwhile, bitcoin is flirting. Well, that's what the headline says, but actually it already topped 50,000 for the first time since December 2021. And what's fueling this continues to be bitcoin ETF inflows. They are getting more and more substantial. Then, interestingly, part of the price rally is being driven by major financial institutions. We're seeing that financial firms are loading up on crypto.
00:13:59.690 - 00:14:39.106, Speaker B: They are currently holding 59 billion in assets under management. According to Coinshares, the 60 billion mark has not been seen since the last week of February 2022. So we're seeing more and more interest in crypto, in DFI. The biggest news of the week was the Starknet Airdrop. The Starknet foundation announced it will airdrop over 700 million STRK tokens to 1.3 million addresses on February 20. Of course, Starknet is an Ethereum layer.
00:14:39.106 - 00:14:55.306, Speaker B: Two, they leverage zero knowledge technology and they currently have 180,000,000 in TDL. And Starknet is developed by the Starkware company so that more than half of.
00:14:55.328 - 00:15:27.926, Speaker A: The allocated tokens will go to past users of Starknet. Other eligible recipients include users of DyDX, immutable X, Rhinofi, and so rare, all of which use Starkx, an early iteration of Starkware scaling technology. Notably ETH stakers are due to receive nearly a quarter of the tokens of the airdrop in what may be the first major airdrop for users of Ethereum stakers. We might see this trend going forward.
00:15:28.028 - 00:15:54.474, Speaker B: Probably so both solo stakers and holders of LSTs are eligible to claim STrK tokens. But not everyone was happy with the news. There was a bit of a backlash because previously some criteria had been leaked.
00:15:54.602 - 00:15:55.280, Speaker A: On.
00:16:00.050 - 00:17:06.082, Speaker B: Who would be eligible to claim SDRK. But that turned out not to be the case. And people were checking websites where they could see whether they could claim STRK, and when they saw that they only got a few tokens or none, they went to Twitter to make their anger felt. So another focal point of the backlash was that 1.3 billion SDRK tokens allocated to the starkware team and investors will unlock on April 15, less than two months after the token begins trading. Now at the defined, we interviewed Eli Ben Sassan, the co founder and CEO of Starkware, and he said that the team has no intentions of cashing out of the token once the unlock hits. But he also said that they've been building since even before 2018.
00:17:06.082 - 00:17:36.960, Speaker B: Investors, the first investors that trusted in them, invested in the company in January of 2018. So six years after that, I guess they feel like they have a right to get a bit of liquidity. So that's the starware news. And all right, on to big name announcements that we all love in crypto we have here.
00:17:38.210 - 00:17:40.174, Speaker A: Chain Link Labs has teamed up with.
00:17:40.212 - 00:18:47.720, Speaker B: Telephonica, the spanish telecom giant. The partnership was announced on February 14. Nice Valentine's Day partnership, and the partnership allows Polygon based smart contracts to query information from Telephonica and its subsidiaries. The chief business officer at Chainlink Labs said bringing Telephonica's open gateway APIs on chain with Chainlink functions unlocks novel use cases and greater security for our industry. Now, Avalanche announced that Citibank completed a pilot on one of its stopnets testnets to explore permission tokenization trials. The trials were executed in partnership with investment and wealth management clients, including wisdom Tree, Wellington Management and ABN bank. The bank tested use cases on Avalanche spruce, an evergreen testnet designed for buy and sell side institutions, Avalanche said in a blog post.
00:18:47.720 - 00:19:19.550, Speaker B: Now PayPal stablecoin PiUSD is becoming more and more integrated in DFI, and it's now the 10th largest stablecoin by market cap. So Morpho Blue, a DFI lending protocol, announced a new vault supporting piusd. Liquidity providers can earn interest on PiUSD lent out to borrowers. The vault exclusively supports Lido's liquid staking token and backs tokenized US treasury bill as collateral assets.
00:19:20.210 - 00:19:23.790, Speaker A: All right, I'll run through the next headlines.
00:19:23.870 - 00:19:37.058, Speaker B: Stardust is a blockchain gaming infrastructure provider and they have integrated with layer one network, Sui Sui, to streamline their process for developers launching web3 games on the network.
00:19:37.234 - 00:19:40.200, Speaker A: That was Sui now on to say.
00:19:40.570 - 00:20:47.530, Speaker B: Sei, another layer one blockchain, and they have launched a second iteration of its devnet. The upgrade enables developers to deploy code compatible with the EVM, Ethereum's virtual machine and next piece of news super interesting. Ethiopia is seeking to position itself as the next hub for large scale bitcoin mining firms. In a February 7 report from Bloomberg, Ethiopian Electric Power, the country's national power monopoly, has inked deals with 21 bitcoin mining companies. Super interesting. All right, prominent layered tools on Ethereum are ready to embrace a new standard for rollups. The new standard is designed to improve the compatibility of smart contracts with existing hardware and software vendors, including Apple and Android.
00:20:47.530 - 00:21:42.910, Speaker B: For example, the standard could facilitate transaction signing via biometric authentication on mobile devices. In another coalition, liquid restaking protocols, ether five, Renso and Swell announced they partnered to launch a triliquid restaking token pool on balancer. Liquidity providers can earn points for all three LRT providers, in addition to points for eigen layer. And finally, tax season is here for the US, and we've got your back with a guide on how to navigate taxes if you're a crypto holder. And that's it. Those are the biggest headlines for this week. Let me know what you think about AI and deepfakes and if blockchain can help with providing content provenance.
