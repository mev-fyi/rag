00:00:02.810 - 00:00:33.640, Speaker A: Okay, we're live. Hey, welcome, everyone. Super excited for this panel. We have amazing panelists here representing some of the biggest, most active, and most liquid Dexs in decentralized finance. We have Michael Egroff, the founder of Curve Omakase, the lead contributor of Sushiswap and Alphare, co founder of Radium. Welcome, everyone.
00:00:37.530 - 00:00:39.560, Speaker B: Hi. Thanks for having us.
00:00:41.950 - 00:02:00.590, Speaker A: Yeah. So we'll be talking about Texas and amms today, and it's such an important part of DeFi. Without Texas, you can't have Defi. They are the backbone, the way that liquidity is made and provided, it's, I guess, like the oil or fuel to decentralized finance. So you guys have really a fundamental role in this space and being kind of the founders or lead contributors at some of the most important Dexes. I'm really interested to hear your thoughts on where decentralized exchanges are headed. But first, just to get everyone on the same page on each of your specific Dexes, I would love for you guys know, let's go around, and each of you can explain what your dex does, like the main characteristics, how it's different from other dexs.
00:02:00.590 - 00:02:03.246, Speaker A: Michael, why don't you start with curve?
00:02:03.438 - 00:02:43.470, Speaker C: Yeah. So curve started as a decentralized exchange for stablecoins initially. And by stablecoins, I mean coins pegged to the same asset, like Us dollar or bitcoin or Ethereum. And more recently, we expanded to swapping between coins which are volatile to each other. I guess the main characteristic here is that we go a little bit beyond the original constant product formula and experiment with bonding curves a little bit to get high efficiency.
00:02:45.570 - 00:02:46.320, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:02:50.390 - 00:04:06.970, Speaker B: Sushi started. I guess its novel innovation from the start was liquidity mining incentives to offset the natural impermanent loss that comes from constant product pools. I guess how we've evolved since then is to become more horizontal in nature, having constant product, also experimenting with limit orders, and also having bento box, which is our, as you would call, decentralized application vault. And upcoming is trident, which is our new implementation of, I guess, an AMM platform, if you will, that's built on top of Bentobox. So the differences between that are that you can have many different types of pools, and they can be aggregated within bentobox, and all the underlying assets can earn additional capital efficiency through strategies. So you'll have additional yield from bentobox strategies, you'll have the yield from liquidity provisioning, and you'll also have the yield from any liquidity mining incentives that we provide. So three types of yield to make a happy farmer.
00:04:07.630 - 00:04:11.550, Speaker A: Nice alpha ray. Last but not least on radium.
00:04:12.610 - 00:04:13.070, Speaker C: Hi.
00:04:13.140 - 00:05:16.050, Speaker D: So radium is a hybrid amm built on top of Solana. So what I mean by hybrid Amm is that basically when users deposit tokens into the AmM pools, we take those and we also use those tokens to market make on top of a central limit order book called serum. So basically the limit orders are also placed according to the K equals xy equation. It's just that so users will be able to have two places to swap in. Liquidity is provides the whole ecosystem. When users swap on radium, they also find that there's a best price aggregator which would look between serum and radium to see which one gives them the better price. On top of that, we also have a launch pad and NFT drop pad where we help projects get started on launching their token, figuring out their tokenomics, and really help them out with marketing at the beginning.
00:05:17.350 - 00:05:50.342, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay, so let's see if I got all of the distinctions. So with curve, the main characteristic was curve really spearheaded this idea of, like, assets to reduce impermanent loss. And so the focus early on was with stable coins. And now recently, you've broadened that scope. Sushi choice. Go ahead.
00:05:50.496 - 00:06:18.054, Speaker C: Yeah, just recently we a little bit went beyond asset swaps, and of course it's still early, but we try to go a little bit beyond what was announced. I would say we experiment with bonding curves to get higher liquidity with the same deposits than was possible before.
00:06:18.252 - 00:07:03.858, Speaker A: Nice. And so sushiswap, the main innovation there was, it has all types of assets, not like assets. And the way that it tries to compensate traders for impermanent loss between those volatile assets is with token incentives. Right? With yield farming and providing token rewards for liquidity providers. And on top of that, there's all these other yield strategies that liquidity providers can use, is that right?
00:07:04.024 - 00:07:29.274, Speaker B: Yeah, that's generally correct. I think it's all about when sushi first started. We're not the first, Dex. So it's all about incentives, right? How do you attract liquidity providers and how do you design incentives that make their liquidity sticky? Especially when there's definitely tons of other more efficient, decentralized exchanges and other protocols out there as well that are arising every day.
00:07:29.392 - 00:08:40.366, Speaker A: Yeah, and of course, if we're talking about how sushi started, I'd be remiss. Not to mention the dramatic early days as this fork of Unisoft and the whole vampire attack, which was one of the most exciting things to happen in Defi in my opinion, at least from journalistic point of view, covering this space, that was like a whole soap opera. And. Yeah, it was all about incentives. Right? Incentivizing users to go from uniswap to sushiswap, and then launching the sushi token, which happened at a time that uniswap didn't have a. Yeah. And we see how well incentives work in decentralized finance in general, with radium, I'd say, is the idea to have an amm that also has the flexibility of an order book with limit orders and more maybe sophisticated tools.
00:08:40.366 - 00:09:04.780, Speaker A: And it also includes a Dex aggregator, which checks where the prices are better between radium and serum, the other kind of big Solana based decks. And it also has some tooling for NFT trading, is that right?
00:09:06.350 - 00:09:13.710, Speaker D: Yeah. We have a project called the drop zone, which is an area where we help NFTs with their initial drops.
00:09:15.410 - 00:09:56.902, Speaker A: Nice. Okay. So, pretty different approaches to providing one of the main activities in finance, which is trading. I think the main thing that Dexs are still trying to solve is impermanent loss. Right. And so you're each going about it in a different way. Michael, I think curve was really innovative at first with the like assets, and it was able to get such good pricing for stablecoins, even beating centralized exchanges on some cases.
00:09:56.902 - 00:10:12.910, Speaker A: And so that's how curve was able to just rise really quickly in TVL and in trading volume. So now, how are you managing impermanent loss by adding more volatile assets?
00:10:13.750 - 00:11:19.510, Speaker C: Right. Well, I would say we haven't been yet focused on solving impermanent loss in particular. So I would say, at the moment, the volatile asset pools, they still have the same sort of impermanent loss as sushi or balancer would have. And there are some ideas how to do that, but they are not yet rolled out. I would say, right now, the impermanent loss in particular, it probably solved similar to how it's done in sushi today. We've been focused more on efficient algorithms for having higher liquidity while having the same deposits. But impairment loss is a different problem, which can have very interesting solutions, but they are not yet discovered, I would say not yet publicly discovered.
00:11:20.330 - 00:12:19.820, Speaker A: So I'd love to hear all of you guys opinion on this. I've seen this argument made by SBF, who is, of course, closely tied to Solana. And what he said before is that it will be very hard for Amms to compete with centralized exchanges and with order book exchanges because of impermanent loss. His argument is that maybe amms are good for kind of the long tail of tokens. But for large trades, for institutions, for just like professional traders, Amms won't ever be able to compete with that level of just tight spreads and just sophistication of tooling. What are your thoughts on that? Whoever wants to go first?
00:12:22.830 - 00:13:51.958, Speaker B: I think generally the space is still early days in DFI, right? The infrastructure, I would say it's still nascent. We're only starting to see l two scaling solutions like arbitram and optimism, and even zk scaling solutions come out, I think on the level of so order books don't deal great with volatility, especially if assets are incredibly volatile and there might not be enough, I guess the spread might be too wide, right? So I think there may exist particularly a future where both are combined, where you could have decentralized systems that have AMM functionalities, and also they have order book limit order style functionalities. And it's a matter of UI, right, serving the best price to the user. If they can fill an existing limit order, then they would essentially have like a zero fee, no price impact trade. So I think the space is definitely moving towards optimization. We can also see in concentrated liquidity pools on univ three, they have the opportunity for people to launch ten basis point fee pools, which is already competitive against Coinbase. FDX has dropped their, I guess, fee down to seven basis points.
00:13:51.958 - 00:14:38.754, Speaker B: So I guess in Sushi's regard, right, when we come out with Trident, there's a couple methodologies. So we allow for completely configurable pools. If people want to set the 7.5 or 75 basis point pool, they can. And then immediately that liquidity would be very competitive against centralized exchanges. Then comes into the considerations of gas fees and Ux and Ui, and I think those will be gradually solved through arbitram and scaling solutions. And then at the end of the sushi, to address the question, I guess, of impermanent loss, as Michael said, there's no public solution for impermanent loss.
00:14:38.754 - 00:15:42.422, Speaker B: This is kind of native to AmM designs, but there are ways to kind of offset it or band aid it to a certain degree, right? This is why we put our Amm into bentobox, so the underlying balances can earn yield. The more yield you earn, the more technically you're offsetting your impermanent loss. And also, as I said before, there is the opportunity for more blended style amms that have limit orders, that have kind of very highly decentralized order books. And also there's also the room for constant product pools, et cetera. To all work together to essentially find and route the best price to the user. And I think those two things will be interesting developments. And there's already a lot of use cases where I would say lots of decentralized infrastructure is becoming super competitive against centralized exchanges.
00:15:42.422 - 00:16:34.742, Speaker B: To give a brief example, we've experimented with limit orders on bentobox on polygon. And these limit orders are interesting because since Bentobox uses the concept of virtualized balances, you can open as many limit orders as you want, as long as you have the balances to fulfill them. And all those limit orders that you open are constantly accruing yield and interest from bentobox strategies on polygon. This doesn't happen on a centralized exchange, and centralized exchanges kind of limit you to the number of limit orders you can open based off of your balance. So we're starting to see very interesting uxui changes that kind of decentralized infrastructure affords. But as I said, it's still early days, Ethereum, mainnet, et cetera. There's lots of infrastructural improvements.
00:16:34.742 - 00:16:55.170, Speaker B: UX UI, the whole wallet onboarding process is still a huge pain point for average users, but these things will eventually get solved, and then protocols like radium sushi curve will start to become very competitive in specific use cases against centralized exchanges.
00:16:56.630 - 00:17:41.120, Speaker A: Super interesting. So this view of hybrid dexes that combine amms and order books and take advantage of the new technology on L2, that can compete in functionality even with centralized exchanges. Yeah, if that happens, and you're able to just match users needs so specifically, even in a decentralized way, I think Amm start to become competitive with centralized exchanges. Michael and Alfred, what do you think?
00:17:41.650 - 00:19:11.214, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think this sushi point of view was a little bit more like an engineering one. How can we use all existing Lego pieces, which we have to be able to compete with centralized exchanges? And yes, maybe even that it's possible, but I think we are able to do that even on a more fundamental level. If you look at liquidity efficiency of probably best market makers out there, it appears that it's probably not that difficult to match their efficiency in the world of bonding curves, not really with constant product invariant, because that one is not that capital efficient. But I think if the capital efficiency is larger only by a factor of four, we already can be as efficient as commercial market makers. And really I don't think we are competing with centralized exchanges by themselves. Centralized exchanges, they are kind of designed to do it so that we have one side, the seller and the buyer right. And then it matches them.
00:19:11.214 - 00:20:09.150, Speaker C: Right. But most of liquidity on centralized exchanges is not coming from those sellers with limit orders. It's actually coming from commercial market makers. And commercial market makers are not really that efficient. So it looks like it's possible to probably match their efficiency while probably ending up with more money after this long market making process than they would give to the customer who engages with them. So I think we are at least defi and automatic market makers with some novel bonding curves. They are definitely able to compete with centralized exchanges combined with market making firms.
00:20:09.150 - 00:21:20.360, Speaker C: As for limit orders, I also think that there are a few things possible over there. And uniswap three is a great example of the first step towards what's possible to do with limit orders. Like if you replace a discrete limit order with something continuous in a range, that's already something, and it's possible to do even more interesting stuff with limit orders to even take over that niche. And really, I think that order books is an antiquated concept which originated really from paper order books. Right. They were just digitized. But I think in this digital world, not necessarily on blockchains, it is really possible to switch to more continuous models, whether continuous in price space or continuous in time, and it's possible to do something interesting.
00:21:20.360 - 00:22:01.300, Speaker C: But when we are talking about replacing market making firms, it's really like the automated market makers. But when we are talking about replacing limit orders, it's already like a little bit in between automated market makers and limit orders. Right. And these concepts, they don't have to exist in decentralized world. They could exist on centralized exchanges as well. It's just centralized exchanges. They really tried to follow the classic order book models and I think they definitely could go beyond that.
00:22:01.750 - 00:22:02.500, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:22:02.950 - 00:22:13.320, Speaker C: Yeah, but I haven't seen that though. And I'm totally all for the decentralized web3 world taking over centralized exchange world.
00:22:14.410 - 00:22:25.190, Speaker A: Do you think you should replace market makers or are decentralized exchanges really trying to attract market makers?
00:22:25.350 - 00:23:18.566, Speaker C: Well, I mean, market makers on decentralized exchanges, they don't have to be that as sophisticated as centralized exchanges. They don't have to run any bots because the smart contracts run bots for them, essentially. And you can attract not as smart of a liquidity. So you don't have to have this middleman who runs the bot. You can pretty much remove that middleman. And because they collected, I guess quite good revenues, they also probably attracted only like part of audience and didn't attract the broader one. They didn't want to pay these fees, well hidden fees.
00:23:18.566 - 00:23:35.220, Speaker C: So now they can go directly to Dexes. And I think that Dexes are able to attract more liquidity, well, even institutional one. But as soon as institutions get comfortable with web3 world.
00:23:37.110 - 00:24:34.660, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a matter of when, not if. So, you all have mentioned concentrated liquidity, and I think that's been one of the big innovations in decentralized exchanges, at least recently. How are you incorporating this new concept, and how has it been working so far? Do you think these concentrated liquidity pools and these specific bonding curves, rather than the initial generalized bonding curve, do you think that transition is here to stay? Is this kind of the new model for DeXs? Or are there cases where just like a simple generalized bonding curve still works?
00:24:35.030 - 00:24:47.640, Speaker C: Well, simple generalized bonding curve is a good back off, which is also a good benchmark, but I think specialized ones are.
00:24:50.890 - 00:25:33.080, Speaker B: Think it's, if you look at all the liquidity providers in DeFi right now, it's about preference, right? There's definitely a specific group that has a specific preference for concentrated liquidity. It's highly capital efficient if you're sophisticated enough. So those models will always be options that are, I guess, here to stay. Right, because concentrated liquidity definitely has its benefits. And as Michael said, constant product is always a good automated fallback. It's the easiest one to understand. Most liquidity providers, and also institutionals are beginning to understand constant product.
00:25:33.080 - 00:26:14.370, Speaker B: Concentrated liquidity probably requires a bit higher level of sophistication. And I think at the end of the day, going to the topic of market makers, if you look at DeFi, the entry level into DeFi, especially for these long tail assets, is very low. Traditionally, if you wanted to even list anything on exchange, like binance, et cetera, you have to engage with market makers, you have to provide a certain amount of liquidity, probably even pay listing fees, so that whole world is more sophisticated and has a higher barrier to entry, whereas if you see in defi with constant product, it's much more lower barriers.
00:26:15.210 - 00:26:20.390, Speaker C: And that world which you mentioned is definitely the one which the defi is disrupting.
00:26:20.730 - 00:27:29.286, Speaker A: Definitely, yeah, I think that's exactly what was so exciting about amms to start with. Just like the low barrier to entry for both projects looking to list their tokens, now, suddenly anyone could have their token be traded without paying huge fees or dealing with anyone. And also for liquidity providers, suddenly there's this whole new way of earning yield in crypto, which it's not like about speculative trading anymore. As much as you can go and provide liquidity and get fees. It just opened this whole new world in crypto. So, yeah, I agree. But does concentrated liquidity, isn't it still possible to just have that low barrier to entry for listing tokens and providing liquidity even with concentrated liquidity? Or does that make things harder?
00:27:29.398 - 00:28:00.920, Speaker C: Yeah, well, if everything is fully automated, you may have parameters. Parameters which suit all assets are a little bit hard. So we still look if that's possible. I think it is, but, yeah, I think it's possible. I think bigger problem right now is gas fee on Ethereum, which L2 solve and whatever. But that's kind of a different problem.
00:28:02.890 - 00:28:51.800, Speaker A: Yeah, so let's talk about that, because I think that is kind of an elephant in the room when talking about any application or protocol building in Defi and yeah, that's what we have. Chains like Solana really taking off and projects like radium building there, just the really high gas costs. So how are all of you dealing with that? I know sushi is on many different chains. I imagine you're all looking very closely at different scaling solutions. So, yeah. What's your take?
00:28:56.680 - 00:29:45.540, Speaker B: I guess ASU, right. We're pretty much chain agnostic, as we like to think of ourselves. Anywhere that's EV compatible will probably deploy to, or it's on our kind of deployment timeline. So I think so far we've deployed to roughly 24 testnets and main net. To be honest, I think from a technical perspective, optimistic roll ups are the next innovation. And then after that would be zk snarks and zk proofs and ZK sync and all of those zk scaling solutions. For now, I think the L two scaling solutions are pretty nascent.
00:29:45.540 - 00:30:18.320, Speaker B: We have a lot of nascent EVM compatible side chains, if you will. And these all foster their own communities. So Susie's approach is we're waiting for kind of, kind of the L two scaling solutions to mature. And we're working very closely with arbitram and other teams. And for these side chains, they're great opportunities to create and foster more communities, I think. Michael?
00:30:18.980 - 00:30:33.748, Speaker C: Yeah, we follow pretty much similar approach. So we do deploy in different side chains, different layer, but actually, I will have to disconnect pretty much right now.
00:30:33.914 - 00:31:06.530, Speaker A: Okay, well, Michael, thank you so much for joining us. And, yeah, go ahead and thanks again. It's great getting your take so far. Bye. And Alphare, like, are you only building on Solana? What do you think? Is it going to be like a multi chain defi future? Or do you see kind of solana winning out?
00:31:07.940 - 00:31:32.650, Speaker D: We definitely see a multi chain future in the short to middle term at least, who the final winner will be will be very hard to call at this moment. Being on Solana, since everything is written and bus driver and solidity. We're not very EVM compatible at the moment, so we are into it and it is exciting to see across chain world.
00:31:33.660 - 00:31:37.880, Speaker A: So are you looking to launch on other chains?
00:31:39.260 - 00:32:12.548, Speaker D: Not at the moment. Well, we always need to keep up with the ecosystem, right? You got to see what everyone's building on other chains, what advantages there are on other chains, and just understand the space better. Even if you can't really do anything on other chains at the moment. Solana is a little bit siloed off in that it doesn't have many bridges, applications, other chains either. So it's important to just keep looking around and make sure that you're up.
00:32:12.554 - 00:32:13.670, Speaker B: To date on everything.
00:32:17.720 - 00:33:37.250, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we're starting to see this evolution in DeFi, where you have kind of EVM compatible chains and then non EVM compatible chains, whether it's already bringing more diversity to the space, whereas before it was like Ethereum and non Ethereum, now you have different options. As long as the chain is EVM compatible, then it's really easy for projects to just launch on multiple chains. I think that's a really interesting development, but with all of these different L2s on Ethereum and side chains and other layer ones and projects launching everywhere, how do you deal with liquidity fragmentation if there's a sushi swap? You said like 24 different test nets, and then that goes live. How do you deal with just the user experience of having users on liquidity across so many different chains? How mature is the bridge infrastructure to port that liquidity over? How is that looking?
00:33:38.820 - 00:34:23.192, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I think essentially when sushi moves to a new EVM compatible chain, it's kind of like a restart, right? We're relaunching. We have to have seed it with new incentives, we have to attract new liquidity. I think bridging is definitely an important topic these days. Lots of the chains we've interacted with, they either have their own native bridges and their own solutions, but we also see, like, third party bridges that are becoming very prevalent in this space. And I think generally, liquidity fragmentation is a concern. But as I said, most of the side chains that we go to, we discover that they have entirely new communities and new liquidity.
00:34:23.192 - 00:35:33.670, Speaker B: So we don't really see any liquidity fragmentation from our main net liquidity or any people moving significant amounts to other networks that might have temporarily higher incentives, et cetera. I would say liquidity is pretty sticky to the chain and we do see some movement to arbitrum. Like Sushi has around 350,000,000 Tvl there currently, and that's all organic with very low incentives. So there is some confluence of some networks generally with regards to liquidity fragmentation. I think it's going to get quite interesting when we put our amm onto bentobox, because Bentobox has this concept of, as I said, virtualized balances. So when you deposit your tokens into bentobox, you're technically getting a share and you're getting like a virtualized balance that's represented through every decentralized application within bento box, if you take that into consideration. So all those 24 networks that we kind of deploy the minimum bare bones amm to, we've also deployed bento box.
00:35:33.670 - 00:37:08.900, Speaker B: There are solutions to have all the Bento boxes interact with each other in kind of this reserve banking, fractional reserve banking style, where users can be on specific chains and gain access to the liquidity of other chains without even realizing they're leaving their, without even having to leave their chain or switch to another network or even realizing that that liquidity is actually being sourced from another chain. I think there's some opportunities in meta transactions and other unreleased. I'm dropping a lot of alpha right now, but unreleased solutions that will allow kind of this cross chain use of liquidity. That'll be super interesting. And we're working with other partners on zk scaling solutions, et cetera, and brainstorming ideas where we can use the liquidity on mainnet without actually having to fragment it. So there's lots of discussions about these. I think definitely in two to three quarters we'll start to see this multichain infrastructure make more sense because currently it doesn't really, right? Because it's just like technically a bunch of new sushis on new chains, none of them really related to each other other than the brand, essentially.
00:37:08.900 - 00:37:15.270, Speaker B: And we'll start to see lots of different architectures emerge and that should be definitely interesting.
00:37:15.880 - 00:37:58.944, Speaker A: Wow, that's so interesting. I mean, a few points to note there. One is, I think it's notable what you say, that on each chain you launch, you find a different community, different users, and different liquidity. So it's not like launching on other chain means that you're taking liquidity from one chain and porting it to another because of incentives. It's like, okay, if there's someone who is trading on Ethereum, they will stay on Ethereum, right. Even if there's incentives elsewhere, if there's traders on Solana, they will stay there and so on. So that's a really interesting insight.
00:37:58.944 - 00:38:52.420, Speaker A: And then the other point of having maybe viewing layer ones as the place where, as the backbone where liquidity is sourced, maybe from liquidity providers and market makers or institutions. And then if there's a way where you can cross over that liquidity or unite it somehow, and then users on each different ecosystem can just stay in that ecosystem, but then they can benefit from having just this huge shared pool of liquidity across many different layer ones. Is that kind of your vision on where this is going?
00:38:52.570 - 00:39:20.328, Speaker B: Yeah, this is at sushi. We've always described kind of bento box as a layer 1.5, if you will. And this 1.5 has various advantages, right? Where different bento boxes can technically be associated with each other given appropriate upgrades. That's the general vision we're moving to. And this is why we're so aggressively expanding to every possible EVM compatible chain.
00:39:20.328 - 00:40:09.564, Speaker B: Because at the end of the day, we want the users, we want to kind of at least insert ourselves into those communities and let them know that, hey, we're a solution. And then eventually those. It's like a pinwheel effect, right? You start building up unique types of liquidity on other networks, and then eventually the solution would be to unite all of the liquidity together so that all your users have a net benefit of being able to access all the disparate specialized liquidity from other networks. Right? For example, it may be the case that sushi on Phantom has a very deep ETH phantom pool and has the, even with constant product, it has low price impact on that pool. That might not be the case for mainnet because there's very little phantom liquidity. For an example. As an example.
00:40:09.564 - 00:40:31.410, Speaker B: And there may be a future in sushi where it doesn't matter where the liquidity is, as long as it's on kind of sushi, regardless of the network, the user will be able to access and perform those swaps and realize that liquidity, regardless of what network you're on.
00:40:32.520 - 00:40:48.890, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. That would be pretty ideal. And you mentioned that you're doing this on EVM compatible. Like, are you on Solana? Do you plan to be there? And then.
00:40:52.620 - 00:41:49.496, Speaker B: I think a lot of chains will support EVM compatibility. It is kind of an older standard for us. It's more, to be quite truthful, it's a resourcing issue. We don't want to be maintaining separate stacks and separate code bases and separate auditing processes to kind of keep them all in line. We are thinking and working on experimental kind of like zk scaling solutions, but those are all experimental, whether or not they go into production, or whether or not we even those solutions might even be EVM compatible one day as well. And to be honest, I think there are some projects on Solana that are trying to make Solana EVM compatible as well. And when that happens, Sushi will definitely, as we said, we're chain agnostic.
00:41:49.496 - 00:41:52.204, Speaker B: We go wherever EVM compatibility is.
00:41:52.402 - 00:42:25.480, Speaker A: Got it, Alfred. So as a project on Solana, how do you deal with this kind of framework where there's a lot of liquidity just on EVM compatible chains? Do you have bridges that you can use to get to those users and to that liquidity? What are kind of the plans?
00:42:28.700 - 00:42:39.870, Speaker D: So Solana is actually a very interesting place to be right now in terms of liquidity fragmentation, because it doesn't have a.
00:42:42.880 - 00:42:44.200, Speaker B: Official bridge.
00:42:44.360 - 00:43:37.196, Speaker D: So then what happened is that there's a lot of solutions coming out. Everybody's making their own bridges and trying to be the biggest bridge on Solana. But what happens is that every bridge comes out with their own version of a bridge token, right? So you have this bridge's wrap token from Ethereum, and that bridge is wrapped token from Ethereum. These are both wrapped Ethereum, but they are actually different assets because they're from different bridges. And what we see is liquidity, really, or a problem we foresee is liquidity getting scattered between these competing bridges. And users coming in from one bridge would not be able to access liquidity or trade against liquidity that came from another bridge. And this is already starting to cause a small headache here.
00:43:37.378 - 00:43:38.270, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
00:43:38.800 - 00:43:46.640, Speaker D: Yeah. So we're working hard on figuring out ways to make everybody more compatible.
00:43:48.280 - 00:44:16.990, Speaker A: Oh, I didn't realize that was happening. Okay, so if I understood correctly, people are coming on Solana through all these different bridges, but when they do so, their tokens become wrapped on kind of whatever bridge they used. Those wrapped tokens can't interact with each other. Is that what's happening?
00:44:17.600 - 00:44:30.720, Speaker D: Yeah. So it's kind of like you can think of it like Ren BTC versus wrap BDC on top of Ethereum. And just adding four more different bridges to that solution.
00:44:34.660 - 00:44:39.776, Speaker B: Mean it's bad Michael left. He would have a. Yeah, because Michael.
00:44:39.808 - 00:44:40.950, Speaker D: Would be perfect for.
00:44:45.480 - 00:44:46.950, Speaker A: What'S curve doing.
00:44:47.320 - 00:45:14.960, Speaker B: No, because they're like assets. So they're like pegged. Know, rembTc, wrapped BTC, they're all pegged. Technically to BTC. So that's like a perfect, oh, that's a perfect use case for curve if they're willing to build on Solana and rearchitecture into rust. But yeah, those are good solutions.
00:45:16.100 - 00:45:25.408, Speaker A: Oh, that's right. There can be a decks that focus exclusively on trading all these bridge assets, basically.
00:45:25.494 - 00:45:25.984, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:45:26.102 - 00:45:52.970, Speaker B: These different bridging standards. This is commonly also becoming a problem on multi chains in general. Right. There's different bridges that are coming out. All of them want to be the EVM bridge, and some of them have their own standards and some of them have the native assets. So on some of the newer multi chain networks, newer side chains, or even on Kusama style polkadot chains. Right.
00:45:52.970 - 00:46:26.150, Speaker B: We're starting to see this issue that alpha just described, which is you start to have micro liquidity fragmentation because the assets are not the same. You could have different standards of weth, you could have different implementations of bridged sushi, for example, and curve. And also stable swap solutions would be, you know, perfect solutions to, to address this issue.
00:46:28.280 - 00:47:38.460, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds like a headache. Okay. To, to start wrapping up, I don't want to go before talking about yield farming and liquidity mining, it's such a huge topic. It kind of fueled defi summer and Dexes are of course like a key piece in all of this. So to catch everyone up, of course, liquidity mining is the practice of giving users and liquidity providers on protocols, token rewards in exchange for using a protocol. And now there's this, I don't know if backlash, but at least there are different projects trying to look for alternatives to yield farming, because one of the consequences is that of using yield farming is that liquidity comes and goes very easily. As soon as rewards are over, all of that liquidity goes away to the next farm.
00:47:38.460 - 00:48:10.120, Speaker A: And so there's projects like Olympus, Dow and Tokymac trying to kind of reformulate how people can attract liquidity. So, yeah, I'd love your thoughts on this development. How do Dexes, which have been such a big part of yield farming, how do they fit in this kind of new movement?
00:48:12.940 - 00:49:35.040, Speaker B: Definitely, I think for yield farming and its long term sustainability, I think farming was essentially a bootstrapping mechanism. Right? Because you want to attract liquidity quickly and then you want the liquidity to stick once volume picks up, once fees pick up, et cetera, because then those liquidity positions can become capital efficient. As Michael mentioned, Sushi, we take a very engineering oriented approach to this, which is liquidity mining. Rewards won't last forever, so it's really about using existing Lego pieces to continue yield mechanisms. So this is why we're building on top of bentobox, and why Bentobox has kind of these virtualized balances that you can use the underlying balance and make them more capital efficient through different strategies. And this should make up for decreasing incentives, et cetera. There's also lots of discussions regarding concentrated liquidity, because if you know how to use concentrated correctly, you stand to gain outsized fees, which should be more than any incentives that are offered to regular, equalized, kind of constant product pools.
00:49:35.040 - 00:50:10.520, Speaker B: I think that is, we'll continue to see different incentive structures pop up. So we're already kind of seeing, people are talking about like DFI 2.0, et cetera. Like these kinds of new styles of incentive programs that are developed. Those can definitely also be incorporated in DFI 1.0. But generally, I think it's all about the incentives. Give you a Runway, essentially, but that Runway eventually ends.
00:50:10.520 - 00:50:35.510, Speaker B: And the expectation at the end of that Runway is that you've built a system that's highly capital efficient and can stand on its own without incentives. So that's where I think generally the whole defi space is moving, right? As people are, like, tamping down rewards, et cetera, and as protocols are becoming more and more efficient, or engineering new ways to become. To combine efficiencies, in a sense.
00:50:38.860 - 00:50:54.840, Speaker A: Do you see liquidity mining, how it's been used so far? Do you see that still continuing with kind of this, maybe in a combination of these new mechanisms?
00:50:55.180 - 00:51:43.576, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. I mean, we definitely see that. We're also seeing, for example, on polygon, we see different liquidity mining types, right? We see a lot of auto compounding vaults, et cetera. We'll always see kind of these, I would say, smaller dexes with hyper incentive programs. But whether or not they can maintain those incentive programs, I think will be short lived unless they kind of prove that they can generate actual volume. I think that's a combination of both arbitrage and also retail and institutional trading. And at the end of the day, I think these will become more and more efficient.
00:51:43.576 - 00:52:25.732, Speaker B: Right. Even on arbitrum, for example, or when we first went to polygon, on kind of these high latency networks, usually we would see around 20% utilization of the liquidity from constant product pools. And on those networks, we were seeing on some days, upwards to 80% to 100% utilization of all the liquidity. Right. I think this is what happens when people are performing, when trade sizes are smaller and there's lower gas fees or almost no gas fees. It accommodates more users and so you see a higher volume of trades. I think as Michael said, it's all about the fundamental design of amms.
00:52:25.732 - 00:53:08.580, Speaker B: As those improve along with the L two scaling solutions. It might be the case that liquidity mining is technically not necessary unless you're first starting. Right. But in order to start, you'll need to kind of defend your moat for the long run. And I think the moat really comes down to both community, it also comes down to branding, it also comes down to the pace of innovation in kind of the decentralized autonomous organization. These things are all moats. And this is what has kept she pretty resilient to other, as you would say, food tokens.
00:53:08.580 - 00:53:10.856, Speaker B: Yeah, right.
00:53:11.038 - 00:54:04.136, Speaker A: Yeah. It's so interesting. It is kind of viewing liquidity mining as almost like a marketing budget at the start of a project. And then if the project is strong enough, then it won't even need liquidity mining in the long run. Implement that program at the start. As these projects create their own mode or their own way to differentiate themselves among so many competitors, which has always been, I think, such an interesting challenge for DeFi. And just like open source building in general, create a mode in a world where everyone can just come and fork your code.
00:54:04.318 - 00:54:28.860, Speaker B: Definitely. I think what can't be forked is community and human resources and human talent. Right. Those things are very difficult to acquire, like organically and gratefully sushi has been able to establish that moat. Right. We have a very large community. We also have lots of contributors.
00:54:28.860 - 00:54:39.990, Speaker B: We also have very talented contributors. And this has kept given us at least an engineering product edge where we're building new features all the time.
00:54:40.840 - 00:55:25.520, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's been kind of a theme all throughout defi that you can't fork community. And it's becoming kind of like a cliche. And I think there is kind of this debate on whether the tech wins or the community wins. Of course, if you have better tech, that is a huge advantage. But it's still really hard to beat out a strong community, even for if a project doesn't have the most innovative design, or just like even if a project that doesn't have the best tech, if they have a better community, I think that's already hard to overcome.
00:55:26.100 - 00:55:39.168, Speaker B: Exactly. And at the end of the day, all of it is kind of about product market fit. And I think many protocols are still discovering what elements or what dimensions they can meet. Product market fit.
00:55:39.354 - 00:55:51.050, Speaker A: Yeah. Alpha, what are your thoughts here on the future of liquidity mining and yield farming and modes in DFI and web3.
00:55:51.660 - 00:56:43.108, Speaker D: Yes. So basically I agree with a lot of. What I'd like to add on to it is, well, yeah, so yield farming cannot last forever, right? Internet tokens don't really work out that well in the end. And basically we think of the problem as you have users who need to swap and they need liquidity. You have liquidity providers, or these people would generally be investors who are looking for an Amm or an algorithm, something to invest in for more steady yield. And you also have projects that need liquidity for their projects. So what we've done is we've started this fusion pools, which is a way for projects to generate their own liquidity.
00:56:43.108 - 00:57:41.740, Speaker D: Basically they give out rewards to their project tokens and they build liquidity in this way. And for them, in the end, it's about. Well, there is some sort of an impermanent loss. Back from impermanent loss question earlier. There would be some impermanent loss in this, but if you look at any major market maker, or if you look at any market maker on centralized exchanges, they would also face impermanent losses. That impermanent loss isn't just a problem for Amm, right? If you're market making on a centralized exchange, and you have a set number of tokens, when the price goes up and you are selling these tokens, that is very much still a permanent loss. It's just about making an AMM or a smarter algorithm that you can capitalize more when the prices are less volatile or lose less when the prices are more volatile.
00:57:41.740 - 00:58:36.690, Speaker D: So it comes down to, to solve the problem, liquidity incentives, it's basically how do you appease the investors? Basically, how can you generate yield for them when there's no more liquidity mining rewards. So this can come down to smarter market making algorithms. So improvements on the standard AMM curve, or higher capital efficiency, as through lending or through other methods of generating yield for investors and for end users, it really comes down to attracting end users, right, because all this is generated, all these yields are generated from end users actually trading and using the protocol. Yeah. So it is a combination of these three. How can you appease the investors of the users while also attracting projects at the same time?
00:58:37.220 - 00:59:30.044, Speaker A: Yeah, super interesting. I think in general, in Defi you're combining so many different sophisticated and complicated things with crypto and finance. But in the end, when it really comes down to it, it's about providing useful tools for users. You can add crazy yield schemes on top and strategies and all these different things. But if you don't have a good product, and if you're not solving a problem for users, then it doesn't matter in the end. Like, all of those fancy yield strategies will fall and run out at some point. Yeah.
00:59:30.044 - 01:00:22.400, Speaker A: So we are coming to the end of the stream. Really, thank you guys for, for taking the time. This was such an interesting conversation. So much alpha leaked and yeah, it's really interesting how Dexes are shaping up compared to where they were just in 2019 when DFI started and how far the space has come in just a couple of years is mind blowing. I have no doubt Dexes will take over finance and trading because look how far we've come already. So thank you guys for joining me. Have a great rest of your day and thanks everyone who joined the stream and claim your poaps.
01:00:22.400 - 01:00:58.828, Speaker A: 1 second, it looks like the link isn't showing for the poaps. I will try to drop the link. Sorry about that. Okay, dropping the link. Sorry about that. All right, there we go. I think that worked.
01:00:58.828 - 01:01:06.076, Speaker A: Anyways, thank you so much, Alpha and Omacas, it was a pleasure chatting and thanks, everyone. Bye, guys.
01:01:06.258 - 01:01:07.080, Speaker B: Thank you. Bye.
