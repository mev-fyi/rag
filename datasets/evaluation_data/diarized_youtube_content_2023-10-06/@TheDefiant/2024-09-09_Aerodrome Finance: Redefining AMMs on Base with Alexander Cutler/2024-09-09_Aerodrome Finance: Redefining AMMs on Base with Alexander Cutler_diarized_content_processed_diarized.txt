00:00:05.120 - 00:00:30.420, Speaker A: Okay, here we are with Alex Cutler from Aerodrome. Aerodrome is a decentralized exchange, who, or I should say which has been making waves in Defi, really shooting up the charts recently. So excited to have Alex here on the podcast to tell us what's been driving that growth. Can we just start with the Aerodrome founding story?
00:00:31.120 - 00:00:31.544, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:31.592 - 00:00:38.504, Speaker A: What led you to start it? And then we can take it from there.
00:00:38.672 - 00:01:44.376, Speaker C: So I guess to tell the full story, right, we need to kind of go back to the last big boom of the bull market. Andre Krone, who was of course one of the godfathers of Defi, launched an exchange on Phantom that he called Solidly. And if you were around for this moment, you remember, it was very exciting because the. The idea behind Solidly would. Was that wouldn't it be great if you pulled together some of the best Dex primitives from Uniswap, from Curve, from Convex, you rolled it all into a single design that could serve as sort of that central trading and liquidity hub of an ecosystem. And the excitement around this was, was so palpable at the time that billions of dollars flowed into the Phantom ecosystem. But then, of course, things went pretty crazy, right? Andre ended up leaving Defi.
00:01:44.376 - 00:03:16.152, Speaker C: I think a lot of us who were very close to Solidly, and at that point I was contributing to a DAO that was kind of all about maximizing the accumulation of solid tokens. I think we. We discovered some issues with, with the original design, and then it was just one blow after another of the bear market, right, of the Luna collapse of FTX and all that sort of stuff. So the founding story really just starts with, you know, Andre launched this amazing new Dex primitive, right, that was very much, we believe, to be a next generation Dex. And the things that were suboptimal in Solidly or bugs in solidly were all things that we felt were addressable, right? If you tweak some of the economic parameters in it, if you fix some of the bugs, if you continue to add and to improve on it, we thought it really could be the thing that the market and everybody really believed it to be, which was the next great new Dex primitive. And so knowing we were like entering this absolute bear market, we, as we identified the changes we wanted to make first was like what was going to be a pocket of Defi or Crypto, that even if the whole industry was maybe going through a contraction moment, that we'd still see pockets of growth. And our thesis was that would be Ethereum L2s.
00:03:16.152 - 00:04:37.556, Speaker C: And then what was the Ethereum L2 that we thought was poised for the most growth, that was maybe struggling the most with liquidity, the problem that a really great decentralized exchange can solve. That's how we got started with Velodrome in the optimism ecosystem. The story of Velodrome is very, very similar to aerodrome, where very, very quickly, you know, Velodrome rose up to be not only the top decks on optimism, but often one of the top protocols and helped to kind of unlock growth for that optimism ecosystem. And I think we saw what we saw our thesis play out in that even as the industry shrunk, as capital flew out of alternative layer ones and elsewhere, optimism continued to grow. And then when the Optimism team announced the partnership with Coinbase that would lead to Base, it was kind of a very easy conversation of, you know, base has the same fundamental needs. They're going to need that native decentralized exchange liquidity layer. And in fact, they're going to need it maybe even more so, because famously they were very clear from the beginning.
00:04:37.556 - 00:05:02.360, Speaker C: There will be no token, right? So it needed that sort of secondary economic engine. And so that was basically the idea. Let's take the best of Curve convex Uni v2, Uni v3, build it into a single streamlined design that can serve as that primary liquidity layer, that primary economic engines of these growing Ethereum L2 ecosystems.
00:05:02.850 - 00:05:04.250, Speaker A: That's super interesting.
00:05:04.410 - 00:05:24.458, Speaker B: I'm curious to hear what made you form this thesis that Ethereum layer 2s would be the ecosystem to benefit the most in a bear market. Like, why not another layer one or just like Ethereum mainnet?
00:05:24.634 - 00:06:46.466, Speaker C: Yeah, I think how we thought about it at the time is we were already beginning to see the signals that the alternate layer one ecosystems, which had been very, very propped up by incentives, were beginning to falter. Right. The idea of deeply incentivizing these ecosystems is to bootstrap a certain amount of activity, right? Economic activity, such that these ecosystems could self sustain and grow even as maybe the incentive spigot came off. And what we were seeing is not much organic traction in a lot of these other ecosystems. And so if you think about these incentives in many way being underwritten by the major investors in these projects, that if investment in the entire industry was going to sort of shrink, that these incentives would sort of shrink. And so the main thing propping up, I think a lot of the activity on some of these alt layer ones would shrink very quickly. But in the end, I think the value prop of them at the time was, right, they were faster, they were cheaper, they were easy to use.
00:06:46.466 - 00:08:02.644, Speaker C: And they were deeply incentivized. Now they made all sorts of trade off decisions associated with that. But that was so much the value. I mean, when I was an early user and, and I just wanted to play around in defi, it was great playing around in an environment where I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for any single transaction in terms of gas costs. So what we thought L2s basically were going to provide was the benefits, the basically primary benefits of Alt L1s in the sense of they are going to have that fast, cheap experience that makes them much, much more accessible, but they're going to do it building as a part of the Ethereum ecosystem. So you have the benefit of being part of the broader Ethereum ecosystem and that they were going to be able to in many cases of course launch their own tokens and then hopefully learn from the experience of these alt L1s and the kind of unsustainable incentivization strategies that they went through. So for example, optimism built this really interesting model whereby they have retro funding at the core of it, which is if you create impact on optimism, that creates sequencer fees.
00:08:02.644 - 00:08:29.334, Speaker C: Those sequencer fees will go towards funding public goods in this ecosystem, create more activity, et cetera. And so we kind of thought it was the best of all worlds. They're going to be fast and cheap, they're going to be incentivized, but in a more smart way. And in the end we probably don't need all this block space of all these many different alt L1s. We want it to all be part of this cohesive Ethereum ecosystem. And so yeah, that was our bet.
00:08:29.502 - 00:08:30.410, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:08:31.710 - 00:08:43.654, Speaker B: Why did you decide to build directly on layer 2s and not go to Ethereum first and then go to different L2s?
00:08:43.782 - 00:10:31.420, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we've long been thesis driven and so for us going to layer one like layer one Ethereum or of course going to one of these alt layer ones at the time, because this hadn't quite played out yet, it felt a bit more like going to where the puck is versus where the puck is going. Right? That we figured that over time as L2s became faster through things like 4844, as they became more secure, entering like stage one decentralization, that liquidity users new and novel products, that they were going to increasingly shift towards L2s. So certainly you could like go and you know, fight for a place in a very crowded L1 that really already its liquidity needs are well serviced. So be kind of an uphill battle or while all the other players are still very focused on servicing that existing sort of paradigm, you could go to where it's all moving towards and you could kind of establish that dominant market share there, such that when maybe the rest of the Dex landscape wakes up and says, oh my gosh, well now there's more rapdeet volume happening on base than Ethereum Mainnet, it's already sort of been serviced very effectively by products like Velodrome and Airdro. That's always what we've been trying to do is we want to not go to where things are. We want to go to where things are going. And we, yes, increasingly see eth layer 2s is the place that people are going as they become faster, cheaper and more secure.
00:10:31.760 - 00:10:37.460, Speaker A: Super interesting. And I mean, great job predicting a trend that actually did play out.
00:10:38.800 - 00:10:52.030, Speaker B: So on that kind of narrative, would you consider going to Solana? Like, obviously Solana has had amazing growth in the past year. Is that something you, you thought about?
00:10:52.570 - 00:11:35.814, Speaker C: Yeah, we've, we've definitely thought about it. We've. It. It's like I would frame our philosophy as, as we are fairly like Ethereum aligned and we are very like bullish and optimistic on the division presented by the broader optimism superchain. Right. This idea that you're going to have companies like Coinbase and Sony as well as great defi builders like Frax building this network of chains on Ethereum and that if that is where the puck is going, we should stay as focused as we can there. But you never want to put complete blinders on and not see a potential opportunity.
00:11:35.814 - 00:12:31.810, Speaker C: So I think we've always just kept an eye on Solana because, you know, it would be a complete rebuild and rewrite of the underlying technology. It has to be like a significant bet. And I think the big question mark there has always just been like, how real is the activity, the volume and the adoption there and you know, how much of it is, you know, a very small group of people facilitating a lot of that all aligned with the projects that are already there. And so, you know, we just haven't yet seen everything come together such that we could like develop a thesis that says, yes, absolutely, it's a no brainer to go there. It's a no brainer to spend the time investment there versus, you know, focusing on where we think that there will be a ton in this like broader super chain and all of that sort of fun stuff.
00:12:32.110 - 00:12:33.130, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:12:34.350 - 00:12:52.770, Speaker B: What about Aerodrome and Velodrome differentiates them from other Dexes. You said you took all the best features from existing dexes to create this new one. What are they?
00:12:55.790 - 00:13:54.516, Speaker C: You can think about a few different dynamics or a few different aspects of things that when you add them all together make up like what, what a dex is. So obviously there's like the underlying AMMs and, and you know, the big winning AMMs of the last two years have basically been Uni V2 style full range pools, right? Even with Uni V3, plenty of liquidity pools, plenty of tokens very well served by Univ2 style pools. You've got Curve style stable swap pools. They're very much optimized for those highly correlated assets. And then you've got uni v3 style concentrated liquidity pools which are very, very good for the like highest volume, most traded pools. But if you are looking to interact with those different AMMs, I mean ideally you don't want to have to go to Curve. If you want one thing, you want good uni.
00:13:54.516 - 00:15:01.746, Speaker C: If you want another toggle between the V2 interface, the V3 interface or things like that. And then even on L2s, like when we launched uni was just deploying their V3 there, they weren't even launching their V2 or things like that. So one aspect of it was let's grab all the best AMM models and let's put them in one place. But another aspect of it is the core underlying economic model. And like the big innovation that Curve brought to the AMM space I think was actually around the token and incentivization model, right? If you are like a new project or protocol looking to deploy and incentivize your liquidity, usually Uniswap is not the best way to do it. And Curve had this amazing model whereby you could incentivize voters, voters would direct emissions to your pool, help you bootstrap, solve that cold start problem. And then there's this utility of the token where it can be taken and locked and voted to direct emissions.
00:15:01.746 - 00:15:56.370, Speaker C: And then you're earning a percentage of the overall fees the protocol generates. So you've begun to stitch together the different user groups, right, which is going to be liquidity. Providers get something, traders get something, and then the token lockers and voters get something. And it's all about how do you connect together these three groups into a really well balanced model. But there are aspects of like the Curve model that are suboptimal, right? For instance, as a curve voter, right, you are getting a percentage of the total amount of fees generated. But if you vote for a highly productive pool, you Know something that's generating millions in fees, you get the same reward as somebody voting for a pool that generates like hundreds of dollars in fees. And so there's not the sort of automatic self optimizing system.
00:15:56.370 - 00:16:35.768, Speaker C: If you want any ability to get liquid on your locked curve position, you have to go deposit that into convex. Convex is going to give you the liquid tokens back. They are going to take their own sort of fee or cut from that. So there's a degree of value escaping the system. Features that in theory could be built into the base layer are now built into this entirely different product. And that product's going to take a degree of rent there. If you want to use the vote optimizer in Vodium, which is a great product and it's one of my first favorite products when I was first using Defi, that's again, that's another layer, it's another product, it's another degree of fees there.
00:16:35.768 - 00:17:42.294, Speaker C: And so our thinking was let's take very much the parts of Curve that were so innovative from an economic standpoint, let's upgrade them, let's make them even more optimal than what we saw with Curve. Let's take all those best AMM types and let's tie it together into this single streamlined design and also continue to make improvements like even our Slipstream, which is our version of uni V3 style concentrated liquidity. I think we've applied things like wider tick spacing to require less rebalancing. When you combine that model with the token incentive model, it delivers a more sustainable and predictable stream of rewards. If you're like an LP on Uni, if it's a big volume day, you might make a ton of fees. If it's a low volume day, you might make very little in fees. And us sort of directing emissions rewards only to active liquidity a predictable way also kind of makes it like a better LP experience.
00:17:42.294 - 00:17:54.370, Speaker C: So yeah, I really think it, you know, taking all of the best parts of the Dex landscape, making improvements based on what we've seen that's worked and not, and putting it together into this streamlined design.
00:17:54.990 - 00:18:39.222, Speaker A: Great. Okay, so basically taking the Dex models that have worked AMMs with uni V2 style and V3 concentrated liquidity, also curve stable pools, putting them all in one place and also further optimizing tokenomics. And just like the staking model where you're doing it directly on the protocol and getting a liquidity token in return and making sure that, I guess all players in this ecosystem are being incentivized from liquidity providers to traders to stakers.
00:18:39.366 - 00:18:40.170, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:42.670 - 00:19:10.380, Speaker B: So in terms of that kind of tokenomics. Yeah, I'd love to hear more about that because it's such a big topic on kind of in the Uniswap side of things where obviously like the fee switch has been just like this constant looming question, what's your approach there?
00:19:11.560 - 00:20:29.060, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I think Uniswap is in a tough position and we've, we've been talking about this a lot lately because I think it's like been a, been a conversation in the zeitgeist. I think there's been this idea that hey, look at Uniswap. Uniswap is totally unincentivized. It's totally unsubsidized. Uniswap just works. But that isn't exactly true, right? Because the only reason Uniswap is able to offer liquidity providers 100% of the fees is because it has a secondary income stream which is selling uni tokens. And so if you look at Uniswap from a perspective of like a token holder, it looks very similar to any emissions based model, except the emissions are only coming from team and investors unlocking, exchanging those tokens for value, inflating the circulating supply and using that value to subsidize their operations so that they don't have to take any sort of fee from liquidity providers which allows, you know, the.
00:20:29.060 - 00:22:10.092, Speaker C: Basically liquidity providers is like a zero revenue business because all the revenue they make goes right back to liquidity providers. Now I think if they had not had, you know, all of these vesting tokens that they had been able to sell, you would have seen the fee switch turn on years and years ago because they would have needed that sort of revenue stream. And then you would have seen Uniswap having to actually compete in an unsubsidized way. And that's why I think it's kind of like it's no coincidence that at the same moment in time where the final token vests on the uni side are about to hit this year, now we're talking about fee switch because that revenue stream from LPs is going to need to flow at least in some proportion, I think, to the token and thus to labs, to the foundations or things like that. And that is going to be very interesting because that's more a true end game now where it's not just Uniswap's able to sustain its operations through, through token sales and inflating the circulating supply. Now Uniswap needs to do what we were describing in the beginning, right, which is balance all of these different players by redirecting the value being created by it, by the system in ways that hopefully support, you know, the LPs, the token holders, the foundations and all that fun stuff. But yeah, it's very interesting because I don't think it's often talked about in those terms.
00:22:10.092 - 00:22:10.508, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:10.564 - 00:22:43.342, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's, it's a really. Yeah, it's. I think it, it provides a good kind of point of comparison to say, actually the incentives in uniswap are the uni token sales. Or, you know, or. Or maybe more accurately, uni token sales are subsidizing the Uniswap protocol in that they can now provide 100% of the.
00:22:43.366 - 00:23:03.452, Speaker B: Fees to LPs because they don't need to redirect any of those fees to anyone else. So in your case, how does it work? Are part of fees directed to the team and token holders as well as LPs, or how does it work?
00:23:03.646 - 00:24:18.680, Speaker C: Yeah, it's, I think, quite, quite elegant in its simplicity. So 100% of the revenue of the protocol and revenue of the protocol would be fees generated by traders or in incentives that are deposited by protocols to basically attract votes and direct emissions to their pools. So between fees and incentives, those all go to voters. So 100% of all the state fees, most of the liquidity is staked and 100% of the incentives all go to voters. So anybody who's got a ve arrow or a ve bellow voting position each week is voting on which pools they want to support. And generally speaking, they're just going to vote for the pools producing the most rewards. This is basically, basically, I'm going to vote for the most productive pools for the decks, and I'm going to be able to claim the proportional amount of the rewards generated, the revenue generated essentially as incentives for my own participation.
00:24:18.680 - 00:25:24.958, Speaker C: And so when we think about even the role of foundations in that the foundations don't take any cut of fees directly from the platform. This is something, again, I think we see too often in defi is this idea of like, the foundations are going to just take those fees and at some point they'll maybe figure out a way to build them into the system. So from day one, completely immutably, the foundations have only had to rely on their locked token positions to support themselves. So they are in many ways no different than any other person who's come in and locked tokens. They're just participating in the function of the protocol. Protocol Each week they're earning rewards based on that. And it's, it's like very, it's a very helpful incentive alignment because rather than the, the foundations needing to sell tokens and they've never sold a single token and that Aerodrome is not even giving like liquid token allocations to any team members.
00:25:24.958 - 00:25:34.850, Speaker C: So team members will never be like selling any tokens from the. The foundation level is purely through participation in the protocol, purely through voting.
00:25:35.010 - 00:25:58.150, Speaker D: Each week, Protocol 20 introduces Sorobond, which is Stellar's cutting edge smart contracts platform. This creates new surface area for innovation and provides new opportunities for developers to build protocols and products that create access to everyday financial services. So it means a gradual increase in transaction capacity and a chance to fine tune applications. And it's the most transformative upgrade to the Stellar network to date.
00:25:59.610 - 00:26:15.490, Speaker B: All of the fees, and these are fees from trading. And you said also all of the rewards. And, and these are, you said incentives from other protocols, not Aerodrome and Velodrome.
00:26:15.570 - 00:26:56.144, Speaker C: You could think about those. Like, if a pool generates enough fees, right, there's enough incentives going to voters for them to vote to direct error emissions to the pool. But if they aren't generating a lot of fees, then protocols basically need to step in and offer a reward. And that reward operates just like a fee. So if a pool, you know, has $100,000 in fee incentives and another pool has a hundred thousand dollars that a protocol has deposited in voting rewards, they're totally equivalent in the system. They're, they're all sort of revenue being redistributed as incentives for voting.
00:26:56.272 - 00:27:08.820, Speaker B: Okay, and what are the protocols that are using or what's the verb? Deploying the most incentives in Aerodrome and Velodrome?
00:27:09.240 - 00:27:49.880, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's been, I mean it feels like virtually anybody who's building on base or optimism. So, you know, Lido, Resno, synthetics, many great, like ecosystem projects like Moonwell and like so many others, because especially for like newer projects like, this is how they solve the cold start problem, right? This is how they start to build liquidity on their token early on or sustain it over time.
00:27:50.500 - 00:27:52.972, Speaker A: Okay. And then so all of that revenue.
00:27:53.036 - 00:28:15.206, Speaker B: Which again it's trading fees and incentives from protocols who want to bootstrap liquidity in pools on Aerodrome and Velodrome. All of that revenue goes 100%. Like, all of that goes to people staking Aerodrome and Velodrome tokens.
00:28:15.398 - 00:28:27.814, Speaker C: Yeah, we'd say they blocked those tokens. So now they're escrow tokens. And yes, they get them, but only for the pools that they vote for. But yes, that's the idea.
00:28:27.942 - 00:28:32.662, Speaker B: Okay, and then so, and are they also liquidity providers?
00:28:32.806 - 00:28:53.398, Speaker C: Sometimes, but not necessarily. There's plenty of people who will just participate through voting. So they're just there to lock some tokens and make that decision each week on what they're voting for to direct emissions and then earning rewards for kind of providing that function for the protocol.
00:28:53.494 - 00:28:56.130, Speaker A: When you say direct emissions, what do you mean?
00:28:56.590 - 00:29:52.398, Speaker C: So each week on aerodrome aero, emissions are distributed to LPs, right. So we could just say, you know, let's say this week there's going to be a million Arrow tokens distributed to LPs. And the decision on what pools those tokens go to is entirely decided by the votes of those, those folks holding those vote escrow tokens. So you might just be like, you might be somebody like Synthetix, where you're going to vote to direct your votes and thus emissions to the SUSD pool. Or you might just be kind of a mercenary where you're just saying, hey, I'm going to direct emissions to whatever pool is going to give me the highest reward. But yeah, that's how all of the emissions get distributed.
00:29:52.494 - 00:30:01.232, Speaker A: I see. Okay, so LPs aren't incentivized by trading fees, but by emissions, by your own token, emissions.
00:30:01.366 - 00:30:02.188, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:02.364 - 00:30:05.160, Speaker A: And how do you make sure that.
00:30:05.940 - 00:30:23.292, Speaker B: Your token has value? In short, because for your protocol to be sustainable, the way to keep incentivizing liquidity is for your token to maintain value over time.
00:30:23.396 - 00:31:15.056, Speaker C: Yeah, I frame it in terms of utility rather than value. But you know, if you think about, you know, a token like the, the uni token, I guess we were talking about it earlier, the utility of that token in theory is very, very limited. And it's purely sort of a governance thing. And we've seen, of course, that actually you might not even get the opportunity to vote for something in governance if in a back room somebody says we're not going to have a vote on token fees. So that reduces the utility even more. And yet again, like as we sort of covered, it is being emitted, but it's being emitted only through team and through early investors. And that's sort of growing and inflating the supply.
00:31:15.056 - 00:32:34.632, Speaker C: So despite this, you know, people believe in holding the Uni token and using it even though its utility is very limited and it is sort of actively being emitted. I think the utility case for Arrow is tremendous because it does two things very, very effectively, which is it controls the distribution of emissions and there are protocols who are Very interested in controlling the distribution of emissions. That is a way for them to keep their pools and liquidities sustained. So that's already more utility than you get on, on Uniswap because you can't direct the, you know, Uniswap unlocks away from team or investors. So that's already pretty cool. But then yes, this idea that it is 100% of the revenue that the protocol generates is a reward for you if you are actively participating in that each week. And that's like a much higher value proposition than you get with, you know, probably 90% of the tokens that you see out there in the landscape, all of which have some form of emissions, some form of inflation, but don't have that same sort of utility.
00:32:34.632 - 00:32:58.324, Speaker C: And so, you know, I think when people are locking, they're probably thinking about the fact that, you know, that base and L2s are going to grow tremendously and they're going to be able to participate over time. And that the amount of fees being generated today might tell you very little about the amount of fees that are being generated like over the next year or so.
00:32:58.412 - 00:33:01.700, Speaker A: Because like it's still a bit hard.
00:33:01.740 - 00:33:35.370, Speaker B: To understand where the long term value comes from. If it's your. The value comes from blocking tokens to decide where the token will, will be directed. Right, but, but at some point does like the, like trading, like trading volume or fees or like the economic activity being generated on the protocol, like at what point does that go back to the token in any way?
00:33:37.190 - 00:34:30.414, Speaker C: It's all going to token. So I mean, so each, each week when people are voting. So let's say this week there's $4 million in revenue that the protocols accrued through fees and incentives. 100% of that revenue is distributed this week and it's Wednesday right now. So you know, this is just about to happen as the epoch flips here. But 100% of that is going to be distributed to token holders or sorry, not holders, but voters today based on their votes. And if you, it's, it's very cool because if you look at the charts of revenue year to date across the Dex landscape, you know, the amount of revenue that Aerodrome has generated is basically 2x the rest of the Dex landscape combined.
00:34:30.414 - 00:35:13.582, Speaker C: And that's with Aerodrome living on just one chain base. You know, it's over 100 million in, in one year has been redistributed as voting incentives for ve arrow velo holder or for be or ve arrow voters. And you know, if you think about the fact that you Know, Uniswap, it's this constant ongoing question of will there ever be any fees flowing? And if they do eventually implement that, will they become less competitive and lose even more fees in the process? I think we're just very excited about a model that we think has actually balanced all of these needs in a very effective way.
00:35:13.686 - 00:35:17.454, Speaker A: Right, okay, get it. So it's like being the value of.
00:35:17.462 - 00:35:29.838, Speaker B: The token comes from. If you hold the token, then you get a right to vote and receive part of this revenue that's flowing through the protocol.
00:35:30.014 - 00:35:44.270, Speaker C: Yeah. If you take the token, you lock it. Voting escrow. So it removes it from the sort of circulating supply. And then if you participate in the function of the protocol each week. Right. Voting to directing emissions.
00:35:44.270 - 00:35:49.610, Speaker C: Yes. Your reward, your incentive for doing that is 100% of the revenue generated.
00:35:49.770 - 00:35:51.498, Speaker A: How long is the lockup for?
00:35:51.634 - 00:36:16.718, Speaker C: It's, you can lock it anything between, you know, zero, one day and four years. But it's, it's a curve. Right. So the less time you lock, the less voting power you have. So I think like 89% or something like that of all token locks are, are for four years. Vast majority is for. For four years.
00:36:16.718 - 00:37:07.126, Speaker C: So generally speaking, you know, we, we think about the supply that is locked as being functionally burned because most people will perpetually keep those tokens maximally locked because their interest is not in having those tokens unlock one day. Their interest is in participation and earning rewards. And another cool innovation, you know, as part of the system is that the locked positions are in NFTs. So if you are a voter and you say, hey, I'm not really interested in doing this anymore, I would like to get rid of my locked position. You can actually just trade it, right. You can go to an NFT marketplace, list it, and somebody can come buy that. You don't need to go to a liquid locker like Convex to do that.
00:37:07.126 - 00:37:10.502, Speaker C: It's kind of all built right into the core system.
00:37:10.686 - 00:37:14.966, Speaker E: Hey, everyone, I'm Ilya and I'm inviting everyone to Bangkok November 9th to 11th.
00:37:15.078 - 00:37:37.112, Speaker F: You've been duped into thinking anything decentralized was ever going to work. There's a better way. Stop wasting your time with all this blockchain and go back to the norm, get a latte and stop trying to change the world. Oh, and this thing in November redacted the hackathon. They're cushing office jobs out there. You know, everything is working as it.
00:37:37.136 - 00:37:48.590, Speaker E: Should for our special event. Redacted. We're going to dive into AI. We're going to dive into web3 chain abstraction, decentralization and user owner AI. I'll see you there.
00:37:52.170 - 00:38:30.732, Speaker A: Yeah, and actually those revenue charges, I wanted to ask about that. So yeah, it's been really remarkable to see just the revenue growth for Aerodrome recently. Yeah, year to date it's over 100 million compared with about 50 million for Uniswap. And that's the most revenue generated out of any DAPP anywhere. And yeah, this is, I mean for project that or like protocol launched last year. Yeah, yeah. So pretty.
00:38:30.732 - 00:38:32.280, Speaker A: I mean crazy growth.
00:38:33.300 - 00:38:53.850, Speaker B: But I mean what explains what do you think is explaining that or driving that? Is it partly because your revenue model is different? Like we've discussed, like it's taking into account incentives plus trading fees. So maybe it's not so apples to apples with others.
00:38:54.310 - 00:40:02.238, Speaker C: Yeah, you can, you can certainly compete, compare, you know, just fees if you want. But if you're a Dex that only has the ability to tap into fees and you don't give the option of protocols directly incentivizing, I think you're just missing a revenue stream. You just have something less competitive because fees and incentives work the exact same way. And it would be apples to apples on curve. But you'd have to look at incentives also going to vote lock convex, which is a whole nother token which then you'd have to like factor in into the consideration. So like when I think about it, it's a few things. I mean one is of course just this bet on you can create a really well balanced model if you just redirect 100% of the value generated by the protocol back to the token to participants as incentives.
00:40:02.238 - 00:40:58.248, Speaker C: And a lot of people have tried different combinations of this. And I think anytime you start to hedge on it, curve giving like 50% to LPs, 50% to the token, it just does not work as well because then you're left with a situation where LPs are earning 50% and the curve token isn't being emitted enough to cover that delta and liquidity providers end up going somewhere else. So one aspect of it is certainly that bet on. Let's just gen. Let's just throw all the revenue at the core economic engine, which is the voters and incentivizing them, incentivizing people to come lock their tokens. I think another aspect of it has been the unbelievable volume dominance. You know, when I checked yesterday, Aerodrome was now the third highest volume Dex in all of Defi.
00:40:58.248 - 00:41:53.676, Speaker C: So the fact that it is now generating more volume on wrapped eth USDC than Uniswap is on Mainnet Ethereum. That's a lot of fees that it's generating. The fact that it's generating more volume most days on ETH than Coinbase Exchange, that's a ton of volume and that's creating a ton of fees that are feeding back into the system. And I think what you're increasingly seeing is that basis becoming kind of the default place where people are trading the core pairs of Ethereum. And I think that's only going to become more and more realized in the coming months. We now have representations of like Solana on base, the Coinbase team is going to be rolling out cb, BTC on base, Circle rolled out eurc. Right.
00:41:53.676 - 00:42:34.500, Speaker C: And we now see base and Airdrome offering better rates and better execution than the best consumer products in foreign currency exchange. Right. And so it starts to get like very exciting that you know, base is going to be the place where all of this sort of stuff is traded, whether it's on chain assets or stablecoins or things like that. And hopefully aerodrome will be able to serve as the rails of all of that activity and all of that activity and the value produces will be recirculated through the system as incentives and rewards.
00:42:37.080 - 00:42:44.864, Speaker A: Do you foresee incentives always being a key part of the protocol or I.
00:42:44.872 - 00:43:02.960, Speaker B: Don'T know, down the line when defi matures, maybe new projects or maybe fewer number of pairs will need to bootstrap via incentives or I don't know, maybe it's always going to be a key part of it.
00:43:03.260 - 00:44:15.410, Speaker C: I think it will always be a key part of it mainly just because I think base is going to continue to grow exponentially and any new project that is launching on base is going to be setting aside some percentage of their token supply to liquidity incentives. Right? To bootstrapping, to growing. Because liquidity is a necessary condition for their protocol to launch and to be successful. And so yeah, I think it will always be a part of the the system. It's a way in which they can get access. We've also seen teams basically pull it out of like marketing budgets too because there is a very palpable like marketing effect to you know, seeing some sort of crazy eye popping APR on your pool on the main exchange of like something like the base ecosystem. So I mean over time what we've seen is fees have certainly grown, right, and taken an even larger share of the total rewards and we'd expect that to happen.
00:44:15.410 - 00:44:46.590, Speaker C: But incentives are a really nice balancing element to that because even in moments of like low volatility or low volume, there's still a ton of economic stimulus because those projects can't just turn off their liquidity right when it's a low volume time, so that those rewards, that value is still flowing into the system. Whereas if you're a uni lp, right, and it's a low volume day, you're going to be eating a permanent loss for very little return.
00:44:48.890 - 00:44:50.670, Speaker A: Super interesting. And.
00:44:52.970 - 00:46:04.380, Speaker B: Just like your bet that base will be, will continue growing exponentially. So base has become one of the biggest Ethereum layer 2s. Coinbase is the biggest exchange in the US USDC, which is issued in a, you know, by Circle, where Coinbase is also involved, is the biggest or like second biggest stablecoin. So we've slowly seen Coinbase just kind of dominate crypto and you know, it goes against the very principle of this industry, which is to be decentralized and censorship resistant and permissionless and all of that. So what's your take there? I mean, building on base. Yeah. How, what if, you know, everything just continues to consolidate around Coinbase and just like crypto ends up being just like Coinbase being a mega corporation.
00:46:04.880 - 00:47:09.224, Speaker C: Sure, yeah. I mean, I think about it a few ways. One is of course that like, you know, it's been a part of Coinbase's, I think, master plan from the very early days, right, to bring their business on chain. They don't want to just be like a Web2 company that services, you know, the assets that Blockchain produces. They, they want to fully live and embrace the ethos. But if you think about that being their plan, there was a lot of different ways they could have gone about it. And you know, I've heard from folks that they explored all these avenues, right? But they could have developed their own chain, they could have developed their own proprietary chain, they could have deployed it as an alternate layer one, they could have thrown the same amount of like muscle at it as they have on, on base.
00:47:09.224 - 00:48:52.964, Speaker C: And they probably could have been like very successful in doing so. But I think it's very, very interesting that they chose instead to build a, on Etherium that they believe in the mission of Ethereum, that they believe that it will be the foundation for this broader shift in, in, you know, how, how people work and operate, you know, really societal level shift. And not only did they decide to build on Ethereum, but they could have built a custom L2 stack, but they chose not to do that. They chose to work with optimism, use the op stack and participate in the broader superchain, which means their dev teams are working incredibly closely with the op labs dev teams on protocol upgrades. They're redirecting a portion of their sequencer revenue to Optimism to have it fund public goods across the broader superchain. And so like, when I think about Coinbase, I, I don't worry so much about like, you know, what if it all consolidates that Coinbase around or consolidates all around Coinbase. I am just so excited that the one like one of, if not the best consumer crypto companies in Coinbase, you know, a publicly traded Fortune 500 company in Coinbase, decided to place their bet on Ethereum and on Optimism and the broader super chain versus going it alone.
00:48:52.964 - 00:49:54.482, Speaker C: And like, I really do believe that these are like principles to their core and that they believe that through this work that they're going to grow the pie sufficiently that, that everyone benefits. Because I think all of these additional payments, Rails, Stablecoins, real world assets, all this sort of stuff, it's going to be so substantial that they see themselves as winning if the rest of the industry wins and they won't need to take it all. But that's what I'm very excited about. And you've actually seen another major corporation now follow their lead in Sony. Sony likewise has decided not to build their own chain, not to sort of go it alone, but to build on Ethereum and to build with optimism as part of the superchain. And I think that is very exciting. Far more than like, you know, Coinbase dominating everything.
00:49:54.482 - 00:50:18.600, Speaker C: I see the superchain dominating everything and I see a lot of other people at Coinbase level scale like Sony and others being a part of this broader network of, of chains. So, you know, my bet would be more that increasingly the super chain is kind of canonical Ethereum for most, most users. Most builders, they don't necessarily go, go to L1s anymore.
00:50:19.580 - 00:50:55.690, Speaker A: No, that's a great point and a really encouraging sign that Coinbase did decide to go on chain in this way, you know, building with others rather than doing it alone. But as we wrap up, I want to get a chance to still talk about how, you know, as you mentioned, so much activity is going to L2s. But you know, so far this year.
00:50:56.480 - 00:51:36.510, Speaker B: That appears to be at a detriment to Ethereum. Layer 1 and to ETH. Layer 2s have become so efficient and blobs have made them even more efficient and just like the need to go back to layer one has become, has declined and obviously that's reflected in eth price. How do you see all this playing out? Is it Just temporary down the line. Just like we should expect L2 activity to increase so much that it'll gradually just like trickle down to Ethereum or. What's your take?
00:51:37.210 - 00:52:17.696, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean I think that more or less is my take. Like I think we're in the messy middle right now. Like we knew that Ethereum as a monolith, that blockchain would not scale. We knew that, you know, folks like Sony, folks like Coinbase couldn't bring products, consumer level products, innovative stuff and build it on L1, Ethereum. So we needed an answer for that. And that answer was L2S. And now we're in this messy moment where yes, we've made them unbelievably efficient, faster, cheaper to use, all that sort of stuff.
00:52:17.696 - 00:53:17.632, Speaker C: And yes, we're worried about the amount of value that is flowing back to BL1 and all of that sort of stuff. But I see it as another skating to where the puck is going. Because if the vision is truly we're going to build this entirely new on chain economy and we're going to have the biggest businesses in the world building on chain. We're going to see like, for like forex trading on chain. We're going to see payment infrastructure on chain that is such an order of magnitude increase in activity and we need like the ability for folks who want to build those products to build these cheap, fast L2s to do it. And, and I think we're just starting to see the early signs of it, of it happening. But yes, we're building for massive scale like and it's going to be messy in the middle here.
00:53:17.632 - 00:54:17.794, Speaker C: But yeah, I think that's the vision because if we don't get to that state then what are we even doing here? Right? And fretting too much about the economics of Ethereum as we're beginning to bring some of the biggest players in industry on chain is I think maybe just a bit short sighted. But you know, I know people are very, very smart and intelligent here. I believe the broader community will figure out how to balance these trade offs. But I think for those of us like on the app and L2 side, like our goal is just to grow and scale as quickly as possible. You know, if we've now got better foreign exchange infrastructure today than what the best consumer level apps that have had billions invested in them have the largest banks and organizations behind them. If we're already beating them, then it's just a matter of more and more infrastructure. It's about more and more places accepting eurc.
00:54:17.794 - 00:54:46.108, Speaker C: It's about tap to pay and then we're bringing so much transaction activity on chain that none of this will really matter. So that's the goal. That's what we need to get to. I think it's the messy middle. But I'm just very happy that we're starting to see the early signals of like, hey, we've got real problems we're solving, we've got real businesses coming on chain. It's when the world comes on chain that all of this will be like an afterthought, just be that messy middle moment.
00:54:46.284 - 00:55:46.330, Speaker B: Yeah, totally agree. And I do want to end with what those use cases will be that, that you think will bring more and more activity on chain. What's next for Dexa's. But before just, just quickly interested in spending a bit more time on eth and just, you know, because I've seen a lot of discussion lately on where, where the eth, the value of ETH comes from, if it's not from MEV is going to zero and gas fees are going to zero and there's like this race to the bottom. So you know, what happens to kind of Ethereum's native currency and then, you know, there's just like different views of where it goes, you know, going forward. And for you, kind of at the core of this ecosystem, just wondering what your thoughts are there.
00:55:47.030 - 00:57:32.628, Speaker C: Yeah, you know, I saw a tweet yesterday that was of course getting like actively dunked on, which was like the, you know, let's look at a theory and as a business, right? And let's look at its revenue versus issuance and you know, in the context of the ETFs, like who would ever buy this, this business, right, if it was putting up this sort of price to earnings. And I'm actually glad that, you know, that's being brought as a frame because I think it is a frame that is sometimes applied to, you know, projects, protocols, dapps as well. But these fundamentally just aren't businesses, so they're not the best way to think about it. And you know, I, as far as like the future role of Ethereum, in the end, I think if we do continue to scale the amount of activity substantially, the core economics will improve. But it's also just a useful and necessary thing. And if it is the asset that is basically underwriting the security of a new like sort of decentralized, a better Internet, then there'll be no question that it will be valued and useful. And that's very different than a stock, right? A stock isn't a piece of infrastructure, it isn't useful, it doesn't do anything beyond give you a percentage of equity within a business and certain shareholder rights and all that sort of fun stuff.
00:57:32.628 - 00:58:07.580, Speaker C: So I just don't think we can apply apply to tokens generally traditional business sort of metrics or understanding. Certainly there's going to be economic considerations, but the utility considerations are prime. And yes to me again it just comes down to will this future Internet be built on eth? And if it's going to be built on eth, then I think this stuff is going to work itself out. If it isn't, then I mean it doesn't matter that all this got vamped away or things got cheap or whatever, it was going to die anyways.
00:58:09.200 - 00:58:17.240, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a great point. Okay. And then yeah, just looking at what.
00:58:17.280 - 00:58:43.060, Speaker B: Will drive all this activity to Ethereum and Ethereum Layer two, what's coming up in the very near term, where do you see activity flowing in the coming months and then just looking longer term, what role do you, do you see Dexs will have just like in broader finance?
00:58:43.400 - 01:00:06.304, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean as, as more asset types come on chain. Right. Whether we're talking about like foreign exchange, whether we're talking about sort of core crypto assets, like, like bitcoin, real world assets, all that sort of stuff, AMMs already just provide a better experience, better execution than what traditional markets offer. And so like I'm just very excited about the potential for us to basically by virtue of having pulled all the intermediaries out of these systems, having all of the value recirculate through to participants, building better products. And so in the short term, you know, I definitely think foreign exchange is a major thing and I know it's a major thing that Circle is focused on and the Coinbase team is focused on and I think actually Sony getting involved is super interesting as well given the role of the yen in global finance. And I think even if you just saw more currencies, foreign currencies available on chain, it could mean an exponential like increase in activity and the infrastructure that could support much better consumer level products.
01:00:06.304 - 01:01:30.624, Speaker C: But then beyond that like Sony is so interesting because they're fundamentally an IP company and they're an IP company that like any IP company has just been squeezed by all intermediaries between their IP and those people interacting with their ip. And I think they very much see blockchain not as like an experiment, not as something just to play around with, but this is how we, this is how we fix a major issue within our business. Right. By being able to pull the intermediaries out of that. And that's the sort of stuff I feel like those of us who got excited about web3 got excited about. Blockchains have always been so excited about, which is, you know, how does this solve real problems? How does this connect people together, share the value in new and interesting ways? And so I think for me right now, between base and this sort of foreign exchange and Sony and the ip, we're about to see some incredibly cool stuff on chain, on Ethereum, on optimism, on the super chain. And so those are all the things that make me feel like we're building in the right place, because a Dex fundamentally is just infrastructure for all the rest of this stuff.
01:01:30.624 - 01:01:39.730, Speaker C: A Dex benefits, the larger the pie grows. And so we're just here to help facilitate the rest of this.
01:01:40.590 - 01:01:41.174, Speaker B: Awesome.
01:01:41.222 - 01:01:44.530, Speaker A: And then just very quickly, you said.
01:01:46.430 - 01:02:05.178, Speaker B: If the next phase of the Internet is built on Ethereum, then everything will work itself out. Maybe an obvious question, but just to hear you say it, you're definitely. You're betting that that will be the case.
01:02:05.314 - 01:03:00.542, Speaker C: I mean, I think we're betting on that being the case until we see a convincing argument for why there will be a significant amount of activity that happens somewhere else. It's not to say that, you know, there will only be one blockchain in the world. Right. And it'll be Ethereum and all of its scaling solutions, but that the majority of the activity may happen on Ethereum and that if there is going to be, you know, sort of alternate chains, that they're going to have maybe their own very sort of specific slices of things. And for us to, like, shift our bet and say we'd have to, let's go spend our time over there, we'd have to see, like, the. The potential of that being greater than what we see right now with Ethereum, optimism and the superchain.
01:03:00.686 - 01:03:01.214, Speaker B: Awesome.
01:03:01.262 - 01:03:11.966, Speaker A: Well, so far, like I said earlier, you've done a great job at knowing where the puck is going. So it's been a pleasure having you on the podcast. Thank you so much for joining me.
01:03:12.118 - 01:03:13.370, Speaker C: Thank you so much.
01:03:21.950 - 01:03:22.190, Speaker A: Sa.
