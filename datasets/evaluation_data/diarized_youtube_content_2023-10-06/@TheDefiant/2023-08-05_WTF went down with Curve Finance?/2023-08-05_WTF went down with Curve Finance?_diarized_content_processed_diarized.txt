00:00:23.370 - 00:00:58.894, Speaker A: To this week's weekly recap with the Defiant. It's been a very tumultuous past couple of days, few days with DeFi and we have a really amazing guest here to talk us through what's happening. First, I'll introduce the defiant side. So I'm Cami, the founder. We have Jeremy and Owen stuff. We reporters here at the Defiant. And our guests for today are Julian Buteloupe, probably pronouncing your last name wrong.
00:00:58.894 - 00:01:47.360, Speaker A: I'm so sorry, Julian at CEO of State Capital, core investor and advisor at Curve. And we have DeFi Dave, longtime friend of the Defiant, core advocate for fracs. So, guys, let's get right to it. What's happening with Curve has really sent ripples all throughout DeFi. Just a bit of quick background. Michael Egrov, Curve founder, has huge loans outstanding backed by CRV on different lending protocols in Defi. Ave, Frax, abracadabra are a few of them.
00:01:47.360 - 00:03:03.310, Speaker A: These positions have been well known, but what happened is that last weekend curve suffered an exploit which sent the price of CRV down, jeopardizing or putting a higher risk of liquidation on the loans that Michael has taken out. That's been compounded by rising interest rates as it's been kind of this snowball effect where people are nervous about what happened. So they're taking out liquidity from defi protocols at spiking rates. And so it's a very kind of unstable situation, it feels like. So with that, let's just see where the state of play is at. Where are we at with the situation? Like, what's the risk right now? What are you guys seeing? Are things stabilized? Yeah, I don't know if either Julianne or want to jump in.
00:03:03.400 - 00:03:05.526, Speaker B: I'll jump in here. Can you guys hear me?
00:03:05.628 - 00:03:05.906, Speaker A: Yep.
00:03:05.938 - 00:03:51.846, Speaker B: Yeah, perfect. Yeah, I think things are definitely stabilizing. We're not out of the woods yet, but I think you guys saw earlier the hackers started returning funds. The only thing right now is Michael does have lending positions open, but it seems like he does have those under control. He's continuing to do OTC deals for his CRV, which I find quite interesting because you're seeing CRV being distributed as well as locked, more so right now than it has been in the past 18 months. And I think one of the biggest lessons we can take from this incident is how much incentives really matter. And I mean this, from the beginning of the hack all the way up to the lending protocols being paid off.
00:03:51.846 - 00:04:41.666, Speaker B: So with the hack, it wasn't technically a curve exploit it was actually an exploit in the compiler of the Viper code, which is basically this compiler. I think of it as like a magic machine that turns human code into machine readable text. No one looked to check if anything was buggy there, because VCs, white hacks, they don't really have an incentive to. But because of the bear market, things drying up for hackers in 2021, it was like open season. It was very easy to get like a nine figure hack, but now, when things were drying up, you had to have black hat. Hackers had to look deeper into the stack, which led them to looking into the programming language itself. Viper is a lot easier to read to solidity, so it's a lot easier to pick up on these exploits.
00:04:41.666 - 00:05:12.590, Speaker B: And the exploit was around. In 2021, it was miraculously patched, but people didn't even realize it. And from what I've been told, there was actually like a transfer of people working on Viper around that time. And it seems like something was missed. That's what a curve cap told me. And so something was missed, it wasn't picked up. And now we had this situation where it was hacked and it just reverberated up the stack.
00:05:14.310 - 00:05:27.474, Speaker A: I mean, it's pretty scary to think that you now not only have to worry about the protocol code being airtight, but also the language in which it's written.
00:05:27.522 - 00:05:55.600, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like something that needs to be figured out is how do we incentivize people to audit that level of compiler right now? Last year, Curve passed the gauge that actually funds the Viper team, so it's not like things have been funded before in a public goods manner. I wonder what else could be done? Like maybe Viper protocols, protocols that use Viper can band together, know, fund more audits at that level.
00:05:57.490 - 00:06:22.390, Speaker A: Julian, throwing the question at you now, how do you think we are in terms of, are things stabilizing? Or is there still risk that CRV price will suddenly drop? I mean, is there enough demand for CRV to keep the price above liquidation levels?
00:06:23.370 - 00:06:38.540, Speaker C: Well, I think if you ask me the question a few days ago, it would be a different answer than what the current situation is. Give me just a quick second.
00:06:40.590 - 00:06:42.540, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's also about.
00:06:47.490 - 00:07:58.760, Speaker C: What have been happening. And I'm sure you saw on the news that Michael has been doing a couple of OTC trade with some of the biggest builders and also some influencers in the space, in exchange of a locking period of the CRV, which basically allow him to reimburse his liquidation, his position on aven a couple of the platforms such as fracs, making the situation more stable and safer. So yes, the appetite for people to short the CRV is less bigger, I would say. So it's more costly to short CRV at the moment, because we are more far away from the liquidation ratio. That was a couple of days ago. The hacker still has a good portion of CRV, but we have more liquidity on the market. Trading volume is pretty high.
00:07:58.760 - 00:08:06.630, Speaker C: So I don't think today it's better than a few days ago. If I can add a recap.
00:08:11.950 - 00:08:31.390, Speaker A: These OTC deals that are happening with players like OGs, influencers and funds in the space, what's your kind of involvement? If you can say, are you involved in one of these deals?
00:08:32.470 - 00:09:24.142, Speaker C: No, I think Michael is the main person responsible for doing those OTC. I've facilitated a couple of them, such as stagdao and other one, but that's it. Michael is the only person that make decision over those OTC trade, and I think this is normal. He's the one that currently having one of the biggest position in the curve ecosystem, and especially on Ave, which Ave is one of the biggest DeFi projects. So the systematic risk was there, and today, less than a couple of days ago. But yeah, it's the one handling those OTC trades.
00:09:24.286 - 00:09:39.858, Speaker A: Right. So, staked out has a position in CRV. Right. So I guess my question was, are you guys buying more of it now from Michael?
00:09:39.954 - 00:10:28.980, Speaker C: Yes, we've always been buying. I mean, originally I built staked out to have a position in the curve walls in CRV position. That's where we built the liquid lockers. And at the moment, the liquid locker are the best way to lock those CRV, because we have the safest peg on the market. So one of the core business model of stackdao is to have a position in curve, because then we can boost and incentivize the different strategies. But we also have exposition to balancer, to Frax and other big DeFi projects. And also balancer was used during this.
00:10:28.980 - 00:10:49.770, Speaker C: So we are running the business on top of curve. So it makes sense that we acquire, and in one way or another, it's direct purchase from the treasury or directly by people depositing inside the locker and minting those liquid position of the CRV.
00:10:50.690 - 00:10:56.750, Speaker A: Are people participating in these OTC deals required to lock up CRV?
00:10:57.250 - 00:10:58.542, Speaker C: Yes, correct.
00:10:58.676 - 00:11:00.000, Speaker A: Yeah, makes sense.
00:11:04.230 - 00:11:48.670, Speaker D: As ve CRV, I saw there was a variety of people did a variety of things, if I remember correctly. I know that winter mute, which did no TC deal yesterday they deposited in. See, from my understanding of what I'm seeing on Etherscan, it doesn't seem like the rules are hardened fast. Is it like a handshake thing or does each OTC deal have its own terms of what you have to do? I know big Brother Mackie, he deposited in becrv. So yeah, I'm just think I cannot.
00:11:49.490 - 00:12:52.900, Speaker C: Talk for Michael, but I think the incentive to the agreement to lock into at least and more importantly into VCRV is pretty high because VCRV is not liquid on market. So it's better to lock in VCRV. But if you are a builder such as stackdow yearn, convex frax and all the other people, I would say that the reputation is above the fact of selling the CRV liquid position on the market. So informal agreement, gentlemen, agreement is probably safe in the sense because curve is also the one incentivizing those protocol to. For example in techdao we have VOT market to incentivize those different strategy to continue through the inflation of the protocol. So going against the protocol will probably be seen and same as just shooting ourselves in the foot.
00:12:56.070 - 00:13:34.642, Speaker A: David, for Fracs, one of many protocols who would be impacted obviously, if there was a liquidation. By the way, before I go on with a question, I need to do a shout out to our awesome sponsor bumper. Defend your crypto from market crashes and downside volatility. So check them out. It helps them, it helps us at the defiant as well when you click on their links. So yeah, go ahead and check out bumper. All right.
00:13:34.642 - 00:14:13.382, Speaker A: So Dave, what I was getting at is there's a huge contagion risk and it's a property of Defi how things are so interconnected fracs right now, if you can just give an overview of what kind of the health of these positions are looking like in fracs and what actions has the protocol taken, if any, to remedy this or make things safer?
00:14:13.526 - 00:14:57.466, Speaker B: Well, I just want to reiterate that the FRacs protocol was not at risk at all during this situation. It was its positions in curve that were at risk. And at the beginning of this whole ordeal, when risk was apparent, Fracs pulled its protocol owned liquidity from the Frax base pool, from Frax 30 CRV and from the Frac teeth ETH pool as a precaution because they just had to. And then they monitored the situation really closely. Fracs and curve are obviously super connected. I consider curve to be the mincing redeeming facility for the frac stablecoin for Fracseeth. People look at it as an amm I'm like, no, you can actually mint and redeem fracs from curve, the protocol itself.
00:14:57.466 - 00:15:31.910, Speaker B: So it's vital infrastructure. So Frax was there in the war room, all hands on deck, helping wherever they could. What's really interesting was how this whole ordeal reverberated up the stack. On the smart contract level, you had black hats versus white hacks trying to recover funds or extract funds. And then at the market level, you had Michael trying to pay back his loans. And he actually prioritized Fraxland first. Based on the way Fraxland was actually designed and how its mechanisms were constructed.
00:15:31.910 - 00:15:57.294, Speaker B: I consider Fraxland, it was built as an extension of Frax, and it had those parameters for the benefit, to increase the market share and utility of Frax. And that's why it was designed a certain way. And so we had the utilization rate go to 100%, and it would double every 12 hours. That basically calls Michael to prioritize Fraxland first, above everyone else would like the.
00:15:57.332 - 00:15:59.098, Speaker A: Interest rate just spike.
00:15:59.194 - 00:16:23.330, Speaker B: It would spike, exactly. Yeah. It was a really novel, unique design. So the way Fraxland is designed, it's siloed, isolated pools. So none of the risk would be to any of the other pools. It would just be those who lended in the Frax CRV pool that was affected. And what I found really fascinating about this whole thing was how Michael built his way out of it, combined with the OTC deals.
00:16:23.330 - 00:16:39.500, Speaker B: So you actually saw Michael create a gauge for a CRV USD and frax pair. So it was a secondary debt market for the Fracs debt, which was the first of its kind, which was really cool.
00:16:39.890 - 00:16:41.902, Speaker A: Can you explain how that works?
00:16:42.036 - 00:17:26.970, Speaker B: Yeah. So you get a receipt token when you deposit fracs in the Frac CRV lending pair, and you basically pair that token to CRV USD, and it creates a second. So the whole point of it was to incentivize people to deposit their fracs into the Frac CRV, earning that native yield, however risky, and then depositing that again in the curve gauge and earning CRV emissions as well. And I would expect to see that kind of mechanic. It was brand new, and I would expect to see these kind of secondary debt markets pop up again in the future. That's something that was discussed in the Fracs telegram group as well. So out of necessity comes innovation, as they say.
00:17:27.120 - 00:17:39.962, Speaker E: Now, as Egorov is kind of tending all these positions. To what extent, and anyone can answer this, by the way, to what extent are they tethered to one another in terms of contagion like, if one of them defaults, does that cause another to default?
00:17:40.106 - 00:17:42.378, Speaker B: I mean, on all the lending protocols?
00:17:42.474 - 00:17:43.120, Speaker D: Yes.
00:17:43.570 - 00:17:51.570, Speaker B: I mean, depends on how everyone's liquidation process works. At the end of the day, you just don't want to be the last one holding the bag with bad debt.
00:17:53.270 - 00:18:03.506, Speaker D: Well, yeah, assuming people are going to sell the curve, if one position gets liquidated, I assume people are going to sell immediately, and I assume that's going to push it into other levels.
00:18:03.618 - 00:18:38.574, Speaker E: But if we get there, I've been watching the governance boards and some people are talking about taking the Ltd to zero, others are talking about tiering it. Obviously, the way Fraxland is set up, there is an incentive to tend those positions because of the raising interest rates. So given the aggressive stance that Egarov has taken to safeguard and underpin these loans with collateral, I don't know that it would necessarily still represent a risk for the market at whole with CRV if he continues to make the payments.
00:18:38.622 - 00:18:39.074, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:39.192 - 00:19:10.942, Speaker B: Yeah. I was on a show with curve cap yesterday on blockmates, and he's with the curve team. He's close with Michael and everyone. And he was saying how Michael has been doing on chain lending since 2018 and just has never been liquidated, has always been managing positions. And from his managing of his lending positions, that's how he thought of curve itself, that's how he thought of CRV USD. So Michael is quite experienced in this regard of managing his lending positions. And for sure he was put to the test.
00:19:10.942 - 00:19:14.862, Speaker B: But it seems like we're almost out of the woods there.
00:19:14.996 - 00:20:33.880, Speaker A: And to me, it's interesting that it's like the entire Defi community came to the know, buying up CRV over the counter to shore up the price to make sure that Michael doesn't get liquidated, I don't know, it's just like an interesting dynamic happening. It's like everyone is in it together, but at the same time, I don't know, it's kind of scary that there's also the incentive for someone to just trade the other way because things, yeah, they are stabilizing, but looking at the price, it's still a lot lower than it was before the hack. So I don't know. To me, there's still the risk out there that somebody will make a big sale of CRV, somebody who maybe has a short position there is kind of that looming still, or is that kind of ruled out?
00:20:36.810 - 00:21:34.234, Speaker C: If you look at the funded rate of shorting CRV, it's pretty expensive. So whether you have something on the side that will allow you to, for example, make a cascade of liquidation, such as on Ave. You really need to spend a lot of money in order to maintain that position in any centralized exchanges. So of course, for someone, a hedge fund or trader, still possible, you can still buy that position and try to short, and try to make sure you get close to that liquidation ratio. And that's, I think, what people were trying to do of Shane and trying to. I've seen a couple of messages that people were trying to collude together in order to make those liquidation happen. Those people are not necessarily very far away from the builders community.
00:21:34.234 - 00:22:49.060, Speaker C: And we have to understand that if any of the people that are building in Defi space fail, it's very likely that will affect one of the projects one way or another, especially if the lending market or the auto market maker get affected, such as fax curve or Ave. The magnitude of damages that can create in the defi space is pretty high. I will consider this position as the same that we've seen back then with Bitmax and Archer, when suddenly the platform was shut down because there has too many liquidation. And the reason why is the DevOps, the stack was not able to handle the stack of liquidation, which I think, for me, was shut down. And people say to save bitcoin. But in this scenario of Defi, the risk is pretty big, and what could happen with the casket of liquidation could really bring defi pretty bad mode. So of course, it was in the all interest of everyone to save that situation from the builders community and also from people involved in the Defi space, because it could have been very bad.
00:22:49.060 - 00:23:57.030, Speaker C: I'm not saying this is finished, but what Michael has been doing is fantastic to being able to reimburse this position, and also what the people in this community have been doing together to talk to each other. We have multiple different groups. We have been helping each other. We've been also reimbursing some positions, some people, just to make sure that everyone is safe while we are working towards saving the money that was stolen. And I think this is working on, and I really like the way it was phrased that to the hacker, either you give back all the money, you can keep 10%, or we'll give those 10% to anyone that can give useful information to docs, the hacker. And this was pretty powerful, because at the end, it's very likely that the person become not anonymous anymore, and any legal enforcement will be after him. So, yes, the way he reacted online, like a couple of minutes ago, it's pretty funny.
00:23:57.030 - 00:23:59.420, Speaker C: But yes, this is what it is.
00:24:00.510 - 00:24:15.550, Speaker E: I wonder with this situation, has it changed perhaps the way that lenders are going to be facilitating loans or the industry in general in terms of its architecture and in terms of general contagion and liquidation risk?
00:24:19.730 - 00:25:32.150, Speaker C: Yeah, I think starting from we've seen a lot of different liquidation events in the past and especially last year with the entire Cifi ecosystem filling Celsius and all the different FTX and different guys that pushed a lot of liquidation market, I would have thought that lending LPs would have changed the strategy of depositing asset. But what we've seen a couple of past from external consulting company that are trying to provide better sense of how to use certain assets as collateral. I think we'll see more and more rating company that will try to push off chain content into on chain mechanism. So, for example, certain assets cannot be used as collateral because it poses huge systematic risk to defi space. I think this is what will happen for sure mentality of lending.
00:25:32.650 - 00:25:38.410, Speaker A: Is there an argument that CRV shouldn't be used as collateral?
00:25:40.270 - 00:26:25.330, Speaker C: I don't think this is a rational argument. The argument of a certain limit, of being used as a character is probably a good discussion, but not being used totally as an argument. I think this is probably in the interest of certain people that don't really necessarily want to see CRV being used in the d five space. But CRV, if you look at the market cap, is a couple of billions and it's proceeding from 100 million to a couple of billions volume per day. And in term of generated rewards per week, we're also talking in a couple of million. So if you look at the price earning on this protocol, it's pretty good. So it makes complete sense to have this asset as a collateral.
00:26:25.330 - 00:26:33.500, Speaker C: And also it was the asset that created the V to economics and a lot of different protocol I built on top of.
00:26:34.430 - 00:26:40.826, Speaker B: Yes, if someone doesn't list CRV, then somebody else will, right?
00:26:40.928 - 00:26:42.414, Speaker C: Of course. Yes, of course.
00:26:42.532 - 00:26:47.920, Speaker A: I guess like having some sort of ratio would be a way forward.
00:26:48.530 - 00:27:13.350, Speaker E: You mentioned the limit, though. I wonder, are the limits that you speak of, would they encompass the current amount of CRV that's being utilized to back loans? Or would that be more than what the limits that you would recommend for future, as opposed to just no longer utilizing as collateral? Because you said that maybe limitations were something that you impose.
00:27:14.410 - 00:27:22.854, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm not sure what the name of the american group that proposed a governance on Avi.
00:27:22.982 - 00:27:24.006, Speaker D: That's Gauntlet.
00:27:24.118 - 00:28:41.138, Speaker C: Gauntlet I didn't want to mention, but I think it's interesting, of course, yes, not comment, but it's interesting how sometimes decisions are not necessarily made by rational cartesian or mathematical analysis, but also on lobbying side. And this space is a lot of 40 chess. There's a lot of different things that are happening on chain, but also off chain. So, yeah, of course there are a few different stories around curve and different things like that. So we always have to take into consideration that there are multiple different strings that are being pulled in different ways. I think it's completely rational to have certain limits compared to the availability of liquidity on market and for how long those assets are being locked. For example, we have a huge percentage of locking inside and also in liquid staking, such as staked out fax, urine and different things.
00:28:41.138 - 00:28:53.800, Speaker C: And a lot of builders. So, yes, if we consider that certain amount is being locked into the protocol for four years, it's completely rational that we can use a certain percentage as a collateral inside the lending protocol. Makes complete sense.
00:28:54.170 - 00:29:19.802, Speaker A: Yeah. At which point do you guys think that the risk is gone, that we are kind of over this episode? Is there some sort of threshold, like price threshold that you're looking at, or at which point we're out of the woods?
00:29:19.866 - 00:29:38.050, Speaker B: I don't know if I would say price threshold, but maybe when the OTC deal stopped, that's a good sign or good measurement. It's like, okay, he has everything under control after that, and then we can just see what happens from there and Defi can just continue on defying.
00:29:39.050 - 00:30:41.500, Speaker C: I think for me, it's more about you look at the funding rate for people shorting, and it's a good indicator of are we in a safe zone or not? Because if this funding rate is pretty high, it means that the interest for people to short the asset is pretty low and makes a good confidence about is the position of the situation stable. The best way to measure a betting scenario is always to look at where are the people betting at the moment? Funding rates, a lot of people got squeezed. It happened last year during this famous person said, quote, what are you going to do, call the police? And happened. He tried to attack the protocol of curve, got a squeeze and liquidated. But yeah, look always at the derivative options market, future market, to see what are the tenants and the trend in a situation.
00:30:42.670 - 00:30:51.390, Speaker A: So where's that funding rate now? And where would you consider it that there's really no appetite to short and we're out of the woods?
00:30:53.250 - 00:31:26.840, Speaker C: I haven't checked the thing, but I think people were paying like 400% a year to short CRV, which is kind of pretty high, but it can go up to 4000. It's not ridiculous. So when you ask per day something between a couple of percent net profits, then people are either paid or very penalized to shot. So that's an interesting momentum. Yeah.
00:31:30.030 - 00:32:07.682, Speaker D: What did we learn from all this? Because it does seem like there were a lot of undefi things that happened this week. I mean, these OTC deals were. I would have liked to see everyone lock up in VecRV right away or whatever. Just because there's a pre lockup contract, you could easily lock up in six months. You don't need to write any code. The OTC deals, I mean, you saw Abracadabra try to shim in a proposal in 24 hours. I don't know, are there things we can do better? Because it did feel kind of like it felt on D five.
00:32:07.682 - 00:32:19.922, Speaker D: On the flip side, I want to say fascinating to watch this happen on chain and so cool that we have so much information compared to an FTX collapse. But I don't know. We already touched on this.
00:32:20.076 - 00:32:42.560, Speaker B: I think there's a few things to take. Like one, how can we incentivize audits at the compiler level when this whole thing was happening live? You had certain auditing firms say like, hey, you might want to check this out. And it was still live and it was just like open season. How do we prevent stuff like that happening again? And it seems like shame is one way to do that.
00:32:45.410 - 00:33:01.730, Speaker E: VCs will ever be incentivized to take care of something like that. In terms of like, you're putting a lot of money behind this protocol you have succeeding. Why not create the incentive for people to ensure that the code that you're producing doesn't go through a school of hard knocks out there while everybody's money's at risk?
00:33:01.810 - 00:33:33.102, Speaker B: Although that I will say, because everything happened on chain, everything was incredibly transparent. You could see the OTC deals happen in real time. You could see everything that would be behind the scenes in tradfi was front and center. In know. It may not have been the per se, but coordination was transparent. Yeah, coordination was necessary to mitigate the situation. And I think DeFi welcomes equality of opportunity.
00:33:33.102 - 00:33:35.760, Speaker B: But that doesn't necessarily mean equality of.
00:33:38.930 - 00:33:44.450, Speaker D: I mean, I love citing ether scan as a source is very satisfying.
00:33:44.970 - 00:35:15.566, Speaker C: I think what's interesting is, for example, solidity or Viper, you have years of research, not necessarily in those languages, but before in C and very deep low level programming and the concept of formal verification, where you can prove that the compiler is actually doing what it's supposed to do, and there's no bug involved in a DeFi space. What we learned, and remember a couple of years ago, it seems very far away now, but flash loan people were saying, okay, we need to stop flash loan because they are dangerous, and because people have access to limited amount of money, and they shouldn't actually have access to limited amount of money. But guess what? The community and the builders will find a way to build better DeFi. So Flashbone was actually built in a way that they brought the space in a better place, because it's made possible certain type of attacks that will normally require centralized entities to be able to play, but they have no way to play because they have no knowledge of the space. So it will just take and shift those type of attack to in ten years in a time frame. Today I think we need to not acknowledge or understand that those type of compiler errors can happen. So we need to build code in such a way that can prevent us if something happens, at least we minimize the risk.
00:35:15.566 - 00:36:12.994, Speaker C: In security there is the concept of you never actually safe. What you need to do as security is just to minimize the exposure to the risk and your appetite to the risk, how strong you are to buy the risk. It's the same type of thing in trading and anything type of things, I think in defi space. And when we write code, we need to understand also the concept of quantitative trading, how far you are to be able to expose yourself to the risk. And then we can build those type of mechanism that if something happened on compiler level, it doesn't necessarily will stop everything, but will prevent from having the entire protocol exposed to the risk. For example, what Dave mentioned on fax, you have fax land, those pool are isolated between each other, so if something happened, you can shut down, you can prevent them in balancer, they share the neutral state across different pools, so the vulnerability could be actually higher. So those type of things, they will come.
00:36:12.994 - 00:36:58.226, Speaker C: And those moments are better to happen today than later, because if we grow up the space now we're talking about a couple of billions, or two trillions, or 1.2 trillion, depends on the day and you wake up, but it's better today than later. And the way that we can build better system is that we learn from those mistakes, and one at the compiler level. It happened before, not in this place of blockchain or defi, but in security, defense and different type of attacks on a compiler level. So it's not new and it can happen, it's just a matter, as Dave mentioned, doing proper audits on a compiler. But even if we do the maximum, and if you look at rec news dashboard, you will see that a lot of those different products that got audited are still on the top of the leaderboard. So it's not because you are fully audited that the risk is not there.
00:36:58.226 - 00:37:20.620, Speaker C: It's just like you try to minimize the risk and you try to sense how much you can get exposed to the risk yourself. For example, insurance. I think insurance have a big role to play in the space. For now, it's really difficult because people are not incentivized correctly. The yield is not very good in the insurance protocol, but outside insurance, we'll be able to provide safety net.
00:37:20.990 - 00:37:53.170, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we hear like, we're early, but we really are early. And we're still in this beta test of sorts. And if you're on chain right now, you're pretty much a guinea pig. And so you have to be aware of the risk. But everything's being battle tested right now for when the big time comes, when hundreds of billions and trillions of dollars of TVL. You want to get out all the kinks, you want to get out all the exploits at all different levels, whether economic or at a code level, here and now, before real big money comes on chain.
00:37:54.550 - 00:37:56.440, Speaker D: Go, Cammy, go. You got it.
00:37:57.610 - 00:38:37.534, Speaker A: No. Just wanted to ask you guys, what are you hoping gets built in the next few months, either to prevent this sort of attack or just to make defi safer as a whole, or just things that you think are missing. But before you answer, we need to take a look at a short clip from bumper. So it'll give you a bit of time to think as well. So, yes, we should see the clip.
00:38:37.582 - 00:39:16.286, Speaker D: Now, building on Cammy's question, I'm curious. There are things that happen at the security level, but given that some degree of hacks is inevitable, just like a level up of abstraction, we kind of touched on this already. I think Fraxlend proved itself as a solid mechanism here in that they didn't have to scramble. But other things that, I don't know. I don't know, maybe it's fine that there's like. I mean, I was just, like, astounded at the magnitude of Michael's lending positions. I'd covered it before, but I was.
00:39:16.308 - 00:39:16.960, Speaker A: Just like.
00:39:18.850 - 00:39:20.720, Speaker D: That'S a lot of money, my man.
00:39:22.530 - 00:39:25.330, Speaker A: Okay, now we're ready for the clip. Sorry about that.
00:39:25.480 - 00:39:54.650, Speaker F: So here's something new, bumper. Your assets to defend them from price drops without losing upside exposure, you set a price, floor and term length, then lock your tokens into the protocol. When your term ends, if the price has fallen under your floor, you leave with stablecoins at the floor's value. Otherwise you just take back your original asset. Bumper is going live in August, and it's one of the most innovative defi protocols for hedging being built right now. So check out bumper Phi, there's links in the description of this video.
00:39:54.720 - 00:39:55.980, Speaker C: Now back to our story.
00:39:56.590 - 00:40:07.470, Speaker A: Okay, now we're back. All right. Yeah, we are so back. What do you guys think? What are you hoping gets built in Defi?
00:40:10.450 - 00:41:38.458, Speaker C: Well, I think an interesting aspect of what happened during this hack, and we've seen it before, is for example like MeV type of exploit or hack, what happened is the hacker got front run by one of cafe bots. And that's interesting because if you think about it, if you have a sophisticated infrastructure and you have different way of protecting yourself, of course you can do audits, you can also add different type of RPC endpoint for people. So if the transaction is not correctly using a defined and whitelisted smart contract, then you don't actually allow the transaction. You can monitor, you can revert and all different type of things, that a lot of different agency and companies are building those type of things. But you can also, like on the trading side, you can also, if you have sophisticated mechanism in place, layer of protection, try to always arbitrage and front rent those type of attack. And that's what usually happened in the white hack, when we create those groups is trying to monitor an attack, we see that something is happening, because when you request a couple of million loan on balancer or whatever platform, lending platform Aave or Faxnet, then it's for doing something, it's not just to watch TV. So what you can do is just to try to understand what's happening.
00:41:38.458 - 00:42:14.978, Speaker C: Of course it goes super fast, and to be able to decompile and understand the transaction is quite difficult. But if there's profits in place, you can always try to frontrain, arbitrage or strand, which attack the attack. And those type of things are very interesting, they are sophisticated, but they also layer of protection that we can use as white hacker to be able to protect some of the biggest DeFi protocol, some of the ones that are today one of the biggest pillars of this ecosystem, to guarantee that DeFi doesn't fail, because if it fails by the compiler error, how can we tell people from outside of the space to use the protocols?
00:42:15.074 - 00:42:52.946, Speaker B: It's difficult yeah, exactly. I echo Julian's sentiment as well. I think there should be certain protocols and procedures for white hat operations. I think things, if you read Robert Chen's post from Ottersec, he goes timeline like minute by minute, what happened block by block. It seems like there was a lot of different groups working on different things at once and there was a little bit of chaos and this here and that. So I wonder how we can improve the war room. You know, on top of what Julian recommended, you also recommended you talked about insurance.
00:42:52.946 - 00:43:17.580, Speaker B: I think it would be interesting to see those products come about once people figure out the incentives for them to come about, especially as more and more money comes into DeFi. Also, just generally I'm excited for account abstraction to bring people into DeFi because I feel like EOAs are just not it for bringing the next millions, if not billions of users into DeFi as well.
00:43:18.350 - 00:43:22.734, Speaker E: I'm glad you mentioned that. Of course, Julian and preps and also.
00:43:22.852 - 00:43:26.686, Speaker C: Like not telling open live vulnerability on.
00:43:26.708 - 00:43:27.310, Speaker B: Twitter.
00:43:29.890 - 00:43:30.942, Speaker C: Helped a lot.
00:43:31.076 - 00:43:31.662, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:31.796 - 00:43:39.310, Speaker E: It begs the question, what are the types of products that are insurable in Defi? And then what are the parameters for which you're then paying premium?
00:43:39.470 - 00:43:46.760, Speaker B: This is an opportunity for people to figure out, because it obviously hasn't been figured out yet. So whoever does that's a massive opportunity.
00:43:49.130 - 00:44:00.520, Speaker C: The issue in the insurance side is always when something happened, then you have people fighting the case to say, no, it's not part of the insurance.
00:44:01.850 - 00:44:04.440, Speaker B: The same thing happens in the real world.
00:44:04.970 - 00:44:20.400, Speaker C: Yeah, true, because the people depositing out, incentivizing an LP to actually deposit capital, the insurance against the reimbursement process. So that's why it's completely natural for people.
00:44:20.770 - 00:44:24.690, Speaker E: You need a decentralized arbitration process that's impartial.
00:44:25.350 - 00:44:36.370, Speaker C: A lot of people have been trying to do like for example, like clever, those type of. But it's difficult. Then you have people attacking the governance of those protocol.
00:44:39.370 - 00:45:08.510, Speaker B: Whether it's insurance or even talking about lending parameters in governance forums. I think a big lesson in this is how much politics underlies what's going on. I mean, a lot of times people emphasize development code is law, but in reality, when push comes to shove, everybody has their intrigues and subjective view on things. How can we get people more aligned with each other when stuff really hits the fan?
00:45:08.850 - 00:45:22.820, Speaker D: Yeah, and it's PvP, man, it's finance. Everyone's trying to make their money in some ways. Yeah. Abracadabra has to protect its interests and they do what they can. So I don't know we can't all hold hands.
00:45:23.750 - 00:46:02.000, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's what Julian was saying earlier. Right now, the incentive for so many people in DeFi is to protect CRV. And that's why everyone is coming together. If there's anybody betting against CRV, it has to be someone who's completely abstracted, not a part of Defi at all. Because if CRV goes down, it just brings down so much of Defi with it. So there's incentives, as always, are our key here.
00:46:02.610 - 00:46:05.300, Speaker D: Go ahead. Go ahead, Joey, you're good.
00:46:07.590 - 00:46:56.050, Speaker C: You also have people that are in defy and for them they are purely traders mindset. And if the entire ecosystem goes down by 20 x or 50 x because they have overlap rate short position, then it's perfect for them and then they would just buy the bottom. So, yeah, it's interesting. What's very fascinating in this space is we all playing almost open hand cards on the table and everyone can watch in real time what's happening and can make decision according those different moves. It's something that never happened in traditional, except. Yes, exactly. Transparency of chaos, which is fascinating.
00:46:58.150 - 00:46:59.170, Speaker B: Equalization.
00:47:00.950 - 00:47:01.682, Speaker A: That's a good.
00:47:01.736 - 00:47:10.040, Speaker E: With all that, we still have the volatility, though, even with everyone's cards facing each other, it's still anyone's guess how the market will turn.
00:47:11.370 - 00:47:41.566, Speaker C: Yeah, but look, even if this big seismic risk on the entire ecosystem of defi, if you look at the price and the reaction of the market, it's stable. I would say so. We have learned mistakes from the past. We always say we never learn from the mistake and different things. But if you look at the market and look at how the project react to each other, how they help each other, and also the reaction of those different assets, it's pretty stable, I would say.
00:47:41.668 - 00:48:05.154, Speaker B: Yeah, I know it was talked about. Markets are PvP and yes, financial markets are pvp. But when it comes to builders banding together, it's PvE. It's positive sum. You had Frax and curve work together to build the novel incentive mechanism. You have Julian and everyone coming together to buy CRV because it's in their interest to gain more. There's.
00:48:05.154 - 00:48:14.198, Speaker B: I think there's two different ways to look at the PvP versus PvE, and I think it's always better in the long run to think in terms of PvE.
00:48:14.374 - 00:48:29.598, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I'm very pro growing the pie. Like, I wish more people thought in a positive some way. Yes. Maybe the bear market has made me a sin. I don't know.
00:48:29.684 - 00:48:31.360, Speaker A: Everyone's out there for themselves.
00:48:34.530 - 00:49:00.982, Speaker D: If there's enough money on the table and everyone at the table, people talk about USDT still not being backed. And it's like there are so many people who do not want that to, who want that to stay quiet. I'm not saying it's true because I don't know, but I just think there are sometimes enough people that everyone is just going to not quite tell the truth. And there are pockets of non transparency still in Defi. It's all imperfect very fast. I'm just saying.
00:49:01.116 - 00:49:03.160, Speaker C: Of course it's very hot.
00:49:05.070 - 00:49:38.246, Speaker E: I would say that from where we stand, though, in terms of the curve situation, the way that a lot of the protocols have been architected and have reacted and are using governance to manage this situation seems to indicate a point of maturity in terms of the industry that we've reached compared to some of the instability that we've seen over the last months and years in terms of crypto lending. And hopefully that is a silver lining to some of these situations where people are looking at the price and the price action and seeing the risk versus the reaction to it.
00:49:38.348 - 00:50:05.422, Speaker A: Yeah, you're right that the reaction has been a lot more orderly, I would say, than past. Cris, I'm remembering, was it black Thursday with Makerdao when everything kind of, it really felt like Defi was ending at the time. But yeah, things developed in a kind of cleaner way this time.
00:50:05.476 - 00:51:24.386, Speaker C: That's because the reason I think, is because the market didn't crash. But if you have a market that crash plus what happened then I think we cannot think are different because people also kind of lose rationality and it just goes into chaos mode and who will be able to survive and it's kind of like the sinking boat and who is able to jump out the boat and swim across the river. But yeah, it's fascinating. But what's also interesting is today we're only playing with systems that are not, I would say not rocket science, but we're playing with, it's a lending market, market maker, those type of things that are from a high level, quite easy to understand. But as soon as we bring those derivatives product like very sophisticated high frequency options, futures, bounds, depths and all different things, then the game will be way more complicated. So when something like that happens, it will be way more complicated to understand the different connection between all different tools, the different project connections. We are building a Defi Lego.
00:51:24.386 - 00:52:07.022, Speaker C: It's fun. It's amazing because everyone can actually build on top of each other and communicate between each other. And we are still at the level where we understand what's happening. If you look at a couple of years ago, I was also doing some deep analysis on some attack, like DyDx and things, they were like super simple, like flash loan, boom, you go and you hack and simple. But today they are becoming way more complicated. But we still same simple tools. I say simple quote, but when we start bringing more complex structures, more complex connection between all the different products, like for example, you say, okay, position in fax land, and then you can use it and then provide liquidity on the pool of curve.
00:52:07.022 - 00:52:38.382, Speaker C: That's what we call a type of, back then in traditional finance 2008, there was, we call the subprime crisis, like those type of structured products that were connected to each other. And at some point you don't even know what's happening behind the scene. And that's what I'm trying to say from today. Tools are quite simple and simple if you look at traditional finance. But when we bring those complex systems, they will become way more complex to understand what's happening and then way more complex to intervene and to stop either.
00:52:38.436 - 00:52:47.620, Speaker E: If there's something happening, does that kind of make us more prone to market contagion then as these tools become more interconnected and complicated to understand?
00:52:48.230 - 00:53:38.386, Speaker C: No, because then the tools, for example, we discussed the insurance, the audit, the formal verification software, the white hiker, will also increase in tools to be able to intervene and save and bring security over those attacks. I think it's always the same, it's not necessarily in a security level, you're never safe, or you try to understand what's the future attack, and you just continue like the same in encryption. Then you will have quantum physics, quantum computing, it's not a matter of keeping those algorithm in place, you just change them to make them quantum protected. We continue, we just increase the knowledge, we just increase the sophistication of those tools. But yeah, the system is becoming more complex for sure.
00:53:38.568 - 00:53:41.810, Speaker B: Evolve, adapt, survive and thrive.
00:53:43.750 - 00:53:54.280, Speaker C: Yeah, that's exactly the recap of our past few days, to be honest. TLDR everyone, plus sleep deprivations, of course.
00:53:55.610 - 00:54:51.100, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess we're not completely out of the woods yet like we discussed, but yeah, we should be watching how much it's costing to short and also how the OTC deals are going. But I think kind of the bright note of this conversation has definitely been how, even if it's because everyone's protecting their own positions and guided by their own incentives. But still there has been this sense of banding together to save Defi and yeah, it's been really interesting to see. I agree with Julian. We're still early. These tools are still pretty straightforward and simple.
00:54:51.100 - 00:55:34.950, Speaker A: YYC Trader who's joining us on the comments not on the stream today has a good point. Information asymmetry is still huge in Defi. It's going to get bigger as these things get more and more complex. So that's something to look out for and that's our role here at the defined to make things more transparent and clearer with Reg finance. Just a shout out to Julian's platform as well. Amazing place to look at hacks and also provide transparency to the space. And so yeah, we'll be here just continuing to report on everything that's happening on curve and elsewhere in Defi.
00:55:34.950 - 00:55:59.280, Speaker A: So thank you guys so much for joining the stream. This was, you know, interesting conversation. Thanks Julian and Dave, Jeremy and Owen as always, and hope all of the guys, everyone joining us will come next week as well. And that's all.
00:56:00.130 - 00:56:04.238, Speaker C: Thank you. Very good job. Very good job guys. Good quality. Good quality.
00:56:04.404 - 00:56:05.278, Speaker A: Thanks so much.
00:56:05.364 - 00:56:06.906, Speaker D: Thank you guys. Bye.
