00:00:00.250 - 00:00:17.534, Speaker A: Stunt time. Let's hope the merge goes a bit smoother than that, because the Bellatrix update is complete and pre merge excitement has now reached critical mass. Literally everyone is talking about it. Check out our reporter Tom and this report.
00:00:17.652 - 00:00:21.230, Speaker B: Excuse me, sir, are you excited about the merge?
00:00:21.570 - 00:00:22.590, Speaker A: What's that?
00:00:22.740 - 00:00:25.040, Speaker B: Good question. Are you excited about it, though?
00:00:26.890 - 00:00:58.750, Speaker A: With ETH on the verge of becoming sexy? Deflationary ultrasound. Ultrasound money, everyone and their dog's dogs. Dog has been aping in to secure an EnS domain with the seven day volume on OpenSea surpassing the likes of Bordeaux Yacht Club earth, the deeds, and artifact clones. This, my friends, is peak merge mania. And if you're feeling FOMO, you can check out our Ens tutorial by clicking the link right there. Go on, click it. You know you want to.
00:00:58.750 - 00:01:39.318, Speaker A: It's actually quite good, because why have a randomly assigned public key when you can snap up cool NFTs like zero seven eight two six eight eight two oh two dot ETH? Or this zinger 710547 dot ETH. The ladies will love it. And yet. And yet it does make me think of personalized number plates on poshcard. Oh, contain yourselves, because as our boys Ryan and David can scarcely believe in spite of this premerge hype getting cranked up all the way to eleven. Salana, summer is back. What? And leading the charge is the NFT collection.
00:01:39.318 - 00:02:04.190, Speaker A: Dujour utes. Did you say utes? Yes, your honor. Yutes, formerly known as duppies. And they've generated crazy hype and delivered the numbers to back it up. So today we'll be examining the utopian dream. Is it just a flash in the pan, or could the team's approach prove a landmark moment for NFTs and grammar? All that coming right up. This, as it ever was, is bit of science.
00:02:04.190 - 00:02:37.354, Speaker A: So yoots. And it's zero, zero in the middle. Like C zero zero. This is the new 15,000 item PFP collection, taking the space by storm and the wizard behind the curtain. The man pulling the strings is this guy. De gods, founder and blatant antifa hooligan Frank. Frank de gods.
00:02:37.354 - 00:03:21.382, Speaker A: Now, Frank's an impressive guy, because in between picketing MAGA rallies and dismantling capitalism, he's also built one of the most loyal and thriving NFT communities. Across all chains. The gods enjoyed a new lease of life this year. By dying, holders could state their gods to earn the dust token and finally transcend their NFTs to immortal dead God status. Given the team's huge success, it became the number one collection on Solana by far. Don't you know the easy path here would have been to follow the old yuga playbook with some kind of derivative collection, like dogs, for example, or even worse, drogs or I don't know. But Frank went back to the drawing board for an original collection that aims to shape the course of web3 forever.
00:03:21.382 - 00:04:02.710, Speaker A: Or to quote Frank himself, we tried some shit, we learned some shit, and now we're trying some new shit. How web3 and that is exactly how builders should be thinking. But before we dive into this new shit, they'd be trying and why it matters, and what brand of bog roll you should be using to wipe up the shit when it comes out. Here's a very quick message from our sponsors. Optimized for security and sustainability, aura is bringing strong yield on stables, ether and key DFI assets back to Ethereum. Aura is trusted by over $300 million in TVL from users and dows like Balancer, gnosis, rocket pool, Notional and Olympus. Visit Aura Finance today and participate in protocol governance to get access to DFI's newest home for reserve assets.
00:04:02.710 - 00:04:47.206, Speaker A: You're just clicks away from making your idle assets productive. So Yut is a 15K collection and the first step on the road to getting one of these is to mint one of these, a tube which you then burn or redeem for your yoked NFT. According to the revealed artwork, they should look something like this anyway. Nine and a half thousand tubes were reserved for dead gods holders, leaving only around three and a half thousand available for whitelisting. But whitelisting is clearly fascist, so Frank and his crew came up with an interesting alternative, scholarships allowing aspiring Utes to apply to this elite and exclusive club. Think Web three's answer to the Soho house. If you're cool enough and at least a seven, you're in.
00:04:47.206 - 00:05:40.462, Speaker A: Suffice it to say, the applications came in thick and fast, with over 11,000 in the first 24 hours and more than 70,000 since the official announcement have signed up to be scholars at this house of beautiful education. Yes, as some have pointed out, Utes is even more selective than Harvard supply and demand kids, you know it works every single time. Now, many applications were, in fact incredibly imaginative. Either way, this was an ingenious viral marketing strategy, and apart from a few delays, and by all accounts an occasionally frustrating mint process, the big day itself saw Solano records smashed across the board. Now, there's no denying that Frank and the team have indeed absolutely crushed it. But the really interesting thing about Utes isn't the clever marketing or the organic viral efficiency of the scholarship system or the wider brand itself. It's actually their innovative approach to everyone's favourite topic, IP rights.
00:05:40.462 - 00:06:35.210, Speaker A: And this is the reason why the project garnered so much attention. And during an interview with Kevin Rose, Frank himself acknowledged that IP isn't really such a big deal in the Solana community, at least not compared to across the Ethereum aisle, with all its accompanying hand wringing. Hype is hype, fomo is foMO, and human behavior, well, it's a little bit weird. Even Wayne Rooney was aping in like a maniac and whatever smart money is, well, they were aping too. Meanwhile, for those with a genuine interest in IP and NFTs, Frank is actually trying some pretty cool shit rich this is the Y paper. But why? Because white paper is a fascist, bro. And why refers to a common sense approach to NFT intellectual property that could propel utes to becoming the greatest collection of all time? Ten points for bold aspirations.
00:06:35.210 - 00:07:41.706, Speaker A: The white paper itself is pretty high level stuff and an expansive four pages long, but the basic premise is to promote a democratized creator economy in the Utes ecosystem. First, they're creating a utes store where artists, or at least anyone, can submit custom traits and earn royalties by owning IP in the form of a y token. But why? There are, of course, some key criteria. You can't simply draw a giant Vitali sized wanger and fix it to your ute's forehead. Alas, traits are approved by being of a certain standard, conforming to specific dimensions, and obviously any lewd and hateful content will be banned straight away. But for those that do get added to the store, owning the Y for a trait allows you to set the price and supply sell the entire y to someone else, or collect 5% of the royalties per sale. So what this means is a designer, for instance, could release a cool new pair of sunglasses, or drop an entire range, or even launch a clothing brand.
00:07:41.706 - 00:08:55.414, Speaker A: Holders can then purchase community created traits, but only apply one a month. And crucially, this all happens without changing the NFT's original metadata. So we'll see the formation of subcommunities and subdoubs, which can also collect a percentage of royalties. In a recent Twitter thread, the NFT investor, simply known as guitar, reveals that Utes applied for a registered trademark in August 2022 with the same IP attorney as Ugalabs, Nvidia and meta top train spotting marks there, based on the wide array of marks applied for, guitar speculates that the team is targeting an extremely wide array of uses across a range of different sectors, and you can check it out by clicking the link in the video description below. So go ahead and click it. Speaking of the team, Dust Labs, a tech startup spinoff rather than a parent company, just hit headlines after a $7 million seed raise involving the likes of FTX Ventures, Salana Ventures, Magic Eden, and Jump. And yes, it has been confirmed that VCs will indeed receive Dust tokens with a four year lockup, which should dampen any fears of an SPF dumparino anytime soon.
00:08:55.414 - 00:09:32.250, Speaker A: Dust's price and volume pumped emphatically in the mint, and while it's plummeted somewhat in the days since the mint, no surprises there. One would assume the use case is only going to expand along with dust labs ecosystem at large. So what do you think? Will the Y model succeed and provide a working blueprint for others to follow? Are scholarships the new meta? Is that even the correct use of the word meta? I don't know, but hats off to young Frank for pushing the boat out. And congratulations too, on an impressive second album. But who cares what I think? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.
