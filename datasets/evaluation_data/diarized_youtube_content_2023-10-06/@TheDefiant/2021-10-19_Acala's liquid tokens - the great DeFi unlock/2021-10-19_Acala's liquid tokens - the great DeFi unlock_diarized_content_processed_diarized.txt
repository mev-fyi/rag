00:00:00.650 - 00:00:27.702, Speaker A: Good morning, afternoon, wherever you are, I hope you're having a pleasant day today. We're going to be looking at Acala, we're going to be looking at Carrera, we're going to be looking at crowd loans and specifically liquid staking and how that has become the foundation for a new product on Acala, liquid crowd loan tokens. Pretty wild stuff. Tons to dig into. All of that. Coming up after this message from our sponsors. Siren is a decentralized platform for trading cryptocurrency options.
00:00:27.702 - 00:01:27.470, Speaker A: And for those that don't know options that well, as a trader, you can participate in market upside while limiting your risk by buying options on your favorite Defi tokens. As a liquidity provider, passively earn rewards when people bet on the markets, and you can also earn rewards from the option premiums and Si rewards themselves. Siren removes the middleman and gives the power to run markets directly to you, the Defi community. So to trade defi options or become a liquidity provider, check out Siren by clicking the link in the description. So in this tutorial, not really a tutorial so much as it is a primer on crowdloans, akala, which is the defi hub of Polkadot and why this particular ecosystem is so interesting to us at the Defiant. So this is the Akala liquid crowd loan tokens tutorial, primer thing, whatever you want to take out of it. So what is the liquid crowd loan tokens? Well, they've literally just announced this, this token LC dot which will give Polkadot crowd loan participants ongoing access to their liquidity.
00:01:27.470 - 00:01:59.198, Speaker A: And the helpful graphic here is a padlock and then a drop. Well, we won't blame them for shoddy graphics, but let's just dig straight into what a Carter itself actually is. They call it the defi hub of Polkadot. It's a layer one smart contract platform. It is specifically optimized for Defi. It's built on substrate and they have their own decentralized stablecoin AUSD, which is native to Polkadot. And if you want a really helpful way of thinking about it, it's Terra.
00:01:59.198 - 00:02:40.362, Speaker A: But for Polkadot, Terra has aust. That's the stablecoin that powers everything on Terra. And we've looked at anchor in the past, we looked at mirror. We're going to be looking at Nexus this week. Terra has some amazing things for Defi citizens to dig into and get excited about. The problem is when I talk to people about Defi and what's going on, why I'm excited, I just end up talking about terror because it's the one where I see so much that relates to me. I want an alternative, and I'm hopeful that with Akala and with Karura on Kusama, you have to bear with me on this, that we will actually have a competitive product to what's being built on Terra.
00:02:40.362 - 00:03:07.326, Speaker A: That can only be a good thing. And the reason that this is all going to be possible, we'll get into. But it sort of has something to do with constipation. Yes. So one of the important things to remember about Polka Dot is it's a staking network, and people have been staking on polka dot and earning massive amounts of rewards. It's very favorable to stake there. And the stake value, when I looked at it today, $27 billion rewind.
00:03:07.326 - 00:03:38.082, Speaker A: $27 billion. That's a lot of money. And what's it doing? Absolutely nothing. Yeah, it's just sitting there hoovering up, staking rewards and doing nothing. Now, the thing about polka dot is once you stake on polka dot, you can't unstake for 28 days. So there's a 28 day unbonding period. It's slightly less on Kusama, but all that capital is just sitting there doing nothing.
00:03:38.082 - 00:04:08.060, Speaker A: And it's not doing nothing, it's earning rewards, but it can't do anything. And that's what I mean when I talk about it being constipated. It's just clogging up the system. And that's kind of bad if you want to create an economy of value transfer and of people to be able to do things, because if everyone's just staking, it's basically sitting in a savings account. And that if you ask any government economist, that's bad news. You want people to spend their money. You want capital to be flowing from one thing to another, and that's how economies work.
00:04:08.060 - 00:04:41.330, Speaker A: So one of the first kind of major flagship products of the Akala ecosystem is, in fact, a token. That's for Kusama. I'll just rewind here. Kusama is the canary network of Polkadot. It is the network where they test stuff out, where there are sort of less rigorous restrictions put on validators, and it's easier to test stuff out. And Kusama has become a network with an enormous amount of value locked up in it as well. About $2 billion locked up in Kusama, in staking.
00:04:41.330 - 00:05:13.086, Speaker A: But it's the place where you can play around and mess around with stuff, and there's a lot of interesting experiments being done there. Karura is the Akala equivalent being built on Kusama. Still with me. So what Akala have done, they've created a liquid staking token. And that liquid staking token is called LKSM. So you can stake KSM to earn LKSM and you'll get 16% apr in staking rewards, which you can kind of see here on the staking dashboard. It's relatively straightforward to wrap your head around.
00:05:13.086 - 00:05:56.586, Speaker A: Basically have your tokens in a wallet, go to the website, stake them, and all you do there is you say, this is how much I want to lock up in the staking contract and then done. And then you will then be able to withdraw LKSM. And the difference with LKSM is that it is liquid, which means that you can actually do stuff with it. So you have a staking token that isn't locked up, that isn't clogged up, but allows you to then go further in your defi journey. So what could you do with this? You could use it as collateral for a KUSD stablecoin loan. So let's say you wanted to earn some rewards on stablecoins anchor protocol. You can earn 20% on your aust.
00:05:56.586 - 00:06:24.358, Speaker A: Similar kind of thing will be possible with KUSD. I'm not sure what their stablecoin interest rates are at the moment. Looking forward to digging in there. You could also trade against K USD on career swap. So if you're just trading there, you could do that and then you could lp it into the KSM pool. So there's basically some fairly rudimentary defi things that you can do. All of this will mature and will become a much more built out system.
00:06:24.358 - 00:06:47.306, Speaker A: I'm imagining you're going to see things like synthetic stocks. You're going to see things like healthy kind of money markets, lending and borrowing. And there'll be a bunch of other things that you can do as well. Look at everything that's been built on terra. I'm sure we will see similar products being built on Acala. It just seems to be set up in the same way. So this brings us to the idea of parachains.
00:06:47.306 - 00:07:17.526, Speaker A: Now, if you don't know how Polkadot works, Polkadot is a relay chain. It is the kind of base layer for parachains to be built on top of. And parachains are chains that run in parallel to Polkadot. They're not standalone blockchains. They are connected to the Polkadot chain and they inherit the security and the robustness of Polkadot. And here's a little diagram how they work. You have validators sitting between the power chain and the relay chain and they connect and talk to each other.
00:07:17.526 - 00:07:42.314, Speaker A: And there are limited slots on polka dot. There are around 100 slots for power chains and projects. There is common goods chains that can be opened up for things that are in the common good. That's a subject for another video. And then projects can bid for the chance to get one of these slots. Now when they bid, they don't own the slot, they're just leasing it. So they're leasing a space on the Polkadot network.
00:07:42.314 - 00:08:33.070, Speaker A: And these things are deliberately scarce for the plain and simple reason that they only want good projects on the network. They don't want garbage on there. And you could look at everything that's built on Ethereum and say, well, is it all good? Well, no, it's not. But Polkadot is deliberately setting the bar high so that only the very best projects that are actually adding value to the whole Polkadot ecosystem are successful enough and robust enough to be able to sit there and go, yeah, we've justified our place as a parachain. So in order to bid for a parachain, you have to bid in dot tokens. And a crowd loan effectively allows a parachain applicant to bid using funds borrowed from us. It's like a Kickstarter campaign for a parachain auction.
00:08:33.070 - 00:09:29.438, Speaker A: So the way they work is a team will decide that they want to go up for a parachain and they will nominate themselves and say, yeah, we're going to go up for a slot. The first parachain auctions on Polka Dot have been announced and they will be starting on the 11 November. So Acalo, which is kind of seen as one of the blue chip applicants for the parachain slots, is going up for one. And of course they want your money, they want your dot in order to be successful in that auction. So they're going to incentivize you to lock up your dot, not in a staking contract like everything else that is on Polkadot, but with them. You know, they're asking you to forego the staking rewards that you would expect to normally get with your dot and instead stake your tokens with them. Stake your dot.
00:09:29.438 - 00:09:57.242, Speaker A: And to incentivize you to do that, they will give you ACA tokens. ACA tokens instead. Now, the fundamental thing to remember about crowd loans is you're not giving your dot to the project, not at all. You're lending it. So for the term of the loan, you will receive tokens as a reward for doing so. Now, power chain slots lease for a period of maximum of 24 months. That's two years.
00:09:57.242 - 00:10:34.838, Speaker A: So think about that. So what a Carlo is asking you to do is lend them your dot tokens for two years. Think about that. In terms of crypto, that's a very long time to have your tokens in someone else's hands and you can't get them. No, no. Now, if they're unsuccessful in their bid attempt, then as soon as the crowd loan, the auction period ends, you get your tokens back. But if they are successful, then your tokens form part of Akala's stake, their overall stake into the network for the period of their loan, two years.
00:10:34.838 - 00:11:13.460, Speaker A: Now, at the end of that period, you can get your tokens back and then Akala will have to resubmit an application for a crowd loan or for an auction slot, and the biding process begins again. And this keeps the whole thing healthy. Now, you would imagine that if Akala is successful, then there will be a very good chance them getting the slot again, but they will have to rebid for it in two years. So that's how that works. So that two year period, that's two years where your dot tokens are not yours, they're in the hands of somebody else. Now, they're still your tokens, effectively, but you can't do anything with them. You can't unlock that value you're getting.
00:11:13.460 - 00:11:55.582, Speaker A: How do you pronounce that? Please, someone from the Akala team, let's call them Arca. You get your Arca tokens and those will be distributed to you ongoing for the period of two years. But here's the thing akala said, well, we're a defi hub. Defi is very good at solving these kinds of problems. So let's create a product, a liquid crowd loan token that allows people that lock up their tokens with us to extract the liquidity from those tokens. So that is what LC Dot is. It creates a liquid version of locked Dot.
00:11:55.582 - 00:12:29.446, Speaker A: And there's going to be a governance proposal put forward to allow it to be available as collateral for minting AUSD, the same way that you could see with LKSM. So here's basically a diagram of how it works. You contribute dot to the liquid crowd loan vault, which is managed by Akala. Then you receive your aka tokens, which is your share of the network. The more dot you lock, the higher the rewards. Then you receive that liquid crowd loan dot token, which is a liquid token representing your locked dot. And then that lCDOT lets you access the underlying dot liquidity so you can swap uses collateral to mint AUSD.
00:12:29.446 - 00:12:58.966, Speaker A: It just becomes a primitive that you can use within the Akala ecosystem. Then in two years time you can use lCDOT to redeem the underlying dOt locked in the Acala crowd loan so that LCDOT represents a claim on dOt locked in a crowd loan. And that's it. So you can imagine that there might be some arbitrage opportunities. If the market between LC and Dot drifts, then you could use that to benefit. I don't know. We'll have to see how that's going to work out.
00:12:58.966 - 00:13:40.162, Speaker A: Now, there's a transition to trustless here, which needs to happen because Akala is not live on Polkadot yet, which means it's not fully trustless. So there's going to be an in between stage where you will send your dot to a proxy account which is controlled by a multi Sig wallet from Akala foundation. So initially there will be a trust component. This will be mitigated pretty soon, and if they're successful in their bid, then everything moves over to Polkadot main and that will become fully decentralized. So how will you join the crowd loan? Well, there's a bunch of things that you need to do. It's nothing particularly difficult. So in the crowd loan key details, they say the lease period is going to be two years.
00:13:40.162 - 00:14:00.246, Speaker A: The reward ratio to be announced, vesting to be announced. I think they have actually announced this now, but I don't know what the details are. Not important. Anyway, you can go ahead and find that for yourself. The eligibility, no KYC is required, but participants must agree to terms and conditions. That's kind of important. So there's a few different ways you can do it.
00:14:00.246 - 00:14:25.678, Speaker A: You can go via the website using the Polkadot JS wallet extension. I've always found this to be a little bit kind of clumsy, all of this. Here's the website. Once you go through it, it's not so hard, but the one you want is this extension here. And then you add that as like a browser extension. I just feel like they could give it a better name. But anyway, that's the polka dot JS extension.
00:14:25.678 - 00:14:50.806, Speaker A: You can also join via exchanges like OKX, Kucoin and Huobi. And then they've got mobile wallets as well. Polka wallet, fearless wallet math. And then I guess there's going to be more wallets as well. So that's really the longer and the short of it. So the headlines here staking clogs up a network. It's constipation, effectively if you want economic activity, then you have to promote liquidity.
00:14:50.806 - 00:15:15.390, Speaker A: You have to promote value to flow through. And once you can tap into $27 billion of value, it's the same thing with Cardano. If Cardano can figure out everything liquid staking, if Cardano can figure it out, I'm sure they can, Charles. I trust you. Then there's so much value to be unlocked here. Polkadot has the same thing. But this is how you do it.
00:15:15.390 - 00:15:33.826, Speaker A: This is how you do it, Charles. So it's the first parachain auction on Polkadot, which is starting November. We can think of a car as the terror of Polkadot. And locked. Locked is now a meme. If things value is free to travel, it will travel. And that is the end of the tutorial.
00:15:33.826 - 00:15:57.580, Speaker A: If you have any suggestions for things you'd like us to cover in a tutorial, I realized that this wasn't actually a tutorial. It was more of a primer. But hey, still useful stuff. Then drop it in the comments below. Usual story subscribe, do it, do it. Tell your friends, tell your mum, tell your dog to subscribe, get your dog a YouTube account, start making stuff and that's where it ends. I'll see you on the next one.
