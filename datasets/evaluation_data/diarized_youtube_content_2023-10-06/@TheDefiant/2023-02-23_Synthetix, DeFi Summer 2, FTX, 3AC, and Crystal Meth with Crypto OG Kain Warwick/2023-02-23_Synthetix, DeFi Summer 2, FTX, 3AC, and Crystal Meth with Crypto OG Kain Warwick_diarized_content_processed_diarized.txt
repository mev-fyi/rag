00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:04.130 - 00:00:50.230, Speaker B: Cain Warwick is the founder of Synthetics and a total crypto OG. Synthetics is a new financial primitive, enabling the creation of synthetic assets, offering unique derivatives and exposure to real world assets on the blockchain. Today we dive into what's next for synthetics with the latest V three launch. What will cause the next big leg up in DFI, what we're calling DFI summer two, the differentiation between different perps that exist in crypto. How synthetics made the decision to launch on a layer two so quickly and burn all bridges behind them. And it gets pretty spicy with some tea on FTX and three arrows capital. Before we dive into this, Cain is going to tell us what he's been up to since we last spoke to him about what it takes to scale ethereum last year.
00:00:50.400 - 00:01:34.362, Speaker A: I think the last three or four months for me has been like a bit of a break from the ecosystem. I'd had many years of kind of continued obsessive engagement in the community and I kind of took a step back from synthetics governance and look, to be perfectly frank and transparent. I just wanted to kind of take a look at myself. It had been a long time since I'd actually thought about what I was doing, what I was trying to get out of things, and it's been really helpful. It's been really a helpful process for me to go through. So the last month or so has been kind of getting back into things and starting to kind of get a sense of where things were at.
00:01:34.416 - 00:01:57.362, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah. I think that time off is super important in a space that's twenty four seven and sucks all of your attention. So it's great you were able to take a little break and then emerge and we're super excited that you're on the defiant with that emergence. And you definitely qualify as a crypto OG. So tell us a little bit about your history. You're most known for synthetics, I think, as many listeners know.
00:01:57.496 - 00:02:34.414, Speaker A: Yeah, I think people kind of are aware that I ran a payment gateway back in 2014. We started it as a way to allow people to convert fiat into digital. It wasn't aimed at crypto necessarily, but it became like a really kind of compelling use case, this fiat into crypto use case. And so that business still runs. It's called Blue Shift. We've got like 2000 locations around Australia where people can take fiat and convert it into crypto as well as other things. Right.
00:02:34.414 - 00:03:20.746, Speaker A: Like, there's a bunch of stuff that it does. So that's how I got into the space I'd known people like Asher Tan from Coinjar, because I was in online retail, and so I was always interested in the payment space. So bitcoin to me was like this interesting thing of how do we solve payments online? Right. Obviously, we've moved multiple narratives away from digital currency and payments in the bitcoin land. But I do think that that was kind of what got me interested in the space in the first place. There were genuine problems in online commerce that were unsolved, and even the stripes of the world and PayPal's and stuff weren't really addressing those, you know, crypto for was. That was kind of the entry point.
00:03:20.848 - 00:03:34.834, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah. I think even Satoshi got it wrong. Right. Satoshi thought it was going to be for payments, and it turned out to be more for store of value. But we're on the cusp of lightning, and hopefully we'll make developments there one day.
00:03:34.872 - 00:03:35.074, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:35.112 - 00:03:40.338, Speaker B: Right. Visa does a pretty good job, though, so it's not the easiest to compete with.
00:03:40.504 - 00:03:41.220, Speaker A: Agree.
00:03:41.590 - 00:03:51.042, Speaker B: Amazing. Well, we were just providing infrastructure for it. You were fully in it. DFI summer. Let's talk about it. What was that like leading up to that 2021 boom?
00:03:51.186 - 00:04:23.786, Speaker A: So I was talking to someone about this maybe like a week or so ago. I've been kind of reading scouts people and having some conversations over the last month, and I was trying to explain it because they weren't in the space when this was going on. And I was like, people don't realize. They think d five summer was this huge thing. There were like 50 people. It was like, not many people. It was just like, literally like a bunch of telegram groups, and someone would wake you up in the morning and be like, hey, there's a new yield farm.
00:04:23.786 - 00:05:12.202, Speaker A: And the same people who are building the yield farms who are doing the thing, it was all the same group of people. It was not like there were millions of people doing this. And I do think that that kind of insanity that happened in Defi summer kind of laid the groundwork then for this awareness of Defi as a movement. But that kind of initial, sort of very insular, pvp game kind of style stuff that we were doing in Defi Summer was what proves that it could actually do things. Like, we had smart contracts that were doing things. Money was being made, money was being lost. It was a bit weird and self contained, but it was a thing that was functional.
00:05:12.346 - 00:05:24.922, Speaker B: Absolutely, yeah. And in the middle of that boom, it definitely felt like we were kind of on the cusp of this end user adoption. And it seems like somewhere along the way, that adoption didn't really happen. Do you kind of feel similarly?
00:05:25.086 - 00:05:57.470, Speaker A: I do. I think in the midst of defi summer, transactions got expensive. Right. And we were all like, oh, it cost more than a dollar to transfer ETH, right. I think there was a little bit of concern about that. People would kind of talk about it, and synthetics in particular, the contracts were very complex back then, and the way that you deployed complex, smart contracts on Ethereum was pretty different back then. Right.
00:05:57.470 - 00:06:46.826, Speaker A: And so we always had very high transaction costs. Again, you're talking $3 versus a dollar, but back then, that was meaningful money for a lot of people in the space. And so people would complain. They're like, I can't believe I'm paying $8 to claim this week. And so it was just always on our mind that that was a thing that we needed to address. And so when DFI summer really kicked off, and then probably, like, the March 2020 crash was when it became really obvious the network couldn't handle the amount of activity that was on it. There were too many interconnected systems, too many sort of, I guess, arbitrage like transactions where you've got money over here, money over here, and you need to kind of keep them in sync.
00:06:46.826 - 00:07:08.114, Speaker A: When you have two pots of money, it's fine when you have 1000. The kind of networking between those things that all had to run through Ethereum just was impossible for it to handle. And so we saw transaction costs blow up. It was like 300, 400. Way to get a transaction on chain. This is when Ethan. Not very expensive either.
00:07:08.114 - 00:07:32.950, Speaker A: Right. It became much worse later. So I do think that period in Defi summer where we saw transactions were becoming expensive was like the early thing, and people kind of had an inkling this was a problem. But then when mass adoption happens, we didn't have the scale. We couldn't support it. It was impossible to support a million users on Ethereum. It was too expensive.
00:07:33.030 - 00:07:42.650, Speaker B: And I assume that that is what led you to start thinking about scaling. You were one of the first applications to migrate to a layer two. Can you talk a little bit about that?
00:07:42.820 - 00:08:00.310, Speaker A: Yeah. Again, this was an ongoing conversation in the synthetics community from early 2019, where people were like, synthetics is too expensive to use. Right. We were the original. Ethereum is too expensive to use. It was like, synthetics is too expensive to use. This is a joke.
00:08:00.310 - 00:08:34.302, Speaker A: Why are these transactions cost so high? And we'd be like, oh, complexity. And you kind of hand wave it and we're working on stuff, but it really meant that. And look, let's be honest, right? I sat in a room in 2017 and 2018 and listened to Vitalik promise us that scaling was coming. E two was almost here. We were like, yeah, this is someone else's problem. It'll be solved, right? We don't need to worry about this too much. And so we would kind of hand wave it, right? A little bit.
00:08:34.302 - 00:08:59.658, Speaker A: And then we got to a point where we were like, okay, we can't hand wave this anymore. This is actually bad. This is impacting. Even if it wasn't mass adoption, it was impacting our adoption within the nascent defi community, because people would just write off synthetic and be like, it's too expensive to use it. I don't care, whatever, right? And any kind of friction like that was really problematic. And so we were like, okay, guys, we get it. Vitalik's not going to do this for us this year.
00:08:59.658 - 00:09:17.870, Speaker A: Let's go. And so once things like optimism and the unipig demo and stuff popped up, synthetics was ready to jump on that. And we did, and we just jumped straight on. And we're like, hey, guys, we've got a big problem. We need your help. And that was initial conversations with Jing and Carl and Kevin and those guys.
00:09:17.940 - 00:09:26.674, Speaker B: Amazing. And then, is there anything that you wish you had done differently around that? And maybe speaking in the sense of someone who's thinking about it today, thinking.
00:09:26.712 - 00:10:04.830, Speaker A: About migrating to a layer two, look, I guess we made a decision to lean into that and kind of burn the boats, right. In the same way that we did on Ethereum. Right? We're like, let's not keep optionality open. Let's not try and hedge our bets. Let's just make a decision, go all in, have a seat at the table in terms of what this network will look like. Speaking of optimism, right? And that's not the right decision for everyone. Obviously, someone has to take the pain of that.
00:10:04.830 - 00:10:54.350, Speaker A: But the value that we got from being able to be connected to that early work that was going on at optimism, and to have this symbiotic relationship, this kind of information sharing as like a complex smart contract suite, sharing that information of what that was like, to run that with the people who are building this new network that was going to have to support those kinds of complex, smart contracts, was invaluable to the space. And we just sort of said, this is just going to be part of what happens, right? Someone has to do this. Someone has to kind of put that effort in. And so we did it today. I think people are in a situation where there are multiple scaling solutions out there. There's arbitrum, there's optimism, there's stockware, there's stocknet. There are multiple things.
00:10:54.350 - 00:11:07.540, Speaker A: But I think the key thing for me is they're all within the ethereum ecosystem. So regardless of which one is your preferred flavor, we now have scaling within Ethereum, which was really all that I wanted.
00:11:08.550 - 00:11:17.238, Speaker B: Amazing. And then where do you think we're headed with defi? Obviously, we do have some product market fit, but what do you think will give DeFi that next leg up?
00:11:17.404 - 00:11:43.766, Speaker A: So I think where we sort of sit now, right, is maybe in a position where it's like the kind of pressage to d five summer two. Right. People joked in 2020 about, like, d five summer two never happened. Right. And there's a whole bunch of reasons why that didn't happen. But people are like, well, d five summer happened. Obviously, there's going to have to be a D five summer two.
00:11:43.766 - 00:12:15.330, Speaker A: And there was dfi two for a while. Let's not forget about that, right. That meme and DFI two was just like, taking the most kind of adversarial aspects of DeFI and just isolating them into this crazy Pvp game, right. Which was fun and cool and interesting, but I don't know that it was sustainable. Right. And so we kind of learned that lesson. But this idea that there will be, like, a DFI summer, too, has been floating around since 2019, the original DFI summer.
00:12:15.330 - 00:12:54.990, Speaker A: And so I do think that now, four years later, we are actually in a position where that might happen. And one of the things that I think I've been reflecting on is that DeFi as a whole, we. Right, the collective Defi, kind of fucked it up. Right. We didn't quite get there. And there's people who are not in DeFi but in the ethereum community that I think are also somewhat, we have to take a little bit of responsibility for this, right. Infrastructure providers and people working on scaling, we just didn't quite get there.
00:12:54.990 - 00:13:38.522, Speaker A: Right. And so what happened was people turned up before the party was ready. Right. We were just not ready for it. And so the problem with that was that we weren't able to provide solutions for people in a safe, transparent, noncustodial, decentralized way. Right, and people being people, they want what they want, and they went to centralized solutions. Right? This idea of another dominant, centralized exchange popping up in 2019, we were all like, no, there's finance, but no one's ever going to turn up and be able to take on finance.
00:13:38.522 - 00:13:59.500, Speaker A: We're going to be the ones, we'll be the next ones who will be there. And we just weren't ready. We didn't get there. And then a whole bunch of other stuff happened, the altel one thesis. And there were a whole bunch of path dependent, weird things that happened because we weren't ready for this influx of users. And end result is that we let a bunch of criminals steal everyone's money, and that's on us. Right.
00:13:59.500 - 00:14:43.158, Speaker A: We really fucked that up. Right? And I do think that we're in a position now with scaling, with the infrastructure, with all the things that we have, where by the time people turn up this cycle, we'll be ready to offer a range of noncustodial solutions to the things that people want to do. They want to be able to trade, they want to be able to transact with one another, they want to be able to play games, they want to be able to do all this stuff. And I think we will be ready this time. I hope we'll be ready. So when DFI summer happens this time, DfI summer two, the real DFI summer two, I'm hoping that it is actually more like mass adoption than it was last time around, where it was just 50 people on a telegram channel.
00:14:43.244 - 00:14:51.514, Speaker B: Totally amazing. Yeah, super excited for that. And it's interesting to think about those kind of components that have come together to get things ready now.
00:14:51.632 - 00:15:18.642, Speaker A: Synthetics just released their V two perpetual futures trading contracts with the lowest fees of any decentralized perps markets available anywhere. Outside of a centralized exchange, synthetics perps are available to trade with up to 25 x. Leverage on optimism through two partner Dapps, Quinta IO and decentrex.com, the community intends to launch dozens of unique assets and is developing plans for trading incentives by the end of the month.
00:15:18.776 - 00:15:27.140, Speaker B: Are there any pieces that you think are lacking when it comes to the infrastructure or just things needed for that defi summer, too.
00:15:27.750 - 00:16:16.750, Speaker A: So I think the thing that attracts people, and we got some of this, right, like the thing that attracted people to on chain transactions was uniswap in that kind of last period, right. There were a lot of people who were interacting on Uniswap because it was faster at letting them do the dumb stuff that they wanted to do than anything else, right? Like Uniswap is faster than binance, faster than FTX, faster than all these other solutions, right? And so I think the ability to be responsive to user needs, right, whatever those might be. We don't get to choose what the user wants. The user's wants and needs, we have to be able to be responsive to that. Right. And the only way you can really be responsive is if you have a genuine competitive marketplace. And we just didn't.
00:16:16.750 - 00:16:33.290, Speaker A: Right, we didn't have a competitive marketplace of spot trading. We kind of had uniswap. Right. And then there were a couple of things that popped up that really couldn't compete with Uniswap. Right. And we didn't really have a competitive landscape of perp products. We do now.
00:16:33.290 - 00:17:01.886, Speaker A: There's like ten different perp products. Right. And you can't be a credible marketplace if you've got one person offering a solution. It's just not going to work. So I think this time the key is to have a range of solutions. And within the Ethereum ecosystem, we now have that in whatever category of trading or activity that users want to do, staking services, all that, there's multiple solutions. And I think that just puts them in a much better place than we were historically.
00:17:01.998 - 00:17:11.126, Speaker B: Yeah. And for some of the listeners who might not be as familiar with DeFi, can you break down those categories and the different players in each just to kind of map it out?
00:17:11.228 - 00:17:37.534, Speaker A: Yeah, obviously, like talking about letting users give money to criminals. One of the things that people want to be able to do in a bull market is they want to be able to borrow against their crypto assets. They don't want to sell them. Right. Now that can take many forms. Right? Like it can be that they want like a passive yield on their bitcoin or Ethereum, or they want to take out like a leveraged loan so they can yolo more crypto. Right.
00:17:37.534 - 00:17:58.610, Speaker A: Like whatever they want to do, that's not our problem. We can't decide what people want to do. We can't stop people from doing weird, crazy shit. They're going to do what they do. We just need to make sure that we have solutions that protect them as much as possible. Right. And so one of the areas of infrastructure, I guess, that we did do fairly well with in Defi summer was in lending, lending and borrowing.
00:17:58.610 - 00:18:59.394, Speaker A: We had Aave, we had compound, we had some aggregators, we had some more weird and wonderful things, but we had a suite of solutions for that problem and people were able to use it. Where I think it probably broke down a little bit is we didn't have at that time the capacity to sort of take on assets from other ecosystems and other chains and bitcoin. So people were just like, well, I've got this app and I can go and send my crypto to them and they'll pay me a yield, right, in order to be able to do a better job. Now, you can't compete with fraud, right? Like, it's really hard to compete with fraud if someone's like, hey, download my app and I'll pay you 28% interest for the rest of time. And don't ask why some people are going to be tricked by that. And one of the things you can't do in d five is give them fake. It's too transparent.
00:18:59.394 - 00:19:48.934, Speaker A: I can't be like, oh, yeah, you get 28% yield if you deposit this into the smart contract, maybe through tokens and all kinds of stuff, but in terms of in kind yield, it's just not possible. That doesn't exist, right? So there are things like that where I guess you can't necessarily compete, but what you can do is create an environment where people understand the risks a little bit better. And if you have really good solutions to these problems, that just will occur naturally. And so you've got lending, you've got trading, you've got perps and derivatives, you've got yield generating things. But there isn't a huge amount of stuff that people want to do. There's only like three or four things they want to do. You just have to have robust solutions for all of them, and they need to be easy to access.
00:19:49.052 - 00:20:13.950, Speaker B: That totally makes sense. And then I guess I have a question, because I think one of the things that Sam and FTX were trying to do, aside from just stifling off all the money that they could, was to put equities on the blockchain, right? And he wanted to get things regulated so that we could see that future. What do you think about that? Is that something that you think there's an appetite for? Is that a future that's even possible given the regulatory stranglehold Wall street has on the equities?
00:20:14.610 - 00:21:36.602, Speaker A: You know, synthetics tried this, right? Synthetix and a few others, not naming any names, Terra, but there were a few people out there who had this idea, right? And again, there's a lot of startup literature that is very dismissive of users. Users are idiots. They don't know what they want, right? Steve Jobs was like the poster boy for this, right? Forget about what you like. If you let users design a phone and have antennas and shit and like 85 cameras, users don't know what they want, right? You got to do what you think is right and then let the users decide if they want that thing, right? You go out and optimize for something, right? And so I think that this idea that users have, right? And there are degents in crypto that still say they want to trade equities, right? And yet you put them on the blockchain and you let them trade them and no one trades them. Now, there's reasons for that and maybe some inefficiencies and liquidity, but there was liquidity. People were not doing it. The only reason why people were trading on mirror equities was because they were yield farming, right? It was just like transaction mining to get tokens in the terra ecosystem, right? I stand by the fact that I say there was no genuine usage, and the same thing is true of synthetics, right.
00:21:36.602 - 00:22:46.670, Speaker A: People were only doing it because there were a couple of liquidity pools in balancer and a few other places. And so I think I've come to a conclusion now, after enough time in the space, that if you create a market for something and no one's trading it, the fact that there was no market before is a really powerful indicator that there is no demand to trade that thing, right? And so sometimes you have to go out on a limb and say, like, okay, let's try this. Let's see. Maybe there was just some weird structural inefficiency in the market that just couldn't allow this thing to happen. And so you go and you kind of do an experiment, but most of the time, those experiments fail because most of the time, the market will solve something if people really want to trade it. And so my theory is that people don't really want to trade equities on the blockchain in the current form that we're talking about now, if you replace the Nasdaq with a blockchain based platform, is that better? Yes, for sure. I think that's a better solution.
00:22:46.670 - 00:23:02.066, Speaker A: And eventually, is that ethereum? Yes, maybe. But that requires Nasdaq to participate. I don't think you can circumvent that and just turn up and be like, oh, we're just going to siphon all the liquidity out of Nasdaq. It's just not going to happen totally.
00:23:02.098 - 00:23:30.794, Speaker B: And that kind of goes back to that parallel of visa and payments. You have to almost improve it in such a drastic way. And maybe that's not the need. So that's very interesting. We alluded to it, but I want to double click into the dgen culture, the wagon culture. How much of an influence were the dGen traders, including Celsius, three arrows, capital, Alameda? The list goes on and on, because in retrospect, to me, it feels like they were all engaging in this big zero sum game, and we were all kind of onlookers.
00:23:30.922 - 00:24:12.038, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, in DFI summer, it's funny, someone tweeted this at me, and I'd forgotten this even happened, right? But back in D five summer, I called out Sam. I was like, dude, how are you putting $100 million into Gam V eight? What's going on? Who is taking the risk on that? Right? And there was this weird implication that I think everyone kind of bought into. And this is crypto, people turn up, right? They turn up, and they turn up wrapped in this mystique and secrecy. And I read. I went back and actually read the Madoff book. There's a lot of made off books.
00:24:12.038 - 00:25:19.550, Speaker A: So I read one of the made up books, right? Because I think that that is the playbook that a lot of these people have taken when they come into crypto, right? You can wrap yourself in this mystique and secrecy, and people are all whispering about all these genius traders just turned up, and they're making all this money or whatever, and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy, right? And it's like, exactly what Madoff did. Madoff took over 20 years, right? Not over, like 20 minutes, but like we do in crypto. But over 20 years, Madoff did this, right? And people were like, oh, I don't want to talk badly about this amazing guy who's got all this power, whatever. So Sam turned up, and he was Alameda. You had heard rumors about these amazing traders of doing all these crazy strategies, making so much money or whatever. I'm sure that there were really obvious arbitrage opportunities early on through 2018, 2019, or whatever, and I'm sure they made some money on that. But when you actually add up the amount of money that they could have made from those things, it's probably in the tens of millions of dollars of profit.
00:25:19.550 - 00:25:37.542, Speaker A: That's my ballpark. Right? And 3 hours is very similar. Right? 3 hours turned up, and people are like, they've got 10 billion under management. And you're like, that's not possible. You can't be a prop trade. Like, where the fuck did that money come from? And yet we all, including myself, were like, it's crypto. Weird things happen.
00:25:37.542 - 00:26:42.746, Speaker A: Like, Yolo, back to your whatever thing. But the obvious answer was the right one, right? Where were they getting the money from? They were getting the money from other people and pretending that it was theirs and doing all of this crazy, degenerate shit and pretending like they had profits that they actually didn't and this is the danger of on chain transactions, right? Like, Alameda was swinging around hundreds of millions of dollars, and people are like, well, there's the money. It's not like someone like Madoff was like, just had a little book that he would write and be like, yes, I did $10 billion of trading today. These guys were actually trading huge size on chain, and that was convincing, and I think got people to buy in. So in Defi summer, there was a lot of that, but there were also genuine early ETH people and Defi whales and stuff that were playing these games. It was very Pvp. But I do think that it wasn't just people that were trading other people's money.
00:26:42.746 - 00:26:59.940, Speaker A: I think there were actually participants in there who were trading their own money. A lot of money was made and lost. There were things that were actually going on. It was genuine activity. Whether it was useful market activity is debatable. But it wasn't all Nexos and Celsius of the world.
00:27:00.710 - 00:27:25.258, Speaker B: Totally. I actually think I remember that tweet, and that's not the first time we've had run ins with this type of person on Twitter. I remember the three arrows capital, when they kind of went after you. And I remember I wrote them on my blacklist, because anyone that goes after a founder like that, it's just shameful, in my opinion. But I would love to kind of understand from your side what was the philosophical difference with that particular run in.
00:27:25.344 - 00:28:21.162, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I've gone back and forth on this a lot in my mind was I subconsciously subtweeting them. I said at the time, I was like, I don't think I had 3 hours in my mind when I tweeted that. Right? I think they were part of it, but it was bigger than just them. And most of the time when I'm calling someone out on Twitter, it's multi point. Like, let's be right. Like, if I'm self tweeting someone, it's almost always. And, you know, the thing that was interesting to me about that is Kyle and I had had all these debates about all of this stuff, and they were deep into Solana and they were doing all this stuff, and there's this kind of opportunistic, very sitting on the sidelines looking, like taking advantage of opportunities, kind of trader investor mentality.
00:28:21.162 - 00:28:47.220, Speaker A: That is okay. The market allows it. It's okay. You don't have to tattoo the ethereum logo on your forearm to participate. Right. I will give multicoin credit. They were there still investing when a lot of funds just stopped, right? And I remember talking to Kyle about buying ETH at like $80 or whatever.
00:28:47.220 - 00:29:29.138, Speaker A: I think we were sitting at like Ecc or something or ETH New York or whatever, and he was like, yeah, I'm going to load up on ETH now. His reason for loading up on ETH was very transparently opportunistic, right? He's like, this thing's undervalued and I don't care about it, really. I just want to make money on it. Mine was like, well, I want ETH because I want the ecosystem to kind of win, right? Then 3 hours turns up. Multicoin has been playing this game for years of just opportunistically supporting new things and not really going all in on something and whatever. And 3 hours is like, hold my beer. You think that you like that? And they just double down on that strategy right now.
00:29:29.138 - 00:30:13.854, Speaker A: Little did we know that they were doing it with other people's money and they were doing all kinds of crazy shit in the background. But it's ultimately the responsibility of people in the ecosystem to call these things out. And it's really hard in crypto to do that. I tweeted that these people were saying one thing, right? And they looked like they were kind of standing by their convictions. But the instant that things shifted, they were going to shift, right? And my thesis was, Ethereum will scale. Like, at the moment, they're just shitting on Ethereum and saying, ethereum is garbage. Go with Salana or go with avalanche or whatever.
00:30:13.854 - 00:30:55.920, Speaker A: The latest l one thing was, and I was really frustrated by that. I was like, fine, competition is good, but you can't just sit here and shit on Ethereum. And then I know in three months time we're going to get scaling is going to start to work and they're going to turn up and be like, Ethereum. Scaling is amazing, right? And the fact that it got such a reaction out of Sue, I think is indicative of the mirror, was he didn't like what he saw right in the mirror and he lost his fucking mind and just lit himself on fire. Now, obviously then they blew up later and we realized that a lot of the stuff that was going on, but there was some cognitive dissonance there. You don't react that crazily to someone. Not even.
00:30:55.920 - 00:31:39.530, Speaker A: I was just subtweeting the group of them, really. So anyway, I've had a bit of an interesting track record of calling people out between Sam, I think I called out Sam right before the FTX blow up where I was like, look, Sam is a very smart guy, which is exactly why you should not listen to anything that he says, because whatever he's saying is silenced. Right? He'silencing you. I've talked to him enough times that I'm like, wait, what do I believe? After you talk to this guy, he can just mentally shift reality around you. So the people that are out there doing that, I think they need to be called out. It's really hard. It's something that we just need to keep trying to do.
00:31:39.600 - 00:31:56.414, Speaker B: Totally. I think a lot of people had similar thoughts around Sam, but no one really felt comfortable enough to call it out. And I think that if the behavior is incentivized, it's going to happen. And so this isn't the last of these kind of characters in crypto. Every bull market will have them.
00:31:56.532 - 00:32:24.140, Speaker C: Looking for a stress free crypto life in 2023. Go selfcustodial with one inch. The one inch wallet aims to be the single app you need to manage crypto. Your one inch wallet will act as a safe box due to hardware wallet connection become your ultimate coin storage when adding custom tokens and offer full versatility. Thanks to multichain support, it's easy to use, secure and selfcustodial. Go ahead and try one inch now.
00:32:24.750 - 00:32:31.558, Speaker B: So I guess, what advice would you have to someone who maybe sees similar signs but is afraid to call it out directly or publicly?
00:32:31.654 - 00:33:05.414, Speaker A: Yeah, and just to be clear, that tweet, I was not saying, like, Sam's a fraud. I was just saying, you can't trust what he says because he's playing a game on a level. He's playing 40 chess, and you're sitting there playing, like, normal chess. Right? It wasn't like, oh, and also, by the way, he stole all your money. I had no idea. When I found out about that, someone was like, do you read the New York Times? And I was like, what are you talking about? This is insane. Right? And so, yeah, I was off Twitter at the time, and I was finding out through mainstream media that this thing was going on.
00:33:05.414 - 00:33:35.130, Speaker A: So I'm not in any way saying that. I had a sense. I would have bet you a million dollars that FTX was not a fraud. Right? I just did not have that sense. And I think this is one of the challenges. Someone who does have some suspicions or thinks that something's not right, you can call it out. But one of the best examples that I ever had was one that I was personally involved in of how hard it is to get to the truth.
00:33:35.130 - 00:34:05.306, Speaker A: On a platform like Twitter. God bless Elon. He thinks that he can get to the truth on Twitter, but I don't think it's a thing. But you. I turned up to Mainnet, right, in New York, got on stage, got off stage, and I was being told that I'd been subpoenaed as I was walking on stage. And I was like, no, pretty sure that's not. Maybe I've forgot about that.
00:34:05.306 - 00:34:18.266, Speaker A: But I don't think that happened. Right. And the reality was that it was Doe. Doe had been subpoenaed as he was walking on stage. But in spite of the fact that there were 50 people standing around who saw this happen, we were all there. We're all in the room. And I was like, this didn't.
00:34:18.266 - 00:34:40.070, Speaker A: It wasn't me. For months and months and months afterwards, people were like, you got subpoenaed, didn't you? And I'm like, I really didn't. I don't know what to tell you. It was that guy. And so it's really, really hard. Even, like, the person who was standing there next to Doe when he got subpoenaed could have gotten on Twitter and been like, I literally just saw it happen. People were like, yeah, sure you did.
00:34:40.070 - 00:35:25.954, Speaker A: It's really, really hard in a space that is as adversarial as crypto and as crazy as crypto, where there's so much stuff going on for someone to call someone out, like, absent, like, direct evidence, and even someone could have tweeted a photo of him getting the subpoena, and people would not have believed it. Right? We're in a reality where it's just really hard to prove things. And so all I would say is, I guess holding people accountable, calling them out, is really helpful, but don't expect that it's going to work and it's going to be successful in the longer term. Eventually, people will blow themselves up. Someone who's just doing messed up stuff is going to blow themselves up. There's no avoiding that. And so eventually, you might get some recognition that you were calling an hour early.
00:35:25.954 - 00:35:29.302, Speaker A: But I'd much rather just not have it happen at all.
00:35:29.356 - 00:35:49.082, Speaker B: Absolutely. I think that's helpful. And I was actually on that panel with Doe, and it's crazy how calm he was during that thing. I would be, like, trembling. Well, I want to shift gears a little bit into synthetics, and maybe for those that are listening that aren't super familiar, could you give them a TLDR and then also just explain why you're so passionate about synthetics yeah.
00:35:49.136 - 00:36:55.146, Speaker A: So synthetics is this ongoing, weird experiment to see whether or not you can do really weird hard stuff on chain is basically what it is, right? It started off as a stablecoin. It evolved into tokenized assets and exchanging of tokenized assets. It's then evolved further into a pseudo lending platform, a perps platform, basically defi infrastructure that supports other things like options, et cetera. So it's this evolving experiment in kind of financial engineering on chain, I guess, is what synthetics really is. That's the reality, right? It isn't any one thing. And I think, why am I passionate about it? Even after taking circa four months off, right. And coming back in the last three weeks, I've been having conversations with people that have been really working on stuff, and I just find myself absorbed by the difficulty of the problem, by just the challenge and the complexity of the problem alone.
00:36:55.146 - 00:37:35.918, Speaker A: I think that people who are interested in hard problems are just drawn to synthetics because it's just still kind of an unsolved problem. Like, we don't know all the answers, we don't know what the optimal way of doing a lot of the stuff that we want to be able to do on chain is. And synthetics is really open about that and just kind of lays it all out there and says, like, hey, we're doing all this weird stuff, and some of it's working, some of it's not, and then we're iterating here. It is a place this kind of like skunk works of just experimentation that is really amazing to watch. So that's my reason for still being excited by synthetics. You never know what's going to come out of it.
00:37:36.004 - 00:37:47.218, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah. And during this entire time, the synthetics ecosystem has really been chugging along, and the community has released a bunch of new products. Can you talk a little bit about maybe the ones you're more excited about?
00:37:47.384 - 00:38:53.858, Speaker A: Yeah. So when we pivoted from Haven, the stablecoin, to synthetics, which was again, like tokenized assets, like tokenized bitcoin, tokenized ETH, so, like ERC 20 versions of all these things that track the price of the external asset. In the same period that that was going on, I had this idea of, we should be able to do a bitmex style perpetual market. How hard could it be? And I was like, hey, we'll just smash this out in like, three months or so and launch it. And it then just dragged out and dragged out and dragged out, and kept getting deprioritized, and for good reasons, bad reasons, organizational reasons, decentralization reasons. There were all kind of reasons, right, of why this happened, why it didn't get the attention and focus that I think that it was supposed to get. And then eventually it got released and years later, right, and it just was kind of not optimal.
00:38:53.858 - 00:39:35.640, Speaker A: The way that we built it was really not optimal. But the nice thing about iterative experimentation is you release something, you're like, oh, right, that was really dumb. Okay, now I get it, right. And even as we were designing this thing, there were a lot of internal debates around how to do it within the community, right? People thought this was a good idea, that was a good idea, et cetera. We've now iterated and iterated and got to a point with perps v two, the latest version that's been released, where we have actually released a bunch of markets. We've got more markets and perps than we've really had, even in the on chain tokenized assets for a long period of time. So we're slowly kind of iterating towards this thing and it's starting to work.
00:39:35.640 - 00:39:59.126, Speaker A: And I think that for this cycle to be successful, we need multiple implementations of perps. People want to trade perps for good or ill. That's what they want to do. They want leverage. They want to be able to trade on margin. And so being able to kind of meet that need within the ethereum ecosystem is critical.
00:39:59.238 - 00:40:10.554, Speaker B: Absolutely. And it does feel like the perp space in Defi is one of the faster growing spaces. And can you talk a little bit about how your product is different than other players like GMX or DYDX?
00:40:10.682 - 00:40:43.098, Speaker A: Yeah. Again, I think the nuances of what's the difference between Bitmex and Okex and whatever, for the average person, they don't really care. Right. It's a bit academic when you talk about centralized exchanges creating perps, right? Like Bitmex invented them, but then people have made little tweaks and whatever. Obviously there are sometimes fairly critical ones, like the FTX perps, they steal all your money. That's a good feature to be aware of. Right.
00:40:43.098 - 00:41:10.018, Speaker A: And so we obviously want to talk about what are the differences and the nuances. But ultimately, for a user, they really don't care. What they care about is liquidity. They care about the trading experience. They care about what is the onboarding process. For me, that's what a user cares about. And those are the things that I think it's important that we have different options and we try different things.
00:41:10.018 - 00:41:38.890, Speaker A: So within DydX, it's kind of a siloed thing, right. It exists in its own kind of almost app chain, silo. Right. Which is cool. And it gives them a number of advantages in terms of onboarding and what they can do with usability and some other stuff, but it obviously doesn't allow for composability. That's something that it kind of prevents. And the jury is still out on how important composability is with perps.
00:41:38.890 - 00:42:45.282, Speaker A: Do you want to be able to use your perp position to collateralize an options thing, or what does that sort of thing look like? But the nuances, I think, in terms of perps that are running on L two s versus perps that are running on something like stockware, like roll up, l two s versus zk, l two s are technically interesting, but to a user, they don't care that much, really. Dydx is probably the best competitor, I would say, to a centralized exchange right now. And part of that is because they've made some compromises in terms of decentralization, in terms of how they achieve that. But that's okay, right? They're not going to steal all your money, so that's good, right? At least you can tick that box of, like, my money is safe. Right. And so I do think that ultimately it's about having competition and about having different options for users. And as you said, we're starting to see that now.
00:42:45.282 - 00:42:56.130, Speaker A: There's probably ten different perps solutions that are out there that I think are going to be ready in the next six to twelve months for mainstream, exciting, amazing.
00:42:56.200 - 00:43:05.302, Speaker B: Well, I would love to shift gears to you personally. I know you've had an on and off relationship with synthetics governance. Can you walk us through that history and where you stand now?
00:43:05.436 - 00:43:45.502, Speaker A: Yeah. So it turns out when you give up power, you lose the power to reclaim power. Right. Like, short of an armed coup, it's really hard for me to have the level of control that I had of synthetic scene back in D by summer even, and even in 2019, we were fairly decentralized. I was not able to do some of the things that I was able to do in 2018. So this has been an ongoing seeding of power to the community. I did find it a little awkward when due to technical challenges.
00:43:45.502 - 00:44:09.210, Speaker A: Right. And there's been a lot of things where I take responsibility that there was a technical challenge and a kind of expedient decision was made and some users kind of got rugged. Right. Where they're like, well, I was kind of hoping to be able to do that or whatever. In this case, I was the user that got rugged. I was unable to vote for like, a year, right, in synthetics governance. Like, I literally didn't even have voting power, right? And that was awkward.
00:44:09.210 - 00:45:02.586, Speaker A: But I still had enough, I guess, kind of cash in the community to get voted onto the council. And then I made a decision that I wasn't going to run for the council and would sort of see what would happen. And it was really interesting because I stopped running for the council. I resigned from the council, and then I watched the DMs flood in from all of the factions being like, they're doing a bad thing to me. And then this person would come in and be like, this guy is a monster. And it was hilarious to watch these things in real time, right, where I was like, I don't think people are so reactive and they get so passionate about it. I'm like, I don't think either of the people on either side of this debate are of monsters, right? I think that there's, like, a nuanced disagreement about some specific aspect of the protocol.
00:45:02.586 - 00:45:49.082, Speaker A: But what has been really interesting in creating that power vacuum has been to sort of see how organically that power vacuum has been filled, right? And I tried to do it too early in the past, and I came back and I was like, okay, this is not working. I need to come back. There's chaos, and someone needs to build a thing, right? You want the people who are building the thing to be directed by the community, and you want the community to have control over what they're building, and you want it to be this kind of two way flow of communication, and that wasn't functioning. And so I was like, all right, we made some mistakes. Iterative experimentation, right? We did an experiment and it blew up, and it was really bad. And we're like, okay, let's go back to the drawing board on that one. And we did, and we got to a point where, as a community, we were like, okay, this is working.
00:45:49.082 - 00:46:52.234, Speaker A: And so, as it stands now, my relationship to synthetics is a large token holder who's kind of watching all of this stuff kind of happen from the sidelines without really much direction. I'm having some conversations, and there's some dialogue with some of the people that are building things, but I haven't even reengaged with discord because I know how much of a black hole that can be in terms of just pulling you in. And at the moment, I'm just trying to kind of get the lay of the land. But synthetics functions perfectly without me, which there's a sadness there, right? Like, tear rolls down the cheek, right? It doesn't need me anymore, and not even in a governance theater, I'm actually in the back room, like wizard of Oz style, like, pulling all the fucking cables and stuff. It really doesn't need me. It hasn't had me for four plus months. And it's done as well, if not better than it would have if I was in there creating chaos.
00:46:52.234 - 00:47:19.590, Speaker A: So I think in that respect, the experiment of decentralized governance has succeeded. That said, there are advantages to having someone who's fairly high profile, who can communicate the narratives for a project. And so I think that that ongoing will probably be my role to help to synthesize what's going on. There's a lot of different threads going on in synthetics, and try and pull that together and communicate it.
00:47:19.660 - 00:47:49.650, Speaker C: Metamask learn is an educational platform designed to immerse you in the world of web three, what it is, why it matters, and how to get started. You will learn core concepts in fresh and engaging lessons from the world's leading selfcustodial wallet. Metamask learn is for you. If you've been interested in web three but just don't know where to start, you've bought some crypto on an exchange, but don't know what to do with it, you still don't understand web three principles because they've been too jargon heavy. And you want to know what the fuss about web three really is.
00:47:49.800 - 00:48:25.658, Speaker B: Yeah, and it makes me think back to that tweet from 3 hours capital where they were kind of criticizing you for leaving the ecosystem, and it goes back to them really not understanding the ethos of decentralization, because that really is the goal. And I think Yaniv tall famously know you treat power like a hot potato and you really want to give it away. But I think this conversation would probably have most executives from traditional finance or board of directors fainting and wondering how you get there and why that's important. So maybe, can you double click on that ethos for maybe someone from the traditional space who's listening to this conversation?
00:48:25.834 - 00:49:55.222, Speaker A: Yeah. When all you have are top down hierarchies, power hierarchies, then everything starts to look like something that needs top down power, right? When that's the only tool you have, you shape things around you to be governed by those things, right? And that is essentially corporate governance with some weird offshoots of things where it's not even like top down hierarchy, it's just like a dictatorship, right? With one guy with super voting rights in 100 years, and his zombie family gets to run it forever. There's some weird things, but essentially these are just top down hierarchical organizations, right, where power flows from the top, and that's it. And holocracy and some other weird stuff that people have tried this and things like that, but we have not had the tools to coordinate humans around the world on the Internet and not have it devolve into chaos. We just didn't have those tools. We kind of don't have them still, but we're pretending like we do, and we're slowly building them in real time and being like, look over here, this is a thing, right? We need to work out how we govern ourselves in ways that are not like top down hierarchies, right? We have to. That's so critical.
00:49:55.222 - 00:51:03.538, Speaker A: And these experiments are important. And so when I look at synthetics, and I've said this for a long time, and it's becoming more and more true every day, synthetics as a governance experiment versus synthetics. Even if synthetics ends up being the dominant perps protocol in D five, let's say, right, and what would that look like? Let's say you take centralized exchanges and the dominant one has 25% or whatever, for a while, there were some anomalies there. I think we've talked enough about FTX, but the market is going to be split amongst, like, three or four winners, and 25% of the perps volume is going to go to protocol, and the people who own that token are going to do really well, and it's going to be super exciting and whatever, right. In terms of the impact on humanity that that has, it's just not that high. I love Bitmex, and it's really cool, but it's not changing humanity. I think that this is the opportunity that all of the OG DeFi protocols have, and I think most of them have taken it.
00:51:03.538 - 00:51:54.958, Speaker A: And the experiments are playing out. We are experimenting on how we coordinate humans globally online, in a way that is kind of enforceable without recourse to a specific jurisdiction and laws and courts and what have you. Right. We're working out a way to get people to coordinate and all work on a thing and have something that's kind of self contained and internally consistent. And if synthetics, the experiments that we've run, if any of those components of those experiments end up being incorporated into future online governance, that's infinitely more valuable than being like, the cool perps protocol for that decade. It's just not even close. So to me, that's really why it was so important to me.
00:51:54.958 - 00:52:03.598, Speaker A: Even if, in doing the experiment, synthetics had failed, the information that was gathered from that experiment, I think, is more valuable than if it had succeeded.
00:52:03.694 - 00:52:34.966, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah. And I think part of the reason why I'm so passionate about this space is because the way we coordinate online and incentivize that coordination can really make huge waves in the world. And if you think about it, all the problems that exist in the world, it's not because we don't have enough of the whatever thing. It's because we can't coordinate to get people what they need. And I think with this technology, if we do these experiments right, over time, we'll actually be able to coordinate food, water, shelter, whatever is needed. I guess that's why I'm so passionate about so many of these experiments.
00:52:34.966 - 00:52:43.230, Speaker B: And you kind of touched on that. What would you say is one of the harder things about being a founder in crypto, maybe tailored to someone who wants to follow a similar path?
00:52:43.670 - 00:53:32.490, Speaker A: I can only speak to myself, and I think one of the things that I've kind of realized over the last six months, having gone to some level of success as a founder, I always thought that this idea of workaholism was, like, kind of a funny joke, right? I was like, yeah, but you need to do it in order to be successful. And there's not really any such thing as, like, a workaholic. Right? This is just like a thing that you have to do, and you just kind of keep grinding. Right? We used to have this joke in synthetics about the death march. We were on a death march, and it's not a joke. You were just grinding every single day, and you would just show up and do the thing. And we're in the office for 80, 9100 hours a week.
00:53:32.490 - 00:54:09.340, Speaker A: It was insane. You're under resource, you're stressed, you're tired. And I think that there's a tendency to kind of lionize the people that are willing to do that. And maybe on some levels that is necessary. Right. There's some level of commitment for a short period of time. But I think as a founder, and again, speaking of my own personal experience, I didn't realize until I took a step back how unhealthy that obsession was.
00:54:09.340 - 00:55:08.238, Speaker A: And I've looked at a lot of aspects of my life. Right. I don't hide the fact that, like, you know, I used to be someone who'd like to do drugs and do chaotic things and, like, run around, you know, being crazy. Right. All of that in my mind, I think kind of comes from a similar place, right, of trying to avoid your own brain. Let me find the hardest problem that I can get absorbed in and just work on that for 90 hours and then collapse into bed and then get up the next day and do that, right? All of that stuff is about how do I avoid dealing with my own mind? How do I not look inwards? How do I just keep looking outwards? And so I think that for me, as a founder, crypto is, and I've seen this happen. I've seen traditional startups, SaaS startups or whatever have aspects of this.
00:55:08.238 - 00:55:45.770, Speaker A: But you touched on it, crypto is 24/7 there's never been a better drug for a workaholic than crypto. It is the best thing that humans have designed for if workaholism is your drug, right? And I say that in a real, this is a real fucking thing. This is not a joke, right? I used to joke about it be like, ha, back to chaining myself to the desk for 18 hours, right? People are crazy. This is not a real thing. Being obsessed with work is dangerous. It's as dangerous as being obsessed with anything else. And crypto has a tendency to suck people in because it can feed an obsession.
00:55:45.770 - 00:56:32.674, Speaker A: If running a SaaS startup or being involved in an early stage startup, online retail startup or whatever is, I don't know, like marijuana, right? On the scale of drugs, crypto is crystal math. You're not fucking around. You're up for 18 days straight and you're scrolling things on the ceiling. You've lost your mind, right? And so I think the one thing that I would say is just be mindful of how crypto taps into whatever obsessive aspects there might be in yourself, right? And it's so easy to ignore. I ignored it for years and years. I was like, ha. Balance.
00:56:32.674 - 00:57:42.320, Speaker A: Whatever you weak people like, what's wrong with you? Go and run into a brick wall 100 times and see what happens. Literally, it was something that I just could not see. I was so resistant to it. And so as I've realized, having done all the things that I wanted to do on some level and been successful and got all this stuff and still unable to kind of sit with myself and face my own brain, that the obsession that I had with crypto and there's healthy aspects like crypto is amazing. All the things we talked about, the power to transform human, all of that stuff is amazing, but you can take something too far and so genuinely, that's the thing that I've really been trying to reflect on over the last few months is how to find a balanced way of getting the good parts without the obsessive parts and not kind of having my inability to kind of sit with myself be transformed into this perverse seeking out of any kind of obsession I could find.
00:57:42.690 - 00:58:17.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I can relate to that as someone who also has been a workaholic since I was about 16. And I feel like for me, I was kind of in this survival mode and just ignoring everything else. But lately, it's no longer survival mode. It's wanting to make a positive impact, wanting to leave the world a better place. And so I guess for you, when you had that transition, any advice for others who are maybe going through a similar transition where you had to take a step back, you looked inward, and now you're coming back to the field and running back in, but maybe in a more balanced way.
00:58:17.952 - 00:58:53.986, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm trying to do it in a more meditative way. And I think the thing that I would say is that I'm in recovery from drugs and alcohol. Right. I genuinely was not anything in my life that I could use to kind of avoid dealing with my own sort of brain, I would use, right. So work was the main thing for years and years. For decades, right. But then if there was, like, a break in the work or they shut down the office, I was like, oh, fuck, what do I do? I got to go and fill my head with chemicals.
00:58:53.986 - 00:59:47.730, Speaker A: Right, to stop from dealing with this. So what I would say is that if you do try to find a balance or you do try to interrogate, look at your intentions, look at your motivations. What is your motivation? And for me, my motivations were mixed. My motivations were all of the things that are exciting about crypto and all of the things that. But perverted into something that was my motivation became to avoid kind of dealing with myself and thinking about how I felt or thinking about what I cared about or what was important to me, all of that stuff just fell by the wayside, and it was just like, find this thing to be obsessed with and focus on. And so I think that is a really hard thing to do. But examining your own motivations is probably the one thing that I would say.
00:59:47.730 - 01:00:31.270, Speaker A: When you really do examine your motivations in a kind of deep and honest way and are open to seeing where your motivations might be skewed towards something that is a bit more obsessive or not as healthy, that's the first step. And then from there, you can be like, okay, what's my motivation for doing a bunch of drugs. I was like, oh, just having fun and doing drugs. Drugs are fun. But it turns out that when you really deeply inspect those motivations and you find out, actually maybe those motivations were slightly different to what I thought they were, that's the first step in kind of unlocking some personal growth and understanding of yourself. So that's what I would say.
01:00:31.340 - 01:00:50.706, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. And I almost feel like collectively in the crypto space, we are kind of shifting to this mental health focus. So it's great you were able to take time and reflect, and I'm proud of you for the journey so far. I'm sure Cammie asked this question, but I'm going to ask it again. Now that you've done your reflection, how are you defiant?
01:00:50.838 - 01:01:28.746, Speaker A: So I've always been defiant. As I said, I think she asked me this question when I was sitting that concrete stairwell or something like that. In 2019, I am defiant in that I believe that what we are doing is the optimal way to coordinate people. I believe that this is, if not the optimal way, it is a more optimal way. Right. It is a way that's in the direction of optimally coordinating people. And historical ways to coordinate people have been infected because we didn't have the technology to do it, and now we do.
01:01:28.746 - 01:02:11.126, Speaker A: We've invented these ways to kind of finally coordinate people online in the form of blockchains. Right? That's Satoshi's thing. Right? It wasn't a payment network. It was this ability to create consensus online. And in order to see that through, you're going to have a bunch of dumb idiots who are not going to like it and who are going to try and stop you and are going to tell you that you are wrong and bad and trading, like, unregistered securities or whatever things they're going to come up with. Right. Whatever their theory is of your rat poison squared or whatever.
01:02:11.126 - 01:02:39.070, Speaker A: But if you truly have the conviction that this is the thing that is going to really allow for another wave of innovation and kind of progress in humanity, then you just need to ignore that stuff and be defiant and just keep pushing and keep doing it. And you know what? If you're wrong, no big deal, right? If we're wrong and made any sense, okay, no big deal. But if we're right, the impact is exponentially more powerful than if you went and just worked at Goldman Sachs.
01:02:39.570 - 01:02:45.374, Speaker B: Absolutely. I love it. Thank you so much, Kane. This was such a great conversation. Really appreciate you coming on.
01:02:45.492 - 01:02:47.260, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, it was great to be here. Thank you.
