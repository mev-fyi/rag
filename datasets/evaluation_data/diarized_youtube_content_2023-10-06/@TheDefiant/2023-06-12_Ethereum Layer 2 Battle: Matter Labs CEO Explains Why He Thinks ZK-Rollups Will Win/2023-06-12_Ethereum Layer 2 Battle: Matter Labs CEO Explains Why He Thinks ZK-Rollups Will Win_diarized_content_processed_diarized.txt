00:00:04.490 - 00:00:44.726, Speaker A: Welcome to the Defiance. I'm your host, Tagan Klein. I'm thrilled to be joined by Alex, the co founder and CEO of Matter Labs, the initial team behind Zksync. Alex is a renowned physicist and entrepreneur. And today we dive into the founding story of Zksync. The launch of Zksync, why they goes to help scale Ethereum, and if they stand by that decision today, the Zksync mission Alpha around getting involved in Zksync today when token as well as new use cases on Zksync and so much more. But first, Alex is going to tell us the founding story of ZK sync.
00:00:44.838 - 00:01:48.318, Speaker B: So the story really begins with my personal experience, at least for me. I grew up in Ukraine, moved to Germany when I was, I think, 20. And I experienced growing up in Ukraine made me realize how important freedom is for the well being, for the prosperity of the society, at each level of the society. And I grew to appreciate freedom more and more and more and more. And at some point, I saw bitcoin and then Ethereum as the most promising technologies that can bring more freedom into this world, make people really, truly sovereign in deepest sense, because the digital assets and digital identity is becoming more and more real. It became more real than your physical assets in some way. And controlling it truly, like having it in your hand, is really important.
00:01:48.318 - 00:02:38.574, Speaker B: And so I thought, this is the place where I really want to be. It's the intersection of the technology, which is one of my passions, and freedom, which is the other one. And I looked, and with bitcoin, it felt like too premature technologically. It just didn't feel like you cannot really onboard 1 billion people into it with managing their own seed phrases and storing it securely and using bitcoin. There was a lot of the cux issues, but Ethereum held a promise to actually deliver this potential of crypto. So I jumped right into it, and I was looking into problems that needs to be solved in order for us to get to the real worldwide mass adoption of Ethereum. And I realized that scalability is going to be the most technologically challenging one.
00:02:38.574 - 00:02:48.466, Speaker B: And then I learned about zero knowledge proofs, and it was clear that it's a perfect match. This is how we solve scalability, and we bring crypto in the hands of basically everyone in the world.
00:02:48.568 - 00:03:06.870, Speaker A: Amazing. And you mentioned, you kind of alluded to it, but there are some core values. There's kind of a core ethos, if you will, of crypto. And there are many new people kind of entering this industry, especially with the NFT boom that we saw. What would you say to those newcomers on some of those core values? What are those?
00:03:07.020 - 00:03:59.974, Speaker B: They are the values that originally come from the cyberpunk movement. I've mentioned freedom, which is the overarching goal. But to get to this freedom, from the technical perspective, you need things like trustlessness, permissionlessness. So you should be able to participate without asking anyone, without the explicit allowance from certain people or groups of people, which actually enables this inclusivity. Everyone can be part of it, and everyone can participate. Then you have security, because if it's trustless and permissionless, but you can be rock pooled tomorrow, it's not really feasible as a solution that has to be secure. Trustless, permissionless, self custodial.
00:03:59.974 - 00:04:09.146, Speaker B: You have to actually own it. You don't want to hand your assets to someone else. So those are the core principles that we build this technology.
00:04:09.328 - 00:04:16.158, Speaker A: Amazing. And I know it can be confusing for some because you have zk sync, you have matter labs. Break it down. What's the difference?
00:04:16.324 - 00:04:50.090, Speaker B: Zksync is the protocol we're building. We started with version one, which is now called Zksync Lite, which was more prototype to demonstrate, to experiment with your knowledge. Proofs show what's possible. And now we're focusing all of our efforts on the Ziki sync era protocol. And Metalabs is just the company behind it. It's a company, it's an organizational forum that created these protocols and will eventually be just one of the many contributors into this technology, the network that we're building. But actually, it's more than a network.
00:04:50.090 - 00:05:23.678, Speaker B: It's very similar to Ethereum. It's a movement, it's an extension of Ethereum. It's scaling Ethereum to the extent of the real world, which is our mission. And we have a very clear vision how we get to this. 1 million transactions per second, or 1 billion users. It's a very clear path technologically, but it only works if the community organizes and solves the nontechnical issues. And I think that it's very important that we have this idea of community ownership in crypto.
00:05:23.678 - 00:06:29.946, Speaker B: So, like, all the code we build is fully open source. Everything we do is we try to rely to the greatest extent possible on cryptography and pure math and pure coding, which with open source, everyone can verify themselves. So that we get to this trustlessness, like avoiding the trust and validators, at least for the most critical pieces of the puzzle, which is security and this trustless resilience. By the way, I forgot to mention one really important key property of the systems is they are resilient, not just against potential attackers like your usual hackers and whatnot, but against very powerful forces of this world. You can withstand if you have your bitcoin on Ethereum key. The supernations like us, China and Russia, and all these countries combined cannot really decipher it. If they use all the supercomputers of the world, it puts an individual in a very, very powerful position.
00:06:29.946 - 00:07:18.834, Speaker B: So resilience is one of the things, and it comes with this community that backs the system, because if something goes wrong, Matterlabs is just a company. Something can happen to this company, it can get dissolved, the people can get evil. This happens all the time. Over time, people change. You want the community to be the guardian of the values. And if something is not working, the community should take the lead, fork the system and keep it in, migrate to this new deployment, and keep everything on the path towards the values, towards the vision that was originally created. And so the community is really the key piece of the resilience point, totally.
00:07:18.882 - 00:07:44.142, Speaker A: And it feels like governments aren't really liking that we're giving so much power and control back to individuals, at least it seems at the moment, which is kind of interesting and ironic, because at least here in the US we used to be pro freedom, but it feels as though day after day more politicians on both sides are advocating against freedom and for more control at the government level. Any comments or thoughts about that?
00:07:44.276 - 00:08:53.366, Speaker B: Well, I think there are different politicians and some are more pro freedom. They are keeping this conservative or not conservative, like this traditional approach coming out of the spirit of the declaration of the US independence and the US constitution. Then there are of course opposing forces, and there are a lot of incentives for those forces to be opposing. I think the only solution to this is for the citizens to demand, to stand to their rights and actually enforce their rights and go and say, like, we're going to use this and we're going to be opposing, we're going to be calling our representatives and pushing this on the political side, but also we want to create something very resilient on the technological and societal side that the politicians can't really attack. And we have a few examples of where this popular movement actually won over the opposing forces with the politicians. One interesting example, which is very close to what we're doing, is the Bittorrent. You remember the war on Bittorrent where you have to pay one dollars per song to download it, which was a completely unsustainable and unnatural model.
00:08:53.366 - 00:09:39.202, Speaker B: And people just started using torrents to download the songs for free in the movement of a protest. And then the companies and these powerful copyright agencies had to give up eventually and come up with more modern things like Spotify, Netflix models came out of it, which were much more reasonable. This is what we want. We want to find a balance which is going to be more beneficial for the individual, for the people. And this is what's happening when you actually fight for your rights through the use of technology. This has been the history of human civilization and of technological progress for the past couple of millennia.
00:09:39.266 - 00:10:03.406, Speaker A: Absolutely. And it's why censorship resistance at the protocol level is so crucial. And you mentioned that there are some nontech issues that need solved. Can you double click on what those are? Just because there's this common misconception that you have to be an engineer to enter crypto, and that's not true. So maybe for an audience who is less engineer minded, what are those problems that need solved on the nontechnical side?
00:10:03.508 - 00:10:52.734, Speaker B: Well, what we're building is the protocol. It's basically the IP of this new emerging Internet of value, as we call it, like the web three, a network that is capable of transferring and programming value and things around value. So our mission is just to build this basic layer, the basic brick of this protocol, which is what connects different applications. Now someone else has to build the applications. This requires a lot more work than just engineering work. You have to think through the problem, you have to talk to the customers, you have to understand their needs, you need to design the system, market it, sell and get investment, get a lot of people organized. So that's a lot of work.
00:10:52.734 - 00:11:40.442, Speaker B: And there are startups, there are companies that are building this, there are ecosystem services around all of that. And then there is a lot of just general needs for educating people, for creating learning materials, for talking to politicians, explaining all those things. It's a very broad movement. Even if you participate just by using these systems and sharing some feedback and putting your money and stake in there, you're already contributing. So it's a cycle. This is what happened to the Internet. In the early days of the Internet, a lot of people did not believe that it will take off.
00:11:40.442 - 00:11:58.702, Speaker B: Some people were stating that Internet will have no more impact on the world than a fax machine. It was not obvious. A lot of companies were very late to embrace Internet. They thought like, no one is going to be purchasing things online. This is insane. No one is going to be doing contracts online. You need like a physical signature.
00:11:58.702 - 00:13:08.546, Speaker B: And all of these things changed. So what I believe deeply is that web three is going to do to the world of value a similar thing that the Internet did to the world of information. That basically everything that touches value will go on chain and will become programmable, like from payments to trading, to all the stocks and assets that are tradable, to property titles, to invoices, to bonus points and tickets and so on and so on. And then first these things will be just mimicking the world pre blockchain, and then we'll see things that were not thinkable before blockchain. And NFTs is one of them, right? This is something you can create a piece of. You can put a piece of paper saying like, you have a title to this great painting, right? And then it could be tradable. But it was not possible before to have this piece owned by 10,000 people, or to have a group of people with shared identity, because they are part of this club and now it's exclusive.
00:13:08.546 - 00:13:36.130, Speaker B: And now maybe they share values and they could coordinate and actually do some collective action. And it's all programmable. And the rules are immutable, or at least the rules are pre agreed upon. And if you have to change them, you have to follow a certain procedure which is enforced mathematically. This is amazing. This is this innovation wave that will be happening. And I'm really excited to see where it will get us, but it will definitely be something no one can envision.
00:13:36.130 - 00:14:05.210, Speaker B: Vitalik, I think in one of the interviews, said he did not see the NFT wave coming because it's kind of counterintuitive, right? That's what defines the great innovation. It's unknown. I don't know what's coming. I know what I need to do to enable that. And this is what we're working on with Zksync. We have our narrow focus. We don't want to go, and we don't want to become with Matterlabs, with the team, behind the core team, behind CK sync.
00:14:05.210 - 00:14:58.106, Speaker B: We don't want to be something like Google or Facebook, or like one of these huge mega companies with thousands of people. We don't want to grow beyond 150 people, like a small tribe where everyone still knows everyone else. We really want to focus on one thing and do it really, really well. And we want everything else to be done by others. Because what it means is this Ethereum culture of subtraction. This is what Ethereum foundation promoted very actively and is following honestly through of like, we have our thing, this is our mission, and we want to empower other people and other teams and other organizations to contribute to build some great stuff on top of that. So this is why zk sync will initially, as a movement, I want to see it credibly neutral, not taking sides, not promoting certain projects over the others.
00:14:58.106 - 00:15:49.626, Speaker B: This is what we will be building initially, and we expect the community to embrace this value and carry it forward. And we want to see other people building stuff on top of it. And we actually see a lot of traction. We see a lot of things being built on Ziki sync now. We have, I think, tens of thousands of smart contracts already deployed. We have hundreds of projects that we know about, a lot of them new, a lot of them are existing Ethereum projects that are just about to deploy a lot of the OGs, the Defi blue chips, the NFT blue chips are in the process of deploying or have already deployed and rolling out the applications. But we also see a lot of really interesting novel use cases, in part because Zksync enables it.
00:15:49.626 - 00:16:02.298, Speaker B: We have introduced some features, and we'll always be introducing some features that you will not see anywhere else that are unique to what we're doing there. And we're really excited to see people using those features.
00:16:02.394 - 00:16:27.394, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah, it's all about empowering the ecosystem and community, more than one company. So it's great that you're kind of walking the walk and talking the talk as well. And so you've been building for a really long time and you chose to help scale Ethereum, and back then there were less layer ones. Do you still stand behind the decision to support Ethereum as opposed to maybe other layer ones, like a Solana as an example?
00:16:27.532 - 00:17:26.858, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely. Well, apart from the fact that we now have more TVL than Solana at the moment, the ethereum ecosystem was an obvious choice because it shared the values very deeply with us. The values that we talked about previously, trustlessness, resilience, censorship, resistance, permissionlessness, they are embedded into Ethereum architecture. Like all the design decisions that the Ethereum core team is making are judged against those principles very deeply. Honestly, the Ethereum emphasizes decentralization over throughput because that's the job of a layer one, to make the most resilient, most secure, most decentralized network. Whereas in my opinion, decentralization is not a value per se. A lot of people talk about we want to decentralize, we want a decentralized platform.
00:17:26.858 - 00:18:46.600, Speaker B: I think it's a means to an end. It's an important means. I don't know how else you can achieve that, but to be truly resilient, you need to decentralize at a technical level with hundreds of thousands of full nodes as Ethereum and validators that Ethereum network has, and on top of that, with a very broadly decentralized community, with a lot of contributors, with a lot of organizations and teams and individuals and stakeholders who are standing for Ethereum values and for this culture, this ecosystem. And so yeah, Ethereum is focusing more than any other l one on these core fundamental properties. Now it lacks scale precisely because of these limitations. And this is our job with this additional piece of technology, which is really one of the most amazing technologies I've ever encountered in my life, in the beauty, how it's internally structured, which is zero knowledge proofs or succinct zero knowledge proofs. They used to be called the magic moon math because it feels like magic is when something works that seemingly should not, right? Like you open the box and all of a sudden there is a rabbit in the box and you don't expect this.
00:18:46.600 - 00:19:26.114, Speaker B: This is why people have this all feeling towards your knowledge. Proofs. You can prove an execution of millions of operations and you can verify it in just a few simple arithmetic operations on an elliptic curve or just in primary fields. And just very basic math gives you a result which proves that a ton of work has been done very isometrically and with very high degree of probability. You can be sure that this is correct. And when I say high degree of probability, astronomic probability. So it's basically like you have a guarantee that it's correct.
00:19:26.114 - 00:20:17.650, Speaker B: So that's our contribution scale. We just make ethereum scalable to like our, our ultimate mission is to get us to unlimited scale, to boundless scalability. And this has a very precise definition, like keeping all the other properties as they are, security, trustlessness, resilience, censorship, resistance, permissionlessness. We need to get to a point. Basically we're building the Internet, so we need to be like the Internet. The Internet is not limited by you can have like 1000 users simultaneously accessing a website. It doesn't make sense, right? You should be able to add more servers, more hardware, more routers, more Internet connections to extend it, basically without any limits.
00:20:17.650 - 00:20:57.866, Speaker B: This is what we're building with ZK sync. You cannot achieve it with a monolithic blockchain. It's just physically not possible. You can't imagine Internet, all of the websites and services and databases of the Internet running on one single server, right? Or even in one single data center. That's not feasible. You need more. In a similar way, what we're building is going to be like this network of extensible blockchains, but then fully, seamlessly interconnected, just like email, you have your address on one domain and you can send email to any other address on any other domain.
00:20:57.866 - 00:21:10.994, Speaker B: And it works like point to point. You don't have additional overhead in terms of effort you need to do to send this email or trust assumptions or don't have to pay extra or wait much longer.
00:21:11.112 - 00:21:59.986, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I love your point on kind of choosing Ethereum because if the Ethereum ecosystem shares your values, and I think that that's a really important point for listeners to double click into because it is important. Right? And as you think about building in the space or joining a project in the space, make sure that the projects have the values that Alex outlined because it really is crucial to the movement and how far you'll go and the network effects you'll build. So with that, I want to get to the ZK seeks launch in a moment, but before we do, I want to double click because there's many founders that are listening. You did an incredible fundraise, you brought in a lot of top VCs, and I know that you turned a couple VCs that were originally no's that maybe passed on the deal into yeses. Tell us how you did that.
00:22:00.168 - 00:22:42.666, Speaker B: Very simple, we shipped. So basically we went to Andreessen Horowitz and we pitched the idea of building a zkavm. We said, we believe this is possible from going from where we are with application specific rollups, very rigid, just doing one function to deploy any contract that you can write for Ethereum. And they passed and we were shocked because we thought the pitch is very strong. And then we backchanneled and it turned out that they asked Dan Bonet, probably the most significant cryptographer, the most highly quoted cryptographer living today in the world, and he said, this is not feasible. This will take like five years. And this is why they passed.
00:22:42.666 - 00:23:26.678, Speaker B: And we were like, okay, we built the first prototype and half a year later we showed them the prototype and they're like, oh. And then, so then they organized a meeting with Dan Bonet. And then we explained the idea to him, we explained how we did this. What's the trick? What are the certain design decisions that we took that enabled us to go from this highly inefficient, in performance wise, zero knowledge proof protocols that we had back then to building this solution? And he was like, oh, this makes a ton of sense. And we're like, of course it makes a ton of sense. And then we closed this round without a pitch tag. You want to work on the problem that people want to see solved and you want to ship your one.
00:23:26.678 - 00:23:32.330, Speaker B: You need to demonstrate that you can do it and that you can do it better than existing solutions.
00:23:32.410 - 00:23:47.426, Speaker A: Totally. And it's not just shipping, but it's also updating and having that persistence to kind of go back and continue communicating, which hats off to you for doing amazing. So tell us about the recent launch. How did it go? Any lessons learned?
00:23:47.618 - 00:24:20.430, Speaker B: Well, we're very excited. We are now the third largest l two on ethereum in terms of TVL. We're very humbled by such a broad interest from the user community, from developer community, from all the people who are building on Zksync. And there is a grassroots movement around. I see lots of accounts on Twitter explaining, sharing materials, explaining how Zksync works, explaining how features, architecture is functional. We get in touch with them. I'm very impressed.
00:24:20.430 - 00:25:11.422, Speaker B: We have very high transaction volumes. We are actually number two most used L two on Ethereum as of today, for the past month, for the entire month. I think if you go to ltob.com and click on activity, you can see that I think we are at 17 million transactions versus arbitrum has 25 million transactions last month, and everyone else is like below eight, which is very interesting because those transactions are not cheap. Today you still have to pay for the data availability to Ethereum, which is very non negligible. Transaction costs somewhere between like thirty cents and maybe $3, depending on the gas fluctuations on Ethereum. So these costs will go down a lot.
00:25:11.422 - 00:25:56.122, Speaker B: We are working on lowering them further from where they are today, and in the very short term you will see significant updates to this. On top of that, Ethereum itself is working on the solution called EAP 4844 or like protodunk sharding, which will lower the costs for all roll ups, for all l two s by, I don't know, by an order of magnitude, at least by like ten times or 25 times. We will see how exactly, but the costs will go down. It will be more cheap, even more cheap. And so we'll see probably a lot more users and use cases and activity. And this is a very exciting thing. Like Ethereum is clearly on the rise with all the L two s and specifically with ZK sync.
00:25:56.186 - 00:26:02.586, Speaker A: Absolutely. And with that, do you think that zk roll ups will flip optimistic roll ups, like what arbitram and optimism are using?
00:26:02.708 - 00:26:36.534, Speaker B: I think that eventually, in a very near term, everyone will be able to see the abyss between what optimistic roll ups and what zk roll ups are capable to offer. So I think in the long term it's likely that we'll mostly have zk roll ups on Ethereum. Maybe optimistic projects will pivot at some point. It will take them a long time. It's not trivial. It's not that you can just take an optimistic engine and supplement it by ZK. You have to actually rearchitect.
00:26:36.534 - 00:28:03.302, Speaker B: It's like if you're building a Zeppelin and you want to add a jet engine to it, then you actually need to get rid of this big thing and add wings and the proper air design. And it's not trivial. You have to rework things from ground up, but that is necessary for them. I think they all realize by now, many of the optimistic roll up projects realize that they fulfill a very important function today, but tomorrow they will have to leave way to ZK rollups, just because the properties that Zikolab give you, like the lower latency of transactions, much, much lower cost for a lot of use cases, much higher security, much better bridgeability. This extensibility of the network where you can go like building what we call hyperchains, other l two S and l three s that are all interconnected, is only seamlessly possible with zk roll ups. So from all these perspectives, zk roll ups are, and we have not even started talking about ZK Porter and data availability problem, which offers another dimension of discussion, which we probably don't want to go now because it's going to be very deeply technical, but just in the very short term, it will be obvious how more powerful ZK roll ups are.
00:28:03.356 - 00:28:17.978, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I want to get into how the different layer twos will work together in a moment. But before we do, just maybe for a founder listening, who's about to go through a launch, can you give your top three pieces of advice of what you would give to them just given that you went through it?
00:28:18.064 - 00:29:18.590, Speaker B: That's a really good question. I would just do a lot of things like focus on the problem, start with the right problem, pick the right problem in the right market. That's going to be the single most important decision you make that will affect you much more than any other fluctuations inside the market. If you are building an orange stand, orange juice stand, then no matter how much effort you put in, you're never going to build something that affects like 1 million people. Right? So market and the problem are the most critical pieces. So that would be advice to myself like ten years ago when I was doing other startups, and from there I would focus on building and get, there are two types of people. Nassim Taleb, which, who I highly recommend, like all of his books, even though he's a little bit of a difficult personality and you can feel it throughout the books, but he has brilliant ideas.
00:29:18.590 - 00:30:10.110, Speaker B: He says very undiplomatically, there are builders and there are BS sellers. So as a founder, you want to surround yourselves by builders. You want your team to be mostly like, at least in this initial phase, will be mostly focused on building stuff, on getting things done, on getting people who have this mentality of like, I'm just going to sit down and do it no matter what. Somewhat like this reality distortion field that was attributed to Steve Jobs. There are some people, they don't see obstacles, they just believe they can get it and they go and get it and eventually, somehow it gets done. So you want those people and you don't want a lot of them, you want a few and just focus on the problem and build something and demonstrate that you can do stuff. This is what worked for me and what I can recommend from my experience.
00:30:10.260 - 00:30:24.722, Speaker A: I love that. And the best of us are difficult personalities at times. And so there's base, there's optimism, there's arbitrary and polygon EVM. How will these layer twos work together as we kind of develop into the future?
00:30:24.776 - 00:31:18.302, Speaker B: From your standpoint, we all have kind of friendly relationships. We meet at conferences, we discuss things, we cooperate on the standards, on the way we do contributions to Ethereum. So for example, we were working on the account abstraction piece and Ethereum core team proposed the idea of AP 4337. We took it as a base, we worked on it, we made some contributions. We actually had more freedom at Zksync to develop it, to build it as a native protocol. So we had less limitations than the Ethereum core team, but some of the things we built were they really liked and they took it back to the protocol, like upstream, and they found their way to the canonical 457 implementation. And other l two teams are doing the same things.
00:31:18.302 - 00:32:04.834, Speaker B: I see a lot of cooperation going on. Eventually we're all going to win when Ethereum wins and the users win as a result of this competition of ideas and also cooperation and common contribution. I'm very positive and optimistic on this side in terms of how these protocols work together. What's going to happen to the protocols? Well, we'll see some applications deploying on some of them, some applications deploying on all of them, and then the users choosing what's best for them in terms of the feature set, the cost of transactions, the latency, security properties and other considerations. So I think it's going to be a very healthy dynamics of figuring out.
00:32:04.872 - 00:32:13.922, Speaker A: What works best and then talking about competitive positioning. How does Zksync compare to starkware and Polygon EVM?
00:32:14.066 - 00:33:04.582, Speaker B: So with Starkware, I think it's very different. Starkware is generally somewhat aside from all the other l two scaling solutions that are now popular because they are not really evm compatible. And even though there are some projects building evmish compatible things on Starknet, it's not going to be native part of the protocol. It's going to be like on top of Kyra, on top of the other ecosystem. So they're building their own ecosystem with their own fan base, and they're experimenting with this new language, which is interesting, but it's just a part. So there is EVM world and Starknet, so I'm not going to talk about that much. In the EVM world, we are taking the technology furthest along the innovation line.
00:33:04.582 - 00:34:13.450, Speaker B: So from all those projects, we are kind of taking the most radical approach on like, let's imagine what we can build on. L two, that you cannot otherwise build on Ethereum and that you cannot build with. What superpowers do we get from this beautiful zero knowledge proofs which other protocols are not quite doing? What I see them doing is focusing much more on backwards compatibility. If you look at arbitram, optimism, polygon, scroll, they all emphasize this backwards facing, like, let's support EVM on the bytecode level, let's support all the opcodes exactly as everything should work, exactly as it works on layer one, which has value because it lowers the friction for developers. It gives you kind of like certain security guarantees on certain types of applications. It makes things easier to debug. Some tooling will work on this kind of application, which will not work on zk sync.
00:34:13.450 - 00:35:25.874, Speaker B: But in doing that, they are kind of missing out on the opportunity to innovate. So, like, one example is account abstraction, which we do natively, which means that all accounts are account obstructive. Like, all accounts are smart on ZKsync, whether you have, like, you can have a metamask and you can still have a multicol, it's possible to build an application with multicolored or with using paymasters, so that the protocol is going to be paying for you. So you can have guestless transactions with metamask, or you can have transactions where you're paying in any token, not just in a specific one, not in ether or magic or some ziki sync token, whatever you can choose if you only have Dai or USDC and you want to make a simple payment, why should you bother of getting some other tokens and using them? You should be able to just pay a fraction of a cent. This is how we onboard 1 million users or the next 1 billion users to the ecosystem, where they don't even think about it as a blockchain. They don't think like, oh, this is blockchain. So I have to download this.
00:35:25.874 - 00:35:52.118, Speaker B: A friend of mine, I can give you a more specific problem. He was paid in crypto, he was promised, he did some consulting work, and he got 1000 USDC as a result of this work. So he was told like, you need to create ethereum accounts. He was like, okay, he created something, I don't remember, like trust wallet or metamask. He got that. He got the address, he gave the address to the employer. They sent him thousand USDC.
00:35:52.118 - 00:36:27.810, Speaker B: And then he said to me, okay, how do I get it to my bank account and start paying for things? I said, okay, you have to send it to an exchange. He said, I tried to send it to an exchange, but it says that I don't have enough funds to send it, but how is it possible? I have $1,000 there. I had to explain to him that, well, this is not quite there. You need to convert this to ether, and then you have to pay this gas in ether. And this is how it works. He said, I know, I've been told that already. So I tried to convert it from USDC to ether, but it said, I cannot convert it because I don't have ether.
00:36:27.810 - 00:37:18.046, Speaker B: How do I get ether in the first place? This kind of case 22 situation is like, you can't really onboard 1 billion people. If you have ux like this, it has to be like seamless. On ZK sync, it will be seamless. You just go and you go to uniswap and you convert from USDC to whatever you want, or you just make a payment and you pay like five cents, five USDC cents for this transaction or whatever the amount is, right? This is just one example. We're innovate. The other examples are coming very soon with the differences in the architecture, how we work with data availability, the differences in how we process transactions. Like, we're not using gas, for example, so we're not going to have all the limitations of gas.
00:37:18.046 - 00:37:42.094, Speaker B: We built a new full client, like full node from scratch in rust, which is a lot more performant, has a lot of other properties that you cannot get from the old technology. So this is our positioning, we are the most future proof, future compatible. If you want chain from all the L two s on Ethereum in the EVM camp.
00:37:42.292 - 00:37:51.490, Speaker A: And you mentioned that you're focused on new use cases within the ZK sync ecosystem. Can you tell us a little bit about what those use cases are? What are you excited about?
00:37:51.640 - 00:38:49.766, Speaker B: Sure. So with account abstraction, one very basic use case is just to have a smart wallet that is not depending on a seed phrase and that you can use to make normal payments. And basically that is acting as your bank. We're not doing something that is outside of what's generally possible on blockchain. So the use cases are around things that you're familiar with or in the areas of DFI, NFTs, identity. We will have a lot of really interesting things with privacy, because privacy will come much, much cheaper on Zksync than on any other l two s like EVM compatible l two s that are using call data and not state divs. Because on ZK sync you don't have to pay for publishing zero knowledge proofs, you only pay for verifying them.
00:38:49.766 - 00:39:38.974, Speaker B: And this is cheap. This is going to be like a fraction of a cent. So you will be able to natively build applications that take advantage of the native out of the box support for zero knowledge proofs. And so we work also not just with blockchain or crypto native projects. We work a lot with the traditional enterprises. And I was surprised by the degree of interest we get from the banks, from the most innovative countries in the world, like Switzerland and Singapore and UK, from big corporations, from big payment providers, from supply chain companies who are now looking. They realize now that all the previous attempts of building their own intranets of blockchains failed.
00:39:38.974 - 00:40:08.234, Speaker B: And they want to be on Ethereum, they want to be part of this global emerging Internet of value. And that's the only way how you can actually build stuff as though it was not obvious after the Internet adoption. And they are looking for l two s because obviously they cannot do it on l one. For the use cases that they bring, they need millions of people and millions and hundreds of millions of transactions per second, eventually, cumulatively, the total throughput. So we have a full spectrum of these use cases.
00:40:08.282 - 00:40:16.174, Speaker A: Yeah, permission blockchains don't work. Who would have thought? Amazing. And tell us a little bit about how privacy will work on Zksync.
00:40:16.222 - 00:40:53.034, Speaker B: So, as I said, we are focusing on the scalability. We're building the IP layer of this protocol, of this Internet of value. Someone else has to build SSL or HTTPs on top of this IP protocol. Right. Our job is to make sure that the computation and data availability are properly structured to incorporate privacy is very computationally and data intense. So the data has to come kind of for free. It should not go on chain, it should be embedded in your transaction, then discarded.
00:40:53.034 - 00:41:51.422, Speaker B: And computation has to be extremely cheap so that you can process not only privacy. There are more cases that are enabled by ZK, like think fully homomorphic encryption and multiparty computation and machine learning like ZKML, where things will be eventually, like not today, this is very early. But maybe that's why it's very interesting where you will be able to put AI on blockchain and prove that certain things are computed. The outputs of these AI computations are what people actually want them to be, and they were not manipulated because otherwise you cannot see it from. You can distinguish the truth from fake today with all these powerful technologies. So our job is to empower builders to create those protocols with really, really cheap transactions and very high throughput. That is what we're focusing on.
00:41:51.476 - 00:42:04.638, Speaker A: And how will that look in a world where we have privacy? Because I feel like a big reason why DeFI took off was because of the transparent nature to defi. So how do you envision that kind of evolving once we have the ability to have private transactions?
00:42:04.734 - 00:42:47.380, Speaker B: I don't see a contradiction. I think that you will have. I saw really interesting protocols where you have private accounts held in this private pool, which is opaque and not visible from outside. Like you can transact privately there, but then those accounts can actually go on the DFI and interact with DFI in a way that just no one knows who made this interaction. Obviously you will see on chain that someone has swapped ten ether for USDC on uniswap. But you will not know who. And then those people will be able to.
00:42:47.380 - 00:43:45.010, Speaker B: They will be able to go and pay a merchant on the street from their wallet without disclosing to the merchant what's the amount on their wallet, which is like, otherwise it's not feasible. You cannot have a Twitter for your bank account and just publicize to everyone, to all the world, how much assets you have, all the purchases you made, who you transact with, where you get your salary from, all of that has to remain private. Now you have regulatory challenges around that, how you keep it far from abuse, so that you don't get in a situation of tornado cash. And I have seen some proposals. I don't know what the eventual solution is going to be. I think it's too early to comment, but I see people innovating and trying different approaches. I think some of them will work because you need to keep full privacy and it's inevitable that there will be some abuse.
00:43:45.010 - 00:44:23.018, Speaker B: How much abuse is it going on with cash on the streets? But you don't ban cash because of that? Or how many people are, I don't know. Criminals use the cars to get to the spot of crime, but you don't ban cars because of that. So you just want to make sure that the good use cases that everyone realizes that are good are dominant, that we have a lot more good things going on on blockchain than bad things. And then I think it's going to be acceptable for everyone that you need privacy. It won't work otherwise.
00:44:23.114 - 00:44:35.306, Speaker A: Totally, yeah. And it's definitely a fundamental human right, privacy. And you mentioned that there are new dapps that have emerged on ZK sync. Can you tell us about those? Maybe some dapps that aren't on other chains.
00:44:35.438 - 00:45:02.870, Speaker B: I just don't want to call out some of them and not call the others and give favors. Here we have a comprehensive list of projects that are deploying. We have an ecosystem page where we do our best to enable everyone to put their project there. I would encourage people to go to ecosystem Gksync IO and you will check it for yourself.
00:45:02.960 - 00:45:10.906, Speaker A: Fair enough. And then talk to us a little bit about maybe some of the challenges that you've had to overcome while heading towards the launch.
00:45:11.098 - 00:45:47.674, Speaker B: Towards the launch. We mostly had just engineering work, so it was like we had to focus, we had to speak less publicly because we needed. It's hard to hire engineers who are good. And we have a very high bar at Matterlabs. So it's like we are over 100 people now and it's hard to hire more people. So we needed everyone who can code to code and to really focus on that. And we kind of disappeared from the public discourse space for a few months, which we had to do.
00:45:47.674 - 00:46:19.114, Speaker B: So we will always be prioritizing shipping over talking now. We want to talk about things. We want to explain what we're building and we want to get people engaged and we will be doing that. But building things has a priority. The difficulties were like of technical challenge. You have to build things properly. There is a huge responsibility in terms of security building these protocols because we've launched on Mainnet the very first Zkavm.
00:46:19.114 - 00:47:03.282, Speaker B: No one has ever done that before. It's a completely unchartered, untested territory where you have an entirely new vector of potential attacks on this system. So you want to build? We can't afford a single security incident. So we had to think out of the box, like how we're going to protect it, not just building, investing a lot into thinking about how to design system in a secure way and auditing it. And we spent more than, I think, any other l two. We spent a couple of million dollars on the audits with the top tier auditors and big security contests from crowdfunded public security. But that was not enough.
00:47:03.282 - 00:48:01.634, Speaker B: We introduced additional in depth protection measures, like in the initial period. Now, while the project has training wheels on, the withdrawals are kind of delayed by 24 hours, so that even if there is any compromise with proof systems or the cryptography itself, we still have time to intervene and take some protective measures. There are other things. So there was a lot of engineering and product work flowing into the system before it could be launched fully publicly. A lot of testing, a lot of iteration, like actual testing with the public projects. Like we opened the network to developers a bit earlier than we opened it to the users, so the developers have time to test it under real conditions on Mainet and also report problems and so we could calibrate and fix them and so on. So mostly like problems of this type, I can't think of just growing.
00:48:01.634 - 00:48:08.614, Speaker B: The company has its own challenges, which every company at our stage faces. So nothing special there.
00:48:08.812 - 00:48:18.262, Speaker A: Totally. And sequencing is so important. And how are you guys thinking about data availability? Will you use something like an Eigen layer or maybe a Celestia?
00:48:18.406 - 00:49:07.226, Speaker B: So the Eigen layer is interesting. It's just a very interesting idea for using Ethereum security. This is something we can consider. Celestia is basically in terms of data availability. My understanding is it's competing somewhat with Ethereum itself, because you have to be like, in order to create a native roll up on Celestia, you have to kind of be your own layer, one which I think is hard to accomplish. If you use Celestia in the same way as Eigen layer, which is the same way as we designed Ziki Porter, then it could make sense. But it's not really in line what Celestia strategically positioning themselves for.
00:49:07.226 - 00:49:21.546, Speaker B: So we will be exploring that. But in any case, we will pick something that is most beneficial for the ecosystem, for the broader ecosystem. We want to find way to make it win win for all partners.
00:49:21.738 - 00:49:34.482, Speaker A: Absolutely. And when you look at the web three stack, what would you say is missing? We have decentralized indexing, we have decentralized storage. Are there any pieces that maybe listeners should think about building that are missing for sure.
00:49:34.536 - 00:50:26.238, Speaker B: Decentralized front end and decentralized, which is an obvious third component which is missing there. If you have decentralized front end which can access decentralized indexing and decentralized transaction network, then you've gone full circle. Then you kind of have all around solution that is fully resilient. We are very close there, right? Like you could own an ens or unstoppable domain which will point you to IPFs or RVF, and with something like a brave browser you will be able to open the page without any servers. And then you have your front end there. And then you could probably use the graph for decentralized querying. I'm not sure what you would use for decentralized transaction sending.
00:50:26.238 - 00:51:22.210, Speaker B: I don't think we are quite there yet in terms of being able to actually transact from this application. And I think this is what breaks everything. And this is why very few people are doing this, because what's the point of having decentralized front end and decentralized backend with smart contracts which have to go through a centralized API of infura or alchemy or like any other centralized provider. So I think this kind of, this provider layer decentralization, the access to the actual nexus to blockchain is the missing part. And once we nail that, the website for Zksync is going to be decentralized in this way. So it will actually be owned by the community, not by a single organization. There will be some kind of dao that controls this ens domain.
00:51:22.210 - 00:51:43.086, Speaker B: And then the DAO decides what goes on this website and kind of has a voting process with updates going through, I don't know, some delegation. It's really interesting what you can do in the governance field. It's a whole huge area of its own development, which I'm observing with great interest.
00:51:43.188 - 00:51:48.846, Speaker A: Amazing. And when token, I know that that's a big question that many have for you.
00:51:49.028 - 00:52:24.906, Speaker B: Well, it's not something we're focusing on today, because that's not the burning problem. The burning problem is to build the technology that we solve the immediate problems of the users. The moment token becomes necessary for the next step, for decentralizing things, for decentralizing the sequencer, for decentralizing data availability, for doing all these things, or even for governance, for making decisions, for giving it to the community. The moment it is necessary, you have to introduce it. But until then there are priorities which.
00:52:24.928 - 00:52:36.430, Speaker A: We have to focus on totally. And do you have any alpha for the audience? Maybe when there is a token, what can they do to start thinking about how they can earn some of those tokens in the future?
00:52:36.580 - 00:53:41.858, Speaker B: I would say I would rather ask a question. What is it in this network that creates value for me that I can use, that actually provides value today? It feels to me like if your only interest is token and kind of gaming system, it's not really the match with our values. So I don't know how to answer that question because it's not what I'm thinking about. I'm thinking about the mission that we're building. The mission is to promote freedom for the world like this individual freedom, empowering a single individual to have their own self custody, self control, self ownership of their digital identity, digital assets, and doing this through building these systems. And it's a lot more interesting for me to talk about these things and to converse with people who are single minded. So in any case, that's our focus for now.
00:53:41.944 - 00:54:05.770, Speaker A: Totally. But I think one of the other good values about this space is that it is a meritocracy and you can get compensated commensurate to the value that you bring. So fair enough, I completely agree with you. But maybe for those listening who are values aligned with everything that you've shared in this podcast, how do you recommend they get involved? And obviously you have developers, but maybe for some that aren't developers, how can they get involved today?
00:54:05.920 - 00:54:57.270, Speaker B: They can just explore the system. They can get engaged in our discord, they can engage in conversation on Twitter, they can propose things and think of what's missing, provide feedback, provide, build, be part of the community and start the conversation about the governance, about the principles. We're doing a lot more now. We will be shifting the focus somewhat from the technology, from this product area of direction of what the governance and the community of the network is going to be long term and how we make it sustainable. This is the conversation we want to start now. And I really encourage everyone to get in, become a participant in this conversation.
00:54:57.350 - 00:55:01.350, Speaker A: Amazing. And the last question is, how are you defiant.
00:55:01.510 - 00:55:33.030, Speaker B: The very mission that brought Zksync into existence is about defying the limitations of the current rigid structures of this old society and groups of interest, protecting your rights and your own personal freedom. I think it's like so inherently profoundly through and through everything we're doing, I won't be able to add a better definition to it.
00:55:33.100 - 00:55:37.586, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, thank you so much for coming on. This was great. I really appreciate the time. Alex.
00:55:37.698 - 00:55:41.490, Speaker B: Thank you, Tegan, it was a pleasure for me and really grateful to all the listeners and watchers.
