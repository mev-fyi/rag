00:00:00.090 - 00:00:07.770, Speaker A: What would you say to purists who believe that DeFi should be fully permissionless and you shouldn't have Kyc?
00:00:07.850 - 00:00:45.794, Speaker B: It's interesting. I'll just say this. If you didn't have KYc across the world, it'd be a lot lower cost to offer these kind of products, but it wouldn't be coming with the way that countries choose to operate the financial walls within their jurisdiction. So I think ultimately it comes down to a matter of choice to tell somebody, to tell participants here that they all have to be permissionless. It's as impractical as telling everybody that they all have to be permissioned. I think what you'll see is that both streams will evolve, and you'll have kind of permissionless defi and permission defi. But if I want to serve institutions, I can't just tell them DeFi is all permissionless.
00:00:45.794 - 00:00:54.860, Speaker B: So if you don't want to do permissionless, you can't participate. We want to serve those customers, and that's their requirement. So I think you should have both Coke and Diet Coke and offer that to your customers.
