00:00:00.570 - 00:01:07.620, Speaker A: Sandra to another edition of our weekly recap here with the defiant print team. I'm Cami Russo, the founder. Owen is one of our staff reporters and YYC trader is our djen in chief and head of news. So thanks everyone for joining us. Here is where we go over all the main headlines of the week of Defi, web3 and crypto crypto. And this week main things were markets pulling back, so we had a bit of a correction in crypto. Meme coin mania was also fading, but we'll see that.
00:01:07.620 - 00:01:43.550, Speaker A: Still getting a big chunk of the activity on Dexs. We have an update on how Ethereum is doing post Chappella. Makerdao launched its spark lending pool. There was some drama on Aragon and paraspace and tether reported record surplus reserves. So let's get started with markets. YYC, you want to lead that conversation?
00:01:44.850 - 00:02:30.330, Speaker B: Sure. Thanks everyone for joining us. Yes, so we had a very promising end to last week. ETH was touching two k again. Bitcoin was well on its way to then we got the news that the Ethereum foundation sent, I think it was 15,000 ETH to an exchange. And that was pretty much it. Because I think even though that was just 30 million in sales, I think the sentiment shift probably pushed another couple of billion in sales, because the foundation does have a pretty good track record when it comes to timing the price of ETH.
00:02:30.330 - 00:02:56.580, Speaker B: They sold a decent chunk, I believe, above four K and then even in the previous cycle. Right, they timed it pretty well. That's one factor. I don't think that's the only one that brought markets down this week, but definitely one of them. And eat specific and meme coins. Yes. Total bloodbath this week.
00:02:56.580 - 00:03:50.326, Speaker B: A lot of the high flyers from last week gave back most of their gains. So Pepe, of course, got shot up to a market cap of nearly 1.8 billion after being listed on finance. It's down 70% this week, down to 500 mil, which is still pretty impressive given that it's just, what, a month or so old? Other coins as well? AI doge down 70%, turbo down 40%. So if you didn't take profits last week, you're basically stuck holding the bag and hoping that there's a recovery of some sort. But on the bright side, ETH has been burning like crazy. So you might have noticed that gas has been consistently in the triple digits over the last week.
00:03:50.326 - 00:04:02.950, Speaker B: It's just today, actually, that earlier this morning, a transaction of mine that had been pending since, I think Monday or Tuesday finally confirmed at, like, 75 Gwe.
00:04:03.390 - 00:04:04.140, Speaker A: Wow.
00:04:05.150 - 00:04:34.740, Speaker B: So it's possible that. Yeah, with the decline in prices, people are not as inclined to bet on meme coins. It's always nice to buy them when number goes up, right? Not so much when you're holding the bag on the way down. So you can see in that chart there that the burn rate has just gone through the roof, essentially, since memecoin mania started.
00:04:36.410 - 00:04:43.080, Speaker C: Yeah. I do find myself checking ultrasound money quite a bit. They did a good job with that website, right?
00:04:43.450 - 00:05:26.450, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, absolutely. In L2 news, we had arbitram Nova transactions going parabolic. Not exactly sure why, but, yeah. For those of you who aren't aware, Nova is arbitram's chain that's optimized for gaming and social media sort of applications, anything that needs quick and cheap transactions. But isn't that reliant on security? I guess so. It's kind of a trade off, because I think it's a lot more centralized than the regular arbitrary chain.
00:05:29.290 - 00:06:05.842, Speaker A: Right. Yeah. So, in all, we did see a pullback in crypto this week. So bitcoin was down 10%. Ethereum was down also close to 10%. Meme coins gave up a lot of their gains, but interesting to see that even as meme coins sold off, they still dominated activity on Dexs. Owen, you had this story.
00:06:05.842 - 00:06:07.860, Speaker A: Maybe you can walk us through what happened.
00:06:08.870 - 00:06:51.230, Speaker C: Sure. Yeah. So, I mean, I think everyone kind of started to feel meme coin fatigue around the same time. And, Kimmy, I think it was you who pointed out that a token called ladies was one of the top tokens traded on Coingecko's terminal site, which was just. I think there aren't any places that I know of which actually shows trading pairs by volume. So it was interesting across all chains. So it was interesting to see that and get that picture and then realize that what is essentially a meme coin is dominating the charts.
00:06:51.230 - 00:07:16.470, Speaker C: What does that mean? You see that? It's one thing to see it as, like, the 300th biggest token, okay? But seeing it as the top traded token feels, you realize how much heat is there around meme coins. And the token, because I think it was for the top five when I wrote the story, which went out last night, were meme coins.
00:07:17.470 - 00:07:43.138, Speaker A: Yeah. And here's the updated table from Gecko terminal. Okay. The top one is wrapped ETH and USDC, which makes sense. But second most active, this is ranked by 24 hours volume, Espe, against rep Eg, Bond. I don't know what that is.
00:07:43.304 - 00:07:45.460, Speaker C: Yeah, I saw that this morning. I don't know.
00:07:46.070 - 00:08:08.698, Speaker A: What is this? Okay, but I don't mean it's not any of the tokens, like we would know. So maybe it's a meme coin or shitcoin. I don't know. Linda. Another kind of random one. And ladies is still up there.
00:08:08.864 - 00:08:12.058, Speaker B: Yeah, these are all meme coins. Gigi Bond as well.
00:08:12.224 - 00:08:14.602, Speaker C: Oh, really? Yeah.
00:08:14.736 - 00:08:19.482, Speaker A: What's this? Linda? One. Linda Yakarino. Yeah.
00:08:19.536 - 00:08:28.542, Speaker B: I have no idea. Every time you open deck tools or deck screener, you're confronted with, like, ten new ones that popped up in the last hour or so.
00:08:28.676 - 00:08:39.250, Speaker A: Crazy. So what does this say about crypto, about the market right now? That activity is dominated by these random coins?
00:08:40.230 - 00:10:00.750, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that was the feeling. And going into the article, I had my own kind of feeling around that, which is not the sign of healthy innovation in Defi. If people think the best way to make money is to deploy, essentially a shitcoin and try to rally the troops around. Yeah, I don't think it's great. I mean, I think I was talking to a guy at Orox, which they develop a wallet and trading infrastructure, and he had done some on chain digging and noticed that he found one guy who I think had really operationalized launching meme coins and I think seeding it with liquidity and then pulling the liquidity all at once as the token gained a bit of value. So he said he saw that on a daily basis or like on an hourly basis, he was maybe making hundreds of ETH a day, I think for a little while employing that strategy, but also kind of employing it with different flavors each time, I think is what he said. The high level takeaway was that sophisticated people are, as they tend to do, eating other people's lunch.
00:10:00.750 - 00:10:26.290, Speaker C: And I think that is getting to the case now. Whereas maybe Pepe not so much are some of the earlier ones, but now we're at that highly pvp stage of this three, four week hype cycle, and it just gets more and more, I think, pvp as things kind of lose their alpha, so to speak.
00:10:26.440 - 00:11:02.334, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely. And the fact that we have NFT traders in the mix, these guys are fierce PvP dumpers, man. They'll dump on their best friends and not have any regrets. Regards to rugs. Yeah, definitely a lot more of them. And nowadays you don't even need to deploy a smart contract to rugs. Right, because it's the pre sale meta, which is, know, a Twitter account pops up and says, yeah, this coin, I don't know, whatever coin is launching the presale is going to be at so and so time.
00:11:02.334 - 00:11:18.934, Speaker B: Send ETH to this address if you want to participate. Right. And there's usually like a hard cap that will be set. Like the first 50 E is all that will be allowed in. So a lot of these coins initially did well. Right? Like for the four coin, for example. Right.
00:11:18.934 - 00:11:42.602, Speaker B: The presalers who sold on day one were able to hit a 30 x right off the bat. But yeah, there have been a lot of cases where the Twitter account comes up, pre sale goes through. Once the ETH is in, the Twitter account disappears. That's the lowest effort rug you could potentially do. Right, without even touching.
00:11:42.666 - 00:11:49.134, Speaker A: There's not even a real token. It's just an announcement and an address to send money to.
00:11:49.332 - 00:12:05.330, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Zach's been having a field day, kind know, picking up all these influencers who've been shilling coins. And of course, a lot of them launch coins with their own names. Right? Like Bitboy launched Ben.
00:12:06.630 - 00:12:08.290, Speaker A: Oh, that's bitboy's.
00:12:08.730 - 00:12:23.820, Speaker C: I don't know if he launched it. I think someone else, at least based on my interview yesterday, I heard someone else launched it, but then Bitboy picked it up strangely quickly. And it's like, sure you want to tie yourself to that? Anyway.
00:12:26.590 - 00:12:29.660, Speaker A: The 10th most active is bitboy thing.
00:12:34.110 - 00:12:34.970, Speaker B: It hard.
00:12:35.120 - 00:12:35.820, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:37.310 - 00:12:45.838, Speaker B: So he's like behind it reminded us of the Beanie situation. You remember when Blute came out? Do you guys remember that?
00:12:45.924 - 00:12:46.314, Speaker C: A little.
00:12:46.372 - 00:12:49.710, Speaker B: It was like a derivative.
00:12:49.790 - 00:12:50.978, Speaker A: Yeah, of course.
00:12:51.064 - 00:13:11.100, Speaker B: So he came out with Beanie loot and then there was this famous tweet of his where he know, I'm going to make it my mission in life to include, give utility to Bluetooth in every project that I do and stuff like that. And that was like the actual picotop. And it just went to zero after that because.
00:13:14.590 - 00:13:55.442, Speaker A: Okay, so we're at that phase where there was some initial, maybe legitimate. As legitimate as you can call meme coins. But sure, you can say, like, okay, Pepe had a real community behind it or whatever. Like actual, you know, like, you know, not. It wasn't a scam, you know, it's just like a coin around a meme. But now that's devolved into opportunists, scammers, just trying to profit off the hype. I think that's where we are in this cycle.
00:13:55.506 - 00:14:25.458, Speaker B: And I think one of the reasons a lot of the later entrants haven't managed to grab the same traction because everyone's fighting for the same liquidity, right? So this is a game of hot potato, and as soon as the chart turns, people dump it and move on to the next. So Pepe didn't have much competition for the first two, three weeks, so it was able to build up its market cap pretty much without anyone else to kind of draw attention from.
00:14:25.624 - 00:14:51.420, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if there's a lesson to take about being first in crypto, which it does seem. I don't know what you guys think, and obviously there are a lot of fine points to put on that, but it does seem like being first is important. I don't know, maybe I just forget that the projects that are first, like, I think of uniswap as a first, but people would say, like, bancor or maybe some other players are.
00:14:52.830 - 00:14:59.658, Speaker A: It is super like, okay, so Ethereum was the first smart contract chain, right?
00:14:59.744 - 00:14:59.994, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:00.032 - 00:15:50.460, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's know, it's been able to just keep its lead. Uniswap. It's true that banker was the first Dex, but uniswap was the first Dex. I mean, not the first Dex was the first liquidity pool based Dex, because there were other Dexes before banker, but uniswap was the first liquidity pool Dex to not have its own token. So I think kind of what held banker back was that every pair had to have the banker token as the underlying unisoft changed that model and made ETH the underlying pair. And so that just made it better, I think.
00:15:50.460 - 00:16:19.686, Speaker A: And that took off. It was the first to do that. And then Ave was one of the first lending markets together with compound, and they're still the biggest maker, was one of the first DeFi protocols. Still the biggest. So, yeah, I think that it's absolutely right. It really pays to be first in crypto. Bitcoin, the best example.
00:16:19.788 - 00:16:20.440, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:22.570 - 00:16:23.910, Speaker A: Still the biggest.
00:16:24.410 - 00:16:32.540, Speaker C: Yeah, no, it's true. Yeah. I expect Pepe to be around in two years, but I don't know how many other ones.
00:16:34.270 - 00:17:05.540, Speaker A: Definitely. It is interesting because it's not so obvious, right. That being first should have such outsized rewards because you could say, okay, you're first, but your tech sucks, and then maybe somebody else would come along and have better tech, and so people would move to that alternative, but it just doesn't have. Or it's harder to get people to move.
00:17:06.150 - 00:17:23.066, Speaker C: Yeah. I wonder if it's related also to why tokens stick around so much. It's like litecoin. I was talking to someone about litecoin this weekend. It's just like, you don't really need litecoin anymore. But I don't know, I wonder if it's the kind of thing. I don't know.
00:17:23.066 - 00:17:36.494, Speaker C: Or it's just like once you establish momentum in crypto or like a market cap, it seems like very hard for it to go away. I might be grasping at straws, but I don't know.
00:17:36.692 - 00:17:40.846, Speaker A: Network effects is what people will attribute this to.
00:17:41.028 - 00:17:41.760, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:42.530 - 00:18:03.766, Speaker A: And bag holding. And you see it in web two as well, like Facebook. Okay. Once you have the first social media website, then it's hard to beat it.
00:18:03.948 - 00:18:19.900, Speaker C: Yeah, I wonder about just like, the network effects and also, like, survivor bias because you could be like, you could have looked at MySpace and been like, they're primed. And I don't know if there's some theory of business to be, like, to say.
00:18:22.430 - 00:18:26.426, Speaker A: MySpace did do well for a just.
00:18:26.448 - 00:18:35.214, Speaker C: Yeah, and then I think they sold. But was that just a one off thing? Because I think Tom wanted to travel the world and take pictures. The guy who founded it, I don't.
00:18:35.252 - 00:18:37.198, Speaker A: Oh, I don't know the backstory.
00:18:37.374 - 00:18:44.260, Speaker C: Yeah, I think he sold it and just like, you didn't hear from him for a really long time, which is surprising. Yeah.
00:18:45.690 - 00:19:12.174, Speaker A: But other examples, I think Spotify was probably the first of its kind, right, of music streaming. Because before Spotify, you downloaded MP3 s of Bittorrent. I'm like, I don't know, I forget the name of the site.
00:19:12.212 - 00:19:13.630, Speaker C: That was limewire.
00:19:14.130 - 00:19:37.086, Speaker A: Yeah, there were like a couple of those. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's what I. But they were like a different model, right. It was more like peer to peer downloading, like pirated MP3 s or something. But Spotify changed that model and I think it was the first and now it's still the biggest.
00:19:37.278 - 00:19:49.800, Speaker C: Yeah, I wonder if the token, you bring it back to crypto. Yeah, I wonder if the token makes it extremely important to be the first or something. I don't know. I need to write a research paper about.
00:19:52.730 - 00:20:20.740, Speaker B: Like, for example, like Olympus, it did really well, but Wonderland did better in terms of price action because they kind of gamified it a bit more and made more. Yeah, both collapsed, but that's a different story. But in terms of, let's say Andre's solidly right. It was, like, bug ridden when it was first launched. So it was first, but it died, but now solidly. Forks have popped up on every chain and it's, like, gaining traction again.
00:20:21.670 - 00:20:25.960, Speaker C: Yeah, there's probably a thesis there, but I don't know what it is.
00:20:28.570 - 00:21:14.500, Speaker A: Okay, so then moving on to other headlines. So we had this talking about craze, this ERC 20 copy craze still going on on bitcoin. We talked about it last week. The BRC 20 tokens are really taking off and it feels like this renaissance of activity on top of bitcoin. And Owen had the story on what that's doing to the chain and bitcoin forks. Super interesting. Owen, you want.
00:21:20.630 - 00:22:18.866, Speaker C: Get. I think there's a lot there which I didn't get in terms of an interview, like someone who is deeply involved in the bitcoin community and understanding these motivations because, yeah, we saw that some of these tokens, which you don't hear much about or didn't hear that much about during the last Bull run. So bitcoin cash, bitcoin Sv, which stands for Satoshi's vision. Ethereum classic. All of these projects which kind of were relevant in 2017, were hot this week, relatively. I mean, I think they've dropped off, and it was interesting to see them all going up at once. I'm still not totally, to be honest, not totally satisfied with the answer, which I got from the hero wallet, saying he thought people were just kind of betting on bitcoin having a lot of action recently and that kind of spilling over.
00:22:18.866 - 00:22:30.720, Speaker C: In the same way that people spill over and produce a bunch of meme coins, they spill over and try to catch the quote unquote next bitcoin, which is entirely possible.
00:22:33.650 - 00:23:22.700, Speaker A: We do have at least some proof of that actually happening with litecoin. So Litecoin is another bitcoin fork. Yeah, one of the first ones. And as often happens in crypto, they copy the thing that already works on another chain and they have their own token standard, LTC 20. And so that's really made transactions on Litecoin spike to the highest is just like a record. Yeah, beating the previous high they had in 2018. Pretty interesting.
00:23:22.700 - 00:23:31.310, Speaker A: I just want to point out the fact that these are called XR.
00:23:34.950 - 00:23:36.530, Speaker C: Can you guys hear Cammy?
00:23:37.110 - 00:23:38.514, Speaker B: I can't. No.
00:23:38.712 - 00:23:42.260, Speaker C: Cammy, we lost you right when you're making a big point. We can't hear you right now.
00:23:43.190 - 00:23:43.938, Speaker A: Hello?
00:23:44.104 - 00:23:44.834, Speaker C: Yeah, you're good.
00:23:44.872 - 00:24:20.718, Speaker A: Can you hear me? Okay, sorry, I don't know what happened to my mic. Okay. No, I was just saying it's really funny how these new tokens are called XRC 20. There's a reason why Ethereum token standard is ERC 20. It's like Ethereum request for comment number 20. It was like the 20th request for comment for the Ethereum protocol back in the day. And Vitalik initially made the suggestion that, hey, there should be a token standard.
00:24:20.718 - 00:25:11.790, Speaker A: Then Fabian Vogelsteller, who now has his own blockchain, Luxo, he designed this token standard in the ERC 20. And so it was called the ERC 20 token standard. And now randomly, people are just copying that name. But it doesn't really make any sense that they would use that. But in any case, I think it's so interesting that bitcoin is adopting. There seems to be more innovation happening that they're looking to add smart contracts. They're looking to add the ability to mint different token types.
00:25:11.790 - 00:25:22.020, Speaker A: You said you would try to set up a wallet and see what the actual process was like of trading these tokens. Did you ever get around to doing that?
00:25:22.550 - 00:25:31.590, Speaker B: I set up the wallet but didn't get around to funding it, and then the market kind of crashed. Just kind of waiting on the sideline.
00:25:32.730 - 00:25:33.334, Speaker A: Okay.
00:25:33.452 - 00:25:34.120, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:36.330 - 00:25:49.754, Speaker A: It looks like it's still very. It's still, like, really early stages. It's not like, as easy as going to uniswap and swapping tokens, right?
00:25:49.952 - 00:25:57.760, Speaker C: Yeah. But I was surprised, I guess that was last week. The guy I talked to, they're somehow able to plug metamask into.
00:25:59.570 - 00:26:00.014, Speaker B: At least.
00:26:00.052 - 00:26:23.814, Speaker C: The guy, it wasn't BRC. I mean, all these things get so messy, especially when they first start. But it was like the SBRC, which he was starting with his project, which is also trying to do the smart contracts. They were able to use metamask for these transactions, which I was pretty surprised by because I thought there would be no way metamask would be compatible. But I guess by using their solution, it was.
00:26:24.012 - 00:27:08.006, Speaker A: That's pretty. Yes. Hey, he's saying it's like buying NFTs, and I think that's actually what they are. Right. Because BRC 20s are based on ordinals, which allow inscribing kind of metadata to tokens on bitcoin. And the way that they are made fungible is it's kind of like a hacky workaround. It feels like, to me, it's like, okay, you're inscribing the same kind of metadata to all BRC 20s, is what I understand.
00:27:08.006 - 00:27:13.334, Speaker A: And that's supposed to make them fungible. I don't know.
00:27:13.532 - 00:27:36.058, Speaker C: I know it's hacky. I don't quite understand. But I think it reminded me of loot a tiny bit where I was like, oh, they're like adding metadata to something. Yeah, they're adding JSon looking metadata to something which didn't have that, which wasn't intended for that. Right. I mean, that's why loot excited people for a while anyways.
00:27:36.154 - 00:28:35.940, Speaker A: Right. So yeah, it is kind of hacky, but I don't know, maybe it'll work, who knows? I think it's interesting also to point out just the reaction of many in the bitcoin community, which you would think, oh, activity on bitcoin is great, should be welcomed by bitcoiners. But that wasn't the case for at least loud voices in the community were kind of against this and suggesting that these transactions should be processed as spam on the chain. So I don't know, that's really surprising. It just shows how different the bitcoin community is from say, ethereum or other alt one. Late ones.
00:28:36.310 - 00:28:37.060, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:28:38.470 - 00:28:56.150, Speaker A: And maybe that was also behind the spike of bitcoin forks. Right. There was maybe some speculation that, oh, bitcoin community doesn't like what's happening with ordinals and all this activity. So maybe all this activity will move to other bitcoin forks.
00:28:56.730 - 00:29:21.440, Speaker C: Yeah, that was the quote. I wanted to find someone who would say that and I couldn't. But that was my suspicion was that I would have to look into it. I would expose my ignorance. I don't know if bitcoin cash implemented Taproot and Segwit, both of which are used for the ordinals protocol, but that would also like if they hadn't implemented those, then I think Tammy or NDo would hold more.
00:29:25.110 - 00:30:32.866, Speaker A: So again, something that we'll keep tracking whether all of this innovation on bitcoin continues. And maybe we see more actual defi happening on bitcoin. That would be really exciting. But then moving on to the originator of all these trends, the place where actual ERC 20 tokens work, Ethereum. So we had a couple of stories updating on what's happening on Ethereum after Chappella, and it looks like ETH staking deposits exceeded withdrawals for the first time after the chapella upgrade. So reminder that Chapella is a combination of two upgrades to the Ethereum chain. And the main thing that they did is that they allowed withdrawals of state ETH.
00:30:32.866 - 00:31:23.014, Speaker A: There was this big concern that once you allowed withdrawals, there would be a rush to withdraw ETH and then sell, and then that ETH price would suffer. But we haven't seen that. And actually the opposite has happened where east deposits, they are exceeding withdrawals, they're outpacing withdrawals. So more people are wanting to stake east than take east from the Ethereum chain. So that's obviously really good news for Ethereum security. Ethereum relies on staked ETH to secure the chain. It's good news for ETH price.
00:31:23.014 - 00:31:45.550, Speaker A: Less pressure, less sell pressure. So, yeah, I think this is really bullish for ETH. Shows a lot of resilience and investors wanting to continue holding ETH.
00:31:47.490 - 00:31:59.006, Speaker C: Sorry, wait, so this is the first day that withdrawals did outpace deposits, whereas the general trend has been deposits outpacing withdrawals.
00:31:59.198 - 00:31:59.986, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:00.168 - 00:32:00.658, Speaker C: Okay.
00:32:00.744 - 00:32:15.080, Speaker A: Yes. So there was, looks like 2.5 million e deposited versus it just, like, slightly surpassed it. But it's the first time it's happened.
00:32:17.770 - 00:32:35.790, Speaker B: Yeah. I think it just kind of reinforces the fact that all the gloom and doom that was predicted before the upgrades. Right. That there'll be a flood of hitting the market. I mean, prices are down, but it's not because of the stakers, because you have a balance. Right.
00:32:35.940 - 00:32:40.570, Speaker C: Yeah. Go ahead, Gammy.
00:32:40.650 - 00:32:41.760, Speaker A: No go.
00:32:45.990 - 00:32:57.830, Speaker C: There's a queue. And is the withdrawal still throttled by the queue? How much can we read into the withdrawals numbers? And I don't know the answer right now.
00:32:57.980 - 00:33:03.240, Speaker B: I think it's five minutes to withdraw, but to deposit the queue is like seven weeks.
00:33:04.170 - 00:33:05.366, Speaker C: Oh, crazy.
00:33:05.548 - 00:33:20.618, Speaker B: Yeah. Validator as well. Yeah, there's a validator queue. So the system is meant to smooth, stay smooth, I guess, through bullish and bearish cycles.
00:33:20.714 - 00:33:21.406, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:21.588 - 00:33:28.126, Speaker B: When things are pumping, you don't suddenly want, I don't know, a million new validators coming in. Right.
00:33:28.228 - 00:33:28.542, Speaker C: Sure.
00:33:28.596 - 00:33:45.170, Speaker B: Who are just going to be transient most likely. So that's pretty impressive, I think, in terms of demand coming in post withdrawals being activated.
00:33:45.510 - 00:34:01.782, Speaker C: Yeah. I kind of thought there would be like, there was like, maybe it's like withdrawals were outpacing or deposits were outpacing withdrawals, but that was because withdrawals were throttled and deposits weren't. But if they're both throttled in the same way and the line is way longer for deposits.
00:34:01.846 - 00:34:48.780, Speaker A: Yeah, it is impressive. Do you think that has something to do with expectations for price? Expectations? It's like, are people thinking that now is a good time to buy ETH after this long bear market? So I don't know, is it a signal that people are just, like, bullish ETH again? I guess, yeah. Right. Like, if people are willing to lock ETH up and gain interest on it, it's essentially a bet that you think ETH will appreciate. I guess.
00:34:50.030 - 00:35:26.680, Speaker B: Yeah. And, I mean, you're not locked up anymore. Right. So sentiment can change very quickly, as we've seen with many projects. But, yeah, I just dropped a link in the chat if you want to show that that shows the queues in real time. So you can see that currently there are four validators who want to exit, so they'll be out in about three minutes, and 42,000 validators that want to join but will have to wait four weeks, I guess. Three in a bit.
00:35:28.090 - 00:35:28.886, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:29.068 - 00:35:30.022, Speaker B: Pretty quick.
00:35:30.156 - 00:35:46.650, Speaker C: Yeah. That's amazing. I wonder if this will be that time when people are. I don't know, it feels kind of despondent. I wonder if people will look back on this as the time to get in on the market. Dog days of the bear market. We'll see.
00:35:46.650 - 00:35:53.150, Speaker C: But there are all these bullish signals which aren't linked to price, which you were maybe alluding to, Cammy.
00:35:53.730 - 00:36:09.460, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I guess to counter that, I think there was this bit in one of our stories. Where was it?
00:36:10.790 - 00:36:13.700, Speaker B: It was the previous one you just went to.
00:36:16.390 - 00:36:29.740, Speaker A: Derivate. Yeah. Maybe you can explain it better. Why? We see what they were saying. They were saying, like, volume is at some low for ETH, and that's like a bearish sign.
00:36:30.670 - 00:37:07.142, Speaker B: Yeah. So according to their price volatility index, which they call VVOL, it hit an all time low last weekend, which was when ETH and bitcoin were pumping. So that's kind of what we see in traditional markets as you. The markets go up, Vix goes down. Right. That's the general correlation that holds. So what they're saying is that, I guess there are a lot of traders betting on a larger pullback post chappella, basically betting that Chappella will sell the news just as the merge was.
00:37:07.142 - 00:37:51.460, Speaker B: And I think even the launch of the beacon chain we kind of dumped after that. Right. I think it's preparation for the summer, essentially, because the summer is usually when we see lower volumes, which less liquidity makes it easier for more volatile moves. And we've had a great run this year. Right, since January 1. Essentially, we just started pumping straight out of the gate, and we've kind of recaptured the 1700 area on east that was very important support during the bull times. And resistance for pretty much all of 2022.
00:37:55.210 - 00:38:17.340, Speaker A: Is the idea that after this rally, there will be a bit of profit taking into the summer, low volatility going into the summer. And I don't know, I guess the expectation is not a lot of gains in the next couple of months.
00:38:18.430 - 00:38:42.718, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess people are just betting on the sell in May narrative. It happens every year in the stock markets. May is the worst month, I think, apart from there are a few exceptions in election years or something. But, yeah, May is generally quite terrible for all markets so far. It's living up to its reputation. So let's hope it doesn't get too much worse.
00:38:42.894 - 00:38:49.000, Speaker C: What a primitive indicator. You go to school just for them to tell you to sell stocks in May.
00:38:52.490 - 00:39:15.200, Speaker A: So I guess it's just like a seasonal thing. It's not linked to Chappella. I think that narrative has already been disproved. It's already been what, a month? When did it happen? I forget, but at least like a couple of weeks. Since.
00:39:17.330 - 00:39:20.000, Speaker B: 15Th or 16th of last month, I think.
00:39:20.370 - 00:40:15.360, Speaker A: Okay, about a month. Yeah, almost a month. And, yeah, I think it's fair to say that ETH didn't dump because of Chappella. I think if it started to sell off now, it would be attributed to just like a seasonal reasons macro or something else, but not necessarily people kind of selling the news because it's already been a month. Okay. And then now shifting gears completely, there was a bit of drama this week in crypto. So one news we had was on Aragon, and this is Sam's story.
00:40:15.360 - 00:41:19.990, Speaker A: There's like, a lot going on here. I'm not going to probably do the story total justice. I wish Sam was here to explain it, but Aragon. So Aragon is this Dao, which it's trying to kind of build an on chain legal system for Daos. And we actually had the founder on the podcast a while back, Luis, Gwende. So you guys should check that out. But what happened here is that Aragon is holding a treasury which has outpaced the growth of its token.
00:41:19.990 - 00:43:01.782, Speaker A: Right now, it's holding a treasury of 177,000,000, which is more than which is up from 25 million that it raised in a 2017 ICO. And while the treasury has grown, the ant token still remains priced near its ICO price. So it has kind of lagged treasury growth. So this has produced this tension between the Aragon team and token holders, or at least some token holders, who believe that the token should be capturing more of the value of the Dow treasury than it actually is. So one of the token holders is ARCA, which is a fund, and they have been for a while acting as activist shareholders that we see in traditional finance and have just been pushing for Arizona to do token buybacks or to distribute the treasury in some way to token holders so token holders can capture some of that value. And it looks like Arca is now joined by this other group called RFV Raiders. I forget what RFV stands for.
00:43:01.836 - 00:43:04.680, Speaker B: Do you guys know risk free value?
00:43:05.210 - 00:43:59.340, Speaker A: Okay, risk free value raiders. And so RFV Raiders, Aragon is alleging they've been kind of hoarding ant tokens to pass this proposal to distribute kind of the treasury and archae is like wanting the same thing. But Aragon doesn't want to do that. And instead, they are repurposing the treasury into a grant program to distribute money to people. Building on. Yeah, it's this kind of really big fight that's been ongoing in the Aragon ecosystem. It's hard to say who's right here.
00:43:59.340 - 00:44:55.622, Speaker A: You can see the pros and cons to each side's argument. Like Argon is saying, we'd rather distribute the treasury to people providing value to the Dow. Token holders say our token hasn't appreciated in line with the Aragon treasury. In the end, if there's governance, you should listen to what the token holders are voting and saying. But Aragon is not doing that. So, yeah, it's a big mess. It again points to how much development is still needed for token based governance.
00:44:55.622 - 00:45:35.590, Speaker A: Because you have cases like these where as much as you can understand where Argon is coming from, it's a Dow and its main purpose, its main mission is to have token based and on chain based governance and a legal system. And it's not listening to its own token holders. Even if they say that they're Raiders, that they're like, whatever, activist shareholders or whatever it is. I think you're still beholden to your token holders. But I don't know. That's my own opinion.
00:45:39.230 - 00:46:06.766, Speaker B: It's like the token holders told the team, all right, you're fired. Team turns around and says, sorry, you're fired. Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah. Like you said, there's pros and cons to both sides. Personally, I've seen too many DeFi projects that are just slow rugs where they raise funds in the bowl, but didn't really do anything after that. So the token suffered.
00:46:06.766 - 00:46:28.250, Speaker B: But the team has been eating happily through the bear market, big salaries and comp and stuff. So I can definitely see where the Raiders are coming from. Because at the end of the day, they're still putting up their money, right. They're risking their money buying the token even before the proposal passes, whether they are able to influence it or whatnot.
00:46:32.110 - 00:46:43.214, Speaker C: Because I remember Aragon back in 2017, and it was exciting, but I don't hear that much about it. I don't know. I didn't hear much about it at all. Last bull run.
00:46:43.252 - 00:46:54.218, Speaker B: But I think that's the problem. Right. Which is why token holders are. Right. All right, let's salvage this mess and at least get the treasury.
00:46:54.394 - 00:47:09.240, Speaker C: Yeah. Because I was excited by them. I remember when I first heard about them, I was like, oh, like an OS for organizations. Like. Fascinating. That's one of the big aspirations of crypto, but, yeah, I haven't seen much from.
00:47:10.890 - 00:47:39.600, Speaker A: Yeah, it hasn't really come to fruition. This group, RFV traders. Sorry, RFV Raiders. It's interesting. Like, Aragon is saying that they've also targeted invictus Dao Fay, Rome Temple. And they say they're responsible for dissolving rook Dao. I don't know how true that is, but.
00:47:41.410 - 00:48:13.180, Speaker B: Honestly, all those protocols, useless. I don't want to be rude, but they did nothing with all the potential and the capital that they raised. You remember Faye? Two and a half billion in RFV at launch and what, just pretty much, I'd say, slow rug down the road, but I see the co founder's name in a lot of angel rounds these days, so clearly it worked out for him.
00:48:14.990 - 00:48:22.320, Speaker C: Good old falling up man. The Silicon Valley classic. Yeah.
00:48:26.770 - 00:48:59.820, Speaker A: I guess it's not so clear cut, right? From a project perspective. Yeah, maybe it sucks seeing token holders kind of wanting to vote their way into your treasury. But from the token holders perspective, if you're not doing anything with the treasury, if you're not delivering any value to the token, and there's a governance mechanism, it's in their right to make proposals, to try to do that, to try to drive value to the.
00:49:03.470 - 00:49:03.786, Speaker B: We.
00:49:03.808 - 00:49:17.790, Speaker C: What, so the current status is. I haven't had a chance to read Sam's story, but it's that Aragon has essentially repurposed the treasury as a grants program, and that's where it stands. And we'll have to kind of see whether.
00:49:17.860 - 00:49:36.200, Speaker B: Yeah, I believe there was a vote last year, in June or last summer that passed, basically saying that the treasury should be handed over to the dow. And at the time, Argon said, yes, we'll do it, et cetera. But they never did. And now they've decided just to ignore it.
00:49:37.450 - 00:49:38.440, Speaker A: Pretty crazy.
00:49:38.970 - 00:50:06.974, Speaker C: Yeah. It was for the L2 token story, but it was Tushar. He did make the point. He was like, ultimately, votes, unless there's actually a change to the code, is integrated into a vote. It's all on chain. There are all these disconnects between a vote. A vote doesn't necessarily mean someone is going to do something, per se.
00:50:06.974 - 00:50:09.358, Speaker C: It's not like a law of nature or something.
00:50:09.444 - 00:50:14.446, Speaker B: It's not binding on the team to actually execute. Unless it's on chain governance, like you said.
00:50:14.548 - 00:50:35.670, Speaker C: Yeah, like self executing contract. Then they don't have to do it. Or especially if it's like. Yeah. Or if it's like, you have to build something where it's not even just like a one off discrete action. It's like, okay, the Dow voted that you build, like, a new UX or something. That's an extended process which can't be controlled on chain, so it gets messy.
00:50:38.190 - 00:51:04.414, Speaker A: Yeah. If there's nothing to guarantee that a team has to do what token holders say, then. Yeah, token holders have really no protection in kind of the Dow ecosystem. I don't know if you can really take this to a court system and if this holds up in court.
00:51:04.462 - 00:51:05.554, Speaker B: Well, Gary would love that.
00:51:05.592 - 00:51:12.130, Speaker C: Wouldn't yet. I think not. Gary, Gary. Why isn't Gary protecting.
00:51:17.130 - 00:51:19.560, Speaker B: The case for us, that this is a security?
00:51:19.930 - 00:51:20.438, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:20.524 - 00:51:35.020, Speaker A: Oh, God. Yeah. I don't know. I guess the solution would be to make these kind of self execute upon vote, but you can't really do that for everything.
00:51:35.390 - 00:51:40.830, Speaker C: Yeah. This type of vote, you could, but yeah, I think some you couldn't.
00:51:44.450 - 00:52:04.770, Speaker A: Just want to thank my. It looks like I have a fan in the audience. Somebody's calling me queen many times, so thank you. They themselves have. They're called queen, so thank you, queen.
00:52:05.690 - 00:52:11.298, Speaker C: I see Queen all the time. She's your superfan.
00:52:11.474 - 00:52:26.970, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. All right. Okay, we need to start wrapping up. But last piece of drama of the. Oh, and you had this story on paraspace.
00:52:27.550 - 00:53:10.422, Speaker C: Yeah. So another sticky one. It feels like ages since I wrote about it. But basically what happened was, I think the Paraspace team, which is an NFT lending protocol, I believe you can lend against ERC 20s as well, or at least some. Basically, they realized they were hacked in. It's so confusing. All right, they were hacked in March, but it was a white hat hack.
00:53:10.422 - 00:53:46.670, Speaker C: And that was by the security firm blocksec, from my understanding. Blocksec hacked, saw something wrong, took out the hack as a preventative measure. So they took the hack. They made, I think, 2900 ETH. So they carried it out and then they sent it to this address, which the paraspace founder said, send it to this address. This is our quote, unquote, insurance address. Like, thank you.
00:53:46.670 - 00:54:52.758, Speaker C: Probably they were compensated in some ways, so it seemed all good. But I think then the paraspace team started to look at that wallet and realized that it hadn't distributed the funds to the users and to the protocol to make the protocol whole, and that there were actually a lot of suspicious transactions coming from that address to centralized exchanges, to circle, I believe. And there's maybe one other place, and I think just to, like, wallets they weren't familiar with. So I think that came to light that that was happening, and there's obviously a disconnect there, and that I think the CEO had allegedly gone kind of rogue. And so as that news hit, as you'll see in the chart, we have up, people freaked out and withdrew a bunch of assets from Paraspace because I think there's a bunch of. What's going on? This guy has gone off the rails a bit. So that's my basic understanding.
00:54:52.758 - 00:55:55.242, Speaker C: I talked to someone, and I think they took the CEO off some of the team's multi sigs. I think there's, like, the treasury. They took the CEO off the treasury's multi sig, and then this is the insurance wallet, which I believe they regained control of and maybe have regained control of all the assets. So as far as I know, Paraspace has pretty much been made whole. But I think it freaked a lot of people out. And there was this insane thing where it was like the project's Twitter was saying one thing, but then the project's website was redirecting to the CEO, who was saying another, so it got very messy. I'm not sure what the current status is, but, yeah, it was, again, one of those semi classic crypto dramas at this point, where some people control some things, some people control other things, be it social media accounts, crypto addresses.
00:55:55.242 - 00:56:13.380, Speaker C: And there's, again, no unifying impetus to make this project act in unison. That was the status as of when I wrote the article. I haven't been able to follow since.
00:56:13.750 - 00:56:14.210, Speaker A: Okay.
00:56:14.280 - 00:56:14.562, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:14.616 - 00:56:33.542, Speaker A: Just yet another dramatic. Yeah, what a miss. It shows that lesson from this is that crypto teams should have multi sigs so that no CEO is able to just go rogue.
00:56:33.606 - 00:56:49.920, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm not sure what the current status. I should hop in their discord and see what the CEO is saying most recently, because I think he went dark, too, and they haven't been able to get a hold of him, but he was still posting on social media.
00:56:51.410 - 00:57:05.010, Speaker A: Okay. And then to wrap up, I think let's cover this. Spark lending protocol by maker. Are you on top of this or Owen?
00:57:08.090 - 00:57:11.030, Speaker C: I'm not sure. I've just seen it kicking around Twitter.
00:57:11.850 - 00:57:38.430, Speaker B: It's a fork of Avev three, essentially, with just a few assets to start off with. So you have ETH staked ETH die and savings die, which is the new token that is basically introduced with the launch of Spark. So SDI, or savings die, is basically die that's been deposited in Maker's savings rate module, which pays, I think, one or 1.1% or something like that.
00:57:38.500 - 00:57:39.390, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's one.
00:57:39.460 - 00:58:27.790, Speaker B: They've made a token that it's yield bearing dai, essentially. So I think the goal would be to have that replace regular Dai as probably a DeFi based asset, similar to the trend that we were seeing with stake ETH tokens. Right, because why have a non yield bearing token when you can have a yield bearing one? I think that's just the question that people ask. Right. It's free money that you're leaving on the table if you aren't. So it's just these few assets to start off with. And I believe as a condition of being able to fork V three, they're going to share some of the profits with Ave.
00:58:30.210 - 00:58:44.690, Speaker C: Yeah, I forget with that die savings, I think. Does it come from the maker treasury or does it come from money they make on other people's. On interest the protocol makes from other people's leverage positions.
00:58:45.930 - 00:58:47.430, Speaker B: Where does the interest come from?
00:58:47.500 - 00:58:51.426, Speaker C: Yeah, that 1%, I think that's just minted.
00:58:51.458 - 00:58:52.040, Speaker B: Right.
00:58:53.130 - 00:58:54.930, Speaker C: They just, like, toss you extra die.
00:58:55.010 - 00:59:00.410, Speaker A: No, doesn't it come from borrowing fees?
00:59:01.150 - 00:59:02.182, Speaker C: That's what I assume.
00:59:02.246 - 00:59:07.318, Speaker B: Just from the maker protocol fees overall. Like, it's paid out as an expense item.
00:59:07.414 - 00:59:09.100, Speaker C: Got you. Okay, cool.
00:59:10.450 - 00:59:31.490, Speaker A: Okay, so this fork protocol is a fork of Avev three. And what is is die then? Is die then kind of deposited on spark protocol to issue SDI. Is that how that's generated?
00:59:32.150 - 00:59:48.746, Speaker B: No, it's deposited directly in the DAI savings rate module, which already exists. Right. Which is not part of spark, and that's how you get SDI. But then you can use Spark to, I believe, like, leverage SDI, so you could potentially do other cool stuff with it.
00:59:48.928 - 00:59:58.620, Speaker A: Okay. So you can probably use it as collateral to borrow other crypto against SDI or something.
01:00:00.030 - 01:00:07.946, Speaker B: Yeah, either way, you could deposit ETH and borrow SDI or the other way around, depending on if you're bullish or bearish.
01:00:08.138 - 01:00:12.590, Speaker A: Okay, so Spark would give SDI more utility.
01:00:14.070 - 01:00:14.820, Speaker B: Yes.
