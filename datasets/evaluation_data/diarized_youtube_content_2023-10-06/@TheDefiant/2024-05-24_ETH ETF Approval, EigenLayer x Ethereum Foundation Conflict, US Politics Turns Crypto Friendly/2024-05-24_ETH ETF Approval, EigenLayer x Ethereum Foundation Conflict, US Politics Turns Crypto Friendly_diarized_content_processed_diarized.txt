00:00:00.280 - 00:00:13.594, Speaker A: Those of us who do believe that crypto is just better financial infrastructure would hope that the shift comes the other way around. Wall street will hopefully increasingly use crypto rails because they are just better.
00:00:17.054 - 00:00:17.510, Speaker B: Build.
00:00:17.582 - 00:00:26.878, Speaker C: Apps and store assets with safe, smart contract accounts which secure over $100 billion more on them later in the show. Hi everyone.
00:00:27.046 - 00:00:34.260, Speaker A: Welcome to Crypto with Cami, where we go through all the main headlines in crypto and Defi in the past week in 30 minutes or less.
00:00:34.412 - 00:01:17.008, Speaker C: This is the show for the week starting May 20. So obviously this week the big news was the approval of the spot Ethereum ETF. We'll go over the main takeaways of this landmark decision. Other big news which also relates to the ETH ETF is that we've seen increasing signs that the us regulatory landscape is finally becoming more crypto friendly. And finally, there was a bit of drama around Ethereum foundation researchers taking huge advisory deals from Eigen layer. We'll go into all of this and more, but let's start with the Ethereum ETF approval. So here's the main takeaways.
00:01:17.008 - 00:03:03.480, Speaker C: The main points you need to know is that the SEC, the us securities regulator, approved form 19 B, four for eight issuers, and that includes BlackRock and Fidelity. How this works is that exchanges, in this case the New York Stock Exchange, ArCA, Nasdaq and the CBO BCX exchanges, all applied for a rule change with this form 19 B, four, which would allow them to list and trade ether based exchange traded product of or ETF's. And they applied to list eight funds which include or which are the grayscale Ethereum ETF, the bitwise ETF, the Blackrocks, iShares, Ethereum Trust, Vaneck ETF, the Ark 21 shares, ETF, Invesco, Fidelity's ETF and Franklin Templeton's ETF. So May 23 was a big deadline that everyone was looking at because the SEC had to make a decision on the first ETF listed, which was Vaneck. And similarly to what happened with the bitcoin ETF, the SEC decided to take the first listing date and just approve all of the applications that had been filed. I think this makes sense. Otherwise, you know, one, the first fund that lists has a first mover advantage.
00:03:03.480 - 00:04:10.164, Speaker C: This way everyone starts on a level playing field. So what happened is that this form 19 B, four was approved by the SEC on Thursday, but the SEC still needs to approve the s one form, which is a like a fund registration. And so while ETF's are approved to be listed and traded, they can't be traded yet because the SEC is still missing this s one approval. Still. Huge, huge news. Very unexpected. Just as of last week, the Bloomberg intelligence analysts who have been very rightly calling all the different stages of the bitcoin ETF process and now the Ethereum ETF process, they had only a 25% chance that the Ethereum ETF would be approved by the May 23 deadline.
00:04:10.164 - 00:05:43.416, Speaker C: But then suddenly what happened is that they changed their odds to 75% because they were hearing rumors that there was movement in Ethereum ETF front. And sure enough, what we saw last week and beginning of this week is that all of the issuers and applicants started amending their ETF applications, kind of signaling that there were conversations, discussions going on that pointed to potentially Ethereum ETF being approved. And so what went from being very unlikely that we'd have an ethereum ETF approval in May, went from being very unlikely to being the most likely scenario, and it actually was confirmed and approved on Thursday, May 23. So that was huge, huge news. Besides the fact that now institutional investors have access to spot Ethereum, because remember that there was already futures based ETF's. Now, the big difference here is that with futures based ETF's, these funds issuers don't need to actually buy ETH itself. They just, you know, buy a derivative.
00:05:43.416 - 00:06:50.344, Speaker C: They trade a derivative, which is futures, a futures contract. Now, with this product, with the spot ETH, ETF issuers need to actually buy ETH which, you know, has a bigger potential, obviously, of driving inflows funds from institutions to the actual ETH cryptocurrency, and has the potential to increase the ETH price. But we'll get into that in a little bit. So this is the first thing that matters. Institutional investors, big pension funds, hedge funds, investment firms, asset managers like the big guys of Wall street, who don't want to deal with all the hassle of going to a crypto exchange, dealing with crypto custody, dealing with private keys. They just want to use their own traditional financial rails that they're used to. Those guys now have access to Ethereum.
00:06:50.344 - 00:07:52.124, Speaker C: Previously, obviously, they only had access to bitcoin. Now they can buy ETH. So that's number one big takeaway from why the Ethereum ETF approval matters. Second is that with this approval, it means that this debate on whether ETH is or is not a security, which hadn't been settled. We had had some statements from regulators, from the CFTC saying that ether is a security. But on the other hand, Gary Gensler had refused to confirm that ETH is not a security. So there was this kind of cloud looming over Ethereum on whether at some point us regulators would deem it a security, which would have very important implications for exchanges which would now have to register in order to list ETH.
00:07:52.124 - 00:09:21.184, Speaker C: It would have huge implications for all of the projects and protocols building on Ethereum, because if ETH is a security, then everything built on ETH is potentially a security. So it would be a disaster or a big headache for the entire Ethereum ecosystem if ETH was deemed a security. Well, now, with the approval of Ethereum ETF, it signals that the SEC finds that Ethereum is a commodity. It didn't explicitly say so in the filing, but that is what is implied because, you know, it approved this futures based Ethereum ETF without require requiring any additional information or registration or anything like that. That would imply that it thinks that is a security. So this is, you know, this is kind of the big takeaway that prominent lawyers, like the Coinbase, Coinbase lawyer, the chief legal officer at the exchange, this is what he's making out of this decision. So he said ETH is effectively deemed a commodity, as we've always known it to be.
00:09:21.184 - 00:10:42.400, Speaker C: And others have also interpreted this decision in the same way. So again, that's huge for ETH. It's huge for the ethereum ecosystem to finally clear this cloud hanging over the community on whether ETH is or not a security. This ETF decision implies it's actually a commodity. Now, this is also important because, you know, this really 180 shift that I described earlier, this shift from probably not approving the ETF to approving the ETF in one week, comes under a broader context of a friendlier political landscape, a friendly regulatory environment for crypto. And this is just, you know, one of the biggest signs that we've seen, that us politicians and lawmakers are seeing the crypto voter base as significant. And so for the first time, they are taking into account crypto issues in their agendas.
00:10:42.400 - 00:12:06.984, Speaker C: They are for the first time catering to us, to crypto natives, to people who vote based on where candidates stand on crypto. And this is huge because obviously, for the first time, Washington cares about crypto, and it means that we have people in Washington fighting for the industry's interests. And this Ethereum ETF approval is just one sign of how big a political force crypto is becoming. So huge news. And now talking about what the actual inflows we might see. Again, the Ethereum ETF approval is huge news for the reasons I described before, for the fact that Ethereum is now deemed a commodity for the fact that it signals a friendlier political and regulatory landscape, and for the fact that now institutional investors have access to eth. But now the fourth point is ETH price.
00:12:06.984 - 00:12:17.434, Speaker C: What's the actual impact we might see from these inflows from institutional investors? And here's where things get, you know, a little bit.
00:12:19.774 - 00:12:21.430, Speaker A: Less exciting, I would.
00:12:21.462 - 00:13:01.050, Speaker C: Say, because, you know, based on the information we have, influence might not be as big as what we saw with bitcoin ETF's. They might disappoint. But, you know, if one thing is for sure is that crypto always surprises us. So obviously, take all of this with a grain of salt. But if we look at the assets under management of Hong Kong spot ETF's, Hong Kong recently approved ETH and bitcoin ETF's, and what we see here is.
00:13:01.082 - 00:13:07.416, Speaker A: That ETf's are about 15% of total AUM.
00:13:07.570 - 00:14:02.234, Speaker C: So total assets under management of spot ETF's in Hong Kong is a bit over 300 million, of which Ethereum ETF's are 50 million. So about 15%. Now, in the US, total aum for the bitcoin ETF's without GBTC is $37 billion. Okay, and props to the blog for their great data page. Okay, so that's $37 billion of total bitcoin ETF assets. So 15% of bitcoin ETF assets would be 5.6 billion.
00:14:02.234 - 00:15:05.594, Speaker C: So if the US ETF market behaves similar to the Hong Kong ETF market, and ETF is 15% of total ETF assets, then in about five months, which is how long it took the bitcoin ETF to get to 37 billion, we should see about 5.6 billion of Ethereum ETF inflows. But the big caveat here is that you have to take into account the outflows of grayscale's ETH trust. Remember that grayscale has these huge trust, which is how institutions have so far had access to crypto. So they had GBtC for bitcoin and they had eth eth for eth. And right now, the grayscale eth trust has.
00:15:06.934 - 00:15:15.234, Speaker A: It has 11 billion in Aum, or almost 3 million of ETh.
00:15:15.774 - 00:16:30.344, Speaker C: So what happens is that when actual ETF's are approved, institutions take out money of the Grayscale trust because they are inferior products. They have really high fees. They have this thing where the share price trades at a premium or discount to the actual net asset value of the fund because the shares don't update daily like the fund doesn't sell or buy shares or the underlying asset of the fund daily. Yeah, it just behaves differently from the actual spot ETF. And so because it's an inferior product, obviously when ETF's are approved, investors will withdraw funds from the Grayscale Trust, which has happened with GBTC. So for GBTC, it had 29 billion of assets in January, and now it has 19 billion. That's a 34% decline in dollar terms.
00:16:30.684 - 00:16:58.864, Speaker A: In bitcoin terms, it had 600,000 bitcoin in January. Here we have this dune dashboard, and now it has 287,000 bitcoin in holding. So that's a almost over a 50% decline in bitcoin terms for DBTC.
00:16:59.804 - 00:17:09.904, Speaker C: So what happens if the ETH Grayskill trust has a 50% decline of ETH? That would be.
00:17:10.724 - 00:17:37.923, Speaker A: That would be a decline from 2.96 million ETH, which it holds today, to 1.45 million ETH. That would be 5.3 billion of dollars in outflows, which is just under the 5.6 billion of expected inflows. Remember, we got the expected inflows from that 15% number from the Hong Kong ETF's.
00:17:39.463 - 00:18:09.544, Speaker C: So, you know, if we assume that the grayscale ETH trust has the same percentage of decline as GBTC, and if we assume that spot Ethereum ETF's have 15% of the assets that bitcoin ETF's have, similar to what happens in Hong Kong, then that means that net inflows.
00:18:09.584 - 00:18:12.328, Speaker A: For ETH, it would be just about.
00:18:12.376 - 00:18:48.204, Speaker C: 300 million in five months, which is not huge. So, you know, that might be why ETH has been trading a bit sideways since the approval. Let's see. So definitely up. So here we have ETh just surging. When we had this odds change from 25% to 75%. So ETH surge from about 3000 to 3700.
00:18:48.204 - 00:19:36.934, Speaker C: But now it's stayed pretty much at this level between 3000 803,700. So maybe this jump is the extent of the increase that the market is attributing to the ETF impact. And maybe people are thinking we won't see as much in inflows as we saw with bitcoin accounting for how ETH is a smaller percentage of bitcoin interest and accounting for grayscale trust outflows. So that's just something to take into consideration.
00:19:37.474 - 00:19:44.774, Speaker A: Maybe the actual price impact for ETH is not going to be as high.
00:19:45.354 - 00:20:17.244, Speaker C: But that's just taking into account the different factors I mentioned before. Crypto does not stop surprising us. We might see huge inflows. The other thing to take into account is that these products are just plain vanilla eth. They don't include staking. Actually, the issuers had to explicitly take staking out of their applications. So that might be something else that's working against these products.
00:20:17.944 - 00:20:59.574, Speaker A: Investors might say, why would I want to pay fees for just plain eth when you can get extra yield by staking ETH elsewhere? On the other hand, again, these investors don't want to deal with anything very crypto native. They just want traditional rails, which is why they want these ETF products. So maybe they don't really care about staking ETH. But that's, you know, something else to take into account. These ETF's do not include staking. They're just plain vanilla eth. So that's, that's it for, you know, the main takeaways of the spot.
00:20:59.574 - 00:21:48.452, Speaker A: Ethereum ETF approval. One final point I want to make is that, you know, for me, this is great for the reasons I said before, but to me, it's always more exciting to see Wall street adopting actual crypto rails. So things like we've seen with the Blackrock tokenized Treasuries fund, for example, is a great example of, like, Wall street actually using crypto. This is the other way around. It's actually bringing crypto into traditional finance. So, you know, it's a bit less exciting to me. I think we, those of us who do believe that crypto is just better financial infrastructure would hope that the shift comes the other way around.
00:21:48.452 - 00:22:04.652, Speaker A: Wall street will hopefully increasingly use crypto rails because they are just better. So that's it for ETH. ETF news for now. I'm sure we'll see many ripples in the market and in the industry.
00:22:04.788 - 00:22:44.174, Speaker B: Have you heard about safe? They're not just pioneers in crypto custody, but they're also leading the way with smart accounts. With safe, managing your crypto is smarter and safer than ever. They've secured over $100 billion in total value and are available in more than 15 networks. Safe is also revolutionizing the industry with their full compatibility with ERC 4337, making it super easy to integrate wallets into your daily crypto activities. And for crypto enthusiasts, Safe has something special, the safe pass activity rewards program. Launching soon. It's a fantastic way to engage and earn rewards.
00:22:44.174 - 00:23:00.054, Speaker B: So what are you waiting for? Visit Safe Global, sign up for the safe pass activity rewards program, and secure your spot at Safecon during the Berlin blockchain week. Be part of the transition that's setting a new standard in the world of custody.
00:23:00.714 - 00:23:32.524, Speaker A: The other piece of news that I mentioned before that super interesting this week is the shift in the us political and regulatory landscape becoming more crypto friendly. So we saw a few signs of this. Obviously, the Ethereum ETF approval is one. But we also had the Senate and House approved the financial innovation and technology for the 21st Century act, or Fit 21.
00:23:33.064 - 00:23:46.944, Speaker C: And that was passed. And the White House said it won't veto it, which was another change of stance. They had said if this bill passed, they would veto. But this week they actually, they went.
00:23:46.984 - 00:24:24.446, Speaker A: Back on that and said they won't veto this bill. This bill is actually not that great for crypto. It's not horrible, but it's not like a huge win or anything like that. It continues to give the SEC oversight over the industry, but it requires the CFTC and the SEC to work together to establish a framework for regulating digital assets. So that's good. But the main thing to look at here is just this shift in attitude. This bill had to have bipartisan support.
00:24:24.446 - 00:25:02.370, Speaker A: It was voted by Democrats and Republicans. So we see both parties working towards more crypto friendly regulation. And we have the White House basically saying, I won't stand in your way. And that's huge. The other signal again was that last week we had eleven Democrats defy Biden and Elizabeth Warren's anti crypto army and passed a resolution which overturned the SEC.
00:25:02.522 - 00:25:44.212, Speaker C: Staff accounting bulletin number 121, which basically prevents regulated financial firms from custody in crypto. Obviously, if this became law that the financial firms can custody crypto, this would be a huge blow to the industry. But Democrats broke away from their party lines and voted to repeal this bill, which is huge. Again, we're seeing this increased bipartisan support for crypto friendly legislation, which is a huge change. The cherry on top for this week.
00:25:44.258 - 00:26:36.864, Speaker A: Weeks crypto friendly legislation in the US was that the House passed an anti CBDC bill which would prohibit Congress from passing or from creating a central bank digital currency. And Tom Emmer, which, you know, has become this just pro crypto fighter in Congress, had some great quotes. He was like that this type of financial surveillance has no place in the United States. This is something that we've seen in the Chinese Communist Party and it's not something that we want to see in the US. So this recognition that cbdcs can be tools for surveillance.
00:26:37.024 - 00:26:51.542, Speaker C: So again, a cherry on top for a more crypto friendly shift in the US, which is just amazing news. I think it has even deeper and.
00:26:51.598 - 00:27:43.014, Speaker A: Farther spanning consequences for the crypto industry than bitcoin and Ethereum ETF's. So we will see. Hopefully this is a movement and trend that continues. And then final big topic that I wanted to discuss that happened this week is this drama with Ethereum foundation researchers accepting advisory roles from Eigen layer. What happened was that Kobe, the crypto influencer, investor, etcetera, he tweeted that he knew that ethereum foundation researchers were taking huge advisory roles from Eigen Lair. And after that tweet, Justin Drake and.
00:27:44.634 - 00:28:08.934, Speaker C: Dankard Feist actually admitted that they were the ones who had taken on these advisory roles. They didn't respond directly to Kobe. But you know, it was a bit of a too big of a coincidence that these disclosures happened after Kobe's tweet. And Justin said that he had taken.
00:28:10.194 - 00:28:46.032, Speaker A: Huge, huge pay package with this advisory role. We're talking about millions of dollars of tokens vesting over three years. Okay? So this is not just, you know, like an advisory role that you get maybe, you know, a mention and a few tokens. This is like life changing amount of money. So obviously this calls concerns about conflict of interest between Ethereum and these researchers. This is a project that's built on.
00:28:46.048 - 00:30:12.014, Speaker C: Ethereum, that has different interests than Ethereum itself. It's using staked east to restate to other projects. Vitalik even had this blog post outlining the potential risks that this can carry. For example, if there's a big project that compiles a large amount of restate ETH and it fails, what happens with that ETH? The Eigen layer protocol and community or ecosystem might want to deal with a scenario like that in one way, while the Ethereum ecosystem might want to deal with that kind of slashing scenario in a different way. I mean, that's just one of many different conflicts that may arise from this. So in any case, there's this question of should Ethereum foundation researchers and developers be taking such huge pay packages and positions in protocols and projects that may not align directly with Ethereum? And obviously we had different takes.
00:30:12.094 - 00:30:45.424, Speaker A: Lefteris Carabestas, founder of Rothke, said, I am appalled that EF researchers, the people who guide protocol development, take six to seven figure compensation packages from protocols. Six to seven figure was actually underestimated. It's actually bigger than that, by the way. He said, this is a clear as day conflict of interest of key decision makers of Ethereum. But then, you know, on the other hand, like Hudson Jamieson pointed out.
00:30:47.684 - 00:30:47.996, Speaker C: He.
00:30:48.020 - 00:31:50.384, Speaker A: Said, I'm concerned that this type of pure idealism could result in good, honest core developers and researchers leaving Ethereum protocol development because they aren't allowed to partake in the same advising situations than others. So he's saying there's these huge opportunities for EF researchers, and if they can't participate, then that might result in them leaving the EF. And there's this just longstanding problem of EF compensation packages not being competitive enough in the market. Basically, there's been some rumblings that Ethereum researchers and developers aren't making as much as they should. So, you know, they are kind of more attracted or tempted to take on these advisory roles and like, other compensation opportunities.
00:31:51.384 - 00:32:11.404, Speaker C: So it's a tough one. I don't know. I think the conflict of interest here is pretty clear. I think it was Eigen layer dangling a very big carrot in front of these EF researchers. I mean, millions of dollars might be very, very hard to turn down.
00:32:12.384 - 00:32:19.150, Speaker A: Ayameguchi, the EF executive, said that in.
00:32:19.182 - 00:32:35.142, Speaker C: Response to this, they will issue new policy. So, you know, I think that that should have ideally been in place before, but this is common in all workplaces. Like, you just, you know, in a.
00:32:35.158 - 00:33:17.774, Speaker A: Full time position, you're meant to be full time. You can't be working for others and much less others that have a conflict with the place you work. I mean, this is, you know, it's not super out of the ordinary that this just is not allowed to happen in most workplaces. So why should it happen in, you know, in Ethereum, which is, which should be held even to a higher standard because it's a base layer for all of these other protocols. Like it's supposed to be the world computer. Like, you just cannot have conflicts of interest. Like Aya said, it's supposed to be credibly neutral.
00:33:17.774 - 00:33:27.554, Speaker A: If you have people in the Ethereum foundation taking million dollar compensation packages from other projects that conflict with Ethereum.
00:33:29.494 - 00:33:29.782, Speaker C: I.
00:33:29.798 - 00:33:41.642, Speaker A: Don'T think that should be allowed. Maybe there's a discussion there of having to improve compensation for people in the EF.
00:33:41.698 - 00:33:44.458, Speaker C: Sure. But at some point, you know, like.
00:33:44.506 - 00:33:51.738, Speaker A: When you're working in any, anywhere, you need to make a decision, do you.
00:33:51.786 - 00:33:54.426, Speaker C: Think that your work there and your.
00:33:54.450 - 00:33:57.854, Speaker A: Compensation there is worth it for you?
00:33:58.314 - 00:34:00.426, Speaker C: If not, you should leave and go.
00:34:00.530 - 00:34:05.708, Speaker A: Work at someplace else that compensates you in the way that you want? I mean, I don't think it's fair.
00:34:05.756 - 00:34:24.624, Speaker C: That, or I don't think people can have it both ways. That's my own opinion. So that's it for today. I've extended myself a little bit. So those are all the headlines that we'll go over.
00:34:25.164 - 00:34:56.565, Speaker A: Let me know what you think about the Eve ETF about this new crypto friendly regulatory environment in the US. And super interested to hear your thoughts on the Eigen layer EF conflict of interest as well. See you all next week. And also, sorry that we missed the past couple of weeks. We had a bunch of travel and stuff going on at the defiant where we couldn't have our regular schedule, but we're back on track with crypto with Cami, so see you next.
