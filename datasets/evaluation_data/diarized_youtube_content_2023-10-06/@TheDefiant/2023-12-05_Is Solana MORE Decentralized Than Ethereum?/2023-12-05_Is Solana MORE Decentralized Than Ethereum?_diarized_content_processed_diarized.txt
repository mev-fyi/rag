00:00:00.490 - 00:00:23.594, Speaker A: So you can look at the Nakamoto coefficient. I think on Salana is like 23, I think it's 20. On Ethereum, this is like the minimum number of operators that it takes to shut down the network. And it's a liveness failure. It's not like a failure to safety. So the way that the real physical. I have this meme that like economic security is a meme.
00:00:23.594 - 00:01:01.290, Speaker A: Like this is what I talk about on Twitter all the time. And this is because the security of the network really comes from the full nodes. Any single copy of the ledger doesn't matter if it's staked or not. Doesn't matter if it's a RPC for monkeys, NFT DaO, or it's the node run by circle, or it's binance, or it's just your home computer. Any single copy of the ledger has all the signatures from everyone else in the network. And it can provide a proof of the particular ledger and state transitions that the network came to. So it's enough to validate the state, just any single copy.
00:01:01.290 - 00:01:29.318, Speaker A: So that large number of validators on Salana, about 3000. Any one of those that survives an attack, that's enough. Like one. Any one of them, right? This is what really gives the network security for safety and liveness is a different property. Bugs happen, network outages happen. That doesn't kill the network, it just stops block production. And even on bitcoin, when the chinese miners shut down, you had a two hour gap between block production.
00:01:29.318 - 00:01:47.914, Speaker A: It's not like bitcoin was dead. It just literally didn't make blocks. Because of how bitcoin is configured. Because of how Solana is configured, if there is congestion that blows up the network, all the nodes basically halt. They stop making blocks. So safety is not touched. But like liveness, you can have impact.
00:01:47.914 - 00:02:15.842, Speaker A: So Nakamoto coefficient is the minimum number of operators that could halt the network. But that doesn't mean that the network can restart. Any single copy can be used to restart it. In terms of stakers, Salana has 300,000. Ethereum has about 600 700,000 stakers, roughly half that. These are numbers that are kind of organically increasing. That's simply people use the network and stake and do their activity.
00:02:15.842 - 00:02:39.818, Speaker A: Ethereum calls validators, stakers. So that we call full nodes validators. What we call validators, they call full nodes what they call validators, we call stakers. There's a best thing about crypto is every, every layer, one has their own terms for everything. There's roughly 3000 Salana validators there's roughly 6000 Ethereum full nodes.
