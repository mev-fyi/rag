00:00:00.160 - 00:00:32.415, Speaker A: RWS in general, it's a pretty exciting space. A lot of our partners that we've been speaking with, they're very excited for next year because a lot of institutions are moving into the space. A lot of retail is catching onto our messaging of DEFI and RWAs, which we call RWAFI. So I think the future is pretty bright. My name is Teddy. I'm one of the co founders and CVO of Plume. You know, before Plume, I used to work in traditional finance, then I worked at Coinbase.
00:00:32.415 - 00:01:10.385, Speaker A: I joined the crypto industry in 2021 basically when I joined their Corp, Dev and ventures team, worked at a DEFI protocol and then spent some time at Binance specifically for BNB chain. And that's kind of, you know, where the idea, at least from my perspective, we have three co founders. From my perspective, that's kind of where the idea of Plume started. So on a high level, you know, what we're building is an EVM chain that's fully focused on real world assets. You know, there's three things that we're really focused on. One is tooling, two is composability, and three is distribution. I think in, you know, the RWA space, traditionally the biggest issue is people in the RWA space, they just are more tradfi in nature.
00:01:10.385 - 00:01:30.041, Speaker A: So they come into the RWA world, they're building Trad5 products, but they don't realize that it's on crypto rails. So what we're building is really an ecosystem to help bring these assets on chain, help to distribute to the hands of the right investors and create different trading and liquidity opportunities by using DEFI embedded into the chain as well.
00:01:30.153 - 00:01:42.049, Speaker B: So we're at the EEA Day in Bangkok right now. I wanted to ask what brings you here given that there's like 900 other side events happening in Bangkok, why particularly EA day?
00:01:42.097 - 00:02:19.659, Speaker A: Yeah, sounds good. So I actually met Paul actually at Singapore. He moderated my panel for the Art of a Summit. And when we first met, we thought that there'd be a lot of ways for us to work together. Since he was running the EEA from, I guess, the EY side and we're building an Ethereum chain that's fully focused on rwa. So when Paul kind of got a glance of what we were building, since we were building a dedicated chain for real world assets, he thought it would make sense to have us come out and join the eea. But not only that, come and speak at a specific EA panel.
00:02:19.659 - 00:02:50.881, Speaker A: So today we're out here really educating Folks on why tokenization is important, how we can embed it with DEFI to create new different opportunities that we call art of afi. And really just meeting the different builders in the Ethereum space. I was just coming off a panel, we spoke with the Arbitrum team, the CELO team and the settlement team about just Ethereum blockchains, how we differ specifically and why real world assets are important. So yeah, it's been a great day, a lot of cool folks and happy to be here.
00:02:50.953 - 00:02:58.625, Speaker B: Could you elaborate on Plume Network's modular blockchain architecture and how it benefits the deployment and management of RWAs?
00:02:58.745 - 00:03:53.207, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So you know, our technology and our blockchain is very modular in nature, which really means, you know, we are, at the end of the day, we're building a permissionless chain that's dedicated for real world assets. But at the same time we also need a compliance architecture in place for the more enterprise and institutional folks that we're working with. What we're building is actually a modular tech stack where we can help provide any compliance needs that any of these enterprise folks need, whether it's KYC at the application level, AML at the node and chain level 0 knowledge technology. What we really specialize in is being mobile and nimble. So let's say we're working with a new asset issuer in a new jurisdiction for a new asset that maybe some of our partners can't really cover. We can integrate with a partner in that area and leverage their license to bring that asset on compliantly.
00:03:53.207 - 00:04:25.779, Speaker A: So by having a modular tech stack, we could bring more assets on chain. And also on the more chain level, we're working with different DA layers like Celestia. We've been speaking with AIGEN as well to really find a way to mimic the real world on chain. And what that means is basically creating a chain where gas fees are pretty much close to zero and we can really create this experience that is very similar to the real world and bring on net new users from the Web2 space onto Web3.
00:04:25.907 - 00:04:32.771, Speaker B: So how does Plume Network integrate with existing DEFI applications to enhance liquidity and utility for tokenized RWAs?
00:04:32.883 - 00:05:10.573, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, so that's a good question. So we, you know, we actually have all the defi primitives that you would think of when you're looking at different chains. So we have different borrow lending protocols, we have different perp dexs, we have different AMMs. And the magic of what we're building is, you know, we actually, since we're a permissionless chain, we have A bunch of RWA assets on one side and a bunch of defi products on another. And by having everything on a single network, we can have them compose with one another to create different use cases that the on chain audience is used to. And this is really important because today what we see is, you know, the on chain audience today is still more crypto than tradfi. So you need to give them use cases that they're used to.
00:05:10.573 - 00:06:07.447, Speaker A: Basically how do you like borrow lend, how do you trade your assets? How do you yield farm specific assets? So what we're creating, you know, are, you know, it's basically like use cases where rws are under the hood but on top it's more crypto minded. And I guess a good example is kind of like the stablecoin, right? Stablecoin is permissionless, it's liquid, it looks and feels and smells like crypto. And tons of people in the defi ecosystem use it today versus if you look at other RWA assets. Sometimes the product market fit isn't necessarily there yet. So what we're trying to do is have all these DEFI primitives on our chain to make it familiar to the on chain audience, but also create new use cases and provide different trading opportunities. So like one of our, you know, one of our borrow lending protocols, we're working with them pretty closely to create different looping strategies for our yield bearing stablecoin. Specifically that we're working with other enterprise folks as well so that people can come onto Plume Mint a specific stablecoin.
00:06:07.447 - 00:06:27.975, Speaker A: We're under the hood, it's very institutional, great in nature, where we're working with the Paxos of the world and then they can collateralize their asset, borrow more stables against it, re buy the asset and just keep on looping. So that's just one specific example, but we're creating all these different defi strategies to make it feel like, you know, a real on chain economy in collaboration with eea.
00:06:28.015 - 00:06:34.207, Speaker B: How is Plume Network contributing to the development of industry standards for RWA tokenization?
00:06:34.351 - 00:07:13.001, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So we've been thinking about different, you know, token standards and maybe we can kind of recreate and contribute to EA in general. I would say the biggest focus for us right now is there are different tracks within ea and I don't think as of today there's been a track fully dedicated for real world assets. So you, our first push there is to really kind of create that educational track so we can start educating the folks within EEA and teach them more about how RWAS work and Then not only how RWAS work, but how they should trade in a normal ecosystem. So yeah, that's how we're kicking it off of the EA.
00:07:13.153 - 00:07:23.785, Speaker B: Awesome. I'd like to double down on RWAs a little bit more actually. So how does Plume Network facilitate the tokenization of real world assets? And what types of assets are you currently focusing on?
00:07:23.865 - 00:08:16.181, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, so that's a good question. So our main flagship product is called Plume Ark. What it is is basically a no code tokenization engine to help bring any types of assets on chain. And because it's no code in nature, we grab a lot of our, I guess, builders and developers off chain very upstream. So I think a good analogy is, you know, we're basically like the Stripe atlas for tokenization. So a lot of these issuers, they understand the benefits of tokenization, but they don't really understand how to bring an asset on chain. And you know, from some of our projects it sometimes takes like three, six to nine months of research and you know, there's a lot of moving pieces basically like which compliance partner do you use, which tokenization, you know, partner do you use on the other end, you know, which transfer agent would you also utilize? So what we've done is basically weaved all this together to create a funnel so that anyone can easily deploy any asset onto Plume.
00:08:16.181 - 00:08:25.565, Speaker A: And once it's on the Plume, I think that's where the real magic happens. We basically really help with the distribution piece and I think that is the true unlock there.
00:08:25.645 - 00:08:32.493, Speaker B: What measures are in place to ensure compliance and security in the tokenization process of RWAs?
00:08:32.629 - 00:09:22.451, Speaker A: Yeah, so what we do is we integrate with a bunch of different KYC providers, AML providers, on and off ramps in different parts of the world and in doing so we can actually leverage their licenses. So if there's a specific asset issuer in a specific jurisdiction that is needing a specific license to bring their asset on chain, we can always integrate with a partner in that region. They can leverage our stack to issue assets in a different region that they're not very local to because our stack is fully compliant and also has a lot of reach in that sense. So our go to market strategy was always to, to be very quick and compliant and holistic. And we found that the best way was to create some stuff in house, but to also integrate with different partners so that we can leverage their licenses whenever our ecosystem projects would need it.
00:09:22.523 - 00:09:34.307, Speaker B: Just looking ahead, what's coming up for Plume Network, what's the plans for next year, particularly concerning the expansion of rwa Tokenization and other ecosystem developments.
00:09:34.411 - 00:10:00.223, Speaker A: That's a good question. So I think just recently we finished our test net. It was a two month testnet that include a lot of our ecosystem projects on the RWA5 side. And it was a pretty successful test. We had around 280 million transactions, 18 million wallets, 4 million were unique. And now for us, the next step is basically weaving everything together. So we have around a little bit over 180 projects building on us.
00:10:00.223 - 00:10:38.045, Speaker A: We're tokenizing a few billion dollars worth of assets. We have a bunch of capital committed on the capital side with mainnet around the corner. For us, it's later this year, later at Q4. Right now we're focusing on weaving all the pieces together and coordinating this so that we can have a successful mainnet launch. And then from there we'll be focusing a lot on the institutional push. We started this a few months ago, but now that our brand has grown bigger, we're at the inflection point where we can speak with the different enterprises and institutions of the world, hence why we're here today. And they have a lot of interest in tokenizing assets.
00:10:38.045 - 00:11:11.945, Speaker A: But I think there's one thing with tokenizing assets and there's another piece of it where we're taking these assets onto a permissionless chain and creating new trading opportunities and liquidity opportunities for these enterprises. And so the way they view us is more of a distribution channel for them since we have all the partnerships already lined up for them, so they don't need to do any of the hard work. So for us, I would say it's mainnet around the corner. We're finalizing some of our different product launches as well and then doing a big institutional push over the next few quarters.
00:11:12.645 - 00:11:32.521, Speaker B: I'd also like to ask a question about the competition in this field as you've participated and also sponsoring the RWA Summit, I'm sure you've come across other l like networks that are focused on RWAs. How would you say Pulum is different from the other ones that are doing something similar like. Yeah, like yours?
00:11:32.593 - 00:11:59.895, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that's a good question. I would say, you know, at Plumer really focus on building real products. I would say, you know, a lot of our venture backers, they're very U.S. institutional. So it's like Galaxy Digital, Han Ventures, Reciprocal Ventures. We have some investors in Asia like Superscript and you know, Hash Key. So what really separates us from the pack is I would say our go to market traction in our technology.
00:11:59.895 - 00:13:11.095, Speaker A: So our stack is fully focused on Real world assets where a permissionless nature with a modular opt in compliance architecture where if you need the benefits and the use cases of a permission chain, you can come to us and we still provide that. Yet on the other side we still have a permissionless nature so that enterprise and institutional folks can still get liquidity and different opportunities from the crypto ecosystem. They're not just closed off in a black box like how they were before. So by hosting everything on one network, we're able to create these different network effects. And I think once you couple that with the traction that we've had over the last year or so with our test net metrics, with over 180 projects that we're working with the billion dollars of assets that we're tokenizing, I think we've created, excuse me, we've created a pretty strong moat around our product and our brand to really be the Premier leading RWA5 chain to help anyone tokenize any asset, distribute it on chain and create different opportunities and new opportunities within the DeFi ecosystem that I think the RWA space really hasn't seen before. So it's a pretty exciting time and I think by positioning ourselves from a chain perspective, first has created a lot of opportunities for us.
00:13:11.675 - 00:13:24.671, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, do you have any final words you'd like to share about being a member of EEA or EEA Day in general or just the RWA field? Any final words?
00:13:24.783 - 00:13:59.579, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, like, first of all, super excited to be part of the EA and officially, you know, speaking at our first EA panel today. I think there's a lot we can do with the EA community, especially from the RWA side. I think there's a lot of knowledge and market research we've gathered over the last year that we're happy to share and give back to the community. And I think, you know, RWS in general, it's a pretty exciting space. A lot of our, you know, partners that we've been speaking with, they're very excited for next year because a lot of institutions are moving to the space. A lot of retail is catching onto our messaging of, you know, DEFI and RWAs, which we call RWA Fi.
00:13:59.579 - 00:14:12.309, Speaker A: So I think the future is pretty bright and for us, like our main focus is, you know, launching our mainnet and then from there we'll be, you know, continuing to grow the brand. So I'm very excited to be here today and thanks for having me.
00:14:12.467 - 00:14:19.305, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, it was great to chat with you. This was very interesting and also looking forward to the mainnet from Plume network.
00:14:19.385 - 00:14:19.985, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you.
