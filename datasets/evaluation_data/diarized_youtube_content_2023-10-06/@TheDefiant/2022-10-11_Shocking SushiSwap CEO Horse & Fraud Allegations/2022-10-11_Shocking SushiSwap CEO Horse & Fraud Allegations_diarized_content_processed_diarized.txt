00:00:00.170 - 00:00:16.270, Speaker A: Today we're taking a look at Jared Gray, whose appointment as CEO of Sushislap sent the sushi coin tumbling because of accusations that he had committed fraud and, incredibly, that he had inappropriate relations with a horse.
00:00:18.370 - 00:00:22.426, Speaker B: Obviously, Jared has denied all the accusations.
00:00:22.618 - 00:01:02.334, Speaker A: I mean, who wouldn't? But this is doing sushi swap no favors. So the sushi token is down about 10% to $1.2 at the time of recording. And that's from $13 at its 52 week high, and a really bad 95% drop from its all time high of over $20. So while your sushi tokens may be at risk, at least one Twitter user assured us that the Unisop unicorn had been moved to a safe place.
00:01:02.452 - 00:01:04.706, Speaker B: And while the bestiality claims may or.
00:01:04.728 - 00:02:22.502, Speaker A: May not be true, let's look at the fraud allegations, which are arguably more serious. So Jared Gray previously participated in a project called Alqo, and a community member of that project is saying that Jared siphoned 70% of the project's funds by introducing an external wallet into the project. This same person also claims that Jared made some copyright infringement in another project that he participated in. Again, Jared has denied all of these accusations. Now that we're caught up on all the different claims and accusations against Jared Gray, let's take a look at how we got here, because this type of turmoil is not new at Sushiswap, and in fact, it has been going on for the last few months. In December, former Sushiswap CTO Joseph DeLong gave us a rare glimpse into Sushiswap's inner workings, and he painted a picture of, frankly, just structural chaos. If you want more details on his learnings about working in this Dao, you should take a look at our podcast with Joseph, which we published recently.
00:02:22.566 - 00:02:52.622, Speaker B: And now let's hear a quick word from our sponsors which make this channel possible. And then we'll come back to Jared Gray.

00:02:52.766 - 00:03:24.762, Speaker A: Now, Sushisop's own origin story is pretty wild too. Remember that the Dex got its start by launching a vampire attack on Unisop, the DFI's main decks. It was able to drain about a billion dollars of Unisop TDL, and after that, the Sushiswap CEO. At the time, chef Nomi cashed out on 14 million of Sushisub tokens, only to promptly return the funds after a community outcry. Now let's put the history books aside.
00:03:24.826 - 00:03:29.822, Speaker B: And just take a look at how remarkable it is that a community is.
00:03:29.876 - 00:04:41.430, Speaker A: Able to elect its own CEO, in this case of one of the biggest dexes in Defi. And the fact that this happens is because token holders are given governance rights. In this case, they chose to elect Jared Gray as CEO, or head chef, as Sushiswap calls it. But this is the latest in a series of governance decisions about how Sushiswap is being run. One of the latest decisions came in August, where the community voted to cut CEO salaries to about 500K from 850K as the base salary, which, if the person had met all its targets, could amount to a staggering $10 million payout. So the community voted against this and decided to have a maybe more reasonable CEO pay. So this means that token governance votes don't always have to turn out to be controversial.
00:04:41.430 - 00:05:11.850, Speaker A: And who knows, maybe after all these allegations come to light, the community might come together and vote in another direction. But that's yet to be seen. In any case, I'm sure all of you, and at least we at the defiant were more interested in seeing become a space for financial inclusion and democratization, and not into this crazy telenovela drama and should we say horse race.
