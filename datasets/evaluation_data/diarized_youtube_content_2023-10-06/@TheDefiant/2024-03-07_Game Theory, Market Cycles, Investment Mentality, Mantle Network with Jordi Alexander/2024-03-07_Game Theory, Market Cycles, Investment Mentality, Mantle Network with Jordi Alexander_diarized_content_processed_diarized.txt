00:00:00.320 - 00:00:46.065, Speaker A: The best thing to do right now is collaborate. So we're at the cycle point where the best returns are, you know, from people that are sharing with each other. There's a huge market and it's growing massively right now. So if you're involved in crypto in any way, you're actually better off. Instead of trying to like, you know, capture little opportunities for yourself, you're better off sharing things and creating, you know, tit for tat positive interactions. And so, you know, collaboration is the right strategy right now for the market that we're in and this kind of growing bull market. And hopefully if we do that together, the space will do a lot better than it did last time with these SPF type of people that were not doing things very collaboratively.
00:00:48.485 - 00:00:52.021, Speaker B: Jordy, thanks for coming on. It's great to have you on the defined show.
00:00:52.093 - 00:00:58.685, Speaker A: I'm excited. It's a busy time in the markets, busy time in crypto. It's a great time to chat about everything going on.
00:00:58.765 - 00:01:40.801, Speaker B: Exactly. And we're going to get into a lot of topics today. I'll just kick it off with your intro. So, Jordy, you're the founder of Selini Capital, which is a trading and venture firm focused on digital assets. And you're also focused on the Mantle Network, which is a modular layer 2 EVM compatible blockchain that uses optimistic roll ups. But before venturing into crypto, you were a professional poker player and you've competed in the Mind Sports Olympiad and you're an expert in game theory in general. So can you possibly just walk us through your journey with all these like key highlights that led you to discovering crypto and eventually working in it?
00:01:40.913 - 00:02:03.009, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess you could say, like, it's a perfect storm or my background really prepared me for the craziness of crypto. Crypto is really right now as the form that we see it in. It's part financial product. So, you know, we are talking about investments and digital assets. Ultimately, like crypto is cryptocurrency related. Like, you know, you're exchanging value. That's the main kind of purpose of crypto.
00:02:03.009 - 00:02:35.753, Speaker A: And so the experience I have in the traditional finance world, you know, for 10 years working at some of the largest trading firms is quite relevant. And then you could say that my poker background kind of prepares me for the kind of crazy stuff that we see sometimes, you know, the meme coins and the speculation and the NFTs and all these things are, I guess, something that, you know, they're not as strategic as poker, but they are very much, you know, in that type of, you know, human psychology world.
00:02:35.889 - 00:03:04.389, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah, there's, there are many examples of like poker players turning into crypto. I want to get into a bit of game theory because I've listened to your podcast with Suzu from a couple of years ago focusing on game theory. I have a background in neuroeconomics and I've studied game theory a little bit academically as well. So it's a field that I'm really, really interested in. So I just want to get from your perspect, like the ways that you apply game theory principles within crypto.
00:03:04.477 - 00:04:06.335, Speaker A: Yeah, so crypto is all about game theory. These things permeate every aspect. Whether you're trading and you're trying to, you know, figure out what to buy before other people buy and when to sell before they sell. You know, there's a lot of mass coordination, especially like, as we saw with GameStop, if everything is coordinated in the same place, there's like a huge power that kind of goes with it. And understanding that and the game theory behind it is very useful. And then you could say, like, there's the micro structure level where individual protocols, the designs of how all these defi protocols or like these other gaming protocols are and how you win tokens or lose tokens depending on, you know, decisions you make, like should you stop, should you lock up, you know, do like a ve 4 year lockup or do you, do you go for the quick returns or, you know, there's all these game theory decisions and the reality is like, we're very early on as an industry and there's a lot of mistakes being made. And if you understand game theory, at least, you know, you can avoid pitfalls.
00:04:06.335 - 00:04:15.991, Speaker A: But you can also, to be honest, find very like, good opportunities for, you know, plus cv, you know, positive expectation decisions also.
00:04:16.103 - 00:04:21.661, Speaker B: And how can we, like, explore those concepts to find those, like, expectations? Basically, yeah.
00:04:21.693 - 00:05:10.101, Speaker A: You know, you have everything from things that are designed just sort of as a game theory, as a game. So, you know, we had Olympus Dao that was like one example of, you know, people trying to coordinate and lock up tokens and all these things. So if you study it and understand it, you know, you can either just not participate and avoid, you know, because you realize there's some pyramids being built or you can, you know, try to enter and exit at the wrong time. Me personally, I'm more of a practitioner, I don't like to stay in the academic world. So even though on the one side when you see something is not sustainable academically, you might just say, okay, I'm not going to get involved. But from a trader practical standpoint, you might still find opportunities to get involved in some of these projects and see what happens.
00:05:10.213 - 00:05:40.609, Speaker B: Olympus style was the perfect example for it because it was just basically a copy paste of almost Prisoner's Dilemma. The ultimate purpose was to just play a coordinated game long term and like the outcome is like everybody wins. So that turned out to be true for a brief period of time. Then everything went wrong. Like, why does that happen? Why didn't it not continue to be a sustainable thing for the people involved in it?
00:05:40.697 - 00:06:21.373, Speaker A: Yeah, this has been happening many times in crypto, not just Olympus Dao, but you know, you start with a small group and they can coordinate and become tribal and sort of like nobody sells and diamond handing and just sort of marking up the, you know, the market price. And when you mark up the market price, it looks like very successful. Doesn't mean people can get out and liquidate their positions. Especially, you know, if somebody has like 5, 10% of the token, they're not going to be able to get out at that market price. But with Olympus, you know, people started to think that it was Potentially this like 33 meme that meant that, you know, you're actually better off by not selling. You know, you're better off by holding and the people who sell are worse off. That was actually just never true.
00:06:21.373 - 00:06:55.125, Speaker A: It wasn't true from the beginning. It was never true. At any point. Just at some point somebody said, okay, you know, I have to take care of my family por mi familia, you know, I'm gonna sell my like $5 million, $10 million, whatever happened. And that just started this cascade where, you know, it's like a rush for the exits and the exit is very small. So this has happened many times. Like that was one obvious example, but you could even say that Luna and UST were another example that was much larger and much more institutional and people kind of got tricked by this stablecoin analogy, thinking it was a stablecoin and when it was, it was just a Ponzi.
00:06:55.245 - 00:07:11.133, Speaker B: Arguably you can say that the Olympus style game theory aspect was more like a meme or like a narrative that they were playing more than actual like game theory mechanics itself. As you said, those three, three was just like a narrative to keep people engaged.
00:07:11.229 - 00:07:49.411, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think it worked for a while. I mean a lot of things worked last cycle. You know, people were doing 10,000 PfP collections and if they had a nice catchy Artwork and a name to it, you know, people would buy it and you know, most of these things from a game theory perspective of the founder, they're just collecting all the money up front and they don't have to do anything. They don't have to deliver any like roadmap or anything. You've already incentivized them from the beginning, which is very wrong. So this is kind of like why we're not seeing these like massive PFP collections anymore. I think, you know, incentives are needing to be aligned in order for good outcomes.
00:07:49.411 - 00:07:54.055, Speaker A: And, you know, each cycle the industry is learning things that work and don't work.
00:07:54.175 - 00:08:13.615, Speaker B: What can we learn from game theory from a perspective from an investor, a trader, or someone who's involved with the ecosystem involved in crypto on a daily basis? What are some key insights and takeaways can someone who doesn't know about game theory much can learn according to you?
00:08:13.695 - 00:08:46.243, Speaker A: Yeah, the term game theory, people think of John Nash and movies and stuff and things like gigabrain stuff. All you need to know is two things. One, incentives are everything. So you should always be thinking about incentives, what incentives are getting created for what behavior. Two, think about other people's mindset. You need to kind of put yourself in their psychology because game theory is all about, you know, how does the collective strategies come together. So everyone is like doing their own thing.
00:08:46.243 - 00:09:23.389, Speaker A: But this creates a dynamic that that's what game theory is. So think about what other people's incentives are. That's the bottom line when it comes to trading. You look at the other market participants that are pushing the market and are you early or are you their exit liquidity? This is something that should be in everyone's mind constantly when it comes to projects. What are the incentives of the people building? Are they going to do a long term project or are they doing a short term project, for example, being able to navigate these things, you have to think about other people's incentives all day. That's what I do.
00:09:23.517 - 00:09:33.757, Speaker B: So I want to get into Cellini Capital. Can you briefly get into how you started it and what was your motivation behind Salini Capital?
00:09:33.861 - 00:10:24.337, Speaker A: Yeah, so I've been personally into crypto for years. First got exposed in 2016, but that was on a PA sort of side. And around 2020 when the volumes really started picking up and bitcoin, after Covid was becoming like a very active traded instrument, I sort of set up a sub team in my main traditional trading team and I put a few people on it and we started dabbling into trading. The Crypto assets. And every few months a couple more people would migrate over. And this kept happening because the opportunity was just growing and it was much bigger there. And so at some point, you know, we just kind of went all in and spun off Cellini and it's only focused on crypto now.
00:10:24.441 - 00:10:27.833, Speaker B: Interesting. And how big is the team now at this point?
00:10:27.929 - 00:10:29.625, Speaker A: Yeah, teams of 40 people now.
00:10:29.705 - 00:10:35.753, Speaker B: How big are like these capital or like investment firms usually? And where do you sit within that capacity and size?
00:10:35.849 - 00:11:01.795, Speaker A: Yeah, there's different types of firms. There's funds. So funds are basically external capital. It's called LP capital. And you go to, you know, wealthy investors or institutional investors and you raise money and then you invest their money and you kind of keep some of it. Right. The traditional sort of hedge fund structure, there's some of those in crypto, but more on the venture side, on the high frequency trading side, which is, you know, a lot of what we do as well.
00:11:01.795 - 00:11:46.923, Speaker A: You actually have more prop funds because the amount of investment you need to do is so high that once you do it, you don't want to share returns with external investors. Because the hard part is actually, you know, building infrastructure and connecting everywhere and having very low latency, you know, technology. So we are a prop firm. You could, you could say, you know, JUMP is one example of another prop firm that has, you know, been in crypto. And that's the best analogy. And you know, at this point, we are one of the largest in the world. We, we have started trading, you know, over 10 billion volume A day in this market, which is, you know, certainly like one of the, one of the top, you know, traders in the world right now.
00:11:47.019 - 00:11:52.147, Speaker B: And how would you describe the investment philosophy of Selena Capital?
00:11:52.251 - 00:12:22.145, Speaker A: Yeah, so I mentioned the high frequency trading side, which is obviously, you know, more market neutral and liquidity provision. We also do ventures, so we do maybe like four deals a month, maybe one a week. So we invest in things that we understand well. So a lot of defi infrastructure. We are starting to actually also invest in web3 games. We are getting into it and it looks like an interesting growing space. And so we're quite open.
00:12:22.145 - 00:12:32.305, Speaker A: And then we're also starting to look at the AI x crypto intersection. Given that a lot of our team has a strong technical slant, can you.
00:12:32.385 - 00:12:36.317, Speaker B: Possibly name a few projects that you've invested in the gaming sector?
00:12:36.441 - 00:13:06.149, Speaker A: Yeah, so recently, this last month, we were excited to work with like three of the largest and most, you know, promising ones. So we've invested in Obaby Games, which is a Very crypto native. You know there's all these like crypto Twitter characters like Kobe and they're, they're going around Go Karts. We've invested in Cypher, which is like a very blue chip game out of Vietnam and we've invested in Illuvium. So yeah, as you can see we're getting quite active in the space right now.
00:13:06.237 - 00:13:18.141, Speaker B: And are those projects mostly Ethereum based or like what's in general? My question is I guess does Selini Capital invest. Which ecosystems are you focused on?
00:13:18.253 - 00:14:09.565, Speaker A: So you know, some projects, you know, go to immutable. You know a lot of them are either doing their own chains or they're partnering with other chains. I think Obaby is about to announce a huge partnership with one of the most promising up and coming kind of chains. I don't want to pre announce but you know, sometimes it's not only Ethereum based. Yeah, the way these things work with these games is like generally like they will design the game, it's a lot of work, it's years of work and then they'll figure out the on chain component later last so they can actually keep the flexibility and you know like a game like Cypher doesn't actually have to decide until the very end where it wants its on chain assets to be. And you know there's a lot of bids by chains right now. It's very competitive.
00:14:09.565 - 00:14:26.663, Speaker A: There's millions of dollars being thrown as grants for promising games to put their on chain assets. I think it's not just because of the gas potential, it's also just the, you know, just the sheer value of attention that you can get from having a blue chip game association.
00:14:26.809 - 00:14:46.035, Speaker B: So you mentioned AI DeFi and gaming and I think one of the biggest narratives in particular the last couple of months has been like restaking. That sector is just blowing up. So is that something that you are focused on at Selini as well? Do you have like any interest or investments there?
00:14:46.155 - 00:15:27.811, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean you might have seen recently Etherfi announced the raise and you know we're part of that raise as well. So they're the kind of leading restaking option right now. They think they have 2.2 billion of TVL and you could say that mantle is quite focused on giving users the full yields that are possible and restaking is one of those options. So with Meath we have been exploring restaking extensively. We have 100,000 ETH staked into Eigenlayer as a sort of like a starting point. So that's generating a ton of Eigen points that we're going to be sharing with the Emeath community.
00:15:27.963 - 00:15:34.963, Speaker B: Oh, fascinating. How do you manage risk in Selenium Capital? What sort of strategies do you have around risk management?
00:15:35.059 - 00:15:54.397, Speaker A: Yeah, we don't really need to do any risk management. Thankfully, we're not needing to look at that stuff. We're not a liquid fund. So liquid funds are the ones that need to do a lot of risk management. We're at the two spectrums where you don't need to do risk management. So on the one hand you have venture where you're just, you have a certain amount of capital that you're going to be investing for the long term. Right.
00:15:54.397 - 00:16:33.411, Speaker A: And so, you know, there's just a matter of like choosing good projects. There's no risk management there. And then on the other side, you know, we're in the very like low latency market neutral side, so we're providing liquidity. And so, you know, those strategies are generally like, you know, fluctuating between, you know, long and short several times a day. So it's just more about like infrastructure risk, you know, nothing with your AWS setup or nothing else going wrong and less so about market risk, you know, market wise. We're obviously long in many ways of crypto. So we're long first, you know, through venture, we invested heavily in many projects.
00:16:33.411 - 00:16:48.887, Speaker A: We're long like as an industry because on the high frequency trading side, the more volume there is and the more things go up, we're sort of like benefiting from that activity. And so you could say that we are very structurally long and we're very bullish the space.
00:16:49.051 - 00:17:00.903, Speaker B: So just moving over to Mantle at this point. You have an interesting title at mantle, Chief Alchemist. Can you possibly elaborate on what that title is and what you do at Mantle?
00:17:00.999 - 00:18:08.919, Speaker A: Yeah, so because as I mentioned, I'm running quite a large firm, my involvement with MANTLE is to kind of bring magic and just kind of sprinkle some fairy dust on top of the cool things that they're doing. And so, you know, the Chief Alchemist title wasn't come up with me, but by the team at mantle. They kind of invited me to join in this title, which you could say that in all my spare time and all the time that I have available, I'm very passionate about what we're building at Mantle and I'm very involved in building up the ecosystem. And really I have the desire and need to do things in a new way. And I hate just like cloning stuff and doing, you know, UNISWAP deployment 69 and AAVE 52 and taking meme Coin and putting Inu in front and then like doing this stuff. So everything that I'm doing is really trying to scratch that itch that I have as a builder to innovate. And Mantle is a fantastic kind of playground because of the amount of resources and the amount of talented people.
00:18:08.919 - 00:18:09.471, Speaker A: There's.
00:18:09.533 - 00:18:18.299, Speaker B: How do you manage your time between Sellini Capital and Mantle? Because they both seem like they take a lot of time, a lot of energy. How do you do that?
00:18:18.387 - 00:18:50.771, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't think anyone knows. It's just sort of, you know, a lot of context switching. I used to get exhausted by context switching. You know, mentally it's very difficult, but I do have an extensive training and mental focus for many hours. You know, I used to play chess, you know, like not professionally, but on a world level and then poker and bridge and I can really just spend 15 hours a day context switching and keeping up with things. So how is it done? I have no idea.
00:18:50.771 - 00:18:55.435, Speaker A: And I'll reflect on it in five years maybe when things calm down.
00:18:55.555 - 00:19:15.869, Speaker B: So a classic question is, how is Mantle different from other Layer twos? Right? Because there are just so many L2s and there are still so many L2s to come. Like there's almost every month there's a new L2 being announced. So how does Mantle fit in the L2 space?
00:19:15.957 - 00:19:43.791, Speaker A: Yeah, there's very few layer Twos that are similar to Mantle. Actually there's zero when you dig in. So on the one side, like, there's obviously, you know, some like, very good association with a very large, you know, top four centralized exchange. You could say that Base has that. I think, you know, OKX and Binance haven't successfully been able to, you know, create a strong L2 at this point. So, you know, base is the only one in that category. You move on to the next category.
00:19:43.791 - 00:20:33.821, Speaker A: You know, there's a. There's a huge treasury of like real assets. So not, not the native Token, but you know, Ethereum and stablecoins. So having over a billion, you know, at this point, significantly over including, I think, you know, about 300,000 ethnic, that's a huge bazooka that a new L2 that's just trying to launch and do some games doesn't have. And that generates a lot of opportunities to create deep liquidity, attract a lot of good projects. And so the combination of those two things is quite rare and it kind of opens up the design space for someone like me to, you know, build things like Me, for example, this would not really be possible with another chain.
00:20:33.933 - 00:20:41.845, Speaker B: So can we talk about the main use cases for mantle right now? What are the most used applications we can find on mantle?
00:20:41.925 - 00:21:44.859, Speaker A: Yeah, so mantle is very much, you could say, you know, bread and butter starts from the defi space because of, you know, the large amount of assets that we have that we can incentivize, you know, liquidity with. So you can say that, you know me, mantle staked ether is the first sort of blockbuster product to come out of mantle and that's, you know, a very fundamental building block. So it's over $2 billion right now, which is, you know, very crazy to think about. You know, this, this was a little idea that we had maybe nine months ago and it's sort of built up to where it is. So having that building block where you have a fantastic yield generating product with sustainable yield. And then we also are working very hard on the stablecoin side and we want to pair those two together and then we'll kind of like see the amazing things that can come out. So on the stablecoin side we have around $60 million worth of Ondo USDY on chain which is generating 5% in treasury yield.
00:21:44.859 - 00:22:10.625, Speaker A: And at this point we have a huge 100 million in Ethena USD. And you could say that there is an internal project now to combine these things together and generate a single stable asset with a lot of rewards. So we're trying to innovate quite strongly in a way that nobody has on the stablecoin side.
00:22:11.085 - 00:22:29.397, Speaker B: Just today I checked the staking yield on on meth and currently it's around like 7.9 APY. How does mantle generate that amount of API like compared to the other staking services?
00:22:29.541 - 00:23:28.611, Speaker A: Yeah, so you're kind of crazy to be using anything but mantle ETH right now because the yield is like, you know, it's more than double, significantly more than double anything else you can possibly use. So the reason lies in the treasury that we talked about before. There's 300,000 ETH on the treasury side, so around a billion dollars of ETH. So out of the 2 billion, 1 billion is the Treasuries. And so we can incentivize the other 1 billion with our yield. So first that doubles the yield because we're kind of doing like a one to one double dose yield is sort of what we're calling it. And the other thing that we're doing is because of all the Eigen layer restaking that we've done as well, there's a ton of Eigen rewards that will, that will later be also passed on to only meth that's on L2 because we obviously want to incentivize people to bridge their meth and put it into the ecosystem on the L2 side.
00:23:28.611 - 00:23:38.091, Speaker A: So those are the ones that we'll be targeting for the Eigen side. But everybody, even on the L1 can join can enjoy right now the double dose of the yield.
00:23:38.243 - 00:23:55.039, Speaker B: Interesting. So how do you actually account the Eigen layer points system? Because like first of all 100% of that is going to go back to the community and feed the yield percentage. Right. So how do you calculate the yield that you're going to get from eigenlayer?
00:23:55.087 - 00:24:23.707, Speaker A: So eigenlayer, you shouldn't try to calculate it or whatever. It's just an extra airdrop. You know, we don't want people to be fomoing that they're not in getting Eigen points. So we're going to be trying to find the best way to airdrop them the Eigen rewards. So I don't call them points because we might just give directly the tokens depending on when the token launches. And you know, we'll be doing various snapshots and, and tracking activity. So that's something additional on top of the yield.
00:24:23.851 - 00:24:36.995, Speaker B: Just going back to the partnership with Ondo Finance, you mentioned the USDY conversion to MUSD that can be used as stablecoin on Mantle. Can you get into the sort of partnership with Ethena?
00:24:37.035 - 00:25:25.835, Speaker A: Yeah, those are two separate things. They're both in the category of stablecoins with yield. They're obviously very different. You know, one is getting it from Uncle Sam, the other one is getting it from, you know, degens that are leveraging long ethereum right on perpetual. So they're very different. You know, us as a Treasury, the way we see it is like, you know, we should be diversified into various yield bearing stablecoins and we have been progressively getting out of our USDC and USDT into these like very, very strong opportunities. And we're working internally on a secret project to generate a single coin, single stablecoin that can be used in all the defi that will actually be backed by you know, these different sort of diversified yield bearing assets.
00:25:25.835 - 00:25:52.399, Speaker A: Because the problem people have right now with liquidity is if you're going to do a pool, let's say like an eth USDC pool, do you use eth usdt, eth usdc eth Ondo, usdy eth eth dollars. Like there's so many and you know, they each have some benefits and some downsides and ultimately we will be finding hopefully a really nice way to combine them into a single stable asset.
00:25:52.487 - 00:25:56.103, Speaker B: So this is a secret project you're currently working on at Mantle?
00:25:56.239 - 00:25:56.791, Speaker A: Yes.
00:25:56.903 - 00:26:03.705, Speaker B: And is there an approximate, like roadmap or like expectation when the community can get something like this?
00:26:03.785 - 00:26:06.065, Speaker A: Yeah, Q2. So quite soon.
00:26:06.145 - 00:26:24.153, Speaker B: You're dropping a lot of Alpha today. That's awesome. And before we hit record today, you said that you're going to be. It's nighttime for you right now and you said you're going to be up for another 12 hours because of another interesting project that's coming up. Can you tell us a little bit about that?
00:26:24.249 - 00:26:54.969, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, I don't know exactly when this is coming out. Obviously we're recording on Thursday. I think right now what I can say will be quite evident later on. But I'm devising a project called Puff, which is on Mantle. You could call it a meme coin 2.0. So it's a very advanced version of what a Meme Coin can potentially be. And as part of that Meme Coin launch, which hasn't happened yet, it'll be happening very soon after, probably before this video airs.
00:26:55.137 - 00:26:56.345, Speaker B: When is it happening actually?
00:26:56.425 - 00:27:23.141, Speaker A: So tomorrow actually is the token launch of Puff. You'll potentially hear about the pre launch, which is an NFT potion that will summon Puff. Puff is this dragon. He is a black and golden dragon. He's part degen, that's the black side and he's part lawful, that's the golden side. And Puff will be summoned by the NFTs. So everybody who has a potion tomorrow and Friday will be able to summon Puff and get their coins.
00:27:23.141 - 00:27:51.215, Speaker A: So one meth worth of potion is going to summon 42,069 puff coins. And we have actually surpassed, I think 16 million of NFT mints. So this is the largest mint of the year now. It's surpassed the ordinals Quantum Cats mint. So quite a big deal. And we're looking forward to summoning Puff very soon.
00:27:51.295 - 00:28:02.823, Speaker B: Anyone can stake their eth on Mantle, get one meth and then turn that into the amount of Puff tokens that you mentioned. Right. Like they can still do that.
00:28:02.919 - 00:28:33.773, Speaker A: They can still do that. There's, you know, until midnight Eastern tonight. So if you get this movie, if you get this video out today until midnight Eastern. So there's still some time they can mint both on L1 and on L2. So we're doing a dual mint. There's an option to participate On Mainnet, if that's easier for people and they can go to the website, the official website don't get phished. You can check out the official sites, maybe you can put them below in the comments so people can check it.
00:28:33.789 - 00:28:38.429, Speaker B: Out and if they can't participate, they can go on the secondary.
00:28:38.517 - 00:28:49.835, Speaker A: Yes, so exactly. Once the token is launched, it'll be in a very large amm, so people will be able to access Puff coins directly without going through the potion.
00:28:49.965 - 00:28:58.167, Speaker B: So just trying to understand this myself as well. So you take the coins and then you can mint an NFT from that. Like what's the NFT on top of it?
00:28:58.311 - 00:29:02.015, Speaker A: You mint nft, then NFT will give you coins.
00:29:02.175 - 00:29:04.675, Speaker B: Okay. And then you can keep both or do you have to burn?
00:29:05.135 - 00:29:28.359, Speaker A: Keep both. But you know, there's metadata and nft. So depending on how much potion strength it has, that's how many coins you get. Once you, once you claim the coins, the metadata is going to change to zero. So you can't just keep claiming. You can only do it while the metadata of the coins is still alive. For this, you know, new cycle where the NFT market is still, it's still heating up again.
00:29:28.359 - 00:30:05.507, Speaker A: You know, it's early, it was, it was marked for dead for a while. But you know, you could say that this is not a pure NFT project and it's not a pure meme coin project. It's an evolution of what all those things are into a community metaverse defi world. And there'll be a lot of really cool experiences that puff holders will be able to do. There's a 3D room where puff will be able to fly around and interact in different ways. So it's super exciting. I think the best way to let people check it out is by experiencing it for themselves very soon.
00:30:05.611 - 00:30:24.231, Speaker B: I just want to talk about the structure of Mantle. So previously a year ago, approximately Bitdao transferred and rebranded as Mantle. Can you talk about like the structure of this change and what the rebrand represents?
00:30:24.303 - 00:30:55.411, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, it was a change from being more of an investment focused dao with all these like, you know, subdaos that were invested into and instead becoming like a product dao where, you know, we have the L2, we have the staking eth product. There's, there's sort of more products that we're talking about with a stablecoin. So we really just want to create things that people are using directly rather than just investing. And so it was a complete rebrand and a change of direction that I think is much more exciting and sensible.
00:30:55.523 - 00:30:58.475, Speaker B: Where do you think we are in the cycle at the moment?
00:30:58.555 - 00:31:30.709, Speaker A: Yeah, we're nowhere near the end of the cycle. We're let's say like third inning or maybe like late third inning. So we will obviously very likely be breaking all time highs in, in the majors if we haven't already on Bitcoin. I'm not sure if it sort of touched through or not. But you know, we're at the stage where we're entering price discovery. So price discovery means that we don't really know where the upside kind of risk reward balances. It could be, you know, much higher.
00:31:30.709 - 00:32:34.307, Speaker A: And so we're in this exciting period where there's a lot of trading going on, a lot of volume because the market is not sure where is the equilibrium between, you know, supply and demand. You know, you talk about economics, you have this, the traditional thing. It's very, very relevant right now because we have a new demand coming in from ETFs mainly right. And so that's starting to also like bring in some retail because they're starting to sniff that there's, there's some opportunities, the demand goes up. And then here's the cool thing about crypto. If you look at coins that have a limited supply that you know is like deflationary or potentially, you know, very low inflation like Bitcoin has, the supply can get very inelastic and so just some, some increase in demand can, can make the price move a lot because there's not a lot of people willing to sell, you know, at 65,000, at 70,000, who knows exactly where people's marginal, you know, selling interest comes, but it could be a lot higher. So you know, I've predicted an ethereum price at the start of year.
00:32:34.307 - 00:32:49.923, Speaker A: When we were 2000, I said 6 to 8,000. By end of year we're already at 4. So hopefully like I haven't, I thought I was being aggressive and people were sort of like surprised that I was that bullish. But we'll see where things end up, you know.
00:32:49.979 - 00:33:24.223, Speaker B: So you said 8,000 and I guess that's like a 10x from the bottom of, of the, from the bear market. Right. So another, another interesting aspect that you pointed out is like we're moving fast right now. We're at 4,000. I've seen a few like people talking about like this, this cycle is moving faster than expected and faster than previous cycles and it's going straight up right now. Right. So do you think that the cycles from now forward or even Just particularly this cycle is going to be shorter, faster, aggressive than the previous ones.
00:33:24.319 - 00:34:15.367, Speaker A: I think every, every cycle is different, completely unique to its environment. I call, you know, this could potentially be the largest cycle in terms of the starting point of the global market cap and the ending point. I don't think we'll have another one like it because this potentially could be the cycle where, you know, the large real money, right, like not the little crypto market caps that we're playing with, but the real, you know, trillion dollar things, sovereign wealth funds, these types of things. If this is the cycle that they potentially are sort of fomoed in, which is looking possible, this could be the largest cycle and it'll give it a unique flavor. You know, not every asset will perform well, but some that are obvious, you know, like bitcoin, Ethereum and some, some other ones will, will potentially do very well.
00:34:15.511 - 00:34:35.529, Speaker B: Do you think the sort of injection of like traditional tradfi boomer money entering like crypto, is it going to make crypto markets more stagnant, slow and boring going forward? Do you think this is going to be the last, like big, massive, crazy cycle?
00:34:35.657 - 00:35:06.069, Speaker A: I think, you know, by the time we get to gold, we are many years away from that kind of boring, stagnant. Oh, it moved 1%. Like, okay, cool. We're nowhere near that. I'm not gonna even think about when that's gonna happen because I can't even see it in the horizon. It will eventually potentially happen for, you know, something like bitcoin, you know, in many years, right. It will happen once there's no price discovery to really be done and it's sort of been figured out what this thing is worth.
00:35:06.069 - 00:35:12.317, Speaker A: But we are miles away from that. So yeah, I wouldn't worry about that right now.
00:35:12.341 - 00:35:15.305, Speaker B: Alpia, do you have any price predictions for the cycle?
00:35:15.675 - 00:36:01.319, Speaker A: 68K. You know, Bitcoin, it's looking like we'll break 100. I don't know exactly where it ends up, so I can't really give as good an estimate on bitcoin. I feel like that has a tail where I think on average eth will outperform bitcoin this year. But there's a tail scenario where bitcoin has a very, very blue chip mainstream adoption by, you know, the Qatari government or something that, you know, changes the ballgame and then bitcoin will outperform. So the distribution is quite different. For bitcoin there's a, there's a fat tail you could, you could say on the right side.
00:36:01.319 - 00:36:43.457, Speaker A: And so it's hard to predict. Yeah. So I don't think Ethereum is quite there in terms of, you know, a game changing, you know, new player starting to buy Ethereum. I think the first one that will potentially have like a nation state, not El Salvador, but like, you know, a very, very wealthy one come in is quite high. Especially, you know, some of the Middle Eastern states have been looking at it quite closely already. There could be like a game changer through, you know, like a US financial institution that starts to put bitcoin into, you know, like fixed etf. We've seen hints of that happening in Canada, I think with Fidelity.
00:36:43.457 - 00:37:11.467, Speaker A: Like some of their products have like a 2, 3% crypto allocation. If you get bitcoin into, you know, like a mainstream allocation for like a blackrock size of company, that can be a game changer. That creates a tail, like a fat sort of right tail, which means like there's a probability of an explosive bitcoin reaction. I think eventually ETH might have that as well, but you know, it's in a different stage.
00:37:11.571 - 00:37:18.135, Speaker B: Do you have an expectation on where the bull cycle sort of ends and we get, get into another bear?
00:37:18.435 - 00:38:08.201, Speaker A: You know, another bear is inevitable. As we all know, people will always get overexcited in crypto and you know, already, even though we're early on I said third inning, we're having dog coins and random AI coins that are just completely disconnected from real world valuations. So when I say real world, you know, we're looking at some of the largest, you know, most legitimate companies in the world, like OpenAI, you know, marking at 80 billion, then you have like world coin marking at like 90 billion. These things don't make any sense. So, you know, we're in a bubble in some things already, you could say. So the inevitable bear market, you know, hard to say. Like if new money keeps coming in from the traditional side, it can extend the market quite, quite far.
00:38:08.201 - 00:38:24.073, Speaker A: But like I said at the beginning, we may have quite a divergence between how some things behave. And we've even seen that already this cycle. There's many days where something will be green and then everything else is red. While in the past everything had the same beta.
00:38:24.249 - 00:39:02.843, Speaker B: Which sectors do you think are going to continue growing? Like some of the trends and narratives from the cycle have been like AI and meme coins are really strong and Depin is a wild card that sort of pops off here and then Solana had a strong deepin season. Gaming is, as you brought up earlier on, is also like shaping up some of the survivors from the previous cycle are coming back strong and actually delivering products. What are your expectations from all these narratives that are sort of hot and relevant to the current bull market?
00:39:02.939 - 00:39:39.815, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot of narratives right now. We are trying to keep up with as many as we possibly can. It's impossible to do everything. So as mentioned, gaming, AI, infrastructure, restaking, DeFi, like these are like the main ones that we're very close and on top of, you know, Deepin looks quite interesting. I wouldn't say that we've gone super deep there, but we're starting to take a look at it. We're expanding our investment team so that we can try to cover more ground and you know, ultimately we'll go down as many rabbit holes as we can. I mentioned some of the games we like.
00:39:39.815 - 00:40:34.437, Speaker A: You know, on the AI side, I think it's really early to tell, but what I'm seeing from the market is that it wants to invest in AI coins. It just thinks that there have to be good returns possible. And you know, sometimes you have this like self fulfilling prophecy where a coin might not have a lot of real kind of meat behind it yet, but you know, once it goes to a billion dollars and it can raise, you know, nine figures, suddenly they can hire a world class team and give the market what it wants. Like the market wants it to be billions of dollars and it can sort of form it through the collection of investors. That is only possible in crypto. So we keep a very open mind and I think ultimately if a founder is very good, he'll be able to take the capital that the market is providing. For some of these narratives, it's just saying like, here, take my money.
00:40:34.437 - 00:41:04.025, Speaker A: It's that meme, you know, like the guy's like, so if the founder is actually like, you know, straight, he's like a very legitimate guy that wants to, you know, build a big company and do it properly. There's a lot of opportunity for them. And so, you know, I personally like to back founders above everything else. I've seen founders kind of pivot when the idea was bad and get the job done. So we're taking that approach.
00:41:04.145 - 00:41:07.409, Speaker B: Do you have any final words that you'd like to share with our audience, Jordy?
00:41:07.457 - 00:41:30.451, Speaker A: Yeah, final words. And I believe this strongly. It ties back to your game three question. The best thing to do right now is collaborate. So we're at the cycle point where the best returns are from people that are sharing with each other. There's a huge market and it's growing massively right now. So if you're involved in crypto in any way, you're actually better off.
00:41:30.451 - 00:41:59.397, Speaker A: Instead of trying to, like, you know, capture little opportunities for yourself, you're better off sharing things and creating, you know, tit for tat positive interactions. And so, you know, collaboration is the right strategy right now for the market that we're in and this kind of growing bull market. And hopefully, if we do that together, you know, the space will do a lot better than it did last time with, you know, these, like, SPF type of people that were not, you know, doing things very collaboratively.
00:41:59.541 - 00:42:06.925, Speaker B: Fantastic. I think that's a great moment to end the podcast. Thank you so much for coming on. This was a fantastic conversation.
00:42:07.045 - 00:42:07.845, Speaker A: Thank you. Cheers.
