00:00:00.090 - 00:00:17.006, Speaker A: It's Wednesday, which means it is time for a first look. And today we're looking at one of the hottest L2 scaling projects around. I am, of course, talking about poly. No, no, it's arbitram. It's arbitram. And if you're wondering what arbitrum is, it's an optimistic rollup compared to polygon, which is a plasma sidechain. That's the big difference.
00:00:17.006 - 00:01:05.586, Speaker A: We will be covering what the difference between those two projects is on Friday, between Arbitrum, between Polygon, and optimism, because there are differences between them. But Arbitrum is pretty hot right now, and they have just released arbitrum on Mainnet, which is their arbitrum one mainnet beta. Why is it called Arbitrum one? Well, that's the name of the chain. Arbitrum is the company that makes it, that supports it, and offchain Labs is the company that has built arbitram. Bit complicated, but there you go. There was also a really interesting poll run by Robert Leshner of compound to see whether people wanted to see uniswap deployed on arbitram. And you might know that Uniswap hasn't been deployed on polygon, whereas a lot of other DeFi protocols have.
00:01:05.586 - 00:01:32.114, Speaker A: Other, for instance. So I think people are kind of curious why uniswap might be deployed on arbitram and not on polygon. What the differences are. We'll cover that on Friday. But that poll was, well, it was 100% in favor and 0% against. Now, there might be reasons why that was, but I think now we should just get straight into it and have a look. But we're not going to do that, because first we're going to get a message from our sponsors.
00:01:32.114 - 00:02:03.122, Speaker A: So we start with balancer. And in version two, we are now seeing the protocol become the one stop shop for DFI liquidity with stable pools and weighted pools tightly integrated under a single protocol. With flash loans, lending via asset managers, and much more. Check it out at balancer Finance, Salana has built a fast, censorship resistant blockchain where you can build and use crypto apps that scale. Today, the network supports thousands of transactions per second with fees less than a cent and over 500 validators. To learn more, head over to Salana.com, defiant to get started building and join its rapidly expanding community.
00:02:03.122 - 00:02:44.822, Speaker A: Now, back to first look. So if we jump into arbitrum, basically what it is, it's a L2 scaling solution, which allows some of the computation that would normally happen on Ethereum, which is the layer one, to be done elsewhere. And there are lots of different ways that you can do this. We have covered them previously, and we're going to cover them again at the end of the week. But the difference here is that arbitram is a roll up, which means it takes a bunch of things that happen and it rolls them up into one transaction that then adds back to the Ethereum main chain, whereas on Polygon it's a side chain, so it just does all the transactions there instead of on Ethereum. And interestingly with arbitrum, and I think it's also the same with optimism as well. There's no token.
00:02:44.822 - 00:03:18.262, Speaker A: So that was one of the things that I was interested to check out on arbitrum, the fee structure. So I found this information about the fees. It says, while arbitrum reduces fees by more than 50 x for most workloads that we've seen, arbitram is not free. The majority of the fees collected on arbitram are used to pay for posting call data on ethereum. So they end up going to Ethereum miners, and there are also costs to operate the chain and the supporting infrastructure. ETH is the native asset on arbitrum, and fees will be paid in ETH on there, too. So there's more information on the fees.
00:03:18.262 - 00:04:03.546, Speaker A: And you run into this thing called arb gas, which is the gas that's used by arbitrum to track the cost of execution on an arbitrum chain. And it's similar in concept to Ethereum gas, but there's a lot more of it and it's a lot cheaper. So we'll see that in a bit when we go and look at their block explorer to see how that all plays out, because there's some information there that you can find. The other thing that's interesting about arbitrum is the sequencer. I haven't fully wrapped my head around how that works exactly, but they weren't going to launch it for the main net beta, but they did, which knocked them back a couple of weeks, but now they have. So that sequencer is now in this mainnet beta. So I'm very curious to see what's being built and what's on there.
00:04:03.546 - 00:04:50.594, Speaker A: If we look at the arbitrum page here, arbitrum IO we can go to, let's go to the block explorer first, and you can see the blocks that are now being produced on this mainet beta. And so if we go in here, we can inspect the transaction, go a little deeper in. So you start to see these different rows in the transaction data. So you see the layer one gas used, and what it says here is the dominating cost of using a L2 solution is the gas needed to include a user's transaction into the layer one. So remember, they roll up a bunch of transactions into one transaction, then commit that to the chain. So you're getting the security and the decentralization of the Ethereum main chain. But there's so much more data being wrapped into one transaction, which should make it faster.
00:04:50.594 - 00:05:20.930, Speaker A: Then if we go down lower, we see the L2 gas used. So arb gas is used to measure validator resource usage for l two fees. It's far cheaper and much more abundant than L1 gas. So you want to be using arb gas as much as possible. There is quite an extensive documentation site here with all the resources that you need to understand arb gas. This, I'm afraid, is beyond my pay grade. I would have to spend a long time figuring all of this out.
00:05:20.930 - 00:06:01.342, Speaker A: But we will be using arbgas on Arbitrum. So now let's go back and have a look at some of the live dapps that are running already. So on here, we have a version of Bancorp, we have a version of McDex, and we have an amm, which is, I guess what it looks like is a fork of uniswap, and I believe they call it arboswap. So let's go and try it out and see how we get going. So this is Arbiswap, a L2 implementation of the Uniswap exchange on arbitrum. And this is built by offchain themselves. And there's quite an extensive set of instructions here.
00:06:01.342 - 00:06:44.334, Speaker A: We can connect via metamask to the arbitram coven instance. And then we should be able to send tokens over a bridge and start using arbiswap. So let's go ahead and do it. So I think basically what we need to do now is connect our wallet. Yep. And then we need to send some tokens over the bridge, which I think you can connect to here. So if I now click on the arbitram bridge, it's bridge arbitrum IO and connect my wallet, it'll say, stop.
00:06:44.334 - 00:07:24.742, Speaker A: You're attempting to use mainet beta with an unapproved address. So what I need to do now is connect to the coven testnet. So that's representing the Ethereum side, and then it will plug in properly. So now I have covent test, and I actually have some coven ETH from another tutorial that I did. And then if we want to send tokens over the bridge. I believe we can set up metamask to read the arbitram network if we click on this button here. So add, switch to arbitrum network, and then it will just pre fill all the RPC details in here so that we can connect to arbitram.
00:07:24.742 - 00:07:57.320, Speaker A: I did try and do it manually, and it didn't work for some reason, but this should be okay. So now if I switch to that network, that side will be grayed out. This side will be the side that I can connect to, but I actually want to be connected to the ETH side. So I'm going to switch back to the coven side to deposit some coven ETH. So I'm just going to deposit one ETH on this side. There we go. It's working now.
00:07:57.320 - 00:08:30.462, Speaker A: There we go. A little bit too hasty there. So now I just need to wait for this to confirm. Okay, we are back, and it looks like we have successfully deposited one ETH and zero ETH. Whoops. I made a mistake there. So now what I need to do is I need to switch back to the arbitram testnet here, and then I will be in business.
00:08:30.462 - 00:09:05.216, Speaker A: So now when I go to arbiswap, it should tell me that I have. So I'm not going to bore you with what happened next. There was a lot of flapping around of me trying to input data that simply didn't work. Manually inputting the RPC just returned an error. So I couldn't connect to Arbisop, and I couldn't also connect to Bancorp when I tried that. But finally I was able to try McDex, and we got somewhere. Okay, so McDex is just about coming through.
00:09:05.216 - 00:09:36.056, Speaker A: It's running very slowly. Okay, so now see if I can connect my wallet. So this is saying it's arbitram testnet v five, which I should be on. So if I connect my wallet, it should connect, and it looks like that has indeed worked. Okay, well, there we go. I'm in. So now presumably I can trade on McDex on L2.
00:09:36.056 - 00:10:04.050, Speaker A: Let's see if we can make a trade, shall we? Go long, something like that. That all looks like it's working perfectly. Well, a fee associated with this request. So that's going to cost me one dollars 62 to spend my USDC on L2. That's interesting. So now I can long ETH. How much is that going to cost me? Not that much.
00:10:04.050 - 00:10:48.124, Speaker A: And that's it done. So that was a relatively speedy experience on McDex, but it did take me a little bit of time to get this thing sorted out. So it appears that the McDEX is reading arbitram testnet version five, but Bancorp and Arbiswap seem to be having problems with that. It's most likely me, but. Well, that's Arbitrum, so. Yeah, early, early days, and it's really unfair to judge this thing by the user experience at this stage. But I think it's really interesting to see how this narrative is going to take over the summer of DFI summer version two, which could be the summer of these new L2s when they come in.
00:10:48.124 - 00:11:00.480, Speaker A: Certainly, we should be looking out for optimism. We should be looking out for arbitrary, and we'll cover more about these L2s in our big Friday film. But for now, that was, first look, little frustrating. But, hey, that's how it goes sometimes. I'll see you on the next one. Bye.
