00:00:00.650 - 00:00:12.106, Speaker A: This week on the Defiant. Well, you already know what the video's about, so let me try and summarize. It's up, it's down. It's the greatest, it's the worst community. Yeah. VC. Meh.
00:00:12.106 - 00:00:19.534, Speaker A: It's a scam. Not a scam. Might be a scam. Was it a scam? Time for Sam Bankman. Free, great hair, fair launch. What's for lunch? Spork it. Don't fork it.
00:00:19.534 - 00:00:24.414, Speaker A: Fetch the pitchforks. To me. To, you know, me. Yes, chef. Topper chef, mosque death. Take some stick. Top pick.
00:00:24.414 - 00:00:49.910, Speaker A: I need unique, unique unicorns. Uniswap top flop. Chop it to the. Drop it like it's hot. Knives out. Let's see. Bro, do you even sushi? Does that about COVID it? Truth be told, any hope I had of producing something vaguely resembling a sane video this week was completely kiboshed by yet more food themed folly in the shape of sushi swap.
00:00:49.910 - 00:01:05.394, Speaker A: The better than uniswap exit scam. That wasn't. But still might be. But here comes serum. Yay, that one. If you've seen our recent videos, you'll know that food tends to feature heavily, often heading towards my face at speed. Well, we are not going to do that.
00:01:05.394 - 00:01:14.740, Speaker A: This. Dude. What was that? Did you hear that? Yeah. What was that? Now I'm being serious. I'm being serious. There's actually some. There's someone here.
00:01:14.740 - 00:01:57.518, Speaker A: I'm serious. There's something out there. Just go grab the camera. Go, go. Did you see that was it. I'm going to be honest here. I didn't want to do this story.
00:01:57.518 - 00:02:40.490, Speaker A: It takes a lot of work to make these films, and I didn't want to validate an apparent exit scam by pouring a ton of creative energy into making a fun film. And, you know, it's been covered heavily in all media. So what could I possibly add? A few jokes, some slapstick, a fish to the face? Goddamn right. You see, there is a story here, and it's not about chef Nomi or FTX. This is a story about greed, entitlement, and the destructive power of narrative. And in many ways, it's a story that gets deep into the heart of the battle for the soul of decentralized finance. And it all starts with a young thermodynamics engineer who had a radical idea for a decentralized exchange protocol.
00:02:40.490 - 00:02:46.754, Speaker A: That young developer was Hayden Adams. And the project was know it's good.
00:02:46.792 - 00:03:40.346, Speaker B: To bring in some of the history here because actually the very first automated market maker was banker. Before AMM exchanges needed to have an order book, and with an order book, you need to match buyers and sellers of tokens. And when there's an illiquid market and not so many buyers and sellers, it's hard to get these trades to happen. And spreads are very wide and it's just not very conductive for this burgeoning token economy. So this was kind of the great breakthrough of amm. And then what UniSop did to take it forward was, ironically, now that we're talking about sushi, remove the token. Like banker had its own native token.
00:03:40.346 - 00:04:22.366, Speaker B: Uniswap said, we don't need to add complexity to this, let's just remove it. Use ETH as exchange token. And it also included this very kind of simple and elegant pricing curve, which simplified token flops. And this all came from a research piece that Vitalik did and Hayden Adams picked up to build uniswap. And so when it came out, it really was a breakthrough for Defi. This clean interface with just like two things to do. The unicorn logo is just like, amazing.
00:04:22.366 - 00:04:27.118, Speaker B: And it was a basic building block for Defi going forward.
00:04:27.204 - 00:05:05.530, Speaker A: Without doubt, this year will be remembered as the moment Defi took flight. But there are three key catalysts to wrap your head around. Firstly, the launch of the comp token. This was the gasoline that ignited the yield farming craze with governance, tokens suddenly thrust into the spotlight. Secondly, Andre Cronier releases the Wifi token in the absolute model of a fair launch. And with it, the birth of a community rules everything narrative that won't be going anywhere soon. And finally, uniswap announces an $11 million series A round led by Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, and Parafi Capital.
00:05:05.610 - 00:05:07.294, Speaker C: This sort of started as a side project.
00:05:07.412 - 00:06:06.682, Speaker A: These three things created the perfect conditions for sushi swap to not only be born, but to suck the very lifeblood from the project from which it was cloned. Viewed from any angle before May 2020, uniswap is one of the most valuable and useful protocols in Ethereum. And it's unlikely DFI would have grown to where it is today without it. But there's a problem. Compound. What am I supposed to do with this? Make the rest. Where's the good stuff? This is what you get, Joker.
00:06:06.746 - 00:06:07.920, Speaker C: I'll show you.
00:06:11.490 - 00:06:48.810, Speaker A: Yeah. Enter chef Nomi. Yeah, this guy. Cartoon Pando chef Nami from Hearthstone. You can totally trust an anonymous developer who looks like that. Everybody knows that. So August 26, Sushi swap is announced as an evolution of Uniswap, owned and governed by its token holders with trading fees plus sushi tokens being distributed to liquidity providers.
00:06:48.810 - 00:06:59.330, Speaker A: The narrative crystallized around the idea that uniswap was backed by greedy Silicon Valley VCs, while Sushiswap was the people's Dax.
00:07:00.390 - 00:07:43.134, Speaker C: The ambition of Sushiswap and what made me join the project was to create a community led project where everyone could have a say in the direction of the project. No matter the amount of funds you own, who you are, experience level, background, a project where you could be rewarded by participating and contributing no matter what are your skills or ambitions. I got involved when I read the medium post and was one of the first nine person in discord. I think I started to engage with chef Nomi and Sushiswap, which is the Sugan dev, to dig into what they were trying to accomplish here. I was fascinated by the vision and their point of view. Decided to implicate myself from the get go. I was promoted to general manager of the restaurant and almost immediately I started to grow it, make connection with Defi project to partner.
00:07:43.262 - 00:08:22.858, Speaker B: The fact that this new project had this anonymous founder added to kind of the mystique around Sushislab and it just went very well with the narrative that had been growing to this point of just like very community led, community owned projects. No special treatment for the team or for early investors, no VCs. All of this narrative had been picking up steam. Adding an anonymous founder on top of all that. Just like added to it, fan the flames.
00:08:23.034 - 00:08:46.950, Speaker C: I was actually blown away. Like I never expected to reach a few millions of TVL so quickly. The first billion was something crazy because we were still unaudited anonymous with no reputation. I did reveal my identity to some people so we could have some audits done and engage in more thoughtful conversation, but I never expected something like this.
00:08:47.100 - 00:09:47.778, Speaker A: But there was a much, much darker side to this story. Okay, so you might have heard of money Legos or the composability of defi components. Well, this is what made it possible for sushi swap to literally drain an increasingly significant amount of liquidity from uniswap. Now it works like this. Liquidity providers on uniswap receive a token which represents their deposits in the dex, and these tokens can be moved around and traded just like any other token. And the way for initial participants in Sushiswap to earn sushi was to deposit Uniswap's LP tokens. These uniswap LP tokens would then be swapped for the underlying asset so that Uniswap liquidity would become sushiswap liquidity, and it's a play known as zombie mining, making Sushiswap a bona fide vampire protocol.
00:09:47.778 - 00:10:45.622, Speaker A: Now, this wouldn't work unless LPs were prepared to play the game and make the switch. So let's think about it. Anonymous developer, blatant ripoff, sketchy mechanics, and of course, nobody was interested. What a sushi swap was not only able to capture most of Uniswap's LP tokens, it also catapulted the $285,000,000 in uniswap to $1.5 billion in just nine days, as traders eager to get their hands on LP tokens to deposit in sushi swap flowed into the platform. By September the fourth, there was $1.8 billion in Uniswap, but $1.6
00:10:45.622 - 00:11:40.298, Speaker A: billion of its liquidity tokens were actually on sushi swap. The good chef was starting to exhibit some strange behavior. Just check out these gems. Nomi was even going after Hayden Adams on Twitter. You got grant. You paid yourself NYC salary. You have everything.
00:11:40.298 - 00:12:04.002, Speaker A: So what do you complain? I don't want to send any talk, and I've ever got myself. I distribute everything. Is that fund for development? Actually, I feel very offended. You say I'm an opportunist. The funds for development referenced here are the 10% of sushi tokens minted that are allocated to developers building the protocol, which at that moment was just himself. I don't sell any tokens. I'm a good guy.
00:12:04.002 - 00:12:33.270, Speaker A: On Chef Nomi's Twitter page, he says, smart contracts are like sushi. Testful equals tasteful. Yeah. Equals testicles. And another word for testicles where I come from is bollocks. Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks, bollocks, mate. By September the fifth, the dev fund, which was solely controlled by him, was holding about $13 million worth of sushi, and he traded it all for ETH on uniswap, no less.
00:12:33.270 - 00:13:16.700, Speaker A: Now, traders quickly realized the move, and sushi price tanked by more than 70% in one day to $1.20 after the word got out. And the reaction everywhere was pretty much as you'd expect. Even so, Nomi, clearly still pumped to the gills with ego juice, couldn't resist firing back hundreds of scam projects in one week. That's an accomplishment, really.
00:13:20.930 - 00:13:50.358, Speaker C: Stupid. Betrayed, devastated, lost. I felt all of that. Why would someone that understood what we were fighting give up and do something so dishonest? From what I understood, he wasn't poor nor in need of the money. What happened is that I feel he somehow lost it. He was informed of the bug they found when migrating. Didn't want to fix it.
00:13:50.358 - 00:14:11.530, Speaker C: Saw the honeypot, which is life saving amount of money. It was pressured by a lot of strong voice in the community telling him he was a scammer, opportunistic, and just told himself, fuck these people. I deserve that money for what I built. Is it the right thing to do? No. Did it happen? Yes.
00:14:11.680 - 00:14:44.626, Speaker A: In a dizzying turn of events, chef Nomi rapidly handed over the keys to sushi swap to Sam Bankman fried of animator research and FTX, who become a heavy player in the protocol. And this precipitated a rapid move to migrate the protocol to a multisig contract, with Sam himself offering 1 million sushi as incentives to existing LPs to continue participating. And once again, as I say, this stuff, it sounds like utter gobbledygood, but we have to remember there are millions and millions of dollars at stake here. This stuff is serious.
00:14:44.818 - 00:15:32.806, Speaker B: That was so crazy. Sam didn't really come out of nowhere. Like, he had been farming sushi since the project started through Alameda research. Together, they mined up at least, like, around 10% of all sushi in existence. At the same time, Sam launched serum on Solana, and he proposed for sushi to also build on Solana and to share kind of the serum's order book. So I think he had seen in sushi an opportunity to bring in some of the activity and liquidity of Ethereum's defi into Solana's defi, which he was pioneering with serum. And so it wouldn't be good for his business for him to be there on his own.
00:15:32.806 - 00:15:58.670, Speaker B: And so that's why he was trying to bring sushi over. When chef Nomi sold his sushi, it was like, the perfect opportunity to take over. So the project is somewhat centralized around him, and maybe it's something you can criticize, but he really helped breathe new life into sushiswap. Sushi is now holding the most value locked in any decentralized exchange, which is crazy.
00:15:58.820 - 00:16:18.650, Speaker C: Two weeks after launch, SBF will have no implication moving forward. He was asked to help us do the migration, the multi SiG transition. His role in the project is over. He is welcome to make proposal, vote, engage with the community, but as far as I'm concerned, he won't be there for the day to day of sushiswap.
00:16:18.750 - 00:16:59.790, Speaker A: So they did it. They pulled off a vampire high, successfully migrating liquidity from the unicorns to the fish market. There was about $810,000,000 of tokens in sushi swap, or 55% of Uniswap's total liquidity. And by the end of the process, value in sushi swap had increased to around $860,000,000. And I've just seen a tweet from Camilla that puts it north of a billion dollars. And the TVL, or total value, locked in Uniswap, has more than halved since yesterday to $430,000,000. Yes, this looks bad, but on balance, it's a net game, with the protocol up by 50% from $285,000,000 before sushi launched.
00:16:59.870 - 00:17:20.138, Speaker C: The whole space is reaping rewards of this experiment, in my opinion, and we're just getting started. A lot of people were attracted by the yield and were introduced to being an LP for the first time. So all in all, I think it was pretty great. And we aren't ourselves protected against such an attack, which is motivating, because we will have to come up with solution for that.
00:17:20.224 - 00:18:46.370, Speaker A: The identity of chef Nomi is still unknown. And maybe he's out there planning his next move, sharpening his forks. But still, I have to ask the question why? After all the scams we've seen over the years, and it's not still clear whether this even was a scam, but why do people continue to be duped by this kind of behavior? $30 million ain't a bad payday for ten days work, is it? But maybe the answer is right there in front of us. Where it's always been close. Know that you've been scammed before. But red flags we ignore this time it's different this time it's right just grab yourself some sushi the future's brown is different. This time it's true you can call me Master savior.
00:18:46.370 - 00:19:09.958, Speaker A: My Dex is packed with flavor. Yes, it is. It's so tasty sitting around the campfire just me then a vampire preparing every detail. 30 million. Thank you. Retail. I'm the dumping.
00:19:09.958 - 00:19:30.420, Speaker A: I'm a good guy. This time is different. This time is right. You can trust me. It's not a scam. Just ask Sam. Go ahead and ask him now.
00:19:30.420 - 00:20:13.626, Speaker A: This time is different, this time it's true, I swear. I'm not jumping. I'm not jumping on you. You can believe me. I'm the real master chef. Close. Now look, this wouldn't work unless liquidity providers prepared liquidity, provided it takes a lot of work to make these films.
00:20:13.626 - 00:20:14.810, Speaker A: And there's a beer can on the table.
