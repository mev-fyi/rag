00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:03.170 - 00:00:49.370, Speaker B: Oh, shit. We're going live soon, bucket. You can play, I think. Yeah, the music is good actually. All right. Yeah, go for it's. Welcome to the NFT show.
00:00:49.370 - 00:01:19.958, Speaker B: We have here with us Simon One, we have Victor Meldru who's just bringing so much graphical fatness down in the corner of the screen. As you can see, I am both myself and a metahuman. So you can see as I move my head around how much my Mohawk just reacts. So this is happening in real time. We have the most complicated setup we've ever had for a live stream. But in the background you can see an artifact jacket, in the background you can see a me bit. But most importantly, we have two extremely important people.
00:01:19.958 - 00:01:35.498, Speaker B: We have Simon Wan, actor, writer and most importantly, musician. First sneak preview, algasimov. We found some stuff. Oh, my God, we found some stuff.
00:01:35.664 - 00:01:36.090, Speaker C: Wow.
00:01:36.160 - 00:01:40.220, Speaker B: Yes. My computer crashed because we can't actually handle it.
00:01:41.250 - 00:01:46.910, Speaker D: I cannot get rid of that page, I can't delete it.
00:01:47.060 - 00:02:07.042, Speaker B: And of course, we have with us the very handsome vector Meldru once again bringing us just the most incredible version of himself. Vector is going to be joining us more regularly and I'm very excited to have you here. So we are talking about music today. Let's start with you, Swannie. Music. Tell us about it.
00:02:07.096 - 00:02:20.506, Speaker D: It's my life. So it started off in the 19th century with the Spanish. No, for me, I got a caveat. This page, I cannot get rid of this page. I did it long, long time ago. Oh, look, go down.
00:02:20.688 - 00:02:23.338, Speaker C: You love this page. I think you secretly love this page.
00:02:23.424 - 00:02:39.402, Speaker D: Click, lick and flick. That was the logo, free YouTube, luckily. So it's cool on there. I started off as a rave MC. That was where I started in the 90s. So I was mcging along with like slip.
00:02:39.466 - 00:02:41.360, Speaker B: Wow, look at this one guy.
00:02:43.490 - 00:02:44.974, Speaker C: What was your MC name?
00:02:45.092 - 00:02:47.466, Speaker D: Mc yellow boy. Because I'm half yellow.
00:02:47.498 - 00:02:48.960, Speaker C: Isn't it amazing?
00:02:49.510 - 00:03:16.634, Speaker D: Yeah. So MC yellow boy, I was with grief and strife, resonator, slip mat. I'd done groove rider, all the big boys in places like pleasure dome, Helter skelter, and that was it. I was a rave MC for life. And then part of my thing was I wanted to make tunes. Are you going to play along with me? I'll just do a different voice, Robin. Part of me was I wanted to make tunes and we got signed to a label to do a dance track which went bigger the better.
00:03:16.634 - 00:03:36.446, Speaker D: The newest show. Go check with the flex system. Bigger. It was quite good. It was the time of I'm alive. The man with the second face and you're ready to deal with that. But sadly, dad chords now Robin died of a heroin overdose and vodka.
00:03:36.446 - 00:04:00.054, Speaker D: So that all went. So I decided to leave that and go to uni to learn how to be a filmmaker, where I did two years there. One best production. And as I left Uni, I was signed to a management company. We were in a development deal with Warner Bros. For like fucking ages. And we sort of went from a five piece to a four piece to a three piece.
00:04:00.054 - 00:04:32.500, Speaker D: And it was just two of us where we did switch 22, went through loads of management companies and just did the whole circuit. Did the pink pound circuit, played everywhere, and eventually got fucking. So sick and tired of it, the other guy left and I was kind of, sort of left on my land. I tried it on my own for a little bit and then I just got back into production. So it's always been part of me. But no, six, seven years invested in five and one is hot into that. But the truth of it was our tunes weren't good enough.
00:04:32.500 - 00:04:59.322, Speaker D: We were great live. We brought the noise when it came to the stage stuff, but the tunes weren't really good enough. So it kind of broke my heart a little bit. And then years later, Robin and I, I was asked to do a verse for an upcoming singer called Reason, which Robin shot the video for, and it got to number one in the dance charts. It took me 15 minutes to write. And then I did it off the back of that. I did another song, just put it out there.
00:04:59.322 - 00:05:11.200, Speaker D: You write these spec songs and some japanese band got it. And yeah, I get like a residual PRS check every year of about twelve pounds. So I fucking made it.
00:05:12.770 - 00:05:16.050, Speaker C: Wow, that's a lot of money. Twelve pounds is a lot of money.
00:05:16.200 - 00:05:20.850, Speaker D: It is, man. Like, we're getting at least 100 streams a week. It's mental.
00:05:22.550 - 00:05:37.586, Speaker B: So we also have vector. On vector. You have a history of being someone that plays music, other people's music, while doing other stuff. Tell us a little bit about your musical background because you're definitely no stranger to the scene.
00:05:37.778 - 00:05:52.618, Speaker C: No, of course. And I probably was one of those teenagers that grew up listening to your tape packs, to be honest. All that kind of the happy hardcore era that merged into jungle. That's what I grew up on. One nation, tape packs, dreamscape, all that kind of stuff.
00:05:52.704 - 00:05:53.194, Speaker B: Yes.
00:05:53.312 - 00:06:41.894, Speaker C: So, yeah, I'm definitely a product of that era. I was too young to go to the raves, but I just loved the flyers and that's kind of what got me into digital art. Really just loving the record label designs, sleeves, getting into doing that, the flyers and. Yeah, just basically got me into the grime scene. I started a grime website, did a lot of artwork for the Grime days sub boogu. Well, hey, yeah, and then the dubstep days, and then I just basically merged all of those things, all those passions and animation and VJing and everything, and lately just gone balls deep in NFTs because it feels like similar to those days in a lot of ways. Like the kind of pirate grassroots mentality that in some ways it's quite intuitive.
00:06:41.894 - 00:06:55.854, Speaker C: If you grew up in that era and you know about that kind of culture of pirate radio, raves, underground culture, it's kind of like bootstrapping, do it yourself. I feel like that's what this is now. This is a pirate radio station. In some ways it is.
00:06:55.892 - 00:07:17.800, Speaker B: And actually, with a pirate radio station, you're always like one step away from being arrested, but you do it with just like, no money and just a bit of spit and sawdust. What's weird about this space right now is that you can do all of that and make a shit ton of money at the same time. And I think that's why everyone's gone. I must have some of that. I must have some of that right now.
00:07:18.570 - 00:07:38.686, Speaker C: Yeah, it's attracting the opportunists. That's why I love the name that X copy run with the grifters. I think the grifters is a good description for some of the people that it attracts. Sometimes. Probably even us. Probably even we're grifters actually, in some way, shape or form. But yeah, it's a bit like the wild west, as a lot of people say.
00:07:38.868 - 00:08:03.560, Speaker B: So, Swannie, listen, you were pretty good. You're a singer, you could dance, you were pretty good looking. It just didn't fucking work out. And I can never quite pinpoint why. Because you and I have worked together and I knew you had so much talent. You found, at last, a group of people that recognized what I recognized in you in acting now. But do you miss music?
00:08:04.010 - 00:08:30.478, Speaker D: I do. I mean, it took me a long time because don't forget, I started McNe at 16. So that whole point of wanting to be a musician, then going to university, then putting six years into different companies, different labels, and that was 1520 years almost. So, yeah, when we decided to basically sort of quit and the other guy left and it was like, okay, this is it now. It broke my heart. I couldn't listen to a good tune for about. If I heard a good tune on the radio in a car.
00:08:30.478 - 00:09:09.578, Speaker D: I had to turn it off for, like, I'm going to say, at least a couple of years, because I knew deep down that the reason that we didn't make it to the level of where we wanted to go was that our tunes weren't good enough. And it was the songwriting talent as well as the opportunities we had. And at the time when we was in the boy band, it was like our competition was just in Timberlake, NSYNC, people like that. So they had. Who were they called? Star. Not star makers or something. There was a norwegian superhouse that were just making every tune, like, sort of before BT and Timberlake, they just produced everything.
00:09:09.578 - 00:09:49.490, Speaker D: And we were kind of trying to do it ourselves and we were kind of in the forefront of this, like try and keep it electro, kind of keep that rave vibe. And I don't know. I think we were not saying that we were ahead of our time, but I definitely think we were a little bit. We were about five years before because we were kind of doing that 80s retro thing mixed with rave stabs, but with poppy lyrics. And at the time, it was a lot of boy band stuff, which was like the ballad and all that, and we weren't really there. And, yeah, no, it kind of hurt a lot to have to say, look, okay, this is not going to happen. But then you sort of realize, you got to say to yourself, what is it that you want from music? Is it fame and money? Because at the time I wanted to be famous.
00:09:49.490 - 00:10:21.202, Speaker D: I want to be a famous pop star. But as you get older and as the projects come along, you realize that what you really needed to do is make an amazing song and then that will carry on to success. And the further we got, we weren't famous, but we were getting treated well. I didn't have to buy a drink, didn't have to queue up for a club for years. So when that all stopped and I was kind of having to stand outside, I was like, oh, fuck, what's going on now? I don't like this. So it was fun. I mean, the whole journey was fun.
00:10:21.202 - 00:10:43.450, Speaker D: Being on stage was fun. But I used to have to drink so much. I was drinking from sound check till performance. So sometimes that could have been like 10 hours. So I'd be pissed out. Me, Ed, just to think, oh, God, I'm doing this because I have to do it because of the next thing I have to do. And it wasn't necessarily my heart wasn't in what we were doing then.
00:10:43.450 - 00:11:09.262, Speaker D: And it's interesting to say about how I found myself in acting. I don't need to get pissed to act. I love it. I'm sobriety when it comes to that sort of thing. The buzz is still there, the excitement, but it's something I think I'm better at. And a long answer to your question is that I think probably we just weren't good enough to break it. And at the time, now there were no shortcuts.
00:11:09.262 - 00:11:30.380, Speaker D: You were either with a major label or you weren't. You know what I mean? There wasn't Spotify. YouTube wasn't really around that much. I mean, we had a MySpace page that we were getting traffic on. But I think the opportunities for artists now, there's so much bigger. But you are in a bigger pool of talent, which I think isn't necessarily a good thing.
00:11:31.550 - 00:11:53.790, Speaker B: Yeah. And it feels like there's this instant success button that everyone wants to have added to their phone or their keyboard, which is like, I'm going to go from naught to famous in two weeks. And there are so many examples of people that have done this, particularly on TikTok and social media, like TikTok famous in two weeks or in a month. That's normal. Yeah.
00:11:53.860 - 00:12:09.702, Speaker D: Look at Bella Porch. Addison Rae. Bella Porch. I mean, she got famous from doing that kind of, that face cover was obviously, she was very talented. She's got quite a rich story. She was not an immigrant, but she left her home country, she joined the army. She does this TikTok thing.
00:12:09.702 - 00:12:35.870, Speaker D: She's obviously covered in tattoos. So she's kind of esoteric. But because she had so many views, record companies just go, right. Well, what can you do? Just chuck a song at them. Addison Ray has got an immediate advertising platform, Dixie D'Amelio, as well. So you think the three biggest artists on TikTok and streaming right now, Bella Porch, Dixie D'Amelio, Addison Rae, all came from TikTok. But let's not forget they had something in them.
00:12:35.870 - 00:13:00.594, Speaker D: Like you say about the instant fame button, they were very, very talented. Know, they were extremely talented. Because you watch these TikTok things, that's fucking easy. Try and copy it. You realize very quickly, it's actually quite hard. So it's sad because someone said to me talking to their kid the other day, and it was like, what do you want to be? I want to be a TikToker. And they sent me a screen grab that they were looking at on YouTube, how to be TikTok famous.
00:13:00.594 - 00:13:32.590, Speaker D: And it's like, it sort of hurts me a little bit. Because the route to famous success is to be really fucking good at something and to be better than everyone else at the time. And maybe Bella Porch, Addison Rae, Dixie D'Amelio. You might think that they're not better than everyone else, but in reality they actually are because they can lay down some tracks and when you see their videos, they've got something very special. So it's tough that instant fame button. Instant success button. Let's not forget that TikTok and socials is driven also by record labels.
00:13:32.590 - 00:13:50.120, Speaker D: They can buy huge amounts of followers, they can buy huge amounts of plays. And if you've got a choice between listening to one song which has got three views or one song that's got 250,000,000, your brain is just gonna. You're gonna go for the big one. And that's unfortunately how it is.
00:13:50.970 - 00:14:16.926, Speaker B: Yeah, it's deep. You and I have tried and failed a few times and actually we've tried and succeeded a little bit. That is the worst. You go, hey, we did it. Then you look at it, you go, but this is shit. We can't have sort of made it, but we haven't. And now we hate ourselves and now we're having to kind of pretend like we have made it and we're sort of in between, but we're not really a thing.
00:14:16.926 - 00:14:29.854, Speaker B: And we could be a thing. And at the same time you're having to just compromise everywhere, left, right and center and then, hi. Really happy to see you. I'm so much happier. I don't have to give a shit about any of that stuff anymore.
00:14:29.902 - 00:14:55.802, Speaker D: Well, the strangest thing was, obviously I spent 1520 years trying to get a song on Radio One and a project that Robin and I did called Stenders, which was. Which was sort of the brainchild of a drunken taxi ride back from somewhere. I was getting my hair cut and then Robin and our song just came on the radio. Fern cotton. It was like, do you remember?
00:14:55.936 - 00:15:29.954, Speaker B: That was the most stupid thing that ever happened to us. Let's get played on Radio one. And then a week later we were. And it was the weirdest thing because we'd done a shitty cover of Ed Sheeran talking about the plot of a famous soap opera in the UK called EastEnders. So we used to do this thing where you do a rap of the plot of EastEnders every week and then we turned it into a YouTube video, but we do a parody of a famous music video, but we turn it around in 8 hours and that'd be it. And then this was what 2011 2011.
00:15:30.002 - 00:15:30.706, Speaker D: Maybe even earlier.
00:15:30.738 - 00:15:44.714, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe even earlier. Jesus. This is not early YouTube, but it's reasonably early YouTube. And we blew up. We were getting like 35 40,000 views on videos. It was ridiculous. We did it for 15 weeks.
00:15:44.714 - 00:15:45.978, Speaker B: That was it.
00:15:46.144 - 00:15:46.860, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:15:48.590 - 00:15:57.230, Speaker B: We did one video a week for 15 weeks and we blew up and we were getting played on Radio one. We had to do like a Katy Perry special for Radio One. I mean, it was ridiculous.
00:15:57.570 - 00:16:04.400, Speaker D: And wanking Arthur and then said that we were going to be the biggest thing since sliced bread and fuck all.
00:16:05.650 - 00:16:08.882, Speaker C: What is the name of this song? So people can look it up and I can look it up?
00:16:08.936 - 00:16:24.390, Speaker D: You can't look it up. It's been restricted on. There's a few things you can find on like, vimeo and stuff, but our main YouTube channel, which was super massive favor, I guess it's been restricted for some reason. You can't watch it anywhere in the world. We had so much content on there. Videos. Videos.
00:16:24.390 - 00:16:29.510, Speaker D: Just fun stuff. And I can't remember the logins. And nor can Robin.
00:16:30.170 - 00:16:33.962, Speaker B: They're on Vimeo. All the standards videos are on Vimeo. But it was us.
00:16:34.016 - 00:16:35.018, Speaker D: Not all of them, though.
00:16:35.104 - 00:16:56.862, Speaker B: Yeah. But I think the funny thing is, back then, we were trying so hard to do everything. Well, I was. I was trying so hard to do everything perfectly because I wanted to demonstrate something, improve something. Since starting to do this, I don't give a crap about that anymore. What's more important is just doing it every day, making it a daily habit. This unreal engine journey that we're on, it's kicking our asses so badly.
00:16:56.862 - 00:17:22.054, Speaker B: There's so much shit that we don't know. But what I love about it, and I think you'll appreciate this vector as well, is like, there is no quick fix for doing stuff like this. I can't just go and get a WordPress theme and just add it in. I can't just go and buy a plugin and it just works. Everything that we've had to build to make this set, that's not true. We just bought an asset pack, didn't we?
00:17:22.252 - 00:17:23.320, Speaker C: Oh, no.
00:17:24.510 - 00:17:43.870, Speaker B: But even with an asset pack, we're still just getting our asses kicked trying to get enough render setting, enough performance for me, able to even vaguely puppet this character. So we had to reduce all the render settings. But you do VJing and stuff. You must have come across this battle the whole time. Stuff just sometimes it just doesn't want to work.
00:17:44.020 - 00:18:15.526, Speaker C: No. Well, I think that's the interesting thing about what you touched on here. Because there isn't like a guide. You can't google how to get big in whatever it is we're doing here. And I think you have to choose something that you enjoy doing because otherwise it's just going to be painful. So I think that whole idea of like, oh, I just want to prove something kind of goes out the window. The priority needs to be like, am I having fun doing this? Does it feel good? Because you probably in for the long haul and it's going to be painful and there's no one that can really tell you how to do it, so you got to figure it out.
00:18:15.526 - 00:18:23.920, Speaker C: So you kind of got to have fun figuring it out. So you might as well just choose the things that you like. That's kind of why I revisited Vjane, because I forgot about.
00:18:26.370 - 00:18:28.234, Speaker B: You. What are you using for VJing?
00:18:28.362 - 00:18:37.810, Speaker C: This is just resolume. This is just resolume with a snap lens to do the face and resolume in the background just through obs and virtual camera.
00:18:38.470 - 00:18:41.538, Speaker B: You've just said a bunch of stuff that none of us understand. Oh, sorry.
00:18:41.624 - 00:18:56.310, Speaker C: Okay, rewind a little bit. Resolume in the background is VJN software where you can load in different video clips and you can mix them live like, and do little effects.
00:18:56.650 - 00:18:57.640, Speaker D: That's cool.
00:18:58.590 - 00:19:47.800, Speaker C: So you do them in time with the music or different kind of effects. And then. Yeah, that's more like software that people would use in clubs, maybe in a context of a live set. And then the face is just an augmented reality filter that I've built in 3D that runs through a program called Lens Studio that then goes through just the standard Snapchat filter, which I think is actually quite interesting for NFTs because Snapchat and their augmented reality department seem to be doing a lot of stuff that integrates with the AR augmented reality side of. Although Snapchat kind of lost out in some ways to Instagram, they just built this whole suite of tools on the side the whole time. And I think they could be about to have their day.
00:19:48.170 - 00:20:23.620, Speaker B: Yeah, it definitely feels like that way. That ready player, me plus Snapchat, I mean, the way we're doing it, we have an environment in Unreal, and I'm live streaming using this live link app. And this is such a stupid setup. I've got a camera there and I have my phone there pointing directly at me, capturing my face in real time, and then streaming that data to the metahuman, which is there. Now he's woken up again. If I turn my head, you can see I've got a rattail. Right.
00:20:23.620 - 00:20:56.030, Speaker B: But if I lift my hands up, I can't do shit. And we want this more kind of flexible functionality. We want to be able to stream the camera live. All this stuff is just going to take us a bit of time. And what we realize is you just need a much more powerful computer. But that does bring me to another point, which is at the end of the day, Simon won. Somewhere around you there's an instrument that folk call a guitar, and you can pick that up and just play it.
00:20:56.030 - 00:20:58.640, Speaker B: You don't need electricity to play that.
00:21:03.170 - 00:21:14.740, Speaker D: Well, you can plug it in. Muddy Walder's invented electricity, boy. But no, you are right. Electric stuff is you are kind of anchored to the fact that you need a computer.
00:21:16.150 - 00:21:29.030, Speaker B: All right, let's just address this. Probably nothing says you guys seriously talking about music NFts when one of the biggest meltdowns in Defi is happening at the moment with Wonderland. Danny Saga. Yeah, we are. The end. Done. Goodbye.
00:21:29.030 - 00:21:40.726, Speaker B: Harsh, dude. That was harsh. It is harsh. The whole fucking show is called music nfts. We know about Wonderland. We know about Danny. It's been covered in the print section.
00:21:40.726 - 00:21:50.846, Speaker B: You'll be able to read about it later. That's it. We're here to talk about. We're actually expecting a guest on. She hasn't appeared. We were expecting Verite, the musician. Maybe she'll turn up.
00:21:50.846 - 00:22:06.246, Speaker B: I'm keeping an eye on what's going on, but I think she's basically missed it because we booked her very last minute. But that's fine. We have Simon Wang, we have Vector, Maldri, Swannie. Your thoughts on releasing music as nfts? What do you think are the dangers inherent in artists exposing themselves to this space?
00:22:06.428 - 00:22:55.010, Speaker D: Well, I think the dangers are that I'm going to see the pros first. I think NFT with an act is good because basically it's a one stop coupon for merch. You buy your music NFT, so you got the song, and then with that NFT, you can maybe get into a club with it. But my main thought about it, it's nothing really that much different from a digital coupon or a digital ticket. And do I as an audience want to own all these parts? Do I want to have 6% of a fork of a d five project connected to Eminem? Which sometimes, I don't know if it's too much. There's too much things that come with an NFT. So you've got your music, you've got your NFT, and in between that space people are trying to find something that's just unique and different.
00:22:55.010 - 00:23:38.130, Speaker D: And I don't think it doesn't necessarily merit any worth because if you're talking about music nfts, the main thing about it is you want to listen to the music, which is a very passive way of enjoying music. Most people listen to it eyes closed or dancing, not stuck to a computer connected to a stock exchange and worrying about how much staking and earning your different tokens are making it. I think it's a little bit too much. I think if you have an NFT, you buy the song and that might give you some extra perks digitally. That might work in a metaverse, like a digital concert as such. That's cool. It's not necessarily anything different from buying a song and then buying a ticket online for an event, either metaverse or physical.
00:23:38.130 - 00:24:09.690, Speaker D: And also a lot of the resale value on NFTs is oh yeah, but you've proven that you've owned it and you can sell it again. How many times do you think teenagers are going to buy a song off their friend on a lower rate NFT? So you spent five pounds on an eminem NFT and they don't want to listen to it anymore. They're going to sell it to you for three pounds. I mean, then don't. Music. Everyone just goes to YouTube for music or Spotify. Music is a tough one because it's not aimed at the performer anymore.
00:24:09.690 - 00:24:47.000, Speaker D: If you look at the Spotify breakdowns on how much people actually earn, you've got to be doing billions of plays to actually earn any money. Mean if you want to look into the area of where it's going to boom, probably is more like the K pop because their audience is already into metrics. They're very interested in how many times their favorite singer is singing in a band. So you'll have metrics on YouTube, you'll have YouTube cuts where it's only that person. And if you can apply that with NFTs to that area, then probably cool. So if you've got a band with five people in it, you like one person, you buy their NFT and all the content you see is focused on them. Yeah, that's cool.
00:24:47.770 - 00:25:26.582, Speaker C: Wow, that's very interesting actually, because I have recently started, I can't say too much about it, but it's coming out very soon. But I have started dipping my toes into that kind of kpop NFT arena. So I've been doing a bit of work there and I think it is really interesting and is a slightly different type of fan culture. So it's interesting to hear how you think that would work there. I also wonder if you know how. I mean, I agree with you on the kind of speculation aspect of music and the utility. It doesn't necessarily need to be added, but I get a lot of producers saying to me, or musicians saying, not kpop ones but more UK ones that I know.
00:25:26.582 - 00:26:37.340, Speaker C: They're like, how do I get into NFTs? And I wonder if, know, they're still looking for a platform, like, say, audience or the decentralized a, you know, maybe what you think that could do, or if we need something like that, and also B, if you did have to think about the speculation aspect, which might just be unavoidable, do you think there's value in the way, like, back in the day, you'd have certain DJs that only had certain tunes from producers in the form of what they're called dub plates, right? So there was value in kind of being first being connected and you having this kind of music because you would be the only person that plays it, but then you couldn't really monetize that. Or maybe you could if you get certain gigs, but not in the same way. So now is there like a value in the collector of the music, being able to get something first and use that as a platform and maybe that adds an extra dimension to music that we used to appreciate in those kind of underground days that kind of got lost now with the Internet, but in some ways could come back. What do you think?
00:26:37.790 - 00:27:37.182, Speaker D: I think no, there's definite value in that. If you think about, like you say, in terms of a digital dub plate, but where the application lies from, that would be the only way you'd be able to control it is either a live event or, say, a metaverse event. So if you have a metaverse rave and you know that your favorite DJ or act is only going to drop that tune to those people that have got that NFT or subscribed to it, then that's kind of good. But that's the kind of exclusivity thing. That kind of, I don't know, in terms of big business where it'll be popular because you're shutting out a big part of the audience saying, well, you can't listen to this song unless you've got this, which is true anyway. But then the nature of sort of rave and the dub plate thing, it was all about piracy and spreading it out and kind of as an artist, want more people to listen to your music. But going back to what you said about the kpop thing, I think that's where it will lie because their fan base is so hungry for very, what do you call it? Procured stuff.
00:27:37.182 - 00:27:58.046, Speaker D: So if you like one girl's dance mean, it's all available by YouTube. Now I'm going to use Blackpink, for instance. So Blackpink's a band. They're the biggest band in the world. You like Lisa, so you can, using YouTube, just find all video cuts that are just Lisa. They're all zoomed in. There's special cameras that kind of make them smaller.
00:27:58.046 - 00:28:33.214, Speaker D: You can have it. So there's options of cutting everyone else's vocal out so you can only listen to your favorite one. And they're kind of used to that in the east. Like the South Koreans, Chinese, Japanese, they're used to that very myopic view of who they like. Is it a good thing? I don't know. Because then what those metrics will do is they'll say, well, if Lisa's getting all the hits, then we're going to get rid of the other acts, the other singers. But then you flip it around in terms of, okay, you've got your favorite one and you want all your content to be driven by that because you've brought their specific NFT, then, yeah, I think that's good.
00:28:33.214 - 00:29:02.410, Speaker D: But the application of it is what is metaverse or will it work in real life situations? I don't know. I don't think it's going to make any difference in terms of the live performance aspect and just the passive listening experience. But the YouTubers and the digital staff that I just want content from my favorite girl in my favorite girl band or my favorite boy in BTS, 100%. I think there's application there. And the digital dub plates, I mean, digital dub plates.
00:29:04.030 - 00:29:05.930, Speaker B: What do you mean by digital dub plate?
00:29:09.390 - 00:29:45.174, Speaker D: In the old days, a DJ would maybe cut a dub plate so they'll make a tune and they'll press one dub plate, which maybe had 200 plays. So if you wanted to hear that dub plate, you'd have to go to a rave and there's a limited spin on how many times you can really play a dub plate. So if Groove Rider had done a remix of Asin Omnitria or something like that, he's cut the dub plate and the only way you can hear it is to go to that rave. That's what the dub plate would be. And if the dub plate was good, then they'd do a press of it. I mean, could you do that with know you only have a certain amount of.
00:29:45.292 - 00:29:48.806, Speaker B: You could do anything with NFTs. You can make coffee with that.
00:29:48.828 - 00:29:50.546, Speaker C: You can mow your lawn with NFTs.
00:29:50.658 - 00:29:56.122, Speaker D: NFT doesn't mean anything. NFT doesn't mean anything. NFT is just. I don't know, it's just technology.
00:29:56.256 - 00:30:48.342, Speaker B: NFT is not art, it's not music, it's not anything. It's just a method of wrapping data in a way that can be easily transferred and confer ownership to the person that has spent too much ETH for it or cardano or anything else. Listen, I have a good question here, which is the role of technology in all of this and the role of data? Because you were talking about Kpop and you were talking about the analytics driven filter bubbles that allow people to see this and only this. Because I aunt only this. Where is the room for the outlier in all this? Because we know that outliers are what drive innovation and when they what drive creativity. And I've really responded to this recently, the ease of access for kind of discovering stuff and referring. Don't.
00:30:48.342 - 00:31:14.526, Speaker B: If I'm coming up with an idea now, I don't use YouTube anymore. I don't look it up on Google. I just listen to my brain and my brain says, there's an idea and you remember this. So maybe I have a reference from Platoon, the film platoon, and I know it in my head. Rather than go and watch the actual thing from platoon, I'll just use the memory of it to drive how I reference it rather than going back to the original. Because the problem is, if you go back to the original, you start to pastiche it. And a pastiche is never as good as the original.
00:31:14.526 - 00:31:38.534, Speaker B: And pastiche is bullshit anyway. And I feel that's what almost 99% of artists are doing. They're pastiching something. And it's much better to just allow the memory to be color to drive an idea. But don't go back to the original, don't go on Google, don't go on YouTube, just fucking leave it alone. And allow the memory, as distorted and weird as it is, to drive how you then develop the idea. But that is so rare.
00:31:38.534 - 00:31:41.770, Speaker B: We just want this asset pack, we want this instant plugin.
00:31:44.370 - 00:32:38.798, Speaker D: Unfortunately, with NFTs as a creative art form and that the one thing that people care about most is the flip and profit, they're not doing that. I don't say this for a fact, but there's not a lot of people, I don't think, that are just soul tortured and the one thing that they want to do to make them happy is produce digital artwork like they were before. The notion of the starving, fucked up, manic, depressed artist is being lost in NFTs because NFDs, they think, oh, well, if I just copy this ape project and do my own monkey thing, I'm going to make a million pound overnight. And that's the one thing that does Madden about it, and it's enough. You're saying you can rely on your memory. You have a slight identic memory and you're creative. There are a lot of people out there, they want in on NFTs, but they're a, not creative, B, not very good, and C, don't necessarily deserve to be in that space because money, money.
00:32:38.884 - 00:32:44.590, Speaker B: Talent shows. Talent shows, TV talent shows. You are good. You're a snowflake, beautiful thing. No, you're.
00:32:46.310 - 00:32:47.090, Speaker D: Shit.
00:32:48.230 - 00:33:18.890, Speaker B: I am so nice to people. I think, honestly, I should be just much more of an asshole to people and just say it straight. No, you're terrible. The worst thing is when you're a dad and your kids, they're struggling through stuff, and you are so positively reinforcing them because that's what you do as parents these days. It's a real tough one. I want to go through some music NFTs that I have seen of late, because we can just kind of get a feel for what's going on. The reason I wanted to put this session together is because music just feels like it's having a moment right now.
00:33:18.890 - 00:33:38.030, Speaker B: I see so much interesting thing, interesting kind of work being done. Some of it's good, some of it's bad. First up, warps by warp sound. You've got an insight into this one, and I know way less than you do. So why don't you give us kind of some background on this one?
00:33:38.100 - 00:34:07.514, Speaker C: I have actually followed this project since the start. It had a few different names. I'm not too sure what I can say and what I can't say. But if I had to give a surface level overview, they were quite forward thinking. They were going down this route before NFTs. And it's this whole idea of the virtual avatar looking at things like gorillas, little Michaela. But something that's more appealing to our kind of audience, really.
00:34:07.514 - 00:35:02.586, Speaker C: I mean, little Michaela is the kind of know it's an influencer and it's supposed to be like the most appeasing influencer. But this is more like underground music. It's all AI composed music, which is forward thinking in itself, that they were contributing to something called the Google Magenta database, which is one of the main databases that people pull AI code from in order to make music. So they were actually contributors to that, which is what a lot of people are working on. And when NFTs come along, it was just a perfect project to pivot onto something like that. So the idea is that you have these characters, but these characters will become essentially like influencers or artists in their own right, and the whole thing will be completely generated by AI. Actually, one of my favorite things about this project was you might have to dig around to find it, and I hope people do dig around to find it.
00:35:02.586 - 00:36:02.000, Speaker C: But before they were doing NFTs, they were doing twitch streaming, and they did a really cool thing with a guy called Sushi Dragon, which was where? Sushi Dragon, I think, does some of the most, like, cutting edge live audio visual effects. He does twitch streams for hours and he just does all these, like, have you seen him? Yeah, he's built all these rigs and he does all these live effects and he did a live stream with them whereby he was basically using audience interaction to influence the music and the characters djing live. So he was doing his live effects, the audience was feeding into what he was saying, and that was being output into these virtual avatars, both audio wise and visually. So in terms of their journey and what they're doing now, I really respect the fact they were doing this before NFTs, and I really think they were integrating quite a lot of cutting edge, forward thinking things. So I'm really excited to see what they do with this.
00:36:02.450 - 00:36:26.150, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a curious one because I think the art is one thing. Let me see if I can find and see if I can get some of the songs to play, because hopefully we should be able to click on one of these and hear it's.
00:36:30.670 - 00:36:30.986, Speaker A: I.
00:36:31.008 - 00:36:34.010, Speaker D: Got a robot face, I got pink skin and yellow lips.
00:36:36.990 - 00:36:49.854, Speaker B: It's live coming up. I mean, this is kind of fun. Let's see what else we've got. So what's the deal here, Vector? Is this being generated by an AI? This is basically data being fed in. That is.
00:36:49.892 - 00:36:58.910, Speaker C: Yes, here's another one. Yeah, this is all AI.
00:37:00.070 - 00:37:25.850, Speaker D: I think the application of this as well. Imagine there's a rave. So you've got your, I mean, I guess this is what they are doing, but you have your DJ and as the audience, you will submit your NFT and maybe that makes the cut, maybe that makes the mix, you know what I mean? So they can have that with the visuals as well, so if you've somehow stumbled on a really banging track, because, I mean, there's going to be a lot of dog shit on there. There is, but you might have a banging track and your AI is generated itself.
00:37:26.000 - 00:37:28.406, Speaker B: Is that necessarily a given that it's dog shit?
00:37:28.518 - 00:37:33.520, Speaker D: No, but there is going to be dog shit. Otherwise all tracks are good.
00:37:34.130 - 00:37:41.840, Speaker B: So here's another one. This is Fluff world. Fluffs are basically. They're party monsters. They're all kind of doing.
00:37:43.410 - 00:37:52.098, Speaker D: This is nice. I'm going to wrap over it. Oh, God.
00:37:52.184 - 00:37:53.106, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:37:53.288 - 00:38:11.698, Speaker D: Yeah. Wait for the drop. Where's this beat? Old school, yo. I used to think like discords on my chest, dealing with the stars of today's news culture. Some don't listen, but it really doesn't matter. Like the message in the eyes of the people left over. Banging tune bigger the battle.
00:38:11.698 - 00:38:18.294, Speaker D: The newest outro. Go get me the flex of my sound system. Bigger the battle. The newest outro. Go. NFP is going to make me rich.
00:38:18.342 - 00:38:18.714, Speaker B: Come on.
00:38:18.752 - 00:38:19.450, Speaker D: Yuck.
00:38:20.910 - 00:38:39.342, Speaker B: Yeah, that's fluffs. There's party bears. I believe party bears also have some music embedded. I'm not sure if I've got the right ones. Here we go. So party bears are hilarious. It's from the same team, but they've got like, oh, my God, look at this dude.
00:38:39.342 - 00:38:41.170, Speaker B: Look at this dude.
00:38:41.510 - 00:38:47.490, Speaker D: That's big, nasty chinese bear.
00:38:48.310 - 00:38:51.800, Speaker B: I'm a purple chinese bear. Come on, kid me.
00:38:53.210 - 00:38:57.990, Speaker D: It looks like big nasty. I like it. See, that's banging.
00:38:59.850 - 00:39:00.600, Speaker C: Wow.
00:39:01.210 - 00:39:02.520, Speaker D: Music is quite.
00:39:04.030 - 00:39:35.026, Speaker B: So. Me and Al, last year, we started digging heavily into Ableton because we were done after a year of making video content. We just needed to do something different, and we dug into Ableton. Ableton is amazing. Ableton integrates with unreal in a really beautiful way as well. And we've got the option to do all sorts of OSC and MiDi controlled events, triggering things. So what we've discovered, just like you, Vector, we want to take these digital assets and puppet them.
00:39:35.026 - 00:39:50.066, Speaker B: We want to be a fluff and tell you about Defi. We want to actually embody the things that the metaverse is supposed to be about. But the fact is, there's no rules yet. There's no one to tell you this is the way to do it. We're just going to go and do it. Here's another one. Rafe.
00:39:50.066 - 00:39:56.570, Speaker B: Pig. So this is the noise, boys. These ones are. These ones are filth.
00:40:00.370 - 00:40:01.120, Speaker D: Help.
00:40:08.050 - 00:40:26.900, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. So it's just. It's just a loop. It really does. Let's see if we can find another one. Oh, this is naughty. Yeah, that's more like 03:00 a.m.,
00:40:26.900 - 00:40:44.394, Speaker B: oh, yeah. So what else? And this is stellar senses. This is a slightly different one. This is from a team called Nota. And these have a very different vibe. They actually look really beautiful. Yeah, they look really nice.
00:40:44.394 - 00:41:03.226, Speaker B: Let's see if we can have a listen different vibe created for you while I'm waiting. I'm like 20 and I'm loving life right now.
00:41:03.348 - 00:41:07.650, Speaker D: Have hated how long it take it up loop.
00:41:11.110 - 00:41:20.482, Speaker B: You can't keep bearing the bird. Can we go back to the pigs? Alf doesn't like it. Let's go back to the pigs. I love the pigs.
00:41:20.546 - 00:41:23.720, Speaker C: Gracefully tell myself.
00:41:27.870 - 00:41:32.460, Speaker B: Go back to the pigs. The pigs. The pigs have it. The pigs have it.
00:41:33.070 - 00:41:36.220, Speaker D: I see a few rave pigs in my day gurning off.
00:41:40.350 - 00:41:50.670, Speaker B: So these things are like, what are they? Zero point 34. These things are cheap as chips right now. Chips as chops. Wow, more rave pigs.
00:41:51.010 - 00:42:15.160, Speaker C: I think there's something. This is pretty hard. I mean, if you could have a rave pig that you have the rights to, and then in terms of music rights, you could license that music, surely that's like on the roadmap of some of these projects, right?
00:42:15.850 - 00:42:47.022, Speaker B: What does that even mean? What does that even mean? I mean, like, licensing music, what does that mean? Fortunately, later on we're going to have Mike Darlington from Monster Cat, who is a record label owner, and he's doing some crazy things in NFTs, and he probably has a much better handle on all that than I ever will, because he's been in that position of licensing music, having artists come in doing libraries of stuff. But I honestly don't know what that means. Isn't everything free now? Basically, whatever you put out in the world, if it's on the Internet, it's free. Or am I wrong?
00:42:47.156 - 00:42:53.700, Speaker C: You pay for licensing for stuff you use on this channel, right? You have to pay some kind of rights or some kind of package to get a load of stock music.
00:42:54.070 - 00:43:43.106, Speaker B: Yeah, we like, one of my good friends in London is a film composer. And there came a moment where it was just like, well, our job is just gone because audio network came along and they just allowed TV programs and anyone else to get a decent level of kind of composition with stems. And then it's just like, well, where's the room for the composer and all of this? So we use epidemic sound. There's no real reason for why we use epidemic sound, except that it's reasonably cheap and it's reasonably good. But I wish we didn't have to because it feels like we're not supporting musicians the way we could do. And I think one of the things we want to look at this coming year is doing more to plug in more contributors. Maybe it's through a dow, I don't know.
00:43:43.106 - 00:43:58.902, Speaker B: But to really allow, like walk the walk. We talk the talk, but let's walk the walk as well. And it's something that Camilla and I have talked about on a number of different occasions, like how do we actually be web3? How can we be web3?
00:43:58.956 - 00:44:23.040, Speaker D: Let me just jump in. That's fine and that's great. But in terms of ease of use. So now with epidemic sound, all the artists I owe you literally type bells and whistles. I like bells and whistles. You can literally type sad song about nature with happy at the end and you'll get it immediately and it'll cost you thirty cents. And it is a nice thing.
00:44:23.040 - 00:45:12.382, Speaker D: It's honorable to want to license music from different artists, but to say you're paying 0.4 e for a track that you might use once, that's going to add up. And in terms of the commercial value, are you going to be wanting to spend 10,000 in a year on music or $50 a year? I think that is a hard thing and big business is probably going to go for the cheap one. I think what it is is it gives opportunity for lots of artists to make a little bit of money. And like Vector was saying earlier, you get your tunes out there, you might get a little play, but like I say, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be the biggest thing in the world. And if people are comfortable with that, then that's fine. You are going to get these things that will come to the surface because of the zeitgeist, because of the way the world is that are just going to hit and be that big thing.
00:45:12.382 - 00:45:33.298, Speaker D: But as you said, super massive robin, everything's free. I go straight to YouTube if I like a song and maybe if I really, really like it, I want to support the artist. I might buy the itunes thing. But we are living in a culture where you can get everything for free. I don't think I've ever paid for a blackpink song and I've listened to lots of their songs and watched lots.
00:45:33.394 - 00:45:54.174, Speaker B: But that's what I mean. Everything is free. And so the money's in concerts and the money's in merch. The interesting thing is there is a perfectly good living to be had creating library music and you can go online and watch a gazillion Ableton tutorials from people who do exactly that. They churn out tracks, they churn out five a day.
00:45:54.292 - 00:46:03.498, Speaker D: But then you've got NFTs that can make them for free. You buy an NFT with an AI program and you can literally press generate. And like you said earlier, that is exactly my point.
00:46:03.684 - 00:46:54.950, Speaker B: I'm actually going to just go through what it's like for us to look for music. So ALP and I generally will have about probably three to 4 hours to edit a video, which is not long. So 20 minutes video, three to 4 hours. We have to go like the clappers. So, Al, what is the process for choosing music for you? First rule for choosing music for the defined is, I guess, choosing instrumental music because we don't want the vocals to overpower whatever you're saying. Right? So we go for instrumental stuff. So we filter out by instrumentals and then I guess we want something that is rather chilled out, lo fi, just something hip hop.
00:46:54.950 - 00:47:21.234, Speaker B: And that's the sort of vibe we're going for, especially for tutorials. First looks, sorry, I don't want to cut you off, but we have a guest. We have verite. Verite, how you doing? Welcome to the live show NFTs. We're talking about music. So Verite, welcome to the stream. Verite is a Brooklyn based singer songwriter and someone who's plunged headfirst into the world of web3 NFTs.
00:47:21.234 - 00:47:30.460, Speaker B: I'm so excited to have you on the show because you're doing it, you're living it. And I wonder if you could just start by telling us a little bit about yourself and your journey over the last twelve months.
00:47:31.010 - 00:48:03.926, Speaker A: Yes. Hello, friends. Apologies, I'm a second late. Time zones are hard, but I'm so excited to be here. And yeah, I mean, I really made a decision to commit 3000% into this new world when I recognized that the systems and platforms and tools that I had used to build my career were no longer serving me. Right. It's like all of these platforms were essentially cutting me off from the communities and fan bases that I had spent years building.
00:48:03.926 - 00:48:43.890, Speaker A: And I found that to be extremely frustrating. And so I spent all of 2020 looking for tools to connect direct to my fans and I found a few. And then when I was introduced to the wonderful world of Web three, this feels like a place where there are limitless tools that we can develop in order for artists to have full control over their relationships with their community and create mutually beneficial situations with that community and provide just new tiers of value for them. So I've just been exploring all of that wonderful stuff, and it's been a wild ride.
00:48:44.390 - 00:48:55.720, Speaker B: There must have been a moment. Excuse me? There must have been a moment when the lights came on where you realized that this is the thing that made sense for you as an artist. What was that moment?
00:48:56.410 - 00:49:54.746, Speaker A: I think there were a few moments in COVID. I started a podcast called Anatomy of an artist, where I was interviewing artists about the intersection of how they create their art, how they live their lives, and how they build their businesses, and how, as artists, we're supposed to navigate those things. And I had Rac on my podcast relatively early in November of 2020, and we talked about how the music industry was so bad at valuing their number one asset, the music. And so, from my perspective, the baseline of music is free, and I think that's inherently good. I don't think that you should have to have a lot of money to be able to experience a wide variety of music and art, but the unintended consequence of that is no one is willing to pay for music. And so what that conversation did for me was turn on the light of, like, okay, both things can be true. Music can be free.
00:49:54.746 - 00:50:33.720, Speaker A: But as artists and as entrepreneurs, we can experiment with creating tiers of value on top of free in new ways. Right. It's not going to be the pure digital asset, but we need to create a new experience around that. And so that's when the light went on. And then I feel like with each experiment that I've done, additional lights have turned on, and it's been like, oh, I can stretch this in this direction, or we can tie it to real world assets that maybe are going to allow the fan onboarding process to be easier. And so it's definitely a gradual process, but now I've drunk the Koolaid I'm in.
00:50:34.970 - 00:51:03.890, Speaker B: You said so many good things there, and I think that the thing that stands out the most is it's a little bit and a little bit further. A little bit further. And that feels really kind of organic and wholesome and experimental, but also kind of normal. Do you think there's a degree to which the easy access to tutorials that will tell you exactly how to auto tune your voice or how to know perfect vocals in Ableton has made being a unique and original artist exponentially harder?
00:51:07.110 - 00:52:09.254, Speaker A: That's really interesting. I mean, we literally have a whole genre called Spotify core, which is just essentially algorithmically pleasing music. And I think that it's a both and I think that democratizing the production of music, which computers and reasonably priced daws have done, is, again, it's inherently good. I think that more access is good, but then it creates, like, an oversaturated pool of artists vying for the same spots. And so I don't necessarily think it's quote unquote harder. I just think the people who succeed in art, in business are people who differentiate themselves, know who they are, offer something unique, and then proceed to build something beautiful out. So I think that from my perspective, it's like if you want to make kind of simple, algorithmically pleasing music, that's cool, and you can actually be wildly successful doing that.
00:52:09.254 - 00:52:29.820, Speaker A: But if you want to be a unique artist that has their own perspective, yeah, it'll probably take more effort, but in my mind, it'll be way more rewarding. I've always made music that's left of center. I've always operated in my career left of center. And so I've just kind of embraced that. I'm playing my own game.
00:52:30.910 - 00:52:55.650, Speaker B: And I guess the cliche is that you play your own game and you are designed to be poor. And I think that's the artist's journey. You live this kind of attic Garrett existence. You write in a notebook, and you are creatively pure, but you're also creatively poor. That's changed now. And do you think that's healthy?
00:52:56.070 - 00:53:35.346, Speaker A: I do. I think that even in the music industry, it's so taboo to talk about money, right? It's like, oh, we're artists. We don't talk about money because we don't care about money. Right? And it's just like I've been advocating, really, for the last seven years of my independent career, that artists need to be entrepreneurs. Artists need to understand the business that they're participating in. Because when you inject money into art, it changes its DNA. Right? If I'm just creating art with no financial incentive, that is accessible to all, but if we're creating businesses that need to sustain within a marketplace, it's just a pragmatic shift of focus.
00:53:35.346 - 00:54:25.226, Speaker A: And I believe that both actually can exist. And again, if we're creating unique value propositions and worlds and environments for fans to exist in, we can do both. But we also, as artists, need to understand what's in our contracts. What are we signing away? What are the businesses that we're going to build? What are the constellation of revenue streams that we have coming in that are going to sustain said businesses? Where is our capital coming, and what am I giving away? For that capital. Right. And I think that that's kind of how I started my journey, is like, I bootstrapped all the money from tips from Applebee's in Times Square, right? And so I understood, okay, I'm investing x amount, and I understood the risk of that. And then I understood where all of that money was going because it was my money.
00:54:25.226 - 00:54:45.080, Speaker A: And there's such a detachment between artists and the business. And I think that in the traditional music industry, I'm just too intense for people. Right? But in web3, I found people who understand and speak my language and meet this intensity with an equal amount, if not more intensity, for, like, cool. What are we going to build?
00:54:46.490 - 00:55:20.658, Speaker B: That's, forgive the pun, music to my ears, because Swannie, who is Simon one up here, he and I have been creative kind of co conspirators for so long. And, Alicia, the word that you come to expect and hear the most often is no. And in web3, the word you hear the most often is, yeah. And it's a yes culture. It is such a weird thing, like just switching your brain around to being, well, what if. What if we did do that? Rather than, oh, no, we can't do that for legal reasons. We can't do that because social won't like it.
00:55:20.658 - 00:55:36.230, Speaker B: We can't do it because of this. Who gives a fuck? And by the way, you can f bomb on this podcast, and you should, because I've read your tweets, and you swear like a sailor. So get it on. Be real. You have nothing to fear here. You're among friends.
00:55:36.380 - 00:55:39.034, Speaker A: It's ingrained in my personality at this point.
00:55:39.232 - 00:55:43.420, Speaker B: But when you said you're a bit intense, what do you mean by that?
00:55:46.510 - 00:56:34.134, Speaker A: I think that I know my value, and especially when it comes again, it's like any talk of business and money within the artist community, amongst collaborators, the traditional way of doing things is like, management handles all of that. Right? But the issue is, for instance, let's say we're writing a song. Management is not in the room. They don't know the percentage of splits. They don't know who did what work. Like, I know what work. And so instead of just deferring things to other people, because artists need their mental space to create, it's way easier for artists to just be like, hey, this is what I feel like I contributed.
00:56:34.134 - 00:57:20.742, Speaker A: This is what you feel like you contributed. And let's just come to a meeting of the minds. And so I think that that's just one example and also in ways of me just really pushing artists to recognize that you can build your own. You do not need to wait for Spotify to playlist your song. You don't need to wait for a label or a manager to come in and start developing this. You can build your own ecosystem and then put yourself in a better position to negotiate as you are bringing on partners. And I think that, again, those conversations, it's just like we're still battling that artists only create art.
00:57:20.742 - 00:57:47.090, Speaker A: And I think that, honestly, that's the luxury position. I would love to just actually, no, I'm always going to be this psychotic about the business side, but I just think that that's for the top point. 99%. Right. And everybody else needs to be practical of what is it going to take to build something that is going to cut through the clutter.
00:57:48.710 - 00:58:15.260, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think you've just ported the old problem, which is we need to cut through the noise and now it wears a web3 crown. And the skeptics are going to say, well, you're just polishing a turd or you're putting a bow tie on a dog or whatever. What's your response to that? Because I'm sure you get a huge amount of pushback from people, particularly trad people. Maybe your manager, maybe your agent, if you have one. It's a scam. It's all a scam. How do you respond to that?
00:58:16.910 - 00:58:52.406, Speaker A: Well, I'm lucky that my manager has just like, she's come with me fully. I am not an idealist in any sense. I am a pragmatist. And the same problems that we have in these traditional systems will come over to web3 if we are not intentional. Right. The same power structures are going to, and we're going to face the same oversaturation problems. We're going to face the same gatekeeping problems.
00:58:52.406 - 00:59:47.400, Speaker A: Right? That being said, it is a whole new subset of tooling that if we build it correctly, and we build it with accessibility and diversity and intention, what we can do is allow artists to be in control of those tools without the intermediaries. So from my perspective, yes, web3, there's vibrant communities, everyone's excited, but I'm viewing it as tooling. And it's just like, what tools can I ideate, pilot and then scale out for other artists to use that are going to allow artists to be the center of their own businesses and not be fully reliant on platforms? We're always going to have to utilize platforms, right? I don't want to build my own platform. Right? That being said, it's like how do we put artists at the center of that and empower the core of the.
00:59:47.850 - 01:01:31.842, Speaker D: Well, yeah, I was going to say isn't the dichotomy of that, though, that if you look at legacy artists, say Kurt Cobain or Neil Young or Jimi Hendrix, would their music have been created if they were in an ecosystem where you have to be your own company, you have to be your own marketing system, you have to be your own financial advisor? There is a risk of that. The artists that go forward into web3 that have to create with that in mind might hit certain hurdles and never actually get there, just because it's cool to say, I want to write my own music, I want to create my own audience, and I'm going to design my own future. But it might be a case of not saying it will, but it might be a case of those hurdles that might be too much. So there might be a lot of music and musicians and people that want to create that are just going to say, this is just too hard, whether that's a good thing or not or a bad thing, it might be a good thing because it means there's less shit. But I worry that if every artist has to think of these things from the base level for web3, what type of music and creativity are we going to get? I mean, I know I'm a run old romantic. I like to think of the tortured artist, and I know it's not the real way, but there is some of that that makes, that legitimizes music. It kind of feels like, are you Ed Sheeran or are you Leonard Cohen? Do you know what I mean? And it's which one are you going to be? And even though you are going to be this sort of self starting web3 thing, as you say, there are going to be gatekeepers and there are going to be digital web3 management companies which will say, okay, you've done it all yourself to this point, but then give us all your rights to everything and we'll take it to the next level, which essentially does sort of retrofit and become the old fashioned record label.
01:01:31.842 - 01:02:04.398, Speaker D: So, I mean, it's a tightrope, I guess, where artists are walking. Because if you're doing music because you love music and you love to create and it's part of your soul and your passion, like you say, it shouldn't matter how much money you make or your audience, but if it's already embedded that you have to have that, I worry that there might be geniuses that quit too early because music, unfortunately has reached its end. There is no new music. It's just iterations of old stuff, which isn't bad. But there's nothing. No one's going to invent the electric guitar. No one's going to invent sampling anymore.
01:02:04.398 - 01:02:09.080, Speaker D: It's done. And the only innovations that it's not done, it is.
01:02:10.490 - 01:02:12.070, Speaker A: There's no musical innovation.
01:02:13.770 - 01:02:18.600, Speaker D: I disagree. You. All right, you name me one music that's new the last 25 years.
01:02:19.290 - 01:02:27.450, Speaker B: Let Verite respond. But I also want to say hello to Mike Darlington from Monster Cat, the pride of Canada. He's here with us.
01:02:27.600 - 01:02:28.554, Speaker E: What up, everybody?
01:02:28.672 - 01:02:35.374, Speaker F: I've been enjoying listening. I don't even know if I want to be on the show. I just kind of want to listen to the show. This has been great.
01:02:35.572 - 01:02:41.280, Speaker B: Yeah, well, Verita Swani said a lot here, and plenty I'm sure you want to respond to. So go ahead.
01:02:43.910 - 01:02:44.722, Speaker C: Sorry, could you.
01:02:44.776 - 01:02:49.122, Speaker A: Interesting. Wait, did I do it?
01:02:49.176 - 01:02:49.394, Speaker B: No.
01:02:49.432 - 01:02:50.722, Speaker F: I thought you were asking me the question.
01:02:50.776 - 01:02:51.314, Speaker E: I'm so sorry.
01:02:51.352 - 01:02:52.050, Speaker B: Go ahead.
01:02:52.200 - 01:03:42.100, Speaker A: Oh, you're good. Simon, you have a really interesting point. And it's like a super valid critique of, again, the idea that how do artists create if we're so focused on the business? And we're seeing that right now in terms of the idea that artists are now being viewed as, quote unquote, content creators. Right. And in order for a song of mine to hit algorithmically, I need to be dancing on TikTok, which is the exact opposite of my personality. We've gotten to know each other at all. But I also think that there's, like, a ground reality that unless you're walking into the music industry with 100 grand in your pocket to spend and the money to actually invest in yourself.
01:03:42.100 - 01:04:47.222, Speaker A: Because artists have an idealized view of creation and what creating art and being a musician looks like, they're putting themselves in positions where they're signing predatory deals and giving ownership true back to someone else. And I think that all I'm advocating, and it can look any different way, all I'm advocating for is for artists to be more aware of what's going on within whatever their ecosystem is and then move forward with that. And for me, I also recognize I have a very unique capacity to juggle both. And that's why I'm so excited to build tooling for artists. Right. Because my ideal is that I can create a bunch of tools for artists to use that resonate with what their skill sets are. Right.
01:04:47.222 - 01:05:09.710, Speaker A: So for some people, dancing on TikTok is great. It works for them. For other people, it's going to be generative art for other people. It's going to be all of these different things. But also recognizing that I just want artists to have really healthy businesses and people around really creating under time constraint.
01:05:11.650 - 01:05:13.360, Speaker D: Oh, no, she's gone.
01:05:14.530 - 01:05:15.710, Speaker B: Verita.
01:05:17.730 - 01:05:18.798, Speaker C: That was a good point.
01:05:18.884 - 01:05:37.270, Speaker B: Justin, let's cut off Mike. I think you're on mute, man. I am on mute. Mike, what's your take on this? Because see you nodding your head and looking at this as a label boss of monster cat. Does this resonate with you? How do you manage artists?
01:05:38.670 - 01:05:40.170, Speaker E: What specific component?
01:05:40.750 - 01:05:52.720, Speaker B: Well, how do you educate artists? How do you. You're on mute. The message. Are you on mute? How do you spread the message? And how do you educate people?
01:05:53.890 - 01:05:55.566, Speaker F: Sorry, can you guys hear me?
01:05:55.748 - 01:05:56.382, Speaker D: Yes.
01:05:56.516 - 01:05:57.230, Speaker E: Okay, cool.
01:05:57.300 - 01:06:15.720, Speaker F: Just want to make sure, in regards to web3 and NFTs, the way that we've been doing it has really been a lot of one on one conversation. Just getting into a call and letting them ask the questions. I think I.
01:06:17.770 - 01:06:18.520, Speaker E: Got.
01:06:23.450 - 01:06:24.200, Speaker D: It.
01:06:37.050 - 01:06:38.310, Speaker C: That was epic.
01:06:38.470 - 01:06:39.660, Speaker B: Well, that was real.
01:06:40.050 - 01:06:42.222, Speaker C: Music is something, isn't it?
01:06:42.356 - 01:06:46.938, Speaker F: What is going on? I'm getting this crazy echo. I'm only in one stream.
01:06:47.114 - 01:06:49.118, Speaker B: Something went really wrong there.
01:06:49.284 - 01:06:50.880, Speaker A: Simon, that was great.
01:06:52.930 - 01:06:54.080, Speaker B: This is art.
01:06:55.350 - 01:06:57.042, Speaker F: I'm still getting an echo. Let me try.
01:06:57.096 - 01:06:59.460, Speaker B: Like, it should be gone now.
01:07:00.790 - 01:07:01.394, Speaker F: Wow.
01:07:01.512 - 01:07:16.086, Speaker B: Okay, Mike, if you saw the setup we had here, it's no wonder it went wrong. When we're talking about pushing the boundaries, it's like pushing the boundaries of people's ear canals. Sorry, everyone. I think it went wrong. I fixed it.
01:07:16.108 - 01:07:22.250, Speaker F: Now, I thought you might have applied, like, an echo or reverb effect to me just to add an impact.
01:07:22.750 - 01:07:31.120, Speaker B: It was like an episode of Doctor who. I don't know what happened there. That was mental. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
01:07:31.650 - 01:07:35.310, Speaker F: I'm still getting the echo, though. I'm terrified that's an effect.
01:07:35.380 - 01:07:36.000, Speaker D: Okay.
01:07:40.210 - 01:07:45.890, Speaker F: Let me try to get my train of thought. It's been a lot of one on one conversation.
01:07:50.710 - 01:07:59.010, Speaker B: I'm sorry. That was so bad. Wow. At least you fixed it as you were. Go ahead, Mike.
01:07:59.350 - 01:08:12.250, Speaker F: I'd say that the issue is partially been education, but the biggest problem, to be honest, I've been seeing, is that it's fear. It's just straight up fear to give this a shot, fear of what the fan base will think.
01:08:12.400 - 01:08:13.882, Speaker E: They've put in so much work building.
01:08:13.936 - 01:08:35.090, Speaker F: Their audience, and they don't want to risk that, especially in the modern climate. That's the biggest challenge to overcome. It is not like learning how to set up a wallet or learning how to mint or which marketplace to use. They get that really quick. It starts to click like, okay, I could connect with them on discord, I could do a merch drop. I could invite them to my show. Those things all click instantly.
01:08:35.670 - 01:08:36.866, Speaker E: But I don't want to talk about.
01:08:36.888 - 01:08:41.300, Speaker F: It on my socials. That's where it starts to like, okay, well, we got a problem here.
01:08:42.470 - 01:08:51.800, Speaker B: Very tight. Do you get the oh, but NFTs are bad for the environment argument thrown at you? Because that's an easy stick to hit us with.
01:08:52.970 - 01:09:27.042, Speaker A: Yeah. I think that climate change is like a very wicked problem, and I think that I have done my own research and recognize that that's going to be an issue for some people with any technological developments. Ultimately they're going to be bad for the environment. I have a long view that ultimately it will be better for the environment in the long run, as we can hopefully get rid of some of these legacy systems. And was that me?
01:09:27.176 - 01:09:32.258, Speaker B: No, my computer hates me. I have no idea what's going on.
01:09:32.424 - 01:10:07.790, Speaker A: But I made a decision that I don't have complex conversations on Twitter. It's not meant for nuanced and difficult conversations. And so if people want to have a conversation with me about the environmental impacts of NFTs, they can come on my discord and I'll just have long form discussions with people where they can long form and we can debate it out because I think that it's way more productive. And I've actually had a lot of really interesting conversations with fans on discord about NFTs and the environmental impact.
01:10:08.450 - 01:10:53.280, Speaker B: Mike, you've been one of the people I've kind of enjoyed talking to the most over the last six months, because you come from a space where everything's creative and you do music and you put on events and everything else, but you just love nfts. You love them in a way that is just refreshing and beautiful and exciting and lovely. You invited me into a group where you talk with other like minded people about NFTs, and we've never kind of got jaded by it. It's weird in all coins and everything else that happened, but what was it that persuaded you that this space was worth seriously investing in and putting an enormous amount of time into getting behind and making something happen in?
01:10:56.210 - 01:11:15.314, Speaker F: I think it's the creativity. It's seeing something new all the time. You have to admit, Robin, we're always chatting about something that new that we're seeing. We go through phases, don't get me wrong, where it's just straight degenning. And it's like, this was the same project five times in a row. Why did we do this? But in general, it's every couple of weeks there's something. We're like, this is cool, this is cool.
01:11:15.314 - 01:11:24.454, Speaker F: And it's hard sometimes to keep that level of excitement. And I guess it's that bit of that serotonin drip of, like, something new.
01:11:24.492 - 01:11:25.862, Speaker D: Something new, something new.
01:11:25.996 - 01:11:40.650, Speaker F: So I really appreciate that the technology here has enabled so much innovation to come, and it's created this flexible narrative for anybody. I think that's what keeps me so tied to it on a daily, weekly basis.
01:11:41.070 - 01:11:55.650, Speaker B: And, Verity, do you feel like the technology is getting in the way of you actually making music? That the discussion and everything else is an impediment to the creative process? And do you give yourself moments to just step away and just write and be musical?
01:11:56.870 - 01:13:10.522, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel like my entire music making journey has always been like, how do I create while I do a million other things? I mean, again, it's like, when I started, I was waiting tables, like 80 hours a week, right? There was very little time to create music, and I just did it where I did it, as I did it. And now, if anything, I feel like all of this is really freeing if we're looking at the additional revenue streams that are available to take pressure off of creating music, that only satiates the algorithm. I did a piece with Async that had 246 unique versions of a song that people could cobble together. I'm really interested in generative art, and how can I take a song off this next record and create an infinite loop of it and pair that with artwork? So if anything, I feel like it's expanding what I feel is possible for creation. And then I've always been the type of creative where it's just like, all of a sudden, I'll have eight songs and I don't know where they came from and putting together the record. Right.
01:13:10.522 - 01:13:37.380, Speaker A: And so from my perspective, it's like all of this limitless capacity for creativity actually makes it easier to focus on the music because there's actually less stress about how it's going to be received outwardly. It's like, oh, I know that I have a core group of people that I'm going to create something really special for, and we'll see how it does on streaming. Right. It's no longer a singular focus.
01:13:38.150 - 01:14:12.000, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely resonate with that because, as you can see, I have a digital, unreal engine version of myself. We did only this last week, and people didn't like it very much. So now we're kind of doing a hybrid. But the goal is to move fully virtual and embrace the metaverse and be that thing. But Mike, you gave me a glimpse of what it was that you were thinking this future of music could be in terms of using technology and all sorts of different things at your disposal. Can you tell us anything about that? Maybe relics, maybe where you're moving with Monster cap.
01:14:13.330 - 01:14:14.080, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:14:15.810 - 01:15:01.900, Speaker F: I'll start with my big picture vision around what web3 and web two music can look like. Before I get into anything that we're doing, I've had this belief that I don't think it's about one or the other. I think that we will continue to have incredible resources and tools in web two for streaming and for discovery mechanisms to the millions of people. But I do believe that Web three has enabled and will continue to enable this incredible ability to connect directly with superfans, to build great engaged communities and create augmented revenue streams. I'm not an advocate of one or the other. I believe in more of like a hybrid model to exist. So that's kind of like my general thesis, my take on this.
01:15:01.900 - 01:15:52.426, Speaker F: For Monstercat, we have a project called Relics. And relics are basically music, digital collectibles. They are songs, audiovisual songs tokenized on the blockchain. Full songs, full animations for those songs that are additioned so similar to the art world, you could have a 30 of 30 edition of a song and its album art. But what I got excited about was not like when we were coming up with this idea, it wasn't just a straight tokenizing and minting music on the blockchain. I think that's amazing. I think cool platform is doing it, but it's what I started to realize you could do with the rest of the NFT, with what can be done with NFTs in general that you wouldn't be able to do in the web two ecosystem, one of them being the rarity tools.
01:15:52.426 - 01:16:15.054, Speaker F: So I should mention, because you've got our tickets up right now, we've only done the presale. We haven't even gone live yet. The mint goes live. I don't want to say the exact date because I don't have it locked in yet and probably in the next week or so. So you're looking at just our presale tickets at the moment. Anyways, the point I'm getting at the NFTs allow us to do some really innovative new technology and do innovative new things. We've never been able to do with music.
01:16:15.054 - 01:16:39.100, Speaker F: Like the integration into the metaverse. For example, you can now basically make music syncable to different games, play to earn ecosystems. Yeah, exactly. Let's pull the idol up. You could have it work with other NFTs or other digital models so that within the metaverse, you can be playing music to people and do that in a licensed way. That's something that's never been able to be done before. I can go.
01:16:41.870 - 01:16:45.790, Speaker B: Hold on a second. Break that down. Okay, what does that mean exactly?
01:16:45.940 - 01:16:51.950, Speaker F: Okay, so click on this guy. Or actually, even better, if you go to the marketplace. Click on the marketplace.
01:16:53.490 - 01:16:58.072, Speaker B: You're piloting me remotely and I'm terrible. Terrible. Which marketplace? This marketplace.
01:16:58.072 - 01:17:06.162, Speaker F: Marketplace, yeah. And then type in monster cat. And then type in. Click it.
01:17:06.296 - 01:17:07.742, Speaker B: God, this is exciting, everyone.
01:17:07.816 - 01:17:08.342, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:17:08.476 - 01:17:11.814, Speaker F: And then the genesis idol should be at the top.
01:17:11.852 - 01:17:12.902, Speaker E: Right there on the right.
01:17:13.036 - 01:17:14.440, Speaker B: Yes. Got it.
01:17:15.210 - 01:18:03.766, Speaker F: And then if you click on that. There we go. So you can just play around with that guy. So this was a 3D modeled NFT where we have created code that when you purchase this NFT, you receive the files, the code, so that you can upload this to decentraland or any other metaverse environment. And when you walk up to it, it'll pop up a UI ux on the screen on the front of it that'll actually let you select from the music you have in your wallet the songs, like a digital jukebox and actually play music to the people around you. So this was like one of the first test cases we did for what's possible with music that lives within, that's minted on the blockchain that's in your wallet. Can you then create experiences for people around you? So this was one of the first things we did.
01:18:03.766 - 01:19:04.220, Speaker F: And then the second thing we did after that was we started to realize that if we really do want to show that this ethos of web two and web3 will exist, then you're going to want people to be excited when music is doing well in the web two ecosystem, on Spotify, on Apple music, on radio, play on television shows, whatnot. And the way we did that is we actually created the rarity system to be based exclusively on an algorithm for how well the song that you own is performing in the real world. So we take all that data that comes in for the music and we spit out, it's called a gemstone on the relic, but it'll spit out the new rarity for your song based upon if it's like crushing in the real world kind of like if it was a gold or platinum record. So the reason we wanted to do all this is, again to show that NFTs have this wealth of innovation and technological development that can occur around them that we wouldn't be able to do with a streaming platform or an MP3.
01:19:04.990 - 01:19:28.930, Speaker B: So I guess where this comes down to is if something is popular, it must be good. But I don't think necessarily everything that is popular is good. And things that aren't popular can be amazing. So I'm curious, verity, if you have any thoughts on that, because the metrics shouldn't matter, the tech shouldn't matter, we should just make music and an audience will find us if we're good enough. Or do you disagree?
01:19:29.590 - 01:20:39.400, Speaker A: Hey, I really love everything I just saw on the screen. And I think it's really cool to bridge the two worlds. And that's what I'm most excited about in all of this, is like, how do we take things that people are already familiar with and do really cool things with them to bring them kind of more into the metaverse? Robin, that's a question. I think that good is really subjective and it has to be, because if something resonates with a lot of what we're seeing, I mean, maybe pre algorithm is that taste was also democratized what people naturally gravitated towards and wanted to listen to. And what the culture resonated with wasn't necessarily what the critics thought was good. Right? And so I think that good is wholly relative. And if you make highly technical and proficient music that no one wants to listen to, is that good? It's much more of a philosophical question.
01:20:39.400 - 01:21:31.080, Speaker A: And I think that that's why, again, I'm all about the pragmatic taking the art and being like, well, who's the audience? Who wants to listen to it? What's the ecosystem? Because maybe, as we see in classical music, sometimes, if you're making perfect and brilliant music that maybe has less of an audience, you're going to have a higher donor because there's a respect for the art form, right? So you need less people to create a financial ecosystem that's going to sustain your art. But maybe if you're making kind of Spotify core that resonates really well, it's less so, and you need millions of people passively listening, not even knowing who you are. So I think that I don't have a solid answer for that, but I do think it all comes back to who are your people, who is your tribe, who are you creating art for? And then catering to that community.
01:21:32.410 - 01:22:41.582, Speaker B: And then that comes down to the idea of, well, how do you find them? And I think that's probably what a lot of people coming into this space struggle with, because they don't understand how these communities form, how they talk to each other, because, let's be honest, it's a bit weird. And also who you can possibly trust to be what they say they are. And I think there's quite a lot of handholding that needs to be done to guide people through the weirdness of this space, because there are so many things that you need to start to learn, like trading, like understanding markets, understanding the role that bitcoin plays in all of this, the role that macro markets play in all this, because they're all somewhat connected to it, which music and culture have not been previously in any extent whatsoever. Now suddenly they are. So there's this additional set of pressures that are placed upon artists if they want to play in this space. And you made the point earlier that artists need to be entrepreneurs, but I'm not sure that every artist is cut out to be an entrepreneur, if I'm honest. And so I think there's a reason why I got you two up on stage here is because I feel like you have a lot to share and an urge to share it with people.
01:22:41.582 - 01:22:57.362, Speaker B: But I'm curious if you feel like that job is sometimes too difficult or whether what the challenges are for you in guiding people in the right way into this space. Let's start with you, Mike.
01:22:57.506 - 01:23:52.086, Speaker F: Well, Robin, I think the same problem in the music industry be if you want to break as an artist, unfortunately, you have to understand creation of content. You have to understand engaging with your audience and developing your brand. The reality is it's just not good enough to be a great musician in the modern ecosystem. There's too many other things that go into if you want to be a broken touring artist, to get to that point, you can have the best manager in the world, but if you don't understand how to speak to your audience, they're not going to be able to do it for you because it's not your voice. It doesn't come through as authentic. The fans feel it very quickly that this is like a manager or a social media person typing back to me. So that requirement to be able to do this in web3, honestly, you've had to do in web two as well.
01:23:52.086 - 01:24:16.720, Speaker F: And we've not signed artists before because we've looked at the whole package around the act and we're like, we love the song, we really love the song, but everything else here, it just isn't there. And we don't know if we're going to invest so much time, resources, staff members, which every time we do that, it takes away from another artist who could have had that time, because you're missing so much. And I think we're going to see the same thing in web3.
01:24:18.610 - 01:24:29.940, Speaker B: Barry, same question to you. How do you navigate all of this? How do you allow other people to find what you found, but in their own way and in their own unique way for themselves?
01:24:30.630 - 01:25:55.610, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think this goes back to what Simon had said before, right. That if artists are focusing. I'm paraphrasing, but if artists are focusing solely on the business, would the same art be created? And I guess how I feel is that if an artist can't sustain themselves financially and has to work one or two day jobs, it's also splitting that focus. And so I would much rather artists have the split focused in terms of their own ecosystems. And what I've been talking to a lot of artists about, especially as they emerge in web3. But also, again, I've been talking about this for years, just in general, is what is the whole ecosystem of your project look like? What is the constellation of revenue streams that you have based on what you do that range from exactly what I want to be doing, I want to be songwriting, creating, building worlds, et cetera, to I write music for other people. I do commercial music, I do x, I do y, because I feel like the goal is to have all of those revenue streams be things that you like and love doing, none of which is like, again, it's like I have this paranoid fear that none of which is me going back and waiting tables at Applebee's.
01:25:55.610 - 01:26:22.214, Speaker A: Right. And so that has been my mentality as I've grown. And I've found a lot of success in that way of being really open. And I think that as artists move into web3, trying to just empower them to build a different skill set. Right. Because building, like being an artist is hard, right. Doing anything worth doing is going to be hard.
01:26:22.214 - 01:26:51.440, Speaker A: You're going to have to develop. And so from my perspective, it's just like, I would much rather push artists in the direction of knowing what they have to do, knowing how they have to build, and then bringing people on who are then going to help, then bringing on the business manager, bringing on the manager, bringing on the agent. Right. The ideal goal is we get to a point where we're only doing the one thing we love doing, but until we get there, building healthy and sustainable foundations, I think, is key.
01:26:52.130 - 01:27:48.466, Speaker B: So there's a process here which is about deprogramming, because there's the old way, there's the way that people are very comfortable with and they built businesses off and they've learned how to leverage their contacts, particularly in the music industry and particularly in creative arts, like who, you know, is a very important part of this. Suddenly in web3, that matters a lot less, actually. You have to live in what I call the hyper present. You have to be constantly aware of the right now and how it affects everything that you're doing. Something we've had to adapt to on this channel is we publish the day we shoot, and if we publish the day after, it feels stale. I've never in my life been in a position like that where I value quality and I value doing things well, but suddenly I have to be able to do it in a live stream setting. And I've proven during this live stream I can't do it, at least not effectively managing my own audio and everything else because I fucked it up.
01:27:48.466 - 01:28:12.134, Speaker B: But rather than seeing that as a problem, I've sort of seen it as a challenge. Alp, who's on the stream with me, drinking beer and fiddling with his microphone, contributing nothing. Alp built the set here. He built the set here. We've been struggling. What's up? We've been struggling with this thing. But I'm fully with you here because there's a chicken and egg situation here.
01:28:12.134 - 01:28:43.918, Speaker B: Your audience either knows who you are or they don't. So most people, what they do is they have a genre that they want to work in and they understand that genre and they understand the people who listen to that genre and they cater to that audience. And then there are some people who are just doing stuff that's wacky and then people gravitate towards it. That's the thing that everybody wants to be, but the thing that's easiest is to do the other thing. And so you're in this constant struggle. It's like either I do the thing that I know will work or I take the massive risk and do the thing that has a good chance of not working. But if it works, I'm a genius.
01:28:43.918 - 01:29:04.170, Speaker B: So what do you do? I mean, that's really tough. Look, I'm literally the one thing and the other thing at the same time because I can't decide. I haven't got the balls to really go full into that one. But I know that that is where I need to be. Warts and all. And we're still figuring out, but at least we're doing it kind of publicly. There's a question in there somewhere.
01:29:04.170 - 01:29:06.220, Speaker B: Swani, help me out here.
01:29:06.830 - 01:29:12.240, Speaker D: Well, I mainly like your mohawk when you pull a full left and right thing.
01:29:13.490 - 01:29:17.742, Speaker B: There's a rattail in there as well. It's so disgusting. It's beautiful.
01:29:17.876 - 01:30:03.774, Speaker D: No, I think to some extent an answer to what you're saying, which isn't really one. Is that my worry? Is that okay? It's cool, web3, everyone's got a little piece of things. So now you've got 10,000 artists with a very manicured, myopic audience with maybe 200, 300 people, which is fine, but where would the Amy Winehouses be in all this stuff? If you look back, maybe music doesn't have to be this historical standpoint anymore. Maybe that's where I'm missing the point. And maybe that's where Web three isn't. Is it so fast and so iterative that you have an artist, it finds this audience, they do the tracks and they're gone. Because the trouble with NFTs and web3 is, as you said earlier, monster Cat.
01:30:03.774 - 01:30:33.394, Speaker D: It's that every five minutes something's changed. Maybe we've stumbled across the perfect tool. And because of the way it's going, ten new things have come. And the ideal thing that might work for everyone is old fashioned. And because it's old, and because it's yesterday, no one gives a shit about it anymore. And I worry that it might take away those, I don't know, those genius points of serendipity that come. And because they just touch a point in our kazeitgeist.
01:30:33.394 - 01:31:03.886, Speaker D: Because with this space, it's not necessarily because something is worthy and soul touching. It's just because it's new. There's going to be a new platform for music every five minutes, and one of those is going to be the right one. But because it's now five minutes old, no one's going to give a shit. And that's kind of a little worry. I don't know how you guys think about that. I guess I'm being a devil's advocate and a negative Nelly, but I worry that it's going to push out some real creative unites that might be worthy just because it's not new.
01:31:04.068 - 01:31:04.682, Speaker E: Simon?
01:31:04.746 - 01:31:31.660, Speaker F: I think it's a really valid point. Again, with my thesis that web two and web3 will continue to exist. I think we'll still have the hit artists will occur on a mass scale, but maybe the projects that they do in web3 will become historical. And I think that's fine. There's been a real trend for historical NFTs, which is crazy because we're saying historical is like, what, three years old at this point.
01:31:32.670 - 01:31:34.746, Speaker B: It's so ridiculous how fast it goes.
01:31:34.848 - 01:31:47.374, Speaker F: Yeah, this is ancient. So sometimes there's appreciation for something. I'm curious to see. Are people going to appreciate the 2020 NFT someday? And they could say, well, 2020 was a big year.
01:31:47.492 - 01:32:03.106, Speaker D: No, I mean, hands up is full of NFTs that they know they're never going to sell, they wish they hadn't bought. And they're just like, look at them thinking what a waste of time and money that is.
01:32:03.208 - 01:32:13.240, Speaker F: You haven't learned about tax last harvesting yet. Then all of mine that I thought were dead, those have all been harvested long before now.
01:32:14.170 - 01:32:34.670, Speaker B: Listen, I want to talk about something fun. I want to talk about synths. Verite, what's your feeling on synths? Because synths were this technology that threatened to disrupt everything and upend everything and completely put all pure instrumentalists out of business. But they didn't. Do you use them in your songwriting?
01:32:35.570 - 01:32:54.290, Speaker A: Yeah. I love that. I feel like press and media are so manipulated for clickbait and have been forever where it's just like, this thing is going to come and ruin everything that you've ever known and loved.
01:32:55.430 - 01:33:00.600, Speaker B: Mike is going to do that. You know that, right? Look at that face. It's coming for everything.
01:33:01.770 - 01:33:15.946, Speaker A: But it was the same with streaming. Streaming is here to ruin the music industry and all of this. And it's just like, technological advances are cool. I don't know how to fully use this profit. Sitting next to me.
01:33:16.048 - 01:33:25.006, Speaker B: You have a profit. Show it. What? Show it. Show it. Show your money. If you're a music nerd, it's a profit as well.
01:33:25.108 - 01:33:25.614, Speaker D: Old school.
01:33:25.652 - 01:33:30.510, Speaker B: It's a profit. Six, there's a small amount of fapping going on amongst the music condescendi.
01:33:32.530 - 01:34:10.826, Speaker A: It's weird. It does weird things sometimes, but honest point, isn't it? That's half the point. Not knowing what you're doing fully and just navigating and crafting a sound and then being like, well, this is unique. And then tracking it in, cutting it up. And so I think that, again, it's like everything is going to be utilized by different people who want to create the art that they want to create. But guitar music is always going to be there. And if anything, I'm going back to more analog stuff as more hyperpop becomes popular, because that's the stuff that I want to make.
01:34:10.826 - 01:34:35.170, Speaker A: And so it's just like, nothing is going to come and upend everything. Web three isn't going to come and upend the music industry as we know it, but it's going to be an additional tool set for people and hopefully it's going to allow us to create some better systems and put pressures on the systems that exist that are shitty and unfair to artists.
01:34:36.950 - 01:34:38.114, Speaker B: That's fair.
01:34:38.312 - 01:35:17.362, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess because there's a comment that says, simon, be positive. And I know I always come across as, oh, everything's shit, but generally I am into it. I guess the analogy is that with the invention of word, not everyone has become a writer. With the invention of clip art, not everyone is a graphic designer. And I think that is just the worry. When wordpressors came out PCs 20 years ago, and everyone started doing clip art, and it's like, oh, all the graphic designers are out of a job. But what happened is everyone realized that all their comic sands fucking bullshit posters they were doing looked shit and the real artists came back again.
01:35:17.362 - 01:35:19.646, Speaker D: I guess we're talking about taste.
01:35:19.758 - 01:35:21.140, Speaker B: We're talking about taste here.
01:35:22.070 - 01:35:23.762, Speaker C: You have taste makers, sales.
01:35:23.896 - 01:35:53.926, Speaker D: Yeah, but that's the thing. It does drive sales. Again, I keep saying dichotomy, but there's two types of musical artists. One that does it because they have to, and one that does it because, oh, they can make a quick buck and there is a difference and the authenticity of that will shine through. So there will be the superstars of web3 and whether the music, I don't know if people have talked about it, the traditional format of a song being intro, verse, bridge, chorus, three minutes, done. Maybe that's got to change. I listen to a lot of stuff on TikTok.
01:35:53.926 - 01:36:09.570, Speaker D: I am a huge TikTok er, and I can listen to a song on a 32nd loop 40 times. So I just want to hear the chorus, you know what I mean? So maybe that's a web3 thing. Instead of releasing three minute songs, you got an intro and you've got an hour long chorus loop because you just love the fucking chorus.
01:36:10.790 - 01:36:23.270, Speaker B: You need to go back and listen to some Genesis, to some. Yes, to some masturbatory guitar solos that last eight or nine minutes. I'm down with that. Verita doesn't know this, but this is a key tar.
01:36:23.690 - 01:36:25.106, Speaker F: You've got a key tar?
01:36:25.218 - 01:36:27.106, Speaker B: Yes, I've got a key tar.
01:36:27.218 - 01:36:28.018, Speaker F: Can you play it?
01:36:28.044 - 01:36:33.766, Speaker B: I am the ultimate douchebag. It's a Roland ax synth.
01:36:33.878 - 01:36:35.862, Speaker D: Robin is a classically trained musician.
01:36:35.926 - 01:36:44.138, Speaker B: I am a classically trained musician. Bandcamp geek motherfucker. Yes. This is why I convened this panel, because I'm such a nerd.
01:36:44.234 - 01:36:58.098, Speaker D: Perfect. I used to test him in our studio. I used to play three random notes on a guitar and say what? I'd be like, yo, all right then, Robin, what's this? And he'd know instantly what they are.
01:36:58.264 - 01:37:00.820, Speaker B: It bugs my kids. No end. It bugs me.
01:37:01.830 - 01:37:02.722, Speaker D: Give us a.
01:37:02.856 - 01:37:19.002, Speaker B: No, no, we did that earlier. We'll do it later at the end of the stream. But yes, the Roland ax synth, it's literally, it's the most douchebaggy instrument in the world. I love it. I'm going to get a piano key necktie, massive shoulder pad. I'm going live in Miami. It's to going be great.
01:37:19.002 - 01:37:28.442, Speaker B: Very say, big question for you. Your first NFT sale. Tell me about there. What did it feel like? I believe Zora. Am I right?
01:37:28.576 - 01:37:29.270, Speaker A: Zora?
01:37:29.350 - 01:37:31.630, Speaker B: Zora. Og.
01:37:32.850 - 01:37:43.554, Speaker A: So I got my invite to Zora back in the day when you had to be invited in February of 21 February 2021.
01:37:43.592 - 01:37:47.538, Speaker B: One whole year ago, everybody.
01:37:47.704 - 01:38:09.778, Speaker A: One whole year ago. And I'm fuzzy. Whatever. Basically, I had gotten the invite. I knew I wanted to experiment, and I just said, fuck it, let's try it again. You learn by doing, and everything gets to be intimidating. But also, I was just like, I'm just going to do it.
01:38:09.778 - 01:38:33.694, Speaker A: And so I spent all night making this motion graphic of the COVID It's very simple. It's very simple. It took so long to export, though. I don't know why. And of the first song that I had ever released, because I was just like, oh, the first NFT. The first song I released under this project. And I just put it up and I tweeted about it and it was really that simple.
01:38:33.694 - 01:39:12.400, Speaker A: And it got like ten bids. I sold it for one E. Right? Which for me at the time, it was like, what, $1,800? And I was just like, that's weird, right? It's weird that someone would pay $1,800 for something that they can listen to for free. So it kind of piqued my interest in the whole thing. And I was just like, all right, cool, let's play with this psychology, because I view it all as like, psychology. Like, what causes someone to want to pay that amount? What's the value proposition there for them? And everything is kind of spawned from that one.
01:39:12.770 - 01:39:38.680, Speaker B: Yeah. It's interesting because Mike and I hang around with the people that would have bought it, and I think it's safe to say are genuine collectors. And it's a group of people who value the art for the art itself and have quite long term time horizons. Mike, you put together a group of these people because you're all kind of interested in the same things. Why did you do that? What inspired you to kind of bring all of that energy and intel together?
01:39:42.810 - 01:40:18.260, Speaker F: I think the reality is whenever people want to grow and build within a new industry, they want to grow with like minded people and they want to learn from like minded people. And they never want to be the smartest person in the room. As you know, it's never been monetized. It's never been like a paid entry or anything. It's just let's get great people building great things and put them in a place where they can hopefully build together. So I was excited and I knew that I wasn't going to be able to do this journey on my own. So let's bring all the best people we could find together and, I don't know, let's have a fucking big ass party together.
01:40:18.260 - 01:40:20.786, Speaker F: That's all it really.
01:40:20.968 - 01:40:51.750, Speaker B: And it sounds like some kind of illuminati group. But the reason I like that conversation is because people genuinely talk about the work. And it's not when pamp, when moon and when obviously that conversation happens as well. Vector, you've sold art. You've been part of the pranks, the NFT boxes as well. How do you see your progression moving as you put more work out there and start kind of building on what we're doing with this podcast? Because this show, man, this is your launch pad.
01:40:51.910 - 01:40:53.034, Speaker C: Wow. Bring it, son.
01:40:53.072 - 01:40:54.346, Speaker B: Bring it, bring it, son.
01:40:54.448 - 01:40:58.400, Speaker C: Thank you for the launch pad and the awesome theme music that comes with it as well.
01:40:59.090 - 01:41:02.014, Speaker B: I'm trying to get the key tar to work on the slide while we're talking.
01:41:02.132 - 01:41:02.926, Speaker C: Go on, do it.
01:41:02.948 - 01:41:07.186, Speaker B: We need some synths. I'll figure it out. Some elastic synthy. Synthy synths to go with you.
01:41:07.288 - 01:41:33.740, Speaker C: Something emotional. But it's like what you said, though. I think you can have a rough strategy in this game, but you have to be. What was your word for it? Hyper present. It's very much about taking every day because things move so fast. You can try and have a strategy about what you want to do, but in the space of weeks or months or days, whole market could. Wow, that's right in my ear hole, the whole market.
01:41:34.110 - 01:41:38.780, Speaker B: Give me an audience engineer. I apologize, everyone. Just freeballing him.
01:41:39.870 - 01:42:27.162, Speaker C: It can change. So you kind of got to just be really fluid. I think that's actually one of the kind of artist skills on its own in that space and that's just moving with you're in this kind of ocean and you've kind of got to just take it as it comes. If there's a big wave or a little wave, or maybe you can anticipate those waves, but pretty much you're kind of out at sea and you need to figure it out. At least that's how I feel every day. And I like the reactive part of rolling with it and just kind of doing what I want as much as possible. And then hopefully trying to adapt that to the wider moves of what's happening within, like we said, all these parameters and ever changing weather that's within the ecosystem, the price of bitcoin, tanks, everything.
01:42:27.162 - 01:42:51.250, Speaker C: And then everyone thinks it's the end and it's over and then it's up 1% the next day and it's back on and all that kind of crazy macro stuff. But then also the trends or whatever of what things. It's kind of like just noise. It's like just trying to do what I want to do. And then hopefully at some time there's a right time of adapting that to what's happening in the outside environments.
01:42:52.630 - 01:43:04.760, Speaker B: Verite. You wrote a pretty interesting blog post about your experiences in the last year, specifically citing web3. Curious what you think web3 is and what it means to you.
01:43:06.890 - 01:44:07.594, Speaker A: I feel like partially web3 is kind of like a hyped up, easy to use term that it's just convenient for us all to point to. But I feel like for me, it's like I'm viewing it in two ways. One, of it's an engaged community of people who are forward thinking and have a desire to build structures that are better and more equitable than the previous structures or so those are the people I try to align with within that community. And two, it is everything that the blockchain, smart contracts, and all of the actual technology that allows us to build those systems and tools. I feel like sometimes web3 is just like this amorphous, like we're in web3. It's this completely new and different thing, and it's going to be so much better than that shitty web two. But I don't really view it that way.
01:44:07.594 - 01:44:30.302, Speaker A: I view it as like, great. I found a community that really understands the language that I speak and that I feel excited to build with. And I feel like someone said before, it's a yes. Culture. It's just like, yeah, let's try that. Yeah, let's do that, yeah, let's build that. Whereas we're coming from systems where it's like, no, you can't dm your audience, no, we're not going to show your posts to your fans.
01:44:30.302 - 01:44:46.520, Speaker A: No, we're not going to put that on a playlist. Right. And so I think that I try and keep the big, idealized web3 is the utopia picture out of my head because I don't necessarily think it's healthy or true.
01:44:47.450 - 01:44:50.780, Speaker B: Yeah. Mike, what's your take on web3? How do you view it?
01:44:51.150 - 01:45:29.030, Speaker F: Well, I like to what Verita was saying around the word. I'm comfortable to use the word the same way I'm comfortable to use the term EDM to cover all forms of electronic music. It isn't perfect by any means, but for the average person, the average person you're speaking to, it is digestible, it's understandable. And eventually, as they go through their journey, they start to understand what all the subgenres mean and they start to find their home. And I think the same thing will occur with Web three. That term won't be used anymore because it'll just be part of our everyday consumption in some capacity.
01:45:29.770 - 01:45:30.710, Speaker D: Alp.
01:45:31.450 - 01:45:35.142, Speaker B: Alp. He's just checked out. He's completely checked out.
01:45:35.196 - 01:45:39.074, Speaker F: He's taking a nap, he's swiping.
01:45:39.202 - 01:45:46.060, Speaker B: He's so exhausted from putting digital objects in there. Vect, what do you make of Web three? How do you view it?
01:45:47.870 - 01:46:25.846, Speaker C: I mean, it's more fun than web two. Didn't really like Web two, wasn't really into it. Seems like I was young at Web one. That felt exciting. It was similar to this in ways. Web one to me was about, I was spending a lot of time in Internet relay, chat rooms, Irc, I don't know if anyone else used to do those, but yeah, so you'd set up servers and I was doing like p to p distribution of music through Limewire. And, man, the old days, yeah, the old days, MP3 s, but that was like a way to share certain types of music that didn't have a platform then.
01:46:25.846 - 01:46:53.470, Speaker C: So, yeah, it was like trying to get certain things out there that I felt was niche and setting up platforms and websites for that and then setting up communities and forums like the chat rooms and servers. That was my experience with Web one. It felt like community building, figuring things out. There's no real rules. I was young and I was just like, there was no YouTube video. How to do this? Web two, I kind of just missed it. I was late to all the social media platforms.
01:46:53.470 - 01:47:33.038, Speaker C: There was just something I didn't resonate with about it. I don't know. Web three to me feels a bit more like Web one, but in a more advanced way. We've got more advanced tools. We're kind of back to maybe what the original vision of the Internet was, but we got a responsibility to kind of have good case studies and depending on how we use it. But yeah, I know it's become a buzzword and it's like what you're saying, it's become almost cliche, hype buzzwords to talk about, which is where the whole thing stigmatized. But in terms of just feeling and how I feel about it, I feel similar to web one.
01:47:33.038 - 01:47:34.720, Speaker C: I'm excited again.
01:47:35.410 - 01:48:00.214, Speaker B: Yeah. The funny thing is this space is sort of engineered and it's almost perfect for music in a way because it's memetic. The best kind of chat room expression that always gets me is like, shit slaps. If something slaps, you're like, oh yeah, I'm there, I'm there. I know what you mean. It just short circuits all the nonsense, all the crap. I think that's what music is really good at.
01:48:00.214 - 01:48:21.626, Speaker B: Something just gets you. It gets you, that's it. And it just sort of bypasses all that other bullshit. The moment you start talking about web3, you are opening up an avenue for people to attack you, basically. Dan Olson. Dan Olson, this canadian blogger, put out a two and a quarter hour film just shitting on NFTs. It's got like 3 million views now.
01:48:21.626 - 01:48:59.180, Speaker B: And you can see a lot of confirmation bias in the views, in the comments, everything else. And they say NFTs are shit, they're bad for the environment. They are just repeating a bad kind of paradigm from God knows when they're offering anything new. We are in a position where we are likely to be attacked on all sides by people who are skeptical, who see a lot of the noise and chatter as representative of what's going on here. But at the same time, I feel exactly the same way that you guys do, which is like, I've never had as much fun as I'm having right now, ever. I've been doing this a really long time and I could have just given up like five years ago. I was just done.
01:48:59.180 - 01:49:21.402, Speaker B: I was shooting commercials about vacuum cleaners. Think about that for a second. That were focus tested in Poland and Germany. I'm sorry, but in Germany it's a foot and hold the vacuum cleaners like this. So can we get a different shot, please, just to be. No, fuck off. We can't here's the storyboard.
01:49:21.402 - 01:49:44.466, Speaker B: You're done. You can't do that. I almost gave up whatever this is. I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm some weird digital creature, but I'm having so much fun. And I think if we can somehow communicate just that and disassociate it from all the other bullshit, which is like the web3, the NFTs, all that other stuff doesn't matter. It's like, go be weird.
01:49:44.466 - 01:50:06.750, Speaker B: Because in being weird, you'll be something that nobody else is and do something that nobody else could do. And I think that is a wholesome message. Wrapping it up in this other garbage just gets in the way. But I could be wrong here, and I am someone that spends a lot of time talking about this stuff, so I'm probably just oversaturated with the words that come out of my own mouth. But I don't know, Mike.
01:50:08.530 - 01:50:10.110, Speaker F: I don't know what the question was.
01:50:10.180 - 01:50:15.460, Speaker B: There was no question. Throwing you the ball, catch it, run with it, throw it to someone else, I don't care.
01:50:15.830 - 01:50:25.214, Speaker F: The other thing that's kind of catching my attention here is I have ADHD. It's obvious, but it's the jiggle on this mock.
01:50:25.342 - 01:50:26.306, Speaker D: I know it's the best.
01:50:26.328 - 01:50:27.460, Speaker B: It's fucked up, right?
01:50:27.990 - 01:50:33.110, Speaker F: I want to look at you while you're talking, but I don't know for you guys, if the studio is also.
01:50:33.180 - 01:50:35.000, Speaker E: It must be. It's also in the center.
01:50:35.930 - 01:50:42.474, Speaker F: I'm spending all my time just looking at that guy. It's amazing. Did you say you got a full body rig and everything coming soon?
01:50:42.512 - 01:50:54.190, Speaker B: No. Yeah, we're going to have like, an optical motion capture rig. It's kicking our asses so badly. All the things that I want to do. So basically, film production is really expensive. Very. Say you've made music videos.
01:50:54.190 - 01:51:38.982, Speaker B: You know what a pain in the butt it is setting up a shoot and getting something professional and nice that you actually feel is representative of you. I just like to make nice things, and I like shining nice things and making something that has a story and has a narrative and everything around it and that's got decent lighting, because in the world of content creators, you don't see that people just content out and go, I don't want to be that. I want to try and push what we're doing and just see where we can go. The only way I can do that is by turning this entire space that we have here into a holodeck. And the only way I can do that is by using unreal engine. And the only way I can do that is by learning unreal engine. And so I will see you in 18 months when I've sort of learned a little piece of it.
01:51:38.982 - 01:51:44.830, Speaker B: It is crazy, but, Verity, what door do you use? Just out of curiosity.
01:51:47.970 - 01:52:06.630, Speaker A: Before I answer that question, I spent the whole first half of being on here thinking studio and Robin were two different people. And then it clicked. I was just like, wow, they sound exactly the same. I woke up late today.
01:52:06.780 - 01:52:08.440, Speaker B: Welcome to the real world.
01:52:10.730 - 01:52:24.140, Speaker A: I'm in Ableton. I was using a cracked version of logic in college, but then when I started touring, I used Ableton and I had it and I had all the contacts, and so I already had it.
01:52:25.390 - 01:52:35.402, Speaker B: Tell me about your setup. Are you using a push controller? Are you doing live looping? How do you normally perform with your setup?
01:52:35.546 - 01:53:33.454, Speaker A: Well, live set is full band, and so basically we play as much live as possible and then we supplement with tracks, because I don't want to hire a seven piece band that is not sustainable for me right now. So that's really pretty simple. Drummer controls the tracks, and then my regular studio set up, it's like, I have the profit, I have an op one, I have a few cool pedals that I like fucking around with. I utilize samples, and then usually we'll go into the studio and sound replace whatever samples, because the idea of putting just splice samples in a final production makes me want to die. But I kind of am just utilizing what's around me and trying to be as creative as possible. I'm not really like a gearhead. I like having the things that I have and utilizing them as much as I possibly can.
01:53:33.652 - 01:53:52.150, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that the fun thing about Ableton is it's so simple to learn and get started with. And, like, you. Like, you take a sample, you never use it in its naked form, always do something with you. Do you watch any of Andrew Hung's, like, four producers flip a sample series?
01:53:52.570 - 01:54:07.180, Speaker A: No, I need to watch more. Usually I just sit and struggle, and that's my creative process. It's like I struggle until something clicks, but I have a deep desire to send me that. Please.
01:54:08.990 - 01:54:30.706, Speaker B: It's so good. So basically there's four producers. Andrew's one of them, and they get like a Jamie Liddell sample or something like that. And then the four producers will just go and do their thing. It's like, oh, my God. And they build the beats out of the sample, they build the pads, they build literally everything out of the sample. And it's like you've never, ever seen anything like.
01:54:30.706 - 01:55:11.546, Speaker B: It gives you such a deep appreciation of how far the digital tools have come for music production that, as Mike was saying, your ability to create your own image, to create this version of yourself, that sets your music producing and your djing abilities apart from everything else, it's insane. Like, I remember when DJs were like, you turned up with a set of decks and some records. Swannie, we've done this like a bag of vinyl that weighs 15 tons you carry around in your back. You're like, I'm a DJ. Hey. And then you're like this the whole night going, fuck. Trying to beat, match, fuck, and then rewinding like everyone handed the air shit.
01:55:11.546 - 01:55:34.870, Speaker B: Where's the beat? Where's the beat? Where's the beat? And then you got these digital tools and you could sample and you could loop. And I see DJ sets and I'm like, what? Sorcery? Witchcraft? What's going on here? Crazy times. But the stuff that's coming out is incredible. Mike, has electronic music eaten the world? Is there any place for hair metal anymore?
01:55:35.850 - 01:55:43.898, Speaker F: Electronic music is still, like one of the least consumed genres on the planet, unfortunately, by percentage. By percentage, what's the most.
01:55:43.984 - 01:55:48.060, Speaker B: Okay, stack geek, tell us. Is it country?
01:55:48.910 - 01:55:49.526, Speaker C: Kpop?
01:55:49.558 - 01:55:50.582, Speaker B: Isn't it fucking kpop?
01:55:50.646 - 01:56:00.750, Speaker F: I wouldn't know them off the top of my head. I'm sure somebody can find. There's definitely a pie chart out there, but I know it's under 10%. Electronic music is under ten.
01:56:00.820 - 01:56:02.526, Speaker B: It's mongolian throat singing, isn't it?
01:56:02.548 - 01:56:03.520, Speaker E: Oh, must be.
01:56:04.690 - 01:56:33.830, Speaker D: Well, if you look at kpop numbers, yeah, you might have people dropping. They dropped 5600 million. If you look at the highest rated song online, I think it was Gangham style. And I think now it's the Justin Bieber that. Senorita, I think that's about six or 7 billion views. And I worked it out. If you were to watch each of those views, it would take you 86,000 years to watch those views.
01:56:33.910 - 01:56:44.750, Speaker B: Simon doesn't have a girlfriend right now, which is why he does things like that. It's a sad story, everyone. He turned to acting to ease his troubles, but he was still just a YouTube math geek.
01:56:46.130 - 01:57:22.874, Speaker D: I like looking at numbers, but going back to what Victor Meldru said, I think the difference between Web one, two and three is if we clinch it to the analogy of a rave thing. Web one, concerts, you've heard a band on a radio, you go and see them at a concert. Web two, nightclubs, disc attacks shutting at 11:00 then all of a sudden you got entrepreneurial people that have found a warehouse, you got some guys with some decks. This is Web three. They just do a rave. You got your NFTs are the flyers, you got your music, NFTs are the tracks, you got your social media, which is the chill out room. And what powers it.
01:57:22.874 - 01:57:30.800, Speaker D: The ETH was ecstasy. I think what you need is a digital coin that gets you off your head. Then it'll all make sense.
01:57:32.610 - 01:57:36.160, Speaker B: The regulators will love that, trust me. Absolutely.
01:57:36.690 - 01:57:42.160, Speaker F: If there wasn't already, there's now little eat stamped pills that are going to be out in the market.
01:57:44.210 - 01:58:16.870, Speaker B: So true story. Web three actually originates with Gavin Wood, who's the founder of Polka Dot. And he wrote a blog article way back when, like 2015 or so, specifically in response to Snowden. And he said, we need a system that is about removing trust from governments and large organizations because it's been proven that we simply cannot trust them. And he coined the term web3. That's where Web three comes from. Web three is about removing the need for trust from organizations who have simply proven that they cannot be trusted.
01:58:16.870 - 01:58:54.066, Speaker B: Has nothing to do with ownership, it has nothing to do with blockchains, has nothing to do with any of that stuff. It's simply an idea about disintermediation. And bitcoin, of course, is the OG of disintermediated content and value transfer. But that really is what web3 is about. Of course, it has become this buzzword to connect retail insanity and FOMO to a thing that boomers don't like because it doesn't fit into their worldview. And that's why we have to be very careful when we use web3. And as someone that writes a lot of material about this space, I find that my vocabulary is incredibly limited.
01:58:54.066 - 01:59:14.382, Speaker B: It's crypto, it's blockchain, it's this and that. But vector was talking about Limewire. Back in the old days, we used to talk about MP3 s. MP3 s were this format where the music quality sucked, but you could transfer files across to one another and do peer to peer transfers. That was amazing. And we talked about MP3 s. MP3 s became a proxy for music.
01:59:14.382 - 01:59:53.354, Speaker B: MP3 s equals music. NFTs shouldn't equal art or shouldn't equal anything else. And I almost feel that NFTs are getting in the way of what actually is going on here, which is artists re empowering themselves in ways that they couldn't before, and that's enough. But suddenly it has to be all this other stuff and it has to be technology. But I think the conversation that we're having and the light that comes on in Verity's eyes when she talks about her prophet, she loves her prophet. That's amazing. And the ability to reach an audience, the ability to actually make a living, a real, genuine, honest living right now at least.
01:59:53.354 - 02:00:07.738, Speaker B: Anyway, that's interesting. But how long can it last, really? How long can it last? Are we just in a moment where this is like, well, it's hot now, but if you were there in the early days, great, well done. Good for you. How does that scale and sustain?
02:00:07.914 - 02:00:56.766, Speaker F: I think it can. Because when you look at the math of how many fans you could actually have, how many superfans you could actually be engaging with to sustain and support yourself in your development, we're not talking hundreds of thousands, millions of people. And if you're talking hundreds, if not thousands, that's sustainable. I look at my window right now and I see 100 times that amount at any given point in time. So I'm not saying that every NFT has to be worth $5,000 now, but if we can find these mechanisms to still create and connect with the audience and the collectors, then absolutely, I think this is sustainable. The word Nft, though, might not be sustainable. Maybe that's the thing that's gone.
02:00:56.948 - 02:01:20.360, Speaker D: Yeah, well, it's already happened. Look at Patreon. You look at how many people digest podcasts. Podcasts are huge and a lot of them are driven by Patreon. And some of them been going, I listen to a lot of podcasts and they're on their 15th year anniversary, you know what I mean? And they're driven by Patreon and it does give them a sustainable income. So, yeah, it's proven that it's happened.
02:01:20.890 - 02:01:33.658, Speaker B: Well, you know what's just happened. The grand turtleneck has appeared. The Cooper the trooper, the maximum scooper. He's here. Welcome, everyone. The lord of the dows. He's here.
02:01:33.658 - 02:01:36.554, Speaker B: Cooper, trooper, how are you doing?
02:01:36.592 - 02:01:39.802, Speaker E: Wonderful, man. It's really good to see you and good to see everyone else here this morning.
02:01:39.936 - 02:01:43.098, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you know the panel? Do you know who's here on with us?
02:01:43.264 - 02:01:47.822, Speaker E: I know most of the faces. There's a couple of new ones, though, so I would love to get full context and everything.
02:01:47.956 - 02:02:06.662, Speaker B: Okay. So, Swannie, you will know from the rap episode of the Defiant that we did. He was my co conspirator. Vettemel, drew, Nft artist, also jungleist, Dj vj, just an all round good human. Also from the. So, you know, we're representing here and then this studio guy. I have no idea who that is.
02:02:06.662 - 02:02:32.700, Speaker B: Some idiot. Kupitelli is a former contributor to the Defiant, but also someone who's just been balls deep in Daos, balls deep in music and social tokens, and has been a key member of the audience team. Just someone that knows this space inside and out. I'd love to get your thoughts on where music NFTs are at right now. How you sing it.
02:02:33.150 - 02:03:05.910, Speaker E: It's going really well. I mean, I want to be conscious too. Darlington, I know we're just seeing each other in passing here, but it's so amazing to see kind of the progress that's happened the last couple of months around music nfts and it going from really just celebrities dropping audiovisual NFTs to independent artists making a living on the back of this technology. And so there's now this really big wave around on chain music nfts directly uploading the audio file and allowing fans to collect music. I think it's such a powerful trend and there's so many new platforms and protocols that are being built to support this that I could talk about it forever, but I'm excited to get into it in this episode.
02:03:06.410 - 02:03:28.640, Speaker B: So there's a whole bunch of new tools being created here. How do we use them? So let's say Verity releases some stems of a song, or does a music pack or an NFT. How can I then use this? What are the implications for usage? What are the license implications? How do I go about turning this into something that I can use in the context that I want to use it in?
02:03:29.330 - 02:03:48.770, Speaker E: I think it's a spectrum. I think in its simplest form, you're just collecting a version of a song that you really like in the same way that we collect vinyl or the same way that we collected Pokemon cards. It's no different with music. Now you have a really rare version of a song. It doesn't give you any ownership rights or royalties. You're basically just collecting something that you like. And in the events that that song performs well, there's a high likelihood it'll perform well in parallel.
02:03:48.770 - 02:04:14.720, Speaker E: I think on the other side of the spectrum we will start to see more ownership rights associated with these tracks and in the same way that certain PFP projects are having creative commons or the ability to go and license them. I think over time songs that exist on chain may also have the ability to be monetized and directly distributed by their owners. But for the earliest stages today, I see it as a fun way to collect the songs that you love, support the artists that you love, build a relationship. And I think that's powerful enough to get us further along the way.
02:04:15.090 - 02:04:32.020, Speaker B: Verite, you have Cooper here. Cooper understands Daos better than pretty much anybody else. Do you have questions to him about how you might, for instance, do a verite Dao? How you might have a community that's built around decentralized ownership of some piece of you in some form?
02:04:32.390 - 02:04:55.290, Speaker A: I feel like Cooper and I have spent many hours talking about a lot of this stuff. I feel like the Dow thing. I feel like I am slightly skeptical of only creator dows. Right. Dows in general. Right. You have friends with benefits and collector dows.
02:04:55.290 - 02:05:38.318, Speaker A: But I feel like creator dows specifically. I am very patiently seeing the landscape of everything, mostly because I'm so on the ground with my fans and they're so not engaged. And I've worked really hard to have full autonomy over myself and my work. And so I worry about the implications of people buying into verite and then having a stake in verite and then having a say in. Right. And so I'm watching those. But in terms of dows proper, it's like now I'm in friends with benefits, but now I'm going to be part of another dow.
02:05:38.318 - 02:06:00.574, Speaker A: And I'm like, oh, I'm actually buying into this and going to be a part of this community. And to me, as an antisocial human being, I feel like what Cooper's built and what all of these dows have built, I'm excited to dip my toe in and see what it's like to participate in an ecosystem like that.
02:06:00.772 - 02:06:17.362, Speaker B: Well, I think the key word is participate. There. Dows are notorious for low participation rates. I think it's fair to say governance proposals generally get a very, very low turnout. Kubi, over the last 18 months or so, have you seen that improve? Have you seen engagement improve? What have been the learnings from the last 18 months or so?
02:06:17.496 - 02:06:51.598, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, people want to participate in social clubs. Historically, when we think of governance, we think of D five protocols, financial primitives, things that are very difficult to grasp. But for these creative dows, people are much more engaged and entertained by the decisions that are happening. And so I think there is a clear difference between governance of creative decisions, which is something that gets extremely difficult. And I actually don't recommend that a lot of creators give to their fans and governance over a shared pool of funds. And so if you're selling music nfts, you have secondary sales and it's going back into a treasury. I think it's very different to allow fans to vote on what to do with those funds than it is to try and get them involved in the creative process.
02:06:51.598 - 02:07:24.170, Speaker E: Who to have on a song, when to use a kick drum, when to use a specific audio sample. I think the reason why a lot of these creator dows are possible in the first place is because that creator is so prominently educated in their craft that they're able to output really high quality content. And so I think across the board, just giving people a way to participate together, have a deeper sense of ownership and a relationship with a creator gets you kind of through the door. And then I think over the next year or two, we're all going to experiment on how do you meaningfully engage those fans and make them feel like this is not just sort of a gimmick to get them into web3, but that they do actually have a sense of purpose and a voice in these communities.
02:07:24.830 - 02:07:42.654, Speaker B: Yeah, that's interesting. We first started talking about social tokens. Have those gone away now? Is there still space for a social token in the world? I was always a little bit skeptical about them, to be honest.
02:07:42.852 - 02:07:45.440, Speaker D: Before you jump in, I've got to go. Love you all.
02:07:46.370 - 02:07:48.000, Speaker B: I don't love you. I'm sorry.
02:07:48.610 - 02:07:55.746, Speaker F: I'm going to take that one too. I'm ten minutes late for a meeting. Robin, thank you so much for hosting me today. This has been a lot of fun. I enjoyed the first hour of just being.
02:07:55.848 - 02:07:59.110, Speaker B: Just listening, being a wolfly. Yeah, thanks for coming, man.
02:07:59.180 - 02:07:59.526, Speaker D: Thank you.
02:07:59.548 - 02:08:01.750, Speaker B: We'll continue. Bye bye. Thanks, bye.
02:08:02.890 - 02:08:32.186, Speaker E: Yeah, I'll finish up that thought quick. And then Robin, if we are over time or anything, please let me know. Basically, NFTs have replaced the vast majority of what social tokens were meant to know. If you talk about token gated access, being able to get into a private community, I think NFTs have become a lot more digestible for people going on Opensea and buying one. NFT, I think is a little bit easier to grasp than going on uniswap and buying a fixed quantity of a social token. With that being said, I don't think that social tokens are out of the mix. I actually see them as more of a maturity state for these communities.
02:08:32.186 - 02:09:12.800, Speaker E: If you start with NFTs, you start with selling music nfts and you're generating sales for a treasury. I think over time as it becomes sustainable and there's actually something worth governing, social tokens are a way to take a holistic bet on everything happening in that ecosystem. NFTs are great for specific one off instances, let's say collecting one individual song, let's say accessing a discord. But I think that there is an umbrella effect that you get with tokens that you can't quite get with NFTs just yet. And so what I see happening is kind of this best of both worlds approach. You'll start out with an NFT, you'll start building a treasury, and then once you get your community to a point of being fully sustainable, then you'll use a governance token to be able to dictate control of those funds and to compensate contributors for their time and energy.
02:09:13.730 - 02:09:49.240, Speaker B: It all sounds so clean and business like. And there's always a bit of me that's just like it's the Rolling Stones just going into a studio for like two months and taking tons of drugs and just stuff happening. Have we lost that weird kind of moment where you can just go and isolate and be creative? Is there an opportunity to unplug? I don't know. Everything feels like it's just a bunch of mechanics to enable something that sort of gets in the way of the thing that really matters. Am I wrong?
02:09:49.850 - 02:10:21.758, Speaker E: I don't think you're wrong. I think for the upper spectrum of successful creator dows, you're treating it as a business now, and in the same way that businesses need to have a very high bar of operations. I think the same things are going to happen with these creator economies. For a lot of these artists, they're no longer just only the creator, they're actually a CEO, and they're assembling a team around them. And with them, I think, comes a higher degree of operations and a higher degree of standards associated with outputting content. And so I think in the early stages it's still the Wild west. There's people just uploading stuff to catalog, there's people just dropping on sound, uploading a track to Zora mint songs.
02:10:21.758 - 02:11:09.330, Speaker E: And so in the early stages, if you're a fan, you can come and find the outputs of those crazy vendor nights of just completely uploading a song out of the blue. And I would say the design space that's more interesting about web3 music is this whole process of submit a song for distributor three weeks in advance, hope that it gets put on a playlist, do a bunch of rollout content, do a bunch of Twitter spaces to hype up a song, and then after 12 hours move on to the next one. I think that's kind of being replaced by web3, allowing artists to use it as a true canvas. I think long form audio is going to do a lot better in web3. I think artists are going to have a lot more confidence that they don't need to really super over market every one of their tracks that comes out. You can release songs and have them sit on chain and allow fans to come back and discover them at a later date. So even today, if you go on catalog and you just scroll for 30 minutes, you're going to find some incredible work.
02:11:09.330 - 02:11:22.630, Speaker E: Chances of the artist isn't on their Instagram or Twitter promoting it every single day. But if you take the time to consume music in the way that most music fans do, I think there's a lot of amazing opportunities to collect really valuable work really early in these artist careers.
02:11:23.210 - 02:11:38.426, Speaker B: Verity, is that your experience of it? Are you starting to reshape the way that you think about writing songs? Because I guess you've probably had this. It has to be three minutes and has to have two choruses, two verses, and you're in and out. Are you rethinking now?
02:11:38.528 - 02:12:18.470, Speaker A: I've always done what I want, right, to my own benefit and detriment. Right. I think from my perspective, and I think I said this before, all of this just expands what I believe could be possible. Right? And so no longer, I think, is there a pressure to conform to what is going to algorithmically work? It's more. So I'm just more confident in doing whatever I want and recognizing that I'm on less of a lonely island doing whatever I want. Right. Because now there are finally a bunch of people recognizing that we can do whatever the fuck we want.
02:12:18.470 - 02:12:19.158, Speaker A: Right?
02:12:19.324 - 02:12:29.754, Speaker B: Okay, just before you go on, because you say that you're no longer under pressure. Where was that pressure coming from then? There is a financial pressure. There has to be as well.
02:12:29.872 - 02:13:13.062, Speaker A: It all comes from me. Right? I'm highly, highly ambitious. And so at the end of the day, it's like I could be satisfied with where I'm at, but I'm relentlessly in pursuit of something bigger and greater and more sustainable for myself and for others. And so from my perspective, it's like I could be satisfied with a lot of different iterations of my career. But I just always want to push. I want to push on the business side, I want full creative autonomy, and I want to push on the artistic side. And I think that all of this allows for that freedom and the reemergence and popularization of patronage.
02:13:13.062 - 02:13:37.282, Speaker A: That isn't Patreon. I know Patreon exists. It's just not my flavor. Right. But this feels like a different and better mechanism for patronage. And then it's my job as a creator. If I'm not going to dive into creator, dows is how do I continue to provide sustained value for collectors and create a community? And I view that in a really long game.
02:13:37.282 - 02:13:49.378, Speaker A: Right. Unless I die. Sorry, that's dark. I'm going to be here for a long time, continuing to build. And so I'm just taking a very patient approach.
02:13:49.554 - 02:14:18.586, Speaker B: Okay, so you use the crucial word there. Build. Not consume, not exploit, but build. And I think that is generally the conversations I get into with people. There is this gray area, and that represents opportunity. And then you go and plant a flag there and go, well, if it works, if it doesn't work, it doesn't really matter. Whereas in the metrics driven world of Instagram, everything else, you are either a success or a failure.
02:14:18.586 - 02:14:28.820, Speaker B: There is no in between. Do you define yourself by the numbers that you have on Instagram or on Twitter? Do they play into your thinking? Every.
02:14:31.990 - 02:15:11.454, Speaker A: Define. I guess myself is a hard. I define my life by, am I able to do the things that I want to do in the way that I want to do them? And for me, freedom and autonomy has always been the goal since I was a kid. Right. I want to be able to move and exist how I want to move and exist in the world. And I choose to do that through music because it's like playing 3D chess all of the time, both creatively and in the business sense. And I like that game of 3d chess and I have become very good at it.
02:15:11.454 - 02:15:29.618, Speaker A: But I could also find that freedom and autonomy elsewhere. Right. But that's my ultimate goal and that's why I'm so. God, I hate the word passionate, but I'm so passionate about helping artists recognize that they can also have that freedom and autonomy of movement.
02:15:29.794 - 02:15:37.270, Speaker B: You can substitute the word passionate for a number of others, like zealous or moist. Moist. About helping artists.
02:15:38.090 - 02:15:42.150, Speaker A: Passionate and authentic are two words. I fucking hate them.
02:15:42.220 - 02:16:06.420, Speaker B: Just bullshit. It's just kind of the language. There's like this YouTuber thing where they go with that being said, YouTubers go, and with that being said, like and subscribe. Like, every time I say the word like and subscribe, I literally want to kill myself. There's this authenticity problem. Hence having a digital version of myself, because that's authentic, right?
02:16:07.430 - 02:16:13.310, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel like this conversation is, we're getting to know each other better and it's just going to get darker and darker.
02:16:13.470 - 02:16:21.210, Speaker B: No, I have many lights. I can make it very bright in here. That's not dark at all. What kind of conversation?
02:16:21.310 - 02:16:24.278, Speaker A: Five minutes. I'm just putting that blinking light.
02:16:24.364 - 02:16:38.746, Speaker B: I know, but I could talk to you for quite some time. But we don't have time, and you were late anyway. Cooper, what kind of conversations are you having with artists about this space? Because I know you've been advocating heavily for what we're building here.
02:16:38.928 - 02:17:03.374, Speaker E: Yeah. If you're an independent artist that's still building a career for themselves, just get started. Find one very light way to release a music NFt, get them off the ground, and think about how to parlay that in the future. So minting one song that someone can come and collect, I think that's a pretty loaded question. So that's really unpacking that. If it's a larger artist that already has a big following, think about building bespoke products and services to allow them to enter in a really meaningful way. They have a lot more to lose.
02:17:03.374 - 02:17:32.282, Speaker E: They can't just really go mint a song. Typically they're in a label deal. There's a lot more red tape around it. And so my job is basically to help connect them with the developer team to say, hey, maybe we have some NFTs floating out there from the nifty gateway days. Maybe we have a highly engaged discord community already. How do you basically onboard those fans into web3 into a really light manner where there's not too much capital being expended, but it feels actually practical and useful. And so I think right now we're in a phase where everyone knows about music, NFTs, everyone knows about web3 music.
02:17:32.282 - 02:17:54.286, Speaker E: It's the topic of every conversation. But how you choose to enter that, I think drastically varies across the board. And basically it comes down to this concept of ownership. I think Kelsey is such a great example of this because she owns all her own rights. She's been independent from day one. So she has this amazing opportunity to go and play around with all these platforms however she sees fit. The reality is most of the big artists that we know and love do not have that same privilege.
02:17:54.286 - 02:18:16.390, Speaker E: They're in a label deal. Those labels are not very receptive to trying new things, and so the design space becomes infinitely smaller. And so I'm excited for a world where labels are embracing web3. We're able to see them participate in these conversations in the same way they do about how we're releasing on Spotify. But for right now, it's basically if you're independent, you have a free slate. That's a huge advantage. Let's just get out there and make some noise.
02:18:16.390 - 02:18:29.760, Speaker E: And if you are a bigger artist that doesn't have that same freedom, let's find ways to poke around in web3 to show that you're active and engaged and over time, hopefully build a relationship with a label or with the service provider such that you can be taking advantage of all the platforms that exist today.
02:18:30.690 - 02:19:09.340, Speaker B: I think there's another key thing here, which is we have been accustomed to thinking that this is a zero sum game, and in web3, it's not that actually there are connections that can be made between different people. I love the way that fluffs, for instance, has music embedded into the DNA of that PFP project, which means anyone could come and be a participant and embed their music into NFTs. Have you thought about that at all, Verity, in terms of partnering up and making connections with other projects, or are you still kind of lone gunman, lone gun woman, kind of fighting the good mean?
02:19:09.970 - 02:19:52.922, Speaker A: I am a lone gun woman. That's just like ingrained in my personality. That being said, I'm starting to. Hopefully I have one collaboration coming out which is audio visual and physical that we've been working on for literally months, which is going to be my first official collaboration with a visual artist. And then we literally built a television that we're going to be able to airdrop new content on for the one of one NFT. So literally, you'll get a physical sculpture of this television that is the exact replica of the one that's in the NFT. And so things like that I'm really excited about.
02:19:52.922 - 02:20:15.920, Speaker A: And I would love to figure out a meaningful way to collaborate with other visual artists, with other devs and generative artists. But again, it's just like I'm always looking for the right thing and balancing that with finishing the record and working on other projects so the right things will slot into place in the right time.
02:20:16.370 - 02:20:41.770, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's probably the right thing. You can't really force anything in this space. That's the honest truth of it. But as long as you're active and present and available and contributing, that's probably the thing. I think that's what you represent the most. Cooper, you're there, you're present, you participate, and some things work out, some things don't, but you're there. And because of that, so many weird connections have shot up and appeared.
02:20:41.770 - 02:20:55.114, Speaker B: Kelsey, thank you for joining us. It's been an absolute pleasure having you on. I'm going to let you go now and let you write music or do whatever it is that you need to do today. But thank you so much for joining us and sharing your thoughts. It's been a real pleasure.
02:20:55.242 - 02:21:02.702, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you so much for having me. This has been a very wild conversation, but I'm happy to be a part of it.
02:21:02.756 - 02:21:04.800, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. That's how we do it.
02:21:05.810 - 02:21:06.800, Speaker E: Bye, guys.
02:21:07.350 - 02:21:11.390, Speaker B: We're going to continue with Cooper for a little bit longer. Thanks. Bye.
02:21:11.470 - 02:21:12.354, Speaker A: Have a good one.
02:21:12.472 - 02:21:26.998, Speaker B: Cheers. Bye. So listen, Cooper, let's talk audience. How is audience going? Because audience is really a challenger brand. We can put it that way. So how's things been going with audience and how's the pickup been?
02:21:27.164 - 02:21:56.074, Speaker E: It's been amazing. The monthly usage of audience has been going consistently irregardless of the performance of crypto. I think it's a really strong signal that it's an app that is now standing outside of crypto. It uses crypto under the hood, but it's not relying on it for its growth. And so that opportunity for artists to come and upload music to a web3 streaming platform and build community is really powerful. I think the key thing to highlight here is that audience today does not support the creation of music nfts. And so you're kind of seeing this parallel movement where audience is a standalone app is doing fantastic.
02:21:56.074 - 02:22:48.222, Speaker E: It's getting a lot of usage, but a lot of what's happening with independent artists and minting records is happening off platform. And so where audience fits into that is basically as an aggregator, an opportunity for you to be able to build a fan base online, to sign up and use crypto, quote unquote, with an email and password, and not have to have a wallet and do minting and all that kind of stuff and just stream really good music. The leaderboards on audience. Every week, the top five participants get audio tokens, which represents ownership in the platform. And if you go over to an artist's profile, you can see there's an ability to basically connect your wallet and either display your NFTs that you've collected or display the NFTs that you're selling. And I think that as sort of a distribution mechanism is very powerful. And what I'm starting to see over the next couple of months here is if you have an audience online and you want to take advantage of tools like airdrops, tools like distribution, audience can serve as this platform where it's kind of a bridge between web two and web3.
02:22:48.222 - 02:23:18.380, Speaker E: You don't have to have any web3 experience to get started. But if you are a savvy user who wants to go down that path. Maybe one day you'll wake up and your artist will have airdropped you an NFT into your audience wallet that you can then export to a metamask or a phantom wallet on Solana. And so TLDR is things are moving forward. I think I'm starting to realize that the bigger these projects get, the longer these things take because there really is so much at stake. But I just know behind the know, the team is absolutely fantastic. There's someone that I'll speak highly of any day of the week and I think it's an all around killer project.
02:23:19.710 - 02:23:29.710, Speaker B: Well, that's exciting to hear. Vector, have you been tempted to dig into audio streaming and putting your sets out on a platform like audios?
02:23:30.770 - 02:25:01.226, Speaker C: I haven't looked into it too much, but I feel it's like it is the bridge because I speak to a lot of producers, as I was saying, and they all say, how can we start with NFTs? And I've been sending them audience because I feel like it's the easiest thing to understand is in terms of they're looking for a platform, and audience feels like that platform that they'd understand in a previous way, they would have put out music before. But I mean, with the music stuff, I'm wondering what you think of this, really, because I feel it's like a perception shift that's needed in terms of how artists function, in terms of now. They can now raise financing and they can build audiences within the NFT ecosystem or within the web3 ecosystem. And then I wish we spoke to verity a bit more about this as well, but she's looked into the fractalized ownership and I think Blau did a fractionalized rights drop recently, which was quite interesting. But I'm just wondering from you, Cooper, how you see that shift happening from artists that I guess commonly maybe you have been seeking a record deal or following that model, which is like the most common model. But now obviously the independent artists were a big thing or a certain small trend that's been happening recently, just artists creating their own labels. And then the next step of that is things like audios and platforms, and then the next step of that is fractionalized rights.
02:25:01.226 - 02:25:23.760, Speaker C: But I'm just wondering how you see artists being able to navigate that both technically in terms of actionable steps, but then also how they think about that differently, because I think it is a thing they need to shift in terms of thinking to be able to adapt to. So I'm wondering what's a kind of idiot's guide how you'd approach it.
02:25:24.210 - 02:25:59.258, Speaker E: Yeah, I think these platforms will get easier over time to use. The reality is right now, web3 music is favoring those who are actually technically savvy. They know how to use a metamask. They've heard of a smart contract before. And so to really take advantage of a lot of the cool primitives that we all know and love, you do need to have an education level that's pretty high. I think something like Royal, the platform that Justin's building, is taking a big step in this direction because they're offering NFTs with inherent royalty rights that you can purchase with a credit card. I think that flow is so important to allow people to get in at a lower price point, because right now, across the board with NFTs and specifically with music, there's a pretty high barrier to entry financially.
02:25:59.258 - 02:26:42.598, Speaker E: I think that's great for artists in the sense that they're making a lot of money right now relative to what they see per stream on Spotify. But it doesn't always necessarily mean that they're being heard. And so I constantly hear artists talking about this struggle between I want to make money and I want to be heard. And it seems like right now, if you want to make money, there's less opportunity for you to sign with a label to do these things for distribution because you're keeping all of your rights, you get a larger share of the pie, but the ability to distribute that content globally and build new fans is directly correlated to the partners and the support services that you have underneath you. And so I think what will happen over time is fans will become part of that equation. Right now, if you think about an artist catalog, typically it's the artist, their manager, and a label drastically oversimplifying it. But I think that's kind of the major stakeholders.
02:26:42.598 - 02:27:03.380, Speaker E: I think moving forward, fans will start to own a portion of that pie, and as they start to increase their value, add some of those service provider stakes will come down to lower price points. And I think those fans will be better incentivized to help spread the content, which in turn will help to create some of these more global phenomenons, but without the need for a major, major label to be the one promoting it every step of the way.
02:27:05.430 - 02:27:07.926, Speaker B: Does that answer your question? Yeah.
02:27:08.028 - 02:27:19.586, Speaker C: And you feel like things like fractionalization and the way rights are distributed to buyers, that is a good route, or is that more kind of an advanced route and that's more experimental at this stage.
02:27:19.778 - 02:27:51.166, Speaker E: I'd say it's more experimental. Broadly, I think a platform like Royal is going to be the canvas for doing it. I think the reality is trying to give people assets that have ownership over web two rights is a little bit outdated because everything is going to move on chain. And so I think it's a phenomenal idea to be able to give someone royalty rights in Spotify and apple music performance. But these are web3 assets. There's going to be an entire new class of web3 royalties. I think that the secondary sales of a music NFT on openc is actually more valuable than having ownership rights of its streaming performance on Spotify.
02:27:51.166 - 02:28:36.650, Speaker E: And so right now, we're kind of in this weird, like 2.5 phase where, yes, when you're fractionalizing an asset, you're giving them master rights in the performance of a song on a Spotify or an Apple music. But I think over time, as we start to see streaming and royalties all happening on chain, that specific topic becomes more valuable. And I think that's when we start to see these systems really take know right now, if you buy a music NFT for an artist that you know and love, chances are they maybe have like a million monthly listeners, if we're being really lucky. And that in total is like, we'll call it $3,500. And so if you own a small sliver of that, you're seeing pennies on the dollar. But what we're seeing now is that if an NFT has ownership rights associated with it, it's typically trading at a premium because the concept of ownership is actually more powerful than the exact payout that you're getting from owning that asset.
02:28:36.650 - 02:28:56.886, Speaker E: And so I think we're going to see more of these marketplaces pop up more ways to ascribe ownership rights to these assets. What I'm really excited about is a day when we don't need to rely on an artist getting paid out through a distributor, bridging that money to web3 and then distributing it to their fans in a very trusted fashion. And instead, we can have a system where it's all happening autonomously through smart contracts in the first place.
02:28:57.068 - 02:29:20.430, Speaker C: Okay, so you're fully up for the shift towards that and you feel secondary market is like quite an important metric, then, in terms of the value that collectors have for spotting early artists and early trends. I guess the danger of that is always the speculator side and how that gets accelerated in this whole ecosystem, right?
02:29:20.580 - 02:30:01.078, Speaker B: Yeah, there's the whole information asymmetry problem in crypto and the salesman the salesman wins. And the danger is that an artist gets caught up in being connected to someone that's going to sell them or become that manager proxy, or someone that has the answer or the keys to the kingdom and knows how to understand this kind of thing. One of the interesting discussions I had recently was with a creative project that wanted to do an NFT. It's an actress. Fantastic, beautiful. Just such a great talent. And you knew that coming into this, the talent was the thing that needed their attention.
02:30:01.078 - 02:31:17.702, Speaker B: Not managing a community, not managing all of the stuff that comes with that, and dealing with people who might or might not have made money or taken a bet on them. And so what I was mindful of was, what's important here? Where should their attention be spent? And maybe it's not on understanding the difference between different ERC 20 token types. Maybe it's just in just spending time making the thing to begin with. And I realized, as I was saying, that I was like, well, actually you're asking the artist to spend time on that and then kind of delegate the other stuff to somebody else, and then suddenly you are a record label again. It's so difficult this, because what I want is for her to have enough time to do the thing that she does well, really well. And so where I ended up was, there's an existing NFT project that has really a lot in common, but it's very male orientated, and that actually she could add value as being a more female orientated and younger audience orientated arm of that existing project. And that felt like probably a more healthy way to do things.
02:31:17.702 - 02:31:54.190, Speaker B: But at the same time, you're basically doing the same model that we've had in web two. It's so tough because the rational thing to do is say, you know what? Leave the stuff that you don't understand how to do to people who understand how to do it. So the super entrepreneurs are the ones that can really make this work. And for everybody else, you kind of have to make a deal with the devil at some point. I struggle with it so much, I just don't know what the answer is. And I don't know how to advise people or give them decent advice in this. But I'm sure, Kubi, you've had many conversations like this.
02:31:54.190 - 02:32:02.974, Speaker B: Where are we just repeating the old models? And how do we renew and make something new that's better? Because I don't know. I don't know what the answer is here.
02:32:03.172 - 02:32:41.758, Speaker E: I don't think there is a right answer. I think the reality is that labels will eventually play the same roles that they play in web two today in web3, in the same way that they're able to help get you on a great playlist, on Spotify, there'll probably be a world where there's a web3 label who's the best at getting you on catalog, the best at getting you on sound, helping to distribute and promote your music. NFTs I think the reality is that a lot of artists right now are in a state of operating in a silo. They think that their artist brand is all that they can be working on. But as we've seen across the board, Web three is incredibly positive sum. If you're joining other dows and you're joining other communities, the likelihood of your own project succeeding is exponentially higher. And so a lot of the times now when an artist comes into web3, I tell them, don't worry about starting your own discord right away.
02:32:41.758 - 02:33:17.290, Speaker E: Don't worry about growing your own web3 native fan base. Just be active and ones that already exist. And I think a lot of the reason why Soundcloud ended up doing so well in 2012, 2014 is because there was this collective mentality. These artists were coming together, they were sharing their music with their fans, and they were cross pollinating in a really powerful way. And what I'm feeling now with the music NFT movement is a lot of energy around collaboration. Artists who share very little of the same music taste, they're in completely different genres, are becoming best friends now because they're both using web3. I think that's the signal to how early we are, and it shows that irregardless what type of music you're making.
02:33:17.290 - 02:33:34.622, Speaker E: There are communities to tap into across the board for every vein. And if you can become present in these conversations, there's a really high likelihood that you're going to sell, because collectors like myself are always going to favor artists who are web3 native over those who have had success in web two and are now choosing to tokenize their back catalog as a way to stay relevant.
02:33:34.766 - 02:34:27.220, Speaker B: Yeah, you have to respect the culture, and in order to understand the culture, you have to spend months in it, saturating in it, and really feeling it out. And it's not for everybody. So Tebow is saying, how do we find these communities? To be honest? It's not that you pull on a few threads. There are generally people who like to speak a lot and they'll say something, and I join this, do this, do that, do that, join this, and you'll follow them and sometimes they're right and sometimes they're wrong. But in the course of doing that, you find something else and find something else and find something else. But there is no kind of one group that has all the best people in it. There are people who are active in certain groups at certain times, but then you kind of connect with other people and inform your own super groups and you build your own biases that inform how you do things.
02:34:27.220 - 02:35:10.974, Speaker B: All of this has nothing to do with making music, has nothing to do with making films. This is entirely just rewiring the way you think about your own business of doing stuff and saying, if I'm in this for long enough, in six months, maybe twelve months, there's going to be a thing that I can do that people will actually be ready for. And you just got to say, give me twelve months of just laying the groundwork. If you've got a time horizon or the appetite for that. This space is incredible. If you don't, then go trade. Don't create, just go trade and you'll have much more fun because the creating part of be, you got to be in it.
02:35:10.974 - 02:35:14.586, Speaker B: You got to be in it for real Z's. Otherwise it's just going to eat you alive.
02:35:14.778 - 02:35:22.370, Speaker C: Yeah, you got to be in the trenches. You got to be shit. Posting on Twitter, you got to be coming on live streams and playing weird instruments.
02:35:22.790 - 02:35:29.106, Speaker B: We don't talk about Twitter vector. You saw the rules, the rules of engagement. We don't talk about Twitter. Really? Oh, no.
02:35:29.128 - 02:35:30.398, Speaker C: It's a bad word, is it?
02:35:30.504 - 02:35:51.340, Speaker B: No shit posting on Twitter. We don't talk about. But seriously? Yeah. And also there's a certain amount of hygiene in terms of just keep your nose clean, don't get caught up in bullshit, because it comes back. It comes feel. I feel like you want to say something, cooper, with dancing around the elephant, but it's fine. That's good.
02:35:51.340 - 02:36:02.974, Speaker B: Any last thoughts, any last advice for people? Because I know people, they feel like there's a golden goose here and that may not be necessarily the right way to look at it.
02:36:03.172 - 02:36:26.822, Speaker E: Yeah, I don't think it's the right way to look at it. I shared in the chat there, the music NFT landscape that I put together very recently. It just gives you a holistic look at everything that's on my radar relative to music nfts, in terms of where to find these communities. I'll call up a couple actionable ones. Songcamp is fantastic. This is a group of producers, artists and collaborators all entirely focused on web3. It meets every Monday at one PST and it's a fantastic free to join community.
02:36:26.822 - 02:37:01.198, Speaker E: If you're on more of the research side and you want to learn more about what's happening under the hood, there is an amazing community called Water and music that gives you governance tokens to contribute to reports on the state of music, NFTs and music in web3. Then the last one I'll call out is more of these chat groups that are just fun to be in. My friend Carmworld has a fantastic one called Wave World. It's a discord group. You can just go and talk about music and web3 and then more broadly, there are Twitter spaces happening basically every day. So sound Xyz has their drops typically at two PST. And what they'll do 30 minutes beforehand is have a little conversation with the artist dropping, give them a spotlight.
02:37:01.198 - 02:37:19.420, Speaker E: What's important to recognize there is not only is it good to have a conception of who's dropping on sound and what's their story, but you see recurring people in that audience a lot. This music NFT space is so small right now that if you're paying attention on a daily basis, you're going to start brushing shoulders with people very quickly. I think being active and present is the best thing that you can do in the world today.
02:37:20.030 - 02:38:17.014, Speaker B: So that advice right there is the best thing that I can kind of pick up from this entire conversation, which is there is no right or wrong version of web3 or NFTs because nobody knows. And we are both right and wrong all the time, every day, about everything. What is important, though, is that in the middle of all this crap, there are some really interesting, exciting people that you would not meet anywhere else, and you will never have the opportunity to meet and engage with and converse with. If that's your jam. If you really care about this shit, this space will find you as long as you have the resilience to stick with it, because that's just the way it works. Things just end up clustering and it's more about time on the ground, spending as much time as you can, just pulling on threads and not being kind of married to one idea or one specific thing. Like, Cooper is a Dow surfer.
02:38:17.014 - 02:38:46.430, Speaker B: He goes in all sorts of different places. But I know why you do that, because you're terrified that something might happen and you missed know. I know the way you think, and it's like this space is just too exciting to be missing out on stuff. And so those conversations, they end up at like three, four, or 05:00 a.m.. In the morning. That may not be for you, but if it is for you, then like Cooper said, super early. Like, I remember four years ago, you could go into a telegram chat and speak to CZ from binance.
02:38:46.430 - 02:39:06.870, Speaker B: Just have a chat with him. Those conversations are possible right now in music nfts, but they won't be in two years time. So now is the time to move and time to act and be a ladmouth. And like social media, Twitter discord, you can be as opinionated as you want. Nobody's going to hold you to it doesn't matter. Just go and be active. So that's big advice.
02:39:06.870 - 02:39:09.226, Speaker B: Vector. Am I right? Am I wrong?
02:39:09.408 - 02:39:30.158, Speaker C: No, it's completely about that. But that's the exciting bit. If you love that part of it, it can be draining. It's 24/7 it's the conversations on the discord and Twitter. But it's fun. Like when I started, all of a sudden, some of my heroes started following me and engaging with me, like DJs that I loved or people that I've looked up to for years. It was strange.
02:39:30.158 - 02:39:42.742, Speaker C: And obviously that period when Paris Hilton went around following everyone. So surreal, because it's so small now that these people are all accessible and they probably won't be in a year or so.
02:39:42.876 - 02:39:43.830, Speaker B: I know, right?
02:39:43.980 - 02:39:52.474, Speaker C: Yeah. The catchphrase, we're still early, does have some relevance in the fact that it is still small and it is still early.
02:39:52.512 - 02:39:53.100, Speaker B: And.
02:39:55.070 - 02:40:27.938, Speaker C: That'S what I loved at the first. A lot of these kind of really smart people all seem to be here. Just people that I've respected or looked up to for years, all of a sudden they're here. And that gave me the conviction to double down on it and only really focus on this stuff. Because although outside perception, some crazy world full of scams or whatever, but when you get inside and you look around you and you see who's next to you and who's engaging. A lot of smart people here, some of the smartest people, but also a.
02:40:27.944 - 02:40:45.014, Speaker B: Lot of idiots as well. Filtering out the idiots is quite hard. The weirdest thing I had last year of just casually, on a zoom chat with ICE cube. Fucking ICE cube, of all people. I'm like, yeah, Mr. Cube, whatever we were having a chat about NFTs. So surreal.
02:40:45.014 - 02:41:28.646, Speaker B: But that wouldn't have happened unless I just kind of been putting stuff out there. I think it's really important to put stuff out with no expectation and be really fucking generous. Generous with your time, generous with how you help people, but also generous in the sense that somebody might not have something that you need, and you might do them a favor and they might remember it a year later. But this idea of being generous, being helpful, a yes culture, paying it forward, it does come back, and it comes back in the weirdest ways. And if you put that out there, I'm pretty sure something good will come back. So rather than saying, I'm an artist and no one gets me, actually think more in terms of I am a great artist, no one's had a chance to discover me yet. So let's give them that chance.
02:41:28.646 - 02:41:32.700, Speaker B: And then you're totally free. Totally free.
02:41:34.110 - 02:41:38.202, Speaker C: Did you block ICE cube after he popped up? Was he one of the people that you were fading out?
02:41:38.336 - 02:41:51.280, Speaker B: Yeah, that guy. Seriously, what's his malfunction? Also the thing I just said, I'm going to print that on t shirts, mugs, cups. We're gonna do a motivational seminar, me and Cooper, how best to wear a turtleneck and.
02:41:56.530 - 02:42:01.438, Speaker C: Look. And I love your cat platform as well. I don't know where your cat is, but that's a good backdrop.
02:42:01.534 - 02:42:05.086, Speaker B: That is serious. What is it? What kind of cat have you got, Cooper?
02:42:05.278 - 02:42:06.402, Speaker E: The best cat in the world.
02:42:06.456 - 02:42:08.302, Speaker B: That's all british blue.
02:42:08.446 - 02:42:09.140, Speaker E: Yeah.
02:42:10.310 - 02:42:12.070, Speaker C: Where is it? Where's the cat?
02:42:12.140 - 02:42:14.358, Speaker B: Where's the cat? It's on his head. Can you not see?
02:42:14.524 - 02:42:16.550, Speaker E: Keep it on the tree. I see it over there.
02:42:16.620 - 02:42:17.222, Speaker C: Oh, I see.
02:42:17.276 - 02:42:33.934, Speaker B: Oh, there's like a blob. There's a blob. Listen, it's been a fantastic conversation. We've been two and a half hours of just God knows what else and musical flubs. But, Cooper, thanks so much for joining us. Always a pleasure. And vector, we'll see you next week for more of the same and we'll figure out what earth we're going to talk about.
02:42:33.934 - 02:42:41.290, Speaker B: But thanks, everyone, for joining the stream. We'll see you next time. This was the energy show. Peace out. Whoa.
