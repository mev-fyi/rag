00:00:00.250 - 00:00:22.974, Speaker A: We are actively investigating rumors of an exploit associated with OpenC related smart contracts. This appears to be a phishing attack originating outside of OpenC's website. This was OpenC finally admitting that there was something going on, 32 users, hundreds of nfts worth millions. Was it an exploit vulnerable code, or just a plain phishing attack?
00:00:23.092 - 00:00:33.926, Speaker B: That and the breaking story of Freddy Suisse, coming up in this Monday's quick take. But first, a message from our sponsors. Step Finance is the front page of Solana crypto moves fast, with hundreds of.

00:00:59.204 - 00:01:51.098, Speaker A: Openc why are we always talking about OpeNC, valued at $13.3 billion, generating huge revenues, pushing towards 400 million in January, most users of the marketplace have run up against some of its quirks, like listings not working, phantom bids, and seemingly daily outages. So this story really begins with the inactive listings issue, where unwary users could inadvertently trigger a sale for a low price. To fix this, the OpenSea team upgraded the listing smart contract and urged users to migrate their existing listings to the new contract. They also sent out an email to account holders. And that is where the trouble began. Users such as Nate Rivers reported NFTs mysteriously disappearing from their accounts, and given general skittishness around interacting with contracts and approving sites, panic spread migrate or not migrate are the contracts.
00:01:51.098 - 00:02:31.578, Speaker A: Safu Devon Finzer posted a thread declaring that this was not an OpenSea vulnerability, neither listing interacting with an OpenSea email, migrating nothing. So all evidence seems to point to a phishing attack using a fake opensea email, which tricked victims into signing a malicious payload. And it looks like the attacker even practiced the exploit before doing it. For realzies, Pexhield released a spreadsheet of the NFTs taken and who they were taken from. There's Azukis, doodles, clonexes, and a board ape with thekinggully ETH, the worst hit with 25 NFTs taken. Ouch. So users were phished and should have exercised more caution.
00:02:31.674 - 00:02:33.242, Speaker B: It wasn't Opensea's fault.
00:02:33.386 - 00:03:13.574, Speaker A: Or is it that simple? Nate Rivers published a series of tweets claiming never to have received a phishing email or even a migration email. And even stranger, the attacker sent some of those NFTs back with 50 ETH. And was user information leaked at any point? Now? It's like really hard to pin down what exactly happened here, and even harder to figure out what the best course of action for other users like you and me is. It appears the migration contracts are in fact safu. But if you want a quick recap on good metamask hygiene, do check out the video we made earlier in the year. And once again, we're just reminded how fragile all of this is. So please be careful.
00:03:13.574 - 00:03:14.698, Speaker A: And on the other side of the.
00:03:14.704 - 00:03:16.538, Speaker B: Great financial divide, a giant packet of.
00:03:16.544 - 00:04:16.670, Speaker A: Data on Credit Suisse was leaked to Frederick Obermeyer and Bastian Obermeyer, the reporters behind the leaks that led to the Panama and Paradise papers. Switzerland's banking secrecy law enforces heavy penalties on any third party that reveals or exploits secrets that originate in a swiss bank, which means that getting leaks on a swiss bank are very rare. Now, these leaks provide evidence that Credit Suisse has clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering and corruption, and some were even allowed to open bank accounts years after they've been convicted for serious financial crimes. And just think about everything that this space is accused of and see it reflected back here in such an August banking institutional's credit suite. I believe that swiss banking secrecy laws are immoral, the whistleblower said in a statement. The pretext of protecting financial privacy is merely a fig leaf covering the shameful role of swiss banks as collaborators of tax evaders. Again, think about the language here.
00:04:16.670 - 00:04:38.086, Speaker A: They could be talking about a crypto company. So Credit Suisse responded to the allegations with a reasonably strongly worded statement, claiming the matters presented are predominantly historical and that the relevant issues have already been addressed. Make of that what you will. So that's it for today. Do stay safe out there. Get subscribed for more comforting English voiceness from yours truly. We're here all week.
00:04:38.086 - 00:04:38.820, Speaker A: Peace out.
