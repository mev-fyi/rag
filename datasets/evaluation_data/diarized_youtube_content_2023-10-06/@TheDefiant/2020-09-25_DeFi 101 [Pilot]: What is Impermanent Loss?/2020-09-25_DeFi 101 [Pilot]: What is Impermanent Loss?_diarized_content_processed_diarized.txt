00:00:00.170 - 00:00:51.200, Speaker A: When you lose something, it's lost, right? But what if it isn't? What if it's impermanent? This important defi concept can feel like a bit of a head scratcher, but it really needn't. Let's dig in. Automated market makers, or amms, are crucial infrastructure for decentralized exchanges and rely on users providing liquidity so that trades can take place. Now, liquidity just means making sure there's enough supply to satisfy demand. When you're living in a centralized world, then that's provided by a trusted party, like a bank. But when you live in a decentralized world, then you have to find other ways to create liquidity by incentivizing users to act as LPs or liquidity providers. Thank you.
00:00:51.200 - 00:01:32.090, Speaker A: Now, operating as an LP can be highly profitable, but this is crypto we're dealing with. Yeah, highly volatile assets which can rise or fall in value substantially in a very short period of time. And that means that amms run the risk of underperforming a basic buy and hold strategy. In other words, you'd be better off just holding the asset and doing nothing. And that is when impermanent loss happens. When the price of a token inside an amm diverges in any direction. The greater the divergence, the greater the impermanent loss.
00:01:32.090 - 00:02:14.626, Speaker A: As long as the relative prices of tokens in the MM return to their original state, the loss disappears and you earn 100% of the trading fees, which is why it's called impermanent. But more often than not, impermanent loss becomes permanent and you end up with negative returns. That beautiful liquidity provided just disappears down the drain or into the mouth of this handsome young fellow here. You can stop now. Thank you. Why this happens is all down to arbitrages and their effect on amm pricing, but we'll cover that in a separate video. So for now, be sure and factor in impermanent loss when picking an amm.
00:02:14.626 - 00:02:36.700, Speaker A: To provide liquidity to sometimes just holding an asset is the best strategy. You've been watching D 5101.
