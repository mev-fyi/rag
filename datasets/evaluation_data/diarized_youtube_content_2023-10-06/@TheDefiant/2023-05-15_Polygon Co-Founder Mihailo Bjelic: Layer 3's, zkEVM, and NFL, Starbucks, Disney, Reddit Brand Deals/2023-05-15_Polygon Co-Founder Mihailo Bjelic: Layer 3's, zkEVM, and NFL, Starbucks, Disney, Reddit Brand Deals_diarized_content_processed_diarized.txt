00:00:04.650 - 00:00:35.254, Speaker A: I'm Kate Klein, and this is the Defiant. This week's episode stars Mahilo, co founder of Polygon. We get into the juicy details behind what went on with the ZKE EVM launch a few months back. Mahilo's thesis on layer threes, how Polygon secured brand deals with the NFL star Bucks and others, and what he's most excited about in 2023. But first, Mahilo shares what he's been focused on at Polygon currently and since.
00:00:35.292 - 00:00:48.154, Speaker B: The very beginning, I mainly focus on the tech side of things. So I guess protocol design, tech strategy mainly. In addition to that, I guess some strategic decisions, special ops here and there, but mainly tech side of things.
00:00:48.272 - 00:01:03.134, Speaker A: Amazing. And I saw one of your tweets from December, I think, of 2020, and it was when you announced that you were joining Maddox, which rebranded to Polygon. Tell us a little bit about your journey kind of leading up to that decision and the founder story.
00:01:03.252 - 00:01:40.362, Speaker B: Yeah, it has been quite an adventure since then. But yeah, I guess, long story short, I joined Crypto in 2013. In 2017 full time, I got fascinated or infected by this idea of global network of value and humor coordination. Once you see it, you can't unsee it and you can't work on anything else. I studied computer science. I got naturally attracted to the infrastructure side of things. I realized that we need to kind of significantly, if not dramatically, improve the infrastructure in order to realize this grand vision that we have.
00:01:40.362 - 00:02:22.106, Speaker B: And yeah, during that kind of exploration and hanging out with researchers, mainly at ETH Research Forum, which for those who don't know that is kind of unofficially official ethereum research forum, the idea of polygon kind of crystallized along the way. And it was either I'm going to start it as a sole founder, or I'm going to join forces with someone. And I'm generally a collaborative person. And I realized from the beginning, polygon is a very ambitious idea. And yeah, I spoke with a couple of teams. One of them were the Meti guys. And from the first conversation, like we knew each other also from it research and this ethereum scaling community was not that big at that time.
00:02:22.106 - 00:03:00.598, Speaker B: And we met at some conferences and whatnot. Yeah. And from the first conversation, things really started to click, kind of. So joining hands with someone and working is a very serious decision, obviously, but all these kind of important checkboxes from them being very interested, very proactive, great work ethics, treasury being managed very well. So all these important things really kind of looked great. And very soon after maybe one or two months of discussions, we said, okay, let's do this thing together. And, yeah, the rest is history now.
00:03:00.598 - 00:03:05.794, Speaker B: It's obvious that it was a very good decision. Yeah. And it has been very excited.
00:03:05.922 - 00:03:21.580, Speaker A: Infected sums it up pretty well, I think. And talk to us a little bit about how you joined as a founder. How did those conversations go, like, within the graph ecosystem? I was invited to be a founder, but you just went right in there and said, I want to be a founder. Talk to us a little bit about that.
00:03:21.890 - 00:03:52.518, Speaker B: It just was kind of organic. There's not too much to say, I guess. I knew I wanted to do something. It was obvious that infrastructure has to be improved. The idea of polygon as this kind of infinitely scalable layer on top of Ethereum made a lot of sense to me. We just started talking, and as I said, things just started clicking and everything happened organically. I don't even have this kind of.
00:03:52.518 - 00:04:05.722, Speaker B: And I never had this strong preference to be called a co founder of anything. It's not really honestly about that. It's about, let's do something great together. Right. But it just kind of felt natural, I guess.
00:04:05.776 - 00:04:29.134, Speaker A: Amazing. Very humble, I like. So, okay, so for background, there's the polygon blockchain today called polygon Pos, and it's an Ethereum side chain, and it doesn't drive security from Ethereum, if I'm getting that correctly. Like other L2s, can you tell us a little bit about the polygon pos chain, how it's working today, and the security properties?
00:04:29.262 - 00:05:06.570, Speaker B: Yes, sure. So Polygon pos chain is an EVM compatible chain that operates alongside or in parallel with Ethereum. It indeed has its own validator set, hence the name polygon Pos chain. And we can go into kind of nitty gritty details and argue that it indeed can derive security from Ethereum in some way. Because these validators live on Ethereum, right? So they're implemented and the stake is there. And this staking contract is kind of upgradable. So in hypothetical case where they do something malicious, ideally through some governance process, you could upgrade that contract and slash them and whatnot.
00:05:06.570 - 00:05:47.014, Speaker B: These are kind of lower level details that we can go into, but I guess we don't have the bandwidth. For all practical purposes, there is a separate validator set that secures the chain itself. So the security of the system is mainly derived from this economic security of stake. Currently roughly, I believe, 40, or let's say 36% of the total token supply is staked. And at current price levels, that gives the system the security of $3.6 billion. So that's kind of the ballpark figure that is securing the chain.
00:05:47.014 - 00:06:12.898, Speaker B: And that has so far proven to be sufficient to secure the chain and the whole ecosystem. But all that being said, ideally it would be great if we have a way to derive security from Ethereum and remove even that additional trust assumption, no matter how confident we are that it can do the job, so to say. So, yeah, that's it in a nutshell, I guess.
00:06:12.984 - 00:06:22.486, Speaker A: Okay, got it. And Ethereum recently moved to proof of stake after, what, a seven year journey. And you guys started with proof of stake. Talk to us a little bit about that.
00:06:22.588 - 00:07:18.154, Speaker B: Yeah, it was one of the early proof of stake implementations. We are very happy that it has been up and running without any kind of major downtime or security incident. I don't want to jinx it, but yeah, we're very happy that has been the case so far. Yeah, it helped us a lot, especially on the adoption side, working with these big partners. And most of the people have seen these big partnerships kind of, and adoption milestones that Polygon has seen lately, from Instagram, Facebook, right, to Starbucks, to all these big brands like NFL, et cetera, et cetera. Really, a lot of these big, big names have been onboarded to Polygon in the last year. And using proof of stake was very, very helpful because these big names really care about carbon footprint and all these things.
00:07:18.154 - 00:07:33.630, Speaker B: So in that regard was really helpful. And also, we have learned a lot running this proof of stake network for practically now, more than two years, three years almost, basically. We have learned a lot along the way.
00:07:33.700 - 00:07:59.606, Speaker A: Totally. And during the boom of 2020 to 2022, Ethereum gas fees exploded. And I think Polygon was one of the chains that became the preferred place where a lot of projects, some on Ethereum and other chains, migrated. And can you talk to us a little bit about, like, what was that? Why do you think that they chose Polygon? And talk to us a little bit.
00:07:59.628 - 00:08:27.434, Speaker B: About that explosion out of necessity. I think at that point, DFI summer was in full swing. Right. And the price transaction fees for some little bit more complex swaps were often 100 plus dollars. So the fees were going wild. Absolutely. And a lot of kind of regular users were simply priced out from using Ethereum.
00:08:27.434 - 00:08:55.462, Speaker B: And the Ethereum community actually started looking for alternatives. Some of the alternatives were not that great, some sort of semi centralized or centralized alternative layer ones and whatnot. And Polygon, I believe, was almost the only technology that was. We knew it was not ideal, we knew it was not the end game, but we had it today. It was fully evm compatible. It was really easy to kind of redeploy to Polygon. It was available today, somewhat battle tested already.
00:08:55.462 - 00:09:26.594, Speaker B: We knew it was not the end game in terms of technology. It's not like the end game, not the bleeding edge tech that we are kind of envisioning. But it was available at that moment. The fees were very low. I think the community recognized that Polygon as a project, and the founding team and the core team are very Ethereum aligned. And the Ethereum community kind of recognized that, I believe. So all these factors together led to Polygon really becoming the scaling solution of choice at that time.
00:09:26.594 - 00:09:34.110, Speaker B: And that's when we saw this kind of hockey stick of adoption on Polygon.
00:09:34.190 - 00:09:47.062, Speaker A: Totally. And then you mentioned some of these bigger names like the NFL and Starbucks Odyssey. Talk to us a little bit about those deals. Why do you think that they chose Polygon? I know you mentioned the carbon footprint. Anything else?
00:09:47.196 - 00:10:45.686, Speaker B: Yeah, I think definitely the carbon footprint, which is very important for these companies. And apart from that, there's a lot of actually hard work from Polygon Labs and Polygon Labs BD team. And Polygon Labs is one of the big contributors to the polygon ecosystem. And yeah, they have done a lot of outreach, a lot of passionate work when it comes to connecting with these companies, educating them about potential, about possibilities of web free. So I would say that kind of hands on approach combined with technology that is available, that is energy efficient, environmental friendly, I would say these were the main factors. And then once you close this 1st, 2nd, 3rd partnership, then things kind of, that inertia kind of build momentum and that thing kind of. No one got fired for buying IBM.
00:10:45.686 - 00:11:17.750, Speaker B: And I think Polygon kind of eventually established that sort of reputation. And I think also at Polygon Labs, BD team has that mindset that partners always have to benefit more. At least if there's, I don't know, 100% of some benefit on the table. Partners should take 55 at least, and we can take up to, let's say, 45. So that's kind of that mentality that you still care about partners. We don't necessarily care about our ROI directly. And all of this, this is like a long term game for us.
00:11:17.750 - 00:11:24.466, Speaker B: So I guess combination of all these factors led to earning trust of all these big names.
00:11:24.578 - 00:11:34.950, Speaker A: Amazing. And do you think the NFT boom had anything to do with that? Because it felt like nfts kind of went mainstream. So do you think that fed into some of these larger brand deals?
00:11:35.030 - 00:12:21.642, Speaker B: 100%, because that's kind of the main use case. This is kind of the next NFTs usher this new wave of adoption and it's like not strictly a financial use case by default. And then the web free became dramatically more interesting to, for example, social networks like meta and explore ways for their content creators to monetize their work, et cetera. So definitely 100% NFT significantly contributed. For example, Starbucks is using Polygon for their loyalty program and NFTs are obviously the way to go. It's not like they were not interested in DFI necessarily being Starbucks. Right? So yeah, you're 100% right.
00:12:21.696 - 00:12:36.958, Speaker A: Totally. That makes sense. Yeah. I noticed a trend of people not calling it nfts and calling it digital assets. So the rebrand there is interesting. Let's talk a little bit about the Polygon EVM that you just launched, which is super exciting. It's a scaling technology.
00:12:36.958 - 00:12:39.850, Speaker A: Can you tell us a little bit about polygon zke Evm?
00:12:39.930 - 00:13:31.466, Speaker B: Yeah, Polygon ZkVM has been on the main net for month and a half now, roughly. We are very proud that we were able to deliver it. Polygon ZkVM, or ZKVM in general has been considered, I would say the holy grail of Ethereum scaling or blockchain infrastructure in general, because it simultaneously offers three very important properties. One is security, the second one is scalability, and the third one is EVM compatibility. So having all three together allows you to scale significantly Ethereum block space without hurting developer and user experience practically in any way. So yeah, the ZKVM has been considered the Holy grail. The major concern with ZKVM has always been the complexity and practicality of generating these proofs.
00:13:31.466 - 00:14:37.342, Speaker B: So creating circuits like implementing EVM from scratch in this ZK friendly or approvable manner is really a challenging job and doing it in a practical way. It was a little bit unclear when we started this ZKVM effort a little bit more than a year ago, almost year and a half ago, people familiar with the matter were estimating that it's going to take anywhere between three and five years to deliver production ready ZKVM. And we have been able to do that in basically year and a half. So we're very, very happy about that. And it was unclear even to us when we started, to be perfectly honest, it was unclear. How practical will it be? Like, how expensive will it be to generate these proofs? Will we have to run a data center to generate proofs for ZK? It was really unclear. Fortunately, along the way, our great team was able to come with some engineering and cryptographic breakthroughs that allow us to exponentially improve the efficiency of cost efficiency and scalability of ZKVM.
00:14:37.342 - 00:15:16.238, Speaker B: And we were able to deliver it in, as I said, like year and a half roughly in a very practical manner. Where we have, I think the latest benchmark is that average proving cost per transaction for ZKVM is zero point $45, which is like super practical. And yeah, we are very happy to see it on main net. So far it has been very stable. We're still being very careful with not opening the floodgates. We want to be responsible. It's a complex stack, but so far we're very excited and very happy how it's going.
00:15:16.324 - 00:15:37.462, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah, it's always interesting how people kind of put their own limitations on you, but it's so exciting. And I feel like you guys are kind of one of the underdogs, right? Or you used to be maybe one of the underdogs. And it's a good comeback story. And tell us a little bit about Zke EVM, what made you guys go towards the direction of ZK? What was that initial story?
00:15:37.596 - 00:16:39.462, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess being involved from the very early days, as I said, since 2017, we all have been involved with Ethereum scaling from day Zero. Basically there were side chains in the beginning and then plasma paper got published. And was there anything else? Yeah, there were state channels, but state channels are a little bit, kind of different beast. But from the very early days, we were able to analyze different scaling solutions, approaches, analyze trade offs between them, and we kind of grew strong confidence or conviction that ZK is the technology that will address this scaling, pressing scaling needs. It's like the go to or the optimal tech to address this challenge. I believe kind of personally, that in web free there's this almost like a muscle of pyramid of needs where we are the bottom layer now, where there's this pressing need for scaling, right? And we are willing to sacrifice some other things just to participate in the ecosystem. Let's just scale.
00:16:39.462 - 00:17:23.862, Speaker B: And then we are willing to sacrifice some things that are on the upper layers. And I believe above. Once that scaling, that pressing need to scale is addressed, I think we're going to move up the pyramid. And the layer above is probably privacy, right? So enterprises, companies will require privacy for obvious legal and business reasons. Retail, I mean, normal people and users will require privacy because it's basic human right and because that's how financial system works today. It's not really, I guess, optimal that anyone can see everyone's transactions on blockchain. So I guess that's going to be the next strong requirement, I guess, by the community once the scaling need is addressed.
00:17:23.862 - 00:17:56.840, Speaker B: And why am I saying this? Once we realize that, okay, we believe this is going to be the next major requirement. And once you realize that ZK is definitely also the right technology to address even debt, it became very clear for us that we want to go all in on ZK. And that's where we published this kind of polygon zk thesis and committed $1 billion from our treasury at that point to zk based technology and efforts. And yeah, we haven't regretted it, not even for a second.
00:17:57.370 - 00:18:14.010, Speaker A: Amazing, very exciting and super interesting. And I love that analogy to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. You need an image and a twitter thread around it. Tell us, what's the headline number around scaling? How much faster cheaper is polygon Zkevm than, say, ethereum?
00:18:14.430 - 00:19:15.434, Speaker B: Okay, not as much as we would like. So we're talking at the moment about one order of magnitude improvement in terms of throughput and in terms of costs. But this is just the very first iteration of ZKVM, and we have very clear roadmap ahead of us. And also Ethereum roadmap is going in that direction to make zkvm way more scalable and affordable. So on our side, we just wanted to ship the first version of ZKM to prove that to us and to the world that it is possible to deliver and to make it practical. Now we're focusing on optimizing costs and throughput, and there are some very nice properties of ZK based solutions. One of them is that if you're building a ZK roll up, you don't need to submit signatures on chain because you can just prove that all the transactions were signed in a valid way by corresponding private keys.
00:19:15.434 - 00:20:20.798, Speaker B: And you don't need to store signatures, which allows you to save a lot of guess, a lot of guess when you're submitting these transactions that can make transactions much cheaper. So that's one of the optimization that we're working on. There are several others that we are exploring. Ethereum is moving forward with 4844, which will make data availability for roll ups like Zkavm exponentially cheaper and more scalable. So I believe soon enough, let's say six months or so from now, we're looking at another, I would say 50 to 100 x improvement. Assuming 4844 is deployed, I think we're talking about 50 to 100 x improvement from this where we are at the moment, which would mean roughly 1000 x, let's say 500 to 1000 x improvement in terms of throughput and in terms of transaction fees, which is then much, much more serious, I guess, improvement. And I think that's reality.
00:20:20.798 - 00:20:23.186, Speaker B: Just a matter of some months.
00:20:23.288 - 00:20:39.970, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, exciting. We're solving, scaling and moving up that hierarchy. And with that, tell us a little bit about the launch. How did it go? How was it? Was it exciting? How did you guys approach it? Talk to us. From a strategy standpoint, it was very.
00:20:40.060 - 00:21:13.650, Speaker B: Exciting, but we just really try to be as kind of professional and as responsible as possible about it. Again, it's a very complex tech. It has never been shipped on Mainnet. And yeah, we just did multiple internal audits, external audits. A lot of like Testnet has been running for six plus months with liver. So just really, we were mainly focused on security, but the launch event itself was really great, really emotional. Vitalik joined us and did the first transaction and all of that.
00:21:13.650 - 00:21:59.006, Speaker B: So it was really cool. And yeah, the most importantly, the network has been very stable since day one. We have not seen any incidents, any downtime so far, and we're just really trying to stay focused on further improving it, strengthening the network, maturing the code, squashing bugs, et cetera. So yeah, not too much time. There was a little bit of kind of emotions, definitely. We are very happy that we were able to deliver it, but we are still heads down, focused on further improving it. And it's just a milestone for us, a very important milestone, but it's just a milestone and we are just really still focused on improving it and keeping it secure.
00:21:59.118 - 00:22:04.740, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah, just the beginning. And which projects are on Zke Evm today?
00:22:06.970 - 00:22:35.674, Speaker B: I don't have the exact latest number, but this should be a correct ballpark figure. Should be around 10,000 applications or smart contracts deployed at this point on ZKVM. That's a ballpark figure, but it's definitely correct. So yeah, there's huge level of interest. It's just a matter of, again, being responsible. We're not opening the floodgates. There's a lot of partners who are interested to deploy infrastructure.
00:22:35.674 - 00:23:18.042, Speaker B: Partners graph has been with us since day one and we are very happy and grateful for that. There are all these others that are coming, like Etherscan is now there, oracles are coming. So this kind of infrastructure takes a little bit of time to be established and we're kind of not, polylapse is not rushing it. We're really trying not to open the float gates immediately and have, I don't know, millions of users and gazillions of capital there. We would like, ideally, for it to happen gradually. So that's what we are kind of trying to do. But there's a lot of interest, really, a lot of these great web free apps that are already on Polygon Pos.
00:23:18.042 - 00:23:26.558, Speaker B: Most of them really can't wait to deploy on ZKVM, but we're just kind of trying to just do it all gradually, I guess.
00:23:26.644 - 00:23:38.878, Speaker A: Makes sense. And that 10,000 is no small number. I feel like that's actually quite a large number when it comes to applications in crypto and web3. Any notable applications you want to mention or highlight?
00:23:39.054 - 00:24:08.170, Speaker B: Not specifically. At the moment, I think I would do injustice. There's a lot of great apps, I think maybe I just wouldn't at this point. Maybe I just wouldn't mention anyone not doing justice. Like some of them really deployed on literally on day one, several DeFi protocols that deployed on literally on day one, and we are very happy to see that. But again, we just want to see things growing kind of gradually if possible.
00:24:08.320 - 00:24:23.690, Speaker A: Totally very diplomatic. And with that, I guess, how are projects deciding? Are they launching on both Polygon Pos? Do you expect eventually there will be kind of a merge and everyone will go towards ZkevM? How are projects distinguishing between the two chains?
00:24:23.850 - 00:24:59.206, Speaker B: That's a great question. Currently, how you can distinguish between these two projects is mainly in terms of, I guess, fees. And there are some security trade offs, like by design, ZKVM should be more secure because it derives security fully from Ethereum. Assuming the cryptography and the math of ZKVM is correct, there are no additional trust assumptions. So you're basically deriving fully security from ethereum. Whereas as we said in Polygon Pos chain, there is this additional validator set that secures it. So there are these differences in trust assumptions and significant differences in fees.
00:24:59.206 - 00:25:50.746, Speaker B: So the fees on pos chain are still lower than on ZkaVM and are lower by design because we're not submitting these transactions to Ethereum and we don't have these additional overhead costs. So it's mainly applications that are looking for maybe lower fees, higher throughput and are not security first. Like for example, some web3 games and stuff like that might still use POS chain that still might be a better solution for them. Whereas for example, for defi apps which really require ironclad security, ZkVM might be obvious choice for them. All that being said, as I said in the beginning, it would be great if POS chain can be upgraded to use ZkVM and turned into zk validium, for example. And we're actively exploring that. I think I can share that.
00:25:50.746 - 00:26:08.238, Speaker B: And yeah, we cannot commit to anything officially at this point, but yeah, we're actively exploring that. And that would be a great then kind of product offering. If you were to have one ZkVM validium and one ZkVM roll up, that would be very cool. But that's still under exploration.
00:26:08.414 - 00:26:23.206, Speaker A: Exciting. And with ZK rollups like Polygon, ZkE EVM, it requires a sequencer and approver. Can you talk a little bit about those two things for the listeners? And talk to us a little bit about the plans to decentralize over time?
00:26:23.308 - 00:27:27.094, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So as you said, every ZK rollup requires sequencer and approver. They are hypothetically two different roles or entities, but they can be a single entity as well. We are starting like, to the best of my knowledge, every big roller project, we are starting with the centralized sequencer and centralized prover. So the intent with this first release was to again prove viability and practicality of ZKVM. And now moving forward, one of our focuses is definitely decentralizing both the prover and the sequencer. And we already have kind of a blueprint where you will have sort of something similar relatively to pos chain, where you have some decentralized set of sequencers that can even reach local consensus and have single slot local finality that any application or any user can acknowledge, or they can wait for the strong finality when the proof actually gets generated and submitted to Ethereum.
00:27:27.094 - 00:28:20.220, Speaker B: And that's how you're generally thinking about it. And decentralizing synchron and approver is generally mainly about ensuring liveness and removing some sort of censorship threats that are there definitely with centralized sequencers. So centralized sequencer can arbitrary censor transactions, they can do unlimited kind of MEV activities and can go down are basically single point of failure. So once you decentralize the sequencer, all those free concerns are kind of addressed. So that's definitely one of our focuses moving forward. We couldn't do everything at once like this. Had to be kind of process.
00:28:20.220 - 00:28:31.294, Speaker B: In terms of timelines, I think it's realistic to have decentralized EKVM in roughly eight to ten months from now.
00:28:31.332 - 00:28:41.170, Speaker A: I would say exciting and ambitious. And then I notice on polygon ZkevM you say that it's opcode equivalent. Can you share a little bit about what that means?
00:28:41.320 - 00:29:47.698, Speaker B: Yeah, as you said a few months ago, it was nfts now it's like digital collectibles and whatnot. We like to argue about definitions in general, web free and all that. So I wouldn't necessarily kind of stick to that opcode equivalence or opcode compatibility or whatever term is in use now. But practically what's important to understand is that ZKVM, we have 99 point something, 99 plus percent of compatibility with Ethereum opcodes and pre compiles. We are still to implement three pre compiles, pairings Blake two and SHA 256 56. Once we implement that, we will be full blown type two ZKVM, which means that there is no practical effect on developer and user experience. So users are using all the existing Ethereum tools like Metamask.
00:29:47.698 - 00:30:25.510, Speaker B: You use the network in absolutely the same way ether is used for gas fees. You literally use the network in exactly the same way like you use Ethereum. It's just that you pay lower fees and confirmation time is faster and developers as well. There's zero need to modify contracts to do any sort of re audits. Developers use the same tools like remix, like foundry. Everything is absolutely developer experience is completely the same, and there is no application that has to be modified or re audited or anything like that. So that's kind of the important part.
00:30:25.510 - 00:31:13.586, Speaker B: The difference is, in addition to type two, there is type one Zkavm, which closely follows also the Ethereum kind of client architecture, specifically the hashing function and state tree, the state data structure. But that only makes a difference if you want to prove Ethereum chain itself. If you're proving L2 solution, that type one is just, by design, roughly order of magnitude more expensive and slower. So type two Zkavm is probably the optimal way to build zkavms. ZkvM L2s basically. Hope that makes sense.
00:31:13.688 - 00:31:24.674, Speaker A: Yeah, you answered my question without me really needing to ask it. And double clicking into the developer experience. Can the developers reuse their Ethereum mainnet code on ckevm?
00:31:24.802 - 00:32:16.498, Speaker B: Absolutely. We haven't encountered so far any application that hasn't been able to just simply redeploy, just using remix or anything like literally the same process, same contracts, you just redeploy them and they work. We haven't seen, but potentially they are like, as I said, we still don't have these free pre compiles pairings. For example, if you would want to build some sort of layer free on top of ZKVM, you would probably need pairings. Likely you would need pairings so that you cannot build today on ZkVm for example, but no one even tried it so far. So generally we haven't seen anyone who tried to deploy but couldn't. But soon enough, very soon, in a matter of one or two months, we will have also these remaining free opcodes.
00:32:16.498 - 00:32:18.870, Speaker B: So then we will be fully full blown type two.
00:32:18.940 - 00:32:22.706, Speaker A: Got it. And what's your thesis on the layer threes?
00:32:22.818 - 00:33:39.410, Speaker B: I think maybe we are kind of running ahead of ourselves a little bit, to be honest, with layer threes and layer fours or sixteen s, I think if designed properly and if you're using zk technology, Ethereum can support, I don't want to say unlimited number of L2s, but you can effectively and very easily aggregate. Assuming, let's assume we have 100 or 1000 L2s on top of Ethereum, you can in a very simple way. And they are submitting zk proofs, generating periodically zk proofs, let's say every ten minutes or every five minutes, you can just do one step of recursion and aggregate all these proofs into a single proof and prove all of those 100 or 1000 chains on Ethereum with a single proof. I think it's fair to question the necessity for layer freeze in such an ecosystem, but I wouldn't be making any kind of strong conclusions here or statements. But I think we might really have been able to scale really significantly with L2s only this year.
00:33:39.480 - 00:33:49.074, Speaker A: Really feels like it's the year of ZK. Tell us a little bit about how Zke EVM compares to some of the other ZK roll ups like ZK sync and scroll.
00:33:49.202 - 00:34:23.134, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So mandatory disclaimer. We are strongly aligned with Ethereum community. We support all meaningful scaling efforts. The strength of Ethereum is this huge number of talented teams that are working on improving every part of the Ethereum infrastructure. That being said, so scroll is working on type one and they are, I would say, relatively far from the main net. We are on Mainet today and I mentioned previously type one and some differences between type one and type two.
00:34:23.134 - 00:35:28.318, Speaker B: So that's, I guess the major difference between scroll and polygon Zkvm. So we are type two, they are type one and we are on mainet today and they will definitely need some more time to get there. When it comes to ZK sync, Zksync is what is called type free Zkvm which means that they don't really have a ZkVM. They have some custom zkvm which is not really zke evm. It is their custom ZK virtual machine. And then they use existing solidity code, existing applications or contracts in written in solidity, and transpile them to that virtual machine assembly of the native code or native language of their custom virtual machine. That approach, I would say, made quite a lot of sense back in the days when we started working on ZkVM, because as I said, it wasn't really clear how much time it will take to build proper ZkVm.
00:35:28.318 - 00:36:18.118, Speaker B: Will it be practical? So that approach used to make, I would say, a lot of sense. We were considering it back in the days, but I would say that now, once it's obvious that Zke EVM is here, we were able to deliver it this type two, and it's practical. I don't think this transpiling approach makes too much sense at the moment because it has certain challenges, like it's hard to get to full compatibility with Ethereum. It's breaking often compatibility with tools, with the end user interfaces and stuff like that. So yeah, I don't think it makes too much sense now at this point. So I guess those would be main differences from my viewpoint at least. Of course.
00:36:18.204 - 00:36:23.554, Speaker A: Got it. And tell us a little bit about the team behind Polygon Zke EVM.
00:36:23.682 - 00:37:08.214, Speaker B: Yeah, so the team is something that really makes me excited about every new day, working at Polygon, because we are very fortunate that after we published this Polygon's EKT and this commitment of ours, we were able to join hands with three very talented teams, very talented projects. One is Polygon Hermes, spearheaded by Jordi Balina, who's the legend of the Ethereum community. And they built, I think, the first or one of the first ZK rollups. Before that, before joining us, it was called Hermes. The second team is Polygon Zero Xmere protocol. Mere protocol was innovative performance ZK layer one. They joined our hands.
00:37:08.214 - 00:38:19.094, Speaker B: Their expertise is they have very strong, very deep expertise when it comes to performance provers, and we're very happy to work with them. They are the ones who came up with these major breakthroughs that we use in Polygon ZK VM today. And the third team is polygonmiden, led by Bobin, who previously created the first stark virtual machine called Distas and led Facebook's ZK team. Previously, when they were more focused on web free, these free teams joined us. And the level of collaboration, they are practically one team. We intentionally kept the teams formally separate and we encouraged differences, different approaches, different type of proverb model like plurality and kind of approaches and opinions. But from the very beginning, the level of collaboration and that energy within the team, which is practically one team, has been very inspiring and very kind of pleasing to observe.
00:38:19.094 - 00:38:35.474, Speaker B: So, yeah, the team, I would dare to say that we definitely have one of the strongest teams in the ZK teams in the whole industry at the moment. And, yeah, we're very optimistic about the future and what this team will deliver moving forward.
00:38:35.592 - 00:38:41.140, Speaker A: Got it. And so those three teams are kind of coming together and working on CKEVM, is that right?
00:38:41.510 - 00:39:23.166, Speaker B: Yeah, we knew that we want this kind of initial phase of exploration, so let's explore different approaches. Let 1000 flowers bloom. And we hope that this convergence will just happen naturally. And we are kind of seeing it now. As you said, we're focusing more on ZKVM itself. Miden is alternative to EVM design. But again, these teams are now working on first unified prover layer, on unified intermediary, arithmetization layer, and on top of that kind of ZK framework, then you can build things like ZKVM, things like Miden, things like, I don't know, ZK wasm tomorrow.
00:39:23.166 - 00:39:50.774, Speaker B: So basically, we're converging on one single ZK framework, on zk stack that we believe can be really powerful and kind of become the standard for ZK development in the industry. That's really what we believe. And I think we're going to be talking much more about that in the coming weeks and months because literally now it's that this convergence is actually happening.
00:39:50.892 - 00:40:04.638, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. And when I was preparing for this interview, I was trying to kind of put the pieces together. So that is super helpful. And then tell us a little bit about the merger. It was really big news. How did that kind of come about? How did you decide to do that and how did it go?
00:40:04.804 - 00:40:54.302, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it came from. Okay, so we announced this serious commitment that we're going all in on ZK and $1 billion committed from treasury. But these people like Jordy and Bobin and Daniel from Brandon, from Mir, and now Polygon zero, these people cannot be really attracted by money. They're not really driven by debt. So I think we knew each other from before, mainly through, I guess, our research network. I knew all of them for quite some time. And we just discussed, and I think they realized that we are really determined to do something great and that together we can do much more.
00:40:54.302 - 00:41:46.058, Speaker B: And I think it just happened naturally. And things have been really going absolutely fantastic since day zero. The atmosphere between the teams, the level of collaboration, the energy on these regular calls that we have to sync with each other and decide how to move forward is really, really contagious and inspiring. So, yeah, all these three kind of mergers have been really, I think, good decisions. And I think it would be great to ask, of course, always some of these people, Jordy or Danielle or Bobin, but yeah, from what I can see, they never also regretted decision.
00:41:46.154 - 00:42:02.900, Speaker A: That's great. And I think, yeah, some of the best people in the industry are not attracted by the money. And it's really kind of about the mission and the work. So that's great. And how did the meshing of those cultures go? Because I imagine that's not an easy feat, bringing three teams together to one.
00:42:03.350 - 00:43:20.326, Speaker B: It's just part of this wider crazy process of culture meshing and establishing that's happening in Polygon. So Polygon initially was, a lot of employees were from India initially. Now, in the meantime, we have really a lot of employees from the US and really across the whole world. So there's like 400 plus people working pretty much full time on polygon from literally all continents and different cultures, different teams, as you said, when you bring even the whole team, okay, different individuals from different cultures, different backgrounds, but now you bring a whole team inside of that. So it's like really kind of very interesting process of establishing what is called this polygon culture. And we are just trying to communicate at least these most important high level values or guidelines, which are basically humbleness and willingness to pursue this grand vision of web free and main values of web free. And I think with that, as a North star, everything else becomes kind of like an interesting process of this culture meshing.
00:43:20.326 - 00:43:30.270, Speaker B: As long as you have this kind of North Star that everyone are aware of, everyone is aware of, and everyone is following, things are just interesting, I guess.
00:43:30.420 - 00:43:40.866, Speaker A: Totally. And what would you say? I guess there's so many new people in crypto today. What would you say? Are those main values of web3 that you think everyone should know?
00:43:41.048 - 00:44:29.986, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So I guess the most important one is this openness. So we want to build this global permissionless network of value and human coordination. So I lived, at one point in my life, I lived in Tanzania, and coming from Europe, it was very surprising for me to understand that basically one third of that big country, these people don't have IDs. And I was like, so not to mention bank accounts, not to mention credit cards, not to mention PayPal or whatever. So they are basically excluded from the global economy, practically or fully excluded. With the Internet, we have been able to kind of democratize access to knowledge, to information.
00:44:29.986 - 00:45:31.698, Speaker B: So anyone from any remote village in Africa or Asia or wherever, can attend an MIT course, learn to code or learn some skill. But a lot of these people, so basically 2 billion people in the world don't have access to global economy, don't have bank accounts, don't have IDs. So if we are able to establish this global economy and democratize access to global economy, that can really transform the society in very, very profound ways. So I guess that openness is probably the most important, the core value, the second very important one should be privacy. Privacy is a basic human right, and I think that's definitely one of the core values of web free. The next one should be self custody. Self custody is a very interesting, very powerful concept where you have a network where you actually have ownership, actual ownership of your assets, even though as time goes, as the mainstream adoption comes, I'm sure we will see a lot of custody solutions.
00:45:31.698 - 00:46:12.210, Speaker B: Self custody is not for everyone. Obviously, some people will decide at the end of the day to trust some services, custody services of sorts. But as long as we keep that option always for users, as one of our core values, that you can actually own your assets and only you, with your private key, are in control of your assets. It's very, very also important and transformative concept. So for me, I guess those three values are probably the most important ones. So that kind of openness, self custody and privacy. And from that you can even derive fairness when it's fully open and permissionless.
00:46:12.210 - 00:47:25.958, Speaker B: It's more fair by design. But we can go a little bit beyond that and say that, for example, in web two startups, and I'm not throwing shade on web two founders, like, full respect for them, of course. But when you found web two startup, you own 100% of that project, right? You're capturing all the value by design. And we have a lot of these big web two companies where users are putting a lot of work, energy, time, effort in creating content or doing some activities, and they don't really capture any value, right? Value is captured by the founders, by employees, investors, et cetera, in web free. And in web free networks in general, I would say they're, by design, more fair. In Polygon, I, as a founder, I have few percent of the network, and huge majority of the network value is captured by relevant stakeholders, like validators, end users, people who own tokens, et cetera. So I think by design, these networks are also more fair to some degree.
00:47:26.054 - 00:47:37.280, Speaker A: Agreed. Yeah. It's more of a meritocracy where you're compensated commensurate to the value you add, which is powerful. And what would you say you're most excited for in 2023?
00:47:38.290 - 00:48:32.962, Speaker B: That's a great question. As you said, there has been so much happening at Polygon and people are often rightfully confused with there are free zk teams, there are several client implementation efforts. There's so much stuff happening, and people have been asking, okay, how do these things come together? What's the purpose of the token now in this new paradigm? What the hell are you guys doing? And I think I'm very excited about all these things coming together and us finally communicating how they come together and working with community in formalizing these things and making them happen. I think that's definitely going to be very exciting. And this year, in that sense, is also kind of critically important for us and our whole community.
00:48:33.096 - 00:48:41.250, Speaker A: Constantine underscore RM from Twitter asks, do you plan to allow a wider group of validators to join the polygon validation?
00:48:42.550 - 00:49:10.974, Speaker B: Absolutely. The whole, like when things now start coming together, one of the prerequisites or kind of requirements is that we have completely open permissionless validator pool that can validate or sequence any change the polygon ecosystems, because polygon ecosystem is kind of this multilayer to interconnected multilayer to layer on top of Ethereum. So the short answer is definitely yes.
00:49:11.092 - 00:49:15.150, Speaker A: Amazing. And then the final question is just how are you defiant.
00:49:20.130 - 00:50:14.466, Speaker B: I guess I'm defined in a way that I am just completely immersed or fascinated by that idea of web free and this global network of open permissionless network of value and human coordination. And I would say don't care about any temporary negative news if prices are going down, if there's some regulatory scrutiny and stuff like that. I guess I completely don't care about these things and I just care about this goal or this vision that I'm kind of fascinated with. And yeah, I just completely refuse to accept any or get, I don't know, upset or annoyed by any of the. I just completely ignore them and I just do my thing.
00:50:14.648 - 00:50:19.060, Speaker A: I love that. And tell us, what is that vision? What kind of keeps you going?
00:50:19.430 - 00:51:03.134, Speaker B: That vision, really? I really believe if you're able to establish this permissionless network of value that anyone can participate in, we will onboard 2 billion more people to global economy, make it more efficient, make it more fair, more inclusive. And I think it's clear for us how the Internet has transformed our society. And I really believe the Internet has the network of information, and I really believe this network of value and human coordination can transform society in even more profound ways. And I'm very excited to see that happening and see the consequences of all of that.
00:51:03.252 - 00:51:10.046, Speaker A: Amazing. Completely agree and excited to be on the journey alongside you. Thank you so much for coming on the Defiant. This was great.
00:51:10.148 - 00:51:12.510, Speaker B: Thank you so much for the invite. I really enjoyed.
