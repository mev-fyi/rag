00:00:02.250 - 00:00:42.150, Speaker A: CFI versus Defi. It's the latest tribal war in crypto, and it pits the future of decentralized finance trading on decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, against the legacy crypto exchanges many of us used. Once upon a time, the differences between trading on a Dex and a Kex like Coinbase used to be extraordinarily different. DExs were clunky, slow, and without liquidity, which eliminated the vast majority, the crypto trading world. But then uniswap launched in October 2018, and things have never been the same since. Now it feels inevitable that everyone will eventually trade on Dexes and the centralized crypto exchanges. Well, they seemingly have much more to lose in this race.
00:00:42.150 - 00:01:26.274, Speaker A: First, let's call attention to the major differences between kexs and Dexs. On a Kex, you give up control of your assets to trade on the exchange, but in DeXs, you never have to do that. But you do have to self custody assets in an ethereum wallet like metamask. Now, this might sound like a win for Dexes, but for those who don't trust themselves, self custodiang a Kex might actually be ideal. Kexes historically have had exponentially more liquidity and more trading volume. But recently, in 2020, Dexes have actually begun to outperform some Kexes in trade volume, with uniswap booking $200 million in daily trade volume regularly in the fall, and up to over $2 billion traded in a single day. Dexes can be thought of as community owned.
00:01:26.274 - 00:02:01.758, Speaker A: Anyone can provide liquidity and then earn trading fees in the pool, versus in Kexes, there's a centralized team that runs the exchange and makes all the revenue. KExs offer customer support and in many cases, excluding the bad actors and scammers. Of course they provide a service custodying funds for traders. But in Dexs there's often no formal customer service. But there is a growing standard of having access to a team. Through a discord group, gaining access to DFI team support has been a major advancement. In 2020, finally, Kexes require sign up with email and in most cases, KYC.
00:02:01.758 - 00:02:29.240, Speaker A: Dexes don't just connect your Ethereum wallet and go, you can trade frictionlessly and peertopeer. Now, this isn't about a battle between Dexes and Kexes anymore. It's about the expansive growth opportunity in DFI trading. And with Dexes, that's seemingly impossible to stop.
