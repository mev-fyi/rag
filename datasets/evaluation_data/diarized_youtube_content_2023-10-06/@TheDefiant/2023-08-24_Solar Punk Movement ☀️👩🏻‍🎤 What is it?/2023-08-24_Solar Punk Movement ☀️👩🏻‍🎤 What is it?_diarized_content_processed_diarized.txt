00:00:00.170 - 00:00:08.462, Speaker A: Can we talk a little bit about the solar punk movement? Can you explain what the Solarpunk community is and why you maybe resonate with that community?
00:00:08.596 - 00:00:57.660, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Solar punk is really a vibe more than anything. It's it's a literary and artistic movement. But ultimately, what I think it's trying to do is envision positive futures where humanity has solved some of these core problems, like climate change, biodiversity loss, loneliness, living in community by interconnecting nature and people. What I find so appealing about Solarpunk is that it basically says, hey, we actually can solve these problems. It actually turns out that if we just get together with small groups of people and figure out how to build organizations and society that is both high tech and high nature at the same time, that we can start to turn the tide on some of these big problems facing the world.
