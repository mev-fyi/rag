00:00:00.330 - 00:00:02.010, Speaker A: Another week, another hack.
00:00:02.090 - 00:00:03.070, Speaker B: God damn it.
00:00:03.140 - 00:00:04.538, Speaker C: Hate this hacking crap.
00:00:04.634 - 00:00:46.710, Speaker A: What a pickle. Now, if you recall, in our last episode, we went deep on flash loans and the hacks they enabled, and I came to the frustrating conclusion that everyone needed to man up, take the beating, and move on. Accept it as just one of those things. The hackers doing their job of keeping developers on their toes, taking lots of fast forward a week. And yet another protocol got hacked, but this time not with a flashstone, but with what looked like the mother of all Chad arbitrage moves. And this time it was pickle finance, one of the innumerable food themed DFI protocols that sprang up during this most saucy of DFI summers.
00:00:46.790 - 00:00:47.786, Speaker D: I'm saucy with it.
00:00:47.808 - 00:01:01.790, Speaker A: The pickle token saw some predictably huge gains back then, soaring 1800% from around four bucks fifty to eighty five dollars after a Twitter interaction with none other than Vitalik, who was moved to praise its governance model.
00:01:01.860 - 00:01:03.022, Speaker D: I'm saucy with it.
00:01:03.076 - 00:01:09.794, Speaker A: And at the time of recording, it's trading around $10, but who knows where it'll be by the time you actually watch this.
00:01:09.832 - 00:01:10.686, Speaker B: It's summer street.
00:01:10.718 - 00:01:54.554, Speaker A: Now, Pickle's main draw are its jars, which are a cloned version of Wyurne's version one vaults. So there's a connection with Andre Coronier already. But what's really gotten people talking is that following the hack, Pickle and Wyurn agreed to a merger. And it seems like this is actually part of a major play to establish a powerful block of Defi protocols. Now, look, this story has been covered widely in other media, of course, but here at the defier, we try and find a different angle on a piece. And it just so happened that as I was reading a particularly caustic analysis of the news from autism capital, I stumbled across this comment from the delightfully monikered fut Buckerson, who said, Wi Fi.
00:01:54.602 - 00:02:05.360, Speaker E: Holders understand that governance is entirely a LARP and Wi Fi is a valueless token. But we are happy to put our fate into the hands of the goats Dr. Dre and.
00:02:29.970 - 00:03:00.450, Speaker C: He get that mad yield. I give my props to these cats that the Ns yow Mc yellow boy was the deal evil pickle jar makes up with 20 million be a bad bomb villa with crystal minions cracking codes and molds are just burn them a pinch of salt for your vote, you can't earn them can't be selling me dreams for your Runway, can't be telling me schemes, you're no crunch. It wasn't flash load, it wasn't good code. You're in a pickle like Dillo smothering in G mode. Eight little things. Seven floors, six back doors, five second timer, four ways to withdraw. And now I'm feeling so free about the money they stealing.
00:03:00.450 - 00:03:17.260, Speaker C: Twelve hour time clock where everyone's sleeping and everybody's like, oh, you know, an older cash light. Time to go. White paper telling me no, maybe I'll put it back later. Protocol, listening. That message is Tina, so hear me when I say you better go audit your code.
00:03:17.950 - 00:03:19.340, Speaker B: Audit your code.
00:03:20.350 - 00:03:25.210, Speaker F: Because the hips got to hear pockets, hard copy, way too fast. Money gone. No way back. Hungry.
00:03:25.370 - 00:03:26.510, Speaker B: Implode.
00:03:30.770 - 00:03:33.422, Speaker D: It's not where I wanted pickles to be.
00:03:33.556 - 00:03:56.482, Speaker A: And the chat, well, it did implode. Big time, as you'd expect. People were mad. Believe it. So, you know, normally in one of these videos, I will call up someone with their finger firmly on Defi's pulse for a quick chat and a bit of deeper insight. So this time I called. He didn't want to chat.
00:03:56.482 - 00:04:02.570, Speaker A: Not this time. Turns out the boy has got skills.
00:04:03.550 - 00:04:17.038, Speaker B: Pickle. Pickle. Check. Cool. I don't even know him. Another flash thrown in. They gone in a moment.
00:04:17.038 - 00:04:34.482, Speaker B: And now they all frantic. Call up your bantic to save all your antics. 20 more gone. These honest can't solve but nobody's on 200 IQ to reverse one wrong wet ass or wrong. So Defi responds, it's time for a merger take an explode and make it to a learning yearn is evolving. Swallow your yield apology. Knows it, look, he know what it is.
00:04:34.482 - 00:04:39.730, Speaker B: Pickle finance. Live to let live. Nurses all flustered. It sort of chimps evil jars. What the hell is this shit?
00:04:40.390 - 00:05:01.260, Speaker A: Now, there's one person who's become always the poster child to DFI at its most pure this year. And he's a rare one, because unlike many, he doesn't hide his identity. He's not anonymous. And despite all the strangeness surrounding eminence, on more than one occasion this year, he's proven himself to be the man with the plan. And this time was no different.
00:05:02.190 - 00:05:20.142, Speaker C: Yo, yo, yo. So this is a story all about how the pickle juggler twisted upside down onboarding crypto. You know, nothing never really dies. Because not every lux you make, it gets realized. Now, wait a minute. All you blockheads creeping up? This is how we do it on the blockchain. Big bets.
00:05:20.142 - 00:05:36.866, Speaker C: Maybe the pickle was sweeter with every bite missing. Nothing on the real game. Double team Bante. So we don't know what this phase is. We fill in holes with different gauges. We see them losses and we played this bailing out the party with an MNA playlist. Dao.
00:05:36.866 - 00:06:02.458, Speaker C: They got their hands on the figures, but left a few of them harders or shaking, beating and triggered. And yo, I see that wallet and it's painful. All this sneaky shit. Disgraceful. And it's shameful. Andre, tell me what's the deal? Andre, tell me what's the deal? Andre, tell me what's the deal? We gonna purge or we merge? Tell me what's the deal? Yo, we need some perspective on this situation. This Defi jibber japanese proper explanation.
00:06:02.458 - 00:06:05.234, Speaker C: Camilla Truth killer, whosoever you are, I'm talking.
00:06:05.272 - 00:06:05.614, Speaker F: Ruth.
00:06:05.662 - 00:06:07.860, Speaker C: Watch your tape. You're the defi star.
00:06:08.230 - 00:06:54.330, Speaker D: The yearn and pickle finance merger shows an interesting trend of consolidation in DeFi, which makes sense that at some point after you have this explosion of new protocols and platforms, the bigger fish will start to eat the smaller ones to increase efficiency and wealth, to become even bigger fish. It's also one of a series of partnerships between urine and other players. Yern recently merged with Cream and partnered with Hegeic. So what we're seeing is urine finance becoming a huge, multi purpose, multifunction defi bank, or non bank, with automated investment insurance options and lending. For pickle, it's a nice way to recover. After its recent attack. The rise in its token price shows pickle holders are happy about the move.
00:06:54.420 - 00:07:03.986, Speaker C: Tell me what's the deal under tell me what's the deal we gonna purge or we merge? Tell me what's the deal so the.
00:07:04.008 - 00:07:51.970, Speaker A: Pickle exploit was fascinating, mainly because it didn't lean on a flash loan exploit, but something even more advanced. And the subsequent merger has proven to be just one. In a sequence of such deals, Yn Finance has now partnered or merged with at least six different Defi projects, three of which have been announced in just the past week. Sushiswap, Acropolis and cover were the latest protocols to combine forces with Yern, while merges with Cream. Pickle, of course, and a partnership with Hedgek were announced in the past two weeks. Now, look, they will all continue working separately, each with their own token. The difference, though, is that the automated investment strategies of yearn, Acropolis and Pickle Sushi's, amm, cream's lending and borrowing and covers insurance products are now all interconnected and leveraging each other's offerings.
00:07:51.970 - 00:08:05.926, Speaker A: Legos. Don't you love them? The question is, oh, I do love a pickle. What have we learned through all of this? So this is the end of the.
00:08:05.948 - 00:08:23.258, Speaker G: Tale when happens when protocols fail to protect retail whales, when hackers derail and prevail your goods for that on scale and I don't want to dis your intellect but I do think it's time we reflect that again. The Mr. X psychitetechs who neglect to get co checked and collect fortune for project from subjects who like the selective ability to check the pedal to take their own direction chasing their directions fall on their knees to respect gene afflict.
00:08:23.274 - 00:08:27.438, Speaker C: Their anonymous directors well, that is the.
00:08:27.444 - 00:08:31.470, Speaker G: Fastest way I know to get wrecked.
00:08:31.810 - 00:08:37.060, Speaker B: So it was at this time you got lucky this time.
00:08:39.430 - 00:08:50.066, Speaker D: But I won't always be an Andre a White House to come to save the day he's a hero.
00:08:50.098 - 00:08:55.174, Speaker C: We never asked for relative warrior the Macdalriorian when they say Andre, you say.
00:08:55.372 - 00:08:56.920, Speaker D: This is the way.
00:08:57.370 - 00:09:02.870, Speaker G: That's the sound of the SAT inspector they coming in, they coming through they come in like corona to disinfect you.
00:09:03.020 - 00:09:05.026, Speaker A: And if the source of information upon.
00:09:05.058 - 00:09:10.140, Speaker C: Which you are reliant turns out not to be trustworthy remember defined it.
