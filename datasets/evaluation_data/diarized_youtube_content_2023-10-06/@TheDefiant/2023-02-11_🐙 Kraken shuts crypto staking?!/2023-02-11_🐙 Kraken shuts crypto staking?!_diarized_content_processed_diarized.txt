00:00:16.810 - 00:00:37.106, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. You know, I hate to admit it, but I really like the intro music. I mean, it kind of reminds me of like the music at the beginning of a 70s cop show. It's like Starsky and Hutch or something. Anyway, I digress. Welcome, everyone to the weekly recap of the Defiant. My name is Eddie Robinson.
00:00:37.106 - 00:00:53.110, Speaker A: I'm an editor with the Defiant. And there is Camilla. Hi, how are you? Well, I will turn it over to you and you can do the honors, the rest of the introductions and walk us through the week.
00:00:53.280 - 00:01:28.700, Speaker B: Yeah, no. Hi, everyone. Welcome to another one of our weekly recaps. It's great to have you all here. We have ed, our contributing editor, Alex and Owen, staff reporters and myself, founder of the Defiant. So, yeah, let's go over the main stories that happened in crypto and Defi this week. So big story broke just yesterday, I believe was the latest regulatory action by the SEC.
00:01:28.700 - 00:02:23.238, Speaker B: The SEC sued Kraken, one of the biggest US based centralized exchanges, over its staking program. It's just another sign of us regulators coming down really hard on this industry. We have the three AC founders wanting to make a comeback. They announced the launch of a new project, which we'll get into that, but at the very least, controversial choice to do that. Another somewhat controversial choice was makerdao choosing to compete with Ave in the lending space. So interesting development there in Defi. And those are just a couple of the headlines.
00:02:23.238 - 00:03:08.780, Speaker B: We have more to talk about in the show, so stick around. And as you're joining, if you can give us a like that, really help us, helps us surface in the YouTube algorithm. So would appreciate if you're enjoying the show, then just give us a like. And so let's get started with what I think is the biggest story. Kraken sued by the SEC. Alex, you took this one on with a twist. So if you can walk us through just why Kraken was being sued and then what reaction there was in the.
00:03:10.110 - 00:04:22.078, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's interesting, right? Earlier this week, the CEO of another crypto exchange, Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, jumped on Twitter to say that there were rumors the US government would crack down on staking and everybody went on high alert. Right. What does that mean that there are rumors? What does it mean exactly, that they would try to get rid of staking for retail customers in the US? We found out the very next day the SEC had sued Kraken for its staking as a service offering. So for anybody who's unfamiliar to secure Ethereum, you need to kind of lock up your ETH and you get a modest annual reward in return. Doing that on your own is quite difficult. There are some decentralized protocols, like Lido and rocket pool, that make it easier, but then decentralized exchanges also offer a service similar to that. So Kraken was doing that, and the SEC alleged that its staking as a service product was an unregistered security.
00:04:22.078 - 00:05:26.286, Speaker C: So any security, any stock has to be registered with the SEC. And rather than fight the lawsuit, Kraken settled as part of its agreement, it had to pay a $30 million fine, and then it also agreed to end its staking program in the US. So anybody outside the United States can still stake their ether through Kraken. For folks in the US, that program ended the day of the settlement. Everything was effectively unstaked. And there are kind of like two ways to look at it, right? So there are a lot of folks who see this as just another salvo in the Biden administration's attempt to really strangle the crypto industry. But there are other people who have a more class, have full approach where they see this as kind of a handout to decentralization.
00:05:26.286 - 00:06:13.010, Speaker C: Right, so Gensler, so far, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the SEC, went after Kraken. Remains to be seen what he's going to do with Coinbase, which also offers a similar product. But people are kind of assuming that he's not going to go after Lido or rocket pool, the decentralized alternatives. And you saw that in the market. So after Brian Armstrong's tweet about rumors, their governance tokens shot up, and especially after the announcement of the SEC settlement, they've really been on a roll. So people are kind of betting that what's bad for Kraken and centralized exchanges might be good for the kind of purer side of the DeFi ecosystem.
00:06:19.130 - 00:06:52.720, Speaker B: I think what's interesting here is how it looks like the SEC has a way to really just limit adoption in the US. And whether DeFi can be a way to counter that, I don't know. What do you guys think? I mean, do you think Lido and rocketball, do they provide a viable alternative to things like Kraken and Coinbase? Yeah. What do you guys.
00:06:53.030 - 00:07:55.970, Speaker A: I think that it's a little dangerous to try and guess what the SEC is thinking in terms of motivation. I don't think that the SEC cares about Defi. At mean, I think that they're doing this because they have a very simple and straightforward policy, is that all these investment contracts, securities, all of these offerings that are in the cryptocurrency space, whether they're DeFi or CPI, have to be registered with full disclosures for retail investors, full stop. And they're beginning with the big ones. They're beginning with the likes of Kraken. They're probably going to do something with Coinbase. We know that they've investigated Coinbase in the past and they're sending a very strong message, which is you can't just operate outside the perimeter and think you're immune to federal security laws.
00:07:55.970 - 00:08:26.458, Speaker A: And they're not asking crypto to do something particularly difficult. I mean, this isn't like come up with cold fusion or something. I mean, this is just registering their offerings with the securities and Exchange Commission. It's filling out forms. I mean, this is something that companies in finance do all the. It's. It's part of being a mature company in a maturing industry.
00:08:26.458 - 00:08:45.380, Speaker A: And I think that's really the only message the SEC is trying to give, is like they're looking at cracking and they're saying, is it really worth $30 million to not get your lawyers to fill out some documents and submit them to the SEC and register your offering? I mean, is that really the hill you want to die on?
00:08:46.310 - 00:09:01.660, Speaker B: I wonder why they don't do it. Is it just a lot of legal overhead, or is it something about registering that makes it impossible to.
00:09:03.070 - 00:09:35.894, Speaker A: I think it's anathema to a lot of DeFi protocols. There's a core value at stake here. And this is why DeFi and CFI are both kind of, at least until now, have been holding their ground, which is like, we're not traditional finance. We shouldn't be subject to the same rules and regs that Wall street is, and what the SEC is, you know, yeah, you're something new. Blockchain, cool, whatever. But you're going to have to register anything. You sell the public, full stop.
00:09:36.092 - 00:09:37.782, Speaker D: And that's the message that's being sent.
00:09:37.836 - 00:10:09.920, Speaker A: And it'll be really interesting to see if this case, as the SEC hopes, changes decision making and behavior. And when it comes to Defi, though, that's an open question. And Alex, I can't wait to see the next stories that you write on this, because regulating DeFi is not the same thing as regulating CFI. I mean, DeFi is rather amorphous, isn't it? That is cut from a different cloth. So how that shakes out remains to be.
00:10:10.690 - 00:11:14.930, Speaker C: And Cammy, I see that you pulled up this video from Gary Gensler. This actually gets to an interesting wrinkle in this case. So crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro is somebody that you've interviewed for the podcast. Something that he noted is that there's an aspect of Kraken's staking offering that actually would have complicated its attempt to defend itself from the SEC lawsuit. So although the SEC would probably disagree on this, Shapiro and others make the argument that a staking service shouldn't be considered a security. But he said that Kraken had done a couple things that made its offering more security esque. So, for example, if you were to just go straight to ethereum yourself, you've got the technical chops and you wanted to be a solo staker, the amount of return that you would get would be determined by the activity on the blockchain.
00:11:14.930 - 00:12:08.198, Speaker C: Kraken, on the other hand, kind of promised its customers a specific return rather than the amount that they should receive, just based on what's happening on Ethereum. So in that sense, it becomes more of a financial product that's managed by Kraken, rather than just a technology that Kraken is offering easier access to. And Coinbase actually kind of jumped on that distinction to argue on Twitter, because where else, that it shouldn't be subject to the same kind of lawsuit that Kraken was. So forget who it was over at Coinbase. I think it was their chief legal officer. But he said of Kraken's product, these are basically yield products. True, on chain staking services like ours are different.
00:12:08.198 - 00:12:50.638, Speaker C: Our customers'rewards are tethered to realities. They depend on the rewards paid by the protocol and the commissions that we disclose. Another thing that Gensler notes in this video, and it's worth quoting him at length, here is what you were saying, ed, the importance of disclosures. So he says, if you sign up for a staking service, you need to have access to certain disclosures. So what are the companies like Kraken actually doing with your tokens? Are they really staking them? Are they lending, borrowing, or trading with them? Are they commingling with them? Where do the rewards come from? Are you getting your fair share? Et cetera, et cetera?
00:12:50.814 - 00:13:04.710, Speaker B: And we saw how important that was with Celsius and other C five players who weren't disclosing what exactly they were doing with customer funds. And we know how that turned.
00:13:07.050 - 00:13:07.570, Speaker D: Great.
00:13:07.660 - 00:13:09.580, Speaker A: That's a great point. Great point.
00:13:10.590 - 00:14:19.230, Speaker B: In crypto, it's like, yes, the crypto industry is so used to seeing regulators and Gary Gensler and the SEC as the bad guys. And of course, none of us, I think, want crypto to be regulated away and I think that's kind of just like the initial reaction to all these regulators is let crypto thrive. Let it be like it's net positive for the world for crypto to exist. So why are you limiting people's access to this great thing? Right? So that's kind of the general narrative within crypto, but I think there's also some nuance there. And I think, Ed, you were kind of pointing towards that, which is these are centralized entities. They are exchanges. Except the only difference is that instead of there being stocks traded on them, there's crypto.
00:14:19.230 - 00:14:46.280, Speaker B: So I think there's a valid argument there, like why should they be living under different rules? In the end, customers are trusting them with their money, so they should be subject to the same safeguards and disclosures that regular tradfi exchanges are. I think that's know, it's hard to get around that.
00:14:47.930 - 00:15:08.014, Speaker A: I think you're right, Cammy, that I think there's probably going to be a mindset shift here. This idea that you're going to regulate crypto out of existence or something, it's hyperbole. I mean, they're not asking for weekly audits or something, they're just asking for a registration. It's pretty simple.
00:15:08.132 - 00:15:09.950, Speaker B: I think the big question here is.
00:15:10.100 - 00:15:38.994, Speaker A: And after 2022, the trust issue is massive. I've talked to a lot of people in DFI who say we need the SEC to do stuff like this to help restore, like, I think there's a lot of hysteria out there about what the SEC is doing, and trust is like a massive factor.
00:15:39.042 - 00:15:39.640, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:41.530 - 00:15:44.090, Speaker A: Know, but we'll see what happens.
00:15:44.240 - 00:16:20.310, Speaker B: I think the big question, I think it's pretty straightforward for CFI. It needs to live under the same regulations of the jurisdiction that those entities are in. I think the question is what happens to, you know, it's, it's not the same. People are self custodying their funds. You're interacting with smart contracts. The SEC can't go to uniswap and tell them you need to kyc your users because it simply cannot do that. You need to have disclosures.
00:16:20.310 - 00:17:33.102, Speaker B: Unisoft itself is not managing user funds. Users are. So there's a big difference there. So I think that's kind of what's still unclear to me is how will regulators deal with DeFi? If they try to apply the same rules and regulations to DeFi, then I think that's a big problem because then there's like nothing DeFi can do about it. So I think that remains to be seen. I hope that regulators are kind of smart enough to see that difference, but, yeah, I think it's too early to say so, Alex, you reported that liquid staking tokens rallied after this sec action because there's the expectation that, okay, if people can't access centralized staking services, they'll go to decentralized ones like Lido and rocket pool. There was another development in Lido this week.
00:17:33.102 - 00:17:37.710, Speaker B: Pretty interesting if you want to go over this story that you covered.
00:17:38.530 - 00:18:23.146, Speaker C: Yeah. So we were talking just now about centralized staking offerings. Lido and rocket pool are on the other side of that spectrum. But even on their side, there's a spectrum. And for people who are really big on decentralization, they're more inclined to champion rocket pool because of the way that it's built and the fact that people have less power as far as kind of like shaping how it operates. Right. It's more hardened, I guess it's more permissionless, to use the favorite phrase of crypto folks.
00:18:23.178 - 00:18:23.374, Speaker D: Right?
00:18:23.412 - 00:19:01.034, Speaker C: So Lido nevertheless is the biggest decentralized staking protocol it has. Like last time I checked, this may have changed, but like 90% of the market share, it is the largest protocol in DFI. I mean, it's bigger than any other ave maker. Dow, uniswap and Lido earlier this week announced a new version of its software. And it's got two important features. One is something that everybody kind of knew would be coming. Every staking protocol has to do this.
00:19:01.034 - 00:19:42.150, Speaker C: They're going to enable withdrawal of Ether that's been staked through them. That's not something that's currently possible. And there's a forthcoming upgrade to Ethereum itself that will enable that. All of the protocols that allow people to stake will also have to upgrade their own software to make it play nice with the upgraded Ethereum. But the other big thing and the thing that I focused on in this story that's going to happen with V Two is Lido is going to take steps toward decentralizing further. So again, everything exists on the spectrum. Certain aspects of Lido's operations are decentralized.
00:19:42.150 - 00:20:36.178, Speaker C: Others, people have more power to kind of affect it in a way that might be antithetical to what's best for Ethereum. This might get a little bit technical, but when you stake ether and lock it up, you need people to run specialized software and hardware in order to do that. That's quite difficult for most people. So Lido kind of pairs the people who have ether and want to stake it with the people who have that hardware and software and know how to actually do the staking. They're called node operators. And people who are on the rocket pool side of things will say we've got the most decentralized set of node operators. If you want to become a node operator, you can, as long as you meet certain criteria.
00:20:36.178 - 00:21:22.850, Speaker C: And it's become popular with small time stakers. For that reason, there are more than 2000 node operators on rocket pool, which is kind of a very rough metric for decentralization and censorship resistance. Lido, on the other hand, out of kind of concerns that there's no way to safely scale a node operator set just yet. Their node operators are still handpicked by the DAO. The DAO itself is a decentralized organization that runs the Lido protocol. But votes are proportionate to the number of governance tokens one has. Those tokens are concentrated in the hands of venture capitalists and other whales.
00:21:22.850 - 00:22:29.930, Speaker C: And so there's a kind of feeling that these critical players, the node operators, because they're handpicked by the Dow, that there is an opportunity there for a bad actor to kind of screw with the way things are run. That fear hasn't actually been realized to date, but it's a weakness. And so Lido is proposing to make it easier to move more toward the rocket pool way of doing things to allow for at home solo stakers, to allow for quote unquote bonded staking, which will make it easier for people with smaller amounts of ether to run a node. And it's something that even people in rocket pool who typically they have kind of a David versus Goliath mentality when they're talking about Lidar, they see it as the big bad pretender in the decentralization space. Even they've shown some kind of cautious optimism that if this is followed through with that, it's going to be a net positive for the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:22:32.930 - 00:23:30.990, Speaker B: Yeah, I think decentralizing staking is key to keeping Ethereum secure. And we've seen kind of in the early days of proof of stake, that stake has become pretty concentrated because people go to exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase to manage their stake, and they concentrate a large portion of the nodes, then Lido is a huge player there, and it leaves kind of smaller solo players at a disadvantage relative to these huge entities. So I think this is good news if it effectively allows greater decentralization within Lido, which is already the biggest player within Ethereum staking. So we'll see how that turns out.
00:23:31.140 - 00:24:28.900, Speaker C: Like you said, it's important to reiterate that although there's kind of this debate among people who are really into decentralization that Lido is relatively decentralized. While rocket pool fans might say Lido isn't as decentralized as we want it to be, there's a bigger threat to Ethereum, and that would be just the centralized staking offered by players like Kraken and Coinbase. I mean, Coinbase debuted a service similar to Lido's last year, and that was rapidly taking market share away from the other liquid staking providers. So while people quibble about whether Lido is decentralized enough, there are actual players in that space that aren't decentralized at all, that have become quite popular just because they're easier to use.
00:24:29.270 - 00:25:39.738, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great point. Just wanted to quickly go back to the SEC staking discussion because we have some good comments there in the stream, so I wanted to highlight those. So Nate Volk says you're defending the SEC extremely hard. The only thing they're doing is protecting us from people like know, like, I hope we're not coming off as defending the SEC. I think what at least my position is is that in the case of centralized crypto players, they're not doing something that's different from all the other exchanges. And I think it makes sense that they provide the same kind of investor protections and kind of disclosures that other exchanges do. Because last year we saw what happens when crypto is in this gray area.
00:25:39.738 - 00:25:59.118, Speaker B: People get hurt. I think there's a risk when the SEC and other regulators try to apply those rules to actually decentralize crypto. I don't think that's right, actually. So I think that's kind of the difference that we should make.
00:25:59.284 - 00:26:08.100, Speaker C: And it's fair to point out that the SEC is a little bit late to the party that they've taken the keys away after the teenager crashed the car.
00:26:08.470 - 00:26:08.978, Speaker B: True.
00:26:09.064 - 00:26:12.050, Speaker C: Yeah, it'd be nice if they could catch.
00:26:13.110 - 00:26:19.860, Speaker A: Regulators are always slow. They're always regulating the last war, not the next one.
00:26:20.230 - 00:26:47.950, Speaker B: And then Gojita says there should be a middle ground. Now it's hardcore djens, adept at self custody, uneducated in crypto, versus enthusiast retail investors that don't want to deal with all the security headaches. Yeah, we do have this huge gap, right. In education within crypto users, the DJs who kind of know how to read ether scan.
00:26:49.490 - 00:27:34.378, Speaker A: That's a really great comment, and thank you for contributing that comment, because it really mirrors what we see in traditional finance, which is you have retail investors who might be novices when it comes to investing. And then you have accredited investors. Sometimes they're called sophisticated investors, but these are professionals, or semi professionals like day traders, who know the ins and outs of how the market works and know all about custody and all the back office stuff. And it's interesting, like, that's replicated in crypto. And clearly the SEC is like, they're not worried about Degen. They're worried about retail investors who are getting in over their heads. And that's the SEC's mandate.
00:27:34.378 - 00:27:37.600, Speaker A: That's why they exist, is to protect those people.
00:27:38.850 - 00:28:11.946, Speaker D: And I guess I would just add that as far as a middle ground, if. If wallets become more mean, it should be as easy as buying re. I mean, I would argue that that is a middle ground that you don't have to be that sophisticated to have access to that yield. So I would say mean Robinhood is working on a more retail friendly wallet. I don't know. I think that's coming, is all I would say.
00:28:12.048 - 00:28:38.866, Speaker B: Yeah, good point. Yeah. And then, speaking of better centralized crypto needed, Owen, you had this story on how the three AC founders wanted to make a comeback. I want to hear more about it. It just seems outrageous. What did you report on? What did you find?
00:28:38.968 - 00:30:02.846, Speaker D: Sure. So when I started reporting on this, I realized that there were kind of rumblings of this that go back to mid January when pitch deck got leaked somehow. And ironically, they were at the time calling their new exchange GTX, because the G comes after f, which is a questionable start, I would say, to associate yourself with the defunct exchange that said, the news that hit yesterday was that they finally came out and said, yes, we're starting an exchange which will offer claims on bankruptcy claims, and that included their own firm, which was interesting because for those who don't know, three arrows collapsed last year around July. Alex was our point person on that, but they had $10 billion, I think, under management. They fell apart. So they're starting this new exchange, and they're offering, and it's a centralized exchange, and they're offering bankruptcy claims on their defunct hedge fund, also on FTX, Celsius, Blockfly, Voyager, all of which we've reported on and have seen go mean. The irony was kind mean in some ways.
00:30:02.846 - 00:31:00.990, Speaker D: It's like, great, there's this redemption story. It's this judo thing where they're saying, oh, we learned so much. We understand how hard the bankruptcy process is. We're going to give liquidity to all these people with claims on these defunct operations, which in some ways, I'm like, yeah, it does sound complicated. That said, these guys partnered with this seemingly almost, I don't know, but Coinflex, not a noteworthy exchange at all, and then adopted the flex token as their own exchanges. Token and Flex has been going up. I mean, I think it's gone up in value by 20 times since the start of the year, which just seems really questionable in terms of who knew that that was going to happen.
00:31:00.990 - 00:31:53.182, Speaker D: And it seems pretty easy for them to position themselves for that announcement. That was the thing. And I talked with Zach XBT briefly about it and he know, kind of unequivocal about being no, like this is he. He trolled them on Twitter and just followed up by saying I could read out his exact tweet. What did he say? He said, yeah, he was very forceful. He said, it's an insult to everyone they hurt as they continuously play victim and evade responsibility. In contrary to what sue and Kyle have claimed, and those are the founders of three AC, Zach really isn't happy.
00:31:53.182 - 00:32:15.990, Speaker D: And there's this thing where it's like, how are you able to do this having, like, because we've written stories about how the founder of Defiance capital, they weren't responding to him. And defiance, who I believe, Alex, maybe you remember, but Defiance had invested in three AC, I believe, and they didn't have any visibility that three AC was underwater.
00:32:16.810 - 00:33:05.426, Speaker B: We should kind of just remind. It's worth kind of remembering that the fact that these guys, it's not like they had a hedge fund and maybe they made bad investment bets. What they did was actually lie. And that's the issue. It's like no investor is perfect. No investor is, and every investor can kind of makes mistakes and nobody can fault them for that, especially in this market. The issue was that they were borrowing from all these centralized lenders and from DeFi lenders, but they were borrowing based on lies.
00:33:05.426 - 00:33:50.790, Speaker B: They were saying they had more money than they actually did. And we've seen some really just, like, laughable emails surface where they were like, yes, we have, I don't know, 10 billion in our balance sheet. Thanks, too. And no audited statements or anything like that to prove the money that they actually had. And they just kept borrowing and borrowing in this way out of just, like, very fraudulent statements. So I think this is the issue. And then when Luna collapsed, that was the domino that set everything in motion and meant that they had all these debtors kind of knocking.
00:33:50.790 - 00:34:47.174, Speaker B: And so that caused a huge amount of damage because then blockfi Celsius, I can't remember exactly which lender they had used. But that meant that now these players were left with no money because three AC wasn't good for their loans. So that meant that these users of those platforms were hurt, too. So it wasn't an innocent thing that happened. It hurt a lot of people in crypto. So I just think it's crazy to see that a couple of months after that whole thing crashed and after hurting so many people in the space, they're able to raise 25 million. Allegedly, that's kind of what the deck said.
00:34:47.174 - 00:35:20.290, Speaker B: I think. They raised 25 million. I don't know who's investing, and they're able to just come back with this new platform, which is funny. It's like, okay, if we hurt you, now, you have a way to sell your claim. I don't know. There's something that is very off about that whole thing. That's obviously my own personal opinion, but it doesn't look good to me.
00:35:20.440 - 00:35:49.500, Speaker A: Yeah, don't forget, just as an addendum, sorry, I just wanted to add a little grace note to what Cammie was saying is that three AC created its own contagion too, right? I mean, its contagion spread throughout crypto as well, so it isn't like a hedge fund blew up and. Oh, too bad for the. This is a market wide issue and for these guys to come back. I mean, no wonder Zach is.
00:35:53.470 - 00:36:06.500, Speaker D: Yeah, I just was going to add, know, throwing the story forward that Zach said he is putting out a bounty to try to find out who's investing because he seemed pretty.
00:36:07.510 - 00:36:09.700, Speaker A: Got Zach on the case now.
00:36:11.350 - 00:36:19.890, Speaker D: He said he sent us a message if and when he figures that out, so just stay tuned. Hopefully that crosses the lines.
00:36:20.050 - 00:36:20.838, Speaker B: I'd love to.
00:36:20.924 - 00:36:22.674, Speaker A: Really, really great reporting, Owen.
00:36:22.802 - 00:36:24.840, Speaker D: Yeah, he's a nice guy.
00:36:26.250 - 00:36:31.340, Speaker B: And then this token, that's like, also, what is this? When did it start?
00:36:32.750 - 00:36:46.800, Speaker D: I'd have to look it up, but, yeah, it's not my place to, I don't know, say nefarious things are done, but some people were joking about the insider trading. They're like, this is insane. Like, you could have just.
00:36:47.650 - 00:37:19.642, Speaker B: You don't have to make calls about insider trading, but it's just, like, a fact that the token, look what it started to do February 1, it started to just go crazy. And this announcement was done yesterday, so somebody knew that this was coming. There's no reason why this flex token would have had that rally otherwise. So I don't know. It's just, like, very questionable to say the least, right? I don't know.
00:37:19.776 - 00:37:23.820, Speaker D: They got to buy their yacht back. Right. It's like it's 30 mil.
00:37:26.110 - 00:37:28.666, Speaker C: I think that's already been sold. Oh, really?
00:37:28.768 - 00:37:35.070, Speaker D: All right, well, there's a price for everything. Self flex tokens anyways.
00:37:35.650 - 00:38:08.274, Speaker B: But, yeah, I don't know. I think crypto has a very short lived memory. People. In this space, there's just like a lot of greed. So moving on to the next topic, AI. And it's touching crypto, too. It's crazy, all the developments that have happened in AI this year.
00:38:08.274 - 00:38:33.218, Speaker B: It looks like it's kind of the next big tech story after crypto, it seems. It really is kind of changing. I think it'll change the way we interact with everything. I think there's no going back. And so there's a crypto story there in AI related tokens rallying and Owen, you had this story, too.
00:38:33.384 - 00:38:58.882, Speaker D: Yeah, at a high level. Woke up on, I believe it was Tuesday morning. And, yeah, the graphs GRT token was just ripping. It was up like 60%. And that was very strange. So we decided to do a market story to figure out what was going on there. And a couple other tokens were ripping, too, and those were categorically positioned as AI tokens.
00:38:58.882 - 00:40:00.300, Speaker D: And having done a little digging, it also seemed like, I think a lot of it, I talked to one trader, and a lot of it was because coinmarketcap categorized GRT as an AI token. So it was like their top AI token. And I think a lot of people were trading based on that. And it was strange, too, because there are all these traders with hundreds of thousands of followers who are tweeting about GRT as an AI play, but I'd never even heard of the traders. And it just makes me feel like there's some weird social media ecosystem, which I don't understand, which is doing very different things than kind of the news I follow day to day. So that's what it was. They have continued to, I think, like queries, I guess, active subgraphs, which are, I don't totally understand, but are ways in which data is indexed, which basically means wrapping it up in a way which is accessible to people.
00:40:00.300 - 00:40:48.058, Speaker D: Blockchain data continued to go up, and it's like up 151% year over year, according to a Masari report. So the graph has a lot of momentum, and so it picked up that move. I think it's still up today, actually. So, yeah, it's kind of interesting to see how a categorization of a token can really propel it forward. And I talked to Tegan Klein, who's part of edge and node, which is a big company, kind of spun out from that, launched the graph protocol, and now they're one of the big companies kind of contributing to it. And she just said that GRT is looking, or the graph is looking at various AI solutions. They gave a $60 million grant to a startup in that line of thinking.
00:40:48.058 - 00:41:32.890, Speaker D: And I thought one of the interesting things that she gave us was that they were investigating how to do kind of chat GPT like queries. So the thing could be like, you would type in like, show me the top five traded tokens on uniswap and you could potentially just get a response. So anyone who's tried to use dune analytics or something, you know that you have to know some SQL in order to make these queries, but it'd be interesting to take it that next. Yeah. And just finally chat GBT, obviously amazing growth is behind all of this hype, and we're still kind of wrestling with that. And there's a debate about how AI is going to interact with crypto.
00:41:35.070 - 00:42:19.494, Speaker B: I wouldn't kind of overestimate crypto traders. I don't think that they're looking at the Mesari report and being like, oh, yeah, the graph had so much growth in their subgraph. So let me buy, like, I think it was probably what, you know, people looking at, oh, which are AI related tokens. Let me buy that up. And GRG just happened to be there, even though it sounded like what they're doing with AI is really preliminary. They're just like studying how to start using chat GBT and their queries. And it doesn't look like it's something that's happening or driving growth.
00:42:19.494 - 00:42:34.080, Speaker B: Right. Know, the market is pretty hype based, so it's to be expected that AI related tokens will be taking.
00:42:35.810 - 00:43:16.746, Speaker D: Yeah. And there's a larger debate, which I think Andre Kranye was kind of kicking off saying AI and blockchain, this is all hype. Like, these actually don't mix yet. And some people, I think Joseph, I believe, is how you say his name of Dragonfly was saying that no AIs are going to be, are going to be holding crypto tokens all the time and they're going to need them to distribute their services. So I think there's a whole bunch of research to do. I mean, self custody on the stream is asking, what's the business model for AI tokens? It reminded me a little of 2017 when everyone was just like, slap a blockchain on it. We'll work everything out later.
00:43:16.746 - 00:43:26.430, Speaker D: So I think there's a deep dive that we as writers can do to understand, separate the way from the chaff.
00:43:27.810 - 00:44:06.954, Speaker B: Yeah. Hopefully we will be talking more about that in our next recap. I'd love to dig deeper on that, which are the actual legit crypto AI projects out there. Where can the two technologies actually work together? Where's kind of the synergy? I don't know. And I don't know if you guys know of kind of. What are the big projects in AI and crypto out there?
00:44:07.152 - 00:44:21.200, Speaker D: I don't know. The legit ones. Yeah. I mean, I reported on some POB, actually just said he thought self rebalancing uniswap LPs could be an interesting. So, yeah, I'm sure we'll see a.
00:44:24.050 - 00:45:16.386, Speaker B: Yeah, I do think this technology has the potential of really kind of starting to permeate everything, so why not crypto? But yeah, see exactly how it's really mean. This is like completely off topic of crypto, but I was just seeing yesterday, I didn't know the battle between Google and Microsoft that's in AI. I think that's so fascinating. So if OpenAI is the AI company to win and Microsoft is backing it, and then AI, like, makes bing the new kind of default search engine, that would be like the tech comeback of the world.
00:45:16.488 - 00:45:17.730, Speaker D: That'd be legendary.
00:45:18.470 - 00:45:22.366, Speaker B: Imagine that, like beating over Google inserts.
00:45:22.398 - 00:45:25.426, Speaker C: In ten years saying, just bing it. Yeah.
00:45:25.528 - 00:45:27.190, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Can you imagine?
00:45:27.530 - 00:45:32.102, Speaker D: It'd be like if like next computer won, like when Steve Jobs tried to start next or something.
00:45:32.156 - 00:46:07.534, Speaker B: I don't even mean that would be such an interesting story arc there for Microsoft. So that was a great play. And then I was looking at the Google announcement of their AI and it was horrible. I don't know if you guys saw it. No, it was really an embarrassment. So I don't know, I was surprised. Microsoft seemed like such a, like, company and now it's like all the rage.
00:46:07.534 - 00:46:38.940, Speaker B: It's so funny. Anyways, Alex, this is an alpha leak here. We haven't actually put this story out, but worth talking about this uniswap, a 16 C vote debate that's happening. Do you want to kind of go through that story? When are we aiming to publish it?
00:46:40.290 - 00:47:26.220, Speaker C: Later today. Yeah. And that vote actually ended this morning, so it's timely. But what's going on is uniswap has licensed code to its latest version, V three, and it's kind of standard in crypto to open source code. And so that's actually going to happen with V three on April 1 that's when this license expires. And when that happens, the typical crypto stuff, everybody's going to be able to take that code and copy it and deploy their own version of Uniswap if they want. They can iterate on it, they can improve it.
00:47:26.220 - 00:49:00.822, Speaker C: If they so choose, slip something malicious in there, anything that's generally encouraged in crypto to take somebody else's code and then see if you can build on it and make it better. But there's also an issue with that, which is that it can kind of create chaos, right? So there can be lots of copycats out there, and uniswap is trying to get ahead of that. So when the license ends, they're expecting a lot of uniswap clones to pop up on different blockchains. The issue with that there is that if they ever chose to go to those blockchains in the future, even if it's not called uniswap on that other blockchain, the fact that it's the same technology means that if they've already got a whole bunch of market share, there might not be a reason for people to use uniswap whenever it gets there, right? So they're trying to get ahead of that. And also to make sure that if uniswap exists on Ethereum and on binance and what have you, that it's all still essentially one organization. That when a decision is made on Ethereum, that it kind of reflects everywhere else that the original canonical uniswap exists. So they've already deployed to a couple other chains, but it wasn't controversial, because when they made that decision, those other chains were typically like side chains or L2s.
00:49:00.822 - 00:49:53.486, Speaker C: So they have their own built in technology that allows them to connect to Uniswap on Ethereum, the original one. But in December, somebody suggested that they deploy to BNB, which is the blockchain that was built by binance. BNB is really popular in the developing world. Aside from Ethereum, it probably has the most users. The issue is that it doesn't have any native bridge technology to connect it to Ethereum. And so it kicked off a debate, which bridge would we use? And it's an important decision, because as anybody who follows crypto has seen in the past year, bridges have become the super lucrative target for hackers. I mean, hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost to bridge hacks in 2022.
00:49:53.486 - 00:50:34.902, Speaker C: And so it's not trivial choosing which one is going to serve as the connector between Ethereum and B and B so there was a lengthy debate. It was polite, but it was intense. Bunch of bridge protocols raised their hand and said, hey, pick us. Analysts jumped in and kind of looked at their code and said, well, we see some of these issues here. And then the bridges would come back with their rebuttal and answering the questions, and eventually a vote was taken. They kind of narrowed it down. They said, there are these four that people seem to be talking about the most.
00:50:34.902 - 00:51:10.786, Speaker C: We're going to pick one of these four to serve as the bridge. And it was around this time that Andreessen Horowitz jumped in. They're the venture capital firm in crypto. They've raised the most money. I think it's approaching 8 billion over their four funds. They've got a stake in almost every major defi protocol, including uniswap. And when a venture capital firm invests in a crypto company, just like when they invest in a traditional company, they might receive a stake in that company.
00:51:10.786 - 00:52:16.422, Speaker C: The crypto version is getting some share of a protocol's governance tokens so that they can have a say in what happens. A 16 Z has millions and millions and millions of uni tokens. And they jumped in the debate to say, hey, we took a look at the different bridges, and our pick is layer zero. We think they're the best bridge to connect uniswap to BNB. They also put out a, you know, we just want to let everybody know we invested in layer zero, but still, we think it's the best option. And there's a lot of skepticism in crypto when it comes to vcs and whether they're acting in the best interest of the protocols that they invest in. And so people were quick to suggest, well, you're only doing this because layer zero is one of your portfolio companies for technical reasons that aren't worth getting into.
00:52:16.422 - 00:52:50.978, Speaker C: They weren't able to actually participate in that vote to choose a bridge. Had they done so, layer zero would have likely won. They didn't. So wormhole was chosen a competing bridge protocol. But a 16 Z said, okay, we weren't able to vote in that one. But for the real vote, the last one, where we're going to decide whether we do, in fact, deploy to B and B, we're going to be able to vote in that, and we're going to vote against it, and we're going to put all 15 million tokens that we have in voting against it. Ultimately, it didn't matter.
00:52:50.978 - 00:53:27.002, Speaker C: The vote ended this morning with about two thirds. Yeah, exactly. And so you see there. A 16 Z is the big no vote. That Jesse Walden, that's the founder of another crypto VC variant blockchain at UCLA, was the third big no vote. But a 16 Z saw that criticism and pushed back. So they're pointing out, okay, hey, yeah, we've got a lot of uni tokens.
00:53:27.002 - 00:53:51.442, Speaker C: We voted with 15 million of them. It's the single largest vote that was cast in this debate. But they actually have more. They've got, I believe, a total of like 55 million uni tokens. But they give most of it away. Now, it's still theirs, but they kind of loan it to other people that are active in governance.
00:53:51.586 - 00:53:52.626, Speaker B: Delegates.
00:53:52.818 - 00:54:14.894, Speaker C: Yeah, delegates. Exactly. As a way to kind of a gesture of goodwill, a way to diminish this massive power they would otherwise have in any particular protocol. And so a popular destination or popular delegates for a 16 Z are like university groups. So like the student enthusiasts at various universities who.
00:54:14.932 - 00:54:19.870, Speaker B: Do you know if this UCLA vote was a 16 C's?
00:54:20.690 - 00:54:35.886, Speaker C: I've been told that UCLA is an a 16 Z delegate. But now also, something that's ironic is that a lot of the votes for the deployment. So the people that were voting in opposition to a 16 Z are also their delegates.
00:54:36.078 - 00:54:36.866, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:54:37.048 - 00:54:48.506, Speaker C: GFX labs blockchain in Michigan, a couple of others. I think Monit supply, which you see down there at the bottom of that list, might be as well. But I'm not certain on that.
00:54:48.688 - 00:54:50.300, Speaker B: I don't think so. No.
00:54:53.150 - 00:55:33.874, Speaker C: Go ahead. I spoke to the co founder of GFX Labs. They're an a 16 Z delegate. And he told me when we become a delegate, they give us a piece of paper to sign that says, among other things, a 16 Z isn't going to pressure you to vote in a certain way. Now, people can choose to believe that or not. He insists that that is in fact the case that he's never been told how to vote. And obviously, in this case, he voted to deploy using wormhole, as did blockchain of Michigan, and believed several other people to whom a 16 Z had delegated tokens.
00:55:33.874 - 00:56:11.460, Speaker C: But it was just an interesting kind of case study in how traditional finance venture firms, they'll try to influence decisions of the portfolio companies they have. But it all happens behind closed doors in crypto. It happens publicly and it makes it really easy to get out and kind of see, I guess, malicious intent. Really, it's just kind of like typical investor stuff, right?
00:56:13.990 - 00:57:42.502, Speaker B: I don't think it's about malicious intent. I think it's about whether the system I think the debate is kind of whether this governance system is structured correctly. If it allows for just big players to come in and swing the vote, I think that's the issue, because I don't think anyone can blame a 16 C for using their tokens and voting in the way that benefits them. It's free markets, it's what they're going to do. Exactly. That's the whole point of participating in governance, is using your tokens to have a say and to pick whatever outcome is best for you, and that's what they're doing. But I think the question is, is this one token, one vote governance mechanism the right thing for DeFi when it's supposed to be decentralized? If one single VC can come and effectively run a protocol, then it's not really centralized, because ASICs and C voluntarily chose to delegate their tokens.
00:57:42.502 - 00:58:02.200, Speaker B: But they could very easily. One day, if the issue is big enough and it's hurting them enough, they could easily say, I'm not delegating tokens for this vote, and I'll just use my full power to sway the vote. They could do that.
00:58:03.450 - 00:58:33.994, Speaker C: In this case, 55 million votes were cast for the deployment using wormhole, and then 28 were cast against it. So if you take 40 million yes votes away and give it to the no side, that totally changes the outcome. And it's no wonder that people get nervous about it. Even if a 16 is well within its rights to vote however it pleases.
00:58:34.122 - 00:58:52.678, Speaker A: And don't forget the D five protocols. They don't have to accept VC money. I mean, no one's forcing them to do that. They can say, sorry, we don't want that kind of control, we don't want a VC kind of bigfooting us in any way, shape or form. We don't want that risk at all. So thanks, but no thanks, but keep your money.
00:58:52.764 - 00:58:58.042, Speaker B: But at the same time, VCs can go to the open market and just buy as many tokens as they want.
00:58:58.176 - 00:58:59.900, Speaker D: Yeah, that's true, too.
00:59:02.990 - 00:59:16.590, Speaker A: What would be the impetus to do that, though? Why would they do that? And I don't think their limited partners would be too happy. If a VC fund suddenly turned into a hedge fund, it would violate the fiduciary duty to their LPs.
00:59:17.570 - 00:59:35.422, Speaker B: It depends on the VC. Maybe a 16 C is traditional enough and it's big enough that it has to kind of comply to more traditional LPs, but there are many, just like that's all contractual.
00:59:35.486 - 00:59:36.858, Speaker A: I mean, that's just a matter of contract.
00:59:36.894 - 01:00:13.710, Speaker B: Sure, but there's other more like crypto native VCs with LPs that are in it for exactly that, for vcs to act more like hedge funds. And in crypto, the line between hedge funds and VCs is starting to get blurred because VCs have liquid instruments a lot sooner than they usually would. They just have tokens, they have liquidity, they're participating in governance, they're even yield farming. So they are acting a bit like hedge funds.
01:00:15.890 - 01:00:35.990, Speaker D: Savio made a great point, which is that this modem mechanism is less corruptible than the traditional systems. And I just agree, Alex wouldn't be able to write this story, which is complicated, but he wouldn't be able to write it without blockchains and crypto. So just from a meta perspective, it's pretty fascinating that we can see this and debate this at all.
01:00:36.140 - 01:00:36.742, Speaker B: Absolutely.
01:00:36.876 - 01:01:22.418, Speaker A: No, I think that's absolutely right. That's why this is so newsworthy is because it's exceptionally rare to see a VC firm clash with a portfolio company, especially a portfolio company at the scale of Uniswap, a company that's so important in its marketplace. And Alex, you made the point best, and we'll highlight this in your story, that in the traditional world that happens behind closed doors, but in crypto defi, the information is out there. This is a much more democratic process. You can actually see the vote, you can report on it, you can talk to delegates, et cetera. And that's what's different. That's what's really fascinating.
01:01:22.594 - 01:01:27.946, Speaker B: Exactly. I mean, as Florida as it is, it's better than the old way. Yeah.
01:01:27.968 - 01:01:30.570, Speaker D: Come on. We got a cute infographic.
01:01:34.190 - 01:01:55.410, Speaker B: Yeah. All right. Adorable. I think that pretty much wraps it up. Wraps the big stories of the week. Are we missing anything? Anyone want to add another headline?
01:01:56.310 - 01:02:06.870, Speaker C: Optimism had its second airdrop yesterday, so for people who've been kind of farming for that one, go check your wallet.
01:02:07.290 - 01:02:07.750, Speaker B: Nice.
01:02:07.820 - 01:02:09.074, Speaker C: See if you succeeded.
01:02:09.202 - 01:02:10.200, Speaker B: Nice. Thanks.
01:02:12.330 - 01:02:55.678, Speaker D: Maybe my headline would be flux finance is live, which is basically. But basically it allows people to collateralize tokenized ETFs, which represent treasuries. And then people can, like crypto users at large, can lend to those people who are collateralizing and borrowing. So I think it's just going to shake up lending if the base rate is somewhat close, because right now you're getting like one point something percent on ave and compound for stables, but now for USDC and Dai, you're going to maybe be able to get close to treasury rates on Ondo. So I just think that's something to watch and see how that shakes up.
01:02:55.784 - 01:03:20.942, Speaker B: Very cool. And then we also had the story on Makerdao challenging Ave with a lender. So yeah, that was another interesting story that we covered. So yeah, I think with that, we're good to wrap for this week. Thanks everyone for joining and catch you all next week.
01:03:21.076 - 01:03:22.810, Speaker D: Thanks guys. Bye.
