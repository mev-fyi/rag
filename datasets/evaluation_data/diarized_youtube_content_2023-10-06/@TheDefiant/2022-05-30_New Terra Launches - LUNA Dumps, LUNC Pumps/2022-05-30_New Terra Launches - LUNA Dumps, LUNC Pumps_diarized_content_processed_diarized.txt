00:00:00.520 - 00:00:55.715, Speaker A: So it's been a traumatic couple of weeks in crypto, hasn't it? Hasn't it? And the drama continued last week with the Ethereum beacon chain suffering a seven block reorg when some but not all nodes failed to upgrade the validator software in time. The market reacted well, as you'd expect, with ETH selling off violently down to the low 1700s before mounting a recovery over the weekend. And Bitcoin is also looking green this morning, breaking back above 30k, although on low volume, so we shall have to see whether it can stay there. But the biggest news of course, was the launch of the brand new spanking shiny Terra blockchain, also known as Phoenix 1 on the 28th. Phoenix 1 rising from the ashes or descending straight back into them? I don't know. But what happened next and how are the new tokens doing? Well, we'll find out after these messages. In 2021, Ethereum traders lost over $200 million to malicious bots exploiting their trades.
00:00:55.715 - 00:01:42.335, Speaker A: As DeFi continues to gain popularity, this number is expected to rise. EDA Network is a next generation private transaction service for Ethereum, providing traders with MEV protection by submitting transactions directly to miners and away from the prying eyes of harmful bots. Using Eden Network for Ethereum transactions results in better and safer trades. Eden Network recently launched Eden Rocket RPC which compiles some of Ethereum's fastest private transaction Networks, resulting in 19% plus effective hashrate. This makes Eden Rocket RPC the fastest private transaction network available, protecting you from bots. Join the best and get started with Eden Network today and trade safer. So look, this was a big moment.
00:01:42.335 - 00:02:24.549, Speaker A: The new Terra blockchain began producing blocks, but of course this is only the beginning and it's crazy to think how quickly we have come to this place where Terra is. I mean, it's a joke, it's a punchline, right? So we now have this messy situation of two separate chains with different validators and different philosophies driving them forward. If you held Luna UST or AUST on the old chain, then you will have been airdropped tokens according to the vesting schedule. These vesting tokens can still be delegated to validator nodes, but you won't be able to do anything else with them until they have been fully vested and there's a six month cliff. So yeah, basically that's what's going to happen now. You still own those old tokens by the way. They haven't gone anywhere, they've just been given a new ticker.
00:02:24.549 - 00:03:02.855, Speaker A: So Luna is becomes Luna Classic Lunc UST becomes UST Classic or ustc. The new Luna token. Well, it opened positively enough at around $18.87 on Saturday before dropping as low as $4.39. It has since recovered to $5.96, but the sentiment on crypto Twitter was very much Amateur boxer Luke Martin quips that the only reason to buy Luna 2.0 is to qualify for the next airdrop of Luna 3.0.
00:03:02.855 - 00:03:38.619, Speaker A: RT goes to zero like Luna 1.0. Oh, how droll. Luke failing to grasp that the death spiral threat has in fact been removed from Terra 2.0. But he may have a point here, as there is a messy amount of airdrop action still to come. Binance, for instance, has announced it will list Terra 2.0 in its innovation Zone, a dedicated trading area for high risk and volatile assets. Binance itself is due to receive a monster monster airdrop of Luna, and we can actually use terrafinder to see just how much.
00:03:38.619 - 00:04:17.767, Speaker A: Here is the Binance address and it's sitting on a liquid. Liquid not vested 15,773,486 tokens with nearly 37 million still to vest. These will unlock on Tuesday and be transferred to Binance users immediately. So what are they going to do? Well, most will likely sell immediately to recover whatever they can from the debacle. A race to the bottom Meanwhile, Luna Classic. You know, the old Luna, the one that everyone just dumped to hell? It's up 100% in the last 24 hours. I mean, read into that what you will.
00:04:17.767 - 00:05:17.339, Speaker A: Is that the community backing Lunc in a show of strength against Do Kwon? Or will they simply add an H to the end and make it lunch and have fun eating that? Maybe it's just opportunism, I don't know. But what about UST itself, that stablecoin? Well, proposal 1747 to burn 1.388 billion UST stablecoins has now passed and will reduce UST supply by around 11% of its current circulating supply, which is around 11 billion or so. This is primarily aimed at reducing the bad debt within the Terra Classic economy and to restore the stablecoins pegged by burning tokens in the community pool because the Lunar UST burn mechanism can't actually function fast enough to clear it out in time. So with UST currently at $0.03, albeit up 20% on the day, it still feels like an almighty mountain to climb. But I mean, it's still there, it's not going anywhere.
00:05:17.339 - 00:05:44.807, Speaker A: And maybe maybe, just maybe, in a year's time, we'll look back on this and think, my God, what a recovery. But, hey, who knows? So that's it for today's quick take. We'll be picking up part two of our stablecoin analysis tomorrow, digging around in maker frax and magic Internet money. Till then, don't forget to subscribe if you're not, tell a friend if they're not, tell them to tell a friend if they're not. And let's get this party started. Oh, and just take a beat on Luna and Luna Classic. The volatility is insane.
00:05:44.807 - 00:05:49.575, Speaker A: You probably will get burned. And for now, I will just say this. Peace.
