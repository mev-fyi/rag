00:00:00.330 - 00:00:36.050, Speaker A: It's Tuesday, people. That means it's time for a tutorial. And today we're gonna look at the weird and wonderful world of becoming a liquidity provider. Now, I realize some of the tutorials we have done have been kind of on the advanced side, but there's also some simpler things that we can look at. And liquidity provision should be simple, but it kind of feels like this weird and wacky wild west of ideas that are very, very difficult to get into. But essentially the reason I wanted to cover it is because don't let high gas costs keep you out of Ethereum. At balancer, you can trade all you want and get most of the gas costs back in your pocket.
00:00:36.050 - 00:01:29.962, Speaker A: In the new Bal for gas campaign, traders are receiving six figures worth of Bal tokens every week. And with version two just around the corner, Balancer is becoming the one stop shop for DFI. Liquidity balancer version two brings stable pools and weighted pools tightly integrated under a single protocol. Flash loans, lending via asset managers, and much more. Check it out at balancer finance. Now somebody, where are my keys? I think one of the most attractive things about crypto for me is that if you're an entrepreneur and you think entrepreneurially, there are opportunities everywhere to carve out a little piece of revenue creation for yourself all over the place. And just dipping a toe into becoming a liquidity provider is a great way to gain access to that idea.
00:01:29.962 - 00:02:48.370, Speaker A: And what do we mean by a liquidity provider? Well, if we're looking at amms, automated market makers, which power Dexs, like uniswap, like Bancorp, then instead of there being like a bunch of tokens sitting on an exchange, which allow you to trade freely between one another, the liquidity is provided by the users, which is you. So it's peer to peer, it's decentralized, and anyone who has tokens can put those tokens into a pool, and then that powers trading between people who want to use the decks. And it doesn't happen for free, there's 0.3% of every trade is then put into a pool. And if you own a piece of that liquidity provision pool, then you get a piece of the action. And effectively, the way this works is you have two sides of a trade, so two sides of a pair, like for instance, ETH and dai, and you need an equal amount of tokens on both sides, an equal amount of ETH, an equal amount of dai, those go into a pool. In return, you get a token, which is your LP token, and that LP token then represents your right to future profit from any trades that are performed against that pair.
00:02:48.370 - 00:03:36.178, Speaker A: That's sort of simplifying a little bit, but that's effectively what happens now. You don't see that profit until you burn the token. So once you want to withdraw your liquidity from the pool, your LP token will be burnt and you'll receive back the assets that you had there in the first place, and you will also receive your share of the profits. That's it. So how do we go about doing this? Well, we're going to jump in via uniswap. And the reason we're going to start with Uniswap, even though there's tons of other exchanges that you can look at, is that effectively what has happened with uniswap is every single project, every single protocol in the space has forked uniswap or has done their own version of it. And you've seen this everywhere, and it's kind of remarkable when you look at it.
00:03:36.178 - 00:04:03.542, Speaker A: So if we go to quickswap, which is the Matic Dex, and you look at the interface, let's just go into Uniswap itself here. So you look at the uniswap interface, and it has retained this elegant simplicity of just, you want to swap this thing for another thing. Done. But we look at this and then we go to the matic one. I mean, it's identical. That's because they forked it. They literally just did a complete clone.
00:04:03.542 - 00:04:40.626, Speaker A: Look at Viperswap, which is the harmony Dex. It's identical. So the point is, if you understand how to provide liquidity on uniswap, that basically means you can provide liquidity on any Dex, pretty much. And they all kind of use the same methodology. But really all of these uniswap clones are then places where you can provide liquidity. And the reason you might want to do that is because on other chains, you're likely to get more favorable returns, obviously balanced against greater risk, because there's less liquidity there and more chance of being rug pulled. But it means that you can go hunting wherever you want to look for opportunities.
00:04:40.626 - 00:05:21.086, Speaker A: And that's a good thing, because you're an entrepreneur and you want to provide liquidity and earn money. So how do we go about doing this? Well, there's a couple of things you're going to have to kind of wrap your head around. The first is this. Normally, when you provide liquidity, as I said before, you have to provide an equal amount of both sides of the trade. So ETH to die equal amounts of ETH and die. And how is that factored? Well, it's factored in dollars. So when you want to go and set up a liquidity pool, it will ask you for that, it will ask you to provide X amount of this and x amount of that, which can be a bit annoying because let's say you've invested in one token and you go, yeah, I want to provide liquidity.
00:05:21.086 - 00:05:56.202, Speaker A: I've got a buttload of this token. Suddenly you're confronted with the idea that you actually have to match the value of that token with an equal value of another token. And suddenly it's like, oh crap. It's not as easy as I thought, but that's kind of just the way it works. What we're going to look at is a method for bypassing that, but we'll get into that in a second. So if we start on uniswap, just going to close these pages, you're going to want to go up to the pool tab up here and you'll get this kind of really simple thing. It says liquidity provider rewards.
00:05:56.202 - 00:06:26.034, Speaker A: Liquidity providers earn a 0.3% fee on all trades proportional to their share of the pool. Fees are added to the pool, accrue in real time, and can be claimed by withdrawing your liquidity. And as you can see here, I'm actually already providing liquidity to the ETH visor pool. This is not a shills advisor, it's just a personal thing that I'm looking into because it's to do with NFTs. So that's what I was trying out this week. And one of the fun things is you can create your own pair.
00:06:26.034 - 00:06:57.940, Speaker A: So if you have a new token and you want to create a liquidity pool for it, you can do so. It's quite expensive to do so. So probably not worth doing. But you can also click on here add liquidity and then you'll be confronted with this interface here, which kind of looks like the normal uniswap interface, and you can select a token here. We're not going to do that, we're just going to keep it simple ETH. And then from the drop down you can select another token. So let's say, for instance, I want to do WBtC because that's a pair that I'm interested in.
00:06:57.940 - 00:07:33.740, Speaker A: Then what you have to do is input how much ETH you want to put in here. So let's say I want to put in 0.5 ETH. Then it will tell me that I also need to put in 00:15 WBtc, which I don't have. So I would then have to go and buy WBtC in order to match the amount of ETH that I wanted to put in. So it will tell me quite rightly here, insufficient WBtC balance. So there's a bit of work for you to do to figure out what pairs you want to add liquidity to.
00:07:33.740 - 00:08:55.446, Speaker A: And on the basis of this interface here it's quite difficult to figure out which pairs you want to add to and you might be thinking well, I have this pair or I have this token, don't worry about it. This is not the way that I'm going to recommend to look at liquidity provision, but that just gives you an idea of what's going on here and how you would do it through uniswap. So what we're actually going to do is we're going to go to zapper Phi. Now Zapper phi is basically a defi dashboard and it's awesome because what it basically does is it looks at your ethereum address, shush, and it kind of figures out where all your defi activity is and it kind of collates it into one defi dashboard. And if like me, you are starting to branch out into lots of different kind of experiments across this space and you're starting to lose track of what you've done because it can be quite complicated. And if you're tracking your portfolio with something like blockfolio or Delta, it's not going to have that sort of deep defi knowledge to understand what a liquidity token or liquidity LP token is doing in one particular place. So you need at least some way of tracking all of that.
00:08:55.446 - 00:09:55.734, Speaker A: And what's fun about Zapper is that it can track L2s as well. And what I'm looking at here is it can also track binance smart chain. So I've got some things from previous tutorials that are stuck on loop ring, some that are on binance smart chain, and I'm probably going to do things like matic in the future. I have done a tutorial on anchor that won't be on here because it doesn't plug into the matrix, but in general this is actually pretty cool. It allows me to see at a glance what I've got, where I've got it, and there's a ton of things that I've done that I've completely forgotten about. What's also cool about this is that zapper has also got a very clever bit of functionality built in, which is kind of where zapping came from in the first place. And I think it's part of what enabled yearn to build the structures for what it does as well, allowing you to kind of zap between different positions in a single transaction.
00:09:55.734 - 00:10:57.626, Speaker A: And that is effectively what we want to do here. Because if we go back to this liquidity provision tab here, in order to add liquidity to the pool that I selected, there's probably quite a few transactions that I need to do. And as we know on ethereum right now, it gets kind of expensive. And I was actually going to do this tutorial on Matic on the quick swap decks and I was going to get into polygon, all these kind of things because I think what they're doing there with L2 is very interesting but it was too much. Just navigating the difference between the Pos bridge and the plasma bridge on Matic is a tutorial all in its own right and we will get to that. But for now we just want to look at liquidity provision. So what we can do here with Zapper is we can look firstly for a favorable pool to zap into and then what's really cool is we can do all of our work in a single transaction.
00:10:57.626 - 00:11:34.902, Speaker A: So I'll show you what I mean by that. Here's this WBtc ETH pool. Now I think if we just type in WBtc now and filter out everything apart from that we'll be able to see here's the WBtc to ETH uniswap pool that we were looking at and it's giving 2.92% roi. I mean it's not crazy big but whatever. But what we can do here is we can click on invest. Now what's fun here is that all I need to plug in is ETH.
00:11:34.902 - 00:12:07.378, Speaker A: I don't need to buy WBTC. And how is this even possible? Well the reason this is possible is because once you've provided liquidity to uniswap in the WBTC and ETH pool you receive a token which is ETH. That's the LP token that represents your share of the pool. And with zap you can just buy that token. You don't need to buy the WBTC and the ETH and then combine them and mint that new token. You can just buy the token. And that's when we talk about money, legos and composability.
00:12:07.378 - 00:12:47.470, Speaker A: That's the fun thing about this. There's so many kind of different ways of wrapping an idea or logic into a tokenized form that can then be freely traded. That essentially anything is possible, and you can build whatever you want. And in a future video, we're going to get into fura combo, which is a really fun way to build all sorts of weird and wacky money lego structures. But that's for another time. So here, if I were to type in 0.5 ETH, what it would do is it would generate a WBTC to ETH token that represents my share of that pool.
00:12:47.470 - 00:13:45.934, Speaker A: And if I were to confirm that I'm not going to do that right now, it would give me the little pop up in metamask and I'd have to sign a transaction. We'll take a look at that in a second, just to see how expensive it is, because I have a feeling it's probably not going to be the cheapest. I just wanted to look at, though, how you might pick an opportunity, because what's fun about the zapper dashboard is it actually kind of ranks things and gives you much more data than you would get in just unisoft. And of course, it's tracking pools in all sorts of different protocols, like sushi, like curve, like Bancorp. So all you have to do is click on the ROI tab here. So if we do that, it's now going to tell us where the really juicy opportunities are. We've got things like 381% on ethcon.
00:13:45.934 - 00:14:19.440, Speaker A: I have no idea what that is, but we could invest in that. Put a bunch of Ethan, 0.5 Ethan. That would give us 22.16 econv tokens and, well, that would be a fun way to park your money, wouldn't it? 379%. Of course, as we know, these rates are extremely volatile, so whatever that rate might be in this very instance is probably not what that rate is going to be in about five minutes time. There's a crazy one here, look.
00:14:19.440 - 00:14:38.994, Speaker A: 1128.1% on ETH inv. No idea what that is. I'm sure somebody can tell me. Oh, look, it's changed already, so I'm just going to have a look at these. Trending by volume. So people are clearly kind of gravitating towards where the best opportunities are.
00:14:38.994 - 00:14:53.478, Speaker A: And even while we were just watching, I mean, this is fluctuating around all over the place, so, 1126. Do you know what? We're going to ape. We're going to do it. We're going to ape. I'm just going to do it right now for your viewing pleasure. I'm just going to ape. This is me aping.
00:14:53.478 - 00:15:08.080, Speaker A: Never done this before. So 0.5 e going straight into this. We don't care what happens, because we're degenerates. Yes, we are. Confirm. Oh, look at that.
00:15:08.080 - 00:15:50.858, Speaker A: The gas fee is 107 dollarsforty $0.05. Is it worth it? The answer to your answer is no, it's not worth it. And I'll tell you why. Because really, chasing these kind of opportunities only makes sense if you have a lot of money to put in. We're talking like upwards of ten grand. And if I'm only putting in like $1,000, I'd have to leave that in there for quite a long time to make it make sense and to make it worthwhile, and I am not going to do that. And over the course of doing all these tutorials, I've picked up a bunch of junk positions with very small amounts of money that it would cost me so much to unwind that it just isn't worth it.
00:15:50.858 - 00:16:32.594, Speaker A: So what I have to do is I have to sit and let them stew and let them fester for a really long time before I can really reasonably withdraw them, or I just take a massive loss. And I don't want you to have to do that, and I don't want to do that myself. So another little thing we're going to look at here is something that might confuse you. So again, looking at the ETH conv pair, I'm going to put in 0.5 e and you get this random number, which is 22.14 ETH to Conv LP tokens. And it can be a bit confusing because, let's say, for instance, I put in 5000 visor tokens and a similar amount of ETH.
00:16:32.594 - 00:17:04.660, Speaker A: The amount of LP tokens you get seems to bear no relation to the amount you put in, and that's sort of just the way it is. And it can be a bit confusing. You might come out with a number that you have no idea what it is. For instance, in this case, 22.14 com tokens. And that is a bit baffling. So what I am going to do is presume that you're okay with paying that 100 or so dollars for your transaction and you found an amazing pool that you want to ape into.
00:17:04.660 - 00:17:39.360, Speaker A: And now if we go back to the dashboard, what we're going to do is look at liquidity pools. So I'm currently adding liquidity to the ETH visor pool, and if I look here, it tells me that the value of that is ten dollarsthirthirty. Now, that is not the value of the ETH and visor tokens that I've put in. There. That's just the value of the money I've made from providing liquidity that's been in there for about two days. I've earned $10 in two days, $5 a day. Is that worth it? I don't know.
00:17:39.360 - 00:18:32.026, Speaker A: I'm either playing the long game or the very short game. I actually did this just as an experiment, and I wanted to prep this tutorial, so I wanted to have a kind of representative pool. But effectively, I'm kind of running through a few different things here. I don't know if that really is worth it, but if you scaled that up and you ten X, the amount you put in, your exposure would be in the region of about 100 grand, and you'd be earning $100 a day. So that's why I think if you're going to do this and make a kind of entrepreneurial stab at it, using zapper and going and looking at these opportunities and really kind of chasing them, makes sense, but only at scale. You've got to be. I wouldn't want to be doing with this with anything less than 20 grand.
00:18:32.026 - 00:19:20.538, Speaker A: Like, who's got 20 grand to throw around at these things? But, I mean, that's farming. Everybody knows this already, however, and this is kind of the point of doing this tutorial. When we looked at quickswap and, my gosh, there are hundreds of these uniswap clones all over the place. You're going to be able to find some really incredible opportunities where the gas fees are low, where the APRs are high, because they want that liquidity in there. And you could very successfully, I think, operate on a L2 or an alternative layer one, and get a pretty damn good deal just by providing liquidity. So it's definitely worth checking out. But obviously, if you want to get into that ecosystem, you have to use a bridge.
00:19:20.538 - 00:19:48.954, Speaker A: And if you saw what we did with anchor last time, we used that terra bridge to get ourselves onto the terra ecosystem, which was very quick and very easy, but it's still something you need to do. So I'm just going to have a look at the bridge tab. Corona. It says new exclamation mark on the Zapper dashboard. What does this mean? Oh, there we go. Look at that. They make it easy for you.
00:19:48.954 - 00:20:27.854, Speaker A: So, I mean, I was just talking about how I thought it'd be difficult to get onto polygon for that cheaper quickswap provision that I wanted to do. But here we go on Zapper, they've got a bridge. It's built in. So, yeah, if we look, we've got Polygon, we've got optimism. Fun thing about Polygon is they're going to be connecting up not only matic and Ethereum, but also optimism and zk rollups. And if you've been following that whole debate, optimism versus zero knowledge roll ups, nobody quite knows which one is going to work. And there are different benefits for using the different ones.
00:20:27.854 - 00:21:11.166, Speaker A: But with something like polygon, it doesn't really matter because you'll be able to easily switch between one and the other. And trust me, after my experiences of working on terra last week and of playing around with things like loop ring, this stuff is just so much more fun if a you don't have to wait five minutes for the damn thing to go through and b it's cheap. Like last week it was sixty cents a transaction when I was putting all my funds into this visor set up with this Nft dfI nft thing, man, I ended up spending like $500 on gas. It's insane. And I don't mind doing it because I'm learning it all the time. But for a regular user, that is ridiculous. It's ridiculous.
00:21:11.166 - 00:21:57.746, Speaker A: So I could, it looks like easily bridge, oh, a bunch of stuff into polygon. Happy days. I like the fact that they've done this. I really like the zapper dashboard. I like how easy it is to see what I've got and where it is. Just a nice way to really kind of understand what it is you're doing with your defi. Because I guess the point is, defi is an opportunity and it shouldn't be hindered by the gas and everything else and the tools that we need to get a better understanding of what we're doing and where we can find these opportunities are here and they're going to get better.
00:21:57.746 - 00:22:41.642, Speaker A: And I would deeply encourage anyone to just dip a toe into l two s and possibly alternative layer ones as well, just to understand how much more fun it can be if you're not fighting these headwinds. So I hope that was a kind of useful look at liquidity provision. Here is my ETH Pfizer. It's working for me. It's not particularly profitable, but again, as I said, scale it up and it could be, oh wow. Have you noticed like a few weeks back we staked some other and wow, $2.54. I'm rich.
00:22:41.642 - 00:23:00.710, Speaker A: Rich, I tell you. So that's it. Drop any questions you have in the comments below. I will try and do more of these more basic ones and try and build into bridging across the L2s and doing more of that. I definitely want to do a video on Polygon and we'll cover that probably next because I think it's cool. Fura combo. Definitely.
00:23:00.710 - 00:23:05.970, Speaker A: We're going to do that because that's wild. And, yeah, I will see you on the next one. Peace.
