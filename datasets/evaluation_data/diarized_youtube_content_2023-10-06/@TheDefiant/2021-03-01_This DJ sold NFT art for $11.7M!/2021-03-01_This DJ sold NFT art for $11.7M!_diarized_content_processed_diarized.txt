00:00:00.170 - 00:00:41.270, Speaker A: Good morning. It's Monday and it's time for another quick take. Now remember when I said this, an individual single NFT here could sell for a million dollars? Well, it didn't take long. Take this number 6965 and this face only a mother could love and you have the first million dollar NFT sale. Well, it was actually 800 E and with ETH then valued at $2,010 per ETH, that's $1,608,032 for low is 24 pixel by 24 pixel art. Now I still don't get it, but hey, whatever floats your boat. But if your boat is bang up EDM, then Blau could be your banana boombox as his NFT sale this weekend ground that puny punk sale into the dust where its pathetic price tags belong.
00:00:41.270 - 00:01:33.542, Speaker A: Up for sale were 33 limited edition NFTs to commemorate the three year anniversary of his album Ultraviolet, redeemable for special edition physical vinyls, unreleased music and unique experiences. The top bidder will be able to collaborate with Blau and give creative input on producing a brand new Blau single. And boy did someone really want that perk. Top bid 3,000,666 666 Buckaroos Total for the entire sale 11,684,101 Benji's and kudos to origin protocol for putting it together. I suspect we'll see many more artists joining in in the future, but once again, we will probably look back on these figures as mere wannabes in a week. Because if you really want a zigga zigga, then you need to chow down on the latest three minute pop perfection of Beeplemania and feast on the potty mouth one's. Look mum, I'm famous.
00:01:33.542 - 00:02:25.654, Speaker A: Auction at Christie's yes, that Christie's. Through a historic collaboration with makers plays this is the first ever purely digital artwork to be auctioned by a major auction house. The first 5000 days comprises every single individual image from Beeple's 1st 5000 everyday's pieces compiled into a single composition. That is a merhusive body of work, and it presents an extensive glimpse into people's artistic journey from his early days of anonymity to the digital art phenome he is today, albeit one with a deeply unhelpful name, Winkleman. The current top bid is $3 million, but with ten days to go, this is probably going to get a little silly in the closing phases. $10 million possibly. Now we're covering NFTs all this week, so do get subscribed on YouTube and to keep up with all the latest defi news.
00:02:25.654 - 00:02:31.850, Speaker A: Head on over to the defiant IO or just join our Telegram channel. See ya. Bye.
