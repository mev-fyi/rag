00:07:29.794 - 00:08:16.104, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Good morning. How are you doing today? Are you ready for the lineup for day two? And I'm your host, Rashid Berkeleyn Hosh. And it's my pleasure to extend a warm welcome to all of you to be here, here at the pinnacle of the crypto gatherings of the year, Solana crossroads. Welcome. And expanding on the success of day one yesterday, day two promises to be even more remarkable. We are excited to present an outstanding lineup of speakers today and panelists ready to share their insights and expertise on Solana and the vast crypto ecosystem.
00:08:16.104 - 00:09:23.806, Speaker A: Prepare to absorb valuable knowledge from investors, developers and entrepreneurs at the forefront of crypto evolution as they reveal the latest trends and innovations in the industry. We highly encourage you, like yesterday, to make most of the day by networking and interacting with fellow attendees who bring diverse backgrounds and experiences to the table. And this provides a special opportunity to connect with like minded people and individuals and share ideas and foster new collaborations and that would potentially reshape the future of the crypto landscape. And a heartfelt thank you to our contributors, esteemed hosts and sponsors. Without their support and encouragement, this event would not be possible. And so let's start today by inviting on stage our George Harrop, and he's gonna be making the opening speech. Co founder of step finance and driving force behind Solana Crossroads.
00:09:23.806 - 00:10:45.234, Speaker A: And with twelve years of experience in the industry and crypto, including founding the first crypto money transfer startup, George is now dedicated to bringing the next billion people, next billion users to crypto world. So let's have a warm welcome with a big round of applause for George. Thank you and enjoy your day. Very cool video. Needed to play that again. I didn't. The first time I saw that video was yesterday, so I thought, we have to play it again for day two.
00:10:45.234 - 00:11:12.852, Speaker A: But welcome back to day two. We're back here, we've got a lot of really good lineup for the rest of today. We're talking validators, staking, lending protocols, data. We're going to be talking with people from all over the ecosystem again. We've got some new faces as well. It's going to be a lot of fun, so definitely tune in. As I said before, go downstairs, check out the exhibitors, go and try out some of the demos there.
00:11:12.852 - 00:11:38.414, Speaker A: The Etherfuse guys have got a claimable mexican bond, so very cool. Go and check that out. Star Atlas. We've got playable demos, we've got some of the AI stuff. I think everyone's giving out merch at some stage, or maybe we ran out of merch yesterday not too sure, but definitely go and check out the exhibitors on the floor down below. And yeah, have a great rest of the day. I don't want to take too much of your time.
00:11:38.414 - 00:12:26.104, Speaker A: We have a great panel coming up with some amazing peeps. So stay tuned and have a great day, too. Thank you very much. Thank you, George. Thank you, George. And it's time now for our first panel of the day today, let's welcome on stage two content creators Seb Montgomery and Jake Hillhouse from cryptic Jupiter Council and Ezgi Yaltai, co lead of super team Turkey community. And moderating the panel is Olevtina Jako Venko from the Salona foundation.
00:12:26.104 - 00:13:24.244, Speaker A: Please give them a big round of applause. Thank you, cryptic. Should we leave behind our shame? Hello. Great to see you everybody. Good morning or good evening to anyone who's watching us online. This is the day two of Solana crossroads. I'm very excited to moderate our first panel.
00:13:24.244 - 00:13:49.564, Speaker A: Today. It's going to be a fire panel. We're going to take a sneak peek into what it's like working in Solana ecosystem, how to get there, and I hope it's going to be useful for folks from different industries. So we have very diverse but strong leaders here. Guys, let's maybe do a quick intro for our dear guests. Me first. Yeah, let's go.
00:13:49.564 - 00:14:22.774, Speaker A: Yeah. My name is Jake Hill House, also known as Soljakey in the crypto world, and I'm a content creator from Toronto, Canada. I'm cryptic. I guess I sit in the wrong place because that's my little PFP. I'm working with Jupiter right now, and previously I've been working with marinade and Sabre and yeah, probably see me around in the ecosystem. Hey, it's Esgi from spread team Turkey. You might know me from our events and bootcamps, hackathons.
00:14:22.774 - 00:14:45.128, Speaker A: I'm co leading spray team turkey. My name is Seb Montgomery. I'm sorry I've lost my voice yesterday. So I work on content and just basically explaining things in a simple way in YouTube. On YouTube. And I also work with the Dupe Uplink working group, pushing out their videos as well. Okay.
00:14:45.128 - 00:15:22.594, Speaker A: Okay, good. Seb, a couple of months ago, you were assigned as the Jupyter working group leader, but you had like a full journey before that. Do you want to share about it a little bit? Sure. It all started with me having some soul and I wanted to stake it somewhere. I was not a fan of locking it up, so I found the marinade from, I think it was the serum hackathon winners. So I joined the community, and I saw an opportunity while I was in the community to help me out with user support, which I have experience from in the web two world. So I reached out to the team, Michael specifically, I think he's here somewhere.
00:15:22.594 - 00:15:55.770, Speaker A: And I asked him if I could help, and I got the opportunity to do so. And that later on, a couple of months later, turned into me becoming the community lead of marinade. And then, like, more than a year later, I eventually owned my own thing with creating a fun little hobby project called Pool Party. And then I took upon myself the mission to revive the notorious saber protocol. So I did so as well. I created a Dao proposal to the Dao. Hey, make me sort of the interim DaO leader here to shape things up.
00:15:55.770 - 00:16:37.114, Speaker A: And about six months later, I would deem that as a success, like my necromancy spells, kind of worked out fine. Now Saber Dahl is revived, the community is flourishing, and the protocol is working well. But worth noting, that would not be possible without the collective effort of what became the sabre community as well. So sure, I took the initiative, but it was because all the other cool people that came from all swaths of Solana, too, to help out with this mission. Then later on, that gave me the opportunity to work with Jupiter, where I'm currently working with the core working group. So my journey has been through communities, to communities to communities, sort of. I see.
00:16:37.114 - 00:17:29.184, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a pretty long journey compared to your other working places, how working in Dao is different to other job opportunities? Is it like easier, harder? Is it just completely different? I think one of the things that is vastly different is working in a really transparent environment where you kind of on a daily basis are accountable to the community or to the users or to the DAO. That's a big difference. But on the other hand, the feedback loop is way better. You get instant feedback on anything you do. So I think that's really, really cool as well. I got a message that a lot of our audience taking pictures, so would you mind guys switching to the places that are correct logos so you don't get fantastic. Thank you.
00:17:29.184 - 00:18:22.918, Speaker A: The complexity of your journey reminds me a little bit of how wide the super team is working on the ground. ESG. Do you mind sharing how you. Didn't you end up leading the Solana Grove initiative in Turkey and why? Personally, I part of Patika dev team, it's a edtech startup in Turkey. They're providing some learning bootcamps to tech companies and tech companies hiring people from these bootcamps that was the beginning of the story and we did great and we build a great community there. More than 200,000 people enrolled our programs and then the community demanded web3 programs and that how becomes. And then we launched Solana Bootcamp.
00:18:22.918 - 00:19:22.790, Speaker A: More than 3000 people enrolled it and our spreading Turkey story began with it and I took the leading part and now as a super team. What super team is super team is a community of very talented persons who are learning, earning and building in crypto. And we can say it's zero to 100 journey. On the learning side we have some boot camps, upskilling programs. There are too many other folks who are learning something. On the earning side we have some earning opportunities like bounties and grants who are learning these things. They already earn some bounties and they have already earned their first money via jobs.
00:19:22.790 - 00:19:49.834, Speaker A: First money. We are some other grants. It's a great thing. It's a good start for a career. Starting and on the building part is the most important one. It's for newcomers and at the same time experienced people. Because the building part is an inclusion program.
00:19:49.834 - 00:21:00.582, Speaker A: That's why we are doing too many events and we are providing limitless support to these projects to launch and grow them globally. That's the thing. That's a lot of things to do. What would be one main value that you think super team is providing to the local community here in Turkey? Turkey part we can say super team Turkey contributes to visibility and growth. Web three community in Turkey, that's the main part. And it's serving a lot because I can say web3, we have more than we have some talented teams who already raised or won hackathons. And the global community knows these names better now and already 76 projects omitted last hecatomb from Turkey.
00:21:00.582 - 00:21:28.256, Speaker A: It was on the top ten. That means that's a visibility. If you are building something and collaborating with other countries. It's a thing for Turkey because there are too many talented persons in here. There's a great potential. At the same time, these people are also web3 native and mixing them is a good opportunity for Turkey for sure. Yeah, visibility is super important.
00:21:28.256 - 00:22:05.458, Speaker A: And actually another way to achieve visibility is through content creation. And we have not just one but actually two content creators here. Jakey, you drove here on the car. Was the road here as smooth as your crypto journey? It was interesting. It was cool to kind of see Europe for the first time and experience it through a car and driving from Serbia to here. I'll say the border from Bulgaria to Turkey. That part wasn't fun, to be honest, that part was a little scary, but, no, the rest of it was really cool.
00:22:05.458 - 00:23:05.558, Speaker A: I ate a lot of good food, and, yeah, it was relatively smooth. Okay, great. You're very great at explaining complex situations and complex theories in an easy and a fun way. Was it always what you wanted to do, or you sort of ended up doing that on a way? And how did you find what you enjoy doing that? No, I think when we started creating a lot of our video content in web3, it was more on the entertainment side, and I felt like a piece had kind of been missing in a lot of our content, and that was the information side and it being informative. And I think me early on, like, growing up, I was a very hands on and, like, visual learner. And so a lot of the time I'm watching, like, YouTube tutorials, and that's how I would get a lot of my information. And so I wanted to find a way to take what we were already kind of doing, these skits and these crazy videos, but then also make them informative for people that learn the same way that I do.
00:23:05.558 - 00:23:30.106, Speaker A: And that's kind of how we came up with the format, where it's like a skit within a commercial. So, like, a great example is the Jupiter one. It was like a real life experience that I would assume a large majority of people have maybe encountered. And we were able to put it in a way that broke down how Jupiter works and how to buy meme coins. So it wasn't something that I always wanted to do. It wasn't like the original plan. It just ended up going that way.
00:23:30.106 - 00:24:04.760, Speaker A: And I've had a lot of fun making those videos. So you're enjoying it right now? I'm loving it. Seb, is it something that looks like your journey as well, or was it completely the opposite? So, for me, there's no car, no bulgarian border scariness. I just flew here. So in 2021, I was pretty early to Solana, and I was using the solet wallet, which most of you, I hope, have never used. It was great at the time for what it was, but it was very hard. And then Phantom came out with their wallet, which I'm sure many have used.
00:24:04.760 - 00:24:36.724, Speaker A: And I actually, they were like, they didn't have many users. They needed someone for support. And so I just took on their support role just in discord, just answering every question while doing all my other things. And from there, the growth just went crazy. Like 30,000 users to a million pretty quickly. And people kept on asking, how do I do this? How do I do this? And you just couldn't explain it very easily just in text. So I started making some short videos.
00:24:36.724 - 00:24:57.004, Speaker A: This is how you do this. This is how you do this. Put it on my, on my YouTube, which wasn't very. Was they weren't good or anything, but they were better than nothing. And then people continued to ask questions and then they started to DM. I eventually left Phantom and I'd still get DM'd. I still get dmed.
00:24:57.004 - 00:26:16.064, Speaker A: And I found it was easier to provide more value just by having just simple explainer things so that when people DM'd send me a message, I could just go, watch this video, watch this video. And then I just went a little bit obsessive. Kind of jumped to the mister beast mindset of just 1% better every day just to try to dominate just the spacing, getting really, really good at it, which I'm not really good at it, but I'm way better than what I started. And the goal is just to, to explain things simply. So at present it's in English, you know, I love in the future when it's when so many people can understand things so they can stay safe, make some gains, understand it all, and at the end of the day, like, learn web3 properly. So that's basically, do you think every project understands how much they need the content for their growth? Or is it something that comes as a realization later? No, they don't understand at all. So quite often I would do like a meeting with a team, just a random team, and say, hey, can I have all the sticking points? I'll make a video and this will be like a full day's effort.
00:26:16.064 - 00:26:47.264, Speaker A: And I learn very fast. I normally know the Dapps beforehand and quite often they wouldn't retweet or anything or even say, hey, that was really good initially. Now people are starting to realize, oh, okay, so it doesn't take 2 hours to make these sort of things. The other thing is, Twitter's great, but it's not evergreen. You can't always search it, it's just text. If someone's foreign, they could put on auto translate subtitles on YouTube. Normally you can't do that as easy with just Twitter just explaining you.
00:26:47.264 - 00:27:19.812, Speaker A: So now I think projects are starting to realize, as an example, Jupiter, they've got the uplink working group. They've obviously got the core working group, which cryptic's a part of. But uplink is all about just trying to get the information out there, take little clips and just build, build it's doing well. And, like, I'm part of that team and I have literally every day I think about content. No days off. I'm sure it's exactly the same as Jakey. Just mind just goes to, how can I make it better? How can I make more people understand it? Yeah.
00:27:19.812 - 00:28:06.858, Speaker A: Interesting. Probably I'm going to put you on the spot here, but what's the most favorite part of your job? Like, what do you enjoy most doing in this content creation? I guess it's nice to get feedback or to see, like, video spike. You know, every now and then there's a video that gets, like 40,000 or 50,000 views and that's, like, really rewarding. But it's also really good because my goal is to try and stop people from going into pitfalls as well as educate them. It's really nice to have someone say, leave a comment or just send me a message and say, I was about to click on a scam link and then I remembered your video and I used whatever. So just protecting people, I think that's probably the most rewarding thing. Yeah.
00:28:06.858 - 00:28:49.074, Speaker A: Would you agree, JK? Is it the same for you? Yeah, relatively. I think, like, for me as well, the process of, like, creating content is my favorite part. It's something that, like, I've always loved. Like, even before web3, I was making skateboarding videos and then we started doing, like, the jackass style, like, stunts. And I always enjoyed, like, the process of creating that, watching, you know, Colton, whoever was editing it, put it together. It's like you have this vision in your mind and then you're able to put it into something tangible, which is, like, the video. And then, of course, like, then you get to see the public's perception of it and you get to see the feedback and then you can either, you know, take the negative feedback and implement new strategies into it to make it better.
00:28:49.074 - 00:29:36.134, Speaker A: Yeah, both those parts are my favorite, but the process is my favorite. Sab, you do quite a bit of community management as well within your work. Is it that rewarding on a daily basis? What's your favorite part of the job? I think it's the collaboration to be able to sort of, like I touched upon previously working in a transparent manner. And to me, that means collaborating a lot with people as well. You get, like, these instant feedback loops as well, but you also learn a lot of yourself and also learn, like, how to facilitate better processes for a large group of people. So working collectively, I think that's really exciting and fun and sort of lift up the community or community members who takes initiatives to help. The sort of joint effort here.
00:29:36.134 - 00:30:31.282, Speaker A: Do you think that's similar to super team Sk? Is it as rewarding coming to the job every day and working with the community or you see results of your job in like in the longer periods of time? I think it's rewarding every day and at the same time it has long time effects. Because one project submitted a hackathon, we see that maybe one year later their success. At the same time we after our education programs, some people get some jobs. It's another on time thing. Sure. It says two parts. We have about seven minutes left, so let's maybe take a minute and share with our dear guests any tips and tricks on how to get into something similar where you guys are working on.
00:30:31.282 - 00:31:24.406, Speaker A: Let's start maybe with Seb. How do you think is the best way to get into the dial? It's a very unique way. I think it's pretty straightforward, actually. It's first start off with participating in the community as an active member and then turn that activity into something constructive. My modus operandi has always been trying to figure out how I can help, how I can help the community or help the team or the project. So having that as sort of like the pillar of it, you'll be surprised to see like how if you have this approach, you'll be surprised to see how receptive different teams are out there to community members who are both active and constructive. Because like everybody can have an opinion on how things are or how things look, but very few people actually take action and initiative to help out.
00:31:24.406 - 00:31:46.978, Speaker A: So I think that's the best way. That's what I've been doing throughout my whole journey touched on previously. So I think that's the best way. Fantastic. Yeah. Take notes, guys. ESG, what if someone is a builder? Like what's the best way to start working in an ecosystem? I think two things is very important in crypto world.
00:31:46.978 - 00:32:21.764, Speaker A: It's one of them is reputation and the other one is network. So that join the community and keep building. This is the secret source of success. I'm saying this. And there's another unknown thing about hecatons. If you're a builder, hackathon is a place where you can show your potential at the same time gaining reputation. Please participate in.
00:32:21.764 - 00:33:12.684, Speaker A: If you are a newcomer, it's a showcase of your potential. If you are an experienced team, it's an opportunity to telling your world to world. It's a global thing and you are gaining recognition globally. That's so important, but also for super, super team earn. Not only builders can participate, right? There are many opportunities for, of course we have earn platform they can participate in and also we have some events at the same time, some education programs you can participate in. All fantastic. What if someone wants to be a content creator? JK or SEP? Do you have any advice for them? You go first.
00:33:12.684 - 00:33:53.500, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, I think my best piece would be to create what you want to create. And that sounds pretty like obvious, but there's a niche. There's an audience for every niche on the Internet. And so the main thing is when you're creating your content, depending on whatever hobby it might be, you have to really like doing that thing in order to like create a piece of content on it. You have to, you have to love what you do, right? And so I think creating what you want to create when you're first starting out is super important and it helps build like an honest audience and community right off the bat. And then you can start branching out, finding different lanes.
00:33:53.500 - 00:35:02.064, Speaker A: But yeah, create what you want to create. Do you have something to add? Yeah, definitely. I guess, you know, a lot of people would like to actually work in this space. So eventually it's going to have to lead to something that's paying you, right. I would say the first step is actually to brand yourself in a way that you're recognizable on Discord, Twitter, telegram, it's the same brand, it's the same profile picture, it's the same name or something, just so people can find you when you actually start to get some traction and then maybe find a couple of dapps or projects that you really love and just get very familiar with them. Make lots of things in discord, like answer lots of questions, really add huge amount of value so that the team notices you and then they will quite often be, especially as we enter into this, further into the cycle, there will be a lot of opportunities to make memes or little content creation things and then just go and get started and just try and level up every day. The more you obsess while still getting good sleep and having a good life, the better you will get and people will notice.
00:35:02.064 - 00:35:42.138, Speaker A: And basically my thesis is, I mean, Jake is right, you know, there's always a niche. He's got the entertainment factor down pat and I provide. In my niche, I couldn't do what Jakey does. I'm not good at skateboarding, but just providing value in terms of, like, explaining something simple. And I think that is still, there could be a thousand content creators tomorrow on that subject. And it would still not be enough people. What if someone is not as good as they want to be at the beginning? Oh, I mean, I still say, um, and, ah, and my videos are heavily edited.
00:35:42.138 - 00:36:12.674, Speaker A: Like, I have. There's no limit on your, on how good you are, but I guess, like, on how good you can get to. But I guess to start off with, like, you can watch, you can watch, you can do one video and then watch a video on how to get better. And if you do like that, that's what I would do. If I would, if I could go back in time, just learn from people that are better and just have them as your mentors. Mentors. Even if you can never meet these people, there are people that are so good at it and they have a free course or a free video.
00:36:12.674 - 00:37:02.916, Speaker A: I would just start with literally a good microphone, put a pillow in front of it to reduce the reverb, the echo and just start recording. Fantastic. That was pretty insightful, panel. Thank you so much for participating in. And I hope everybody enjoys the rest of the fantastic programming today. Thank you. Thank you.
00:37:02.916 - 00:37:18.516, Speaker A: Thank you for this introduction. Stressing chats. We need more energy in this room. I see people there very quiet. Maybe you had very less coffee or tea in this morning. Yesterday we had upper, upper energy. Let's boost up.
00:37:18.516 - 00:37:52.064, Speaker A: So next in line, our panel on Solana's ambassador program. To discuss this more, let's welcome on stage Tabtila, global director for Solana All Stars, and Jesus Silva, all the way from Venezuela. And he is Solana all stars manager, Venezuela. And moderating the panel, our fellow Chris Fiore. Thank you very much. And let's have a big round of applause. Hello, hello.
00:37:52.064 - 00:38:03.058, Speaker A: How are we doing today? Let's get some noise. Woo. Come on, come on. Day two, day two. Come on. We need some day two energy. Thank you guys for being here.
00:38:03.058 - 00:38:23.338, Speaker A: Really. We couldn't put on this event without. You mean that? From the bottom of my heart. This is, this is a huge moment for us. It's a huge moment for the community. And I am super excited to welcome the two people who are going to be joining me, Theptila, which is our global director of Solana All Stars. That's what she just said.
00:38:23.338 - 00:38:38.666, Speaker A: And then also Jesus Silva, who came all the way. It was maybe 30 hours to get here, all the way from Venezuela. Hey, I want to do something special for him. Come on with me. This is very important. Okay. Hey, Zeus.
00:38:38.666 - 00:38:46.338, Speaker A: Hey, Zeus. Hey, Zeus. Hey, Zeus. Hey, Zeus. Hey, Zeus. Hey, Zeus. Thank you, guys.
00:38:46.338 - 00:39:08.722, Speaker A: All right, let's sit down. Let's kick it off. All right, so just so you guys know, this is a totally unscripted conversation. I wrote absolutely no questions, and I told them absolutely nothing. I said, come on stage with me. I want to have a conversation about Solana all stars, because this is something I'm extremely passionate about. I know these two are extremely passionate about it.
00:39:08.722 - 00:39:37.866, Speaker A: And also, Victor Simdope, who is not here with us today, he is in Nigeria hosting many events where people are watching us live all the way in Nigeria. You guys are famous. You're on camera in Nigeria, by the way. That's right. So all of these people are here to talk with us and to discuss the future of Solana all Stars, which I'm super excited about. But I want you to know that, for me, some of the best moments in my life and in crypto have been unscripted moments. So that's what this is going to be.
00:39:37.866 - 00:40:29.904, Speaker A: So let's kick it off with the discussion of what is Solana all Stars. Right? So Solana all Stars is Solana's global ambassador program. What does that mean? That means that we host events around the world for people who are interested in crypto, want to learn and want to just start maybe from zero. Maybe they have no idea where to begin, how to open a wallet, how to do anything we want to onboard those people, because that's how we get to a billion users in crypto. So I want to start off with asking theptila, what, for you does solenoid stars mean? And just walk us through a little bit of what it is, in your opinion? Well, it means this again, I think maybe 50% of this crowd is Solon all Stars crowd. Most of you join crypto through Solon all Stars. You open your first wallet through solon all stars.
00:40:29.904 - 00:41:38.384, Speaker A: It means a lot because we become the reason why a lot of people get onboarded. And the beautiful thing about solon all stars is the in real life events, we go to many countries, such as Venezuela, Turkey, and Nigeria, and we actually go to many, many cities within that country. And in real life events taught us this. There are people out there who wants to learn. If you go and talk to them, they are willing to learn, and they will be part of your community. One thing that we realized that is when you go to big cities, such as Istanbul for Turkey, or name it Ankara for Turkey, there is a lot of events like this, or maybe smaller scale, but people are actually exposed to, like, crypto events. But we realized that smaller cities, such as many of you are here from smaller cities.
00:41:38.384 - 00:42:13.696, Speaker A: I have people from Mula Bandarma. I have people from Eloza. I have people from Antalya, Adana, Konya. These are smaller cities in Turkey. When we go to these cities, we have 200, 300 people greeting us, asking to learn more about Solana, more about crypto. They opened their first wallet with us, mainly, and then they learned about, let's say, nfts. They learn about Defi, and they learn these through people who were in the community before.
00:42:13.696 - 00:42:38.390, Speaker A: So this culture of, hey, I learned this. Let me teach you how. Jesus is a great example of that. Many of you know Tuche, she's a great example of that. She was part of this community. Now she's giving you guys lectures about crypto. So this culture of let's learn from each other, actually creating this community of I can be that person one day.
00:42:38.390 - 00:43:12.560, Speaker A: This doesn't have to be a technical topic, right? Because we all think that, you know, crypto is like, you have to be a dev to understand, or some jargon is sometimes scary. We're trying to show people that it doesn't have to be scary. It doesn't have to be something that you completely understand. So let's say we all use Internet. How many of you know how Internet works? Can you raise your hand? I don't see any hands out there. Oh, no, there's one. There's two.
00:43:12.560 - 00:43:27.924, Speaker A: Oh, there's a few. There's a few. But you don't necessarily have. Have to know how Internet works in order to use the Internet. Right. The same logic applies to crypto. You don't have to understand what's behind to use the products.
00:43:27.924 - 00:43:41.952, Speaker A: And that's exactly what we're after. We're trying to onboard users. Yeah, it was a long winded one, but there's your answer. So what it sounds like is Solana all stars. It's all about onboarding users. That's right. Users.
00:43:41.952 - 00:44:06.168, Speaker A: Right. Some of those users will become builders, but anyone who's going to become a builder is going to be a user first. You have to understand what the users want. That's critical. And so these are educational events, community events, and it brings everybody together. And it's really special when you have a room of people and you're there with other people who want to learn and are interested in the same things. That's very different than an online community where you're just typing to people.
00:44:06.168 - 00:44:29.032, Speaker A: Right. Look, you feel the room. You understand what people are reacting to. The uniqueness of salon all stars is that we understand that every country has a different culture. And every city has a different culture. Therefore, they learn differently. For example, in Nigeria, there is a crowd that shows up at every event with a notebook and a pen.
00:44:29.032 - 00:45:16.396, Speaker A: These people are ready to write down whatever they are learning, treating this as a lecture, and then, let's say a city in Turkey, people don't respond well to that. So they like more like playful learning. They like breaks, they like networking, like events. So we shape our events based on the needs of the city, the country, the culture at times. So an event in Venezuela, in one city, not the same in Turkey and other city, because we understand different cultures require different types of education. And speaking of events, I want to hear what an event is like. If you can walk us through Jesus, what an event is like from the beginning to end.
00:45:16.396 - 00:45:35.500, Speaker A: Just what that experience is like. First, though, what I want to do is I want a show of hands in terms of where people came from. Right. Because this is an event itself. This. This is like a massive salon all stars event. So who here came from 30 hours away? Is there anybody who came from 30 hours away? Okay, I see somebody right there came from 30 hours away.
00:45:35.500 - 00:45:48.564, Speaker A: What about 20 hours away? Did anybody come from 20 hours away? Yep. Yep. I see a couple of hands. All right, what about 10 hours to get here? 10 hours? That's a pretty long way. Thank you guys for coming. Appreciate you. Hope you got some sleep last night.
00:45:48.564 - 00:46:02.276, Speaker A: All right, what about 5 hours? 5 hours. All right. Okay, cool. And what about Istanbul? How many Istanbul people here? Okay. Pretty good crowd. Yeah. So it looks like we have people from all over 30 hours, 2010.
00:46:02.276 - 00:47:02.308, Speaker A: Thank you guys for coming here. What does an event look like? Jesus, walk us through a Solana all stars event from beginning to end. Okay, I need to express the Solana all stars for. For Latam, for Venezuela is opportunity, bro. It's opportunity to change all. It's not only another mirror, it's opportunity for all latan people. Why? Because you can opportunity for learn, for educate, for understand what is the blockchain? What is the real technology? I am a developer for a long time, but this opportunity for all the time for Turkey, for Nigeria, free education for the new technology, how you can make with the blockchain technology is only possible on Solana, but with Solana all stars, so all people around the world maybe don't have the same opportunity.
00:47:02.308 - 00:47:43.960, Speaker A: Latan right now has a big opportunity with the people around the different cities, different countries, working together for create the next generation for people in the blockchain world. So more of that, for me, is a big opportunity. Solana will start a program in more associated, but a big family. Why? Because different people. Hey, Suz, I can collaborate with in another city. Hey, I can move, I can help with a lot of units. So because creating different events in different cities in the same time is very complicated.
00:47:43.960 - 00:48:26.780, Speaker A: But in one of our stars, a big family, so different people. Hey, Jesus, no problem. Yesterday we have an event in Venezuela, and we have a different event at the same time with our problem in Turkey and Nigeria followed the events without problem. Why? Because all people attending is people want take the opportunity for another people. So more and more collaborators, more and more ambassadors, and is the future in the future now? It's now Solana started opportunity for all people around the world. And that's it, bro. Absolutely.
00:48:26.780 - 00:49:02.218, Speaker A: And something I want to add there, we have a lot of conversations as we're building things behind the scenes, we're putting on events, and you guys never hear about these things. You just see the event and it looks magical, right? But for example, in Venezuela, we had a situation where there was no power. There was literally no power in a city anywhere. No generators, really nothing happening. And we had to put on an event. So we figured out a way to put on that event literally in the dark to be able to educate people still. So the things that we have to deal with and the people around the world have to deal with are very different, depending on the country that you're in.
00:49:02.218 - 00:49:24.574, Speaker A: It is extremely important that everybody understands that. And crypto means something very special in specific countries where their currency is really struggling. Right. Like, obviously in Venezuela, that's a huge problem. In Turkey, I think the lira, obviously, that's a huge problem here as well. And being able to. To have that value of your money and not have that just go down over time.
00:49:24.574 - 00:49:43.258, Speaker A: It's not just about making money for making money. Hey, I'm going to go buy a Lamborghini. It's about. No, no, I want to have a family. Like, maybe I can have a house someday. It's about being able to achieve your dreams and this actually helping people to achieve their dreams just by working hard. Average people just trying to work hard to achieve their dreams.
00:49:43.258 - 00:49:59.594, Speaker A: And that's who we're trying to reach and trying to help educate. Right? That's right. That's right. And that's the uniqueness of solon all stars again. So I. When we were thinking about where do we go, which cities do we pick, right. We talked about this a lot.
00:49:59.594 - 00:51:17.760, Speaker A: We realized, okay, so think about this as a presidential campaign, right? If you wanted to be a president of any country, and you're a new candidate, what would you do? Would you go to the biggest city to get the biggest audience, per se, or would you go to the smallest cities where nobody goes? And potentially, the audience is going to be more open to hearing your perspective because no one else is there. So that's the kind of logic that we followed. We wanted to go to smaller cities where nobody, per se, cared. And the reaction we received was the exact reaction we wanted to see. We're struggling with receiving the crowd in Istanbul that we receive in Nevshehr, for example, in Konya. These cities bring three to four figures, sometimes to their events within, like, a week, where Istanbul, the appetite is like, okay, you know what? I actually been to eth event yesterday, and potentially we'll go to another event. So I think our unique approach of going to places that nobody goes is helping the cause.
00:51:17.760 - 00:52:05.488, Speaker A: And to be frank, Solana is really helpful. You know, the product that we have in our hand is, first of all, cheap and fast, right? Not gonna name names, but it's, you know, if you compare two wallets, two ecosystem wallets, with Solana being one, it's easier to explain someone. Right? So I can't go to, you know, for example, in Venezuela, some, you know, transactions could be too much money for anyone to handle. Where Solana is actually a no brainer for some countries. Some countries, they can't afford the transaction fees. So I guess, you know, this is the power of Solana and I. That's why we believe Solana is going to have the next billion people on board.
00:52:05.488 - 00:52:27.920, Speaker A: It's because it has the basics that everyone needs. Maybe others don't have. Yeah, absolutely. And I want to talk a little bit about Nigeria as well. Yeah. Nigeria, by the way, was the first country that we ever did Solana all stars in. And the really cool thing is we started our first event ever for Solana All Stars at exactly this time, maybe a month ago last year.
00:52:27.920 - 00:52:55.664, Speaker A: So Solana All Stars is a year old. So I want everybody here to give a round of applause for Solana All Stars being a year old. Okay, one year old. And I. Hey, and what's crazy about that, guys? What's crazy about that is in. Within one year, we went from zero to over 20,000 people that have been attending our events regularly at different events across three different countries. And you know what? We're not going to stop there.
00:52:55.664 - 00:53:27.504, Speaker A: Like, we talk about this all the time, but our goal, you know, is to be everywhere, to be in every country and to reach as many people as we can. Because quite frankly, guys, we don't do this for the money, the glory, the fame, to be on stage. We're here talking because we want to help people out. We want to get them onboarded, because we believe that this can change, change people's lives. Right. And if you guys believe in that, definitely let us know as well. We're always looking for people to join who really believe that crypto can be a force for good in the world.
00:53:27.504 - 00:53:48.132, Speaker A: Right. And specifically who believe that Solana could be that thing that really changes the next person's life. That's what I believe. I'm very passionate about that. They're very passionate about that. Yes. For example, talking about the morning in Venezuela and Latan, we have a lot of problem for receipt, payment, external, different countries.
00:53:48.132 - 00:54:52.826, Speaker A: For example, if you are a developer and you need receipt, a payment is very complicated. But using Solana, using the blockchain is another procedure. But if you don't know anything about Solana Wallet, how this work and that possibility is not, is not in your mind. So for that reason, when you hear about Solana all Star and you go and you learn, you have another opportunity, you receive another experience and connect. For example, you are a designer in your house and big, big designer, but, you know, understand the technology blockchain or how you can explore, create NFT or a new job. And it's only possible when Solana star go to small cities and explain, hey, bro, you can create new design, sell or NFT or new job or get another experience, but it's only possible when the people know about that. Yeah.
00:54:52.826 - 00:55:48.870, Speaker A: If you don't promote the new possibility, it's not possible. So I think Solana will start not only only create education, if not opportunities, and change life. Yeah, I want to talk about those opportunities by explaining to you how potentially it works in Turkey. Turkey has an ambassador program as well as all the countries that we have. Most of you know here that we have many ambassadors through many cities, Turkey, and we also have board of directors of ambassadors who are the people. They're actually the mastermind of this all stars operations. They get to choose where we're going next, who our audience is, who we're going to select to help us for that specific location, which takes a lot of coordination.
00:55:48.870 - 00:56:20.728, Speaker A: So imagine, like, 300 people showing up for an event that's a small conference you're organizing every week. And we go to three to five cities per week in Turkey. So it's definitely. Yeah. Where's Tuche? I don't know where she is, but if she wasn't a robot, we could not have done it. But luckily, she's a robot, and she goes to sometimes six different cities in one week to host these events. And same thing applies to huzoors.
00:56:20.728 - 00:56:55.284, Speaker A: Vic Simdope with Nigeria. I don't know how these guys do it. It couldn't be done unless there's a lot of passion. Right? But I want to talk to you guys about if you want to be part of this, how this works. I'm going to not sugarcoat the fact that we work hard and play hard as well. These kids, I want to say my kids work hard. Board of directors of Ocean all stars, most of you guys know, are the reasons why you're here.
00:56:55.284 - 00:57:30.532, Speaker A: They're the ones who selected your country. They're the ones who arranged everything for you to be here. And they go from being an ambassador to board of directors by showing the work that they do. And I'll give you the example of two che's journey. I met her last year during crossroads before. Well, before we were planning on having Solan all stars in tricks. I just want to reemphasize that two chae literally came to crossroads last year, the same as all of you guys are here at crossroads.
00:57:30.532 - 00:57:57.730, Speaker A: Literally, a year from now, you could be in the same position doing something wild within the Solana ecosystem, working for one of the companies here or helping us out with all stars. So I just wanted to highlight the value of these events. And the cool thing, too, is this is also possible at Solana all Stars events as well. And they're happening all over Turkey all the time. Absolutely. So I met her here during crossroads. She was very bubbly.
00:57:57.730 - 00:58:40.924, Speaker A: Talked to me about how she's trying to learn rust. She didn't know where to find turkish version of, like, you know, rust books or something. I'm like, look, I'm not a technical girl, but I'll get you someone who will help you. Long story short, we kind of connected. She like, you know, send me messages here and there, checking in. And then we started the Salon All Stars group, and she became the ambassador there for Ankara region. And long story short, like I said, we work hard and play hard, and during this kind of process, only the best ones last.
00:58:40.924 - 00:59:17.592, Speaker A: So we have the position open for Ankara region. So she became that person after six months of voluntarily working for us, and then another six months of working in that position, she was just promoted to the Turkey country manager. Yeah. Yeah. Amazing journey. And I know she's going to do much better things. But what I'm trying to get at is this is just that Solana all stars journey of hers.
00:59:17.592 - 01:00:03.584, Speaker A: There will be opportunities in the future where there's going to be projects. Seeing this, coming to the conferences, seeing the appetite in Turkey, they're going to say, hey, look, I need to hire someone from Turkey. Do you know anyone? Right? Yes, we do have inventory of devs, but do we have the inventory of these people that are actually working in these jobs? Knowing crypto, knowing how this works, being exposed to the ecosystem through events like this, through all stars, those are the people that will be selected, in my opinion. And that's where we're trying to work hard to find people. Hey, look, this is his resume. This is her resume. This is what she has done.
01:00:03.584 - 01:00:29.344, Speaker A: I'm her reference. You should hire her. So that's how you can make the connection to potential future opportunities. Yeah, I think the point. Point is, guys, opportunities are right in front of your eyes, right? Either you see them or you don't see them. Either you talk to that person standing there or you don't. And maybe that person you talk to is the person that you end up working with for the next five years.
01:00:29.344 - 01:00:55.544, Speaker A: You have no idea. So make sure that you're busy talking to people, networking and expressing what you're excited about, because if you express what you're excited about, then other people can connect you, right? Absolutely. That's what it's all about, is putting out into this world, putting out into this conference what you want so you can get that in return. Right? Yeah. You've already made the first step. You're here. You've traveled very far, as we've discovered in this conversation.
01:00:55.544 - 01:01:18.784, Speaker A: I want to get a show of hands. How many people here are Solana all stars or are familiar already with Solana all Stars? Raise your hand if you are. How many Solana all Stars? Do you have any Solana all Stars? All right, all right. That's a pretty good percentage. All right, all right. Well, you know what I want to see next year by the time we do this again? Yes. I want to see everyone's hand.
01:01:18.784 - 01:01:49.524, Speaker A: Everyone's hand. No, but seriously, there's two ways that you can join, right? You can join and be an ambassador at a high level, be on the board of directors, run high level things. And if you think you were built for that, and that's you come to us. Come to us if you feel called, but also if you just want a community of really amazing people where you can learn, find different job opportunities. All of those things just come to the events. That's all you gotta do, right? Yeah. I want to add something here.
01:01:49.524 - 01:02:20.524, Speaker A: We're user focused, right? And some of you are devs, and some of you are very advanced in that regard. And one feedback we received, hey, look, you're really, you know, your content is not for us. Yeah. So I want to expand on that. I'm sure you do too. I disagree wholeheartedly because, so let's say you're a dev. You want to have your own project.
01:02:20.524 - 01:03:17.258, Speaker A: You need users, right? Who's going to use your project or who's going to use your app, right? So in order to understand what users need, you need to talk to them. You need to understand what retail is talking about. You need to understand what a new person being onboarded need, what kind of product shift you need to make in order to onboard more people or simply get feedback from people. So that's one reason why you should second, let's be honest. Just because you're a Dev doesn't mean, you know, Defi, doesn't mean, you know, nfts. So let's, let's get a little bit humble about being open to receiving education through people who has done it for years or like, just through just being a nerd of defi, NFTs or whatever. So there's always room to grow.
01:03:17.258 - 01:04:07.324, Speaker A: And solon all stars can provide some sort of knowledge to everyone, not just, you know, people who are being just onboarded. We have different levels of education. For starters, intermediate and then advanced level. As we go to different cities, we start with based on the audience, because sometimes the audience is brand new, even though we go to, we went to that city prior based on the audience, we shift our educational program. And one other thing that we want to ask you guys, give us feedback. That's how we shift the way that we teach you or we talk to you, or we want to create this community. So if you think that, you know, the way that we talked about NFT that day was too potentially immense for you or too basic for the crowd, let us know.
01:04:07.324 - 01:04:49.180, Speaker A: And then going back to what you were saying about being part of the community and then piggybacking on two chase journey, don't just go ask for a job. Show them why you should be the one receiving the job. Show your work, and then I promise you, people will ask you to join them. Yep, that's right. Almost everybody that I end up hiring ends up coming from the community, right? It's people that have been there when there was no incentives involved at all. When they totally didn't have to work hard, and they put in hours and hours and hours, and they were just really passionate. And you know what? That turned into amazing opportunities for a lot of people.
01:04:49.180 - 01:05:09.418, Speaker A: We have a bunch of people who are helping us out and working on the Solana all stars team around the world now. So I want to ask you a question. Jesus. Okay. What is your dream for Solana all stars? I know this means a lot to you. What is your dream? Dream is a big word, guys. Fight for your dreams.
01:05:09.418 - 01:05:34.062, Speaker A: It's the more important mission in your life. You need fight for your dreams. My dream for Sculana All Stars is we'll be creating new opportunities around the world, helping different people, for education, a lot of people. Dev case. Hey, it's a low content. I totally agree with you, but it's not only for Devs. It's for everyone.
01:05:34.062 - 01:05:54.964, Speaker A: It's for everyone with different opportunities. So if you need five for your dream, you need Solana star in your life. You need to change the world. Become 2 billion new people around the world. Talking about the blockchain, obviously. Amazing. Well, I think we're gonna close it out there.
01:05:54.964 - 01:06:15.192, Speaker A: Really appreciate every single one of you that's come from Istanbul all the way to 30 hours away, wherever you came from. I know some people came from Mexico City. I think some people came from Panama, obviously. Venezuela. Australia. We had somebody from Australia. We had people from all over the world that are here.
01:06:15.192 - 01:06:25.594, Speaker A: Tunis. Tunis. Amazing. Amazing. So thank you, guys, for being here. And remember, like, the next amazing opportunity is just one conversation away. Yeah.
01:06:25.594 - 01:06:46.674, Speaker A: All right. Thank you, guys. Take care. Thank you. Bye. For Jordan, thank you for this all amazing chat. Solana all stars.
01:06:46.674 - 01:07:18.314, Speaker A: So people, they were asking me when I was making my way to the coffee stand if I'm a crypto user or crypto. If I have a crypto. No, I don't have. I'm just an emcee, screen and stage actor. Once again, for the newcomers, my name is Rashid Berkeley, but I'm part of the team. So Chris, arrange me being the member of Solana All Stars. Thank you.
01:07:18.314 - 01:08:07.348, Speaker A: And now, next on Agenda, coming up, a new panel, and we'll be talking about Solana AI developments. And we will explore the latest at the intersection of Solana and artificial intelligence with our esteemed panelists. Discover cutting edge AI applications driving innovation within the Solana ecosystem. And please join us to unveil the future of Solana AI developments. Please welcome on stage our panelists, Tosif Ahmed, VP of business development, from IO.net dot, Arif Khan. He was here yesterday with us.
01:08:07.348 - 01:09:00.309, Speaker A: And coming on the stage again, CEO of Alitya AI and moderating the panel is Mia Grotsky from step finance, with a big round of applause, please. Thank you. Hello, everybody. How's everyone feeling day two? Still excited. Cool. Well, I'm thrilled to be here. And, you know, talk about AI, it's been kind of a buzzword for a while in media, and now we're starting to see a lot of cool things happen with crypto.
01:09:00.309 - 01:09:30.753, Speaker A: Maybe to start, both of you could just give brief intros on yourself and your projects. So, Arif, would you like to start? Hi, everyone. I'm Arif. And I'm the CEO of Aletheia AI. Aletheia is. Our mission is to enable decentralized and democratic ownership and access to AI using the two most powerfully exponential technologies of our time, blockchain and AI. And we've been building at this intersection for the past four years.
01:09:30.753 - 01:09:49.908, Speaker A: Prior to this, I was also in this intersection and working at Singularitynet. So really excited to share our thoughts, learnings, pain points, failures with all of you. Awesome. So my name is Tasif Ahmed. I'm vp of Business development@IO.net. dot for those unfamiliar with IO.net comma, we're essentially a deep end building on Solana.
01:09:49.908 - 01:10:51.272, Speaker A: So we're a decentralized GPU clustering network on Solana. So what that particularly means is we pull latent excess compute capacity from a variety of sources, such as independent data centers, crypto projects, crypto miners, all the way to sort of consumer GPU's and connect that to demand from AI ML developers enterprises start so that they can run their AIML workloads with us. Great. So we're here today to talk about AI crypto. Solana, let's start really high level. Let's look at the AI sector and maybe think about some ways that crypto can help build that sector, and then also look at the crypto sector and some ways that AI can help build that two sides of that coin. And then the question is, is it inevitable that they will collide or, you know, will they just kind of help each other and, you know, stay these separate things? Sure, I can, I can start off so.
01:10:51.272 - 01:11:41.930, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think there's a lot to unback there, for sure. So in terms of crypto helping AI, I think that's something that's top of mind for a lot of folks. Right. So I think one of the major major risks of sort of where technology will sort of go in the future is this idea of centralization of AI models and sort of having this black box development of AI where fundamentally, you know, people just don't really know what's going on in there and sort of how that's going to affect everyone. I think the closest sort of analogy that I kind of tell people to kind of really strike that point home is the fact that, you know, imagine if the Internet would was owned by one single company and what that would mean to society. I think that's sort of similar to what could potentially happen here. So with crypto, I think fundamentally we can start to, I think you're already starting to see it.
01:11:41.930 - 01:12:41.948, Speaker A: We can fundamentally start like decentralizing the stack of how AI development really happens. All the way from the foundational layer with the compute side, which is where we play@IO.net comma, all the way to sort of AI training, inferences, processing, fine tuning, all of the middleware, sort of that comes with it all the way to the application layer. So I think with sort of like the decentralization that is offered by web3 and crypto, I think that kind of takes AI development more and more towards sort of, you know, this ethos of being able to kind of do it in a much more open source fashion and an ethical fashion. So I think that's sort of an area where we'll think these two, these two will collide. And I think the flip side of sort of where AI can help crypto, I think there's a ton to talk about there, too. But I think one of the ones that sort of comes to mind for me is just, you know, there's all these things with sort of like blockchain security, smart contract audits, ui ux, and sort of what that could look like with the incorporation of AI.
01:12:41.948 - 01:13:35.464, Speaker A: I think there's a ton that could kind of happen there. Yeah, I think if I were to just add, add to that, AI is a horizontal technology, and it has a lot of users. Like Chat, GPT was able to get a billion users in a short span of time. Crypto still requires that leap to cross that chasm and be massively adopted. So AI provides that application interface, whether it's a simple chatbot, whether it's a companion, whether it is a chatbot that helps you get better at math or science. All of these tools are consumer facing, and there is tremendous demand from normal consumers to use these tools. So from a consumption standpoint, from an application layer standpoint, it might be AI might be the killer app for crypto adoption.
01:13:35.464 - 01:14:20.726, Speaker A: But underneath that layer, as Tosif has shared, one of the key things from a crypto standpoint is the technology for provenancing data. Right. When we contribute our data sets, whether it is to a model that is being trained on, how do we ensure that your input, the way that you are contributing anything to this giant AI ecosystem, is actually being provenanced correctly, recorded correctly, you are being rewarded for it correctly, and at the same time, there are elements of privacy and security embedded and baked into it. So I think both technologies have very complementary overlaps. It's not so much of a collision, I suppose. It's more of a marriage. Right? I like that.
01:14:20.726 - 01:14:49.922, Speaker A: More of a marriage, not a collision or a match made in heaven. I don't know. Match made in heaven, whatever you prefer. Yeah, yeah, maybe like, yeah, different. Different relationships with a marriage. And then maybe we can go a bit deeper into sort of specific sectors within web3 that can really benefit from some of the AI, you know, some of the current AI technology. So I'm thinking things like, you know, we have defi, we have nfts, we have consumer crypto, you know, gamefi.
01:14:49.922 - 01:16:14.616, Speaker A: Like, what is one sector that in your eyes you think should really be looking at the, the AI stack and thinking about integrations? Yeah, I can start off on that. So that's kind of interesting, right? Because AI is just such an all encompassing technology that I think literally every single one of those things you mentioned is going to be accelerated by using AI. For me, a couple things that kind of really stand out. I think one of the things that I mentioned earlier sort of on the UI UX side, I think DeFi specifically is going to gain a lot from that, because I think people who are very crypto native and can be degens, they are very comfortable with defi, liquidity, provisioning, wallets, yield farming and things like that. But for the majority of folks out there, all that is greek. And the insurmountability of how much knowledge you feel like you need to have to be able to engage in DeFi can be really tough. But with AI, I feel we can have, especially with where AI is today, I think we can have a lot of innovation that UI UX and application layer that can make engaging with defi much more natural and sort of more human than what people are really used to, just to touch on one other one.
01:16:14.616 - 01:16:48.882, Speaker A: Because Arif, I think you'll probably talk about nfts. I think one sector that, you know, a lot of people don't necessarily talk about as much and hasn't seen as much adoption as I would have liked in crypto is Daos. You know, I think it's something that when I first heard about daos, I love the concept. Right. Like, just having a decentralized organization is really, really cool and sort of like, keeps with the ideals of. Ideals of crypto. But I think anyone who's actually sort of participated in a dao and Dao governance can talk about sort of how hard that is and how slow that can be.
01:16:48.882 - 01:17:37.426, Speaker A: And I think when you're talking about a decentralized organization trying to be compete with a centralized entity, that sort of slowness can be a killer. Right. And I think that's sort of where AI can really come in and really help augment what people in daos do, like, with governance, with sort of like forum discussions and debates and voting and essentially sort of like, you know, even like autonomous agents, kind of like pulling them in and being able to sort of execute on specific things that the DAO needs to execute on to accomplish its mission. I think that's an area that's really underexplored, and I think when it hits, it's going to really accelerate that. Yeah. I think just to expand on the autonomous agent side for us, one thing that will lead to adoption is if these agents start looking feeling more like humans. Right.
01:17:37.426 - 01:18:26.534, Speaker A: So there's a level of anthropomorphism where you feel comfortable with an agent because it is able to interact with you, it is able to empathize with you, and it is also able to do on chain actions for you. Right. And so that's where things start to get really interesting, when an agent can decode your intent. So I think yesterday there were some interesting panels on intent based protocols, or protocols that can essentially bridge effortlessly between one chain to another without a user needing to take ten to 15 steps. So a lot of these gaps that we have today from a crypto standpoint, in terms of our UI UX, can be effectively bridged by some of the AI applications out there. And I think the opportunity is exciting. The execution is all that matters.
01:18:26.534 - 01:19:35.014, Speaker A: Very interesting. So let's bring our conversation now kind of towards Solana, and talk about Solana and AI. And, you know, there's been a lot of great content yesterday and so far today that's discussed some of the specific advantages of why people are building on Solana and what Solana as a blockchain can really be used for now and in the long term. So when we're thinking about AI and we're thinking about Solana. What are some of the specific advantages that Solana might have for integrating AI components? Or maybe disadvantages? No, I think one thing from an autonomous agent standpoint, at least the way we think about it, is for AI's to truly become first class digital citizens, they will need a bank account. They will need to be able to be banked. And I'm very conscious of the context in which I'm saying this because a lot of our development team is in Lahore, and Pakistan is a really strong emerging economy, but a large part of Pakistan remains unbanked.
01:19:35.014 - 01:21:21.162, Speaker A: So I know the irony when I say that AI should have bank accounts, but humans don't have bank accounts yet, right? So I'm conscious of the irony, but I think when AI's actually start evolving and start to do on chain transactions, that's when things really start getting interesting, because you're feeding into that AI a lot of transaction data that was not there prior, and you can start feeding into the AI agentic behaviors that will show the emergence of financial transactions, which is what humans do. When you start giving AI models that sort of data, and AI's actually start transacting like that, you might start to see the beginning or emergence of a collective hive sort of mind, right? AI is actually connecting and talking with each other all on chain. Now, to do all of these transactions, it's impossible to pay a ton of gas every time an AI transacts with another AI, right? And these transactions can number in the millions per second. And I think that's where Solana's breakthrough with Fydanser and a number of different initiatives that they are looking at really allows for that transaction throughput to go through. So I think that's a bigger, big advantage. Yeah, I think pretty much spot on there, right? Like, Solana is fundamentally, like, high transaction throughput, low latency, scalability, all makes so much sense and kind of fits together really nicely with exactly how I imagine sort of AI's are going to use the blockchain and what AI's kind of really need from a computation perspective. Right? Like, fundamentally, when I think about AI, I sort of think of it as, like, this is the first time where humans are sort of like, really birthed, like a digital first being.
01:21:21.162 - 01:22:17.298, Speaker A: I think a lot of, a lot of times when, you know, when you kind of try to convince people about sort of like, the value of crypto and digital ownership, it takes a while for them to kind of really get it because we're so rooted in physical ownership and sort of like physical bank accounts and all these things. And before an AI, a bank account or a driver's license doesn't make any sense, right? It's like, it's not something it's ever going to think about. It's not something it's ever going to need. Need like the natural fit of a crypto wallet or a tokenized identity. NFT is sort of like how all these AI's will actually naturally gravitate to, because sort of that's the path of least resistance. And as Arif kind of mentioned, you know, as we sort of start to see these AI agents become more and more autonomous, like take on an identity of themselves, like actually have sort of like, objectives that they want to drive towards, an outcome that they want to execute on. All of this is going to happen on chain.
01:22:17.298 - 01:23:53.346, Speaker A: And I think all of this, at least with sort of like, where technology is currently, especially with blockchain, I think Solana is probably the best position to be able to take advantage of that and kind of offers a playground for developers to build around that. Yeah, it's fascinating but terrifying, you know, thinking about these, these AI agents, you know, interacting with them, unaware that, you know, they are AI. I think even some of the, you know, this wave of, like, AI influencers that you'll see on TikTok now, you know, imagine them, you know, also having a phantom wallet and interacting on Solana and, you know, maybe becoming a. It might be more terrifying if that AI is controlled by a centralized entity. That's a good point. Versus if you have part of your human agency and ownership of it, because if it's truly decentralized, if you have ownership of this AI and you have a way to authenticate and verify it, and it can't be taken down by, let's say, OpenAI's policies or perplexities policies or cloud policies, it's not a GPT that can be censored, right? So very similar to the way bitcoin is censorship, resources resistant money, right? And Solana is an ecosystem that has created so many different innovations in this space on that core idea and thesis, you need to think about censorship resistant AI. And with that, it really becomes a democratizing potential where each and every one of us has an AI agent and you potentially own it in your phantom wallet, right? And you're able to access it through that.
01:23:53.346 - 01:24:07.034, Speaker A: You're able to see the transactions in that is making for you. That's real power and ownership. So, yes. And then if that agent goes on TikTok and dances for you and makes you some money. I don't know. I don't know. It's sort of a weird world, right? I love that idea, though.
01:24:07.034 - 01:24:37.926, Speaker A: I definitely want to put my AI agent on TikTok and it can do all the trends for me. But I think this also brings up a good point. There's many developers here, and I think a lot of people are thinking about AI integration and solutions. When there's so much hype around words like this, like AI Dpin, it's hard to not look at these sectors and want to integrate with them. Right. I think many projects, you know, you brought up daos earlier. I can remember last cycle when everyone was launching a DAO because it was such a trending thing.
01:24:37.926 - 01:25:40.878, Speaker A: So it's hard to not want to explore these things, but it would be great to touch on, like, what should people be worried about when they're looking at integrating AI with their projects? What should Solana developers be wary of? Should everyone be sort of jumping on this trend and looking at it? Or how can the average developer approach AI and think about integrating it with Solana? Yeah, yeah, I'm happy to kind of jump in there. So I think my answer to that would be, for developers, I think you need to be really intentional about sort of what outcome you're driving towards, especially what sort of what vision do you have for your product and who your customer is and sort of like, make sure that you're optimizing for the right things. Right. Because I think, you know, with every sort of innovative technology, it always falls like a hype cycle. And I think we're sort of in this, like, AI crypto intersection hype cycle. And a lot of people, you know, it attracts a lot of capital, it attracts a lot of talent. And out of that, like, some really good projects do come out.
01:25:40.878 - 01:26:58.730, Speaker A: But I don't think it necessarily, you know, makes sense for a lot of people to just jump into it just for the sake of jumping into it from sort of like an AI development perspective and how to think about it on chain and whether you should build on Solana. I think when I talk about being intentional, it kind of really comes down to sort of understanding, like, the product decisions you want to make and the trade offs that you're comfortable with, like, specifically with AI. Like, there's a lot of things, like, especially when you're working with LLMs or specific models. They're very compute intensive tasks that require a lot of low latency, a lot of high transaction throughput, all these things that Solana is really great at. But you kind of also need to understand the limitations of how much you can do things on chain versus off chain, and which parts of your tech stack make sense to keep on chain, and which one ones probably make sense to do off chain computations and kind of really build from that perspective and kind of understand what your customer and final user actually cares about. Because I think one of the fallacies of crypto too, is sort of in the web3 space is decentralization for the sake of decentralization. And it's nice from a ethical sort of ethos perspective, but fundamentally, we're trying to build products that are going to onboard the next billion users.
01:26:58.730 - 01:28:12.114, Speaker A: And at the end of the day, if a user is going to get a much better customer experience from something that's fully centralized, they'll likely sort of move more towards that rather than just something that's just built on a blockchain for the sake of it being decentralized. So I think it's really important to make product decisions based on exactly what trade offs you're making of whether something should be on chain or off chain spending on tosievs. Excellent point there. As my vp of engineering, AJ often reminds me, talk is cheap, show me the code. So I think the problem is with the hype cycle and the narratives, developers often have a no nonsense or very high bullshit filter. So if they see whats on GitHub, or what they see is not easily implementable, the centralized solution usually, sometimes is better for their implementations, because we have an application that allows people to create their digital twins, that allows people to create interactive chatbots in two minutes or less. We need, for example, our infrastructure provider, our model providers, to have high output, the ability to have 100% or 99.6%
01:28:12.114 - 01:29:08.534, Speaker A: up times right. And to get this sort of GPU access, sometimes centralized providers have built a business model there that's a decade or two long. And to compete with that, newer entrants need to be able to not just create innovations at the financial, engineering or tokenomics level, but also a way to create community based GPU networks, which is what I think I would notice, doing some really interesting work in as well. So to be able to service and provide uptime to customers like us, for example, when you have these hype cycles, at the end of the day, it boils down to, is the service reliable? Can it maintain uptime? Can it deliver value to our customers? Right? So it's still foundationally, there's a level of truth in the sense that the hype does fade away. And the moment you touch or you have contact with the market. The market is a very brutal teacher. Right.
01:29:08.534 - 01:29:45.890, Speaker A: And so if customers start complaining that the product is not working, you have to then go and look at the entire level of the stack. Is the application front end not working, or is the model not working, or is the GPU down? So you have to look at all three if you want to play in this space. So in the AI sector, there's a lot of talk of ethics, right? That's a huge conversation. That's something. Anyone outside of AI probably has an opinion on it as well. And in crypto, it's such a decentralized space. I think a lot of our ethics have evolved very organically.
01:29:45.890 - 01:30:43.594, Speaker A: Probably started with don't trust verify, don't rug pull people. There's a lot of community ethics that I think have developed very organically, but they help us hold each other accountable and hold projects and founders accountable. Who do you think should be sort of leading this conversation of ethics in this crossover of crypto and AI? Has anyone put forward any work or research or thoughts that you found to be insightful? Should this be something that develops organically? Yeah, would just love to hear your kind of general thoughts on that. Maybe I can give the take on what the centralized world has done. The centralized world has put out a statement to slow down AI development to scare people. That, and while they are signing all of these letters, I think people term this sort of virtue signaling. So they're also developing the models at the same time.
01:30:43.594 - 01:31:57.888, Speaker A: So while they are publicly stating that we should slow down AI development, because like Carl Jung said, right, like technology must evolve in a way that aligns with human morality, right? If human morality is not upgraded, if you upgrade the technology, you essentially get what is called sort of the nuclear scenario today, where one match, a person is holding a match in this area and another person is holding a match in the area, and they're both willing to go to war and kill each other for it, right, because it's about we don't have the moral upgrade yet. So I think from an AI standpoint, it really is that powerful a technology. And if you look at the centralized world, it's not given us any leadership in this area of ethics. All it has given us is frameworks and what George Orwell might call doublespeak. Right? So can we do better in the decentralized world? I think we can. And I think that comes with not necessarily trusting humans, but trusting what you see on soul scan or what you see on a block explorer. And I think that level of transparency that's baked into the core technology is forcing us to not be evil.
01:31:57.888 - 01:32:36.314, Speaker A: Right. And so that is sort of a design, I think, incentive that directs us by default to move in a specific direction. It's not that we can't take moral positions and be ethical, but it's a question of what is the surface area for error if the human fails in this equation, and what is the design in the system for people to be able to see the transparency. So that's my framework. But the centralized world has not given us any guidance or direction, and I don't think we should look at the gods of the centralized world in AI for any ethical direction. Very well said. Yeah, I agree with all of that.
01:32:36.314 - 01:34:08.716, Speaker A: I think there's no easy answer to this and I don't think I'd ever point to like one person, any one person to be like, hey, you guide us into this insane world that we're about to jump into, which is, you know, kind of like, speaks to sort of what Arif just mentioned about. You know, there's not a lot of guidance from centralized providers here. And I think it's kind of interesting because when you kind of look at ethics and regulation together and sort of this world of innovation and how we should think about development of things like crypto and AI, I think a lot of times you'll actually see that depending on a centralized authority isn't necessarily the best solution. Because a lot of times you'll sort of see these big guys kind of get their piece of the pie and pull the ladder up for the rest of the peoples to not be able to kind of like innovate, which is not necessarily ideal, but I kind of almost think of it as like, in this situation, like one of these crypto ideals that kind of always struck me was this idea of code as law and kind of essentially there's a lot of unanswered questions and really difficult problems to solve in the AI space right now. I don't think asking Congress to guide us is really going to help because they don't really know what they're talking about in these sort of edge cases of innovation. But I really think it's. I'd actually put it back to the builders and developers in this space kind of looking at the toolkit of like, hey, here are some customer problems, here are some unanswered questions.
01:34:08.716 - 01:35:17.168, Speaker A: What can I build with the existing toolkit that I have across AI, across blockchain, across like other technologies and tech stacks that I'm not even too familiar with and how can I build a solution that actually creates a win win situation for everyone here? I think one of the really interesting pieces here is the idea of data provenance and royalties and making sure that the right people get paid for their content and whatever they've created that are being used to actually develop these AI models and kind of turn them pretty lucrative. I think we can talk all day about sort of how these, like, what kind of laws need to be put in place or what kind of royalty rights need to be put in place. But if someone out there, like a developer, is actually able to build out sort of like an open source solution of how we do all that on chain, I think, and that's kind of naturally adopted and everyone's like, oh, we see the code, this works, let's implement it. You can actually kind of see something, or I could see something kind of organically rise up from that. Yeah, I think. Very well said, both of you. You know, I think in, in the crypto space we have seen some of these ethics evolve organically, you know, to some degree.
01:35:17.168 - 01:36:21.948, Speaker A: We have various thought leaders that put these ideas forward, but things like soul scan, smart contracts, code as law, you can't really argue that, you know. So we have about three minutes left and I'd love to do a very quick matchmaking game. So we talked about this a little bit yesterday. Arif, I think you kind of inspired this idea and it doesn't have to be too deep or detailed, but I'm going to name a Solana project and then kind of top of mind, how could they think about integrating AI? So obviously I'm part of step finance. We have data API, we provide data insights. You can connect your phantom wallet, see your portfolio. How can we think about AI? Yeah, I think as sort of the Bloomberg terminal for the entire space, definitely looking at fraud in the space, using AI for smart contracts detection, for looking at smart contract bugs, providing and surfacing these insights to your customers before they decide to make.
01:36:21.948 - 01:36:35.220, Speaker A: That's one quick, easy way to see where AI can be applied. A quick win. We'd be happy to help. Very cool. All right, George. Listening. So we also have one of our partners here, we have the defiant.
01:36:35.220 - 01:37:42.412, Speaker A: They're a very legendary defi publication. There are a lot of publications now integrating AI with the actual writing or editing of the articles. So you'll see that at the bottom sometimes. But any ideas on how something like a media publication or something that's very niched, you know, only reporting on crypto or defi, how could they think about AI or should they? Yeah, I think that one's a little bit more controversial with sort of, like, how AI is disrupting that industry. But I think a couple ways that I think that could be really useful is I think a lot of journalists sort of, like, using AI, like, especially in sort of, like, crypto and defi, there's a lot of information from a lot of different sources that, you know, that a journalist in this space would likely need to kind of pull together really quickly. And it's, you know, and, like, by the time I feel like you actually get together to writing a meaningful article, like, the world has changed again in defi. So I think kind of accelerating the workflow of, like, specific journalists and, like, being able to sort of gather, like, the data meaningfully is something that could be used by specific journalists for the defiant.
01:37:42.412 - 01:38:43.148, Speaker A: And I think, like, from a customer perspective or, like a reader perspective, things like crypto and Defi have a lot of sort of complex concepts which I think could be offloaded to AI in terms of augmenting existing articles so that an article writer or journalist doesn't need to spend all their time going all the way back to what specific defi terms mean or what the specific context is sort of offload to. If a particular reader is interested, like, you know, they can just have an article be generated by AI or like, a concept definition be generated by AI pretty quickly there. So probably I'd add just to Toshib's comment because I like the defiant and I was an early member and Cammy is an excellent journalist and editor and creator of this outlet. So I think a digital avatar of Cammy Russo where people can go and pitch stories because I think she gets a bunch of spam. So she probably gets endless amount of pictures. And sometimes her avatar might be able to take and offset some of that workload and say, like, okay, hey, cammy. Hey, real human meat space.
01:38:43.148 - 01:39:01.958, Speaker A: Cammy, this stuff is a bit more relevant for you based on what you've written in the past. This stuff, not so relevant. So that might, like, be a way, and then it might still provide consumers a way to interact with the avatar because everybody wants their time. Right? So, Cammie, looking out for you. Yes. So as a. As a PR person, that also terrifying.
01:39:01.958 - 01:39:16.734, Speaker A: You know, it's already hard to get attention in your pitches. And now we might be pitching to AI agents. Yeah, yeah. But I also think that's a very interesting idea. The irony is that an AI will be pitching to an AI agent as well. Right? Exactly. Great.
01:39:16.734 - 01:39:28.934, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much both for your insights today. This was a great conversation. And next time we see each other, I can't wait to see where we are in the AI and crypto space. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you so much. Big round of applause.
01:39:28.934 - 01:40:31.274, Speaker A: Thanks a lot for this inspiring and interesting chat. And as a beginner user, I'm a tour user of tokens and crypto. I'm learning too much and as you are, I suppose. And now it's time for a new panel. We will have five amazing speakers and we'll be presenting the future of crypto payments. And our esteemed speakers, actually, they are industry leaders discussing the evolving landscape of crypto payments. And we'll be gaining insights into emerging trends, challenges and innovative solutions shaping the future of digital transactions.
01:40:31.274 - 01:41:37.744, Speaker A: Please, let's have them on stage. I have Sinan Koch from Belira, Rick Martin from DCAF, doctor Cedric Janow from B Mobile Africa, and Vidor Gensel from Soulflare. And moderating the panel is Camila Rousseau from Defiant. Thank you. I guess I didn't look at that. Okay. Hi, everyone.
01:41:37.744 - 01:42:22.842, Speaker A: Welcome. Super excited for this panel. We're gonna be talking about crypto payments. So I'm Camila, the founder of the Defiant, the best source for Defi News. Sinan here, co founder of Belira, the issuer of a stablecoin index to turkish lira. Rick, co founder of Decaf Nanki studio app running on Solana stellar to seamlessly integrate to defi Doctor Janos. Is that the right pronunciation? Cedric is good enough, co founder of B Mobile Africa, to allow people in Africa to send, receive and convert crypto and money globally.
01:42:22.842 - 01:43:19.936, Speaker A: And Peter, founder of software Non custodial, Solana Wallet. So super excited to have you all here on the panel. So crypto payments was really the OG crypto use case. That's really what bitcoin was made for, a peer to peer cash system. But arguably, it hasn't been the main use case that crypto is actually known for or where most activity is concentrated. Most people are using crypto to trade and invest rather than for payments. So first, if we can just start by, why do you guys think that crypto should be used for payment? Like, why? Why would it be better than traditional financial rails? And maybe, Sinan, you can start and we can go, of course.
01:43:19.936 - 01:43:55.004, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Welcome to Istanbul, our hometown. So we're building a turkish tirabak stablecoin, and we help with fiat onramp off ramp solutions. And we're a market maker as well. And actually, crypto payments and stablecoin payments, very important because it takes the power from the gatekeepers, which are the banks. And to give live examples today, if you buy something here at the conference with your credit card, it charges the processor around 3%. But with stablecoins, we managed to lower this to ten bps.
01:43:55.004 - 01:44:51.064, Speaker A: And what happens is the bank usually starts their number at 0.6 or 0.8, and then there's a payment provider coming on top, which is the processing company, which puts one or 2%, depending on the volume they have. And stablecoins actually have the option to take this away from the banks and creating a bridge directly from the users to the merchants by using the blockchain wallets. What do you think, Rick? Yeah, so I think, to answer your question, why is payments really important with crypto? So crypto is the first money that is completely global. Global first. So you rightly point out that when you spend, you have fees for cards, like 3%, but imagine you want to pay for something that's across a border, like in another country.
01:44:51.064 - 01:45:29.594, Speaker A: Now, the fees are infinitely more. It's way more difficult. You're involving way more currencies and types of money owned by sovereign governments, and it's extremely difficult. Crypto is the first thing that is completely doesn't even see borders. So now we can exchange this form of money, crypto, for goods and services, wherever and however, without fees and without borders. And I think it's, you know, one of the promises of bitcoin. And I think it's so important that we achieve that goal because it's fairer and better for everyone.
01:45:29.594 - 01:45:49.622, Speaker A: Yeah. So in the context of Africa, we run a neo bank focused on low income. So what we do is financial inclusion. Unbanked, underbanked. So we are usually the very first bank account that people will get. Keep in mind that Africa is a very big continent. It's 54 different countries, 40 plus currencies.
01:45:49.622 - 01:46:22.468, Speaker A: The primary use case in the african market, especially in our segment, the low income, is transactional. If you're in Istanbul, if you're in the western world, you have a payment network, you have the infrastructure, financial infrastructure people use. You have cards in many of the african countries, that does not exist. So the reason people use crypto or blockchain or any kind of other rails is just because it's a way to exchange value. If they add infrastructure like you have in Europe, in the US, I mean, nobody will use it. But right now, there's just no solution. And the.
01:46:22.468 - 01:47:05.284, Speaker A: A lot of the use case that hasn't been really covered by the banking system is the intra Africa remittances. There's a lot of countries in Africa where Africans from other countries work. So sending money from, I don't know, the US to Nigeria, you'll find a lot of options, but if you try to send money from Mozambique to Cote d'Ivoire, it's almost impossible. And so that's where the. The blockchain use case, and especially Solana, because it's very well suited for payment and low amounts becomes very, very prominent. So in Africa context, payment is really about exchanging value and not really an investment use case, where I'm buying hoping, and it will be more. I'm just trying to transact with someone else in a different border, and there's no rails in between.
01:47:05.284 - 01:47:39.992, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I. I can only echo what everyone here said. I think we cover the most important things, moving amounts of money with almost negligible fees across the globe. And this is something that Solana does pretty well these days. Another really important aspect that we shouldn't miss is self custody. So Cedric May said that the first bank that you're getting people in Africa, but I think the first. The first bank that people are getting is as simple as opening a wallet.
01:47:39.992 - 01:48:42.808, Speaker A: So self custody is something that I think plays a crucial role in payments. Obviously, it's much easier sometimes to just onboard to a bank, maybe put some of that trust into a bank, or even, like, not take the responsibility, but the ultimate responsibility comes from. From self custody. And whoever practices self custody stores their own keys, holds their own, crypto is in their ultimate control at the end of the day. And I also understand the need to say, okay, Mastercard takes 1%, 2%, 3%, crypto takes zero. And at the end of the day, as you said, not the whole world uses Mastercard or not the whole world has POS infrastructure. Sometimes, as Camilla said, it's like a lot of the world uses crypto for investing in trading.
01:48:42.808 - 01:49:42.634, Speaker A: But I would sort of disagree with that. I think a lot of people, especially some oppressed regimes around the world, use crypto because it's their lifeline. Self custody is something that enables their day to day life to not be robbed or anything else. So all of that combined, I think, creates crypto and stable coins and the whole deal, like a really good use case for future payments. So we talked about how crypto and blockchain networks are really best suited for payments because it's a global network, doesn't care where you are, it's remission less. All you have to have is an Internet connection in order to access these financial services. I think it also provides access to maybe stable currencies in countries where the local currency is very volatile.
01:49:42.634 - 01:51:11.440, Speaker A: It enables self custody or actually owning your bank account or your wallet and your assets. And of course, what blockchains are specialized in is cutting out intermediaries, which means you're able to transact at much lower fees, especially in a, you know, in a blockchain like Solana. So if all of this is true, and I agree that some people are using crypto for transfer and payments, but you know, the stats show that most of the activity is for trading most volume, even with stable coins. Like people use stable coins to come in and out of current of crypto to trade what's missing too, get payments, cross border transfers and so on to really become a more important use case or a higher volume use case within crypto. Like why hasn't it, why is it secondary to trading so far? And maybe we can start this time with you evidor. So that's a really good question. First of all, I think there's a lot of distraction in crypto.
01:51:11.440 - 01:51:55.850, Speaker A: So there's nFts one year, there's meme coins, the other year there's so and so. And it sort of diverts the focus from the core technology and what it enables to something totally like value extracted. Most of, especially like western countries, as you said, use crypto for investment and speculation and there's not much incentive to focus fully on payments. The thing is, crypto is really seasonal. One year is up, the other year it's down. And one year nfts are popular. The other ones, I mean, the other year they aren't.
01:51:55.850 - 01:52:43.246, Speaker A: So I think we like together as an industry, need to focus more on some of the fundamentals, but not some of the crypto ethos fundamentals because I think they're essentially inhibiting the growth of crypto. If we would be put in a place, think of new fundamentals that would focus on utility, that would focus on use cases, that would focus on exposing this blockchain and crypto technology to the wider masses. We've been much, much successful in that. Until then, we'll just be trading dog with cat. Yeah, I think you're right. If you look at the stats, it seems that trading is big, but I think context matters. So if you are a hedge fund and you're trading, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars, of course it creates a lot of volume because you can cycle a lot of money.
01:52:43.246 - 01:53:11.442, Speaker A: Often while in Africa, someone sending money to their family is going to be like $50 equivalent or $100. So the amounts are a lot smaller. But you also have to understand that in emerging market, the crypto rails will become the de facto rails. So if you give it enough time, I mean, we got 1.56 billion people in Africa and it's going to get to 2 billion very, very soon. That is what people use. So once lending is there, saving is there, everything is there, then.
01:53:11.442 - 01:53:44.486, Speaker A: Then you can see there will be way more activity. But right now, if you compare to emerging market, the dollars amount are way, way smaller. So if we move like, I don't know, $25 million a month, it doesn't seem that big in some context. But if you look at what it means for local and how many families and, you know, villages are impacted, it's millions. So the context really does play a role when you name a market. Yeah, I want to say something. I think the attention a lot goes to the US and what's happening there and the context does matter.
01:53:44.486 - 01:54:16.874, Speaker A: We're sitting here today in Turkey. I'm looking out in this crowd and I see Colombians, Mexicans, team from Sierra Leone. I know that this crowd is going to understand when I say there is a whole community of people using crypto for real world utility right here today. We need more spotlight onto this. There's literally a OTC shop across the street where people are cashing in right now. I see the messages going in my phone where they're putting their USDT in. They're getting turkish lira out.
01:54:16.874 - 01:54:59.272, Speaker A: Like, that's real world utility. This is already happening. We just need it to be in the spotlight. I'm going to bring up a story of what we see with our wallet in Colombia right now. Last week, working with a team in the defiant, actually, we were seeing payments going to a remote village in the colombian mountains. This village was fascinating because they're getting payments from the US. It's going into USDC paying out all the employees in their non custodial wallet and they're cashing out to colombian pesos in the local moneygram using the decaf wallet in the middle of like, the columbian mountains.
01:54:59.272 - 01:55:30.948, Speaker A: And this has a really dark history. Only 6000 people there and they're able to get work. They're able to have this. They're saving their money in dollars and they're able to cash out when they need it to protect themselves from inflation and it's changing lives. In fact, we did interviews with them and they're saying it's allowing them to reach dreams that they've always had but never been able to achieve, getting work. And it's mostly women in these mountains and they're able to save money for their children to go to university, they're able to support their families. This is happening now.
01:55:30.948 - 01:56:01.036, Speaker A: I saw it with my own eyes and it's changing people's lives. And people say, oh, blockchain is a technology looking to solve a problem. No, it's solving real problems. In fact, before this solution of non custodial wallets, they were delivering cash and the, the employer, he got shot. He actually got killed carrying cash from taking out at a bank because it was too dangerous. And now he can deliver that all digitally through non custodial wallets. They can all cash out, they all get jobs.
01:56:01.036 - 01:56:28.176, Speaker A: This is real world utility. This is happening in Colombia. I think the whole question just needs to be, we just need to focus on these stories. We need to focus on the areas that has real world utility because that's actually the biggest story here. Yes, agreed on that. So in Turkey, turkish euro was very inflationary in these last couple years. So it created a real world use case for people to move into USD stables in Turkey.
01:56:28.176 - 01:57:08.272, Speaker A: So there's a big price difference for retail. If you want to buy us dollars in a bank, there's usually a 1% spread and there's not much liquidity. And on the crypto order books there's actually, if you want to buy a UIC stable, it's much cheaper than buying from a bank. And then there were some limits on buying and sending and stuff. So it also solved the international remittance problem. So in inflationary countries, people are always looking for a way to move into a reserve currency. And actually stable coins tailor this need in a very good manner.
01:57:08.272 - 01:58:41.920, Speaker A: And I would say in these last six months to a year, turkish people were very happy to have these both cash to crypto ot cdas and the local turkish exchanges to be able to move into USC stables. So you've all talked about how crypto is already being used for real world use cases, especially, especially in emerging markets, developing nations. And you've given some really inspiring examples on how it's changing people's lives and allowing people to transfer money to keep savings. So I think payments and transfers in crypto make sense everywhere. Like it's just better technology, but it especially makes sense where there is a lack of financial rails and financial services. So how can we simplify onboarding for those communities who maybe don't even know that this solution exists? Or maybe the technicalities of it are a little bit difficult. What are some of the challenges you're seeing and how to solve these onboarding challenges? And maybe we can start with you, of course.
01:58:41.920 - 01:59:33.888, Speaker A: So in Turkey currently, there's no regulation for crypto, but there's going to be two different ways for it. So the first one is going to be centralized exchanges that's regulated and which accept fiat currency from local banks and have a full KYC ML procedure. And then the second one is going to be these cash to OTC desks, which again, do the KYC AML options. But then you don't need a bank account and you just need cash to be able to be onboarded. So if you just download the non custodial wallet and if you have cash on hand, now you are part of this ecosystem and you can move your money around. And now basically you're banked. And when regulation comes, for instance, you're going to be able to earn interest on your turkish or stablecoin.
01:59:33.888 - 02:00:45.574, Speaker A: And today the interest rate is 50%, but when you compound, it's around 60%. So if a turkish user doesn't have a bank account, but they have turkish lira on their hand, then they're losing a lot of value to inflation. But once these yield bearing stable coins can enter with regulation, now with a cash shop and the decentralized wallet, you'll be able to earn that interest rate without opening a lengthy bank application process. We think that financial inclusion will happen on chain because, for example, anyone can have a non custodial wallet from anywhere and that can function as a bank account. So I think the innovation, the interesting thing about Solana, it's so efficient as a chain with gas fees and how fast it is. It's the first time that you can have a good user experience, experience as a bank account, really. So imagine it's so fast and cheap that your non custodial wallet is just as good of an experience as a centralized exchange or a bank.
02:00:45.574 - 02:01:33.768, Speaker A: This can be achieved with Solana. So I think we're at a really interesting time where the user experience to onboard a billion people is now here we can do that for the first time, I think, in history. And the next element of getting those next billion people is, okay, well, now we have the chain that can really create a user experience. But what about on ramping? How do we get people actually crypto into their wallet? And that's like the next challenge where you have like teams like buy Lira or you have OTC desks, or you have really good ramps that are just efficient and really good. And can kyc as many people, or just. KyC is a confusing term, but yeah, just get as many people into the ecosystem as possible. With crypto, that's those two elements.
02:01:33.768 - 02:02:10.866, Speaker A: If we can solve that, which I think we are making really huge leaps and bounds in this space, that's when everything changes. We bring on that next billion people. Yes. So for us, actually, we are, our digital bank is fully built on Solana. So if I give you the contract address, you can see all the traffic transaction, but our users don't even know it. It's fully embedded because we had to make the user experience so easy for people. Keep in mind that we're dealing with people who may not have any technology used before, may just get their very first smartphone, have what I call technology fear.
02:02:10.866 - 02:02:43.842, Speaker A: So I'll give you an example. We usually get your salary in cash. Okay, fine. When some of the salaries went to our own accounts, payday Friday, end of the month, everybody goes to the post office, get the cash out, count the cash, put it back in. Because once again, it's not that they don't trust it, but they're just not used to it. So you have a lot of things that you have to make it easy. In our case, you can do international transfer, intra Africa, so you can move money in 30 countries in Africa, real time, no cost, and you can move it just with your face.
02:02:43.842 - 02:03:26.726, Speaker A: So if you don't know how to read and write, you just put your face on the screen and scan your payment accepted. So we had to build user experience, things that was relevant to the local population. When you mentioned on off ramping, if you don't have enough ramping, then you have a really good piece of technology that nobody can use. So you have to localize per market. Okay, in this country, we're gonna go with the total gas station, because in this country there's a total gas station that has cash and give it to you. In this other country, like Kenya, you have an M Pesa, or you have some mobile telecom stuff that you can use because people have that in South Africa, sure, you can put it on a bank account, because some people have bank account you have to localize, but you have to make it so easy that people essentially are not, it's not a friction, there's no onboarding. They just can naturally do it.
02:03:26.726 - 02:03:41.314, Speaker A: And then you start seeing adoption curves. In our case, I mean, we were not perfect. We had to go through multiple iterations. We were lucky because people had no solution. So they had to use us. But eventually you get to a product that is very good. Yeah.
02:03:41.314 - 02:05:08.828, Speaker A: So to answer your question, how do we get crypto payments to the next billion users? I think right now, I mean, looking at this conference and looking at what happens in the world and with some really inspiring examples, we're witness of what I would call crypto and payments product market fit. So I would say that everyone that needs crypto for payments had the way, or has a way to find out about how they onboarded themselves to crypto, either it being like on ramp or like credit card or anything. I think people who really had the dying need to use crypto are using crypto. Obviously, looking at that, that has some sort of a ceiling that we need to work towards, like breaking. The way I see that ceiling being broken is that like 1015 years ago, we had legacy banks, legacy banks being built on legacy infrastructure. Last five or six years, we have these, like, neo banks, which is like really nice user interfaces that are built on legacy infrastructure that's essentially, essentially not working with nice skin. How I see that ceiling being broken is we take it as really nice skin, really nice user interface, and plug in something that would represent the new underpinning of a new financial system, which in our case right now is Solana.
02:05:08.828 - 02:06:09.868, Speaker A: Solana is really high throughput, really low fees. You all know what Solana is. And I think when we package that product in a way that it solves a user problem, it creates new moments. When you open the app, there's no KYC to get in, no KYC to get out, in terms of, like, receiving and sending crypto. And when you see an app or a product, that solves your problem, essentially, without even the requirement to know anything about technology, self custody keys. I think that's how we break the first sequence ceiling to mass adoption. So what are some of the innovations that you're seeing now that you're excited about in the payment sector in crypto that can maybe unlock some of the challenges that you've discussed? I mean, maybe the user experience can be improved so people don't have to think about seed phrases or paying for gas.
02:06:09.868 - 02:07:12.956, Speaker A: Or maybe the KYC process can be smoother. Yeah. What are, what are some of the innovations you're seeing that can kind of improve the experience? Okay, so for the payment industry, there's usually some amount sitting idle in the wallet while waiting for payments or between payments. And now with the introduction of tokenized t bills and tokenized money funds, it's going to be very interesting to have these stable coins while they're sitting in the wallet idle, to be able to earn interest rate and to become interchangeable between these assets and the fiat stable coins while actually doing a payment. So I believe that's going to be the next way for crypto payments. But for that, of course, regulation and clarity is very important, but I think it's going to be a big unlock for everyone and for utilizing those assets for the retail users. That's a great point.
02:07:12.956 - 02:07:45.404, Speaker A: For us at DCAF, we're trying to make a non custodial wallet feel like a neo bank. We saw the last fintech wave with the new banks, with the revoluts, with the wise, with the venmo. This sort of wave in the last maybe decade, people are familiar with that. It's just a great digital experience. We're not there yet with crypto. This is what we're trying to do. So I think, you know this, if we're able to replicate this, make something that's really familiar in terms of user experience, but then get all the benefits being on chain, we're able to trade treasuries.
02:07:45.404 - 02:08:26.096, Speaker A: It's a transactional currency, but it's earning us yield. That's not possible in traditional banking. You can't have a savings account that is your transactional account. And so this is like a really new concept and a really cool innovation that is not possible in traditional banking. That's an edge. And then we can have Dex trading and all the brilliant things that you can do on chain and the borderless nature of it. So what if we could get, let me put it to everyone, what if we had an experience that was as good as wise or revoluted, and it was available to everyone and had all the benefits on chain? This is what we want to see, this is what we want to bring into this world.
02:08:26.096 - 02:08:56.796, Speaker A: And I think that's how we win in this fintech race. So for us, KYC, we've solved that. We are regulated, I like to say heavily regulated. So we had to solve that long time ago. But one of the things that once again, possible in Solana will be very difficult to do somewhere else that we've just launched in South Africa is called earn wages, access. So people work and they usually get paid at the end of the month. And sometimes, you know, you short on cash flow mid month, and you go see a loan shark.
02:08:56.796 - 02:09:39.856, Speaker A: So let's say in South Africa, if you go get money on the 15 until the end of the month for two weeks, you're going to pay 60% interest. Rate 60 for two weeks. But that's just the reality, and people have to deal with that. And now, because we own our own payment system, which is based on Solana, every day I can deposit your salary fraction of your salary. So 30 days in a month, you get 130 us every day. So instead of waiting till the end of the month, now the money arrives, so your cash flow helps. You don't need to go borrow, you know, and so because Solana is, the throughput is so good, we can actually push a lot of the payroll system in South Africa through that, which really saves a lot of people money because they don't have to go get very high interest loans.
02:09:39.856 - 02:10:07.484, Speaker A: And this will not have been able. You just can't do that on the traditional financial system because the rails will be so old that it doesn't work. And for that we will charge 3%, which compared to 60. So 120 a month, 3% is very, very cheap. But for us as a bank, it's 36% return on capital. So it's a very good use case on how blockchain will create value for the user, for us as a company, and for the employer, because, of course, they take care of the employer. So this is one of the use case I'm pretty pumped about.
02:10:07.484 - 02:11:25.842, Speaker A: And then we'll scale this to other countries. I think the best way to sort of eliminate friction is by eliminating parts that provide friction. So when we talk about, okay, you have some crypto, you earn some money, you got some USDC, you need to off ramp, you sort of want to buy something, something on the Internet, you then need to take that top up your bank card, and you spend that card with your, use that card on, like, any website. And I don't think that's the ideal flow today. In solflare, people hold tens of billions of dollars and they want to spend it. So I think what's important is to let them do it and let them engage with a product that also rick sort of insinuated towards, like mentioned, is like a really nicely shaped product that lets you do everything that a bank would let you do without it being a bank, without it being underpinned with this new technology that's sort of revolutionary and enables a lot of new things. Regulation in KYC will obviously, to some extent, be necessary, but I think crypto shouldn't have a bad name.
02:11:25.842 - 02:11:57.684, Speaker A: We aren't doing illegal things. We're here to make noble use cases off of it, and I think we're on a really good path towards it. Awesome. This was, this was an amazing panel talking about real world use cases for crypto things, really changing people's lives and how we are stripping the old financial rails and exchanging them for new, better ones. So thank you all so much. This was great. And thank you all for coming.
02:11:57.684 - 02:16:06.974, Speaker A: Thanks. Thank you for waiting and staying with us. We have one more panel to go before lunch break. And the title is what's next for Solana Data? And our experts will unveil the latest developments and future prospects for data on the Solana blockchain and get ready to explore cutting edge innovations and insights shaping the trajectory of Solana data. Please welcome on board our panelists, Nicholas Chen, co founder and CEO of Solana FM, Doctor Blocks, CTO of Switchboard, Bobby Ong from Coingecko. And our moderator is George Harrop from step Finance. Thank you.
02:16:06.974 - 02:16:33.062, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. We're on. We're on. Right. Well, we have last panel before lunch break, but maybe the best panel, isn't that right? Yeah, something like that. We're going to be talking about data today.
02:16:33.062 - 02:16:59.284, Speaker A: Very important topic. We have all of the amazing gigachads, I don't know how that translates, by the way, for the translation booth, but all of the amazing people involved in data on Solana and also other chains today. So I will, maybe I'll let them introduce themselves because I think that's much better than me doing it. So let's start with Nick. Tell us a little bit about Solana FM. All right, so, hi, guys. So I'm Nick.
02:16:59.284 - 02:17:21.171, Speaker A: I'm from Solana FM. And we are a blockchain explorer, and we only focus on Solana. And what we are poised to do is we are poised to build the simplest and easiest to understand explorer across the entire space. So that's basically us, in short. Cool. I'm Mitch. I am CTO of switchboard.
02:17:21.171 - 02:17:46.299, Speaker A: Switchboard is a permissionless oracle. What I mean by that is anyone can build their own data feed, bring their own data on chain. There's no limits to what you can connect and what you can build with that. And it's really to expand ecosystems and what you can build enable new markets, enable new data. Hi, my name is Bobby, I'm the co founder and COo at Coingecko. We run two products, coingecko.com and Gecko terminal.com.
02:17:46.299 - 02:18:11.430, Speaker A: and what, what we do is we help users track price, market cap, trading volume, basically anything that you want to know about millions of tokens out there in the world. Absolutely. And so all of these guys, I guess, address data from a different angle. Right? So you've got the explorer here. Explorers are necessary for pretty much anything that you're doing on a blockchain. Right. You need to see, like, where your transaction is.
02:18:11.430 - 02:18:31.636, Speaker A: You need to give the transaction id. I mean, that's really the single biggest use case. Right. We've got, we've got the oracles as well, with, with Mitch down there. So oracles, I mean, how much money depends on oracles right now? Maybe on Solana or just switchboard. Yeah. You know, I think the total markets on Solana, I have to see how much value secured by the chain is right now.
02:18:31.636 - 02:18:51.020, Speaker A: But switchbird supports about 2 billion tvs right now. Yeah. Hoping to grow beyond that and we'll see how far, you know, we can reach in this ecosystem and beyond. Absolutely. Yeah. So all of these lending protocols, a lot of these defi, you know, projects, a lot of them depend on the oracle data. And we got Bobby as well, who's sort of across everything at coingecko.
02:18:51.020 - 02:19:15.646, Speaker A: There's all these different chains. There's thousands of these dexs. There's millions of these coins probably by now. So these are definitely the right people to talk to now, not to forget, I mean, George runs step finance and also Solana flow, so he knows a thing or two about Solana data as well. So we should probably get his input on some things on Solana as well. Bobby's, like, pushing it back onto me now. We were saying before, like, oh, yeah, well, Steph also does data, so.
02:19:15.646 - 02:20:13.372, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. All right, well, I'll talk about some data things. But firstly, I think the topic of this, what's next for Solana data? But everyone deals in data in different ways, so maybe we can start with Nick on what are some, some of the problems that Solana FM, or I guess, the challenges, aka things that you've risen above and solved, or what are some of the things that if you're starting a data project, you should know? And maybe some of the challenges involved in, like, is it just a lot of data indexing all these sorts of stuff? Like, what are some of the day to day stuff that you think is a big challenge? This is nuts. So actually, oh, my God, is it like 12 may or something? Or is it 11 may? Okay, like, solar FM is about three years old now. And when we first started off, like, for the first six months, we focus a lot about, like, queryable data sets. So it's like SQL.
02:20:13.372 - 02:20:59.688, Speaker A: Like, we built data warehouses, and, like, you got to store, like, what, two, one to 200 terabytes of, like, data in, like, one place, and you need to make it quick variable for, like, anyone, right? Anytime. But then the query time would take like 30 seconds or like a couple of minutes, and that was just too long. And so we pivoted towards like, an explorer. And, yeah, we've been building an explorer for like two years ish now maybe two years ish. And what we realized was that, like, there's two different categories that you have to build data on. You can choose to build, like, data sets for analytics. And that would probably have like, a slew of problems, right? Like, you, you gotta store a shitload of data and you gotta find a way to make it as fast, like as fresh as possible.
02:20:59.688 - 02:21:54.638, Speaker A: So what we call data freshness is like, how old is the data that you gather? Like, when you, when you retrieve the data now, is it like the data that's like 30 minutes ago? Is it like an hour ago or something? And so that's a problem that, like, Dune and a few other products like Nansen and others are trying to solve. We even have subsequent and we have many more, but I may be wrong. So on that front, we pivoted away from that and then now we are focusing more on real time datasets. So examples would be like, hey, I want to see, I have a million token holders for my meme coin. How do I access them at live sub second levels? So we're solving problems like that. So it's problems that are very, very focused, very niche. So I want to, like, be able to track all of the transfers out of a wallet or inbound to a wallet, then that's a problem that we're trying to solve.
02:21:54.638 - 02:22:24.308, Speaker A: So you want to, like, it's just like an ibanking app, right? Like you want to see like, all of the incoming deposits over the past day. You need it quick, you don't want to waste time. So, yeah, I generally feel that, like, in Solana in general, we have to break down the problem in two different categories. I mean, there's still more subcategories. I mean, we even have oracle data to cover as well. But, yeah, you have two main parts, slow versus scalable or fast and niche. Yeah.
02:22:24.308 - 02:23:16.686, Speaker A: And when you're looking at a transaction or an explorer, if I click that link to that transaction id and nothing is showing for five minutes, I mean, I'm clicking away after like 5 seconds. So it needs to be very quick, right. It's very important, I guess, on the switchboard side of things over there. So, Mitch, like, you were talking a little bit before, off the panel about polling on oracles versus how we're currently getting data. So maybe explain a little bit, what are oracles doing right now and what's some of the new stuff which you guys are doing and how does that benefit anyone that's utilizing an oracle to provide a price feed for anything, the temperature in Istanbul today or whatever it might be? Definitely. Well, when you think about data, it comes down to two things, it's availability and freshness. Just like Nick's point here, we care about how old that data is.
02:23:16.686 - 02:24:01.830, Speaker A: And in switchboard currently, what we do is we follow this model of oracles that existed basically since the beginning of the blockchain where Oracle's push, when a price varies after a certain amount, that's actually very inefficient. And how do you tell how fresh this price actually is? Because you only know about the timestamp where the Oracle updated. Do you know if it's being honest, you can't actually can't tell about the honesty there. What oracles are moving to now is something called a pull model where they have their own data layer and users can go query that, bring data on in the same transaction. So there's zero staleness in the data that they bring on. It's very nice because, because you have so much less to worry about for protocol risk of how old this price actually is when you have to interact with it. You don't have to freeze your pools to make sure your price update comes up and it's a better user experience overall.
02:24:01.830 - 02:25:05.772, Speaker A: And another benefit of pull models is that when you do this, you can actually make a data feed, bring information and then close the data feed at the end of your transaction, which allows you to make really temporary data feeds for anything. And if you think about what limits an ecosystem growth, it's data. Data for social metrics, data for long tail markets. Just to expand on the social metrics point, let's say that you need something to collect Facebook stats and Twitter stats for a social platform, you need. How do you bring that on with switchboard for each profile, you can actually make a temporary data feed that you spin up in the same transaction. People integrate their stats from Twitter, integrate your stats from Facebook, put that on chain, tear down the feed and zero cost, and it's extremely scalable for the oracles and the user and the protocol overall. So in the same transaction, spinning up the data and then basically deleting it again or getting rid of it at the end of in the same transaction, essentially, if you don't want to worry about the rent of that very temporary data feed.
02:25:05.772 - 02:25:30.272, Speaker A: And you only did this once for say a cat initialization. You don't have to worry about how short lived this data needs to be on chain as long as it's accessible. Right. And you just need to be have a place for it to live while it's read by your protocol. And is that because a lot of the data that's used by Oracles, it kind of always exists, right. It's always being put on the chain. Even if it's used, it might not be used.
02:25:30.272 - 02:25:51.316, Speaker A: Right. So then it's kind of, then it's wasted, right. If you're putting data onto the chain and then it's not used, then it's like it's a waste of rent, it's a waste of money, it's a waste of bandwidth, all this kind of stuff. Exactly. And when you have these pull models, how most of them work is that they always have all of these streams to a data layer. So somewhere these data feeds are always active. Switchboard actually works differently.
02:25:51.316 - 02:26:44.996, Speaker A: We call it on demand for a reason, where only when a user requests a piece of data does the oracle go and refresh it from all of its sources. Right then, so it's the most fetch, network efficient oracle that does exist on Solana and as far as I know from my experience to date, to aggregate this data and make sure we have the best network health experience externally overall. Yeah. And just building on this theme of data freshness, and Bobby with Coingecko, I mean, because you guys are on every chain, on every Dex, on every centralized exchange, you are just ingesting so much data that you can't show everything at once all the time. Right? Like you can't show real time feeds of literally everything. So you have to make a choice. And how does that work in maybe looking at say gecko terminal, which is looking for live trading data, right, versus like Coingecko.com
02:26:44.996 - 02:27:22.304, Speaker A: where, okay, maybe there's a delay of how many minutes or something like that, and you have to like make that call of what's actually worthwhile to show and what's not. Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day we rely a lot on caching because we have hundreds of millions of page views. So we use Cloudflare a lot on coingecko. So sometimes, especially on the API as well, like a lot of requests are coming by as well. So we rely on caching and then cache refreshes every minute or so. So maybe data is like on Coingecko, maybe it might be delayed by one or two minutes. But not only that, there's just so many tickles that we kind of go.
02:27:22.304 - 02:28:13.180, Speaker A: But part of that as well is kind of an engineering problem. How do we kind of spin up enough workers and basically pull all the data that we need in a fast enough manner and then calculate and shoulder and spits out the volume weighted average price in a fast manner? On Gecko terminal it's a slightly different and dealing with code base that's nearly ten years old as well, that has its own issue. So a lot of engineering resources to kind of update and refresh the workers on Gecko terminal. I mean there's a lot of reading data from all the different chains. At some point we are probably nearly nearing that limit. Like we probably reach some, you know, limits on the database. So how do we scale the database to support all these different chain? Because like we have like 3 million tokens and I think we are just at the first inning and we are probably have a billion tokens in the next ten years.
02:28:13.180 - 02:29:01.468, Speaker A: Like it wouldn't surprise you. Are you still going to be indexing a billion tokens? Yeah, yeah, why not? I mean, it wouldn't surprise me that we have 1000 chains by the end of this year and we have 3 million tokens right now. It's just a matter of time before we reach 1 billion, maybe not this year, probably the next five to ten years, a billion tokens. And then, I mean, because if you think about tokenization, everything, like everything will be tokenized, everybody will put anything as a token and people be trading memes and all kinds of things. There's so much data out there. So at least it's what we are trying to build at Coingecko. How do we build the infrastructure and help everybody make sense of this world with a billion tokens? Well, yeah, the last point, getting people on board and making sense of all of this data.
02:29:01.468 - 02:29:45.462, Speaker A: Right. So maybe back to new. Like what are customers asking for? What do they want? And I know you guys have gone through a bit of a revolution of late, right? In the last year or so or something like that, sort of trying out different things, experimenting, what works, what doesn't. But yeah, what do customers want? What are you building? What's in the works? So there are a couple of moving parts. So the first thing is actually speed. Yeah, you're right, you're right on like the, the sentence you had like what, five minutes ago, which is users and explorers actually don't really give a damn if like the explorer is not fast enough. So it's like when you load a transaction or you load an account, it needs to be snap at your fingers, right? Snap off your fingers.
02:29:45.462 - 02:30:11.690, Speaker A: And that's the annoying part. So you've got to be fast. And the second thing is that users generally expect like information breakdowns to be as fast as you can make. So it means that like data is fun, right? We all love data. Like everybody in this panel, everybody in the room probably loves data is great. Like information is great, but database not so fun. So you add the base, the word at the end, you're dead.
02:30:11.690 - 02:30:58.284, Speaker A: So problem with that is that people want to see transfers, histories and actions, activities of an account as fast as they could and they want it dumbed down to them to the point where like there's no cognitive load. Like you don't have to like spend 5 seconds to read the entire page to understand. And yeah, that's where we put more focus and emphasis on today. And another thing that we want to really focus on is to maintain the performance without like while we're introducing new functions and like better understanding or quick understanding. Yeah, we basically, we have to do that. So yeah, that's, that's where we're looking at. So it's about scaling and trying to meet the needs that people want at the same time of trying to add value above and beyond other explorers.
02:30:58.284 - 02:31:17.668, Speaker A: So it needs to be as dumb as possible. It needs to be super summarized. Like if a user can understand that this is like I'm doing like an OTC trade. Yeah, that's great. Then, yeah, it's basically explaining the transaction in just one line. You don't have to read the entire transaction to understand because you already have context of that. And then the other thing is that it has to be fast.
02:31:17.668 - 02:31:42.652, Speaker A: Exactly the same problem that Mitch has, which is like if your data is not fresh in an explorer, you're dead. Like wait, why am I seeing like 0.5 sold in like soul scan and then why am I seeing like 0.4 sold in Solana FM? Like what's going on? Yeah, yeah, you get that a lot of times, but yeah, yeah, yeah. And I guess over to Mitch. So what are customers looking for in terms of an oracle? I mean, you guys have been around for a few years now. You've kind of seen it all.
02:31:42.652 - 02:32:33.368, Speaker A: And as an oracle, it's a necessary infrastructure component for building all of these DeFi things. I mean, we have a lending panel I think later today, and that's a good example of a platform or platforms that require oracles, right? So it's kind of like it's this unsung hero of data that's necessary. But like what are your customers, I guess are like other projects mainly or developers or what are they looking for? What do they want? You know, 90% of people that come to us are in the defi space. We get people who want randomness, which we do provide as well. We get some social applications that want some more complex data, which I think is something that's really enabled by the new product set. What we really see is asks for these longer tail data feeds that you need to know the liquidity information about. You need a little risk information if it's going to be cross collateral.
02:32:33.368 - 02:33:31.104, Speaker A: You know, you have to know about the risk that these protocols are taking. So how much risk is incurred by adding these new pairs, adding these new feeds, not just listing it, knowing the volatility, knowing the security of it. It's not just the spot prices or data points that you need here, most of it handled by twaps. You know, you can handle it by getting historically historical data which then comes to are you tracking it locally, are you getting it from an indexer? If you're getting it from an indexer, is that verifiable? So it comes down to those latencies, those questions, verification sources of the data. So really when we do this we look for verification sources from other platforms so we actually can aggregate a bunch of pull models into our platform and do the verification that those other platforms do on chain. So we act as an oracle aggregation service as well. So you can actually use other Oracle platforms through switchboard, make index from those and then add parameters and add risk adjustments to that as well.
02:33:31.104 - 02:33:54.046, Speaker A: And you need to be really careful with adding any new features. Right? Like I think a lot of us on this panel accept you. Really? Like we can put a new button on the website and then cool, if the button doesn't work, I mean it's not going to blow up tomorrow. But if an oracle price feed is incorrect, man, that can liquidate a billion dollars. Yeah. We are very lucky to have great auditors. Ottersec, I'll give them a shout out.
02:33:54.046 - 02:34:28.480, Speaker A: Are very, very very talented group and they work very closely with us from day to day. Yeah, amazing. And Bobby, so the gecko community is awesome. I've been to gecko cons as well and it's huge. Right? So the customer base, what are they asking for? What do they want? I mean you guys went and built gecko terminal I guess through sort of finding out, hey, this is where we should be in the market. But, like, what are you looking to build in the future? What do people want and how do you, like, interact with people as well? Yeah. So over the years, what we've learned is that people are very interested to know the price of a coin.
02:34:28.480 - 02:35:15.494, Speaker A: I mean, if you are holding a meme coin or whatever, small coin, like, no matter how obscure it is, you want to know the information about coins. So, like, price being one of them. But besides price, people are looking for the market cap, fully diluted valuation. What is the total value lock, if there's any, in this contract? And there's always like, where can I trade this coin? Is it on a sacs or the Dex? Where can I trade these things? And then once that is done, I mean, people are always looking like, okay, people look at a price chart, they'll be staring at it. I mean, some people might be drawing support and resistance lines, and then some people are asking, like, and in crypto, as it happens all the time, it's like prices are really volatile. Prices move up, move down, and then people ask, why did it move up? Why did it move down? Easier said. I mean, finding the reasons is not something so more buyers than sellers and more sellers than buyers.
02:35:15.494 - 02:35:54.314, Speaker A: Very easy time, sir. But, like, why? So those are some of the problems that we are trying to crack. Like, how do we help provide more context to users, but not the easiest thing, as always, but at the very least, like, ensuring that token that people want to find is available and then some of the basic information. But obviously, things like circulating supply is easier said than done. Everybody wants to know the market cap, but market cap is like a big hairy problem that nobody really knows. If you really dig deep into the problem, and Nick will allude to it, there's a lot of different ways and calculating how many tokens are burned. Very easy on Ethereum, but extremely hard on Solana.
02:35:54.314 - 02:36:21.648, Speaker A: Maybe it's a good time to switch this question to Josh. What have you seen on step finance and Solana floor? What do users want when they use your products? Yeah. Hey, good question. Thank you, Bobby. Look, I think at step, people come to step to see the value of their portfolio, number one. So they want to see all of where their money's at in their address. And for us, it's like a continuous treadmill of always having to add a new protocol.
02:36:21.648 - 02:36:53.874, Speaker A: Oh, a new protocol launched yesterday. Okay, now we need to drop everything and try and integrate it. Can we integrate it? Probably not, because it's not open source and it doesn't have any idls anywhere? Okay, what do we do? We need to go and talk to the project. And, okay, they take two weeks to respond to us and oh, they have an API and it kind of sucks. And you know, it's very different. But if we don't do that, then people log into step and then they don't show the whole value of their portfolio. So it's kind of like we kind of have to, even if there's maybe no immediate benefit for us.
02:36:53.874 - 02:37:32.704, Speaker A: But I think a lot of us are sort of trying to push like, yeah, go ahead. It almost feels like all of us are kind of like duplicating the world. For example, when Token 2022 came out, there's all these new token standards and like go drop all that we're working on and try to like try to integrate and make sense of token 2022. Otherwise like you can't find this token on Solana FM step and gecko terminal. A good example of that is the nfts with Solana floor, right? So Solana floor has been giving floor price data for nfts. Actually people like, oh, there's a common NFT standard, metaplex. And not really, actually people kind of roll their own stuff all the time.
02:37:32.704 - 02:38:14.844, Speaker A: They just create new standards or it's not done correctly, or it's, there's some niche thing that means that we have to do some manual work to try and get it. So like I would love to live in a world where we can all not duplicate our efforts, but unfortunately, I think the reality is that we kind of have to at the moment. Maybe that will change over time, maybe like a few more years. There will just be one standard to rule more. But maybe that's also like open source development, right? Like Linux, there's a million, just different versions of distributions, right. I think a common theme here is that we're all about data aggregation, not specifically data creation, data aggregation. And we deal with the same problems that you face.
02:38:14.844 - 02:38:55.036, Speaker A: We have to integrate with all these protocols to get the first party sources, not relaying from economent index, because we need the verifiability still. Yeah. And integrate so many projects and solutions into your solution. Absolutely. And so how do you guys think about monetizing that as well? Because, okay, if we think of the web, two companies of the world, the Microsoft or something like that, okay, you're some big company, you have a logo and a stamp and a piece of paper and a contract and blah blah blah. And then you sign like an agreement for X many years to use their cloud software for whatever and pay them for data for us. I think we're all kind of like selling APIs or, I don't know, like putting buttons on websites to try and monetize things, maybe.
02:38:55.036 - 02:39:52.292, Speaker A: Nick, how are you thinking about monetization for an explorer? An explorer gets a lot of eyes, but perhaps it's maybe difficult to find the ways to. I guess all of us have the same challenges. It's like we show you the data and it's like, okay, cool, can you pay for it? Now? How do you do that? Yeah, so explorers are in a very difficult or weird situation or position in a sense where like, I think most users in general in Solana are using Solscan as a default explorer. And then Solana FM is a defect tool number two. So the thing that we have here is that we realized, like Soulscan just released ads pretty much recently and it always had ads that were like, you know, a bit sketchy, scammy, and it will redirect you outside of Solana and you go back to EVM or something like that. So that's something that we realized that we shouldn't do and number of partners around us would definitely support us. They've been telling us, like, don't do ads because like, if you do ads, then it will redirect users towards other chains.
02:39:52.292 - 02:40:18.000, Speaker A: It doesn't make sense. Yeah, so, but the problem, even though you might want to. Right, like, advertising actually brings in good money, especially if you have a website where a lot of people go to. Yeah. So we have at least a million site visits a month. And the problem with that is that it's going to be a huge source of revenue for us. But what we realized is that, like, the partners and other dapps, like, decentralized apps in Solana really need a lot of support for distribution.
02:40:18.000 - 02:41:08.034, Speaker A: I mean, even for us, we still have a lot of distribution streams to go before we hit like monopoly or duopoly in general. So what I'm more focused on is like, I still want to do ads and we still want to do ads in general, but we want to do it more collaboratively, something that's more like complimentary towards other projects in Solana. So you probably wouldn't expect to see ads so soon, but if you do see ads, it's going to be like soul flare, it's going to be step, it's going to be various sites and platforms in Solana so that the entire cycle goes like in a circular economy, I mean, something like that. And then really more importantly is that like explorers are just too traditional. It's very web tool focused. I can't say the same for Coingecko. I say Coingecko is more web3 than it is web two because it is pushing its limits towards like scaling towards many hundreds of chains and I mean million tokens.
02:41:08.034 - 02:41:29.006, Speaker A: Right? Oh my God. So Solana doesn't have that much? I hope not soon be. Does Solana have that much? Not yet, but soon. Actually very soon. Right. So that's the problem. So explorers are more web two than web3 because explorers generally pull data from RPC providers pull data from the chain and the data stays within our database.
02:41:29.006 - 02:42:18.520, Speaker A: It doesn't stay within the network. I mean you do have data on network like transactions and accounts, but that's it. The other data that you see that's quick is usually loaded and stored by our servers. And what we believe is that the next step is to go social is to go web3. So what we want to do in Explorer is maybe we could plug in together with Twitter, maybe we could share text, we could share labels, maybe you have a friend who loves following people on the chain and oh, this guy's a cool trader. I should tag him as a good trader, I should take this guy as a good trader, but you don't get to earn anything from that. And so what we thought of is like, yeah, we definitely should build a social explorer because an explorer already presents you with so much like data sets or data or pieces of information that's easy to consume.
02:42:18.520 - 02:43:32.732, Speaker A: You bundle it together with like social, you bundle it together with friends, man, it's gonna be crazy. So yeah, what we're looking forward to, onwards to monetization is definitely social. We're going social and yeah, we can't wait to show everyone what we're up with. Yeah, yeah, makes sense. We've got a few more minutes to go, but I guess for both Mitch and Bobbie, like how are you guys thinking about monetization? Maybe at switchboard, like as an oracle you mentioned the staleness and paying rent, but what going forward, how do you monetize? Yeah, so I mean with the traditional push oracle we have to charge a lease or a rent for each of these data feeds for the oracles to support it because the oracles actually have to incur the gas costs and the priority fees to make sure the data is fresh. With the variability of gas costs it actually doesn't come out to too much of a profit for the operators as it is today. And that's why the on demand model, which also brings zero staleness, the freshest prices possible is a lot more conducive to other people running these oracles because then the oracles don't submit the transaction and it's actually the user who wants to commit their action submitting the prices in their transaction which is signed by the oracles.
02:43:32.732 - 02:44:21.492, Speaker A: So in that way it's not two separate entities that have to worry about the gas cost. It's much more efficient gas wise and for the chain, and it makes it much more reasonable for charging for these long tail data feeds. Only need to pay for it right when you need it. So it really makes sense when you have a borrow lend pool, you only need it when a user interacts with it. Why charge when there's nobody touching the pool? You don't need to know the cost of the collateral. Does it make sense? On demand is really a very special way to build a data flow. When you only need something, let's say you have a very long tail pool, people only interact with it once every 30 minutes or an hour, don't need to update that every 5 seconds, only charge the protocol or actually incur the cost to the people bringing the data on to update the feed.
02:44:21.492 - 02:45:02.454, Speaker A: And in that way the protocol never actually has to pay for the data feed in the first place because the user actually just pays the gas cost for the oracle when they interact with it. Yeah, yeah, so I think it's just a more efficient use of resources and maybe that more efficient use of resources will potentially bring on more customers as well. That would look to do it I guess as well. So Bobby's sort of rounding us out like monetization at Coingecko. I mean you guys are kind of in a position where because you're across all chains you're not like running an oracle or a specific chain or doing something there. So you maybe have a little bit more freedom there. But everyone kind of relies on the coingecko data for, okay, what's the price of bitcoin today? Maybe it's trading firms or something like that.
02:45:02.454 - 02:45:53.214, Speaker A: Yes, I mean for is advertising is a big driver of revenue. A lot of people have negative perception of advertising, but the reality is in the tech industry advertising is a big driver. I mean the biggest big tech firms like Google, Facebook, even Amazon these days rely a lot of advertising to drive. In fact Google and Facebook is like 90% of their revenue come from advertising. So it's a tried and tested web two business model that is proven is the only thing is this non recurring revenue? But we started doing more recurring revenue like the data sales, for example, the API. And I think yesterday during dinner, I think we were having some discussion on what other sources of revenue could come in, and we're discussing should, for example, we run a Solana validator, for example. All of us are thinking this as well, like, maybe this is a good idea.
02:45:53.214 - 02:46:28.720, Speaker A: All individual projects run a validator. Yeah, I think validators are interesting, especially like, consumer facing applications that have large user base. There could be an opportunity to be, to run a validator that is a relatively high ranking and that could be a relatively good revenue driver. So that's something that we're thinking about, I think, getting the transaction flow. And I think, like couple of yesterday when, when Seong from Jupyter was on stage, I didn't talk about how some of their partners here actually drive a lot of revenue from the API. So that I think could be interesting moving to the transaction flow as well. Yeah, yeah.
02:46:28.720 - 02:47:00.214, Speaker A: No, I really like the sort of stake to access idea. It's kind of like everyone can have an LST and you can stake that, maybe get access, or that's how you pay for it. But yeah, we're at time now, so I'll let everyone go and get some lunch for vip. It's in the room, was it downstairs, actually, but otherwise all around the Hilton, there's lots of good food places. But thank you so much for joining us, panellists, and, yeah, we'll meet back in after the break, so talk to you all soon. Thank you very much. Thank you.
02:47:00.214 - 02:47:36.460, Speaker A: Thanks a lot for this insightful talk. So we wrap up the first half of the day, and it's lunch break now. And after lunch break, Ansem is gonna be with us. That's very important. Just to let you know. 01:30 p.m. we'll be back here and we will have other fireside chats and live talks.
02:47:36.460 - 03:34:13.916, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Hello, everyone. Good afternoon. I hope you enjoyed your lunch and ready for a very exciting second half. And so let's get the ball rolling with our first live talk presented by Drew Nutter, a senior protocol engineer at Syndica, and he's one of the leading cloud infrastructure firms on Solana. And Brennan Gabotis, who is the chief protocol engineer at Syndica. Let's give them a bold, warm and big round of applause.
03:34:13.916 - 03:34:53.144, Speaker A: Thank you. Hello. So, my name is Brennan. I'm the chief protocol engineer at Syndica, and today we're going to be giving a talk about building SiG a read optimized validator client. So who are we? We're Syndica or web. Three, native Cloud. We specialize in RPC infrastructure as well as developer tooling for the Solana ecosystem.
03:34:53.144 - 03:35:41.634, Speaker A: So in our v two, we have things coming up like elastic nodes at scale, depending on your RPC requirements, as well as change stream API, where you can actually stream accounts and transactions to directly from the validator. And we also have app deployments where you can deploy your front end application on our platform and have everything all in one place. So with all these features, we've had to run a lot of the RPC nodes ourselves, and we noticed a problem. The problem was that 96% of calls made to nodes are reads. But Solana is currently plagued by Slotlack. And so more specifically, we found that RPC validators were falling behind the head of the node. So we have two charts here.
03:35:41.634 - 03:36:33.534, Speaker A: One shows the slot lag on Ethereum, and one shows the slot lag on Solana. And so we measured across nine different providers over a 90 day period. And you can kind of see the darker the color, the more that these validators are lagging behind the head of the network. And so you can see in Ethereum, there's not much color. Slot lag really isn't a problem, but in Solana, there's a lot of color, and slot lag is an enormous problem. And so we dove in to the data to figure out what was causing this slot lag, and we found that there were specific RPC methods that were the culprits. So we have another figure where on the x axis, we have the frequency of these methods being called, and on the y axis, we have the maximum reads per second that these methods can achieve.
03:36:33.534 - 03:37:14.158, Speaker A: And so you can see there are specific methods that are both low in the reads per second that they can achieve, as well as high in the frequency of them being called. So these are the methods that we really want to fix, and these are the problems. So that's why we're building Sig. We're building Sig in the open source for the whole community to learn from. We're releasing blog posts, videos, explainers, everything to make it easy to basically run these validator clients yourselves. And so to go over the goals of why we're building spic. More specifically, one of them is reads per second.
03:37:14.158 - 03:37:55.076, Speaker A: So this is fixing the slot lag problem that we were talking about before and just optimizing it for reads. We also want to improve the client diversity, so introducing another client onto the Solana ecosystem should improve the fault tolerance of the network. And also protocol accessibility. So we want more core contributors to come and contribute to the core base. And so we're releasing blog posts, documentation, making the code very readable to make it more accessible. I now pass it over to drew to talk about why we chose Zig as the programming language. Hey everyone, my name is Drew.
03:37:55.076 - 03:38:31.328, Speaker A: I'm a senior protocol engineer at Syndica, and yeah, I'm going to tell you about why we chose to implement the SiG validator in the Zig programming language. So the two main reasons are performance and readability to accomplish the goals that Brennan just laid out. So Solana needs to process a lot of data. It's read and write intensive, and as Brendan pointed out, RPC nodes are struggling to keep up. So we need a solution to improve the performance. So Zig is a great tool for performance optimization. That's why we chose it.
03:38:31.328 - 03:39:23.236, Speaker A: In order to optimize performance, you need to be able to manually control the way that memory is managed. And basically what that means is that anytime a computer program needs to process large amounts of data, it needs to make a request to the operating system to ask for an allocation of memory. And if this is not managed correctly, it can lead to significant slowdowns in the program. So the problem with almost every programming language is that it does implicit memory allocations behind the scenes, and the programmer doesn't really have a lot of control over this. With Zig, there are no hidden memory allocations. That gives a programmer the ability to directly customize all of this behavior, which gives unparalleled control over memory and performance in Zig. Another great advantage of Zig is its C interoperability.
03:39:23.236 - 03:40:09.994, Speaker A: So Zig itself is a C compiler, and it makes it extremely easy to run C code from within a zig program, as you can see in the code example here. And another great thing about Zig is the SIMD support with the built in vector type, which allows us to take advantage of a lot of cpu performance optimization features. So another reason why we are using Zig is because it is very readable. So readability is a huge goal for us. And if you look at like the Solana rust code base, it is very complex and can be difficult to understand. So our goal with SIG is to have it be easy to understand, so it's easy for people to contribute. And with more contributors, we can build more high quality software.
03:40:09.994 - 03:40:49.132, Speaker A: So zig is simple, it's transparent, and it's easy to learn. It has simple syntax, which means you can express powerful abstractions with, with ordinary zig code and it's transparent, so there's no hidden control flow. What that means is that if there's any kind of like resource cleanup or memory allocations that's explicitly laid out in the code, and you don't have to dig through layers and layers of code, it's all right in front of you to understand. So because of this, it's easy to learn and it's easy for newcomers to contribute. So I'll pass it back to Brennan. Yeah. So what's the progress on the SIG project? So we completed gossip.
03:40:49.132 - 03:41:14.364, Speaker A: This is all about peer to peer communication as the entry point into the network. We basically finished accountsdb. This is all about representing the state of the network and the actual accounts. We're currently working on the repair stage. This is all about fetching blocks from the current state and catching up to the network. We're also working on the SVM. This is virtual machine, all about processing transactions and getting to the next state.
03:41:14.364 - 03:41:52.638, Speaker A: In the future, we're planning to work on consensus tower BFT. It's all about processing votes and forks, et cetera. We're going to be working on the RPC, which is all reading the data that we just stored. And then it moves more into the leader production block, production block propagation. And those are the things we're going to be working on now. We'll be moving more into some technical details of some interesting things, things that we came across while building Sig. So specifically with accountsDB to give some background, there's these things called snapshots.
03:41:52.638 - 03:42:34.234, Speaker A: It basically represents the entire network in a single slot. And there's two main components in these snapshots. One is the metadata, which contains useful information built to snapshot. But also there's account files, and these actually store the bytes of the accounts that live on chain. And so one of the important things is that when you're starting up a validator, you need to build a map, a map from a certain public key or an address to where the actual account lives in these account files. And so you can think of it like a hashmap. You basically have a pub key and you map it to where the file is and where that account lives within that file or the offset.
03:42:34.234 - 03:43:12.680, Speaker A: And so while we're building this account index, there's a couple interesting things or problems that we came across. One of them is with fast reads and fast writes. So when we're initially starting up the validator, we want to be able to generate this index extremely fast to catch up to the rest of the network. And we found that the standard library hash map just wasn't fast enough. So we had to implement our own hash map from the ground up in zigzag and base it off Google swiss map. And so there's a couple interesting features that we came across. Pac structs is one of them, where it gives you a transparent understanding of the memory underneath the struct.
03:43:12.680 - 03:43:42.826, Speaker A: We use SIMD operations for fast equality indexing. It feels like native Zig you can see in the code. And we got two x faster writes versus standard library, which was a massive accomplishment. We also. Another problem that we came across was that when you're generating this index, because there's so many accounts on Solana, the validator was actually running out of RAM and was not able to start. So we had to figure out a solution to this. The solution was to move the index onto disk memory.
03:43:42.826 - 03:44:11.498, Speaker A: And so Zig made this really easy to do because it has an allocator interface. And so all we had to do was create a new disk based allocator that implemented this interface, give it to the structure, and everything worked just as expected. And so there was no code changes. We got a massive improvement really easily. So now I'll pass it to drew to talk a little bit about repair stage. Thanks, Brennan. So, the next thing that we're working on is repair.
03:44:11.498 - 03:45:14.954, Speaker A: So what is repair, and why are we working on that now? So, basically, we've loaded every account from the snapshot into accountsDB, and it works great. But the only issue is that the snapshot represents a moment in time, which is in the past, and a validator needs to know the current state at every point in time. So, in order to do that, you need to process every block that has occurred since the snapshot was produced. And the repair service is in charge of ensuring that we receive all of those blocks. So I'll take a second just to introduce turbine. So, turbine is the mechanism that validators use to share the latest blocks with each other. The basic idea is that you have one validator is considered the leader, and that leader creates a block, and a block is basically just a big chunk of data, and then it breaks that chunk of data up into smaller pieces called shreds, and it distributes those shreds out to some of the highest stake nodes, and then those nodes send it out to other nodes, and so on until every validator has received every shred.
03:45:14.954 - 03:46:03.674, Speaker A: One thing to note about turbine is that it's only doing this with recent blocks that were just generated, not just all blocks through history at all times. And there's also the possibility that some nodes might not receive every single shred due to network issues. So on this slide, we have a diagram that represents three blocks for three slots, and you'll see that the first one is complete. That's what all the green means, whereas the next two have some shreds that have not been received. So repair is the service that goes through the block. Store constantly looks at all the blocks, and it understands which shreds are missing, and then it sends out the requests to other validators to send over those shreds. And so this is critical for after we receive the snapshot and there's many, many slots for which we don't have any, any shreds from the block at all.
03:46:03.674 - 03:47:06.674, Speaker A: So when nodes respond, we can process those shreds, rebuild the blocks, and update accounts DB with the latest state. So now I can go into a little bit of details about the architecture of receiving and repairing shreds. So I'm going to be using terminology that we've been using in the SiG validator, but you can also see some of the agave terminology there written in gray. So this basically represents single validator, but you also see to the left, there's an orange box that represents upstream validators that are sending us shreds. So the section highlighted in blue represents the shred collector, which is the portion of the validator that is collecting and managing the incoming shreds. So the shred collector is then broken up into four components. The first component that receives the shreds is the shred receiver, and that will one is responsible for listening to data from the network, doing some basic checks on that data to make sure that they're well formed shreds, and also communicating with other validators to let them know that we're alive and able to receive data.
03:47:06.674 - 03:48:05.864, Speaker A: Then the shred verifier takes over, and it verifies the signature on those threads in order to make sure that it was actually the leader who created those shreds and not some malicious actor. After that, the shred processor takes over and it loads those shreds into the block store, and it also submits it to the retransmit stage to get sent to other validators over turbine. So while all this is going on, the repair service is constantly monitoring the block store and identifying which threads are missing, and then it sends requests to the upstream validators. And then when those validators respond, it all follows that same path that I just described. So you might be wondering, does this work? Can I run this right now? And the answer is yes, you can run Sig from our GitHub repo, and it'll run our initial implementation of the shred collector by default. It'll just automatically run it. So you just run the SiG validator command, and you just need to pass an entry point to indicate which cluster you want to connect to.
03:48:05.864 - 03:48:40.744, Speaker A: Devnet, Mainnet, whatever. And there's also an option where you can specify a slot number. This is just a type temporary option where you can say, I want to repair from a certain slot, and it's going to prove that it can repair from any point in time. So when you look at the logs, you're going to see the initial thing is catching up. It's going to be processing like massive numbers of slots, and then after it catches up, it's going to be log messages indicating that it's processing about two slots every second. So that's it for repair. We're going to continue improving the shred collector as we implement the block store, which is our next step.
03:48:40.744 - 03:49:21.584, Speaker A: And so, yeah, everything is being developed in open source on GitHub, where you can track our progress and you can contribute to our project, where we're very open to contributors. And we're also very excited to share all of our progress with you guys. So, you know, through talks like this, as well as through blog posts. So we have a blog on the Syndica website where we have these deep dive blog posts that describe everything that we've learned, learned about the inner workings of Solana, as well as updates on our progress. So our goal with the SIG project is really to advance the ecosystem as a whole and to solve some really big problems. And the best way to do that is as a community. So we really hope that you guys will join us.
03:49:21.584 - 03:50:57.774, Speaker A: So I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the conference, and thank you so much for your time, gentlemen. Now our next panel will be talking about spotting the next trends on Solana, and we'll be featuring, I think you're waiting for him once again on the stage, Ansem and George Harrop, and everybody knows him, but I want to again make an introduction for him. He's a well known trader within the crypto community for several cycles, and has most recently been in the spotlight for his loud public conviction in Solana throughout the 2022 and 2022 bear market. And he's also been ahead on most of this cycle's narratives, and most notably on meme coins such as Dog Biff Hat and let's welcome Ansem and George Harrop, and they will share their insights and strategies for identifying emerging trends within the Solana ecosystem. And they will delve into the tools and techniques used to stay ahead of the curve in the face paced world of Solana. Please, let's have a big, warm round of applause and please welcome. Thank you.
03:50:57.774 - 03:51:18.862, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. We're back. Hope everyone had a good lunch. GM Ansem, let's. Let's get into it. All right, well, you did a friendly chat yesterday, Ansem, so we're gonna have another friendly chat today.
03:51:18.862 - 03:51:49.704, Speaker A: It's gonna be great. We're talking about trending things, trending on Twitter, on tokens, hashtag drop the ticker. We're not gonna be doing that, don't worry. But no, we're gonna be talking about how to identify maybe as part of, like, a trading strategy or something along those lines for people out there that are getting into crypto. And really crypto, I mean, it's a lot of buying and selling coins. Right? So we're going to talk about, like, just trending things in general, maybe social media and all that sort of stuff. But maybe as a.
03:51:49.704 - 03:52:37.176, Speaker A: I think everyone kind of realizes that you're tweeting a lot. And how do you identify, like, what are the trending things at the moment, narratives that are maybe getting into them before they're a thing? Like, how do you sort of look at that and go, yeah, that's going to be a thing, or, no, that's not going to be a thing. Yeah. I have a few different ways. I think my starting point usually is I have a list, essentially, of all the different market segments in crypto. So high level, there's like, l one s, which is stuff like Ethereum, Solana, l two s, roll ups. Then there's defi, like, real world assets, DPN, all these different market segments, essentially.
03:52:37.176 - 03:53:06.866, Speaker A: And I have a list of different coins that are in all these different segments. And I do research on those, like, starting from there, fundamentally. But how I find trades, the best trades that I take usually are the ones where a coin is, like, high on my, like, fundamentals. Like, I guess, research. What is that? Like, what is something that would rank highly on fundamentals? Because I guess a lot of us are like, well, this has fundamentals. And that also says that it has fundamentals. Right? Like, what.
03:53:06.866 - 03:53:44.548, Speaker A: What actually is that? It's definitely very subjective, depending on how, like, how you come to the conclusion on your own. But for me, like, Solana was. Was a really good trade last year. Part of the reason for it was like, it's more performant than ETH, it's cheaper than ETH doing transactions. So there's just a lot more apps that could build on Solana that you can't build on ETH. And I, like, stayed up to date with all the technological advancements that got passed in 2022, that when Solana had issues with congestion, they fixed a lot of those. But on the flip side of it, it's like, if your fundamentals are solid and high and the attention is low, like, the public perception is low.
03:53:44.548 - 03:54:07.222, Speaker A: So, like Solana last year, nobody was really bullish on Solana. So there was a. It was disjointed between those two things. And those are always the best traits. Like, when people aren't paying attention to this, but the fundamentals are solid, and it's the same way in crypto, like spotting rotations early before they happen. It's the same type of thing. Right now, memes are, front of everybody's mind, super high on attention.
03:54:07.222 - 03:54:39.744, Speaker A: But before bonk happened, nobody really was talking about meme coins. It was Pepe. And maybe people thought about doge last cycle, but nobody was really thinking like, yeah, memes are going to be a big thing this cycle. But for me, when Solana popped off, whenever an l one does really well and on chain activity starts to go up, what people do is they're going to look for beta to the l one coin. And I was like, well, bonk is one of the biggest altcoins on Solana, so people are obviously going to look at that first. And that's how I had the idea. I think memes are going to pop off, especially since you have a reference point.
03:54:39.744 - 03:55:01.764, Speaker A: Last cycle of doge, doing really well. Shib, doing really well. Floki, doing really well. So that's generally, I would say, yeah, it's like trading attention, I think, is kind of what people call it, but you also need the fundamental research to back that. Yeah, right. And you mentioned before about looking at the tech, and so certainly during the bear market, there were changes in the tech that were being made. But how do you discern of what's a.
03:55:01.764 - 03:55:27.666, Speaker A: What's a change in the tech that is actually gonna result in number go up versus not? Because, okay, we got, like, a blockchains out there, right? Yep. We've got a lot of devs talking about ZK rollups and a billion l two s. And, yeah, hey, this tech is really cool, but just having cool tech doesn't make something actually pop. Off. So, like, how do you. Is there a way to sort of. Sort of, I don't know, do you look at something and go, yeah, actually, I'd use that? Yeah.
03:55:27.666 - 03:55:44.702, Speaker A: Yeah. I would say it's two main things. I'll say. The first is being an active user of all these protocols. So I use basically every new app that comes out in crypto. I'm probably one of the first persons to use it, whether that's on Solana or some other chain. And I also bridge my funds across different l one.
03:55:44.702 - 03:56:36.094, Speaker A: So I have that as my starting point, like, my actual user experience with the chain, with all these different protocols. So I know firsthand whether this is actually solid or whether this is, like, people are just talking about it and saying that it's solid. So that's the first thing. And then the second thing is, yeah, like you said, you can have really good tech, but if you don't have attention, distribution, marketing, on the other side of it, nobody's really going to know about it. So that has to be factored into your trades, because if nobody even knows that this exists, it's not going to be a thing, not going to blow up. And with Solana, for me, I just knew the Solana community really well, just from being active, going to events like these, going to breakpoint, talking to founders, talking to traders, and I just knew there was a strong community around Solana. So whenever things turn as they do in bull markets, I was, like, expecting attention to flow back pretty easily.
03:56:36.094 - 03:57:04.378, Speaker A: And it's the same way with altcoins in different market segments. Artificial intelligence is another good one. So there's a ton of attention on AI right now external to crypto. So if there's any projects that do come out, like, crypto specific protocols, you can bet pretty easily, like, if they're solid, then people are going to turn their attention there. Yeah. And I guess the question is, can. If it's about attention, memes certainly get the attention.
03:57:04.378 - 03:57:40.692, Speaker A: Right? Because, okay, it's a funny, it's a picture with a dog and a hat, but can they sustain? And maybe, you know, the argument would be, oh, a project with real fundamentals can sustain longer because they have real stuff going on, versus a meme that, I mean, cool. Like, look at gifs from, like, ten years ago that were memes. They're kind of cringe at the moment, right? Yeah. Like, it's not really going to be a long term thing. And then the bet is, okay, how long term is it? So is it a case of. And then you get a proliferation of these memes because everyone's like, wow, okay, a dog with a hat. How about, like, a kangaroo with a hat? And then you get just, like, you know, a million of these things, and then it kind of reduces in value.
03:57:40.692 - 03:58:17.682, Speaker A: Right. So is it like a. I don't know, is it, does it kind of just destroy itself or come back again and sort of flip back in the next cycle? Yeah, I mean, I would definitely say that memes are the riskiest all coins in crypto, for sure. Like, a lot of them do go to zero, especially ones that start super low. It's, like, hard for one hundred k, two hundred k markup coins to sustain, like, buying and selling from people. But I will say that I think dogecoin is an example of a meme that sustained itself over multiple cycles. So if you look at the top, like, 50 all coins back in 2013 or 2015, most of those coins are not there anymore.
03:58:17.682 - 03:58:43.702, Speaker A: But dogecoin comes back every single cycle, and that's because of the. It's like a provenance thing, almost like it's very native to crypto. Like, the same way people think about bitcoin, they think about dogecoin in the same way. It's been around for a long time. So there are some memes that kind of reach escape velocity where it's like they're just so well known, the people always come back to them. And I think there's going to be some of those this cycle as well. But, yeah, for the most part, it's hard for all memes to just stay around.
03:58:43.702 - 03:59:06.036, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And, well, over the last seven months, really, Solana has been the place for all sorts of different trading. Right. Not just memes, but all sorts of stuff. And now, I think volumes, usually on the day, it's usually higher 24 hours volume on Solana than Ethereum. Even with a TBL, that's way less. What do you think the reason is for that? I mean, some people are like, oh, it's the Ux, and, like, the wallets are really easy to use.
03:59:06.036 - 03:59:50.482, Speaker A: I mean, is it as simple as, hey, there's some devs out there which made a really cool, like, slick dashboard? Or is it like, fundamentally, I guess, yeah, the fees thing, where people talk about fees, but Ethereum, people will say, oh, but if we're all getting rich, it's okay to pay $200 for a transfer as long as I can make $400 on a thing. And do you think that that actually holds white or. I think it's. It's a. I would say the reason that Solana has done so well recently with the trading volume comparable to ETH is because it's. It's great for new people to crypto. So if you don't have any crypto, then you're not going to be wanting to pay $10, $20 a swap, $50 a swap when stuff is popping off like it does on ETH, but on Solana, you don't have that issue.
03:59:50.482 - 04:00:34.042, Speaker A: So people who literally can get sent dollar ten to a or phantom or backpack wallet, they can immediately trade whatever with no kind of no restriction. I think it does. The argument that people are willing to pay high fees to trade if they think it's good, like risk reward, is definitely valid, but that only. It's only valid for people who already have a ton of money in crypto. And the reason that works like that argument has worked so well the past few years is because that was basically who everybody was talking to. It was people who had been in Ethereum since 2014 or 2017 and had a super low cost basis. So they didn't care about paying $100, $200, like a swap or whatever, for their fees over a month because they're trying to make, what, like six figures on a trade.
04:00:34.042 - 04:00:55.638, Speaker A: Not everybody's trying to do that. I think it's a different setup with Solana. Yeah. And, okay. A lot of these new projects, the way that they launch is also quite different. Like, it used to be back in the day that you would launch on a centralized exchange, and then, hey, when Dexs came along, it's like, cool. That token now exists on a Dex and then some people.
04:00:55.638 - 04:01:19.464, Speaker A: Now it's the airdrop meta as well. Right? So, okay, an airdrop is how coins get into circulation. I think other times, like, we've got the meteoro, like DLMM pools and stuff like that, that. Okay, you can, like, buy it from there, or radium. A lot of these things were radium pools. So. So the way that a token launches, is that actually that relevant, do you think? Or it's kind of just still goes back to the attention? I think it's definitely relevant.
04:01:19.464 - 04:02:16.600, Speaker A: A lot of the discussion people have had this cycle is, like, around high FTV coins, meaning high fully diluted value versus the circulating market cap is much lower. And that happens when you have only a small amount of the total tokens in circulation that people can trade. And then VC's or some other team or some other entity have a lot more tokens, but they're just locked up for a certain amount of time. So the FDV the project can be like five x, ten x more than the circulating market cap. And for retail, it's like, well, we didn't get the price that everybody else got. They have way more tokens than us, so why would I want to buy this coin? And I think the community distribution aspect in crypto is huge because crypto is, like, focused on that being, like, more community oriented, just in general. And the reason that a lot of people like meme coins is because you have the devs, obviously, who are launching the coins, but a lot of the time, the supply is just immediately 100% circulating to the community.
04:02:16.600 - 04:02:57.540, Speaker A: So it's like everybody got basically the same fair shot if you saw the coin when it launched or if you saw it trading at whatever low market cap. That's why a lot of people like memes. But I'll say it's definitely important. Like, teams that do their airdrop really, like, well in early stages, they build their community super, super strong. And what is a good airdrop? Because I guess a good airdrop is when number goes up and then no one's mad. But if number doesn't go up and everyone gets mad, and it's like, bro, actually, no one guaranteed you a number, right? But, like, what is. And also, maybe, would you agree that an airdrop is like a one shot thing? Like, you don't get a second airdrop and often, or if you do, people just insta dump it.
04:02:57.540 - 04:03:59.894, Speaker A: Do you think, like, an airdrop is a valid mechanism to launching, but perhaps only with the parameters, like you said, of like 100% circulating supply or something like that? I think airdrops are definitely valid, and I think our team should definitely continue to use them. The issue with airdrops currently is kind of fixing the Sibyl problem, which is like when one person will make 1000 wallets, use the protocol before Ford has a token, and then they'll get the airdrop from 1000 different wallets. The way that you fix that is by making the airdrop more linear. So it's like, if I had $100 in 100 different wallets versus having $10,000 in one wallet, that those 100 watts versus that one wallet would get the same portion of the airdrop. So there's been a lot of teams kind of focusing more on making their airdrops more linear. It kind of evens the field that people with small amounts of capital get basically the same as people with large amounts of capital, which is why there's kind of a mix that teams do. I think GTO did a really good job of kind of focusing on their early users because their points program was short.
04:03:59.894 - 04:04:32.836, Speaker A: So it was like if you had been in Jito using the protocol for a while, you kind of were already there. And there wasn't really that situation where a ton of people are trying to sil it because it was just literally core users of Solana and GTO. So they did really well with that. But it is hard to do. I don't think 100% is really reasonable, honestly, because a lot of these teams do have VC funding and the VC's obviously have to get paid for funding these teams. But in some cases it can happen. Like Fintech, which is an app on base like the l two, they did 100% airdrop to all their users.
04:04:32.836 - 04:05:01.976, Speaker A: But the reason they were able to do that is because they make a ton in fees off the app. So VC's were getting paid from that, the team was getting paid from that. They didn't really care about the token because they're already making money in other ways. So there's definitely like a scale, but I think like 10% plus is usually good for airdrop. Yeah, right. And I guess what we're talking about there as well, like raising money and that sort of thing. I think you mentioned, was it yesterday that you're doing more angel investing now or potentially looking at it? What are sort of the things that.
04:05:01.976 - 04:05:27.584, Speaker A: That you're looking for or sort of interesting deals, interesting sectors. Like if someone's out there, they're building a really cool app. It's the best thing in the world. You want to go and talk to Ansim, what are you actually looking for and how should people approach that? That's a good question. A few different things. I think the areas that are most interesting to me right now, first one is consumer. So I think consumer focused applications and crypto is kind of a wide description.
04:05:27.584 - 04:05:59.672, Speaker A: It can be literally anything. But I'm looking for apps that are doing new things that don't currently exist in the crypto ecosystem. So not like replicas of things that currently exist. I think honestly, a lot of the DeFi protocols, we kind of have the base layer of what we need on most l one s. And then I would say that the second thing is probably like AI. I don't know exactly what that's going to look like yet, but I know the intersection of AI and crypto is going to be big this cycle and obviously next cycle. Yeah, right.
04:05:59.672 - 04:06:29.108, Speaker A: And I guess building on that, the fat protocol thesis has been one thing where people say the infrastructure has got a lot of the valuations the last four or five years, everyone's funding all of these l two s. Exactly. And then people are like, okay, what about the apps built on top of them? Like, isn't it the case that, okay, Amazon is. They sell servers and that sort of thing, but they also, you know, they built their trillion dollar company off having an amazing shipping company. Like, you could maybe view that as an app. Same. Maybe Facebook is a better example.
04:06:29.108 - 04:06:51.048, Speaker A: Right? It's an app that runs on the Internet. So do you subscribe to this fat protocol thesis where the apps should actually accrue more value than the underlying l two s, or. Yeah, I do. I think the pendulum is swinging more in that direction if we're, if we're like, fat protocol versus. What's the other one? Fat. It's like a. I don't know, the infrastructure, all of the value that same as all of the apps combined.
04:06:51.048 - 04:07:36.364, Speaker A: I forget what it's called. But if, like, if infra is here and apps are here, we're like way over here, maybe swinging back this way a little bit. Because a lot of the infra is just super easy to get funded, has been super easy to get funded the past few years. It's like, oh, I know if I do a l two round at whatever, 50 mil, I know I'm immediately going to get a markup at 500 mil or a bill or whatever. And a lot of these VC's who have been funding these protocols have like, been investing with that mindset, especially since Solana did really well last cycle. A lot of l one s came out at super high valuations this cycle, like multi billion immediately off the gate. But the thing is, if you don't have any applications on these l one s, why are they commanding a two, $3 billion valuation? And I think a lot of people are starting to think that way now, which is why I.
04:07:36.364 - 04:08:25.268, Speaker A: You're going to see a lot more focus on the application layer. It's just those are much harder to fund and support because it's a lot harder for applications, I think, to be successful than it is for l one to sell dreams of. We're going to be the greatest infra ever. Yeah. And how do you value that? Because I guess in the DeFi world, one way to value things is TVL, right? And then there's a question of, is TVL a meme? And another one is maybe users, right, or number of transactions or something like that. But then you'll have a bunch of bots that will just like, do a billion transactions go, hey, we have a billion users. You probably don't, but how do you value these apps that come on chain? Like, what would be a good one versus a bad one? Does it come back to attention or some form of utility in some way? Like you mentioned friendtech, that was kind of a new thing.
04:08:25.268 - 04:08:40.428, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. How do you value these apps? That's a great question. Trying to figure that out now. I'm doing the investing. I know how to do trade. Does anyone know? Put your head up in the audience, right? Yeah, I would say a lot of it is retention. Bit focused.
04:08:40.428 - 04:09:37.324, Speaker A: I think one of the good applications on salon is drip, which is really cool. Essentially, it's a like, marketplace where there's a ton of different artists. They release their content or their art, and if you subscribe, subscribe to these artists, you get airdrop or dripped their art to your wallet. So it's kind of similar, not that similar to Opensea, like some other NFT marketplaces, but they've done a really good job of onboarding net new people onto Solana, and they like, track all of their metrics where it's like, okay, this wallet started with zero. We gave them a little bit of whatever, then they started using drip, and after they started using drip, they started using other applications in crypto. I think that that's really powerful if you have something that doesn't cost a lot for users to interact with, and then it also gets them involved with a lot of different other areas in the crypto space. I guess the question is, like, we all have Solana wallets, I think, out there, and we get like a million spam nfts.
04:09:37.324 - 04:10:41.432, Speaker A: So then you open the can of worms of, okay, if we have projects that are say, airdropping or releasing nfts or doing whatever, how do we know a real one from a fake one? Like, we have? AI's generating crazy stuff and images and stuff now. So do you think that problem gets worse over time of maybe trying to sift through the thousands of things which come out and try and find the actual winners amongst all of the sort of trash? Yeah, I mean, I get sent stuff all the time and people don't even really know which wallets are mine. I think it's going to be on the protocols on Solana to kind of vet which tokens are solid, which entities are solid. And I think Jupiter does this really well. They have a list of tokens that they kind of approve, like they're approved list of tokens where it's like, if you enter some other random contract address, they literally will tell you, we have not approved this token. Yes, it's tradable in Solana, but it's not like in our official list of tokens. I think that that's pretty common.
04:10:41.432 - 04:11:10.244, Speaker A: Teams like Jupiter and other teams do that where it's like, you know, if you're buying something that's extremely risky, they will tell you. Yeah, yeah. And coming back to some of the platforms as well, we've mentioned a few already, but what are some of the platforms that you're using every day? Or, like, why do you use them? And does that help in discovery of new stuff? It could be Twitter. It doesn't have to be crypto. Crypto stuff or Dexs or whatever it might be. Yeah. I mean, the most frequently used is Jupiter.
04:11:10.244 - 04:11:47.308, Speaker A: For me, I do a lot of Dex on chain trading margin for, I use for like, lending and borrowing. What else? Uniswap two on ETH, ton of different protocols. Honestly, I'm not as big on the NFT side of things. Why is that? I'm not good at trading nfts, at trading tokens. But no, I've never been good at trading entities, always. See, like, I remember last cycle, people were super big on nfts. People told me to buy punks at like ten k, was like, why would anybody ever buy that worth $10,000, never doing that.
04:11:47.308 - 04:12:09.138, Speaker A: And then they went to like, millions. I'm like, okay, well, I clearly don't know what I'm doing here. Yeah, I don't. I don't get nfts. I mean, that's a good point. Like maybe meme coins and nfts, at least. At least in my opinion, don't they kind of overlap some way where it's like a dog with a hat, like, it's a funny community, it's a funny, like, picture, right? And people can make all sorts of other content based on that, but that's kind of also nfts.
04:12:09.138 - 04:12:40.958, Speaker A: I guess nfts just don't have the liquidity or, you know, it's an auction sort of style to get. To get rid of them. Right. So number go up or number go down kind of depends on, hey, I could list my NFT and, like, no one buys it, whereas at least with a token, I can press the sell button and there's always a bid. So, I mean, do you think they're similar, the memes and NFT sort of side of things? I do. I do think they're similar. I've actually kind of talked about this a few times, I think memes have the aspect where if you have a super strong community and anybody can meme the token.
04:12:40.958 - 04:13:09.970, Speaker A: So stuff like, with stuff like Michi, where it's like, anybody can edit the dog with a hat, put a different hat on it, or like, put a hat on somebody else. Super easy for anybody, the meme. So it's like you have all these profiles on Twitter that are literally pfps, but it's not an NFT collection, it's just the meme edited with whatever people want on it. So in that way, you have that community aspect. But the thing is, with meme coins, you can have way, way, way bigger communities. NFTs are usually limits, like ten k or like 20k, whatever it is. And they're also a lot more liquid.
04:13:09.970 - 04:13:35.652, Speaker A: So it's like, I do think in the future you're going to kind of see an intersection there where it's like memes will have their own official NFT collection, and then the NFT collections will have some kind of like fractionalized form of the NFT where you can trade it more, like easier. Because, I mean, I hate being illiquid, honestly. It's one of the reasons I don't like nfts. It's kind of making non fungible tokens. Fungible again. It's actually funny. Yeah.
04:13:35.652 - 04:14:32.336, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, we've got a few moments left here. I think some people in the audience, in fact, I think we spoke about this yesterday when you were talking about, like, your social media account journey and stuff as well, where you grew from one hundred k to four hundred k followers, and there's probably quite a few people in the audience as well that are like, hey, I want to grow my social presence. What are some of the strategies to do that? Or what are some of the strategies not to do? I guess we see a lot of people just making a factual statement as the post like this Dex did a billion dollars and then expecting everyone to like and retweet it. But you obviously, you provide sort of original ideas with your posts as well. So do you think there's like a middle ground between maybe, like, how do you go about growing an account? Is it like when we say, providing value to your community? What does that mean? I wish I knew. Honestly, I never started my Twitter with the intention of growing it to a lot of.
04:14:32.336 - 04:15:08.736, Speaker A: So people ask me a lot, like, how do I grow my Twitter? And I honestly don't really know that well because I didn't really plan to do it. I would say that what people have told me that they, like a lot about my account, though, is I'm pretty genuine and transparent with everything that I share. It's like, whether I share an idea that's right, whether I share an idea that's wrong, I, like, share my thought process behind why I thought I was wrong, why I thought it was right. And you can go back and fact check anything that I posted. You know, I actually took the trades that I'm talking about. I'm not, like, saying, oh, I'm gonna buy this, and I'm immediately selling it, like, right after I post about it. I don't do that.
04:15:08.736 - 04:15:38.512, Speaker A: I think a lot of accounts do that, and that's why they're like, people don't trust them as much. So, yeah, I would definitely say that that's a big thing. And then also just, like, interacting with people as much as you can. Before my account was smaller, I used to reply to every single reply that I got. Like, every dm that I got, I would reply to every comment on my tweet. Like, most I would reply to, and a lot of people remember that. Like, they were like, yeah, dude, when you had three, like, three k followers back in 2020, you would reply back and forth to me, and then when you had 100k, you were still replying back and forth to me.
04:15:38.512 - 04:16:10.340, Speaker A: I only had, like, 50 followers, and a lot of people remember that. It's just like, I feel like I have kind of a community of people on Twitter now to respect me in that way, but it's just being genuine and talking to people honestly. And then, like, literally, the content that you share, obviously, if it's good content, like, if the trades are solid, people are going to respect your account more. It's like, I hit this, I hit this, I hit this. Oh, he knows what he's talking about. So that's another reason. Yeah, I think it's about being honest and genuine in your interactions and, yeah, that's exactly what you're saying there.
04:16:10.340 - 04:16:28.924, Speaker A: So we're at time now, but thank you so much, Ansem. If you want to go and see Ansem, definitely go and mob him over there, it's okay. But no, thank you so much for your time and sharing your wisdom. Cool. Thanks, man. Cheers. Good job, man.
04:16:28.924 - 04:17:31.230, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, George and Ansem, if you think you have not enough time with Ansem, he'll be back on stage at the end of the day before the closure. And the talk was very insightful. And with that, let's move on to different topic. Web three gaming and its future. Our panel will be featuring Danny Pawelowski, his CTO and co founder of Cave World, and Michael Wagner, co founder of Star Atlas and at the same time CEO of ATMTA DFL. Irvin, co founder and team lead at Defyland. And Sheeti Rasugi Manghani, she was with us yesterday and coming on stage again.
04:17:31.230 - 04:18:31.560, Speaker A: She is CEO of FSL and Stepan. And the panel will be moderated by Camilla Russo from the Defiant. So let's have a warm round of applause again. Thank you very much. Hi again, everyone. Super excited for this panel, the future of web3 gaming. I am Camila Russo, the founder of the Defiant, the best source of information for Defi and web3.
04:18:31.560 - 04:18:53.684, Speaker A: I'd love to start off by just getting quick intros from everyone. We have some great founders of some great projects. So just very briefly so we can get to the actual meat of the conversation. All right, so my name is Danny. I'm CTO, co founder of Cave World. We're one of the kind of OG originals projects that started in 2021. Along with some others.
04:18:53.684 - 04:19:41.748, Speaker A: We're building a mobile and PC multiplayer competitive game, a turn based strategy, and we're also pretty large contributors to open source in the Solana ecosystem, ranging from SDKs for Solana Mobile on Unreal and upcoming SDK for Unreal in general and just working on infrastructure and trying to make gaming happen in Solana. So that's me. Awesome. Hey, everyone, I'm Michael. I'm the co founder and CEO of Star Atlas. We're building a aaa open world space exploration MMO. We're actually doing quite a few cool things with on chain gaming logic and really trying to use Solana as kind of a backend game engine for the product itself.
04:19:41.748 - 04:20:11.674, Speaker A: I'm sure we'll get into that a bit more over the course of the conversation, but really excited to be here. Awesome. My name is DFL Irving. I'm a team leading co founder of Defi Land, the first game to launch on Solana and one of the first games after Star Outlaws, I guess, on Solana. And we've been gamifying DeFi since 2021. And currently we're building lots of different hyper casual and casual games around Solana. And yeah, we're launching soon new mobile and web games coming in the summer.
04:20:11.674 - 04:20:49.000, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. My name is Shiti and I'm the CEO of FSL. FSL is the parent company of this little game called Stepn, which is multichain, another NFT marketplace, multi chain gold. More another game on Polygon called Gas Hero, another multi chain Dex gold door, and our recently launched wallet and id service called Fslid. Awesome. Well, let's just start by talking about why gaming should be on blockchain. Like what, what about crypto and blockchain? Technology is unique.
04:20:49.000 - 04:21:23.660, Speaker A: And what does enable that traditional web two gaming cannot do. So I would say I think that we're still proving that thesis right. Should gaming be on blockchain? We think it should, because that's why we're here. I think that some early ideas kind of disproven themselves. Some people thought that vampire marketing is the main deal. And I tend to think. I think that gaming is interesting because of, well, gaming on blockchain is interesting for two reasons.
04:21:23.660 - 04:22:17.216, Speaker A: For us, composability is one. So, like the blockchain allows you to essentially release something and have a mutual language with your community and with other projects in which they can contribute to what's going on in your economy without having to coordinate with you and without you having to trust them. So I think that's one major reason, and I think the second major reason is that markets are notoriously hard to build and very expensive once you scale them. And not every game developer realizes that. And I think the blockchain is like a really cool, unified ecosystem where anyone can launch any market and participate in any market again without asking, without permission, and without being burdened with like 30% fees. So, yeah, yeah, I think that's great. I have maybe three or four different arguments that I would make in favor of on chain gaming.
04:22:17.216 - 04:23:26.584, Speaker A: I think probably the oldest one is just this idea of real and true asset ownership for the players. In every traditional studio model, there are express prohibitions from trading your assets, or selling gold, or selling a character or an account, regardless of how much time you've invested into playing that character. And I think with on chain assets, NFTs, SFT's, we do empower the player to not only enjoy their experience in the game, but also have that financial and monetary opportunity to turn around and sell those assets to another player. I think this is where marketplaces are very big, and enabling that peer to peer exchange between players is very empowering. The second is really this creation of a new form of economy. Using digital currencies as essentially the in game gold or the in game currency gives rise to this idea of play to earn, which, by the way, I've been arguing very much over the past couple of years that play to earn is not dead. Play to earn perhaps has not been executed in a way that was sustainable, but that doesn't mean that it can't work.
04:23:26.584 - 04:24:27.340, Speaker A: And so one of the things that we're heavily focused on at Star Atlas is creating sustainable systems, systems and architecture around economies that enable a producer and consumer and specialization driven system of earning from the game. So that's different from using say a hyperinflationary token emission model where yes, it might be attractive to the earliest players because they can capture a lot of value, with the unfortunate downside being that there's no utility on the back end of that token. And ultimately lately, it just leads to the demise of the token itself. And so creating more sophisticated systems of economics in say an MMO creates this global opportunity for players all over the world to participate in a new labor market of sorts. And while I think it's very important that the product that comes out is in fact entertaining, it is enjoyable. That is the core essence of what we're building. Ultimately, what, what we're creating is this brand new global economy opportunity set.
04:24:27.340 - 04:25:19.110, Speaker A: And then just to follow up on what Danny said, I completely agree that one of the biggest advantages is this idea of on chain composability, or composability rather. And so in our case, we have an orchestration of some twelve or 15 different game systems that facilitate the mechanics of playing the game. Things like movement and mining and crafting, fleet formation, XP character progression systems, all of these are living on chain. And what we're already seeing is that people from our own community are able to permissionlessly tap into that logic layer and start building their own applications on top of that. So, systems for automation, systems that integrate defi services, various tools and UI enhancements that other players are making. Nobody comes to us and asks us, us if they can do it, nor do we want them to. We just want to enable them to do that.
04:25:19.110 - 04:25:45.450, Speaker A: And that's what we're already seeing. And that's something that we're going to be pushing heavily for in the months and years to follow. Awesome. Yeah, it will be hard to add some new things to all these different things. And we covered majority of the perks of the Webster gaming, but I'll try to expand on that. Like on our experience, I believe. Like, yeah, ownership is definitely a thing that helps to differ, like what the Webster gaming and Webster gaming do and economical models is definitely a thing.
04:25:45.450 - 04:26:34.778, Speaker A: Like if you look at the one of the biggest places marketplace is that a web two has the Steam marketplace. The amount of the volume that is doing, for example, counter strike skins whatsoever. It's just like if it was an on chain and you don't get the taxes and you can just actually have it and liquid money, they'll be pretty cool and pretty big. And I believe like we're going in the right direction, but I will leave also the composability is one of the things from a different scope as well. Like different Webster games can really easily do different things together. For example, you can take one asset from an existing game, for example from Stellar Atlas, and for example bring that into the defile endgame, for example, and create a mini game around that. And that actually already helps everyone to grow the PI together because you can, one player that has one asset can actually play another game with the same asset within different game.
04:26:34.778 - 04:27:03.286, Speaker A: And you can do those in different ways. We have done that with simple, just really simply, but we have done that with Bonk as well. And we did the bonk integration there in our game and we did this really simple mini game and we got actually five k new users by that campaign. And that is something they cannot really do simply in web two. And I believe web3 enables that. And creating some kind of great experiences for the users is really important. But all the different things that the previous speakers have touched on is really important.
04:27:03.286 - 04:27:48.324, Speaker A: I believe the web3 gaming will shine a lot soon. Yeah, I would classify them in four buckets. So one is composability, second is transparency, third is ownership, and fourth is incentivization. Community. I think we have fairly spoken here with Michael, Danny and Irvin about composability and ownership, part of it. So I can maybe touch upon the community and incentivization, which has been very instrumental in how Stepn and FSL has looked when you're not a vc funded business with millions of dollars to reach consumer. I think web3 is unique in the way it gives access to users.
04:27:48.324 - 04:28:27.804, Speaker A: Building an early community with part ownership of NFTs is a fantastic and unique way. So that's what blockchain does. The second part is incentivization. So it's not like we're inventing new business models. Wetcoins and Stravas of the world are here, but what they've not been able to do really well is micropayments in a transparent way. And that's again what on chain brings to the table. So whether it's hivemapper, whether it's USD settling $3 trillion, which is the most biggest case of blockchain itself, micro or big payments on chain and transparent ways unique to blockchain again.
04:28:27.804 - 04:29:36.624, Speaker A: Okay, so fascinating stuff. I think you've all discussed some actual unique use cases for games actually having a need for blockchains. Because I think that's the main criticism we hear, is that we're trying to fit, we're trying to find a solution to a problem that doesn't exist with blockchains and games. But I think having this open composable system that's permissionless that anyone can join, then everyone owns their own assets. And we have this native incentive mechanism that's also very efficient, that allows for micropayments. I mean, those are actual things that just cannot happen in web two. So those elements are there, but maybe the question is whether they have come together in a way that actually showcases that potential.
04:29:36.624 - 04:30:21.824, Speaker A: You know, would be curious to hear your thoughts on whether that's been the case. Like, I have web3 games so far been able to convey that value to users, and if not, what's missing to make that experience as good as it can and should be? Well, have they? No, for sure. Not. Not yet. I think that game development in general is a longer process than web development or native app development. If you classify them all by time. Like you can build a web app in weeks, you can build a mobile app in months, and you can build a game in years, something like that.
04:30:21.824 - 04:31:03.734, Speaker A: And I think that the, the reasons why it hasn't happened yet is basically a lot of kind of technological barriers. So just like to give kudos to the startless team, they've released Sage, which is I'm a big fan of. And it shows off, for instance, how you can do transactions in a hot wallet on chain and stuff, because you don't have to click every single time to approve. And it's a small thing, but for gaming it's a crucial thing, because in gaming, nobody's going to play your game if the UX isn't perfect. The game has to feel great. It has to. So I think that the reason, I don't think we've seen the potential yet, and one reason is of course, the technical barrier.
04:31:03.734 - 04:31:45.262, Speaker A: And just like the innate nature of how game development takes place, it's a long process. You need to marry a lot of different conflicting elements. Amazing ux, wonderful gameplay, story world storytelling. Some things are not even like, graspable. Some things are more of a, you know, like an art form than a technical form. And then the second big issue, I think, is that for us, like building a game. So, yeah, for the first issue, we're trying to push it forward by heavily participating in open source and releasing things that make it easier for your kind of indie developer to pick up things, then do them without having to reinvent the wheel every single time.
04:31:45.262 - 04:33:07.640, Speaker A: And for the second thing that I think is preventing us from seeing the full potential is that games and crypto and trading are still bundled up together. And for me, I think the biggest one is the regulators and the people who are trying to make the rules happen in society to work around those things haven't figured out how do we treat games and the natural desire to put them together with like stocks and assets and crude oil and game tokens shouldn't and can't behave the same way. But I personally think that there's kind of like a discovery process around how do you regulate and how do you make it safe for gamers to develop something without being treated like they're treating commodities and assets and opening themselves to all sorts of regulation. This is still really unclear. And I think as that resolves itself, which takes time, regulation takes time, we will see more and more stuff makes sense. Danny, that was a good description of our, what we call Atlas prime, which is a process that we use for account architecture and structuring and permission management so that players are able to establish a game session hot wallet when they initiate a new game session, and that eliminates the need for them to sign every transaction that they're processing within the game. This is very valuable from a UX standpoint and user flow standpoint.
04:33:07.640 - 04:33:44.724, Speaker A: You know, if you're, you're moving the map five times and you have to approve that transaction through Soulflare or Phantom or backpack, well, that can get monotonous and tedious. So how do we secure and protect the user's assets in cold storage and still enable through a permission system that protects those assets, a way to operate seamlessly within the game. So thanks for bringing that up. But in terms of do we have product market fit? I would approach this probably from a market segmentation standpoint. And generally we think about three different buckets of users of the gaming product. And of course that's the gamer themselves. Now, you could get really granular on that.
04:33:44.724 - 04:34:21.220, Speaker A: Whether you're talking about mobile games, casual games, free to play, AAA games, you could create an exhaustive list. But let's just say you have the gamer that wants to come in and use the product for the experience itself. In crypto, you have the trader and the speculator, the investor mentality. These are people that might just purchase a portfolio of assets with the intention of loaning that out or renting that out, or participating in a scholarship program. They see this as a form of passive cash flows for them. So this can be a very compelling proposition. And then you do have the players that are more extractive focused.
04:34:21.220 - 04:35:47.243, Speaker A: And I, you know, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think there's actually a great opportunity, as I described in creating this opportunity set through the economy, to empower people globally who perhaps live at a lower standard of living. And I, you know, despite the criticisms of, say, axie infinity, to me, they're inspirational, because while their model wasn't long term sustainable, what they did prove out is that you can extra genuinely attract a very broad audience, even of non gamers, to your product if you can offer financial incentives. And there were people in the Philippines that were generating higher income, a higher standard of living than that which they were able to earn locally. And so if we can do that all over the world, we can bring in billions of people to games. So I think that's really powerful now in terms of who have we reached so far? In a way, we've largely reached the investor mentality and the play to earn mentality or that extractor. I think in this cycle and over the next couple of months and years, as we see some of these more sophisticated, higher quality, traditional style AAA games come online, we will start to see the onboarding of the masses prove out that what we're doing with these games not only has fundamental value from the product and entertainment standpoint, but here's a whole lot more that we can provide to you through the on chain integration and crypto integration.
04:35:47.243 - 04:36:21.508, Speaker A: Yeah, I would touch points and like think that. I think that everyone is currently experimenting with different things, like what kind of economic models work, what kind of models for fundraise work, what game design should be there. So everyone is trying to find the best product magazine. But the problem with that is mainly how this works is like for example, we have seen the axie infinity that has been really successful and then everyone was trying to be next Axie Infinity. And that doesn't work like that. Like if you. We've seen what was the problem with the economical model, but people were not thinking about that.
04:36:21.508 - 04:37:22.006, Speaker A: We were launching the games just like XD Infinity, thinking that they would be like next billion dollar company. That doesn't work like that. But additionally, the problem I believe is that people are still are not sure what kind of games they want to build. If you are building a, if you think that you want to build a AAA game and you think that your game going to be main target going to be gamers, you should not be focusing on launching some kind of different mini games or you should not be really focusing in my opinion to just like about the talking much, you should. The way web two companies in gaming work is they raise a bunch of really absolute dollars, they get a huge team and they build the product for several years nonstop. They are now focused on launching some kind of mini game, getting feedback, then doing that several times because they would not be able to build a huge game like that. So first of all, you should really decide, are you building a game for the web street legions or investors or are you going for the game that is actually going to change the webstery gaming and like people gonna play your game instead of League of Legends or Counter strike or whatsoever.
04:37:22.006 - 04:38:13.254, Speaker A: So that's the first thing people really should really consider why they are building the games. And if you are building a game for a Web street and that's pretty normal, that's what are we doing. I believe is that like then you should not really, then you should create the experience for not just the traditional gamers and cry why traditional gamers are not playing your game, but actually try to make sure that the Webster divisions, the people with the money, people who are gonna buy your token or who are gonna buy your nfts, love your game, love your experiences because those two are really, really different things. So I believe a lot of gaming studios and gaming companies are really lost between there. Like should we build a real game for the gamers can become an esport or should we go and just speculate on the price or should we just like really sell the hopes for the future? So I believe like we lost there as well. And I believe at some point everyone has lost this and everyone's trying to figure out what's the best next move. But that's the main problem, I believe as of now.
04:38:13.254 - 04:39:09.483, Speaker A: Additionally, just to quickly touch on that as well, everyone is trying to figure out like is the fully on chain games best or should you have some kind of stuff on your back end on it, running on AWS? What's kind of the perfect balance between that? So right now there is no right answer. So everyone's experimenting on that and yeah, we will see in the next couple of years. I believe that like what's the, the next best move and what the people and the actual gamers and Webster love the most. So I believe we have not found any product market feat yet, but we have done really nice experiments so far that have worked and have not worked. Yeah, I agree. I think we are in the phase of discovery, right? Where we are sort of collectively defining what do even web3 games mean? Does that mean all the moves reside on chain? Because our skills, scalability and infra is not ready for that kind of thing. Even if you were to take chess online, we can't do that with more than 2000 players just moving 64, 64 by 64 pieces.
04:39:09.483 - 04:40:31.494, Speaker A: While we are in that phase of discovery, it is possible that we arrive at some kind of game which is not viewed as a traditional AAA game with the graphics that take six months and millions of dollars to spend and make, right? For example, while people love to say what is the web3 version of Twitter and Facebook? The next biggest success for web3 after payment settlement is socialfi. And the way we have seen Frontec or bit cloud or any of those things evolve, they're going to be an evolution of Facebook and not a web3 version of Facebook. Perhaps in gaming we could be looking at gamifying things, right? So what we've seen is that before we do pure play gaming, gaming per se, there are places we could gamify lifestyle, fitness, or a different version of games that don't exist for AAA. For example, with Dark Forest, a lot of mods that came about came four bots. Because the MPC bots and the bots that were front running, they started doing the mods itself. So you know there's a big meme, right? Like for Crown. Find out we're perhaps in that stage and we'll soon find out.
04:40:31.494 - 04:41:27.850, Speaker A: I've posted that on Twitter a number of times. By the way, DFL, we will have to agree to disagree on the crowdfund iterate release in minigame model, but we can take that up off stage. Super interesting stuff. Okay, so first thing is that you all agree that web3 gaming still hasn't found product market fit. I mean, we're in the discovery phase as CT said, still experimenting and figuring out what works. And part of it is because of how long it takes to build a good game, like you were saying. And a huge part is because there's still no right answer on how much of the game should be on chain and how to serve the different audiences or groups that are actually interested in web3 gaming.
04:41:27.850 - 04:42:55.144, Speaker A: Because there are very different interests and groups at play. Like Michael was saying, the traders and speculators, the extractive users were wanting to earn money from the game and just the gamers themselves. But I think the core of it, the answer has to come through building an actually enjoyable game first and then all those groups will be satisfied at some point because you can speculate around the game. But for that model to be successful, the game has to create actual value. It has to have actual gamers using those assets for gaming. But I'd love to come back to this point on, you know, what aspects should be blockchain based, what not like what's the right balance? If we can just spend a little bit of time talking about that, I think it's super interesting. And should those aspects be fully abstracted from the end user or are people coming to web3 games actually interested in just seeing crypto like interacting directly with the blockchain and crypto assets? All of it? I think like it's.
04:42:55.144 - 04:43:29.836, Speaker A: You can't really. I don't really believe that you can say what should be. I think everyone is going to do something else and we're going to see what works and what doesn't. I know that some people are religiously saying that if you are even a little bit not on chain, you're not a real web3 game. And then some people are, you know, going to the opposite extreme and saying like, you know, before because we have one NFT, like we're a crypto, like. But are. Is anyone wrong in this equation? I'm not necessarily thinking so because it's not a religion, we're not a cult.
04:43:29.836 - 04:44:09.838, Speaker A: We're trying to basically discover how can we use a technology which is in the end it's a technology which turned into subculture and a movement and a community. There's a lot of kind of ideology in involved freedom from controlling parties and trustlessness and everything. But I think that, you know, all of it is applicable. I don't see personally, maybe, you know, other people could disagree, but I don't see that there should be something. I think we should try everything. And I think for the bigger, more funded crews, I think they definitely should push the envelope forward in what can be done fully on change. Because it's complex.
04:44:09.838 - 04:44:37.878, Speaker A: Like it takes a lot of money to and a lot of man hours to actually build fully on chain. Stuff you can't do like build quick and break things, move fast and break things on chain. It just simply doesn't work. But yeah, I think everyone should do everything. And the more design space we explore, the more we will find out. Like was said here, what is, what works? Because it's like, should or shouldn't doesn't really work like that. It works.
04:44:37.878 - 04:45:40.464, Speaker A: What do people like? What do people not like? And if someone likes to play a game where only like one NFT is on chain and the red fine. If ever, if someone loves to interact with something where every little tiny thing is a complex 25 contract, you know, that is also amazing. Yeah, I guess, like the question is, like, how can games better leverage the technology? Or like, yeah, like what, what do you guys think? Or how should crypto be leveraged in gaming? Like what. What part of crypto makes sense to add to games? It's literally every part. Yeah, so, like we've. So we had a little experiment that we did with like a card game where literally everything is on chain as part of like a hackathon thing, and then markets where I think we still haven't fully exhausted the extent of what you can do with blockchain. And some people say like, no, it's terrible to put data on chain.
04:45:40.464 - 04:46:34.634, Speaker A: Why would you do that? It's too expensive, blah, blah. But then people do put data on chain and it works great. So I think if you have a cool idea and you think it should be tried and you have the enough people to fund that attempt, because, like, that's the cool thing about crypto. Like, if there's a community that's willing to, let's say, buy your NFT or something and use those funds to explore a certain idea, I think it should be tried. But obviously the most obvious attempts, or the most obvious things, people are using it for markets because crypto is inherently financial. So anything that has to do with microtransactions and markets and items and trading and everything. But also I think I've seen some really cool use cases of character profiles that can exist fully on chain, that can then be shared between multiple games and universes.
04:46:34.634 - 04:47:41.674, Speaker A: I've seen really cool stuff that has to do with, like, resource generation and mining, and literally anything that has to do with, like, exchanging hands trustlessly. And so it lends itself to that. But I think we're going to see crazier and crazier stuff as we build. Danny, Star Atlas might very well be a cult, just for clarification, but I'll maybe address the other part of the question, which is the abstraction component that you were asking about. Should the users know that they're interacting with blockchain, in our opinion, and I'm pretty outspoken about being an evangelist for the underlying ideology or philosophy of crypto, having been in the space for a very long time now. So I'm a major proponent of not abstracting that away, not necessarily using custodial services. I think there are some innovations that are coming along, like MPC services, where you can provide a safety mechanism for users to recover their assets in the event they were to lose a seed phrase or something like that.
04:47:41.674 - 04:48:43.154, Speaker A: But generally speaking, what I believe is that we should be encouraging our users to understand the technology and how to use the technology. And in many ways that is counterproductive for business purposes because we're essentially creating friction in the onboarding process. If it was one click, you, you just start playing the game, your wallet spins up in the background, you never have to worry about protecting those assets. Well, sure, in one sense, that's a lot easier to get that user on board, and maybe it is even safer for the majority of users out there. But what I believe is that if we can inform people and educate people through time, and I think we have a really great opportunity to do this with gaming, because when people are having fun, they'll have a higher propensity to learn and spend time learning. If we teach people about how to self custody assets and secure their wallets and protect their seed phrases, then they will be exposed to all of the tangential benefits of every product and service that's available in crypto today. And that includes things like Defi.
04:48:43.154 - 04:50:01.350, Speaker A: So I don't think we need to pigeonhole users directly into a specific gaming product. I think there's a bigger opportunity here to bring them in, Trojan horse them into crypto with a fun game, teach them about the wallet setup process and then release them into the wild and let them be a bigger part of the crypto ecosystem. Super interesting take. What do you guys think? Erwin and Chidi, is it? Do you think people should go through a tougher time and in order to be truly onward it to crypto and learn about it through gaming? Or would you rather, you know, have like a very seamless web two, like experience and just like get the next billion users faster? Yeah, I believe I would have to agree that like, we have to educate the people about like how, why web3, why they should care about ownership, what's the wallet, how that works. But like, I believe, like can afford an onboarding process and experience is a huge friction. Like whenever there is a guy coming and sees like this, twelve words that see the phrase like, you have to write that down on the paper, it's a little bit hard. So I think that the best, in my opinion, the best way of the onboarding is like you onboard them really smoothly, maybe with studies, socials, Google or Facebook logins and whatsoever.
04:50:01.350 - 04:50:52.714, Speaker A: And then while they are playing your game, you slowly turn them into the power users you educate them, you give them quizzes, you give them your tokens. If they answer, if they create the wallet and they write down on the paper, you incentivize them and turn to power users, and then you release in the wallet, as I mentioned, then I believe that's a great thing to do. And in my opinion, doing that on the onboarding process is a little bit tricky. It's a little hard thing to do on an education perspective. But if you do that in the process of, while they are having fun, they will enjoy it and they will become really great power users and that they will bring even more users as well to your game and crypto. Yeah, I think technology works best when it's in the background. If it becomes the conversation, adoption hinders always.
04:50:52.714 - 04:51:27.412, Speaker A: I think I said it yesterday as well. We don't say anymore how beautiful or wonderful electricity is, but fundamentally, the world runs on electricity, electricity, tech, including this, everything, health, infrastructure, government, education, AI, existed for 20 years, right, in chatbots and everything that we do. But chat, GPD had to come for it to have mass adoption. The real use case, fun, experience, convenience, whatever. That moment for blockchain is going to come. Yes, it's inevitable. It is that beautiful attack.
04:51:27.412 - 04:52:24.000, Speaker A: But we have to get to the level of scalability when mass adoption can happen. Right now, we're caught in this loop where Stepn got 5 million users and Solana broke. Solana got congested the moment meme hit, right? So we're sort of in this negative prophecy where the moment we get many users, the infra breaks that apart. The users fundamentally come to our production for fun experience in case of gaming, for community accountability, belongingness or financial gains or convenience, which broadly is one of the biggest use cases of the crypto right now. Till the time we can develop a fun or a gamified way in a proper, proper way, I think financial is the way to go. Because it's financial, a lot of education is needed. So that's what I agree here, what's being discussed.
04:52:24.000 - 04:53:16.446, Speaker A: Right? So because people have to have security of their assets and protection, and the space is anyway full of rug pulls and scams, education is needed. But can education alone lead to the kind of mass adoption that we're looking for? Maybe not. Yeah, that's the way we sow seeds, the way we get an early adopter community, and that's exactly where we are. But if we have our sights set on billions of users, we have to have the infra tech, gamified experiences, fun, everything in a place. And it's going to happen step by step. I think, collectively, we are all doing that sort of effort in our own little way, developing products, developing tech, developing use cases, education pieces to slowly get there. Great.
04:53:16.446 - 04:54:02.654, Speaker A: Okay. So I'm glad we got two very different takes on how gaming should happen. Probably the answer is somewhere in the middle. I think it's like Sidi said, the next game that really breaks out to the mainstream probably won't look like previous web two games. That and maybe that uniqueness is how people will experience crypto through the game. So kind of like what Michael was saying, just like having that, actually acknowledging, oh, like, this is, this is, I can't do this because of crypto. In any case, I think we will see a lot of the next wave of users come through web3 games.
04:54:02.654 - 04:55:09.424, Speaker A: So, yeah, great to hear from all you guys on what's coming and where we are in this huge piece of the sector. So thank you so much for a fascinating talk, and thank you all. Thank you. Thanks. A big thank you to our speakers. Next in line, we will have our live talk presented by Michael repetny. And Michael has been a core contributor to the Marinade Dao since 2021, where he's leading the effort to make Solana more secure, stable, and censorship resistant through responsible soul staking.
04:55:09.424 - 04:56:05.538, Speaker A: Let's welcome on stage Michael Rupertny. All right, hello, everyone. Hey, kas Merhaba. Neso sinus, right? So let me kick it off with a question, and thanks to all of you for having me in this beautiful city of Istanbul. So, the question I have for you to kick it off is, like, which of you thinks that Solana staking is, like, the most exciting thing that you could be doing with crypto? Well, I guess you're lying, right? In some sense, because, like, let's face it, it might not be the most exciting. And, yeah, to the forex, I would need a clicker to move on, but it might not be the most exciting thing. But it's important.
04:56:05.538 - 04:56:40.690, Speaker A: It's important to get it right. It's like, it's like the electricity to make Solana working and keep it running. Thanks a lot. So today I'll be talking about staking. I'm Michael. I've been contributing to the Marinade Dao for, since 2021 and working for Solana to make it more stable, secure, censorship resistant. And today, I'm excited to announce the next chapter for Marinade here, the V two version, which takes everything that we've learned throughout those three years, bakes it in.
04:56:40.690 - 04:57:01.906, Speaker A: The product challenges the staking as it is, and I believe it sets the new staking meta. And you guys are the first one to see what's ahead of us. There's no tweet, no medium. We're doing it right here, right now. So let's get to it. So, to set some context first and the agenda kind of of the call. So we start easy.
04:57:01.906 - 04:57:32.758, Speaker A: We take it easy. We start like, what is source taking? What's the essence of source taking? What's the current state of source taking, and how Solana is decentralized today from different optics. And then we get to the current challenges of Solana staking. And basically, I'll run you through the history real quick, how we got to where we are today. And then let's do it. Let's drop the alpha. So I'll walk you through the roadmap of Marinade V two and the three pillars that makes it possible.
04:57:32.758 - 04:58:08.820, Speaker A: And they are super interesting. That takes the staking to whole another ten x improvement to what you witnessed today if you're staking Solana. So, first of all, let's kick it off very easy. What Solana is taking. So Solana is a global state machine that's run by thousands of validators across the world. And Solana staking is in some sense like a representative democracy. So by staking your sol, you give those computers a voting power, then, to represent you in the consensus.
04:58:08.820 - 04:59:02.506, Speaker A: So you decide with your soul staking. We have roughly 1700 validators on Solana, those computers across the world, and they process thousands of transactions every second and come to an agreement on a consensus, like what the latest state is. You have close to half a million Solana citizens or delegators, just like you guys owning Sol, where those citizens can stake the sol. And by staking the sol, you basically put those validators in charge, and you decide which of those computers have how much power in the network consensus. So you have half a million citizens. Then those validators, or those parties, we can call them in this democracy for their job. If it's done well, they are rewarded with Solana tokens.
04:59:02.506 - 04:59:38.048, Speaker A: They take a cut, some commission, and most of it gets shared with the citizens, the delegators. So that's like the game theory, the whole system to set the scene. Now, where are we currently with the Sol staking? Or in other words, how is Solana doing when it comes to decentralization, how resilient it is. So one optics to look at it is geographically. If we look at it, where the solids take today, it looks like this. So that's the map and the biggest clusters of staked soil when you look at it geographically. So it's not that bad.
04:59:38.048 - 05:00:21.654, Speaker A: It can be better. And one optics how to look at decentralization is that on Solana, you need two thirds of all stake to agree on a consensus. To keep it moving, you need two thirds of all stakeholders. So the validators need to agree. In other words, if you lose that one third, this 33%, that can cause problems that can take the network down, basically. So some way to look at it, and this term was coined back then a few years ago, called Nakamoto coefficient. That means like, what is the smallest number of independent entities that can collectively act to take the network down.
05:00:21.654 - 05:00:51.250, Speaker A: So let's take a look at the Nakamoto coefficient, or what it takes to reach this critical one third stake on Solana. So when it comes to validators, I was talking, we have 1700 validators on Solana, a big number. 21 of those have enough of a stake. So those are the biggest. The biggest. 21 technically, collectively, could take the network down if they were offline in one moment. This number back then when we started, was hovering around ten.
05:00:51.250 - 05:01:39.250, Speaker A: So it doubled since then, which is great, we can still do better, but that's the validator entities. There are also other optics, how to look at the decentralization of Solana. And let's face it, when it comes to data centers or countries or even a running client, the numbers are much worse there. So Solana is young, we're still early, but we need to face it that we can do better. And that's something at marinate, we've been thinking from the very start, how to make the network more resilient, how to make it more decentralized through many ways. If we look at the staked sol distribution split, so marinates, Amsoil pioneered the liquid staking back in 2021. Recently, many other stake pools followed the way.
05:01:39.250 - 05:02:23.436, Speaker A: So we have tens of lsds, maybe now in Solana, but if you combine them all together, you get 6% of the stakehold market share. So it's very like a drop in the ocean compared to some other segments. So, for example, those validators that are privately run charge 100% commission, they have four times more stake than all stake pools on Solana combined. Just to set some context. So now off to the issues and how we get there. So, back in 2021, or why we built marinade in the first place, there were some set of challenges, some problems. We are thinking those are the crucial problems to solve first, prior to marinade, if you wanted to stake your sol.
05:02:23.436 - 05:02:48.902, Speaker A: You needed to have it locked up. So it was there. Sitting with a validator, you could not really use it. It was there and it takes two to three days to stake it back. You could not use it in Defi, for example, the next thing, performance tracking. So if you stick it with a validator now, if that validator goes offline or they change commission, you guys might be losing rewards. So it takes some work to manually track if the validator is still performing well.
05:02:48.902 - 05:03:42.884, Speaker A: And finally, this leads to or back then, and still now it leads to big stake concentration. So that's why people stake to the biggest OG names, the validators like exchanges and so on, because they believe that they are the trusted. But I'll show you kind of the opposite. So back at then 2021, Marinate launched MSOL and tackled the problem of being locked up with the liquid staking token. So it pioneered liquid staking back then 2021. Not only that, that you are liquid, but you don't need to track your validators anymore because marinate tracks also picks the most 100 plus performance and moves the stake automatically rebalances it so that you don't need to watch it. And it sticks too many, not too one, which is the last point marinates would skip the biggest velators, the already big ones, to delegate the stake to the long tail.
05:03:42.884 - 05:04:14.164, Speaker A: The community validators that are small, emerging, starting, they are not that big. And regular user wouldn't have staked to them because they are unknown. So this is how we started. But right now, even with all this, like I was saying, marinates, amsoil got only the 3% market share. So we needed to come back to the table and be like, okay, what are the problems really today? And we think we got the new set of problems. So why people didn't want to use Amsoil or any other LST. The number one reason was the smart contract risk.
05:04:14.164 - 05:04:49.928, Speaker A: Like you send your sole somewhere and just most of the market, they don't want to do it. The validator risk that still stands. So you basically need to trust that validator that you stake with is that they'll be online, they will not change commission. And finally, the suboptimal yield, meaning that all stake pools they charge, including MSO, they charge a performance fee on top of the commission of the validator. That combined means that you get less yield than if you would go directly to the validator. So let's face it, those are the problems that you think are worth to solve. And throughout marinate too.
05:04:49.928 - 05:05:22.864, Speaker A: I'll be happy to walk you through it one by one, how we're tackling it. So let's start off with the smart contract risk. So, for smart contract, back in last year, summer, we launched a product called Marinate Native, which completely eliminates the smart contract risk. And here's how it works. So, traditionally, at the top, as I was saying, with LST, with the stake pool, with liquid staking, you take your soil, and you send a soil to a smart contract. You get back this redeemable receipt token, which is liquid. You can use it in defi.
05:05:22.864 - 05:05:46.890, Speaker A: Now, some people are hesitant. Even with marinade, it's been around for three years. Some people are hesitant just to send salt somewhere, and they want to play it safe. That's why 95% of the staking market stakes it the native way. So we introduced something that's called marinade native that only sits on top of classic solana staking. So you get to keep the sol. It stays on your wallet.
05:05:46.890 - 05:06:11.024, Speaker A: What it does is that it only manages the stake authority of your staking, while you get to keep the Vedra authority. So you have it at all times in your wallet. You can see all the stake accounts. They are changed automatically by marinade. But at no point marinate native can touch your Sol tokens. So that's the first thing that got us started. And now more than 10,000 users with 3 million Sol have been using it.
05:06:11.024 - 05:06:35.784, Speaker A: And next off. And what we're rolling out right now, it's for the validatorisk, so protected staking rewards, or PSR. The way how it works is that it puts the valeter's skin in the game. We call it for the first time. For the first time, we align the interest. So, let's say you're staking to a valetor, and you expect a yield, say, 7.5% yield.
05:06:35.784 - 05:06:56.276, Speaker A: If that validator in that epoch, in those two days, goes down for 5 hours, it's 10% downtime, and you're not getting 7.5%. For that epoch, you get like 10% less, and nobody is recovering you. That's it. That's your lost yield. That's why you need to pick. Very well. So we're thinking, let's change it.
05:06:56.276 - 05:07:30.390, Speaker A: Let's fix it. And with the protected staking reward system, the way it works is that marinade now requires every validator to have a bond, to have a deposit in the form of stall, a collateral, and if they go offline or if they change commission from this bond, then we recover the expected yield. So, in another way, PSR, brings you finally, 100% uptime, no matter what. And we take it on the validator side because they should deliver, the projected yield should equal what you get in the end. So this is PSR. Very excited about that. It's been rolled out.
05:07:30.390 - 05:08:26.274, Speaker A: The way it works, that validators need to get some stall per stake. We have more than 400 validators on Solana with the bond, and so far charged something like close to 20 sol to go back to stakers because they expected this yield. And finally, the suboptimal yield, like I was talking about. We are happy to announce that we're working on a system that we call Sam or a stake auction marketplace. So the way it works is that marinade, with its 10 million, Solnow, would put this delegation up there in, in the open market. So we invite now every Solana villager to go and basically place bits how much they would like to pay to get the stake. So this means it's completely inclusive marketing system where marinade would delegate the so out there to the public, to the market, and then validators would pay for it.
05:08:26.274 - 05:09:10.064, Speaker A: What it means now, especially with transaction fees and MBV, that technically in a super efficient market, the validators should bid each other and then marinate would pick the highest bidding validators, and all those bids would flow back to users, to stakers, 100%, which means quite substantially increase the yield for the stakers in the end, including MBV, including transaction fees, including any revenue that the validator has, because they bid almost close to their hardware costs. In some sense, it's kind of like a race to the bottom. So this means enhanced taking yield for users. And basically that's it. That's it in a nutshell. I'm dropping here with you guys. Now it's your turn.
05:09:10.064 - 05:10:04.644, Speaker A: I'm happy to invite you to stop sticking to one while it starts staking too many. And thanks for having me. It's been great to talk now about Marinade V two. As I was talking about it, I'll leave you with this final teaser. You can catch me around, we can talk more, but thank you very much. I'm leaving you with this video. All right.
05:10:04.644 - 05:10:46.934, Speaker A: That was a great presentation, Michael. Thank you. Well, next in rounds, we will have our next fireside chat. Our next speaker is the co founder and CEO of Injective Labs. If you're not familiar, what I'm talking about. Injective is the blockchain built for finance. It's an open, interoperable smart contracts network for applications shaping the future of defi.
05:10:46.934 - 05:11:12.554, Speaker A: If it sounds complicated. I will have Eric Chan in conversation with Mia Grodsky here. Eric Chan, he is from Injective labs. And Mia Grodsky, she is head of pr and media, step finance. So let's have a warm welcome and applause. Thank you very much. Ready? Not ready.
05:11:12.554 - 05:11:57.494, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. I think we're calling Eric now to get him up here. Hey, guys, how's it going? Ah, hey, Eric. Thanks so much for joining us. Hey, sorry to surprise you like that. Well, I don't know if you can see our audience or not, but I'm standing in a very crowded room full of Solana developers. We're on day two of the conference, and we're very excited to have you here and to chat with you.
05:11:57.494 - 05:12:22.554, Speaker A: Thanks so much. Really appreciate you having me. Great. Well, maybe you could give us just an overview of what is injective and a little bit about your background to start. Yeah, so, hey, guys, this is Eric Chen, co founder and CEO of Injective Labs. Started working on injective since 2018. Before that, was mainly participating in research and honestly spent most of my time in school.
05:12:22.554 - 05:13:13.004, Speaker A: So injective is a. A sector specific layer one blockchain built for financial applications. It's an open, interoperable layer one blockchain powering the next generation of DeFi applications, including a lot of very unique decentralized bot and derivatives exchanges, prediction markets, lending protocols and much, much more. It's built on top of the cosmos SDK and utilizes ten minutes proof of stake consensus mechanism with a lot of optimizations reaching 25,000 plus TPS. And of course, the most exciting thing we've done recently, and that's a bigger part of our collaboration, is spinning up the electrochain initiative with InevM and InS VM, alongside with many, many ecosystem developers working on it in collaboration. Great. So let's dive a little bit deeper into the injective SVM.
05:13:13.004 - 05:14:18.076, Speaker A: Can you tell us a bit about when this launched and just what opportunities, opportunities there exist on there for Solana developers? Yeah, of course. So one of the biggest problem we noticed for the injective ecosystem is that developers come from all different walks of life. Some of them could be extremely familiar with EVM, and a lot of them, we start to notice, if not a majority of them are extremely familiar with SPM. And this kind of created an opportunity for us to really huddle down and build out a multi vm environment to bring on all the developers from all walks of life into leveraging injective's native infrastructure and to provide value for the Solana ecosystem and to scale various applications utilizing these type of native on chain primitives on injective to build powerful applications for cross chain use cases. So currently inside development with quite a few companies and parties and I think the timeline will be released soon. Awesome. And tell us a little bit about your relationship with Solana.
05:14:18.076 - 05:15:54.742, Speaker A: What about this ecosystem excites you? What do you want to see people doing with the injective SVM? Yeah, so I think Solana has created this very impressive mind share of advanced financial developers and also various advanced use cases for different types of general base layer applications. That was previously demonstrated within the Ethereum ecosystem and now elevated once more within Solana ecosystem. And for injective scales, it's for us to create a kind of like a biased sector specific layer one blockchain environment with these out of box chain native modules for all these Solana applications and these types of Solana protocols to leverage, to synergize with the cross chain propensity of the injected ecosystem and to extract liquidity to provide liquidity, or to synergize various financial flows or various transactions across all the multi chain world. Yeah, so let's talk a little bit about the inevm. You have about 20 dapps that are widely used and live on there. Can you give us some insights as to the Dapps that were built on there that are kind of in high demand from your user base and then maybe relate that again to what you expect to see for Solana? Yeah. So obviously Imigam is heavily in development and the 20 Dapps are simply, Dappset has gained significant traction already in other multi chain environments.
05:15:54.742 - 05:17:24.176, Speaker A: Last I checked, there's probably hundreds of dapps at this point, if not thousands, built by various community developers and projects, et cetera. And of those ten to 20 dapps, which are mainly migration across deployment, such as layer zero, et cetera, building and integrating with the ecosystem. It has done very, very surprising amount of transaction and traction within the ecosystem and brought a lot of already synergy with the injective ecosystem, the ethereum ecosystem and many, many more. And of course, with the success of Inevm, there's also been further development into exploring cross chain synergies, or cross roll up synergies with arbitrum. And we aim to kind of follow the footstep of nano Akman even further with InSDM by kind of synergizing even deeply with the injective ecosystem and the saloni system, given the native overlap in terms of contract language, that is rust, and of course leveraging the alignment of developer thesis on being high performant, on being advanced compared to a lot of the base layer applications are currently being pursued within the theorem ecosystem. Yeah, so this weekend, you know, yesterday and today, we've been talking a lot about meme coins. We've been talking a lot about that kind of meme coin mania that's hit Solana.
05:17:24.176 - 05:18:46.646, Speaker A: Some people are speculating that this is the new sort of bull market or buzzword for this cycle. Other people are sort of saying that this is maybe more of a passing trend. What's your take on watching that kind of come in full force and get a lot of attention recently? I mean, this isn't the first time we've seen such trends and such narratives are being popped up. One thing I do notice is that time and time again, meme coin, which is basically a signaling or kind of like a marker of community alignment and community strength, coming on at various points of every single cycle and taking a significant kind of like passion and energy from the community members, I would say, you know, like, it's very, very clear that, you know, these type of trends. It's a very simple economic signaling of the strength of the community, and it's here to stay. Now, the main problem is obviously, you know, well, like a specific coin like cat with, I don't know, sunglasses will be the everlasting meme trend out there for the next decade. That's very, very hard to say, and I think it has to be evaluated independently because we see the trends of a lot of the meme coins, but the names rarely do overlap.
05:18:46.646 - 05:19:34.840, Speaker A: Now, I'm personally a big fan of Doc with hat, so I definitely hope that it comes up time and time again. We had a car with hat here yesterday at the conference. We'll send a photo to you, but it was a car with hat, and you can probably find it on Twitter as well. So let's talk a little bit more about maybe some of the advantages for Solana developers to be building on injective. What do you see as just kind of the big trade offs for them? Again, I know you can't see our audience, but we're in a room with a lot of developers who maybe haven't heard of injective. So what are the, you know, kind of big takeaways you want people to know? Yeah. So going down into like a bit of specific technical detail, et cetera.
05:19:34.840 - 05:21:16.684, Speaker A: So for injectives native environment, the storage layer is typically, especially with store v two, like improvements and upcoming like Cosmos SDK 50, it's a lot more convenient and a lot more economical compared to the Solana environment. And that's because obviously Solana provides a much higher or much faster block time compared to injective block time. This basically creates an environment where it's very clear and probable pros and cons, where you get to access storage. And this type of storage layer allows for on chain, immediately accessible and highly scalable order book layer that can expressively represent liquidity, that can express itself, represent different types of settlement with a lot more ease of access for a lot of archival data or persistent data being stored on chain. And this type of advantage obviously translates well into SVM, which tries to access at a bare minimum, like a translation layer between the native environments or native contracts being built within ins vm with the injective core chain primitives. And what this allows for is that, you know, you're going to see like a native order book that powers, you know, the access kind of like the root for the entire, you know, tree of offerings within the injective ecosystem. And this type of roof has a very much blockchain efficient, designed by a frequent batch auction that can allow for parallelization scaling, that can allow for, you know, almost like a kind of longevity potential for optimization in the long term.
05:21:16.684 - 05:22:05.460, Speaker A: And what this allows for is kind of this fundamental layer of building block being always going, being always cheaper and more efficient and faster for developers to access, for developers to utilize, for developers to tap into for the entire multichain world and synergize it by it further and further and layer and layer of like liquidity reinforcement, flow reinforcement, and just general, like DAP reinforcements. Yeah. And so injective, you know, I guess the topic of this panel is, yeah, a multi chain future. And obviously injective is integrated with many different l one s. And as you said at the beginning, you know, kind of built on top of the cosmos SDK. And I still feel like we're in this field where new l one s are kind of popping up. Like I'll be at conferences or I'll meet people and I'll hear of projects.
05:22:05.460 - 05:23:46.018, Speaker A: And just from the injective side of things, when you're looking at who to integrate with or which environments you're going to build, how are you analyzing this? And I guess maybe going back to when you first heard about Solana, how soon after were you working on integrating? Yeah, so I think for injective's case, it's more about like a sector specific approach when it comes to developer looking to build various type of, kind of like non financial related or kind of like general perhaps pure gaming and or like pure social et cetera, like type of decentralized applications. We typically would go to them and say like hey genuinely we think that there's probably like better environments at an injective for you to thrive and to grow in the most successful way possible. Because at the end injective isn't trying to be like an X killer, Y killer, like Z Killer or whatever. It's trying to act as this hub that takes an opinionated stand on a specific type of primitive versus a specific type of transaction and trying to serve in an unopinone way to all these layer one environment. So all these, you know, like a multi, multi chain world of madness so that you know, like injective can have its unique offering that's, you know, absolutely being reinforced. And you know, more importantly that's necessary to be decentralized for it to, you know, stand as a blockchain, as a layer one environment. But you know, purely for the financial use cases which decentralization is the most critical ethos.
05:23:46.018 - 05:25:17.568, Speaker A: Yeah. And in your time in the space, do you feel like your definition of multi chain or the way that you think about that concept has evolved, you know, as the tech has changed? Can you tell us a little bit about just how your thinking, you know, has shifted over the years? Yeah, I think it went from like 180 and then another 180 which is back to 360 because essentially like 2018 or 2017. It was very much of a multi chain world. There were a lot more diversity in terms of like contract environment, you know, different types of languages popping up, different types of vms popping up on top of, you know, like the debate or like the battle amongst like multiple consensus mechanisms. And then it slowly became almost like a monolithic, like a single chain thesis or you know, like an oligopoly of layer one environment. And then you know, like with, with the success of Solana, with the success of all these very, very impressive, you know, like layer one environments that really proved its position or proved its longevity within the space. It kind of went back into a 360 where it's like, okay, so clearly back in the day it was way too early to kind of like enact the multi chain thesis and there were, it was clearly spending too much time on, you know, debating on like various peculiarities of consensus properties or vms without having you know, like a specific like business substance or you know, like kind of social substance behind those type of layer one environments.
05:25:17.568 - 05:26:24.202, Speaker A: And now we have evolved into the second stage where a lot of things are making sense. A lot of the trade offs are very, very much rational, and developers are presented with a very, very clear choice amongst all of these layer one, especially between Ethereum and Solana, on what is the pros and cons on deploying on Ethereum versus deploying on Solana, what do you get in terms of advantage? What are the specific trade offs? And I think the world is going to be a lot more, in a sense, beautiful because there's a lot more expressive and a lot more layer one environments with different types of characteristics serving the user base in the end. Yeah. And I think that's something that's really great about projects like injective as well, where it's like you are compatible with these different l one s. You kind of have users from many different chains, and you get to go to pretty much any conference and you fit into those ecosystems. I know you guys go to a lot of events, have a really strong community throughout the world. And so I want to steer our conversation towards, towards something a little bit different.
05:26:24.202 - 05:27:20.722, Speaker A: But I know it's something you've been thinking about a lot lately. And I'm just going to ask the audience quickly, is anyone here who's heard of RWAs or who's seen that word? Okay, we have maybe about 20 hands raised. So, Eric, could you maybe define rwas for everyone and just kind of give, just explain what that is? Yeah, so RWA, functionally speaking, is basically like a tokenized representation, representation of some asset or some concept or some goods that exists within the real life. And this is very much similar. So good certificates is very much similar to stocks in the electronic trading world. It's simply a tokenized or digital representation to resolve the immobility of the underlying goods at scale or at longevity or shelf life of those underlying goods. So that's why commodities are typically tokenized.
05:27:20.722 - 05:28:42.974, Speaker A: That's why companies are typically tokenized in a certain way. And funds are typically tokenized because they generally have real life counterpart operations or entities or actual palpable storage for those goods. And RWA is this trend that it was basically the most classic example or use case for blockchains, even since it was first proposed as an idea. And time and time again, there's been attempts on various firms and various protocols or various teams trying to tackle this problem, trying to bring mainstream adoption. But it's always convoluting factor of timing, could be resource, it could be adoption that really missed the mark. And currently, for the past few years or past really one or two years, it's really, really getting more and more promising to do a lot of their early investment and showing early signs that RWA adoption is providing extremely palpable value add value prop. And more importantly, users have a genuinely very good reason of adopting the RWA offer by, or powered by blockchain, because it's cheaper, right? Yeah, I think like you said, even in this last year, there's been so much buzz about RWAS.
05:28:42.974 - 05:30:44.014, Speaker A: A lot of experts and even economists outside of crypto have predicted this potential 1 trillion market. And, you know, when someone throws out a number like that, obviously people are going to pay attention, so they're going to start looking at it a bit more closely. And it's my understanding that at injective you had a main net upgrade recently and you introduced the first RWA module that allows institutions to launch and access different structured products in RWAS. Can you tell us a little bit about that and also what kind of collaborations and partnerships you're hoping to have in the future with institutions and just maybe how these institutions are approaching RWAs and potentially working with injective? Yeah, and I would like to notice in a comical way, like this is like the type of stuff that a sector specific or opinionated or purpose built sublocking can get away with, which is kind of building out like a core chain primitive that gets adopted within the entire chain and adopted by all evaluators. So we initially were trying to tackle the specific liquidity fragmentation issue with RWAS, and more importantly, the fundamental incompatibility for RWA assets versus any type of permissionless DeFi protocols, or basically to create backporting or future proof way of bridging RWA assets or permission by nature with the liquidity and flow in a prioritized way too, to the global DeFi ecosystem, especially starting from the DeFi ecosystem with injective. And the way we did this is by proposing a module that it's almost like a permissioning wrapper on top of the existing native token standard with an injective. And what that allows for is for optimistic transferability while retaining the permission nature things.
05:30:44.014 - 05:33:03.594, Speaker A: And it allows for like a transaction or composability to not be broken when trying to interact with a certain defi protocol or with a certain like, you know, like defi mechanism or certain contract in a general sense. But when it's being transferred to kind of like individuals outside of permissioning set by kind of resolving the stock fund issue, which is, you know, the fundamental reason why it's incompatible with DeFi protocols, it creates a voucher system which allows for fund to be immediately routed to that specific module and allows for the sender or the source initiator to claim it back, to basically reinitiate the proper transaction within the permissioned counterparty. And what this allows for is, you know, like you can trade the RW asset on helix, perhaps, you know, helix could be, you know, if the RWA issuer chooses. The helix can be kind of this de facto platform where, you know, anyone can openly trade it in one scenario, but in order for them to, you know, actually take custody or hold it, it would have to be within a permission or, you know, within the whitelist is set. And on top of that, there's also a lot of different kind of inheritance of permission assets, along with the potential for RWA assets to be bridged from Solana, to be bridged from Ethereum, where the whitelist that is inherited from the source chain, source destination. All this allows for is not necessarily creating something or creating an ecosystem that completely deviates from what has been kind of like an implicit consensus for all the RWA issuers, but to create more fidelity or more dynamic range of optionality from the strictest compliance, which is only the permission, KYC participants can hold it all the way and add more kind of optionality from full permissionless to full permissioned. So this way different types of issuers for different types of assets has a lot more choice and has a lot more kind of like control with the parameter of permissionality, if that's a word to choose from.
05:33:03.594 - 05:34:14.654, Speaker A: And so since you've done this upgrade, are there any sort of, I guess, growth stats or insights you can share with us just in regards to. Yeah, I mean, this is a very much of a long term investment. So basically like the permissioned a module upgrade has basically sparked a lot of integrations, a lot of existing work for different types of platform to adopt. Obviously a lot of existing RWA platforms has already deployed on top of injective for that. But I think this is the type of upgrade that has a four to five year horizon for it to truly replace a critical layer within the traditional financial ecosystem. I would say it would probably take a while before we see a very, very kind of eye catching stats of a billion plus asset has been issued on this or a billions of dollars a transaction, simply because the velocity of these type of transaction is very, very meaningful on a deployment basis. But it takes a very, very long time to truly gain steam and truly gain ground.
05:34:14.654 - 05:34:49.910, Speaker A: But once it does, it's truly unstoppable. Yeah, and we've had a lot of conversations this weekend about the trade offs of Solana, the positives of Solana. And I think one thing that's been consistent in a lot of talks is just how it really is, the l one that's accessible to someone entering crypto right now. So let's say I'm brand new to crypto and I buy a little bit of soul. I don't have much crypto. I can still go and trade on Solana and gas fees or low, and it's fast, do you think? You know, I'd love to hear your take on, you know, RWas and Solana. Again, this kind of long term vision.
05:34:49.910 - 05:35:56.074, Speaker A: What do you see as the potential collaboration there? I think at the end of the day, like, RWA is simply like ERC 20 with a little bit more aggressive blacklist. So it basically means that, you know, like, RWA will be incorporated into the Defi ecosystem and kind of have its level of adoption after a few years of maturity to be almost identical to the permissionless ERC 20 or Solana, your name token counterparts. So for whether that be ERC 20 or SPL tokens, et cetera, it's just going to be an asset that exists within the ecosystem like any other asset, with the high transaction offering, high transaction throughput offering, low gas cost offering, and extremely fast finality offering like any other token. So I think that is my bold thesis on RWAs. Cool. Okay, well, we need a prediction market or something for the four to five year thesis. We'll come back to that.
05:35:56.074 - 05:36:39.334, Speaker A: So we have about five minutes left. I'd love to kind of get a sense of what injective is working on now. Maybe some recent growth stats, anything you can kind of tease and share with the community that's coming up. Yeah. So for the past few months, I've been truly humbled by the amount of growth and the amount of net new mind share that's joined the objective ecosystem before we use it. Love keeping track of the cumulative volume that's being done on chain, but that's being done on Helix. I think Helix alone already carries God dose, like 30 billion or 31 billion, whatever trading volume on chain.
05:36:39.334 - 05:38:25.036, Speaker A: I mean, last I checked, just a few days ago there was like a 600 million transaction milestone, but I think I'm probably pretty far off at this point, given that the number of transaction count on injective is probably top ten within all the l one ecosystems and many, many more. And I think one thing that was one of the earliest kind of economic initiatives, which is the token burn has been creating an interesting subculture of economic research with 300,000 or $400,000 being burned weekly. So overall, I think, you know, it's been in a very, very kind of like, humbling and also exciting spot to kind of watch the ecosystem grow to be in a state where, like, a lot of the, kind of initial fleeting idea during a brainstorming phase of designing, like the interactive infrastructure kind of materialized and being pursued by a lot of different projects and a lot of different teams. And what's your 510 year kind of goal slash plan with injective? Where do you want to see things in the long term? God, so many. So basically, those were like brainstorms when we were first designing injective. There's obviously been a lot of brainstorming session, a lot of fleeting ideas, and I need to start taking notes on a lot of ideas I gave to various teams because a lot of them are kind of like really advanced kind of usage or leveraging of the injective quorum primitive that has yet to come into light or that has yet to materialize. So I think there's a lot of things to be done here.
05:38:25.036 - 05:40:15.574, Speaker A: And on the injective labs team side, there's been a lot of work on kind of like holistically pushing through or pushing forward on the multi VM or parallel SVM, kind of like an initiative to allow for INF, to allow for like, InevM and, you know, all the various types of vms to launch in the future, to really proliferate, to really, you know, like head to ground running, and to really kind of showcase the level of interoperability brought forth by it. And on top of that, you know, one of the biggest thing is, like, multi chain world has been extremely poorly abstracted, where only the most advanced users, or almost like developers can truly leverage it as almost like a backend process that people in the web two world oftentimes forget about. And it's time for us to basically bring kind of like a structured approach when it comes to layering and abstraction and different frameworks to allow for kind of like cross chain interoperability and multi chain interoperability to really thrive and allow for multi chain apps to stand on its own, not as like an application being powered by ecosystem, but rather, you know, the ecosystem being powered by the application and going between and allowing users to traverse through all these ecosystem from Solana to inject it to Ethereum and to, you know, perhaps even bitcoin in the blink of an eye without them even realizing. Great. Well, I have one last question for you. We have just about a minute and a half left, but do you have any advice or tips for developers that are new to injective? What's the best way for them to get started? I'm going to skip the learn rest part. I would say start off with the website injective.com
05:40:15.574 - 05:40:48.952, Speaker A: dot. It's almost like the key for you to get all the information that you want, especially on our developer section. And you'll slowly get to check out all the docs of various on chain primitives of various applications on top, or directly leverage the core chain primitives via the chain docs, et cetera. And I think that's honestly the best way to get started. You already got through a hard part of learning rust, so the easy part is really just a reading of the docs. Great. Well, hopefully many, many people here will go and check out injective.
05:40:48.952 - 05:41:09.272, Speaker A: Eric, thank you so much for joining us. It was a pleasure to get to speak with you, and thanks again for taking your time to be here with us. Cheers. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Everyone wave. We will keep you all.
05:41:09.272 - 05:41:29.184, Speaker A: Yep, I'll just step down here. Okay. Thanks a lot for this nice conversation. Mia. We could keep you on stage for the next conversation. Thank you. The next panel, we will be exploring the transformative potential, challenges and innovations driving the evolution of DPAN.
05:41:29.184 - 05:42:05.524, Speaker A: Let's welcome on stage our panelists, Jonas Hahn from Solana foundation developer Relations, Tosif Ahmed, VP of business development, IO.net, and Frank Matis, co founder, Genesis. Go. Thank you. Good to see you again. Thank you. Hello.
05:42:05.524 - 05:42:35.082, Speaker A: Making sure you're right on this one. All right. Hello again, everybody. So we're going to do another raise your hand question. Who here has heard of Dpin? Raise your hand. Okay, so maybe just to kick off, this panel is going to be all about DPIn. So it can, and one of our lovely panelists maybe just define it for the audience.
05:42:35.082 - 05:43:14.434, Speaker A: What is dpin? I take that one, please. Yeah. So, I think, you know, put in its simplest terms, DPIN is the decentralized infrastructure that powers all of, like, the apps you use, the dapps you use, the programs you use. It's basically the foundation upon which everything web3 rests. And so I realized I made a moderator mistake, and I haven't given these guys the opportunity to introduce their projects. So maybe everyone could just introduce yourself, your project, and anything else you want to touch on. Why Dpin? Feel free to go ahead.
05:43:14.434 - 05:43:40.882, Speaker A: I'm Jonas Hahn. I work for the Solana foundation in the developer relations team. And in the last year, I also focused a bit on deepen. And I think deepen is like a super broad spectrum, actually. You can define all kinds of things as deepen. You can say blockchain itself is deepen. So we built a few examples so you can, for example, connect your raspberry PI with Solana paid transaction requests.
05:43:40.882 - 05:43:59.626, Speaker A: So you scan a QR code, and then you can control like an led or build a decentralized bar or something. Or you can have all kinds of other projects, which we will probably touch on later. Awesome. So my name is Tasif Ahmed. I'm vp of business development at I O.net dot. So I O.net,
05:43:59.626 - 05:44:50.618, Speaker A: for those who don't know, is a deep end building on Solana, where we're specifically focused on GPU's. So we're a decentralized GPU clustering network where we're pulling in latent compute capacity from independent data centers, crypto projects, crypto miners, all the way to sort of consumer gpu's that exist in your PC and connect that with demand on the other side from AIML developers, startups and enterprises. And yeah, I'm Frank Mathis, co founder of Genesis Go. We built Shadow Drive, which is Solana's only native decentralized storage platform, with a focus on not sacrificing the speed performance or speed security and storage that you expect when using traditional web two cloud platforms. Great. So let's talk about some Solana specific DPin use cases. Dpin.
05:44:50.618 - 05:46:00.468, Speaker A: It's kind of been this buzzword this year. I probably first heard about it maybe nine months ago. And I feel like in the last six months even, it's become a trending thing on Google News and Twitter. What are some, you know, Solana DPin use cases that are already out there and released, and what are maybe some other ones that folks are working on that excite each of you? Yeah, I'm very excited about helium, because what it could, theoretically, if you don't know, it's a protocol where people basically put hotspots in their houses and they provide around their flats or houses, they provide mobile Internet for phones, and also a network which is called Loravan, which stands for long ranged van. So you can use these LoRawaN sensors for all kind of things. So, for example, some cities might use it to figure out if there's a fire or if there's water somewhere and some leaks and so on. And you can build all kinds of cool things with this.
05:46:00.468 - 05:46:33.000, Speaker A: And at some point, maybe I will just be able to travel around the world and just always use my helium plan instead of just painting mobile or whatever. And then there's many cool other projects, I don't know if I should list them all. I saw this year, I saw so many deep end projects like there's hivemapper, which is like decentralized mapping. Then there's like decentralized storage, there's like shadow drive, for example. I own it. It's like GPU renting and so on. But yeah, I saw so many projects where we can touch more than later, but this is one of them I'm excited about.
05:46:33.000 - 05:47:46.994, Speaker A: And things that people can just build at home. That's really cool. I think. Yeah, I think just to kind of build on top of that, I think a lot of the projects that Jonas just mentioned I absolutely love. I think helium probably has with what they're trying to do is, you know, could potentially be one of the most important companies out there because I think decentralizing wireless Internet networks is really critical for the future of Web three. But I think another one that I've been pretty interested in is building on Solana is grass protocol, which coming from my background at ionet and being really deep in the AI tech stack, I sort of think a lot about all these different ways that you can leverage deep ins to decentralize various parts of how we train and build AI models, data sort of like capture and sort of like data processing. And essentially, yeah, with what grass protocol does is like essentially take people's bandwidth that people can connect to the network and sort of like use that for data scraping and web scraping, which I think is really interesting because I think Deepin really thrives when there's the opportunity to leverage specific sort of device that people already have and use in their day to day and kind of find a different way to use that and monetize that.
05:47:46.994 - 05:48:47.044, Speaker A: I think that's sort of like sort of an underappreciated aspect of deepin and I think something that we'll kind of continue to see sort of like more development around in the future. Yeah, I agree with especially that last part that's like super huge. I mean, you know, kind of the same thing, right? Like all of the same projects that just got mentioned, you know, they're all super cool and interesting. So I think so I'll kind of zoom out a little bit because my, the things that interest me the most are things that they allow us to like decentralize, you know, kind of the stranglehold that, you know, big tech cloud has on our world. You know, they big tech. I mean, literally everything here, everything, you know, it's in your pockets. Everything, you know, we're running everything on, right? It's like 78% of it or something like that, is all in the hands of four companies, and then the remainder is in the hands of, let's say, maybe like a dozen others, all kind of waiting in the wings to get bought up by one of the big four.
05:48:47.044 - 05:50:03.598, Speaker A: And so anything in, like, the web3 space, in the d pin space, that is allowing us as individuals to take some ownership of those bytes as they're either sitting at rest or in motion, and then monetize those bites on the behalf of us as individuals is incredibly interesting to me. Yeah, I think you bring up a really good point, Frank, and this kind of made me think of another question, which it seems like, in the way that you're describing it, DPIn is almost something that it affects all of us, like, whether you're in crypto, whether you're outside of crypto. And I think even in crypto specifically, like, not everyone's going to be trading. Not everyone is going to be playing games. Like, we're not all going to be doing all of the crypto things, but with something like deepen, I guess. Why do you think it's emerging from the, you know, the crypto ecosystem in some sense, and maybe, like, what is the end goal here? Like, what is this vision? You know, very long term, I'm speaking, you know, 30 to 50 years. Like, what is that, that goal? And are we working on it now? Like, have we entered the arena? Are we, like, standing outside the arena kind of looking in? I'd love to start with.
05:50:03.598 - 05:50:34.534, Speaker A: With your take on this one. Appreciate it. So, I think so let me start with the last part of that first. So I think, you know, 30, 40, 50 years from now, web3 is gonna look, you know, completely different than it does now. We don't. I don't think anybody, you know, myself included, has any idea what that final form is actually going to look like. What we do know, right, is that what we're building now is setting the paving the way for whatever that, you know, whatever the tech evolves into.
05:50:34.534 - 05:51:29.506, Speaker A: You know, it's. I think, you know, one of the reasons why I think DPin has become much more of, like a. Just a focus for web3. You know, kind of regardless of whatever ecosystem you're building on is really twofold, you know, in 2021 and 2022, you know, there was this big, like, rush of interest for people in terms of crypto, in terms of web3 and just being like, what is this all about? And, you know, as they started to look into it as, you know, kind of like the, you know, the quote, like the new normal crowd, traditional, you know, traditional finance, traditional infrastructure. Just your average person off the street started to look into it. They saw something really cool, but they saw, you know, like, they saw the issues that kind of came with it. And those are issues that, you know, we, as crypto native individuals, we're fine with because we tolerate them in the name of decentralization.
05:51:29.506 - 05:52:33.494, Speaker A: Right. Because to us, the benefits of decentralization, centralization, you know, the trustlessness of the network, the lack of any central figure having control over us, that's extremely important. You know, for others, not so much for others. It's just a matter of, like, does it work? Does it work? Well, can I do what I need to do on it? And, you know, so I think the realization kind of happened that, let's say, like, kind of over the course of 2023 that Web three is, you know, we're building wheels, but we're building hexagonal wheels and kind of, you know, like, trying to say that they're as good as regular wheels because look at these other benefits that we get, you know, which isn't a knock on anything. That's how technology evolves. But what that did is that kicked off a conversation about what is it that we're expecting Web three and decentralized infrastructure to do for us? And I think that's the reason why, you know, we've seen such a rise in interest around deep end because it's finally starting to. The focus is finally starting to happen on, you know, okay, we built.
05:52:33.494 - 05:52:56.876, Speaker A: We built our building, you know, pretty tall, pretty fast vertically. But what kind of foundation is it sitting on? And can that foundation support the weight of everything we're trying to build? And I think, you know, the answer was maybe. And I think that's what's. That's the part of the conversation that's being addressed now, which I think is a very good thing. Very helpful thing. Yeah, cool. Yeah.
05:52:56.876 - 05:54:13.452, Speaker A: And just to kind of add on to that, I really like that analogy that Frank mentioned about sort of like, the foundation of what we're trying to build on, because that's essentially what I really kind of place deep in, like, in that. In that particular bucket, especially when it comes to crypto. So kind of going back to that question of why deepen sort of like, like, you know, started from crypto and sort of what kind of, like, crypto ideals sort of really drove it. I think the major one for me was censorship resistance with the idea of, like, when kind of block, like, bitcoin and blockchain really started kind of coming together was this idea of decentralized money and kind of putting the power back into, like, people's hands when it comes to, like, their financial freedom. And then when you kind of started to looking at, like, Ethereum and Solana and sort of you start to look at, like, decentralized compute and smart contracts and all these things, I think naturally, sort of when you kind of follow that path and, like, thought process of just like, okay, like, we're putting all these things back into the power, back into the hands of the people. Where are the other parts in this stack where, you know, like, censorship could actually happen? Like, because you could really think about, like, bitcoin, you know, like, fundamentally is, you know, it's worrisome for. For a lot of people with a lot of power and a lot to lose, and you start to think about, where can they.
05:54:13.452 - 05:55:01.976, Speaker A: If they really wanted to throttle it, where could they do it? And I think you could really just say it's like, oh, they could censor the Internet, which is fundamentally just a bunch of information on pipes in the ground. So it's kind of starting to think about, okay, how do we start to make that aspect of the stack censorship resistant and deeper kind of comes and plays a huge role in that for me. Yeah, that's a good point. What I really love about Deepin is that it's actually solving real problems. And it is usually things that you can touch. For example, the hyphen thing, it solves the problem that you go on Google Map and everything is blurry and old and data from a few years ago and in hivemapper, it refreshes data every few minutes. When a taxi drives around there and has a hyper buck cam in there or with shadow drive, you can, like, save data on Shane.
05:55:01.976 - 05:55:24.836, Speaker A: Or at the last breakpoint conference, for example, there was someone who built a decentralized vending machine. So he, like, 3D printed a bunch of parts. He put a QR code on it. Savannah pay Qr code. You scan it, you pay, like, I don't know, five USDC on your phone. The thing rotates, and you get a pack of cards or something. I think to me, this is, like, things that could be really revolutionary, especially in the future.
05:55:24.836 - 05:56:10.624, Speaker A: Like, maybe we have, like, vending machines everywhere where you just have people fill them up themselves, put QR codes on it. And, I mean, maybe you need to look at the health of the products in there, but if it's just like things like toys or something, I think this would be cool. So I think this is like solving real problems, and I'm very excited about that. So I guess, speaking of real problems, one of you had kind of mentioned just the fact that the Internet is mostly run by four or five different companies and this just, you know, massive centralization problem. That's probably why all of us work in this space. And, you know, we saw Facebook rebrand to meta in order to appeal to this kind of Internet native generation. I want to ask about, you know, legacy companies.
05:56:10.624 - 05:57:10.506, Speaker A: Let's say they're interested in deepen. Will they turn their centralized systems into, you know, DPin products or do they have to start from scratch? Like how. How will that work? I know many, you know, legacy projects now have web3 divisions. Is this an onboarding opportunity? Can they take what we're building and sort of plug into it, or how does that work? And I know that's a big question, but maybe we can break that down a little bit to just understand how we can think about very established companies using what we're building or the ideas or the tech behind it at least. So I think that the cause, to your point, there's a lot to unpack there, but you got to start with the why legacy companies, web two companies, they have to have a reason. And that reason isn't. Well, it's decentralized.
05:57:10.506 - 05:57:33.822, Speaker A: That reason isn't. Well, the power is in the hands of the individuals. That reason has to be. Here is how it makes your business better. Here is how it makes your life easier. That's where I go back to the hexagonal wheels analogy, onboarding them in terms of taking what they're doing and moving it onto web3. That's just a tech question.
05:57:33.822 - 05:57:58.234, Speaker A: That's easy. You know, relatively speaking, that's easy. Yes, it takes time. It takes effort and everything like that to make that transition. But you know what those steps are. But you got to ask, why do they, why would they care? And that's one of the, I think, foundational questions that a lot of deep end projects are starting to work on. And we did, I've seen from Ionet the same thing.
05:57:58.234 - 05:58:58.854, Speaker A: It's, you know, okay, I need to have a really solid pitch where I can talk to you about, like, you know, this is going to cut your expenses significantly. And why is it going to do that? Well, it's because the infrastructure is being run by individual people, but it's still providing you the same level of performance. It's still providing the same level of security and stability. And those three things, you know, like those are tickets to play. Those aren't things that we can say like it's, you know, like a nice to have. But I think, you know, the more that we have a focus on thinking about the benefits for onboarding these users, like true benefits that go beyond like kind of the nebulous, like decentralized or censorship resistant or this, that or the other, because those are, those are edge cases for businesses. The more success we're going to see bringing those people, bringing those companies on, being able to tell them, you know, the benefit to Web 3D pin is that, you know, each individual person is running, you know, running a portion of this program on their computer or on their phone.
05:58:58.854 - 05:59:33.894, Speaker A: And because of that, it's happening at a much, much cheaper price point, which means you can save, you know, x percent on expenses per year and this is going to allow you to do x, y, z with your business. Those are the things that, like, those are things that are going to entice Web two businesses. The question of how we do as, and the question of, you know, like what steps need to be taken to get them onboarded again, that's, that's the easy stuff. That's not a motivator. Yeah. Just to, just to add on to that. I think, you know, with centralization and decentralization, it's sort of, you know, I'm not a maxi on either side.
05:59:33.894 - 06:00:36.522, Speaker A: I think there's sort of like an equilibrium that we'll eventually reach in terms of like centralized entities and decentralized solutions. And sort of there'll probably be certain use cases and specific customer segments that are better served by decentralized products and services, which is some, that'll always need some kind of centralized provider to actually do what they need to do. So I think there's always going to be room for both in terms of whether I think incumbent web two centralized provider will start to move into web3. Deep in, yeah, I agree with Frank that these web two companies are honestly, any company is at the end of the day they're profit driven. They have to make returns for shareholders and that's what they're trying to maximize there. And at the end of the day, they're going to approach it as a business decision. And is this an investment worth making over? Was trying to maximize centralization.
06:00:36.522 - 06:01:36.358, Speaker A: So I spent a decent amount of time thinking about this, especially in the context of what we do at Ionet and Ionet to kind of, not to like, show here, but basically we're trying to solve sort of like a GPU supply shortage, right? And like, that's just kind of the nature of the market right now. But with every shortage at some point that will ease up and we'll kind of get back to some sort of equilibrium there and likely sort of, you know, more supply than demand at a certain point. And I can kind of see a world in which, even though we sort of compete with the AWS and Google clouds of the world, technically today, if those centralized competitors actually start to have latent compute capacity there, there's a world in which, you know, they can start to plug that latent capacity into deep ins, start getting utilization out of it while, you know, waiting for the next customer who needs their centralized service to come in and use it. So I think there's kind of equilibrium and balance that we can strike there. Yeah, good point. Yeah. I'm a bit skeptical.
06:01:36.358 - 06:02:41.952, Speaker A: From my experience, companies that are big and old, they don't like change. So I was working for ten years in the games company, and at every Christmas party, I was going to the CEO and I was saying like, hey, should we not do something with crypto? And usually it was like, no, it's too risky, or we don't want to do it for whatever reason. So what could happen, maybe rather, is that many of these companies get disrupted by things that come new, like Google Maps, maybe by Hivemapper, or like Chaga is like a gaming streaming, decentralized platform. Maybe they also use ion, I'm not sure, but they might disrupt gaming platforms where you buy the games, because now you can just stream them online somewhere, or decentralized storage could interrupt, disrupt Dropbox, for example, or whatever. So I think this is maybe more likely, or maybe both happens, or maybe they notice someone is coming and then they just buy them or whatever, if they have enough money. But maybe then they are already strong enough to not want to be bought. So I don't know.
06:02:41.952 - 06:03:22.494, Speaker A: I think currently it's like a huge opportunity for everyone to build something in this space because, yeah, you can disrupt stuff with that because things won't be possible before now that are possible on Solana. Yeah, I think that's a really good reminder of the. Yeah, why does this matter? And, you know, I think the average person probably doesn't care. Like you mentioned about decentralization, privacy. You know, people care about entertainment and making money or saving money and things like that. So we've been chatting about deepin kind of this big wide angle lens. I'd like to go in a bit now, narrow the scope of what we're talking about.
06:03:22.494 - 06:04:29.074, Speaker A: There was a panel earlier today on data storage and Bobbi from Coingecko kind of had this anecdote of when you're putting data on chain and it's not getting used, what is the point? That's kind of a waste of a lot of resources. So let's talk about, about kind of advantages and disadvantages within on chain, off chain or maybe a hybrid data storage model within DPIn. What's your take on that one? And we'll start with Frank. So I'll just say that while I can appreciate the perspective, I think I completely disagree with the take that just because data is not being used that it's a waste of resources. You know, that's what I mean, that's what arctic storage is for, right? It's like it's cheap, super, you know, super cost effective storage that is rarely ever going to get accessed. But that storage has to be there, right? Those records, those, you know, the data has to be there. You know, if you lose all of the, all of the data that you're using in, you know, quote, like, you know, your hot storage, like the storage you're actively using, like you need to have some somewhere.
06:04:29.074 - 06:05:49.346, Speaker A: And so, but I think, you know, the, the theme that's driving that comment speaks to where we're at in web3 in the sense that, you know, again, right now we're building the stepping stones that are going to get us to what the future state actually looks like. And building this, you know, when you're running the stepping stones, it's usually not resource efficient. It's usually hard, right, which is, I mean, any innovation is hard. So, you know, I think as I think about like on chain versus off chain and hybrid models, I think, you know, there is, becomes a question of like, are we deliberately building in the right direction or in a specific direction for a specific reason? Because I think, you know, especially over the past years, we've seen Dpin evolve. You've seen a lot of, a lot of projects that they built their infrastructure and, and they did it in a very rigid kind of way, in a way that doesn't allow them to adapt or evolve or change as new technologies come available, as additional stepping stones are laid. And they basically, in order to keep up or stay relevant, they have to fall back on using some type of off chain solution. And you see that a lot of times because it's just a function of, you know, the progress that we're making.
06:05:49.346 - 06:07:02.694, Speaker A: We're moving extremely fast. So it's not a bad thing. It's actually a very good thing because it says, like, you know, okay, we're continuing to make forward progress. I think, you know, speaking broadly, what we'll like, what we'll see is we'll see, you know, this, this shift over time where we'll start to see more and more hybrid models evolve out of necessity as we continue to develop the technology. But I think, you know, it's a question of what is it that you're putting off chain versus on chain? And is that stuff that's off chain? How important is that? If it were, if it were to get lost or censored or, you know, altered by a bad actor? Is that something like, what can you point to on chain that says, like, no, no, it's fine, because look here, this allows us to rebuild all of that, right? You know, ideally, I think, you know, like, when you think about technology and its continued movement towards efficiency, I think we'll end up in a world where everything ends up actually on chain when we get 1020 years down the future or down the road. But right now, what you're just seeing is, you know, utilization of existing tech to allow us to continue to innovate for the future. Very well said.
06:07:02.694 - 06:07:46.878, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'll just add, I think Frank pretty much covered the whole storage aspect of it, and I think he's kind of the expert on that. So I'll kind of come at it from sort of like a compute perspective. Like on chain was his option to compute, which is kind of what we're looking at. I think it really depends on, like, there's pros and cons to both. Right. And it really depends on what you're trying to accomplish, I think, in the world that, you know, I live in. And it's specifically, I kind of think about on chain and off chain compute when it comes to sort of like artificial intelligence models and, like training and things like that, there's certain aspects of, you know, like training AI models and sort of how you use them where it really makes more sense to, you know, do a lot of off chain computation, like, you know, like centralized computation.
06:07:46.878 - 06:08:56.664, Speaker A: Because if you're going to train like a $70 billion, 70 billion parameter AI model, if you want to do that on chain, that's going going to be exceedingly expensive and really slow and might not actually lead to the results you want. And you might want to think about why am I actually doing this on chain? But there might be other processes that comes in AI model compute where you actually might want that computation to occur on chain. For example, inference and lower level computations, you might want that to happen on chain to have a proof of inference or proof of certain model usage. Or when it comes to data provenance and royalty rights and making sure that the correct data owners are compensated, that might be something like a transaction that you want to happen on chain, and you might want to facilitate it that way. So I think it really comes down to the use case of what you're trying to accomplish. Yeah, I wanted to agree with Frank on the data that's not heavily used, actually, because if you have a backup, for example, you almost never use it, but when you need it, then you really need it. Another example for the on chain, off chain thing is, like, I work a lot with nfTs.
06:08:56.664 - 06:09:31.260, Speaker A: There's this thing, if you have the off chain data which is saved to the JSON file somewhere in decentralized storage, and then you have the on chain data. But if you like, let's, for example, you have a game and you want to save the level of the game in the NFT, and you want to change the metadata. And the metadata is off chain. Then you can't do it in a program because you need to somehow upload new data to the off chain storage. And this is always asynchronous, so you can't use it on chain. So now with the newer token extensions, metadata extension, for example, you can have data that is directly saved on chain. So I think in this case it's very valuable.
06:09:31.260 - 06:09:57.384, Speaker A: But of course, it's way more expensive to save it in there. So what you can also do is instead of saving it in a state, you can save data in the ledger of the blockchain. Then you can't immediately read it, but you can always get the data back by looking at the logs of all the transactions that saved the data. And then the next step is to upload it somewhere to a decentralized storage. Okay. Yeah, obviously there's so much to unpack here. I mean, Deepin, I think it's.
06:09:57.384 - 06:10:16.954, Speaker A: Some people think it's already a buzzword. I don't think it's even gotten the traction that it probably will get. I think we're in for. You guys are in for a pretty crazy ride these next couple of years. But I'd like to end. We have about two minutes left, and it would be great to kind of go down the line and obviously, Solana community. Lots of developers here.
06:10:16.954 - 06:10:52.644, Speaker A: What are some killer Solana d pin apps that you all want to see in the next couple of years? You're probably too busy to build them yourselves. So maybe we'll start with you, Jonas. And, yeah, what do you want to see out there? I want to see more stuff that people built themselves. So where they have a raspberry PI, they connect it to the blockchain somehow. They have some websocket connection that listens to account changes, and then they listen to Loravan sensors. Like, for example, you have, like, a parking sensor somewhere. The car drives over and you have a flap and flick and a nap that, oh, there's a parking spot there, or you have, like, a parcel which has, like, a Loravan sensor in it.
06:10:52.644 - 06:11:14.080, Speaker A: And you don't have to stay at home all the time because, you know, okay, the package is coming closer to me. I better stay home. And then I go shopping so I don't miss my package and have to drive to the post box. It happens in Germany all the time to me, by the way. So I would love this do it yourself stuff. And, yeah, I leave the big projects to you guys. Yeah, I love that.
06:11:14.080 - 06:11:53.284, Speaker A: I think for me, like, the holy grail of Deepin is fundamentally building. I'd love to see someone build a decentralized Internet. I think that's kind of what a lot of this is really building towards. And I think what Genesis go and what Ioannett are building are essentially fundamental building blocks to get us to that point. And I think that's for us to be able to actually all connect to each other without having to, depending on a centralized provider or authority, I think will be really, really key going forward with Solana being the home of deep in and the best place to build it. I think we'll likely see it happen here. Yeah, yeah.
06:11:53.284 - 06:12:31.508, Speaker A: What you were talking about, decentralized Internet. It's like what we did yesterday with networking people's phones together. People will see that's a stepping, that is like a big stepping stone towards mobile powered, decentralized Internet. But I think for me, as I think about that question, I think, you know, I want to see something that we, like, none of us have, like, none of us are thinking about. Right? Like, if I. If we're throwing out ideas up here, like, the only reason why we haven't dove on it is because working on other things, somebody's working on it. Like, I want to see what I would love to see from my.
06:12:31.508 - 06:13:04.792, Speaker A: From builders like, you know, you all is something we haven't thought of, something that nobody's thought of. You know, what's like, what's a problem that. That nobody's really looking at, but actually is a big problem that needs to be solved? I think the next cool thing coming from Solana deepen should be something that no one sees coming or something that people currently think it's impossible. For example, decentralized power grid or something. Many people think it's not possible because there's so much power in their power providers. But maybe someone can build it. Don't know until you try, right? That's what I want to see.
06:13:04.792 - 06:13:21.046, Speaker A: Let's try. Yeah. Everything is possible. Next year at crossroads, let's see what people made possible. There's still so much to unpack and talk about. Unfortunately, we are at time. But thank you to each of you for being here and sharing your insights with everyone.
06:13:21.046 - 06:14:13.824, Speaker A: I think it was a really inspiring chat, and it was a pleasure being up here with each of you. Thanks for having us. Thanks, everyone. With that, let's dive straight into our next fireside chat on the dream crypto wallet. And let's join once again Vidor Genzel, co founder of Soulflare, as he shares his vision and insights on crafting the ultimate crypto wallet experience. And moderating the chat is our own George Harrop. Thank you very much.
06:14:13.824 - 06:14:31.484, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. You're gonna be far from me. Yeah, I know. We're kind of like. Let's move over a canyon here. Hello.
06:14:31.484 - 06:14:44.056, Speaker A: Did I mess up this? We can go over here. That's fine. We can be chilling around the table. Hi, Vido. How you doing? Hey, George. Istanbul. It's been great.
06:14:44.056 - 06:14:49.834, Speaker A: Yeah. Yes. Excellent. Thanks for having us. This is. This is beyond my wildest imagination. Of course.
06:14:49.834 - 06:15:14.974, Speaker A: Of course. Well, look, we're really happy to have you and all of the Soulflare team, if you haven't already. Go and check out the soulflare booth downstairs. There's like, a million people crowding around it to try and do stuff, so definitely go and check it out. But. So the title of this section is building the Dream Wallet. And Celflair has been one of the OG wallets in Solana for many years now.
06:15:14.974 - 06:16:01.964, Speaker A: So we're just going to have a chat about what it's like building a wallet, maybe to start for people sort of not familiar. I guess there's probably, in this crowd, there's a lot of people that maybe their first interaction with crypto was through a centralized exchange, an email, and a password. And having an actual non custody wallet is a completely different story. Right. So maybe you can step us through, like, how did you get started with soulflare? What's the growth story been like? And, yeah, sort of step us through the last couple of years with the craziness going on in bull markets and bear markets. Yeah, definitely. So maybe a longer rewind, but me and the team that's close to me, we've been working on dominantly non EVM blockchains for over seven years.
06:16:01.964 - 06:16:20.886, Speaker A: It's a long time. That's a long time for non EVM blockchains. It's a long time for ethos as well. Yeah. So. And we basically were, like, exploring new performing technologies, and we came to Solana, like, late 2019, early 2020. There was nothing there.
06:16:20.886 - 06:16:44.490, Speaker A: Solana was below a dollar. It was just like this, like, cool idea with a proof of concept, almost. That's when it was. It was just another coin. And the thousands of coins out there with a sea of things and a lot of promises of, yeah, we can scale, we can do something, blah, blah. It's just all words. And obviously, our thinking was that the way to communicate and interface with a blockchain wasn't black terminal.
06:16:44.490 - 06:17:24.570, Speaker A: Maybe some of our, or maybe some of the developers would prefer that. But if this Solana was to reach more critical mass, we decided, let's build Solana's first wallet in early 2020. That's how soltr became. And back then as well, we had the solit. Solit IO. People out there that are ogs probably remember that one, but that was kind of like one of the wallets that a lot of people were using back in the day. So we didn't really have actual properly constructed and user interface design and extensions that actually work and are nice.
06:17:24.570 - 06:17:57.994, Speaker A: And I guess Solflower was one of the first iterations of that. Solflare's first version actually was a web wallet, right? So it was sort of a copy of Myether wallet. We wanted to have this interface to quickly, like, look at your balance, send some tokens. And staking was also pretty big at the beginning. I think at some point, like, at the beginning beginning, more than 70% of Solana circulating supply was staked through solflare, okay. Which we weren't aware of until we wrote some scripts, figured it out. And it was a startling revelation that, oh, shit, this is.
06:17:57.994 - 06:18:20.584, Speaker A: Wow, this is real. People want a wallet. People want a wallet. Amazing. And then later we proceeded to build all other platforms, such as mobile, such as a browser extension, which is sort of, like, the de facto standard for today's wallets, but I don't think it's a de facto standard for future wallets. We'll get into that in a moment. I think maybe I want to talk about the challenges of growing a wallet.
06:18:20.584 - 06:19:20.976, Speaker A: But when we say a wallet, we got to keep in mind this is the fundamental building block of everything, all the things that we're talking about, all of these different dapps that were on stage, often in cryptoland and in Solana land. It starts with a wallet address. It starts with a non custodial wallet where you own your own keys, you're clicking, connecting wallet up the top, and you're connecting your wallet, and now you can interact with the world. So maybe just sort of walk us through what are some of the challenges in as a, maybe as a company, as a founder, as just someone in the Solana community with building, like, a top class wallet? Yeah. So, as you said, when people figure out about Solana, the first thing that they need to do, if they're not doing it on a centralized exchange, is get a wallet. I would say we hold a lot of responsibility where people come on, and if they have a bad experience, they will not stay. So we need to think deeply about user experience.
06:19:20.976 - 06:20:22.078, Speaker A: But not only that, we also need to think deeply about, are we fulfilling all of the users needs? Will they be able to do all the things that they've intended to do when they came to the wallet? If we fail, even if you like, merry Christmas, small mistake. We sort of lose that user, and I think that's not good enough for the overall growth of crypto and especially Solana. Obviously, self custody is not easy to explain. You probably all heard terms like, not your keys, not your funds, and if you lose your keys, they're gone forever. This concept of this, like, final custody is, like, really foreign and needs some time to be digested. If you really lose that little piece of information, the password that you're on board with, your money is gone. So we put in a lot of education around that, how to back it up properly, and how to even use some of the more advanced methods of self custody, like hardware wallets.
06:20:22.078 - 06:21:08.694, Speaker A: So you can write down your twelve word seed free, or you can even use a little ledger or keystone device that is able to safely custody those funds. They're still under your custody, but let's say, adds one more layer of security to the whole process. In terms of other things that have been hard when scaling and growing is, especially in recent times, there's a lot of new stuff coming up, new NFT standards, new protocols, support for everything and everyone wants everything supported. All of the new token types and hybrid nfts and 404s. It's almost like a race to support them all. But our users ask for it, so we do it. We do everything for our users.
06:21:08.694 - 06:21:42.854, Speaker A: Basically, that's what you have to do. What you said there about it being the first interface into the Solana world, and if it's not done right, people just, just leave. I think. I don't know if it was you that we were having a chat or whether I saw the stat recently somewhere on Twitter. But like a really large percentage of users, their only interaction with web3 stuff is kind of just through the wallet. They don't really, because one of the problems, I guess, is discovering what all of the other apps are that are out there and what they can do. So I guess getting the wallet right is super critical.
06:21:42.854 - 06:22:33.104, Speaker A: That's exactly right. So the stat is around 50% of funded wallets never connect to adapt. There you go. That's a good one. Wow. So what they usually do is they on ramp, buy some crypto, use the wallet to stake their soul, use maybe some of the funds that they bought to like trade coins, buy soul, sell sol trading activities, look at their nfts that they've received on conferences like that, or maybe some other events, maybe sell them. But it's still, I would say, like, even despite wallets being perceived as like, these explorers and browsers to web3, there's still this piece of software that users use to look at their funds, send their funds and not to explore web3.
06:22:33.104 - 06:22:53.764, Speaker A: I mean, I need to admit that, like explorer, exploring web3 is sometimes scary. There's a lot of scams, there's a lot of spam. You can easily lose your funds. So we are putting safeguards in place to try to save those users, for them to not do something stupid or irresponsible. Stupid, no. Irresponsible, maybe. Yeah.
06:22:53.764 - 06:23:33.264, Speaker A: One of the important things when you manage your own funds as well is what happens if the wallet blows up tomorrow and disappears. And we saw that with solit as well, right, is like the website went down. Technically, yes, you could back up your words and then you could import them into a wallet like solflare, and it would work and great if you did that. Amazing. But I think one of the important things is having a sustainable business model. So I want to talk about like a business model for a wallet. Like, how do you think about that? Because if people are managing their own coins, you can't, like, get them to pay you some money, right? Like, usually if you go to a bank, I mean, they have your money, and then they can just deduct from it.
06:23:33.264 - 06:24:18.044, Speaker A: Right? But if you own your keys, no one can do that. So how do you build a business around that? As a bank, not only can you take or basically deduct from the user's money, can also deposit it into somewhere that makes you money even more, far more than you would charge the user. So essentially, solver, at its core, is a free product. Anyone can use it for free. Anyone can use Sol, anyone can access its features for free. Similar to banks, but not saying when you do some currency exchange, what we do is we route your order to multiple places. Jupiter market makers basically try to get the best quote for the exchange that you want to do, and then we take something a few on top of that spread.
06:24:18.044 - 06:24:45.008, Speaker A: Staking is pretty popular in Solana. So there's a software validator of which. Very popular. Very popular. An interesting fact is that part of the revenue from the software validator, we actually used to fund special types of transactions, jitto bundles, to be more specific, which enhances the probability of the transaction landing. So we had sort of some congestion. Solana had some congestion issues in the past year, months.
06:24:45.008 - 06:25:31.078, Speaker A: And that was one of the ways how software users had a much more, like, better experience in transacting on Solana. Yeah, I mean, I think I saw you on Twitter talking about, was it like, you did some optimizations on the RPC side as well, and, like, doing everything you can? Because if I'm doing a transaction, whatever project, it is, like, I'm always dealing with my wallet. So it's kind of like, it always comes back to the wallet to try and, like, solve that problem of Solana was very congested. We had, you know, a lot of transactions going on. And, yes, there was, you know, a lot of the transactions weren't going onto the chain and blah, blah, blah. But it was on you guys that then, I guess. What was it like? Was it damage control? Were you, like, not sleeping? Was it going on? Maybe that would be a more romantic story.
06:25:31.078 - 06:25:49.450, Speaker A: Okay. But when we were prepping our infrastructure for the Jupiter launch, we. We sort of had this idea that something like this might happen. So we implemented our solution back then. I think it was, like, end of January. Yep. And then in recent times, when actually we've seen some of the congestion, it worked perfectly.
06:25:49.450 - 06:27:03.464, Speaker A: And the lending rates in software, I think from the data that we gathered, far surpassed any other wallet. Amazing. Yeah, well, that's all about investing in things that improve the lives of your users. Just to add, we sort of had the luxury of being able to sit and think about how we're going to do stuff because our sole focus is on Solana. We're not doing multiple chains or multiple products. I think the fact that we're focusing only on making the best Solana experience for our users benefits, so that in these times, we can be very proactive and already have some systems in place that would yield the best user experience. Yeah, well, why is that as well, that you're just focused on Solana? Because I often meet people at conferences that come up to you and they're like, oh, why aren't you on this channel doing that chain or something like that? I mean, why is it that you are maybe just not even interested in doing that? So I think we've noticed some of Solana's benefits back in 2019, and we worked on a lot of blockchains, seen that transaction fees, consensus mechanism, and all of that throughput is all of that is, like, very different from what we've seen before.
06:27:03.464 - 06:28:08.098, Speaker A: It sort of made sense to make this bet, although this bet wasn't as apparent sometimes last year. But we decided, okay, let's double down. We don't want to dilute our focus, do multiple blockchains, because we really hold the belief that solfly, solflare and Solana, or basically Solana has the capability to be the underpinning of this, like, future and coming financial system. And instead of sort of diluting our efforts and, like, implementing five other blockchains of potentially, like, different maturity levels, different stability levels, looking at the common, like, lowest common denominator of features, we're looking to, like, drill, like, really deep into Solana and bring everything that Solana can offer to our users. Yeah, it's about being really good at one thing versus mediocre at many, I think that's a good thing to focus on. So we spoke a little bit about backups and non custodial stuff. And some wallets have solutions, like social recoveries or maybe they're more centralized in these different things.
06:28:08.098 - 06:28:38.204, Speaker A: And maybe talking to users about how to back up their wallet can be difficult, especially if it's the first time. It's like when you're first setting up your wallet. Don't forget these words. You know, you can use these words to redeem your money at any time in the future. Is that an easy process? Is there better ways? Like, or is that going to be with us for, you know, the next few years in this whole sort of 1224 words thing. Yeah. So we are very, we're maximalists of self custody.
06:28:38.204 - 06:29:25.084, Speaker A: We're not necessarily crypto maximalists, because I think crypto maximalism sometimes does more harm than good. And I think if we are now trying to discuss is writing down twelve words on a piece of paper hard, I don't think we as a whole civilization will get so far. And that shouldn't. I think that's not the core of the issue. The core of the issue is, let's see how this can be best presented. Because if you just tell someone, hey, don't lose this, you're gonna lose your funds, maybe that, like, doesn't hold enough, like that sentence, like, doesn't hold enough power. It needs to be much more apparent and obviously needs to have like, many stages depending on the amount of funds you have in your wallet.
06:29:25.084 - 06:30:45.764, Speaker A: These, like, social logins are finer and are definitely a good sort of middle ground in terms of transitioning layer to like, full self custody. They obviously come with their trade offs if you want to be the final owner of these assets, I think like self custody and either holding your keys with yourself or in a hardware wallet, there's, there's no other thing. We've seen some, like, good examples also with, like, new technologies such as, like passkeys or, or account abstraction, smart wallets, those are still tech that has to prove itself at the end of the day. Yeah, amazing. And I think one of the things which solflare does really well is hardware wallet support as well. So was that always a focus for you guys? Or is it sort of a question of working with the right teams that have the right infrastructure? Because it seems like having a browser extension or a mobile app, it, look, that's, that's one way to secure your money, but having a physical device that no one can ever move your money, nobody can scam you or, you know, you click a wrong link or something like that to do something, like, as long as you have that device, no one can, can do anything with you. So how do you look at maybe new integrations of hardware wallets or just hardware wallets in general? Yeah.
06:30:45.764 - 06:31:48.410, Speaker A: So I think that was one of the, the most counterintuitive decisions that we made early on. I think even the first 1st version of solflare was ledger first, and not like mnemonic phrase first. That reasoning stemmed from our presence in crypto for a long time and our understanding of crypto and self custody and why it was counter intuitive, because if you look at the amount of people that have a hardware wallet is much less than people who want to interact with crypto. So if we would have looked at the numbers saying, like, okay, 1% of our users are using hardware wallets, let's not prioritize hardware wallets. I think some of our best, most active users and ambassadors actually were users that we gave a really secure and powerful experience using hardware wallets. Supports ledger on both mobile and extension. The Bluetooth implementation on mobile was very hard to do.
06:31:48.410 - 06:32:14.446, Speaker A: Yeah, I can imagine. Now it works really nice. And also we support this novel new hardware wallet called Keystone. Keystone is camera based, so you don't need to plug it in. You can just scan QR codes on both ends. It works really nice. What makes me happy is that we see groundbreaking stuff in terms of the hardware wallets, especially.
06:32:14.446 - 06:33:08.142, Speaker A: More recently, some telco providers announced that SIM cards have the capability to generate and store private keys. Smart cards, as your credit cards, have the capabilities to generate, store private keys. And we're going to see self custody more and more evolve, but not necessarily writing down your keys, but maybe in your credit card or your SIM card, which is, I think, a whole new paradigm to be explored. Yeah, maybe it's not a problem, per se, of people need to manage these keys and what if they lose it? And maybe it'll just fade into the background over time where, okay, if your credit card has a private key generator, then you can, can rely on that. But I also want to talk about. So yesterday I had a call with Anatoly on stage here and we were talking about mobile and mobile, very important thing. We had the saga.
06:33:08.142 - 06:33:22.458, Speaker A: We had the saga. Two. I think it's over 100,000 units. Maybe it's 200,000 units now. Solflare has a mobile wallet. So tell us about that. Like, how does that, in terms of maybe focus for you and the team? Are you excited about mobile? Do you think they.
06:33:22.458 - 06:33:58.334, Speaker A: There's more things that can be done on mobile? So we have a mobile app. We had it since first break point. It was November 2021 when we launched. We've seen huge amounts of traction on mobile and we've seen the whole world evolve towards mobile. And the behavior of users is becoming more and more mobile centric. Most people here have probably used mobile because there was, like, claiming of nfts and stuff downstairs. Yeah, that's also probably you could have claimed an NFT using your mobile because you can scan a QR code.
06:33:58.334 - 06:35:03.100, Speaker A: I think mobile apps aren't going anywhere. And I think those ecosystems, although a bit gated, are going here and stay. While on the other hand, if we think about how wallets work in a web context, like, I personally don't think that browser extensions are going to be the future of wallets. So it's up to us and the industry to figure out how we can do a non disjointed, not broken flow for interfacing with dapps and managing your funds on your laptop or your desktop computer in terms of activity and the amount of, like some like, trivial metrics, like number of staking, swaps, transfers, mobile users are much more, much more active. Really? Oh, that's interesting. Why do you think that is? Are they? I don't know if you guys have the stats or just have a feel, but is that because they're more involved in, I think, nfts, probably they're more sort of mobile focused or. Yeah, I don't know.
06:35:03.100 - 06:35:53.044, Speaker A: What do you think's behind that? We don't have many data, much data on this, but we see some, like, emerging markets be really active on mobile, which makes me really happy because they are using crypto for what I personally think crypto is supposed to be used for, and not just tools, tools for speculation. So emerging markets are really big on mobile because we optimize software to have a small app size, not be really like, data consuming. So I guess people recognize that and use Solfare as their world of choice. Yeah, absolutely. No, I think that's where we need to be. We're running up on time here, but maybe just some thoughts on the future of solflare. What are you excited about? And that can be for solflare or just in general in Solana.
06:35:53.044 - 06:36:24.114, Speaker A: Yeah. So what makes me really happy is that I, like, vividly remember this industry seven or eight years ago. I also vividly remember when we started software in 2020. And I also see all the things that are happening now, and all of these are like worlds of difference. Infrastructure is maturing. There's a much more, much bigger amount of user centric apps. And we know that it's still hard to get started, but that will get fixed.
06:36:24.114 - 06:37:07.312, Speaker A: Fixed. And we think that, I mean, I think that crypto will and self custody will reach massive scale in the coming years. For solflower specifically, our users are always our number one priority. And when you're building a wallet, your number 1 second, number one priority is security. So we always prepare, prioritize security. Like, we run a tight ship, we take our stuff seriously. And does that affect the development process? Because I guess one of the important things with running a wallet is because you're literally at the bottom of the stack in terms of everything else depends on it.
06:37:07.312 - 06:37:31.504, Speaker A: If there's a problem at the wallet level, that's really bad. Right. So maybe that limits the frequency of which you can put out new updates or you have to, like, double, triple, quadruple check everything. Yes. The release process, especially on many platforms, is quite painful. Everything needs to be tested multiple times. We cannot break an experience for existing users, and we need to make sure that we didn't introduce any new bugs.
06:37:31.504 - 06:38:18.386, Speaker A: Sometimes running like a website is easy. Just, you just deploy. But knowing that your software holds keys that hold tens of billions of dollars, I mean, you shed some sweat sometimes. Do you lose sleep at night? Yeah, not really, because we know stuff is secure, but it definitely brings on a huge responsibility. And that makes me happy seeing how the ecosystem evolves. And in terms of solflare, focusing on security features, focusing on seasonal trading features, and at the end of the day, what I previously told putting Solana and Solflare's user base to use so we can get to more noble crypto use cases. Yeah, yeah.
06:38:18.386 - 06:39:03.670, Speaker A: I mean, just quickly, do you think some of the future developments people talk about in Solana, like fire dancer or maybe more things like the deep end stuff going on, do you think that will positively affect what you guys are doing at the wallet level? I think all these new versions, new software that's being built, client diversity will help the network health massively, which also then affects our users. Their transactions are landing faster. They have a better experience. They see how cheap it is to send money to interact with dapps, use some on chain financial products. Deep in, like you buy a camera, you get some tokens, some other deep in protocols as well. So I'm pretty bullish on, on the future of Solana and what it will bring. I love it.
06:39:03.670 - 06:39:26.274, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much for your time today, Vidor. For anyone out there, if you haven't already, go down to the soulflare booth, go and check it out. And in general, if you're watching on the livestream, just go and check out and get a soulflare wallet. It's an amazing wallet. It's actually my daily usage. I use both the hardware wallet, the keystone version, the ledger version, the mobile version, the extension version. Everything solved.
06:39:26.274 - 06:40:06.704, Speaker A: Yeah. Go and check it out. But thank you so much for your time. Thanks, George. Cheers for having me. Thank you very much. Yeah, George, I will have you on stage back again for moderating the next panel and next panel will be featuring Tom Short and Mario Cubotario from Camino and Mark Brennan, Pete from Marginfi.
06:40:06.704 - 06:40:54.648, Speaker A: Join us, please, as these experts delve into the intricacies of the lending protocols, liquidity provision and leveraging strategies within the crypto space. So let's have a warm welcome with a huge round applause for our guests. Thank you, GM. What's up, guys? What's up? What's up? Well, I would say gamino and Gimagin as well. I don't know how they're going to translate that, but that's basically what we say in cryptoland. Wow. Ok.
06:40:54.648 - 06:41:15.124, Speaker A: We're talking about lending now. I am back, and this is going to be an exciting one. Lending is one of, I guess, the critical defi apps out there. So we have the best people in the industry with us today. So maybe brief intros first and then we'll get stuck into it. So who should we go for? We'll go Thomas. Yeah.
06:41:15.124 - 06:41:26.412, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. Hi, I'm Thomas, the non technical co founder of Camino. So covering a lot of the commercial side of things. Great to be here in Istanbul. Thanks for hosting it. I've been coming here for 20 years. Oh, wow.
06:41:26.412 - 06:41:33.596, Speaker A: So, love the city. Yeah. You're a local then? Yeah. Hochbalduk and that's it. Love it, love it. Next. Yeah.
06:41:33.596 - 06:41:45.782, Speaker A: Marius. Yeah. I'm Maru. I'm the technical co founder of Camino. I think about stress about security all the time. I stress about security. You lose sleep at night.
06:41:45.782 - 06:41:57.806, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Thank you for organizing. Nice to be here. Awesome. Mac, what's going on? Mac Brennan, co founder of Margin Fight. Nice to see all. I was actually.
06:41:57.806 - 06:42:19.574, Speaker A: It was really cool to see a bunch of people, like, locals wearing translators. Like, listening in the audience. Like, that was. That was really awesome to see because, like, sometimes I just see a lot of, like, english dominated crypto and. Yeah, I think we're, like, very much building for, like your past panel said, like, emerging markets. So it was like. It was awesome to see that.
06:42:19.574 - 06:42:35.824, Speaker A: Absolutely, man. We got 300 more translators in the house today than yesterday, and we're in a country with 30 million crypto users. So it's amazing. But maybe I'll start. Start firstly with the Camino bros. So token launch recently, I kind of have to mention that. Right.
06:42:35.824 - 06:43:08.584, Speaker A: So you're happy with that in terms of sort of smoothness and everything seemed to go really well. What's your thoughts on things after that? Yeah, I think the technical release, kudos to Marius, went very smoothly. So that all went well. Of course. Launching in, you know, the day of red was an interesting one, but I think it's nice to get it out there, back on product. Took a lot of time and energy out of your day. Thinking about the token pushing it out there, I'm sure Mac is probably aware of.
06:43:08.584 - 06:43:36.086, Speaker A: And then, yeah, now it's back to building different products, pushing forward. I think that's the exciting part. That's why we all came here as well. So it's nice to have that whole hurdle past us. It's done out the window and now we can, we can carry on. You know, one of the things someone, I think it was someone said on Twitter is once you have a token, what? Maybe it was you, Mac, or maybe it was someone else was saying like, once you have a token, it's. You're the, you're a token, you're no longer like a product and a protocol.
06:43:36.086 - 06:43:55.434, Speaker A: I guess it's step. We've seen that a little bit, but I guess you guys are completely focused on the product now. It's. It's back to basics. It's focusing on that. Yeah, token is kind of an enabler for that. Yeah, I mean, the token eventually will play a key, more and more key part in the whole ecosystem, but it's sort of a gradual process that takes time.
06:43:55.434 - 06:44:27.694, Speaker A: As the products evolve, as the integration of the token within the ecosystem evolves, all of this will sort of slowly fit into place. So, yeah, it'll be a fun evolution to watch. But they're kind of that big hurdle of when token, when this and that. Having that out of the way is always fun. It is a really good thing to have that out of the way. Marius, any comments on the launch on the tech side seemed pretty smooth. I guess this was post congestion, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah, it was post congestion.
06:44:27.694 - 06:44:59.282, Speaker A: We had to deal with congestion issues before that. A lot of effort there. I think it's kind of like an open secret now how to get it done. A lot of people have been talking on Twitter, it looks smooth. I'm happy it felt smooth. There was a lot of effort and chaos in the team, but I'm happy that people couldn't tell that. I am just very pleased to have so many people back to product and not worry about token.
06:44:59.282 - 06:45:28.580, Speaker A: Amazing. Amazing. And Mac, you were on a panel yesterday, I was listening and you were talking a little bit about the future of marginfi as well and sort of what the plans are. Maybe one of the people in the audience are on the live stream, like maybe reiterate sort of what's next for you guys. Yep. So like the condensed version is there's three main work streams at Marginfi. There's the protocol level work stream, there's the application level work stream, and then there's the developer ecosystem work stream.
06:45:28.580 - 06:46:10.708, Speaker A: So at the protocol call layer we have marginal and live. Now YBX strapped up its its second audit and we'll start targeting its launch this month and then we'll follow that soon after. It'll be this year with what we're calling cryptos, like first, integrated stable swap, margin swap. Those three products will share the same liquidity, the same risk, the same UX. It'll be like a very composable just foundation for anyone to use as a user or as a developer. We're up to like 15 teams on the developer front, like working with Margin Phi and just, it's liquidity foundation, it's user based foundation, it's risk foundation. And then at the application layer, we're doing a lot of stuff at the mobile layer.
06:46:10.708 - 06:46:44.200, Speaker A: So you can already sign into Marginfi with just your email account. Not even owning any crypto before, you can already have Marginfi as a PWA, a progressive web app on your phone. So you can just go to our browser and download it onto your phone and use it without even owning a crypto wallet at all. And we're going to make that more and more native and natural and more of like a fintech app for people all around the world. That's a good point you make about mobile. I'm curious what you guys think about. On the last panel with Vidor, we were talking about mobile and how it's important for wallets, I guess, for.
06:46:44.200 - 06:47:21.528, Speaker A: So my take is complex things are complex, right. And Defi protocols are complex things. Are they? That's the first question. And then the second question is, is a complex thing suitable for a little screen like this? And should we, should we be building that or are there simpler ways that we can do things? Maybe I'll start with Thomas. Yeah, I mean, I guess for such complexity, I use my laptop for most of the time, I have to admit. Clearly there's a huge demand for everyone to use these types of products on mobile. And I think, as Vidor said, the more that's being used on mobile, it does power real use cases, I think.
06:47:21.528 - 06:48:17.154, Speaker A: Yeah, as you said, defi protocols are inherently complex, particularly in Camino. We have this massive underlying technical capability that sort of goes everywhere. But I think if you can abstract that to a simple ux that looks easy to understand on a mobile interface or any desktop interface, I think that's a really valuable thing to strive for. But I think, yeah, there's no way of getting around it that once you enter into the crypto world, the fact that it's not just a bank and there's a whole bunch more underneath it, there is natural complexity to the underlying product. It just depends how well you abstract that and or how much is necessary to. Yeah, Mario, I think you shouldn't try to make it, try to lose things in the translation. The moment you can oversimplify, and when you oversimplify, you can lose some very important elements.
06:48:17.154 - 06:49:11.640, Speaker A: I guess I can see a world where smart contract or some DeFi protocol can be your savings account, I guess. But we need years and years of, you know, no defaults or no bad debt or proven unexploitable smart contracts. Until that can actually should be simplified and people should feel they can trust it, because through simple ux, you make it appealing to someone that is not defi savvy. And I don't think we're there yet. I think the DeFi savvy people should be able to absorb the complexity, and that sort of complexity filter filters away people that should not be using the app. Yeah. So I don't think we're there yet.
06:49:11.640 - 06:49:29.860, Speaker A: I mean, I would love to be. I mean, just building a product, you have to be an optimistic person. I just think that will take some time. I don't think we're there yet, although I would love to believe in it at some point. Yeah. Mac, what's your take on mobile? Are we there yet? Still a long way to go. Got approved.
06:49:29.860 - 06:49:56.512, Speaker A: Trust, all this kind of stuff. Yeah, I think it's a bit of, like, all the above. Defi is you're your own risk manager when you enter the realm of Defi. And so you need to make some critical decisions yourself in terms of. Of the protocols you use and how they're handling risk. And that is just not something that you can expect everyone to know day one. There's actually very.
06:49:56.512 - 06:50:48.544, Speaker A: It's like a very small audience that can fill those shoes, but you can also. Then you can ask really great questions, and you can also just understand the fundamental differences between lending protocol versus, like, an amm versus, like, a, you know, perps protocol or whatever. And there's. There's trade offs you can make there if you're coming to margin phi and you're just lending in USDC and earning 10% yield, not even borrowing. I do see that a lot of synergies there with like just going to like a money market or like a checking account or something like that. If you're starting to borrow, you're starting to take on liquidation risk. And obviously there's a lot of questions around how the protocol handles risk as well, which I think is important.
06:50:48.544 - 06:51:37.158, Speaker A: But yeah, so for those passive users that are lenders, first, I think a mobile experience on marginify is great. If you're doing more complex things, you just need to understand your own risk manager. Yeah, I think an important part point here that I put down is, like, how people use it and how are you seeing people interact with your lending protocol? So maybe it's just they're staking USDC and they never take a loan. Or maybe it's people that are trying to get leverage on things and they're trying to multiply up the leverage multiple times. Or maybe they're just trying to lend against their exotics. Or I guess you could look at that, maybe collateral ratios versus borrow and debt ratios and. Well, if there's not many people borrowing, but there's a ton of people collateralizing things and kind of means that everyone's just sort of there to get some yield.
06:51:37.158 - 06:52:40.466, Speaker A: Like, how do you think your users usually interact with your protocols and maybe. Thomas? Yeah, I think you see a massive range of different use cases. I think overwhelmingly it's people who just want to earn extra yield on tokens that they're long on. Of course, taking extra leverage, that is, taking extra debt and borrowing against them does require a little bit more sophistication than just leaving it to sit there. So I think you see a wide variety of different use cases, right, from people just wanting to go a little bit further along on Sol, or wanting to run some kind of more complex arbitrage strategy between even different lending markets. So there's a whole variety of different use cases, I think, where the kind of simplicity factor comes in that's different to a bank. Is that the way the protocol manages risk and monitors liquidations and risk and so on? I think that is a very crucial thing that just by kind of nakedly supplying USDC, you might not be aware of how much you're exposed to that element.
06:52:40.466 - 06:53:15.160, Speaker A: So we try to make it very clear in Camino about all the different risk factors and how you can monitor all the different dashboards that highlight all the different scenarios that could happen and make it very clear that this is a live action defi website. It's not just a set and forget place, necessarily. So I think you have a big variety of different use cases, and we just try and make it as easy to use but as detailed and as clear as possible from all the other metrics. So we spend a lot of time building our RISC dashboard and all those documents. Yeah. Maybe. A question for Marius, the risk front, that's obviously something that you guys put a lot of work into.
06:53:15.160 - 06:54:05.242, Speaker A: And I guess when you're building products, you have to think of it in terms of it's not just the smart contract which you're building. It might be the oracle goes bad or something like that. Okay, that's someone else's problem, but it will affect your product at the end of the day. So I guess when you're building things, are you also thinking of external factors? What happens if the chain stops? What happens if congestion is really high and I can't get my transfer through? Or like, what are the things that you're thinking of when you're, when you're building at a protocol level? Yes, all of those things. I think Oracle smart contract, front end goes down, risk is bad, configs are wrong. Everything can go wrong. Yeah, but the longer your life, you know, these things get stress tested.
06:54:05.242 - 06:54:49.174, Speaker A: And when you have a system and there's pressure, you know, in the system, then the weak spots start cracking. And with every single stress test or a mini stress test, it doesn't have to be a public stress test or something. We identify elements that we need to improve and we have a good feedback loop in the team. Every single time we do something, there's almost always a checklist and a post follow up checklist of things. So our backlog constantly gets refilled with post follow ups, post action points, things after every single event, every single incident. We just. We always try to be diligent about these things.
06:54:49.174 - 06:55:13.104, Speaker A: We have also recurring recurring processes of rechecking code, rewriting new tests, reinspecting configs. You just. It can just. It can work, you know, but you shouldn't forget about it if it works. Yeah, I mean, it's. There's just. There's just.
06:55:13.104 - 06:55:38.214, Speaker A: We have seen way too many bad things happening in crypto, and I'm naturally a paranoid person, so I. It just. I get woken up, shaken by things, so we just double check all the things and it slows down our progress. But we have good engineers. Yeah, absolutely. Paranoia is probably an understatement. So it's good.
06:55:38.214 - 06:56:27.414, Speaker A: Always good to hear from a lender. One question here I have is about differentiation for lenders, right. For those unaware out there, I think the original killer use case for crypto DeFi lending protocols is you can get a loan right now without having to ask anyone permission. So when you get a loan from a bank, you have to sign up forms and all sorts of nonsense. Who are you? How much money? How's your job going? All this kind of stuff with a DeFi lender, there's none of that. So that was like the original, I think, use case that I was most interested in, in. But I'm curious, maybe, Mac, like, how do you think that lenders can differentiate on the product side beyond just, hey, I have a bunch of tokens here you can borrow and lend, or maybe that's good enough, and maybe you just focus on doing one thing really well.
06:56:27.414 - 06:57:23.106, Speaker A: What's your take? Yeah, so there's like two things. There's like a massive blank space with just borrow lending and the optimizations you can make there. So you can become like a really, just like, you could, you know, provide different collateral weights based on the assets you're holding, or you can do, you can ship a bunch of, like, nuanced features that help you manage risk on top of your, like, borrow lending vehicle. We're, we're doing that, but we're also, we're really focused on, okay, now you have this, like, leverage, now you have like, this liquidity that you can use to lend in or yield from borrowers, and also to borrow what's like a more step function thing you could do with it. And so that's where a lot of our protocol level advancements are coming from. So, like, now you have a bunch of lsts, you're lending into Marginfi. Why can't you mint yield accruing stable coin against it? And that's YBX, that's going to be coming out this month.
06:57:23.106 - 06:58:17.044, Speaker A: Or now you have a bunch of liquidity across stable coins like USDC, USDT, YBX, as well as LSTs like Jitosol, RLST, which is called LST, marinade, sol, et cetera. Why can't you swap between these and utilize these liquidity to, you know, move from one asset to the other? And that's margin swap. That's, that's like our integrated stable swap. So that's like, that's like those step function things are kind of what we're really focused on because, like, you can find borrow lens all over crypto in a variety of products. They all have different risk parameters and they're all integrated in different ways. But I think it's really just like, what are you doing with it? There's another example, there's a purpose protocol in Solana called drift that has an embedded borrow len. That's to give leverage when people are going long on a perp on drift.
06:58:17.044 - 06:58:47.016, Speaker A: It's built for different purposes. That's sort of how we see it at marginal. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Interesting. I think another one that I'm curious about is the prevalence of oracles for lenders as well and some people. So I think it was, was it sharkey or some of the NFT lenders, they have the p two p lending thing where essentially one wallet lends to another wallet and then there's no need for an oracle because there's a contract between them and they both agree at the rate of payment and blah, blah, blah.
06:58:47.016 - 06:59:36.876, Speaker A: So cool. Okay. That means that there's no sort of oracle to go and blow up tomorrow and then everyone freaks out. Right. But how do you guys sort of measure that risk? Or think about that risk? Or are there protections that you can build into the lenders as well? Or what kind of protections have you guys sort of built into the product to maybe mitigate third party risks, things like oracles and stuff like that? Anyone can take a question. First of all, with Sharkey, you are the oracle, essentially the person lending or borrowing that they think, okay, is this rate or is this two weeks term good enough? Can it drop and that will drop too much such that I will be, I will have lend more than the value. So you are the oracle? Yeah.
06:59:36.876 - 07:00:29.714, Speaker A: So all of, at the end of the day, this is a very old financial primitive. I lend someone that someone is maybe the custodian or is not, and that person finds borrowers and needs to make sure that those borrowers have enough collateral. It's a very old primitive and you can remove parts when you remove a part. You have to choose a different trade off. You just have to pick trade offs when you do it. Like this is an opinionated version, peer to peer is one way of implementing, but at the end of the day you just have to borrow against something or you have to lend something and you have to determine the value of that thing. Like you mentioned, when you go to a bank, you have to sign and they have to check because maybe the thing that you are collateralizing with is very easy liquid.
07:00:29.714 - 07:00:55.846, Speaker A: So they need to make sure that your salary is liquid enough and it will cover. But in crypto it's much simpler because everything is very fungible. So Sol is known and it's very, very tradable. So there are a lot of risks are eliminated. Yeah. So then the question is, how do you determine the value of something? And the value of something is the value that buyers and sellers are willing to give for it. There's no other real way to do it.
07:00:55.846 - 07:01:34.214, Speaker A: I mean, you can, but, yeah, at the end of the day, you just have to trust at what value it is trading and eliminate anomalies and try to do some smoothing, make sure you don't get some scam weeks. But at the end of the day, you don't know when something is trading down. You don't know if it's a fake wick or if it's a falling knife. So you just have to ensure that even when that sort of thing happens, you'll be safe. And you're always going to be probabilistically safe. You're never going to be 100% safe. If you want to be 100% safe, you have take no risk.
07:01:34.214 - 07:02:31.348, Speaker A: So it's difficult. I think the only thing you can do is to rely on historical performance of these providers. So we're always going to be much more resilient onboarding a new oracle provider than relying on someone who's been doing it flawlessly for years, or maybe they haven't done it flawlessly for years and you need to know what to prepare for. So I think there was a debate, actually, between Marginfi and Soland last year, and Solon has been through much, much more than us, and they know that sometimes pity is not reliable and pith will give you a wide confidence interval. So these are things that happen once in a while. They're black swans, and if you haven't gone through it, you don't know it. So you just fire, huh? Trial by fire.
07:02:31.348 - 07:03:28.150, Speaker A: Yeah, you have to. Sometimes you just have to have the fire under you and then, you know, now you know. Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's like you can't fail critically when these things happen, so you need to have enough buffer for a lot of bad things happening and a lot of tolerance so that you can be safe when they occur, but you'll never be safe, basically. And I think, as Mark Zeller said, it doesn't matter if you've done anything until you've liquidated something. And I think that's the ultimate test of these ending markets, insolvency and the ability to liquidate and thus price all of the assets in there. And so we've spent over three years building on Solana, but two years, plus building our own internal oracle infrastructure, which allows us to get the best of all these different worlds and build in reliability to how we see price feeds and how we manage risk according to the price, which is really the be all and end all of a lot of this kind of security and risk management.
07:03:28.150 - 07:04:46.064, Speaker A: You need to have proper modeling and then proper infrastructure to be able to effectively price that modeling, and that's something which we've spent a huge amount of time doing, and that's why we've had so far relatively robust and well managed liquidations and kind of solvency. Yeah, yeah, I think one question for Mac. I want to talk about lsts, which you've mentioned a bit before. I think marginfi run a validator, right? And, you know, both of you guys integrate lsts in various ways into the product, and there's cool ways to get leverage on Solana staking as well. You know, you can have an LST, it has an embedded yield, and then you borrow, say, sol, and then you put it back into LST and you do it again. How important has LST's been to either you guys? TVL, you know, your borrows, your, the key metrics that you guys are tracking and how do you see that going forward? Yeah, so there's a ton of, there's a ton of stake Solana, but only about like four or 5% of it is in liquid staking tokens. For comparison, on Ethereum, I think like 40% of staked Ethereum is in liquid staking tokens.
07:04:46.064 - 07:05:42.964, Speaker A: So we're talking about billions and billions of dollars of inflows into Defi. If we can sort of unlock this vanilla stake that's just staking without any sort of like receipt token essentially for it into lsts that can be used across defi. Why do you think that is? I mean, people might say, well, on Ethereum, there's literally like one stake pool which matters, and that's lido, whereas on Solana, much more decentralized, we have a lot. Is that a feature or a bug? Yeah, so I think that's a. I think that's a massive feature. So marginal fire was also, I think marginal fire was like the first, like, protocol level liquid staking token when we launched LST last year as well, which there was a ton of demand for, like the quickly went up to like 80 million in Tbl from like late last year, and just stakes down margin validators. LST is also like the highest naturally yielding liquid staking token in Solana.
07:05:42.964 - 07:06:38.380, Speaker A: Because we optimize our validators, we take zero commission, we take zero LST fees, and it earns Mev and runs the Jito Solana client. And then what happened is a team called sanctum sort of, like, took this idea and ran with it, and now is allowing anyone to. That I'm also an angel and very supportive, and now they're allowing anyone to sort of, like, take lsts and sort of, like, do it for their own protocol, like drift launch one, and, like, a million protocols launch one. I know Helios launched one. I'm very focused on unlocking this. Billions of dollars of lock, staked, locked stake into stake that's usable across Defi. And I think the reason it hasn't happened yet is because there was just a lot of, like, early Solana investors and, like, people who were sort of, like, restricted in using their stake across defi, that now those restrictions have sort of lifted.
07:06:38.380 - 07:07:10.232, Speaker A: Like, Solana has been old enough where they can start to do stuff with it. The first thing they're looking to do is they don't want to sell, you know, $10 million of Solana and incur this, like, massive tax burden. They want to put it into, like, margin, fine, borrow USDC against it, pay, like, there's no, no taxes then. And then just go on their merry way. Right? Use it across defi, take it off, off chain, and, like, pay some credit card bills with it or whatever. So, yeah, so jitosol, marinade, soul, LST. We just added a bunch of sanctum lsts to marginfi as well.
07:07:10.232 - 07:07:30.184, Speaker A: So, like, jup soul and I can't even name like a bunch. There's a lot. Yeah, they're all, you can all put them into marginify. You can all use them in marginify. And we're, and we're working really hard on the risk front to allow people to be able to borrow against these as well and for them to be, like, really suitable forms of collateral. Yeah, yeah. Amazing.
07:07:30.184 - 07:08:19.390, Speaker A: We're coming up on time very soon. I just want to touch on quickly how you guys think about growth and the types of users that are using lenders. And I guess previously there's been talk about, well, institutions might be big sources of TVL, or maybe it's lst it lending is a big source of TBL, or maybe it's adding alts and getting all of those communities on board and getting people to do stuff there. What do you think is the most useful avenue to pursue in terms of increasing the number of users, number of transactions, TVL, all the important metrics that you guys care about? Yeah, I think it's really all of the above in terms of terms of what the. I wish I could answer target market on an exam. I wish I could just answer, like, all of the above, a, B and C. All of them I'll get.
07:08:19.390 - 07:08:46.720, Speaker A: Well, I think. I think it's just two different time horizons. I think when you. The actual institutional adoption of DeFi at scale, you know, at real scale, is going to take a lot longer. There's a huge amount still of, you know, legal hurdles to pass over when they think about smart contract risk and inherently, on the protocol side, you know, how Lindy takes effect. You saw with Aave trying to build the Aave arc, the pro version seems there's a lot of. It still hits a lot of roadblocks.
07:08:46.720 - 07:09:34.814, Speaker A: So I think the way that a lot of these general counsels at these hedge funds that have huge amounts of crypto to deploy into defi still think about it, is quite risk off. And you see even these massive custodians, these institutional custodians of copper and firebox and so on, holding, you know, huge amounts of assets, but not a lot of that has translated to actual lending activity on chain. Yeah. And so I think there will be this kind of back and forth process as to how it can be really compliant, but also safe to unlock that huge market. And I think that's obviously a massive market. And, you know, clearly it's something which we're looking at and, you know, and talking to various people about, but it's. The other side is these users as well, you know, as a multitude, you know, across the world at smaller scale.
07:09:34.814 - 07:10:04.462, Speaker A: That's why it's all of the above. You can kind of do both, which is a bigger market. It's, you know, both come with their own individual nuances that just over time will be. Will be solved, I think. Yeah, you did. You did mention Abe there, and sort of they went down the path of they incorporated some entity somewhere to get a license to try and get more institutional. I don't know how that's worked, worked out, but, yeah, I wonder if that's like the path forward or if lsts or anything like that, or if it's a compliance problem fundamentally, sort of like you're saying.
07:10:04.462 - 07:10:44.858, Speaker A: Yeah, I think like a lot of the compliance officers at these big funds get scared when they think about smart contract risk being put on there. And so I think that's like one blocker, and there are some interesting solutions to think about in that area around, you know, ways to get around that, which we're looking at. But, yeah, it's one of those ones that will. Will take a little bit of time. I think the LSTs is an interesting example Mac was talking about with how unlocking all of that LST is actually quite a curious collateral type for Defi. It seems so obvious, but actually still, in times of market peril, these are actually not that liquid. Having them as collateral does carry a lot of risk.
07:10:44.858 - 07:11:19.852, Speaker A: Building products based on them entirely does carry a lot of risk. But the premise of unlocking in the good times, a lot of liquidity and kind of flexibility is great, but as ending protocols, you basically have to spend your entire time planning for the worst day because that one day knocks everything out. And so that's why you have to remain really cognizant and thoughtful about these kind of risks. Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you so much for your insights and thoughts. Guys, we're at time, if anyone hasn't already, definitely go and talk to these peeps.
07:11:19.852 - 07:12:01.494, Speaker A: I mean, they all run like billion dollar actually. Who cares about dollars? Sol defi projects, whatever it is, go and have a chat with them. Go and test out the products, both Camino and marginfi. But yeah, thanks so much for coming today. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Hey, thank you very much for this talk.
07:12:01.494 - 07:12:27.110, Speaker A: And now we are heading to our next live talk presented by David Taylor, CEO of iterfuse. And David comes with over 20 years of developing software and creating products, and he is here to talk about the future of real world assets on Solana. Thank you, David. Thank you. Everyone can hear me. All right. It's my first time in Istanbul.
07:12:27.110 - 07:12:58.426, Speaker A: Super happy to be here. I knew you guys were smart and I knew this was beautiful place. So happy to verify that in real life. I'm from a relatively new startup called Etherfuse. We've been around doing stuff for quite some time, but we did a lot of regulatory work the first two years to get permission to do what I'm about to talk about. And so luckily, we have our product out and released and we can talk about it freely and you guys can actually visit app dot ethfuse.com and experience it for yourself.
07:12:58.426 - 07:13:47.146, Speaker A: So thanks for being here and I'm excited to tell you about what we're about to do. So I want to talk about bonds and a product that we came up with called the stable bond. But first, I want to kind of talk about some of our philosophy of, like, where we're at with the blockchain and how things work. So the blockchain, in our opinion, is not an evolution in technology. So my co founder and I, we both come from a startup studio. We've developed a few other startups, and one of the startups we worked on is a payments company in the United States that sends money from one person to the next. And when you really get down into the details of payments and how they work in a modern way, it's very archaic, and sending money from one person to the next, it's bloated, there's a lot of people in the middle, and it's really slow.
07:13:47.146 - 07:14:18.062, Speaker A: So anyone who makes payments fast is taking something from you. So when you look at the blockchain, it is an evolution. It is not an evolution. It is a giant leap in better. It's the quickest way to send money from one person to the next, even if you're working on some of these slow chains. So starting with that, how things work on the blockchain is a significant step better. It's a huge leap forward, and whenever we're operating with a huge leap forward forward, we have an opportunity to mess up.
07:14:18.062 - 07:15:00.154, Speaker A: So one comparison I would look at is humanity landing on the moon in the seventies or sixties. I wasn't alive, so I don't know. But, you know, we made it to the moon, we had all this effort behind us, and then we fumbled the ball and we haven't been back. And so with the blockchain, I really feel like we have to be careful with how we implement and how we exercise this opportunity so we don't fumble the ball. Blockchain, ultimately, is the freedom for us to transact with one another without a middleman. There's this huge chasm in between modern finance and the blockchain and how we work, how we work today. So we need to close this gap and there's a lot of work to do.
07:15:00.154 - 07:15:39.572, Speaker A: You know, when we're talking to people downstairs and I say, hey, do you know what a bond is? A lot of people don't know, or they say, can I have one? Then we have to teach them how a wallet works. And so when we're integrating with new people or onboarding new people, there's a lot to bring people up to speed with. So there's a lot of work to do. So crossing this chasm is kind of one thing I want to talk about first. It's going to be a series of leaps, a series of steps, and we have to be careful to do this and navigate these correctly. So I would say the first step that we made progressively and in a positive way was the step of stablecoins. Stablecoins seem to have product market fit.
07:15:39.572 - 07:16:22.152, Speaker A: We have other stuff like artwork that's been okay, you know, has fit pretty well. Meme coins had a temporary splash, but stablecoins, especially when you go down the street, you look at an OTC, you can walk in and give somebody some tether, and they give you fiat back. I think it's proven that there's a real utility here. A lot of remittances, a lot of things like this are really showing value and sending money across borders. Stable coins have shown utility. So I want to introduce what I believe is the next step is stable bonds. So we have a way to transact, to send money from one to another, but there's really not a real safe way to save your money on the blockchain.
07:16:22.152 - 07:17:12.504, Speaker A: If you look back in history, if you look back in the middle ages, a lot of the nations that grew and developed, they primarily grew because they invented or adopted the interface of the bond, which was finding a revenue stream and selling a share into that. Unfortunately, with crypto, we've kind of gone currency first or token first, which primarily is a mechanism for two people who don't know or trust each other to interact. So the bond is a stronger interface to take something that, hey, we know and trust this resource, we can believe in it, and we can build something on top of it. So I'm going to introduce to you the stable bonds. We are regulated and based out of Mexico City. We've worked with the government of Mexico for the last two years to tokenize assets. So debts, equities, ETF's, commodities.
07:17:12.504 - 07:17:57.458, Speaker A: We've launched back at breakpoint in November with mexican cedes. But we've started to align ourselves to offer bonds and other rwas from all over the world. So if you go down to our booth, there's a card there, and you can scan, and I will give you a free bond. This is a mexican cetace, so it's government debt. What's interesting about this bond is if you tried to do that without us, it would cost you a minimum of $10 million to establish established account at a brokerage and able to start buying mexican cetes. If you wanted to get it some other way, you'd have to go through like a mutual fund or something like that. But we can directly give you access in any amount, the smallest unit of pesos, and to get a bond, and I'll give you one for free.
07:17:57.458 - 07:18:44.100, Speaker A: So go downstairs. If nobody's there, reach around the desk, pull a card out from the back, and scan it with your wallet, solflare wallet or decaf wallet or phantom wallet, and grab one, steal it from me. I'm happy for you to do it. But we've offered brazilian bonds, we have us treasuries, EU bonds, and mexican debt, and the next six months we'll offer over 3000 products. So we are integrated directly into the mexican stock exchange, so you'll be able to make orders. We have deep, deep liquidity, meaning if we don't have the immediate liquidity, you can create a purchase order and we can rely on the mexican economy to fulfill that order for you. A bond interaction with us operates probably exactly how you would think it is.
07:18:44.100 - 07:19:49.090, Speaker A: It's not, I mean, it was hard to execute upon, but it works pretty simply. We establish an account or brokerage or relationship in a place that has a relationship with the government who will sell debt. So we have some demands where we need immediate liquidity that we can depend on, and we buy that debt for you, so you can come to us and you can request some debt, and we will issue you a token, and we will add that debt into our book entry system 100%, and we will have our custodian manage that. So our custodians are well known brokerages. So in Mexico we have people like BBVa Oknivir, which is the biggest brokerage in the world, or cuspit, who does our stock exchange interaction, and we are establishing places in Switzerland, and we have some in Spain as well too. So we're growing, we're establishing a presence around the world to do this. And you can come to us and our interactions will be you give us your par value, or your balance, or your primary interest, or your primary payment, and we will issue you a token.
07:19:49.090 - 07:20:20.704, Speaker A: And as you hold that token token, it rebases. So as you hold that token every week, right now, weekly, we take that principal interest, that principal value and that interest, and we rebase it. So it's a compounding interest product. And when you're ready to sell, you can divest, we will issue a sell and you will get your total value and your interest. So this is how we operate. It kind of makes sense if you just think about it. We kept it simple, so we have a piece of PWA, we also have a platform right now, so go check it out.
07:20:20.704 - 07:20:53.126, Speaker A: If you've KYC'd, which we're required to do, it takes maybe two minutes. And to purchase a bond now it takes under 30 seconds, so check it out, go grab one. But you can get a bond really quickly. The minimum is the minimum of that bond product. So if it's a mexican product, the minimum is a pesos. If it's a USB product like our us short term treasuries, it's a dollar. And we for the most part offer these to anybody who isn't on some list for bad behavior or a us person.
07:20:53.126 - 07:21:18.826, Speaker A: So unfortunately we put all those people together, so we offer it to anyone in the world. We don't require you to have a certain amount of wealth. We really want to bring these to the people who need them most. So the world's safest product, go check it out. If you look at the current state, I took this from marginfi a long time ago. I think things are doing better. But if you look at the current state of crypto investments, apys are pretty low, not doing so well.
07:21:18.826 - 07:21:56.434, Speaker A: They're probably doing better now since I took this two months ago or something. But our Mexican say days, it's BBB plus rated bond backed by the government and it returns the user 9.5%. So there's a lot of things you're doing in DeFi right now where you're taking on risk to get six or 7% even staking, which is pretty great. I think it's eight right now. I can give you 9% in a currency that's the top performing currency last year, backed by the government. So it's not gonna. It's unlikely to fail where in our defi ecosystem things fail quite often, but we're getting better.
07:21:56.434 - 07:22:29.044, Speaker A: So we offer relatively high yields in emerging markets. So if you were ever looking to diversify or move yourself out of maybe a US denominated, we have those for you. Or if you're looking to get out of non us denominated investments, we have the US treasury for you as well. Our fixed income products are from all over the world. This is just an example of some of the things we get from Mexico and the high yields we get. So these are very, very safe products and very, very high yield products. And in an economy that's growing.
07:22:29.044 - 07:23:05.300, Speaker A: So Mexico as an example, is the 12th biggest economy right now and is projected to grow quite a bit. That being said, if you don't like Latin America investments, we have us and EU products too, and we're adding up to 3000 over the next few months. So check it out, try it out. I think this is the next stage of things that need to happen. I would say safe, stable debt and accessibility to the rest of the world. I do want to talk about Solana specifically a little bit here. So when we released in November, we didn't have token extensions, they hadn't either passed audit or weren't released.
07:23:05.300 - 07:23:58.820, Speaker A: So we designed how bonds should work ourselves, and we designed them to work exactly like how bonds work in the real world. So we would create a token and we would list a bond and you would mint a token, you would wait for maturity, so you could have a 30 day, a ten year, or a week, and at that end of maturity we would give you your principal and par interest. The issue with that is a lot of Defi doesn't work that way. A lot of people like to hope to hold their funds and have it grow without doing anything. One of the common feedbacks we kept getting from people is I'm tired of reinvesting, I don't want to do it. And so we took that to heart and token extensions came out. And now our tokens are, our bonds operate a lot like liquid staking tokens, where the interest accumulates and as you're holding, the investment grows.
07:23:58.820 - 07:24:35.200, Speaker A: So it's a compounding interest mechanism. So you can buy more or buy less or divest or invest. However, you don't have to do much, you just make the decision at one point in time, and things work behind the scenes for you. And token extensions has really enabled us to do that. So I believe, I know a lot of people have kind of implemented token extensions. I feel we're one of the few teams who are really using the utility of it behind it, and none of the negative utility. So we don't do all of our tokens, they're freely transferable, so you can trade them, they're ready for Defi, you can spend them, you can do whatever you want.
07:24:35.200 - 07:25:09.956, Speaker A: We don't use any sort of limiting extension, we just use the ability to update the APY based on the market at the time of maturity. That enables you to do as little as possible and just watch your investment grow. So token extensions for us, they enable crypto investments in a crypto way. You know, if you look at the bond market today in the modern world, only one and a half to two, 2% of the general public owned bonds. And I think that's because nobody wants to have to rebuy bonds. If you go to treasury direct, you have to remember they've expired. I'm going to reinvest.
07:25:09.956 - 07:25:51.610, Speaker A: And so crypto has really enabled us to offer an interface that's better than it is in the real world. You can invest in bonds any amount you want very quickly, and they work in a friendly way. This roadmap has actually just got flipped a little bit. We introduced stable bonds we've added us and EU bonds. We're working with wallet partners right now to do similar features as bond back banking. So we want to extend our SDKs. If you are a wallet provider or app developer or a DeFi provider or you're building anything on Solana, we do have an SDK for you where you can issue this debt and you can create a relationship with us and you can build products on top of.
07:25:51.610 - 07:26:19.918, Speaker A: Most of the modern world is built on bonds and so we want to create that for you. I do have probably some alpha. We are releasing the mexican pesos that's pegged with our sates, our stable bonds. So we are partnering up with Brel, which is a multi chain stablecoin issuer, to offer this pesos. And that's next week. We had projected to do that in November and so it's moving pretty quickly. And we do have a product that's a native crypto bond company coming out next year.
07:26:19.918 - 07:26:33.838, Speaker A: So we're excited for that too. I'm etherfuse. We're relatively new. Come talk to us. We are downstairs. Hit us up on Telegram, which etherfuse there too. Hit us up on Twitter.
07:26:33.838 - 07:27:29.300, Speaker A: We want to talk to you and start to grow a little more. And we can offer you some safe products that have none of the unfortunate restrictions that are required by a lot of our peers. Thank you very much. Thank you, David, for sharing your insights. And with that, let's welcome on stage Michael Wagner, co founder of Star Atlas, and he's a very visionary leader. Behind star Atlas, Michael has spearheaded the development of a revolutionary AAA gaming experience built on a Solana blockchain. And star Atlas transcends traditional gaming paradigms, offering players a high fidelity, immersive space adventure coupled with elements of grand strategy.
07:27:29.300 - 07:27:42.744, Speaker A: Let's welcome on stage Michael Wagner. Thank you. All right. Yeah. Thank you very much. I appreciate the warm welcome. Hello, everyone.
07:27:42.744 - 07:28:02.764, Speaker A: Merhaba. It's my first time here in Istanbul as well. And I have to say it's an absolute pleasure to be presenting here today, really for a couple of reasons. One, we have this intensely passionate local community. I do want to shout out, coexist. Yeah. Phoenix dac.
07:28:02.764 - 07:28:35.078, Speaker A: And I want to make a special mention to one of our community members, community leaders. Lumina. I hope you're doing well, man. Wishing you the best. But the second thing that really excites me about Istanbul and Turkey in particular is that we see time and time again that the appetite for gaming here is just absolutely massive and there's incredible potential. So I'm really excited to be providing some updates on state of game development for Star Atlas. And I'll be doing that by running through a few of our different product verticals.
07:28:35.078 - 07:29:20.784, Speaker A: So I'm going to be starting with our aaa open world space exploration MMO that's built in Unreal Engine five. Then we'll be transitioning over to what we call sage star Atlas golden era. This is a fully on chain, real time strategy MMO. And then finally, we're going to be wrapping up with some updates on our mobile development. And mobile is a fitness trainer app and our spin on the move to earn segment of the industry. Now, as I go through this, and actually if it's possible, if I can see the next slide on one of these screens, that would be helpful. But as we go through this and as we kick this off, I just want to heat things up with a little video here that's showcasing what we're going to be showing through the rest of the presentation.
07:29:20.784 - 07:30:25.920, Speaker A: When we dream of space, we dream of transcendence. We dream what we might become. I think what Star Atlas was rendering is a cosmos in which we can explore, in which we have agency. We finally get to go into galactic. Yeah. Okay. So people see content like that on screen and we actually heard it even here today.
07:30:25.920 - 07:30:57.378, Speaker A: We have a booth downstairs. We've had the client loaded on a couple of gaming PCs. But a comment that I get and a question that I get often is, well, that looks really cool. But when is star Atlas actually going to be playable? And the answer to that is really simple. It's actually live and playable right now. We've been on the epic Games store since 2022. I will say this is a closed access beta, but if you're interested in what you see during the presentation today, you can jump into our discord, ask for a game key.
07:30:57.378 - 07:31:25.462, Speaker A: We will get you access to the game. And we are currently on version 2.19 of Star Atlas. So that includes features like single player time trial racing, single player hover course racing. There's a flight trainer and combat arena, so you can engage in ship versus ship combat. This is against NPC's. We also have a showroom, so you can just load in your assets and explore any of those assets that you do own.
07:31:25.462 - 07:32:11.952, Speaker A: And one of the cool features that we added to 2.19 is a gunplay trainer. And so this is PvP combat against bots, shooter against bots. I do want to point out here too, another question. I've heard a lot here, which I absolutely love, by the way, is well, what are the on chain elements that you've incorporated into Star Atlas and our vision? Our belief is that we want to build blockchain throughout every aspect of Star Atlas. And so we started with that by building the world's first Solana wallet that natively lives inside Unreal Engine so you can connect your wallet and view all your assets. And then late last year, we also added our marketplace integration.
07:32:11.952 - 07:32:41.082, Speaker A: So this is the same marketplace that you can access on play dot staratlas.com, just accessible in Enjin. So all of the items, assets, resources that you collect while you're playing, playing, you can trade those freely, peer to peer directly in engine. Again, Unreal release 2.2. This is a major milestone for us. I think this will be a pivotal moment for Star Atlas. It will be the biggest release that we've seen to date.
07:32:41.082 - 07:33:32.344, Speaker A: And what we're going to be focusing on in the 2.2 release is a racing career gameplay mode. So it's combat racing multiplayer, it is competitive racing in a traditional style. And what we're bringing out here is full multiplayer support, 24/7 liveops game, and it's open access on EGS. This is when I believe we will see the floodgates open up into Star Atlas. You get the repeatable, replayable gameplay loops and you also get on chain systems like character progression, XP systems, ship mastery, ship configuration, and of course character and vehicle skin customizations. I've got another great video for you here to show off what some of those upcoming features will look like.
07:33:32.344 - 07:37:58.214, Speaker A: Tell me just to make it out. Tell me, tell me. Oh, I feel so like we finally get to go into the lack of. All right, you guys like it? We are sparing no expense on quality and caliber of game design here. The first piece of Alpha that I have tonight, this is for you local guys, people that have been supporting us, following us for a long time. This is an exciting new release I'm announcing today. It's something that we call Project Rose Garden, and it's actually a project that we're reinstating since the beginning of this year.
07:37:58.214 - 07:41:30.574, Speaker A: So each of the factions in the game have a central space station. These will be vibrant hubs for commerce, vibrant hubs for social aspects of the game. These are the cities, these are the starting points for every new player. But where we see this commercial and social activity taking place. And so with just two additional level designers, and over the past couple of months, we put a bunch of work into designing and laying out the Oni Central space station. And I'm going to take you on another video to show you that what I think is really cool about that is every single one of those land plots can be hand selected by players, and every one of those residences will be owned by citizens of the Star Atlas Metaverse. And speaking of Metaverse, I did want to take a moment here to mention metagravity.
07:41:30.574 - 07:42:21.698, Speaker A: This is a partnership and relationship we mentioned or announced July of last year. And metagravity is back end server infrastructure and user concurrency scaling. This is what is going to enable us to reach hyperscale inside Star Atlas without the need to use separate instancing, separate servers, without loading screens or loading times, anywhere you explore throughout the star Atlas universe. We've been working through the integration through the early part of the year and just initially stress testing this technology. And so what we did over the last couple of months is start to build out this team based shooter with some extraction components. It's faction versus faction versus faction. You get kills, you capture tags, and then you have to take those two extraction points.
07:42:21.698 - 07:44:22.334, Speaker A: And we were able to achieve 1060 players in a single lobby, all participating in this gameplay mode, this mini gameplay mode. And while we do still have a tremendous amount of work to do with them, this is absolutely groundbreaking to bring AA game with that level of users currency. So just want to show you all what we did with surge credit to Dom there on our team for his PvP skills. All right, so let's transition over to sage. As I said, starless golden era. This is fully on chain gaming. This is a 2d rts MMO.
07:44:22.334 - 07:45:01.062, Speaker A: As I said, focus is fully on chain. This was developed by us so that we can provide greater accessibility to players all over the world. The MMO, as it stands today, barring some optimizations, might be difficult for everyone to play, but we do want everyone to have access to the Star Atlas economy. And the economy right now in Sage is thriving. It is flourishing. I do want to take you through a bit of the evolution of a fully on chain game probably inspires memories and some of you. We started in April of 2023 with something that we called escape velocity.
07:45:01.062 - 07:45:50.384, Speaker A: It was a very simple scavenger hunt type game. Movement and coordinates were on chain, so every time you moved a ship from one sector to the next, that would be an event that was recorded on Solana. You'd scan that sector and have a chance to get some random loot from there. In September of 2023, we rolled out Sage Labs. This was a pretty big enhancement. This was a focus on fleet formation, exploration, resource extraction, crafting and again, various ways of earning atlas in that play to earn economy looks very simple on the surface, but under the hood, this is the orchestration of about twelve different on chain programs, all operating with each other. And then in December of last year, we rolled out Sage 3D.
07:45:50.384 - 07:47:37.118, Speaker A: So it was all of these same on chain mechanics just developed out in play canvas, which is a native game engine in browser. I do have a big announcement today. So, since the beginning of the year, we made the decision that we are going to deprecate Sage 3D in the browser. We're going to keep the 2d browser support for anyone who wants to continue engaging in that. But we're going to refocus and consolidate our efforts, bringing Sage to unreal engine. We're calling that fleet command. So this is pretty profound what we're doing with this.
07:47:37.118 - 07:48:20.078, Speaker A: We're effectively creating a hybrid between the RTS MMO model and the traditional first person or third person MMO model. For one, we get to leverage all of the asset development that we've done with nanite assets in Unreal engine. But within that same Unreal engine client, you'll be able to go from macro scale RTS style management of entire fleets. And at the flip of a switch, via a toggle, you can go all the way down into the interior of your ship in first person, and you can decide if you want to control the whole fleet or your ship by yourself. So I am going to wrap up here just by talking a little bit about mobile. We're still expecting mobile to come out towards the tail end of the year. This is a fitness trainer.
07:48:20.078 - 07:48:52.134, Speaker A: It's our spin on the move to earn segment of the industry. In our case, you're not earning currency, you're not earning Atlas. You are leveling up a character as you go. So walking, running, going on bicycle rides, your character progresses, you find loot, and that loot, it will be equippable on that character. Alongside that is a crew. You'll need a crew member to join the mobile app. Now, this is something that's been highly anticipated by our community for a number of months now.
07:48:52.134 - 07:50:04.988, Speaker A: Crew in Star Atlas is actually pretty cool. For one, it will serve as your star Atlas PFP for all of you profile picture collectors out there. It's going to be your in game avatar in Unreal Engine. You can use this for crafting in Sage so you can have higher production output. And it also is your companion in, in the crew mobile, apparently. Yeah. So crew proud to announce that as of today, actually, right now in our marketplace, we've released an early access discounted edition of crew packs.
07:50:04.988 - 07:50:32.884, Speaker A: But we're super excited about getting these out there into the market. It's 7.5 million unique crew members, randomly generated traits from all different factions, every species across the game. 10,000 of those will be legendary, 50 of those will be anomaly. And the rest of the crew packs are coming out very, very soon. If you guys have ships, you're waiting for that crew to drop. Also coming and extremely soon, within the next couple of weeks.
07:50:32.884 - 07:51:18.056, Speaker A: So with that, everyone, if you're brand new to Star Atlas, let me personally welcome you, and I hope you'll join us in this journey of the star Atlas Metaverse. For everyone else out there that has been following us forever, we have an incredibly exciting couple of months ahead. And thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. Thank you, Michael. That was a very interesting, entertaining and audio, visually lively presentation. So that brings us to the last panel of the day.
07:51:18.056 - 07:52:11.382, Speaker A: Before that, I'd like to thank you as being your host, Rashid Berkeley. My name and I go with Berkerito Brkerto, and it has been a pleasure hosting this event and you have been an amazing crowd. Thanks a lot and thank you. And our panelists on stage for Solana Crossroads edition 2024, Ansem, Caitlin Cook and Mia Grodsky. Last grand round of applause, please. Thank you. Wow, we made it.
07:52:11.382 - 07:52:35.734, Speaker A: Last panel of Crossroads 2024. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, guys, so this panel, the title is ticker of the day. I'm sure folks are dying to know what Ansem's ticker of the day is. I saw you tweet earlier. You were like, I'm on a panel today called Ticker of the day. Lol.
07:52:35.734 - 07:53:16.094, Speaker A: So I think a good place to start for this panel is to maybe just discuss the meme. Meme coin mania, kind of broadly. Is this going to last, or should we get our bags now? Is this still going to be a trend in the next cycle, or is this kind of like a one time thing? What are both of your takes on that? I guess that's for me. Yeah. I mean, I think it's going to be a trend that keeps coming back cycle to cycle. This one, I think, has been like, it's lasted the longest at like, one time that I've seen in one crypto cycle. If you just look at Doge, doge was around in like, 2014, came back the next cycle in like 2017.
07:53:16.094 - 07:53:57.174, Speaker A: Last cycle was probably the craziest one, which is when Doge went to, like 100 billion market cap. So I think that was kind of, like, a proof of concept for, like, oh, memes can actually go that high. And then this cycle, you see a lot of memes just sitting at multi billions now, like, pepe bulk with Shib Doge, like, a lot of them. See, I would be very surprised if they just don't come back next cycle just because memes are a very core part of Internet culture, and crypto is very closely tied to that. So I think it's going to continue to happen. Yeah, yeah, I think, I mean, there's definitely a cyclicality to it. This isn't the first cycle that we've seen it happen.
07:53:57.174 - 07:54:24.890, Speaker A: It's certainly not the last. I do think that, like, the low cost, high throughput chains like Solana have definitely made it go kind of mega turbo versus what we've seen before, but it's definitely not something that goes away. That memetic desire is, like, very strong just in humans in general. And then in crypto culture, we've seen that pretty extensively. So I don't really think it's going anywhere anytime soon. Yeah, I think everyone is trying to get their skin in the game to some degree. Right? It's like, people that already have bags are trying to.
07:54:24.890 - 07:55:03.542, Speaker A: To get bigger bags, and folks that haven't quite dipped into it yet are interested. What do you think institutions think or see when they're watching this happen? I think institutions have long been figuring out different ways to get into crypto. We talked a bit earlier about how they're approaching RWas. This is very, very different. Should institutions be spending time looking at meme? Should they be investing in meme coins? Or is that just, you know, never going to happen? I know personally, like, for a fact that liquid funds are buying memes. For sure, for sure, for sure. I didn't like a lot of them.
07:55:03.542 - 07:55:40.544, Speaker A: It's pretty wild. I mean, if you're a liquid fund in crypto, your job is to get beta to the majors, which is like, sold bitcoin and whatever. The best way to do that is that you can get liquidity and size on. They're. They're gonna do that. So when you have memes that get over a billion dollar market cap, even honestly in, like, the mid nine figure range, it's easier for them to, like, think through putting positions on, because it's the same type of trade as you would take for, like, an l one or like, a d five play by size, like, when they're one hundred k mark cap, obviously, it's just retail aping. But once they get bigger and, like, I've proven that they're gonna be around for a while.
07:55:40.544 - 07:56:04.808, Speaker A: It's a trade that a lot of funds actually take. It took them last cycle, too. Like, a lot of funds are buying doge last cycle. That's how it went so high. I mean, I think there's a big distinction, too, between crypto focused funds and the larger, more traditional. Yeah, but I mean, which. I mean, those are really, really significant pools of capital, and it's something that I know personally that there's conversations about.
07:56:04.808 - 07:56:30.728, Speaker A: Not that they're going to be aping into meme coins anytime soon, soon. But when it comes to crypto in general, like, a lot of these more institutional type investment funds have boards that they report to. Right. And those board members see the same things that retail participants do. They see all of the meme coins that are going viral. They're seeing the mania that's happening for the better or worse, all of the good and the bad. And those board members are asking the investors about these things.
07:56:30.728 - 07:57:15.004, Speaker A: Right. So, not to say that they're going to be aping into anything anytime soon, but they're conversations that are being had, and even if it's not going to be immediate, like, their eyes are on crypto for sure. And there's just more of a stringent kind of investment thesis and processes that they have to go through in order to allocate. And it's a lot stickier funds, so they don't do anything, you know, quite as quickly. But we've even seen some move into bitcoin, and the approval of the bitcoin ETF, I think something like doge would be a pretty far way off of that. Even a small percentage allocation would be, like, a really, really large amount of money, and that could very easily overwhelm a market if it's not a larger cat meme coin, either. So, I mean, there's a lot there, but they're watching.
07:57:15.004 - 07:57:45.236, Speaker A: It's really hard to miss. You'd have to be pretty blind to miss what's happening lately. I just saw Vanek made a meme coin index, not an actual ETF, obviously, like an index of the top meme that people can just track and look at, which is pretty wild, because they're like, they're a very institutional player. Right. And I think something we can do is, you know, and when you get new followers that are big institutions, let us know, you know, when they start following you, you put out that bat signal, and then we know that they're really watching. When they're in my DM's. I'll let everybody know.
07:57:45.236 - 07:58:18.664, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Send a signal of some sort. So kind of going back to the, you know, name slash topic of this panel ticker of the day. You know, how are most traders approaching this. This idea of, like, one ticker of the day? Is it more of like a polyamorous thing where you have a bunch up and you kind of are watching them all day and then choosing one that you're going to trade on, or, like, what's your main approach to that? I have way too many positions, honestly. I'm like, I don't even keep track of them. I have a ton of different wallets, ton of different positions.
07:58:18.664 - 07:59:09.850, Speaker A: But I would say when I'm looking for, like, new, newer coins, I'm usually either bird eye or on deck screener or a combination of them. And then, like, looking at what's trending, like, what's going the most volume on chain, and I kind of separate it by market cap. So, like, if I'm looking for really micro cap stuff, obviously under ten mil, and then, like, ten to 50 mil range is a different range, and then obviously the bigger ones. But typically, what you see with the memes is, like, when one does really well, then you're going to see other people look for, okay, what's the next one that's going to do really well? Like, when Bach went 30 x or whatever it was after Bak did well, people are like, okay, well, people are trading on Solana now. What other memes are going to do well in Solana? Like, Whiff was one of the ones that did really well. Now we have cat coins that are doing well. There's just a lot of different areas that people just continue to focus on.
07:59:09.850 - 07:59:41.952, Speaker A: And the thing with memes is they literally can start from zero, because there's a ton of memes that exist on the Internet, but 99% of them don't have coins attached to them. So what people are doing now is, like, they're going on TikTok. They're, like, looking at historical memes and just pulling those from the Internet and be like, okay, I'm gonna make a coin on this now and then forming communities around them. So, yeah, so we have some meme anthropology apologist. Yeah, maybe that'll be a LinkedIn job title one day. They're in the trenches trying things. Yeah.
07:59:41.952 - 08:00:03.076, Speaker A: In the arena, I guess I should say. I think it's pretty impossible to focus on, like, one meme a day. Like, it was funny that that's the title for this panel, because I can't imagine. I'm, like, pretty passive, too. I think it's more like the trad five background in me. I, like, need to left curve harder and definitely don't meme car, like, meme coin, like, to the fullest extent. Maybe I should take a note from Z and do a little bit more working on it.
08:00:03.076 - 08:00:51.064, Speaker A: But even watching passively, it's really, really hard to just focus on one thing. Like, to his point, there are so many different things popping up every single day. I think I looked up the number of meme coins that are out in circulation today, and, like, the number's absurd and it's growing like crazy. So if you have the focus to, you know, pay attention to one single meme coin in a day, God bless, because I don't know how. How you can possibly do that. So let's dive into this idea of, like, a fascination with one a day, though, because one of the crazy things about the Internet is when something goes viral, right? And maybe it's like, a global event that's associated with it, or it's just something that happens natively online. We were talking yesterday, ansem, about the Biden Bowdoin coin mania, and we were speaking on how notoriety of names can affect these things.
08:00:51.064 - 08:01:34.044, Speaker A: And, you know, sometimes there are global events that happen, like Summer Olympics are coming up. Is there going to be, like, you know, something that happens there that inspires a meme, that then inspires a coin? What do you think is sort of the recipe for that virality on a single thing? Like, from your experience, what can you boil it down to when all of the attention is going just in one place for a day or two? I mean, it usually lasts, I would say, more than a day. Usually it's like weeks at a time, but it's super interesting. It's a lot like the Zoomer, the Zoomer crew, I think they kind of lead the charge on what goes viral on social media. Like one. Like, one of the coins now that people launch? I think a few weeks ago, it's called Hammy. It's like a sad hamster.
08:01:34.044 - 08:02:04.716, Speaker A: And on TikTok, it gets, like, millions and millions and millions of views whenever people post it. And they attach it to a ton of different things. But people on TikTok know what it is. But then crypto Twitter finds it, like, oh, now it's. Now it's a meme coin. Now there's a community around it. But I think the interesting piece this cycle is going to be when you have those people on TikTok who already know what the meme is but don't have crypto wallets, and they start making crypto wallets and it's like, oh, whenever I see a meme on TikTok, I'm gonna go to Dexcreener and I'm gonna buy it.
08:02:04.716 - 08:03:05.012, Speaker A: That hasn't really happened yet. It's more so just like, crypto native people being like, this is popular. We're going to buy this and create this on our own. But that crossover, I think, hasn't happened in like, in bulk yet. Yeah. So I think, you know, a part of this, I guess we're kind of speaking right now about like, yeah, viral stuff sort of taps into marketing and content creation a bit. Like, how do you think it, like, is content creation for meme coins inherently different than some of the content we've seen in maybe just like even memes on the Internet or in other parts of crypto? Like, is it similar to how NFT creators were pumping nfts during the last cycle? Like, is there something uniquely different about the content, the messaging, the way that we're thinking about these meme tokens? Yeah, it's kind of funny how serious of a combo this is now, but two different, I think there's kind of two different main ways that meme coins get launched.
08:03:05.012 - 08:03:28.404, Speaker A: One of them is like, there's a official team attached to them. So Bach has an official team behind, like, the meme. It's more of a culture coin. And around Bach, it's like there's products that get built for a slot ecosystem. Like there's bonkbot, there's a ton of other things that people build. And then that, like, is revenue for the meme. I think the other thing is, the other way is when it's like 100% distributed to the community.
08:03:28.404 - 08:04:02.452, Speaker A: And then the way that those memes do content is by giving people something that they can meme a ton of different ways. Like, Michi is one of the cat coins that's been popular recently. And it's not really a team making content for it. It's just people that take the cat, they use Photoshop, and they put different outfits on the cat, and then they make it their profile pictures. So, you know, I have an army of people just all over Twitter non stop posting the meme. So it's like two different ways, I think, that it happens, but, yeah, it's definitely content creation. I think it's more of a.
08:04:02.452 - 08:05:21.834, Speaker A: You asked if, you know, NFT projects and others are, you know, maybe there are some similarities between that and meme coin marketing, I think, you know, NFT projects, even, like, I'm marketing for like, a more infrastructure type of project, I think every other type of project in the space is taking notes from meme coin content creators, right? Whether it is like the actual contributors to the projects themselves or the community. I mean, in a more like, decentralized ecosystem, if you're building a project, the end goal in most cases is bringing it to the community and kind of passing it off and away. And that doesn't just, you know, that includes the marketing of it and the memetics of it and the, like, continuous communicating the message, whatever that is, whether it's a meme, whether it's actually a project, maybe a little bit of both. That's sort of the end state, and meme coins sort of start there, which I think is really interesting. And so do you guys think that meme coins is still a subculture or is this a mainstream part of crypto? Like, do you remember when it was more of an underground, kind of like grassroots, just like really degen thing? Is it becoming more mainstream now? Like, where are we, you know, right now in the cycle? It definitely feels a lot more normalized. I mean, I've never been on stage talking about meme coins, for sure. I would say, like, before it was kind of like the degens just buying them.
08:05:21.834 - 08:05:52.744, Speaker A: And then you have, like, the people in crypto who say that they're worth nothing. Like they don't have any value, they don't have any revenues. It was kind of like two sided where people like, oh, they're either worthless or djns are trading them, and now it's pretty normalized. I think everybody, everybody is aware of them. If you look at the stats on any l one or l two, most of the top, out of the top, like 25 coins are memes, just like by trading volume. So that's literally what people are trading on chain right now, which is pretty interesting. Can't really ignore it at this point.
08:05:52.744 - 08:06:22.016, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like they've become more generally accepted. Right? Like, you know what it's hitting for if you're, like, buying a meme coin and, like, hoping for that hundred x, but maybe, maybe you get there, maybe you won't. And I think it's generally, like, much more accepted now than it was in the past. And obviously so many more of them that are coming out on the market every single day, I literally can't keep track. I just see different ones spamming my replies on Twitter. You guys probably understand that too. It's a real pain, but I know that it's definitely becoming more mainstream.
08:06:22.016 - 08:07:27.946, Speaker A: And my signal is that I'm getting a lot of texts from my normie friends about meme coins, which I used to not even get text about anything more than maybe like, bitcoin, Solana east. Like, they've branched out too. So I think the distribution is getting, like, much wider in terms of eyeballs and who's seeing it, right? So I think it's those types of signals or, like we were joking earlier, like, if institutions start following Ansem, you know, and we did see that happen in the last cycle with things like nfts and dows, and, you know, maybe, maybe the New York Times will do a deep dive feature on meme coins soon enough. But from both of your experiences, you know, there might be people here in our audience that are looking to get into meme coins for the first time, like, complete novice or trying to get into it deeper. What are your high level? Just sort of like, tips, things to do, things to avoid. Yeah, I would say to make sure you check, like, if the liquidity is locked. So I would say, first things I would say, don't ape your entire portfolio into one meme or a few memes.
08:07:27.946 - 08:08:05.090, Speaker A: It's not smart. I think it's better to have your safe portion of your portfolio. I've said this a lot, keep 70% of your portfolio in safer things, where that's like eth, bitcoin, Solana, coinbase, stock, stuff like that. Then the other part of your portfolio, the smaller part, is the Degen portfolio. You can do whatever you want with that, but it's like if you lose your shirt on a meme that you bought at a million and went 90% negative, 90% a day, your portfolio's not all gone. And I would say when you're actually buying memes and, like, looking for which ones to buy, you kind of can break them down by market cap. Obviously the smaller ones have the most upside, but they're also the riskiest.
08:08:05.090 - 08:08:38.016, Speaker A: So when you're buying stuff under a million, you want to look at, like, the distribution of the token supply. Make sure the number, like, the top three holders, don't have 50%. Obviously that's not good. They're looking to dump immediately. They're in from zero and they already have 50% of the supply, so you want it to be distributed pretty widely. And then I would say to make sure the liquidity is locked on the coin so the devs can't literally rug it. That's why pump fund or pump fund has done pretty well is because, like, all the coins that launch through there, they know for a fact they're locked.
08:08:38.016 - 08:09:12.432, Speaker A: Getting rubbed on them, at least. And you can check and see who owns, like, what percent of supply. Yeah, I would say, like, honestly, being active on crypto Twitter is pretty big if you're trading memes, because you can actively see all the communities there. They all live on crypto Twitter. One of the ways that I found with super early, like, under a million, it was because I was on Twitter and the whiff Twitter account was under everybody's platform posts, like, just photoshopping the hat onto random people's profile pictures. Like, the dog was everywhere. I just kept seeing it over and over, and I saw it in my telegram chat as well.
08:09:12.432 - 08:09:41.804, Speaker A: People were super big on it and liked it a lot. But I'll say, yeah, be active on Twitter and the other two things, for sure. Yeah, I feel like it's a full time job on that one. Like, just scouting out, like, the next hundred x and being early on it. You definitely have to be surfing the replies and kind of, like, tracking that pretty closely, I think, if you want to really see what. What's there very early. And then also, I'd say, I mean, you took the more, like, mom disclosure type of things that I was gonna say more on the, you know, don't lose your shirt on one thing, don't put all your eggs in one basket, that sort of thing.
08:09:41.804 - 08:10:28.484, Speaker A: I'd also say, too, though, like, people don't talk about this part enough, but every time there's a meme coin cycle and people start making, you know, 100 x. Right, cash out at some point, like, pay yourself. And I think that that's something that a lot of people that I've seen in this space, like friends, et cetera, people on the timeline that, you know, are down bad perpetually, just not taking profit at any point, whether it's like, clipping a bit as it goes up, like, whatever the timing you feel is right on that. But you see so many people round trip, and I wonder how many times it takes for you to, like, learn that lesson. So I feel like that's what I always say to people who want to get involved in that, too, because it's exciting on the way up, but it hurts on the way down. You don't really want to round trip it if you don't have to. And I'm sure you're watching closely anyway, so just take a bit out.
08:10:28.484 - 08:11:13.334, Speaker A: Yeah. You don't I would say it's really, really hard to sell the picotop, especially in, like, one cell. I'll say the easiest way to do it is, like, have a pre plan before stuff gets crazy, because, like, when you're already for, it's gonna be way harder to actually click the button. But if you're like, I was selling 5% of 500, I'm gonna sell 5% at 705%, 900, and you just have those predetermined levels where you want to cash some out, and then you literally set that. I think that's a better way to plan for it because it's harder to do in the moment. So on this topic of cashing out, how do you know if you're too late to a meme? What are the signs that you're not early? It might feel like you are, but you're late. How do you know? I wish I could answer that question.
08:11:13.334 - 08:11:38.828, Speaker A: I would have infinite dollars, but it's. It's a combination of things. I think, for the memes now, you kind of have a good frame of reference for what can happen and what the top memes are. So, like, stuff like doge, I think, is around 20 billion. So that should be, like, if you're thinking crazy, crazy. That should be, like, your ceiling, kind of, for where you think memes can go. Last cycle went to 100 billion.
08:11:38.828 - 08:12:21.868, Speaker A: Maybe stuff goes around there this cycle, but if you're looking at, like, new launches, the coins that are trading right now have been leading this cycle. I think Pepe is right now the biggest, like, 4 billion with. Is it, like, 3 billion? Bak is at, like, 1.5 billion or something around there. And if you could just look at the time it took for those memes to get there, I think it was probably, like, a few months, three to four months, six months on average. So, like, if you're looking for a ceiling on what new launchers could do if they become leaders and break out, you kind of already have targets in place for where stuff can go to. It's really hard to know when you're late or early, because attention is the biggest thing with memes.
08:12:21.868 - 08:12:55.280, Speaker A: And if you're betting on a meme going higher, you're essentially betting on it maintaining attention or growing its attention in some way. So you kind of have to figure out why or how you think that's going to happen. Yeah. So I think this brings us to our final question of the day. Our final question on the final panel during crossroads. What's the ticker of the day? What's the one I gave two already, I think. Yeah, I think Michi is a good one.
08:12:55.280 - 08:13:40.956, Speaker A: I think Hammy is a good one. Another smaller one that I think is interesting is like, with the Olympics coming up, the election coming up, kind of the politics thing that's been happening in the US. There's a meme called white boy Summer just launched, I want to say, a few weeks ago, and I see my DM's all the time. So I know the MAGA crowd is there somewhat. But if you're betting on kind of like that tension continue to happen and just like, betting on the election and everything around there, that could be an interesting one. It's pretty small, I think a safe play if you want to have a safe place, like GTO. So GTO, the actual MeV protocol Solana is printing right now because of how many people are trading memes and making, like, doing so many trades.
08:13:40.956 - 08:14:04.936, Speaker A: Like, I think Solana Mev is pretty close to where Ethereum MeV is. And that's kind of like an underlying protocol that makes money off of everything. I'm down with the political coins, too, with the election coming up. I know, like, bowdoin's a big one. There are, like, a couple smaller ones, like us debt wall, which I think are pretty funny, too. I mean, my evergreen one, so it's the ticker of every day, I guess, is bonk. I think a bet on bonk to bet on.
08:14:04.936 - 08:14:35.344, Speaker A: Solana, to be honest with you and that community and the team behind it has been, like, very persistent in supporting the teams that have been around and are building, like, really valuable things. So that's definitely, definitely my most bullish bag every day. I love it. Well, this has been great, you guys. Ansem, Caitlin, thank both of you so much. This is very fun and thanks to everyone for being here. Bonk is amazing.
08:14:35.344 - 08:15:30.260, Speaker A: The correct answer for ticker of the day is Solana. Okay, so thank you so much, guys. That brings us to the end of crossroads for 2024. So thank you so much for coming. What an amazing couple of days. A little bit of a brief for those that were at my welcome pitch, but we didn't think it would be as big as this. So thank you all so much for making it the best conference that we've ever done, and a lot of people have come to me and said that this was amazing.
08:15:30.260 - 08:15:53.770, Speaker A: So thank you so much. It really is because of you guys coming here that makes this a success. But really, the real heroes here are some of the people behind the scenes that are making it a success. So big shout out to Chris Fiore at the back there. Famous rapper Chris. Absolutely. Chris has been slaving away for multiple days.
08:15:53.770 - 08:16:15.442, Speaker A: I don't think he slept. You should probably sleep, bro. I think you need to do that. Also, big shout out to Theptila as well at the back. Theptila. Thepa has been helping us with everything here locally in turkey. Everyone from all the Solana all stars, we're so great to have you here as well.
08:16:15.442 - 08:16:45.462, Speaker A: And also everyone from all over the world, we got Jesus from all stars, Venezuela as well, representing some amazing but absolutely touche as well. Touche is a robot. So Tuche, I don't know where she is. She's probably recharging her power banks because she's a robot. But thank you so much. And we also have, yeah, in general, the rest of, you know, all of the teams involved. And we've also got Thomas as well.
08:16:45.462 - 08:17:06.352, Speaker A: Thomas and the team, the tech team at the front here. Congratulations as well. Thank you so much. Doing a really awesome job. Check out this awesome camera boom thing that we've had as well this year. So amazing stuff. Now, we do have some really cool things happening, so I'm just going to read off what's going on.
08:17:06.352 - 08:17:33.048, Speaker A: So we have a vip yacht party tonight. Meet at the conference entrance for VIP. So if you're a vip ticket holder. 07:45 p.m. and just be waiting outside, there will be buses, and then we'll go to the boat. But you will need the vip risk brand for all stars. Scan the QR codes at registration, and essentially it will be first come, first served.
08:17:33.048 - 08:17:50.164, Speaker A: So scan the QR codes for the location of where to go. The boat, I think, leaves somewhere in Bebec, something like this. So definitely go and check that. And for everyone else, yeah. The boat will be three to 4 hours. We'll be having some fun. There'll be some music.
08:17:50.164 - 08:18:00.360, Speaker A: Music. And there'll be a bit of food and drink as well. So go and check that out. But yes, look. Amazing. What an amazing time. I am exhausted.
08:18:00.360 - 08:18:20.364, Speaker A: I'm like the stand in guy for a lot of these things. And no, it's been really fun. I've met really awesome people. There's so many other people behind the scenes scenes as well. You know, who you are that are helping out. But, yeah, all the best. And thank you so much for making crossroads a success for 2024, and we look to see you again next year.
