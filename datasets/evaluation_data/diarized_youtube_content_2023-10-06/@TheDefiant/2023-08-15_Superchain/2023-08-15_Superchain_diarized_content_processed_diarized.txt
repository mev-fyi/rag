00:00:00.170 - 00:00:47.426, Speaker A: The superchain is a bunch of L two s coming together and saying we are going to build together and we are going to scale together and we are going to basically create a decentralized network of chains. The goal of the superchain is to basically put all these chains on a shared standard and continuously improve their interoperability. The user experience, the consistency of the developer experience, work towards a future in which we can get all the benefits that are necessary for having multiple chains. But we can also get all of the advantages that come with one cohesive network. Right. When you go on the Internet, you're not thinking of what is my ISP, what is the IP address of my router. It all just happens in the background and we need to make the same transformation to happen to chains.
00:00:47.426 - 00:00:49.250, Speaker A: So that's the goal of the superchain.
