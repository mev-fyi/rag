00:00:00.410 - 00:00:25.874, Speaker A: Ah, tutorials. They're really the bread and butter and the core audience driver of the great majority of YouTube channels. Learn something. How appealing. But I'll be honest, I don't really enjoy making them much on DeFi, and that's mainly because it's often been so slow and expensive to actually get them shot. I lost count of how many times this year we tried to demo something and it just wouldn't work. Or I'd be waiting an hour just to get it transaction confirmed.
00:00:25.874 - 00:00:35.970, Speaker A: Or it would cost me $500 just to show you like a really simple transaction. Which is why you will have noticed this transition from demos to explanations.
00:00:36.050 - 00:00:38.006, Speaker B: Instead, we started with Barnbridge and their.
00:00:38.028 - 00:00:44.294, Speaker A: Smart alpha product and the demands of putting out a new tutorial every week. Well, they're both horrible and actually really helpful.
00:00:44.342 - 00:00:46.266, Speaker B: I'm forced to go and understand so.
00:00:46.288 - 00:00:53.966, Speaker A: Many different DeFi ideas, but from the inside out. And that, I think, gives me a great overview of what's actually being built now. I don't think I would go this.
00:00:53.988 - 00:00:56.430, Speaker B: Deep if I didn't have to personally.
00:00:56.930 - 00:01:20.978, Speaker A: Over the course of the year I've become more of a fan of protocols that aim to solve problems like impermanent loss or downside protection while still providing a favorable rate of return. I do feel farming as we used to know it, is most likely going to die away over the next 18 months, not completely, but probably become less important. So these less exotic but more practical setups are really where I think DFI can shine.
00:01:21.074 - 00:01:26.694, Speaker B: Nexo is a trusted and easy to use crypto lending and exchange platform where you can buy cryptocurrencies at the touch.
00:01:26.732 - 00:01:28.278, Speaker A: Of a button and start earning up.

00:01:33.078 - 00:01:34.266, Speaker A: On the market and allow you to.

00:02:02.510 - 00:02:06.246, Speaker A: Don't like impermanent loss? Then head to OCP finance for up.
00:02:06.268 - 00:02:15.254, Speaker B: To 20% native APY on bitcoin, stablecoins and your other favorite cryptos native APY. That means no more shitcoin rewards for.
00:02:15.292 - 00:02:16.678, Speaker A: Me and for you.
00:02:16.764 - 00:02:23.206, Speaker B: You stake bitcoin, you get bitcoin, no lockups. Fully liquid and fully DFI.
00:02:23.318 - 00:02:45.982, Speaker A: OCP finance. Yeah, I'd buy that for a dollar. I didn't say that. They said that, but I might say that. So my highlights of our tutorials this year would definitely our video on Pendle's yield products, the fixed interest on 88, our series on how to buy and sell digital PFP collectibles. But you, the dear viewer, you disagree. So let's jump into the most popular tutorials of the year.
00:02:45.982 - 00:03:12.850, Speaker A: They were staking on E 20 and how to earn 20% on anchor. Narrowly missed the top three, but for some reason, how to mint an NFT on mintable lands at number three. Proof of proof were needed that simple help content ranks beautifully on YouTube, but I suspect a simple tweet from Mark Cuban might have been the wind in the sails of this particular ship. Now, we dropped a tutorial on Decentraland just when the Facebook to meta news dropped, and this, weird enough, has been.
00:03:12.860 - 00:03:14.682, Speaker B: Our strongest video of the entire channel.
00:03:14.736 - 00:03:22.966, Speaker A: In the second half of 2021. People were looking for meta content, even though I don't think we showed the project in the best light. It's just one of those YouTube bait.
00:03:22.998 - 00:03:24.862, Speaker B: Videos that I think viewers are looking for.
00:03:24.916 - 00:04:02.330, Speaker A: But our best performing tutorial by far was one on Binance smart chain and pancake swap. Now when we released the film, ETH was becoming rapidly way too expensive for the vast majority of users. Binance smart chain offered a way for regular folk to gain exposure to this space and start having fun, because for them. But it was fun. Etheads will always throw down the argument that if something isn't decentralized, then it isn't valid. But the path to education isn't stick, it's carrot or an AK 47 full of whiskey. ALP pulpit preachers are going to be invariably proven intransigent blowhards because of one simple fact, and that is liquidity.
00:04:02.330 - 00:04:05.574, Speaker A: That very word itself. It's about fluidity.
00:04:05.622 - 00:04:07.034, Speaker B: It's the ability to pass through the.
00:04:07.072 - 00:04:14.282, Speaker A: Smallest gap and travel along the path of least resistance. And being a maxi and promoting decentralization.
00:04:14.346 - 00:04:16.058, Speaker B: At all costs, well, that's resistance.
00:04:16.154 - 00:04:47.014, Speaker A: There is no defi without liquidity. So however we feel philosophically about all of this, we do have to recognize which way the river is flowing. And for everything we did right this year. You know what? I don't think I ever really got to grips with the tutorial format, and it's definitely something we'll be looking to level up next year. The numbers don't lie though, so when we land on the right topic, it's the biggest driver of traffic to the channel. Definitely something we can't ignore. So anyway, if there's things you'd like us to cover for next year, just burning things that you want to just have some help with, do drop them in the comments below.
00:04:47.014 - 00:04:50.260, Speaker A: We'll pick them up next year. Until then, have a wonderful end of your year.
