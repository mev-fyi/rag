00:00:00.170 - 00:00:17.354, Speaker A: In both the world of DFI and just regular PhI, the weekend chatter was dominated by rumors that two of the biggest investment banks in the world, Credit Suisse and Deutsche bank, are dangerously close to going under. But are they really? Is this the Lehman brothers 20, or are we getting ahead of ourselves?
00:00:17.482 - 00:00:54.214, Speaker B: Also, would DFI fare any different under similar circumstances? To answer that, first, let's step back to understand what's going on. Credit Suisse has been losing money for three straight quarters and missing analyst expectations at a time when the rest of the Wall street has been posting profits. And that's been due to a string of bad bets which have cost the bank huge amounts of money. The most notorious one is probably the 5.5 billion hit it took lending to Archigo's capital management, a failed family office. It was also forced to freeze billions after financial services firm Greensill Capital, to which it had lended money, folded. The losses and missteps have been dragging the stock down all year.
00:00:54.214 - 00:01:09.774, Speaker B: But things really started to unravel over the past week after reports by financial news media and Wall street analysts that Credit Suisse faced a capital gap of about 4 billion swiss francs and it was looking for investors to raise fresh cash. And with a radical overhaul of its businesses, I think we could all happily.
00:01:09.822 - 00:01:53.034, Speaker A: Say avidizen to Deutsche bank and Credit Suisse, considering they have a track history between the two of them. That includes espionage, drug money laundering, wire fraud, tax fraud, exchange rate manipulation, funding of the Keystone pipeline, and close business ties with russian oligarchs Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein. But wishing for their demise would be blatant disregard for the global economy, which would suffer big time. As Graham Stephen points out in this tweet, the Lehman brothers held 600 billion in assets when they went under in 2008. At the moment, Deutsche bank and Credit Suisse hold 4.6 times that amount, with 2000 800 billion between the two of them. In other words, their collapse could lead to the 2008 crisis, but then on steroids.
00:01:53.034 - 00:02:21.850, Speaker A: So for Credit Suisse, the rumors seemed to be a self fulfilling prophecy coming true after Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Kune issued a memo on Friday saying that the bank was at a critical moment looking to calm investors. He wrote this, which essentially says, ignore the incoming press and our stock price performance, Credit Suisse will be fine. This did little to calm anyone, and a flood of negative attention came Credit Suisse's way, with the twitter community pointing out that their stock has fallen by 40% in the past year.
00:02:21.920 - 00:03:10.102, Speaker B: And it wasn't just a stock which raised red flags across markets, but the bank's credit default swaps or cost to protect against banks default, has swore to a record high, higher than the 2008 crisis levels. The market action at Credit Suisse has also dragged down Deutsche bank, which has had a similar string of bad bets and scandals. So what's different here versus DFI is that in the case of these banks, we're left to rely on a CEO memo to tell us that Credit Suisse has solid capital and liquidity. And we only got a hold of that memo because it was leaked by reporters. He also told employees that he will be sending them a regular update until the firm announces the new strategic plan on October 27. But you know what would be better than leaked memos? Financial reports published only every three months and statements from bank management. Real time, transparent access to view the state of any financial entity at any time.
00:03:10.102 - 00:03:31.198, Speaker B: That's what DFI provides. If Credit Suisse were run on chain investors and the general public would have an exact idea of its balance sheet, capital ratios and quality of its assets, those risks would have been better priced over time and hopefully better managed with input from the wider community, rather than come as a shock over the weekend riddled with speculation that's roiling the entire global market. But we shouldn't be panicking just yet.
00:03:31.284 - 00:04:20.270, Speaker A: So even though many of us are experiencing some sort of deja vu moment, we should be careful comparing the Lehman brothers to 2008. Much has changed since then to make sure banks don't fall like the Lehman Bros. Did for the EU. The 2008 crisis was a wake up call and led to the establishment of a single resolution mechanism, or SRM, a central institution with the sole purpose of making sure that any institution that is failing or has failed will be restructured in such a way that the bank's failure does not cause harm to the broader economy or cause financial instability. In Switzerland, the Swiss National bank plays a similar role as the SRM. So for both Credit Suisse and Deutsche bank, we can expect intervention before either could possibly go under. All in all, it looks like Credit Suisse may not be going down after all.
00:04:20.270 - 00:04:40.482, Speaker A: Although Justin here does make a point, tweeting Credit Suisse's chairman's last name is Lehman. That's all the alpha you need to know about this situation. Despite all the rumors, both the prices of ETH and BTC remained within their weekly range as we entered October. Looking back on September, it was a mixed month overall, so the financial system.
00:04:40.536 - 00:04:54.930, Speaker B: May be better protected than in 2008, and hopefully there won't be a similar global scale crash. But if there's one thing that this bear market is making clear is that transparent markets that work programmatically with smart contracts have so far fared a lot better than both CFI and Tratfi.
00:04:55.010 - 00:04:58.360, Speaker A: This has been your Monday quick take so long and see you later.
00:04:59.610 - 00:05:02.860, Speaker B: You our.
