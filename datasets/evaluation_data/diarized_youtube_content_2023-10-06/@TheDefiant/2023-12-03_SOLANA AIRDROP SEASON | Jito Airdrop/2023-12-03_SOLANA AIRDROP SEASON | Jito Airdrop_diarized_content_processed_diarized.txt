00:00:00.250 - 00:01:10.078, Speaker A: Now on Solana, it looks like it's having a bit of a airdrop season. So Jito, which is the second largest DAP on Solana after Marinade, announced a new token. And an airdrop Jito produces infrastructure for. It's, it builds kind of MeV protection, and it has a liquid staking token called Jiro Sol Token. But now it announced it's launching a governance token, JTO, separate from Jiro Sol, which is already live. And these new tokens, JTO tokens will have a supply of 1,000,000,010% of which will be airdropped to users who have contributed to the Jiro network development. The snapshot for the airdrop was already taken on November 25.
00:01:10.078 - 00:01:21.830, Speaker A: So unfortunately for all of you listening, it's a bit late if you haven't already participated in the Jiro network.
00:01:23.370 - 00:01:27.550, Speaker B: But yeah, interesting to see airdrops happening on Solana.
00:01:27.650 - 00:02:01.794, Speaker A: They're kind of taking the same model that Ethereum DApps took early on, which is doing a snapshot and seeing rewarding users who participated in the DAP retroactively. So if you're looking for airdrops, I would check out what other Solana Dapps are doing and if it makes sense.
00:02:01.832 - 00:02:04.260, Speaker B: To participate in any of those.
00:02:04.970 - 00:02:21.290, Speaker A: Which reminds me, we have just stealthily launched a new section of our website. We haven't really publicized it yet because it's not 100% ready, but I'll give you the scoop.
00:02:21.630 - 00:02:23.946, Speaker B: Now, for those listening, we have an.
00:02:23.968 - 00:02:29.754, Speaker A: Airdrops and yield section on the website. For those of you watching this on.
00:02:29.792 - 00:02:34.670, Speaker B: YouTube, I'll show you here, it's on our menu.
00:02:36.370 - 00:02:40.670, Speaker A: It's a drop down. It says airdrops yields if you go to airdrops.
00:02:41.170 - 00:03:00.514, Speaker B: This is a summary of our Defi alpha. That's our paid newsletter, and we give you all of the potential airdrops that are coming out. And then, same with the yield section, we give you great kind of yield.
00:03:00.562 - 00:03:13.782, Speaker A: Opportunities for ETH, stablecoins and other major tokens. So you have all of that handily summarized in one place. So we really hope that this is.
00:03:13.836 - 00:03:19.700, Speaker B: Useful to defi and crypto users. We really think it is. So check it out.
