00:00:04.520 - 00:00:08.910, Speaker A: Hi, Kane. Hello. Welcome to the Defiant podcast. It's great to have you on again.
00:00:08.990 - 00:00:10.010, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you.
00:00:11.110 - 00:00:18.894, Speaker A: So obviously you're the founder of Synthetix, but now you started a new protocol, dapp Infinix.
00:00:18.982 - 00:00:19.630, Speaker B: That's right.
00:00:19.750 - 00:00:23.270, Speaker A: I'd love just a brief overview of both to get us started.
00:00:23.430 - 00:01:06.434, Speaker B: Yeah. So Synthetix was one of the OG Defi projects, right. Started off as a stablecoin, evolved into synthetic assets, and now is, is a perpetuals protocol. Been around for a long time and I think one of the longest running contracts on Ethereum at this point. But about a year ago, I sort of took a step back and was looking at the space and what was missing, what was there still to build? And the conclusion that I came to was that we built a lot of the infrastructure. The protocols were really robust. Aave uniswap, like all of the primitives that we need are there, but the thing that's still missing is ux.
00:01:06.434 - 00:01:44.534, Speaker B: And so we still have a lot of people that are living on centralized exchanges. They might be daily active users, but they're daily active users of coinbase or binance or bybit, and that there's a subset of on chain people, but the vast majority of even crypto natives late in the cycle are mainly using centralized exchanges. And so the idea was to build something that could replicate the centralized exchange ux. So have like very simple onboarding, simple deposit flow in and out of the platform. And so we built that now and we're just in the process of rolling it out.
00:01:44.662 - 00:01:45.086, Speaker A: Nice.
00:01:45.158 - 00:01:46.222, Speaker C: So congrats on that.
00:01:46.286 - 00:01:47.050, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:01:48.190 - 00:01:52.854, Speaker A: Do synthetix and Infinix interact at all or are they completely separate?
00:01:52.942 - 00:02:46.130, Speaker B: So the genesis of Infinix was actually synthetix. So the original idea was to build a wrapper that would replicate a synthetic centralized exchange on synthetix. The idea was that liquidity on decentralized exchanges has gotten to the point now where it can compete with centralized exchanges. But the UX was missing. But as we started building it and took probably like six to nine months, what I realized is that there was actually a much bigger opportunity, that the same thing is true for lending protocols and nfts and a lot of other things, that if we could build a UX layer on top of all of these on chain protocols, that it would be really valuable for everything. So rather than focusing on a narrow aspect of crypto like perpetuals, roll out everything. And so eventually we will integrate synthetix, but we're also integrating things like Jupiter.
00:02:46.130 - 00:02:53.000, Speaker B: And as I said, aave lending protocols Kamino, there's a bunch of different things we're looking to do.
00:02:53.110 - 00:02:53.572, Speaker A: Nice.
00:02:53.676 - 00:02:53.972, Speaker C: Okay.
00:02:53.996 - 00:02:56.092, Speaker A: And so Infinix now is in its.
00:02:56.156 - 00:02:59.476, Speaker C: Launch phase, which I understand has different.
00:02:59.628 - 00:03:01.732, Speaker A: Faces within it, right?
00:03:01.796 - 00:03:02.716, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right.
00:03:02.868 - 00:03:08.220, Speaker C: So there was this, the first part of it, which was, I think, like the waitlist.
00:03:08.340 - 00:03:10.460, Speaker B: Jump that speeder on the waitlist. Yeah.
00:03:10.500 - 00:03:10.876, Speaker A: Okay.
00:03:10.948 - 00:03:11.556, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:11.708 - 00:03:13.700, Speaker A: And so, yeah. How did that go?
00:03:13.740 - 00:03:19.104, Speaker C: Like how, how much TVL were you able to let attract? Like what were kind of the takeaways from it?
00:03:19.172 - 00:03:51.980, Speaker B: Yeah. So one interesting thing is we use passkeys for onboarding. We made a decision earlier in the year that, like, it was, the time was right to pivot to pass keys. So we don't have, you know, usernames and passwords or other auth methods. And that's meant that it's actually quite simple, resistant. It's hard to bot that. And so what we found is that in the first, I think ten days, we hit about 100 mil tvl, but that came from like 10,000 accounts.
00:03:51.980 - 00:04:09.200, Speaker B: So a lot of protocols you might have 100 mil tvl and like a million accounts. Right. Because people are just rolling out as many accounts as they can for a sybil, hoping for points or something like that. So we actually have a fairly small concentration of users, but still a very.
00:04:09.240 - 00:04:13.270, Speaker A: Good TVL and so can you.
00:04:13.930 - 00:04:43.222, Speaker C: I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you designed your launch process. Like your incentives point system. I saw that your governance system is with an NFT rather than a token. So I think that's all super interesting. And also you probably had the most experience with incentives, or maybe the longest since you were one of the first to do yield farming. Yield farming and consent. Yeah.
00:04:43.222 - 00:04:45.170, Speaker C: Like, I love your thinking around that.
00:04:45.750 - 00:05:15.950, Speaker B: I think I wanted to bring back something that was fun. Right. I got called out for referencing DeFi summer too much. So I won't reference DeFi summer. But I think the early incentive schemes, when DeFi even DeFi 1.0, and then there was that DeFi 2.0 phase, like Ohm and things like that, those incentive schemes were really fun and complex and interesting, and it wasn't clear what the best way to play it was.
00:05:15.950 - 00:05:49.840, Speaker B: Right. So there were these very interesting mechanism designs that meant that the game theory was complicated and fun and people were kind of discovering in real time, like, what's the best strategy? And there was a lot of disagreement. And I think that that creates interest. Right. People are like, if I don't know the opt, if the optimal way is just deposit some money across a thousand accounts and do a bunch of transaction washing or something. It's just not that interesting. It's going to be industrially farmed by bought swarms, basically.
00:05:49.840 - 00:06:33.032, Speaker B: Whereas if it's something that's a bit harder, a bit more confusing, and even, I think with crate realm, which is our current campaign, it's not actually that interesting to a bot farm. Right. Because it's not clear what the outcome's going to be. Even with points. There's sort of, you know, there's like whales market, there's things where you can go, okay, well, if I'm a bot farmer and I put this much money in, I can expect to get this much roi. Like, we've tried to design it so that it's a bit more opaque and a bit harder to understand, which, you know, from my personal experience of like, the OG yield farming days, that was really fun. We've also introduced something to make it a bit more random.
00:06:33.032 - 00:07:17.592, Speaker B: So we use the Pif entropy contract, which is a way of making it not as much of a whale game. So whales are getting more crates, so they have more opportunity. But we've had people that have opened 80 crates and gotten a patron NFT. And so the idea behind this whole campaign is basically to find the people who are engaged, who want to try new things, who want to participate in governance, want to do all of this fun stuff and find it interesting. Rather than basically paying for metrics and having bots just attack it. We want genuine users who are engaged. In order to do that, it has to be a bit fun.
00:07:17.592 - 00:07:55.928, Speaker B: We've done that. I think we've nailed it. And it is fun. As I said, we've had people that have opened adcrates and gotten something really cool out of it. What we're also doing is a token sale. So we're basically going to allow people to buy this governance NFT, which is an interesting approach and something that people haven't tried for a while. But my view is that if we gate that sale to people who are engaged, who are playing this game and who are farming access to that game, then it's a closed loop of very engaged users who can participate.
00:07:56.074 - 00:08:04.124, Speaker A: Okay, so you mentioned different things that I just want to clarify. So the crates, what are those?
00:08:04.292 - 00:08:05.948, Speaker B: Yeah, what are crates?
00:08:06.004 - 00:08:06.580, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:06.740 - 00:08:10.988, Speaker C: What does the NFT do? And then. Yeah, maybe more details on the token sale.
00:08:11.044 - 00:08:43.438, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think one of the critical things with governance is you want to be credibly neutral. Right. Interestingly, though, like, you know, when we were designing synthetix governance back in the day, you know, and this goes for like, maker and Aave. It's very narrowly focused. You're talking about parameterization around a DeFi protocol. Should we have this high of an interest rate or this much emissions or whatever, with something that's more like a wallet or a platform that will integrate a lot of different things, it's even more important to be credibly neutral.
00:08:43.438 - 00:09:23.846, Speaker B: You want protocol on Solana to feel like it's going to be treated the same as a protocol on Aptos or on Ethereum or arbitrum or optimism. And that requires a very broad distribution of governance. If you only have one narrow slice of the community, if it's just ETH maxis, it's going to be hard to get engagement from those other communities. We've tried really hard doing things like incentivizing meme coins. We launched with Solana support and we're rolling out support for other networks. The governance token is really designed to get as wide distribution of governance power as possible.
00:09:23.958 - 00:09:24.454, Speaker C: Interesting.
00:09:24.502 - 00:09:28.438, Speaker A: Okay, that's the idea. And then the crates. The crates are disagreeable.
00:09:28.574 - 00:09:29.366, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:29.558 - 00:09:55.022, Speaker B: So the idea was that we did a points farming campaign, like a classical. Classical. It's been around for 18 months or whatever. Points farming, where you were basically farming, like linear distribution of points. Right. And so the more TVL you put in, the more points you got, the more NFTs you got. We wanted to do something that added a bit more randomness and fun to it.
00:09:55.022 - 00:10:33.180, Speaker B: So we basically designed a system where you are farming crates. And crates have different probabilities of having prizes in them. So we've got prizes like pudgy penguins or little pudgies, I should say. We've got things like ETh and Sol meme coins. So if you are someone who doesn't necessarily have a lot of TVL, you still have a chance of getting, you know, of getting something, as opposed to having like a purely linear distribution where, you know, someone who puts in $5,000 versus someone who puts in $5 million is not going to have access.
00:10:34.160 - 00:10:41.064, Speaker A: So it's like, in addition to point, you're also giving out these crates that have like random prices.
00:10:41.112 - 00:10:47.882, Speaker B: Random prices in it. Yeah. And the price. So the crates are basically gating access to this token sale that we're doing. Right.
00:10:47.946 - 00:10:51.250, Speaker A: So is it like crate holders are the only ones who can buy the token?
00:10:51.290 - 00:10:51.770, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:10:51.850 - 00:10:52.218, Speaker C: Okay.
00:10:52.274 - 00:11:10.106, Speaker B: Yeah. So you have to have opened crates to be able to access it. And so we've got three different categories of, like, NFT related. We call it the patron NFT. So you can just win the NFt. So you can win governance tokens. If you're lucky and you open a crate and it's got a governance token in it, you've got that.
00:11:10.106 - 00:11:35.470, Speaker B: The other one is you get a pass, a mint passed, where if you have a mint pass, when the mint opens, you're guaranteed access to mint it. And the third one is a ticket, which is going to be kind of like a randomized draw of who will be able to mint, because NFT mints, you need to gate it some way. There's a finite number of nfts that can be minted and we need to make sure that the distribution is not captured by a small group of people, basically.
00:11:35.630 - 00:11:38.550, Speaker A: So why did you decide to make your governance token an NFT?
00:11:38.710 - 00:12:14.790, Speaker B: Good question. I think there are probably a couple of reasons. I wanted something that was going to be at the beginning as purely governance related as possible. And one of the nice things about nfts is that they don't really trade. There's marketplaces like Opensea and Blur, but they're not listed on exchanges. It's not as easy for it to turn into a speculative instrument. It's really just there to be something that governs the platform.
00:12:14.790 - 00:12:46.996, Speaker B: And again, in the early days especially, we need the platform to be credibly neutral. So the people who are holding the governance token are really focused on which of these integrations are we choosing, especially when it comes to conflicts of interest. I'm an s and x holder. Are we going to integrate synthetix or are we going to integrate hyper liquid or GMx or DyDx? We need to make sure that that governance power is distributed so that those decisions are, you know, are fair, basically, and that we're like looking at all of the things on the merit.
00:12:47.068 - 00:12:48.924, Speaker A: How many nfts will you issue?
00:12:49.012 - 00:13:01.320, Speaker B: There's 100,000. And of those in the token sale, there will be, depending on the way that it plays out, I think somewhere between 45,060 thousand will be sold.
00:13:01.740 - 00:13:02.508, Speaker C: Okay.
00:13:02.644 - 00:13:04.356, Speaker A: And the rest you'll have in your treasury?
00:13:04.428 - 00:13:15.030, Speaker B: Yeah, it'll be treasury distribution team distribution incentives. We did some air dropping stuff. There's a token distribution chart that's available.
00:13:16.290 - 00:13:18.706, Speaker A: What's the timeline for the token sale?
00:13:18.818 - 00:13:45.436, Speaker B: Good question. There isn't a fixed date right now. So we have governance process. We've got a council based governance. I'm sure you're not surprised to hear that. So the process of deciding all of the final components of the sale is still happening. I think there was a governance proposal that passed a couple of weeks ago, that finalized the distribution, but not the actual timeline.
00:13:45.436 - 00:13:49.788, Speaker B: So if I had to guess, I would say, like late August, early September, or something like that.
00:13:49.804 - 00:13:50.092, Speaker C: Oh, okay.
00:13:50.116 - 00:13:50.916, Speaker A: But pretty soon.
00:13:50.988 - 00:13:53.292, Speaker B: Pretty soon, yeah, yeah. Like this year for sure. Yeah.
00:13:53.476 - 00:14:29.336, Speaker A: Ckverify is revolutionizing how proofs are verified, making web3 networks faster and more efficient. At its core is a modular system designed to decouple proof verification from execution and settlement layers, offloading the heavy lifting of proof verification to a separate network. Ckverify cuts down the associated cost by over 90%, offering huge savings and a more robust network performance for web3 networks. And it is live on Testnet. Visit their website today to learn more. After that, will you start rolling out your integrations?
00:14:29.368 - 00:15:08.276, Speaker B: Integrations, exactly. Yeah. So there's a method to the madness, I think, of, like, doing this first before we do the integrations. If we have that wide distribution and we have the governance distributed to people who get what we're trying to do, like, get the vision early, I think that's the optimal. Those are the people that are there for the right reasons. I guess if we go and do a bunch of integrations and things go really well, then you get back into the speculative aspect of the project's doing really well. And so I want to participate, et cetera.
00:15:08.276 - 00:15:17.128, Speaker B: So we're trying to balance, you know, getting the right people in who are like, we see what you're doing. Right. We see, you know, we want to be participating in this thing.
00:15:17.184 - 00:15:17.424, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:17.472 - 00:15:24.580, Speaker A: Makes sense. Okay. And then do you have a plan for what you want to roll out first?
00:15:24.960 - 00:16:06.210, Speaker B: So there's already a couple of integrations that are supported that were needed for, like, platform level things. So wormhole and curve are both supported for our, like. So it's non custodial. And the way that we have set it up is that if, for example, all of our infrastructure, there's a whole bunch of off chain infrastructure to support this, if that infra is nuked and just disappears, your funds are in a smart account that is yours. They're not commingled. Like, you have a smart account that's across six chains right now and eventually could be on 20 chains. So you might have assets spread across multiple different chains doing different things.
00:16:06.210 - 00:16:47.200, Speaker B: We need for you to be able to turn up and execute directly on those contracts a withdrawal call so that you can get all your funds out even if we're not there. Right. We don't want there to be any chance of censorship or whatever. It has to be purely non custodial and so setting things up in that way has meant that we need curve to be able to swap everything out into USDC. So if you've got different stable coins, we need to be able to go to a stable pool and swap it because we use CCTP and wormhole to basically extract all of the funds across all those chains and bridge them back to. For you, it might be mainnet. You're like, I want to be on main net.
00:16:47.200 - 00:17:22.680, Speaker B: And so you literally go and make that function, call on all the contracts, roll it all up into USDC and pull it out. We've got some integrations that were required for platform support. Then we've got some other stuff that's in R and D, like Jupyter on Solana. So we have a Solana team that have been doing a bunch of integration work. We've got some other stuff that's being worked on. Nothing is approved yet through governance, so it's all kind of in the R and D phase. But I think for us to be able to compete with a centralized exchange, there's certain functionality we need to have.
00:17:22.680 - 00:17:37.604, Speaker B: So we need to have spot, we need to have perps, we need to probably have some staking, we need to have maybe lending or margin, the ability to deposit into Aave or something like that. Once we've got that core functionality, then we can start doing the fun stuff.
00:17:37.692 - 00:17:42.764, Speaker A: Okay, can you explain a bit more.
00:17:42.812 - 00:17:56.996, Speaker C: What just the broader vision of Infinix is? So I understand, okay. It's a non custodial account that allows users to access to different defi apps wherever they are.
00:17:57.028 - 00:17:57.196, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:57.228 - 00:18:08.772, Speaker C: Like on whatever chain, multi chain dapps. So, yeah, if this goes well, what does this look like in a few years from now?
00:18:08.876 - 00:18:54.262, Speaker B: So I think that we finally have all the infrastructure that we need to be able to compete with the centralized exchange. For the last decade and a half since Mount Gox, basically the vast majority of crypto activity has happened off chain in a database. Now, there's very good reasons for that, and I think that there are advantages to being in a centralized exchange around security for a user who is not comfortable with self custody. But the tech is now there where we can give people self custody and also security. We can stop you from rugging yourself, but we can ensure that no one can rug you. For me, it was probably FTX. That really was the tipping point where I was like, FTX blew up and everyone was like, yolo back to Binance.
00:18:54.262 - 00:19:36.932, Speaker B: And it was like, wow, no, this is not okay. You can't have this giant fraud where a bunch of people's money is stolen, and then people just hop over to a different centralized exchange. We have to do something better. And just hoping that everyone's going to get hardware wallets. It hasn't worked yet and it's not there. So my view is that in the later part of this cycle, as new people come, right now, this is all crypto native people, but as the cycle progresses, we will have new people turning up. My goal is that when a new person turns up and your friend from high school is like, I want to buy some bitcoin.
00:19:36.932 - 00:20:31.740, Speaker B: Instead of saying go in self custody and get a ledger or whatever, or instead of saying go to Coinbase, you can say go to infidex, because it's self custodial. You don't need to worry about someone stealing your money, but also you can be confident that they won't make a mistake that will cause them to lose their funds. That's the goal. If we can do that, and we can get hundreds of thousands of new users onboarded and have a bunch of assets in the platform, then we have distribution power in a way that wallets have never really had before. Metamask has this a little bit with metamask swaps, but Metamask can't really point you at Aave. It certainly can't point you at some novel new DeFi primitive that's emerged. If we have that distribution power, I think it's going to be an incredible thing for new protocols that are emerging where we can actually point attention at them.
00:20:31.740 - 00:21:18.620, Speaker B: If you think about the distribution power that, say, Binance has had for the last five or six years, all of that distribution power is about token price. If you're, I don't know, I'll pick a random token that won't be triggering. If you're, let's say, doge, binance can point attention at Doge, the token for the token price, but it's not going to do anything for the chain of, it's not creating activity on Doge. Chain doesn't do anything. But if we're trying to have active users and have activity or build DeFi, Binance doesn't care about that. They just care about token price. They can point attention at the token and make the number go up, but that's it.
00:21:18.620 - 00:21:39.170, Speaker B: If you have a wallet that has the ability to point attention not at the token, but at the actual protocol, then all of a sudden you've got a very powerful distribution mechanism. And so that's the long term vision, is to be able to help new protocols to bootstrap and to be able to ensure that new entrants are doing things on chain and not in someone's database.
00:21:39.510 - 00:22:58.424, Speaker C: It's interesting that it seems that you want to compete with centralized exchanges as like an unwrap onto crypto, but at the same time you're also replacing the function of non custodial wallets, which have been the way, like the gateway to DeFi, but like you said, in not a very organized way. It's more kind of up to the user where they want to go, but you want to create more visibility for all of the different DeFi protocols out there. So it's like a really ambitious vision. It is, but it's also trying to do so much right. So on the on ramp side of things, how can you compete with centralized exchanges in terms of just like ease of use and also security, like you mentioned? Like, that's a big part of it, but for newbies, I don't know, it's just like, it's hard to get people to, you know, take care of their own seed phrase and just deal with the whole on chain experience. So how are you?
00:22:58.512 - 00:23:34.160, Speaker B: How do we do that? We abstracted away completely. There's no gas, there's no seed phrases. We use pass keys, so we think the pass keys are ready now. And if you think about what pass keys are, it's really like web3 tech that's been brought back into web two. You have a cryptographic token that represents your identity that's stored in a hardware device in a secure enclave, and it is not fishable. You're not going to accidentally write it down and lose it or put it into LastPass or something like that. It is a cryptographic token that you can store somewhere.
00:23:35.020 - 00:23:36.972, Speaker A: It's like a physical device.
00:23:37.076 - 00:24:12.170, Speaker B: It can be on a physical device. A passkey can be stored on a yubikey, but your iPhone has the ability to store a passkey in like, you know, icloud basically. Like on a, you know, it can, it can be a cloud based system, but it's also stored in the secure enclave of the phone itself. Right. And so you can't have someone trick you into going to, you know, uniswap with like a one instead, you know, like that sort of all of those games that people play with like phishing sites and phishing links. It's not possible. You can't be phished.
00:24:12.170 - 00:24:40.158, Speaker B: So that cuts out a lot of that. You also can't be tricked into writing down your seed phrase and giving it to someone. You can't accidentally give them your private key. So there's a whole bunch of things. And the people who are designing this are Apple, Microsoft, Google. They've got resources to make sure that this is, and they've got the incentives to make sure that this is the most secure way. And all of a sudden you have all of the incentives in large players aligned to solve this problem.
00:24:40.158 - 00:25:09.786, Speaker B: And we're just tapping into it. We're saying, let's leverage that tech, bring it across into crypto and allow you to have a passkey that unlocks a private key. And so we use Turnkey, which is built by the same people who built Coinbase custody. They have secure private key storage that's non custodial. We are able to unlock your private key with your passkey that's in your iPhone. And you can now do transactions via turnkey. You don't need to write down a seed phrase.
00:25:09.786 - 00:25:40.758, Speaker B: You don't need to chisel it in stone and bury it in your backyard. You don't need any of that crazy stuff. And so for the average user, when you log into infinex, you just pull up a web page, you click login, it finds your passkey on your device or in your password manager or whatever. You can log in, cross device. You can go to your laptop and through iCloud, log in. You don't need to plug in a hardware wallet or anything like that. You certainly don't need to sign in by signing a transaction or whatever.
00:25:40.758 - 00:26:03.430, Speaker B: Once you're in, you just click a button and we've got all gases abstracted, all bridging, all chains. You just click a button and do the thing. The actual UX is much more similar to a centralized exchange. It's web two ux. Click a button, thing happens. You click a different button, a different thing happens. It's much easier.
00:26:03.430 - 00:26:06.326, Speaker B: You don't get signing prompts and all that sort of stuff.
00:26:06.358 - 00:26:10.216, Speaker A: Awesome. So you'll be subsidizing all gas for you.
00:26:10.248 - 00:26:37.208, Speaker B: So this is the funny thing, right? Everyone asks that question, they're like, but who's paying for the gas? The gas is so cheap. Like, it is crazy how cheap it is. Now we put people in the places where things are cheapest, right? So a lot of our computation for some of the crate campaigns, like we have 5 million crates, we've had tens of thousands of crate opening transactions. We've used like ten k of gas. Gas is a solved problem now, right?
00:26:37.304 - 00:26:42.152, Speaker A: But like, what if, like, governance votes to add some ethereum mainnet for sure.
00:26:42.216 - 00:27:23.350, Speaker B: So absolutely if people are doing things on Mainnet, then it becomes more expensive. Right? But my view is that the people who are still on Mainnet are mainly whales, right? Like most people have migrated off to other places. Right. If you're a whale and you want to deposit $50 million into infinex, we'll pay the $100 for you to do that. That's a valuable user. The ROI is proportional to the assets the person's depositing. And the good thing is, once the assets are on infinix, then we can help you to actually make sure that you're doing the transaction in the place where you should be doing it, on arbitrum or optimism or base or blast or wherever that thing is.
00:27:23.350 - 00:27:55.088, Speaker B: Because people, and I put myself in this category, who have been around for a long time, are still on Mainnet. Most of my assets are still on Mainnet in a nosis safe. So if I were able to deposit into Infinix and very easily do things on other chains, I'd be more likely to do it. So we can help to ease the whales off main net, their main net addiction, and into l two s. But even still. Even factoring in Mainnet, mainnet gas prices have gone down because everyone is overdevelop on l two.
00:27:55.104 - 00:27:56.200, Speaker C: It's such an interesting choice.
00:27:56.280 - 00:28:04.664, Speaker B: We've spent literally, like, ten grand on gas, and we've done thousands and thousands of transactions, like flowing contracts everywhere. It's genuinely a solved problem.
00:28:04.792 - 00:28:26.500, Speaker D: Protocol 20 introduces Sorbonne, which is stellar's cutting edge smart contracts platform. This creates new surface area for innovation and provides new opportunities for developers to build protocols and products that create access to everyday financial services. So it means a gradual increase in transaction capacity and a chance to fine tune applications. And it's the most transformative upgrade to the stellar network to date.
00:28:27.960 - 00:28:30.460, Speaker A: Okay, and then how do you make money?
00:28:30.920 - 00:28:32.260, Speaker C: Like, a good question.
00:28:34.080 - 00:29:06.552, Speaker B: At the moment, making money is not the end goal, right. At the moment, it's about distribution. So we want to create as much incentive as possible for people to sign up. You know, this is a very straightforward growth proposition, right? So you want to subsidize growth. We don't want to add any friction. This is the interesting thing about gas prices is like, going from, say, ten cents to one cent to a tenth of a cent. There's a quantitative change there, right? Like, okay, $0.10
00:29:06.552 - 00:29:33.102, Speaker B: feels like. Now I got to think about it. One cent to a tenth of a cent. You don't need to think about it, but there's still a psychological cost to having to think, okay, I'm paying for this transaction, right? If you remove that completely, you just click a button and do the thing. At a 10th of a cent. You can click buttons all day, like, you're not going to burn any money, but it just allows you to do the thing, and it becomes psychologically much less friction. Right.
00:29:33.102 - 00:30:23.334, Speaker B: You're not presented with a choice of, do I want to do this? Do I want to spend the 10th of a cent to do it? Like, yes, you click the button, you want to do it. If we abstract that away, especially if we then abstract away moving between different chains, we just put people in the place where they should be. And it's funny, I was on a podcast in the Solana ecosystem a couple weeks ago, and I was explaining how the Solana deposit on the Solana contracts that the person had made was actually allowing them to farm on base. And they were like, I don't know if I like, but it was so abstracted that it wasn't even clear. They were like, but I deposited on Solana. Why is it doing something over here? We are able to do things by abstracting this away, where you can deposit on arbitrum and you can be playing a game on blast, and you don't even need to worry about that. It's not your problem.
00:30:23.334 - 00:30:52.150, Speaker B: You shouldn't care. You should just care that I want to do this thing. The tech is there, and it's been there for the last year, I would say, to be able to do this, but it just needed someone to have the incentive to put it all together. Having built a protocol and seen how painful building UX is for many years, I felt like I was in a pretty good position to start from the UX layer and move back, rather than starting from protocol and trying to move up into UX.
00:30:52.810 - 00:30:58.322, Speaker A: Sounds super interesting. Yeah. Excited to see how this all looks and feels.
00:30:58.346 - 00:31:07.710, Speaker C: But, I mean, like, the way you're describing it, it does feel like a huge improvement from what we have today in Defi.
00:31:08.370 - 00:31:40.300, Speaker B: It's really interesting because there's two groups of people right now that we're talking to. One is someone who's actually used the platform, and then the other is someone who's, like, heard about it, and it's, like, conceptually interesting. The difference is, like, crazy. Once someone's used it, they're like, this is amazing. So we've been trying to, like anything in crypto. It's hard to get people's attention, everyone's attention poor, everyone's time poor. So we've been really working hard to do things that don't scale and like, literally onboard people one by one by one by one.
00:31:40.300 - 00:31:48.286, Speaker B: And we've got a bunch of people at ECC running around onboarding people because it is like a zero to one moment.
00:31:48.398 - 00:31:51.370, Speaker A: But like you right now, what can you do?
00:31:52.670 - 00:32:11.576, Speaker B: You can play this yield farming game. That's it. You can't actually do transactions. You can't do that stuff. You can just play. But the actual platform is the product right now, the platform itself, when you do it. And you realize, oh, I can pick up my phone and log in and then, oh, I'm at my laptop and I can log in and check to see what's happening.
00:32:11.576 - 00:32:37.792, Speaker B: It's an aha moment. You're like, of course, there's no other thing that you do except in crypto where you log into Gmail and then you go to another device and you're like, oh, I can't log into Gmail. I don't have my hard work here. Whatever. You're just used to being able to access a cloud based platform on any device. And Infinix right now solves that. You can literally go to any device and just log in.
00:32:37.792 - 00:32:48.560, Speaker B: And if it's in your iCloud or if you're using Android, like, Android shares poskies around and it's just getting better and better as well.
00:32:49.780 - 00:32:59.132, Speaker A: Okay, so it sounds like your perspective on crypto UX and how to get.
00:32:59.156 - 00:33:48.566, Speaker C: It to mainstream is that it really doesn't need to feel like any other application on the Internet because there's a, there's been this debate that's been ongoing for years that's like, okay, what does crypto UX look like? Should crypto just embrace its weirdness? And people should maybe just get used to this new paradigm. And I think this is an interesting perspective too. That's like, no, this is something that's different. So we should be upfront about it and people interacting with, like, confirming transactions, paying gas just tells people what they're doing and there's more transparency and then there's kind of the other side of the debate, which looks like what you're taking is, no, it just needs to be as simple as possible.
00:33:48.718 - 00:34:09.082, Speaker B: Well, I've gone back and forth on this in fairness, right? You can definitely search and find tweets where I'm like, no, it's good that people are signing transactions. Honestly, that was cope. Like I had no other choice. What else can I say? We had to sign transactions. We had no way to abstract away signing. Right? So if you go back to like 2020, 2021. I'm sure I was saying all kinds of crazy stuff.
00:34:09.082 - 00:34:48.240, Speaker B: The UX, honestly, is in the ability to do something permissionlessly with money, right? The fact that you can take money and you can put it into Aave and you can borrow a different asset and you can do things like that in this decentralized platform. That's the UX. Like, that's the job to be done, right? Like that's the thing that a person wants to do, forcing them to go through weird hoops and sign things. Honestly, it's cope, it's not needed. If I want to put some USDC in Aave and borrow some ETH and I can click a button and do it, that's just better. Ux. There is no possible justification for it.
00:34:48.240 - 00:35:47.538, Speaker B: You could say maybe back in the day that it's important for people to understand what's happening in the background. But I also think that's wrong. I've come to the belief that that's wrong. People don't need a. I don't understand how Cloudflare works at a very fundamental level. They're load balancing distribution and they've got data. Could I sit there for three months and read about how their architecture is set up in a way to have all of these different failover nodes and everything? Yes, but why? Why? To what end? Why would I be doing that when I can deploy something to Cloudflare and know that no matter where someone is in the world that it's going to be performant and that it will scale based on, like, that's their job, right? And so, you know, and that's me as like, someone who has a need for infrastructure, right? And I still shouldn't need to know as a consumer of infrastructure services, how that infrastructure is working.
00:35:47.538 - 00:36:21.478, Speaker B: Like, that's their job, right? The idea that like, an end consumer should understand how Cloudflare works is madness, right? And so, you know, when there was no choice, when people had to be on boarded via seed phrases and all of this stuff, then yes, then I agree. Right? If you're taking a huge risk, we need to make sure that you understand the risk. But if you're not taking a huge risk, if you're using a passkey, which is the same exact way that you log into Facebook or Twitter or gmail, then no, you don't need to know how it works. You just log in and do the thing.

00:36:49.180 - 00:37:11.132, Speaker C: Switching gears a bit to synthetics for a little bit. Want to get your perspective on what's happening? There was looking at TVL recently, and it had climbed to about a billion earlier this year, but now it's declined to about 300 million. So what's explaining that?
00:37:11.276 - 00:37:48.742, Speaker B: Honestly, I really don't pay attention to synthetics that much. I say that in all seriousness, I don't have time. Like, I'm back to working 80 hours a week again, and it's early stage startup grind. I've had a couple of conversations with people recently, but it's not my focus. There are other people running it. I probably got some opinions about some things and timing of when things should happen. I think the most interesting thing for us at Infinix is which network, because now Synthetix is on arbitrum.
00:37:48.742 - 00:38:15.808, Speaker B: And so there's a genuine choice of optimism. Arbitrum base, infinix sort of needs to choose the network, and there's different trade offs around the way that they're setting up each of these different configurations and what the collateral is. So as we get closer to potentially integrating synthetix, we'll need to make some calls. But synthetix is its own thing and it runs and it's got a robust governance framework. Doesn't need me at this point.
00:38:15.904 - 00:38:16.624, Speaker A: Oh, okay.
00:38:16.672 - 00:38:17.208, Speaker C: Interesting.
00:38:17.264 - 00:38:17.832, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:17.976 - 00:38:24.700, Speaker A: Okay. And then last, a couple of questions on just defi more broadly.
00:38:25.440 - 00:38:38.340, Speaker C: So what are you seeing that's exciting right now? Like, what's anything, like any innovation that has come up or that hasn't? Maybe. Like, maybe. Yeah, like, what are you excited about?
00:38:39.120 - 00:39:25.690, Speaker B: I'm excited to actually get people using Defi. Like the subset of people who are crypto, people who've actually used Defi and done on chain transactions is like less than 10%. Right. We, I think, have had a long period of time where like, we're in the late part of last cycle, I was looking around going like, everyone's still on binance. We haven't actually brought them on chain. Nfts did. NFTs did a good job of getting people to install metamask and do all of that stuff because Opensea was able to get traction before the centralized exchanges were able to stand up NFT marketplaces, which had good sides and bad sides.
00:39:25.690 - 00:39:52.670, Speaker B: But I'm excited for people to try DeFi. There are a lot of people out there who have not tried all the DeFi projects. They haven't played around with curve or uniswap or whatever. We've got amazing protocols, and they're really robust. They've had years of Lindy, they're hardened, they work really well, and it's time to make sure that everyone feels comfortable using them.
00:39:53.210 - 00:39:58.202, Speaker A: So do you think DeFi is ready for a more mainstream 100%?
00:39:58.346 - 00:40:14.786, Speaker B: Sorry. It's ready. At the protocol level, the protocols are ready. Liquidity is there. You can put tens of millions of dollars into Aave for the average user. Like more than enough, right? Like, you know, most people are not dumping $10 million worth of ETH into AavE, right. For the average user, it works.
00:40:14.786 - 00:40:35.998, Speaker B: For the average user, it's cheap. Transaction, execution is cheap. You know, we've got multiple l two s. Liquidity is good, spreads are still tight. Even, you know, even lately, it's a UX issue. We haven't created the onboarding process. You know, these are crypto native people that have crypto.
00:40:35.998 - 00:40:55.286, Speaker B: They've got crypto on centralized exchanges. It's a very easy hop for them to withdraw some USDT or USDC or ETH from binance into Infinix and now suddenly have access to all of these different protocols in a way that they haven't to date. So I think it's ready, but it does need that UX layer, and so that's what we're trying to build.
00:40:55.478 - 00:41:06.020, Speaker A: What do you think will be the thing that gets centralized exchange users excited about defi? Like what's the use case?
00:41:06.720 - 00:41:52.150, Speaker B: I think that there, speculation is still the thing, right? Like the people who are on centralized exchanges right now are there for speculation. We have, I would argue, more fun, speculative things to do in deFi. Certainly more efficient ways to do things, right, cheaper ways to do things, more efficient ways of getting leverage, et cetera. So there are a whole range of things that I'm sure people would love to play around with on chain, but for whatever reason, don't feel comfortable. I'm sure there's still people who are waiting for the latest meme coin or whatever to get listed on binance before they decide to buy it. You can go to pump fun. The source is there.
00:41:52.150 - 00:42:24.930, Speaker B: So whether or not you think that that's a good use of people time, if people want speculation, that's one of the use cases. And until we can pull people off centralized exchanges and get everyone on chain and have self custody, I think we just haven't done our job from a Defi perspective. And so I feel a very strong obligation as an early Defi founder. The job's not done yet. Building the protocol is not enough. You need to actually bring it to the people. We waited and waited and waited and hoped that they would come, and they didn't have.
00:42:24.930 - 00:42:31.040, Speaker B: It's, you know, like, the path forward is obvious, right. We need to go to them.
00:42:31.700 - 00:43:12.072, Speaker C: So, okay, so for holders, crypto holders, and centralized exchanges, I think you're totally right. People are there to speculate. So how do we get users who are probably, maybe not even on centralized exchanges, just like regular people who need access to financial services? Maybe they're in emerging economies, maybe they need access to stablecoins, or maybe they need to take out a loan and they don't have good credit, or maybe avid would be a good place to be, but they have no idea how to use it. How do we get to those people?
00:43:12.176 - 00:43:36.506, Speaker B: I think for someone who doesn't have crypto, getting on chain still requires an on ramp. You still need fiat on ramps and off ramps. There are, you know, I built an on ramp. Right. You know, back in the day, we allowed people to buy bitcoin with cash, right, from like, 2015. So I know what that looks like. I know the challenges of that we need to first prove, in my view.
00:43:36.506 - 00:44:26.816, Speaker B: Right. Certainly this is my view on Infidex. Right. Infinix needs to prove that we work for existing binance users who have crypto. If we can't convince them to move over and that the UX is better and that being on chain is better, we haven't really demonstrated that we should be doing stuff for retail users who are not in the crypto ecosystem. If we can solve that problem, and we can genuinely bring people on chain and have the majority of people in crypto doing things on chain instead of doing something in someone's database, then I think we can start to have the conversation about how do we go and solve emerging markets and stablecoin and payment rails. I think we have all, for a very long time, had a view that international remittance is a thing that should happen in stablecoins, et cetera, but it's hard to do it through a centralized exchange.
00:44:26.816 - 00:45:12.698, Speaker B: You need on ramps. There's still friction. We're not going to solve every problem, but if we can solve the onboarding and Ux and security and self custody problems, I think a whole bunch of people will turn up at the last mile to solve those problems. There's not really an incentive right now to try. There's a lot of different on ramps who are doing a good job, but the addressable market is still too small. I think that if we can really make a credible case that we are as easy to use as Facebook and that genuinely people can get crypto and do things in crypto safely for a billion people, the last mile of how to get in and out, that problem will be solved very quickly. The incentive will be there, but it's just not been there.
00:45:12.698 - 00:45:14.910, Speaker B: We're in our own little bubble at the moment.
00:45:15.070 - 00:45:23.134, Speaker A: Okay, so success for you looks like getting people from Binance onto Infinix first.
00:45:23.222 - 00:45:34.910, Speaker B: Yes. That's step one. If we can't do that, we haven't earned anything else. Right. If we can't convince someone who is trading on binance daily to move on chain, then we haven't done the job.
00:45:35.030 - 00:45:36.090, Speaker A: Right. Okay.
00:45:37.110 - 00:45:46.420, Speaker C: And then for kind of the next few months, where do you expect to be in that goal?
00:45:47.360 - 00:46:28.680, Speaker B: I think we expect to get through this bootstrapping phase, the kind of growth phase and early adoption, early enthusiast people who really want to participate and feel strongly about different trade offs in security, et cetera, we want to get all those people engaged. Advocates. Those are the people that say, yes, I've read through the source code and, like, this is truly non custodial. Right. If you don't have those people's attention, they're the ones who are on x talking about different trade offs and making recommendations of what's safe, what's not. You need that group of people. If we don't have them, it's hard to then go out to the wider crypto market.
00:46:28.680 - 00:47:03.120, Speaker B: But if we can get that and we can get people engaged and really validate that this, this is actually the right set of trade offs, because everything is trade offs. And they're definitely trade offs that we're making. But if people come to the conclusion that this makes sense, then we can start rolling out integrations. The integrations that we'll probably start off with is spot trading. Centralized exchanges all emerged out of spot trading. If we can do that, I think that the competitive advantage we have is we can tap into everything that's on chain. We don't need to go and build infra for all of this stuff.
00:47:03.120 - 00:47:11.280, Speaker B: Right. If there's some new novel thing, we can just plug straight into it and let people, you know, that's the benefit of having an on chain backend.
00:47:11.360 - 00:47:11.648, Speaker A: Right.
00:47:11.704 - 00:47:23.740, Speaker B: Because our backend is on chain. We have access to everything that's on chain. Finance can't do that. You know, it takes a long time for them to take something that's on chain and bolt it into their centralized, you know, ecosystem.
00:47:24.280 - 00:47:32.306, Speaker A: Nice. Okay, well, this has been amazing. To learn more about Infinix, and we'll be following and covering it on the defiance.
00:47:32.378 - 00:47:34.034, Speaker B: Amazing. Thanks for having me.
00:47:34.082 - 00:47:34.490, Speaker A: Yeah, of course.
