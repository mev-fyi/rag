00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:04.690 - 00:00:07.834, Speaker B: Welcome Robin and ALB to the defiant podcast.
00:00:07.882 - 00:00:08.480, Speaker C: No.
00:00:08.850 - 00:00:16.814, Speaker A: Welcome, Camilla, to HQ D 20. D 20.
00:00:16.852 - 00:00:17.662, Speaker C: That's. That's the.
00:00:17.716 - 00:00:20.842, Speaker A: The home of defiant video production. Welcome Camilla Russo.
00:00:20.906 - 00:00:45.740, Speaker B: No, it's amazing to be here. Like, my mind was blown and like I told you guys, I already had really high expectations. So thank you for building such an amazing space. So for you guys listening, this is the first time that I've been to the defiant video studio since it's been over a year that we've been making videos together.
00:00:46.910 - 00:00:50.182, Speaker A: I think it's a year and a half since we were doing it with Harmony.
00:00:50.246 - 00:00:52.238, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. And you were here.
00:00:52.324 - 00:01:08.986, Speaker A: And we were already here. Yeah. So AlP and I carved this from bedrock, basically with our bare hands. Just me, pickaxe, a loincloth and just hammering away lots of tools. And then we carved out enough space to shoot YouTube videos in.
00:01:09.028 - 00:01:12.910, Speaker C: Yeah, pretty much in this space in the middle of nowhere.
00:01:12.990 - 00:01:14.834, Speaker A: It doesn't work if you don't speak into the mic.
00:01:14.952 - 00:01:23.058, Speaker C: Yeah, we're really out there in Holland in an industrial. Yeah, it's.
00:01:23.074 - 00:01:48.830, Speaker B: It's an amazing space and such a treat to be able to shoot the podcast kind of with all this gear. As you guys who follow the podcast know, it's basically just like, me and one tiny camera and my yeti mic and that's it. And now it's like, wow, like, the pros do it. So really excited to be here with you guys.
00:01:48.980 - 00:02:03.700, Speaker A: Well, we might be pros, but I forgot to switch the video to us because we've got a little video switcher here and we never use it, but we're using it today and I completely forgot to switch the video. It's just you nodding at us as we talk.
00:02:04.390 - 00:02:31.680, Speaker B: Work in progress. Anyway, yeah, it'll be okay. Okay. So I'd love to start by hearing the Robin and Alp, or ALp and Robin story. How did you guys come to work together? And like you were mentioning before, this partnership predates the defiance. So how did that happen?
00:02:32.450 - 00:02:44.270, Speaker C: Well, I received an email saying, ola filmmaker in October 2019. And did you flip back to us, actually, or not?
00:02:44.340 - 00:02:44.718, Speaker A: No.
00:02:44.804 - 00:02:45.674, Speaker C: Well, we have to flip.
00:02:45.722 - 00:02:47.578, Speaker A: I was so bad. Did.
00:02:47.604 - 00:02:49.506, Speaker C: Your finger was there. You didn't flip it.
00:02:49.608 - 00:02:54.354, Speaker A: I've just fallen asleep. If you speak faster, I'll get there and I'll be able to do.
00:02:54.392 - 00:03:12.262, Speaker C: Okay. Okay. So, yeah, I received an email. I forgot the contents of it, but he was trying to do something with crypto and stuff like that. And I said, okay, I'm down. I'd like to hear more. And then we met in the Hague in a cafe, and he asked me about how much I know about blockchain.
00:03:12.262 - 00:03:18.620, Speaker C: And I said, there's something to do with mining and coins and hard math problems and stuff like. And.
00:03:20.670 - 00:03:22.330, Speaker A: Did you lose your train of thought?
00:03:22.480 - 00:03:22.874, Speaker C: I did.
00:03:22.912 - 00:03:23.786, Speaker B: I think you should pick it up.
00:03:23.808 - 00:03:24.414, Speaker C: You can pick it up.
00:03:24.452 - 00:03:29.310, Speaker B: I wonder why. So, Robin, why did you decide to email alp?
00:03:29.650 - 00:04:09.830, Speaker A: So I was working for Harmony at the time, and what I had pitched to Harmony was a YouTube channel making videos because I believed that crypto in general had very bad videos across the board. No one was really able to tell the story of this space. And particularly when you had a brand like Harmony's that was attempting to disrupt the Ethereum audience or the Ethereum model. What they said needed to be really clear, and it needed to be done in a way that was distinctive and bingeable. I guess that was the idea. So I started making videos for harmony. I bought a camera and it very quickly realized that I needed someone to do it with, because doing it on your own sucks.
00:04:09.830 - 00:04:38.766, Speaker A: Basically my background's film and having larger productions. So there was a bit of a culture shock. Firstly putting myself in front of the camera, but also just having to do everything by yourself. So I realized it would be much easier if I had someone to work with, someone I could edit with. And I needed to find someone who was interested in YouTube. But also it couldn't just be someone who already worked in the space. There was a very specific set of criteria.
00:04:38.766 - 00:04:52.106, Speaker A: I knew I needed to train someone up and they needed to be kind of fresh to this and come with their own ideas. So I went and had a coffee with Alp and we got on and we just kind of actually, we nerded out over this lens. Bizarrely enough, I brought it with me.
00:04:52.128 - 00:04:52.570, Speaker B: Oh, really?
00:04:52.640 - 00:05:13.758, Speaker A: Yeah. This is a probe lens. No, you don't put it there. But basically this is a macro lens. It's a very specialized piece of equipment and it had just come out and we never use it, but it's a very cool thing. So we noted out over that and then we realized that we kind of had the same similar kind of crazy sense of humor. And I basically said, come and work with me.
00:05:13.758 - 00:05:18.100, Speaker A: And he said, yes. And that was how that began. And then what happened next?
00:05:18.710 - 00:05:29.574, Speaker B: Wait, but how did you know to email him? Did you just look in a database of Amsterdam video editors or random name.
00:05:29.612 - 00:05:34.150, Speaker C: Generator and then you@gmail.com. And then I just received that.
00:05:34.300 - 00:05:48.570, Speaker A: No, it was a referral by a friend, someone who'd been working with us on a piece of communications for harmony. I just happened to mention I was looking for someone and he said, oh, yeah, my flatmate is up for doing stuff like this. That's how that happened.
00:05:48.640 - 00:05:48.970, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:05:49.040 - 00:05:51.020, Speaker A: Yeah, you met him yesterday. Yes.
00:05:51.790 - 00:05:53.526, Speaker C: Shout out to Eva Lanan.
00:05:53.638 - 00:05:55.314, Speaker A: Shout out to Eva Lanin.
00:05:55.462 - 00:06:00.240, Speaker B: He's the connector here. Made this duo happen.
00:06:01.170 - 00:06:05.654, Speaker A: Yeah, he's the connective tissue. That's what we shall call him from now on. Mr. Connective tissue.
00:06:05.722 - 00:06:23.650, Speaker B: Yes, you are the connective tissue, Alf. And did you have any kind of previous experience with crypto before? What was your initial kind of experience? Walking into making videos for harmony? Did you have to learn everything from scratch?
00:06:23.810 - 00:06:56.658, Speaker C: Yeah, basically, like coming into harmony protocol. I only maybe just heard about bitcoin a couple of times. And, yeah, I had to learn everything from the beginning, like proof of stake, proof of work, all that sort of stuff. And my approach was from a creative perspective. My end goal was to make videos and learn in the process. So I didn't invest for the first six months of working in the space. I was very risk averse to begin with.
00:06:56.658 - 00:07:00.900, Speaker C: And, yeah, that was pretty much it.
00:07:01.750 - 00:07:20.342, Speaker B: And what about now, after, what has it been two years since you started making crypto videos? How has kind of your take on crypto evolved in that time? Are you a believer now or are you still in it, basically for the creative aspect?
00:07:20.486 - 00:07:55.650, Speaker C: No, I think I got skin in the game. After, like, six months, I briefly left harmony, and Harmony paid me in harmony tokens. They paid me as a severance payment. And that was basically my first cryptocurrency. And I started playing around with that. And during that time, it started blowing up. And overnight I made a couple hundred dollars and I was like, whoa, what's going on here? How is this possible so fast? Just the profits were insane at the time.
00:07:55.650 - 00:08:31.280, Speaker C: And then since then, I got really involved with the money making side of it. I thought this would be a good way to make some extra cash to buy a new computer for myself. So it started like that, and then. Yeah, wait, froze a little bit there. But how has it evolved? Like, I started playing around with defi protocols, then I started staking sushi and started learning more about the financial side of.
00:08:36.050 - 00:09:02.060, Speaker B: Is it. So is it still kind of about how you can use defi and invest different cryptocurrencies? Is that still kind of attractive to you? Or have you also ventured into NFTs, or have you looked into kind of other aspects that crypto might be interesting?
00:09:02.750 - 00:09:56.566, Speaker C: Yeah, what I really like about the aspect is being able to transact freely without any borders and remaining anonymous still without having a third party, acting as just having all your information, accessing all your information. I find that aspect attractive. And besides that, I did get into NFTs, but I was always really skeptical because I thought it can be really trapped in them. Most of them become illiquid. And I'm still somewhat risk averse. I'm not taking too many risks, but somewhat. I take risks in more, like alternative coins for some reason, but not in NFTs.
00:09:56.566 - 00:09:59.980, Speaker C: I'm not really sure why I'm doing that.
00:10:00.510 - 00:10:04.142, Speaker B: So Robin hasn't kind of influenced you in that way?
00:10:04.196 - 00:10:14.020, Speaker C: Well, he gave out free NFTs, which were pretty profitable. So I said, you know what? I guess I don't have to play the NFT game that much.
00:10:15.510 - 00:10:18.466, Speaker B: Robin's already doing enough of that for the whole office.
00:10:18.568 - 00:10:19.220, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:21.190 - 00:10:25.182, Speaker A: We say nothing about that. It's strictly black ops, that one.
00:10:25.256 - 00:10:33.320, Speaker B: All right, Robin, how has your kind of take or approach to crypto changed since you started making videos?
00:10:34.330 - 00:11:23.080, Speaker A: Since starting making videos? Well, I was active in crypto from early 2017, so I saw the last big bull run, and I traded all manner of garbage, really. It was shitcoins, and I was just having fun with it. And also it was just learning the space and learning the technology since making videos, I think it wasn't so much making videos, it was working at Harmony. It just taught me how little I'd actually known to that point. And it was so many things. It was the real nuts and bolts of protocols, particularly layer ones, like what's actually required to support and sustain a layer one, even just down to how many validators you need and the specifics of slashing and really deep in the weeds. And then really also just management of teams putting a team together.
00:11:23.080 - 00:12:04.226, Speaker A: The harmony office was very much go and work in the same hacker house. Once COVID hit, they had to separate, and I think it really disturbed the way that they'd been functioning, having to work remotely. And it took them a while to figure out how to put that together. But seeing Steve and my old boss there do stand up meetings. 09:00 a.m. On Saturday morning, everyone comes in, and he would spend an hour talking, bringing people up, explaining where they were at, that culture he brought over from Silicon Valley, from working at Google and Apple, and you could see how he wanted to run the company. What I know now is that that is not web three.
00:12:04.226 - 00:13:05.110, Speaker A: That's not how this space works. And when it moves at the speed that it really can move at, you can't do that. So there was just so many things that I learned about also, just when a community hates you, like what that's actually like. So I have an enormous amount of sympathy for any developers who fall on the wrong side of that and start to see that coming their way, because I don't think anything could prepare you for it, just how bad it actually is when you're in the weed. So all of these things inform how I look at protocols and I look at communities now. And I think the change that has happened is that I have a stronger conviction, that kind of the base layer, which is where does the strong conviction lie in the market. And it's a much broader base, and it's a much bigger base now, obviously, Michael Saylor is the name that jumps to mind, but you can see institutions, you can see larger players, larger names publicly supporting this space.
00:13:05.110 - 00:13:48.662, Speaker A: Mostly it's bitcoin, but it all trickles down. And it means that that huge, kind of just jaw dropping bear market position that we found ourselves in 2018 starts to look less and less remote. And then we move to how regulation is accelerating or the debate around regulation is accelerating. And you have this picture in your mind. Actually, everything that we thought was the promise, the future, the mainstream adoption, it's here that takes some kind of adjusting to, because you always feel like crypto is battling for survival, battling for recognition. It's happened. And I don't think anyone stood up and said, yeah, no, we made it because they don't believe it.
00:13:48.662 - 00:13:57.240, Speaker A: But for me, it's already happened. And now we're in this next really bizarre phase where we have to figure out what kind of compromises we're willing to make.
00:13:58.090 - 00:14:35.140, Speaker B: In 2021, Ethereum traders lost over $240,000,000 to malicious bots exploiting their trades. Eden Network is a next generation private transaction service for Ethereum, providing traders with MEV protection by submitting transactions directly to miners. And away from the prying eyes of harmful bots. Eden network recently launched Eden rocket RPC, which compiles some of Ethereum's fastest private transaction networks. Join and get started now at RPC, edennetwork IO. I think that it's true. I felt like last year was Crypto's mainstream moment.
00:14:35.140 - 00:15:36.678, Speaker B: It was like nobody's doubting that crypto is here to stay, or at least most people kind of know what crypto is. Most kind of big institutional investors funds, hedge funds, have crypto in their portfolios. Most banks are offering some sort of crypto product either kind of futures or exchange traded products and so on. And then NFTs completely kind of blew people away. And I think that brought in a whole new wave of a whole new set of people to the space. But at the same time, if you look at the numbers, it's still kind of only 10% of global population own crypto in centralized exchanges. So we're not even talking about DFI or web three.
00:15:36.678 - 00:16:46.350, Speaker B: That's even much smaller percentage. So I agree with you. But with that caveat that even while crypto is known by everyone, and I think everyone accepts crypto to be a fact of life by now and not going away, there's still a lot of room to grow and a long path before actual mainstream adoption of, okay, people actually kind of owning and holding and using crypto in kind of their day to day lives. Okay. So I think that was like the story last year, kind of crypto arriving at this moment, this year so far, it feels like there's a lot of major underlying forces kind of rising. Right. It's like on the macro side, you have this backdrop where interest rates are increasing, inflation is rising in the US, the pandemic is kind of ending.
00:16:46.350 - 00:17:51.730, Speaker B: There's all these macro changes. The crypto market has been super volatile. Like it kind of crashed at the start of the year, now it's stabilized. Kind of like bouncing back and all these kind of also like regulatory moves and announcements from the US with the executive order to the EU and their move on non custodial wallets to the UK and stablecoins recently to central banks. Considering CBDCs, I don't know, it's like these really big moves and of course with the added important component of the conflict or the war in Ukraine. So I'd love to know kind of your takes on this. You are making videos almost every day on all the kind of latest breaking news and tutorials and big stories with our defined weekly.
00:17:51.730 - 00:18:09.260, Speaker B: So you really kind of have gotten kind of in the weeds of all these major stories to you, what are the most interesting drivers so far?
00:18:10.590 - 00:19:03.894, Speaker A: Yeah, wow, that's a big question. The most interesting drivers are resilience. I think, first of all, I think a lot of people predicted there would be a much bigger drop from the highs that hasn't happened. And sort of what I mentioned before that there seems to be a greater conviction overall. And I think probably one of the biggest surprising things has just been the way in which the NFT story has evolved and refused to go away because we were comparing it to ICOs, and rightly so, because there was a huge frenzy around mints and drops and it felt a lot like the ICO craze, but where a lot of ICO projects then needed 18 months to two years to even deliver a piece of their roadmap. These NFT projects are much more agile and they're much faster to get things moving. So we've seen just a very rapid.
00:19:03.894 - 00:19:39.154, Speaker A: I mean, I don't want to call it innovation, because a lot of it isn't innovation, but it's growth led by obviously the board, AB Yacht Club, but also interesting partnerships like artifact partnering with Nike. The way Adidas has moved into this space, there's just been this rapid insertion into pop culture. And for me, pop culture was always going to be the front line for mainstream adoption. I never saw NFTs being that I thought it would be much more about straight up money. Money is bad. Money doesn't work for you. It isn't that, it's actually entertainment.
00:19:39.154 - 00:20:18.500, Speaker A: People want to be entertained. So as people that make videos, it's been really interesting to see that and see how different people have taken a piece of that. In many ways, I'd almost welcome a return to more of a focus on the money side of things, because I think it's one of the biggest sticks that we get beaten with, that. It's all about greed. And yet I want to show people like a simple, fixed interest rate product that will just allow their savings to travel further and create some kind of stability. That would be fascinating to see just normal people exposed to that choice. Okay, you have your banking app and you have the choice of, okay, deposit it with us or we'll give you access to this product and it's 10%.
00:20:18.500 - 00:21:01.230, Speaker A: People would bite your arm off for 10% on just savings with no downside. So I think we're going to see some really interesting conversations around stablecoins, how to regulate them. And the UK's showing its hand now in terms of it wants to reposition London as a kind of major financial center around crypto assets. Whether they can do that, I don't know. And obviously all eyes on Janet Yellen in the States. Those conversations, I think, for me, are the rubber hits the road. It's nfts and their unstoppable drive into pop culture and then this raging debate around stablecoins.
00:21:01.230 - 00:21:55.598, Speaker A: What is also really interesting is that Russia's invasion of the Ukraine, let's call it what it is, it is an invasion, has completely just shaken Europe to the core, shaken NATO to the core and forced it to rethink everything. And so we are going to see an awful lot of things be reconfigured. Where do we get our energy from? How do we even manage money cross border? How do we keep Russia out of the financial system? I don't. So, obviously, the conflict, the war has to have a place to play in all of this. And you can just feel it. You can feel money just being undermined, like the money that we're used to, fiat currency being undermined by everything in the world. And it's really strange to see that just kind of happen in front of you.
00:21:55.598 - 00:22:01.858, Speaker A: And what money is going to be in the next ten years, I don't know, but I know it's not going to look like what it looks like now at all.
00:22:01.944 - 00:22:09.846, Speaker B: Agree up to you, which have been the most interesting stories this year, I.
00:22:09.868 - 00:22:43.550, Speaker C: Just wanted to add to that idea of, like, we're going to have a big drop in bitcoin's price. Like, we've been talking about this for over a year now. Like, last year, we said, okay, the bear market is going to begin in August. And then people started saying, q one, 2022. And then we keep expecting a big drop in bitcoin or, like, other cryptocurrencies and enter a proper heavy bear market, but it's not really coming. Or we've entered a stage where it's a super cycle. Where the super cycle.
00:22:43.990 - 00:22:44.898, Speaker A: He said it.
00:22:44.984 - 00:22:58.374, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it is what it is. Yeah. Hit it. So percentage drops are going to be lower with established coins, I guess. Why are you wearing your glasses, by the way?
00:22:58.492 - 00:22:59.718, Speaker A: Because it makes me look cool.
00:22:59.804 - 00:23:00.440, Speaker C: Okay.
00:23:01.210 - 00:23:05.730, Speaker B: Let it be known that those glasses are absolutely useless.
00:23:05.810 - 00:23:19.020, Speaker A: Fake news. Fake news. Doesn't need them. Doesn't need them. I tell you why I'm wearing the glasses. It's because we went out for drinks with Camilla Russo last night, and she's a fiend, and I'm hungover today.
00:23:19.950 - 00:23:39.438, Speaker B: That's a good enough reason. Okay, alf, but why do you think that we might be in this kind of so called super cycle? Or just at least that the bear market won't be as steep or as deep as it was in 2018? 2019?
00:23:39.614 - 00:24:17.694, Speaker C: Well, a few factors. First of all, last year we saw a huge boom in the mainstream adoption of crypto. So getting more people involved in it and having more people starting to believe in it plays a key role in it. And besides that, having large companies and well established brands getting into it and including it in their balance sheet and stuff like that also helps establishes an even bigger trust and belief in the technology. So I think that's the main one.
00:24:17.812 - 00:24:20.830, Speaker B: Yeah, we're all, like, waiting.
00:24:22.130 - 00:24:23.646, Speaker C: What's going to come out now?
00:24:23.748 - 00:24:24.990, Speaker B: It's going to drop.
00:24:25.590 - 00:24:26.242, Speaker C: Thanks, man.
00:24:26.296 - 00:25:57.342, Speaker B: Okay, finally, I want to go back to the topic of Ukraine and Russia. I think it's posed such interesting questions about money, about the financial system being weaponized and what role crypto plays in all this. So on the one hand, on the fiat side, the US and Western Europe are using sanctions to kind of coerce or force Russia out of the Ukraine or into a position. So taking russian banks out of the Swift system, imposing sanctions on russian oligarchs and so on, prohibiting companies to transact with russian counterparties. And this miter might not have an effect, and that's debatable. But the fact is that the traditional financial system is being used as a weapon. Effectively, instead of going in with their tanks and armies, the west is fighting Russia with money, with the financial system.
00:25:57.342 - 00:26:52.394, Speaker B: And that's super interesting. Of course, this time, Russia is kind of the bad guys, at least in my. But, like, I wonder what happens to the time when the good guys are being attacked with the financial system. It's like, okay, so this time maybe we can all stand behind sanctions and money being weaponized because it's against the bad guys. But I think to me, it's, like, conflicting, the fact that countries can use the financial system as a weapon. When I think everyday people in Russia, I don't think should be necessarily punished for this, they should be free to transact. And same with the Ukraine.
00:26:52.394 - 00:27:53.060, Speaker B: We were just speaking with Ivar, the connective tissue, yesterday, and we were talking about how the Ukraine is also placing this kind of fence around its financial system to stop the local currency from falling and stop people from taking money out of the country and so on. So Ukrainians are also suffering with the weaponization of finance. And of course, in parallel, there's crypto, like, providing an alternative to both Ukrainians and Russians. So I think that's just, like, such an interesting development this year. That kind of proves why crypto is useful, unfortunately, kind of in this horrible scenario, but would love to kind of hear your thoughts, like, how you're seeing this play out.
00:27:54.630 - 00:28:30.974, Speaker A: Yeah. The situation for Ukrainians is particularly complex. As you say, the government has set in motion restrictions which mean you can't take money out of the country, you can't pay into a foreign bank account, so they want to keep the money in the country, which is understandable. There's also a problem which is you have to volunteer in the Ukraine and if you don't, then they impose a tax. And so around about 20%. So they heavily incentivize you to volunteer. Unfortunately, if you don't live in the Ukraine, you can't do this.
00:28:30.974 - 00:29:35.698, Speaker A: So you have to go back to the Ukraine to volunteer in person. So if you're not resident in Ukraine and like the 4 million or so people who've left that would include them, then you're in trouble. And so there are a huge number of restrictions for Ukrainians. And we are covering a story at the moment of someone who is ukrainian. She's based in Amsterdam and is attempting to get crucial supplies to soldiers on the front line, and she can't because she has a ukrainian bank account and she has a ukrainian identity. So she's having to perform all these financial gymnastics to get the money to where it's needed, which is, as it turns out, in Poland. And the way she's done it, cross border is using crypto, which is a kind of very interesting example of how even though the final payment isn't in crypto, the ability to move money cross border rapidly and without restriction is what's enabling her to get bandages and tourniquets and night vision helmets to people that need them.
00:29:35.698 - 00:29:53.260, Speaker A: And that is not a story we hear very often. Normally we're hearing about apes and fugly JPEGs and people aping into farms and the gross greed that's on display. No, here's a story about someone who could not do this unless crypto was there. And that's a story that we need to tell.
00:29:54.590 - 00:30:32.680, Speaker B: When you shop for plane tickets, you probably use kayak, Expedia or Google flights. So why would you limit yourself to just one exchange? When you trade crypto? To make sure you're getting the best possible price, you should use a Dex aggregator like Matcha. Matcha routes your orders across all the various defi exchanges on Ethereum, Polygon, avalanche, BSD, Phantom, sello, and optimism. With Matcha, you can make limit orders on chain so you can set and forget your defi trades. And now Matcha even offers gasless trading. Head over to Matcha XYC slash Defiant and connect your wallet to start smarter with.
00:30:35.770 - 00:31:01.520, Speaker A: Mean. I think you're right. Effectively, what's happening here is NATO is trying to deplatform Russia. That's basically what's happening here from the financial system. And Russia planned for this. They knew it was coming and so they stockpiled cash and it's been frozen. And we don't really know what's going on in Russia because they paint these lovely, pretty pictures on national TV and everyone eats it up.
00:31:01.520 - 00:31:59.442, Speaker A: Peskov has said this morning that he finds the loss of life troublesome. I forget what the exact wordage was, but there is a slow, slow, slow trickle of something like the truth from the russian propaganda machine. But again, it's easy to paint Russia as the bad guys, and we have done, and they are the aggressor here, but every government is a bad guy, in my opinion. And what web three really is all about is starting from a position where we cannot and should not automatically trust institutions, whether they be large VC backed web, two firms controlling our data, or governments, because we can't. And they've proven repeatedly that we cannot trust them. And that's where Web three starts from where we arrive at and where the trust sits, I don't know. But then we have Trump with truth social attempting to create a platform where anyone can speak.
00:31:59.442 - 00:32:34.782, Speaker A: And then we have Twitter. Should you be able to say whatever you want on Twitter? I don't know. And I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to any of these things, but at know we have to try and figure it out in some way. So when we say permissionless, is it? I don't know. Because at some point you can transact within crypto and you can operate in crypto and through Defi, but at a certain point, you want to be able to pay for milk. And it's at that point there that it all falls down. And I don't know whether we're ever going to be able to solve that.
00:32:34.782 - 00:32:35.760, Speaker A: That's the problem.
00:32:39.490 - 00:32:42.000, Speaker C: I agree with Robin's points.
00:32:43.330 - 00:32:44.400, Speaker A: Thanks, sir.
00:32:49.430 - 00:32:50.434, Speaker B: Wait, is that it?
00:32:50.472 - 00:32:51.220, Speaker C: Oh, wait.
00:32:54.710 - 00:33:00.886, Speaker A: Yeah, it was going so well as well. We were very serious. It went very quiet. Everyone just kind of chilled down and then you just.
00:33:00.908 - 00:33:31.760, Speaker C: Fine, let's keep it friendly. We're having a friendly chat here. But, yeah, it's not just ukrainian people that's being screwed over because of the situation. Right. As you said, like, the russian people are also in trouble because of basically one guy's decision that is their president. And it's somewhat affecting me as well because my dad has business in Russia. He's currently there at the moment, actually, and it's making imports and exports more expensive, more trouble involved in.
00:33:31.760 - 00:33:39.138, Speaker C: Yeah, it's tough for everyone. I mean, this whole situation.
00:33:39.304 - 00:34:51.190, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think, as you were saying, that all governments are bad guys. It's an interesting take, but I think it may be true, but maybe not in the literal sense, but in the sense that all governments have the potential to really interfere with everyone's lives and money. And right now the governments have the power to censor us, and that's clear across the board. I think people living in developed countries kind of forget that that's the case. But it doesn't take much for governments to kind of step out of line. And we started recently with Canada.
00:34:51.190 - 00:36:17.574, Speaker B: You would have never expected Canada, like the most quietest, most stable country in kind of the Americas, to do something like that. But we saw how they blocked the truckers bank accounts when they were protesting the different COVID mandates. So it doesn't take much for governments to step over that line. So I think as we're kind of seeing these things play out, it's important to remember, okay, it's good that maybe kind of these sanctions will have the desired effect on Russia, but it's not so great that governments actually have the power to do these things. Or if you think it is, I think at least, at the very least, it's good to have crypto as an alternative for people to actually be able to transact when that time comes. As you rightly say, Robin, there's a lot missing, like infrastructure missing for that to be actually completely effective, because kind of the bridges to the real world aren't always there. That's kind of probably the biggest story this year.
00:36:17.574 - 00:37:34.046, Speaker B: And speaking of institutions, I wanted to just share with our podcast audience the experience I had this week at the CBDC conference, because it was very enlightening. So I went to speak at a conference that was organized by the bank of International Settlements and the National bank of Switzerland. So like their central bank. And it was a conference about Defi and how defi interacts with CBDCs. So I went there expecting a group of people who were even within these institutions, probably open to DeFi and friendly to it since they had organized this conference. But it was really surprising to see how deeply skeptical they all were. I met tons of lovely people, and I say this with respect, but it was surprising to see kind of how still behind the times they were.
00:37:34.046 - 00:38:45.254, Speaker B: Just like a quick anecdote. The BIS employees still use the BlackBerry app, like the BlackBerry software on their phones. And to me, that's just like a sign of like, wow, they are just so behind in all respects. And speaking about DeFi, the main thing I got from them was just this deeply rooted fear about this new system. And it was all about the risk, the risk of DeFi. They were talking about kind of front running and sandwich attacks as if those things didn't start in traditional finance and how money laundering and criminals can use crypto and the tired kind of takes to the space and just very much focus on the risk and how to regulate it instead of kind of the opportunity. So I don't know, I was pretty surprised by it.
00:38:45.254 - 00:40:22.930, Speaker B: And I think the most shocking comment that to me was like, I don't know, it kind of really actually bothered me was that I heard at least three times from people in the bis that to this argument of crypto is an alternative for people living in repressive regimes or in corrupt governments or with devaluating currencies and so on. Their argument to that was, well, instead of going outside of the system, why not try to improve the system? And that to me is just like it reflects a dictatorship or to Argentina go and change decades and decades of just like chronic inflation. People just don't have a choice. I mean, just like Russians and Ukrainians don't have a choice really on what's happening. So anyways, this just happened this week and I've been kind of like ruminating on this because it was like, wow, it's just like a different. I think we're steeped in this crypto bubble and we forget that a lot of people just think very differently.
00:40:23.990 - 00:40:28.440, Speaker A: Did you see any positive inquiry into what you were saying?
00:40:30.250 - 00:41:58.678, Speaker B: I think there was kind of an interest in seeing how Defi and crypto could bring financial services to a wider group of people, just like increasing access to financial services. So I think that was kind of what they were most receptive to. But at the same time, it was like I got like the different cbdc projects that are being tested really have nothing to do with crypto. They are not planning to issue CVDCs on public blockchains. That's very far from what's being discussed. It's kind of digital currencies run on private systems, on private ledgers that sometimes won't even be used by the retail population even. It's called kind of like wholesale CBDCs, which will be just used by central banks and commercial banks to make the system more efficient, which in one way it's a relief because it kind of reduces the risk of privacy infringement and kind of all these big brother concerned about CBDC.
00:41:58.678 - 00:42:18.710, Speaker B: So in that way, I guess it's fine. But there's no kind of real plan of integrating CBDCs to DeFi and to web three. I didn't see that kind of actually being discussed or taken seriously.
00:42:19.130 - 00:43:01.158, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess one of the big things about the money problem at the moment is how do you stop inflation? How do you stop the money printer going? If there is an unlimited supply and you can just keep printing it, then it's always those who stand to lose the most are the ones that get hurt the most, and that's normal people. And Andrew Yang always talks about the decline and the destruction of the middle classes. He's right. It's happening. It's happening extremely quickly. There's a real need for us to communicate properly. I think there's a real need for us to get a message out that doesn't look like a message.
00:43:01.158 - 00:43:36.926, Speaker A: I think that's the real trick here, because there's a lot of pushback on crypto and Defi and NFTs particularly, that it's like, stop shouting at me, stop telling me I'm going to die broken alone. Stop preaching to me because I don't want to hear it. Nobody wants to be told they're an idiot. They kind of have to arrive at the conclusion that they're an idiot by themselves. Because we're all idiots. We don't know anything, and we have the opportunity to know a little bit more. And so really, it's helping people realize that there's more that they could know and that it isn't scary.
00:43:36.926 - 00:44:15.834, Speaker A: But that story, that message, you can't just go out there and say, our financial system is broken and web two is bad because it just falls on deaf ears. And we see that over and over again. Everyone just entrenches and pulls back because they don't want to hear that. So the discussions that we're having at the moment is like, how do we get a different story out and allow the other story? We want to kind of percolate and be received, even though that's not what we're saying, and that is some kind of magic trick. So it's kind of become an obsession of mine. It's like, I want to talk about this stuff, but I don't want to shout about it. It needs to be a lot more subtle.
00:44:15.834 - 00:44:25.380, Speaker A: And it's the people at the bis who, you want them to see something. And just a question to form.
00:44:25.830 - 00:45:09.102, Speaker B: Ferrax recently launched USDS, a decentralized stablecoin that automatically generates passive income for holders. USDS is a hybrid stablecoin, part backed by cryptocurrencies and part by the protocol's ability to mint and burn the governance token spa. The yield is generated organically via external defi applications to ensure sustainability of the system. Thanks to the auto yield it pays to hold USDs. Go to apps, Spherax, IO and mint your own USDs today. I think the question is are at least kind of. They heard the other side and I think that was a huge step forward.
00:45:09.102 - 00:45:32.134, Speaker B: I'm pretty brave of them. They had me, they had the curved founder. Michael. Yes. Liquidy founder was there. Evan Vanessa. They had a good group of people who were able to give the other side.
00:45:32.134 - 00:46:06.590, Speaker B: So I think that was positive. That was like a good step for them. But speaking of telling a message, I want to transition to what we're doing at the defiant and what's coming up, the coming weeks and months. You're talking about kind of bringing this story to the world. So, yeah, if you can kind of bring the audience behind the scenes to what's being planned here.
00:46:06.740 - 00:46:29.478, Speaker A: Well, you know what we could do? We could actually talk about our week because it's crazy. It's crazy. So over the weekend, I will read stories and start to get an idea of what I want to cover for the next week. Monday we sit down and we do the quick take. And that's usually I have to write it in about an hour and we shoot it in about ten minutes. And then Gary, who's our editor, takes him about 2 hours to write it. And then that same day we also look at first look.
00:46:29.478 - 00:47:19.026, Speaker A: So we try to discover an interesting protocol that might be interesting to cover. And then I try and look for stuff that is less well known, that's off the radar, because I think it's important that there are some interesting projects out there that just won't get any coverage any other way because everyone else who's covering crypto goes for the numbers and we don't do that. So we're probably the only place you're going to see interesting, less well covered protocols in any detail or quality. And then we have a tutorial to do, and we also do that on Mondays. And then the rest of the week we're kind of doing the real vision show, which has to be prepped. We have the Friday weekly show, which is our big kind of flagship show where we try and really take a story and do it in our very own surprising and unique way. And that just kills us every week, trying to come up with something different and unique.
00:47:19.026 - 00:47:57.506, Speaker A: And then we're just doing live shows on Thursdays. Every day we're publishing something and figuring out how to manage our time when we're delivering that much content is impossible. And what I realized was there are things slipping under the radar that we don't cover because they won't fit into our schedule. And what happened this year was we saw a couple of pieces of content, particularly line goes up by Dan Olson, where he singled you out for criticism, called you a failed journalist. And it really pissed me off. And it got to the point where I was just like, I hate this space. I don't like what's being reflected back here.
00:47:57.506 - 00:49:04.554, Speaker A: And I think that was a good reaction to have. But I also kind of went back and said, well, why do they see this? And why is it so off putting for them that they can't forgive a young space tripping over its own feet when what we see as the end goal and the beauty of this space is what makes all of that worthwhile? And I realized that we never show it. And that was a surprising revelation to come to because I feel like we're shining a light on this space all the time. But what I realized is what we're shining a light on is all the things that they hate. And so how do we then raise up the things that really matter? Well, we have to take more time and we have to raise money to do it, and we have to get a team in place to dedicate themselves to doing that. And then we have to work really hard to find those stories and put them together. So it's been a couple of conversations, particularly with Andrew Yang and his lobby three team, about what kind of materials they would like to present to Congress, because they're going to be talking to Congress over and over and over, and what Congress will hear from the market, from their constituents is crypto is bad.
00:49:04.554 - 00:49:47.480, Speaker A: Crypto is for money launderers and paedophiles, and we have to present something else to balance that out. So we're starting to look for stories like that, and we will be looking to raise money through crowdfunding to fund, I guess, what will end up being about a year's worth of content, hopefully. We were originally going to do a film, but I think it might end up being a series of films. And hopefully we'll partner up with some other organizations to do that. But these stories do matter. And it's where you basically start from the position of, is there something here where it could only have happened because of crypto? And it turns out there are tons of these kinds of stories. It's just they're not money go up stories or number go up, or look how much my ape is sold for.
00:49:47.480 - 00:50:38.790, Speaker A: But they're still meaningful and important. And I think people will really rally behind those stories and be interested in them if we can do it in the right way. And that isn't something that we can just flippantly just put me in front of a camera and say they have to be real and raw and honest, and the furthest thing from propaganda we can create. That's what it has to be. So we're in the process of putting that together at the moment. We've been talking about it for so long, but really we didn't quite know what it was going to be until a story landed in our lap last week about a ukrainian film producer who is effectively funneling supplies and a whole bunch of other stuff that she can't talk about to the Ukraine, and she can only do it with crypto. And we felt that this was, from a visceral perspective, making it real.
00:50:38.790 - 00:51:06.446, Speaker A: This is about as good as it gets. So we're going to use that as the pilot to launch this campaign and then we'll raise some money. We have to do it using crypto, obviously, and there is no way to do that unless you give people tokens and NFTs. But the point is that'll just say, yeah, you funded this thing. We're not going to be selling NFTs. We're not going to be selling tokens that have any value. It's literally, that's just what we have to do because we think it's important.
00:51:06.446 - 00:51:36.346, Speaker A: And actually, I think we probably think it's one of the most important things we could be doing right now. Because when I look at the landscape of who makes content in this space, particularly video content, there's almost nobody that has the exposure that we have and the experience we have who will be able to navigate this very tricky line to making the story work in the right way on the people that it needs to work on. So that's the big challenge ahead of us, and I'm excited to get it going.
00:51:36.448 - 00:51:40.860, Speaker B: Yeah, same here. What do you think about this project?
00:51:42.430 - 00:52:31.120, Speaker C: I think what triggered was the Dan Olson video. I think what sparked this whole idea and to see how it's evolving and shaping to its current state, I like it because it started off as like, let's reply back to this guy and improve that he's wrong and we're right in a way. That was the initial idea and then it turned into this, and now we have a better pilot and better spark of thought to carry on with. So I like it in that sense. And it has a more ground in the real world and people are benefiting from what crypto is doing in Ukraine. So, yeah, I'm excited for it. Yeah.
00:52:33.730 - 00:52:42.240, Speaker B: So I guess this is the first time we've talked about this publicly, right? I don't think we've said this before.
00:52:42.770 - 00:53:37.362, Speaker A: Yeah, well, we haven't really launched it properly yet, but that was because it's still coming together. Yeah. It wasn't so much that it's so easy to open yourself up to both criticism and ridicule if you go into it, too. And as Alp said, the Dan Olson film triggered a response. And what I felt was, well, I hate this guy and I want to prove him wrong and I want to attack, and I had to really pour a lot of cold water on that because it was the wrong way to approach this. And it was also the fact that a lot of what he said was correct, but it's also a lot of things that can be fixed. Again, what I would have realized was that we're just not presenting a workable and honest picture of the ultimate benefits of all of this.
00:53:37.362 - 00:54:15.722, Speaker A: All we're talking about is the systems and the profits we made from those systems and how to exploit them. And so that was really the starting point for this. It's just, how do we do that the right way? And you just have to find an entry point. And this ukrainian story is that entry point, and it is real. And I think people see our videos and they can see production value and lighting and all the fun party tricks we put into the videos. And that's because that's how we make it fun for ourselves, because a lot of what we cover is it's just code, it's numbers. So making these visual things helps make the story more memorable, and it also makes it fun for us to shoot.
00:54:15.722 - 00:54:42.226, Speaker A: But when you're talking about being real, that all has to go away. So just allowing ourselves to put a story out there and for the story to be the only thing that matters, that's really crucial. I worked at Vice news on and off for a while, and that's what they do. That's what they used to do brilliantly. And I think that's a great kind of starting point for us in terms of telling the story is just realness.
00:54:42.418 - 00:55:32.022, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's exactly the approach to take with this. And I think I wouldn't want this to be a response to Dan Olsen. That's not what this is about. Right. Maybe that's what sparked the idea. Like, how can we showcase, like, the true impact of crypto? But I'm glad that it's evolved beyond just like a reply story but more about there's this actual kind of side of the space that we're not covering. And as our mission is to be the trusted best source of information for web three and DFI this is inner mandate to do so.
00:55:32.022 - 00:56:04.846, Speaker B: Yes. Cover all the latest news and developments in DFI and web three. Do the tutorials on how to use this stuff. Absolutely. But we can't miss the big story, like why this thing actually matters. And you look at, like you said, most crypto content and videos and, yeah, I think we're missing the forest from the trees. There's just like so much going on that it's easy to go very deep in the rabbit hole.
00:56:04.846 - 00:56:21.046, Speaker B: But it's so necessary to take a step back because that's what the people who are not in it are missing. They're missing kind of that big picture take. So I'm really excited that we can be the ones to provide it.
00:56:21.228 - 00:57:16.150, Speaker A: Yeah, it's definitely a case that if I look at who would I want to make this story? It's us. I don't know who else could do it? That's the thing. I wouldn't trust anybody who's not in crypto to get it and to understand it. Yeah, that worked out, didn't it? Take two. Take two. No, the issue is that I think having come from harmony the appeal of the defined was we can float above everything and we can observe it from a distance and we're not kind of infected or caught up in it. What's become very apparent is that we are in it and we are part of it and we are a web three entity, data platform, coffee maker.
00:57:16.150 - 00:57:48.670, Speaker A: And that's what we do. And so it becomes clear that there's a burden on us to stand up and put ourselves in the firing line to a degree by doing this and having an opinion, which is a hard one because we try to be objective and try to give everyone a fair shot. But actually we also need to have an opinion about this if we're going to utilize the tools and the primitives of this space to forward our own kind of business. So, yeah, it's time to get political, baby.
00:57:48.750 - 00:57:49.762, Speaker B: Yes. I like it.
00:57:49.816 - 00:57:50.434, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:57:50.552 - 00:58:52.262, Speaker B: Well, to be clear, the defiant has an editorial line. We are unbiased and objective in covering this space but our position and our editorial line is that we think that the future will be increasingly decentralized and that crypto will be used as an infrastructure layer for an increasing amount of industries and it will become to me, it's clear that blockchains will start to form this value layer on top of the Internet. And that's what we call web three. That's happening. And I think that's kind of the position that's reflecting in our own content and our own production. So I think it's kind of like a line there to balance. We want to be objective, of course, like accuracy above all, unbiased when reporting this space.
00:58:52.262 - 00:59:00.780, Speaker B: But that doesn't mean that we don't have a position here. We have a strong position and we're part of it also. Right.
00:59:01.150 - 00:59:04.726, Speaker A: We have a strong position in the hearts and minds of our subscribers.

00:59:45.612 - 01:00:30.550, Speaker B: Oh my God. That's so hard. Let me see. There's just so. I definitely have a soft spot for the earlier thesis because I remember just starting to work with you guys and just being blown away every week with the stuff that you were doing. So the sushi swap ballad was amazing. I mean, that whole thing, like the avagatchi you kind of in this jungle, those pieces were just like, were wild.
01:00:30.550 - 01:01:19.254, Speaker B: And. Yeah, those are special to me because it's like the start of our relationship together. But recently you've done some amazing work. I think the arctic piece really stands out. It's just like beautifully shot and such an interesting topic. Just like this permanence of NFTs and just like something that's not very much talked about in the space and just how unique it is to have been able to shoot up there. I think the.
01:01:19.254 - 01:01:33.414, Speaker B: And I really like the, the recent tomato merge piece. I think that was, that, that was like a really good example of like, our, our sweet spots, you know?
01:01:33.612 - 01:01:41.260, Speaker A: Tomatoes are a. Yeah. So, Al, explain to the folks back home how the creative process works.
01:01:41.630 - 01:02:01.486, Speaker C: How the creative process works. Well, it changes every time. But basically this time what we did was we found some reference images. Well, it actually started with, like, inspiration. Let's watch some tabletop photography. Tabletop videos of other people doing shooting.
01:02:01.678 - 01:02:03.486, Speaker A: But how do we get to tomatoes?
01:02:03.598 - 01:02:22.730, Speaker C: Oh, how do we get to tomatoes? Well, you just said, why not? I mean, that was the trigger. But you also explain it by saying, okay, tomatoes have seeds. It's juicy, and it's all covered in one skin. It's red, it's tasty, it's a fruit.
01:02:23.230 - 01:02:24.586, Speaker A: You're not doing this very well.
01:02:24.688 - 01:02:25.654, Speaker C: I'm horrible.
01:02:25.782 - 01:03:02.630, Speaker A: I'm going to have to take you and instruct you in the art of explaining stuff to people. No, I think if you watched our videos, you would be like, how on earth did you come up with that? The avagotchi thing was nuts, but I think with the merge, everybody was covering the merge, and everyone was doing a story about it, and I just thought, how am I going to make this a defiant film? So I started thinking about what we could do and how we could shoot it. And I was like, I know I want it to feel like a recipe or some kind of cooking. And then I was like, tomatoes. It just kind of came to me like tomatoes. We got lots of different versions of tomatoes. They're cheap to get, so we could get lots of them and smash them up.
01:03:02.630 - 01:03:35.054, Speaker A: But then I realized that yeast is like this building block for everything, and a tomato is like one of the most versatile vegetables, fruits in cooking. So it's like a perfect metaphor. And then we could just have so much fun shooting it and chopping it and squashing it and blending it. And that was the thing, really. It was the idea of the merge as a blender, just putting these two things together and making them one. That became the visual metaphor for it. But coming up with ideas for these shows is I challenge myself to do something different every week.
01:03:35.054 - 01:04:03.546, Speaker A: Sometimes it's just an intro. I've been trying to push more and more onto kind of more creative execution. But, like, with the Arctic film, I knew I wanted to give people the entire arctic film in the first 30 seconds of the film, because then I thought they would keep watching. So I just kind of smashed it all together with some sound effects, and I was like, this is what you're going to get. And then, of course, we had Simon wan come along, but, I mean, some of the things we've done are just nuts. Absolutely nuts. And I don't really know how we come up with them.
01:04:03.546 - 01:04:19.098, Speaker A: Like the sushi song, for some reason, I knew it was going to be a song, and I knew it was going to be like Tiger King. And that was basically what it was. It was just like. I just want to do the ballad of Chef Nomi as Tiger King?
01:04:19.194 - 01:04:24.018, Speaker B: So good. What did you do that rap song for?
01:04:24.104 - 01:04:45.334, Speaker A: So pickle. The pickle hack. The pickle hackle pickle. Basically, that was the inspiration for that was somebody wrote a tweet saying, we all serve at the altar of Dr. Dre. So someone wrote a tweet. I was like, well, what if we did the entire story in rap? And that would have been really tough, but I've never rapped in my life before.
01:04:45.334 - 01:05:18.994, Speaker A: And we just went, well, we could do this. We could do this. And then had to shoot all the music videos for that in literally an hour and then edit them to deliver that afternoon. I mean, I think that's what people don't understand is just how insane the editing process is for us, because we'll sometimes have a half an hour film for defined weekly, and we won't finish shooting it till midday on the day we're publishing it. And then ALP will take half, I'll take half, and then we'll just edit it. And somehow it gets published. And I don't even know how we know.
01:05:18.994 - 01:05:25.662, Speaker A: Sometimes we look at it like, how are we going to get this done? I don't know. We'll get it done. And we always do. It's nuts. It really is nuts.
01:05:25.726 - 01:05:30.994, Speaker B: What was the insane one with the pineapple? Was that, like, for me, that was meme. Meme.
01:05:31.042 - 01:05:31.590, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:31.740 - 01:05:32.690, Speaker B: That was insane.
01:05:32.770 - 01:06:04.382, Speaker A: Yeah, the meme one. He called it the degenerator. And then for me, I heard Joker. What is this kind of wild, cackling thing? And then I basically took the trailer for the joker and made it a pineapple. And then we had so much fun doing that and smashing them. And the thing about pineapples is there's lots of different ways that they can be carved up and cut and put them on pizza. And it just ended up being a really perfect metaphor for everything that we were doing.
01:06:04.436 - 01:06:31.260, Speaker C: Yeah, we tend to do that, actually, like, using food. Like, last week was tomato. We did the pineapple. And for the curve video, which is one of the classics as well, I think we used a banana. And that became a reoccurring thing throughout the film. You have it in the intro later on, Robin smashes inside a basket like a basketball. And then later, I threw it at his head.
01:06:31.260 - 01:06:43.340, Speaker C: And then at the end, it's a very wholesome way, and he opens his palms, a banana lands there, he eats it, and video ends, like, just wrapping everything up and using it as a metaphor throughout the video.
01:06:44.030 - 01:06:45.134, Speaker B: That's our thing.
01:06:45.252 - 01:07:03.986, Speaker A: Yeah, you riff on an idea and that's fun. I mean, I used to shoot a lot of music videos, and in music videos, that's what you do. You take an idea and you riff on it and riff on it and riff on it, and you try and challenge yourself to come up with lots of different executions of that idea. And that's a really fun way to do things. We forget, though, that defi was basically themed around food.
01:07:04.168 - 01:07:06.254, Speaker B: True yam sushi, I think that's.
01:07:06.302 - 01:07:33.834, Speaker A: And that was where it came from. So there was just all this food fi and that's what we did. So we just lent into that and said, well, what can we do with food? And it ended up with me having food thrown at me and eating all sorts of weird stuff. But it's just trying to keep it entertaining. I think at certain times last year we were just so under the kosh trying to get stories out that we had to dial back. But one of my favorites was the one where we did Sin City. We did a sin City intro that was really fun.
01:07:33.834 - 01:08:12.886, Speaker A: And then for one, I think it was structured and indexed products. I did this whole sequence with green screen. I'm on a roof, I get struck by lightning, then I jump off the roof, and then I kind of get stuck hanging in midair. And then we showed how I did it, and it just looks so dumb flapping around on a. You know, it's kind of. So now we're moving into a really weird phase, which is virtual production. And Cammie, you've seen some of the equipment that we have, but really just understanding that the metaverse is such a big story and that telling a story in the metaverse is quite challenging unless you build your own metaverse setup or your own holodeck.
01:08:12.886 - 01:08:49.814, Speaker A: So we're using unreal engine, and we're plugging into everything that that world can offer us. Game engines, PFPs, and how you might puppet one in real time using optical motion capture, which is just kills us every time we try and do something in there. It is so complex and nothing works. But we'll stick at it and make that a piece of our overall pipeline and hopefully be able to produce with that the same way we can with regular optical cameras. But that's going to take us a little while to get there. But that's really an exciting kind of new frontier that nobody else is doing. I mean, that really is like anywhere in the world.
01:08:49.814 - 01:08:57.298, Speaker A: Nobody's doing that on a YouTube schedule. So, yeah, that's going to be exciting. It'll probably break us, but I don't.
01:08:57.314 - 01:09:41.910, Speaker B: Want you to break, so take it easy. I can't wait to see how that goes though. The stuff you've been able to do in this small space with fruits and veggies. I can only imagine what you'll do with that crazy Sci-Fi equipment you have going on over there. That'll be exciting to see. But like I said, just like step by step. Okay, I guess just to start wrapping up, I want to ask you kind of the flagship or like standard question of the defiant podcast, how are you defiant?
01:09:45.130 - 01:09:55.354, Speaker C: I start, okay, I want to think.
01:09:55.392 - 01:10:00.118, Speaker B: A bit more, but I guess leave 4 hours.
01:10:00.304 - 01:10:16.414, Speaker C: That's nasty, man. How am I defined? I guess working here makes me defined, dude, come on. Yeah, working at the defined makes me defined. That's definitely one that's a boring fight.
01:10:16.452 - 01:10:17.380, Speaker B: In what way?
01:10:17.750 - 01:10:40.358, Speaker C: Because we represent web three, we represent stuff that authorities don't like that much and are questioning and very skeptical about. So us reporting it and somewhat supporting it in a way being one of our main values. I think that makes me defined.
01:10:40.454 - 01:10:43.690, Speaker B: I'm glad that we're helping you be defined.
01:10:46.110 - 01:10:47.100, Speaker A: What else?
01:10:48.750 - 01:10:50.230, Speaker C: What makes you defined?
01:10:50.390 - 01:11:25.446, Speaker A: So I have three essential values that I tried to kind of present them to harmony back in the day because I was sort of inspired by their idea of one, their tokens, called one, but it's very simple. One is keep it real. And I think that is so hard to do in this space. It is so easy to kind of get lost in the noise and the excitement and lose track of reality. So keeping it real is one of them. And I think we're one of the very few voices in this space that do that consistently. And someone on Twitter actually pointed that out.
01:11:25.446 - 01:11:55.246, Speaker A: They said, you're actually self aware, you know that this is BS a lot of the time. So that's 1 second is challenge all assumptions, like nothing should be taken as gospel or true unless you've gone and done the homework yourself. So it's very easy to kind of go, oh, I heard someone told me, and then you accept that as truth. Don't do that. We mustn't do that. And then the third one was be the one. So that means where you might wait for somebody else to do something, be the one that does it.
01:11:55.246 - 01:12:16.710, Speaker A: And it's an interesting way to live your life. If you say, well, I'm just going to wait for so and so to stand up and do that, or I'll wait and see what someone does first. We can't do that. We have to lead. So that means let's be the one. Be the one that steps up. Be the one that puts your hand up.
01:12:16.710 - 01:12:29.906, Speaker A: Talking to this ukrainian film producer, she's like, I don't want to hear that I'm in your prayers. I want to see you do something. And that resonates with me so hard. So those three things are how I'm defiant.
01:12:30.038 - 01:13:15.194, Speaker B: I love it. Okay, well, I guess I'll say how I'm defiant. I never get a chance to say it in the other episode. Okay. So I think I'm defiant by setting just really crazy, seem, like crazy, unreachable goals and just, like, going for it. So very much tied to what you were saying of being the one. Okay, there's no Bloomberg for web Three.
01:13:15.194 - 01:14:20.430, Speaker B: Why don't we make it? And I really do believe that we are the ones to make it. We're the ones to become the most trusted information source for DFI and web three. The only ones providing trusted, credible, in depth, financially focused information about the space and who are building the data platform to see what's going on on chain firsthand and to do it in a web three native way and then going back just like, there's no book on Ethereum. Okay, I'll write it. I don't know why that is that I think that I can do this stuff, but I guess I kind of push myself to try. So I kind of defy my own expectations about myself. I don't know if I can actually pull this off, but I'll give everything to try to do it.
01:14:20.430 - 01:14:25.898, Speaker B: And so I really love that you guys are kind of with me on this journey.
01:14:26.074 - 01:14:44.566, Speaker A: Yeah. That fearlessness. I think when we make a video and we come up with an idea, there isn't time to worry about whether we can actually pull it off or not. We just have to make it work. And I think there's been one video where we didn't, and we didn't publish what we'd made one.
01:14:44.748 - 01:14:46.806, Speaker B: Wait, and you never published it?
01:14:46.908 - 01:15:00.300, Speaker A: No, it was an intro that we made that it just didn't work. I think there was a website, and I was jumping from parts of the website to other parts of the website and ducking, and things were passing on my head, and it just didn't work.
01:15:00.750 - 01:15:03.038, Speaker B: Well, one in, like, over a year.
01:15:03.124 - 01:15:07.310, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty good track record. It's not too bad at all.
01:15:07.460 - 01:15:21.774, Speaker B: All right, well, I love that this is what unites us, this fearlessness. This has been awesome. Thank you, guys for taking the time and shoot this with me. And again, it's been amazing seeing this all firsthand.
01:15:21.902 - 01:15:23.006, Speaker A: More alp. More alp.
01:15:23.038 - 01:15:23.406, Speaker B: More alp.
01:15:23.438 - 01:15:28.482, Speaker C: More alp. And thanks for coming here, Camilla. You should visit us more. And we should shoot more videos together.
01:15:28.616 - 01:15:35.186, Speaker B: I agree. Looking forward to that. And doing it in the virtual with the Matrix.
01:15:35.218 - 01:15:44.230, Speaker A: That's for your female fans out there, Asmr. Just give them, like, a soft whisper. Whisper.
01:15:44.730 - 01:15:45.798, Speaker B: Oh, no.
01:15:45.964 - 01:15:48.550, Speaker C: How was that? Are you aroused?
01:15:49.210 - 01:15:57.100, Speaker A: So not it so not right close.
