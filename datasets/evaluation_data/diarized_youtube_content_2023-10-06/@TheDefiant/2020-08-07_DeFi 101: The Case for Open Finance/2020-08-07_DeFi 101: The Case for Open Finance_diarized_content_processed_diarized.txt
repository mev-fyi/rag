00:00:00.170 - 00:00:36.214, Speaker A: Back in 2017, if you were dipping a first toe into blockchain and cryptocurrencies, there is no doubt that you would have had your head sharply turned by ICOs, the fundraising craze that launched a thousand ships and sunk 10,000 more. Fast forward four years and a new craze has gripped this young space of ours. DFI. Not a verb, not a T shirt brand. It's actually let me slip on my Oxford English clippers here. A portmanto of decentralized and financed. Take two parts millennial anxiety in Gen Z, ambivalence towards legacy institutions, and stir in the tears of the.com
00:00:36.214 - 00:00:39.610, Speaker A: boom. Bang. That is Defi.
00:00:39.950 - 00:00:43.494, Speaker B: Or is it Camilla Russo, the voice.
00:00:43.622 - 00:00:47.686, Speaker C: Of DeFi, the face of DeFi. May I say, what is Defi?
00:00:47.798 - 00:01:25.958, Speaker D: DeFi is a parallel financial system being built without banks that's open to anyone, anywhere. What matters is that this group of financial applications are really making up a new parallel financial system. Way this is different from traditional finance is that anyone, anywhere in the world, can have access to these financial applications without giving up their personal information and keeping full control of their own money.
00:01:26.044 - 00:02:03.394, Speaker A: For the longest time, we believed that the source of all truth was libraries or those with access to better education than ourselves. But the Internet changed all of that. And if you think about it, money hasn't really changed for thousands of years, since the first barter trades began. But if we could survive a seismic shift in the way we communicate with each other, then we can absolutely survive a similar shift in the way we transact with each other. Defi isn't scary, or risky or political in of itself. It operates under two basic principles. One, your money is your money.
00:02:03.394 - 00:02:17.686, Speaker A: And two, once you accept the first principle to be true, then the world is your oyster. Borderless, free. You can do what you want. The way I think of this is.
00:02:17.708 - 00:02:43.550, Speaker B: That we have a dysfunctional relationship with money. We allow ourselves to be abused by the controls that are put around the money that we have. And as you said, people have control of their own money and over their own data. But I think most people would believe that actually, most of the time they don't. It's not under their control. They can access it and they can use it, but they don't actually own it.
00:02:43.620 - 00:03:38.740, Speaker D: Money is living in cages. Like each country has its own cage for its currency and its securities, like financial assets. So if you're in the US, US stocks, US bonds, the US dollar is all living in a little cage where only people with US bank accounts can access these assets in this cage. So they think that this distributed network, which is the rails for decentralized finance, what this does is it's one network, it's one financial network for the whole world, which means that all these cages are broken, and anyone can have free access to these applications and assets. This is incredible. I mean, this couldn't be done before.
00:03:41.590 - 00:03:58.520, Speaker A: Libertarians, anarchists, cypherpunks, they'd all love to Bedazzle you with a utopian future in which we are our own bank value flowing uninterrupted along peer to peer rails, free from the interference of banks, governments, or any regulatory body.
00:03:58.970 - 00:04:00.758, Speaker B: And that is the problem.
00:04:00.924 - 00:04:05.702, Speaker A: It all sounds too good to be true, or at worst, something out of a science fiction novel.
00:04:05.766 - 00:04:35.938, Speaker B: Do you think, in a way, that the word decentralized gets in the way when you talk about a parallel financial system? We start to get into this weird sort of Sci-fi thing where we're talking about parallel universes, and it feels sketchy and it feels wrong. That is the thing that we have to get past. In a weird way, when we talk about decentralized, maybe we need a different word. Maybe we need to say something online to open finance that feels like a more friendly construct for what we're talking about.
00:04:36.024 - 00:05:39.210, Speaker D: The fact that this system is open to anyone, anywhere is the key to why DeFi is important. So I think open finance is a great way to describe it. I think DeFi really picked up steam because it's decentralized finance, Defi, and it defies traditional finance. So it's kind of that cool play on two words, which I really like, and I use defi kind of for that reason. It does defy the traditional way where you're handing over control of your assets and your data to third parties that you can't be exactly sure what they're doing with it. In this system, it's transparent, and you have control. So I think open is a good way to start, and then we can get into defi and decentralization.
00:05:42.750 - 00:05:44.102, Speaker B: Decentralized finance.
00:05:44.166 - 00:06:13.118, Speaker A: Yeah, it's buzzy, but maybe the better expression of it is open finance. Open to you, to me, a weaver in pondicherry or a fisherman in Beirut, it does not matter. Open to everyone. So when you begin dipping a toe into defi, it can quickly become a kind of dick measuring contest of how much you know about complicated lending, trading, and cryptographic concepts. Please throw all of that out of the window right now. Don't feel stupid. Don't feel dumb.
00:06:13.118 - 00:06:48.366, Speaker A: It's all complicated, and it's all confusing, but it needn't be. If there's one thing you need to take away from this, it's this. Defi is not the exotic, dangerous, rowdy, anarchist shouting in the streets kind of thing you think it might be. DeFi is simply what your money would be if banks didn't exist. It's the purest form of finance there is. And there's one quote by Henry Ford that goes, it's well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system. But if they did, I believe there will be a revolution before tomorrow morning.
00:06:48.366 - 00:06:49.646, Speaker A: I mean, just hearing you talk about.
00:06:49.668 - 00:07:12.642, Speaker B: It, it feels so weird to me that the traditional banking system and everything that it represents is what we should be scared of. And yet somehow we're scared of the open, transparent thing, because it isn't a bank that just seems upside down. Somehow the banks still feel like we should trust them, and they have this legacy of just being.
00:07:12.696 - 00:07:13.150, Speaker A: It's where you.
00:07:13.160 - 00:07:22.154, Speaker B: What you do, it's where you put your money. I still have a hard time talking to friends of mine and explaining to them more defi. They just don't want to take that.
00:07:22.192 - 00:08:23.838, Speaker D: Step, because it's so different from the way things work today that it's hard for people to grasp kind of the importance of this. I think it really depends on where in the world you're at, because if you're in Europe or in the US, you're going to have trouble realizing why you should be concerned or worried about banks and financial institutions, because you've never had a baddie experience. If you're in other countries where banks have stopped people from taking out their deposits, then you might have a different reaction, and you might understand why it's important to have this alternative to the traditional banking system. This is a different way, like you said, of handling money, even thinking about money.
00:08:23.924 - 00:08:33.534, Speaker B: Decentralized finance, for me does is it's not a system that says yes or no. It's a system that doesn't care. It's simply there.
00:08:33.732 - 00:09:04.200, Speaker A: If you really want to interrogate your money, your value creation, who you are in the world, then it starts from posing a simple question, is my money really my money? And in Defi, the answer is yes. It will always be yes. And if that's your jam, then keep watching. If not, then the pressure from everything that DFI is currently building should result in improved legacy banking services anyway. So you win either way. Go you. This is DFI 101.
00:09:04.810 - 00:09:08.886, Speaker E: Been a little nice to y'all. Now I gotta up price for y'all. Snake eyes.
00:09:08.988 - 00:09:10.202, Speaker C: What is DFI?
00:09:10.386 - 00:09:11.840, Speaker B: You don't know, do you?
00:09:12.210 - 00:09:17.422, Speaker D: I have no idea. I've been writing over there for a year. But let's do that again.
00:09:17.476 - 00:09:20.350, Speaker A: But for now, record off record, I.
00:09:20.420 - 00:09:24.460, Speaker E: Still count winch when he daddy close.
