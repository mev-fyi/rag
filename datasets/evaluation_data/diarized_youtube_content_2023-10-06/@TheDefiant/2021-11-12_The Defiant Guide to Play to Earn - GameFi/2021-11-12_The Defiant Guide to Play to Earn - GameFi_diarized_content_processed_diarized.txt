00:00:13.050 - 00:00:51.518, Speaker A: Welcome to the defiant weekly. This week we're looking at play to earn and its evolution into what's now been called Gamefi. It's a big deal. It's the financialization of blockchain game, the use of Defi as a mechanism for helping people who play games earn while they're playing them, and then, of course, on ramping them into a Defi ecosystem that can do well, anything that Defi can do. So let's take a look at what's going on in the play to earn landscape right now, thanks to our friends at Hulk crypto. Well, that's a lot of games. And as you probably know, it's quite easy to make a game.
00:00:51.518 - 00:01:16.360, Speaker A: It's very difficult to make a good game. We got a bit of stick for even mentioning AA in the same conversation as Iluvium. All of these games here, none of them are AAA yet. They might get there, but at the moment, no. But it gives you an idea of how much is being built and how much of it plugs into this play to earn games landscape. It's a lot. And this isn't all of them either.
00:01:16.360 - 00:01:51.854, Speaker A: Global gaming statistics. So this is regular video games. As we know, it's growing rapidly and it probably hasn't been helped by COVID, everyone having to spend time indoors. But VR consoles and the rapid evolution of video cards from Nvidia 30 90s, for instance. Yeah, gaming is growing at a rate of nods, and it's also growing because people are now able to earn a living through esports. But there are 2.9 billion gamers on the planet that as a fraction of the global population, is getting towards a half.
00:01:51.854 - 00:02:04.882, Speaker A: Getting towards a half. $174.9 billion spent on video games in 2020. Lord alone knows what it's going to be in 2021. But this is a big deal. Gaming is massive. Blockchain games make a lot of sense.
00:02:04.882 - 00:02:29.366, Speaker A: And as we'll see as we go through this presentation. Yeah, it's going to be big. It is estimated that the global gaming market will amount to $268.8 billion annually in 2025. Yeah, set to be $178,000,000,000 this year. Still big in North America, big growth in Asia. But then, of course, with Axio Infinity, it's the Philippines, it's Southeast Asia.
00:02:29.366 - 00:03:02.246, Speaker A: It's places where we don't normally expect to see gaming. And part of that's to do with mobile gaming. But in game purchases that are estimated to account for more than $74 million worldwide. $74 million just in game purchases. And of course, in regular games, those in game purchases can't be transferred. It's just literally just what people are spending to have a different experience within the game. Imagine if you unlocked all of that and opened it up to transferable assets, to taking points earned in one game, transferring them to another.
00:03:02.246 - 00:03:26.490, Speaker A: It's been talked about for a while, but you can kind of start to see the scope of the opportunity here and why everyone is so excited about it. So the blockchain perspective on this. So this is looking at the volume in the past 30 days. Axi is just massive. Absolutely massive. 743,000 users, $2.17 billion in volume.
00:03:26.490 - 00:04:01.818, Speaker A: Unbelievable. So yeah, big deal. Blockchain games play to earn. There's a lot of crap out there, let's be honest. But I think we can all tell there's something here. And if we think about games that are being built from blockchain first and then out towards the regular video game world, we also have to think about regular video game developers, IRL video game developers starting to add a defi layer or a blockchain layer on top of what they do already. That's really going to open the doors to something colossal happening here.
00:04:01.818 - 00:04:06.170, Speaker A: And we'll get into all of that just after these messages from our sponsors.
00:04:06.750 - 00:04:48.178, Speaker B: Don't let high gas costs keep you out of Ethereum at balancer, the gas optimized vault architecture makes trading cheaper than anywhere else.

00:05:56.930 - 00:06:34.426, Speaker A: So if we're going to start talking about play to earn, which leads us to gamefire, we have to talk about Axio Infinity. And this chart here just, I mean, it's astonishing. It's astonishing. The growth curve, it's just a monstrous climb ever upwards, ever upwards, ever upwards. The average monthly player is just climbing through the roof, the active daily players climbing through the roof. But what you'll notice is that the red line, which is the monthly gain loss, is sort of stable, weirdly. And actually during the kind of bear market of the spring, it dropped significantly and it's sort of just stabilized now.
00:06:34.426 - 00:07:10.578, Speaker A: But there was a point at which this was growing massively and everyone got really excited. Of course, we'll get into this a little bit later on and the implications of SLB and its price action in the market. But Axie is where this all begins. And it's the project which everyone references as the thing. It's worth bearing in mind that back in 2017, everyone was talking about cryptokitties, the ability to breed these kitties and then grow these things. Cryptokitties was a big deal, but Axi probably never looked like it was going to be a big deal, but now it is. And now it's axi that we refer to in terms of blockchain games and not cryptokitties anymore.
00:07:10.578 - 00:07:40.074, Speaker A: But I remember last year making a film about Avagotchi, for instance, and nobody could talk about NFTs without mentioning cryptokitties. Now they've just disappeared from the conversation and the dialogue around NFTs has moved on. That is very clear. This is the AXS token. This is the governance token for Axio Infinity. It's their internal token. And you can see the growth year to date, 25,000% if you bought.
00:07:40.074 - 00:07:58.690, Speaker A: Here you are now here you've done very well. Congratulations. Some result. So if you had high conviction about blockchain games, well, there you go, vindicated. There's a lot of investment coming in. This is just one example. Salana FTX and Lightspeed have launched 100 million dollar blockchain gaming fund.
00:07:58.690 - 00:08:31.546, Speaker A: Salana are very serious about NFTs and they're very serious about gaming. They're not going to be the only ones though. And why it's significant that Salana have done this is because they have a very strong relationship with FTX. They also have a very high speed, low cost chain that should support gaming at scale for low cost. And that's very, very important because you can't do blockchain gaming where you need constant interactions with the chain. On Ethereum, for instance, it just gets too expensive. And if you want to onboard normal people, you have to set the price expectations proportionately to what people can afford.
00:08:31.546 - 00:08:50.530, Speaker A: And most people are not defi degenerates. Look at this. Ubisoft is making play to earn blockchain games. Who are ubisoft again? Massive french company. Big deal. Yes. Ubisoft Electronic Arts CEO thinks NFTs and play to earn are part of the future of the gaming industry.
00:08:50.530 - 00:09:38.802, Speaker A: Well, I was talking about big gaming companies coming in and they are. So what is play to earn? Well, it's a business model that provides financial benefits to all players who add value by contributing to the game world. It's the latest development in the games industry and brings new concepts and retention models not yet seen in modern gaming. So hopefully, if you've played video games, you're used to this idea of grinding, which is you play the game over a long period of time and you just keep at it, keep at it and do really menial tasks to level up your characters and create value in your characters within the game. All of that value is locked up inside that game ecosystem and you can't unlock it yourself. It's just simply internal value. In an internal economy, play to earn unlocks that value, unlocks the effort that you put into a game and gives it back to you and gives you ownership over the assets.
00:09:38.802 - 00:09:57.498, Speaker A: In a tangible financial sense. That's play to earn. So let's have a look at some of the kind of comparisons that we have here. Pay to play. You buy a game to play it. So you buy a license from a digital store or a physical copy. This is how games used to be.
00:09:57.498 - 00:10:36.002, Speaker A: You buy a cartridge for your console, you buy a Blu ray or a CDrom for your PC. You had to pay to play the game. Nowadays you download it from a website, but that was the model. Then there was free to play, so you had an always downloadable experience. Fortnite is a good example of this game's free to play, but there are kind of moments where you can pay to speed up your progress, buy skins, basically, there's a whole secondary market. So it's like a gateway drug, essentially. You give it to people for free, then they get hooked, and then they just want to keep playing or they want to speed up their progress.
00:10:36.002 - 00:11:18.946, Speaker A: And this is this idea of freemium. We've seen that in mobile games as well. If game developers didn't want to have ad revenue powering the revenue streams in their game to do a freemium model, so they would throttle the game, make it harder and harder and harder to progress, unless you were paying for items to speed up your progress, hence making it harder and harder. Harder. It's kind of like a kind of weird cult Ponzi scheme in a sense. It's not really a Ponzi scheme, but the way that cults will continually charge you to progress through a self help system by getting you hooked on it. And there's this sunk cost fallacy as well.
00:11:18.946 - 00:11:41.290, Speaker A: As I've come this far, now, I need to go further, and there's always the allure of something further. It's addiction mechanics, 100%. But I think we know this by now. With video games, there's a dopamine hit that you receive when you get what they call an attaboy. It's a little kind of gift or a piece of progress that you get through. That's video gaming. It's built into the mechanics of how these things work.
00:11:41.290 - 00:12:15.750, Speaker A: Then we get to play to earn, which gives games gamers ownership over in game assets and allows them to increase their value by actively playing the game. So you put time in, you get something back. And it's not like you don't get something back in these other models. It's just that now you could take this thing that you get and turn it into real money, which wasn't really the case before. So here are some examples. Axie Infinity, of course, you as a player earns SLP smooth love potion by battling with your axie. You can breed new axes with SLP or sell them on the open marketplace.
00:12:15.750 - 00:13:17.066, Speaker A: They're so rare, so fancy football game using NFTs so you can win rewards and buy and sell digital player cards, just like a trading card game, Star Atlas. This is a huge game, and the token will be generated through in game mining, market making, and trade, and there's going to be player versus player missions, Pve missions, and resource gathering, that kind of thing. So just a massive kind of jump in, and it's a proper grinding game, that one. And then there's Krabada. You can mine, loot, breed, and expand your forces and earn cra tokens by playing and use them to determine the future of the kingdom. Doesn't that look fun? There's going to be an absolute embarrassment of. I hate to say the word riches, but possibilities in this space, if you are a blockchainer, and I suspect that if you're investigating something like the Solana ecosystem or binance smart chain as well, there's going to be a lot of low cost options that can be easily plugged into Defi mechanics as well.
00:13:17.066 - 00:13:52.614, Speaker A: DeFi on BSC is, well, it's its whole own ecosystem, and there's a lot of scams on there. Yeah, but there's a lot of people that use that chain because they just didn't want to be on Ethereum. So there's a user base that likes games over there. So it's very, very early days, and even earlier were some of these options. So Gambit was a place where you could play very, very simple games for blockchain. And then Bombermind was an early game that incorporated some bitcoin elements as well. So it's not like blockchain gaming is new, per se.
00:13:52.614 - 00:14:14.986, Speaker A: It's just that it's finally found its feet, in a sense. And I guess it's mainly thanks to defi that it's been able to do that. And this is where we get to gamify. So this quote from Andre is pretty significant. Gamification applied to monetary policies excites me so much. Your funds are becoming geared to use in this defi game. Till now, we've been cloning tradfi.
00:14:14.986 - 00:14:52.486, Speaker A: Going forward, we go into Gamefi, and it was interesting that Andre caught the loot bug a few months back and built his own game on Phantom. But with Andre, we have someone who really understands money value, Defi. But now he's building this game layer on top. And the game itself creates addiction. Yes, it creates an experience. It allows your interactions with money and finance to be experienced in a way that is eludic. It's fun, it's playful, and that's really going to transform so much of the way we interact with protocols.
00:14:52.486 - 00:15:23.554, Speaker A: They will be gamified, and that may not necessarily be a good thing. It may trivialize things that shouldn't be trivialized, but it just seems like the way we interact with the world through screens, through interfaces, is becoming more and more gamified. Anyway, so this seems like a logical way to go. So we have a couple of different flavors of play to earn. So p two, p two, e pay to play to earn. This is like Axio Infinity. You need to buy three axes before you can start battling them.
00:15:23.554 - 00:16:08.238, Speaker A: At the moment, it costs around about $600. That's quite a lot, really, isn't it? If you kind of take your crypto hat off and start thinking about $600 in the real world irl, what could you do with that? Well, quite a lot. And if you're someone who lives in the Philippines, which is the hotbed of Axio Infinity, $600 is a lot of money. So rare simile. You have to invest money in player cards before you can play, and then you have free to play to earn games. So League of Kingdoms, we have lands which are nfts and owned by users, so it's free to play, and then you sort of slowly level up over time. And there are these two different models, but I suspect pay to play to earn is probably going to be the one that sees the most traction initially, but hopefully we see some more free to play to earn.
00:16:08.238 - 00:16:35.702, Speaker A: It feels a little bit like freemium model app, but again, some distinctions there to be made. So let's talk about the problem that these games are trying to solve. This Fortnite statistic is crazy. Fortnite alone was responsible for $1.8 billion in revenue, even though the game is free. So this is the thing. Players in Fortnite spend money on stuff to change the appearance of their character.
00:16:35.702 - 00:17:17.862, Speaker A: But if you stop playing that game, then what can you do with it? Absolutely nothing. And lots of games are adding coins and internal currencies into their games because they recognize the value of all of that and what people are prepared to spend on items because it's a kind of clout. It represents who you are. It shows people that you've progressed through a game, and there's value in that from a reputational point of view. But once you're out of that game, then who cares? I love this quote. Blizzard removed the damaged component from my beloved Warlock's siphon life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring.
00:17:17.862 - 00:18:00.902, Speaker A: So this is the pain suffered by one user of World of Warcraft, when he realized that all the value and time he'd invested in playing this game had just been rugged at a moment's notice. And who was that person? It was Vitalik. And this is one of the reasons why Vitalik formed Ethereum, because he realized that that system of centralized value creation was just not something he wanted to sign up to. Anymore. And this is someone for whom gaming is kind of big, part of their identity and the weird kind of world that Vitalik exists in. You can understand why he's obsessed with game theory and designing systems, but this is where he comes from. So play to earn changes.
00:18:00.902 - 00:18:48.514, Speaker A: All this, all obtained items represent a certain value. This means you will always be able to make some money. The moment you step away from a game, there will always be realizable value. It comes with a caveat, but we'll come back to that in a bit. So even when a gamer needs to pay you to start playing again, these acquired items can always be sold again. So once you step into this ecosystem, you get onto a treadmill, and you can start earning by playing, and you can keep earning by playing, even if you step away, and even if you just have a simple item that you can sell, you can keep playing the game. It's about agency, and we've talked about this so many times in terms of the metaverse, the ability to create agency for players, so that even when you're in a tight spot, there's a way out of whatever spot you find yourself in.
00:18:48.514 - 00:19:16.154, Speaker A: I understand that's a pretty utopian view of all of this, and it won't necessarily be the case. There's probably a lot of other games that appear to be like this but aren't. But that's the point. This is an emerging space, and we need to talk about these things and understand how they're working in order to create better examples of them. So this axie phenomenon, Sky Mavis is the company behind it, vietnamese company. And they were inspired by Pokemon. It's a really simple concept.
00:19:16.154 - 00:19:42.450, Speaker A: You have these creatures, you collect them, you breed them, you grow them, and then you set them to work battling each other. I mean, it's exactly like Pokemon. Basically, they're represented by ERC, 20 tokens, and they can be traded on secondary market. So there's a free market trade for all of this. $3.18 billion in volume, over a million in traders, 9 million sales so far. It's just a phenomenon, absolute phenomenon.
00:19:42.450 - 00:20:31.240, Speaker A: And we can see here, one went for 369 e four months ago. So these things are highly desirable at the very top end, the very best axes, as we said, $600 to play the game. Quite expensive. So one of the interesting aspects of the Axio infinity ecosystem is this idea of scholarships. So let's say I have a stable of axes, and I have people who want to play the game. I can actually sponsor a player with axes so that they can play the game. So that scholar, as they're called, will play the game and earn SLP, and I will take a small percentage of the earnings of that.
00:20:31.240 - 00:21:25.638, Speaker A: You know, as a wealthy patron, I could hoover up a bunch of axes and then I could set up scholarships for players and they play. And then I just take a cut of, yeah, it's earning rent from axes. And then there is Ygg. And YGG is yield guild games. And this is essentially, it's a mechanism for creating scholarships, creating communities of scholarships clustered around a token Ygg to create scholarship programs not just for Axie Infinity, but also for a bunch of different games that are in this play to earn space. But Axie Infinity is where it starts. This is Gabby Dizon, who's from the Philippines, clearly understands that market extremely well and saw an opportunity here to create something sustainable and wholesome for a community that really wanted this.
00:21:25.638 - 00:21:56.722, Speaker A: And I think we've seen the stories now of what happened during COVID when people were literally paying their bills by playing Axio Infinity. There is a degree to which there are some problems with this model. I've heard it called slavery. I think that's extreme. But yeah, I don't know. How do you feel about it? Let us know in the comments below, because I'm conflicted about this. It feels desperate in some ways, it feels exploitative in some ways, but maybe it's not.
00:21:56.722 - 00:22:46.560, Speaker A: Maybe I'm being too harsh on it, but you could see how an entity could exploit players that want to be in this ecosystem. So I will kind of have to see how that one develops. But I know YGG are recruiting scholarship managers from their community, so there's opportunities for people to earn an income outside of just playing the game and level up through a community. And it's growing really fast. Really, really fast. So can you really earn living from P two E? So on average, Axio Infinity players are making $400 a month, which is under the taxation threshold of $5,000 per year here in the Philippines. And the average salary in the Philippines is $3,218.
00:22:46.560 - 00:23:32.878, Speaker A: It's humbling, isn't it? Yikes. So the top five countries that play Axio Infinity, Philippines, Venezuela, United States, Thailand and Brazil. But yeah, Philippines overwhelmingly. And of course, if all our activities clustered in the Philippines, then is it really representative of the rest of the world? I don't know, but you can imagine that there will be other games maybe built in Latin American, hispanic countries that tap into that audience. I don't know. But certainly the Philippines has been leading the way in this regard, people are actually recognizing the fact that playing video games and earning an income from it, that's legitimate work. We've been seeing this narrative for the last five years that esports is a legitimate way to earn a living.
00:23:32.878 - 00:24:00.774, Speaker A: College degrees, sponsorships, scholarships, all these kind of things. For something where you sit down and play with your thumbs, I think there's a recognition that there is a huge amount of skill involved and the stress involved in playing these games at the very highest level. Plus there's a TV audience for it. Look at Twitch. People will spend hours and hours and hours watching gaming. It was telling when we put our alluvium video out, how quickly people jumped on me for saying I wasn't a gamer. I have been a gamer.
00:24:00.774 - 00:24:37.402, Speaker A: I am not a gamer now. I've just got too much to do. But I certainly haven't spent any time hanging out in gamer channels watching gamer content. And that's on me. I should we are starting to move more into Unreal Engine and more into production that overlaps with gaming technology. We'll have to do our homework because, yeah, there's more that we need to know, and I accept that. So what about the risks in all of this? So in the pay to play model, which is what Axio Infinity is, you need to put up an initial investment to purchase characters and items to play the game, and it's quite possible that you will overpay.
00:24:37.402 - 00:24:56.310, Speaker A: It's quite difficult to navigate your way through the axio infinity marketplace and try and understand what represents a good buy or not. There's a huge amount of market volatility. This is the chart for SLP. Smooth love potion. Ridiculous. Look at the spike up here. Bang.
00:24:56.310 - 00:25:07.566, Speaker A: And back down again. That is a monster spike. But then it happened again. Again. And then this one. Bang up. That was the top of the real hype phase back in May.
00:25:07.566 - 00:25:34.918, Speaker A: Bosch, down. So if you were basically playing the game here, and you were projecting your earnings, your income per month based on figures that you calculated up here, you were in for a nasty surprise. Bang. But then this is even worse, because then it went back up here. And if you had done that, you would have thought, oh, it was all right, that was just a blip. It was just a bear market. But then, boom, back down again, down to here.
00:25:34.918 - 00:26:23.350, Speaker A: That's a huge spread between this point up here, around $0.33. All the way down here to around $0.07. You cannot in any way, shape or form project your monthly income and think about your overheads, paying your bills, paying your rent, paying for your groceries based on that, you just can't. The token is way too volatile. Granted, it has settled down, but when I looked on Twitter, I saw so many posts from people just angry. Angry at what they perceived was VCs dumping their tokens or people just dumping, dumping, dumping. The way markets work is when people are heavily in profit, they start to sell, and then they want to preserve their position, they want to protect what they have, they sell.
00:26:23.350 - 00:26:58.660, Speaker A: That is what happens. Unless SLP is a stablecoin, this is always going to happen. You can't have a tradable asset like this that isn't pegged to something without the volatility. So when people talk about earning a living through SLP and through playing Axio infinity, sure, fine. But show me those figures over the course of two years and let's see where we're at and whether it was actually possible during a bear market, you will see this get crushed even further. It's inevitable. So yeah, I think it's right to be skeptical about that.
00:26:58.660 - 00:27:35.454, Speaker A: Axes can be stolen, you can be hacked. All of the usual smart contract risks, of course, and axes now running on ronin chain. Ronin chain is quite centralized, I'll be honest. And the katana decks is very localized. And so if something happens, some kind of fud happens around axie liquidity will be yanked in a heartbeat. And that's problematic for axie infinity. It'd be interesting to see whether they take on some bond based liquidity like ohm, which I think helps protect against that.
00:27:35.454 - 00:28:19.930, Speaker A: But yes, there's always that risk. Environmental concerns. Well, we've heard this narrative around NFTs and how bad they are for the environment if they're on Ethereum. Not going to kind of go any further with that, but I think it's an easy stone to throw at NFTs, and it's probably not legitimate, but we can now see that there are viable layer one alternatives, salana, avalanche, harmony wax. And then there's layer twos as well, like immutable X polygon. Of course, there's quite a few games that went on Polygon, like Avogotchi. Curious how immutable X is going to pick up, but illuvium is on there, for instance.
00:28:19.930 - 00:29:05.446, Speaker A: So definitely low cost, low fee, almost zero fee alternatives, and plenty of defi to plug in as well. More liquidity, more value to come in and start playing the game. So I think those cons are kind of going away. This is an interesting one. This is someone that's using bots to farm SLP in Axio infinity. So I was talking about Ygg, which is a guild. So these guilds have formalized the method of lending in game assets in the form of NFTs.
00:29:05.446 - 00:30:02.790, Speaker A: And they're basically a community that pairs people who want to make money playing Axio infinity with the NFTs. They need to start in the game. So it's kind of taking the idea of scholarships and forming a methodology, a community around that. This is YGD talking about the number of Axis scholars they have 1500 plus. But yeah, this is an emerging category where global communities of scholars can cluster around kind of what will become big brand name guilds to play all sorts of different games. And hopefully there'll be some educational components of that coaching as well, and maybe the ability to borrow and lend different axes and team up together. But this idea of formalizing the relationship between players and scholars, I think is going to be a big deal and be interesting to see what happens with YGG.
00:30:02.790 - 00:30:28.242, Speaker A: And certainly it's making some waves at the moment. So the pros of playing play to earn, you've got new and improved revenue stream. Value generated in the games doesn't accrue solely to the platform owners, and the value doesn't disappear once you start playing. It's all built on smart contracts, so we can trust the code most of the time. It's immutable. So you own what you own, and no one can say that you don't. And then you have provenance.
00:30:28.242 - 00:30:54.142, Speaker A: So if an axe came from a celebrity, then you might gain some cred from that. But you definitely know where the axe came from. You definitely know who its parents were. If it was a bread one, definitely you can prove the value of your item. Irrefutably big question here. Is it decentralized? I talked about Ronin Chain not being that centralized. It's not really, and it doesn't need to be per se.
00:30:54.142 - 00:31:25.320, Speaker A: Decentralization is a sliding scale yield. Guild games is based around a Dow. So here, token holders can produce and vote on project update proposals. This will have an effect most of the time on the monetary features. So the DaO may vote to increase the reward for a certain action within the game as a means of promotion. But YGG's main goal is to generate more revenue, to make more money from the opportunities presented by these play to earn games. That's what they're there to do.
00:31:25.320 - 00:32:15.426, Speaker A: The jury's out on whether Dow has really kind of fulfilled a brief on full decentralization, but it's certainly better than anything we've had before, that's for sure. The alien world planet Dao, you can stake TLM, and this is how you can support a planet to receive greater daily TLM rewards. By staking TLM on a planet, players also gain voting rights according to the amount of TLM staked. So again, there's another ecosystem where you can be part of a dao and gain greater rewards. That's in your hands. We also have like Avogotchi, when it came out, was notable because you're able to put other tokens into your avogatchi, and those other tokens would earn yield. So your avogatchi was a yield generating asset.
00:32:15.426 - 00:32:44.138, Speaker A: It's pretty cool. So with Avagotchi, you can purchase and grow avagotchis and then kind of roam around the digital universe. And the rarity score is calculated by specific character traits. You've got wearables, and then in Defi kingdoms on harmony, you can swap farm, LP and stake. And we looked at Alluvium earlier this week. This has some fairly interesting staking mechanics built in. You get a double booster reward if you stake and lock up for a year.
00:32:44.138 - 00:33:23.422, Speaker A: But you can also unlock your staked rewards early with a synthetic token that can only be played in games. So you've got this hybrid model there, and I'm expecting to see more farms, more staking opportunities coming up as we start to see these games mature. And how do you know, do you get started? Well, pick a game, choose a blockchain, set up a wallet, deposit funds, pick between pay to play to earn and free to play to earn. Get involved on defi mechanisms. Have fun. Now this channel speaks quite in depth about Defi and trying to understand Defi. It's worth thinking about.
00:33:23.422 - 00:34:02.282, Speaker A: Defi really is this. It is money, but decentralized it is you free to go and pick whatever product you want to interact with without anyone telling you that you cannot. You can get a loan, you can get a savings product, you are free to pick your own path. That's Defi, the gaming component of this. It's just going to allow you to extract maximum value from what you have and slowly, slowly over time, because it's a bit of grinding involved. Get to somewhere where that money is worth a little bit more. But you've had some fun along the way, hopefully as well.
00:34:02.282 - 00:34:55.194, Speaker A: But it gives you an opportunity. I think that's what's interesting about play to earn. I am yet to be convinced that play to earn is the model that we're really going to land on as the kind of apex of blockchain gaming, but it's certainly been a big year for play to earn and I certainly see ways in which it could be improved. But I would love to see what a play to earn system or setup would look like on Terra, for instance, where I feel like there's a really strong defi ecosystem there. I would love to see it on Polkadot Avalanche. Yeah, I just want to see this thing mature more. I do have some misgivings about guilds and about scholars and about all of that, but maybe I'm wrong, but I think it's worth kind of being a little bit circumspect about that because I don't think it's perfect just yet.
00:34:55.194 - 00:35:28.870, Speaker A: So that was the defiance guide to play to earn, just a kind of top level insight into what's going on here, what the opportunities are and why this thing has happened in the first place. It's a big world with a lot of games being built, a lot of crap being built. But maybe, just maybe, we will start to see big game companies actually adopt this at scale and turn AAA games into AA Defi games. And that really would be something. This was the defiant I've been catch us on the next one. Don't forget to subscribe. Like do all that stuff.
00:35:28.870 - 00:35:32.450, Speaker A: Drop a comment. I'll see you on the next one. Peace.
