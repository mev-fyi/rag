00:00:00.250 - 00:00:13.630, Speaker A: Inscriptions make no sense at all. I think they're a fad. I think everyone is trying to follow the success of ordinals on bitcoin. They're bound to die off. It just makes no sense for smart contracts platforms.
00:00:15.730 - 00:00:26.578, Speaker B: A shout out to our sponsor. This video is sponsored by Stellar Community Fund, an open application awards program to support developers and startups on stellar and Soravan.
00:00:26.674 - 00:00:46.554, Speaker A: Shout out to metamask portfolio, your one stop shop to track and manage your web. Three assets in one place. More on them later. Welcome everyone, to another episode of Crypto with Cami, where we go over all the major developments, headlines, news from Crypto and web three for the past week.
00:00:46.672 - 00:00:48.634, Speaker B: In this episode, we'll be covering the.
00:00:48.672 - 00:00:50.838, Speaker A: Week of December 18.
00:00:50.934 - 00:01:58.770, Speaker B: This week was all about Salana and other so called layer ones. The best performers in the past seven days were near and say, which rallied by more than 50%, and Internet, computer or ICP, which was up by more than 40%. Solana was also in the top ten. So the resurgence of Solana this year has prompted crypto investors and traders to take a renewed interest in a new generation of blockchains that leverage parallel execution and high transaction speeds throughput scalability. That's the name of the game right now. So Saul, Sei and Sui, which have all been among the top performers in the past weeks and months, all have the feature that they are able to process transactions simultaneously, unlike Ethereum and bitcoin, which process transactions sequentially. So this is kind of the new theme, the new trend that traders are looking at.
00:01:58.770 - 00:03:05.622, Speaker B: And the whole idea really is to catch the new Solana, which has been the surprise outperformer this year after everyone kind of thought it was dead in the midst of the FTX collapse. A reminder that Sambankman fried was a huge backer of Solana and of the Solana ecosystem. So this year has just proven to be an incredible comeback story for Seoul, and an interesting theme following from this Solana rally. This kind of parallel blockchain execution environment rally is the relative underperformance for ETH. So bitcoin has been on a tear, Sol has been on a tear. All of these other OD layer ones have also been up and surging. But meanwhile, Ethereum has lagged, has pretty much traded sideways, certainly hasn't seen the gains that these other L ones have seen.
00:03:05.622 - 00:04:03.900, Speaker B: And so we're seeing, again, a huge underperformance. If you look at the Sol to ETH chart, you're seeing that Sol versus ETH is up by the most since 2022. And likewise with the Bitcoin Ethereum chart, the ratio is up by the most since 2021. So huge underperformance from Ethereum, but there are good news on the way. So this week was the last all core devs call. So Ethereum developers have these periodic meetings where they discuss the roadmap, the future upgrades and tech updates. And there's a really important update coming up for Ethereum in the next few months.
00:04:03.900 - 00:05:13.506, Speaker B: And this is the Denkun upgrade. Denkun is from the Cancun Deneb upgrade, so people are shorting it to Denkun. And in this week's all core devs call, it was agreed that the Testnet launch for this upgrade would be in January. And so this is significant because once the testnet is launched and is proving to be successful, that it can execute with no issues, then of course the next thing will be the main net deployment, which shouldn't be so far out after the Testnet launch. So why is denkun important? It has two key features that will be included. One is these large data packages called blobs, and the second is so called proto tank sharding. So leave it to Ethereum to come.
00:05:13.528 - 00:05:19.490, Speaker A: Up with these hugely complicated or weird sounding names.
00:05:19.830 - 00:05:23.906, Speaker B: But anyways, blobs are going to be.
00:05:23.928 - 00:05:28.358, Speaker A: Introduced with EAP 4844, and they're important.
00:05:28.444 - 00:06:20.582, Speaker B: Because again, they bundle these data chunks in their own, think of it as a separate highway to be processed in. So Ethereum will have a separate lane for processing big data chunks that will be separate from the regular transactions that are being processed by the blockchain. So this should increase and improve efficiency in the Ethereum blockchain. So that's the data blobs. And then the second key change that Denkun introduces is, like I mentioned, protodank sharding. And Protodank sharding is crucial because it's a step towards the implementation of sharding. And sharding will allow the blockchain to.
00:06:20.636 - 00:06:28.986, Speaker A: Split into smaller pieces called shards, which moves interestingly in the direction that we.
00:06:29.008 - 00:07:28.122, Speaker B: Were talking about before in these parallel execution environments. So with sharding, Ethereum will be able to further scale at the main net, at the layer one level, by splitting the blockchain in smaller blockchains. That will increase the amount of throughput many times over. So this denkun update is a big step towards scalability and towards lowering gas fees for Ethereum. So who knows, maybe this underperformance will turn around in the next few months when these updates are being implemented or ahead of the implementation of these updates. Now back to the Solana theme. There's tons of Solana news.
00:07:28.122 - 00:08:15.354, Speaker B: This render render is AI crypto projects. It does actually decentralized GPU. So render is one of the top performing cryptocurrencies out there this year. I think it was the top four Ethereum based token of at least 10 million in market cap in the past year. It's up ten X and it's all driven by this hype around AI and crypto. We have a feature saying that there's actual substance to this hype that you should check out.
00:08:15.472 - 00:08:16.954, Speaker A: But in any case, the news this.
00:08:16.992 - 00:08:56.290, Speaker B: Week was that render is switching over to the Solana network. Render used to be an Ethereum token. Now it's going to be a Solana based token. The team said that they reviewed a number of different blockchains, including Polygon, Cosmos, Algorand, Optimism, and Aptos, but the community ended up voting for Salana. Among factors they considered were the developer community throughput, liquidity, transaction fees and programming language. One caveat is that the vote wasn't super decentralized. There were only ten votes cast.
00:08:56.290 - 00:09:46.674, Speaker B: But that being said, another sign that a lot of the developer founder Trader Mindshare is going over to Solana. Same with Ondo finance. Ondo is a real world asset. They issue these tokens, which are backed by US treasuries, OUSG and Usdy. They are both on Ethereum, but now they are also launching these tokens on Solana. They're not moving from Ethereum, they're still on Ethereum, but they will also be issuing these tokens on Solana. And the reason for the move, they said, is because trading volume on Dexs.
00:09:46.802 - 00:10:04.670, Speaker A: On Solana actually surpassed Ethereum's volume on DExs in December. So that's pretty inoidable. Now, staying on their real world asset theme, Frax, which issues a decentralized stablecoin.
00:10:05.010 - 00:10:33.670, Speaker B: Voted to deploy 20 million of its collateral into US treasuries. They are using centrifuge to do this. So centrifuge has a service called Centrifuge prime, which offers kind of an off the shelf service for Dow treasuries to diversify their assets. And so they're helping Daos put part of their treasuries into US treasuries.
00:10:35.370 - 00:10:36.166, Speaker A: US.
00:10:36.348 - 00:11:02.560, Speaker B: Government bonds, to again help diversify their assets, which super important for dows that often have all of their assets on their own token, or on volatile cryptocurrencies. So to have one service that really handles all the transactions the legal side of it.
00:11:03.510 - 00:11:09.838, Speaker A: To manage these investments in US Treasuries.
00:11:10.014 - 00:11:23.830, Speaker B: Will be hugely beneficial. I see a lot more of these Dao toolings being developed, and as Daos professionalize and handle larger and larger treasuries.
00:11:24.490 - 00:11:45.086, Speaker A: They'Ll become increasingly important parts of these ecosystems. Services like what centrifuge is providing and I think fracs diversifying their treasury is a smart move and I think a thing that we'll see more of in.
00:11:45.108 - 00:12:02.050, Speaker C: The future need funding for your blockchain idea? The Stellar community Fund is funding projects with up to $100,000 in XLM per project to build on the stellar network. To get started, head over to Communityfund stellar.org and make a submission.
00:12:02.950 - 00:12:15.426, Speaker B: Do more in web three your way metamask portfolio provides secure, easy to use and convenient access to a wide range of web three features and services all in one place. View and manage all your coins, tokens.
00:12:15.458 - 00:12:17.826, Speaker A: And NFTs in one place by connecting.
00:12:17.858 - 00:12:21.238, Speaker B: Your metamask wallet or importing multiple wallet addresses.
00:12:21.334 - 00:12:24.054, Speaker A: You can also buy, sell, swap, bridge.
00:12:24.102 - 00:12:40.266, Speaker B: And stake within the app, finding competitive rates and options among their vetted list of providers. Instead of connecting to multiple exchanges and tools, you just need to connect to one simple dap to navigate your web three journey. Now moving on to Linear.
00:12:40.458 - 00:13:27.502, Speaker A: Linear is a layer two network from consensus and this week their voyage campaign was wrapped up concluded, and that has driven down activity, unfortunately. So Linear had this campaign called Voyage. It was ten so called waves of tasks that users had to perform across six weeks, and participants in this campaign were rewarded with XP points, which are soul bound tokens. And of course, these incentives in points drove a surge in activity, with obvious.
00:13:27.556 - 00:13:47.880, Speaker B: Speculation that there will be an airdrop in the future that corresponds with the points. So Linear's throughput quickly picked up in the middle of the campaign, from around 1.6 transactions per second before the campaign to an all time high of around.
00:13:48.330 - 00:14:48.678, Speaker A: 14.9 TPS, even overtaking Ethereum's TPS. However, that has now receded to about five TPs, so higher than before the campaign, but certainly not at the levels of around 15 TPs that they saw at the highs. Similarly, same thing happened with base, that's Coinbase's layer two. They also had this task driven campaign called on chain Summer. TPS soared during on chain summer campaign from same around five TPS to over 15. Friend Tech, which was this popular social Phi app launch on base helped to prolong this activity, but now that friend tech hype has kind of died down, so has activity on base same thing happened to scroll another l two.
00:14:48.678 - 00:16:07.460, Speaker A: They had this kind of point based program TPS searched, and now it's come back down to earth. So if you want to know more about my thoughts on points, check out last week's crypto with Cami. Spoiler alert, I'm not super bullish on points, but we shall see. And let's hope that this kind of volatile activity isn't foreboding for Eigen layer, the restaking protocol. So Eigen layer has been accepting deposits of liquid staking tokens which can be used to secure other networks other than Ethereum and earn stake from not just Ethereum staking, but from these other networks that you're helping secure thanks to Eigen layer. And they had a cap of deposits at 120,000 ETH, but this week they raised it to 500,000 ETH, and they were able to almost meet that cap in under a day. So the 500,000 ETH is around a billion dollars, and they attracted over $700 million under one day after they raised the cap.
00:16:07.460 - 00:17:18.620, Speaker A: So, crazy numbers again. Larry is proving to be a hugely successful protocol. They've really popularized restaking, and it really shows that people are interested in putting their ETH to work that, but also Eigen layer is also driving activity with points and incentivizing activity with points. So we just mentioned what's happening with all these layer twos and their point system. Once they expire, we shall see whether same thing happens with Eigen layer. In the end, the success of points depends on how good the protocol is. So if Eigen layer is offering a valuable service, if people are happy earning this yield from restaking, then there's no reason to think that all of these deposits will dry up.
00:17:18.620 - 00:18:28.894, Speaker A: Maybe a portion of it will leave after points are done, but we'll see. I think Eigen layer is actually innovating and providing an attractive service, I guess. But again, TBD, what happens after points are done and staying on Eigen layer? Quick news here. So they've launched restate roll ups together with alt layer. And what this does is it allows dapps to spin up their own layer twos using this modularity idea, where devs are able to pick and choose different pieces across the layer two stack, that makes the most sense for them. So from the settlement layer to data availability and sequencer, they're able to pick which models of these pieces of the stack make more sense for them. So, interesting.
00:18:28.894 - 00:19:28.770, Speaker A: We'll see. Even if this takes off, we'll see even more fragmentation of layer twos. We're seeing so many layer twos launch this year and with this we should see even more, which it just makes the need for good ux to connect between all these layer twos even more needed. So we'll see how this develops. Now moving on to NFT news. So frame is an NFT focused blockchain that announced funding from led by Electric Capital. Together with the funding news, they also announced an airdrop, which they are distributing frame tokens for NFT traders that were active in the bear market.
00:19:28.770 - 00:20:41.202, Speaker A: So if you're an NFT trader and you transacted, bought and sold NFTs in the past two years, you might be eligible for frame tokens. It's interesting that frame wants to protect creators from the blockchain itself, like it's encoded in the blockchain itself, that creators will receive royalties from NFT transactions. Of course, this has been a real hot topic with platforms like Blur and OpenSea slashing royalties for creators, which was supposed to be the very thing that NFTs were here to fix. They were supposed to be putting earnings and power in the hands of creators, but then they started dropping royalties. So frame is enshrining royalties in the blockchain itself. So super interesting approach. Other NFT news is that Uvalabs has released a wrapper for cryptopunks.
00:20:41.202 - 00:21:51.470, Speaker A: So reminder that crypto punks were launched in 2017 before the ERC 721 standard was invented. So funnily enough, the kind of most successful, I guess, like stereotypical NFT collection, crypto punks is not an actual ethereum NFT. It's not an ERC 721 token. And that means that it can't be used as easily in DFI applications and it loses kind of this degree of composability. So Ugalabs have created a wrapper that gives it kind of ERC 721 characteristics. So that's really interesting for cryptopunks holders. Moving on to inscriptions, which has been such a hot topic recently, really all year, but in the past seven days, they've really reached just like boiling point.
00:21:51.470 - 00:22:49.182, Speaker A: They're taking over smart contract chains. They've accounted for more than 91% of transactions on avalanche, 75% on gnosis, 65% on Ethereum's curly testnet, 62% on Arbitrum, and so on. They've just been taking over blockchains all over the place, and they've even not just been taking over blockchain transactions, but they've been taking down blockchains. So inscription driven activity has driven outages on arbitram avalanche, Cksync era, kronos, and recently Celestia. So it's just crazy. Inscriptions are just breaking crypto. A bit of background inscriptions emerged as a coding method for NFT like tokens to be created on top of bitcoin.
00:22:49.182 - 00:23:28.826, Speaker A: So bitcoin does not have smart contracts abilities. And as a workaround, the ordinals team started inputting text on ethereum transactions. And it started with these kind of NfT like tokens. And then it led to something like ERC 20 tokens, like fungible tokens, which were called DRC 20 tokens. Now here's my hot take. I believe that inscriptions make no sense at all on smart contracts platforms. I think they're a fad.
00:23:28.826 - 00:23:48.946, Speaker A: I think everyone is trying to follow the success of ordinals on bitcoin. They're bound to die off. It just makes no sense for smart contracts platforms. So like I mentioned before, encryptions are using something called call data on blockchains.
00:23:49.058 - 00:23:51.382, Speaker B: Which is a piece of text that.
00:23:51.436 - 00:24:47.454, Speaker A: Is attached to or can be sent together with any transactions. And it's read only. It's very cheap to use, especially compared with smart contracts. So this is an advantage and it's a reason why people are maybe using them. And in these text fields, people need to be following a specific kind of standard for them to qualify as a fungible token. So you're following a standard to qualify as an NFT, as an ERC 20 token. And you're using this kind of cheap piece in blockchain transactions to inscribe a transaction and kind of transform that simple transaction into another kind of token, either an NFT or a fungible token, like an ERC 20 token.
00:24:47.454 - 00:25:55.258, Speaker A: But this was a workaround that bitcoin had to do because it doesn't have smart contracts capabilities. Blockchains like Ethereum, like Avalanche, like BNB, Celestia, like all these other arbitrum, all these networks that do have smart contracts capabilities that are being spammed with all this text that's being added on transactions as inscriptions. It just makes absolutely no sense and it's a step backwards. The reason why we have smart contracts is to provide this level of flexibility of expression to blockchains. And using these kind of text fields on transactions just doesn't make any sense. To interpret these call data transactions, you're needing to rely on external providers called indexers who read this data and process it so they're centralized. Companies like alchemy is an indexer.
00:25:55.258 - 00:27:04.478, Speaker A: And so as someone using inscriptions, yes, you have the upside of issuing NFTs in a much cheaper way. Another upside is that everything is in that piece of call data, including the metadata, including the actual NFT image itself, which is a plus. But you are relying on this off chain company, on indexers to process that. So you lose a degree of permissionlessness. You also lose the composability that comes from having smart contracts process these transactions, of having these standards inscribed in the smart contracts themselves, which gives ERCD 720 ones and ERC 20 tokens actual composability. And these tokens can then be used in DFI, can be used in web three. Dapps inscriptions can't be used anywhere because they lack this composability.
00:27:04.478 - 00:27:55.862, Speaker A: They rely on these external indexers to read this data. So to me it makes no sense. It's a step backwards. And worst of all, in my book, it's just people following a trend just for the sake of it, because you're seeing how successful it is on ordinals and you're trying to catch some of that success and copy it and replicate it on many of these other blockchains. Maybe I'll be proved wrong, but yeah, I totally see this fad dying off. So I'm short inscriptions on non bitcoin blockchains, but we shall see. What do you think? Are you pro or against inscriptions? Not that I'm against inscriptions, I think they're fun.
00:27:55.862 - 00:28:11.810, Speaker A: Whatever. It's good to see all this innovation. I just think it's a fat that will die off. But what do you think? Interested to hear? So leave a comment like subscribe, share and hopefully see you in the new year when we're back with crypto with Kami.
