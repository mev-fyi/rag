00:00:00.400 - 00:00:32.494, Speaker A: Has there been a change also in the bitcoin community? Like, in the. I don't know if you can, like, think of, like, a stereotypical bitcoin error or not even that. Just like maybe the majority of bitcoin holders were active in the community. Is it fair to say that they were less open to the idea of Defi on bitcoin before and now that's changed, and if that's the case, what do you think is driving that?
00:00:32.582 - 00:00:36.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm always cautious when talking about the bitcoin community and monolithic.
00:00:36.102 - 00:00:38.358, Speaker A: Yeah, of course, there's lots of different.
00:00:38.454 - 00:01:22.590, Speaker B: People in it, and I think when you think about crypto in general, maybe this is less the case now, but most people's first interaction with crypto is bitcoin, so we're all bitcoiners at a certain level. Right. However, there are kind of more extreme voices in this space. It is a highly culturally and even religiously. Yeah, it's a very intense culture. So I'm always cautious about talking about it in monolithic terms, because there's all sorts of subsets and different positions. I think the way I look at it, I kind of self identify, if you will, is as a bitcoin pragmatist.
00:01:22.590 - 00:02:28.580, Speaker B: For me, this is the. This is an entirely. Bitcoin represents an entirely new computing paradigm, something that we really haven't seen, we really hadn't seen in decades until bitcoin went live in 2008. To understand it or see it as simply a means of storing value and a means of exchange is to massively limit the possibilities for what you can do with the bitcoin blockchain. We have always seen it as an entirely novel form of computer that anybody can interact with. And the first bitcoin sidereal and launch of Rootstock was really just an example of how you can take the cryptographic power of bitcoin and bring it to bear for a completely different set of uses that bitcoin was never really originally designed for. To be very honest with you, I'm very.
00:02:28.580 - 00:02:52.430, Speaker B: I tend not to get too involved in the debates around what you should or shouldn't use bitcoin for what is or isn't a right use of block space. I'm pro experimentation. So long as nobody's getting hurt, it's all good. Right. And everybody's staying within the rails. Yeah. I think it is fair to say that up until.
00:02:52.430 - 00:03:23.324, Speaker B: Has there been a change? I don't know. I don't know. There's been a change. I think maybe the number of people building has grown and the experimentation space has expanded and maybe the example and the. Yeah, maybe those voices have just got louder and started to drown out. To a certain extent, the more. Yeah, the more sort of extreme, culturally dogmatic voices.
00:03:23.324 - 00:04:11.880, Speaker B: You know, there's a. You know, a lot of bitcoin culture and a lot of crypto culture in general, is people just talking about stuff and getting excited about the culture. I think I'm more interested in seeing what people are building and letting those who are creating things and using this technology for new and novel use cases or just everyday use cases. I'm more interested to see what they do because I think those are the ones that are going to build the future. I think those that are more interested in kind of conserving and protecting and anchored in a sort of romantic, almost religious view of the technological past. Yeah, history tends not to be on the side of those. I think history is a bit more favorable to people that try new things and try and experiment and build stuff that's for everyone.
