00:00:00.330 - 00:00:47.526, Speaker A: You perpetual markets were first brought to the crypto space by Bitmex in 2016. And if you're not aware of what a perpetual is, it's a swap product for traders to hold exposure indefinitely versus having to roll their futures positions. And it was BitMex who solved this problem with what's now popularly known as the perpetual swap, a bitcoin derivative contract that never expires in 2020. These petrol's markets on Bitmex and the likes of binance can each generate over a billion dollars in daily trade volume. And similarly, DeFi is now seeing the release of decentralized perpetual markets. Like most money, Lego's decentralized perpetual markets are a simple twist on legacy centralized markets. To trade on a decentralized perpetual, all you need is an ethereum wallet and the courage to deploy some capital.
00:00:47.526 - 00:01:20.902, Speaker A: There's no KYC, no sign up in the case of decentralized exchanges like Didx and McDEx that we'll discuss today. No centralized team to control your funds. The underlying mechanism that enables perpetual markets is the funding rate. With perpetual markets, either longs or shorts will pay the other side over a specified time window, often 8 hours. Hence an eight hour funding rate. And the amount paid is a reflection of both how much leverage each side is employing, as well as the difference between the index price and the price of the perpetual contract. Here's an example.
00:01:20.902 - 00:02:17.510, Speaker A: If BTC is $15,000 according to the index price fed by an oracle, and the DidX perpetual market for BTC USD is 15,005, the funding rate would then have those in a long position playing those in a short position to incentivize more to short the market and bring the perpetuals price down to $15,000 for a BTC. Now another thing that makes crypto markets so appealing to traders is volatility. In traditional forex markets, traders might see less than 1% movement on average over many months. So the key to them making a living is using larger positions. Making a small percentage gain on a larger position means more profit. A larger position or amount of money, means using leverage. So despite the already volatile nature of crypto markets, yet another advantage to decentralized perpetuals is that one can trade a larger position using leverage and potentially earn larger profits, or lose money, more money if the market moves against them.
00:02:17.510 - 00:03:05.362, Speaker A: Never forget that. Now, the final advantage of decentralized perpetuals are that one can gain exposure to more of a cryptocurrency by simply using that cryptocurrency rather than fiat. Decentralized perpetual markets allow traders to speculate on the price of tokens like BTC or ETH or link, and to hedge their holdings using those same tokens as collateral instead of fiat. To make more ETH, one can simply deposit ETH as collateral and trade ten x the value of it on decentralized, perpetual markets like Didx and McDEx in countries like the US, which recognize selling any cryptocurrency as a taxable event. This even allows traders to gain exposure without incurring a taxable event. You've been watching DFI 101.
