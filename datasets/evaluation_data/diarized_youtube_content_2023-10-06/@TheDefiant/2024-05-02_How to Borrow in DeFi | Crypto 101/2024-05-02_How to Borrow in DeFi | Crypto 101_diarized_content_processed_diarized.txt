00:00:27.510 - 00:01:14.068, Speaker A: In traditional finance, when you borrow money, you usually need to provide collateral to secure the loan. But in the world of defi, things work a little differently. Over collateralized borrowing, as the name suggests, means you can borrow funds by depositing crypto assets as collateral, normally at a higher value than the loan itself. We call this an over collateralized loan, or a CDP, which stands for a collateralized debt position. It's like getting a loan from a friend, but instead of giving them your car keys as collateral, you give them something of much greater value, like your house. Now let's explore the advantages of Defi borrowing. Picture this instant loans at your fingertips without the hassle of signing up or going through tedious KYC procedures.
