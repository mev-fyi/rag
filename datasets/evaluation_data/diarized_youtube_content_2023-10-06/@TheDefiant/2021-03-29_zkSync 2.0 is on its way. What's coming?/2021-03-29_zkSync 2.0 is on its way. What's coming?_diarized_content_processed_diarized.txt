00:00:00.250 - 00:00:46.230, Speaker A: Brickish hour welcome back to another Monday with another quick take. And if you had a fun weekend brainstorming solutions to unclog the Suez Canal and set Evergreen free, you're gonna love the solutions we're covering with this video. But first, let's start with the countdown from two to zero. Let's check out a very interesting project called Oasis. Oasis is the leading privacy enabled layer one blockchain for DeFi, and it was founded by Dawn Song, the award winning professor from Berkeley, and has many key backers such as Andreessen Horowitz, Excel Finance Labs and more. Oasis already has several projects building on its network and partners such as the Cryptosafe alliance with Binance, Chainlink, Balancer meter and many others. If you're interested in building a DFI app, join the Oasis hackathon until April 16.
00:00:46.230 - 00:01:24.210, Speaker A: They've recently launched a new smart contract environment with full EVM and solidity, tool chain support and gas fees that are check it 99% lower than Ethereum. If you have a bigger project in mind, Oasis also runs a large grant program with the 1.5 million USD in rose tokens available for funding DFi apps. Visit their website@oasisproteocol.org to learn more. Wait, another sponsor? Damn right we have one more. ADN comprises a twelve week program giving DFI projects hands on support across product design, tokenomics, liquidity, bootstrapping, governance, community building and fundraising.
00:01:24.210 - 00:02:02.158, Speaker A: Apply and find out more at Asiadefi network and now it's time for zero. Yes, as in zero knowledge sync. Yes, 2.0 is on its way. So what's coming with 20 zinc VM will be capable of porting the existing source code in Yule, making it compatible with solidity. Now, other programming languages, such as native Rust, will also be supported by Zync VM in the future as well. With the mainstream adoption of NFTs knocking on the door, the Zksync team has acknowledged the difficulties of onboarding the potentially millions of creators that roll ups alone can't handle.
00:02:02.158 - 00:02:41.630, Speaker A: Now, ZK Sync 20 will introduce a new holistic architecture that offers a mix of ZK rollup and zk Porter accounts, bringing ultra security together with minuscule transaction costs capable of 20,000 plus transactions per second. More info on this to come soon. So it all boils down to one question. Web well, the timeline looks like this public testnet is set for May 2021 and the main net is targeted for August later this year. Now, Zksync is widely expected to be one of the single most important projects for Ethereum. We just hope it won't end up being evergreen 20. That's it for today.
