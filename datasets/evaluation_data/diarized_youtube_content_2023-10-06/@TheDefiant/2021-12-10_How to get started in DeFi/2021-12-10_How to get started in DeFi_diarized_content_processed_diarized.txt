00:00:09.530 - 00:00:42.798, Speaker A: We may not have a sense, but we gonna make it. I know we will. We may have to eat beans every day, but we gonna make it. Welcome. This is the defiance beginner's guide to Defi. And looking at the chat, I have to say welcome to all our turkish fans out there. Hello to you al Gazimov.
00:00:42.798 - 00:00:47.926, Speaker A: Would you tell me how to say hello to you turkish fans in Turkish?
00:00:48.038 - 00:00:50.022, Speaker B: Sedam lad. Hoshkazenis.
00:00:50.166 - 00:00:53.470, Speaker A: There you go. Did you hear that? You should put yourself on camera.
00:00:56.050 - 00:00:59.950, Speaker B: The important part is that you say it as well. Can you try to say it as well?
00:01:00.100 - 00:01:00.878, Speaker A: Say it again.
00:01:00.964 - 00:01:05.582, Speaker B: Sedam Hoshka. One more time.
00:01:05.716 - 00:01:18.522, Speaker A: Selam Horshkaran. I can't do, but it's fantastic to see all these turkish visitors to the channel as well. Today we're talking about how to get started in Defi Alp. Hit the slides.
00:01:18.686 - 00:01:19.720, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:01:21.050 - 00:01:50.682, Speaker A: On the channel. There's a lot of things that we covered that are kind of advanced and probably a little bit confusing and disorientating for those who are just kind of taking their first steps into defi. So what we wanted to do today was just drill all the way back and just get into some really foundational material. So basically what we're going to be covering is firstly how to get grounded in Defi. Looking at what kind of defi user you are, thinking about principal protection. You start from a position of strength. You want to maintain that position of strength.
00:01:50.682 - 00:02:18.870, Speaker A: How do you go about that? DeFi is very good, in fact, at doing that. We're going to look at some common primitives that you'll encounter in DeFi. Then we're going to just get into it, getting started, setting up a wallet. We'll get into swapping, which is just the simplest, basic thing that you need to do to enable you to get from one place to another and get started. And then we're going to set up a very simple but very effective Defi position. All of that's coming up straight after this message from our sponsors.
00:02:31.650 - 00:03:04.070, Speaker C: Donate high gas costs keep you out of Ethereum at balancer. The gas optimized vault architecture makes trading cheaper than anywhere else. Liquidity providers can optimize their fee earnings using the dynamic fee system that automatically adjusts to market conditions. You can also use asset managers to lend out idle assets, dramatically increasing your capital efficiency. And because balancer is an open platform for flexible automated markets, you can choose from stable pools or weighted pools. And in the future more designs will be created that, well, they don't even know about yet. Check it out at balancer Phi.

Well, that's been trending a lot in the DFI space, lady, but what is it? Well, Oasis is the leading privacy enabled layer one blockchain network, ideal for DFI due to its instant finality, 99% lower gas fees, high throughput and privacy protection. Founded by Dawn Song, A. Barclay professor and one of the world's foremost experts in computer security and artificial intelligence, Oasis is among the top two invested blockchains with one of the fastest growing developer networks in the industry.
00:03:59.206 - 00:04:35.540, Speaker C: Oasis has an established partner ecosystem with companies like band, Chainlink, Genetica, Nebula, BMW Finance and more. Recently, the team announced a substantial $160,000,000 Oasis ecosystem fund, supported by top industry backers such as Dragonfly Capital, Electric, Capital, Jump Capital, Pantera and more. The fund is dedicated to help projects build on Oasis. If you want to receive funding, visit oasisprotectocol.org and apply today. Last but not least, Yuzu Swap, the first Dex built on Oasis will launch soon and there's already an airdrop running. Check it out today@yuzuswap.com.
00:04:38.710 - 00:05:00.890, Speaker A: So welcome to everybody on the stream. Thanks for joining in. And if you're not subscribed already, I mean, basically we have a clock behind us that tells us where we're at in our subscriber journey towards 100,000 subscribers. 92.4 thousand. For some reason, 100,000 is like this big deal and you get this kind of YouTuber plaque Alp, are you worried about us getting plaque?
00:05:02.770 - 00:05:04.174, Speaker B: Both yes and no.
00:05:04.292 - 00:05:06.030, Speaker A: He forgets to switch to himself.
00:05:06.450 - 00:05:09.502, Speaker B: Yeah, that's me. Yeah, I'm out.
00:05:09.556 - 00:05:11.150, Speaker A: It actually says on your hoodie.
00:05:12.290 - 00:05:27.220, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, it'll be nice to have it in here because we started the year with five K subscribers and we're closing up to 92 93. It would be just nice to have it on the background, just decorate the set, just have it there. What do you think?
00:05:28.310 - 00:05:41.206, Speaker A: Yeah, let's get on with the show. Getting grounded in DFI, hit the slides out. Nobody cares about the YouTube play button, because you know what YouTube is web two. We are web three true. We don't get on. It's a swag. It's a swag.
00:05:41.206 - 00:06:04.250, Speaker A: So I'd like to say hello to Carlos Ramirez, to William Craig, to Paul Searle, to Halil, to Tod Starbuck. Nerf. Nerf yourself, you crazy, crazy mofo. Getting grounded in Defi, that's what today is all about. It's about basic foundational stuff. Because I'm really mindful of the fact that high level Defi stuff can feel a. Like a circle jerk.
00:06:04.250 - 00:06:28.380, Speaker A: Like it's just for a bunch of really smart people that really understand the granular, fine details of stuff, but it can also feel like it's completely out of reach. Like it's just not for you. But I'm hoping that with this series of films that will show that it's a journey and you can get there. Because ALP and myself, we both got there. We're not finance people. We actually kind of got there with Defi. So let's just dig into it.
00:06:28.380 - 00:06:58.414, Speaker A: On the left at the top here, we have a standard Defi YouTuber. He's holding his chin because he knows what's what. He doesn't know what's. Yeah, his PNG game is off. But what you'll be confronted with in Defi is this farming, lping, impermanent loss. Dexes here on the I've kind of picked out all the different flavors of curve token you can find on uniswap. And this is just five, six flavors of this curve token.
00:06:58.414 - 00:07:31.782, Speaker A: All of them are meaningful, all of them have a meaning. But to you, we're like, why is this any different from curve as we know it? And then here is just a real kind of quick overview of everything that's defi related on Ethereum. And Ethereum, of course, is not the only blockchain. There are tons of blockchains out there and they're all building defi. To wrap your head around Defi, you've got to wrap your head around all of this on every chain at the same time. And that can feel completely overwhelming. But the point of this presentation is to show you that actually you don't need to be overwhelmed.
00:07:31.782 - 00:08:11.162, Speaker A: All of this basically feeds into a set of guidelines, a set of rules, a set of principles that are universal across any blockchain anywhere. And they don't require you to be a finance big head, galaxy brain, any of that stuff. So hopefully by the end of this presentation, we will get you there. And the goal from here, where we are now, is to just do one thing, cement a few basic ideas and then get you to a position where you can go. I understand why I would take one position that I have and use Defi to make it slightly better. That's it. That's as far as we will go today.
00:08:11.162 - 00:08:17.766, Speaker A: But there's a lot of ground to cover along the way. Good vibes. Alpine, is that you, Alp?
00:08:17.958 - 00:08:18.700, Speaker B: No.
00:08:20.050 - 00:08:23.760, Speaker A: Someone is pretending to be you. You've got a doppelganger already.
00:08:25.570 - 00:08:26.334, Speaker B: That's amazing.
00:08:26.452 - 00:08:53.638, Speaker A: ALP will be representing June in the defiance calendar for next year. Can't wait for that. Speedos. Oh, yeah. Let's move on. So, listen, crypto games, what do I mean by that? So when you come to crypto, pretty much everybody who's on this channel, everybody who comes to this space, will be thinking, my life is a little bit terrible financially. And crypto potentially could offer me a way to make it slightly better.
00:08:53.638 - 00:09:28.274, Speaker A: And as you go into crypto, you realize that it could make your life substantially better financially, at least on paper, anyway. And so we get into this habit of kind of thinking of these crypto endeavors that we go into as games. It's a bit like going to the casino and I split them into scarce crypto games and defi games. Scarce crypto is basically just bitcoin. It's Ethereum. It's any altcoin that is naturally scarce Defi doesn't really fit into that. This term scarce crypto came up when I was looking at Ichi and their branded dollars.
00:09:28.274 - 00:09:59.942, Speaker A: It's actually a really nice way of describing just all of stuff that isn't defi. So in scarce crypto, we love to think of number go up, but number also goes down. And we also think of each unit of what I have increases in value. So you think a bitcoin, you have one of them, it goes up in value, therefore I win. Same one ethereum, one ETH token goes up in value, therefore I win. Stablecoins. In that paradigm, in that mentality, there are defensive posture.
00:09:59.942 - 00:10:45.610, Speaker A: You tether something. If you're worried about the market, it feels like a step backwards because it's saying, oh, I don't believe in crypto anymore, just momentarily. And so I'm going to step back into stablecoins. In scarce crypto games, you are a trader. You look at charts, you follow traders, you start to understand different momentum indicators, and you draw lines, because that's the way you view the world. And of course, you are very mindful of the stop loss, because the stop loss is the way in which you provide some kind of safety net for your risk taking in the space, Defi doesn't do any of that. Defi is a number go up mentality.
00:10:45.610 - 00:11:11.954, Speaker A: Number don't go down. In DeFi, number go up, for a lot of different reasons, one of which is maybe we start from stablecoins. We just want more stablecoins. Number don't go down. Number go up. There are some other caveats to all of that, but fundamentally, in DeFi, each unit of what I have will create more units of what I already have. Scarce crypto, what I have, increases in value.
00:11:11.954 - 00:11:38.678, Speaker A: It's an inflation mechanism. In Defi, each unit spawns another unit of that. Thinking about that, that's a big mental shift. Stablecoins are an offensive primitive. In Defi, they're a weapon, not a defensive position, not a shield, they're a weapon. In defi, you're a farmer, not a trader. And in Defi, we think very carefully about principal protection.
00:11:38.678 - 00:12:02.978, Speaker A: And this basically looks like this. Two mindsets, both of them are valid. Scarce crypto is I want more. You are greedy. You're inherently greedy. And it's very common for people to get into crypto because they see outsized gains and they go, wow, I can be a hero with a tiny stack. It's an asymmetric play.
00:12:02.978 - 00:12:52.030, Speaker A: So you start with something small, and it becomes something big. What do you do when it has become something big? All of us, I suspect, over the last 18 months have had that moment of self reflection where we think, gosh, I've done well, but what am I going to do next? DFI is what you do next. DFI says, well, I already have a bunch of stuff, and I'm doing great, but I want it to do more for me. I'm very content, and I want to retain the value that I have, but I need it to work harder for me. And the problem that we have is that we've become so accustomed to being in debt to banks, offering us terrible interest rates that we don't believe that DeFi can be a thing. But it never used to be like that. Interest rates used to be actually quite decent, and you were able to earn passive income.
00:12:52.030 - 00:13:38.114, Speaker A: You were able to earn decent amounts for the hard work that you'd put in. You put it in the bank and it would work for you. That is no longer the case, and it's not worth us getting into why when we look at DeFi and when people say it's a scam, what they're saying is, this cannot be. The only reason we're saying this cannot be is because it is not in the world that we're accustomed to, but it used to be in the world we're accustomed to. It's just that it's not now. But DeFi is saying, well, why can't it be? And as we'll kind of move on through this process, you'll understand that DeFi and the people who build in DeFi inherently want to go to that place where they go. You have an assumption about what money should be.
00:13:38.114 - 00:14:11.562, Speaker A: We're going to challenge it, and they might be right, they might be wrong. But unless people are pushing those boundaries and trying to figure out what that actually could be, then how will we ever know what money can be? You take your smartphone, every two years, you get a new version of it. It's smarter, it's faster, has a better camera. Why should you not expect the same from your money? Money is also digital. Money is just basically technology. Why is money so resistant to innovation and to change. Big questions to answer.
00:14:11.562 - 00:14:46.422, Speaker A: DeFi is trying to answer them. I am not saying that Defi has all the answers, and I'm not saying that every innovation in DeFi is good. What I am saying, though, is that DeFi operates under the same relentless pursuit of innovation as everything else. And that's why it is worth having an eye on this space and thinking about this space. So crypto altcoins, they get you more. Defi allows what you have to work harder. Defi's obsession, very, very simple.
00:14:46.422 - 00:15:15.998, Speaker A: What is really good at supercharging idle capital? One of the most dangerous ideas in crypto is hodl. Bear with me. Hoddle is amazing. It's the reason why we are so resistant to the forces that are arranged against us politically, philosophically. Because Hoddle is like, yeah, you can't take my money off me. I'm diamond handed. Money never sleeps.
00:15:15.998 - 00:15:46.186, Speaker A: Money should never sleep. Defi's obsession is taking that hoddle mentality. You have a thing, you're not letting go of it, and it's saying, wow, it can work harder for you. That is the entire reson of DeFi, supercharging idle capital, giving it superpowers and allowing it to do more and more and more. But it is risky. So the three pillars of the DFI genius are this, tokens, composability, and p to p liquidity. Just think about those three things.
00:15:46.186 - 00:16:33.382, Speaker A: So, firstly, tokens, one of the biggest questions we always must ask of any protocol, of any altcoin, of any situation in which we find ourselves confronted with a token is, does it need a token? Simple. Question to us, does it need a token? Defi can't exist without tokens. And the tokens are not there to fluff the egos of the people that founded the protocol. They're not there to just generate wealth for the people that founded the protocol. They're there because DeFi couldn't exist without them. You need the ability to wrap value in something else that represents that value to be able to do something else with it. And that is one of the beautiful things about the ERC 20 token mechanism that has been replicated throughout different blockchains and in protocols.
00:16:33.382 - 00:17:00.098, Speaker A: It's just a beautiful thing. Represent a state as a slightly different state, and allow it to go and do something else. It's like you retraining from being an editor to being a director of photography. Tokens have that ability. Most of the money that we've ever had in our lives never had that ability at all. But in DeFi, they absolutely can. So you have the ability to represent value in different ways.
00:17:00.098 - 00:17:36.974, Speaker A: You can wrap and rewrap value. So bitcoin can be rewrapped as WBTC and it can go to work on the Ethereum network. The reason that might be interesting, because the bitcoin network doesn't really have any deFi. It's slowly getting there, but that's not really what bitcoin's for. But if you're a hodler of bitcoin and you see farms and you see interest rates that are interesting to you, and you want to go and play in that ecosystem, then you wrap your BTC and it can go and play on the Ethereum network. Easy. Also, tokens are super easy to transfer from one person to another.
00:17:36.974 - 00:17:57.990, Speaker A: There's no intermediary. It's not cheap on Ethereum, but it's cheaper on other networks. But at least it's easy. And there's no banker saying, I'm sorry, I've looked at your transaction and no, none of that. That's never going to happen. It's permissionless. The other thing that's amazing about DeFi is composability.
00:17:57.990 - 00:18:29.646, Speaker A: So imagine this. I have a loan that I've taken out on Wells Fargo. Wonderful stuff. It's a loan on Wells Fargo. The Wells Fargo Banking Institution has said, yes, you can have a loan, but I also have a mortgage with Abbey national in the UK. What have those two got to do with each other? I've had to go through the same processes to get those two things to happen. There is KYC involved, there is financial scrutiny involved, and yet the two have nothing to do with each other.
00:18:29.646 - 00:18:57.190, Speaker A: Defi doesn't do that. Defi says, well, you have a thing here and a thing here, and these two can talk to each other because they're the same token standard. So let's see what can happen. So your loan that you've taken out in Wells Fargo can be used as staking collateral in a completely different place over here. This is a big thing to wrap your head around. Wrapping your head around money. Legos in general, is just very, very difficult.
00:18:57.190 - 00:19:41.782, Speaker A: But if we bring it down to kind of concrete examples, compound, which is the money market, you could take a loan out on compound, but you could use the token you use to take that represents your loan, and then you can use it to buy a car, for instance, or take out a loan to buy a car. Because the value is, firstly, it's transparent, it's concrete, it's known, it's a known quantity, and therefore anything that touches the ethereum network can look at it and go, yeah, I know what this is. And it doesn't matter whether it was issued on compound or maker or other or anything else. What matters is the sanctity of the smart contract on which it is built. Now, that's a whole different discussion. But fundamentally, it's free to travel. It can go wherever it wants.
00:19:41.782 - 00:20:22.162, Speaker A: So you have to start thinking about your value as kind of like having a suitcase of cash in the back of your car, and you can just drive it wherever you want. No one's going to stop you. There are no borders. You just drive it. I want to go to Ava today. Drive it to Ava, and you do your business on Ava, and then you move along. Composability means that all of that is free, easy, and it allows anyone with the brain smart enough to figure out how one piece of avez offering and one piece of compounds offering, and if you added it to this one here on another protocol, all of those things together could be a really compelling thing.
00:20:22.162 - 00:20:50.326, Speaker A: Let's say you have a very specific use case, like funding a film. There might be a specific recipe of different things that all these different protocols offer. You could marry them together and make a really beautiful financial product. And it sounds like witchcraft, but it's not. It's just basic fintech financial engineering. The other thing that is just fantastic about DeFi is p to p liquidity. So this is crowdsourced liquidity.
00:20:50.326 - 00:21:20.370, Speaker A: And it's kind of a weird idea. But if you think about Kickstarter, the way we can just access investment in cash from people all over the world. We don't need to know who they are. If we have a compelling enough offering and we're good enough at pitching, they will commit money. The difference is that when I commit something to a Kickstarter campaign, I might get a t shirt if I'm lucky, or like a frame of a film, or like a product. Okay, great. With p to p liquidity.
00:21:20.370 - 00:21:50.602, Speaker A: Liquidity is such a fundamental piece of the defi infrastructure. Without liquidity, you can't do anything. But Defi says, yes, we recognize how essential this is. We'll pay you for it so you can be both a user and a key piece of the infrastructure. Incentivizing liquidity. Incentivizing crowdsourced liquidity to come and participate in an ecosystem that's a big deal. And those are the kind of three main pillars of why DeFi is so utterly genius.
00:21:50.602 - 00:22:46.562, Speaker A: We can both be a customer of the bank and own the bank at the same time. Think about that wild stuff. This means that DeFi is fertile ground for innovation. I've just kind of put together a very small list of projects that have really kind of been on our radar for the longest time now, just in terms of the things that they're doing that kind of make you go, what? So we have Olympus here. Olympus is building a decentralized reserve currency. They completely reconfigured the way we thought about liquidity itself and what liquidity means. They're possibly suffering a bit of a downturn now, but the Ohm currency itself, the idea of building a kind of digital version of the gold standard, really wild, really successful, and has been forked endlessly to the point where it's probably a little bit exhausted as an idea right now.
00:22:46.562 - 00:23:24.430, Speaker A: But it definitely made everyone think, well, maybe we can do liquidity in a different way. Alchemy mooted the idea of a self repaying loan. I think all of us in our heads have seen that studying puts you in debt. Everything wants to put you in debt, because debt makes banks money. And it's just become a kind of, particularly in the west, just a thing that we do. We just work really hard, and now we're in debt, and now we're repaying debt. And the moment we get out of debt, it's like, why did we bother with all of this? Alchemy said, well, we don't have to do that.
00:23:24.430 - 00:24:05.082, Speaker A: The money that we are borrowing can be a kind of IOU on the future earnings of the money we put in. So basically, the way they do it, they use yearn vaults and yearn is a yield aggregator. You deposit money in there, and alchemy says, I see the amount of money you put in. I know how much money that will earn over a course of how many years, two, three, four years. And it says, I'm good with giving you that money right now because I trust you in. So they give you the money in advance, and then the loan pays itself back. So you are not on the hook for anything other than the money you put in the first place.
00:24:05.082 - 00:24:28.866, Speaker A: And generally how that works is you put in, let's say 100,000, let's make it a bigger number. You put in a million die, and you'd be able to take out a loan of 500,000 die. And over the course of the term of the loan, that 500,000 die pays itself back. You don't lose your stake. That's still there. So you still have a million dollars at the end of the term. That's still yours to do something with.
00:24:28.866 - 00:24:50.502, Speaker A: You just locked it up, and you just said, I want to take out a loan of 50% on this. And you got that 50% for free. Anchor, this is on the terror network. 20%. Is that exciting? Probably not in the grand scheme of things, but it's fixed. Fixed rate of interest, 20%. 20%.
00:24:50.502 - 00:25:14.526, Speaker A: It's actually 19.51%. It's probably going to drift down towards 90%. But I ask you this, how does that stack up compared to what your bank is offering you? We'll come back to anchor. I love anchor. Also got sushi here. Sushi has just been way out there in front, just doing the most insanely innovative product design. Product and sushi.
00:25:14.526 - 00:25:38.486, Speaker A: However you might think about them at the moment, they've been responsible for some deeply innovative products. But sushi is like deep Defi. Deep Defi. But there's so much innovation going on. What I love about DeFi is there are problems that are thrown up by a lot of the things that happen in Defi. But there are a lot of Defi engineers that go, yeah, we can fix this. And they do.
00:25:38.486 - 00:26:28.278, Speaker A: And it's interesting watching Congress kind of grapple with Defi and try and lock it in time as this thing that is problematic, that is scammy, that's not decentralized. What they're looking at is just, well, I can see this, and I don't like it. Rather than engaging in conversation with the people that build stuff, who are the best placed people to build the solutions to the problems that they are bringing up, that dialogue is missing. They see a problem, and then they highlight the problem, and then they talk about the problem in public because they love to talk about problems. Defi engineers love to build solutions. And the thing about DeFi engineers, they do it so fucking fast. If you tell a Defi engineer you've got a weekend to solve this, they will solve it.
00:26:28.278 - 00:26:57.330, Speaker A: That hackathon mentality, it's what's one of the most incredibly inspiring things I've ever seen. This space is like, give me a problem, I will solve it right now for you if you give me a month, I won't give me two days. Done. That is so inspiring and so incredible. Not all of them are fantastic, but it's amazing to see what might be possible. And this is still money we're talking about here. This is a thing that traditionally you've just seen as being this really limited thing.
00:26:57.330 - 00:27:12.870, Speaker A: DeFi will completely rewire the way you think about money. And that is amazing. So let's look at this guy in the field. That lighting doesn't look real at all. This is a photograph. I'm not sure if that guy's even really there. Alp.
00:27:12.870 - 00:27:43.090, Speaker A: So awkward. What's in his pocket? Looks like a gun. He's got a gun. Who picked this image? I did. What kind of user are you? So there are customers and there are stakeholders in Defi. So a customer, like a customer at the bank, you turn up, you use a service, and then you bugger off and you're absolutely fine because you got a service that works, you're just passing through. Or you can be a stakeholder, which is kind of like being a shareholder in a bank.
00:27:43.090 - 00:28:01.238, Speaker A: Except here a stakeholder means providing liquidity. It means participating in governance. But there's actually no real difference. And here's why. Let's take, for example, compound. Compound is a money market. It does a bunch of other things as well, but it's essentially a money market.
00:28:01.238 - 00:28:21.990, Speaker A: You lend, you borrow, you pay a rate of interest, you earn a rate of interest. Very, very simple. If you're a customer, you need to borrow some money. If you borrow money, compound says, well, listen, hey, thanks for using the service. Here's the comp token. The comp token allows you to participate in governance. Hooray.
00:28:21.990 - 00:28:53.570, Speaker A: You're now a stakeholder because you have a say in the future of the platform. What bank does that? The bank might give you a pen, might give you a loaf of bread if you're a student. Doesn't give you the right to vote on the future direction of the compound platform or the bank platform itself. Doesn't do that. So you can be a stakeholder, so you can provide liquidity, you can earn the comp token. Hey, you got governance participation. There's no real difference being a user, being a stakeholder.
00:28:53.570 - 00:29:23.262, Speaker A: If you pick the right protocol, you're incentivized, no matter what you do, to be a participant, and that's an education process. You go, okay, wow, I'm getting this comp token. And then a vote comes up and you go, actually, you know what? I really care about this vote. I want to do something here, want to have my voice heard. I'll be the first to say that governance is a bit of a meme. Participation in governance is low, but the governance tokens themselves are valuable. And we are still at such an early stage, we don't know quite how valuable they will be.
00:29:23.262 - 00:30:10.830, Speaker A: But at the same time, it's free money and it's not money that you would ever get banking at a bank, you might get cash back on purchases to the tune of like $5 a month or something, but that's not bad. But hey, this is a lot more. So, as it says here, as a user, what do I need to do to receive comp? When you use compound to supply bar assets, it will automatically begin accruing comp automatically. Just get it. Comp is really incredible because comp basically kickstarted Defi summer last year it kickstarted liquidity mining, liquidity farming, whatever you want to call it. Comp is the Og of Lp tokens. So there's Eddie Murphy.
00:30:10.830 - 00:30:50.326, Speaker A: If you haven't seen Raw his 1987 stand up show, you must, if only just to see Eddie Murphy in a purple leather suit. But also, this is Eddie Murphy Peak. But what have you done for me lately? It's a fair question to ask of D five protocols. What have you done for me lately? Because, hey, you know what, you have the power. You, with your $10 or ten USDC, you actually have some power. It's incredible. So I've picked out a kind of list of, this is hysterical, 7108% APY.
00:30:50.326 - 00:32:02.514, Speaker A: But down the bottom there, look above a billion percent APY on the Krill USDC pair. I believe Krill was on polygon, but yeah, I mean, come on, a billion percent, what is that all about? Basically these are liquidity incentives protocols need you, they need your cash, they need you to stick around and provide liquidity to make themselves. Well, there's this whole metric, which is TVL total value locked. And to the rest of the market, the amount of TVL, the total value locked kind of says, hey, people are confident in us, they're putting their money in our smart contracts, so they believe in us. And that sends a signal to the market and it says, hey, we're legit, we're the real deal. And like going over a billion dollars in TVL sends a big signal to the market and then everyone piles in, the rewards go up and then the rug gets pulled and bang, it all goes away fast. But this is basically highlighting the fact that protocols need liquidity and they need you because they can't put it together themselves.
00:32:02.514 - 00:32:39.342, Speaker A: A centralized exchange does deals with companies with protocols, and it says, okay, you want to list on our exchange, give us some tokens, and then all of those tokens start to become this liquidity pool. But decentralized exchange essentially has to acquire the liquidity itself. And that's why it does a deal when you want to exchange, when you want to list on the exchange there with decentralized exchange. That's not how it happens. All the liquidity comes from us, from us. And the most successful protocols have an enormous amount of liquidity. But it's been provided by those who see this system as a way to earn money and professionalize the whole thing.
00:32:39.342 - 00:33:05.846, Speaker A: But it doesn't have to be professional. We can all jump in and be part of it if we want to. The question is, is it profitable enough for us to do so? Now let's look at Apr versus apy. Can you tell the difference in the chat? Go? Who can tell me? It's on screen. So APY is annual percentage yield. This is the effective rate of return on an investment. And all it's saying is compounding that interest, you'll get x.
00:33:05.846 - 00:33:36.450, Speaker A: So compounding is the big deal in all of this. And the formula here is the rate of return and the number of times that the compounding will happen. That's the N factor there. And that gives you the formula that will give you your APY. And then APR is simply the annual percentage of return. This is the yearly interest generated by sums, what you tend to see on your credit card statements and how much interest you're going to pay on those. So Apy is compounding, APR is not.
00:33:36.450 - 00:33:56.680, Speaker A: And what we tend to see, as you can see here in defi farms and everything else, is APY. This is assuming that you stay in a farm for a year. Will you stay in a farm for a year? Al Gasmov, will you stay in a farm for a year?
00:33:57.770 - 00:33:59.966, Speaker B: It really depends on the risk factor.
00:34:00.018 - 00:34:31.506, Speaker A: His answer is actually no, he won't I don't think anybody stays in a farm for a year. It's insane. We'll come back to that. But API is just really, when it says 7108%, it's really not because nobody stays in for a year. Compounding maybe yes, but even then the rates are so much in flux and very it's a meme. It's a meme. This is an albgasimo slide compound interest is the ad wander of the world.
00:34:31.506 - 00:34:50.250, Speaker A: He who understands it ends it. He who doesn't ties it. Albert Einstein Bra Someone says I've stayed in a farm for two years and have me disappointed. Dearaj more tell us more in the comments.
00:34:50.670 - 00:34:51.766, Speaker B: Which farm?
00:34:51.878 - 00:35:10.270, Speaker A: Two years? It's got to be a blue chip. It's got to be something safe. There's no way like 99.9% of farms are so sketchy with so much impermanent loss. Like hell no. Hell no. So listen, let's look at different time horizons because we're talking about not spending a year.
00:35:10.270 - 00:36:13.614, Speaker A: So there are short, medium and long term time horizons in Defi and they all kind of do different things. I think if you're a bitcoin hodler, you're probably like looking at four year at least time horizon that would be considered a long term time horizon in Defi. Short is definitely farming, chasing APYs, because there's no doubt that if you are very active and very on it, you can leverage the fact that there are five figure, six figure APYs in farms. But you really don't want to be sticking around for very long because you'll get your ass kicked and you'll get the rug pulled and you'll be left holding a bunch of garbage that you cannot sell because it's amazing how quickly the hordes of locusts move on. If you're into medium term, then you're looking at things like bonds. So if you are looking to invest in the Olympus ecosystem, you can bond LP tokens, you can bond stablecoins like Dai or Frax, and they'll give you a bond. And a bond is basically buying ohm at a discount.
00:36:13.614 - 00:36:41.486, Speaker A: The discount takes seven days to mature. So that's what I would consider a medium term defi. Time horizon tranches. Barnbridge, for instance, there are junior and senior tranches. The junior tranches get a much higher risk, but also a higher return. But the senior ones get a fixed interest and they have terms on them and options as well, obviously have a time decay on them. So there's a certain amount of time that you can have the option for.
00:36:41.486 - 00:37:26.618, Speaker A: And then they expire, and then long term, really, you're looking at stablecoin lending. I don't think there's any real sense in looking at DFI in terms of really volatile tokens for a long term strategy. If I think about long term, I'm thinking about anchor protocol 20% or something, where there's a definite fixed rate of interest that I can rely on that I know is reasonably stable. But beyond that, I don't think there's a huge amount that I want to be interested in. But you might be staking something like polkadot, which, or cardano. The staking returns are pretty good on those. But again, the underlying asset is so volatile, I don't know.
00:37:26.618 - 00:38:09.500, Speaker A: It's stablecoins, long term, stable coins, but not financial advice. So I want to talk about the principal protection mindset. For me, Defi starts from a place of principal protection. I think crypto starts from a place of, well, I'm in the casino, let's gamble. I think Defi is much better at starting from, well, I have a bunch, and I don't really want to lose it. And the reason I say that is because stablecoins make up such a big part of the exciting kind of mechanics around Defi, because they give you a place where you can go stablecoins. Retreating into stable doesn't have to be a defensive position.
00:38:09.500 - 00:38:54.230, Speaker A: It's mildly offensive, but it's not aggressively offensive, but it can still be moving the needle forward. Like we used to say, tethering. Tethering was like, oh, shit, the market's dumping tether. Now we can say, well, I can move into this, and I can continue earning, and then you can say, I can take advantage of maybe a month's worth of just lending stablecoins and take out 8%. And that can just give me a little bit of a cushion to continue kind of exploring and investing and seeing what's possible in this space. So we got a bunch of different stablecoins here. We've got USDC and dai and Gemini coin G, USD, tether, or Paxos.
00:38:54.230 - 00:39:47.094, Speaker A: A sensible defi strategy should never result in a loss. And the reason I say that is because there are so many different ways to protect your principal now, thanks to DeFi, that you don't ever need to be at a loss, even if you're being a liquidity provider, which has traditionally been an extremely risky strategy. The likes of Bancorp, for instance, will give you a way to protect your principal. So if you do your homework, there are different flavors of being active in the defi space. That basically mean you don't need to lose money. And if you don't need to lose money, then why should you be afraid of any of it? Like a lot of crypto is like, and I lost money. Defi doesn't have to be like that.
00:39:47.094 - 00:40:18.718, Speaker A: Of course, you can gamble in Defi, and you can invest in terrible farms and whatever you want, but if you don't want to do that, Defi offers you a way to not do that. So we look at things like fixed interest. We look at principal protection, looking at anchor. If you invest stablecoins, you will come out with the same stable coins you put in, unless there's a horrible smart contract problem. Those do happen, by the way. But generally, generally, if you pick the right project, you should be fine. Alchemyx is a loan that pays itself, so there's no risk of liquidation.
00:40:18.718 - 00:40:41.020, Speaker A: Barnbridge, we talked about, they have tranches. Bancor offers principal protection on liquidity provider positions. So there's an option for all of these things. And like I said, defi engineers see a problem, which is people get liquidated, bad. Solve that. How do we avoid them getting liquidated? Well, the answer is nexus protocol on anchor. Fantastic stuff.
00:40:41.020 - 00:40:59.214, Speaker A: So let's look at some common premises. What are the things that you're going to encounter in defi? Again, it's a very simple list. Let's go through stablecoins. A stablecoin is a token whose value is designed to be stable. So far, so good. When you come into crypto, you think, my token should increase in value. Therefore, a stable coin is not for me.
00:40:59.214 - 00:41:32.806, Speaker A: As you get further into this adventure, you'll understand that a stable coin is, in fact, a very necessary, a very welcome thing. So these can be asset backed, so backed by fiat. So one USDT, it supposedly equals $1, do they? Nobody really knows. One USDC supposedly equals $1. It does now. Didn't necessarily a few months ago, but now they've kind of upped their games. The assets backing USDC are predominantly US dollars, or it can be algorithmic.
00:41:32.806 - 00:42:22.938, Speaker A: So it holds its peg according to a set of rules that determine, for instance, the supply. So, for instance, if a token is dipping below the value it should be, then you can sell the tokens, you can burn the tokens and bring the supply back to a level where it brings its value back in line with $1. And similarly, if you get too high above $1, then you can mint more and bring the value back down. We have wrapped tokens, so this is a token that is given a new jacket, essentially, and allows it to perform different functions. This happens a lot in DFI. We take one token, we wrap it in a different wrapper, and it allows it to go and perform as basically perform the same functions, but then take on superpowers. It can be a representative of a liquidity position.
00:42:22.938 - 00:43:01.810, Speaker A: It can also represent your position in a protocol. So for instance, with compound, when you invest in compound, you take out a position, you get given C tokens. So the C tokens represent your stake in that particular protocol. Same with Ava. Ava gives you interest bearing tokens, which are represented as a tokens. These are just wrapped versions of the same tokens, and they can be unwrapped to unlock the collateral that's stuck in the middle. But when you unwrap them, you also get the interest that was due on that token as well, so that the underlying token gains the superpower of yield.
00:43:01.810 - 00:43:47.986, Speaker A: If that makes sense, you can also wrap tokens to move them between different chains. We talked about bitcoin and wrapped bitcoin. So bitcoin can be wrapped to be WBTC, and once it's WBTC, it can be used as a primitive on the ethereum network. And interestingly enough, Ethereum is not an, the ETH token is not an ERC 20 token, which means that it's quite difficult to make it do things like for instance, bid on an NFT on openc, or kind of interact with other ERC 20 tokens in smart contracts. So there's a wrapped ETH. It makes no sense at all to those outside this ecosystem. But wrapped ETH is basically the version of ETH that allows it to interact more easily with smart contracts.
00:43:47.986 - 00:44:29.810, Speaker A: And that's why you might encounter wrapped ETH. But it's essentially it's ETH, but it's just wrapped. Then you have LP tokens. LP tokens are tokenized expressions of you providing liquidity in a protocol. And normally, though it's not necessarily the case now, but normally in the past when we were providing liquidity, we had to do it in pairs. So for instance, if you were providing liquidity to a USDC ETH pair, you had to provide equal amounts of USDC and equal amounts of ETH. You had then issued a token, an LP token that represented your share of the pool that is serving the entire USDC ETH pool.
00:44:29.810 - 00:45:16.066, Speaker A: Which is very complicated, because when you saw that token turn up, it was like, how is this any? I put 400 USDC in and I put 0.5 ETH in and now it's saying, I've got what? That's basically what that is. It's an LP token and it's designed to represent your share. That brings us on to NFTs now, because in uniswap version three, because they're using concentrated liquidity and they're using a much more sophisticated liquidity mechanism, each individual liquidity position is completely unique, so they have to be represented as NFTs instead. And you can actually go and buy these NFTs on OpenSea. That why anyone would is beyond me. But now we can see NFTs used in that way.
00:45:16.066 - 00:45:52.190, Speaker A: But NFTs can also represent vaults on the likes of visor. And these are simply permissioned instances of value that allow you to interact with protocols without ever putting your actual assets at risk. All you're doing is permissioning the boundary layer, which is this NFT between you and a protocol, and it's very much more capital efficient. That is high level, advanced stuff. And not for now, but you might see NFTs when it comes to uniswap, and that is exciting. Moshe J. Herap is asking, can you talk about potential risk with non FDIC products? Yes, I can.
00:45:52.190 - 00:46:33.210, Speaker A: I very much can. Yeah. The FDIC insures banks. The fDIc does not insure defi. It's pretty much it. We looked at this in a previous episode on the defiant when we're talking about DeFi, which was trying to understand whether there was an ability of DeFi to replicate the financially independent retire early movement. And basically in fire, people are looking to maximize passive income and reduce their overall kind of weekly or monthly household spend to the point where they could retire early.
00:46:33.210 - 00:47:00.962, Speaker A: And people are kind of trying to do this between 30 and 40 and say, my life is my life. I don't want to work anymore. And I believe that I can leverage the financial system to pay for my kind of lifestyle. And it depends where you live in the world. But we looked at this and a lot of the interest rates that are supplied by banks are terrible. But banks are FDIC insured. Defi is not.
00:47:00.962 - 00:47:33.120, Speaker A: That's it. Not yet, anyway. And we've been looking at regulations this week and Congress and all these different mechanisms by which Congress is looking to regulate DeFi. I am sure some form of FDIC insurance will come for somebody at some point. And if I would look at anyone. Yeah, USDC Coinbase, I guess those guys are ranking for it. Anyone that's based in New York right now is looking to get that in some degree or other.
00:47:33.120 - 00:47:59.894, Speaker A: Yeah, tricky. So hey, let's get going. Setting up a wallet now. I imagine most people in the stream have already done this, but hey, we're going to do it anyway, because why not? This is the very most basic, basic thing, and here's why. So listen, on the right here, we got Coinbase, we've got Binance, we've got Gemini, got the binance earn. Damn. Sounds good, right? Binance is amazing.
00:47:59.894 - 00:48:15.210, Speaker A: They've got an amazing suite of financial products. They can do anything. They are just everywhere. They understand this. They were an investor in harmony. They know what they're doing. This is a centralized exchange.
00:48:15.210 - 00:48:34.738, Speaker A: It's a non custodial, centralized exchange, therefore, not defi. Coinbase, not defi. Gemini, not defi. So if you are interested in defi, you've got to take the d bit seriously. Decentralized. None of those things on the right, as exciting and sexy as they are, crypto.com, I should have included in there as well.
00:48:34.738 - 00:49:01.094, Speaker A: Not defi. Not defi. Defi is decentralized. It's non custodial. I've now confused things by putting Coinbase wallet on the left here. And I could have put trust wallet in there as well, which is Binance's decentralized wallet. But Coinbase wallet is the decentralized version of the Coinbase wallet and allows you to interact with D five protocols and with anything in web three via the Coinbase wallet.
00:49:01.094 - 00:49:26.338, Speaker A: And very nice it is, too. We have metamask here. We have Portius, we have fortmatic. These are the four main noncustodial wallet providers that you will encounter in crypto. They're all good in their own way. I don't really have a preference for any of them, but the one that I use is metamask because that's what I've been using for God knows how long. And I understand it and it understands me.
00:49:26.338 - 00:49:50.860, Speaker A: And I like the way the fox looks up when the mouse goes over it. Sue me. So this is the most important thing. These are non custodial. So when we talk about Defi, you own your keys, you own your crypto, you don't send it to an exchange in order to do business. You are just where you are. And like I said, know you have your money in the back of your car, you drive to where you want to go and you make shit happen.
00:49:50.860 - 00:50:17.946, Speaker A: This is what it looks like. If you want to connect to uniswap, metamask, wallet connect, Coinbase wallet, fortmatic and portis. What is wallet Connect? Wallet Connect is a protocol that allows you to connect a bunch of other wallet providers, like trustwallet, through an app on your phone. And very nice it is, too. So there's plenty of options there on Uniswap. We'll come back to uniswap in a little bit. Question of security in Metamask, ask B.
00:50:17.946 - 00:50:49.094, Speaker A: You can have multiple accounts. If you connect account number three, for example, to a possible malicious site, do you lose your funds in all accounts, or just account three? Good question. So you can have your wallet infected and compromised. But there are two levels to this. Metamask is protected by a password. If you, for instance, give away the password to your metamask account, then every single account that you have connected to your metamask is compromised. If you lose the private keys to a wallet, only that account is compromised.
00:50:49.094 - 00:51:25.686, Speaker A: I actually did this as a live fire exercise about a year ago when I allowed, I basically gave up my private keys to a wallet that I earned, but I actually gave up my metamask password and people just went in and ransacked everything that I had. And it was not very nice. It was not very nice. But yes, that's the difference. And we'll come back to that in a second when we look at how you set up a wallet. So here are some other wallets as well. We've got terra station on Terra, deedless wallet on Cardano, Phantom on Salana, the Maya wallet on Elrond, and the avalanche wallet on El.
00:51:25.686 - 00:52:07.038, Speaker A: Basically, the setup process is exactly the same for all of them, and it looks like this. There are other ways of connecting, but a browser extension is extremely convenient, and it's pretty much the way that most people now interact with web three protocols. It's very straightforward and simply, you go on a website, it will ask you to connect your wallet. You will then sign to say, yes, I'm okay with you accessing my wallet, but of course, the protocol itself can't do anything with your wallet. All it's saying is you and I can have a conversation, and that's it. And it's like you're allowing me to have a conversation. Please cover how to change networks to mechamars.
00:52:07.038 - 00:52:32.682, Speaker A: I will do exactly that. I will do that. Dear edge, so here's how. Basically, setting up a wallet will work as a browser extension. I'm not going to get into having nodes and all this kind of thing, because it's beyond the pale of what we're doing here, but essentially the first thing you need to do is go and check the official website for the official browser extension. Solana for instance has an official website. Metamask has an official website.
00:52:32.682 - 00:53:03.960, Speaker A: We'll look at that in just a second. Follow the instructions of setting up a new wallet. You can see here we have no, I already have a secret recovery phrase. So you could import an existing wallet. If you're trying to recover one, or you set up a new one, then write down your seed phrase. Generally, what I think is good hygiene for this is physically write down your seed phrase. You could cut it in half and put one half in one place and one half another, but I think having two separate copies in two different places is probably enough.
00:53:03.960 - 00:53:34.722, Speaker A: But you can go further than that. You can chisel them into titanium disks if you want to. The next thing you're going to do is set a password for your browser extension. That password is basically a quick access route for you to open up your wallet. But that password won't allow anybody else to restore your wallet if you lose it. Only the seed phrase can. So that part phrase is basically like the key to your house.
00:53:34.722 - 00:54:01.710, Speaker A: Essentially. Okay, so having looked at that, we're going to now, I believe, go and have a look at the demo. Yeah. So I need to open up Firefox now. So here's the metamask website for Firefox. You can scroll down all the way to the bottom and go to the. There we go to the download.
00:54:01.710 - 00:54:24.014, Speaker A: So on the download, it'll tell you what supported browsers are for metamask. So you got chrome, you got Firefox, you got brave, and you got edge. Normally I use brave because chrome sucks. Edge sucks. Firefox, I think, will be fine. The reason I'm using Firefox is because all my other metamask is already set up on brave already. So it's very simple.
00:54:24.014 - 00:54:38.706, Speaker A: We're just going to install metamask for Firefox. It opens this up. Nothing to be worried about here. This is all legit. I checked it out earlier. Then we're going to do add to Firefox and we're going to go, yes, we want to add that. Then we get this little browser extension up here.
00:54:38.706 - 00:55:03.066, Speaker A: Click on that, and now we're good to go. So we can get started. No, I already have a secret recovery phase. No, we want to create a brand new wallet. We're going to agree to this, and now we're going to set a password. So I'm going to call it tutorial. And don't worry, I'm never, ever going to use this wallet.
00:55:03.066 - 00:55:28.670, Speaker A: So I don't care that you know what my password is. Don't save, go on to next. And now we can click to reveal this passphrase. So this passphrase that I've now revealed to you, don't worry, I'm never going to use this wallet. This is the most important thing here. Write this down. Memorize it if you have to, but make sure you know how to recover it if you need to.
00:55:28.670 - 00:56:08.046, Speaker A: Everybody has a different way of doing this, but this right here, if you have a lot of value locked up in your metamask and you lose this, you're basically screwed. It's game over. So make sure you know exactly where. Basically, map it out. What is the worst thing that can happen and how would I be set and what steps would I go through if I were to lose access to my account? Because it does happen. Now, as much as we like to think that we are smart and we know what we're doing, we all take risks. And it happens a lot with NFT sales actually at the moment, that are just spoof websites, people are moving fast, too fast, and they make a mistake.
00:56:08.046 - 00:56:34.310, Speaker A: So once we have this set up and we've copied this, our metamask will be good to go. And I'm now going to close all of this and move on to the next step. So the next thing we're going to look at is ETH being required. So most blockchains charge a fee for you to use them. So this is like putting gas in your car. You need to put gas to drive somewhere. And ETH is kind of expensive.
00:56:34.310 - 00:57:00.546, Speaker A: I would recommend at least having 0.1 ETH in your account to transact. That's about $400 right now. Never used to be that much, but it is now. If you move to a blockchain like polygon, for instance, when you bridge over there, they'll actually airdrop you a certain amount of matic tokens, which is the gas that you need to perform actions on polygon. And that gets you going. But then once you are going, you will need to buy more.
00:57:00.546 - 00:57:19.578, Speaker A: The problem at the moment is ETH is expensive. And I've just given you the Ethereum gas price extension here. I'm just going to show you what that looks like. So that pops up here. This is the little thing, like earlier in the day when I was actually writing this tutorial. It was around 5123 is getting up there. It's getting up there.
00:57:19.578 - 00:57:51.090, Speaker A: ETH is expensive right now, but you can get a kind of sense of how expensive anything is going to be at the moment by looking here. If you get 50, 60. That's cheap. You should start doing what you need to do. So that's definitely something to look at there. And then the next question is, how do we get ETH? So that brings us on to the next topic, which is swapping. Slug a beer.
00:57:51.090 - 00:58:15.706, Speaker A: Got some questions here. By the way, does the final have a discord server? Yes, it does. It definitely does. Will says I have a Coinbase account and looking to purchase Terra. Where can I buy or swap for those tokens? So Terra isn't actually a token. Terra's native token is Luna. Terra is a blockchain and ecosystem, and it has lots of projects built on top of it.
00:58:15.706 - 00:58:56.370, Speaker A: Luna's native stablecoin is UST. That's actually something we're going to come back to later on. Luna is the collateral, which you use to buy ust you burn it. Again, this is beyond the pale for what we're doing here. Let's jump into swapping, which gives us a chance to kind of have a think about what we want to do in defi, our first defi move. So when I was thinking about this, if I'm coming to crypto and I think about Defi and I think about defi the right way, which is not massive gains, it's more like, how do I protect those gains and get a little bit more on top? So I wanted to do something simple. I wanted to do something with a stablecoin.
00:58:56.370 - 00:59:29.342, Speaker A: I was thinking about a savings product. I'm particularly looking know, looking at something with a nice rate of interest. Where I normally look for this is defi rate. This gives you a pretty good kind of overview of the interest rates that are available on, for instance, Dai. Dai is a stable coin that is backed by Ethereum. To mint it, you have to add Ethereum tokens as collateral on the Makerdao platform and then you'll be issued Dai. In exchange.
00:59:29.342 - 00:59:50.374, Speaker A: You're basically taking out a loan on your ETH for die. That's how dai is born. So if you want to lend Dai, you can get 8.5% on blockfly, 8% on Nexo. These aren't that sexy, to be honest. When you think about ten x gains and NFTs, 8.5% doesn't sound that sexy, but compare it to your bank account.
00:59:50.374 - 01:00:34.710, Speaker A: I think that's the main thing. You got to think about this as what would I normally be doing with my cash? And how can DFI do something that's better? Celsius is offering 10% on USTC. These rates have come down significantly and this is where I would normally look for a good stablecoin rate. But once the rates come down to, like, this single figures, even low double figures like this, you know that you need to be putting a ton of collateral in there, like 100,000 in to really make that worthwhile. And of course, these rates, all of them are variable. So where do we go? What's the next step for us? Well, here it is. Anchor.
01:00:34.710 - 01:01:05.906, Speaker A: So I've covered anchor all year, and it popped up on my radar because I was looking specifically at how to do know, financially independent, retire early. And you can only really do that if you can actually predictably model your earnings, your income for an entire year. You need to know where you're going. And anchor is interesting because it offers around about a 20% rate of interest. Fixed. Fixed. How it's able to do that, again, beyond the scope of what we're looking at today.
01:01:05.906 - 01:01:28.146, Speaker A: But if you go to the earn tab of the anchor protocol dashboard. Hey, look, here we are. It's already dipped below 90%. And the reason it's done that today is because the market is red. And if we were to look on the borrower side, we would probably see that there's a pretty. No, the borrower side hasn't even jumped up yet. So the earn side is dipping because the market is dipping.
01:01:28.146 - 01:02:14.642, Speaker A: Generally, it does tend to stabilize back towards 20%. But if you look at this line here, this represents how stable that interest rate is over time. And it's around 19%. It used to be around 20%, it's around 90%, but it's still extremely favorable compared to just keeping your savings in the bank. So how do we get there? Well, that's the thing, right? Anchor is on terror. And, hey, we've got ETH now. I was going to show you something else here, which is basically, how do we get to ETH? How do we even get there? So I wanted to look at Orion protocol.
01:02:14.642 - 01:02:37.838, Speaker A: So this is Orion money. And the reason Orion is interesting is because Orion allows you to deposit tokens on the Ethereum network and then take advantage of those savings on terra. So Terra is a completely separate blockchain. It has nothing to do with Ethereum. But Orion is saying you can deposit your stable coins with Orion money. Here you go. You can earn up to 20%.
01:02:37.838 - 01:02:55.294, Speaker A: And here's how it's doing. It deposits them on the ETH anchor. It converts them to UST, and then it deposits that ust into anchor. You don't need to worry about that. All you need to know is that Orion promises to give you around 20% on your favorite stable coins. They don't. They really, really don't.
01:02:55.294 - 01:03:15.738, Speaker A: But it's still good. So now you can see it says earn now 15% stable, but it's still better than that 10% that we were looking at here. So that's where I wanted to get to with all of this. So let's now have a look at how we would do that swapping process. And we had to talk about uniswap. Someone's mentioned it in the chat. Uniswap v three.
01:03:15.738 - 01:03:49.714, Speaker A: Yes. The ETH gas fees have gotten so bad these days that I tend to use layer two protocols and stay away from ETH. Yes, I understand. Push. We are starting from the beginning here, and I think everyone at some point comes into contact with Ethereum. It is pretty much a gateway drug for Defi. And it's also important to understand that if you don't want to pay those gas fees, why not? Why wouldn't you? And what is actually going on here? So, uniswap wasn't the first automated market maker, amm, but it was the one that really made it work.
01:03:49.714 - 01:04:18.602, Speaker A: Bancorp was actually the first, and no one really paid any attention to it, probably because it was too early. Uniswap really made it work, and uniswap has, because it's open source, has been forked onto every single other chain. There was a version of what looks like uniswap everywhere. So once you understand uniswap and you're comfortable with it, you can move to another chain, and it's very, very familiar. Understand once, understand always. So uniswap is basically this. It's a swapping protocol.
01:04:18.602 - 01:04:39.494, Speaker A: And here we can have a look at it. Here's the Uniswap protocol. I can launch the app. And there it is. So simple. If you've been onto a centralized exchange with all their sophisticated trading tools and their charts and everything else, you look at this and you go, what is this? It's trading for ants. What is this? Well, it's really, really simple.
01:04:39.494 - 01:05:15.460, Speaker A: One token, swap it for another token, boom, there you go. I want to swap. Let's say I want to swap 500 die for X amount of ETH. It'll figure it out, and then I can click on swap, and I'm good to go. That's it. If you want to see some tools for how to understand what's going on here, we can, for instance, look at ETH USDC on the Unisop vision page. That will give us an actual chart which we can use to kind of judge where the price is going.
01:05:15.460 - 01:05:46.346, Speaker A: I also looked at Dex tools. This is the Ohm Dai chart. This will give us a bit more kind of information. This again, this is using decentralized exchanges to provide more traditional trading input data. But if you really just want to swap, then this is it. The funny thing is, if I look at Terraswap, which is the decentralized exchange built on terra, it looks like this. Or if I look at Quickswap, which is the decentralized exchange built on polygon, it looks like this.
01:05:46.346 - 01:06:06.786, Speaker A: Or cowswap, which is a decentralized exchange built on gnosis. Interesting one, that gnosis, because you can trade on here. Gasless. Definitely something to cover in a future tutorial. One inch. One inch is a Dex aggregator. So it'll look at prices between different Dexes and pick the best price for you.
01:06:06.786 - 01:06:27.058, Speaker A: And here's matcha, basically another Dex aggregator. You can basically find the best price for you across different dexes. So all the tools are out there. Very sophisticated, very easy, and. Yeah, that's it. That's DFI. The key thing here is that you are swapping peer to peer.
01:06:27.058 - 01:06:39.398, Speaker A: There is no centralized exchange. You retain custody of your assets and you swap them. Very nice. Gas was less than 45 earlier today. Baby got charged back. Yes, it was. And then things got volatile.
01:06:39.398 - 01:07:20.886, Speaker A: Bitcoin dumped and boom. Tod Starbucks says I put $500 into anchor. It's $630 now. That's very good, Todd, but under what time frame? You need to let people know that as well. But hey, we're not going to use you to swap today, and I'll tell you why. If you heard about the ENS drop earlier in the year, those who were early on the Ethereum name service ended up getting in a pretty big payday. This was like 25, 30 grand worth of ENS tokens because they were early and used the service and uniswaps, all airdrop.
01:07:20.886 - 01:08:04.534, Speaker A: I think people got airdropped, 400 uni tokens and that ended up being an enormous amount of money. Metamask. It is assumed, although not guaranteed, that they're going to do a token. Joe Lubin has teased that they will. And so right now we're going to swap some ETH for USDC because basically what we're going to do is we're going to put some USDC into Orion and do our very first DFI move. Because for me this is Orion 15%, but moving just from ETH without bridging or anything else. This feels like a very simple, straightforward first DFI move.
01:08:04.534 - 01:08:31.322, Speaker A: So that's exactly what we're going to do. And the way we do that is this. I already have ETH in my wallet. If you don't have ETH, there are a few ways you can do it. Coinbase is like the most used on ramp before. Crypto right now allows you to connect a bank account. And then you can buy ETH, you can buy dai, you can buy a bunch of different cryptocurrencies, and then Coinbase custodies those for you, and then you can send them out to a wallet of your choosing.
01:08:31.322 - 01:08:57.080, Speaker A: But you don't have to do that, because in metamask itself, there is a buy button. You can buy with wire, you can buy with transact. So if you continue to wire, this is what's going to happen. Be a very familiar kind of page. You can set the amount in dollars that you want to buy in ETH, and then you add your credit card details in. Not everybody wants to do that, so let's not do that. Let's do it the other way.
01:08:57.080 - 01:09:23.454, Speaker A: We just jump ahead and assume that I already have ETH in my wallet, which I do. So now we're going to click on this swap button, and we're going to swap. Let me just select USDC here like this. And then I'm going to swap, let's say zero five. That's about $200. I'm not going to go crazy here. That's really what I need to do.
01:09:23.454 - 01:09:47.986, Speaker A: Like these slippage tolerances things when it's figures this low, not really that big a deal. So now we can just review the swap, and it's going to fetch me some quotes. So metamask is going to go out there and look for the best prices it can find. So 0.5 e right now, it will give me 196 USDC. In other words, $196. I can click swap.
01:09:47.986 - 01:10:21.060, Speaker A: And now we wait. That's it. And we've just done that completely decentralized. So we never had to give up our keys or custody of our assets to anyone else. We just did it directly in metamask. The reason we did that is because the more we use that swap feature in metamask, the more likely it is that we would be eligible for a metamask token drop if one were to happen. So why don't you go ahead and just do even the smallest token swap right now just so that you might be eligible for that drop when it happens.
01:10:21.060 - 01:10:44.490, Speaker A: We actually did a video about setting up an ES account before we even knew about the ENS drop. And I wish I'd been more vocal about it, honestly. So, here we go. The transaction is complete. My $200 or so have been confirmed, and I can look on ether scan. I can see five block confirmations. Now, this is the wonderful thing about the way blockchain works.
01:10:44.490 - 01:11:13.380, Speaker A: I can see that the one inch router was used to create wrapped ETH, and then that was routed to uniswap to create USDC. These are two completely separate exchange mechanisms, and yet they're being combined together via metamask without me even knowing what's going on. That right there is composability in action. It's using the best of one thing, the best of another, and boom. Fear. Dercher says $100 gas fees. Yeah.
01:11:13.380 - 01:11:30.520, Speaker A: If I'd done this tutorial. If I'd done this tutorial a little bit earlier in the day, well, the gas is like 65.8. Who knows what's going on? To be honest with you, it's a tutorial. It is what it is. I don't care. It's fine. So now what we're going to do is go to Orion and launch the d app.
01:11:30.520 - 01:12:11.346, Speaker A: So here we are. So now I need to connect my wallet. Someone was asking about connecting to different networks earlier. Up here in Metamask, you can click a drop down, let's close that. And you will be able to see different networks that I have, in fact, added to this wallet. These networks connect via something called RPC generally. For instance, if you go on to the Polygon quick swap decks, I believe that when you connect it for the first time, it will give you an option to do a very quick automated connection to an RPC network that will allow you to connect to Polygon directly.
01:12:11.346 - 01:12:50.990, Speaker A: It's a very straightforward thing. We're not going to cover it today, but that's essentially how you would do it. And you can switch very quickly between certain networks, not all of them, but if they're EVM compatible, like these ones are, then it's very easy for Metamask to connect to them. And you can just continue as you would with Metamask. But sometimes you need, for instance, I've got up here, the phantom wallet for Solana. But anyway, to continue what we're doing, I'm going to select the Ethereum network and the metamask. And now what I can do is click on deposit, select USDC, and then I can click on Max, because that's what I want to deposit.
01:12:50.990 - 01:13:23.306, Speaker A: I understand and accept how it works. Do you and then I approve and deposit, and then we have a $30 gas fee. Confirm that, and that's pretty much all I need to know, and I'm good to go. So we have successfully now set up our very first D five position, still approving. But once that's in, that USDC will sit effectively in a bank account. I need to confirm another one, another $90. So you can see how this adds up.
01:13:23.306 - 01:13:47.886, Speaker A: So I've just spent $150 to deposit, $196. Welcome to Ethereum, sir. Welcome to Ethereum. Which is why I recommend, if you're going to do this, go to another network. And that brings us very neatly on to the next thing that I want to cover, which is defi saver. So DeFi saver is a defi management app. When you go to it, it looks incredibly complicated.
01:13:47.886 - 01:14:36.520, Speaker A: Everything is like, whoa, numbers, numbers, a bunch of stuff. The most important thing you need to know is down here, simulation. So if I click off the simulation, it's going to end my simulation, because I was in one, right now, what DFI saver will allow you to do is spin up a simulation of what it would be like to have 100 ETH. And with 100 ETH, you can see here, now that I have 100 ETH, so what it's doing is it's created a separate instance of the Ethereum network that looks exactly like the wallet that I already have, but now I have 100 e, and now I can start to play around with different protocols in real time as if I was doing it for real. But I'm not actually spending any money. It's not real. So I can start looking at shifting things from one place to another and understanding how much that would cost me.
01:14:36.520 - 01:15:29.926, Speaker A: Down here you have what's called the recipe creator. I love this because this is money Legos made visual. So you can look down here and say, okay, mine comp rewards using die. If I click on that, what it gives me is five modules or steps that are referencing different things I would do on different protocols. So balance a flash loan, pull token, supply collateral to compound, borrow from compound, balance a loan, payback. You probably don't know what that means, but these are different steps that I'm doing on different protocols in an instant, in one block, and it's using all of these different pieces, all these different protocols, to create a recipe that you determine. And of course you can go down and make your own recipes, and there are a bunch of different things here.
01:15:29.926 - 01:16:20.710, Speaker A: But what sophisticated DFI and leveled up, scaled up DFI is able to do is string together upwards of like 10, 12, 13 different steps all in one transaction to allow you to do some very sophisticated things, particularly using flash loans to take advantage of the opportunities that are there in the market. Really, that's all we're trying to do. We're trying to take money that we have and make it work harder for us. Defi feels like it's this incredibly complex thing, but it's really not. It's just saying there is something there. I know that I can take advantage of it, and here are the steps that I need to get there. And instead of it being hidden behind a banking UI or a banking ecosystem, it's literally there for your brain to understand.
01:16:20.710 - 01:16:44.574, Speaker A: If I do this, this happens. If I do this, this happens. It's very, very logical. And the Defi saver recipe creator just breaks it open for you. Just so you're going to do this, you're going to do this, you're going to do this. You don't need to touch other, you don't need to touch compound. You can just go and look at these and set up your CDPs or your smart wallets, and you can go to the smart savings tab, and you can try and look for 3.34%
01:16:44.574 - 01:17:25.098, Speaker A: on AP on compound or 2.77% on other. These are very conservative interest rates now, and that's why we looked at anchor, because anchor is a much more interesting interest rate. Someone's asking in the chat, can I do defi with just $100? Yeah, you can, but I would suggest that it's not necessarily the most effective strategy. We were looking at the different mind states of utilizing the craziness of altcoins and all those things to big up your stack. And once you're happy, you could take something. Say I started with like $300.
01:17:25.098 - 01:18:23.274, Speaker A: Once I've made enough that my $300 is 20% of my overall stack, then, yeah, take that principal investment back and stick it in anchor and just continue adding to that stack over time and over time. So you always know that you're compounding that original investment. And whatever happens to the rest of what you put in, you know that that's still increasing in like DeFi on Ethereum is punishing and the gas fees are insane. And generally, I would recommend to have six figures more to do DeFi on ETH. The thing is, on terra, for instance, you don't even need anywhere near that much. You can absolutely 100% do DFI in a much cheaper way on finance. Smart chain on terra Avalanche is going to be really interesting as well, and who knows what Kanana is going to be capable of when it pops up? Kusama Polkadot, very interesting as well.
01:18:23.274 - 01:19:00.682, Speaker A: But essentially it's more about education. Defi Saver is their simulation tool is phenomenal. We will dig into it more in a subsequent video when we follow up on this. But really, this was it. This was simply, I know how to turn my ETH into USDC. I know how to set up a wallet in a way that isn't going to connect me to custodial services. And I also know that even if I don't feel confident bridging to another network, there are products, there are things that are connecting to those networks for me, like Orion money, that mean I don't have to.
01:19:00.682 - 01:19:34.930, Speaker A: And then beyond that, there's a product like Defi Saver that's going to allow me to learn for free. Learn for free. Get to understand these primitives, these protocols, what's happening here and understanding what's happening when liquidations kind of cascade through. It's a deeply fascinating, but really not that complex world. And you can start to slowly level up and slowly level up. So I hope that was super helpful and super interesting. It was great for me to just kind of cap the defi journey at a certain point, because I know there's a lot further we can go.
01:19:34.930 - 01:20:01.130, Speaker A: I'm just going to have a look at the questions. So JP says, thank you all for answering my question. Can I use a prepaid Visa gift card to buy my first crypto? Yes, absolutely, you can. It will depend on whether wire accepts that. But inherently, if it's Visa, then you should be able to. These services, like wire, they just read your debit card like it's a debit card. I have in my wallet here a card that I never ever use.
01:20:01.130 - 01:20:10.490, Speaker A: It's a crypto.com. Can see that. It's the ruby crypto.com card. There you go. You're about to see it better there. Beautiful thing, made of metal.
01:20:10.490 - 01:20:31.570, Speaker A: If you watch the Formula one, you'll see crypto.com everywhere. I never use this card. Maybe I should, but absolutely, 100% you can. Visa is, I think they have approved USDC as a settlement layer for payments at the moment. So that's very interesting. But hey, thank you so much for turning up to the stream.
01:20:31.570 - 01:20:38.460, Speaker A: If you have any questions, drop them now. Algasmov, I'm going to put it over to you. Do you have any questions for me?
01:20:41.630 - 01:20:49.770, Speaker B: How involved are you in defi applications? What Defi applications are you using heavily? The most on a daily basis.
01:20:50.130 - 01:21:49.840, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really good question. None is the answer because honestly, uniswap, I should be using cowswap a lot more and I really want to be using cowswap a lot more. But it's mainly because I find it very difficult to disengage the journalistic brain from the emotional connection you have when you're too invested in a protocol. So I kind of made a promise to myself this year that I would just be hands off and be a journalist and not engage too much with any one given protocol. I mean, I really have enjoyed looking at things like ohm, like Alchemyx, like terra of course avalanche really surprised me this year, and Polkadot and Kusama just I see so much that I really enjoyed about terror being built there, but I'm not doing so know it's more just journalistic at the moment.
01:21:52.530 - 01:21:53.406, Speaker B: That's cool.
01:21:53.508 - 01:22:18.314, Speaker A: Euphrates is asking if it was a great session, will you allow replay for the one student night? Yes, of course. And ALP's going to spend the rest of the night putting chapter markers in because he loves that. No, he won't. So I think it's time for us to end the broadcast there. I hope you enjoyed this. This is super foundational, but it was great to be able to just dig into the absolute. Oh look, wait, they've got another question.
01:22:18.314 - 01:22:56.814, Speaker A: Do anonymous founders worry you? No is the answer to that, because I don't think they're any different to the ones who are docs, to be honest with you. There are a lot of anonymous founders who are suspect. Yeah, but a lot who aren't. And you could say exactly the same thing about those who aren't anonymous. It makes no bones at all. Are we worried about people just running off and moving on to a different protocol? Yes, we're in a risky phase of the market right now and a risky phase of defi right now. But without the ability to be anonymous, we wouldn't have so much crazy innovation.
01:22:56.814 - 01:23:15.482, Speaker A: And I think that is probably the most valuable part of this right now. Anyway, that definitely is time for us to end it. It's been a wonderful session. I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you will tune in for the next one. Of course. As I said before, if you liked this, get subscribed. We do tons of this stuff.
