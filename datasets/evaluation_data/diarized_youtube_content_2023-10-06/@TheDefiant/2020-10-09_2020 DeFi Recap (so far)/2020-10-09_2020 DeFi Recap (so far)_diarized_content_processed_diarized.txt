00:00:00.330 - 00:00:23.518, Speaker A: Hello and welcome to a very special edition of the Defiant. Now, we had some criticism on the channel this week saying we'd gone too far into entertainment. And if you saw the Avagotchi episode. Well, yeah, maybe you're right. So this week we're going back to fact, sort of. Now, if you want to see what an Andre Cronier perfume commercial looks like, well, stay tuned for that. So this week I was invited to open the Defi track at the LA blockchain week.
00:00:23.518 - 00:01:01.786, Speaker A: And that was a pretty cool chance to reflect on what's been going on this year, to recap on what's been going on this year, to rewind, to reverse, however you want to call it. And so we did that by taking the best bits of the videos we've made and then linking it together with some other stuff. And it ended up being pretty funny. So there's some sketches you haven't seen before. But I also had a chance to speak to Camilla last night and get her thoughts on what's been happening this year. Some pretty good insights there. So we bundled it all together into one super heavy, fact based entertainment piece with some jokes in there and some bad wigs and some green screen and some nipples.
00:01:01.786 - 00:01:14.126, Speaker A: Watch out for that. Enjoy. What have you learned this year about DeFi and its place as a legit concern for crypto and blockchain?
00:01:14.238 - 00:02:13.314, Speaker B: This year was absolutely huge for Defi. If you look at the main metric, total value locked, judging by that, growth has been incredible. And I think what we've learned is how incredibly important incentives are. In the end, money drives people and drives liquidity drives community excitement. These are our tools that can really help bootstrap protocols that can help drive liquidity and users to a protocol. And just started with comp and then with compound token and then it really blew up with balancer, apple force, mstable, like all these other protocols, trying out these new incentive mechanisms. And then this idea kind of grew farther into pushing teams to become more and more decentralized, more community owned.
00:02:13.314 - 00:02:49.746, Speaker B: Defi users are demanding to earn as much as possible from the protocols that they're using and to own the protocols that they're using. And if they're not getting that sort of ownership and value, then they will fork it and create something that is. And I guess what remains to be seen is how those initial token incentives that drove so much value can work to kind of keep that value in these protocols. And I think we don't have the answer to that yet.
00:02:49.848 - 00:03:56.770, Speaker A: So I want to throw an idea at you which is the idea of video games from the old days. Like, you would buy a video game and you'd play it and it would be played out. You'd done everything there was to do in the game and then you could buy expansion packs and it would just open up a whole new world for you. It feels to me, and I'm referring to wax, for instance, which has completely redone its token economics so that it does all its NFT business on wax. But all the financial part goes back to Ethereum. You've got Solana literally today announcing the wormhole. To me, it feels like if this year was just buying the game and playing the game, what's coming is all the expansion packs, which is the layer ones that really understand what's going on, are opening up their, let's say, superior speed, lower costs to all the money that's sitting on Ethereum in a way that allows all of that value to move backwards and forwards at speed and freely, kind of opening up international trade effectively.
00:03:56.770 - 00:04:06.650, Speaker A: So I'm curious what your feeling is on cross chain bridges and their ability to unlock liquidity for chains that might not have it on their own.
00:04:06.800 - 00:04:58.726, Speaker B: Cross chain bridges, L2 solutions. All of that will have to be the future of not just d five, but just all of web3. Like all of the different applications that are being built on Ethereum and just blockchain technology. Obviously it's clear that Ethereum cannot withstand all of the processing and transaction that's needed to sustain a whole financial system. It can barely handle DeFi as it is today, which is completely kind of tiny and niche. So it's so clear that bridges with faster layer ones and L2 solutions on top of Ethereum will be key for things to actually take off and succeed.
00:04:58.838 - 00:05:08.000, Speaker A: Looking back on this year, heroes and villains, who for you has been the hero of this year in Defi? And you can't say me.
00:05:10.690 - 00:06:39.610, Speaker B: I guess I'll just go with the first person that came to mind, and that's Hayden Adams. So for different reasons, I think just like by the numbers, again, Unisoft is right now, the project is the most total vital lot. So that in itself makes Hayden, the founder of that project, a hero or the hero right now. Another reason is that uniswap really does reflect the higher goals of Defi in general. The fact that it's really decentralized, it doesn't have admin keys, it's running autonomously on smart contracts. There's all these different kind of goals that many projects are aspiring to, but Unisoft had from the very beginning and more so now with its uni tokens and governance going to the community. So it started in a very decentralized place, and now this year, it's moved even further down to that goal.
00:06:39.610 - 00:07:27.946, Speaker B: The other reason is his role in this kind of drama with Sushiswap, where in the middle of all that craziness, he was criticized for taking VC money and all that stuff, and Sushiswap being supposedly the more, like, community driven project. But how that played out with chef Nomi taking the funds and then returning them, that did prove that it's not black and white. And in the end, Unisoft does have kind of this long term view.
00:07:28.048 - 00:08:03.186, Speaker A: My hero of the year is Andre Cronier, and it's not because he studied Wyrn, and it's not because of the craziness around it. It's actually because of the way he handled himself once they'd gone big, because he didn't change. He was exactly the same guy who'd been kind of just talking and chatting that he was when it was just iron. And I give him a lot of credits for that because he didn't let it go to his head. He was just the same guy. And it would have been very easy for that not to happen. Hello, and welcome to the Defi track at the LA blockchain summit.
00:08:03.186 - 00:08:17.020, Speaker A: My name is Robin Schmidt, and I'm the creative director at Harmony. And if you're wondering why I've been asked to speak today, well, it's mainly because I've spent the last few months telling stories about DeFi. And when I say stories, I mean stories, because this has been what.
00:08:18.750 - 00:08:19.114, Speaker C: They.
00:08:19.152 - 00:08:19.674, Speaker A: Want me to say.
00:08:19.712 - 00:08:20.300, Speaker C: What?
00:08:21.490 - 00:08:23.006, Speaker A: No, I can't do that.
00:08:23.028 - 00:08:24.190, Speaker D: I can't be bored.
00:08:26.130 - 00:08:27.120, Speaker C: Hang on.
00:08:30.210 - 00:08:37.010, Speaker A: Okay. This is an LA blockchain exclusive. That's right. It's called a pre mine.
00:08:37.670 - 00:08:39.246, Speaker D: Smells like victory.
00:08:39.438 - 00:09:16.046, Speaker A: There's no doubt that we will look back on 2020 as the breakout year for DFI, and with it, a whole bunch of jargon and general verbiage that was added to the already bewildering lexicon of crypto mumbo jumbo. I am, of course, talking about TvL, or total value locked. And if we look at the numbers for today, DFI accounts for $10.9 billion of value. A year ago, that was $522,000,000. And back in March, that was $538,000,000. But then, now that rise to $10.9
00:09:16.046 - 00:09:42.678, Speaker A: billion happened in less than six months. So clearly, there's something exciting going on here. And that's probably why you are all here. Or, well, not actually here, but where you are. And by the way, if you're not wearing pants right now, I get it. I've been there. Now, I've been a filmmaker for 20 years, and let me tell you, if I pitched the stories coming out of DFI in any other context, I'd be kicked out on my ass and told never to come back.
00:09:42.678 - 00:10:14.720, Speaker A: It's shakespearean, with larger than life heroes and villains, huge twists, and a seemingly never ending conveyor belt of copycats and scammers. And if there's one phrase that's come to symbolize all of this, it's I had no idea. As in, I had no idea Wifi was going to hit $44,000 a token, or I had no idea an anonymous dev with a direct copy of a protocol could be capable of exit scamming. And herein lies the problem. Because honestly, nobody has any idea. And that means you too.
00:10:16.690 - 00:10:23.870, Speaker D: Automated market maker, liquidity provider.
00:10:24.610 - 00:10:25.360, Speaker C: You.
00:10:28.330 - 00:10:30.550, Speaker D: Ox, Chad.
00:10:34.730 - 00:11:21.826, Speaker A: Lobster. And even if they do have an idea, that idea, as good or as bad as it might be, gets launched into production with minimal development, zero auditing. And then. So what on earth was going on that caused this big run up? After all, we had Defi darlings already, like Maker and uniswap. And the thing is, for your average crypto cobra kai stablecoins, they just aren't sexy. Sorry guys, but they're not. Honestly though, for all the noise and savagery, a recap of this year can be reduced to two basic components, the comp token and a south african developer with a ponchon for weightlifting.
00:11:21.826 - 00:11:22.600, Speaker A: Ready?
00:11:23.290 - 00:12:02.930, Speaker D: But first, let's do a quick recap on DeFi. What we're talking about here is an ecosystem of decentralized applications, enabling anyone with an Internet connection to access a variety of financial products and services, spanning crypto asset exchanges, margin trading, financial derivatives, synthetic assets, algorithm trading, and lending markets. Got it. But the biggest change to come about recently is from protocols like balancer and compound distributing their own native tokens to incentivize liquidity, increasing activity and returns for traders as these tokens gain in value. So this is what we're really talking about with farming, planting seeds and reaping crops in the form of these additional tokens. And appropriately enough, I have some lego in front of me to demonstrate. So here's how it works.
00:12:02.930 - 00:12:30.010, Speaker D: You start with a token, let's say die, which you place in compound. Now, there's an interest rate for leaving the dye there, which you will earn more die with. Very nice. But on top of that, you earn comp, a governance token, which is also yours and which also has value, and those are yours to withdraw whenever you like and do with what you feel like. Happy farming.
00:12:36.750 - 00:12:38.090, Speaker C: You want to be a farmer?
00:12:38.170 - 00:12:42.382, Speaker A: Here's a couple of acres. Farm token. Token go.
00:12:42.436 - 00:12:42.798, Speaker C: Up.
00:12:42.884 - 00:13:14.294, Speaker A: And up it went. Indeed. Comp flew past $300 a token and kick started a farming frenzy as DFI suddenly became the new Ico boom, but with even less transparency, even faster implosions, and no kyc anywhere to be found. Cool. And then came Andre Sony, a man with intentions so pure, he was quickly elevated to the status of Demigod. If you could bottle Andre, people would buy.
00:13:14.332 - 00:13:14.920, Speaker C: It.
00:13:44.210 - 00:14:28.174, Speaker A: Is a decentralized ecosystem of aggregators that utilize lending services such as ArV, compan, Didx and Fulcrum to optimize your token lending. Boring. Or so what. But then Andre launched a token Wi Fi, or if in the community, Waifu, which isn't so much the story as how he launched the token. That's the story because, well, he just launched it. No advanced warning, no pre mined, just 28,000 tokens of which he owned zero. And so kickstarted the fair launch meme with communities ever more vocal in their mission to get protocols to do what they wanted, in most cases, launch a goddamn token.
00:14:28.174 - 00:14:55.580, Speaker A: And if the project wouldn't do it, well, then they were goddamn going to goddamn do it themselves. Now, governance tokens are so hot right now. So hot right now. We had comp, we had Baal, we had wifi, we had yams. Yams. But there was one very highly thought of project that hadn't come to the party yet, even though they had a token ready to go. And the frenzied horde was starting to lose patience, because this particular token looked like a slam dunk surefire hit.
00:14:55.580 - 00:15:31.990, Speaker A: And that's exactly what happened with curve. As an anonymous community member by the name of Ox, Chad deployed Curve's contracts himself, and suddenly the token was live. It was out there, it was real. And whether we believe that it wasn't the team or not, you have to admit that was a pretty stylish way to do it. So now we have a perfect feeding frenzy. Everyone's a farmer and loving it. They'll eat anything.
00:15:31.990 - 00:15:43.880, Speaker A: Pickles, yams, kimchi, puff pastry, gonads, you name it. But now this is putting pressure on one particular project, as this stolen footage of FBI experiments on yield farmers clearly shows.
00:15:49.890 - 00:16:23.810, Speaker C: It. What am I supposed to do with this? Make the rest. Where's the good stuff? This is what you get, Joker. I'll show you. Yeah.
00:16:23.880 - 00:16:41.066, Speaker A: Now, Unisoft doesn't dominate the market the way bitcoin does, but at over 20% of TVL, it's still significant. And now there was a target on its back in the shape of sushi swap. Here's a quick summary. It's up, it's down. It's the greatest, it's the worst community.
00:16:41.168 - 00:16:41.482, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:41.536 - 00:16:42.118, Speaker A: VC.
00:16:42.214 - 00:16:42.806, Speaker C: Meh.
00:16:42.918 - 00:16:50.254, Speaker A: It's a scam. Not a scam. Might be a scam. Was it a scam? Time for Sam Bankman. Free, great hair, fair launch. What's for lunch? Fork it. Don't fork it.
00:16:50.254 - 00:16:55.134, Speaker A: Fetch the pitchforks. To me. To, you know, me. Yes, chef. Top chef, mosque death. Take some stick. Top pick.
00:16:55.134 - 00:17:00.062, Speaker A: I need unique. Unique unicorns. Uniswap, top flop. Chop it to the. Drop it like it's hot. Knives out. Let's see.
00:17:00.062 - 00:17:47.970, Speaker A: Bro, do you even sushi? It does that about COVID it. And sushi swap is significant because it gave us the first truly great villain of 2020, which is ironic because he was initially praised for being a hero. Enter chef nomi. He was anonymous, armed with an agenda, and ready to do battle. You see, uniswap had now found itself under fire for being some form of VC puppet. And with fair launch, the dominant meme of the summer, this narrative gained traction like wildfire. And using the composability of defi Legos to his advantage, chef Nomi forked Uniswap, added a token, and then proceeded to siphon Uniswap's liquidity in what became known as the vampire protocol.
00:17:47.970 - 00:18:53.234, Speaker A: Now, this wouldn't work unless LPs were prepared to play the game and make the switch. So let's think about it. Anonymous developer, blatant ripoff, sketchy mechanics, and, of course, nobody was interested. What a farmers went berserk, pillaging the fields and generally wrecking Uniswap's liquidity pools. But then, of course, chef Nomi pulled a fast one and ran off with $13 million in dev funds because, well, wouldn't you? He eventually gave the money back, but only after a giant kerfuffle, which is really just an excuse for me to say the word kerfuffle on camera. And the arrival of one Sam Bankman. Fried hair and all to the rescue with serum.
00:18:53.234 - 00:18:58.620, Speaker A: And do you know what? It's all too complicated. So how about some music?
00:19:11.890 - 00:20:13.410, Speaker E: I said I was community, but I did. Like a jerk, I stole Hayden's liquidity without doing any work. I know that you've been scammed before the red flags we ignore this time it's different? This time it's right just grab yourself some sushi the future's bright different this time it's true you can call me Master savior modexes packed with flavor yes, it is. It's so tasty sitting around the campfire just me then a vampire preparing every detail 30 million. Thank you. Retail.
00:20:14.550 - 00:20:17.940, Speaker A: I'm the dumping. I'm a good guy.
00:20:19.510 - 00:20:54.990, Speaker E: This town is different. This time it's true, I swear.
00:20:55.330 - 00:20:56.682, Speaker C: I'm not jumping.
00:20:56.746 - 00:21:03.070, Speaker E: I'm not jumping on you. You can believe me. I'm the real master chef.
00:21:05.990 - 00:22:36.842, Speaker A: So there's a lesson here, which is nothing is really what it seems in defi, including me. These glasses, they're not real. And that's ironic, since it's supposed to be an open and transparent community. And in many ways that does allow the community to self govern and self police in ways we haven't seen before. But it's also important to remember that there are a million ways for the unsuspecting to get wrecked. Now, the farming craze threw up some genuinely baffling stories and experiments along the way. And this was kind of exemplified by memecoin, which emerged as the result of a joke tweet from consensus defi product lead Jordan Lyle.
00:22:36.842 - 00:22:47.170, Speaker A: Now, he posted a UI of a fictitious product poking fun at all the copy paste defi protocols popping up everywhere. And suddenly the legend of degenerator was born.
00:22:49.910 - 00:23:08.630, Speaker F: When I was a seedling, I used to dream of all the places I would go and of all the things I could be. But everywhere I looked, the life I imagined was just a cruel, sick joke.
00:23:16.330 - 00:23:20.906, Speaker B: Why don't you tell me what's on your mind? Any degenerate thoughts?
00:23:21.098 - 00:23:45.250, Speaker F: You don't get it, do you? All I have are degeneres thoughts. For my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do. And people are starting to notice. I give into it. I embrace it like a brother.
00:23:50.170 - 00:23:53.400, Speaker D: You think this is funny? This is a joke to you?
00:23:57.050 - 00:24:02.410, Speaker F: You can call me degenerator.
00:24:07.070 - 00:24:07.820, Speaker E: Oh.
00:24:09.870 - 00:24:38.238, Speaker A: Now meme blasted from zero to a high of $1,598, a token in a fug of pineapple smoke, and looked almost exactly like a pump and dump. But actually, the project is legit and represents the first attempt to marry NFTs with DFI. And for many wise voices in our space, NFTs represent the next great frontier. If only we can escape from the elephant. Or is it a cat? In the room. Nfts. Nonfungible tokens.
00:24:38.238 - 00:24:41.430, Speaker A: If it's funging you're after, then you've come to the wrong funging place.
00:24:41.500 - 00:24:45.542, Speaker E: What did he say? Funging. Urban slang. Feeling and looking good.
00:24:45.596 - 00:25:25.294, Speaker A: Now, there is a problem you encounter when talking about NFTs, and that is that it's impossible to talk about them without. Well, you know what? Creeping in at every opportunity, journalists just can't seem to help themselves, knowingly referencing it whenever discussing non fungies. It's wild success. Seemingly yet another example of crypto's dumb, irrational exuberance. Because that's all there is to NFTs. You just can't escape them, no matter how hard you try. So that was a very brief history of the year so far in defi.
00:25:25.294 - 00:25:33.350, Speaker A: There are so many more stories to tell. But as always, stay safe out there. Stock up on crypto Bismol and watch out for rug pulls.
00:25:33.930 - 00:25:44.394, Speaker C: Hey, let me ask you a question. Like rugs. I got loads of rugs. I got rugs for all different occasions. You load them up and then you got to pull people out the way like this. Pull. Pull.
00:25:44.394 - 00:25:59.690, Speaker C: You know what I'm talking about? Hey, Mark, get over here. Let's demonstrate with the people how we do this. Now he's standing on here. Now, guys, you got to make sure. Load up the rugs with a lot of people. There's not a lot of people. No point pulling the rug.
00:25:59.690 - 00:26:07.410, Speaker C: Got to be heavy. Load up, like the whales say. Heavy. Load up. Heavy. Pull down. So, Marv, going to stand here, then we're going to pull.
00:26:07.410 - 00:26:20.278, Speaker C: Hey, come here, you crazy bastard. Come on. All right, so now you grab hold like this. Make sure you have a firm pull and there's plenty loaded up on the run. Otherwise, no point doing the run. Pull. You know how we do, guys.
00:26:20.278 - 00:26:24.630, Speaker C: Okay, are you ready, Mav? It don't matter because we're gonna put him now.
00:26:24.780 - 00:26:25.510, Speaker E: Yay.
00:26:26.010 - 00:26:39.800, Speaker C: Look at that, guys. If you ever seen a rug pull like that. Guys, they're gonna smash him. You know what I'm saying? That is the rug pull. That is the way Johnny do the Johnny rug Emporium. Hey, Marv, you okay? I don't care.
00:26:40.370 - 00:26:40.974, Speaker E: Ha.
00:26:41.092 - 00:26:51.514, Speaker C: Okay, you get the big one. This is only $13 million. Okay, deal. For you, my friend. Oh, the little one. This is $9 million just for you. Don't delay.
00:26:51.514 - 00:26:52.720, Speaker C: Buy one today.
00:26:54.530 - 00:26:55.450, Speaker A: Enjoy the summit.
