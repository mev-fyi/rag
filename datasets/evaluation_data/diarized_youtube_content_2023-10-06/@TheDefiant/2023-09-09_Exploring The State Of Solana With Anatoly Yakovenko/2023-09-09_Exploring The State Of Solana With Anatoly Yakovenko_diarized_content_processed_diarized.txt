00:00:25.970 - 00:00:40.646, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Defiant news here with another weekly recap. And we have a special guest, Anatoly of Solana, here, as well as Jeremy Nation, our reporter. Anatoly, I'm going to butcher your last name. That's why I didn't say it, so.
00:00:40.748 - 00:00:41.830, Speaker B: Oh, no worries.
00:00:43.370 - 00:01:21.986, Speaker A: But, yeah, anyways, we had a lot of Solana news came down the pipe this week. We had visa integrating or using Solana to send payments. It's a bit more technical than that, so we'll get into that. And we also had the founder of Makerdao Rune say that he was pushing for forking Solana's code base in order to work on Maker's backend. So we're hoping to discuss that, plus a couple of things coming out of Solana. And that's where I think Jeremy just has one note from a sponsor and we'll be good to roll.
00:01:22.098 - 00:01:45.950, Speaker C: Yeah, I just wanted to mention, this broadcast is brought to you by Arch, who empowers you to invest in the best of crypto on web3 with ease and confidence.

00:01:46.850 - 00:02:17.160, Speaker A: Right on. All right, so, Anatoly, we got a lot to go through. I think I'll just start off with maybe the visa news, which feels like ages ago, but I think that was only. Did you, did you know that was coming down the pipe? Did it come as a surprise? Did you work with Visa to make that happen? What do you think of it? We can kind of keep it.
00:02:19.790 - 00:02:57.090, Speaker B: I know that the foundation team talks to a lot of these big companies, and these conversations are like, take a year, two years. It's just these teams take. These big companies have to spend a lot of time to get comfortable. And the visa team was doing a lot of research on how Solana works. They did a lot of research across a bunch of different blockchains. And it's pretty cool that they thought that our solution was the closest thing to what could be comparable to their internal centralized system. So it's know Solana is just a bunch of open source code.
00:02:57.090 - 00:03:18.460, Speaker B: That's all it is, just code and run by volunteers and volunteer hardware. It's really cool that it can even be in the same conversation as one of the biggest companies in the world that does global payment. So I think this is a huge step, I think, for not just Solana, but I think for crypto. In.
00:03:25.250 - 00:03:32.880, Speaker A: Mean, maybe they were in contact with you, but from, like, a technical standpoint, could they just tap Solana's network and not.
00:03:33.570 - 00:04:31.234, Speaker B: Yeah, they're just using. Can you guys can go do USDC transfers, you can build a remittance app. There's like dozens of these that have been built by developers and Solana in various stages of, like, USDC is a very good product. I think the killer feature of blockchains is the fact that you have permissionless transfers for digital dollars. And this is something that just makes money like, a thousand times easier to program. I don't know. I signed up for my Twitter whatever payouts, and I had to give stripe, like a pound of flesh and rib and my firstborn, and then a developer on Solana built this kind of cheesy email service, which just like dollar gated emails, and you just use a wallet to set it up.
00:04:31.234 - 00:05:14.462, Speaker B: There's no login. That's it. So there's kind of a world of difference for programmable money, meaning that it's money that consumers are now receiving and playing around with and building applications. And to me, it almost feels like, I don't know if you remember when it was really hard to do, like, a person to person credit card transfer, and then square built a little dongle that plugged into a magnetic audio port on your phone to scan it. That was like such a cheesy hack, but all of a sudden you could actually take somebody's credit card payment. That was like a big unlock for the world. I think USDC and the fact that it's just so easy to program is similar.
00:05:14.462 - 00:06:05.486, Speaker B: It's a big unlock. But right now, I think only for developers, you see folks like Tiplink that are kind of building something like Twilio for payments and stuff like that, take advantage of this and build really cool applications. But I think there's signs that we now see with folks like Visa, their innovation teams, taking really serious steps to see can this technology replace some of their internal things, make them better? My feeling is that the systems that we're building that are open and permissionless have to be better than the centralized ones. They have to be cheaper, they have to be faster, they have to be more reliable and resilient. The resilient part, I think, is proven already. Bitcoin, Ethereum are incredibly resilient. Solana is getting there, and I think we want to prove that it can also be cheaper and faster.
00:06:05.678 - 00:06:29.542, Speaker A: Yeah, I've seen that thematically, during, I mean, talking to other people, I was talking with someone at centrifuge, and he was pointing out that they literally are just trying to compete on costs for some of the DFI applications, which I feel like people talked about in 2018, and then they kind of forgot about it when everyone was making money, but everyone was talking about cutting out the middleman and just like, literally.
00:06:29.606 - 00:07:18.546, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the whole point. Defi should be cheaper and faster and way more reliable. When something happens in a lending protocol, there's a very fast, simple, deterministic liquidation process. Everything gets unraveled in a very orderly manner in minutes, not like years. If you think about the world in the future, like 50 years from now, 100 years from now, there's no way this stuff is going to keep running by people in giant buildings, right? It's just absurd. It all has to run on computers with an open, transparent code that everyone understands and agrees. That's been verified to death and formally proven and with multiple implementations.
00:07:18.546 - 00:07:38.590, Speaker B: Still a lot of steps there. But I think it's clear that that should be the future, and it's clear that we should be building it because it creates value for the world. Not even about token numbers going up, it just cuts out the middleman, makes things cheaper, it makes things more reliable and really transparent. That's a win for everyone, for every consumer.
00:07:39.810 - 00:07:48.980, Speaker A: Yeah. It does seem like we're getting back to that message in the bear market and kind of sharpening that sword, which is nice to see after.
00:07:50.710 - 00:07:55.250, Speaker B: The builders have had this message through the bull market. It's just we got drowned out.
00:07:55.400 - 00:08:01.414, Speaker A: Yeah, well, yeah, we had to shill NFTs for hundreds of times what they should be worth.
00:08:01.532 - 00:08:18.010, Speaker C: But when the price action dissipates, we see this kind of return to the core fundamental disintermediation that this kind of like the whole principles of disrupt everything. Right? And part of that disruption has been enticing to players like visa.
00:08:18.670 - 00:08:35.840, Speaker B: Visa provides a super valuable service, right? They deal with risk, they deal with credit. All those things are still going to be there. But the rails that they use should be super cheap, super fast and global. That should be just the default, right? That's kind of obvious to everyone.
00:08:37.250 - 00:09:19.246, Speaker A: Yeah, I was talking to my girlfriend yesterday just about like a Venmo, and she's not in payment space, but, yeah, just like taking five days and not understanding, and I was like, well, 400 milliseconds. Yeah. Anyways, Jeremy, I don't want to run you over, but we can. I don't know, maybe the next thing to go into would be, I mean, also just the other big surprise this week was rune suggesting that maker use Solana's code base as a backend. I don't know if you had talks with him, know, that was kind of.
00:09:19.268 - 00:09:43.826, Speaker B: Out of the moral. Yeah, it was very much out of the. It's awesome. I want there to be a lot of Salana forks. I'm an open source maxi first. I think Salana is built on top of Linux. That would take $10 billion to rebuild Linux.
00:09:43.826 - 00:10:40.018, Speaker B: It's a massive gift to every developer, LVM, rust, all these technologies that would otherwise not be available. Right. To me as an open source dev, that I feel like it's my duty to give back. In a lot of ways, the reason why Solano is built and works is because of all the other open source devs that got us here, and even folks from the Ethereum foundation that did amazing. It's really good to see that. I think all the optimizations that we've done with the idea that there can be a single global execution engine that can handle all the applications are very much applicable to a lot of other use cases beyond. Just like, let's cover the entire world for this thing, because that technology gets battle tested in this open, permissionless big network that Solana Mainet is.
00:10:40.018 - 00:11:11.780, Speaker B: But you can definitely take it and reuse it inside an application specific environment. And we're happy to help them with whatever tweaks they need to make and stuff like that. I think it's just awesome to get that code reuse and getting them to understand SVM and build tooling and more docs for applications, more how to. It's just awesome. It's just going to accelerate the entire ecosystem. So if anyone else is thinking about forking Salana, I'm 100% for it. Fork away, I'll help you.
00:11:12.230 - 00:11:20.406, Speaker A: Yeah, they were talking about building their own client too, I think. I read the post this morning, so that was surprising too, that there's like.
00:11:20.428 - 00:11:56.018, Speaker B: A couple of teams building clients. Fire dancer is obviously the big one that's driven by some really good engineers at a jump, and I think there's two other ones. One team is trying to build just a validating client, which would be running on as cheap as possible hardware, and the only thing it's doing is just validating the ledger after it's been confirmed. And that's a much easier job. You can do less ram, you know all the data ahead of time, so you can pre fetch everything. It's just a much easier path. So there's a lot of ways, I think, for them to do that.
00:11:56.018 - 00:12:31.942, Speaker B: I'd honestly say that jump into one of these other efforts and accelerate it, and then two clients is better than one, three is better than two. After four, we get a bit diminishing returns. But I think after. My theory is, I don't know if this is true, if this will happen eventually. Either GPT five or GPT six should be able to look at two or three salana implementations and build its own. At some point. Within five to ten years, that'll be true.
00:12:31.942 - 00:12:39.680, Speaker B: So I think once we get to two or three clients, we're pretty good. We can generate a number of clients after that.
00:12:40.050 - 00:12:40.926, Speaker A: Right on.
00:12:41.028 - 00:12:51.474, Speaker C: That's almost a natural segue to your guys AI grant that. You guys, you have a $10 million fund, $25,000 per grant. What's kind of like pushing that? I know you had a plugin built.
00:12:51.512 - 00:13:44.782, Speaker B: In May, so what's funny is that before I started Salana and how I got into crypto, Steve Ackridge is one of the co founders. We were actually building this kind of cheesy side project called the Tensor Cloud. We were setting up hardware boxes at data centers with GPUs and mining crypto with them, but designing the software to run deep learning. So this was kind of pre OpenAI. I think OpenAI just started and we were like, okay, we think deep learning is going to be a thing. We're going to build these boxes, but they're expensive, there's a lot of GPUs, and what is this stupid crypto thing that people are paying us for doing nothing right? Might as well use it to pay for the hardware. But that's how I started thinking about proof of work and consensus and had my eureka moment.
00:13:44.782 - 00:14:13.710, Speaker B: But I think it's very cool technology. I think it's a little bit overhyped right now. It's definitely powerful, but we're going to see kind of very slow tweet. It's going to start helping developers and content creators in a very slow way. And I think within five to ten years, it'll accelerate. But I think people are. The expectations that people have are a little bit too great.
00:14:13.710 - 00:15:02.594, Speaker B: But why I'm so excited about it is that it feels like we're over the hump. It's kind of downhill from my perspective. All it takes is just more hardware. Now they've proven out that you can do very complex task planning and prediction that is very sophisticated with just GPUs, and those things are going to double every two years. It's just going to get better and better, and you start seeing this thing get really good within ten years and that's like the exciting thing. I think it's going to take ten years, but it's pretty awesome. I think this technology is unlikely to give us a breakout crypto app or anything like that, but it's super inspiring.
00:15:02.594 - 00:15:30.710, Speaker B: It just really gets my developer juices going. Like what if, right? Could this work here or whatever? And I think that's worth encouraging in the ecosystem. Just get as many devs that get their eureka moment, they get inspired, right? Just get them over that hump and go build something that's kind of like probably not the thing that's going to be the breakout app, but has the ideas, the shape of it. It's time to kind of start iterating.
00:15:31.850 - 00:15:39.210, Speaker C: Is there anything specific that you think you'd like to see built today as we build towards the future you're talking about ten years from now?
00:15:39.360 - 00:16:09.506, Speaker B: Yeah, this is tough. I've done a lot of pacing around a room, drinking coffee, trying to figure out what to build with AI. You and me both. And it's not clear what is this breakout application, right. I think source code, analysis generation unit, testing, that kind of stuff. It's definitely a win and it is already working, but there's already really good companies building those products. So I don't know if I have some extra insight there.
00:16:09.506 - 00:16:49.674, Speaker B: I think with crypto and stuff, some of the stuff we thought of that might be interesting is maybe running them inside a deterministic state machine and actually using LLMs as the smart contract. Not using them to generate them, but create financial prompts. I don't know what this would be used for, but we can build it. It's not that hard. And then it's also again, like, okay, we built the stool, go figure out what to do with it. This is where AI is at right now. Outside of giving developers magic code generation, I think we're still in the stage.
00:16:49.674 - 00:17:03.300, Speaker B: Like, we can build an infra product, but we don't know what the consumer end use case is. That's the hard part about. Yeah, I feel like people should start messing around with it for sure.
00:17:08.150 - 00:17:54.850, Speaker A: I don't know if this is too primitive a thought, but yeah, unleashing an AI with a certain. I mean, not to get into that whole fear mongering AI thing, but I do wonder what it will be like to if an AI can interface with a blockchain, especially for a non developer, and you can literally enter voice commands for what you want it to do. It does seem like a ripe ground for all sorts of things, some kind of scary things to happen or just like, I don't know, I feel like not well informed enough to really make a sophisticated point. But I wonder if you just tell someone if you could program an AI or just literally ask it like, yo, can you try to make a lot of money running around Defi? I don't know.
00:17:54.920 - 00:18:00.038, Speaker B: Yeah, that won't work. That's going to get eaten up really quickly.
00:18:00.204 - 00:18:01.158, Speaker A: You think it will?
00:18:01.244 - 00:18:33.230, Speaker B: Yeah, that kind of alpha, anything that you can automate, like that will be, I mean, there will be people that are doing it and making money with it, but then they're going to be really optimized on latency, on speed, and these are going to be super custom models really quickly and it'll be like a job. It's not going to be a money machine, it'll be a job. And you'll be reducing spreads around the state machine and you'll get paid for the value you're providing.
00:18:34.770 - 00:18:56.120, Speaker A: Right on. Fair enough. All right, we can keep going. We're hitting on helium, which is another, I mean, we cover such a broad scope of the industry that's hard to keep up with everything. But where are you at with helium? They were at the saga event.
00:18:57.470 - 00:19:48.086, Speaker B: Yeah, they just launched kind of their big play, which is the idea that you can use self serve 5G towers to really cut data costs for users. So what's really cool about it is that they can see exactly where there's demand for the data. So people where they're falling back and using T mobile and then they can increase rewards in those areas and then people add helium hotspots there and now they're getting actual users to connect to those hotspots. And you get this very nice, very awesome combination of using crypto for incentives to actually serve an end user. This is like, you rarely see that. Normally the incentives are just rewards that are meaningless in a loop. But here you're like, we know there's demand for this data.
00:19:48.086 - 00:20:11.118, Speaker B: Like, the users are there, they're hitting T mobile, right, instead of helium. So just go set up a hotspot there. You'll make money. Right. That's such a good way to use crypto. That clearly is value creating. It's creating value for the consumers, it's cutting data costs for them and the providers are getting paid.
00:20:11.118 - 00:20:41.542, Speaker B: It's awesome. So if they roll this out nationwide, it would be, I think, I don't know. From my perspective, this is like the biggest, coolest thing that crypto has accomplished in five years. It's literally like taking on federally backed telecoms with massive budget, right? Yeah, it's just a crypto startup with cheesy hardware. Right. That's just like self serve. Put up your own five cell tower.
00:20:41.542 - 00:20:46.074, Speaker B: This would be really cool if they succeed. So I'm rooting for them for sure.
00:20:46.272 - 00:21:24.742, Speaker C: Yeah, it's definitely an interesting ecosystem. And I remember when helium first came out and there were some instances where people were stacking their helium towers. People were gaming it and stuff like that. So they've come a long way I think since those days. And there have been, I think a couple of different iterations of the actual tech stack that they're using for the physical tech and those are sought after now. As a matter of fact, people who have those towers now, I mean if you have one, there's a secondary market for it in terms of that in addition to what you can do with it on helium network. So very interesting.
00:21:24.742 - 00:21:30.600, Speaker C: And if they're able to kind of the David that takes on Goliath there with those networks, we'll see if they succeed, right?
00:21:31.710 - 00:21:45.070, Speaker A: Yeah, that's another old school. I mean, I feel like old school, like a 2017 crypto use case. I feel like coming back when people were saying, yeah, let's take on incumbents through programmable incentives.
00:21:45.570 - 00:22:30.050, Speaker B: Yeah. The other one, if you guys are not aware of is hive mapper. That's really Google street view, right? It seems crazy that Google could map the entire world with full resolution. Is it possible for a bunch of volunteers to do this with crypto economics? They are actually showing that it is. I think there's about 60 million road out there in the world. They have mapped about 8% of it with roughly about 1000 drivers. So everyone that's like a driver that's doing Uber or whatever, Amazon delivery, whatever, if your job is driving, it's very easy for you to put up this camera and start collecting rewards.
00:22:30.050 - 00:23:18.250, Speaker B: And what's really cool is because this is this very decentralized network, their updates are about 200 times faster than Google's. So Google street view cars, they drive around like once in a blue moon, once a month or whatever, or like once a year in some cases. But these are drivers are constantly doing routes, right? They're constantly doing deliveries. They can actually give real time traffic analysis, all this other much more sophisticated signal on top of this map data. So that's really cool. I think that's another one of those. I think it's awesome to have that kind of data set be built by an open network in a transparent way with volunteers effectively being incentivized with crypto economics.
00:23:18.590 - 00:23:28.000, Speaker A: Yeah, man, these are bull market vibes. I wouldn't know that. We're collectively down 90%.
00:23:30.450 - 00:23:58.534, Speaker B: Well, what's cool is that, I don't know. There's enough crazy people that have told me that they think that basically the bottom of the next cycle is the top of the previous one. This is like what I've heard over and over from random people. So that would be pretty cool if that trend continues. I don't know, but it doesn't always work. Like the.com crash took 15 years to recover for tech.
00:23:58.534 - 00:24:22.922, Speaker B: If you actually look at the tech companies, but now look at them, right, these are the biggest companies in the world with the know craziest revenues that are the most sustainable. So that's possible. Know, at least I believe that building technologies in a decentralized way is going to achieve the same kind of value creation. Know Google and Apple. So we should hopefully get there too. But we'll see.
00:24:23.076 - 00:24:34.020, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So we had one comment. Someone said, why aren't you on friend tech like the rest of CT? That's what they want to know.
00:24:36.650 - 00:25:21.646, Speaker B: So I generally think it's really important for people to try to figure out these models where to incentivize creators. And Twitter sucks, right? Like, you post a tweet, there's like a million different bots that reply to you. There's a million different fake accounts, and it's obvious that you can prevent all of that with like, I think that's a given. But can you scale tokens to a large consumer base? And that's kind of the unknown. And I think it's really important that people go try and figure it out and some of the stuff is not going to work out and that's fine. And everyone should just be like, this is a social startup trying to fix a really effing hard problem. Let them give it a shot.
00:25:21.646 - 00:26:19.014, Speaker B: Like, who cares? No one should be thinking of their friend shares as retirement. This is mostly all for fun with that mindset. I think it's pretty cool what they've accomplished and I think some of the ways that they've designed their system is really clever. I think for me, what I've done instead is I posted this tweet that somebody should, I would use the LinkedIn version of Frontech, which is dollar gated email. So if you need a response from me, you can literally send me an email to tolly@solink.com. It's in my Twitter and the server that this guy built in like a couple of days, will respond saying, you got to deposit ten USDC into this tip link. And when you do, then I see the email and then I reply to it within 48 hours and I get the $10.
00:26:19.014 - 00:27:08.674, Speaker B: So I made roughly like $500 doing this. Oh wow. Yeah. And I bought a tensorian with my Solink money. And the benefit that I see is, I think the benefit that people are trying to get out of front group, out of the front tech chats is that I see a much higher signal to noise in those emails because somebody is basically that time that they think is really important. They're valuing it above zero, and that puts them above all the spam. Even if normally, if I were to receive this email for free, because I'm receiving it in the context of massive amount of spam, I would only value it if it's important to me, right? I would only look at it all like, okay, I don't care, I don't care and care, but I don't actually get a signal.
00:27:08.674 - 00:28:12.954, Speaker B: Is this really, really important to the sender in that context? And that's, I think is the difference between Twitter or something like that and crypto economic incentivized networks. So now I know that this person actually really cares about my response and I can take the time and dig into what they're pitching and most of it is founders trying to figure out what the fuck to do, right? Like all of us. And I can give them my best response and people seem to send me back more emails and they're like, hey, what about this? And stuff like that. So I think this is an important business communications channel. I think this is something that's kind of been tried with earn and 21 Co. But I think it's overall, for anyone that's there just doing business comps, it needs outreach. If there's somebody that's doing sales and they really think that the thing they're pitching is really important and they're willing to put $10 on it, I will listen to their pitch, I will take my 1520 minutes, whatever, and actually listen to it.
00:28:12.954 - 00:28:41.186, Speaker B: And generally the people that do that are pretty smart. Even if I don't like the idea, they've at least put effort into it and it's just a much better experience. So I think this stuff's important. It's potentially very scalable. My kind of dumb estimate is that I'm not super special. So imagine there's at least one in 10,000 people like me that would value $10 emails. Right.
00:28:41.186 - 00:29:06.842, Speaker B: That would be valuable enough to send one in 10,000 seems doable. Right. And that's roughly 800,000 people, $1,000 a week. That's a lot of actual revenue. That's like real money all of a sudden. At that scale, I don't know. I think frontech maybe could scale to a large consumer base, maybe not.
00:29:06.842 - 00:29:33.010, Speaker B: But I think people should keep trying. Whatever the negative feedback on the cryptonomics prices dumping and all the stuff people would give, I think they should still continue experimenting. It's like a really important problem with a ton of potential. Yeah, I've been pushing bots and fraud and all this other shit on Twitter sucks. It just sucks.
00:29:33.430 - 00:29:59.386, Speaker A: No, and our email gets slammed. I mean, we need to work out from like a journalistic standpoint what the best way to do to kind of, because Jeremy's raised legitimate concerns about people shouldn't be able to pay for coverage, but also being like, yeah, our inbox gets slammed. And I know people are just copy pasting our media name with the defiant. They're just copy pasting that in. They're sending it to like 20 people.
00:29:59.408 - 00:30:13.746, Speaker B: And I'm like, no, you guys should try this. It's like solink.com. All you need is a salana wallet. What I'm sure you guys have. And it forwards it to your email. It's super simple.
00:30:13.848 - 00:30:14.162, Speaker A: Okay.
00:30:14.216 - 00:30:18.210, Speaker B: It was built by somebody that loves boomer tech, loves emails.
00:30:20.550 - 00:30:22.210, Speaker A: Right on. Sweet.
00:30:22.550 - 00:30:30.680, Speaker B: Let's see what happens. Maybe you guys will get like buy some NFDs with your $10 or whatever. Yeah.
00:30:31.850 - 00:30:40.920, Speaker A: At least get lunch while we see it. You're asking about. We'll move on. He was asking about. DBank has some other.
00:30:42.250 - 00:30:42.914, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:30:42.972 - 00:30:47.610, Speaker A: I think we're running or we got to keep it going. Jeremy, what do we have next?
00:30:47.680 - 00:31:02.480, Speaker C: We're looking at some of the improvements we've seen on Solana's network in terms of stability over the last year. I think we've seen fairly vast improvements. I mean, I know that there was some criticism of downtime, but what's contributed to the more robust network that we see today?
00:31:02.950 - 00:32:08.066, Speaker B: It was like a lot of the work with regards to the fee markets and isolating the hotspots in the state so we can price so separately from everything else. So those localized fee markets with quick basically solved the class of problems that caused all the congestion issues. And for folks that haven't heard me give the spiel and why this is really important is that normal networks or like traditional networks, like Ethereum, they have very simple mempools that price all the transactions basically in a heap. So a validator is going to look at the top and take the most expensive ones, and then execute them in their EVM. And the reason why that works so well is because EVM is basically single threaded. Every smart contract can touch any state that it wants. And the validator, block producer, whatever you want to call them, it's opaque how the system works, right? They don't know if there's hotspots or not, so they basically treat the entire state as a single write lock in a database.
00:32:08.066 - 00:32:44.778, Speaker B: And Solana has a parallel runtime. So we did that work, we made it parallel, and it's really fast. But then we had this congestion problem where we didn't isolate the different hotspots when you're actually picking transactions. So instead of a mempool, we never had a mempool. We had still a queue where you can pick the highest priority or whatever things. And before we even had priority fees, we would just double the fee whenever the runtime would get congested, to the point that half of the capacity would be gone. But that's not sufficient, because you have like an NFT mint.
00:32:44.778 - 00:33:35.706, Speaker B: It's a single transaction that's going to win that mint. But it's such a hot mint that you see people build bots that slam the network with like 100 million transactions. Like, literally, we saw 100 gigabit of traffic, unlike some block producers, which is absurd. That's roughly like 10 million transactions trying to all be first in this mint. So the block producer is looking at this insurmountable amount of data, and all it sees are hot NFT mints, and it can't pick anything else. So what we had to do is build a system where the block producer can limit the amount of traffic and then sort it from a very high level based on what smart contract it's talking to. So, like, stuff that's touching an NFT mint can process in parallel, be processed with stuff that's doing a payment with a DeFi liquidation.
00:33:35.706 - 00:34:04.998, Speaker B: All those three things can run at the same time, because Solana is parallel. But the validator, when it's picking transactions, has to know that, and they have to go look through all the submitted data and find what are the hottest NFT mints that are paying the most. Okay, I'm filled up on those. What's the hottest liquidations? I'm filled up on all of those. What are the hottest payments? I'm filled up on all of those. And then fill up the block that way and kind of in buckets. So this is what makes Solana very unique.
00:34:04.998 - 00:34:53.686, Speaker B: And this is kind of part of our big vision. If Salana couldn't do this, if we couldn't solve this problem, then you should have application specific L2s or app chains, and salon is not going to work. This is literally like a fundamental thing that we had to solve this way. Or the premise of a single global composable execution layer doesn't make any sense because you'll have a single NFT mint make payments expensive. There's just no way that Visa would want to use the Solana mainnet network. They might fork it, right? But if an NFT mint all of a sudden increases the prices for a dinner credit card payment, that would just suck, right? So we had to do this isolation. We had to do it in a way that preserves the single composable state machine.
00:34:53.686 - 00:35:17.358, Speaker B: So put in a lot of work last year. It all basically landed around breakpoint last year. And then you saw it mature and there have been some iterations, but mostly kind of like tweaks and stuff. And it's pretty robust, obviously. Like, I call Solana still beta. And this is because we still have a single client that's running the network. And this is the biggest risk to safety.
00:35:17.358 - 00:35:40.042, Speaker B: You can have a zero day or whatever. You can have just random bugs. They'll suck. It's just a bunch of code written by people. The only way to defend that is when you have a totally separate team, hopefully using separate tools like jump is, or building everything in c. So separate languages, totally separate stacks that implement the same protocol. The probability of the same bug in both is virtually zero.
00:35:40.042 - 00:36:04.810, Speaker B: So this is like me as anyone can actually look at. Take the salana explorer, fork it and not call it beta. Call it whatever. I personally will call it beta until we have a second client with at least 33%, because then I'll be able to sleep at night. I know that the probability of these kind of gotcha bugs has been greatly, greatly diminished.
00:36:04.970 - 00:36:08.642, Speaker C: You mentioned some of those bugs. Is that what took place in February when we saw like.
00:36:08.696 - 00:36:10.686, Speaker B: Yeah, this was like a percent drop.
00:36:10.718 - 00:36:12.222, Speaker C: In average monthly uptime.
00:36:12.366 - 00:37:02.580, Speaker B: Yeah, this was like a random lightning kind of like thing that's been in there for like a couple of years that was triggered by an upgrade. But the upgrade wasn't the cause of it. It wasn't like the bug was in the next version of the code. It was that during the upgrade, it got into this 50 50 state that caused it to diverge. But part of that was we shifted a lot of the engineering resources to really start doing more robust adversarial testing. So basically, since that time, a third of the team is just thinking about how do I break my code, how do I detect bugs early and stuff like that. There's been some stuff that we found, but none of it that has been, I think, could have been exploited yet.
00:37:02.580 - 00:37:16.040, Speaker B: It's hard to do that kind of analysis and stuff to figure out did we find a bug that could have actually been triggered on main net or not? But it's definitely like making every engineer think about this with every line of code that they write.
00:37:16.490 - 00:37:42.160, Speaker A: Right on. Okay, I think I understand that. I want to ask more, but running out of time. So like, FTX collapsed. FTX was a big participant in Solana. I don't know the details, except for some kind of primordial association. It seems like you guys have weathered the storm pretty well.
00:37:42.160 - 00:37:45.840, Speaker A: How has that gone?
00:37:46.850 - 00:38:39.822, Speaker B: So I honestly think that. I think we're getting more love from the Ethereum community because of the collapse. Like, I'm like seeing more folks reach out, like Chris Burneski. The bankless guys are not even shitting up salad all the time, I think was such a polarizing figure, and because of that, it actually turned off a lot of true decentralization diehards, and rightly so. I think he didn't give a shit about any of these things. I think he said things, but internally they're obviously not being ethical in any way. So from my perspective, it was a band aid that got ripped off really fast and it was very painful.
00:38:39.822 - 00:38:47.620, Speaker B: But now I think the ecosystem is healed and growing and a lot of things are actually better off now.
00:38:49.530 - 00:39:05.900, Speaker A: Yeah, we're getting one question, just like, I guess from a DeFi perspective, has there been any, I mean, just because FTX was like, they were just deep in that Defi game, I didn't follow super closely, but just getting.
00:39:07.710 - 00:40:08.074, Speaker B: Because they were able to market make with much larger sizes and stuff like that. Their impact was big in terms of vanity numbers, like TVL or volume or whatever. But if it's just them doing it, it's not even Defi. Who cares? Honestly, if anything, they were probably suppressing really good founders, like the margin five folks or Jerry that built like Phoenix and stuff. We need those small founders to get product market fit and grow in an organic way because this is what's actually going to create the next generation really strong. So like, it sucks that the metrics are down, but who cares? Those are vanity metrics if they're not actually driven by true organic growth. What I see now is that really good devs have taken this as an opportunity and they've built better products and are growing.
00:40:08.074 - 00:40:28.710, Speaker B: So go check out marginfi. They're awesome. They're kicking butt. Like, Gito is doing really well, Phoenix is doing really well. Even the open book rewrite of serum, those guys did a lot of optimizations and made serum that code now called Openbook, much, much faster and better.
00:40:28.860 - 00:40:35.030, Speaker A: Yeah, that sounds good to me. Whatever. Just like sucks.
00:40:35.930 - 00:40:46.246, Speaker B: But I'd rather have small founders that are organically growing and are hustling than this kind of bullshit metrics.
00:40:46.438 - 00:40:58.110, Speaker A: No, totally. Yeah. I mean, what is it? Low float, FTV, that whole thing? Yeah, it just tires me out. I don't know. Yeah. So it's good to move beyond.
00:41:02.390 - 00:41:09.140, Speaker B: That. What sucks is that people associated with Solana, but it's just prevalent across all of.
00:41:11.110 - 00:41:28.262, Speaker A: What? No, I definitely wouldn't. I mean, people are grifting all over the place. No need to target anyone in that sense. All right, well, we're heading. Jeremy, are we going to hit any more questions? I have a couple more, but I don't want know exhaust anyone.
00:41:28.396 - 00:41:40.300, Speaker C: I'm just kind of curious. Know, you mentioned this a few weeks ago when you were talking about the hindrance that L2 frameworks can potentially pose in terms of scalability. Do you still feel that way?
00:41:44.050 - 00:42:19.126, Speaker B: Layer twos, they fix the slow eVM problem. Like, EVM is just not like a super optimized virtual machine. So this is why the Ethereum l one sees a performance boost from just using an l two, because you're not doing EVM execution on the L1 anymore. You're just storing data, and all that execution happens somewhere else. So I think that's a valid optimization. But my argument is that why don't you just use more cores than the L1? It's not like the cores are expensive. They're going to be half price tomorrow.
00:42:19.126 - 00:43:06.230, Speaker B: Literally. It's an exponential curve decline in terms of cost, dollars per core every two years. So this is something that I fundamentally believe is kind of like not a waste of time. But if you build software that naturally scales with hardware, as the hardware improves, you're done. Because every generation that the hardware improves, that difference in optimizations or whatever clever protocol change you made becomes smaller and smaller. That margin of improvement just shrinks and you just don't have to worry about it. Right? So everyone would rather use a single giant state machine that's composable because there's no negatives there.
00:43:06.230 - 00:43:26.990, Speaker B: Like, composability is great. Having atomic composability is really good. You get access to all of Defi in a single transaction. That stuff is awesome. So that's just kind of my view, and I think it's a pretty well grounded engineering view. I think those technologies will work. They'll make Ethereum faster.
00:43:26.990 - 00:44:26.190, Speaker B: Once dank sharding is live, the data availability layer in Ethereum should grow. And in theory it could even be bigger than Solana's. It's possible that Ethereum data availability will be bigger than Solana's, although I think it's hard when you have a bunch of volunteers that are running stuff, it's versus the culture at Solana is like, you have to run a validator in a data center even though people can choose to, not like, we can't force them. It's just culturally Solana, like, Maxis are all about like, no, we're going to max out the hardware now. And I think simply because of that, we'll see much, much cheaper pricing for data on Salana than Ethereum. But Ethereum two design and roadmap is totally fine. It's not going to be as composable because you have this L2s and you got to hop states or use oracles and all this stuff, and that's going to be kind of crufty, but it'll work.
00:44:26.190 - 00:44:33.250, Speaker B: But I think Salana is going to be cheaper and faster and simpler for dabs and more composable.
00:44:34.890 - 00:44:38.578, Speaker A: Yeah, you got it, Jeremy.
00:44:38.674 - 00:44:45.622, Speaker C: Any future plans coming up? Any alpha for our listeners to go.
00:44:45.676 - 00:45:25.826, Speaker B: Join the hyperdrive hackathon? Our hackathons are awesome. This is like the best place for somebody that's thinking about starting a company in crypto to get their feet wet because you meet a lot of. We try to get as many investors that still deploy capital in crypto to all look at all these teams. You get to meet other teams that are forming and a lot of times I've seen folks build something for their first hackathon kind of flops or doesn't work, then they continue iterating and thinking about it. And their second hackathon, they get funding before the hackathon is even over. So this is like a journey that many folks have taken. So go do it.
00:45:25.826 - 00:45:28.786, Speaker B: This is a path to go from zero to one pretty easily.
00:45:28.818 - 00:45:32.840, Speaker C: Is this only for devs or can anyone find a role here?
00:45:33.210 - 00:46:20.020, Speaker B: So actually, teams that are thinking about building startups should be getting their community set up, their Twitter all the stuff you're supposed to do and try to get users interested in your product and do that PMF iteration. So even if you're not a dev, you can jump in and be like, hey, I'll manage your community, or whatever, I'll do your Twitter. Even stuff like that helps. One of our first hires was this guy that jumped into the Salana telegram group when it was like 30 people and just started helping us manage it. Just like, hey, I'm doing this for fun. I also do this for definity or whatever. And then we hired him like two weeks later.
00:46:20.950 - 00:46:22.642, Speaker A: Wait, is that Austin?
00:46:22.786 - 00:46:25.960, Speaker B: No, it's Dominic. I don't know if you ever met him.
00:46:26.490 - 00:46:27.400, Speaker A: I'm not.
00:46:31.470 - 00:46:42.240, Speaker B: You meet those folks early and he's actually been one of our best people. He brings in a ton of interested folks. To the.
00:46:44.450 - 00:47:07.570, Speaker A: Right on closing up, Jeremy, I don't know if you have one or two questions. I'm just curious about neon EVM. That was kind of on my radar for a while. Hard to keep track. What does that mean? Does that mean your aaves can potentially run some kind of solution on Solana using neon?
00:47:10.410 - 00:47:52.386, Speaker B: Yeah, the way Solana is designed is that it uses llvm for the kind of the infrastructure stack to compile software to run on chain. So the neon team, they literally took an implementation of EVM written in rust and compiled it to SVM, the Solana target, and then they had to do a bunch of tweaks to make it work. And now you have effectively an implementation of Ethereum running on Solano so you can deploy smart contracts. I believe it works with truffle and foundry and all the stuff that solidity devs use that I don't know about. So I highly recommend. Go folks, go try to break it. Tell them what to fix and make it better.
00:47:52.568 - 00:47:55.460, Speaker A: Right on. I think that's exciting. Yeah.
00:47:55.910 - 00:48:35.380, Speaker B: But yeah, it's really cool because it really shows that in a single kind of giant execution atomic state machine, it's not an L two. It's literally like run EVM inside Salana, can think of it as like running Java inside Windows, run through the native program. You can talk between Salana native programs and these ones, you got to do some marshalling and stuff, but it's all synchronously atomically composable. And that's, I think, pretty cool. And I think there's always going to be more virtual machines. It's just never going to like. So as developers flavor, the day changes, you can always port those and deploy them and devs can go do.
00:48:35.830 - 00:48:43.106, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Right on. All right. I think I'm out of bullets at this point. Jeremy, you got anything?
00:48:43.288 - 00:48:48.710, Speaker C: I mean, is there anything you'd like to add that we haven't touched on throughout this conversation that we've embarked upon?
00:48:50.730 - 00:49:05.030, Speaker B: Go join the hackathon hyperdrive or go to breakpoint. Those are the two big events. Check out breakpoint or hyperdrive hackathon. So whatever floats your boat.
00:49:07.450 - 00:49:14.590, Speaker A: Right on. All right. Well, thank you, Anatolia. It's. It's been a great 55 minutes, so, yeah, thanks for giving us your time.
00:49:14.660 - 00:49:15.770, Speaker C: A real pleasure.
00:49:15.850 - 00:49:16.142, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:49:16.196 - 00:49:17.070, Speaker B: Thank you, guys.
00:49:17.220 - 00:49:21.130, Speaker A: All right. See you, man. Take care. Bye.
