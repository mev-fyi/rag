00:00:00.250 - 00:00:59.370, Speaker A: Over the weekend, DFI builder and investigator Vasa posted an explainer thread introducing CAS, that is cross asset swap, a generalized oneinch protocollike protocol allowing optimized swaps between any ERC 27 21 and one one five. It's basically a set of contracts that lets you swap any input combination of assets to any output combination of assets in a single transaction in an optimized manner. But before we get into the DEETs, check out Oasis Oasis is the leading privacy enabled layer one blockchain for DeFi. It was founded by Don Song, the award winning professor from Berkeley, and has many key backers such as Andreessen Horowitz, Axel Binance Labs and more. Oasis already has several projects building on its network and partners such as the Cryptosafe alliance with Finance, Chainlink, Balancer Meter and others. If you're interested in building a DFI app, join the Oasis hackathon until April 16. They recently launched a new smart contract environment with full EVM and solidity, tool chain support and gas fees that are 99% lower than Ethereum.
00:00:59.370 - 00:01:20.210, Speaker A: If you have a bigger project to mine, Oasis runs a large grant program with over 1.5 million USD in rose tokens available for funding DFI apps. Visit their website@oasisproteocol.org to learn more. Now back to cas. Cross asset swap has three key features. Number one, the ability to swap any asset across multiple markets in a single transaction.
00:01:20.210 - 00:01:47.994, Speaker A: Number two, it allows single transaction arbitrage transactions across multiple markets. Number three, it allows you to perform NFT ARBs without any initial capital. It's pretty neat stuff, but let's consider the example Vaza provides to see how it works. Imagine this scenario. Let's say you start with two cryptopunks. You sell one cryptopunk on NFTX, get punk tokens, you sell the other crypto punk on NFT 20 and get punk 20 tokens. You swap punk to ETH on sushi swap and swap punk 20 to Mana on Uniswap.
00:01:47.994 - 00:02:19.702, Speaker A: Then you buy cryptokitties for ETH from cryptokitties market and buy land for mana from Decentraland. Finally, you return all the leftover punk and punk 20 as ETH. So basically you chain any number of sell swap buy markets in a single transaction. Vasa will soon release a documentation for interacting with these contracts, and he's highly encouraging users to add more markets and exchanges to cast. And guess what? Anyone who contributes can earn a cut from the trade amount passing through the market and exchange. If you're interested, check the link in the description below for more information. That's it for today.
