00:00:00.250 - 00:01:13.426, Speaker A: This super interesting post by Vitalik, Ethereum co founder and creator. He has a philosophy that he's proposing called defensive acceleration. It's either defensive decentralization or ACC. It's a post on techno optimism. So to give a bit of background, this is in line with what Mark Andreessen posted recently. He had this techno optimism blog post where Mark Andreessen, Sam Altman and a few others, VCs and founders, are of this kind of line of thinking, the techno optimist line of thinking that basically goes like this. It says, technology is a net positive for the world.
00:01:13.426 - 00:01:51.950, Speaker A: We should do everything to advance technology, because the outcomes will greatly outweigh any negatives that might come with technological developments. The counterargument to that is people who say technology can have very negative effects on humans and on development. And so technological developments cannot come at.
00:01:52.020 - 00:01:54.994, Speaker B: Any cost, like, we need to set.
00:01:55.032 - 00:03:21.710, Speaker A: Up guardrails around it. And this becomes more interesting and more relevant given what happened with OpenAI and the ouster of Sam Altman from the company, because apparently Sam Altman is from the techno optimist side, like he wants to push AI to its maximum state, no matter what happens, no matter what the consequences are. This isn't exactly confirmed that apparently, from what's come out of all those discussions, it looks like part of the board, the part of the board that was on the side of making OpenAI a nonprofit foundation, they were kind of more cautious about the development, about the consequences that developing a super intelligent AI could have. And so there was this tension between developing AI to its fullest or being more careful with it. And so initially, it looks like the cautious side had temporarily won out, pushing Sam Altman out. But then, as we all know, he was reinstated.
00:03:22.050 - 00:03:44.660, Speaker B: So, anyways, this whole techno optimism debate has been going on and kind of was further highlighted with this whole issue with OpenAI. It became more relevant. And so it's interesting to see.
00:03:47.850 - 00:03:51.110, Speaker A: What Vitalik's position is on this.
00:03:51.260 - 00:03:59.954, Speaker B: And he stands somewhere in the middle. He is definitely in the middle, but.
00:04:00.092 - 00:04:01.980, Speaker A: More towards the.
00:04:06.270 - 00:05:59.946, Speaker B: Effective acceleration side, the EAAC side, which is what Mark Andreessen adheres to, and maybe Sam Altman, than to the anti EAAC site, but he still advocates for a more careful development of technology, specifically AI. So what Vitalik says is that there is a risk that if AI reaches its full potential, that it overtakes human intelligence and ends up controlling humans, and that this, in the hands of a centralized party or a centralized organization, can be a huge threat to human life. And so as a way to prevent this, or a hedge against this would be to have more decentralized governance structures. And that's obviously where blockchain and crypto come in. So that's why his position on technological advancement and development, he calls it defensive or decentralization acceleration because it's accelerating technological development. But introducing this element of decentralization, which can be a way to defend humans against some super intelligent AI robot that can overtake humanity. So we have a summary here on the post, which is a very long post by Vitalik.
00:05:59.946 - 00:06:04.860, Speaker B: So check it out, or definitely read the post itself, which is super interesting.
