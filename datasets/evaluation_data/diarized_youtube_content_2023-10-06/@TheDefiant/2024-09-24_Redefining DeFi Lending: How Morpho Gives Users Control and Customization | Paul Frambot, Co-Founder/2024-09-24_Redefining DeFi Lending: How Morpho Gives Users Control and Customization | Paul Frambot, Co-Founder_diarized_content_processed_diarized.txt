00:00:05.120 - 00:00:12.689, Speaker A: All right, here we are with Paul Frambeau, co founder and CEO of Morpho Labs. Paul, it's so great to have you on the Defiant podcast.
00:00:12.817 - 00:00:14.257, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you for having me.
00:00:14.361 - 00:00:39.245, Speaker A: So Morpho is a lending protocol. It's been very quickly climbing the ranks to become one of the biggest lending protocols. So if we can just start with you describing in basic terms what Morpho is and what makes it different from other lenders and money markets in Defi.
00:00:39.365 - 00:01:24.765, Speaker B: Sure. So Morpho is a permissionless and decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, meaning that it's more akin to, like, Uniswap than it is to avi, in the sense that users can permissionlessly create ungoverned polls to lend and borrow pretty much like any assets against any kind of collateral. And yeah, and the main component, you know, that is different from other lending platforms, that it externalizes risk management. So from a user perspective, you don't have to essentially invest your money in a fund that is governed by a dao. You essentially choose in what you want to invest. Right. And so we have many different products that have been built on top of Morpho that we call Morpho vaults.
00:01:24.765 - 00:01:48.093, Speaker B: Some of them are run by Daos, Jazz Maker, now Sky. Some of them are much more institutional and are backed by robot assets. And so you kind of get the exposure you want, the risk you want, and the rate you want with the more infrastructure, but all based on one common immutable stack that we've been developing.
00:01:48.189 - 00:01:58.737, Speaker A: Super interesting. We'll get into the details of that. But for now, I also want to learn more about you, if you can get into your background and what led you to founding Morpho.
00:01:58.841 - 00:02:30.469, Speaker B: Of course. So I co founded Morpho almost three years ago now. So back then I was a student in Paris. I'm French. I used to study distributed algorithms and consensus algorithms at university. And this was essentially my way into crypto and blockchains in general. And in my second year, fell into the Defi rabbit hole, and in particular the AAVE and compound protocols.
00:02:30.469 - 00:03:27.127, Speaker B: And what was striking to me is like, the difference between the lending rate and the borrowing rate. So if you went to, you know, the AAVE protocol, you were paid 1% to lend, but you had to pay 3% to borrow. And I was like, why is there such a gap right between the two? And so I started exploring during my studies and came up with a quick algorithm that essentially could match the lender and the borrower in the middle and could essentially get lenders and Borrowers to earn a better. Like lenders would earn 2% and borrowers would pay 2% and that they would be both better off than on aave. And so this was the initial algorithm and the very first product that Morpho released that we called Morpho Optimizer that was optimizing existing lending and borrowing protocol. And so that was in my second year and I raised a first small round of 1 million with nascent and Symantec. And then in my.
00:03:27.127 - 00:04:13.535, Speaker B: I did not drop out at the time, I was like still handling my studies. And in my third year I raised the second round of 20 million with Andreas Norovitz and Variant Co leading the round. So things started to get serious. We hired a bunch of people and to essentially secure and deploy the first protocol that I was talking about. So I finished my studies like a year and a half, two years ago maybe, and we deployed the first version of Morpho, which was in the middle of a defi spur market, like that was like 2023. But despite this, we managed to have a very good growth. Like we were the fastest growing protocol at the time and went to above $1 billion TVL very organically.
00:04:13.535 - 00:04:58.177, Speaker B: And. And essentially the pitch was simple. The product was in every way better than existing lending and borrowing protocols because it was optimizing their interest rates. But after some time building this protocol, we realized that we had one big limit, which was the underlying pool itself. We were built on top of the AAVE pool and on top of the Kanban pool, and we could not outgrow them. And so we did a lot of work thinking through what's a truly very scalable model for defi lending and how can we go beyond what was ever done before. And that led us to Morpher Blue, which is our most important protocol to date.
00:04:58.177 - 00:05:05.345, Speaker B: And it was the one I was describing at the beginning of the podcast, which is this permissionless, decentralized, informative lending protocol.
00:05:05.505 - 00:05:11.805, Speaker A: And does morphoblue also include the rate optimization that you worked on initially?
00:05:12.675 - 00:05:55.577, Speaker B: So no, it's two separate products. You can think of Morpho Optimizer as like a go to market product that enabled us to bootstrap the adoption of Morpho in the name. And it actually grew to I think 1.5 billion at some point. But we knew it was not going to be scalable, so we rethought everything from the ground up, which sounded very weird because we were like the only protocol in 2023 that really came out of the blue and was actually newly Used and had some organic traction. But we still decided to sort of progressively wind down because we could not see any like very big ambitious like long term potential for it, which we could see in morphubu. Right.
00:05:55.577 - 00:06:25.895, Speaker B: And it's already proven like today it can go much, much, much bigger than Morph Optimizer. So today those are two separate products. Morph Optimizer is like kind of an autopilot mode. You know, it runs by itself and it has like decent user base, like few hundred millions. And now we have more for Blue, which has like above a billion dollars deposited into it. That is the most important protocol where we focus all our time and energy.
00:06:26.195 - 00:06:42.463, Speaker A: Okay, makes sense. Now the fact of adding, I guess the main innovation there is that you can permissionlessly create lending and borrowing pools with any kind of collateral.
00:06:42.519 - 00:07:12.811, Speaker B: Right, right. So I guess there are two pieces in here. The first one is now things are permissionless. Right. But this is not just a code library. So you know, one tempting idea for a lending protocol is just let's create a code library that anyone can deploy to create their own landing and borrowing use case. Well, that's great, but there is no value beyond being a toolkit for being an open source code for developers to build on top.
00:07:12.811 - 00:07:55.711, Speaker B: Morpho goes beyond that. The idea is that we want to provide a very flexible development stack for landing protocol builders and for any risk creator that's building on top of Morpho, such as maker, Gauntlet, Stakehouse, et cetera. But we also want them to benefit from the network effects of the system, from the users of the system. So when you come into Morpho and want to build a lending product, right, you can build a very specific one that is tailored to your use case, to your risk, but you're not starting from zero and deploying a new code. There is already liquidity that you can benefit from and you can plug into the existing network. Right. So I give you an example.
00:07:55.711 - 00:08:35.951, Speaker B: For example, Gauntlet has a vault. So Gauntlet is a risk creator. They used to work for aave. Now they've been building on top of Morpho, not as consultants as they used to do for aave, but now as builders that generate their own fees on top of the protocol. So they have a USDC vault, people deposit USDC into it to earn passive and low risk guild. And Gauntlet is going to deposit into the Morpho markets, which are very primitive and hard to use if you're not using Gauntlet, essentially. And so they're depositing into a market with bitcoin as collateral and a market with stescolateral.
00:08:35.951 - 00:08:58.335, Speaker B: Right. So that's one use case. Now, Steakhouse is also building a vault. Right. And their vault is going also to be depositing into the same markets as Gauntlet for a part of it. So what that means is that Gauntlet and Stakehouse are going to share liquidity with one another. And so Stakehouse is not building a completely new lending protocol from scratch.
00:08:58.335 - 00:09:08.607, Speaker B: They're building a new lending protocol that already has liquidity on day one. Right. So it's like the nuance of what Morpho brings.
00:09:08.751 - 00:09:40.971, Speaker A: I see. Okay, so if I understand correctly, that means that whenever people are building new lending and borrowing pools, they will be using the liquidity of assets of pools that other people have already built. If there are assets that, if there are pools with assets that have already been built, then you don't need to start from scratch. You can use the liquidity that's already there.
00:09:41.083 - 00:10:06.295, Speaker B: Exactly right. And the good thing is that you can use liquidity of those markets that are completely ungoverned, completely immutable, that you can literally own. Right. It's not like, you know, depositing into a strategy that's managed by someone else. It's like completely honorless and. Yeah, so, so like builders, end users can own the network that they deposit, essentially.
00:10:06.455 - 00:10:26.309, Speaker A: But don't each vault or owner have their own parameters that they could set? So if they want to set, you know, different rates, for example, how does that work with if you're sharing liquidity with someone else who might have different parameters for their vaults?
00:10:26.397 - 00:10:53.815, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a very good question. So they don't share the same parameters, and so they only share liquidity to the extent that they share risk. So if we take back the Galat and the Steakhouse example, for example, Steakhouse is listing some assets that Gauntlet does not want to see. Right. Like Steakhouse is specializing into real world assets, for example. So they have markets where essentially their US, their USDC of steakhouse, USDC is going to be collateralized by T belt. Right.
00:10:53.815 - 00:11:13.667, Speaker B: In the G vault, which is crypto native, you don't have this. Right. Instead, they're only going to deposit to blue chip crypto assets. Right. So they won't share liquidity with the liquidity of Stakehouse that is deposited into the real world asset vault. They only share liquidity to the extent that they share risk. Right.
00:11:13.811 - 00:11:36.575, Speaker A: So, okay, does that mean that you can only. Okay, you can only share liquidity when the, when the other person shares risk. And that means like that they're not using a type of collateral that you're not okay with or that they are paying this the same, the same rates that you are.
00:11:36.695 - 00:12:04.481, Speaker B: Right. So in a practice example would be that you would only share a part of your liquidity. So Steakhouse would have 100 USDC in their vaults. It would put 50 in real world asset backed things and 50 into crypto backed loans. Right. And gauntlets would only share liquidity with the 50 of stakeouts, not the 50 others. Right.
00:12:04.481 - 00:12:38.207, Speaker B: And so maybe so for the rates, they do share the rate for a given market there is only one market. It's more of a free market approach where you know, like there is a reactive interest rate model that's completely ungoverned and it does not make sense to have like a different rate for given very. A primitive risk profile. But if they diverge on another parameter, then they would have to have separate markets. Right. So the idea is that if you're creating a completely new risk profile or compliance profile that no one you know has used before. Yes.
00:12:38.207 - 00:12:54.161, Speaker B: You'll have to build liquidity from scratch. If the structured product that you're building has, you know, some parts of it that already exist, then you can tap on the liquidity to the extent that your liquidity will be associated to this risk. Right. In some way.
00:12:54.233 - 00:13:43.593, Speaker A: I see. Okay. Okay. So I guess the main risk with this is people using very illiquid tokens that might have, that might be very volatile and you know, cause liquidation concerns or like bad debt in the protocol. So how is that handled? Like how is the risk of having this kind of longer tail of assets included as collateral in the protocol? And yeah, how is that risk handled? And also can it affect, can that risk kind of affect other assets as well?
00:13:43.649 - 00:14:14.107, Speaker B: Right. So the base morpher protocol is isolated. Right. So if G, for example, does not deposit into markets that are associated with, you know, whatever the degen token for example, or doge or like, you know, more volatile assets, they won't get impacted. That's, you know, impossible. Right. So you know, like you, the very good thing with this approach is that you can have vaults that are tailored to, for very, very risk averse people.
00:14:14.107 - 00:14:37.385, Speaker B: You know, we have vaults on morpho that literally exposes you to just bitcoin and eth. Right. That's it. Other vaults that just do T bills and eth. Right. And this is like two collaterals and that's much, much less risky in terms of like market risk than you know, a navy that would expose you to like 20, 20 different assets, right. For example, and.
00:14:37.385 - 00:15:27.751, Speaker B: But if we have the opposite as well, right, we have vaults that are going to expose you to, you know, many different LRTs or new kinds of table coins or governance tokens that where it's unclear, you know, what the risk profile is or like what the risk is behind this. Right. And so this is also possible and usually you have a much higher interest rates. So we've seen for example, like I think that was like five months ago or three months ago. I think RE7 and Gauntlet had a nice vault exposed to LRTS and it was like yielding 20% or something. And it suffered from bad debt, right? Bad debt means in Morpho that the is automatically realized in the vault. So like all lenders are taking the loss at the same time.
00:15:27.751 - 00:16:05.643, Speaker B: And so in that case that was approximately two days of interest. Like so in two days, like all lenders were made wall just by the interest. So it was very tiny. But you know, it's just to give you an example of, you know, how you could have a much higher yield involved, which sometimes, you know, because it's higher yielding, it's more risky and it can take some losses obviously. But I think it's just the challenge for us has really been like breaking out of like the risk free paradigm. Like nothing is really truly risk free. Like there are different flavors of risk and we want to be building a protocol that can accommodate to all of those essentially.
00:16:05.779 - 00:16:13.435, Speaker A: Okay, and the way to do that again is by really segregating the users of each vault.
00:16:13.555 - 00:16:48.603, Speaker B: Right. So essentially you have two components, the markets and the vaults. So the market is the base primitive of Morpho. That's one loan assets, one collateral assets, one oracle and one risk tier. So that would be USDC backed by BTC priced by chainlink with 86% loan to value, for example. That's one market in Morpho, right? And you have multiple of those, you have hundreds and hundreds of those. And then you know, Steakhouse is going to deploy vaults that's going to aggregate all of them into one.
00:16:48.603 - 00:17:21.045, Speaker B: And so it's like a USDC vault. People deposit USDC and this vault is going to deploy into the different markets. But the markets themselves are like uniswap pools, right? They don't contaminate each other. It's like completely immutable, completely ungoverned. And you know, 600 lines of code formally verified that you can't really get much safer at this stage. And it only has the exposure that is hard coded in its parameters. Protocol 20 introduces Sorobond, which is Stellar's cutting edge smart contracts platform.
00:17:21.045 - 00:17:39.425, Speaker B: This creates new surface area for innovation and provides new opportunities for developers to build protocols and products that create access to everyday financial services. So it means a gradual increase in transaction capacity and a chance to fine tune applications and it's the most transformative upgrade to the Stellar network to date. Woohoo.
00:17:40.125 - 00:18:38.815, Speaker A: Another aspect that I wanted to discuss about Morpho that we briefly touched on before the interview is the fact that you are in Europe and I don't know, I was just before this I was seeing some commentary about it. It's kind of underappreciated how many different defi and crypto protocols have actually come out of Europe. I think there's just like this general sense that most of the activity in crypto happens either in the US and Asia and that Europe is kind of like a little bit dead. But maybe that hasn't, you know, maybe that's not really the case. So I wanted to get your sense of, well you're obviously from there. You said you're from Paris I think, or France, but yeah, so. And you decided to stay there and build there.
00:18:38.815 - 00:18:47.451, Speaker A: So yeah, I just wanted to get your insight on know why stay in Europe and what it's been like to build a defi protocol in Europe.
00:18:47.563 - 00:19:45.607, Speaker B: So I guess, you know, first things first is that when I started I was still at university so part of the reason I stayed in Paris and France is that, you know, it was like much more technically convenient for me. But that was obviously not the reason for the long term commitment that we have today was more for, I guess there are a few things in there. Like for example today there was this release like a European report on on EU's competitiveness in tech and innovation compared to like, you know, the U.S. for example. And you know, Europe is essentially accusing regulations and saying hey, this is because we have too much regulation, that's hard for entrepreneurs to build, you know, their things and they love their things, etc. Well, I do think that, you know, it's often overwhelming, you know, to build in Europe because of this. I actually don't think that the main reason, you know, people are, we don't have so many builders in Europe is because of regulations.
00:19:45.607 - 00:20:28.559, Speaker B: But to me it's much more of a culture thing where, you know, people are much more risk averse than in other areas of the world such as the US or even in Asia. And you know, like being a founder is at least in France, from my experience is a pretty low Status thing, you know, when you're at university, etc. It's not, you know, something that is well recognized. At the time I was actually the, in my university I was like the only one doing entrepreneurship. And usually students would wait to have like three masters. Yeah, like, I mean the French way of doing entrepreneurship is like doing a master on entrepreneurship to learn the formal methods on how you're going to do entrepreneurship before taking any risk. Right.
00:20:28.559 - 00:21:05.251, Speaker B: Which is not always the best strategy. So the way I did is like, you know, recruiting my co founders in like top French universities and took me a long time to actually find people that were willing to get into entrepreneurship. So yeah, I think it's mostly a culture thing. To be frank now on the reasons why we decided to stay is like multiple things. So first we have the chance to be quite close with the government in general. So we have good points of contact here and we explain them our situation, what we're trying to achieve with Morpho, what's the long term vision for decentralized finance in general, how that could fit into the French and European landscape. And they were super receptive to that.
00:21:05.251 - 00:21:47.345, Speaker B: And I was not expecting them to be like, I don't want to say friendly, but like, you know, really understanding everything that we were trying to do and truly, you know, trying to find the best solutions for the problems that we had. And I thought that was super different from anything I saw in the US and you know, I'm not a US person. I don't know exactly how, you know, it has been for some builders. But you know, I felt, you know, grateful that we were listened and you know, they were actively, you know, looking for solutions with us on different problems. And so that essentially made us want to stay. And so we have offices in Paris. We have like 30 people in Paris now and.
00:21:47.345 - 00:21:48.493, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:48.589 - 00:21:50.037, Speaker A: Wow. How big is your team?
00:21:50.181 - 00:21:54.525, Speaker B: So we are around 36 now maybe.
00:21:54.685 - 00:21:57.493, Speaker A: Oh, it must be nice to have most people in the same office.
00:21:57.629 - 00:22:26.519, Speaker B: Yeah, it's actually quite good. Like I'm a big fan of in person work. Unfortunately we have still have a lot of people like, you know, scattered around the world. We have a lot of people, you know, in the US and in Europe. But you know, in person experience is like so missed in this space in my perspective that we feel the need of regrouping, you know, at every conferences so often that to me it's just like a testimony that we should have more in person the rest of the time.
00:22:26.687 - 00:22:43.255, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Okay. And then so looking at this, at this very flexible lending and borrowing model that you've built. I'm interested to see what are some of the initial use cases that have emerged.
00:22:43.415 - 00:23:23.267, Speaker B: So I guess, you know, like, we're not going to revamp will on the defi use cases, right? The defi use case cases is very simple. On one end, people want passive USDC and passive and liquid USD and ecl. Okay. We're providing this in the safest possible way. And on the other side, people want crypto leverage. Like they want to borrow USDC with BTC to get more BTC or do the same thing with ease, or they want to leverage eth staking to lever up their yield rate or things like this, or their exposure to staking, essentially. And so we're covering all those traditional use cases.
00:23:23.267 - 00:24:03.393, Speaker B: This is where most of our focus is in our defi growth strategy. Of course, Morpho enables more assets to be listed like lrts and many new stable coins, reward assets, et cetera. So we're very happy to be able to cover those. And that's great. But I guess most of our attention is around the short tail of the use cases, right? For now. Right. I do think that still for at least a year, most of the attention is going to be focused around the six biggest assets that exist in defi.
00:24:03.393 - 00:24:45.865, Speaker B: But that can't be the case forever. If it's the case forever, then lending and defi in general is just disappointing. We're going to have more and more assets on chain, in particular robot assets, and we're going to have more and more big players and builders building on chain. Right. And so we want to be building infrastructure that's good enough for them to use where they can actually own it, where they can actually feel safe and resilient about it, and where they have the flexibility to build the use cases they want with the constraint that they want. Yes. With the risk exposure they want, etc.
00:24:45.865 - 00:25:13.271, Speaker B: Etc. And this we're seeing more and more. And this was not the case like, you know, a year ago even. And like just defi being an attractive place for, you know, fintechs or centralized exchanges or just builders or even like big tradify institutions building, you know, on top of defi primitives or. Or yeah, essentially playing out with a bunch of different use cases in the space.
00:25:13.383 - 00:26:41.045, Speaker A: So this is what I think is really interesting because you have taken a different bet from other lenders, Right. Like, I think ABE and most other successful defi lenders have decided to really focus on this, you know, big handful of assets to provide and to yeah, and just to focus on the use cases that you mentioned, which is, yeah, lending, getting dollar yield or eth yield or getting leverage on kind of the big crypto assets. Yeah, that's pretty, you know, most of what defi is being used for today. But I mean, you've built a new protocol from the ground up to allow for other types of collateral. So yeah, I'd love to hear more about this vision. So right now you're saying even for morpho with these capabilities, most of your TVL I guess is still going to these more like traditional defi use cases. But I'd love to understand more of what your vision looks like for when, you know, if your bet plays out and there is room for many other use cases and many other assets.
00:26:41.045 - 00:26:45.405, Speaker A: What does defi look like when that happens?
00:26:45.825 - 00:27:31.985, Speaker B: Sure, I guess a few things. I guess there is the asset part and there is the distribution part that are all tied with one another but is a bit similar. So I guess, you know, it has to come with real world assets as being the next step. So we had T bills now that are fairly well onboarded. We have more and more, both legal and technical innovations that are, you know, were funded during the defi born market where defi rates were super low and below the treasury rate. So we had a big wave of funding for those projects that finally, you know, are coming to fruition today. And we see a bunch of, you know, real world asset being built.
00:27:31.985 - 00:28:33.119, Speaker B: We actually have a bunch of use cases around real world assets and more for, for example, people that have Treasuries and want to have short term liquidity on it, which is by the way, one of the largest over collateralized lending markets in Tratfi. Like that, the repo market where people get short term liquidity from their securities is like trillions and trillions of dollars every day in traditional finance. So obviously this is much of a big institution thing, not a crypto defi retail trader thing. But you kind of get the idea that we could get there. So in terms of asset classes that we're going to bring, it feels to me that tokenizing securities and things like Treasuries is obviously the next step. And even though, I mean we're not there yet in terms of how easy it is to integrate with each of those, how they can integrate into the broader defi ecosystem. Some of those tokens are permissioned.
00:28:33.119 - 00:29:30.581, Speaker B: Okay, fine. How can they enable 11 swap with USDC very easily for builders to build automated leverage or these kind of things? What I'm saying is there's still a bit of code to be written in order for those basic use cases to work. Well, one use case we have currently that I'm very excited about is a use case with centrifuge and Midas, which is essentially a vault created by Steakhouse and RE7 that is gated by the Coinbase Attestation KYC. Right. So here's the experience. You have a Coinbase account, you have performed the kyc, so, so this annoying thing that everybody performs on Coinbase now becomes an asset because the wallet that you have on Coinbase was directly linked with your KYC through an nft. And this NFT is reused whenever you want to enter a mofo vault that is gated.
00:29:30.581 - 00:30:30.985, Speaker B: Right. Some vaults, for different regulation reasons, you can't enter for permissionlessly, you have to have some kind of proof of having verified somewhere. And using the Coinbase wallet is very straightforward. You can just supply into it and the UX feels like magic to you, you don't have to care about how it's done. And essentially you can deposit into the vaults and behind the scenes, since you have the real world assets of centrifuge where those real world asset holders, they can borrow USDC at this stage, I would say it's more experimentations than things that can actually truly scale. In order for those things to scale even further, we need a different scale of adoption from institutions, right? Because as I mentioned, the players, you know, borrowing short term liquidity on securities and this kind of things are, you know, mostly banks, right. And, and they're not like the usual defi user.
00:30:30.985 - 00:31:35.347, Speaker B: And so there's still a big gap, to be frank, for those institutions to come. Right. So I'm, I don't think in the near term this is going to happen. However, what's going to happen in my opinion in the shorter term is the involvement of fintechs and centralized exchanges because there are much more nimble institutions that do have lighter compliance requirements and have a much better tech understanding. And if you look at fintechs for example, they have been building wallets and account attraction features or Layer two partnerships for the last two years have been doing all that. So they have huge crypto teams and they're essentially ready to plug into DeFi. And this is where we get, in my opinion, the real next wave of adoption is going to come from this in the medium term, then long term will go back to more traditional instances, but it has to come with fintechs first, in my opinion.
00:31:35.491 - 00:31:58.175, Speaker A: That kind of leads me to your recent funding Round which congrats. I saw you announced a 50 million round led by Ribbit, huge VC who's traditionally focused on Fintech. So wondering how this fits into your strategy.
00:31:58.595 - 00:33:17.387, Speaker B: When we started raising like you know, a few, few months ago, we had many different lead offers from you know, the top, essentially all the best, like crypto native VCs. And Ribit truly stood out being like the partner that could bring morphos adoption to the next level. Like so just a little bit of context in Ribbit because they're not so famous in the, the crypto Twitter space. And just even for traditional entrepreneurs, I don't think they even have a Twitter account. They like to be their self, but they're the biggest fintech investors in the world. They've done the seed rounds of things like Robin Hood for example. They've invested in Revolut, they've done the seed of Coinbase and many, many others and really was super impressed by not only how they understood like the Defi space in general that they've been following closely, like they invested in Uniswap, for example, in Arbitrary, et cetera, but also by their vision on how Ethereum, and not just Ethereum, but like decentralized like infrastructure could act as the back ends of those financial institutions.
00:33:17.387 - 00:34:34.603, Speaker B: Like sorry, those fintechs, essentially the, the framework is that I have is really the following is that usually you have, you know, businesses have two things. They have manufacturer and distribution. Like car manufacturers have distribution channels, right? Fintechs, they don't really have this, they just have distribution but they don't manufacture themselves, right? They, they have to rely on Fidelity ETF in order to distribute yield to their users, for example. And really decentralized finance is a chance for them to own their manufacturer without to do anything. They essentially with those crypto wallets that they have built in, not, you know, just to have a wallet experience to the user, the user does not get to see anything of that, but just in their backend they're able to plug into like defi L2s into protocols that are resilient enough, flexible enough for them to have like whatever requirements that they need to have and efficient enough to you know, be competitive with traditional finance. And they can finally provide this to their users. And finally they're in a position where they accumulate like the, all the distribution and all the order flow and they take it away from traditional finance and put it into defi, right? And becoming the owner of their own like financial services, which is obviously a kind of an end game for them.
00:34:34.603 - 00:34:40.029, Speaker B: To be frank. So yeah, I'm super, super excited about this.
00:34:40.147 - 00:34:49.569, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I also thought that this union of fintech and DEFI just makes so much sense.
00:34:49.737 - 00:34:50.805, Speaker B: 100%.
00:34:51.105 - 00:35:12.547, Speaker A: So what does this look like for both DEFI and for the end consumer? If this kind of merge of two worlds happens, how will it impact current DEFI protocols? And, and what do new financial services with Defi Rails look like for the end user?
00:35:12.651 - 00:36:27.087, Speaker B: Hopefully it does not look any different for the end user except that they get better prices and the adoption and the quality of their services is going to be overall better but it should be hidden. They should be incrementally better pricing just because now they're built, you know, public good infrastructure like a financial infrastructure instead of you know, privately owned infrastructure that is, you know, less competitive, et cetera, et cetera. It's more resilient, it's more efficient. Right, but, but those things the user wants feel immediately except that they get a better deal out of it. Right. And the other thing is that you know, it will be overall more accessible and you know, much easier for fintech developers to essentially plug in into those resilient like financial infrastructures. But I think if you look at like 7702 and like 4457 like the recent account abstraction EAPs plus like L2S, we're getting to a stage where fintechs, if they have built account abstraction and they pay for gas, users should not feel like it's crypto.
00:36:27.087 - 00:37:10.469, Speaker B: They just have the biometric, you know, signing but they don't even know it's they're signing something. They're just like authenticating like, like they already are on their fintech apps. Right. So I'd say it won't change much. There are arguments to say yes, we'll, you know, demo, you know, democratize and have more opportunities. I do think that's, you know, going to be the case eventually that's going to come in my opinion slightly after and I think the huge win is for the intermediaries so the fintech in the first place just because they remove one intermediary from the stack, which is the traditional finance institution. But hopefully the user does not get to see much of that.
00:37:10.597 - 00:37:31.869, Speaker A: I mean two follow up questions. One is what about different products? Do you think you know, DEFI will unlock new set of products for end users? And also I had asked before or how does that impact DEFI itself? Just like more liquidity I guess, like a huge jump in number of users.
00:37:31.957 - 00:37:58.595, Speaker B: Yes. So in terms of new use cases. It's not so straightforward to me. What are the set of use cases that fundamentally could not be done off chain, that now can be done on chain. It's just that when you do it on chain it unlocks so much more composability, efficiency, openness, resiliency, et cetera. But it's not like a new, brand new product that you could get out of it. Of course it's going to enhance distribution.
00:37:58.595 - 00:39:16.151, Speaker B: There are many areas in the world where like, you know, our, the financial infrastructures are not even there or if they exist, they're very hard to access or very poor. And so in this case it's going to democratize accessibility and those, those people are going to benefit from, from new products because they didn't have the previous ones. But I can think of a fundamentally completely new product that could not have existed in traditional finance. It's just going to be much easier to build any of those on defi. So that's for the first question, for the second question. I think overall the huge advantage of building on top of a neutral, permissionless, censorship resistant medium that is something like Ethereum is, is that it can aggregate so much of the network effects of all the financial world. So what I mean is that currently the financial infrastructures, the traditional financial infrastructures are incredibly fragmented, especially for, you know, niche use cases like, you know, they settle each of them, each use case settles differently and there is not a good mapping of, you know, the consumer and the producer.
00:39:16.151 - 00:40:18.495, Speaker B: So in the case of, you know, lending there is people that, you know, have a need for financing and some other people that have a need to, you know, that have an excess of capital and want to generate interest. And so how do you make the protocol, the general protocol that's going to establish the best possible matching between those two parties? Right. If you have scattered like fragmented infrastructure, that's an impossible problem to solve. Right. So, and so the more efficiency, the more satisfied users is only achieved if you have one common settlement layer which would be the blockchain essentially. And so that's very, you know, basic stuff about blockchain, but I truly think that this is where the superpower lies, is that defi is going to get more liquidity which is going to make the world system more efficient. And there is at some point some kind of, you know, inflection points where we get to snowball, right? And you know, our network effects allow us to unlock drastically more efficiency than even the largest institutions because the sum of all the liquidity in defi is bigger than the one in the biggest institution in the traditional world.
00:40:18.495 - 00:41:16.941, Speaker B: And this is where it should all go by itself. And we should be able to take over all the financial infrastructure, make them public goods, and essentially operate finance as the Internet, where the financial protocols are essentially like Internet protocols today, like HTTP or smtp, where you could imagine that, you know, for Dexs it's unitop and for lending it's more full and you don't really have two of them. It's just like very unopinionated, primitive, resilient protocols that everybody uses without knowing essentially. So yeah, that's a bit far fetched, but that's really how I think about it long term. And that would be invaluable compared to what you can do today with a centralized institution that can't because of antitrust laws and everything. It won't be able to grow and it won't be able to aggregate as much opportunities as a decentralized protocol will be able to. Hey everyone, I'm Miljac and I'm inviting everyone to Bangkok November 9 to 11.
00:41:16.941 - 00:41:44.225, Speaker B: You've been duped into thinking anything decentralized was ever going to work. There's a better way. Stop wasting your time with all this blockchain and go back to the norm, get a latte and stop trying to change the world. Oh, and this thing in November, redacted the hackathon. They're cushy office jobs out there. You know, everything is working as it should for our special event, redacted. We're going to dive into AI.
00:41:44.225 - 00:41:50.565, Speaker B: We're going to dive into web, three chain abstraction, decentralization and user owner AI. I'll see you there.
00:41:54.225 - 00:42:18.927, Speaker A: So I, I read your statement that you want Morpho to become or. Yeah, that Morpho's mission is to make financial infrastructure a public good. So I guess like this is what you're referring to, right? Like you want Morpho to become just like the underlying lending protocol for all of finance is what I'm hearing.
00:42:18.991 - 00:43:00.431, Speaker B: Exactly. So I think of it as like really the Internet protocol that's going to achieve the most efficient matching between people that want to generate interest and people that have a need of financing essentially and say 10 years from now or 20 years from now. Anyone that expresses a need for, you know, in each of those sites would be mapped at the end of the day through more for obviously you have different layers of abstractions, you know, like a risk manager or you know, a bank or whatever. Like that abstracts it away from you or an AI Whatever. But at the end of the day, the matching and the settlement will happen through Morpho.
00:43:00.503 - 00:43:45.849, Speaker A: So right now amorpho is earning 4 million in fees in the past 30 days. And that's the second biggest lending protocol in terms of fees after aave. I mean you're kind of matched with Venus, but you're still far away from AAVE, which has earned 24 million in the past 30 days. Is your path to earning continue to earn market share in the lending space in Defi. What you mentioned before, kind of going to Fintech, like becoming the backbone of fintechs, like, is that what you view will be kind of what makes Defi take the next big leap?
00:43:45.937 - 00:44:19.495, Speaker B: Right. So I guess first thing is like Morpho is like, people, especially aave like to compare AAVE with Morpho. Right? But there are fundamentally two different things. Like AAVE is a bank and Morpho is an infrastructure for people to build their own bank essentially. And really like the end game is very different because of this. Yes, AVI has been here for eight years, we've only been for free and morpho is like 6 months old, like the latest protocol. So of course we represent only, you know, like whatever 20% of what they are today.
00:44:19.495 - 00:45:02.889, Speaker B: But really for us, like we always try to think like long term about like our strategy and don't try to focus on like what's short term because when you look into the short term, you start paying, you know, playing the incentive game and you know, like for example, Avia has I think 20 million incentive program, essentially paying more for users to migrate over to aave. Right. And essentially incentivizing their users. Right. So you know, we're not playing this kind of game, right. We're not interested in like mercenary short term capital. We're looking to build sustainable use cases that can, you know, actually go beyond what has been, has been possible today in Defi.
00:45:02.889 - 00:45:22.987, Speaker B: And, and this goes notably through fintechs. But that's not the only area we're interested in. Diversification of assets and essentially providing safer, more efficient and more permissive protocols is really the guideline to get there.
00:45:23.091 - 00:45:28.815, Speaker A: How does it feel when one of the biggest Defi protocols just directly comes after your users?
00:45:29.155 - 00:46:01.773, Speaker B: I guess we were flattered when the post came out. Know they were like, you know, they're taking this so seriously that they're feeling the need to like spend millions and millions to do it. But, but frankly, as I said, we don't really strategize too much about it in the sense that we don't, we don't care so much. You know, we understand that, you know, they're trying to play the monopolistic game and, and pay, like all our users, you know, more or less officially through the dao. So it's. By the way, the algorithm is not this close to the dao. So, like, the dao, you know, votes.
00:46:01.773 - 00:46:30.899, Speaker B: Yes, but no one knows where the money goes. Right. Because the algorithm is completely off chain and no one challenges it somehow. But that's how it is, I guess. Yeah, we don't care that much, to be frank. Internally, we're just so in our lane of our mission and trying to push the things further. We're not really focused on what AAVE is doing that much, but apparently they are because they just released new AAVE pools, things that I believe they were not planning to do initially, but.
00:46:30.899 - 00:46:39.403, Speaker B: But now they're trying to have, like, different risk profiles and trying to essentially cover the things that, that, that Morpho is covering and that they could not.
00:46:39.499 - 00:46:43.379, Speaker A: Well, that's, you know, what competition does, keeps everyone on their feet. Right.
00:46:43.427 - 00:47:01.471, Speaker B: Yeah. And that's so healthy, by the way. And I also believe that's one of the reason we're going to go after Tri so so fast, is that everything is so open that, you know, the urge to compete is so big that it's. Yeah, it's just such a fascinating environment.
00:47:01.623 - 00:47:26.585, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. And then just to start wrapping up, I do want to touch on your upcoming token. So what does that look like? Like, what are your tokenomics? What's the timeline for? Is it an airdrop or like I saw you were calling it something. Something different that I can't recall right now. It wasn't like tge, but, yeah, if you can go over that.
00:47:26.745 - 00:48:18.739, Speaker B: Yeah, I can share about the token. So essentially, the Morpho protocol has a token, and it has been live for a while now, maybe a year and a half. But the fact is that it's not transferable. So users can acquire it by using the protocol, but they receive it in their wallet, but then it can't be transferred. So that's interesting because we were able to, with the Morphodao, to decide on incentivizing behaviors that help bootstrap the protocol, but without having to have only mercenary capital or users coming. We only had users that truly believed about the protocol that were willing to, to use it. And I really turn into a strong community like the Morpho communities.
00:48:18.739 - 00:49:17.375, Speaker B: I'm really a big fan of the community of Morpho Token orders right now and users that are very thoughtful about the protocol and providing very valuable feedback. And they're not like the liquidity farmers that go from protocol to another, etc. But after two years we feel like we've made enough progress to essentially open ownership to, to the public so that anyone can own a share of the network. And so we have posted this proposal that essentially opens up transferability for debates and it's been well received so far. And essentially the process would be to go through votes and people can actually already vote because they have the token, so they can vote with it, vote to activate transferability. Right. And so once this is done, the token will be freely tradable and they will be able to essentially, you know, buy or sell it on public markets, essentially.
00:49:18.275 - 00:49:21.027, Speaker A: And what will the use of the token be?
00:49:21.131 - 00:50:20.125, Speaker B: We think about tokens fairly differently from many defi founders that we've seen and worked and talked with. Like somehow, you know, founders all want their, their token to be used for offensive thing, to make sure that, you know, people want to be holding the token, etc. In our case, it's extremely simple. Like the, the morpho token is the governance token of Morpho. There is no fancy mechanism, there is a fee switch in the protocol where essentially the protocol creates value in a decentralized way by simply having like lenders and borrowers bidding at 1, at the protocol level. So like, essentially this is decentralized value creation because like there are network effects that are created and the protocol is able to charge a share of that value that potentially could be redistributed to more protocols. Right.
00:50:20.125 - 00:51:06.311, Speaker B: And yeah, and so to me, that's the simplest and healthiest way of building like a token and funding a public good development, like what we have with Morpho. But we're not, at least to this day, we haven't very fancy mechanism in mind where you sort of do whatever with the token. It has to be useful. And in most cases, when you look into fancy tokenomics proposal, ETH is a better fit to perform the use case than the native token of the project. Right. So for example, if you want like shared security or this kind of things is always like the best choice. And we really want to make sure like we do things that make sense.
00:51:06.311 - 00:51:31.291, Speaker B: Right. Even if you think about risk management in aave, it's not clear that token orders should be the one in charge of risk management. Like token orders are not risk experts. They're not, you know, experts are not active, so why should they do risk management that to me does not make much sense. So we decided in Morpho that it should not be in the hand hands of token orders, which should be a completely open marketplace. Right. And to us it's even more decentralized, to be frank.
00:51:31.291 - 00:51:52.435, Speaker B: So we think of tokens more as a decentralized forest that really acts as very decentralized, multisig to perform admin actions in the protocol that include turning on the fee switch, managing the treasury, et cetera, et cetera. So very similar to Uniswap, to be frank. It's further aligned with Uniswap on that regard.
00:51:52.515 - 00:52:02.781, Speaker A: Okay, and then right now the fees go to people depositing in the vault.
00:52:02.893 - 00:52:13.293, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. So like all fees are exchanged between users. Like there is no fee switch being activated by the protocol at the moment. Like Unisoft, by the way.
00:52:13.429 - 00:52:52.293, Speaker A: Okay, right, okay, super interesting. And then yeah, to, to kind of wrap up, I'd love to hear just like your more general take on Defi, where you think it's going in the next few months. What are some of the most interesting trends you're seeing. We talked about your very long term vision of it, but just looking at what's happening now, what's interesting or maybe what you hope to see happen in the more near term.
00:52:52.429 - 00:53:56.863, Speaker B: I believe the Ethereum roadmap is going to have a huge impact on how we build and use Defi. The fact that Ethereum is turning L2 centric, the fact that Ethereum is next hard fork is going to include 7702 or these kind of things. This is going to be the biggest change we're going to see in the next year in my opinion are like the two things that I mentioned in my opinion. Now in terms of adoption, I believe we've come to a point where distribution platform outside of Defi have become ready to integrate Defi and we should see some of that as well. But in my opinion, we probably won't see adoption from traditional finance institution, at least not using traditional Defi protocols. Maybe they will have their own in the next year or two. I could be wrong.
00:53:56.863 - 00:53:59.631, Speaker B: I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think that's the case.
00:53:59.743 - 00:54:24.251, Speaker A: Cool. Okay. So Ethereum updates should improve usability for Defi, make it faster, cheaper, abstracting some of the nuances of using Defi. And maybe we'll see some. Maybe fintechs adopting Defi and increasing distribution and adoption that way.
00:54:24.323 - 00:54:24.723, Speaker B: Yes.
00:54:24.819 - 00:54:38.941, Speaker A: All right, nice. Well Paul, thank you so much for taking the time. Super interesting conversation. Yeah, love to see what you're doing. And yeah, we'll continue covering morpho on the defined. Thanks again for joining.
00:54:39.053 - 00:54:40.365, Speaker B: Thank you very much. Thanks for having me.
