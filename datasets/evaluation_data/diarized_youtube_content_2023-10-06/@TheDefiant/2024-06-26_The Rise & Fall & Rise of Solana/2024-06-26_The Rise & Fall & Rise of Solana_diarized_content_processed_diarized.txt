00:00:03.360 - 00:00:17.490, Speaker A: The blockchain realm. It's hard hitting, relentless, doing nothing offensively and unforgiving.
00:00:18.190 - 00:00:19.574, Speaker B: I told you Savaries was going to.
00:00:19.582 - 00:00:21.078, Speaker C: Underestimate his speed and his power.
00:00:21.214 - 00:00:27.090, Speaker A: Only the toughest make it out alive. Many have risen to temporary stardom.
00:00:29.110 - 00:00:29.518, Speaker D: But.
00:00:29.574 - 00:00:31.998, Speaker A: Most will not hear the final Bella.
00:00:32.044 - 00:00:37.150, Speaker C: From nothing and go back to nothing. And that's exactly where I want to be. Is it a Ponzi?
00:00:37.530 - 00:00:39.230, Speaker E: Well, I guess.
00:00:47.170 - 00:01:37.080, Speaker A: Although every champion was once a contender who refused to give up. And this story isn't about failures or false prophets. It's about Solana. Today, we're uncovering the untold elements of Solana's comeback. A blockchain that battled endless adversities to redefine its own destiny. From an ambitious launch and meteoric rise to overcoming nearly catastrophic setbacks, this tale of innovation, endurance and rebirth is arguably unique. But what exactly was it that allowed Solana to survive against all odds, to cement itself as one of the leading layer one blockchains today? In other words, what can we learn about the ups and downs of Solanas journey, which had ultimately shaped the industrys future? Stay tuned, because this story is just getting started.
00:01:37.080 - 00:02:21.004, Speaker A: Solanas story stands out for a number of reasons. Led by not one, but two technical founders in Anatolia Yakovenko and Raj Gokal, Solana set out with a bold vision in 2017 to challenge centralized financial systems. The early use case for Anatoly was simple, to create scalable and efficient blockchain networks that can handle a high volume of transaction without being constrained by blockspace, unlike bitcoin and ethereum. And as the blockchain space evolved over the next few years, so too did Solana, eventually expanding to encompass defi nfts and payments.
00:02:21.132 - 00:02:32.704, Speaker D: And I literally had like two coffees at Cafe Soleil in San Francisco and a beer. I was up to like four in the morning and had this eureka moment that there's a way to encode passage of time as a data structure.
00:02:32.832 - 00:03:12.060, Speaker A: Following the mainnet launch all the way back in March 2020, Solana successfully leveraged its unique proof of history consensus mechanism alongside proof of stake. This unique hybrid technology aimed to solve the scalability issues that had plagued other blockchains at the time. It even earned Solana the nickname of ETH Killer and sent the sol token soaring to $250. But before we uncover Solana's trials and tribulations following that explosive growth period, we have to understand what attracted so many people to Solana in the early days. Was it the founders? The tech, the vision? Or perhaps it was the community let's find out.
00:03:15.680 - 00:03:36.408, Speaker C: When it came to market in 2019 or 2020. The all l one thesis was super weak because the prior cycle, when ETH did okay with the icos, all the all l one s that were like zero, there was nothing that really got built on them. So there was no proof that, like, an l one could be able to compete with ETh long term. And that's when Solana came out.
00:03:36.464 - 00:04:05.138, Speaker D: Early February 2021, early kind of days. There wasn't a proliferation of all of these different l one S and l two s, which actually have liquidity in a bunch of different wrapped coins. The only thing that did work back then was this little project called Solana at the time, which seemed to have got the backing of this exchange called FTX. And they had a lot of the wrapped tokens, and it was fast and cheap, and you could just transact. So that's why we started. That's why we started on Solana. Fast, cheap.
00:04:05.138 - 00:04:13.506, Speaker D: You could build smart contracts. The UX was still not amazing back then, but it had potential, and it seemed like there was a lot of people trying to make it a thing.
00:04:13.578 - 00:04:34.502, Speaker C: So Solana did a really good job of establishing community early on. Like, that whole run up from what was like a dollar 50 to like 260, whatever it was in that time period. They did a great job of onboarding developers to the ecosystem, like onboarding people through communities, nfts and everything else. Building that online presence, building that in person presence.
00:04:34.646 - 00:04:51.920, Speaker E: I think, first and foremost, from the technology perspective, it's the scalability. Back at the time, in 2020, Solana was talking a lot about 65,000 tps, low latency, sub second finality, all things that are really important if you want to run a real time game on chain.
00:04:52.030 - 00:04:52.204, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:52.212 - 00:05:26.970, Speaker E: I mean, proof of history is really the unique underlying consensus algorithm for Solana. It's a way of establishing a unified time stamp, a universal time system for all of the activity, transactions and instructions that are going on across Solana. So it allows for the scalability of paralyzed transactions across the entire network. And this is, these parallel systems are what allows for that high transaction throughput and low latency that Solana has brought to the world.
00:05:27.750 - 00:05:39.358, Speaker A: Going back again to the early days, the term ETH killer used to be thrown around quite a bit, maybe a bit too willy nilly. Do you feel that Solana still has that title of being an ETH killer? Do they need that title?
00:05:39.494 - 00:05:58.356, Speaker C: No, I don't think Solana is an ETH killer. I honestly think they're trying to do two very different things. It's not even really a good comparison, because what Solana is trying to do is be like an integrated l one, which is like execution, consensus, settlement, all happen on Solana on the l one, whereas Ethereum is really pushing all the execution off to these l two s and these roll ups.
00:05:58.388 - 00:06:24.340, Speaker D: The way that you scale then in Solana land is then down to the hardware. So, yes, running a node I can't go and do on my raspberry PI or something like that, whereas you can on other chains, and that's fine. But I think the scale and the way that Solana is trying to grow necessitates, okay, you need a very powerful computer and node to be able to do stuff, because it's doing a lot of complex stuff. That's why, you know, complex things require complex solutions.
00:06:24.500 - 00:06:51.720, Speaker B: I think if you had to bet on somebody beating Eve, I think Solana is kind of like at the front runner, the number one spot. If you were to say that Solana's already beaten Eve, I think that's not the case yet in terms of market care, volume, TVL and so on. But maybe in the next cycle, who knows what's going to happen? I think Ethereum's got a lot of catch up to do and got to try to innovate and be competitive.
00:06:51.800 - 00:07:19.320, Speaker D: Ethereum in terms of capacity, is nowhere near Solana and where it's at and what's happening on Solana and all of the. Yes, you can look at TPS metrics, you can say, oh, there's thousands of transactions per second on Solana versus 15 on Ethereum. That's maybe one way to look at it, but I think it's all more about sort of mind share and interest. And right now, mindshare is very high on Solana, and that's because it's very easy to use. So, Eth killer, the battle's kind of already won.
00:07:22.060 - 00:07:48.440, Speaker A: As Solana's developer base grew, so too did the community and user count, which exacerbated stability challenges. A series of consecutive network outages led to other layer one communities criticizing Solana for being a centralized vc chain, essentially with an on and off switch, which naturally stood against the core principles of decentralization. Tribalism, it seemed, was festering within the layer one space. So how did Solana overcome these challenges?
00:07:48.600 - 00:08:16.530, Speaker E: We just kept building. We didn't have issues with the tech outside of the occasional network haltage or some instability recently, which I think was inspiring to see the community and builders collectively come together and look for solutions. It wasn't relying exclusively on Solana Labs or, you know, maybe the foundation to solve the problems. It was, hey, we all believe in the tech. We all know that we can pull through this. What do we need to do to figure this out?
00:08:16.610 - 00:08:50.102, Speaker C: In 2022, there was a period when the chain was literally unusable for people, and they had to fix a ton of that to make sure people would be able to use the chain moving forward. And that took a lot of time. But I think, like, only, like, a few months, I think during 2022 is when they got all those fixes through. And then when 23 came around, people were still in their heads thinking, Solana's work. But they're more paying attention to all the dev updates that have been and all the work that have been done behind the scenes and still, like, the speed of innovation is crazy. Like, whenever something happens, they're on it very fast.
00:08:50.206 - 00:09:19.176, Speaker F: You can compare Solana's liveness failure, which is going down to Ethereum, being unaffordable for 99.999% of the population when it's congested. Right? So you have Solana, which you can't use it at all, and you have Ethereum, which, to send a transaction, it costs you $150. And obviously, they aren't the same, and this one is probably worse, you would say, but they're not far off. And it's happened on salon a few times. It's happened one time in the last year. Yeah.
00:09:19.288 - 00:09:31.008, Speaker D: Breaking news in New York, where, in the last few minutes, Sam Bankman freed has been sentenced to 25 years for what's been called one of the biggest financial crimes in us history. These are the live pictures from outside.
00:09:31.064 - 00:09:48.160, Speaker G: He was the founder of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. When customers went to withdraw their funds in November 2022, the funds were not there. When a jury found that that money had been moved to a hedge fund, an investment fund called Alameda Research, and that Sam Bankman fried used that money to enrich himself in his inner circle.
00:09:57.260 - 00:10:02.720, Speaker A: What do you think the impact of FTX collapsing was on Solana? And how did the community respond?
00:10:03.180 - 00:10:18.416, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, publicly, it has a huge impact. Like, everybody associated SBF as a scammer. FTX was the worst, and he was the biggest proponent of Solana that entire last cycle. Like, okay, Solana is a scam. That was just the connection that people made.
00:10:18.528 - 00:10:45.184, Speaker E: I think that it's the nature of probably people in general, but especially emphasized in crypto, this tribalism. And so if you were not a fan of Solana to start with, you know, this is a weak point that you can attack in a moment of weakness. So, yes, people were more outspoken. They felt justified in saying that Solana was a scam or Solana will fail or what have you.
00:10:45.232 - 00:11:00.756, Speaker D: We had not only the bear market of number goes down, then we had FTX, then we had all of these other ones, blockfi and all of these other lenders blowing up, and then we had do Kwon and Luna. It would just hit after hit. And a lot of that affected Solana really, really poorly.
00:11:00.828 - 00:11:07.720, Speaker F: For me, it's always been an image thing. The tech was always good. The image was the issue, and the image was massively hit by SPF and FTX.
00:11:09.100 - 00:11:16.892, Speaker E: You know, I don't want to place judgment, but we did see teams leave Solana, move to other networks.
00:11:16.956 - 00:11:40.296, Speaker D: So if we were to look at it objectively and say, how much impact does Alameda have? The answer is not that much. The reality of the effect was exaggerated, perhaps by social media or anything like that. Why? Hey, Sol went to $8, but a lot of us in the slana ecosystem were looking around and, like, actually, everything works fine. It's the same as it always has been. You know, we're not beholden to anyone, so. But I think it was a perception problem.
00:11:40.368 - 00:12:16.992, Speaker H: You know, obviously, that was incredibly tragic, the entire situation. But I think at the end of the day, it's necessary for us to go through those things. It's a very big growing pain, but I think it's a necessary one because it moves us. It continues to move us closer to legitimacy. You know, the fact that the government has been forced to come in and, like, truly familiarize themselves with what actually, like, what is actually web3, I think, is only going to benefit all of us in the long run.
00:12:17.176 - 00:12:37.990, Speaker E: We maintain our conviction. We doubled down on Solana. We kept building on Solana. But sure, the criticisms are there. The network instability recently and network stoppages in the past, we understand this is new technology. We're working at the bleeding edge in everything that we do. And so for us, this isn't uncomfortable, it's just part of operations.
00:12:38.110 - 00:13:02.808, Speaker I: The biggest thing that could kill Solana was eliminated back then. So in short run, like FTX, yes, it was painful. In the long run, I think it's super positive that something like that happened, and it happened back then already, and, like, it was not delayed until now, because once again, it made the community much more stronger and the network again, ownership as a whole. So I think Solana came out quite strong out of it.
00:13:02.944 - 00:13:32.100, Speaker H: Forests can't grow properly without forest fires. Right. They're terrible. They're tragic, but they're necessary. And I think, you know, while I would not say, like, the way that the FTX situation happened, you know, like, the how of it was not necessary. But these are the types of things that, you know, it's like, could we, like, would it be nice if we could go, if we could grow without these kinds of growing pains? Absolutely. But, you know, they're called growing pains for a reason, right.
00:13:34.880 - 00:13:47.400, Speaker A: Despite the endless stream of tweets, headlines, and fud arguing that Solana would never survive the FDX collapse, the Solana ecosystem was hard at work behind the scenes. But what exactly was the comeback strategy?
00:13:47.520 - 00:14:13.306, Speaker F: This was kind of like $10 kind of thing, like $15. I think when everyone was like, Solana's over. Like, everyone was dunking on Solana and saying that it was shit and stuff. And as a bit of a maxi, right. It's my baby. It affects me. And so I wrote this long page, like, am I missing something? Am I not seeing something that everyone else is seeing about Solana? And so I read this long page, this a four page, of, like, my argument about my thesis, and I basically concluded that Solana had an image problem.
00:14:13.378 - 00:14:34.168, Speaker B: Solana foundation is doing a lot of interesting things. Like, they do have these bootcamps that they organize around the world to kind of attract developers. That's an interesting way to kind of get people to build on Solana. And I think being cheap, being fast, has very good properties. In onboarding a lot of people to Solana.
00:14:34.314 - 00:15:29.172, Speaker D: Well, I think the developers was a really good differentiator for Solana, certainly during the bear times in that, how Solana thought about growth was, we just need people building apps, which I think is the correct mentality, because other chains that had a big treasury, let's say they have a couple hundred million dollars, they were trying to attract people to that chain. And the way that they thought about growth was, let's go and pay insert big company, I don't know, Starbucks or something like that. Let's go and pay them $10 million and then promote our product. Solana went around it going, hey, let's go and make a whole bunch of developer conferences and get them to all go and build apps. And essentially, okay, maybe 90% of them fail, but at least, a, they're building on your chain, and b, maybe they make an app which is really good, and then you get a million users on it tomorrow. So I think, yeah, the way that Solana went about building that traction, definitely very heavily developer focused, maybe less so now. But I think it's just the pie is bigger.
00:15:29.286 - 00:16:05.150, Speaker H: And that's why Solana survived that scandal, because of the community, 100%, in my opinion. You know, it was the, like, don't be wrong. You know, the team, they obviously, they had a part of it. They were a factor in it. But, you know, the Solana Labs team has, you know, for years, been, in a sense, teaching the community how to be, how to be self sufficient. And I think, you know, that teaching paid off in that moment because it wasn't. You didn't see, like, totally everywhere, right? You didn't see Solana lab's team everywhere.
00:16:05.150 - 00:16:29.918, Speaker H: You saw the community everywhere. You saw leaders of the community. You saw influential figures of the community. They were all out there not attacking, not being defensive. They were all out there just trying to help. And so, yeah, I think community far and away is the biggest reason why the Solana ecosystem not only survived that whole situation, but is emerging from it stronger.
00:16:30.014 - 00:16:55.560, Speaker C: From my point of view, it seems like it's very top down. Like, Anatoi leads very much, very directly in how he thinks about derelict. Montalana must, like, do things fast, break things, and then fix them. And it's like, if it breaks, okay, cool, we'll fix it. We'll figure it out. He's very forward thinking in that way. I think it's kind of the same thought process he has around, like, hardware on Solani is like, we want to use the most out of this hardware that we can.
00:16:55.560 - 00:17:01.472, Speaker C: We're not really concerned with doing the opposite. I think it's really, like, forward thinking.
00:17:01.616 - 00:17:16.860, Speaker B: Developers go to where the users are, and the users are on Solana because it's cheap to trade on, for example, cheap and fast, easy to onboard users. And that's kind of where it is.
00:17:19.659 - 00:17:30.347, Speaker A: Solana went from near oblivion to one of today's top layer one blockchains. It's a remarkable comeback that caught most of the industry by surprise. But how did the community achieve this?
00:17:30.483 - 00:18:06.302, Speaker C: Well, in crypto, price leads a lot. So it was sideways between, like, 15 and $30, and that ranged for, like, 910 months. And there are a ton of people, like, smart institutional money, like smart retail traders, who are just bidding in that range. And then, like, eventually, when there was more demand than supply and it broke out above 30, there was a ton of active people who were like, oh, now I need to pay attention to Solana. And then when people started actually bridging over to Solana, like, oh, what am I going to buy. Then balk went from, like, what, 30 million to whatever it is now, like a billion. And then people were like, okay, we can buy alts on Solana now.
00:18:06.302 - 00:18:27.354, Speaker C: There's a proof of concept. Bonk just went crazy. Okay, what else are we going to do? And then that's when all the memes started popping up. A lot of people started launching their tokens. I think Jito was big. The airdrop for Jito was really, really big for people, because that was a wealth effect, similar to what happened with Uniswap on Eth. And all those people who got the Uniswap airdrop were like, oh, now I have $1,000 play around on chain with.
00:18:27.354 - 00:18:54.898, Speaker C: And it was the same thing for Jito, but it was even more substantial because there was not as many users as there was on ether that were active on Solana using Jito. Now, I was telling people all of last year, it's like you're not competing with a ton of people now because it's not consensus that Solana is going to do well. So, yeah, Jito, Airdrop, Jupiter Airdrop, there are a few other airdrops that do well. And then just literally all the memes just popped off immediately as Solana was.
00:18:54.914 - 00:19:13.676, Speaker I: Going up, for example. Now, to me, it's the attention chain. So if you're launching something high frequency, if you're launching a new NFT project or a new meme coin, really your number one place. Now it's Solana because it's super cheap, it's super fast to use, and the audience is there.
00:19:13.828 - 00:19:41.760, Speaker B: So I think Solana is very good in that sense in reaching out to the retail market, especially those who are not from the developed country, who cannot afford to pay $10 or $5 per transaction. A lot of people from developing countries don't have a desktop. People don't trade with the desktop they want to trade on. They only have their smartphone is their only device, and people must be able to trade easily on their smartphone. I think Solana has cracked that UX problem.
00:19:41.840 - 00:19:44.144, Speaker A: What does the acronym opos stand for?
00:19:44.272 - 00:19:45.448, Speaker C: Only possible on Solana.
00:19:45.504 - 00:19:46.420, Speaker A: What does that mean?
00:19:47.640 - 00:20:31.392, Speaker C: I think it was a really good slogan that, like, the marketing team at Solana came out with this past cycle during 2023. A lot of people, I think it originated on Twitter. But essentially what it means is, like, there are things you can do on Solana that you can't do on ETH and other l one s. So, like any application that requires a ton of throughput, you can't do on ETH because ETH only does 15 transactions per second. So anything that you need, like really heavy loaded transactions, you can't do on Eth, only possible in Solana. In the same way that, like, anybody can, like dollar cost, average into meme coins, a dollar a pop, basically for free. You can't do that on ETH because when activity spikes, it's really expensive to transact on chain.
00:20:31.392 - 00:20:39.886, Speaker C: So again, only possible in Solana. I think it's kind of a slogan for what's possible to build on the chain. And also the user experience is way better on Solana than other chains.
00:20:39.958 - 00:21:00.870, Speaker D: Well, right now, Solana has the highest Dex volume of any chain. That's number one in terms of, like, TVL utilization. Also number one in terms of user base. I think some of the wallets, they have, like 7 million active users. I think Phantom last week was saying that. I know Soulflare have about 3 million active users. These are huge numbers.
00:21:00.950 - 00:21:38.534, Speaker C: If you look at Solana metrics compared to ETH now, like Solana's on as much mev as ETH is right now, so on comparable Dex volumes as ETH is right now, there's equal amount of daily active users on Solana as there is on ETH. A ton of the other metrics objectively are on par with Ethereum. And the only reason that can exist is because of tech. Like tech behind the scenes. So, like, you can do fees that are 100 x lower than Ethereum, but you also have 100 x amount of activity, which is why they're kind of comparable and how much the chain is making or profiting. But that only works with the tech works. You can have the community, but you can only do that with tech works.
00:21:38.662 - 00:22:06.050, Speaker E: And in spite of the challenges that we've seen Solana face over the years, I think it's extremely promising what has already been accomplished. And I think the simple fact that we're seeing these stresses on the network are just a demonstration of the level of adoption and use and product market fit of Solana itself. I'm encouraged by it. I'm not discouraged by it. Ultimately, the proof is in the pudding. We're here now. The network's doing better than it's ever done before, and the sentiment across Solana is as good as it's ever been.
00:22:08.950 - 00:22:27.864, Speaker H: One thing that I think the Solana team has done an amazing job of is building a culture that people want to be a part of. There's a big element for all of us. We all want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves. And I feel like, you know, the Solana's tapped into that in a very effective way.
00:22:27.992 - 00:22:39.960, Speaker F: Now. It seems obvious, right? Like, we have millions of dollars in volume. Everyone's on Solana. It's the meme coin chain. But back then it was like, why would you use Solana? Like, you have binance or you have eth, basically. And now it's like, holy shit, Solana's supposed to be.
00:22:40.000 - 00:22:51.890, Speaker B: Solana has seen a lot of growth and adoption in the last one or two years. I think the meta for this crypto cycle is Solana.
00:22:52.010 - 00:22:59.418, Speaker D: Bitcoin's clearly this store of value thing, but it's kind of like just being like a gold bar that seems to be where bitcoin stuck at the moment.
00:22:59.474 - 00:23:00.042, Speaker E: Pet rock.
00:23:00.106 - 00:23:09.122, Speaker D: Pet rock kind of thing, right? So, okay, cool. I mean, that's good for people that want pet rocks, but for people that are trying to build a financial system, I think Solana is where it's at.
00:23:09.226 - 00:23:49.980, Speaker A: In the end, Solana's journey has been nothing short of a roller coaster. Following a meteoric rise, the ecosystem had to overcome growing pains like network outages and catastrophes like the FDX debacle, yet somehow managed to bounce back stronger each time. To address our first question about the industry's future, resilience and innovation was the key to Solana's impressive resurgence. While the reality for those within the ecosystem is that Solana's unique blend of community strength and cutting edge tech makes it one of a kind, today, Solana is one of the leading l one chains for metrics like active wallets, TVL, and transaction volumes. For anyone curious about the future. Michael Wagner has this to say.
00:23:50.100 - 00:23:52.760, Speaker E: It's going to be really tough to compete with Solana at this point. Though.
00:24:01.820 - 00:24:04.580, Speaker C: He made it. Rocky Balboa has shocked the world.
