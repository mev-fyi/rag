Now picture this. You are a die hard bitcoin maxi who holds only BTC, but you want to take advantage of various DeFi protocols. What do you do? First, you can deposit your BTC into one of the BTC to WBTC protocols like Bitgo or Kyber network. These protocols, mint wrapped BTC or WBTC, equal to the value of your deposited BTC. Now, with WBTC in your wallet, you can connect it to the Metronome synth app, where you'll instantly see a clear overview of the potential collaterals to mint synths. Pretty straightforward.
