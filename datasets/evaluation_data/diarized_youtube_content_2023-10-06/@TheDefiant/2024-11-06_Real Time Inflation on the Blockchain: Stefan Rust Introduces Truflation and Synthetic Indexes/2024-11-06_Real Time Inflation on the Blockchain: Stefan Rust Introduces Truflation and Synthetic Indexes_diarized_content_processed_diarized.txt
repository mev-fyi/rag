00:00:00.520 - 00:00:41.365, Speaker A: Change brings about opportunity, but it also creates a level of uncertainty. People are scared of uncertainty and entrepreneurs love leaning in and view that uncertainty as opportunity. And so we need to become positive as a human and solve those and embrace the opportunities versus trying to hold back from the uncertainties. Because once the dam is broken, the water will go through and we just want to be riding with a nice boat on the water versus actually being at the bottom impact and receiving that water down our throat and not being able to swallow it fast enough.
00:00:47.585 - 00:00:48.673, Speaker B: Let's start with trueflation.
00:00:48.729 - 00:00:49.441, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:49.633 - 00:00:54.765, Speaker B: Can you introduce us to Trufflation and explain what it's aiming to solve?
00:00:55.245 - 00:01:34.981, Speaker A: So what we're trying to do is bring financial. And what Truflation is trying to solve is bring financial and economic data onto the blockchain. As a result, what we have tried to do is make available data that's relevant to the real world financial and economic situation. In order to do so, we needed to enable not only data availability, but also compute availability as it relates to indexes. So we've built out a data and index availability layer on top of blockchain and obviously integrated with chainlink.
00:01:35.173 - 00:01:47.309, Speaker B: Fantastic. We're going to dive into all of those in just a second. But I'd also love to learn about your background and motivation too. So could you tell us a bit about your background and what led you to create trueflation?
00:01:47.437 - 00:02:37.455, Speaker A: So I've been a serial entrepreneur, launched a number of different businesses. Started off heavy in the mobile. So with the mobile revolution, I was very fortunate to get involved in that really early on. And then as mobiles evolved, I got involved in software on mobile devices. And as mobile devices became more and more pervasive, that enabled a lot of people to have compute available in their hand and the democratization of the Internet a lot more and the data. And so that led to me getting involved in bitcoin. I used to work at big companies like Sun Microsystems, and Siemens, but then I also launched a number of different companies, which some were successful, some weren't so successful, but the last one was launching a developer network.
00:02:37.455 - 00:03:35.155, Speaker A: So we were an agency for a number of different tech companies, acquiring developers for their tools and protocols and SDKs, which led to one of the developers wanting to be paid in bitcoin, which got me into the crypto landscape back in about 2012 when it was. Yeah. And so then I built out the, you know, expertise in bitcoin, founded developers in that area, and ultimately, yeah, got into running Bitcoin.com. i was the CEO scaled out to 50 million wallets, 500,000 merchants. And then inflation was only going to be transitory. And that's sort of when I sort of said there's no way you can tell me inflation is going to be transitory. And that led to the inception of trufflation, which ultimately was going to be just a pure calculator for real inflation.
00:03:35.155 - 00:03:44.267, Speaker A: So true inflation, as we started to see the mistrust in government reporting and government numbers.
00:03:44.411 - 00:03:53.055, Speaker B: Yeah, let's get into that actually. So trueflation's, how does truflation's approach differ compared to traditional inflation metrics?
00:03:53.455 - 00:04:31.607, Speaker A: So number one is we're real time. So compared to traditional inflation calculation, they report every 30 days, we report every day. So that was one significant improvement. So 30 times faster than they do if you look at it on a daily basis. And so that was the first element. The amount of data that we aggregate, we aggregate over 10 million items per country for the calculation of inflation. The government tracks 80,000, so 10 million at Truflation versus 80,000 items that monitor price changes, census basis.
00:04:31.607 - 00:05:11.431, Speaker A: So we look at what is the consumer buying. So we look at all, you know, sort of how does that differ? So the government will only track one brand and it just monitors that, whereas we see the volume of purchasing and then monitor and track items and prices based on the volume that is being consumed. So ultimately we can reflect a more accurate number as to what people are feeling when they go to the store. Those are the sort of some of the big differences. Obviously we make all of this data available. We cannot go back and change it. So it's immutable.
00:05:11.431 - 00:05:30.885, Speaker A: The government goes back and edits the historical data. Truflation, it's locked in the blockchain. It's immutable. We can't change it. And then ultimately we have different categories because we have so much data, we have different categories. So how do we track 12 categories versus the government six categories?
00:05:31.905 - 00:05:37.441, Speaker B: How is the competition in this field? Do you have like a big competitive landscape in importing?
00:05:37.633 - 00:06:20.149, Speaker A: So the competition across the inflation measurement is really the government. Right? The government has hundreds of thousands of employees across the federal statistical system. They have some 13 headline departments, they have a committee and they have ultimately hundreds of different bureaus that are doing statistical information. That's really the competition that we're up against. And we do that across the world. So it's the question is, do you trust your government with an important metric like inflation that steers interest rates, that steers money, printer that influences the loans that it has against its money printer.
00:06:20.277 - 00:06:29.305, Speaker B: So we're here at SmartCon in Hong Kong. Tell me about your like specific goals and objectives for, for this week.
00:06:30.005 - 00:07:03.185, Speaker A: So yeah, we're here at SmartCon in Hong Kong. We given the fact that truflation has launched the truf network. So we have all of that data set is built on a data availability and index availability layer which we call the truf network. So it's true truf. And as a result what we're doing is making that be used for index creation. So we've built index fun. So think of pump fun meets indexes.
00:07:03.185 - 00:07:38.095, Speaker A: And so if the index industry today in the fiat World is an 800 billion AUM industry asset under management industry, and we blend that with the meme coin movement that is taking place across the crypto culture and blockchain culture, and we smash those two together, we think that is index fun, where anybody can create an index based on the theme, based on interests or based on financial preferences. Then how does that become tradable as a synthetic asset on perpetual exchanges?
00:07:39.475 - 00:07:51.965, Speaker B: So creating synthetic indexes has its challenges. So what can you tell me about the unique obstacles truflation has faced and what is the cost structure behind them?
00:07:52.385 - 00:08:46.850, Speaker A: So creating indexes, the cost structure on the blockchain is a lot simpler, a lot quicker, and you can create one instantly. In the fiat world, you're going to need about a year or something to create an index and get it approved. You have a lot of illegal support needed for the documentation. Whereas on the blockchain I can write a lot of the requirements, the governance and the legal framework on in smart contracts and make that available in a decentralized database. And that's what we're doing with index fund. So that's one advantage versus the challenge that you have in fiat. I think that we've gone through many different challenges and I think one of the challenges that have been has been obfuscated right now has been the need for being dependent on one single chain.
00:08:46.850 - 00:09:38.805, Speaker A: All of a sudden you can create index coins and have them available across any chain. You can pull in price feeds for the underlying elements from anywhere and have that available as a unique index feed to a specific synthetic asset. How is that synthetic asset collateralized? That is the big challenge. But on perpetual exchanges generally, you're providing a collateral in order to be able to trade on a synthetic asset on a perpetual exchange. And then it's between the buyers and the sellers. And how leveraged are you against your collateral on that exchange? That then becomes ultimately a business model. That the perpetual exchanges pursue and perfect.
00:09:39.865 - 00:09:51.929, Speaker B: How do you envision synthetic indexes impacting the broader market and who are they primarily aimed towards? Is it for institutional investors or just everyday user as well?
00:09:52.057 - 00:10:25.715, Speaker A: Well, I think you have day traders. I mean, day traders might be interested in a lot of these elements from the institution side. I think it's going to be more available to participants across the globe that don't necessarily have access to financial services as we would be in the west or in the traditional industries and markets. So it's going to be 1.7 billion people out there that are looking to participate in specific investment products, number one. I think that's a big category. I think also the youth.
00:10:25.715 - 00:10:41.959, Speaker A: The youth are looking for more creative investment opportunities. Where can they generate wealth? They can't generate in housing anymore. It's too expensive. They can't afford it. Where do they go? They can make it in crypto, they can do it in meme coins. But meme coins is. So there are 5,000 new meme coins a day.
00:10:41.959 - 00:11:04.559, Speaker A: Which one do you buy? Which one not? How do you know? So it's very difficult for people to filter that through. So how do we make indexes? Which follows a theme. Let's say I like meme coins. How do I invest in meme coins? Here's a basket of different meme coins. Some may do really well, some may do really bad. And it's written by this credible index engineering company. Ooh, I like those guys.
00:11:04.559 - 00:11:22.543, Speaker A: It's more traditional. They follow my style. I think they're very credible. I will invest in that index. Or it's Murad himself who's creating the meme coin and he index. And so he's got these highly risky volatile 10 coins that he believes are accurate. And so.
00:11:22.543 - 00:11:37.575, Speaker A: Oh, I want that one. Because he knows. And then I can learn about some of the underlying and may pursue and engage in one or two of the underlying meme coins inside that index. But the index has helped me enter into the meme coin industry.
00:11:38.435 - 00:11:42.387, Speaker B: In what type of indexes are you seeing the most demand right now?
00:11:42.491 - 00:12:16.471, Speaker A: Inflation protection. Yeah, because of trueflation, we see inflation coming back. A lot of investors are looking to hedge themselves against inflation. So one of the most popular products that we're seeing great feedback on across the board is the hedge product, which is a blend of tokenized silver, gold, oil, S P 500 and Bitcoin as the basket that allows you to protect yourself against rising inflation in the future.
00:12:16.623 - 00:12:24.423, Speaker B: Interesting. All of those assets in one index, in one index. And what Are the percentages of each in hedge, for instance.
00:12:24.479 - 00:12:48.211, Speaker A: So I don't know off the top of my head, but each one has. You can go to trueflation.com search hedge and you will see the detailed breakdown there. The fact sheet, all of that will be available on the web, is available on the website now and where you can trade that. So ultimately, where can I go and buy this in a synthetic form or maybe even in a more ETF or ETP type form?
00:12:48.323 - 00:12:56.781, Speaker B: So data integrity is essential for financial indexes. How does truflation ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data powering synthetic assets?
00:12:56.923 - 00:13:27.617, Speaker A: So we have a consensus algorithm amongst the 30 node operators that are now working on the truth network and every item. And so each of the. So there are two elements that we add into there. One is a reputation element. So every data aggregator or data provider has a reputation score. And then number two is the verification. So we verify every single data set that we aggregate has three different providers.
00:13:27.617 - 00:13:56.245, Speaker A: So we need three price points for any item that we track. And as we add those, how do we ensure the weighted average of those three sources? If there's an outlier greater than X, then that gets goes through the reputation management system to verify who's providing that data. And then if it's too much and it's below a certain score, it then gets reviewed and then gets knocked out or gets accepted.
00:13:57.055 - 00:14:11.495, Speaker B: Can anyone get involved in the truth network? If so, what is the process like in becoming a node operator? What are the incentive mechanisms? What tokens do you receive for becoming a node operator?
00:14:11.575 - 00:14:51.385, Speaker A: So the node operators, anybody can join as a node operator. Right now we're keeping it slightly limited to select node operators. The incentive is in paid and reward. The rewards are in for participation are in truf tokens, which is the underlying token that supplies and maintains the truth network. The rewards are in terms of consumption, in terms of development work for the participation of the node operators. And also obviously the more consumption, the more revenue gets distributed across the ecosystem and to node operators. That's sort of how we've set it up.
00:14:51.385 - 00:15:09.105, Speaker A: Indexes are generally priced at percentage points or BIPs which are on the trading volume or the TVL of the indexes themselves.
00:15:09.765 - 00:15:11.861, Speaker B: And the token is truth token.
00:15:11.933 - 00:15:12.517, Speaker A: Truth token.
00:15:12.541 - 00:15:21.669, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And is that what was the use case of it? I guess like you pay gas for it? Do you stake it? Like what can you do with the truth token?
00:15:21.717 - 00:16:08.765, Speaker A: So with the truth token you can stake it, you pay data access. So the data availability. You want the truth network to calculate your Indexes, you pay the node operators to maintain and compute in real time your index and govern your index. Right. So how do we protect that index from being cheated on or changed or you know, and that's what the node network is going to protect. So we do that on chain and you pay for that in truth tokens. And then obviously consumers consuming the data or web 3 companies consuming the data sets pay in truth token as well.
00:16:09.505 - 00:16:18.081, Speaker B: Interesting. I have a side question here. What happened to your Twitter? I tried to go look into your Twitter and I saw it was suspended or something.
00:16:18.153 - 00:16:22.569, Speaker A: No, yeah, we suspended it. It shut down. My Twitter got hijacked.
00:16:22.657 - 00:16:23.017, Speaker B: Oh, really?
00:16:23.041 - 00:16:29.297, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Okay, So S Rust is no more my Twitter. It's the real S Rust is now my Twitter.
00:16:29.361 - 00:16:30.065, Speaker B: Oh, you're back.
00:16:30.145 - 00:16:45.377, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm back under a different username. But yeah, I got hijacked. Yeah. So it's like. And it's really hard to get back. And then they took all my content and moved it somewhere else. And so the SRUS 99 that you see on Twitter is not even mine.
00:16:45.521 - 00:16:48.485, Speaker B: Okay, that's unfortunate. I hope you get it back.
00:16:49.185 - 00:16:56.465, Speaker A: I don't want it back anymore. They've moved all my content, all my network somewhere else. So I don't even know where it is.
00:16:56.625 - 00:17:02.241, Speaker B: It's. Yeah, the Centralized World. Right. Web2World, this stuff like this really even.
00:17:02.313 - 00:17:10.405, Speaker A: And yeah, even in centralized world you would expect you get some sort of support or help or verification. No. So we took it down. Yeah.
00:17:11.025 - 00:17:23.805, Speaker B: Did something happen as a result of it? Like maybe, I don't know, like sharing like false links or like did it damage truflation in some way?
00:17:23.925 - 00:17:48.679, Speaker A: It didn't damage truflation. It damaged me personally. Yeah, for sure. It didn't damage truflation. So truflation and all its users, all of the truth token holders are all safe and protected. It did improve and enforce higher security measures at truflation and amongst the team and amongst myself and my family too.
00:17:48.807 - 00:18:03.151, Speaker B: Nice, nice. So looking ahead, what is the ultimate vision for truflation? Can you run me down through like any updates or like what's next for true inflation?
00:18:03.343 - 00:19:24.425, Speaker A: So ultimately, I mean, obviously we see inflation being such an important metric around the world. One of the things that I'm really happy about is the fact that countries like in Argentina asked for truflation to help with creating an Argentinian inflation index directly. So number one is you have an independent party doing the inflation calculation for Argentina. And number two, as a result, it could be a credible source to any of the borrowings that Argentina does and protecting the lenders against inflation in Argentina from an independent party. So it's not tied to the government, but it's an independent party providing inflation information tied to loans that the government is issuing in order for investors to attract investors to buy those loans. And so that's sort of where ultimately the true CPI can come in really handy. And how do we build out Truth Network to become this index availability layer and have lots of products be built off the back of indexes created on top of truflation and the truf network?
00:19:25.285 - 00:19:28.585, Speaker B: Are there any final words you'd like to leave our audience with?
00:19:29.125 - 00:20:16.583, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, it's an exciting time. It's I think right now one of the most exciting times to be alive. There's a lot of innovation taking place. I think in the last 30 years we've seen more innovation across the board, from health sector to tech environments with renewable energies and clean tech across all of those categories. There's never been more innovation on the planet over this and it's only accelerating, which on the one hand is a bit scary. But we have to lean in to identify how to participate in this new environment. Because change brings about opportunity, but it also creates a level of uncertainty.
00:20:16.583 - 00:20:51.665, Speaker A: People are scared of uncertainty and entrepreneurs love leaning in and view that uncertainty as opportunity. And so we need to become positive as a human and solve those and embrace the opportunities versus trying to hold back from the uncertainties because once the dam is broken, the water will go through and we just want to be riding with a nice boat on the water versus actually being at the bottom impact and receiving that water down our throat and not being able to swallow it fast.
00:20:53.565 - 00:21:00.581, Speaker B: Well, awesome. That's a great point to end it on, I think. Well, it was great to chat with you. This was a really interesting conversation.
00:21:00.693 - 00:21:03.245, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you Alp, for having me and yeah, thanks for that.
