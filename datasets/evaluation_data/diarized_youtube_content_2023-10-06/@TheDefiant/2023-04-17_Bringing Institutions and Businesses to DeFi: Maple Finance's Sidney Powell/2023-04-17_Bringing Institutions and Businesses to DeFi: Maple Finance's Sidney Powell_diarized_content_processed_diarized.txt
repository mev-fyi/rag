00:00:04.410 - 00:00:43.818, Speaker A: Sydney Powell is the co founder and CEO of Maple Finance. Maple is a DeFi platform that offers uncollateralized loans and facilitates interactions between institutional borrowers and lenders. In our conversation, we dive into Sydney's background, how uncollateralized loans work, how the bear market affected Maple, the benefits of blockchain based financial systems, and much more. We begin our conversation with Sydney, giving us an intro to Maple finance. Also, if you'd like to have a say in the defiant podcast and ask questions to our following guests, please join our Discord channel with the link in the description below for further instructions, or sign up for our premium account the.
00:00:43.824 - 00:01:53.978, Speaker B: Way we think of Maple is as a debt capital market built on chain. And so what that actually means is we've tried to build the infrastructure and the technology to run a lending business or a credit fund, but you do so on chain. So the deposits into a pool and a pool is kind of similar to an SPV or a credit fund in that it's a smart contract. And so the deposits are on chain, the control of the pool is on chain and then the loans themselves are all on chain. So it kind of replaces a lot of the legacy of core banking. But the defining features are that what we've tried to do is we often use this analogy of Shopify, where we didn't want to be the lender ourselves, but what we wanted to do was build a way in which we can empower other lenders using our technology and using this new set of infrastructure, which is smart contracts and the blockchain. We had started with a lot of under collateralized lending, but as we're going through the course of this year and now we're kind of 18 months into the journey, what we've done is look at real world assets as collateral.
00:01:53.978 - 00:02:08.070, Speaker B: So we will be launching a pool soon which has T bills as collateral and then also assets on other chains as collateral. So I think what we really want to do is be kind of full service rather than just one type of product.
00:02:08.220 - 00:02:14.200, Speaker C: Under collateralized lending, basically you're enabling a lending market, right?
00:02:14.570 - 00:02:15.174, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:15.292 - 00:02:19.778, Speaker C: How do you differ from other lenders like Ave, compound?
00:02:19.874 - 00:03:12.646, Speaker B: It's really interesting, but I think Ave and compound are, it's almost like a repo. So you put in $150 worth of collateral to take out $100. So it's useful for you if you want to take a leverage long or a short trading position. But it really serves traders and a lot of retail traders as well who already have significant holdings of cryptocurrency whereas the market that we've been trying to serve all along is really more like businesses and institutional borrowers. So if you look at a lot of trading firms or market makers, they can't face a permissionless protocol. They also can't have automated on chain oracle liquidations. And so they would go to CFI lenders previously, but that wasn't very transparent.
00:03:12.646 - 00:03:53.186, Speaker B: But we're still trying to cater to that market. So as we look at how we build that out, it's probably permissioned on our part. And then we actually want to enable both under collateralized lending to market makers, but also over collateralized loans where the collateral could be cross chain. So that would be a point of departure from Ave and compound. And then as we look at real world assets, that's helping businesses with credit that they need to grow and expand and operate their businesses. Whereas if you go and start a new business, you can't just post $2 million of Ethereum to borrow stablecoins to run your business. Most businesses don't have that kind of capitalization.
00:03:53.186 - 00:04:28.674, Speaker B: They need to take credit and that credit needs to be lent against the good standing of that business or against the cash flows that they're able to generate from producing value in their operations. So a good example of that would be the recent accrue pool that we did, which is lending to small businesses against a receivable that they're going to get from the IRS. So tax credits and that can be used by the small business to go and set up a new lease or to hire new people. But it has a real world impact in a way that a lot of the kind of the on chain protocols have not focused on.
00:04:28.712 - 00:04:43.298, Speaker C: That's super interesting. How do you manage that collateral on chain, like say a small business post this tax credit? How do you actually do this, verify this, do it on chain?
00:04:43.474 - 00:05:30.498, Speaker B: It's a good question. And so a lot of the early theory in real world asset lending was that you needed to tokenize the asset. So if I want to lend against a tax credit that a small business has, I have to somehow separate the tax credit from the business, tokenize it, and then represent that token on chain instead. What we said and the way that the maple protocol works is that we tokenize the loan. So it's like I give the loan to the small, I give the loan to the business in this case, and then they sign an agreement that says that if they default, the tax credit comes straight to us, it doesn't go to them. And so in that way, you've got the loan is tokenized, but the real world asset is not. But if you needed to, in the event of default, if you needed to go and repossess that asset, you can because you have the benefit of the legal agreement.
00:05:30.498 - 00:05:51.402, Speaker B: But you're just not turning that legal asset into a token because you only want to deal with that in a downside scenario. The really important part in ongoing business is just to have that loan represented on chain. So you can always see whether it's performing, whether it's paying. But we actually felt that it was just an inefficiency and a waste of time to go and tokenize the underlying asset.
00:05:51.466 - 00:06:05.070, Speaker C: Interesting. Okay, so two questions on that. How do you enforce that? If they default, how do you go and take their tax credits? And two, who's the counterpart to that loan?
00:06:05.410 - 00:06:08.542, Speaker B: When you say who's the counterparty, do you mean who are they facing?
00:06:08.606 - 00:06:10.658, Speaker C: I mean who's providing the capital in.
00:06:10.664 - 00:07:04.702, Speaker B: The instance of that tax credit receivable, what happens is there is a loan agreement between the pool and the wholesale borrower. In our pool, that's called interro capital, they're the borrower and what they do is they purchase the right to the tax credit receivable from an underlying small business and then it gets assigned via an escrow. So it means that when the payment comes in from the IRS as a rebate, it goes to an account that is for the benefit of the borrower in Taro, but has an account control deed where our delegate can step in and get the payment directly. So that way it's kind of separated from the borrower. So that if the borrower defaults, there's still recourse to get that payment directly. But that is governed by a legal agreement. So the loan is on chain.
00:07:04.702 - 00:07:47.730, Speaker B: We can tell how the loan is performing and all the payments are on chain. But if we actually have to step in, we refer to the legal agreement that they signed. That's like a wet legal agreement. I think in future those will start to come on chain and be hashed in things like IPFs. But I think for now this is sufficient. And what we found is there were a couple of defaults last year. And in each case the court upheld the validity of the Defi loan and said that the borrower still needed to repay and that the pool on the other side and the delegate and the Maple foundation were all legitimate creditors who had the right to get the assets back from the borrower if there was a recovery.
00:07:47.730 - 00:08:25.722, Speaker B: And then the second part of the question was, who are the lenders. So in our case, it's predominantly institutions. So we have hedge funds, corporate treasuries and startups. They're not typically doing the riskier stuff. Like they would be more interested in this cash management pool because that's effectively backed by T bills. And then the other component or demographic is high net worth individuals. So they have maybe made capital from being early investors in crypto, or they're highly paid individuals and they want to get a yield on their assets whilst having protection of capital.
00:08:25.722 - 00:08:36.382, Speaker B: And so they don't want to go and necessarily buy volatile assets. They want to stay in stables and get an 8% to 11% interest rate on participating in one of these pools.
00:08:36.446 - 00:09:22.850, Speaker C: Awesome. Super interesting. Okay, so just like taking a step back, the way that maple is different from other DeFi lenders which work in this more liquidity pool permissionless model is that Maple is permission. So like all of these lenders and borrowers are going through KYC and what the loans are against is real world assets via tax credits or maybe like invoices in the future, I would assume. And instead of having to have borrowers over collateralize their loans, they can put up some part of their business that can secure that.
00:09:22.920 - 00:10:13.634, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty close. It's that maple is trying to be kind of debt capital market across the spectrum. Ave and compound are solely wanting to stick with on chain digital assets in an over collateralized format. And what we're trying to do is know business growth through lending to businesses. And they could use real world assets as collateral. So that'd be like an off chain agreement or in the case of what we're doing with market makers, it could be an uncollateralized loan or a senior secured loan. But the difference is that it's not purely for speculation, in the same way that the kind of the on chain protocols were where it was post wrapped bitcoin or post ETH, borrow USDC and buy more.
00:10:13.634 - 00:10:15.534, Speaker B: Wrapped ETH or wrapped bitcoin.
00:10:15.582 - 00:10:29.222, Speaker C: Right. So for Maple to be dealing with these loans, you have to be an incorporated, just like real world traditional entity, I imagine, right.
00:10:29.356 - 00:11:16.526, Speaker B: We have a real world incorporated entity, so we have a development company, but that builds the technology. What we wanted to be was more infrastructure. So we didn't want to be the bank ourselves or the credit fund ourselves. What we wanted to do was create the technology and then charge someone a fee at a protocol level for using it. So if we had a credit fund, let's say, or a bank, they could set up and run a pool on Maple, and then they make the decisions about who can borrow, and then they take a fee, but they also pay the protocol a fee. And so the goal is actually to. I think the protocol is the best form of this, rather than an incorporated company, because we want it to expand and to be used by all of the large lenders in the world, whether they be banks or credit funds.
00:11:16.526 - 00:11:44.158, Speaker B: And so it makes the most sense if that's not a single company controlling it, but a protocol where they can buy the token, participate in governance, and own a piece of the network. I think it does work best as a network. You can see the pitfalls of having a marketplace that is controlled by one party when you look at Apple and kind of the take rate on the App Store, whereas here what we're wanting is really kind of this broadly owned capital market.
00:11:44.244 - 00:12:09.750, Speaker C: Before we go deeper into Maple, I'd love to get just your own background, because you do have past experience in all of this, in capital markets, in traditional finance. So what led you to going into kind of the dark side, the Wild west and Defi. The wild west or the bright side? Depends on where you stand.
00:12:09.900 - 00:12:36.814, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. So I used to be in institutional banking, so I worked in securitization, which was kind of think like mortgage backed and asset backed bonds. So we used to structure them. I was part of an australian bank, and that was a great experience. It was a really steep learning curve. When I started, I really enjoyed working there. And then what I did afterwards was I went from deal side at a bank to client side running the treasury of a commercial leasing company.
00:12:36.814 - 00:13:30.810, Speaker B: So that meant I had to run the banking relationships, and you would deal with the reporting, you would deal with other investors, you deal with the banks. And what it did was it gave me the line of sight on every aspect of how a lending business works and how many different third parties you have to manage. It's hugely manual, and what occurs at one of those companies is just a microcosm of what occurs at a bank. And so this was like late 2017, early 2018, I started learning about smart contracts and what me and my co founder did, because we used to work together. There was, we started thinking about, is there a way that we can take everything that we do manually and turn this into code to run institutional lending? And it would save money for that business. So it makes the business more profitable. It ultimately leads to better rates for borrowers.
00:13:30.810 - 00:14:21.918, Speaker B: But we thought of this as like a kind of new technology paradigm, kind of akin to the Internet, but one which is solely focused on the transfer of money and financial products. So we saw this huge opportunity to try and build a platform which would serve debt capital markets across any country, but where the end goal was could we tokenize bonds and tokenize loans so that any company can run a lending business purely on chain without having to just send emails and spreadsheets. Most of the business today runs on spreadsheets and emails between parties at banks and rating agencies. And it hasn't really changed that much in the last sort of 2025 years.
00:14:22.004 - 00:14:24.580, Speaker C: So what happened? You quit your job?
00:14:29.350 - 00:15:12.874, Speaker B: I started writing a white paper in early 2019, and then that probably took like, six months. And we had to find a software dev studio out of Australia and started going. We started attending all the Ethereum and web3 meetups around Melbourne in Australia, and we found this studio that helped us build a proof of concept. And that was when DFI was, like, middle of 2019. DFI was maybe five or six firms. It was maker, compound, set protocol. Dharma, it was really early days, and so a lot of people didn't think that any of this could be done on chain.
00:15:12.874 - 00:16:01.518, Speaker B: And so we had to go through a lot of iteration, and then that idea was kind of like, could you have tranched tokenized bonds on chain? And then we found that there were no loans that we could tranche out. So we had to then try and build a peer to peer lending platform, which took us into, like, may of 2020. And it was still so early then that we'd started doing some loans on chain, but we were just funding this all with our own money. All of this was our own savings, because VCs thought it was a stupid idea at the time. And so then we kind of went through this wilderness period, and it didn't seem like anyone was interested in what we were doing. People kept telling us it was years away and it would never be done on chain. And then kind of June, July rolls around, compound released the comp token, and suddenly yield farming started to happen.
00:16:01.518 - 00:16:54.106, Speaker B: And then people suddenly there were all these ideas about what you could do in Defi, and it was the pandemic. So everybody's kind of paying attention to what was happening in the crypto space. And then we had an opportunity to kind of join the two ideas. So we had the idea of peer to peer lending and doing loans on chain and having this network of pools, and having the pools tranched into a senior and a junior so that institutions could participate. And that was one of the key insights, was we said, let's not do peer to peer lending, where we have to match an individual borrower with an individual lender. Let's just syndicate the pool so anyone can go into this pool, but then a borrower only has to go and speak to the pool to know if they can take out a loan or not. And that significantly improved the efficiency.
00:16:54.106 - 00:17:27.450, Speaker B: And it was really quite different to what had happened before. And with that, we rewrote the white paper, and then we were able to get some advisors and go out and do effectively a precede through a token sale back then, which was around September. And from there, we got the resourcing to start hiring a full time team. And then we launched in May of 2021, but this really significant journey from January 2019 to September 2020, before we could raise and start hiring a proper team.
00:17:27.520 - 00:17:35.210, Speaker C: Wow. And how much did you raise in that precede, with your token?
00:17:35.370 - 00:17:46.498, Speaker B: That was small. That was about 1.2 million. That gave us enough to get started. And then in May of 2021, we launched and started doing the first pool from then.
00:17:46.584 - 00:18:00.502, Speaker C: Amazing kind of lesson in just perseverance, right? You had kind of this kernel of an idea that you knew was good, but it was about figuring out exactly how to execute it.
00:18:00.556 - 00:18:57.350, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. I think it was the fact that we realized that you couldn't just do tranching, which I think a few protocols came to market in 2021 or 2022 and thought that they could do this. And then they kind of struggled because they didn't have the downstream dependency or the upstream dependency, which was they needed loans that they could tranch out. So one of the things we found is that DFI is great for composability, but there's also this kind of red herring, which sucks a lot of people in, that they think you can just be this sort of thin protocol that connects with everyone else. But my view is that you need to vertically integrate in some respects, and that's the only way to kind of control your growth. So in our case, we had to attach loans and lending and make that a core part of the protocol. So now what Maple does is it has the pools, but it also has these delegates who originate the loans.
00:18:57.350 - 00:19:48.026, Speaker B: And so, as I look ahead, we're in this kind of protracted bear market at the moment, but me and my co founder and our team are now pretty used to grinding, and so we realized that it's just a matter of time to kind of get through this, and you just have to have the stamina and the grit to keep going and seize opportunities. And so the new pool that we're doing with cash management seizes some of the opportunities we couldn't have planned for it two years ago, but tradfi yields are now quite high. People are risk off, and so there's a good opportunity to do it. Same with doing collateral on other chains through a custodian. The exit of all the CFI providers gave us that opportunity. So you have to be prepared to grind, but then spot the opportunities that you can take and then kind of move quickly on them before we get.
00:19:48.048 - 00:20:46.170, Speaker C: To these new initiatives. Just looking at this trajectory and kind of the main lessons that you've learned, it's been a tough bear market. Last year, I think, couldn't have been more dramatic in terms of just seeing failure after failure in crypto, and it spurred a lot of chaos, right. Just people selling, pulling their assets from the space, flying to safety, and as one of few protocols offering under collateralized loans. What were some of the difficulties that came out of that, when people were just pulling their assets from the space?
00:20:46.320 - 00:21:37.674, Speaker B: I think what happened across the space was post terra lunar three ac Celsius. You saw this flood of capital out of the space, and so it created asset liability mismatch issues for a lot of protocols, and that was really something that was tough to control as a protocol, because in Maple's case, you had term loans, and then the depositors would count down to effectively, like a ten day withdrawal clock. And so then as everybody rushes the exit, they all do it at once. And so that was something that we had to fix in v two. And so V two was released in the early December, and it effectively put people on this kind of cycle of epochs, if you will. And so everybody gets to withdraw at the same time within a pool, and they will get equal access, or prorata access to the cash in the pool. So you couldn't front run me, I couldn't front run you.
00:21:37.674 - 00:22:22.150, Speaker B: And so it reduced the incentive to try and rush for the exits and induced people to just kind of have calmer heads. So that was one thing that needed to be addressed, like the asset liability mismatch. And the other one is, of course, credit risk. So when you're doing under collateralized loans, you have to really pay a lot of attention to a party's counterparty's balance sheet. Maple's loans, thankfully, performed better than other CFI lenders. There were a total of two borrowers who defaulted over the entire course since the protocol's inception. But we also had examples of exposure where one of the pools had been lending to Alameda.
00:22:22.150 - 00:23:09.458, Speaker B: And so there was an early action to try and proactively reduce that exposure by the delegate in July and August. So months before Alameda experienced difficulty. But I think the advantage of doing the under collateralized format was that the delegates on the platform had to pay more attention and be more on top of risks with the borrowers because they couldn't rely on collateral. Collateral, for a lot of people, can be this false safety blanket. I remember hearing people when they were talking about Luna where they Luna, you know, terrors over collateralized when it's in anchor, and so it's risk free. And a lot of people had that same idea when they were lending to Alameda. If they took collateral and FTT token, well, they said it was over collateralized.
00:23:09.458 - 00:24:04.282, Speaker B: But that's like you taking out a loan and collateralizing it with Camilla tokens or me doing it with Sid tokens, where probably if I'm defaulting, the Sid tokens are probably also not worth that much. And so that was a lesson that was learned the hard way by a lot of the CFI lenders. But our delegates had to think through those risks ahead of time because they knew they couldn't rely on collateral. What we're looking at now though, is a lot of people still didn't want to take under collateralized lending. So that's why we're now looking at integrating maple smart contract loans with a qualified custodian so that we can still take collateral on other chains as well, which we had a lot of foundations and parties that might be big avax holders or sol holders who couldn't wrap those assets on Ethereum but still wanted to participate. Sorry, that answer kind of dragged on a bit.
00:24:04.336 - 00:24:06.314, Speaker C: No, that's perfect. Super interesting.
00:24:06.512 - 00:25:00.726, Speaker A: Meet Stator labs, the noncustodial multichain liquid staking platform that's aiming to transform the liquid staking landscape.

Sign up for their Evex alpha list today.
00:25:00.726 - 00:25:04.430, Speaker A: And be the first to know about 1 million in DFI rewards.
00:25:05.090 - 00:25:16.734, Speaker C: Okay, so how you responded to kind of the learnings from last year is with this V two, which improves basically the withdrawal mechanism.
00:25:16.862 - 00:25:58.394, Speaker B: Yeah, in a kind of risk framework sense, yes. V two helps with managing withdrawals and then building in the ability to take collateral on other chains also helps manage risk. And the other thing that we're building right now is we've got open term loans, has just gone through into audit. And so that allows us to close out loans sooner, whereas before we're doing term loans. So those are three important ways. And then also what we wanted is we wanted to be robust infrastructure. But when you only have a couple of delegates on the platform, then the performance of one delegate can really impact how the platform fares overall.
00:25:58.394 - 00:26:19.894, Speaker B: So now another big focus is how do we develop that ecosystem so that we have many delegates pursuing many different strategies. And so that just increases the diversification of the lending pools on the platform and makes us a little bit stronger, because any one delegate then doesn't have a critical impact on the whole platform.
00:26:20.012 - 00:26:22.758, Speaker C: And delegates are essentially lenders, right?
00:26:22.844 - 00:26:47.146, Speaker B: Yeah. They're like you're a credit manager or a credit fund. So they're taking other people's capital and they're approving loans, so they don't custody the capital. It sits in a smart contract, which is better for the lenders, it's less risk. But what they do is they're responsible for underwriting and approving the loans on the platform and making sure that a borrower is not getting into trouble.
00:26:47.258 - 00:26:48.366, Speaker C: How do they do that?
00:26:48.468 - 00:27:35.354, Speaker B: Two ways. So they will review a borrower's financials. So every month a borrower will have to provide month or quarter, a borrower will provide a financial statement that says, here's how my business did, here's my assets and liabilities. But they'll also do real time monitoring as well now. So they'll look at, in the case of a trading fund or a market maker, they could look at what on exchange positions do they have and have real time monitoring in place. They can have proof of what's in the borrower's bank accounts. And increasingly this stuff is going in the direction of kind of zk proofs, so that a borrower can attest to having over a minimum amount without necessarily disclosing the exact balance or where it's held.
00:27:35.354 - 00:27:59.094, Speaker B: So I think that kind of zk proof of proof of assets and holdings and also proof that they are solvent and profitable across different exchanges as well. It's something that particularly borrowers who are trying to guard their alpha, so to speak, want.
00:27:59.132 - 00:28:07.414, Speaker C: That kind of privacy makes sense. Is there something similar to a credit rating lenders can rely on?
00:28:07.452 - 00:29:12.426, Speaker B: It's interesting, like we've been speaking with S P and there's a couple of ratings agencies that are kind of looking at the space. I think bringing that in is going to be super useful, because institutions, some institutions have a mandate where they can only buy the debt or lend to companies that have a credit rating. So if you could have a credit rating of a party that we could lend to, then suddenly more institutions could lend in that pool. But in the near term, there are tools like Credora was a good example, where what that would allow is effectively a view of a borrower's positions on different exchanges, so that you could effectively assign a credit rating to them, or at least monitor certain metrics. And what we're seeing now is several of these different kinds of credit scoring type products coming into play. So you have just some of the ones I'm aware of, proven spectral Arkham. All of these are kind of tools that are intended for monitoring in case you want to lend to a party.
00:29:12.426 - 00:29:19.086, Speaker B: And I think that's only going to get stronger, and those tools are going to continue to improve over time.
00:29:19.188 - 00:29:26.866, Speaker C: Sounds like it'll be key to have something like that in a protocol like Maple, right? Just like a standard.
00:29:27.048 - 00:29:58.122, Speaker B: Exactly. Like if you had a standard tool, then we could have a loan to a party where they get given x amount of collateralization. And if the business improves, and we can tell that from this tool, then we could lower the collateralization. If it weakens, we can lift the collateralization. If it goes really bad, we could recall the loan. But just having those tools, like imagine if some of the CFI players had had tools like that last year. In terms of some of the actions they might have taken.
00:29:58.122 - 00:30:16.190, Speaker B: I think the gold standard would be that the tools eventually interact with the smart contracts. So the smart contract could reset the available collateral level for a borrower, or reset the terms of the loan based on the credit score.
00:30:16.270 - 00:30:22.062, Speaker C: Back to your original point on delegates, how do you plan to increase the number of delegates?
00:30:22.126 - 00:31:10.254, Speaker B: I view the delegate. It's almost like a franchise model. So if you look at what we need to offer to entice them to come on board, it needs to be low cost, easy to use, and it needs to deliver like a meaningful cost improvement or increase in profit for their business. And their business is sourcing capital, underwriting borrowers, originating and servicing loans that's what they make their fees off of. And so what we already do is we give them template legal documents, so that when they come on board, the borrowers are already booked into master loan agreements, so they don't have to go and spend $50,000 on that. Then they have the software that we provide for sending out loans. Otherwise that's like hiring an analyst to do that for you and then reporting, so we can give them real time reporting.
00:31:10.254 - 00:32:15.026, Speaker B: But all of these things need to be, they're like a tool set. And ideally we want to provide a tool set that makes them more competitive versus people who are doing this the old fashioned way. And the other thing we'd probably look at is whether we do like a grants program on this type of thing over the next twelve or 18 months, just to bring some of them in and get some lock in with the ecosystem. But the way I think about it is doing loans on chain gives you a fundamentally, it's like a lower cost to run that business. And so I view our ultimate competitor as Ares group in the tradfi system. And so what you would see is that over time, I think if we're successful in executing this technology, then you could have a competitor come in who can lend either at the same rate to a borrower and they keep more profit or more spread themselves, or they can lend at a lower rate and make the same profit as Ares was before for their LPs. And in that way, the market will just vote with its feet.
00:32:15.026 - 00:33:08.182, Speaker B: And so the better borrowers will come and use the platform over time. And the lenders who want the better rate will also come to the platform over time and exit those kind of tradfi relationships. Because the tech stack that they have to use in tradfi at the moment is largely excel, email and bank accounts. So when you can connect loans and lending with your own bank account, if you will, that gives you a significant cost advantage that can't be replicated. When you have an asset manager who has to pay a bank for transactional banking services and has to pay software providers to give them the ability to report on bank accounts, that's just this layered tech stack of fees. And so I think that's ultimately the important innovation that blockchain provides us and why we choose to build this infrastructure on blockchain. It should be, over time, lower cost.
00:33:08.182 - 00:33:31.850, Speaker B: And that's why I think it will ultimately kind of eat capital markets and more people will use this infrastructure. It's just like ecommerce when you could do distribution and fulfillment and take customer orders online instead of having to have your own brick and mortar store. They were just able to compete on price better. And I think that's what we can do, is compete on price better for lenders and for borrowers.
00:33:31.930 - 00:33:42.594, Speaker C: Can you go deeper and maybe break down exactly where players can start cutting fees, using blockchains instead of traditional finance, for example.
00:33:42.632 - 00:34:17.294, Speaker B: So I can compare with CFI, but if you looked at a CFI lender, what they would do is they would have capital in a wallet that they controlled. So let's just say it was like USDC or USDT. Then when they wanted to lend that out, they would have to manually key in the borrower's address. Then they send a test transaction of $10. The borrower confirms they received it and then they send the remainder of the $1 million. But every one of those processes was manual. And so you had fat finger risk of the risk of sending it to the wrong place, risk of getting the amount wrong.
00:34:17.294 - 00:35:16.274, Speaker B: When you do that on Maple, the borrower requests the loan. So they request the loan amount and then it gets submitted on chain. And so the delegate in this case just reviews the request that comes in and then hits fund. So that's already saving time and cost there because you don't have to worry about manually entering it, you just hit fund. And the smart contract always sends the full amount first go to the right place, and then when the borrower wants to come and make their interest payment a month later, you don't have to have somebody manually calculate how much interest they owe them in excel. The smart contract records it, and then they just hit a button that says pay interest and it will send the money back via smart contract to our smart contract. And so again, that saves the two step process of before they would have had to send a test transaction of $10, then send the remainder, let's say it was $20,000 in interest.
00:35:16.274 - 00:36:23.170, Speaker B: And so already you're reducing the cost versus CFI. And in tradfi, when a borrower wants to make an interest payment, they have to manually key that in much the same way as you were doing in CFI and manually send that from one bank account to another. And then the reconciliation for the lender would be to download an extract of the transactions that went into that bank account and then reconcile them to the different borrowers who are supposed to make repayments. So the bulk of the cost saving is really at that middle and back office where you're processing repayments at the end of the month. You would have an analyst whose job it is in tradfi to take all of the payments from all of the borrowers and then reconcile them in a spreadsheet and then send them off to a trustee or a trust manager, who then produces a report in PDF and sends it back to you. And that happens about 15 to 20 days after the end of the month. But all of those people are paid separate fees and salaries for what on chain can be done automatically.
00:36:23.170 - 00:36:34.058, Speaker B: We have a dashboard that updates in real time and gives people an interest statement if they're a lender. And it provides a dashboard on how all of the loans are performing, literally the second after the repayment is made.
00:36:34.144 - 00:36:49.374, Speaker A: Silo finance protects borrowers from risk with its innovative risk isolation. Unlike traditional lending markets, when you borrow on silo finance, you know your risk upfront. Join thousands of users borrowing and lending crypto you cannot find somewhere else.
00:36:49.492 - 00:36:50.138, Speaker C: Bonus.
00:36:50.234 - 00:36:55.826, Speaker A: They're running an incentive program, so you might earn additional yield while enjoying your peace of mind.
00:36:56.008 - 00:37:12.802, Speaker C: Have you done any calculations on, I don't know, a dollar amount or like a percentage, or just like something in concrete numbers of how high the savings are with Defi?
00:37:12.866 - 00:38:05.750, Speaker B: No, we haven't. The ratio that I would look to and the one that we would put out if we were to do that would probably be the cost to income ratio. So if you're at a bank, you have your high level gross yield, that's what you lend out at, and the return you get on your assets. Then you have your net interest margin, which is the difference between what you lend at and what you borrow at. If you're a bank, and the net interest margin within that, you then have your cost to income ratio, and that's basically the cost of running the lending business and keeping the lights on. So I think what you'd find like a typical banking relationship ratio could have been like north of 30%. I think what you'd see is, and I think one of the delegates did a calculation on this and said that the ratio for them on the platform, that was with a small operation and subscale, was probably closer to like a 20%.
00:38:05.750 - 00:39:09.878, Speaker B: So you're looking at 30% is 50% higher than that. So you're looking at a reasonably significant reduction. But I think what we would need to do is do that in comparison with a credit fund rather than a full service banking institution, because it's different scale and it needs to be like for like. But I would expect that that ratio is going to be quite significant, particularly at the smaller sizes. One of the things this does is if you're a six to ten person credit fund, you basically can remove most of your operational stuff when you operate on Maple. Whereas if you were to do it manually using bank accounts and other kind of existing processes, you need to have this kind of full operational staff just to send out payments, to perform reconciliations and do reporting, because you're trying to knit together several different systems that don't talk to each other. Whereas when you do this on chain, on Ethereum, for example, you're just conforming to one system, which is being everything happens on a single ledger.
00:39:09.878 - 00:39:20.430, Speaker B: You don't have to take a bank account, reconcile that in excel. That's really where the costs come through. Cost savings come through, I should say.
00:39:20.500 - 00:39:27.122, Speaker C: So right now, who's using Maple, like on the borrower and lender side?
00:39:27.256 - 00:40:23.662, Speaker B: What we've got on the lender side is it's typically going to be high net worth individuals, crypto focused hedge funds. With this cash management pool, I think we'll see significant traction from DAOs. So Dows want to have an on chain place, basically to get like treasury like yield that is very low risk and highly liquid. It's not very transparent for the DAO's stakeholders and community if they have to sort of send that off chain to a bank account or multiple bank accounts that they control themselves and which can't be reported on to the community or to their stakeholders. So I think Dows would be a significant user of a solution that's on chain, as would crypto startups, particularly those who are offshore, because they can't easily access the US banking system. The other one that we're seeing is hedge funds. And so they might have a mandate to remain entirely on chain.
00:40:23.662 - 00:41:07.118, Speaker B: And so we're starting to see interest from them, albeit they typically want access to higher yield. So that's where the product that I mentioned before, which is where we have on chain loans, but qualified custodial collateral, which could pay anywhere from 8% at the low end to 1213, 14% at the higher end. That's kind of in their return hurdle targets, and those loans would be over collateralized as is. So I'd say that's going to be the lender side. On the borrower side, our bread and butter had been market makers and delta neutral funds. I think that will continue, and those will be the users of that latter product. But otherwise, really where we want to see a lot of growth is real world businesses.
00:41:07.118 - 00:42:05.214, Speaker B: So we mentioned the tax credit receivable pool that was an originator lending to small businesses across the US. And so we want to see that kind of real world impact among businesses. And so the next verticals we're looking at on that side of things are things like reinsurance, trade finance, where you have a party that might be doing a lend for the purpose of agriculture or importing or exporting. And the other one is like trade receivables finance. This could be a business that, let's say, sends a shipment but doesn't get payment for 30 days. That's something that you can finance with trade finance or trade lending, but you're going to see those two spokes. We're going to continue doing the on chain lending to market makers and market mutual funds, but we're also going to expand this with real world lending to businesses in either trade finance receivables.
00:42:05.214 - 00:42:08.038, Speaker B: Factoring reinsurance is another one that we like.
00:42:08.124 - 00:42:14.966, Speaker C: How do you get to those real world businesses? As a DeFi protocol, we actually get.
00:42:14.988 - 00:42:40.782, Speaker B: A reasonable amount of inbound interest. And the trouble has been finding lending capital. Who wants to lend out? So on chain capital is kind of constrained at the moment. Two years ago, there was a ton of capital that wanted to come in from tradfi and get on chain yields or on chain interest rates. Now that's kind of gone away. I think that'll come back next year. And so how I look at coaxing it in is increasingly there are questions on kind of the regulatory side.
00:42:40.782 - 00:43:41.806, Speaker B: So probably what we'd use is fund structures and exemptions under securities law, so that you can offer things to accredited investors or to a maximum number of people. Having that kind of regulatory compliant wrapper around DeFi helps a lot of institutions get comfortable, and then they like the fact they can already see the performance of this stuff on chain. So that helps. But I would say that's one of the ways that you have to kind of get more capital in is use some of these existing structures, whether it's a fund or an exempt offering to cater to institutional allocators. The other thing is they're hyper vigilant on things like KYc and permissioning. Previously, they just assumed that didn't exist in Defi. And I think now they're seeing this kind of parallel evolution of permissioned or institutional defi.
00:43:41.806 - 00:43:55.794, Speaker B: And that's one of the categories we fall into, is to go into one of these new pools, you have to pass KYC, and then your address has to be whitelisted in order to deposit. If you're not whitelisted, then when you try and deposit, you get blocked.
00:43:55.842 - 00:44:05.622, Speaker C: Would you say it's been harder to get lenders in than borrowers, just institutions who are comfortable depositing capital?
00:44:05.766 - 00:44:07.382, Speaker B: It's harder to get lending capital.
00:44:07.446 - 00:44:14.974, Speaker C: And so that kind of ties in with another question I had for you, which was kind of what's missing in Defi for institutions to come in.
00:44:15.012 - 00:44:59.002, Speaker B: The hardest part is probably the on ramps at this stage. So I think it's a couple of things. So easy and ubiquitous on ramps and off ramps are a challenge. There's really only a few kind of gateways they can go through at the moment. Circle is an important one, Coinbase prime is another important one. But we need to see kind of an expansion of those for institutions to come in. And then the other one is certainly regulatory uncertainty hurts and means that a lot of institutions, if it might have been two week conversation, now it's a two month conversation in terms of talking through legal due diligence with people.
00:44:59.002 - 00:45:47.174, Speaker B: Even if you're fully compliant, operating under an exemption, it's still just that kind of extra length of time. But these are all solvable problems. I think they will get faster over time. What has been a big help is like NPCs and wallet infrastructure is now much, much better than it was two years ago. And it means that when we talk to an institution, invariably they have either credo or fireblocks or some other multi Sig wallet solution that's kind of institutional or enterprise grade. And they probably typically have a coinbase prime or a circle account set up so that they can send fiat in and get capital on chain. So it definitely is improving.
00:45:47.174 - 00:45:47.862, Speaker B: It's just slow.
00:45:47.926 - 00:45:57.786, Speaker C: What would you say to kind of furious who believe that DeFi should be fully permissionless and you shouldn't have KYC?
00:45:57.898 - 00:46:43.142, Speaker B: It's interesting. I'll just say this. If you didn't have KYC across the world, it'd be a lot lower cost to offer these kind of products, but it wouldn't be kind of conforming with the way that countries choose to operate the financial laws within their jurisdiction. So I think ultimately it comes down to a matter of choice. To tell participants here that they all have to be permissionless is kind of as impractical as telling everybody that they all have to be permissioned. I think what you'll see is that both streams will evolve and you'll have kind of permissionless defi and permission defi. But if I want to serve institutions, I can't just tell them, well, DeFi is all permissionless.
00:46:43.142 - 00:46:53.822, Speaker B: So if you don't want to do permissionless you can't participate. We want to serve those customers and that's their requirement. So I think you should have both Coke and Diet Coke and offer that to your customers.
00:46:53.956 - 00:47:43.570, Speaker C: I want to ask you about your treasury bill pool. What's that about? And also tie into, just in general, real world assets in DeFi. I think maybe there's been some skepticism around that after what happened with know, just seeing how having fiat in the bank to back a stablecoin was very risky for USDC when all these banks in the US collapse. So I don't know if maybe after that event, people in DeFi have become more wary of having real world assets.
00:47:44.070 - 00:48:52.482, Speaker B: In Defi protocols, USDC and USDT. So tether are probably the two most successful examples of real world assets, in that you have a token backed by the real world asset, which is a deposit with a bank, or multiple banks. In this case, if people didn't have that, what I would say is just what do you replace it with? Because if you look at Ave and compound, they all have significant amounts of wrapped bitcoin. Wrapped bitcoin is an RWA, right? Like wrapped bitcoin is bitcoin held at a qualified custodian. So it's not really that different from having fiat deposits at a bank account, in that it could fail in the same way as a bank could fail. And so what are you left with? You're left with only the market cap of Ethereum to conduct all lending activity on chain across the world, which I don't think is significant enough. So I think what I would say is all of finance is different assumptions of risk, whether it's liquidity risk, credit risk, duration risk, forex risk.
00:48:52.482 - 00:49:53.398, Speaker B: And so there's no way to completely engineer that out. And I think Defi is extremely good infrastructure for lowering the cost of financial products and making them far easier to distribute. And so it doesn't need to be a product where it's totally impossible to default, because otherwise, if that was the case, you should never ever get paid more than the risk free rate at the end of the day. And so I think what we want is we want to enable people to conduct commerce and credit on chain, which means that you need to have a credit risk premium, which prices in the risk of default of one of your counterparties. But if you have that, you have to take the risk of some of these real world assets. And I think, I don't know the counterfactual, if you say this is then that you can't have real world assets in DeFi. Or on chain is that everybody has to just bank through the banking system, which we all find kind of inferior.
00:49:53.398 - 00:49:59.900, Speaker B: Like once you do most of your finance on chain in stable coins and using DeFi protocols, you never really want to go back.
00:50:01.970 - 00:51:07.134, Speaker C: Definitely a good point. I think it's needed to scale, right? You need more liquidity than just like the Ethereum market cap to be able to back all these financial products and services. And maybe it's this middle ground where the sweet spot is between being fully in traditional finance and just fully in crypto. Maybe the way to move forward is using kind of the aspects of both worlds when it makes sense. Like you were saying before, with permissioned protocols and KYC, for some users it'll make sense. In other use cases, real world assets as collateral will make sense. So taking what's most useful from both.
00:51:07.172 - 00:51:51.902, Speaker B: Worlds, I think in all cases, I'm going to be a maxi on this, but I think in all cases, the use of Defi rails will be better than what you can do in traditional finance. I think it's approaching that over time. The two examples I would draw would be over time, we moved away from having DVDs and we just streamed everything. Initially there was the use case that Internet was too slow to stream everything. Now we kind of just hit a point where we didn't look back. The other thing I'd say is saying that DeFi can't do real world assets and that they should only be done in Tradfi is kind know. It's kind of like saying that you should have only been able to buy digital goods on Amazon and that for everything else you should have had to have gone to a real world store to do like.
00:51:51.902 - 00:52:02.690, Speaker B: It kind of makes as much sense as that to be. I think we'll be steadily conducting all financial transactions on chain over time.
00:52:02.760 - 00:53:10.454, Speaker C: I think that's a good framework. It's like what we're changing is the rails for finance, which should be blockchain based instead of messaging, excel, whatever this anachronistic ways that tradfi does things. But while we are moving to blockchain based rails, the actual assets that are transacted on those rails are either digital or. I don't know. In the end, everything is digital. But is it like a crypto asset or is it a T bill or is it a stock or it's just the rails on which any asset is transacted. And I think in the end, this distinction between real world asset and non real world asset will kind of start to blur because everything should be a real world asset, like ETH is a real world asset or it's not an imaginary thing, right? I don't think that difference will be so defined moving forward.
00:53:10.572 - 00:53:54.614, Speaker B: I think what happens is that over time, you'll see the financialization of everything. Like if you look at commodities, right? You used to have oil, barrels of oil, and you trade barrels of oil, and then you'd settle in the barrels of oil, like take delivery of them. But then over time, we move towards financial contracts where you have futures and the futures settle in dollars. They don't, at the end of the day, deliver you barrels of oil, or pork bellies, or lumber and wood. But what that represents is the increasing financialization of the real world because it's more efficient. Sometimes people need to offset. Like you either need to hedge or you want to speculate on it.
00:53:54.614 - 00:54:47.046, Speaker B: But I think if you look at interest rates already, you have significant financialization of lending loans, interest rates. And so I think the trend is one of increasing financialization of this over time. And what I look to is that the underlying trend is that when you do this on chain, it is much more standardized and it's much easier to package and distribute. And so I think when you just combine that with the profit incentive, it's only going to go one direction. Like more assets will come on chain. It's not like Morgan or Wells Fargo or one of these guys is going to build their own chain and everybody's going to go use that. You can only then rely on that one party that kind of built in controls that.
00:54:47.046 - 00:55:16.222, Speaker B: Whereas when you do this on Ethereum, it's just this settlement layer that everyone can use. And so things tend to conform to those kind of standards over time. And already what you see is that a lot of the smart people at those banks are kind of leaving to create their own versions of what they were doing in their day job at the bank on chain. It's just the way that markets work. There's more opportunity, more upside for them in going and creating those products and solutions.
00:55:16.286 - 00:56:07.774, Speaker C: It's funny, I was thinking it's been a while since I had someone from a purely DFI protocol or project on the podcast. We've had tons of more web3 focused guests, and I think it's just like a reflection of the space. I think there was DFI summer and all this boom in decentralized finance, and then DFI kind of, at least from my perspective, quieted down a bit. Like we saw less innovation from DFI and more from NFTs and kind of web3 and other areas to you. What's missing? Or will we see a new kind of DFI summer like boom?
00:56:07.822 - 00:56:14.994, Speaker B: I think we will, but it'll be different. The next D five summer won't look exactly like the last one, and there.
00:56:15.032 - 00:56:16.180, Speaker C: Has to be a different.
00:56:19.350 - 00:57:44.590, Speaker B: All right, I hope we don't get the hangover that we had in 2022, but no, it'll need to be a different catalyst. But I would say there's that Carlotta Perez tech hype cycle and capital formation, and it's like we overran in DeFi summer, the level of traction and functionality, and then it crashed. And now kind of our functionality is ahead of where the valuation and the hype around the space is, and it's steadily being improved. But I think what we'll see is that there's emergence when there is a ton of capital. And so as we get an order of magnitude more capital into DFI, so as we go to 200 billion, I'm not sure exactly what DFI's current TVL in billions is, but as we cross an order of magnitude higher, the number of different products that can be offered and participants and the kind of emergent ideas that come out of that will increase again. And I think that's what will trigger the next kind of call it wave of DFI summer. If you look at what happened in late 2000 and 22,021, it was, the number of projects in the space just exploded to hundreds of them, from probably less than a dozen in 2018 and 2019.
00:57:44.670 - 00:57:48.770, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. Until then, I guess we keep grinding.
00:57:49.270 - 00:57:53.074, Speaker B: All you can do is just kind of grind it out, as Ray Cross said.
00:57:53.112 - 00:57:57.394, Speaker C: And last question, what makes you defiant?
00:57:57.522 - 00:58:40.000, Speaker B: What makes me defiant? Well, I have just a ton of conviction. Like, I've. I've had the same conviction in the space since picking up the pen and writing the first white paper for Maple at the start of 2019, that eventually, this is kind of that Peter Thiel idea. Like, what secret do you think that other people don't? And it's like, I think all lending activity will eventually migrate on chain. And so when I hear people talking about how isn't it a shame that DeFi was all a fraud? I think in five years they're all going to be conducting all their loans on here. And so that's what I'm defined. Like, I think ultimately the largest financial institutions will be here doing things on.
00:58:40.000 - 00:58:50.118, Speaker B: So, you know, the entire maple team is kind of there, prepared to grind it out to get to that point. And it's just a matter of staying around long enough.
00:58:50.204 - 00:59:02.998, Speaker C: Agree. And yeah, the defined will be there with you guys. We have that same conviction. So awesome. Sid, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. This was a fantastic conversation. I appreciate it.
00:59:03.084 - 00:59:04.900, Speaker B: Thanks for having me Camilla. I really enjoyed it.
