00:00:02.730 - 00:00:52.826, Speaker A: Welcome back to the terminal tutorial series. In the previous videos we showed you how to create custom dashboards and add customized charts and tables to your dashboards. Today we're going to show you how to share those across various social media sites and how to get news and chat functions within the platform. So let's say I'm very happy with the way that I've displayed data on my personalized dashboard and I want to share it. I go to the top right corner of the screen, I have a share button and I can either go directly to Twitter or copy a link to my dashboard and share it with whoever I want to. Another really useful function on the top left next to the view dashboards button is this drop down menu. I can click on show news and it's going to bring an aggregated list of headlines from a list of reliable Defi news sources, including the defiant and more.
00:00:52.826 - 00:01:40.360, Speaker A: Another really useful function in the same drop down menu is the show chat function. So let's say something controversial is happening in the world of defi without leaving the platform. I can gauge opinions by looking at the show chat function and I can type in my opinions and share it with people that are using the platform without leaving the website itself. So there you have it. We've seen how to create custom dashboards, how to add charts, tables, unique combinations of data, how to share our personalized dashboards across social media, how to get aggregated headlines onto the platform itself, and how to chat with users within the defiant terminal. We'll be adding plenty more useful features in the coming weeks, so keep your eyes peeled for announcements on the website. You.
