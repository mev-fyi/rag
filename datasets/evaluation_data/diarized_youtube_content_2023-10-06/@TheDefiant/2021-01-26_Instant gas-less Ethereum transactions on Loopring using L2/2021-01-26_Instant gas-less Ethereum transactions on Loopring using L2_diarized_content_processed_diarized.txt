00:00:01.690 - 00:01:00.542, Speaker A: It's Tuesday, and that means it's time for another bite size educational snack where I try and condense a deFi lesson into just two minutes. But first I need some coffee. I don't know if you can hear, but my voice wrecked you now last week was a momentous one as ETH finally made a new all time high, bringing with it huge excitement and anticipation of what might be ahead of us this year. But it all brings with it elevated transaction costs and DFI was already dangerously close to being considered the placing of whales and idle rich. And this isn't helping. Now, we recently released a video in our DFI 101 series explaining all of this and what gas fees actually are. Thankfully, there are other solutions that tackle this scaling problem through layer two s now a layer two is an overlaying network that lies on top of the underlying blockchain and does most of the work for the layer one.
00:01:00.542 - 00:01:43.578, Speaker A: And it's a neat way to help ETH handle much greater throughput. Layer twos open many doors and act as scaling solutions, and it really does feel like now is a crucial tipping point, with major protocols taking decisive steps to build them into their offering. Synthetics launching with optimism, ava bridging to matic and today's topic, loop ring, which uses zk rollups. What is a ZK rollup? Well, basically it's a clever thing that compiles a number of transactions and stores them in an off chain database. And the way it does that and the way it hides what's actually going on is kind of clever. But you don't need to know all about that. All you need to know is that all the data is compressed into one bundle, which is later verified by Ethereum.
00:01:43.578 - 00:02:25.962, Speaker A: So that way, technically, you aren't using the Ethereum main net at all. And that also means those high gas fees gone. But how do you actually use an L two? Well, let's throw two minutes on the clock and get this started. Okay, so for this tutorial, we're going to be using loop ring LRC, which is the fastest Dex built on layer two tech on Ethereum. So first I'm going to head over to their website, which is exchange loopring IO and connect my wallet. Now, after your wallet is connected, a new button deposit to activate layer two will appear. Click that and enter the amount you would like to deposit to later swap with.
00:02:25.962 - 00:03:02.786, Speaker A: Now, you will have to go through this process to activate the link between Ethereum, which is layer one, and loopbring, which is layer two. However, keep in mind that this will have a regular token transfer fee. But I promise this is the last time we're going to be seeing any of this in this video. And yes, I know you're probably going what the seeing gas being spent at this step. But the reality is that it's actually cheaper to deposit to loop ring once than it is to do a uniswap tray. Paying gas to loop ring to activate layer two is a one time fee, and then you're done. So after 18 confirmations, we are ready to start swapping.
00:03:02.786 - 00:03:39.422, Speaker A: Finally the unlock button will appear and then you click on that to unlock your layer two account with your wallet. Now, this is just a signature, no fee here. So let's say I want to buy some ETH with my die. I'll select those from the drop down menu and select the pool I want to trade in. And once it's selected, the AmM pool will show you the exchange rate. Loop ring fees for the swap are 00:20 5% and 00:15 percent of that goes to liquidity providers and the remaining zero 1% goes to the relayer and protocol fee fees are taken from the token you are buying. These are not gas fees.
00:03:39.422 - 00:04:19.840, Speaker A: Now the last thing on the list is to click swap and your transaction will be executed instantly and you can head over to your swap history and the fees you paid in the orders tab. Now, the full transition of Ethereum to Pos might be years away, but layer twos will continue to serve as a scaling solution on every step of the journey, and Vitalik himself is pretty optimistic about optimistic rollups. So that's it for this week. If you found this helpful, do us a favor and like the video or subscribe to the channel. We're putting out tons of videos these days, and unfortunately we are still all very much slaves to the YouTube algorithm. Decentralized future. I will see you on the next one.

00:04:46.258 - 00:04:47.974, Speaker A: I hope I said that right. Did I say that right?
00:04:48.012 - 00:04:48.920, Speaker C: I'm not sure.

00:04:54.994 - 00:04:56.360, Speaker A: Price too much?
00:04:58.250 - 00:04:59.000, Speaker B: No.
