00:00:00.570 - 00:00:20.842, Speaker A: Good morning. It's Tuesday, which means it's time for a tutorial. Today we're looking at Solidx, the yield optimizer built on Phantom. It's a very sexy little thing. It has a token called sex, and we're going to see if we can earn a nice little yield on some stablecoin pairs, but we'll get into that after these messages from our sponsors.

00:01:39.142 - 00:01:49.806, Speaker A: And get rid of confusing wallet addresses. So yes, solid X. And if we look at the image here, this strange blue creature with his glass, I have no idea what any.
00:01:49.828 - 00:01:50.894, Speaker B: Of that is about, but it does.
00:01:50.932 - 00:02:27.206, Speaker A: Kind of reflect the fun nature of this protocol and what it's trying to do, although it is of course very serious. So what is it? It's a yield optimizer for solidly built on Phantom. And if you think of convex for curve, Solidx is that but for solidly. So basically liquidity providers deposit their LP tokens to earn boosted solid rewards without having to lock solid themselves. We'll get into why that's important in a second. Those lockers then earn a portion of the protocol revenue in exchange for providing boost to LPs. And then the native sex token entitles users to their share of protocol revenue, voting power and bribe.
00:02:27.206 - 00:02:47.234, Speaker A: So it's all the fun games that you find on curve and convex. But now on Phantom and solidly. Now if you remember, we had Andre Cronier on the channel about a month ago. He was talking about solidly just before it launched. It's here now and it works so solidly. Has. Well, it's been a huge success.
00:02:47.234 - 00:03:10.774, Speaker A: The TVL has just rocketed to 2.4 billion. Solid X itself is 2.28 at the moment. So they're around 18th and 19th on DFI llama, but that is only a little bit below balancer. And remember, this thing only launched like four days ago. So that's a pretty impressive performance and it shows that people are still betting on Andre and on what he can do.
00:03:10.774 - 00:03:38.818, Speaker A: So here's what the solidy features look like. It's a phantom amm. It's based on unisor V two. You provide liquidity, you receive solid rewards, and then you can lock solid to receive V solid, which is the vote escrowed version of solid which grants you voting rights and a share of protocol revenue. And those locks last between one month and four years. The longer you lock, the more V solid you get. You can get up to two and a half x boosted rewards as well.
00:03:38.818 - 00:04:06.714, Speaker A: So here's how the lock breaks down. One solid lock for four years will give you one v solid. One solid lock for two years, half a v solid, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So the longer you commit, the more you get. Now, Solidx allows you to earn those boosted solid rewards without having to lock up solid yourself. So you deposit solid into Solidx and then you receive solid sex. I know it starts to get a bit ridiculous when you say it out loud, but bear with me.
00:04:06.714 - 00:04:37.494, Speaker A: So that Solidx is a one to one representation of the solid balance that is then locked within the protocol. So what Solidx does is it continually extends the lock time to maintain a four year lock on the solid locked within. So on solid Lee, you can extend the lock time. So you're continually gaining the most V solid that you can. That's what Solidx is basically doing with the solid that you deposit. Also, solid sex cannot ever be converted back to solid. So once it's in, it's in.
00:04:37.494 - 00:05:10.394, Speaker A: So we'll be continually earning rewards and growing the power of that reward pool. So you deposit LP tokens and you receive sex rewards. So that's Solidx's native token, and it's in a ratio of 4.269 to one. I'm sure there's a reason for that, but there you go. Sex can be locked for up to 16 weeks, gains voting power over solid gauges, and receives protocol fees. So there's all sorts of game theory stuff going on designed to incentivize partners to basically get the most liquidity to direct voting.
00:05:10.394 - 00:06:01.822, Speaker A: There's bribes, there's all the fun stuff that you find on convex and curve, but now on Phantom. So in order to take advantage of this, we need to set up Phantom on Metamask. And the way you would do this is go to Metamask, click on the network list at the top here, scroll down to the custom RPC, and I've left the details for that here. So if you go into Metamask up here, it's very slow today, and then select the network, you can go down to add network here, and that will give you this page where you can enter those details that I gave you before. I'm actually going to change the network to phantom because I'm already on Phantom. And there we go. So you can connect your wallet to the Solidx protocol, and we can actually go ahead and take a look.
00:06:01.822 - 00:06:22.898, Speaker A: So here it is. There's the app, and we have pools. And what we're interested in here is probably some stable pools. I'm not that interested in volatile pools. The impermanent loss thing, it's just not a game I want to play. So we can select stable, and what we're looking at here is something solid. So this USDC min pool caught my eye.
00:06:22.898 - 00:06:37.446, Speaker A: It's 17.8% APR. It has actually dropped a little bit. It was 18 or so before, but that's a stable pair. So the volatility should be minimal and the impermanent loss will therefore be minimal. But 17.8%, that's pretty decent on stable deposits.
00:06:37.446 - 00:07:15.746, Speaker A: And of course you're going to get sex rewards and solid rewards as well. But how do we deposit there? Well, if I click on manage, it will give me some options to deposit my LP tokens. So I would have to deposit LP tokens for the USDC and mim pair, and I would create that on solidly, except I don't actually have to. You can zap straight in by depositing USTC and mim magic Internet money directly here. And then it will zap into the pool and stake it automatically, all in one transaction. That is what we're going to do. But first we have to acquire some USDC and we have to acquire some mim.
00:07:15.746 - 00:07:50.286, Speaker A: It's so fast on Phantom, it's crazy. So I have a ridiculously small amount of FTM Phantom tokens. So this will look a bit silly, but essentially this is what I'm going to do. So I'm going to trade 20 ftm for USDC. Swap that right now, confirm that and shouldn't take long. And it's swapped. So now I want to swap same amount, 24 mim.
00:07:50.286 - 00:08:09.194, Speaker A: Magic Internet money mim. There we go. And I'm going to swap that as well. Do the same thing. Confirm. Let that do its thing. It's about 20 seconds to confirm and hey presto, we are done.
00:08:09.194 - 00:08:40.050, Speaker A: So let's go back to Solidx and this pair we're going to manage. We're going to go zap deposit and we're going to put the max in that we can approve. Yes. So that's going to approve the spending of my USDC on SolidX. I will have to do the same thing for mim, I think. There we go. I have to approve Mim.
00:08:40.050 - 00:09:18.252, Speaker A: These transactions costing $0.03, so not the cheapest I've seen, but it's pretty cheap, let's be honest. So now I'm going to go ahead and deposit to finalize this. That's a zero point 52 ftm transaction. So now it's depositing USDC and Mim into that stable pool. So now that's done, we have deposited USDC and mim into the pool all in one zap. And as you can see here, this laughably small amount, $63.23.
00:09:18.252 - 00:09:35.412, Speaker A: I will be earning a laughably small amount of sex and solid. But it was just to prove how simple and easy that was to do. That's it. That's basically how it works. You can have a look at some of the more exotic offerings here if you select stable. This one, I mean. Yeah, good luck with that.
00:09:35.412 - 00:10:06.000, Speaker A: 1761.2% on solid sex versus solid. I don't know if I would want to be playing with that, but 16% on USDC and fracs, 17.9% on USDC mim stablecoin pairs are always good value when you can get double digits like that. So that's pretty good going that solid X. Hope that was useful. Phantom is proving to be a pretty interesting DFI sandbox, and with Andre doing his thing, it should attract a lot of TVL and it seems to be doing exactly that.
00:10:06.000 - 00:10:11.230, Speaker A: If you have any suggestions for us to cover in tutorials. Please drop them in the comments below. But for now, have a wonderful day.
