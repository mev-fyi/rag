00:00:01.610 - 00:00:36.518, Speaker A: A year ago, we were all aping into defi farms, hunting those precious governance tokens because, you know, number go up. Governance was basically seen as a larp. Wi Fi holders understand that governance is entirely a LARP, and Wi Fi was a valueless token, a way to shank idiots into believing money really could be conjured out of thin air. But I have become increasingly aware of grumbling around governance, particularly when it comes to VC weight in decision making. Those governance tokens, well, they can actually do something now. Now, the recent DFI education fund is a case in .1 million uni.
00:00:36.518 - 00:01:27.238, Speaker A: Around 19 million morika coins at the time were granted after receiving support from uni holders. Only the third such proposal to actually pass a vote. And many of the supporters were big, big wallets, like, big ones. Now, what really hacked people off was the fund's decision to immediately liquidate half of that allocation, despite the proposal indicating it would liquidate over a period of four to five years. Now, this was around $10 million, not massive, but still chunky. But since they haven't actually liquidated all of the money, they haven't really broken that promise yet. But it doesn't look great, does it? Now, uniswap has a big treasury, a seriously, seriously big one, and how that money is deployed is likely to become heavily political in coming years.
00:01:27.238 - 00:01:55.994, Speaker A: Governance, right? Dumping your own token is a bad look. And that brings us to Uma and their range token, which offers an elegant solution. And we'll dig into it right after these words from our sponsors. Don't let high gas costs keep you out of Ethereum, a balancer.

Learn more about what they're building and read the yellow paper at offshift IO coming Q 120 22 so back to Uma and the range token now according to a tweet from July 7, Oxmaki submitted a sushi swap proposal to raise $60 million by selling discounted vested sushi tokens to 21 key investors. The Uma team saw this and felt they could propose a better solution. So they went ahead and created it. The answer? The range token. Essentially, it's a way for Daos to diversify their treasury without selling their native tokens. By using their native tokens as collateral, they can then borrow stablecoins with zero risk of liquidation.
00:03:52.066 - 00:04:20.942, Speaker A: Now, stables have no bearing on the market price of the native token, of course, so this insulates token holders from the shock of a big sale, like, for instance, $60 million from the treasury. To prove that it could work, Uma themselves raised $2.6 million using a loan backed by their own UMA collateral. No lawyers or middlemen were used to draft documents or escrow funds. The terms are purely reflected in the logic of the Yuma spark contract itself. So stick with me here. Here's how it works.
00:04:20.942 - 00:04:58.202, Speaker A: The inaugural range token has a four to twelve dollar Yuma price range and expires on August 31. The token was prized to have a 25% APY at 0.963 USDC. Now that discount reflects the 25% annualized yield over the two months until expiry, and here's how the payouts would happen. At expiry. If Yuma is within the four to $12 range, the investor will have earned 25% APY paid in Yuma. If humor is more than $12, the investor earns an effective APY higher than 25%.
00:04:58.202 - 00:05:31.398, Speaker A: So the investor has effectively long exposure to a $12 call option. And if UmA is less than $4, the investor earns an effective APY lower than 25%. So the investor has short exposure to a $4 put option. So Uma went ahead and then created a contract specifically for ox markey sushi proposal, which you can see here pretty intensively. Amazing kind of cool stuff. It's options, it's derivatives, but based on your own treasury. Kind of cool.
00:05:31.398 - 00:06:10.286, Speaker A: So when the going is good, having a buttload of your own token is great. But when the bear is in town and has taken over the entire top floor of the best hotel for a twelve month rager, then things are going to be a lot, lot tougher. And this is another example of just how effective hashtag D five primitives can be for treasury management. Dows, I suspect, are going to dominate the conversation over the next few years, and how they deploy their capital will be placed under greater and greater scrutiny by stressed out token holders, and I'm sure we'll see many more innovative strategies for creating liquidity. That's it for today. As always, if you have suggestions for projects to cover in first look, drop them in the comments below. I'll see you on the next one.
00:06:10.286 - 00:06:15.310, Speaker A: Have a great week. Don't be too stressed out by the bear happens. I'll see you. Boom.
