00:00:04.600 - 00:00:49.898, Speaker A: Welcome to the Defiant. I'm your host, Tegan Klein. My guest today is Noah Seedman who has an impressive systematic view on crypto and how crypto fits into the overall macro market. Noah is a technologist with a career spanning two decades. He has a unique perspective on the intersection of crypto and finance garnering him a reputation as a thought leader. While most on crypto Twitter or crypto X are talking about meme coins in the next few months Noah has been thinking about crypto over a long time horizon. We talk about his macro views, how he chooses to build his portfolio, advice he has for someone starting out maybe in their twenties and the secret to him staying on top of all of the market news.
00:00:49.898 - 00:01:00.030, Speaker A: He understands things like the monetary premium and categorizes tokens in a very interesting way. Before we dive into this, we discussed what Noah is focused on on his day to day.
00:01:00.410 - 00:01:37.022, Speaker B: When I am not relaxing, which is most of the time, I keep my eyes on the market to understand where things are. But that's not necessarily what most people think. People when they hear eyes on the market they're thinking in terms of ice charts. But I have a much larger perspective that I look at and it's really global macro and I want to understand where we are in what is commonly referred to the liquidity cycle. And that's what brings me my comfort. That's why I'm calm, cool and collected.
00:01:37.166 - 00:01:47.410, Speaker A: Yes, your voice is always very calm, cool and collected and I'm excited to kind of dig in and chat more. So tell us like global macro, give us a snapshot. What's happening?
00:01:47.870 - 00:02:51.640, Speaker B: Well, we're towards the limits of where liquidity can become constrained. And in a debt based monetary system, the global currency supply needs to be expanding, productivity needs to be expanding, GDP's need to be expanding. We just closed the month and last month there was a several hundred billion dollars fiscal deficit in the United States. We are spending more than we make and that is a standard accounting book, income versus expenses. And the income is in good part measured by GDP which plays into tax receipts. So in order to balance the books, and that's just, it's not just the United States GDP's need to go up and they're not going up. So I'm very much interested in watching the stagnation of GDP.
00:02:51.640 - 00:03:13.116, Speaker B: At minimum, it's flat lining. And obviously like dot plots and like GDP now indicators of regional fed offices, they're stagnant. It's not expanding and growing. And we're getting to it. Getting too tight for too long, the end of the contraction cycle.
00:03:13.228 - 00:03:17.200, Speaker A: And what's causing that stagnation for debt to expand?
00:03:18.100 - 00:04:04.660, Speaker B: You could refer to it as the easiness of money. And it's clearly interest rates. This is the tightest monetary policy has been in decades and five and change percent in the United States. And it's not really that expensive in historical terms. So it's obviously a complicated story and it is always a struggle to present it in an understandable and coherent way. So ECB just cut, Canada cut. The United States is not responding yet because they would argue they want to keep it tight because of public facing, the political optics of consumer price inflation.
00:04:04.660 - 00:04:36.802, Speaker B: And they will need to cut at some point, but they think they can't cut, but they probably should cut. And this is all just the public story. And I try and put myself in their shoes of what is the behind the scenes story. So the behind the scenes story is probably geopolitical factors and all of those complex types of conversations that certainly don't have enough information to talk about. And we could only speculate on.
00:04:36.866 - 00:04:44.752, Speaker A: Before we dive into how you fell down this crypto rabbit hole, I want to get into your background. Can you tell us what life was like before crypto?
00:04:44.866 - 00:05:38.250, Speaker B: Well, I still am a software engineer. I program Android mobile products as a professional career for 15 years at this point, which means I'm the old man of the Android software development scene. And it's quite enjoyable. It's a skill set that is second nature at this point, just like understanding another foreign language. So never quit. Your day job is always a reasonable statement independent of how experienced you are with managing capital. So that is something I plan to continue to do, maybe less, as capital management becomes more front and center, more capable of servicing myself.
00:05:38.250 - 00:05:45.366, Speaker B: Aside from the need for employment, you could just get the balance, your work life balance a little bit better.
00:05:45.518 - 00:05:52.702, Speaker A: Absolutely. And how did you kind of fall down that crypto rabbit hole, if you will? How did you get started in crypto?
00:05:52.846 - 00:06:31.676, Speaker B: It's been a long time. I bought first bitcoin at $290. I sold it all at $590 and 1617. I remember the frenzy. And the frenzy of 16 and 17 is very much like the frenzy of Defi summer in 2020. And it will be like the frenzy that's forthcoming when the global currency expansion cycle continues inevitably. And back then it was a very different world, very different economic situation.
00:06:31.676 - 00:07:13.582, Speaker B: Pre pandemic certainly. And I was younger and I think often of those years, and you could always wish that you had more experience when you're younger. But in the end, we're all on a journey, and we're always improving the way we understand the world. And that's how I started. And I had my trials and tribulations, my good and bad experiences, and I could even look back, most recently to 2020 and 2021, and always say, I wish I did things differently, but in the end, I am who I am today because of the things I've done.
00:07:13.686 - 00:07:45.512, Speaker A: Absolutely. You live and you learn, and I think holding is the hardest part. And I've found from friends from back in the day, they got in and they get that psychological hurdle of, oh, I just doubled my money, I'm gonna take all of it out. And so I think you're among a lot of people in that case. So I love that you're very transparent about that. Is there anything that drew you to crypto? I guess you have the trading side, but anything around the crypto ethos or the future that we're hoping for in this world that drew you in?
00:07:45.656 - 00:08:52.842, Speaker B: Well, a lot of this story is probably most recently my evolution from the end of 202-120-2223 and obviously to current, and it's much more so recent technological innovations than predin pandemic era 16 and 17 was icos, which is just a capital raise, and there was no substance to what was being created. The common word is utility, but it's more than utility, because utility is an expression of business. It's an expression of a product and a service. And clearly, we're talking about fintech, fintech products and services and businesses. There was nothing in 2016 and 2017, and 20, 1819 was akin to where we are with 22 and 23. And everything really changed post 2020. And that really started with Uniswap and the concept of this on chain market, as I call it, which has evolved into a market of markets.
00:08:52.842 - 00:08:56.830, Speaker B: When I say a market, I really mean like a global financial market.
00:08:57.130 - 00:09:07.230, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I think a lot of that infrastructure came together to allow for applications like Uniswap to spin up. But I think we're just at the tip of the iceberg of what's possible.
00:09:07.570 - 00:09:30.780, Speaker B: Most certainly, that's just an exchange, which is what I would define as an FX market. And then it certainly gets complicated because it's not just currencies, it's derivatives of currencies, and which have characteristics of money, which have characteristics of collateral, which have characteristics of equities and bonds, for what it's worth.
00:09:30.940 - 00:09:35.480, Speaker A: Absolutely. And have you ever attended a crypto event in person?
00:09:36.140 - 00:10:08.462, Speaker B: Well, I've gone to bitcoin Miami twice persons that are fortunate enough the two have been successful earlier probably attend because they can, and they, and it's a trivial financial expense. You jump on a private jet and you go wherever you want. I've never done as such, but Miami is local enough for me to attend most recently.
00:10:08.606 - 00:10:17.032, Speaker A: Amazing. I'll be at bitcoin Nashville. Was there anything you found about the culture attending an event in person with all the bitcoiners?
00:10:17.206 - 00:11:04.346, Speaker B: Well, most recently, things have changed with the names, with persons that are interested. Lynn Alden. And these folks are brilliant macroeconomists and politicians even more recently. I very much enjoy their perspectives. I am the antithesis of someone who, I appreciate the professional side of this industry, and that is much more than a common bitcoin maximalist would express. There's macroeconomics involved, and that type of perspective is required to really understand where these systems are heading.
00:11:04.498 - 00:11:20.030, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I think you have a very systematic view of crypto and how it fits into the macro markets. So can you kind of start top down with macro? I think that we live in an interesting time today, but any big picture views on macro and how crypto fits.
00:11:20.070 - 00:12:32.488, Speaker B: In so fundamentally, I think Luke Groman nails it as money is an expression or a manifestation or a derivative of energy, which is clearly a talking point, a historic talking point of bitcoin folk. And I love the way Glenn Alden talks about these topics, and especially her expertise on the history of monies. And I produce derivatives in my own mind to understand these topics. So I categorize gas tokens, bitcoin, ethereum, solana, as a money or something that has a property of moneyness, a degree of moneyness. And there's two types of things a person does with a portfolio. They have a cash position, which contains things that can be used for settlement, which is basically things that have degrees of money ness that can be collateralized and you can access credit against it. And the other part of the portfolio is investments.
00:12:32.488 - 00:13:26.450, Speaker B: And from a macro perspective, that's kind of extraordinary, because the status quo is to use us debt as collateral, because it has great degree of moneyness, pristine collateral. Its face value is going to be paid upon maturity. But I think it's changing. And it's very much how Luke Grumman talks about it. The biggest bubble has been long term us debt, which got to basically 0% interest rates at the bottom or the top, and has been going down ever since in price point, as interest rates have been coming up. I would think very much along the lines of what he says. I think we have higher lows and higher highs on interest rates going forward.
00:13:26.450 - 00:14:30.540, Speaker B: So I think the world is very much in need of collateral. The US is certainly going to provide it, as we can see, with our fiscal deficit and our capacity, and basically need to issue more and more debt out of treasury to finance our fiscal or gluttonous fiscal desires. But the world is wanting choices and options. I think bitcoin falls very well into that position. It has properties of a currency, certainly properties of a collateral, and that is very significant. Now, you could have an entire conversation on bitcoin versus ethereum versus other assets with regard to its moneyness properties, but certainly all of those are collateralizable in some form or another within the crypto markets. And then it's important to understand the size of these crypto markets compared to the world, and it's basically zero.
00:14:30.540 - 00:14:53.670, Speaker B: The world's a big place and these markets are small. Hard story to tell, but I guess a decent statement is, I think, of where we are in these markets as testnet. All of it to this day, even bitcoin. Just the capitalization of bitcoin at a couple of trails. It's basically testnet.
00:14:53.750 - 00:14:56.010, Speaker A: And at what point will we hit Mainnet?
00:14:57.070 - 00:16:15.758, Speaker B: Well, that's a significant adoption. Bear in mind, that's actually a scary thing to consider, because Mainnet implies it's disrupting some nation state or another with regard to its systemic usefulness and how it's being consumed. So it's not necessarily a good thing with regard to stability and social rest, civility for it to become mainnet, quote unquote. But this journey is interesting, no less, because at minimum it's causing entire nation states to respond because it has properties. And these properties, certainly nation states probably want them, but they can't have them because the collateral of nation states and the money of nation states are at the whim of regulatory authorities, policymakers and the politicians. But that is not the case, at least in the same regard as bitcoin. You still have governance and you could reach a quorum of validators and miners updating to change policy.
00:16:15.758 - 00:16:33.410, Speaker B: But that is not the same thing as congress and other political bodies around the world. So I think they should be envious of these properties, of these assets, but they cannot attain these properties.
00:16:34.240 - 00:17:13.930, Speaker C: What Google does for the web, the graph does for web3. Decentralized apps deserve decentralized data. That's why web3 is built with the graph. The graph just completed its sunrise initiative, removing its hosted service and fully decentralizing web3's data layer. The graph ensures that no one can get in between you and the data you need. Building in web3 it's easy to power your web3 data pipelines on the graph and get started with 100,000 free monthly queries. Not technical, but want to get involved? Join the graph community and delegate to help secure the graph network.
00:17:13.930 - 00:17:17.606, Speaker C: Join the revolution on thegraph.com dot and.
00:17:17.638 - 00:17:31.624, Speaker A: Do you think that the US dollar fiat system is sustainable? Or could there be a world, even though to your point, it is likely a scary world, where bitcoin becomes the global reserve currency, the best thing to.
00:17:31.672 - 00:18:33.740, Speaker B: State at this point is time. And I think of the time it takes for these types of changes that most people talk about in very short periods is to reference like celestial phenomena like a supernova or the sun becoming a red giant. They take enormous amounts of time, and clearly that's just a metaphor. But with the dollar, the structure of the global dollar's use changing. Like check back in a decade, check back in 20 years, check back in 30 years, and it's changing in very meaningful ways. But the dollars used for settlement on the swift network is at multi decade highs. And because of its properties, relatively relative to other currencies around the world, it has the most desirable properties.
00:18:33.740 - 00:18:39.592, Speaker B: And that will change over time. But that will take a long time.
00:18:39.736 - 00:18:42.900, Speaker A: Absolutely. Well, potentially we shall see.
00:18:43.680 - 00:19:29.436, Speaker B: But bear in mind, that's scary. If anything, that changes quickly. So that's volatility. And persons that trade volatility is not necessarily what people want. You want stability, you want calm. And that's why everyone, whether you're trader or investor, could appreciate that in the morning, when you wake up in the morning and you go outside and you're in your driveway, or the lobby of your apartment building, if there's 200 people in your lobby and it's volatile, or you're pulling out of your driveway and there's 50 cars that you're waiting for to pull out of your driveway and it's volatile, that's discomforting, don't you think?
00:19:29.468 - 00:19:45.592, Speaker A: The fact that we have traded that short term calmness, it's almost like a trade, right? We have that short term calmness because we're playing these games with the monetary policy policy, but we're sacrificing the long term for that short term calmness.
00:19:45.776 - 00:20:46.710, Speaker B: Certainly that's what debt is. You're pulling the future. Volatility, because of the construct, is certainly to get more volatile in the future. For short term calmness, we're literally facilitating the refinancing of debt by kicking that volatility into the future by increasing more and more debt, at some point it becomes unsustainable. But the scary thing is when you really understand geopolitics, which I am not a professional at, of what strings can be pulled from a political level and a geopolitical cross currency which can get violent, even stories and plans from the WEF. And what do you do when I, you cross thresholds of entire currency systems failing and the structure of the system breaking down, so it could get very volatile.
00:20:47.890 - 00:21:13.960, Speaker A: Absolutely, and we touched on this briefly, but I want to double click into it. There's always been this dichotomy in crypto between kind of valuing blockchain layer ones based on this underlying monetary premium versus their ability to kind of accrue value from underlying applications built on top of them. Where do you kind of stand on that debate? Why, in your mind, do l one blockchains have value.
00:21:14.860 - 00:21:55.100, Speaker B: It's all I reduce everything from, to an investor's perspective. And all of that reduces to the risk profile. So the greater the finality or the shorter the finality, or the more final the finality, the more immutable the finality, the better the risk profile. So l one certainly stand out in that regard. Your value, your money is more secure, there is less security. With the l two s optimism just rolled out some interesting upgrades. So that security profile is increasing, and that is comforting.
00:21:55.100 - 00:22:10.922, Speaker B: And then you could digress into how to respond to these varying degrees of risk consideration. That's very traditional capital management conversation. It's risk assessment.
00:22:11.026 - 00:22:24.840, Speaker A: Absolutely. Okay. And then we've talked a lot about kind of the monetary policy, monetary sovereignty side of crypto. What are your views on the other side of crypto that's almost less proven that we're working to prove in Web three?
00:22:25.740 - 00:23:00.300, Speaker B: Well, it's big tech, da data availability, dpin on chain compute. These are very long term narratives that have short term volatility. And clearly we've seen Celestia was just parabolic out of the gate. But these are very long term types of technological offerings. You have to think of target market. You're talking about cloud storage and cloud compute. That's Microsoft and Amazon.
00:23:00.300 - 00:23:40.802, Speaker B: I'm not too fond of allocating capital that far out. I want two, four, six year time horizons on business reaching some sort of critical threshold. So I think there's many more businesses offered in the crypto space that have a shorter time horizon to more consumption adoption. I'm very fond of the core pillars of the crypto markets, which is foreign exchange, credit and derivatives, which is very traditional fintech.
00:23:40.866 - 00:23:50.730, Speaker A: And why is that? I actually take a different approach when I invest, and I take like a ten year time horizon. So can you just share a little bit of insight as to your why there.
00:23:51.110 - 00:24:43.124, Speaker B: Well, compartmentalize the portfolio. And in that regard, there's no reason not to have a ten year time horizon. The question is expectations. Expectations are everything, because if you don't meet your expectations, you quickly find disappointment, satisfaction. You question your rationale and it leads to capital management, volatility, self volatility fud. You're like, did I make the right choice? So when you have a structured portfolio, and you're able to compartmentalize for different time horizons, you could set your expectations accordingly, and you have to size those positions accordingly. I very much favored many different methodologies, and you could only judge in hindsight.
00:24:43.124 - 00:25:12.498, Speaker B: So it takes ten years to judge a ten year time horizon from a hindsight perspective. So nowadays, from an investment, it also requires me to define how I look at a portfolio, cash versus investments, and what I define as an investment. I dont consider bitcoin, ethereum, gas tokens as investments, I consider them a money. So what is an investment is an interesting question.
00:25:12.674 - 00:25:21.090, Speaker A: Absolutely. And tell us a little bit more about your investment strategy, investment thesis, how you look at your overall portfolio.
00:25:21.250 - 00:26:00.570, Speaker B: I'm a very traditional investor. In hindsight, that's what it turns out to be. I am looking for a return on investment over a reasonable timeframe. So it's very often for traders, they have measured moves, and then it's a very short time frame. You have an ascending triangle, and the breakout is a measured move to the upside of 20%. Bull pennant. The upside move is a 30% move to the upside, and you take profits over what, a week, a month, six months.
00:26:00.570 - 00:26:54.500, Speaker B: So I do the same thing with regard to cash flow. I appreciate the traditional notion of a business. And a business has consumers and offers products and services. A business has a balance sheet, it has revenue, it has operational expenses, opEx. And thats what really allowed me to refocus almost entirely the way I think about these crypto markets in terms of traditional businesses. Thats what I think the vast majority of people interested in this space dont see yet. Maybe I cant speak for the largest of investors, but how could they not see what I see? A balance sheet on these protocols that are remarkable.
00:26:54.500 - 00:27:05.376, Speaker B: There's nothing in all of Nasdaq and all of the New York Stock Exchange that even remotely compares to the balance sheets of these crypto businesses.
00:27:05.528 - 00:27:27.188, Speaker D: Protocol 20 introduces Sorbonne, which is stellar's cutting edge smart contracts platform. This creates new surface area for innovation and provides new opportunities for developers to build protocols and products that create access to everyday financial services. So it means a gradual increase in transaction capacity and a chance to fine tune applications. And it's the most transformative upgrade to the stellar network to date.
00:27:27.324 - 00:27:28.200, Speaker B: Woohoo.
00:27:28.820 - 00:27:56.374, Speaker A: Okay. And you know, I came across your podcast, I was super impressed and just how well informed you were. I haven't seen you at a crypto event, but I think, you know, maybe even more than a lot of people that hop from event to event, which is often how you get that deep industry knowledge. How do you keep up so well with the crypto space? What do you, how do you get your news? Where do you learn about all of these things if you're not hopping from kind of event to event to stay on the ground? Informed?
00:27:56.502 - 00:28:54.220, Speaker B: Anything that's presented at an event is certainly available in the crypto newsroom, which literally is X, formerly known as Prince. No, Twitter, and it's all available. Every piece of information could ever possibly need to be a great manager of capital is available. And obviously the only thing I could say for how I know what I know and, and how I've come to produce these types of methodologies and concepts and these stories that I tell, that's what makes me, me just, I'm. This is the way I think this is the way I document things and there's plenty of documents that I offer on stream as well as on our private discord. And it's just my view on the world.
00:28:54.380 - 00:29:12.746, Speaker A: And break that down for us. Maybe for a listener who wants to be as informed as you. They're on Crypto X, but they don't really know who to look at, who to follow, what news to look at. Do you have kind of lists that you engage with or. Yeah, break it down a little bit.
00:29:12.898 - 00:29:46.252, Speaker B: It's a journey of self realization and you have to identify your expectations. You have to understand the world as it is, not the world as people want it to be. The BRICS currency is going to replace the dollar and reserve currency. Okay, great. A lot of people would say, sure, check back in 20 years. That's cool. I mean, I agree.
00:29:46.252 - 00:30:30.910, Speaker B: I think there's plenty of better tech. I think the US thinks there's plenty of better tech. I think certainly that the WEF thinks there's a much better ways to structure a system with regard to currencies, but over what time horizon? So my strongest encouragement to persons is probably start listening to macro, folks. Definitely. Lynn Alden, Luke Groman, Raoul pal, real, realvision.com is great content to start to understand macro. Michael Howell's perspective is invaluable.
00:30:30.910 - 00:31:10.720, Speaker B: But most importantly, after you listen to these perspectives, you have to really assimilate it and you have to form your own opinions. And clearly, myself listen to my type of thought and the way I think about these things. But then further, you make a derivative of my thoughts and all of their thoughts. And that's the only way to really have your own, have acquired your own perspective on the way the world works. That's the only way to be comfortable engaging with these types of markets. You have to find yourself.
00:31:11.100 - 00:31:27.962, Speaker A: I love that. Very profound. But not just macro, because I've heard you talk about the optimism release. I've heard you talk about arbitrum. How are you staying up with those news updates or release updates?
00:31:28.106 - 00:32:04.936, Speaker B: Well, fortunately on x, when you follow them and they post something, you get the headline. So obviously who you follow is who you become is the information you have. And that's important. And the last thing you want to follow is I have compiled a list of the hundred and next defied gems to go 1000 x on the money. Please look at my list and pick one of them. So don't follow those guys. Don't follow popular people, popular people that are excited.
00:32:04.936 - 00:32:59.094, Speaker B: You don't want to be exuberant. Here's an interesting one. Finance is boring af, it should be, it should be super duper boring. It should be watching paint dry. It shouldn't be trying to turn $100 into a million dollars. It should be the fact that you can do extraordinary things in these crypto markets that are absolutely impossible in the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, you cannot get 30, 40, 50% on your money APR from any of those entities in equities land. But these types of returns are reasonable in crypto markets, which means you're being compensated for taking risk.
00:32:59.094 - 00:33:09.660, Speaker B: But you have to understand that risk. So it's quite extraordinary what you could do in crypto land versus traditional finance. And, and then that is just exciting.
00:33:10.000 - 00:33:23.220, Speaker A: Absolutely. And, you know, you don't strike me as an activist. You're kind of like, let's see what happens. There's no kind of impetus inside of you that wants to join the fight and try and build this future that we're all looking towards.
00:33:23.760 - 00:34:22.274, Speaker B: Oh, this, this is, this. It changes everything. As, because of the balance sheet that I mentioned, if you look at this crypto market, the credit, and if you look at exchanges as foreign exchanges is what it does as compared to a brokerage house, a bank, if you go to an HSBC or a chase and say, I want to give you a million dollars of dollars and a million dollars of euros and please exchange them, I just want zero 2% of the transaction fees and allow people to trade the capital. Would they laugh at you? I don't know. Nobody's ever called them to ask to do that. Maybe if you're another bank or you're like a family office, but you could just do that in the crypto market. You could provide liquidity and have that revenue of the transaction fees and credit.
00:34:22.274 - 00:35:04.604, Speaker B: If you deposit a million dollars into chase and say, hey, chase, please give someone a mortgage, I want 6% per year for the next 30 years, they would laugh at you. But you can do these things in these crypto markets in a way where you capture the return. So with these types of portfolio additions, you own these types of businesses, which basically means you own a part of a bank. I often say, if it walks like a bank and talks like a bank, it is a bank. It doesn't need to be titled or labeled the bank, it's a bank. So you own a bank. And then that's fascinating.
00:35:04.604 - 00:35:21.852, Speaker B: And that presents all sorts of conversation about, like, the whole regulatory conversation and the whole jurisdiction conversation. And where is crypto? Where is it? Is it up there? That's a fascinating thought.
00:35:21.996 - 00:35:34.552, Speaker A: Okay, and then what about DeFi Summer? What was that experience like for you? And then what did you learn kind of subsequently in the bear market that followed in 2021 and 2022, I was.
00:35:34.576 - 00:36:27.830, Speaker B: Frantic in DeFi summer. I was filled with anxiety, filled with self. I was realizing so many things and beginning, starting to begin to understand things, probably towards not even defi summer. I was clueless in DeFi summer. In 2020, it was like, what is going on? On uniswap? What is this? I had no good ideas in 2020. It wasn't until the end of 21 that curve came online, and the notion of monetary policy, and not just like some relatively trivial token issuance and liquidity, and in hindsight, liquidity was meaningful. What unisoft was creating technologically in what I define as foreign exchange or a foreign exchange venue, which is a bank.
00:36:27.830 - 00:37:03.340, Speaker B: But these monetary policies towards the end of 21 started to present themselves as quite fascinating. And some of my first understandings were, oh, crap. This is what central banks do. How they increase supply over a period of time, how it's inflationary, disinflationary, deflationary. And we quickly saw, like deflationary protocols fail. You can't just decrease supply. It's not necessarily a good thing.
00:37:03.340 - 00:38:00.290, Speaker B: Not necessarily a good thing. And it turns out, most interestingly, the most successful monetary policy is disinflationary, where you're increasing supply over time, and that increase in supply is decreasing over time. And what is the most popular cryptocurrency with a disinflationary monetary policy? That's bitcoin. The supply is increasing every single day of every single block, but that supply increase decreases on a four year cyclical basis. So post 2020 DeFi summer, there has been an experimentation of every single monetary policy combination theoretically possible. There's been 100,000 years of central bank experimentation done in just a mere couple of years. 100,000 years.
00:38:00.290 - 00:38:12.060, Speaker B: It's been a hell of a journey, digesting and really seeing what has been meaningful output of this experimentation.
00:38:12.180 - 00:38:44.560, Speaker C: CK verify is revolutionizing how proofs are verified, making web3 networks faster and more efficient. At its core is a modular system designed to decouple proof verification from execution and settlement layers, offloading the heavy lifting of proof verification to a separate network. CK verify cuts down the associated cost by over 90%, offering huge savings and a more robust network performance for web3 networks. And it is live on Testnet. Visit their website today to learn more.
00:38:45.020 - 00:39:03.330, Speaker A: Absolutely. And where, I guess with DeFi we call it decentralized finance, but I don't know that it's truly decentralized yet, actually. In fact, I know that it is not. Where does decentralization fit in your thesis, if at all? And things like censorship, resistance. Do you, do you care about these properties?
00:39:03.670 - 00:40:20.992, Speaker B: Extraordinary properties? The funny thing is, I am a bitcoin maximalist, which is ironic, I guess, or many people would be like, huh? With regard to money and how I compartmentalize the portfolio into cash and investments. Bitcoin has its place of any gas token, or any collateralizable asset, or any asset that has properties, a degree of moneyness. Bitcoins clearly very significant, very significant. And not just in crypto, but to the world at this point, extraordinary. And that plays into risk profile. So if you have a portfolio of money and investments, the risk profile is everything, because your goal is to survive in markets with a structured portfolio that is heading somewhere, which means capital has to survive the currency expansion and contraction cycles. Bitcoin is imperative to have as cash.
00:40:20.992 - 00:41:33.290, Speaker B: But clearly theres a period of time where the dollar is appreciating significantly more than bitcoin. All you have to do is invert bitcoin versus the dollar to see those periods now, theyre small, maybe a year, a year and a half. But when the dollar goes up 200% against bitcoin, thats meaningful. So its complicated because the cash position needs to be treated as like an FX investor would treat their portfolio of currencies. So bitcoin, ethereum, gas tokens, you need to be cognizant of the value of your relative value of your cash on another part of my brain is always thinking about censorship, resistance and outside money, as Arthur Hayes talks about. And it's very comforting to me to know that I don't have capital in a commercial bank, that it's portable. And I could do many things that I can't do with the us dollar, be it actual dollars, paper dollars or bank deposits.
00:41:33.290 - 00:42:06.530, Speaker B: There is nothing like the portability of bitcoin. It's more portable than paper dollars. For a quantity of value, $100,000 of paper money. There's an actual physical size to it, but there is no physical size to bitcoin. So that portability is extraordinary. And with regard to censorship resistance, that's incredible. That's a remarkable thing.
00:42:06.530 - 00:42:24.590, Speaker B: And it must be that much more remarkable to even wealthier persons like billionaires to have that portability. So it's very important. And this plays into like the l two conversation. So risk is a very meaningful thing.
00:42:25.370 - 00:42:31.270, Speaker A: Absolutely. And what projects are you most excited about today, beyond the ones that you've mentioned so far?
00:42:31.790 - 00:43:30.230, Speaker B: The projects I'm most excited about are the ones that survived 22 and 23. I have interest in new stuff. New stuff has an increased risk profile, max risk, max reward size the positions accordingly. But the stuff that survived 22 and 23, that's crazy because the stuff that survived would not have survived in traditional finance. These commercial banks are running around with impaired balance sheets if they were mark to market without giving a full explanation of the way commercial banking works. These crypto protocols mark to market in real time. So they're literally their balance sheet, the value of the balance sheet, and frankly, the value of everyone's individual position is valued in real time.
00:43:30.230 - 00:44:45.448, Speaker B: There's no hold to maturity concept, and that's crazy. So the liquidation engines that these crypto protocols have created and proven to be resilient in 2022 and 2023, I would say, are technological innovations, to say the least. Commercial banking has worked the way they manage their books and do their accounting. But if they just liquidated the balance sheet, they can't, because it's all fractional reserve. In crypto, you're required to over collateralize debt in the world, it's all under collateralized, which facilitates the capital expansion. So it's really a parallel universe of economics that's really fundamentally based on resiliency. And that resiliency was tested in 22 and 23 and it's even tested to this day by a lot of protocols.

00:45:15.870 - 00:45:28.870, Speaker A: Yeah, as a builder that was those are difficult years but we made it through and multiple bear markets later. And what advice do you have maybe for someone new to investing in their twenties? Any advice for them?
00:45:29.030 - 00:46:28.050, Speaker B: Time. Time is on your side. If you're 40 years old and I tell you a twelve year time horizon, you could change everything financially and you're 52, but if you're 20 with a twelve year time horizon, you're 32. I strongly encourage the youth to spend time understanding the way the world works and financially understand the way the global financial system works. And then maybe with your youthful plasticity in those young brainstor, you'll be like oh my God, look what they're building in these crypto markets. With regard to fintech, with regard to banking, with regard to currencies, with regard to credit systems and foreign exchange markets, it's extraordinary. I am constantly in awe of the real time mark to market properties of the credit markets in the crypto space.
00:46:28.050 - 00:47:30.598, Speaker B: And the younger a person could realize that the more comfortable they would be deploying capital. This is a brilliant investment. This is nothing like anything I could buy on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. Thats a fascinating thing. I often show no coiners. I guess we could use that as a reference like some of these deFi protocol websites. And I so try to put my mind in a perspective of someone that's never seen these websites and I try and remind myself of like college and younger looking at really shady looking websites and I can only imagine they definitely appear like how the heck are they doing this? What is this? How am I getting 500% apr? But they don't understand the mechanics.
00:47:30.598 - 00:48:17.120, Speaker B: They don't understand global financials. And that 500% APR is only 500% because it hasn't been diluted yet. And then you have to assess what is the mechanism that's producing that kind of return. So you need to be cautious, young people of what you're deploying capital to. And that's why audits are meaningful. But you have to understand the mechanics of how these systems work and how the protocols that I often talk about in my stream are extraordinary. And it's real business infrastructure that warrants spending of time to understand.
00:48:18.850 - 00:48:30.910, Speaker A: Absolutely. And it's no small feat. Well, with that, you have a YouTube channel. I would love to give you the opportunity to let listeners know where to find that and also where to find you on social media.
00:48:31.970 - 00:48:53.536, Speaker B: I'm Captain Rational. I am the most rational person in these crypto markets filled with lots of debauchery and mostly insanity. Dj a lot of degeneracy. So I'm on YouTube. Certainly. Captain Rational or Noah Seidman. S e I d m a N.
00:48:53.536 - 00:49:03.140, Speaker B: You find me on X as well, Captain rational. And it will just continue to be rational. That's the only way my brain works.
00:49:03.440 - 00:49:06.420, Speaker A: I like it. You can rebrand to anti degen.
00:49:07.720 - 00:49:08.980, Speaker B: That is the case.
00:49:09.640 - 00:49:12.590, Speaker A: Amazing. And the last question is just how are you defiant.
00:49:12.640 - 00:49:59.338, Speaker B: And its an extraordinary question for someone such as myself. I literally am the antithesis of the way the general public looks at crypto markets. I actually see the crypto markets as deep risking for my capital. If I think about the amount of capital I have in crypto versus equities, I would be scared as crap to have it in equities. And I find my comfort, I find my happy place because of the capital being in these crypto markets. And that's maybe the most incredible expression of defiance I could think of it. I am outside the system.
00:49:59.338 - 00:50:14.640, Speaker B: My capital is protected from the system. My capital is deployed to a market that is accessible to all markets around the world, but of no market around the world. And that's a crazy notion.
00:50:15.260 - 00:50:29.996, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I love that. And I hope many traditional finance folks are listening or even, you know, people that have all of their capital outside of the crypto space. So really appreciate it. Noah, thank you so much for the conversation. I really enjoyed it much.
00:50:30.028 - 00:50:32.060, Speaker B: A pleasure. And thank you for your time. Cheers.
