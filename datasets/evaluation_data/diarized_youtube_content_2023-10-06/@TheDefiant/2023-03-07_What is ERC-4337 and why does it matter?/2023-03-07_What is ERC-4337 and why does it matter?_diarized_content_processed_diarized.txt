Account abstraction is a way to create smart wallets. Instead of being created from a private key or seat phrase, these new wallets are actually smart contracts controlled by a wallet. If your seat phrase is compromised, you can switch to a new wallet and give it access to the AA wallets opening up way to recover lost private keys, something that hasn't been possible until now. Wow. Because they are completely on chain, these new wallets allow for paying fees. With ERC 20 tokens and even none ETH assets, users will be able to do multiple steps in one transaction.
00:00:41.314 - 00:00:43.526, Speaker A: For example, one can swap USDC for.

00:00:44.562 - 00:00:54.300, Speaker A: With ETH in the same transaction. The new tech will enable subscriptions and other preauthorized payments as well as cheaper multisigs. This is the defined follow for more.
