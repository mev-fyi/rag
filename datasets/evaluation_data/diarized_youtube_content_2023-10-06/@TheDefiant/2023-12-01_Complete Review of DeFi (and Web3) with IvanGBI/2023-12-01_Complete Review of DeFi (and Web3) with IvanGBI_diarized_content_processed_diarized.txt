00:00:00.330 - 00:00:27.510, Speaker A: The niche that we are in will stay a niche, but it will be a niche not with 10,000 people, but a niche with 1 million people. And the capital base won't be like 1 trillion today, but 10 trillion. So it will be a niche compared to the stock market or the gold market or the real estate market, but it will be a niche. A niche big enough to have a global impact on communities, creators, and whoever else who could benefit from it. So, again, stay in a niche, but a pretty. A fucking big niche. So let's just keep it that way.
00:00:27.510 - 00:00:44.234, Speaker A: You can always. I think you don't have. You cannot sit on two chairs at once, but you can let your friends sit on another chair. Hi, I'm Ivan. I'm currently in gearbox. I was in crypto since 2017. Have always been on the marketing community sheet, posting side.
00:00:44.234 - 00:01:04.874, Speaker A: So essentially, anything that's not code, because when you do marketing, business development or community things, it's all quite intertwined. It's all about narratives and things. Yeah. Have been with gearbox. I'm one of the first three core contributors. People say co founders sometimes. I just don't like saying it because I feel like people who work on the product and protocol itself are really the co founders.
00:01:04.874 - 00:01:14.340, Speaker A: I'm like the first LARP. Really? Now we have more larps around. But, yeah, also, of course, 24/7 in lobster Dow. It's like a research chat. So no token there, that's just.
00:01:14.710 - 00:01:21.378, Speaker B: We're going to get into lobster Dow in just a moment. I want to ask you, you said 2017. How did you get into crypto?
00:01:21.554 - 00:01:48.238, Speaker A: Like many people, I thought I was a genius investor when I bought some absolute scam coin, made, like, a seven x on it immediately, but it was like, what, $50.07 x? Right. So was good money back then as a student, and then I was like, wow, I'm a genius investor. That was the peak, the end of 2017. Then it turned out I wasn't a genius investor, but I like crypto, it got me involved. So I essentially started working in media back then. So, like, all the media, copywriting things, stuff like that.
00:01:48.238 - 00:02:13.190, Speaker A: Then thought, media. I want to be more involved. As a media, you have to stay in partial, right? Depends. That's what we were chatting five minutes ago, right, for a payment. Just kidding. But, yeah, got on the project size in the Netherlands, stayed in it for about two, three years, and then took a break for, like, half a year, and then thought, okay, let's do it again. So, have been with gearbox since February 2021.
00:02:13.340 - 00:02:17.606, Speaker B: Okay. And you mentioned the Netherlands. You used to live there and now you live where?
00:02:17.708 - 00:02:30.458, Speaker A: In Dubai. But I don't do any lambo, flashy parties, Rolexes. As you can see, I'm wearing nothing. I don't like that. It's just for personal and tax reasons, obviously. There are a few reasons people go there, right?
00:02:30.544 - 00:02:36.410, Speaker B: Yeah. Can you talk to me about that thought process that you had of moving from western Europe to the Middle east?
00:02:36.490 - 00:02:53.646, Speaker A: Yeah. So before jumping into that. Yeah, I came to Netherlands when I was 17 to study. I was on a scholarship there because I presumably was smart at school. Turned out wasn't the case when you talk about european standards. Lived there for about nine years. So I first studied there, then I had some part time jobs.
00:02:53.646 - 00:03:14.058, Speaker A: Then I actually got a proper job. I think I switched a couple. And then at some point it was around COVID time. There were a few reasons, like tax was, of course, one of them. The other one was Netherlands especially, had a pretty terrible COVID response. I didn't like it. UAe, we can say many things about one or the other, right? But it had a very good response to that.
00:03:14.058 - 00:03:30.334, Speaker A: So when I was properly suffocated in Amsterdam, the only place I could go to was Dubai. And later on, I was like, there is a huge expat community. Many founders moved there. Many made their base there. So again, I know what people don't like about it. Right. But there are also things that are nice about it.
00:03:30.334 - 00:03:34.334, Speaker A: Many places have pros and cons, so you kind of have to balance them out. Right?
00:03:34.452 - 00:03:40.370, Speaker B: Absolutely. And you mentioned lobster dow there. Can you give me a brief overview of the origin story, perhaps, and what is it?
00:03:40.440 - 00:03:59.078, Speaker A: Yeah. So back in 2018, around summer, I was still just, like, learning everything. I didn't know what consensus algorithms were. I think I know now, which is a lie. But there was crypto code reviews, chat back in the days, Andre Cronier, who was loved before. Now people, the new ones, seem to be not very much fans of him. I still am.
00:03:59.078 - 00:04:20.010, Speaker A: He had a chat, cryptocurd reviews, where Bantek, Milkey, Kleem, and a few other wire core members at this point were, and they just discussed stuff. And I was asking questions, learning. And also became admin. And Andre, as a creator and as a passionate guy at some point was like, too much publicity. Screw this shit. Just even go delete the chat. I'm like, what? So he deleted the chat.
00:04:20.010 - 00:04:43.254, Speaker A: And then I was like, listen, everybody who was in there still wants to talk, right? And there wasn't any other chat back then because every chat people made was about selling your bags. And the point of that chat was not to do it. So, yeah, I was like, can I just make a chat? Literally the same? He's like, yeah, sure, I don't care. So that's how lobster Dao came around. It was lobster's chat. No, actually, I think we called it lobsterdao from the very beginning. But yeah, it was just.
00:04:43.254 - 00:04:56.970, Speaker A: And that stayed the same for five years. There is no shilling policy. Of course. People who are affiliated and work in projects, they sometimes have a bit of more leeway to talk about what they do. But if you're a new person, or if you ever talk about tickers trades in Ta, none of that is there.
00:04:57.120 - 00:04:59.094, Speaker B: And people can still join.
00:04:59.222 - 00:05:17.710, Speaker A: Yeah, it's totally open. It's totally open. There is like when there was an NFT craze in the middle of 2021, was it? Yeah, people said, make an NFT. I was like, that sounds like a bad idea. A couple really got together, just literally made something. I'm like, even. Can you just add it to them? There was like no mint fee.
00:05:17.710 - 00:05:53.562, Speaker A: Well, except gas fee, but there wasn't any fundraise. So people who were in the chat for a while got the NFT and after some point they said, okay, we'll make like a private chat where NFT holders can be. So it exists, I think out of 2500 holders, or one and a half thousand, it depends, right? Some are bought, some have a couple of wallets. I don't know, 800 are actually in that private chat. There is no alpha per se. But if things that is like what you see in public chats is sometimes people can't openly talk about everything, right? There is a degree of reservation. You have to not really shit on somebody.
00:05:53.562 - 00:06:15.602, Speaker A: Right. You have to be at least people polite there. People go a bit further. So the idea was that people wanted to discuss whatever topics are discussed, but also from the investment perspective, kind of, which is usually a shitstorm if you try to do it in a public chat. So there, people can discuss that. But it has been bear market, so there wasn't much investing to do. Right.
00:06:15.602 - 00:06:40.842, Speaker A: It was mostly building. But yeah, I think later on, if the market picks up, there will be differentiation. So the chat started, as I mentioned, when Andre just said, delete theirs and delete his. And everybody still needed a place to chat and discuss things. Again, not trading, not investing, but more so just economic concepts, governance concepts, dows, whatever. Like all of the conceptual thinking things people try to do. So that's how Lobsterdale started.
00:06:40.842 - 00:07:08.926, Speaker A: So everybody who was in that chat. Many people jumped into that one at this point. They are og, right? It was summer 2018. So people have survived at least one and a half cycles to this point. Yeah, it stayed without shitting, essentially, throughout this time. Because the issue you see with public chats is if you don't have any moderation, it immediately turns into shitstorm. That is how forums were back in the days, right? If a forum has no moderation, as soon as it slightly starts popping off, it's going to be an absolute shitstorm.
00:07:08.926 - 00:07:46.690, Speaker A: That is what happened with what. I don't know who Vitalik was trying to make it with, but there were a few people who started Nakamoto chat on Telegram as well. But moderation is something you need to like. It's a weird thing, right? Like, you know, the discord mod memes, they don't apply to lobster Dow admins, but just that people in lobster Dow, they have work in crypto, so they are by default on telegram, more or less 24/7 so those are admins at the same time. So because there was a core community initially that somewhat shared values, they tried to bring it further. And obviously there is a big degree of subjectivity, but you can't go about. You can't go without it, really.
00:07:46.690 - 00:08:17.494, Speaker A: So a degree of subjectivity and some ethos. I know it's very convoluted. Alignment, right? Alignment, that's the thing, stays there. But it has to be there because subjective topics, when you discuss. And at what point is it overshilling? Right? At what point are you skewing the opinion too much your way without really proper arguments? These are very subjective things. That's why panels are fun, right? Because there is subjectivity from every side being involved. So, yeah, every once a quarter a person jumps in and says, oh, my God, this is terrible.
00:08:17.494 - 00:08:34.126, Speaker A: You're all bad admins. This is just full control. This is authoritarian regime. You don't let people discuss. But somehow, like Dan Robinson from paradigm Uniswap sometimes jumps in. Michael Yegoro from curve is pretty much always there. Andre, when he was more public in Telegram, was there.
00:08:34.126 - 00:09:28.626, Speaker A: He's still there, but not all the time. And a bunch of other founders, because, again, Nakamoto was the only attempt to do it. And they realized quickly that you need people, many people, 24/7 wanted to do this shit, and it has to be for free. As soon as you introduce even a tiny economic incentive in there, it somehow goes bust after a while, I guess. Media, you guys on the media side, right? You also experience that, right? There is a very thin line, a very thin edge, and it's always very unclear at the beginning, but yeah, many projects have sourced the initial community members from lobster Dow because first of all, there are a lot of people, probably from 20,000, though, like at least half a bots, as usually with Internet it goes these days. But yeah, curve finance was one of the projects that kind of launched. It was a very funny story, I think actually defined, had a piece in it three years ago at this point.
00:09:28.626 - 00:10:01.050, Speaker A: Yeah, three years ago at this point where somebody found the contracts. I think it was Igor, who is now in paradigm research. He found the contracts on chain and was like, this looks one to one as the deployment scripts and whatever on GitHub. And then he asked about it and people in curves related to curve said, no, no, it wasn't. So he was like, okay, whatever. And then a few hours later, it really looks the same. And then some curve members were in the chat and they were like, we don't know, maybe somebody deployed it because the way it was done is practically anybody could deploy it.
00:10:01.050 - 00:10:18.820, Speaker A: But people, it was new that somebody would just randomly deploy. So people didn't believe in it. And it all happened during the night of Europe. It was around from 12:00 a.m. I mean, from midnight in central Europe to about 09:00 a.m. It was that shitstorm happening and it was happening all in lobster Dow chat. Yeah.
00:10:18.820 - 00:10:35.926, Speaker A: Then people realized that, wow, these contracts are there. They are somewhat real. There was a bigger belief that they're real. Then people saw that the farming starts in a few hours. I think it was a few hours after deployment. It wasn't exactly immediately. And then, yeah, front end wasn't exactly up for a couple of hours.
00:10:35.926 - 00:10:47.094, Speaker A: When the front end launches on Mainet, it's always buggy. So I need to give it a couple of hours. And then, yeah, then it picked up and a few people still didn't believe in it for a day or two. What do you mean just randomly launch?
00:10:47.142 - 00:10:53.582, Speaker B: I want to ask you if that's one of the major milestones and achievements and highlights, what's one of the low.
00:10:53.636 - 00:11:36.122, Speaker A: Points difference between community and organization. In organization, you can expect something concrete or at least try to make something concrete in communities. As soon as you turn communities from the abstract, chaotic thing, which is only kept by a few ethos lines and a few expectations and a few people maybe then it becomes a shit storm. So, yeah, that's why I guess in the main chat there was never any issue because there was never a push to do something concrete, because if you have something concrete, like with protocols, right, immediately, if you fail, expectations, that is a low point here. The only expectation is how much alpha and interest in stuff gets shared. And that is cyclical with the market. When the market is down, hundreds of people are just building.
00:11:36.122 - 00:11:59.266, Speaker A: There is lack of publicity, there is lack of things done publicly. Devs are just Devin and at the top, I guess a low point, at the high point can be, is that too much spam gets shared, because people are, oh, my God, there's a food farmer, there's this farm. There's something else. But in lobster dow, there's not that much of it. I would say I'm pretty happy with how things have been, but 24/7 crawling the chat, five years. True.
00:11:59.368 - 00:12:00.942, Speaker B: Maybe you can introduce gear dow.
00:12:01.006 - 00:12:23.274, Speaker A: So gearbox is. There are a few ways to describe it. It's like an on chain credit protocol or composable leverage protocol. The way we have found to be really clicking with people and easier to understand. It is like, imagine if your leveraged wallet had ten x the amount of funds in it. So, like, you boost your wallet, supercharge your wallet. There are a bunch of technical, conceptual things, but the idea is that you get leveraged in a non isolated way.
00:12:23.274 - 00:12:47.838, Speaker A: Essentially, you get more capital, and then you go trade, farm, make positions, make whatever you want in a fully composable way. Meaning you can make positions, interact with each other in whatever. Unlike vaults, which are pretty much deposit and weight, or perpetuals, which are pretty much open position, and just balance it here. It's more about full user freedom to do with that. More capital, whatever you want, whatever, within permissions. And there, it gets a bit more technical.
00:12:47.934 - 00:12:53.170, Speaker B: Okay. And as an individual who's been in this space for quite a while, what's your favorite aspect of gearbox, then?
00:12:53.240 - 00:13:12.554, Speaker A: Composability. Composability gets frowned upon, because the more composable you are, it's like you are as strong. How do they say it? You're as weak as the weakest chain in the link. Or you're as strong as the weakest. It's one of those two. Yeah, that's the point. So composability has that downside, but without composability, I would say crypto wouldn't have happened.
00:13:12.554 - 00:13:31.066, Speaker A: Right. The entire point why this is all cool is because it's open, interacts with each other, and so on. So that's what I liked about gearbox, because I have been investing. Investing is a strong word, right? Like shitcoin, Angelin of course, the founders I like, they're not shitcoins. I just call it that way. Right. To me, everything, not Ethan BTC is a shitcoin.
00:13:31.066 - 00:13:48.962, Speaker A: Gear included is that. I've seen enough narratives. I see the narratives all the time. Because when you're on BD marketing side, you need to understand narratives. You are in them as well. So I would say it plays well with just other startups. So, in the last three years, I haven't seen anything where I would be like, I would jump into that.
00:13:48.962 - 00:14:13.206, Speaker A: Like, I would just reach out. No, I still think gearbox has a. It's a very composable protocol. It's generalized, meaning you can do a bunch of different things, and you can twist parts of its modular stack so much that you just get all leverage. Farming or margin trading without perpetuals or house trading against you. Or you can do like, composable vaults, position rebalancing, you can rebuild unibot or these bots without having the key security. Key management, security issues.
00:14:13.206 - 00:14:20.062, Speaker A: So because it's so composable and you can play around and twist it, I don't think it will get boring anytime soon.
00:14:20.116 - 00:14:26.158, Speaker B: Yeah, very interesting. And you mentioned narratives there, so I'm curious which narratives you're following at the moment in the defi space?
00:14:26.244 - 00:14:45.906, Speaker A: When it comes to deFi, I feel like a bunch of concepts were already built to a decent extent, reasonably well. So you can always re optimize it. You can do gas optimization. You can make fees lower, you can make capital efficiency higher. Not sure that is a one X improvement or like, okay, one x improvement makes no sense. 1.1 x improvement.
00:14:45.906 - 00:14:58.634, Speaker A: Right. Rather than a ten x. So ten X. I don't know what. There are a few narratives within DFI that are pretty much like, have been there for a few years already. One of them, let's say. Let's start with the least used one.
00:14:58.634 - 00:15:18.782, Speaker A: Options. Right? There was some options hype, I think. Apart from a few people on derivatives, nobody does that yet. Right? Perpetuals now picked up a bit more, but mostly a lot reasoning. I guess there is, because every different layer two gives rewards to that. So volumes pick up for complex instruments to be used. I feel like market needs to get more sophisticated.
00:15:18.782 - 00:15:45.734, Speaker A: How much sophistication do we get? Every second trader is a djen at the same time. Farming and shitcoining, right? That's not market sophistication. There are no interest rate swaps in crypto because there are no concurrent yield sources. Right? It's all cyclical. It's all based on volatility as such, it's all based on funding rates. And that all follows one another, right? There is no different segments within defi. It's just like all cyclical.
00:15:45.734 - 00:16:09.634, Speaker A: So cycle up, everybody loves protocol. Cycle down, zero gets used. In normal financial world, it's a bit more like dispersed. Right? You have even value stocks which work during the bad market. You have the growth stocks in a different way, you have a few different ones, and then the flows among them can work differently. In crypto, it's pretty much just like all goes together, right? It's all correlated really for now. So that's why maybe a lot of these things were built but are not being used.
00:16:09.634 - 00:16:14.238, Speaker A: It doesn't mean they have to be rebuilt, just that it was a bad timing for them to launch.
00:16:14.334 - 00:16:24.280, Speaker B: Okay, is that your main frustration? If you observe the defi space you mentioned, market sophistication and a few more points there, what would you say is the main frustration you have?
00:16:25.690 - 00:17:04.562, Speaker A: I can give a boring reply to that. I'm more like a very concrete one. Is the ux, right? Well, that's interesting to discuss, because UX in this case is when you talk about DeFi. When a team starts something due to how fundraising works and narratives work, they need to make the narrative as large as possible, right? Do you buy an infrastructure coin or do you buy an interface coin? Interface coin. Haven't done that well, right? Kind of fat layer thesis has done much better. So at the start, you have to push yourself as a protocol, as generalized, composable. I'm not comparing the gearbox, but to an extent, I wasn't saying what was the reason, but you do start doing that once you've done it.
00:17:04.562 - 00:17:31.018, Speaker A: You have to have actually users. So you need products built on top of your protocols that obfuscate all of that complexity, modularity and whatever into one single button, right? Not hundred buttons and interface. It's like Google or Uniswap. It's one. And to do that, once you have been, let's say, you focus two years on the protocol as generalized integrations for everything, right? All of that, blah blah blah, not blah, blah, blah, very concrete blah, blah. But still, it's not a one button. And then you literally have to change your focus into one button thing.
00:17:31.018 - 00:17:57.938, Speaker A: And that's the issue, that switching from that to that, first of all, is difficult. Second, it takes a lot of time. So if you look into the fundraising cycle, even if you did like seed private series A, it's only barely enough to actually finish it all. And by the end of the time, if you are not ready. You might not be having the chance anymore. And then the new team that starts it, they actually start from protocol, narrative, big moon thing. Again, they have fallen to the same issue.
00:17:57.938 - 00:18:14.166, Speaker A: So nobody ever looks at the end of the UX. And the UX is only looked by smaller teams who don't have maybe the capabilities to do a huge fundraise. And then as a result they may be underfunded. So it's a bit of a. I would say it's the fault of the venture. It's not fault, right. It's more that it's an incentive.
00:18:14.166 - 00:18:38.894, Speaker A: Show me the incentives, I show you the outcome. Right. Because of how venture cycles work. That is why everybody's focusing on the big thing. Nobody works on the small thing that actually drives users. I guess Ethereum foundation actually recognizes that and also looks at that one, right? Many of the grants are focused on that account abstraction, social recovery. All of that is focused on attracting the layman user, if you were to say so, like a normal user.
00:18:38.894 - 00:19:39.038, Speaker A: So I wouldn't say there is anything that crypto people aren't working on that needs to be worked on, just that you can change focus. But as like this cycle shows, right, too much infra market goes down because no users applications pop up, right? And then it goes like, I mean, you can imagine whatever, something like that. I think people turn governance and lack apathy governance as a frustration or is an issue to solve. I'm not sure it's something that needs solving because it's not like you have 100% of the population voting in the real world, right? So, okay, if you want to fix that, go fix that first. That's more important than protocol governance, right? Let's be honest, country politics are more important to everyday's lives than a protocol. Not saying you should discard one over the other, but still, it's pretty obvious that this is the case. The point is, governance in DeFi or whatever protocols is open, right? So you can't technically go buy back or get it acquired somewhere else or get it delegated or work and get it right for a grant different ways, and then you can go vote, obviously, because these protocols are finance related.
00:19:39.038 - 00:20:13.886, Speaker A: The more tokens you have, the more weight you should hold. Like this is finance related, right? These are not social things. So if it's money related, the bigger money back should speak. So when people say like, oh, it's the rich get richer, or it's the plutocracy or whatever, these are finance protocols. That's how it's supposed to be like shareholders in the real world, I'm not sure it should be different if you talk about protocols, if they would be social related, like maybe ens, right? You've seen the recent thing with Ens and unstoppable domains clash again, I guess. Yeah, there, it might make sense not to just have fully money driven decisions. It's more ethos, reputation based.
00:20:13.886 - 00:20:30.434, Speaker A: But in DFI, I don't think it should be different. People say, oh, but only 50 people vote and only who understand it. Okay, but it's open, right? You can't get involved, you can't do it. You don't need 500 people voting again. They can. You need to solve it per se. You can solve it by making it gasless.
00:20:30.434 - 00:20:59.946, Speaker A: You can solve it by making the barrier to introduced lower, by having very open documentation, having good onboarding funnel and everything that should be done in general. But you don't really have to go around and say, please go vote, please go vote. No, you don't want to vote, don't vote. It's fine. Because as we have seen, once there is in governance, once there is the topic that is really edgy, somehow governance pops up, right? Somehow people actually go and they vote. Maybe it's just many of the votes that happen. People say, oh, it's the team deciding.
00:20:59.946 - 00:21:13.518, Speaker A: Well, not team, but like contributors, it's because they care. And others, they can just not care and then it just goes by. Right. But if a topic really needs discussion, usually people somewhat have a look and like, okay, this needs discussion. The rest let it flow.
00:21:13.614 - 00:21:18.558, Speaker B: So you think it should be left to its organic way of proceeding?
00:21:18.654 - 00:21:50.590, Speaker A: I don't think you need thousands of voters, because end of the day, the thing is that even in real world, even if you have like two x people voting, these people are still driven by the same marketing, they see everywhere, by the same ideas. And of course, people are all unique, but there are still subgroups within them, right? So if there are the same number of subgroups, but more people, doesn't practically change anything, right? Of course it's great if there are, but if there are not, outcome is not going to be practically different. So if you have like thousands of people votes in, sure. I mean, in 99% of cases, the outcome will be exactly the same.
00:21:50.660 - 00:21:52.590, Speaker B: What are your thoughts on token utility?
00:21:54.150 - 00:22:17.670, Speaker A: Last cycle before that, token utility did not exist, right? I mean, maker had token utility from someone to start anybody else. It was nothing, right? Gas fees, I guess, right? It was an easy way out. Gas fees was the easy way out. You are layer one blockchain what is your token needed for? Oh, you stake it and you get more. Great. Who is going to stake it and pay contraction fees? Own somebody else building on top of us. Okay, can get out.
00:22:17.670 - 00:23:01.346, Speaker A: But if you're not a layer one and you don't really have gas fees, like who? That's what's then. And I guess an easy escape was governance, right? It's something that you can have from day zero. It is quite important. It's not bullshit, it's not exactly this thing people want to see, but it is important. It's just that the question is, if there is something that you're governing as valuable, how is value coming in? And people ask what about revenue sharing and stuff? I think it depends per protocol, right? Social protocols like ENs, maybe they should just stay on governance because this is like a public good, and public good needs to be decided by a few parties. Like governance protocols. You can to an extent make it governless, right? Like uniswap pools are governless.
00:23:01.346 - 00:23:30.986, Speaker A: So you could do that. It's just that for lensing protocols and a few others, there are a bunch of parameters involved in composability that probably some degree of intervention, again not centralization, just intervention might stay. It will be becoming less and less, which is what everybody is working towards. It's just not today. But probably those tokens, whether they're in a staked form or like staking module in avarrite or the VCRV incurr, which is like time based or some other models. Point is revenues coming in. Defi is finance.
00:23:30.986 - 00:23:58.578, Speaker A: Finance takes fees, finance is money. So if you're involved in that, it's logical for you to expect money. Just revenue sharing makes no sense once protocols make hundred bucks a day, right? Like how much are you going to share? The only ones that could have shared would uidx. But let's not touch upon that just yet. They probably would have if they could, but maybe not. I don't want to completely support them, but also don't want to shit on it. The other ones were GMX, that was doing it, right, the feedback loop.
00:23:58.578 - 00:24:32.978, Speaker A: I think revenue sharing for Defi is where people would want to see it go and where it probably should go. If you look into social again, maybe governance is enough to be there. If you look into protocols while they are staking for reputation or whatever, like restaking, right, whatnot. Maybe that's a fine use case to be at. And you can always add stuff on top, like extra fees from something. So I just feel like it's early, there are no revenues, there are no concrete use cases, there are lack of users. You can't do revenue sharing or really fully figure out where the economic substance is because it's still early.
00:24:32.978 - 00:25:01.082, Speaker A: Like, a lot of work has been done, but it's still a long way to go. What's important, I feel like, is that many teams are working on cool stuff. Many teams have concrete vision of where they need to be. They check that vision with how adoption cycles maybe should be going. So it's not just abstract like, oh, we're going to make a protocol and then everybody's going to reach, and then hunger is going to be solved around the world. No, it's pretty concrete things. Many different segments are working on for user adoption, for Defi rails, for other stuff.
00:25:01.082 - 00:25:29.366, Speaker A: So pretty positive on all of it. Yeah. If you don't know where the yield is coming from, you are the yield, as they say in crypto. Because if you look at RBA, RBA gives you sustainable yield, like corporate bonds, right? Because companies are working, they're generating revenue, whatever. There is some distribution, there are some yields being paid, and that is somewhat regardless of the market cycle. Of course, the price of the bond can vary, but the yield usually is based on the coupon. You have, of course, a bunch of risks in there.
00:25:29.366 - 00:25:54.458, Speaker A: But the point is, regardless of the cycles, as we mentioned before, there are many different instruments which have lesser or high yield, regardless of what cycle it is. But that means there is constant flow, there are constant things to do, there are constant things to rebalance. With crypto, it's a very cyclical market. Coin go up, many users, everybody happy. Coin go down, zero users, nobody happy. Everything is wrecked. Like funding rates.
00:25:54.458 - 00:26:21.750, Speaker A: Because of that, volatility is the driver of the yields, right. Essentially funding rates. So last cycle, I think funding rates for BTC and ETH loan were like or short. Were like what? Even at 100%, right. 50 plus on centralized exchanges in the past few months, it was about 510. So it's a huge collapse. Usually they should be about 10% plus 20, right, 30 good range, perpetual dexes and D five protocols.
00:26:21.750 - 00:26:48.462, Speaker A: So far, perpetual is exceptionally having about three x in the funding rate compared to sexes, right? Because again, the bigger the books, the lower you give. The smaller the books, the more you give, because you have to balance it out. Crypto, for now, is still based on the cycles because most of the yield. Why do people pay lending rate? Because they borrow. Loop, whatever. Hedge, why do they hedge? Why do they borrow? Because there is a lot of money being made a lot of volatility. So it all comes back to that.
00:26:48.516 - 00:26:51.274, Speaker B: What do you think about the sustainability of yield?
00:26:51.402 - 00:27:15.254, Speaker A: So, sustainability of yield depends on the different activities that are done within the space. And crypto for now is only based on volatility. And like coin go up, coin go down. When coin go down, funding rates are terribly low. Coin go up, funding rates are insanely high, 50% plus. So it's a really huge discrepancy, and there is no recurring activity, recurring yield. Like, for example, corporate bonds paying you for capital, right? Which is like just fixed rate, or like SME lending, which is fixed rate.
00:27:15.254 - 00:27:39.354, Speaker A: The underlying can fluctuate, but the rates are based on the coupons. Crypto doesn't have that, right. So it is fully based on up, down, up, down. So when it's down, yields are ass really bad. When it's up, yields are insane. Entire tradfi wants to put their mothers into crypto and deposit everything they have and take bank loans like they have before. I'm not sure how exactly crypto will get to the point of having sustainable revenues.
00:27:39.354 - 00:28:06.630, Speaker A: Because for yields to be sustainable, need to have revenues, right. There needs to be sustainable businesses to an extent, because if you only base it on volatility, all of the yields will slowly collapse. Right. Nobody's buying options out of the normal price range anymore. The yields are lower, everything is lower, activity is lower. So it's again cyclical. You would need to have companies actually having products actually with recurring revenues for these flows to be more consecutive and stable and repeatable.
00:28:06.630 - 00:28:35.006, Speaker A: I'm not sure next cycle will bring that just yet. This cycle already we have obfuscated funding rates into different segments already. Of course, a lot of it is based on the token emissions, because again, it's still only a few thousand users really, who are using it. Liquidity is still very small. You still need to bootstrap it. There are still not really huge revenues happening. So token bootstrap is a big thing, which is okay, right? It lets people take part in something new.
00:28:35.006 - 00:28:57.298, Speaker A: And if their bet is right, or if the protocols they hold are good, then yeah, fantastic. If not, well, they can always be consecutively selling the yield. So, yeah, yields are not sustainable in crypto. I'm not sure if they exactly can be. If more rea is brought into crypto, that of course makes that more sustainable. Right. It will not be crypto native, but it will be taken from the outsource.
00:28:57.298 - 00:29:32.994, Speaker A: An interesting trend in defi and how it was happening before compared now is before you had pools, right? And you were mostly pool to pool or person to pool because it was easier to aggregate liquidity and easier to aggregate demand and supply side, how lending protocols were, how amms were now, because the space still grew, it's still small, but it still grew. It's easier to do p to p stuff. Meaning there are a bunch of different offers on demand side. A bunch of different offers on the supply side means you can do RFQ request. Actually, I don't know how RFQ abbreviation goes. Anyway, RFQ based. We can check that later.
00:29:32.994 - 00:30:17.794, Speaker A: So it's like this intents, right? Like I intend to trade something at this price or within this price range. I intend to lend something within this API, whatever. And such things can be even more composable without freezing the assets at one point in time. And also the trades can be done easier and can also be done cheaper. For example, you can just do gasless transactions as they have been with cowswap and one inch fusion in the last few months, because the gas fee can be obfuscated or taken into the slippage or rather the spread. However, you correctly pointed out that makes user experience better, because you, for example, wouldn't even need to have gas fees even for that. So if you have account abstracted wallets, you don't even need to sponsor transactions like SNX has done it with argent back when it just popped up in around 2021.
00:30:17.794 - 00:31:00.446, Speaker A: You can just not do that even in the first place, and it is just obfuscated. It is a question of how decentralized that is, because all of this intents and whatever trades and routes and are done by solvers who are pretty much prop desks to an extent. So you are centralizing it. And the question is how open that I'm going to be really perverse in the terms here, like not the mempool really, but the pool of where the intents are aggregated, how many people, and how open that space is. If it is fully open, it's fine that it's being sold by a few parties, but if, like with flashbots to an extent, more and more is kind of centralized, sure, that is the exact way to go. But it is better for user experience, essentially, yes. So I'm not as big brain to understand that that much.
00:31:00.446 - 00:31:58.260, Speaker A: It's just an interesting thing to see. It does make applications more user friendly without doing much, and it does make cross chain interactions also easier, because again, if you just all bundle it into intent, that is semi off chain stuff, even if it is on chain. So a lot of shortcuts can be made in order to make user experience still better. When I got in this space I was introduced to Ledger and been okay with it ever since. I'm not sure if getting so I'm not a hardware guy nor a software guy already, to be honest. But I'm not sure if getting like the new new ones ledger are really safe because maybe in the past few years after crypto grew, some stuff at the factory could be like inputted. But then if that was really possible before, you could just fix it with forcing an update on it, right? So I'm not sure if that exactly makes a difference, but I would just try to buy every industry gets the word centralization right? Like them try now to say oh, AI needs to be controlled, so the early stuff is always more pure than what happens later.
00:31:58.950 - 00:32:01.710, Speaker B: So get yourself an old school first generation ledger.
00:32:01.790 - 00:32:25.222, Speaker A: I'm not sure they even sell, I mean, even if they sell those anymore. It depends on how back in the days they were made. If it's a new print run, even if it is not discontinued, I'm not sure that makes sense. I don't know hardware and software connections that deep enough. But I would think that what was done before was done by people who were before decentralization. So there is a higher chance of nothing shitty being then there with the new stuff. Yeah, I would say there is a higher degree.
00:32:25.222 - 00:33:22.422, Speaker A: It's a bit of a tinfoil hat on, but yeah, ledger, I've never done treasure and I think it's fine because I guess in the past three years there have been a few cases where they said, listen, treasury is somewhat easier, penetrative will compare to ledger. But the best way to go with this is what people say is you make safe accounts just with a few wallets of your own. And what is easier when you try to, let's say you want to change a ledger or you somehow accidentally messed up your private key and copy pasted it somewhere, you can just replace that wallet, right? So your address, like your smart contract account on a safe, is the same. You just change the signers so you can change jurisdiction, your metamask, whatever you want. You change the signers, but the thing stays the same so you don't have to always migrate the funds. It's a bit harder to manage. But again, if you're talking about ultimate security safe with a few signers, even if they are yourself, it's just a better ux friendly way for yourself once you try to transition.
00:33:22.422 - 00:33:38.802, Speaker A: Because you probably had a wallet, right? And then you transitioned to a new one because your computer was breached, right. Some virus was installed. You need to send all of your shit coins to a new one, right. There is a service that I think now helps it on chain to send a few at a time. But again here you don't need to do it. You don't. And you can make it as safe as possible.
00:33:38.802 - 00:33:49.798, Speaker A: You can later on introduce signers that I don't know, your lawyer, your grandmother, your family members and it would still be in there. You don't need to always move. Which is, I guess better. Ux. Yeah.
00:33:49.884 - 00:33:54.418, Speaker B: And speaking of cycles, are we out of the bear market when bull?
00:33:54.594 - 00:34:30.610, Speaker A: I have no clue. I probably put a target for myself that if there is no bull by, let's say autumn 2025, I'd like consider not spending that much time on crypto because we are of course dependent on cycles. I'm not talking about BTC being at 1 million, but it would stay at the same level without new segments popping up. Right. It's one thing where BTC and ETH just stay flat and a bunch of new segments pop up and the industry grows. Usually growth of the industries is still fueled by a few core ones going high. So that doesn't happen from at this point beginning of 2020, 2025.
00:34:30.610 - 00:34:51.794, Speaker A: Pretty much that four year thing that people believe in. It's not that you need to believe in, it's just that capital also runs out. Right. Many of the protocols. So apps already run out of capital, right. Protocols are give or take two years runaway, which is still good foundations like layer ones and layer twos. No, they have funded for the next 200 years so they will survive and they will keep doing the grants.
00:34:51.794 - 00:35:14.334, Speaker A: But something will need to be done, right. They're not going to have the money for the next five years. So in the next two, three, nothing happens. Teams will be like, maybe I'm like in their own space, right? A lot of people did leave for AI, right? That's not a joke. A lot of people did go into AI. A bunch of devs at the hackathon are also doing somewhat AI things. Devs also like new shiny shit, right? It's not only shitcoiners like us that like new shiny stuff.
00:35:14.334 - 00:35:25.586, Speaker A: They also like to work on new shiny stuff. If no new user comes into your old thing before for like consecutively four years, it's not really fun to work on it. I'm not a deaf, I'm just paraphrasing what they say.
00:35:25.688 - 00:35:32.982, Speaker B: What excites you about the crypto space then in the next few years, what are the narratives that really think what you think could drive some change.
00:35:33.116 - 00:35:55.680, Speaker A: Yep. So I feel like DeFi still will be the main. Because end of the day, if it is an industry which is insanely connected to finance, right. All of the infrastructure, the gas fees, whatever, even if you obfuscate it and abstract from end users, it's still going to be the underlying thing. So DeFi is basically the finance implementation of it all. So if the industry leave, finance will grow with it really hard. And that's what DeFi is.
00:35:55.680 - 00:36:11.570, Speaker A: So that's why I'm still in DeFi. I think it's going to be not the biggest, but it's not going to go anywhere. Other things that are interesting is do we count infra as a different thing? I guess so. Right. But infra is there to enable DeFi and other use cases. Right. So I'm not sure if we.
00:36:11.640 - 00:36:13.010, Speaker B: It's part of a great to hold.
00:36:13.160 - 00:36:44.702, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I don't think I believe in social that much, to be honest. Like whenever farcast or somebody else does it, like, oh, we're going to make a new decentralized social media. I believe in the thing that is related to the gas fees kind of thing. Right. If you're a bitcoin holder, people were saying all like ethereum, right? Oh, why would you use it if you only have $10? Yeah. You don't use the main layer, then it's obvious you don't use it if you have $10, it's for the more valuable the thing you have is, the higher you're going to pay to move it or to store it, which is obvious.
00:36:44.702 - 00:37:03.778, Speaker A: For some social cases it can be obfuscated, but social cases like your tweet or your message, doesn't really carry that much economic substance in it. Right. Of course people can say, oh, the first week of Jack on Twitter was sold for how much? The meme thing. It was like a one or $2 million. Right. When he was trying to sell tweets or something.
00:37:03.864 - 00:37:14.370, Speaker B: I'm not sure about the numbers. No. But I'm curious actually, on this point, why you think then if these numbers are being generated, why will social fine not survive?
00:37:14.450 - 00:37:45.046, Speaker A: No social fine, just social stuff. Right? Like decentralized media or other things. Not to say anything bad about the teams working on it, it's just that Ux is a huge pain point and decentralized systems, I don't know. However you abstract it, are going to be worse than centralized ones. Right. Whenever you get a new iPhone these days, you can immediately feel how zero, zero 1 second it is faster than your old. And you see that as a user, right? Decentralized stuff has this day trelemma again, I'm not illuminati just pointed out it's a different thing for the same purpose, or rather this different purpose.
00:37:45.046 - 00:38:06.694, Speaker A: The same thing. Yeah. You kind of just make it faster, right? Like decentralized exchanges are not going to be as efficient as centralized one, going to be always slightly worse. They have other pros and cons. And I just don't feel like your tweets or your media presence is something you really hold on to. Except the big influencers. But the big influencers, like, I don't know, what is it? Mr.
00:38:06.694 - 00:38:39.998, Speaker A: Beast on YouTube, right. TikTokers and whatever. I believe that's where more users will be. Because you always, like, if you look at adoption, right, the most regulated, the most mainstream things are very centralized because governments or whatever, blah blah, whoever you want to blame want to have control over it. That's where 90% of users will be. And for social media it has to aggregate towards that. So if you only have a few users on the decentralized one, sure it can live like no issue, right? It's like D five will probably be to not protocols, right? But to an extent, interfaces, whatever will be to largest and regulated.
00:38:39.998 - 00:38:54.358, Speaker A: So a lot of capital will be. It doesn't mean that the small part of it won't be still huge. I just had to compare it. It will be smaller. And I feel like for social media you really have to be the biggest one because if you're the smaller one, it's not that fun, right. You need to interact. It's social.
00:38:54.358 - 00:39:04.838, Speaker A: So that's why I don't buy that much into it. I don't know, but I can see why people are working it. I can see, or at least I can imagine if your use case has been very valuable. Just not really my kink.
00:39:04.934 - 00:39:11.990, Speaker B: Social maybe isn't very high on your list of narratives to follow. What about Gamefi? What about Rwas? Is there anything else on your radar?
00:39:12.070 - 00:39:43.270, Speaker A: Yeah, so RWAs, all of this on chain tables, right? SME lens and whatnot. I had a couple of bags, I guess. And good teams, like, I would say many teams who are surviving to this point are pretty good and genuine, with some small exceptions. But it's not as was in the bull market. RVA, I believe in it from the perspective it will be there because that is where bankers and managers make their money. So if there is something they can make more money on without changing their business, they'll do it, right? So they just slide it in, basically. So there is no reason not to have it.
00:39:43.270 - 00:40:08.766, Speaker A: Do I like it or not? No. I think probably in Defi, the next big boom, I guess, and the next big huge bust will be due to some centralized underwriter, not properly done. Like SBF was, right, completely wrecked in it, all the shit. I believe that is very much going to happen. But not today, not tomorrow. We already see it happening in small things. It's just that when a credit collapse would happen, maybe again, crypto would be much more exposed to it.
00:40:08.766 - 00:40:34.054, Speaker A: Right, because it won't have like a thousand participants, like in real world to be like only a few. And being one of a few is worse than one of a thousand failing for the industry as a whole. What other stuff within defi? Options, perps and other sophisticated stuff right there. I believe they weren't done not because protocols were bad, but because market does not have enough sophistication. Same goes for interest rate swaps. Whatever instruments you have in real world can totally be done in crypto. Almost in the same way.
00:40:34.054 - 00:41:04.318, Speaker A: Maybe just architecturally different, more composable. But for now, I believe there are only a few thousand users who are active every day who really know why they need Defi and whatever, and there is not enough sophistication for other things to be there. As for gamify, a bunch of my friends are like hardcore on gamify. They still believe in it. I'm not really a huge gamer myself. Like, I mean, I play Fortnite 6 hours every day, which sounds like I'm a nerd. Yes, but that's it.
00:41:04.318 - 00:41:24.422, Speaker A: The other games I played were just like, I played magic. The gathering. Back in the days, like a lot, a lot. My entire university was wasted on that literature. I played also 6 hours a day. I didn't study at all. Now we have, like for gamify, we have games trying to be done with this, what, steam, but fully composable tune games there.
00:41:24.422 - 00:42:03.198, Speaker A: I feel like it's an issue of incentives, alignment. Why would you make it composable with other games if you can always sell new? It's better to constrict marketplaces between each other for the purposes of companies making revenue, and people often disagree with it. And then you can use a prime example of magic gathering, where you have to balance the two, right? You have to print new cards, because that's where revenue of the company comes. As well as collectors. It's called trading collectible game or TCG. Right, trading collectible game whatever. And the collectible part is if you overprint, which is what Hasbro has done in the past three years, all the prices of cars, they completely tank.
00:42:03.198 - 00:42:27.386, Speaker A: And then people really hate it. So there is a balance. But yeah, I can see those two things work. There are projects working on this which are cool, like unchained God was before. Right? Parallel being now in gamify normal. I know there are a bunch of games. I'm not such a gamer to really tell the difference between Fortnite, counter Strike, League of Legends, right? There are many different segments, but I'm not sure why.
00:42:27.386 - 00:42:33.214, Speaker A: I get it when people say why they need to be decentralized. I'm not sure I as a gamer even care.
00:42:33.412 - 00:43:03.398, Speaker B: Right. This is actually something that came up in a few conversations where the people that we're trying to onboard to bring into the space. In a way the sort of prevailing consensus is that they shouldn't even know the underlying technology that they're interacting with. If it's a game and we want to use Gamefi as perhaps a way to onboard more people, it should just be a fun game that people want to play. And they shouldn't know that they're using a blockchain technology or using various forms of technology that underlies it. What are your thoughts on that?
00:43:03.564 - 00:43:39.122, Speaker A: Makes sense, I think for Defi and finance, even in the real world, people who engage with it, unless they're putting in some mutual funds, they still kind of get it, right. If you buy people like normal people who have jobs, like we do have jobs, like normal people within. Outside of the space, when they put something in T bills, they somewhat learn what T bills are, right? Especially all the shit and finance has been happening in the past. What is it, three years? A lot of people got more educated on where their money actually is, how it works. So that is progressing. And so in Defi, I don't think you of course have to abstract it from the user to make it easier. But people will be learning about it anyway.
00:43:39.122 - 00:44:12.554, Speaker A: So it's fine for games. I don't think they need to be learning the blockchain right here. It's finance. So you need to know what finance does in game. You don't need to know how thing behind it happens and the transactions, whatever that has to be obfuscated. And I guess it would work for a few very specific game genres, right? For some games you don't need to do it. I feel like the games that have been successful apart from maybe parallel to an extent, a few others these days are not shilling, although I do have a back, is that they're trying to bring this AAA games to blockchain and just say, this is now going to be AA on the blockchain.
00:44:12.554 - 00:44:38.020, Speaker A: I don't think it should be done. Maybe the games that were successful were related to, like Gamify, like Fugazi. Fugazi gambling related with games that I can see because it's different from real world. Now, whether that has a huge player penetration or not, I don't know. I'm not an expert in this, but that is unique, so people get drawn to it. If you just say, we have legal legends on the blockchain, I don't think that entices anybody. Right.
00:44:38.020 - 00:44:53.750, Speaker A: Oh, your character is now fully decentralized and you can sell your stuff. If they want to sell, they'll find ways to sell. Right. It's steam. Right. The marketplace thing, if that allows to sell and people can trade it enough, you can sell codes or whatever. It works to an extent.
00:44:53.750 - 00:44:57.066, Speaker A: It doesn't fully efficiently work, maybe because it doesn't need to.
00:44:57.168 - 00:45:02.042, Speaker B: You mentioned bags there, so I'm going to bring our attention back to it. What's your biggest bag at the moment?
00:45:02.176 - 00:45:36.610, Speaker A: I mean, gearbox. Right. But again, if you count what is invested as a biggest bag, I try to the angel check solo in a similar range. I don't do that many, so I don't like invest all around, like SBF style. I have quite a few projects, like, I would say couple a quarter, which I wouldn't say that often, most in defi, because I don't like investing when I don't understand what I do. And of course there have been investments where I wasn't really helpful. As an angel happens, I feel bad about it, but usually I try to offer some perspective or expertise, if I had any or some opinion.
00:45:36.610 - 00:45:39.974, Speaker A: So because I do G five, it's mostly related to G five.
00:45:40.012 - 00:45:41.062, Speaker B: Mostly in the defi space.
00:45:41.116 - 00:45:41.286, Speaker A: Okay.
00:45:41.308 - 00:45:43.114, Speaker B: And can you share any alpha right now?
00:45:43.232 - 00:45:52.074, Speaker A: It is related to what we discussed. Right. The narratives, I think are interesting. Of course, the bags would be related to that. Put your mouth where your money is.
00:45:52.192 - 00:45:53.382, Speaker B: Money where your mouth.
00:45:53.526 - 00:46:01.742, Speaker A: Yep. Okay. That also sounds good. Yeah. Put your mouth wherever. So it makes you money. That's a different way to twist know bear market makes us do stuff.
00:46:01.742 - 00:46:26.760, Speaker A: RBA have a couple of bags. Not that it's like. I feel like it's pretty straightforward what happens there. People who work in RBA, like, there is, of course, some T bills, there is some SME lending, there is some other stuff, because it's such an old industry. There is not like some wow, ten X, right? It's more so puts in whatever in real world into DFI. Pretty straightforward there. I have a couple.
00:46:26.760 - 00:46:58.990, Speaker A: I think it will grow a lot, but probably the biggest players will take the most market share because that is a lot of based on trust, right? It's not like a few different DFI protocols which don't necessarily need to have the biggest trust. They just. There it is related to papers. And when you want papers, you want to have like, I don't know, a 70 year old who has done that shit for 50 years, right? That, you know, at least they know it. You don't want 15 year olds running around with some LLCs and stuff, right? That's literally the opposite. Because you go for safety and we have a wrong perception of safety. But because this is RVA and it's related to legal documents.
00:46:58.990 - 00:47:24.246, Speaker A: Even people who have done stuff with legal documents, as poor and as that may sound, I'm not sure if there is. I have a couple of Amm bags investments. Mostly because I like teams and I know they have a huge presence in the space. I shouldn't call the names, right? Just not to shill it. I don't think beyond that. There is really much new to do with amms. Like many people, researchers themselves are saying there is concentrated amm, right? There is one for long tail.
00:47:24.246 - 00:47:41.646, Speaker A: There is one for short tail. Probably you don't need to optimize it even further. Like what we have today with like curves, uniswaps, mavericks, uni before and a couple of other things. Valentis, I think the newer one hack all the bag. Maybe that's enough. Maybe that's enough. Of course bank are doing a different thing.
00:47:41.646 - 00:47:57.814, Speaker A: There are many different. How do they call it? Many different flavors of that. Maybe you don't need 110. Maybe is okay. Of course 100 will be done. But I'm just saying that it doesn't need to be 100. How many stable swaps with concentrated amm like curve do we need? Okay, let's have more than one.
00:47:57.814 - 00:48:27.610, Speaker A: Two, right? For security or whatever. And maybe three, which is specialized. You don't need ten. Again, the one thing that is an obvious realization that not necessarily took me a while, but wasn't an exact thing, is like you can have different perception whether you invest based on just narrative and you don't care who is executing it, or just invest in executors. Seasoned investors understand you need to be doing the execution related one, right. Because ideas are cheap. Even though they're not cheap.
00:48:27.610 - 00:49:02.954, Speaker A: Many ideas are just a very hot thing they can fall through in two years. So even though the idea was right, timing was right, execution was bad. That idea can also be taken later by a better execution team. Maybe in crypto, that thesis is slightly more skewed towards 50 50, is because the space is insanely narrative driven. So often teams that have the best execution, but not the right narrative, they don't have enough time to switch the narrative into the right one later. And even though they were very smart, well executed, they are not in the right place at the right time. You could argue that the best execution team will also understand to execute the narrative differently, right? You could say that.
00:49:02.954 - 00:49:22.414, Speaker A: So I don't know. To know whether a team is very well executed or not, you also need to know them for a long time. Right. And the space is still new, so there are not that many teams that have ten people who worked for ten years here. Right. You don't have that much backlog to look into, so it's very much superficial on how you base that opinion. Yeah.
00:49:22.414 - 00:49:40.094, Speaker A: I mean, venture capital in general is a lot of subjectivity involved in crypto, it's even more subjectivity. Because of cycles, it's even more subjectivity. So I think the best bags that have performed for me, the best were the ones that I least expected, quite literally, except maybe one or two. The rest were just fully like I was. Huh. Yeah.
00:49:40.152 - 00:49:47.910, Speaker B: Since you've arrived here, how do you see the crypto landscape being different in Turkey compared to other countries? Perhaps?
00:49:48.350 - 00:50:15.460, Speaker A: I wouldn't say I particularly know that much between. Difference between Turkey's landscape in Turkey and other countries. I know that many users, especially those who care about the monetary value of this, right, which is. I mean, we all do that. Many traders are in Turkey as they are, like, for example, in Ukraine, Russia. Right. In many of these places now, you cannot even do it directly, but basically, I know there is a huge adoption scene here.
00:50:15.460 - 00:50:44.410, Speaker A: Big part of the population uses crypto for, I guess, similar reasons as Latin America countries have. Right. Because of the inflation, which is great. I feel like crypto projects are very much failing turkish community for now, because many are focused on the abstracted narratives about inference stuff. Turkish users actually want to be users, right? So people saying, oh, but they are gambling a lot with this. And other nations could do that. But yeah, they need to kind of.
00:50:44.410 - 00:51:04.542, Speaker A: That's the point. That's where they see the biggest adoption. So focus on it. So at gearbox, we understand. It's just that we had to build the stack first, which we are now pretty much at the final stage because rebuilding core every year is not a fun thing. The cycles of shipment are insanely large, insanely long, and insanely expensive. So now it's going to be finally focusing on what users are asking for.
00:51:04.542 - 00:51:29.494, Speaker A: I have seen, of course, on the adoption spectrum is that many of the stores and everything have like this USDT sign or something else, which is pretty cool. I don't think I have ever seen it anywhere, like in Europe where Europe doesn't really have that in. Guess no, turkey is part of Europe. Whoever you ask depends, right? I mean, like in western european countries, you don't see that? Yeah. So it was really pretty interesting to see. I like the idea. Like I didn't get it before.
00:51:29.494 - 00:52:03.010, Speaker A: Like for example, why was an event done in Bogota, right? And why was an event done in Taiwan? Why is not Turkey? Why they can just do in Amsterdam all the time? Obviously there are many different communities around the world. Communities are very different. People are very different. It's very cool that actually it is done globally in different places. Of course, I can say it would be great if most stuff was done with the attention to local cuisine. I don't know, people, culture, whatever else. But at the same time, teams who are working in this space, a lot of it is business oriented, right? You have shortage of time, you have shortage of capital, you have shortage of people at the spot.
00:52:03.010 - 00:52:41.070, Speaker A: So that's why people just choose Hilton's of this or whatever else that is like a westernized hotel, because you can communicate better and do you know what you expect, right? Like that's why you go to Starbucks in another country. You know the caramel Frappuccino you're going to get, right? Which is bad and good at the same time. We would have done somewhere in a more local place with the more local thing, but we just had some random, not random, but like a normal hotel. So I can't even say that you could expect of projects to really do that because they don't have dedicated people for that. Startups are small, right? It's not a core thing you need to be doing. So sadly, it is missed. I mean, food was great.
00:52:41.070 - 00:53:02.898, Speaker A: I like turkish food because like Uzbek, russian, ukrainian food, Turkish, I would say a lot is meat based. I like meat. Sorry, that sounded wrong. A lot of turkish tea. Although when I had two in a row on an empty stomach, I sat down and then I was like almost on fire. People like friends who have families, like, listen, this is your aging, this is called like, high heartbeat. Really high heartbeat.
00:53:02.898 - 00:53:14.106, Speaker A: Because of that. I was like, holy wow. Just from turkish tea on an empty stomach during a row after coffee. So this is a huge caffeine overdose. Caffeine overdose, yeah.
00:53:14.288 - 00:53:20.266, Speaker B: You're attending as a partner. Tell me about that. How's the experience been? There we go.
00:53:20.288 - 00:53:22.590, Speaker A: Just falling down the entire time like this. Yeah.
00:53:22.660 - 00:53:25.600, Speaker B: So you're here as a partner. How's that experience?
00:53:26.130 - 00:53:52.146, Speaker A: The world? Gearbox is also as a partner sponsor back in Amsterdam in April 2021, so its global events are done exceptionally well. I don't even think they even make that much money. Like, they probably break even and plus. But knowing Kartik and the other team members, who would have been doing just shitcoins 24/7 or just investing, it's hell, probably. This is just, like. I know. Even doing merch, as simple as hoodies, that's already stressful.
00:53:52.146 - 00:54:14.830, Speaker A: How do the merch put everyone together? Venue, security, whatever? I can't imagine. Like, even a side had. We had a side event with gearbox, diva Aragon and liquidity. Great teams as well. And thanks to them for doing all the work and choosing the place because they had a person locally, otherwise it's really hectic experience to do all of that. Yeah, no, it's great. The parting experience has been great.
00:54:14.830 - 00:54:30.146, Speaker A: Always great attention to detail. They managed to give the time to everybody. Everything is done safely. On point. Food, actually, here in Istanbul and Turkey was much better than other east global events. I remember back in Amsterdam in 21, food was so bad, it was disgusting. Not anything bad about it.
00:54:30.146 - 00:54:34.498, Speaker A: Global, probably more so stone into the dutch way. Right?
00:54:34.584 - 00:54:39.330, Speaker B: Yeah. The cuisine isn't exactly known for being exactly stellar or renowned.
00:54:39.490 - 00:54:43.958, Speaker A: Here it is, I guess. Absolutely, yes. I know. I ate all of it. Yeah.
00:54:44.044 - 00:54:48.258, Speaker B: I'm happy they leveraged the local cuisine to actually bring people here, and they've.
00:54:48.274 - 00:54:49.254, Speaker A: Used it as well.
00:54:49.372 - 00:54:56.060, Speaker B: It's been absolutely brilliant. And on the topic of the hoodie, I'm wearing one right now. Thank you very much. I think they're great. I'm guessing you designed it?
00:54:56.670 - 00:55:29.406, Speaker A: No, actually, the illustrator for gearbox, from the start, has been my sister. Not because I tried to hire my own family members, nothing like that. It's just that. Just easier to work with an illustrator, easier to work with creative people once you have worked before. Because whenever you say, oh, do a pick, like, you know how the creative assignment goes, right? So do this picture, and there's, like, this thing, and you put them here and then, like that. If you never work with the person, they'll be like, the hell do you want. So you either spend a lot of time giving an exact sketch or they have done stuff with you before that they know that you are a moron, but they can put it visually.
00:55:29.406 - 00:55:41.018, Speaker A: You do creative stuff on either videos as well, right. Whenever it comes to somebody new asking for something, although I don't know if you really come across that. But you know what I'm talking about. Yeah. You need like a level of communication there.
00:55:41.104 - 00:55:51.770, Speaker B: Certainly. I'm curious, what are the main topics that have been covered here? There's various hackathons. People are building, people are coming out with proposals. What are some projects maybe that have caught your eye?
00:55:52.270 - 00:56:16.274, Speaker A: Majority, I would say. There was very much little new deFi. And again, that is all related to stuff we discussed before, which is the adoption cycle, not venture cycle, because all of it is startup. Startups have to appeal to investors in the first stage. And when the market is bearish, you cannot build apps because you have no users to use them. So basically you build an app and you will raise exactly zero because they'll be like, oh, you are an app. That means you need to have users where users zero buy.
00:56:16.274 - 00:56:45.262, Speaker A: As an infra, you're like, you are selling shovels, right? And shovels are good to be sold both in bear and in bull. You can sell shovels in any cycle of the market. It will always work, just sometimes better, sometimes worse. So the last one and a half years, venture activity throughout the entire world wasn't exactly high, except AI. So in crypto, it has been degrading, I think the last couple of months because of market picking up, it slightly got better, but not much better. A lot of it is infra. So infra, which is abstract things.
00:56:45.262 - 00:57:14.630, Speaker A: Very cool stuff, right? There is some, if you consider cool, but I guess applications of risk taking can be cool. All of this, like data layer, availability, blah, blah, blah, the big narratives, right? They are interesting, they're not bullshit, but they're abstract. And again, on the topic of users adoption and whatnot, doesn't exactly help directly. It helps indirectly by making infra better for apps being built. But what all industries initially do when they're young is they forget that somebody needs to use it, right?
00:57:14.700 - 00:57:19.206, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think the build and they will come mentality maybe is it's not.
00:57:19.228 - 00:57:34.718, Speaker A: That anybody really believes in it. Like, I've never seen a person believe that the build and come mentality will work out. There is a stigma for that. Right. But no teams understand that's not going to happen. It's just that it's not like they can do much with it, right? They need to build their protocol layer or want to or need 50 50. Let's take so, right.
00:57:34.718 - 00:57:39.040, Speaker A: They don't have enough resources or funds in to also do things on top.
00:57:39.650 - 00:57:41.760, Speaker B: So how do we drive adoption then?
00:57:43.250 - 00:58:27.646, Speaker A: Let other people take care of it. I mean, jokes aside, EF spends some time on it, right? Because you care about the vision and really such things, apart from the money driven questions, once you have the luxury to think about them. When you're a startup and you need to raise, you kind of have to target first the fundraise and then the second one maybe as well to capitalize better. If you get that, to that point, and you do have the time and the resource to think about adoption and like application layer, whatever your users, you will do that. Just many don't reach that state and you kind of cannot start there because it needs capital. For example, you could of course start there if you take grants from, let's say big layer one layer two layer twos, right? You take grants. But there is one thing.
00:58:27.646 - 00:59:18.238, Speaker A: To take a 50K grant vested for a year and just do some fogey's narrative on the infrared layer and raise 1 million right away. Like, even if you are very honest, why the hell would you say no to the latter, right? Absolutely. You could still do the latter and then try to do the former. But it's like, I guess with politics a little bit, I'm going to be the best politician, right? I'm going to save the world, feed everybody who is hungry. And then once on the process of getting to the official how to post right seat the journey, and then after you are there, you realize, first of all, you cannot really do anything you promised, and then you are not spoiled, but more so you have other things to take care about. And then you just literally failed the people who had the trust in you, partly due to your own fault and incentives, partly due to you naturally not being able to just fix all of it. So I guess you can turn these problems into common problems like Ethereum foundation is doing.
00:59:18.238 - 00:59:55.020, Speaker A: There are a bunch of I like account abstraction. I'm not talking about four, three, seven standards or whatever. I am not technical to know the difference by heart, but it makes sense that a wallet would have social recovery and would it make you have a seat phrase that totally makes sense, right? But then you have the questions though, is mass adoption would probably be Samsung and Amazon phones having wallets by default, right? Which is totally not decentralized. So should you really be building towards that or just wait for them to come. And you can just focus on the really decentralized stuff, like torrent, right? With the torrents and whatever, with privacy. People who care about self custody. Privacy, whatever.
00:59:55.020 - 01:00:12.526, Speaker A: I don't know the stats, but it's less than 1%, right? Much, much less. So at some point, people think about the big money, and that is often not decentralized, not self custody. It's a one button, it's very slick, but behind it, there is practically no blockchain, no crypto whatever.
01:00:12.708 - 01:00:18.094, Speaker B: Okay, just before we wrap up, I'd like to ask you where we can stay updated on Gearbox's progress.
01:00:18.222 - 01:00:42.074, Speaker A: Not the usual social media, right? The Twitters of this world. What we do cool, though, is we do monthly reports on all this stuff that has been done in that month and the money that was spent because all of the. Except the initial round, which was like a seed round that was spent fully on initial developers and audits, everything that was raised after it was in the Dao. So you can see from the treasury money going somewhere where it goes for how much it goes for.
01:00:42.112 - 01:00:53.958, Speaker B: I'd like to ask you if you've got any final remarks, perhaps, about Istanbul, the events that have been happening here, the future of crypto, your favorite aspect of having spent a week here. Any closing remarks?
01:00:54.054 - 01:01:18.162, Speaker A: Istanbul was quite a culture shock for me because I was in Amsterdam and Dubai for the past couple of years, which everyone is very. I don't go out that much, so everything is very peaceful. Boomer know, which is not good. It's just what is something I've been exposed to in the past few years. And Istanbul is a very lively city, people, because it's more of a southern nation, like Spain to an extent, right. Italy south. They're more passionate, really.
01:01:18.162 - 01:01:37.766, Speaker A: At first you can take it less rudeness or something, but no, it's quite often just passion. And people just, like, caring about many things more so than people, let's say, in Switzerland or Netherlands do, which are very. Just like, reserved. Right. That was quite a culture shock. But again, after five days, I get used to it much more. So I would come back for that purpose, but do more cultural stuff next time on the events.
01:01:37.766 - 01:01:58.546, Speaker A: No, I think Ethereum events are great. There is a good degree of people understanding the narratives as well as they're just building the stuff they like, as well as just the VC oriented stuff. So I would say it's a good mix. There is no too much stuff that is, like, too futuristic, and there is no too much stuff that just money focused. It's a good in between. I wouldn't change anything for that. It's always fun, always different groups of people.
01:01:58.546 - 01:02:30.758, Speaker A: So that's cool. I would always come back here on the space in general. I don't think anything is being done wrong right now per se. I would say there are teams focused in many different aspects and it's much more diverse in terms of what has been built and worked on than before. So it's infrared application, late whatever. To a large extent it's because startups doing well when there is money. So because there is more money, people don't have to think about, oh, I need to scam ten k over there tomorrow, right? Just to make my ends meet and pay to developers.
01:02:30.758 - 01:02:59.346, Speaker A: You can take a bit of a longer trajectory, but because there are also not everybody has 100 million in treasury, they also don't think ten years ahead something do, right. So there is degree of like we need to think within the next half a year, within the next two, the next four, within the next ten. So as such it makes it diverse enough basically as a whole. I wouldn't change anything there. Yeah, pretty positive. On the space. There is of course a large degree of it is the hypothetical ethos driven stuff related to adoption and that is very much related to regulation.
01:02:59.346 - 01:03:45.202, Speaker A: People who are seasonal in this space or not this space, I mean seasonal in terms of other industries, they all have the same opinion is that take it two, five years from now, all of the wallets will be just pre made Samsung wallet and pre made apple wallet. And whatever wallets we have today will be like tiny niche ones. Same goes for protocols. In the protocols, I guess you can argue a bit more that if regulation somehow allows open protocols to be actually not controllable, but the interfaces to be controllable, which is, I think the best way to be in, then you can still have huge banks deposited the money into curve in uniswap. That'll be fantastic. It's a bit of a pipe dream because probably they will just remake everything for themselves. But there's a good degree of that not happening as well.
01:03:45.202 - 01:04:29.998, Speaker A: But probably 90% of stuff will be apple and Samsung wallet within a controlled roll up, which is KYC, and everything will be exactly the same there. But what is important is that the people we are now, everybody in this event majority, right. The niche that we are in will stay a niche, but it will be a niche not with 10,000 people, but a niche with 1 million people. And the capital base won't be like 1 trillion today, but 10 trillion so it will be a niche compared to the stock market or the gold market or the real estate market, but it will be a niche big enough to have a global impact on communities, creators and whoever else who could benefit from it. So again, stay in a niche, but a pretty fucking big niche. So let's just keep it that way. You can always.
01:04:29.998 - 01:04:34.570, Speaker A: I think you cannot sit on two chairs at once, but you can let your friends sit on another chair.
