00:00:00.250 - 00:00:37.590, Speaker A: Ethereum block Sanjay magic Mempolar danger do Shmida mem hold up his birch memorandum arbitrage boltler.
00:00:41.450 - 00:01:05.406, Speaker B: So if you didn't know, the defiant weekly goes out Fridays. It's the big show. It's the one where we capture the big ideas and we go super, super deep. It's also the one where we do a kind, kind of biggest creative work. And it's where our video journey with Camilla Russo began. It's a chance to flex the muscles both creatively and journalistically, by telling the stories not necessarily as they happened, but more as they felt. It's up, it's down.
00:01:05.406 - 00:01:07.986, Speaker B: It's the greatest. It's the worst community.
00:01:08.088 - 00:01:08.402, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:08.456 - 00:01:17.154, Speaker B: VC meh. It's a scam. Not a scam. Might be a scam. Was it a scam? Time for Sam Bankman free great hair, fair launch. What's for lunch? Spork it. Don't fork it.
00:01:17.154 - 00:01:25.974, Speaker B: Fetch the pitchforks to me. To, you know, me. Yes, chef, top chef, mosque death. Take some stick. Top pick. I need you need, you need unicorns, uniswap top flop. Chop it to the drop it like it's hot.
00:01:25.974 - 00:02:02.574, Speaker B: Knives out. Let's see. Bro, do you even sushi does that about COVID it? And if nothing else, I always hope that there's a sense of authorship in the way we create on this channel. In other words, nobody else could have made it. Donate high gas costs keep you out of Ethereum at balancer, the gas optimized vault architecture makes trading cheaper than anywhere else. Liquidity providers can optimize their fee earnings using the dynamic fee system that automatically adjusts to market conditions. You can also use asset managers to lend out idle assets, dramatically increasing your capital efficiency.
00:02:02.574 - 00:02:43.790, Speaker B: And because balancer is an open platform for flexible, automated markets, you can choose from stable pools or weighted pools. And in the future, more designs will be created that, well, they don't even know about yet. Check it out at Balancer Phi.

Looking back over the films we've made, I'm kind of sad this year that we've not been able to put more of our weird creative spin on the stories the way we could last year. But so much of that is down to the fact that we just produce so much more content each week. We've also started to do more live sessions, partly because, well, there just wasn't time to do a full edit in that given week, but also because there's an immediacy to crypto that sometimes is best served by doing things live and in the moment. Having said all that, four really big ideas emerged this year, the first of which was nfts as a force that could not be ignored.
00:04:23.258 - 00:04:54.890, Speaker B: Secondly was the rapid sophistication of defi. Third was regulatory headwinds, and fourth, of course, the metaverse. So our guide to digital art and NFTs, which we've actually made last year, that's the most popular weekly video we've ever made, and it seems to be many people's first entry point into the space. We folded it up this year with an insane feature length mini documentary called the greatest NFT film ever made, which is kind of meant to be tongue in cheek, but it was also designed to be a kind of capture all snapshot for this space.
00:04:55.040 - 00:05:28.294, Speaker A: Did you do it? Yes or no? You're goddamn right I did it. I know what you're thinking. Was it 700 e or was it 800 E? You know, I can't quite remember myself and all this excitement. The thing is, this is blockchain, the most volatile market in the world.
00:05:28.332 - 00:05:30.166, Speaker B: Hella blow your head clean off.
00:05:30.348 - 00:05:37.990, Speaker A: You got to ask yourself one question. Do you feel lucky? Well, do ya? Honk.
00:05:41.450 - 00:06:24.386, Speaker B: Sold lot number 6965 for 800 E. If you are just joining the NFT space, and it seems many, many are, then probably all you can see is mediocre art selling for silly money and those damn punks. I mean, 800 E, like $2 million for this. See, the thing is, if that's all you can see with NFTs, if that's all you think that's going on here, then you have so much more to learn. And if you watch no other video, then just watch this one through in its entirety. Because we have pulled together a who's who of the most interesting voices from right across this crazy space to help paint the most complete picture yet. This is the Defiant.
00:06:24.386 - 00:06:57.438, Speaker B: All throughout the year, we kept returning to NFTs as a place to flex our creative muscles and explore what was really going on. Our guide to Artblocks is now considered the definitive guide to that project. And our chronicle of the rise of board Ape Yacht Club is now on the syllabus at metaverse universities around the world. But it was our massive three part guide to Puck that really cemented our legend as well. It was long and Pat liked it. What wall do you need? Puck is an artist, but Puck is also a coder. And code comes in many forms.
00:06:57.438 - 00:07:21.974, Speaker B: It can generate, but it can also learn. And before coming to play games in blockchain, art park created the archelect. And on the increasing sophistication of defi we covered so much this year. We covered magic, money, protocols. I want to introduce you to a friend of mine. It is the Sony a seven s three. This is a camera? Yes, but it's not just any camera.
00:07:21.974 - 00:07:39.818, Speaker B: This camera is amazing. Let me tell you why. Firstly, it has the most incredible autofocus system, which means that you can get any take that you want to get in one or two shots. Pretty cool. Saves your time. But also inside here is the most enormous sensor. But this is not a 64 megapixel sensor.
00:07:39.818 - 00:07:59.794, Speaker B: This is only a twelve megapixel sensor. What does that mean? It means the photo sites are enormous. That means they suck in lots of light. And that means it can pretty much see in the dark. But it's not the most amazing thing about this camera. Oh, no. See, this camera has built into it somewhere in all that electronic wizardry.
00:07:59.794 - 00:08:27.998, Speaker B: A time machine. It can see back in time. And what you realize is that when you hit record, what actually was going on was that you were recording not from over there, but from over here. And that means this. And this are how we do this. But that's the thing, isn't it? You see, most things that look magical have an explanation. And once you know how the trick is done, well, then everything falls into place.
00:08:27.998 - 00:08:31.310, Speaker B: Indexes, tranches, fixed interest and passive income strategies.
00:08:31.730 - 00:09:13.280, Speaker A: Take one step into crypto and it can feel like you're throwing your life to the gods of thunder. I'm here. You say, take me, throw me into the void and ape that you are, you keep on walking towards that edge, you cry, and over you go. But what if there was another way? What if you could have your cake and eat it?
00:09:13.890 - 00:09:20.510, Speaker B: We're talking tranches, structures and downside protection. This is the defiant.
00:09:25.170 - 00:09:25.582, Speaker A: Hey.
00:09:25.636 - 00:09:27.138, Speaker B: I'm speaking to you from the future.
00:09:27.224 - 00:09:31.618, Speaker A: From a lambo. Lambo from the moon. Yeah. We made it. We did it.
00:09:31.784 - 00:09:38.494, Speaker B: Cast your mind back to 2017, where there were influencers only too ready to tell you how they were gonna retire from crypto.
00:09:38.542 - 00:09:41.226, Speaker A: What shot of shooting Ian. Tell me if it's good luck.
00:09:41.278 - 00:10:26.390, Speaker B: And I do wonder how many of them actually did. Because the. See, the thing is, if you cash out of crypto, you're going to be hit with a large tax bill. But it did get me thinking. What am I going to do when this bull run finally pops? Am I just going to cling on through another bear market or am I going to be sensible and do something sensible with my money? All of that will be discussed in this episode where we will look at passive income strategies lending, staking, synthetic stocks, all that good stuff, and whether DeFi can actually do what the fhir movement does in something I'm calling DeFi. Yeah, this is sensible, and it is the defiant. But there was also the rise of MeV and flashbots alongside hacks, liquidations and flashlands.
00:10:29.210 - 00:10:50.390, Speaker A: Liquidators are the silent killers of Defi city. They operate in the shadows, patrolling the block to keep the city moving and earning a pretty penny for doing so. Unlike miners validators, liquidators need no capital of their own. This is created in the brotherhood of pro executioners. Dak.
00:11:07.190 - 00:11:12.580, Speaker B: We deep dived into Solana, avalanche, Cardano and Terra. We would have done so many more, but we ran out of time.
00:11:20.410 - 00:11:55.890, Speaker A: What stops you from reviewing the king Cartano? Ada. Take fundamentals, usage, energy consumption. It will beat everything in all dimensions. Are you personally able to use Ada for anything? If so, what have you used it for? That's the question I ask about all crypto. Do you find yourself using it for anything that you find value in? You're breaking my heart. Mark. But levity aside, come by the farm in Colorado sometime and let's chat.
00:12:00.150 - 00:12:35.386, Speaker B: This may just be the foothills for a project that is raced into the top 20 projects by market cap. It's a blockchain whose sole purpose is powering the very best decentralized financial applications. And out of respect for its founder and core community, we will be presenting much of this show in a language you probably won't understand. And for this, we make no apology. It. Shalkali Jackson. Shalkari Guzal, JB.
00:12:35.386 - 00:13:29.040, Speaker B: Shalkala. Iron from the Black Sea. This is the defiant. And while Defi has felt somewhat in the grip of an extended hangover after the festivities of last year, there is no doubt that there has been an enormous amount of exciting work being done in this space, not least of which the emergence of protocol owns liquidity and DfI 2.0.
00:13:45.370 - 00:14:08.060, Speaker A: What are you talking about? No, it hasn't. Yes, it's called drainage defi. See, I own all the liquidity, so of course I get all the yield. I drink your yield. I drink it up every day and then I dump it every day.
00:14:09.470 - 00:14:17.520, Speaker B: No, VC, come on. I need a friend. I gotta have this. Our community is deserting us.
00:14:18.930 - 00:14:33.490, Speaker A: You are not the chosen one. Do you understand? The liquidity has been rugged. There's nothing you can do about it. It's gone. It's rugged. You lose. Drainage.
00:14:33.490 - 00:14:50.198, Speaker A: Drainage defi. You, boy. It's all gone. I'm so sorry. If you have a milkshake, I have a milkshake and I have a straw. Here it is. It's a straw.
00:14:50.198 - 00:15:29.670, Speaker A: Are you watching? And my straw reaches across the room and starts to drink your milkshake. I drink your milkshake. I drink it up. Don't believe. Did you think your community and your high apy and your cheap tokens would save you? I am the one on the COVID of Forbes magazine. I am the one Satoshi has chosen.
00:15:30.490 - 00:16:17.862, Speaker B: All of which could be under threat next year as we are set to encounter major regulatory headwinds. Yeah, I was just hoping to speak to one of your representatives about Tether, the cryptocurrency. It's kind of amazing just how dirty you feel investigating this subject, but there is no avoiding it. It's time to talk about tether. We kicked off our coverage with a huge deep dive into tether. And as far as I went with this film, there was still so much further one can go later in the year. A lot of the things, the suspicions that we had about Tether were actually proven to be true.
00:16:17.862 - 00:16:22.120, Speaker B: And it's going to be interesting to see how many more of them end up being true as well.
00:16:25.050 - 00:16:32.962, Speaker A: Look at that, guys. If you ever seen a rug pull like that, guys, they're going to smash him. You know what I'm saying? That is a rug pull.
00:16:33.036 - 00:17:24.310, Speaker B: Elizabeth Warren has recently come out strongly against stablecoins. But we picked this story up months earlier with our long film on why the US treasury is so worried about them. I bet you're bored of hearing about Fafa and regulations probably isn't even on your radar right now, but this sense that people are coming to take away all the nice things that we have and let's face it, there are a thousand other entry points to this space that are really a lot more interesting. Thing is, though, here at the Defiant, we cannot afford to ignore it. For the longest time, Defi has been this niche corner of the crypto verse populated by weirdos, wonks and degenerates. But we're about to be thrust into the very front line of the battle for the soul of this entire space. With Zuckface announcing meta and the web two behemoths plan for global domination, it's going to put this weird little corner of ours even more into the spotlight.
00:17:24.310 - 00:18:08.582, Speaker B: Stablecoins are literally the backbone of DFI, and this conversation will shape the future of the entire crypto space in ways that will eclipse even bitcoin's spectacular rise to legitimacy. Stablecoins are the scenic one on of web3, and the US treasury seems to be absolutely petrified of them. Of course, if those headwinds get too strong, then what comes with it is a bear market. We had a big drop earlier in the year, and one of our best performing films was actually just me talking cope. But it reminded me how much sometimes it's just nice to hear someone recognize what's going on and talk about it. I've seen bitcoin go from 20 grand down to three grand and this. You know what? There's this crypto shrug that happens.
00:18:08.582 - 00:18:29.322, Speaker B: You just go. We can learn a lot from our french friends. The metaverse, of course, became a major talking point with the arrival of Zuckface into our sacred circle. And our Metaverse 101 film is a great starting point for grounding yourself in what's going on. By the way, sorry to break it, but this metaverse thing is the ultimate evil plan. And that's where we will see the Armageddon. This is basically creating God's work on earth.
00:18:29.322 - 00:18:54.822, Speaker B: Well, that definition of an avatar is a God. It's an actual God. So, yes. And we follow that up with guides on dows play to earn. And we're going to be doing a lot more in this space as the defiant takes on the challenge of becoming a proper web3 media company. There have been so many favorite moments from making the show. There was one little thing.
00:18:54.822 - 00:19:02.902, Speaker B: Changes and bad science. We heard the true voices of red phone crypto.
00:19:02.966 - 00:19:23.986, Speaker C: For work and personal reasons, I need to stay anonymous. Not too long ago, I was complaining about my situation to a VC. I told him I was full of ideas and opinions on crypto, that I literally dream about crypto. But I didn't have an outlet for my thoughts. He said I should think about going anonymous. I thought about it, and I thought.
00:19:24.008 - 00:19:26.798, Speaker B: It sounded stupid and pranksy.
00:19:26.894 - 00:19:36.946, Speaker A: Amen. I never intend to damage markets. I just support them. You know, I provide liquidity. I provide volume. I make things possible.
00:19:37.128 - 00:19:53.770, Speaker B: We switched languages. Shimbara Zorgibi. I got punched in the face. Bass fees are burnt. Became a teenager.
00:19:56.190 - 00:20:10.490, Speaker A: We dream. We vibe. We create. $100,000 net worth by a six. We invest. He died. Gun.
00:20:10.490 - 00:20:24.514, Speaker A: Love it. We see, we rebate. Hi, I'm twelve year old with a credit card.
00:20:24.632 - 00:20:25.910, Speaker B: Credit cards.
00:20:26.890 - 00:20:34.550, Speaker A: We hack. I don't care what people think of me. I don't give a fuck. We don't give a fuck. We are woke. Capital.
00:20:37.450 - 00:20:58.778, Speaker B: Resurrected. Beavis and butthead, bro. This, by my token, it's on Bitclub. Bit munch sort of blew up our eyeballs. Jpegs. Hundreds of thousands of them pouring into the market. Jet fueled by hype, messiahs, oversubscribed discord channels, and alpha traders with Mev smarts and a swag bag of Eden.
00:20:58.778 - 00:21:15.986, Speaker B: We have hit peak NFT. We're cruising down the other side. Barely a soul has any clue what they're buying, why they're buying it. It's just important that they expose their eyeballs to as many pixels as they possibly can. Eyeballs. Meet art. Digital art.
00:21:15.986 - 00:21:27.202, Speaker B: The new art renaissance. Consume it. Feast on it. I want it all. Gimme gimme gimme, gimme the pixels. Skinny ones, fat ones, generative ones, handblown ones. I want all your pixels.
00:21:27.202 - 00:21:35.618, Speaker B: I must have pixels. A global hypercolor. Post rational, post national, post punk, post ape. Nft. Opensea.
00:21:35.794 - 00:21:36.630, Speaker A: Orange.
00:21:45.010 - 00:22:10.130, Speaker B: Mate. You okay? We got weird and leaned on Zardos to tell the story of Luteman.
00:22:11.050 - 00:22:25.900, Speaker A: Halfman speaks to you, his chosen ones. Words are good. Go forth. And a.
00:22:31.640 - 00:22:58.912, Speaker D: I used to worry there was too much beauty in the world. Too many NFTs, too many choices. But now I would give anything just for a glimpse of artistry. An outline or even a sketch. Anything beyond words. In the greatest stories of old, a hero emerges in mankind's hour of greatest need. Nobody knows where he came from.
00:22:58.912 - 00:23:25.320, Speaker D: But when the NFt blindness struck, who could have known that the only one left untouched would be the one with a mind so uncultured, so deficient in aesthetic appreciation, he would buy anything before he may have had another name. But from this point on, we knew him, only me, as donkey.
00:23:49.860 - 00:24:15.636, Speaker B: And then there were the songs we took on ICE Cube. Exactly one month ago, acclaimed crypto artist Trevor Jones reached out with a request that I would find impossible to turn down. Keep him calm, sure, but what about me, Trevor? How am I supposed to do this justice? ICE cube. Three decades of culture, no pressure, get it wrong and risk the wrath of Cube.
00:24:15.828 - 00:24:17.370, Speaker A: But there's history here.
00:24:20.540 - 00:24:27.020, Speaker B: Trevor's shitting himself. I'm shitting myself. How does this end with us all drowning in shit?
00:24:27.680 - 00:24:29.400, Speaker A: No, we can't be afraid.
00:24:29.480 - 00:24:40.320, Speaker B: Not of failure, not of rubbing anyone the wrong way. Not afraid to speak up. Great art is a collision. So let's smash this together. Me, Cube and Trevor Jones.
00:24:40.740 - 00:25:07.480, Speaker A: Fuck it. See my pin is mightier than my AK and my enemies won't have a good day see, my pin is mightier than my AK and my enemies won't have a good day blow they have to wait put them on layaway whole world up with the shit I say shit I fucking whole life up with the shit I write shit it's a shark in the water do you build a bite.
00:25:09.980 - 00:25:12.200, Speaker B: We got unstoppable with Solano.
00:25:22.780 - 00:25:32.784, Speaker C: Salana shooting like a Ghana pistols on the blockchain aiming for your mom my 17 hours, nine minutes of distortion tapping out of feeds blaming resourced exhaustion so.
00:25:32.822 - 00:25:34.128, Speaker A: What we doubled in I must be.
00:25:34.134 - 00:25:40.976, Speaker B: Going sky high envy a pity but we're baldies in the d yet we struggle with transactions but suck it up.
00:25:40.998 - 00:26:03.130, Speaker A: You because we're fixing that reflection because we unstoppable we were stoppable, we unstoppable, decentralized, and we're living the best life. We are unstoppable because we are stoppable, decentralized, and we're living the best life.
00:26:10.960 - 00:26:15.660, Speaker B: I turned a hack into a freestyle slow jam cream.
00:26:17.600 - 00:27:25.670, Speaker A: Cream get 1.5 e, sub 0.5 e for 30 uni sub 0.5 e for 912s USD provide 40 uni and zero point 49 e as a liquidity 1000 years USD transferred from cream cySD token wraps 2.2 Univ two into AWC 20 wrap token sent 1010 SUSD to cream C y and Su SD send 0.709,787,742,196 SUSD from cys USD to the address down below. Start duplicating the Su S d.
00:27:25.670 - 00:28:50.240, Speaker A: At the end of the duplication, send CySD to the dress below. Duplicates four times, converts to 10 million USDC through curve gets 10 million a USDC. That's a lot since USDC TUSD died a USDC to a three CR V gauge. And now it gets interesting. He sends 120 e to tornado cash and then sends 100 and e to Gitcoin grants tornado send a thousand e to Alpha Finance lab deploy, send a thousand e to the cream finance deploy and then send 100 tornado cash. And at the end, the balance was 10,924.9 and 13.532
00:28:50.240 - 00:29:01.312, Speaker A: million a three C r. And that's how it went down.
00:29:01.446 - 00:29:26.620, Speaker B: But it's appropriate to end this year on the opening part to part one of the pack film. If nothing else, this was our expression of the purest sentiment we could find to describe this space. Have an amazing end of the year, and we will see you for so much, much more in 2022. This was the defiant Hornet, guttered boys by ATS.
00:29:27.680 - 00:29:36.510, Speaker C: One thing that bothers me about the future is this. I really thought we'd have flying cars and hoverboards by now.
00:29:38.260 - 00:29:39.330, Speaker A: That's okay.
00:29:39.940 - 00:29:55.540, Speaker C: There's lots of other cool things. Robots that can make cocktails and all the information in the universe at the end of one little finger. But I don't know, I kind of still want more now.
00:29:55.690 - 00:29:57.172, Speaker A: 47 degrees right here.
00:29:57.226 - 00:29:57.972, Speaker C: You can have it.
00:29:58.026 - 00:30:02.288, Speaker A: 47 degrees. Still looking very good here. Go.
00:30:02.474 - 00:30:40.952, Speaker C: We all live on one spinning ball of madness, pumping through the universe, out of control, heading into the vast unknown. Or are we? Maybe not. Maybe we had one single vision, one dream, one plan to turn our ideas into reality. We focused our energy like Bruce Lee's one inch punch. And yeah, we took a few shots, but Mr. Mathers said, you only get one and we're not going to miss our chance. And like Miss Earhart's one flight across the Atlantic, we charged our engines and we flew retro.
00:30:41.016 - 00:30:42.364, Speaker A: Go, Rhino, go.
00:30:42.562 - 00:31:05.680, Speaker C: In a world full of dissonance, it's time for some harmony. Our adventure begins in three, two, one. It's.
