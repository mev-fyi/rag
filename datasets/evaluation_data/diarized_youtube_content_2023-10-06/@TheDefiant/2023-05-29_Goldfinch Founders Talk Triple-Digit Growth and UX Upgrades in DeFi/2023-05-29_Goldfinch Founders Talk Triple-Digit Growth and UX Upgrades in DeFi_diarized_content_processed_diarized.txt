00:00:00.250 - 00:00:00.800, Speaker A: You.
00:00:04.610 - 00:00:56.462, Speaker B: Welcome to the Defiant. I'm your host, taken Klein. Today we are joined by the co founding forces behind Goldfinch, Blake west and Mike Sale. They share with us a bit about what they learned from over 70 user interviews from everyone from Blackrock Apollo to retired nurses as well as their excitement around the user experience improvements for the entire web three and crypto space and how that UX and UI improvement will impact the Goldfinch protocol. How they saw 162% year over year growth in 2022 with no defaults. Blake and Mike give us insight into their thoughts around how crypto will reshape the global economy, expanding access to capital around the world and what they're building to make that possible. But first, they give us the TLDR of Goldfinch as well as what they're both focused on.
00:00:56.596 - 00:01:29.810, Speaker A: The high level on Goldfinch is it's a private credit platform that has a protocol underneath it that's using the blockchain technology to essentially enable greater liquidity and safety and cost efficiency for these private credit deals which are our loans to businesses around the world. And so now there is currently, through Goldfinch, over $100 million in active loans across borrowers in over 20 countries. So that's the TLDR on what Goldfinch is. And then I am one of the co founders of Goldfinch and so is blink.
00:01:29.890 - 00:01:34.266, Speaker B: Amazing. And tell us a little bit about your day to day as co founders. What are you focused on?
00:01:34.368 - 00:02:04.066, Speaker C: Oh, man. I feel like every day is very different, but one of the joys of being a co founder is you get to put your hands in kind of a lot of different pots. And so overall, we're always focused on the strategy and where are we going, what's thinking about the product, where's the market going? How do all these things fit together? Crypto moves so fast, but it makes it so interesting as a space to be an entrepreneur in. So I don't know. Every day is very different. But generally, strategy, product and technology for me, as I'm a CTO, amazing.
00:02:04.168 - 00:02:07.582, Speaker B: And then can you double click into the problem you're solving with Goldfinch?
00:02:07.726 - 00:02:48.466, Speaker A: Yeah, I can share more about that. And I think to understand the problem goldfinch is solving, it's helpful to think about the broader context we're in with the macro economy and also like private credit because we're in this particular moment. Well, maybe it helps to describe what private credit is. Private credit is giving loans out to businesses in a private sense. So compared to, say, public markets where public companies can issue debt. Private credit is when companies that are private get investment from investors who have, over the past number of decades, traditionally been like institutional folks. But right now, in the current economic environment, private credit is at a moment where it can really take off.
00:02:48.466 - 00:03:47.538, Speaker A: And that's because we have seen very high interest rates recently with the Fed increasing the treasury rate. And then that means that these high quality businesses around the world are able to offer really strong yields, especially compared to the past several decades. At the same time, we see stocks having one of its worst years now in a very long time. And that comes at the kind of following a broader trend of the broader markets and investors starting to lose confidence in the stock market. There's an index that Yale keeps of confidence in stock markets, which has just been gradually declining over the past 20 years. And so that means that right now, investors, a lot of the ones that we've been talking to, have been starting to look for new options and explore alternative ways of getting yield. And this is where kind of private credit is a perfect fit for them, because it provides this kind of yield, especially in the current markets.
00:03:47.538 - 00:05:07.022, Speaker A: And at the same time, it's becoming more available to individual investors, not just to the institutions that have primarily been able to participate in this. Then we take that moment in time right now where private credit is really compelling for individuals, and then when we see what the blockchain can help us do to supercharge it, because when we use crypto technology, that allows us to increase the liquidity of these investments, which is another thing that most investors that we talk to really care about, whereas institutions, they can lock up capital for a decade plus, but individuals have more sort of liquidity needs. And so what crypto can do is allow us to increase the liquidity of these, enable different ways for individuals to get liquidity on their investments, as well as help to dramatically improve the operations of running these deals. And so that is at a high level. The problem that we are solving for the investor side of this market is by creating this private credit platform with Goldfinch. It enables us to provide these private credit deals and this new kind of asset class offering to this investor group of individuals who traditionally, even folks like me and Blake, we've never had the ability to participate in these deals before, but now we can use crypto to make that possible.
00:05:07.156 - 00:05:25.140, Speaker B: Amazing. I want to dive into that a little bit more and touch on the interviews you guys have been doing and also tap into how listeners can get involved in this private credit market. But before we do, I want to chat a little bit about your founding story, both Blake and Mike. Can you tell us a little bit about how you got started in.
00:05:25.670 - 00:06:00.634, Speaker C: Sure. So Mike and I actually, we go way back to college days, so we've known each other, actually, since first day of college, freshman year. We were randomly paired together as roommates, and we've actually kind of been working on a bunch of various projects and stuff since that time. Everything from music notation systems to sports betting stuff to music collaboration websites. Anyway, so Mike and I have known each other for quite a while and always been working together, but we both got into crypto. Mike got a little earlier than I did. Mike is kind of getting probably around 2013.
00:06:00.634 - 00:06:27.698, Speaker C: I kind of got in more like 2017 time frame. We were talking about it, and I remember we found, like, old g chats of Mike being like, yo, bitcoin is so cool. Check this out. We've known about it for a while, but I kind of got more into it. 2017, started reading the bitcoin white paper, finding this technology to be just, like, really fascinating. And then around 2018, somewhat coincidentally, both of us decided to join Coinbase. Coincidentally, that would both happen at the same time, but both because we thought crypto was very compelling.
00:06:27.698 - 00:06:56.830, Speaker C: And so we joined Coinbase in 2018, were there for a couple of years, started to see some of these kind of green shoots of D five popping up around 2018, then, like, late 2019, early 2020, and really started to feel like this was going to be a green field for entrepreneurs. And Mike and I were really interested in starting to start something in this space. And that led into goldfinch specifically, which we can get into that kind of specific story. But, Mike, I don't know if you want to tell a little bit more about kind of your crypto journey.
00:06:56.910 - 00:07:47.922, Speaker A: Yeah, I think another just big part of this was feeling a little bit antsy with the broader crypto industry, especially in 2018 and 2019, where we had a lot of these infrastructural pieces in place. But the thing that really got me into crypto was feeling like this can really transform financial markets around the world and expand access to capital. And really this whole aspect of financial inclusion that people talk about a lot in crypto, I really believe it's possible. I really believe we can make it happen. And almost feeling like in 2018, 2019, a lot of what has happened in crypto was kind of, like, a little bit self referential or really self contained within crypto. And we have to break out of that both to increase just the cap of what's possible in the DeFi space, but also to have this kind of impact on broader society. Like, if we're just within crypto, it's going to take a very long time.
00:07:47.922 - 00:08:13.098, Speaker A: But if we can break out into the broader global economy and incorporate that into the DeFi space, that can dramatically increase just the impact we can have on our financial systems around the world. And so that was really a big part of wanting to start Goldfinch is being like, okay, it's not necessarily just happening. We have to will it into existence as an industry and being like, okay, let's start goldfinch. To do that and to make that happen.
00:08:13.184 - 00:08:21.206, Speaker B: Amazing. I love that financial inclusive lens. And, Blake, what was it about bitcoin that really kind of drew you in? Initially?
00:08:21.318 - 00:09:03.050, Speaker C: Yeah. So I'd say it was a couple things. So with bitcoin specifically, I think I was just kind of fascinated by this idea that you could play this kind of game with hardware and solving math problems and end up in this thing, that you could arrive at unified consensus among disparate parties. That was just a very fascinating concept. Obviously, this problem had been existing in computer science for decades and no one had solved it, for, I think I even read later on that a few years prior to Satoshi's paper, there had been some other paper proving that it was mathematically impossible to do this thing. But of course, it turned out you didn't need math, you actually needed economics to make it happen. And someone thinking really outside the box to be able to create the solution, which is just so fascinating.
00:09:03.050 - 00:09:46.642, Speaker C: So that was interesting there and then, I think it was really Ethereum really helped kind of seal the deal for me with crypto, feeling like you could create these marketplaces that were decentralized, where you were really inverting the control of the Internet from a platform owning all the data to the user owning the data, and these platforms plugging into that. And so thinking about those possibilities and how much of the Internet relied on this architecture of platform owned data and feeling it would be so much better for users in the Uber, Airbnb, and Facebook cases, it's your data, right? You should be able to port it to different places, and there should be different clients that work on top of that, at least. That architecture was very compelling to me. And so that was the thing about Ethereum that really drew me in. It's still kind of the thing I find maybe most fascinating about decentralized systems.
00:09:46.706 - 00:09:50.490, Speaker B: Amazing. And tell us a little bit about the Goldfinch founding story.
00:09:50.640 - 00:10:31.126, Speaker C: Yeah, so we were at Coinbase and kind of late 2019 seeing these kind of green shoots of DFI early 2020, we decided to get a little more serious about it. We actually joined the A 16 Z crypto startup school, the very first one that they did. And at the time, this was when compound and Ave were starting to have some early success on this lending fully on chain, which was a very interesting way to do things. Very novel. And we felt like, wow, compound and Ave, they're having all this success lending against these crypto assets where you have to put up more money than you have to borrow, or more money than you want to borrow than to actually borrow. You put up $150, you borrow $100. We were like, that's cool.
00:10:31.126 - 00:10:58.254, Speaker C: But that's also like maybe 1%, not even 0.1% of all the loans that exist in the world. And so we want to say, how can we take this power of crypto and apply it to. We were considered like kind of real lending, or like normal lending where the borrower doesn't already have all of the capital up front. And so that was the thing for us. We were like, let's take that, but let's do it for real lending. And that way we'll also be able to, as Mike was saying earlier, kind of break out of this crypto self referential loop and get more into the real world.
00:10:58.254 - 00:11:53.502, Speaker C: We've been very focused from the beginning about how do we bring in more people who aren't already in crypto, how do we get them the benefits of the blockchain and do that with real businesses and have real impact. I should probably also add that a lot of people have asked, when we're starting Goldfinch, why did we start with emerging markets? And this gets at, I think one of the key things early on for us was we just started calling around to a bunch of businesses and trying to ask them about their problems. And we had networks that got us talking with a lot of fintech companies in emerging markets, places like Nigeria, Kenya, India, Singapore, ET. And we just heard from them over and over again, this is a huge pain point, raising money for them. And they spend like 50% of their time just trying to raise money, even though they have high quality businesses. And we came to realize it's more of an access premium, that they're paying less than like a risk premium. Like, these are good businesses, but there's just not enough capital going into this space.
00:11:53.502 - 00:12:22.146, Speaker C: And they're in this funding gap. I'd say between about a few million dollars and like $20 million zone. If you want to raise less than a couple of million dollars in your local capital markets, you can probably do that in these emerging markets. Or if you want to raise more than $20 million, you can probably do that as well. You probably start getting the attention of western institutions. But there's a big gap in between of quality businesses that are looking to raise in that two to $20 million zone, and there's just a big funding gap. And crypto is a good fit for this because crypto doesn't have the same hangups about emerging markets.
00:12:22.146 - 00:12:42.590, Speaker C: It can send money anywhere in the world very easily. And so we felt like this was a place where, a niche where these businesses really wanted use crypto. They were like, crypto, sure, I'm in. This is a huge problem for my business. And so we felt like that's obviously the place to start. And then on the investor side, we knew a lot of investors didn't have as many opportunities to get real yield that's uncorrelated with the rest of the markets. And so we wanted to put those pieces together.
00:12:42.660 - 00:12:55.938, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah, I love that. You kind of broke out of that crypto echo chamber, and you're really kind of helping people get support that otherwise wouldn't have it. And can we talk a little bit about numbers, because I know you guys have had impressive traction. Can you share a little bit about that?
00:12:56.024 - 00:13:19.100, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's two numbers that I always look to that I think that are most important. One is that Goldfinch now has over $100 million in active loans around the world. And so we crossed that last year. And then in addition, Goldfinch has had zero losses through the protocol, so no default. And those are the two big numbers to look at. The most important ones.
00:13:19.550 - 00:13:32.190, Speaker B: Amazing. Super exciting. So let's talk about these interviews that you conducted. I think you had over 70 interviews with people from Apollo to Blackrock to retired nurses. Can you share a little bit about that?
00:13:32.260 - 00:14:19.870, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So we always want to understand our users, understand what people are thinking about crypto. So we did a ton of interviews with a bunch of different people across the investor stack, if you will, and just try to understand from them, what do you guys think about crypto right now? How are you guys using it, and what are your kind of investing needs and things like that? And I think some interesting takeaways. This one, maybe it won't be too surprising, but we're finding really across the stack that liquidity is king right now. I think that the markets have changed where before it was, maybe either assumed you'd have it or people didn't have as much need because money was very easy to get. And now that money is harder and things are more uncertain, liquidity is very key. So it means people would be willing to trade off yield, in most cases, to have the ability to exit their positions faster.
00:14:19.870 - 00:14:47.270, Speaker C: And so that's like a big thing that we've been thinking about. It plays into some of the new callable loan that we just launched a couple of weeks ago. We can talk about that a little later as well. Other things. We talked with some of these institutions, and I feel like a lot of these institutions, especially pre FTX, were very open to crypto, but I would say it felt more in like a science experiment kind of way. They're sort of like, we should be checking this out. I want to understand, but they weren't quite sure how it fits in with their business yet.
00:14:47.270 - 00:15:29.010, Speaker C: And so I think there's definitely still going to be a lot of work to do to make the case for institutions. I think especially also we look post FTX, we're seeing a lot of the institutions starting to recede, and I think it's going to be difficult to be selling to institutions for the next year or so, at least. While I think that stuff kind of blows over and the regulations get more sorted out, that's also been a big thing. We were hearing consistently from institutions. Just these regulations are making them weary of jumping into crypto, full stop, I should say. On the bright side, though, we were hearing consistently that basically all the major traffic institutions are looking into tokenization. They kind of see, I think, down the line, you're talking about a five to ten year range, that tokenization of assets can be very, very powerful.
00:15:29.010 - 00:16:13.074, Speaker C: We've seen some proof of concepts of this. Different places are all kind of either trying to build or buy some sort of tokenization platform, like big names, JPM included, and others are all trying to build or buy some sort of tokenization platform. So I think long term institutions are going to be there, but I think short term it could be a little tough. We're also talking with credit funds a lot, too. And one of the interesting things there, I think, is the crypto can save operational overhead with them, and I think that much is clear to these funds. But right now, with the regulation and usability concerns, there's all these other costs that add up there that make it sort of in the total package. It's probably not worth it for them yet.
00:16:13.074 - 00:16:27.238, Speaker C: And so I think that's another area where crypto really needs to help improve things on the UX and just usability. And also, how do they fit into their workflow? Things like taxes, things like operations. These are questions that need to be answered, I think, before we're going to see more of that adoption on the credit fund side.
00:16:27.324 - 00:16:46.254, Speaker B: Totally. And I personally kind of like when institutions get a little spooked, because I think crypto is really like a bottoms up movement. Right. And it's nice that individuals can kind of front run institutions. So let's talk a little bit about the alpha for individuals on the Goldfinch side. So how can listeners take advantage of.
00:16:46.292 - 00:17:35.680, Speaker A: This private credit mean? The way to take advantage of it is to use Goldfinch is a great way to do it. And the way to use Goldfinch is basically two steps. Sign up and then invest. Basically is like the quick answer, but the process involves going to the Goldfinch site, which is at Goldfinch Finance is the site, and then there's a sign up flow where you essentially, you need to go through KYC, which is actually a unique thing that Goldfinch does. But you get set up and then you can invest. And so right now, the primary open deal is what we call the senior pool. And we could describe that later, but that's basically a pool that is diversified across all of the different underlying business loans through the platform.
00:17:35.680 - 00:18:03.046, Speaker A: But what also has been happening is the protocol has been opening up new deals over time, and so new deals will continue to be opening up. And so that's the second way, which is you can sign up to get notifications or you can just check. And then when a new deal opens up for a particular business, you can invest in that business, or you can provide a loan to that business, basically. And so that's the high level way to participate, basically sign up. And then there's the open deals and you invest in it.
00:18:03.068 - 00:18:10.566, Speaker C: Yeah, and we had an open deal that's actually closing tomorrow. So this actually will probably air later, but these deals are continuing to happen.
00:18:10.588 - 00:18:19.238, Speaker B: And we'll be opening them more amazing. And talk to us a little bit about these businesses just to kind of get the listeners to understand what's possible on Goldfinch.
00:18:19.334 - 00:19:10.346, Speaker A: Sure. So the kinds of businesses that are borrowing through Goldfinch, we describe them as fintech and lending businesses that are operating around the world. And so what these businesses do is they make loans to consumers and small businesses, or just businesses in general around the world. And they have some capability in their local market, like, basically some advantage there that enables them to make really good loans out in their local markets. And then they have a track record of many years of being able to make loans to these consumers and businesses and show that they are profitable over time across the many sub loans that they have. And then based upon that profitability and that prior track record, they can come to Goldfinch and say, look, we have shown that we have this demonstrated performance. We just need more capital to expand our loan book.
00:19:10.346 - 00:20:01.226, Speaker A: And that's essentially what all of the businesses on Goldfinch are doing, is they're saying they just need capital as their productive asset to just expand their operations. And so I think it's helpful to provide two examples of some really cool companies. But there's like a whole bunch of companies that have effectively been able to borrow money through the protocol. The first is the one that Blake alluded to, which is called FAS financial. And they essentially provide financial services to small and medium sized enterprises in Singapore and Indonesia. So they provide basically financial services and payment services, and then they can use that information to provide shorter term working capital loans to these businesses, like 30 to 45, 60 day kinds of loans. And so they have been doing this for a while.
00:20:01.226 - 00:20:33.138, Speaker A: They just raised a large round with Tiger Global. And so they just need more money to expand their operations. And so they opened up this recent deal with Goldfinch that's just closing now, basically, as we speak, to expand their operations here and to make more of these working capital loans to small businesses. And so that's one example. But just to give another example of on the entire other end of the spectrum is a company called Tagende. They are based in Uganda and Kenya. And what they do is they provide loans for motorcycle taxis.
00:20:33.138 - 00:21:22.102, Speaker A: So the way the Uber of Uganda works is you give people motorcycle taxi rides. And so they go to what they call micro entrepreneurs, individuals who want to get a motorcycle so they can start earning through this gig economy living and doing basically taxi rides. So it's like a $2,000 motorcycle, and Tagandi will lend it to them. And then it's like rent to own over the period of two years. And the trick here, the way that Tagandi is able to be so effective is they put a GPS unit on the motorcycle, and so if the person stops paying for the motorcycle, they can actually go and retrieve the asset itself. And so they have a very strong repayment rate. And what Tagende was doing is they had been operating in Uganda for a while with tens of thousands of micro entrepreneur customers.
00:21:22.102 - 00:21:57.342, Speaker A: And they wanted to expand in Kenya, so they borrowed through Goldfinch to expand and basically start up their operations in has, which they've been now doing over the past year or so. So that's another example. And again, they are also a lending business. The Goldfinch community is providing capital to them to be able to lend it out to these individuals who are now doing essentially like Uber taxi rides on motorcycles. And so those are just like two examples, but all the businesses that are borrowing through Gulf Edge are using it to grow their businesses and have this very clear impact in their local markets.
00:21:57.406 - 00:22:09.078, Speaker B: Amazing. I love those examples. And it's great to know that the deals are timely. And talk to us a little bit about how the protocol works. You obviously have lenders and borrowers, but talk to us about how the marketplace works.
00:22:09.164 - 00:23:14.138, Speaker A: Sure, I can talk through it. So at a high level, the way it works is Goldfinch is built on Ethereum and it's a protocol. And so, yeah, there's borrowers who come to the platform that are looking for capital, and then there's lenders who supply to those borrowers. The high level works is that the big thing that we're trying to solve here, especially when you compare it to other protocols, is like if you look at compound or Aave, like Blake described before, you need to put up, say, $150 worth of ETH, you over collateralize it in order to borrow $100 worth of USDC. But for a lot of these businesses, that's almost not even like a loan, because the whole reason they want money is they don't have capital to begin with. And so we have to base it off of not their existing cash on hand, essentially, but based upon their operations and the off chain kind of collateral that they have. And so that the way it works is the borrower will come to the platform and they say, here's an amount of money that we want to borrow, and they provide a ton of information.
00:23:14.138 - 00:24:14.586, Speaker A: And then there are the investors who evaluate that borrower. We call them the backers, and they evaluate them, and they provide capital directly to that borrower based upon the information they're sharing. That's off chain. And they sign a legal document with that borrower, which includes the collateral of their off chain assets or their future receivables or what their holdings are as a company. So they supply capital through the protocol directly to that borrower, and then that is effectively how that works, and that's how a loan takes place. There's also what I described of the senior pool, which is a diversified pool that also goes into these deals, specifically why it's called a senior pool, is it goes into the senior tranches of these loans. And so if you're not familiar with the phrase tranching, the way that these loans can work is you can have different levels of tranching where the senior tranche essentially gets money back first before subsequent tranches.
00:24:14.586 - 00:24:56.982, Speaker A: So it's like when money comes back in, who has first claimed the assets. And so we break it up into two tranches. The senior pool goes into the senior tranche, and it takes a slightly lower interest rate, but it's also more protected because it gets money back first. And so if investors can also supply into the senior pool, which goes into these senior tranches, which also effectively is going into these loans, but it's both more protected and has a lower yield. And so that's basically how the whole system works. But the simplified answer is borrowers bring a pool, which basically a loan, and then these backers vet the deal, and they supply capital directly to those borrowers.
00:24:57.046 - 00:25:06.010, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. And is it fully permissionless where the investors are on their own to vet the deals, or is there an initial vetting process on the side of Goldfinch?
00:25:06.090 - 00:25:06.286, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:06.308 - 00:26:12.498, Speaker A: The general way the vetting process goes is it is up to the backers to vet the deal. But we have also started a community driven credit memo program, which is where really experienced credit analysts will also evaluate these deals and then write up detailed credit memos to support them. In addition, the borrowers themselves, before they can even open up a pool and get loans, they present their information to the community, and they have to be approved by the community to basically be a borrower in the first place. So there's a couple of stops of the borrower proving that they are real and sharing information, and the community can discuss with them, and then they provide really detailed information. And then there's these credit analysts who help to analyze the deal and write credit memos that also provide their experience, sort of assessment of the borrower to ensure that they are good. And then in addition, it's also responsibility of the backers to do their own vetting as well, to make sure that they are comfortable with the terms.
00:26:12.584 - 00:26:15.598, Speaker B: And what's the incentive structure for these credit analysts?
00:26:15.694 - 00:26:17.998, Speaker C: Yeah, they're just paid by the community's.
00:26:18.014 - 00:26:20.118, Speaker A: Paying them to do the work.
00:26:20.204 - 00:26:29.958, Speaker B: Amazing. Okay, cool. So the different roles in the network, how you can earn in the goldfinch ecosystem, it sounds like there's borrowers, there's lenders, and then there's credit analysts. Anything else?
00:26:30.044 - 00:26:31.978, Speaker A: Those are the big pieces of it.
00:26:32.064 - 00:26:40.662, Speaker B: Okay, awesome. And then talk to us about how interest rates are set. Are those completely set by the individuals, or do you guys help to kind of find that equilibrium?
00:26:40.726 - 00:27:04.814, Speaker C: Yeah. So the interest rate is basically, you can think of, it's like proposed. The borrower kind of has a sense of what market rates are and is discussing that with some of the community, and then they're just proposing a rate. And so if investors don't like that, they can just choose not to invest, or they could put something up on the forums and say they don't want to do that, which hasn't really happened, to be honest. But they really just kind of proposed. It's sort of like figured out ahead of time.
00:27:04.852 - 00:27:33.690, Speaker A: I would also add that just the way it tends to work is there's usually conversations back and forth before a borrower will share it, as in an official proposal. So usually the borrowers will chat with different members of the community, including folks from our team, but also other folks where we're talking through what the options might be and what the interest rates might be. So usually there's, from the social dynamic, a little bit of consensus of what seems reasonable with members of the community before the official proposal is made to get approved.
00:27:33.770 - 00:27:52.690, Speaker B: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. And then you touched on this a bit, but there is kind of some tension in the approach around centralized elements with KYC. But then you're also kind of blockchain maximalist. So can you talk to us a little bit about the decision to incorporate KYC and then also the benefits of using blockchain technology?
00:27:52.840 - 00:28:34.458, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So I think KYC is a good topic to discuss here. So first off, in terms of, just like, why fundamentally, the big main reason is that borrowers who are real business out in the world, they have KYC obligations. And it's very strict, really all over the world, that if you don't follow that, then if they were to borrow from Goldfinch, that would be basically illegal, or they could face a lot of strict penalties for doing that. So the borrowers definitely require it. And then I think it's an important thing to think about Kyc and this kind of centralization thing similar to stablecoins, in that there are stablecoins that are centralized, but the protocols can be decentralized around them. Right.
00:28:34.458 - 00:29:23.914, Speaker C: And the fact that compound uses USDC, for example, doesn't make compound necessarily centralized. And similarly, with the golf Vents protocol, Goldfinch community could choose to swap out to a different KYC provider if they wanted to, in the same way that compound could swap out and say, I'm not using USDC anymore, if they didn't like the way USDC was acting. So I think it is a centralized element, but it is sort of a tool that the protocol uses, and the protocol itself can still be decentralized. And that's kind of how we think about this blockchain, as Mike was kind of alluding to before. The blockchain really adds here, I think is a couple pieces. It adds accessibility through operational benefits as well as liquidity enhancing, you know, example of this is actually the callable deal that we just did that is live right now in closing basically as we're speaking. But this is a new deal that Goldwich was doing with this bar that we were calling callable.
00:29:23.914 - 00:30:05.166, Speaker C: It really means you have the ability to redeem your principal every quarter. So this is a really big win for liquidity from the investor standpoint. And what's interesting about this is the blockchain is really helping to improve the operational components of this and really make this deal much more feasible when you're talking about having lots of investors. So what this means as a borrower, at every quarter people will come in and say, okay, I'd like my principal back. And that could be hundreds or thousands of investors investing in a deal. And in traditional finance, that would be quite a lot of operational overhead for a borrower. They either need to be paying a lot of intermediaries to be doing this kind of stuff for them, or they need to themselves deal with, okay, I've got 25 requests coming in.
00:30:05.166 - 00:30:39.714, Speaker C: They're coming in from people all over the world. I need to send this money to different places, whatever their payment system is. And it's going to cost XYZ amount of capital to do that. But in crypto land, when we write a smart contract to do this, that borrower sends a single payment, no matter how many investors there are, going right to the smart contract. Then the smart contract handles everything else. No matter what financial system those investors are on, they can just pull their appropriate amount out from the smart contract. So that's an example where we're using the blockchain to improve the operational standards, which then lets us do structures that improve the liquidity of these deals, especially for many, many investors.
00:30:39.714 - 00:31:25.014, Speaker C: And so that's just one area where we think blockchain can help. But there's other sort of liquidity enhancing structures that are just a lot easier and cheaper to do on chain. So an example here is kind of similar to our senior pool, where there can be extra capital that sits in the pool, it can affect the rate in a variable way. And then people can instantly remove capital if there is capital there. If not, it can move to a kind of withdraw system that has pro rata effects based on how much capital is coming in. And if you were going to do that kind of stuff in traditional finance, that would take custodians and third parties verifying balances of bank accounts and saying, well, how much was there each day? And then you probably need to have licenses to be able to send the money back and forth on behalf of other people. But the noncustodial nature of blockchain means those are all kind of peer to peer transactions or they're mediated through a smart contract which no one needs to control.
00:31:25.014 - 00:31:40.842, Speaker C: And so again, we're just reducing costs on these structures that enhance the liquidity for these individuals. Not to mention all the transparency benefits of knowing exactly when payments are coming in, which is something that a lot of private credit is very opaque and it's very untransparent. And so we think blockchain improves a lot of things there as well.
00:31:40.896 - 00:31:48.970, Speaker B: Totally. Transparency, efficiency and cost reduction. And. Yeah, from traditional finance, like the T plus two settle and then stuff breaks downstream.
00:31:49.050 - 00:31:49.674, Speaker C: Oh, my goodness.
00:31:49.722 - 00:31:49.934, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:49.972 - 00:31:50.414, Speaker C: Crazy, right?
00:31:50.452 - 00:31:57.598, Speaker B: It's amazing. It's amazing how much more efficient it is. And talk to us a little bit about the culture within Goldbench, the ethos, the vision.
00:31:57.694 - 00:33:09.334, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think a big part of the ethos in general is this desire to, in this commitment to having real impact out in the world and really making sure that we're using the benefits of blockchain and crypto to improve the way systems work even outside of the crypto space. And so I think the very first loan that happened through Goldfinch was to a company in Mexico that provides smartphone financing to consumers. And then the second one was in Nigeria. And so basically from the very first dollar that went through the protocol, it was all about, okay, how do we take these benefits of crypto and have that sort of impact directly in the world? And there's two aspects of that ethos and that vision. One is just kind of like the mission of having impact and really this path to expanding access to capital and really improving the way our systems work. But the second is also about doing really having really high quality borrowers and taking a long term view towards sustainable and strong systems.
00:33:09.334 - 00:34:12.326, Speaker A: And so where a lot of what has happened, especially within lending in the past, it has been towards, say, more like market makers or traders within crypto, that can be highly volatile. It's highly tied to the crypto markets and it's also just riskier. We kind of like, from the very beginning, had this view of like, okay, we want to take a more sustainable and higher quality kind of path there. And so going to these borrowers, not only does it have more impact, but they're also really high quality businesses and they're like long term businesses, and they're looking to use the money to expand operations over years, not over months or weeks or something like that. And that is part of the reason why we have not seen on the Goldfinch protocol any defaults to date is that focus. And so that's also a focus on long term sustainability. And so I think those are the two big parts that tie together as part of our ethos here, which is having that impact and then really focusing on long term sustainable and high quality kinds of efforts.
00:34:12.438 - 00:34:21.550, Speaker B: Amazing. And I imagine a lot of this is kind of red pilling a lot of these more traditional companies into crypto and web three. Is that the case? And can you talk a little bit about it?
00:34:21.620 - 00:34:46.246, Speaker C: Yeah. So we do have to onboard these borrowers into crypto, which means getting them set up with metamask accounts and teaching them about using hardware wallets in some cases, or gnosis multisigs, and also getting usually set up with an exchange account like Coinbase or binance or something like that. So, yeah, I mean, we are definitely bringing on net new people into the space. And that's one of the things I think I'm most proud about doing. And I think we're going to keep doing it.
00:34:46.268 - 00:35:29.782, Speaker A: I'll just add quickly, there's a couple of stories with borrowers where they were doing their very first transaction, where they are hitting the button to draw down capital for a loan, and then they hit it and it lands in their address within what? Within a minute? Within like 20 seconds. And they're like, oh, my God, it's like a light bulb moment when that happens. Because they're used to the company in Chagende, for example, the last time they had raised before Goldfinch, it took like over a week for them to get the money. And their bank account had, what's the word? Denied the initial wire from this other investor, and they had to do it again. It's like a whole thing. And then they go to Golfinch and within 20 seconds it's right there in their address. And they're like, this is crazy.
00:35:29.782 - 00:35:45.782, Speaker A: We had another one who said something similar. And so it's about asking them to jump through a few hoops and try this out. But then when they do it and it lands in their address within seconds, it's like mind blowing to them. We've seen that happen a number of times now with some of these borrowers.
00:35:45.846 - 00:35:58.394, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah, I think we've all been there with that light bulb moment. Incredible. Doing God's work. Let's talk a little bit about how much diversity there is in the borrower pool and how does the money make its way to actual businesses.
00:35:58.522 - 00:36:43.118, Speaker A: The borrowers on Goldfinch, the loans that Goldfinch has made, as I mentioned, they all are going to businesses that have lending operations within the local markets. But those lending operations vary across a wide range of sectors and industries, as well as geographies. So I gave two examples, like one of FAs that does SME lending to businesses in Indonesia and Singapore, another one to Gendi, that's more towards these kind of consumer entrepreneurs. In Uganda and Kenya, there's like a wide variety of them. And so they all have lending businesses, but it's across now, 20. Over 20 countries, a combination of businesses and consumers. And so there's quite a bit of diversification globally and across industries there.
00:36:43.118 - 00:37:28.566, Speaker A: And then you asked about how the money actually lands in the hands of folks in the local markets. The general path is these borrowers will set up accounts with some kind of an off ramp. So they might use Coinbase, or they might use Kraken or binance, or like one of these kinds of businesses, they will draw down USDC. Everything is done in USDC on the protocol. They draw down the USDC as their loan into their address, and they send it to whatever off ramp that they use, let's say Coinbase. And then from Coinbase, they withdraw the capital to their local bank account in whatever country they are. And then now they have the money in their local bank account and they continue their business operations the same way they do always, which is like they use their local fiat, and they send that to their customers or clients as loans.
00:37:28.566 - 00:37:56.738, Speaker A: However they do that. And then if they get repayments back in and they owe interest back into the protocol, they do the same steps in reverse, which is like, they take the capital, they on ramp it with an exchange, and they send the USDC to their address, and they're able to make the interest payment directly through the protocol. So that's effectively how the capital is getting from USDC and the protocol all the way into the hands of a consumer who is borrowing a motorcycle, essentially.
00:37:56.834 - 00:38:05.650, Speaker B: Amazing. And I have to ask, were you impacted by Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and the DPEG of USDC recently.
00:38:05.730 - 00:38:08.150, Speaker C: So the short answer is no, we were not.
00:38:08.220 - 00:38:08.770, Speaker A: Thankfully.
00:38:08.850 - 00:38:38.622, Speaker C: Yeah, thankfully. The goldfish borrowers are, as we're saying, all over the world, so they're in many, many jurisdictions that are, most of the money is not in the US. And so therefore, Operation choke point sort of by definition, would not have as much impact. And then USDC DPeg, it quickly re pegged and the smart contract actually sort of assumed that USDC was worth a dollar. So it didn't affect know. None of the borrowers did anything weird anyway. But even if they had, since the price came back, everything was fine.
00:38:38.676 - 00:38:43.802, Speaker B: Okay. And there wasn't like an uproar in the community because of the smart contract keeping it at a dollar.
00:38:43.866 - 00:39:00.678, Speaker C: Oh, some people were a little concerned. They were like, oh, is something going to go wrong? Or whatever? And the church just, everything was fine, so everything's cooled down. Even. I was a little worried for a bit, but thinking about, it's like, actually, no, it's going to come back and it'll be fine.
00:39:00.844 - 00:39:33.554, Speaker A: We started thinking through, okay, what are all the different options we would have to resolve it. And even if there were a sustained DPEG, there were a number of paths we could have taken, but it was great to see the community keeping tabs on the state of affairs here and bringing up questions. And so we did. We had to have a conversation with the community to talk through what we might need to do and what the options are. And it was great to see folks be very involved and thinking through what needs to happen. And I'm sure this won't be the last time we have something that we need to deal with as a community. But it was good to see that this was resolved pretty well.
00:39:33.554 - 00:39:43.042, Speaker A: And I think the next time anything happens, I'm sure concerns will be raised, willing to talk about it, talk to solutions the same way. All of that stuff is always kind of like handled totally.
00:39:43.106 - 00:39:48.594, Speaker B: And would you move to a more decentralized stablecoin if one had the right liquidity?
00:39:48.722 - 00:40:11.182, Speaker C: I think it depends on what the borrowers want to do, and there's really nothing stopping the protocol from having multiple stablecoins be used. And we've kind of thought about that as a thing that we might want to happen, but so far there hasn't been enough of a need. And borrowers currently, for the most part, feel the most comfortable with USDC, but it's just kind of up to them.
00:40:11.236 - 00:40:15.410, Speaker B: Totally fair. And then what kind of yield can lenders expect on the platform?
00:40:15.560 - 00:40:40.326, Speaker A: The loans that go through goldfinge range between around ten to 15% yields. And so that's generally the range terms. Oh, in UCC terms. So, for example, the recent deal that was open, it's a 13% yield to the lenders who provide to that deal. They tend to range based upon what the market rates are and the size of the company. But that's the general range, ten to 15%.
00:40:40.428 - 00:40:53.478, Speaker B: Amazing. And I know Mazari reported that you guys grew outstanding loans by 162% year over year in 2022 with no defaults, as you alluded to earlier. Can you tell us a little bit about the growth you've been seeing?
00:40:53.584 - 00:41:31.130, Speaker A: Yeah. And so a lot of that growth was driven in early 2022. We were doubling every month and expanding to all of these expanding loans across all of these countries now in over 20 countries. And so, yeah, that was great to see the early growth. And then also kind of what also happened in the most recent sort of year, too, is after we grew pretty significantly in early 2022, we saw the broader markets, like the broader crypto markets, having a downturn. And there was like seeing overall DFI, TVL was falling maybe about like 75% or so. I think in that time frame, I don't know the exact numbers.
00:41:31.130 - 00:42:23.942, Speaker A: And then also when you look at other kinds of credit protocols, like Goldfinch saw similar overall dips in the TVL and the active loans that were going through these protocols, like similar to 70% plus declines. But during that same time, Goldfinch has held steady and hasn't had declines and also hasn't had any defaults. And that is testament to what I described before of going to borrowers who are really high quality and are not tied to the crypto market. So, like, when the crypto markets fell so significantly, and a lot of, say, market makers and traders who had borrowed through different kinds of protocols, their demand fell. And also some of these protocols experienced losses as well. But with Goldfinch, the borrowers are still providing to small businesses in Indonesia and taxi drivers in Kenya. And so that was not affected by the crypto markets.
00:42:23.942 - 00:42:43.278, Speaker A: And so Goldfinch was able to maintain the same level of active loans. That's held steady, and we've continued to see zero losses through it. And that's what we expect to continue to see there as we start to grow again, as the markets have come back a little bit. And so that's like, the high level of what Goldfinch has seen. I think what has set it apart amazing.
00:42:43.364 - 00:42:53.442, Speaker B: Yeah, it's nice that it's decorrelated. And I know you guys have been making waves on the UX and UI side between account abstraction embedded wallets. Can you tell us a little bit about that?
00:42:53.576 - 00:43:29.962, Speaker C: Yeah, so basically I think that this is going to be the year for crypto UX to really start to step up. There's a lot of technologies that are coming together this year. Notably you have layer twos, which obviously have already been in production for a couple of years, but you have the Cancun upgrade happening which is going to reduce their fees by another ten to 100 x. You've got account abstraction, the ERT four, three, seven that has recently kind of been launched. And then you also have these things like embedded wallets which are starting to launch as well. These kind of wallet as a service programs. Coinbase launched one, but there's other ones, web three, auth, there's biconomy.
00:43:29.962 - 00:44:08.726, Speaker C: There's a number of players now in the space that are getting to this embedded wallet thing. I think you put all those three things together and all of a sudden crypto can start making experiences that rival web two or even surpass them in certain cases. And we think this is going to be a really important trend coming through the whole crypto space over the next year. And so it's something we are very interested in starting to bring to the Goldfinch protocol. We really want to really create the next level, set the new standard for DFI UX. It's not live yet, but it's being actively worked on. And I think this is just going to be such a great thing because I feel like you just look around, right, how many users Coinbase has, right, it's like 100 million users.
00:44:08.726 - 00:44:36.454, Speaker C: How many users just like compound and Unisoft have thousands of users and it hasn't really even been growing that much. And I think a lot of that does come down to the UX. Right. Obviously people are interested in crypto. They want to be going to a place like Coinbase, but they need an experience that just works with them. Right. And I think the cost of using L ones being prohibitive, the crazy metamask stuff of having to use chrome extensions, you put it all together and it just stacks up and it's just kind of too much when you have other alternative that are pretty good in web two space.
00:44:36.454 - 00:44:44.134, Speaker C: And so I think it's time for web three and noncustodial stuff to really step up. And so we're interested in kind of leading that charge and I think it's going to be the year to do it.
00:44:44.172 - 00:44:51.066, Speaker B: Amazing. And for listeners who might not be familiar, can you double click into the Cancun upgrade and what embedded wallets are?
00:44:51.168 - 00:45:29.682, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. I should have said that. So the cancun upgrade is an ethereum level upgrade that's going to be taking place within the next few months. It's later for sometime this summer, and they're going to be basically introducing this new opcode around call data that's going to make things very, very cheap for l two s specifically to send their call data to L one. And so the net effect of this is that l two s only not ethereum itself, but l two s will get ten to 100 x cheaper than they already are, and they're already ten to 100 x cheaper than l one is. So this is going to make them very cheap. Usually maybe sub pennies or like a few pennies for transactions.
00:45:29.682 - 00:46:07.998, Speaker C: And of course they'll also be fast. And then things like embedded wallets. What this means is you don't have to use metamask, right? So an app itself could use one of these embedded wallet providers and could create a wallet for you right there in the app. It's still self custodial. It'll use things like multiparty computation, or MPC, which has also been something that it's been getting developed and maturing over the last few years to make sure that it's still kind of like a multi Sig wallet, except it feels like an EOA or externally owned account, like a normal metamask one. But it's actually got the multi sig security, which is even better, much better than using metamask in terms of security. So it's going to be safer, and I think it's going to be more flexible as well.
00:46:07.998 - 00:46:42.282, Speaker C: And it'll be right in the app, so no need for an extension. And you could do things like social, sign in, log in with Google, or log in with Facebook if you really wanted to. And I think you put all these things together, it's kind of like, oh, you just sign up for an app, there's no extensions, it's fast, it's cheap. A lot of apps, when things get that cheap, are probably just going to start paying for the gas of their users for them, because it's just not that big of a deal. A few thousand bucks could probably pay for tons and tons of transactions. And so I think this is where you're going to start to see users go, oh, this is just great. I barely even know that I'm using the crypto blockchain thing, but I'm starting to get the benefits of it.
00:46:42.336 - 00:46:52.686, Speaker B: Amazing. Super exciting. I guess now the question is, now that we've solved scaling, what are we going to do with the extra block space we have? What are some of the use cases you guys are most excited about?
00:46:52.788 - 00:47:43.730, Speaker C: So, I mean, one thing, I think that when you can sort of get that kind of speed and that kind of scale, things like Uniswap should be able to basically implement real order books and actually get that efficiency that people like out of centralized exchanges and the speed. But we'll have the non custodial nature which just completely eliminates the risks that we saw with things like FTX and I think will help move more people on chain as the native way they do things because exchanges and trading have historically been the primary thing that people are doing with crypto. And so moving that fully on chain in a way that completely rivals the web two experience I think will be transformative for getting a lot of the 100 million users that Coinbase has to just say, oh yeah, I'm just going to do thing everything on chain in my wallet and I'm just going to have money already there. So it sounds like maybe it's not too exciting, but I think overall the net effect will be really powerful for the space. So that's one I'm excited about.
00:47:43.800 - 00:47:47.038, Speaker B: Amazing. Mike, anything you're excited about on the horizon?
00:47:47.134 - 00:48:24.622, Speaker A: No, I believe in the similar kinds of things. And then also what you mentioned of how will we use the extra block space, I don't think we'll have any trouble doing it. I feel like what we've been doing as an industry over the past few years is really working within pretty significant constraints. And I think there's like a whole slew of design space that we can make more sort of involved or nuanced sort of product experiences that are based on that. So I'm also just kind of excited for the new ideas that we come up with that will be possible because of this basically new space we have to work with.
00:48:24.676 - 00:48:35.870, Speaker B: Totally amazing. Well, let's talk a little bit about your token. You launched it about a year ago. What is the approach that you guys took to protocol fees and tell us a little bit about how that may accrue to token holders.
00:48:35.950 - 00:49:16.670, Speaker A: Sure. So yeah, there's a token, but yeah, talking first about the protocol fees, right now the protocol takes fees in two ways. One is 10% of interest goes to the protocol treasury and then 0.5% of withdrawals also go to the treasury. So the community's treasury has been accruing revenue in this way over time, then to speak to the. And the protocol can now use that to pay for lots of different things, like paying for community moderators in the discord. Paying for the community just paid for actually a legal template to use for future deals, which is great because those can get really expensive.
00:49:16.670 - 00:50:04.830, Speaker A: The community went with like a top law firm and had this legal template. So the community's been using that which just benefits everyone who's participating in the protocol. There's also the token GFI, which is a governance token. So this is the mechanism we use for making changes to the protocol, where people who have the governance token of GFI can participate in votes on any change that the protocol is making. One thing that is really cool is the way that the votes are used, the way the votes are calculated. I'm forgetting actually the phrase for it at the moment, but quadratic voting. The protocol uses quadratic voting, which is really unique, where you use the square root of the vote amount per person.
00:50:04.830 - 00:50:53.390, Speaker A: And that helps to ensure that it's like a more kind of like equitable vote. And you can't have whales with the token really significantly sway the vote there. And we're able to do that because we have civil resistance, which means that we can prevent people from creating just multiple accounts, because we can use that KYC element to know that they're individual users. So we can separately describe this, I think, very cool way that the governance token works for making votes. But in addition, another thing that you can do with the governance token is you can participate in membership. And so membership is a system that the protocol launched, which is a way to enhance the lending apy that you're already getting. So for folks who have already participated and supplied to borrowers, they're effectively paying this fee as a percent of interest.
00:50:53.390 - 00:51:50.110, Speaker A: Well, they can also participate in membership, which is when you provide the capital that you've went out, like the NFT that's used for it, and you put it into membership, and then you also include the GFI tokens, you get a portion of the revenue that's coming into the protocol. So 50% of the revenue that is going into the protocol's treasury has been allocated to this membership program, which is effectively like an API enhancement on the lending API. So you need to have both, basically, like when you've lend to the protocol, you use the token basically as your ticket to participate in membership and get even higher yield there. And there's more complicated dynamics of how it works. But basically the idea is to have a relatively equal amount of capital position and the GFI token to basically optimize the extra yields you're getting on your capital position.
00:51:50.180 - 00:52:52.846, Speaker C: I was going to say one thing, I think, to add to this, Mike actually wrote a whole piece on this whole membership thing and how we were thinking about it that I think is just worth touching on here, which is this idea of what we're calling owner centric model. It's kind of a typical one versus like a participant centric model. And we really felt like we wanted goldfish to have more of a participant centric model. So instead of, we think a lot of protocols, a lot of tokens were starting coming at this question of like, we have people who own the token, what should we give them to do? And we wanted to kind of flip that around and be like, we have people using the protocol, how do we get them to feel like owners? Right? And how do we get them to want to buy into the protocol itself and act like owners? And that's where we said, okay, no, you need to actually be participating as a lender in the protocol. And then if you also have governance token, great, you can put those things together and you can get an apy enhancement. That's something that builds on the value that that participant is already getting and using the token to help enhance the value they're already getting versus looking at as like, well, these people own the token. How do we just give them money or give them something to do? Which I think is sort of the wrong way to go about it.
00:52:52.846 - 00:53:01.430, Speaker C: I feel like it's kind of flipped and it fits more within the ethos. Crypto to us, because crypto is about having kind of user owners, right? And they're both at the same time.
00:53:01.500 - 00:53:24.480, Speaker B: I love that. I'm going to start tasking the graph holders with some of my day to day work. I think it's genius. And it's nice because people feel bought in and they feel like they're making a difference, which I really like. Can you tell us a little bit about how you went about that? Who comes up with the tasks? Who participates? Is it all kind of permissionless? Whoever wants to do you kind of have a group of people you go to, how does it work?
00:53:25.330 - 00:53:39.554, Speaker C: Our system right now is really about, if you are a lender, if you're an investor in the deals, then you can use the token to enhance that value you're already getting of participating in these deals. It's not like an open tax marketplace. So that sounds like a cool idea.
00:53:39.672 - 00:53:44.990, Speaker B: Okay, interesting. And with finding the legal template, can you tell us a little bit about how that went?
00:53:45.080 - 00:54:44.418, Speaker A: Yeah, we have a discourse page, like a governance forum, where anyone can make proposals, and then the community has already basically paid for community moderators that help moderate the process. But effectively, it's like anybody can make a proposal of something and then the community votes on it. And so we've had a few different kinds of tasks in the past where it's basically a community member saying, I think this thing would be beneficial for the Goldfinch community. Here's what I'd like to do, and here's how I'd like to be paid for it. And so I think that has worked pretty well so far with including things like the legal templates and other things like that. And so that's been going well. And then I think what would happen as it starts to really scale up? If we get to a ton of tasks, then we probably need to get to more of like a grand system and have subcommunities that are able to do some of the vetting.
00:54:44.418 - 00:54:54.150, Speaker A: But right now, the volume hasn't been over burdensome for the community. So that's the way it works right now, is basically these proposals to the community, and then they get voted on. On snapshot.
00:54:54.230 - 00:55:01.642, Speaker B: Exciting. Okay, cool. And then talk to us about your roadmap for 2023 and 2024 and any layer two plans you have.
00:55:01.696 - 00:56:05.730, Speaker A: High level. It really comes back to what Blake described before about seems like we're at this moment where different technologies are coming together that make it possible to offer a really strong experience for folks, for broader consumers, essentially to use protocols. I still think it is really surprising to me that there's so many people who have used Coinbase, but a small, much smaller sliver of folks who've actually used protocols. And I think, as Blake described, it is tied back to the UX experience. And when we incorporate things like embedded wallets and account abstraction, and also layer twos to reduce the fees of gas or even just remove them entirely, that opens up a really wide group of potential folks who could use a protocol like Goldfinch, who might otherwise not be able to use the metamask plugin. And you go to the exchange and you get Ethereum and you send it over, plus your money, and you have to go through all these different steps. And so the roadmap, I would say, is a combination of two things.
00:56:05.730 - 00:57:05.998, Speaker A: One is really making this the new standard for what it looks like to have a protocol UI experience. That is not just like hoops that a more consumer oriented market needs to jump through, but just actually like an amazing experience that rivals or is even better than a web two experience. So that's one aspect of it is just like making that experience just like 100 x better than it is today. The second thing is, what we also alluded to before, is that one of the superpowers of crypto is improving the liquidity and the operational efficiency of doing these loans. And we as a community made this initial kind of improvement that the callable loan structure that Blake described, where on a quarterly basis you can request your capital back and the borrower will supply it back to you. And smart contracts are automatically handling all the operational complexities of that. But what that means for the investor is way higher liquidity than otherwise.
00:57:05.998 - 00:57:53.922, Speaker A: Typically with a private credit deal, you put capital in and like minimum three years, but often even longer. Kind of a thing is when you can actually see the capital back. But crypto enables us to improve the liquidity there. So the second part of the roadmap is about more mechanics like that. How can we keep leveraging these benefits of crypto to keep increasing the liquidity and what's possible there on the loans? And so those are the two big high level aspects of the roadmap is one is make that ux, just like well beyond anything we've seen with protocols in the past. And then the second is continue to push on the increase of liquidity on these loans with mechanics like the callable loans. But building on that and making that possible, those are the two parts of it.
00:57:53.976 - 00:58:00.546, Speaker B: Amazing. I want to get to the layer two piece in a second, but before we do, can we just double click into what account abstraction is for the listeners?
00:58:00.658 - 00:58:40.002, Speaker C: Yes. So account abstraction is a standard that has been created called ERC four three seven. And what it does is it creates these just a set of standards that allows for smart contract wallets to exist on chain. And smart contract wallets means that the user is interacting with a protocol through a smart contract. And the upshot of this is that that smart contract can do a lot of cool stuff for the user. It can do stuff like bundle together many transactions, for instance, like, oh, I want to swap this token on uniswap, turn it into USDC, and then invest over here and compound and boom, you could just turn that into one bundle and make all one transaction to do that. Because the smart contract can do many things at once.
00:58:40.002 - 00:59:17.610, Speaker C: It can allow for different types of signing schemes, so allow for you to have a social sign in or use some other sort of cryptographic sign in if you want that. It can allow for gasless transactions or it can allow you to pay in a different token, allow you to do things like I want to pay with USDC for this, but I don't already have Ethereum. Someone else can pay for you and handle the ethereum while you just pay a little bit more USDC if that's all you have. So huge range of UX improvements are possible through account abstraction, and there's a number of companies who are now trying to make APIs to help developers use account abstraction easier throughout their app. So I think this is going to be a big unlock for the space. We're definitely going to be trying to incorporate it in Goldfund.
00:59:17.690 - 00:59:26.270, Speaker B: Amazing. And then what about plans to migrate to an L two? Are gas costs interfering kind of with you being on Ethereum? Talk to us a little bit about that.
00:59:26.340 - 00:59:56.666, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we definitely want to move to an L two as well. Still thinking through what that would be. But for all the reasons we've talked about, we want to expand to a broad audience. We think many individuals are the right space, people who are still interested in crypto and also going to benefit the most from the deals that go bench is providing. And so we want to create an app and an experience that feels natural for that type of user to use and $15 gas fees is not going to do it. So it has to be way lower. And so we have to move to an L two.
00:59:56.666 - 00:59:58.202, Speaker C: And so we're definitely going to be doing that as well.
00:59:58.256 - 01:00:01.846, Speaker B: Amazing. And then the last question is just how are you both defiant?
01:00:01.958 - 01:00:29.814, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one of the ways we've probably been defiant within the crypto industry is that from the beginning we've been focusing on real world stuff. We can't tell you how many times people told us, why aren't you going after more crypto native borrowers? This seems so silly. What are you doing? And we have defiantly been saying, no, we want people who aren't crypto native to be using our protocol and we're going to continue to do that by pushing out for this more web two experience to get people who aren't already thinking about crypto to start using it.
01:00:29.852 - 01:01:19.526, Speaker A: Yeah, I would just add to that because I agree with that entirely, which is like throughout the entire process of this, but especially at the very beginning, we had many people just straight up tell us, you should go to crypto native borrowers, like you should go to crypto traders and crypto market makers and build for them first and then figure out the rest later. Basically being like going into the real world space and broader global economy is really hard. And we had a lot of people just straight up tell us you shouldn't do that. You should just go to the crypto folks and saying the markets aren't going to like it. Similarly, they were like, you can't do KYC. The crypto space expects to be entirely anonymous. They're not going to be willing to KYC and just basically telling us you shouldn't do it.
01:01:19.526 - 01:02:07.074, Speaker A: But we were just like, no, if we want to actually do the thing that we have to do, which is like the real broader economy, if we want to break out of the crypto space, it's not just going to happen on its own. We have to do that. We have to push through and make that actually work. We have to do things like Kyc. Even though a lot of folks are like, I don't know about Kyc. And it's like, well, if we want to do the thing, that's going to be part of it and then if we want to go to borrowers out in the world and that's where we see the benefit, that's where we see the impact longer term, we have to start from the beginning. And so I think that it has taken several years to, I think now even especially in the past year, we're hearing a lot more about real world assets and tokenization, things like that, which is great to see.
01:02:07.074 - 01:02:31.242, Speaker A: And I hope that as an industry we embrace that and keep pushing on it. But it does require to keep pushing on it because the easiest or most common thing that we hear both within and outside the crypto space is like, oh, that's too hard. Don't do that. Go to the crypto folks kind of thing. And you just got to have to make it happen kind of a thing. And so that's something that we've been doing from the beginning.
01:02:31.306 - 01:02:41.710, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah, you have to create a bridge to the crypto native solutions and it sounds like that's what you guys are doing. So thank you so much for all the efforts there and thanks so much for coming on the Defiant. This was great.
01:02:41.780 - 01:02:42.460, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
