00:00:04.040 - 00:00:05.937, Speaker A: So, well, welcome to Singapore.
00:00:06.041 - 00:00:07.033, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
00:00:07.169 - 00:00:14.833, Speaker A: Can you tell us a little bit about your main goals and objectives for coming to Singapore and particularly from this week?
00:00:14.969 - 00:00:41.029, Speaker B: Yeah, so actually this is the first time that LFM participated in token 2049 and go to Singapore. For us, what was important is to kind of meet in person some of our partners, ongoing discussions also that we have because kind of in a digital world and digital industry, meeting people in person kind of really helps unlock certain discussion projects and things like this. So it's been very successful, honestly for us. Those two short days.
00:00:41.197 - 00:00:54.585, Speaker A: Fantastic. You've been at several panels and like you've given some talks. Right. So what are the key takeaways of those conversations and talks you've had that you can share with us for those who couldn't attend? Of course.
00:00:55.125 - 00:01:31.911, Speaker B: So from the site event that I attended and the event that I was part of, I could see a lot of discussion around. You know, we've seen a lot of fragments, fragmentation into the industry, fragmentation of liquidity, fragmentation of user experience and how can we bring this all back together? And really, so that was a big topic also about, I think Vitalik's speech yesterday. Also a lot of people talked about it, but one of the key points he said that we are no longer early to crypto, but we are early to crypto being usable. And I think user experience, developer experience has also been a very big topic.
00:01:32.033 - 00:01:35.179, Speaker A: So let's talk about Alithium. Is that how I pronounce it?
00:01:35.227 - 00:01:36.371, Speaker B: Yes, that's perfect.
00:01:36.563 - 00:01:38.243, Speaker A: I'm nailing all the pronunciations.
00:01:38.299 - 00:01:41.775, Speaker B: Yeah. So far you've been like 10 out of 10.
00:01:42.115 - 00:01:50.987, Speaker A: Awesome. Can you tell us a little bit about your journey into the crypto world and what ultimately led you to joining Alephium?
00:01:51.051 - 00:02:50.305, Speaker B: Yeah, so I discovered crypto in 2017, December 2017, when I joined a Swiss crypto exchange. So my first experience into crypto was a bit painful because I joined right when Bitcoin hit 20,000 for the first time and when the scalability challenges of the industry were first intensely felt with like the cryptokitty on Ethereum. And so that was kind of my baptism by fire from to joining into the crypto ecosystem. I spent a few years into that exchange and then I had worked previously in a different industry with some of the core contributors of Alephium. And when I went to check out what they were doing, it turns out they needed someone that was not a dev to take care about everything that was not development related. And this is what I do at Latin. That's Kind of how I joined in the middle of 2021 just a little bit before Alephium Main at launch.
00:02:50.675 - 00:02:53.219, Speaker A: Awesome. And what is your current role at lefem?
00:02:53.267 - 00:03:12.483, Speaker B: Actually I'm, I'm, you could say I'm the CEO. I'm basically in charge of everything that is not development related or marketing. So I really work on ecosystem development, developer relationship and then all of the boring admin, legal and administrative things that go around that also you have to deal with in a project.
00:03:12.659 - 00:03:13.539, Speaker A: How big is the team?
00:03:13.587 - 00:04:01.875, Speaker B: Actually it's pretty small so we really want to keep the core team quite lean. So, so we have 15 people. A few people are not full time so we would be around 10 to 12 full time equivalent in the core contributor. But this is kind of an intentional design because one, it allows us to be very lean and we've been able to actually deliver pretty fast quality work. But also it's a path to ensuring that we really decentralize in the long term kind of the ecosystem. We really want to empower the ecosystem to shape what llfium will become because at the end of the day we are building for people to use what we do and it's important that the people who use Alephium also feel empowered to evolve it further.
00:04:02.175 - 00:04:12.335, Speaker A: So for those who are unfamiliar with Alephium, can you please introduce the platform, what it is and explain what makes it unique in the blockchain space?
00:04:12.415 - 00:05:12.863, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. I will go a little bit to kind of what drove the creation of Alephium. A little bit like the founder Chang, he wasn't super happy with the direction that Ethereum was taking when it came to the, to the sharding roadmap and he first focused into, you know, proposing a better scalability solution. But it was also around 2017 with the advent of Defi and he realized that with most of the industry going in the direction of account based proof of stake kind of realm technology family, there was a big gap and not really an alternative to this. And this is kind of what he wanted to to bring with all FM a true alternative, resilient and sustainable infrastructure for decentralized application, smart contracts and asset and tokens. And we've made the choice of building a little bit on the counter of what the industry trend what at the time. So we are in the big family of UTXO and proof of work but we have really three big innovation.
00:05:12.863 - 00:06:03.013, Speaker B: On the scalability side we are a sharded chain but because we do this on the UTXO model, we can do it In a much more user experience friendly. So no matter how and where you're transacting on all fm, it's always on a single step, always on chain. You never have to do cross chain transaction which is a great increase in user experience when it comes to sharded network. And that allows us to natively scale up to 10,000 tps on the layer one while actually being a proof of work chain. And that kind of takes me to one of the other innovation which is called proof of less work. So we do believe in proof of work being the more robust consensus when it is when you want to ensure decentralization. But the founder really wanted to see can we optimize it, can we make it more energy efficient? And that's basically what proof of less work is.
00:06:03.013 - 00:06:31.825, Speaker B: It reduces the energy consumption of the network by 87% at large scale without reducing security by using kind of to be. To be brief. Basically we are classic proof of work up until a certain point and past that point it's kind of a mix of proof of work and proof of burn. So of physical and digital security. So you have to burn coin upfront in addition to providing computing power to be able to mine a new block.
00:06:32.165 - 00:06:37.031, Speaker A: Interesting. I like that spin on proof of proof of work. Proof of less work.
00:06:37.063 - 00:07:12.045, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. We actually have I think one of our biggest. So those are kind of the one people understand quickly. I feel like the biggest one is also our development environment. So we have a model called the stateful UTXO which means we or smart contract have state they are fully programmable. So you have kind of the flexibility and expressivity of smart contracts that people are used to on the account model. But you retain the security for asset of the UTXO model so it's faster easier to write secure smart contract.
00:07:12.045 - 00:07:48.235, Speaker B: We completely eliminate a lot of the attack vector that plague defi specifically but also other area for example re entrance attack are not possible on LFM by design. We also made it that flash loan are not possible even though they are not necessarily malicious but they haven't always been used for good. Also resolve kind of this pre approval mechanism as well. So that's the part I'm the most excited about because I think people really underestimate how challenging it still is for even experienced user to navigate the space safely. Whether you're a user or a developer.
00:07:48.695 - 00:07:56.271, Speaker A: In terms of ecosystem growth, what areas or sectors within alithium are seeing the most activity and engagement?
00:07:56.423 - 00:08:32.359, Speaker B: I want to say defi right now I feel it's a little bit natural because also if you look in the space defi and kind of anything linked to finance to some extent is where you see the most lasting adoption. So this was kind of the first primitive that you kind of see developed into the ecosystem. So this is also true for us. We're also seeing a little bit of gaming, obviously. Nft, a little bit of. I don't know what is the right way to describe this, like a few small defi game gambling games, Launchpad of course. So we have a little bit of everything.
00:08:32.359 - 00:08:37.271, Speaker B: But I would say defi would be the primary what came first.
00:08:37.423 - 00:08:46.755, Speaker A: Interesting, interesting. How does leafing position itself within the defi space and what makes it particularly suited for defi applications?
00:08:47.335 - 00:09:24.339, Speaker B: I want to say security. There's two things security, but also the ease to get that security. So again, the UTXO model inherently brings a lot of security when it comes to asset management. Because tokens in our case, and it's the case for most UTXO chain that supports token tokens are first class citizen, which means they act. It sounds weird because we're in a digital world, but they actually exist on chain. They are not a field into a smart contract. So once a token, even if it's been issued by a smart contract is in your wallet, even if the smart contract disappears, the assets stays there because they are what you call first class citizen.
00:09:24.339 - 00:09:59.385, Speaker B: It also makes it a lot easier to develop because at the protocol level all assets are treated equally, whether it is the native coin, if you do the full name or any token that has been issued. Again, we talked about this before reentrancy attack like kind of this very cumbersome pre approval st that you have an EVM chain where you have to pre approve often a limited amount to interact with a smart contract. We completely got rid of that to really facilitate the experience of both developers and users.
00:09:59.725 - 00:10:07.565, Speaker A: Looking back, can you share the history of Defi on Alephium and how has the platform evolved over time? What milestones have been achieved?
00:10:07.645 - 00:10:57.797, Speaker B: Yeah, so Alephium supported smart contract from day one, from the first day of mail at launch. But obviously the environment around this wasn't as developed as it was today. So a first big chunk of work was really working on the SDK, which makes it a lot easier for builders to come and interact with the chain. We've made a lot of improvement as well to the virtual machine and that kind of culminated into a first network upgrade that we had in March 2023. And actually after that, the beginning of the LFOM ecosystem came the first DApp actually launched was a DEX in summer 2023 and from then, from there it was kind of a snowball effect. We obviously had NFT Marketplace, Launchpad, so many honestly it's difficult to keep track of everything. Now we are having like three, four more decks, two more NFT Marketplace, but that was the beginning.
00:10:57.797 - 00:11:48.655, Speaker B: One other key milestone was when we released a bridge. So we made a bridge from Alephium to Ethereum and from Ethereum to Alephium and that allowed us to bring some of the major stablecoin into our ecosystem pretty early on. So usdt, usdc, basically any asset that lives on Ethereum can be bridged over to Alephium and vice versa. And that really helped boost the current ecosystem and that was really the start in a very big growth of our TVL because we right now have the second largest TVL of all proof of work chain after Bitcoin, which is pretty nice. And our bridge actually itself is not doing too bad. I think we're the 30th largest bridge in TVL even though it's a bridge just to Alephium. So it's pretty nice.
00:11:48.655 - 00:12:54.785, Speaker B: We had also a first hackathon in February where we had over 100 people participate project really coming from a lot of different ecosystem and really kind of demonstrating and confirming to us that it was actually pretty easy to pick up the all FM tech even though we have our own smart contract language or own VR virtual machine. But it's been designed to be easy to be learned by someone new and the hackathon really help us confirm that. And the hackathon actually tripled the number of projects that existed at lfium at the time and from then again it continued to really grow. One other key milestone was the arrival of Oracle. We are a non EVM chain so getting a lot of those services onto LFM are a little bit more challenging. But we have the first Oracle that was launched I think around a month ago and that will really kind of fit into a second wave for our ecosystem. Like obviously especially in Defi, the classic like lending over collateralized stablecoin, Perpetual Dex and obviously many, many others as well.
00:12:55.565 - 00:13:05.065, Speaker A: Fantastic. With Defi continuing to grow, what are some of the upcoming projects and developments in Alpha's ecosystem that you're most excited about?
00:13:06.165 - 00:14:00.585, Speaker B: I mean honestly there are so many things I think one of their an over collateralized stablecoin with lending kind of similar to Maker Dao but with also some of its own, its own trick that is coming that people are very looking forward to. We also had like some pretty interesting like peer to peer protocol leveraging the UTXO model to really have trustless peer to peer protocol when it comes either to classic OTC transaction but also peer to peer lending. There's a few RWA project coming as well. Some of them linked to mining that I think a lot of people are looking forward to. We are actually going to expand or bridge to other chain. So with this will come some stable swap related development and primitive as well. So yeah, that's a lot of things.
00:14:00.665 - 00:14:12.961, Speaker A: We'Ve heard about ASICS being used in the Alephium ecosystem. Can you describe to our audience what ASICS is and also following that up, why they're important to Alephium's ecosystem?
00:14:13.033 - 00:15:10.167, Speaker B: Yeah, so Alephium being a proof of work chain mean that new blocks are being valid like are being mined and validated by proposed by miners. And so usually a chain starts to be GPU compatible. So pretty much everyone on their computer has a GPU and to some extent can contribute to a network and mine to a network. And usually if you are ASIC friendly, the history of evolution is like you'll have GPU which is multipurpose hardware that you can use for many things, but you can use it to mine. And this is nonspecific, you can mine pretty much any coin that is GPU mining. So you could mine Alephium very long time ago, you could mine Bitcoin and you can use it for many different things. Then you have a first step of specialization like FPGA that are programmable, a little bit more specialized and then you have the more the highly specialized chip which are asics.
00:15:10.167 - 00:16:00.309, Speaker B: So this is hardware that is very specifically and optimized to mine a specific mining algorithm. And in our case we use Blake 3 so dedicated ASIC had to be built for all Fion and so it's important for different things. ASICs are usually extremely powerful. So it help increase the hash rate of your network and therefore to some extent increase the security because the higher the hash rate, the more computing power you need to potentially do a 51 attack or things like this. It's also because it's specialized hardware, it makes the miner more faithful to your chain because they are investing into a hardware that is specific to your chain. It's not like they can unplug it and plug it somewhere else. So it gives you a little bit more sustainability into your, into your hash rate basically.
00:16:00.309 - 00:16:48.539, Speaker B: And I think the last point is also it's an extremely strong show of faith from the mining industry because Developing a specific ASICS takes a lot of time and resources from the manufacturer perspective. So they usually do this if they believe in the ecosystem and they believe this is going to be profitable for them. And so we had Bitmain, which is the largest ASIC manufacturer that announced their Asics and now they are plugged on chain. Now this summer we also had actually Gold Shell, they do home miners. So smaller miners that people can run at home was the first one to release in April. We also have Ice river that also launched their Asics and there are a number of other ones also coming as well. So it's very interesting.
00:16:48.667 - 00:16:57.691, Speaker A: Yeah, sounds like it. Excited to learn more about ASICS and how can someone get involved in ASIC mining on the platform?
00:16:57.763 - 00:17:36.407, Speaker B: Actually so ASIC mining is a little bit. So again there's kind of two types. You have ASIC miner that are what you call home miners. So you can plug them on normal electricity circuits and they are very powerful. Usually they are more accessible when it comes to pricing and you can plug them at home but usually they come into a network that also has, I call them industrial ASICs. I don't know if it is the actual right term, but we're talking about ASICS that you can't plug on a plug at home. You need like proper much higher, like bigger plugs basically that you have to.
00:17:36.431 - 00:17:38.127, Speaker A: Plug them industrial level or something.
00:17:38.191 - 00:18:22.445, Speaker B: Yeah, infrastructure, it's also extremely loud, like the cooling fan are extremely loud. So it's not really something you can plug at home. Usually a lot more powerful. And this is like professional mining, like it's a whole business to try and find the cheapest electricity, more stable place to plug them. So it's actually a whole industry, which is fascinating by the way, but it's a whole other topic. But to make so home miner accessible to all. But in terms of power and percentage of hash rate in network, it's much lower than the industrial one that you require a little bit of specialized knowledge but you have intermediary firm that can help, that can help you once you have your miner plug it in the right place, in the right farm.
00:18:22.445 - 00:18:47.575, Speaker B: And also one of the project that I was talking about RWA is actually a tokenization of mining of miners or mining farms so that people who don't want to buy a miner but still want to be part of the of the mining infrastructure can kind of buy a token that would be a tokenized portion of a mining farm and earn obviously a portion of the of the coin that are being mined as well.
00:18:47.695 - 00:18:53.315, Speaker A: Interesting. Doesn't it make it difficult for people to participate in the network if it's like highly specialized and expensive.
00:18:53.745 - 00:19:34.227, Speaker B: I mean so the industrial one definitely are more on the more on the expensive side. The home miner honestly are similar to the price of a powerful gpu. Obviously the hash rate of the network it's quite high. So you have to look the main factor in the mining industry is always the cost of electricity. So it really depends if you're in a country where the cost of electricity is extremely high. Definitely if the cost of electricity is not that high where you are, a home miner will be pretty good for you anyway. And again in a country where the electricity is pretty high, industrial miner is complicated but this is why we're looking at because we have native defi.
00:19:34.227 - 00:20:04.257, Speaker B: On Alephia we're kind of making this bridge between defi and mining to really add more opportunities, both from the user perspective to participate into the mining side, but also for miners to participate into the ecosystem. Because again in the proof of work side you don't really have that much smart contract enabled chain. So all of the defi and additional yield usually happen on another chain. Whereas on Alephium this is something that you can do natively and hopefully have a more virtuous cycle between the different participants of the ecosystem.
00:20:04.361 - 00:20:10.961, Speaker A: Can you share some any top level metrics for the platform like daily active users TVL?
00:20:11.113 - 00:20:56.841, Speaker B: Of course. So our TVL increased by 2000% actually since the beginning of the year. We have the second largest TVL of all proof of work chain after Bitcoin. We have over 200,000 active addresses in our native wallets. We have I think around 75,000 download between the desktop wallet, mobile wallet, extension wallet and that doesn't count obviously exchange wallet, third party wallet and node wallet as well that people are using. I'm trying to think of another really nice metrics to tell you but we also have a pretty big increase on the number of projects really that are deploying on chain every time as time pass.
00:20:56.993 - 00:21:02.121, Speaker A: What is the long term vision for Alephium and where do you see the platform heading in the coming years?
00:21:02.233 - 00:22:00.725, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean a first step for us, I know it's not the long term but as we the middle term is really to bring a lot of services like hardware wallet, fiat on ramp. That's what we are working on right now to really bring the foundation but honestly we really want to drive innovation in this area of the industry. We want to see also more defi but generally speaking decentralized application leveraging the UTXO model because today that hasn't been done much or at least not in a way that was convenient enough to be fully explored. And I think in terms of security, but also from user experience, there's a lot of things that can be leveraged. You can really have trustless atomic swap between multiple users, multiple assets and you can really use this to enhance your user experience but also build completely new products. I'm quite excited to see this coming. Hopefully we will have contributed to that and I really hope that LFM can be one of those chain that really pushed the industry forward by providing different solution than what you see.
00:22:00.725 - 00:22:29.207, Speaker B: I think this is one of our biggest value in an industry where you see a lot of chain that are very, very similar and where the value proposition is mainly into, you know, the amount of funding they are able to dedicate into their ecosystem but they don't bring much innovation into the space. It's nice or they are all innovating in the same direction. All Appium really stands out on that front and I hope that, you know, we, we kickstart something and continue to push this forward.
00:22:29.391 - 00:22:40.493, Speaker A: Astampath for those who are new to Alephium, what's the best way for users to get started on the platform? Are there specific resources, tools or guidelines to help them explore?
00:22:40.589 - 00:23:28.263, Speaker B: So I mean obviously as many projects, the website is a good place to start for you to get kind of a wallet. My favorite ones are the desktop and the mobile wallet but we also have extension wallet and again very soon, as in very, very soon we'll have over. We'll have actually five hardware wallet that will support Alephion. So that's also an option for you. I think we have a page called Elfland that kind of summarizes all of the DAPP services that are available on all fm. So it's a good place once you have your wallet to kind of explore a little bit what you can do if you are a little bit more technical and you want to dive in. I think our docs which you can access from the website are also quite interesting because if you're a bit technical I think code doesn't lie and that's always where you can see what a project is made of.
00:23:28.263 - 00:23:34.115, Speaker B: So everything is open source on Allfion so we welcome feedback contribution as well.
00:23:34.655 - 00:23:39.503, Speaker A: And can you share which five hardware wallets they will be?
00:23:39.599 - 00:24:03.443, Speaker B: I mean I can say ledger because that one has been like we've applied. The review process has gone very well and hopefully we should be able to go to the next step very soon. And then the other one, not really yet, but they are some of the. At least out of the four others. A lot of them are kind of the main one that people usually are looking for.
00:24:03.619 - 00:24:15.415, Speaker A: Perfect. And finally, is there anything else you'd like to share about Lithium's journey vision that we haven't covered in this conversation? Any final words you'd like to share?
00:24:15.955 - 00:24:53.155, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, again, I want to say a big thank you to the Allfium community, because I think at the end of the day, we are building for people and the people that came to the Alephium ecosystem are already actively contributing to how we evolve the protocol. We really took a step by step approach and we really rely on user feedback to continue the development of the chain. So it's very important for us to hear how people are using our chain and how they want it to grow and that we're just getting started and that there's a lot more amazing things to come on Alaphia.
00:24:53.325 - 00:25:00.799, Speaker A: Fantastic. Well, we're looking forward to Alithium's journey and it was great to chat with you. Thank you so much for making the time.
00:25:00.847 - 00:25:02.535, Speaker B: Of course. Thank you so much for having me.
00:25:02.655 - 00:25:03.055, Speaker A: Absolutely.
