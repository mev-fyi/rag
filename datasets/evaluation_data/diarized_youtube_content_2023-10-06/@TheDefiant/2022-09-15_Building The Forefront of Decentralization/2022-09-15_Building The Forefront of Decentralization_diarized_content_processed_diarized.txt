00:00:04.490 - 00:00:06.574, Speaker A: This week on the defiant podcast, we.
00:00:06.612 - 00:00:09.406, Speaker B: Speak with Robert Lauko, founder and head.
00:00:09.428 - 00:00:12.026, Speaker A: Of research at Liquidy, a DeFi lending.
00:00:12.058 - 00:00:15.354, Speaker B: Protocol and the issuer of the LUSD stablecoin.
00:00:15.482 - 00:00:44.698, Speaker A: Following the fallout from CFI services such as Voyager, Blockfi and Celsius, we were once again reminded of the core values of decentralization, which liquidy tries to apply to the fullest. Lusd is backed only by ETH. They are governance free and have no centralized front end. Before we get into the building blocks and the trade offs of their configuration, let's hear an introduction to liquidy from Robert himself. Robert, it's so great to have you on the defiant podcast. Welcome.
00:00:44.784 - 00:01:12.770, Speaker C: Hi, Camila. Thank you for having me. Hi, everybody. Let me just explain liquidy in a nutshell, it's basically a borrowing protocol that issues its own stablecoin to borrowers. And as you already mentioned, borrowing is only possible against ether used as collateral. So you deposit ether and then you can borrow up to around 90% of your ether's value. So that's already one of the benefits that you can borrow up to this 90 91% of your ether value.
00:01:12.770 - 00:01:57.034, Speaker C: So it's very capital efficient. And this is thanks to the way that liquidates positions or borrowers that are underwater because you need to maintain this 110% collateral ratio. When you drop below that, there is a very specific procedure that I can maybe tell a few words later about. But this kind of stability pool mechanism allows the system to liquidate those positions very quickly or instantaneously. And then as a consequence, it makes it possible to offer that much value for your collateral. So that's one benefit. And the other big benefit is that the loans are interest free, which means that you only pay a small upfront fee at the beginning.
00:01:57.034 - 00:02:22.906, Speaker C: When you take out your loan, it's usually 0.5%. It can go up in certain situations, but most of the time it's only that 0.5%. So you basically pay that, or it works that it would be added to your debt. So when you pay back, you would pay back this extra debt corresponding to the fee. So that's it in a nutshell. Yeah. There are a few other properties that you already highlighted like that.
00:02:22.906 - 00:02:29.878, Speaker C: It's completely immutable, governance free and decentralized. We are not even running a front end and so on.
00:02:29.984 - 00:03:00.566, Speaker A: That's super interesting to kind of go back to some of the points you said. I would love to understand how you can offer ETH backed loans at almost 0%. So I guess the lending fee there would be that initial 0.5%, which is way lower than you would have to pay for loans almost anywhere else. So how are you able to do this?
00:03:00.668 - 00:03:58.706, Speaker C: Yeah, the short answer is that we are like a central bank, or the protocol itself can mint its own currency, the LUSD, which is obviously a US dollar packed stablecoin. And by doing so, it doesn't need to pay interest on its own or on the money it gives out as a loan, because it can print its own money to give to the borrowers. So that's the short answer. Now, of course, just minting a stable coin doesn't ensure that this token is really a stable coin. It needs to have some mechanism that keeps it closely packed to the dollar. And that's where we also took some, let's say, decisions that are a bit different from other protocols or competitors. We are not regulating the monetary supply through interest or variable rates, but we have something we call a redemption, which is a bit different from just basically getting back your collateral when repaying your loan.
00:03:58.706 - 00:05:12.410, Speaker C: That's not what we mean when I say redemption, but what I mean is that any holder of LUSD, like, no matter whether you just bought it on the market or borrowed it yourself, can exchange it at face value for ether. It means that, let's say you own 100 LUSD and you can now exchange it or redeem it for $100 worth of ether. And through this mechanism, we can ensure that there is always, like, a minimum value or a hard price floor that guarantees that whenever the LUSD would fall below, it would bounce back through this arbitrage mechanism. So this is the trick. And thanks to the redemption mechanism, and also thanks to this very efficient and liquidation mechanism, we have a band basically, between one dollars and one pen, between which the price can move, even though there are forces that keep it closer to $1. But these mechanisms are really independent of interest rates, so that's why we can. There is no need for interest in our system.
00:05:12.580 - 00:06:15.778, Speaker A: Okay. In order to maintain that peg, you do it by ensuring that users can always redeem LUsd for e at a value, that means that LUSD is equal to one dollars. What are some of the risks that you see could kind of throw this mechanism off? Is there anything that could make this system spiral like a black flan event? Is there any kind of run on the bank situation where multiple borrowers try to redeem at the same time? And maybe that would throw LUSd off? Its like, I don't know, what are some of the edge case scenarios that could happen with this model?
00:06:15.944 - 00:07:33.386, Speaker C: Yeah, so that's a good question. And speaking of the redemption mechanism, I think there are no extra risks in that regard. But there are a few kind of maybe inconveniences or surprises attached to the redemption mechanism, because what really happens when somebody redeems 1000 LUSD, for example, is that the system would use this amount to repay the riskiest position, like the riskiest borrower with the lowest collateralization ratio would basically see his or her debt being repaid, and in return, the system gives an equivalent amount of his or her ether to the redeemer. So it basically means that somebody else just repaid your loan. You may like it or not, in certain situations, you could even be happy about it, because it may save you from a liquidation, because you are already at the bottom end of the scale if you sort all the borrowers by collateral ratio. But it can also be an inconvenience or just something that may not be as usual as in other systems. But what's maybe even more important for the system safety is that it always tries to remain over collateralized by a healthy margin.
00:07:33.386 - 00:08:36.638, Speaker C: And it's not only this 110% which I mentioned, that an individual borrower can, in theory, take out a loan of up to 90% of the collateral, but as a whole or in aggregate, the system keeps or maintains a minimum collateralization ratio of 150% as to have, like, this safe margin or buffer. It does so by having a certain mode called the recovery mode, which would kick in when the system's total or aggregate collateralization falls below this threshold. But yeah, overall, this would lead to kind of disincentives for people to be too risky, and thereby the whole user base would hopefully behave in a way that the system remains always fully, and not just fully, but over collateralized by this margin, so that all the redemption requests can be fulfilled. And nobody would have to fear that the LUSD suddenly loses the backing.
00:08:36.734 - 00:09:20.046, Speaker A: What about the fact that it's 100% backed by ETH? It's obviously extremely subject to ETH volatility. So what if ethereum falls extremely quickly and liquidates a lot of positions on liquidity. I guess you've already seen that somewhat tested in these past few weeks and months, but I don't know if we've seen kind of an extremely sharp drop that would really put a stress in the system. What are some of the safeguards for when that happens?
00:09:20.148 - 00:09:30.978, Speaker C: Yeah, so we have seen a few events now for the first one and a half years of operation, one was even one month into our operation, so to say.
00:09:31.064 - 00:09:32.434, Speaker A: When did you go on main net.
00:09:32.472 - 00:10:22.834, Speaker C: Sorry, that was on April 5, 2021, and sometime in May, I forgot, maybe 18th. There was like a black day where there was this flash crash, really out of the blue. So it wasn't clear why it really happened, but there were, I think, around 300 positions. Like a third of the whole user base or borrower base was liquidated basically within a few minutes. And this proved the efficiency, or like, it was a real stress test for the liquidation mechanism, which mainly works through the stability pool. I can maybe go a bit into detail into that later, but, yeah, this mechanism proved to work, and it also later became very important. For example, a few months ago, where it was.
00:10:22.834 - 00:11:48.266, Speaker C: Think again, like, sometime in May or June when after, like, it was the aftermath of the terra collapse, when there were a few big positions, like a huge position of 77 ether, which was maybe worth $100 million back then in our system. And this was the largest position ever liquidated in liquidity, and one of the largest position in Defi as a whole to be liquidated. And this cost. I mean, the liquidation itself went fine, but what happened afterwards was a bit less, maybe harder to digest for the liquidity system because it basically left behind a hole in the stability pool. So it sucked up, like, more than half or even two thirds of the LUSD that were in this pool. So it emptied it. And then what really happened is that as a consequence, now that the pool was empty, but the system was still paying out nice rewards in LQTY, which is our secondary token to the stability depositors, now the rewards per or parata kind of incentive went up, and that motivated more people of the already smaller LUSD supply, because those tokens, they were burned, they were burnt in lieu of the borrower.
00:11:48.266 - 00:12:38.970, Speaker C: So now other holders of LUSD, they are rushed to deposit their LUSD to the stability pool, which was very attractive due to the high yield, and which in return led to an upward pressure on the LUSD. So the peg was broken a bit, like, it went up to one 4103. It now kind of stabilized again a bit, but it's still, like, suffering somewhat from a demand shortage. Like people are not now borrowing as much as they used to be. That's for several reasons. And at the same time, the stability pool is paying out a comparably high reward to the LUSD depositors, which means that there is kind of a excessive demand for holding and depositing LUSD.
00:12:39.050 - 00:13:02.646, Speaker A: I see. Okay, interesting. Can you explain a bit more? Just to understand this whole dynamics better, we need to understand how exactly the stability pool works. And you said earlier, this is kind of a key difference in how the liquidity protocol itself works.
00:13:02.748 - 00:13:54.358, Speaker C: Yes. So it's basically an insurance pool or an insurance fund, which permissionlessly allows anybody, any holder of LUSD, to deposit tokens like LUSD. And what it does when somebody's position or borrower needs to be liquidated is that it simply burns the amount needed. Like, if there was a debt of a million LUSD, then it would just take out the million LUSD from the pool and burn it. It would do this prorata. So if the pool is much larger, everybody would just lose a small portion of their LUSD deposit, and in return, it gives the collateral, which is ether, which was held by the borrower who got liquidated to the pool. Or again, prorata, it would go to all the depositors in total.
00:13:54.358 - 00:14:49.046, Speaker C: And given the fact that the liquidation happens just slightly below 110%, it usually means that there is a 9% or at least 8% net gain for the stability depositors from each liquidation. So when this huge liquidation happened, like the 77K position, there was like a few hundred k liquidation gain that was paid out at once in one day, or even with that transaction, which led to. What is the word? Yeah, so a windfall for all the depositors. So that's it. And then there is this extra other incentive mechanism, which is a continuous payout of LQTY tokens to the pool depositors. It's more like a liquidity mining incentive. It goes down over time.
00:14:49.046 - 00:14:58.890, Speaker C: Like, there is a holding schedule. A bit similar to bitcoin, though. It's more smooth. Yeah. So those are the two incentives why you would become a stability pool depositor in the first place.
00:14:59.040 - 00:15:33.350, Speaker A: So you have this one side of the protocol where borrowers can deposit ETH and take out a loan in LUSD in return, and they can borrow 90% of their value in ETH. In LUSd as a whole, this entire system is meant to be collateralized by 110% of ETH versus LUSD. Right.
00:15:33.500 - 00:15:41.002, Speaker C: It's 150% in total, even though the individual positions can be as low as 110, 150.
00:15:41.136 - 00:16:23.314, Speaker A: Okay. And then separately, there is this stability pool, which is a pool of LUSD deposits, and that is meant to secure the ETH backed loans on the other side of the system so that when the collateral ratio drops below 110, the 110 minimum, and loans are liquidated, then that LUSD in the stability pool is used to buy the ETH that was liquidated.
00:16:23.442 - 00:16:27.218, Speaker C: Exactly. And it buys it at a discount of around 9%.
00:16:27.404 - 00:16:40.454, Speaker A: Okay, so it buys that ETH that was liquidated and then it buys that ETH, and that ETH that it bought is distributed among the depositors of the stability pool.
00:16:40.502 - 00:16:41.274, Speaker C: Yes, exactly.
00:16:41.392 - 00:16:52.902, Speaker A: Okay, got it. And on top of ETH liquidations from the system stability pool, depositors also get these liquidity incentives in LQTY tokens.
00:16:52.986 - 00:16:55.854, Speaker C: That's right. Yes, that's an additional incentive.
00:16:55.982 - 00:17:17.270, Speaker A: And so this stability pool, this insurance fund to you, I guess that's the key to how you're able to kind of keep the system going and offer these near 0% loans.
00:17:17.870 - 00:17:59.014, Speaker C: In particular, the low minimum collateral ratio of 110% is made possible through the fact that the stability pool is very fast. It's almost instantaneous. It's as fast as you can send an ethereum transaction, whereas on other systems there is a lengthy auction mechanism which can take a few hours or at least several minutes, during which time frame the ether price can drop further. So in our case, there is no such risk because as fast as you can liquidate, the lower the risk of a further price drop that you need to account for.

00:18:51.266 - 00:18:57.250, Speaker B: What makes liquidy a unique lending protocol is that depositors earn interest from liquidations.
00:18:57.330 - 00:19:11.286, Speaker A: As opposed to from borrowing rates that we usually see in other protocols such as maker or compound. What sort of incentive mechanisms does liquidity have to maintain this model? Do lenders receive anything upfront?
00:19:11.398 - 00:19:58.438, Speaker C: Well, indirectly they get a portion of the borrow fee. I mean, I mentioned this upfront fee of 0.5%. Now this fee goes to the stakers of the LQTY token. This other token, when it gets staked, it is entitled to receive a portion of the fee revenue. I mean, the entire fee revenue is just distributed among all the LQTY stakers. And now through this extra liquidity incentive mechanism that gives or pays out LQTY rewards to the stability depositors, those depositors would indirectly also benefit from the fee revenue, because the LQTY token will kind of represent the net present value, so to say, of the future fee revenue.
00:19:58.534 - 00:20:08.634, Speaker A: That brings me to a question of the purpose of the LQTY token, other than serving as a liquidity incentive for depositors.
00:20:08.762 - 00:21:03.890, Speaker C: Yeah. So the other incentive mechanism which we have in our system is targeted towards the front end operators. So the front end, they can basically decide which fraction or like which portion of this reward that usually goes to the stability depositors. They want to split off and keep themselves. We call this a kickback mechanism. So basically they say, what is kicked back to the end user like the stability depositor, and what remains? What portion remains with the front end? And that mechanism was intended, and it's still the case to incentivize a multitude of front end operators, because we wanted to start launch liquidity in a very decentralized fashion, where we have at least two, dozens of front ends ready. From the start, it worked out pretty well.
00:21:03.890 - 00:21:28.154, Speaker C: So at least quantitatively speaking, we had a nice number of front ends, and they got some rewards, but it turned out to be a bit like a race to the bottom. So now we have many or a few front ends offering like 100% kickback, which means that they are altruistic, or at least they are not reliant on this incentive to keep a portion of it for themselves.
00:21:28.272 - 00:21:50.554, Speaker A: That's interesting. I definitely want to get more into the decentralized front end aspect of liquidity, but before we do, I'd love to just take a step back and learn more about you. What's your background? What got you into crypto and what led you to start liquidity?
00:21:50.602 - 00:23:05.058, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'm actually a lawyer by training, and I used to work as a lawyer quite a few years in several jobs. So I was a law clerk and a legal counsel. I didn't do kind of litigation in court, but I always also had a very keen interest related to everything tech and more specifically computer science. I coded in my youth, I did some student projects, and when I first heard about bitcoin, and I forgot exactly when it was, I was fascinated, but it wasn't enough to keep me really fascinated. But then a few years later, I read in the news, and I live in Switzerland, in a crypto valley, so to say, because that's where I grew up, in the canton of Zuk, which then became in 2000 and I think 15 and 16, the crypto Valley. And that's like around the time when I read in the news about Vitalik, Buterin founding Ethereum in my hometown, so to say. And that's when really things kicked off and I started delving really deep into everything related to blockchain.
00:23:05.058 - 00:23:50.174, Speaker C: I went to meetups, I wrote articles like small forum posts and blog posts. And eventually I was lucky enough to get in touch with a project called Definity. I mean, they are now better known under the name Internet computer. And yeah, I became one of the first researchers and first employee in Switzerland. I did many things there. I also had a chance to work really deeply on their consensus algorithm, but I also did some operations, community management and so on. And after more than two years working there, I kind of started looking into the fledgling DeFi ecosystem, which was unfolding in the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:23:50.174 - 00:24:25.566, Speaker C: I mean, definity didn't launch at that time, and I also had this kind of task to analyze them and see what kind of applications you can build on top of a scalable blockchain infrastructure. And then more and more I got interested in. It was compound and maker back then, more or less. And when reading up on them, I had my own ideas how maybe I could make them more efficient and just more predictable as well. And that's how everything started. I eventually left definity to start my own project, liquidity.
00:24:25.678 - 00:24:40.614, Speaker A: Very cool. So compared to compound maker Ave, what would you say are the main differences or even improvements that you're going for?
00:24:40.812 - 00:26:05.380, Speaker C: Yeah, it all started with this idea of making liquidations more efficient, more rapid, so that we can lower the minimum collateralization and make the whole borrowing experience better and more efficient. And then when I started looking into the whole question of governance and what parts you want to be able to change and what should be governed by an algorithm, I realized that in some sense, there is no need for a governance, at least not for the parameters that can be defined by an algorithm which measures some variables or some of the activity of its users, and it can react to it accordingly. And then going further, we also realized as a team that we really want to push this decentralization as far as we can, which implied that we would only go for one collateral, which is ether, which also meant that we wouldn't need a governance to basically decide about adding other collateral assets. If ether is the only asset, there is nothing to reason about in that respect. And I think the last piece that came a bit later was this decentralized front end approach, which complemented it. And those are the main aspects. And of course, the interest freeness is one as well.
00:26:05.380 - 00:26:27.474, Speaker C: It's a really nice kind of value proposition. It has a few trade offs because it's not as easy to establish as maybe other properties that we wanted. But still, I think many people like it. And yeah, those are the main differences or benefits.
00:26:27.612 - 00:26:53.978, Speaker A: Okay, so faster liquidations to be able to lower the collateralization ratio, having the stablecoin be fully backed by ETH, having a decentralized front end, minimizing governance, and the close to 0% borrowing rate are kind of the main differences.
00:26:54.074 - 00:26:55.710, Speaker C: That's perfect. Summary.
00:26:56.930 - 00:27:14.582, Speaker A: Nice. Okay. I think really interesting, this decision to back Lusd only on ETH. So you mentioned this was to increase decentralization. Can you expand on that a little bit?
00:27:14.716 - 00:28:10.234, Speaker C: Yes. So maybe, first of all, it was clear that ETH would be the main, at least back then, it seemed to be the asset that most people would want to borrow against, because they just want to hold ether, which is most well known of all tokens. And it was also the only token that the single collateral version of maker offered as collateral back then, before it kind of evolved into multicolateral. Dai. So this was kind of an obvious start. Now the question was, is there something else you want to have as collateral? Having another stablecoin as collateral was not even a question, at least in the beginning. I mean, I think it was still before our launch when maker introduced USDC, but that was, for me really the red line that I would never want to cross then.
00:28:10.234 - 00:28:49.320, Speaker C: Speaking of other collateral assets, I mean, they weren't like, for example, staked ETH derivatives or like lido or whatever, weren't available back then. So that would have been an interesting discussion, at least because they could be interesting as collateral, but they aren't as decentralized as ether. Of course they have extra added risks. Those weren't available. So the only, I think, option that would have been like an interesting mainstream, like asset or collateral, would have been like some bitcoin representation, like repbitcoin. But even they have their issues. They are not decentralized or not in a way that would be acceptable for.
00:28:49.320 - 00:28:54.738, Speaker C: Yeah, we just stick to our decision of going with ease.
00:28:54.834 - 00:29:04.538, Speaker A: And when you say USDC and something like wrapped bitcoin are lines that you didn't want to cross, why is that?
00:29:04.624 - 00:30:15.838, Speaker C: It also relates to the fact that we or our own protocol is not governable and not upgradable. So if there is anything that maybe they want to change, or like, the collateral asset, let's say, changes its risk behavior. So that may lead to consequences down the line. So maybe what happens if the collateral becomes much more volatile suddenly? So maybe then we would need to change the minimum collateral ratio, but we cannot change it because it's set in stone. It's immutable. So relying on somebody else's product that is governable or that may change or may even completely disappear in the worst case or be censored could have disastrous consequences for a protocol that is immutable itself. So had we want to go down that route, I think we wouldn't be able to do that within this kind of realm of a completely decentralized protocol and completely immutable protocol.
00:30:15.934 - 00:30:53.502, Speaker A: When you say that you couldn't even consider doing something like staked ETH because they weren't even available back then, that means that right now you can't add it because your protocol is not governable. So it means, like, whatever you put out in April of last year has to be that way. Like, it can't be changed. Is that right? There's no way to change liquidity protocol from the smart contracts that were already released last year?
00:30:53.556 - 00:31:17.640, Speaker C: Yes. So it was immutable from the start. It's not unlike other systems which go down a path towards decentralization or immutability. This one started completely immutable. And that's right. I mean, it is a limitation because we cannot change it. The only thing we can do is release a second version and then have some kind of migration from the old system to the new.
00:31:17.640 - 00:31:50.174, Speaker C: But having said that, I think given that we just went for ease, we know that, or we can say we went for the safest approach. We also maximized on the oracle design by having two oracles and the fallback mechanism to make it even more secure. I think that was like, we maximized our efforts to keep the protocol in a shape that it can work for many years even though we cannot change it.
00:31:50.292 - 00:32:16.534, Speaker A: How long did you spend testing and kind of reviewing the protocol before launching it? Because I can imagine for any developer pushing something to production, it's a huge stress, and you want everything to go right, but for you, it was, like, even more important since you can't change anything.
00:32:16.652 - 00:32:56.614, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a very good point. And I think we spent around two thirds of our entire time we started, or I basically started with the idea in late 2019 and then think around early summer, like D five summer 2020. We already had our first more or less running prototype. We even had, like, a testnet version which people could play around with. And then the whole auditing process and internal testing really kicked off. So it took then almost another year until we launched in April. And that was, I mean, we did some improvements, added things here and there.
00:32:56.614 - 00:33:01.174, Speaker C: But the main logic was built in four or five months.
00:33:01.292 - 00:33:07.110, Speaker A: Are you planning to have a V two or would you do that?
00:33:07.180 - 00:33:19.078, Speaker C: That's, I think, something I wouldn't rule out for the future. It's not on our very short term roadmap. There is something else on our short term roadmap I can mention. Maybe it goes by the name chicken bond.
00:33:19.174 - 00:33:20.022, Speaker A: Chicken bond.
00:33:20.086 - 00:33:21.626, Speaker C: Chicken bond. Yes.
00:33:21.808 - 00:33:23.042, Speaker A: Oh, chicken bonds.
00:33:23.126 - 00:33:23.758, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:23.924 - 00:33:30.110, Speaker A: Okay, we'll talk about chicken bonds.
00:33:30.610 - 00:33:57.570, Speaker C: Apart from that, of course. We have already started discussing the long term future of liquidity. And we are soon going to a team retreat, which will be the first time really that we will meet as a whole team. Like now. Ten people and one of the of course, discussion points. There will be some future. Like what's the future of liquidity? Is it a version two? Is it something else? Yeah.
00:33:57.570 - 00:34:03.830, Speaker C: So I cannot say anything right now, but it's something we already have started discussing.
00:34:03.910 - 00:35:06.222, Speaker A: We'll definitely kind of come back to what's next for liquidity in a little bit. But I just want to still have a few more questions on LUSD and how it's backed by ETH. Because I think the reason why Maker started adding all these other types of collateral, as I understand it, is to allow dai to scale, right? Because otherwise dai supply, and in this case LUSD supply is always restricted by just the amount of ETH out, you know. What are your thoughts on that? I guess for you it was more important to keep LUSD as decentralized and kind of just have the safer collateral as possible than scaling it.
00:35:06.276 - 00:36:00.574, Speaker C: I mean, we definitely prioritized decentralization over scalability. So I think we were pretty open about some of the limitations that liquidity has due to being just limited to ether. I mean, we did improve upon the hard boundaries of our token because a lack of scalability can lead to a deepak situation which we have experienced a bit like now. But at least we can say that we have those two boundaries at $1 and 110. So it cannot go up to 130 or something very crazy. But even within that range, I completely understand that some people are a bit upset that they will see maybe their loan go up by one or 2% when they want to repay. We are now looking into ways of mitigating this.
00:36:00.574 - 00:36:46.442, Speaker C: I mean, there are a few things that we can do like by kind of incentivizing liquidity on curve. For example, like with chicken bonds. There will be an automated way of incentivizing liquidity in a smart way. Which can move then liquidity between the curve pool and between our own stability pool. So those are two ways that we can improve upon the situation. And another thing was that helped now a bit, was that Faye, that is kind of dissolving their treasury now. They sold a nice amount, like 16 something, millions of LUSD, which were previously locked in the Faye treasury, which also contributed to this kind of LUSD shortage.
00:36:46.442 - 00:37:47.010, Speaker C: Now that has helped to quite some extent. But yeah, I mean, there are limitations. We did our best to make the system or design it in a way that we don't artificially make it worse by kind of having the two boundaries pretty close to each other through this 110% ratio. And then also we use this stability pool mechanism, which doesn't lead to an extra, let's say buy pressure on LUSD. Whereas in auction mechanisms or other systems, when they liquidate, and there is an auctions where multiple bidders, they need to buy whatever stable coin and bid it, and then it's locked. So there can even be like an extra demand when somebody gets liquidated, which pushes the price up even further. We kind of avoid this by this stability pool mechanism that keeps the LUSD ready when it's needed.
00:37:47.160 - 00:38:26.398, Speaker A: I guess there are scalability limitations by just having ETH. And the risk for this is this deep. That happens because at times like these, LUSD supply is more restricted because people are incentivized to deposit rather than borrow. But the way you mitigate this is with the different kind of stability pool mechanisms and the different boundaries for it.
00:38:26.484 - 00:38:51.400, Speaker C: Right. So there is an inherent scalability issue. I would just say it depends on the demand for leverage on ether. And currently there is not much demand for leverage. That may change after the merge, hopefully, and as soon as divorce over. But I really hope it will also become. It will be a renewed interest, I'm sure.
00:38:51.400 - 00:39:13.040, Speaker C: But currently it's just hard to motivate people to borrow against ether. If nobody really wants to go long on ether, or indeed even increase their exposure. It's just hard. It's not our, I think, fault or anything. It's just like there is this natural cap that people are subject to.
00:39:13.410 - 00:39:53.210, Speaker A: Right. I think it's interesting, I guess, dynamic that we're seeing in the bear market. It's kind of liquidity's first bear market, right, since it launched. And I guess kind of some of the first lessons that you can take from this is that when there is just less demand to go long ETH, then that means there will be less LUSD supply that will put pressure on the peg to go above a dollar. I guess it's kind of a lesson from all this.
00:39:53.280 - 00:40:40.610, Speaker C: Exactly. And one thing I would change if I could go back, which I obviously cannot in this version at least, is that like I mentioned, this LQTY reward program, which is still ongoing and quite substantial. When you look at the APR, it's maybe around seven or 8%, which is much more than what you would get on curve or on ave or compound for a stable coin. So currently this leads to an extra pressure. And one way to change this would be to basically make it so that only borrowers who are depositors get this extra reward. So then it means that there is no buying pressure because just buying it on the market wouldn't give you the reward. You have to borrow it and then deposit in order to be eligible.
00:40:40.610 - 00:40:58.010, Speaker C: So that would be, I think, one way, or would have been one way to dampen a bit this extra pressure. But it will go down over time because the reward scheme is designed in a way that it fades away, but it will take some months until it will become much smaller.
00:40:58.090 - 00:42:02.834, Speaker A: That's so interesting. And I think it just goes in line with learnings from this fast bull market in general about how liquidity incentives work. And I think what we've seen is that they're really powerful token incentives, but the best way to use them are in exchange for more concrete actions in protocols, rather than just holding a token or just having this fleeting liquidity provisions. So yeah, it's interesting. I think a lot of projects are learning the same thing, that token incentives can work, but they have to be used in just like very specific and targeted ways.
00:42:02.952 - 00:42:25.514, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's really something that many projects have faced. I think reflexor had some similar issue when they had some early incentive program and other systems as well. So it's really hard to anticipate how people would react and how attractive some of the incentive mechanisms are and why they are attractive or why not.
00:42:25.632 - 00:42:38.606, Speaker A: It's been fascinating to see, just like how traders react to these token incentives. Accelerate your web3 journey with Apex Pro Apex Pro is leading participants with.

00:43:29.396 - 00:43:37.278, Speaker A: Projects work is deployed on public blockchains that can't be stopped or censored. This is a crucial component of decentralization.
00:43:37.454 - 00:43:40.434, Speaker B: Conversely, front ends, or the interface for.
00:43:40.472 - 00:43:45.614, Speaker A: Users most of the time are centralized. Only a handful of projects have decentralized.
00:43:45.662 - 00:43:50.018, Speaker B: Front ends, and liquidy is one of them. Why did they decide to go this route?
00:43:50.114 - 00:45:22.638, Speaker C: I think it is like a pretty straightforward decision if you look at the other decisions that we took, like just accepting ether as our only collateral, also being immutable and non governable, which puts us on the very top end of the decentralization scale. And by having this incentive mechanism to drive third party front end, I think that aligns well with our overall strategy. Of course, it also makes our lives easier from a legal perspective. So it was like this kind of direction we took was really highly praised by our lawyers. They really liked it, both the US and swiss lawyers, because it just takes away one potential risk factor as well from our company. And the cool thing is that by having those front ends, we are also making use of some marketing, like what is it called? Indirect or affiliate marketing in a way, because the front end, they have a vested interest in driving more turnover or more demand, specifically for stability deposits to our system, because they get their share based on these amounts. So yeah, we hoped for some marketing activity that we would, or a larger reach through the many front ends.
00:45:22.638 - 00:46:04.798, Speaker C: And we got it to some degree, maybe not as much as we hoped for, but some front ends, they were more active than others. And one of them was there from the start, and for some reason they just took off and became the biggest one. At least in the first few months. I think they had the lion share of like 30% of the whole turnover. Currently, maybe there are around 25 or 30 active front end. I mean, most of them are very small or not practically dead. I mean, if I can say it, I would maybe say there are five, which are the main ones, and some of them really offer extra added benefits.
00:46:04.798 - 00:46:23.606, Speaker C: Like, they are not a simple front end because we put out a launch kit which is really bare bones. Some of the front ends, they just took it. Others, they improved upon it, or did their own thing, or integrated liquid into their own existing environment, which is of course way cooler than just taking our.
00:46:23.788 - 00:46:40.780, Speaker A: Launch kit the incentive for developers to create front ends for liquidity is the LQTY incentives. But do they also get a percentage of fees or something else?
00:46:41.790 - 00:47:19.002, Speaker C: No, it's only the LQTY reward. I mean, they can set the percentage they want. They can split off the fraction from the LQTY reward that would otherwise go to the stability depositors. And as I mentioned, this LQTVi already incorporates the future value of the fees. I mean, we are helping front ends as well if they need technical help or we are supporting them. So it's not that they would have to do all the work themselves, but in some cases, there are some technical, some technical advisory going on.
00:47:19.056 - 00:47:25.420, Speaker A: Does the fee that the user pay depend on the front end that they use?
00:47:26.750 - 00:47:29.546, Speaker C: Whether user pays a fee to the front end?
00:47:29.728 - 00:47:43.794, Speaker A: No. Okay, so each front end decides how much of the fee they're keeping. Oh, I guess it doesn't really matter for the user, they just pay 0.5% and it doesn't matter.
00:47:43.912 - 00:48:30.222, Speaker C: So for the borrower it doesn't matter because the borrowing activity is completely unrelated to the fee and unrelated, sorry, to this kickback mechanism. So the front ends, they only get their share from the LQTVi reward stream, which is only based on the stability deposits. So it's only the stability depositors, they would want to choose between front end. So sometimes they just select the front end with the highest kickback rate, which nowadays is 100%, whereas others may be fine with the lower or kickback rate of like say 95%, because they benefit from other extras that the front end may offer.
00:48:30.356 - 00:48:46.558, Speaker A: So stability depositors have to pick which front end they deposit with. Okay, and what's the incentive? Why wouldn't all the front ends just choose to keep 100% of the fee?
00:48:46.654 - 00:49:04.858, Speaker C: Well, I mean, this is competition. If everybody does that, you just need one that offers 90% and 10% goes to the user. And then users, if their rational would go to this other front end, and then another front end could come and say, oh, I offer 80% and 70%.
00:49:05.024 - 00:49:09.050, Speaker A: Because the user gets a percentage back. Okay, I see.
00:49:09.120 - 00:49:29.790, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe I got it wrong. Whatever part goes to the user, we call it the kickback. And we just saw this race to the bottom. So now I think the lowest is around 90%. And a few front ends now offer 100%. So it's all now pretty close to 95 and 100%.
00:49:29.940 - 00:50:32.598, Speaker A: I think it's so interesting that you are just like delegating the front end experience to others. Because I speak with developers and founders all the time, and the user interface is such a huge part of the experience. I mean, it's everything, right? Yeah, I think it's really interesting to just focus on kind of the backstage on the smart contract in this case, and just rely on somebody else to figure out what the actual user facing experience is. Was it hard for you to do that? I'd imagine maybe you had this idea of how liquidy should be used, but you just had to kind of rely on others to make it happen.
00:50:32.684 - 00:51:47.120, Speaker C: That's a good point. So, I mean, we had this launch kit that we put out and many front ends just took it more or less as is, or with smaller design changes. But then there were some front ends that changed the UI pretty drastically and sometimes in a way that wasn't maybe as favorable to the end user. Or at least there was some case where it could lead to confusion around the functionality of redemptions because it was placed like maybe in a panel which people would mistook for repaying a loan. So things like that, of course now are not under our control, like they are done by a third party and we can maybe ask them to change it, but it's not in our ability to really enforce this. So this is also an interesting part. And there were also a few updates, like more technical updates in the middleware, because there is also like a library which facilitates a communication between the front end and the smart contract, which we updated a few times and then provided it for download and for those who run a front end.
00:51:47.120 - 00:51:50.350, Speaker C: And then some took it, others didn't.
00:51:51.010 - 00:52:03.198, Speaker A: Yeah, so it wasn't completely kind of hands off and left to other developers. You still were able to have some sort of role on how these front ends were designed.
00:52:03.374 - 00:52:11.910, Speaker C: Yeah, but it was not kind of a very deep collaboration. It's just like we do our own thing and if front ends like it, they will take it.
00:52:11.980 - 00:52:14.946, Speaker A: Otherwise they wouldn't in the roller coaster. That's crypto.
00:52:14.978 - 00:52:19.250, Speaker B: Right now, traders are looking for ways to smooth the bumpy ride.
00:52:19.330 - 00:52:22.346, Speaker A: Pot's yield wants to help with just that.
00:52:22.528 - 00:52:31.342, Speaker B: Pod's staked ETH volatility vault is designed to earn more, both when ETH price goes up and when ETH price goes down.
00:52:31.476 - 00:52:33.294, Speaker A: It's not a matter of if, but.

00:52:45.918 - 00:53:03.270, Speaker A: Cash and the addresses that interacted with it was recently sanctioned by the US Department of Treasury. This prompted other Defi protocols such as Aave and DyDX. To blacklist those addresses. Robert discusses how Defi projects can deal with censorship.
00:53:03.610 - 00:53:36.450, Speaker C: Yeah. Besides making our lives easier, it also makes it very likely that at least some of the front ends would be based in a country that's not subject to US sanctions law. I mean, we have front ends in Europe, Germany, we have front ends in the asian market, and I think even arabic language front ends and Japanese. I think even so, yeah, it's very unlikely that all of them would suddenly start censoring some addresses or users.
00:53:37.830 - 00:54:11.742, Speaker A: What do you think is kind of the way forward with this? I don't know. Is there kind of a way to make front ends something that is kind of self hosted, that doesn't have to rely on a centralized kind of server or. I don't know, what do you think this kind of design space looks like down the line?
00:54:11.876 - 00:55:15.700, Speaker C: Yeah. So what you mentioned is also interesting because what we mean, we pulled off our own mechanism to decentralize the front end, but there are other ways. I mean, there is IPFs or there is Arviv, which allows you to host or decentralize the hosting infrastructure rather than decentralize the operators of the front end. I mean, that's another approach, but I think it's similarly viable. And then there is another one which I find interesting, which is kind of how definitive the Internet computer is designed, because they are natively decentralizing the front end as well. So unlike Ethereum and I think practically every other blockchain, they're not just hosting the smart contracts, but they're hosting the JavaScript like the websites as such on their nodes. And that makes it very easy to decentralize both at the same time and it's out of the box.
00:55:15.700 - 00:55:41.706, Speaker C: So there are many ways of doing it. Obviously there is also the aspect of who is incentivized. There are costs of hosting, and you cannot just simply rely on people to behave altruistically forever. Maybe they are fans of your project, but they will switch to another one and then they just abandon your system. So you have to make sure that there are long lasting incentives in place.
00:55:41.808 - 00:56:13.298, Speaker A: I also want to talk about governance. So you've mentioned how this is very governance minimized. I don't know if there's any governance at all in liquidity. Why did you decide to build this way? And how, if you were to do like a V two, would you keep this governance free way of building?
00:56:13.464 - 00:57:20.894, Speaker C: Yes. So to your first point or question, I think one of the revelations or realizations was that for just managing the monetary policy, given the fact that we didn't have an interest. It was kind of easier for us to manage the system or control it from a monetary perspective. So we didn't need a governance to change parameters like interest rates or collateral ratios, because we only had this one collateral type. And we were pretty sure due to our analysis that how we want to set those parameters. The need for governance was less apparent than maybe in other scenarios. Even though we still created like a monetary system which runs not just a borrowing protocol, but it's kind of a stable coin which, yeah, I mean, it has a few running or parts or moving parts, and it's not as obvious maybe, to make everything completely immutable.
00:57:20.894 - 00:58:09.690, Speaker C: The only part that you can say is kind of governed is our chain link, Oracle's proxy contract, because that's what we are using. I mean, we are not governing it, but there is some form of governance of this proxy contract that comes into play. But yeah, I think it worked out quite well in the end that it's not that I would go back and change and make some parameter now governable. That's not something I would do, even though I think there are a few things that you can change and do better in a version. Two, the fact that it's not governable as such, I would try to leave it, even though, I mean, it's also like a team decision. It won't be just me. I'm sure we will discuss this in the coming months.
00:58:09.690 - 00:59:03.274, Speaker C: Like if we were to build a second version, how would it be governed? One interesting, maybe middle ground is something I used to call it, I think, as governance by competition, where it's a bit similar to what you already know from uniswap or curve now that everybody can set up and instantiate a pool and then choose parameters for the pool. So the fact that you can permissionlessly add parts to the system and parameterize it, it also allows the system to evolve. So something like this, if we can build it in that there is some way that people can experiment with it by adding components or parts that are parameterizable, that could be an interesting option.
00:59:03.392 - 00:59:07.100, Speaker A: Why are you so happy with a governance free system?
00:59:07.470 - 00:59:41.762, Speaker C: So maybe it's also why I'm so unhappy with governance or with the current state of governance. There are, I think, obvious issues with many governance systems. I mean, many of them are not even real really. Or how should I say, the DAO is not acting directly. It's just like a signaling vote. And then you have a multi sig or some admin that just should kind of do what the DAO decides, but they not always follow it. So it's not really democratic.
00:59:41.762 - 01:00:38.966, Speaker C: And even if it's like a real governance, like where the DAO can kind of vote on a hash and then on an upgrade itself, it's still like, it has so many angles that you can mess with it, like flash loan, as long as it's at least attached to token ownership. I'm pretty skeptical whether this is a good way to govern systems. Maybe there are alternative forms that there will be that are more kind of fair or sound, where it's not just like the monetary token ownership. I mean, having locked tokens like in curve is already a good step. But I think you can go even further that you say it's not just the token holders that can vote, but like the other stakeholders, like borrowers for example, based on their duration or size of their loan. And then also depositors could have a voter. If I were to design a governance system from scratch, I wouldn't just base it on token ownership.
01:00:39.078 - 01:00:52.282, Speaker A: Super interesting. Okay, I know we need to be wrapping up, so why don't I love to finally learn about these chicken bonds and what's next for liquidity.
01:00:52.426 - 01:01:29.574, Speaker C: So chicken bonds is now really on our short term roadmap. So it's practically done. So we are just going through some front end updates, but basically the contracts are done, they are complete, they are audited. In a nutshell. It's a bit hard to explain because it's pretty novel, but its aim is to acquire protocol owned liquidity. That may sound a bit similar to Olympus, but it's done completely differently under the hood. But what it really does, I hope that it works out as intended.
01:01:29.574 - 01:02:34.474, Speaker C: It would basically accumulate a bucket of LUSD tokens that it can shift between or kind of deposit either to the stability pool or to the curve pool like the LUSD three pool. And it would do so based on the current PeC situation. So you can just move tokens around in order to have like an extra stabilization layer. Because when you move tokens from curve to stability pool, you're basically selling or like you're trading against the pool. So you can influence the price the way it does. It's through a novel bonding mechanism where people can bond LUSD tokens. And bonding here is a pretty unique thing because you are principal protected, which means as long as your bond is pendings and always get your LUSD that you deposited back, so you have this protection then whenever you want, there is no any maturity period.
01:02:34.474 - 01:03:18.662, Speaker C: It's like a perpetual, you can decide to either chicken in or chicken out. That's why we have this name. Chicken out is basically the fact of getting back your principal that relates to this principal protection. But where the magic happened is the chicken in which basically means or implies a conversion. Like you give your LUSD to the system's treasury, to this pol that becomes protocol owned liquidity. In return you get another token which is a boosted token or boosted LUSD. And this boosted LUSD has very interesting properties because it has a rising price floor, a bit similar to the C token in compound or the A tokens in Ave.
01:03:18.662 - 01:03:57.334, Speaker C: It would automatically accumulate an interest or like a yield either from the stability pool or the curve pool or from both the combination. And it does it in a way that the yield is even amplified. Like you get a higher yield per token than by just simply depositing to either curve or stability pool. And that should also lead to a premium price. Like the booster token should trade higher than the original LUSD. And so people should have an interest or an incentive to become bonders because what they get back in return after a while should be worth more.
01:03:57.452 - 01:04:11.342, Speaker A: And the advantage for liquidy is that you get to use that LUSD in whatever way makes the most sense for the protocol at the time.
01:04:11.396 - 01:04:22.810, Speaker C: Right? I think it also goes by the name algorithmic market operator which can do those shifts and use it in a way where it's mostly needed.
01:04:22.980 - 01:04:34.322, Speaker A: And that boosted yield is still coming from the same place that the stability pool yield and the curve pool yield is coming from kind of the fees, right?
01:04:34.376 - 01:05:20.626, Speaker C: So it's basically the same yield, but it's amplified. The exact mechanism is a bit hard to explain now, but it has to do with the fact that you already start getting the yield from the pending bonds. Like those who have already chickened in and got their boosted tokens, they would get the yield from the pending bonds. So those are added to their own yield. So then there is more in total. And this whole kind of extra yield drives a fly view because the higher the yield amplification, the higher the extra premium. And the higher the premium, the more interesting is to bond because the higher the APR of bonding and so on.
01:05:20.626 - 01:05:27.190, Speaker C: And the more bonds, the more yield amplification we can get from the system.
01:05:27.340 - 01:05:39.994, Speaker A: Is this protocol on liquidity a way where you can push LUSD price down? Would you be able to sell LUSD to the market as well?
01:05:40.192 - 01:06:29.174, Speaker C: Yes. So it is a longer term goal. So it won't happen like within a few days, but it will start accumulating LUSD. And we hope and we will also kind of explain it and market it in a way that should be really attractive to those who are currently already stability depositors. Like if you can offer a better deal for the stability depositors to withdraw their deposits and bond the LUSD instead, then this fraction of deposits that get withdrawn and put in chicken bonds will eventually become a movable mass. The liquidity can then be put to the best place. So to say where it can push the peg down, it would move.
01:06:29.174 - 01:06:35.418, Speaker C: There would be in the long term a movement from the stability pool to curve, which is what we need right now.
01:06:35.504 - 01:06:45.840, Speaker A: The idea here is that you don't have the principal protection, and that's why you have the higher return for that, because you lose that kind of security.
01:06:46.290 - 01:07:07.650, Speaker C: So the principal protection you have as a bonder, what you lose as a bonder is the yield during the time you are bonded. So it means you're giving away, it's a bit like pool together. During the pending time of your bond, you are giving away your yield, but only your yield, your principal always remains protected.
01:07:07.730 - 01:07:23.414, Speaker A: Okay, so that's coming up right now. And then what else you're going to figure out whether you do the V two, any other kind of plans for liquidity?
01:07:23.542 - 01:08:19.914, Speaker C: I mean, we have also looked into other type of applications which are similar to monetary markets. We are not only thinking of a version two as a long term goal. There may be other directions as well where people can borrow existing tokens, for example, rather than just our own stablecoin. But what we are seeing right now is this tendency with curve and aave to kind of moving from a monetary market, a money market, or like a Dex to a stablecoin system. So it seems that many projects that started as one specific type of DeFi project are incorporating more and more functionality from other types of DeFi applications. So maybe we will do something like that. It's really open for now.
01:08:19.914 - 01:08:22.986, Speaker C: We cannot. Yeah, I mean, it's subject to discussion.
01:08:23.098 - 01:08:41.166, Speaker A: Okay. And then finally I want to just get your general view of DFI. It's super broad, but I'm interested to hear what you think the space looks like in 20 years. Like, where is decentralized finance going in the long term?
01:08:41.278 - 01:08:45.334, Speaker C: So 20 years is extremely long. I mean, I hope to, I'm looking.
01:08:45.372 - 01:08:50.102, Speaker A: At just like very big picture, where does this end?
01:08:50.156 - 01:10:18.180, Speaker C: Basically, I really would like to see more real world integration, but in a decentralized way. Like not just having one bridge that basically is the issuer of one token, but by kind of natively issuing any realord asset on the blockchain which is recognized by law in Switzerland, we have some regulation which goes in this direction which would allow to basically move a large fraction of the current GDP or the current economy to the blockchain and then allow DeFi applications to do whatever crazy there is this, I think, notion of financial completion where you can basically monetize or tokenize everything you can come up with in a way or another. I mean that could be a direction, a very radical one though. But I think it kind of relies on some form of governmental recognition or acknowledgment. Otherwise it would be very difficult. I hope that by educating the right people in the right governmental bodies, we can move them to this over time. It will be a lengthy process, I'm sure.
01:10:18.180 - 01:10:36.562, Speaker C: But yeah, I really hope that DeFi won't just remain all a closed ecosystem with very hard to people to get in or get out because that would of course limit its scalability and also its usability for John Doe or everyday users.
01:10:36.626 - 01:10:40.650, Speaker A: And then last, last question, Robert, how are you? Defiant.
01:10:42.430 - 01:11:17.446, Speaker C: I think just by putting out 5000 lines of code almost in a completely immutable way. When I told this or when I mentioned this to some people, they were saying, are you crazy? Are you completely nuts? That's, I think something that not many people have done before. I think that's defying also the ODs of like if there is a bug, there is a bug and we could be screwed. But I'm pretty confident now that we are fine. I think that was a pretty defined move.
01:11:17.548 - 01:11:45.550, Speaker A: I agree. Very cool. Robert, it's been a pleasure. Super interesting what you've built and yeah, I'm really curious to see how it goes. Curious to see whether you do put out the V two. But it's really cool to see someone just like building at the farthest end of decentralization. So thanks so much for sharing all of your insights with us.
01:11:45.620 - 01:11:52.460, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you so much for having me. It was a pleasure. Close.
