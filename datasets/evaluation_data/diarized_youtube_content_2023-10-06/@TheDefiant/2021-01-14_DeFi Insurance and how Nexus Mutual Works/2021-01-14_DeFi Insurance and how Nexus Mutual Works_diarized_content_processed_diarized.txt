00:00:02.330 - 00:01:06.446, Speaker A: As more apps and protocols launch and more money pours into DeFi, it's important that DeFi investors can mitigate the risk of losing their funds. And if you've seen all the hacks that happened last year, well, this is important. With great power comes great responsibility. Now, one of the most common financial insurance you've probably used in your everyday life is insurance. Do you drive a car without insurance? Do you own a home without insurance? If you have little ones, do you risk everything without life insurance? My point is, insurance is what protects us from the unexpected, and there's nothing more obvious to expect but the unexpected in DFI, as we've covered on this channel before. While DFI in 2020 exploded in growth, it also imploded at times from rug pulls, flash loan exploits, and smart contract bugs. And if you consider that humans code smart contracts which power DFI applications, and humans audit this code for bugs, it is in fact, humans that we rely upon to avoid failures in the code, which failures could lose millions and potentially this year, billions in funds.
00:01:06.446 - 00:01:56.450, Speaker A: So unless humans can attain perfection, which few of us can, unless we're talking about our robot overlords and AI's future, oh, let's not go there, then we can assume we'll continue to run into smart contract bugs and loopholes. It's just the way it is. With over $16 billion in funds at risk in DFI, and lots more money coming, one of the most successful DFI projects with over $150,000,000 in total value locked, and one that's been leading the quest to provide DFI insurance, is Nexus Mutual. Nexus is a people powered alternative to insurance built with smart contracts on Ethereum. Now think back to 2016 and imagine if Nexus had existed then during the famous Dow hack, which lost 3.6 million ETH, or $3.4 billion based on today's ETH price, which is near $900.
00:01:56.450 - 00:02:49.218, Speaker A: Although today I think it went past $1,000. And we've come a long way since then. And now Nexus Mutual offers a product called smart contract cover, which allows you to pay as little as 2.6% annually for protection against a smart contract bug, which guarantees a payout in ETH or Dai if a smart contract bug is ever discovered in the DFI app. Now you can buy insurance policies for payouts in ETH or Dai, and you can buy this Nexus protection for minimally 30 days or up to a year or more in length by paying the premium in ETH or NXM, their native token. Since their launch in July 2019, Nexus have grown remarkably to over 162,000 ETH in the mutual capital pool, over 13 x in just 2020, with under $75 million in active insurance coverage. What's radical about this is it's only the start of DeFi insurance.
00:02:49.218 - 00:03:50.082, Speaker A: Recently, Nexus became the first DeFi insurance team to offer protections for funds deposited in centralized finance, or CFI services like custodial crypto lending at Blockfi and Celsius. Nexus and other new players in DeFi insurance have begun extending one another smart contract insurance, which resembles reinsurance, a practice in the legacy insurance world where insurers transfer portions of their risk portfolios to other parties. Nexus has even laid out in its mission to extend coverage to legacy risk vectors like earthquake or flood insurance. The key takeaway here is you can imagine DeFi insurance will become as much a standard as driving with car insurance. And as Nexus and other new players in this DeFi insurance vertical offer more comprehensive insurance to protect against any sort of exploit or loss of funds. It enables DeFi as a whole to grow. If more know they can depend on this kind of protection against the unexpected, it's likely more will get started investing their money in such smart, contract powered DFI apps on Ethereum.
00:03:50.082 - 00:04:09.990, Speaker A: And that, ladies and gentlemen, means mass adoption of DFI is coming. You've been watching DFI 101.
