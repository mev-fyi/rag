00:00:00.330 - 00:00:34.514, Speaker A: You. An automated market maker, or AMM, is one of the most popular DFI applications today. An AMM is a decentralized asset trading pool that enables market participants to buy or sell cryptocurrencies, specifically ETH and ERC 20 tokens on Ethereum. Amms are noncustodial, meaning you never give up control of your funds, like on a sex on a kex, or whatever a centralized exchange is called these days. Thank you, Mr. Light. And they're permissionless in nature, meaning all you need is an Ethereum wallet to trade or provide liquidity to earn fees, while others trade with your tokens.
00:00:34.514 - 00:01:29.778, Speaker A: The golden child of DFI, uniswap has voted over $3 billion in total value, locked and eclipsed popular centralized exchanges in trading volume like Coinbase and Kraken for the first time ever in 2020. So what's so special about uniswap and amms like it? Well, we'll cover all that and how amms ushered in DFI trading activity that's continued to grow at a remarkable pace the last few years. Uniswap pioneered the concept of an automated market maker, or commonly called AMM, and they launched it in October 2018. The AMM in DFI flipped the idea of a decentralized exchange on its head in three ways. Firstly, an AMm makes it easy and user friendly for anyone to provide liquidity for new ERC 20 tokens paired with ETH. The days of waiting for a centralized exchange to list your token are gone. And as soon as teams launch a token, they can deposit that into a new pool in Uniswap, and traders can instantly begin buying and selling the token.
00:01:29.778 - 00:02:19.730, Speaker A: And this is what we're referring to when we say uniswap and AMMs are special due to being completely permissionless. Secondly, uniswap presented a shift from the centralized model of collecting 100% of trading fees to a communityowned Dex, where those providing liquidity earn all the fees. And if they're ever a co op bookstore of crypto trading, uniswap is it. They empower their users with the ability to provide liquidity for any token and start trading those tokens instantly. And those who provide liquidity earn a portion of fees paid by those trading in Uniswap. It's been a simple, flat zero 3% fee, and so if I hold 1% of the liquidity in a pool like ETH die, then I own 1% of all fees paid by traders. Historically, the most volatile days in crypto, especially market crashes, have only benefited centralized exchanges collecting record revenue on record trading volume with Uniswap.
00:02:19.730 - 00:02:50.722, Speaker A: Suddenly, the Uniswap community that powers all liquidity provisions can earn record fees on record trading volume. Days like these. And this is part of the reason behind the cult like following of Uniswap. Finally, uniswap and Amms like it represent yet another way. DFI has provided a parallel to legacy finance, where you can maintain 100% control of your funds when you trade on a centralized exchange. There's always risk to depositing because you have to trust that exchange not to lose your funds. But with amms like uniswap, you trust no one but the code.
00:02:50.722 - 00:03:22.126, Speaker A: And in the case of Uniswap, it's a very well battle tested code with billions of trade volume over the last few years, plus countless audits. There is of course still a risk to using uniswap, but you notably escape the need for KYC or any sort of signup. It's the cipherpunk dream realized in the form of code that can outlive the team who created it. Pretty profound. You've been watching DFI 101.
