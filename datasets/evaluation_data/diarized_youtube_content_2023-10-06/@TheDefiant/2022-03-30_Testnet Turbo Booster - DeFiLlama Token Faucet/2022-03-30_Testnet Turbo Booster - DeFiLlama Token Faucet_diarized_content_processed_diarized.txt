00:00:00.330 - 00:00:09.614, Speaker A: It. Oh my God, check this out. 10 million USDT just arrived in my wallet. I cannot believe it.
00:00:09.732 - 00:00:11.200, Speaker B: Like, how did this happen?
00:00:11.810 - 00:00:30.502, Speaker A: Slow down. Check this. This is the coven test network. And yes, I may have 10 million USDT in my wallet, but is it real money? Ha. No, but it is useful. And that is what we're going to be covering today. It's the token force it from defi llama making a process which has been baffling me for months.
00:00:30.502 - 00:00:42.838, Speaker A: Super simple. It helps devs. It might help you if you're testing out new products or looking to expand your defi horizons, but you need those pesky test tokens. This is how you're going to do it. It's actually pretty awesome. We'll dig in after these messages.

00:02:30.752 - 00:03:18.570, Speaker A: So do you ever find yourself looking at Metamask and going through the available networks and going, ooh, Coven, Robston, Rinkbeat. What's that all about? We're going to be hearing a lot about test networks in the coming months as we dig into all the exciting things going on with the merge. So they're testing what this new merged Ethereum network is going to be across testnets. Now, I've been testing out various different protocols over the last week or so, but I have to get onto coven or rinkby or Gurley, and I always come across the same problem, which is I just don't have the tokens that I need. So I might need some USDC on coven, but there are faucets, and generally what happens is the faucets don't work, or the mechanism says, oh, you've already tried to gain some of these tokens. It never really works. Defi Lama, bless them, have made it super, super easy.
00:03:18.570 - 00:03:36.282, Speaker A: Now, if you find yourself in that position where you want to test stuff out, you want to contribute to a network, because there might be a reason that you might get some test tokens. This is going to make it super easy. First things first. Dark mode. Oh, yes. Makes no difference at all. It's the first time I've ever done that dark mode.
00:03:36.282 - 00:04:00.738, Speaker A: Light mode doesn't do anything. That's fine. So what did I do to get these 10 million USDT? Well, it's super simple. I just went to the mint. I'm going to do it on USDC now. Signed a little transaction here, and then it took a little while for it to come through, but after a while, I had 10 million USDT in my wallet. That's very exciting.
00:04:00.738 - 00:04:23.194, Speaker A: You can go to the explorer to check the contract address. There's a very simple way to add it to metamask, which I really appreciate, because on testnets I find there's often various different versions of USDT or USDC. So just to be able to say, right, I want to add that to metamask. Here we go, add that token. And then if I look in metamask now and look at my assets list. Hey, look at that. Got 10 million USDC.
00:04:23.194 - 00:04:37.022, Speaker A: It's like allegedly raining money here on the testnet. $20 million like that. If only it was real. It's not real. Another thing here, you can actually create your own token. Let's do it. So let's say we want to create the DFT token.
00:04:37.022 - 00:04:48.410, Speaker A: This is the defiant tutorial token. Give them twelve decibels. Decimals. Decibels? Oh yeah. That'd be funny, wouldn't it? And a limit of 1000. Create it. We're going to sign the transaction.
00:04:48.410 - 00:05:10.042, Speaker A: Confirm like this. Let's copy that contract. And there we go. Now we have to add it to Metamask. Let's wait for it to go through first. This would be a way for you to kind of bootstrap your own tokens. But bear in mind this is all on the testnet.
00:05:10.042 - 00:05:19.422, Speaker A: All right, let's go and add that asset in. Now import the token. Contract address dft. There it is. Add custom token. Import those tokens. Boom.
00:05:19.422 - 00:05:36.914, Speaker A: Done. I have now created a token. I can check that token on Etherscan. Here it is. It's not telling me the max total supply. I did actually create 1000 of them but there we go. We just created a brand new token, a garbage token on the testnet.
00:05:36.914 - 00:05:56.526, Speaker A: No one will thank us for that. But if you actually had some useful stuff to do then this is the way to do it. I think this is awesome. I've often found the faucet process and getting test tokens a bit of a pain in the butt but this is a way to make it super easy. And it's from Defi llama. If you didn't know who defi llama is let me just show you. This is basically the go to place.
00:05:56.526 - 00:06:20.370, Speaker A: It's where I go for quick information on chains. You might have seen it in various videos over the last kind of year or so but this is where I get my information. Defi llama top stuff. That's it for today.
