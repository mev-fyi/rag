00:00:00.250 - 00:00:38.710, Speaker A: Today we're diving into Zksync error, and if you watch till the end, we'll walk you through the exact steps you need to qualify for the potential airdrop. First step is to add Zksync error to your metamask wallet, and the easy way of doing this is to go chainlist.org and search for Zksync. Step two, we're going to bridge assets to era and to do this, we have to go to bridge zksync IO step three next we have syncswap XYZ and what we're going to do here is swap some ETH for USDC. Next up is step four, minting our very own zk domain. Once we've checked the availability and connected our wallet, we can register with ETH. And there we go.
00:00:38.710 - 00:00:59.290, Speaker A: As simple as that. Step five, we're going to buy and mint an NFT on Mint square. Make sure you see the forward slash Zksync in the URL bar, and only mint an NFT with the letters zk before the project. Once we have the collection in front of us, we choose the NFT we like, we click buy, we confirm the transaction and celebrate. You'll now qualify for the potential airdrop.
