00:00:23.370 - 00:00:55.962, Speaker A: Well, hello, everyone. Happy Friday. Welcome to the Defiance Weekly recap on our YouTube channel insane week. Just headlines popping right and left. Our crack team of staff writers and editors tackled it all with the usual aplomb. Before we jump right in, I just wanted to give a big shout out to our sponsor today. Singular Dao has been providing decentralized crypto management tools to maximize your alpha.
00:00:55.962 - 00:01:37.942, Speaker A: And we're going to hear more from Singularity Dow a little later in the show. But now on to introductions and then let's jump right in. We have with us today Alex Gilbert, writer in New York, YYC trader, our director of news who's based in the wilds of Canada. We have writer Owen Furnow who is in San Francisco in the Bay Area. And I am reporting to you today from St. Maritz of all places in Switzerland where I've been covering and representing the Defiant at the CFC St. Maritz Crypto conference.
00:01:37.942 - 00:02:31.070, Speaker A: And I'll share a little bit more about what happened at this three day event a little later in our chat. But let's start off with, huh? Yeah, we can get to all the crazy headlines a little later. But on the Defi front, there were some really interesting developments this week. We had. Alex, we'll begin with you. There was a deal, you don't see Amazon a lot in headlines in the Defiant, but this week we had a partnership that was announced between Avalanche the L2 and Amazon Web services, which is the retail, the online retail giant's huge cloud computing operation. And this partnership was designed to boost subnet deployment.
00:02:31.070 - 00:02:35.120, Speaker A: Alex, what was the news? What happened? What's the steel going to do?
00:02:36.690 - 00:03:35.620, Speaker B: Yeah. So folks who've been reading the Defiant might know that Avalanche, part of its strategy is to have this kind of, these subnets that exist on Avalanche are app specific blockchains essentially. And with this partnership, the hope is that Amazon Web Services is going to be able to boost subnet deployment. So it's going to be essentially contributing credits to projects that are looking to deploy subnets in Avalanche. I don't know if I'm going to pronounce his name correctly, but Emin Gun, the Avalanche founder, former Cornell professor, big Twitter personality, he talked up the deal on Twitter the other day saying that it's not a typical Amazon Web services partnership with a blockchain company. First of all, it's not that Avalanche went to Amazon. It's the other way around.
00:03:35.620 - 00:03:49.800, Speaker B: And there was no money that Avalanche paid, I guess to settle the deal. Right. What else?
00:03:51.370 - 00:03:57.880, Speaker C: Token price ripped. It was up like 20% or something. I guess you can see that on our chart right there.
00:03:58.810 - 00:04:31.860, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a huge boost, avalanche itself. Right. And to be clear, the partnership is between Amazon Web Services. It's the cloud hosting arm of Amazon, and maybe it's chief moneymaker. It kind of flies under the radar, but it's like one of their biggest sources of revenue. And Ava Labs, the company behind Avalanche, that contributes to its deployment. And it's interesting because it's another example of the big tech firms seeing opportunity in.
00:04:36.710 - 00:04:58.460, Speaker C: Yeah, I just wonder, what does Amazon get out of here? Are they getting more people to use their web services to deploy subnets? Is that kind of your read? I mean, fine, if you don't know, but, yeah, I'm just wondering what they're getting out of this.
00:04:59.390 - 00:05:02.474, Speaker B: No, it's a good question. We actually haven't heard from Amazon yet.
00:05:02.512 - 00:05:02.762, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:02.816 - 00:05:26.050, Speaker B: So Ava Labs had announced the deal, and we got their perspective on what this means for them and for the avalanche ecosystem. What exactly Amazon is getting out of it remains to be seen. I mean, it could just be kind of grabbing market share as far as deployment of blockchain technology. Right?
00:05:26.200 - 00:05:27.634, Speaker C: Sure. Yeah.
00:05:27.832 - 00:05:44.010, Speaker D: I mean, we've seen a lot of cloud providers shy away from crypto. Right. So this might just be Amazon's way of kind of signaling to the broader crypto community that, hey, we're friendly.
00:05:45.870 - 00:05:59.966, Speaker C: Yeah, we had Hetzner last year. They pulled the plug on anyone using, I think, their servers for crypto activities, including mining or staking. So. Yeah, interesting to see.
00:05:59.988 - 00:06:35.290, Speaker A: That's right. I remember that story. I mean, I think it is important that you have validation of a L2 coming from such a huge player. I mean, they are the number one global player in cloud computing. In a way, AWS almost created the market, and both Microsoft and Google kind of came in after them. And Microsoft, their azure cloud computing business, has done really well in trying to catch up to AWS. But AWS doesn't go into anything like this lightly.
00:06:35.290 - 00:07:32.958, Speaker A: They will have done all manner of testing. Due diligence, you can bet. And so for them to do this is just a huge shot in the arm for not just avalanche, but the whole L2 proposition and for the DeFi proposition writ large. And I thought that's why, Alex, your story really caught my eye. And I think it's indicative of what I think will be the biggest story in DeFi this year, which is the coming together of traditional players, whether they're in finance or whether they're in technology services like this and DeFi protocols and blockchain networks, et cetera. So I think this was a good one for us to follow. I think we should do more reporting on a piece like this.
00:07:32.958 - 00:08:54.598, Speaker A: And AWS is notoriously Sphinx like when it comes to disclosing information and talking about what it does. So Alex, if they haven't gotten back to you, you shouldn't feel bad. They don't get back to so, but we'll see what happens with this and we'll see how Microsoft responds, because there is just incredible arch rivalry between AWS and Microsoft's Azure holding. And I just want to give a shout out here to Tegan Klein, who's our good friend and colleague who's been hosting some of our podcasts. And if you want to go to the website, we have a new podcast up with York Rhodes of Microsoft, who now this is kind of more NFT focused, but just to shout out while we're talking about them, that York has a really fascinating conversation with Tagan where he talks about how Microsoft is leveraging ethereum. And so just want to say, if you want to listen to that, go to our website and that podcast is up and running. Let's turn to another huge defi event.
00:08:54.598 - 00:09:26.430, Speaker A: And that of course is liquidity staking. And Alex, we'll stick with you for now, but you had a really nice story today on rocket pool, making this Coinbase deal with an eye toward using it to help catch Lido, who is just really out front in liquidity staking and has established such a dominant position. Just walk us through this rocket pool Coinbase deal and what the implications are for liquidity.
00:09:28.850 - 00:10:35.000, Speaker B: And so rocket pool is a dual governance structure. It's got a PDAO and an O Dow decentralized autonomous organization. The Odao is, I'm going to get this wrong, but I think 18 or 19 members, they decide who gets to join their group. And it was just announced earlier this week that the newest member is likely going to be a subsidiary of Coinbase, Coinbase Ventures. The ODEV is important because there are some very technical stuff it does that I'm not going to get into and bore everybody with, but it also votes on contract upgrades within the rocket pool protocol. So it's an important position. And folks that I spoke to at rocket pool were clear to stress to me that no individual member has any special kind of power, right? So this addition in itself isn't going to change anything about the functioning of rocket pool or just how it works, what its goals are.
00:10:35.000 - 00:11:38.166, Speaker B: But Odell membership, I was told, is often a launch pad for greater collaboration. Some members of the Odell can be very passive. They can kind of just handle the technical stuff that they're supposed to and leave it at that. Others see themselves as being a kind of steward of the protocol and taking a more active role in making proposals and working with the team. And people took notice. Right, so there's been narrative to begin this year, or maybe not a narrative so much as just general interest in liquid staking protocols, right, because their success, their very existence, really hinges on. Well, first it hinged on the merge, and now it's going to rely on the next big Ethereum upgrade, which is currently slated for march, and that's going to allow withdrawal of staked ether, right? If you want to contribute to the security of Ethereum, you've got to stake your ether.
00:11:38.166 - 00:13:15.770, Speaker B: You've got to lock it up. The return for doing that is a modest annual reward. The problem is that developers who work on Ethereum have yet to build in functionality that would allow people to withdraw the ether that they had locked up. Staking protocols have existed since, I don't know exactly when, but they've been around for a little while now, right? You've been able to stake ether since December 2020 when the beacon chain went live, right? So for a while now, people have been putting money into these protocols with the expectation that one day they'll be able to take it out if they so choose liquid staking protocols, just to kind of give people an understanding of what exactly they do, they allow you to stake your ether no matter how much you have, right? Normally you'd need to put up 32 ether, which is an incredible amount of money for anybody. With this, you can put up any amount, they'll bundle it, they'll stake the 32 on your behalf, and then they'll give you a derivative token that you can then trade as if it were ether, right? So amid this excitement about liquid staking protocols and withdrawals coming, governance tokens for the protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool have been doing really well to start the year, every token did really well this week, with positive inflation data coming out of the US. Nevertheless, Rocket Pool's token RPL really outperformed. Last I checked, it was up 8% since this news had been announced.
00:13:15.770 - 00:13:48.550, Speaker B: And it's a sign that this relatively small protocol, this kind of scrappy upstart that's trying to take on Lido, a much bigger competitor that's kind of taking on Coinbase itself. Because Coinbase offers a competing liquid staking service, has a powerful ally in its corner, a giant within crypto that in making this jump is saying, hey, we care about decentralization.
00:13:50.570 - 00:14:13.600, Speaker A: Well, that's an interesting angle, is that Coinbase is kind of doing this and rocket pool is essentially competing with it. Nevertheless, Coinbase Ventures decided to go ahead with this deal. I mean, their goals are different. Coinbase Ventures is a venture fund, so they want investment returns. So they see rocket pool as a promising play in that regard. But it is interesting to see Coinbase on kind of like two different sides of.
00:14:14.530 - 00:14:50.250, Speaker B: Yeah, and somebody that's prominent within the rocket pool community had told me that, and this is purely speculation. There's no indication that this is actually going to happen. But should this be the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership, hopefully Coinbase might list rocket pool's liquid staking derivative on its exchange. Right. Because Coinbase has its own liquid staking product and doesn't list competitors. Right. Now, should it do that for rocket Pool? I mean, that would be a boon to the protocol.
00:14:51.710 - 00:15:24.130, Speaker A: Fascinating. Okay, really interesting story. I'd like to jump now, if we could, to another. This gets back to this theme of traditional finance and Defi coming together. Tokenized securities have been explored in Defi for a long, long time now, but I think they're really picking up steam. I just noticed at the CFC conference here in St. Maritz, it was one of the hottest topics going.
00:15:24.130 - 00:16:10.674, Speaker A: Everyone was talking about the push to securitize bonds, to securitize stocks, derivatives and use tokenization to bring a lot of those on chain. The defiant. We've reported in the past on experiments where Morgan, other banks have been tokenizing deposits to try and smooth the movement of such things. And so that's why this finance, you know, launched Tokenize US treasuries and corporate bonds, I think was a really cool story. I think. I think that. Owen, you reported on this story this week.
00:16:10.674 - 00:16:14.340, Speaker A: Could you walk us through the implications of the.
00:16:17.910 - 00:17:35.674, Speaker C: I mean, at a high level, this caught my eye because we've seen people try to go the opposite direction in terms of getting exposure to crypto assets in traditional securities. I mean, the most well known of which is GBTC. And so basically this was going the other direction in that it was allowing people, I believe it wasn't accredited investors, but there was another somewhat technical term which it allowed people who had gone through KYC and AML to get exposure to traditional ETFs through a token. So, I mean, at a very high level, it was interesting seeing that flow go the opposite way. And I talked to the founder and CEO of Ondo. And it was kind of illuminating to hear that developing security tokens actually isn't that hard from the perspective of. I thought the legality would actually be very difficult, and that's why we haven't seen many security tokens.
00:17:35.674 - 00:18:39.134, Speaker C: But he actually suggested me that it was pretty easy, provided you jump through the hoops that you do jump through. Anyhow, from a high level, I think that's very interesting. And it's very interesting that we're at a point in crypto where I would say that a lot of the layer ones have been deployed. There are some L2s, but I think these crazy outsized returns that we've seen may be ebbing away. And now we're kind of seeing more traditional finance start to move towards the blockchain and kind of take advantages of the frictionless way in which you can transact on the blockchain, which people have promoted for so long. And it's fascinating to think that we might see these. We're going to see this idea of a real meshing of the financial systems, which is interesting to see people try to get returns on, try to get returns on traditional assets through the blockchain anyways.
00:18:39.182 - 00:19:27.330, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think there's two ways to kind of look at this development. On the one hand, this is a trading story. So by tokenizing these securities, you're creating a synthetic version. It's a derivative, so you're creating a synthetic version of an underlying asset or security. In this case, what Ondo has done is treasurized, forgive me, tokenized treasuries and short term investment grade bond fund. And then to do that for ETFs, too, which is a really clever way of kind of getting around the SEC's refusal to actually approve a bona fide crypto or bitcoin ETF. And what it does from a trading perspective is it creates arbitrage opportunities between the tokenized version of the security and the actual security itself.
00:19:27.330 - 00:20:12.766, Speaker A: So, for example, tokenized Tesla stock has been traded since forever. And so you can trade in tokenized Tesla stock, but then you've got actual Tesla stock, and there's going to be a price relationship between these two securities. And exploiting that price relationship is what sophisticated, accredited investors do. So that's the trading angle. But the other angle, which I think is going to really pick up momentum as this year progresses, is distribution, is price, creation of new products. Now, what Ondo's got is actually creating products, financial products that it's now putting out. And so issuers of bonds, issuers of ETFs, issuers of stocks may choose now to say, hey, oh my God.
00:20:12.766 - 00:20:57.674, Speaker A: There's this alternative distribution channel that's being created for these types of securities. Now, I think regulators at some point are going to take a hard look at all of this. Who knows what that'll mean. But these are derivatives, and the derivatives market is as old as the hills. So that's why it's not exactly a herculean task to actually fashion these things, to make them. But if there was any chance that retail investors were somehow accessing these, then you could have some trouble. In the UK, it's actually illegal to market products like this to retail investors.
00:20:57.674 - 00:21:16.390, Speaker A: I don't think it's that pat in the US yet, but this is frontier stuff. And so hats off to you, Owen, for your reporting on this piece. I think this is one that'll be very interesting to a lot of Defi folk.
00:21:17.530 - 00:21:29.210, Speaker C: And would you qualify this token as a derivative, even though it represents, from my understanding, one to one backing in a real ETF?
00:21:31.070 - 00:22:11.720, Speaker A: Yeah, I would use the word derivative. Others could argue or push back on that term, but you're creating a synthetic security that is separate from its underlying security. And whenever you do that, there's never going to be 100% correlation between the pricing of these things. Sure, you're creating this kind of doppelganger of this, but I guess maybe that's a potential debate that'll take.
00:22:16.170 - 00:22:56.370, Speaker C: I just, I think Ando released, a few days after they made this announcement, they released a protocol which I think should allow these tokens to. These tokens can interact with the protocol. I believe it was a lending protocol. So, I mean, just at a high level, it's interesting that there might be kind of like, you might start to see these kind of whitelisted DeFi protocols interacting with these also whitelisted or maybe sandboxed tokens. And so you can kind of see this permissioned DeFi ecosystem emerge based on maybe what was experimented on in the open world, but they might kind of close it off for financial institutions.
00:22:57.190 - 00:24:03.366, Speaker A: I guess the other way to look at it is that what you're trying to do is create a more efficient product, so you're trying to create a more efficient version of whatever that security is, and efficient in terms of distribution, transparency, et cetera. But as soon as you do that, there's going to be a trade opportunity. And I mean, look at stablecoins, they don't trade exactly one to one, do they? I mean, there's always fractional differences in the pricing that's what traders look for. Sure. Let's just stay with you for a second, Owen, because this is really switching here. But that you wrote this week about pleaserdow launching a game show featuring Edward Snowden and Daniel Ellsberg. Edward Snowden, of course, is the NSA whistleblower who exposed a lot of secrets around US government surveillance of telecom.
00:24:03.366 - 00:24:33.540, Speaker A: And then, of course, Daniel Ellsberg is throwback to the early 70s. He was the former Rand analyst and Department of Defense aide who exposed the Pentagon papers, which was the US government's secret history of the Vietnam War. And it's just kind of wild to see these two kind of legendary whistleblowers suddenly swept up in an NFT like game show. Tell us about.
00:24:34.710 - 00:24:43.062, Speaker C: I mean, caveat. I wasn't able to tune into the show, which actually happened yesterday. So I'm basing my information on.
00:24:43.116 - 00:24:48.362, Speaker A: Well, no, that's because you had like three stories I was working.
00:24:48.416 - 00:25:53.022, Speaker C: Yeah, I didn't have time for TV anyways. But based on my conversation with Jamis, who was, I think his technical or non technical term is a chief pleasing officer at. I mean, they're kind of entering this paradigm, which I think a lot of people are, where they're like, okay, we have these things called NFTs, like you collect them, but what's happening next? And we've seen other news kind of surrounding that paradigm this week. But, yeah, I mean, pleaserdao, for context, they emerged to collect people pleaser, who is a crypto artist who came on our podcast maybe a year ago or a year and a half ago. They emerged as kind of an autonomous group to buy an NFT on a uniswap, almost like an advertisement for the third iteration. That's a lot of crypto speak. But basically they emerged to buy this piece of art.
00:25:53.022 - 00:26:47.710, Speaker C: And now they have continued acquiring kind of like very fundamental trademark pieces. And now this is kind of them flipping the switch from just being kind of this group of collectors to becoming people who are trying to have output. And so this is kind of their first iteration, which is they're selling an NFT, I think, related to Ellsberg, or I think he's kind of the, I think, listed as the creator. And they're auctioning it off to a couple of journalism oriented nonprofits. And, yeah, I mean, I think they're just starting to play with these kind of cultural elements and these tools we have of like, let's run a game show, let's run an auction. While we're doing it, we're going to have a live stream. So I think the guy was like, he's saying, we're taking elements of twitch, we're taking elements of adult swim.
00:26:47.710 - 00:27:33.978, Speaker C: And I saw screenshots of the show and it did look very kind of uniquely crypto with the kind of retro chic aesthetic. So it'll be interesting to see where they go from here as far as I think they're looking to sell other pieces. They're looking to kind of build out the media aspect of what they're doing. So I think, again, overall, I think we're in this interesting space where people in the NFT world are bored and they're like, you can't just collect these things. We need to start doing things. And likewise with Defi, it's like we can't just toss money around and play all these weird circular economic games. So it's actually exciting time in crypto.
00:27:34.074 - 00:28:20.846, Speaker A: Yeah, no, very good point. It's interesting that they're kind of becoming a studio. They're essentially saying we need to be producing different kinds of content that uses blockchain uniqueness. And again, if NFTs have done anything is they've demonstrated their utility as marketing channels. But what's cool about this is it isn't just a marketing channel. You're actually creating awareness around some very big and important mean. What Snowden did arguably change the world.
00:28:20.846 - 00:29:07.530, Speaker A: Now, it was one of the biggest stories of the year. I mean, it was certainly the biggest whistleblowing case since Ellsberg. But if people don't know who Daniel Ells, there's a whole new generation or two who don't really know what Ellsberg did. They don't know how important the Pentagon papers were in stripping the lies away from the government's portrayal of the Vietnam war. And it changed the way we look at the Vietnam war. So if this technology can be used to bring fresh attention to that episode in our history, that's pretty cool. I mean, that's pretty valuable.
00:29:07.530 - 00:29:34.560, Speaker A: So I think this is really interesting, and it's kind of a nice repost to critics who constantly dismiss NfT technology as being silly and stupid or whatever. It's like, well, no, check this out. Really interesting.
00:29:36.650 - 00:29:43.298, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. A classy move, I think, by pleaserdao to bring in Ellsberg. I appreciate.
00:29:43.394 - 00:29:58.620, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that's a good point. Okay. All right. Well, before we move on, I just wanted to give another shout out to today's sponsor, singularity Dao, and let's learn a little bit more about them now.
00:29:59.870 - 00:30:55.840, Speaker E: Singularity dao. Is a decentralized portfolio optimization solution. Their dynasets, non custodial tokenized vaults containing crypto tokens paired with stablecoins, use quantitative trading strategies and market signals generated by advanced artificial intelligence. Current diner sets, which run on Ethereum named Dyne, BTC, and die ETH, have outperformed the market consistently for the last nine months. On January 9, the first diner set opened on BMB chain, offering participants exposure to an optimized vault of layer one blockchain tokens, including wrapped Cardano, Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin, BNB, and others. Contributions to this new diner set, called Dine L, one, B and B, close on January 16. Make sure to go take a look before then at not only one of the best performing asset management solutions, but also one of the only ones that leave you with full control of your assets at all times.
00:30:59.250 - 00:31:31.480, Speaker A: All right, we're back. Maybe we buried the lead on our episode here, but let's talk about the market. The rally not only continued this week, but accelerated, it must be said, in tandem with stocks. But we saw some real gains across DFI, across Ethereum, bitcoin as well. YYC what's going on? What's driving this?
00:31:32.570 - 00:32:29.910, Speaker D: I mean, we've started 2023 with a bang, right? We've been reporting on that consistently. And subscribers who follow our weekly DFI alpha calls will know that. We've been kind of calling for this move since late. Yeah, I mean, it's just a question of sentiment has improved going into the new year. And of course we had inflation figures yesterday that show that prices may be cooling in the US and the economy is kind of cooling down as the Fed intended. That doesn't mean, of course, that the Fed is suddenly going to say, all right, we're going to pivot to easy money again. According to CME, Fed watch 25 basis point hike is still expected at the Feb meeting in about, just about two weeks from now.
00:32:29.910 - 00:33:21.920, Speaker D: But for now at least, it seems that the bulls are in control for the time being. In terms of sentiment, it seems that investors are either skeptical, well, with good reason, be seeing that most rallies we've had in 2022 just ended up being dead cat bounces and we ended up trading lower after them. But at the same time, we also have funding rates that have been consistently negative during this move up, which indicates that people are shorting the move, expecting this rally to fizzle out eventually. Now, which way is going to break? That's of course the million dollar question. But for now, we're trading above at least on ETH above the 200 day average. So that's a positive sign.
00:33:23.090 - 00:33:24.734, Speaker A: Yeah. Investors will take it.
00:33:24.772 - 00:34:13.754, Speaker D: Right, yeah. And I think another interesting thing we saw this week was that despite all the drama going on around DCG, Grayscale and the SEC just charged Genesis and Gemini yesterday. But despite all that, someone's buying up GBTC and the premium. Sorry, the discount. Basically, for those who aren't familiar, GBTC is a closed ended bitcoin trust. So when you buy shares in GBTC, which are publicly traded, you're buying a share of an underlying pool of bitcoin. And because it's a closed ended fund, which means that you can't redeem the shares directly for bitcoin, it's been trading.
00:34:13.754 - 00:35:02.458, Speaker D: I mean, it doesn't always trade one to one. And the price of the shares kind of oscillate between premium and discount, depending on how many people actually want to buy these shares in the open market. And since we've been in a bear market for most of 2022, the discount obviously has been widening and it hit nearly 50% in December, meaning that a share of GBDC essentially meant you could buy bitcoin for half price, assuming that you're able to redeem it or they come back in line eventually at some point. And, yeah, despite all the DCG stuff, the discount has narrowed to 39%. That was as of yesterday.
00:35:02.554 - 00:35:21.650, Speaker A: Yeah, that's. Yeah. So should we interpret this as a signal that at least some investors out there don't believe that scale is going to go sideways as a result of all the drama around DCG?
00:35:23.590 - 00:35:51.340, Speaker D: Certainly looks that way. It's just been like a week or so of a rally in the markets and sentiment being void, probably also by the whole FTX finding 5 billion. So people might expect positive catalysts going forward, but again, until proven otherwise, we're still in a bear market.
00:35:52.190 - 00:36:39.354, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not the time. One of the things that was interesting to pick up here at the CFC conference in St. Maritz. This conference is populated by a lot of very sophisticated investors. So there's a lot of representatives of family offices, hedge funds, foundations. So very sophisticated people who have been in the markets for a long, long, long time and have been in crypto for a long time as another asset class. The overall sentiment was that just bluntly, like, should happen in crypto and you got to be roll with this.
00:36:39.354 - 00:37:14.790, Speaker A: And this is as insane as FTX coming on the back of all of the other failures of last year. It's kind of in character. The cryptocurrency market. That mean that's the perspective. For what it's worth, that's the perspective that many of the investors I talk to at this conference are taking. So they're not running for the hills. On quite the contrary, they're looking for buying opportunities in the space, especially now with valuation so discounted.
00:37:14.790 - 00:38:17.274, Speaker A: And I think there's something to be said too, at the speed with which the FTX case has moved. So we went from FTX having a run to FTX going bankrupt, to a criminal indictment of SPF and guilty pleas by his colleagues in the space of like six weeks. So it's like the story is truncated. It isn't like this is just going to stretch out over a long period of time. It's like everybody kind of knows what happened at this point, right? I mean, this alleged charges against this BF, he may be acquitted, we never know if he goes to trial, but most people seem to be kind of tying it off and saying it happened, but we're moving on. At least that's the vibe that I'm up here.
00:38:17.392 - 00:38:36.450, Speaker C: Yeah, that's fascinating insight, because from the outside you could easily say like everyone's writing off crypto as a toy or a ten year fad that was enabled by low interest rates or something. So it's interesting that very experienced players are still taking it seriously.
00:38:37.510 - 00:39:45.010, Speaker A: Yeah, but it goes to your point, Owen, that you made earlier, which is that what they need to see now, especially with DeFi, is utility. And I think you put it really well, which is just, this can't just be some kind of circular thing where everybody's just trading with the person sitting next to them. And it's just like this private little market. There has to be real infrastructure build out and adoption on the one side and then a much more sophisticated and accessible asset base on the other side. And that's what people in the space in DeFi should be looking at in the year to come, is how do those twin stories develop as they kind of come along? But YYC, just to get back to what you see in the market right now, sure, we can't say that bear market is over or by any means. Maybe this is just another dead cat bounce. I mean, who knows? There's still threats of recession, so the macro overhang is still there and so forth.
00:39:45.010 - 00:39:48.234, Speaker A: But a rally is a rally, right?
00:39:48.432 - 00:40:16.880, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. And we've seen some great outperformance from some DFI names this week. For example, fracs share is up 14% today. Okay, Decentraland is up. Phantom. Phantom is like trying to reinvent itself, I guess, like Andre is back for whether that remains to be.
00:40:18.610 - 00:40:45.180, Speaker A: Well, that's. That's a story that we need to kind of look into. And I just want to give a shout out to Alex here because he's got a frac story in the works, which we're looking forward to. So next week, we should have a really deep dive on fracs coming out. And now that we see what the token is doing, that story will be even more important. So no pressure, Alex, but we're looking forward to that one.
00:40:46.190 - 00:40:47.260, Speaker B: Not at all.
00:40:49.150 - 00:41:43.840, Speaker A: You don't feel any pressure, do you? All right, well, I don't want to belabor all of the fire and brimstone in the market, but this Cameron Winklevoss Gemini versus Barry Silbert Genesis story is extraordinary and extremely newsworthy. And Alex just kind of bring us up to speed on what happened earlier in the week with Winklevoss dropping a second open letter accusing Silbert of accounting fraud and demanding a return of assets to Gemini customers. And then walk us through that to the end of the week when the SEC suddenly weighed in.
00:41:45.010 - 00:42:29.286, Speaker B: Yeah, and just like the background, real quick, the quickest version of it is that Gemini, the crypto exchange, based in the US, and Genesis, the crypto lending firm, a subsidiary of crypto conglomerate DCG, just a holding company that happens to own a lot of the biggest names in crypto. Genesis and Gemini had a partnership. Gemini had a program called Gemini Earn promised customers very handsome return on crypto deposits. You just park your crypto and you make money. So customers would park their money in Gemini earn. Gemini would hand it off to Genesis. Genesis would lend it out to institutional investors.
00:42:29.286 - 00:42:37.790, Speaker B: It would make a profit. It would skim some of that off, hand it back to Gemini. Gemini would skim some of that off and then give its customers that return that it had promised.
00:42:38.690 - 00:42:39.440, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:40.850 - 00:43:29.226, Speaker B: In November, about a week after the collapse of FTX, genesis froze customer assets. It had taken a big hit, me, earlier in the year after the collapse of three Arrows capital. Three arrows was one of the institutional investors to which it had lent money. When three arrows collapsed, it took a billion dollar blow, basically. And with the collapse of FTX and people withdrawing money and all the just craziness in the know, it gave that kind of vague answer that everybody gives when they freeze customer assets. We have liquidity issues. And about $900 million worth of Gemini earn customers money is trapped in Genesis.
00:43:29.226 - 00:44:01.020, Speaker B: Now. It's about 34,000 customers that account for that $900 million. So last week, one of the Winkleboss twins. Cameron Winkleboss had shared an open letter to Barry Silbert, the CEO of DCG, the company that owns Genesis, saying, you've been dragging your feet on finding a solution. We've got all these customers. They're frustrated. Their life savings are potentially lost on your platform.
00:44:01.020 - 00:44:49.190, Speaker B: We're giving you a deadline. Come to us by January Eigth, which is this past Sunday, with a solution. That deadline came and went so early this week, Cameron Winkleboss really let it rip. He accused Barry Silbert and DCG of having committed fraud, of having misled people into investing or trusting Genesis with their money. In his earlier letter, he had hinted at the commingling of funds. And it's one thing to say you did a bad job running your company. It's another to say you're a criminal.
00:44:54.670 - 00:44:56.460, Speaker A: How did Silbert respond to.
00:44:59.070 - 00:45:38.034, Speaker B: And just real quick to kind of finish off this summary of winkleballs'latest letter. This was addressed to the board of DCG and he was calling on them to fire Barry Silbert. Anyway, Silbert came out with a letter of his own. This was a letter to shareholders that was shared on a website that seems like it was set up specifically for this. Right? I think it's called like dcgupdate.com. I don't know whether this existed before Tuesday afternoon. In this letter to shareholders, it's like a point by point rebuttal, but it's lacking in details.
00:45:38.034 - 00:45:56.800, Speaker B: Right. Let me actually pull that up while we're talking about this. But it kind of denies the broader strokes of the allegations, but it doesn't get into the nitty gritty of it.
00:45:57.250 - 00:46:12.530, Speaker A: Well, that's what was remarkable about Cameron Winklevoss's letter is it was very detailed and it was set up like a timeline almost. So the specificity of it was extraordinary.
00:46:13.990 - 00:46:47.310, Speaker B: Right? And so one of the things alleged is that one of the acts of fraud is that in financial documents shared with the Gemini team last year, vaping Genesis had put a promissory note due in 2032 as a current asset, which would make Genesis's position look better than it really was. This is a promissory note that was given by parent company DCG.
00:46:48.610 - 00:46:49.360, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:50.770 - 00:47:50.820, Speaker B: And Cameron Winkleballs is saying that promissory note due ten years from now isn't a current asset and that this, quote unquote misrepresentation made Genesis look financially healthy when in fact it was not. Another thing that he alleges is that there was a kind of circular, speaking of defiant circular trades, there was a kind of circular trade between three arrows, the failed hedge fund and Genesis, whereby Genesis would lend three arrows, bitcoin. They would convert the bitcoin into GBTC, which is the product of another DCG company, and post that as the collateral to future bitcoin loans from Genesis. And that this should have been marked as a risky derivative and was just marked as.
00:47:51.510 - 00:48:50.278, Speaker A: The bottom line is that Winkleboss is saying that Silbert is using his position as CEO of DCG to manipulate the various assets in its respective units to shore up weaknesses and vulnerabilities in other units. So he's moving the chips around the table to kind of shore up positions here, here and here. But he's allegedly demonstrating a strength. And Cameron saying, if you had done this all honestly, you would have shown the true weaknesses in financials in these positions, and then that would have affected the terms of our deal, whether we would have put our customers in it. And now is motivating you to make bad faith decisions about trying to resolve all of these situations. So that's kind of the gist of his.
00:48:50.364 - 00:48:50.902, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:48:51.036 - 00:49:22.320, Speaker A: Allegations. Okay, so meanwhile, all this is happening. Well, let me just finish. All of this is happening as news breaks that the eastern district of New York, which is US prosecutors in Brooklyn, are investigating DCG for this kind of alleged. And so that kind of lends a lot of weight to what Cameron Winklevoss is saying. So that even puts more pressure on DCG and Barry Silver, right?
00:49:23.090 - 00:50:10.990, Speaker B: Yeah, it does. Now, it's funny, because while DCG and Barry Silbert are taking all this heat, toward the end of the week, this news broke. Just yesterday, the SEC comes out and charges both companies with having sold unregistered securities. Right? So it's interesting because every time the SEC comes out and accuses a crypto company of selling an unregistered security, it's typically a token. And everybody in the crypto community kind of freaks out, as they should, because the SEC is. The line is regulating through enforcement. But here, the issue wasn't a token.
00:50:10.990 - 00:51:15.880, Speaker B: It was the Gemini earn product. And the idea was that this interest bearing product, managed by Gemini and Genesis, was an unregistered security and had it registered with the SEC as securities are supposed to investors, the retail investors whose money is now trapped on Genesis, would have had far more information available to them to decide whether or not this was a good bet to make. And the line in the complaint that I've got here in front of me, investors lacked material information about Gemini earn that would have been relevant to their investment decisions. They didn't have the, quote, full monopoly of information required by federal securities laws. And something that the SEC goes to pains to point out is that when Genesis first started offering its lending product, its customers were all institutional investors. So the savvy, big money, many people.
00:51:16.570 - 00:51:17.462, Speaker A: That's right.
00:51:17.596 - 00:51:58.530, Speaker B: Who know better, who should know. You know, the point of the SEC and securities laws isn't to protect those guys. It's to protect retail investors who are also trying to make a buck in our capital markets. And by the time the assets were frozen in November of last year, the SEC says the value of retail investors, crypto assets held by Gemini, exceeded the collective value of those tendered by institutional and accredited investors. So Genesis had effectively become a lending company that dealt with normal people and not institutional investors.
00:51:59.430 - 00:52:27.626, Speaker A: That's right. So that's where they're going to jump in. And just keep in mind that it isn't just registered securities, it's also investment contracts are covered. So that would cover any kind of credit based product. So that's SEC is clearly looking at earn and saying, look, we're not saying this is a stock. We're saying it could be an investment contract, but it's still required to be registered. All the disclosure rules would come in.
00:52:27.626 - 00:53:12.454, Speaker A: ET mean for Gensler. This kind of brings together two powerful initiatives that he's been pushing on crypto. One, existing law covers all of this stuff, so you better comply with it. That's his big message. And then number two, he wants to create deterrence so that other outfits out there will see what's now happening with Genesis, Gemini, and they will, of their own accord, say, look, we better err on the safe side here. Let's just go ahead and go through the registration process with SEC on these investment contracts or securities or what they may be. But back to your point, Alex.
00:53:12.454 - 00:54:23.490, Speaker A: What's really newsworthy in this report is that SEC is targeting earn. At the same time, Cameron Winklevoss has completely lost his mind on what Silbert and DCG are doing on this. At the same time that US prosecutors are investigating potential wrongdoing at DCG, which, if it involves commingling of funds, if it involves taking assets from pot A and putting them in pot B to make pot B stronger and so forth, that will evoke memories that are not so old of SBF and FTX. We got to keep our eye on this. This is a fast moving story now, and it's popping right and left and it kind of materialized here. I mean, this was a huge topic of conversation at the CFC confab in St. Maritz.
00:54:23.490 - 00:55:23.490, Speaker A: And not the least when CZ himself weighed in on the genesis Gemini. Donnie Brooke, CZ was, he did a keynote interview here on Wednesday and he started out, I mean, there's a number of concerns that he needs to address. As we have reported in the defiant withdrawals are spiking up at Binance. People are not satisfied with the proof of reserves that Binance has produced. So there's a lot of questions swirling around that. There's a lot of just basic governance questions swirling around CZ and his outsized power over the. But, you know, in this interview, he couldn't help himself.
00:55:23.490 - 00:56:28.554, Speaker A: And he just took a shot at Gemini by saying, hey, we would never do what Genesis or Gemini do in giving customer assets over to a third party, which may or may not behave very well with them. That's something that we would not do and so forth. And as we know, Cz isn't shy about kind of taking shots here and there when he feels like it. So that was kind of a zinger that came out. But the other news in his interview is it was just kind of striking that he was here. And I think it speaks to probably a level of concern that he has about defending binance and shoring up confidence in the exchange amidst all of these questions. And he was able here to kind of connect with a lot of, again, very sophisticated investors, very sophisticated players in crypto and defi space.
00:56:28.554 - 00:57:09.238, Speaker A: And he was around. I mean, I chatted with him at this dinner event, which was actually up in a chalet on the mountain in St. Maritz, and he was chatting up with everybody. And he told me that he's kind of resisting the idea that binance will be seen as the lender of last resort, which was a role that binance cast itself in when FTX first started going sideways. Remember, he's like, oh, well, he did that. Remember, the letter of understanding seems so long ago now, but he did the letter of understanding like, oh, we'll rescue FTX. We'll go in.
00:57:09.238 - 00:57:22.940, Speaker A: But then we read the financials. No, we're not going to do it now. He's like, look, don't look to binance to save the industry. That's not our job. We're not a central bank. And that was kind of a striking position for him to take.
00:57:24.270 - 00:57:30.150, Speaker B: Yeah. Not just the FTX letter, but the industry recovery fund that had been proposed.
00:57:30.310 - 00:57:32.730, Speaker A: Yes, very good point. Yeah, that's.
00:57:35.790 - 00:57:36.540, Speaker B: Just.
00:57:37.010 - 00:57:45.806, Speaker C: Go, go. You got it. Okay. I'll just say, yeah, FTX kind of tried to take on that role, which has made their collapse so much more surprising.
00:57:45.838 - 00:57:46.034, Speaker A: Right.
00:57:46.072 - 00:57:54.046, Speaker C: Like, they bailed out block by among, I think, some other mean. Just to contrast the two major exchanges.
00:57:54.078 - 00:58:33.406, Speaker A: Playbooks. Well, he's. Yeah, he's clearly laying down a marker. Just I asked, said, you know, what role does binance have to play in not only reassuring the marketplace about its own position, and he said, the position is as strong as ever. I mean, he defended it, but also in just ensuring that another FTX couldn't take place. I mean, what role industry leaders play roles like this. They get together with other industry leaders and they say, look, for the good of the marketplace, we need to establish at least lines of communication.
00:58:33.406 - 00:58:36.690, Speaker A: We need. I mean, there's that send a clear signal to regulators.
00:58:37.190 - 00:58:38.900, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, the legendary text.
00:58:46.390 - 00:59:21.840, Speaker A: So that was going on. And then our colleague Taran wrote a story on binance admitting a lapse and maintaining its stablecoin reserves, which, again, is not exactly going to bolster confidence in the exchange at a time when things are really delicate. But, yeah, I guess it's one of those stay tuned type mean. He is. He is center stage right now.
00:59:23.990 - 00:59:34.660, Speaker C: Yeah. Binance is to. I'm not an expert at all, but just kind of the artful ambiguity about where they're headquartered. And binance, us.
00:59:35.830 - 00:59:51.786, Speaker A: Yeah, he spoke to that Owen. He said in the interview that he did on stage here. He said, look, we're a different model. We're not a traditional bank. There isn't any reason why we should have a headquarters. We're a remote organization. He told me about that.
00:59:51.786 - 01:00:29.110, Speaker A: He's like, our employees all work all over the world. We work remotely. That's how we operate. And if the old world is going to try and force us to be headquartered somewhere or do something like that, he definitely struck kind of a defiant note on that score. But at the same time, he strongly suggested that they are going to do whatever regulatory things are demanded of them, whether it's licensing and all of those things. So he's also trying to be conciliatory at the same time. Again, it's all kind of a moving target.
01:00:29.110 - 01:00:31.586, Speaker A: He remains very much a riddle.
01:00:31.698 - 01:00:32.360, Speaker C: Right.
01:00:33.770 - 01:00:39.254, Speaker A: And riddles breed uncertainty. Who knows?
01:00:39.382 - 01:00:40.700, Speaker C: He's made it this far.
01:00:42.190 - 01:01:19.910, Speaker A: Yeah. And I guess the upshot from a lot of, because his talk generated a lot of conversation around the conference and so forth. And the one thing people said, especially after SBF dropped that insane substac. When was that? Yesterday. Was that CZ clearly appears to be a far more able businessman in terms of actually running his company and keeping everything moving. And it has such complexity. I mean, at one point in his talk, he said that he deals with regulators from between 20 and 30 nations.
01:01:20.330 - 01:01:21.080, Speaker C: Crazy.
01:01:21.930 - 01:01:30.540, Speaker A: I mean, that's what multinationals like Exxon deal with. Yeah, but Exxon is a listed company.
01:01:31.150 - 01:01:31.900, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:01:34.110 - 01:01:58.082, Speaker A: So I don't know. I think the CZ story, the finance story is only going to intensify in the months to come. Cool. Well, listen, I think that's a good place to leave it. It was a crazy week. I hope you guys got some sleep writing all these stories. You guys cranked out so many this week.
01:01:58.082 - 01:02:36.334, Speaker A: And I would urge our viewers, our readers, to just take a tour through the site right now and just look at all of the great pieces that we've got up covering the news that we've discussed and lots of stuff we didn't even discuss today. Stories that we didn't even have time to get to. So with that, Alex, thank you so much. YYC Trader, thank you for your market insight. Owen, Fern, now hold the position out on the left coast and we'll see you guys next week.
01:02:36.532 - 01:02:38.414, Speaker C: All right, y'all. See you guys.
01:02:38.452 - 01:02:40.410, Speaker B: Take care. Bye.
