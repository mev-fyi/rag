00:00:00.330 - 00:00:05.338, Speaker A: Why are you passionate about the blockchain industry? Why are you passionate about decentralization?
00:00:05.514 - 00:00:52.106, Speaker B: Oh, for so many reasons. I think the number one reason is just like, having full transparency of what's happening with my stuff. Of course, you don't know what everybody. What's happening with everything else in the world, you know, entering a time where I have less and less trust for the information that's being presented to me. Just because of the pure and sheer level of divisiveness within our country and within the world these days. And being able to stare at something with just absolute fact and certainty of its accuracy is something maybe we take for granted within our lives, but is something we're not offered in any other aspect of our lives. Right? It's like you go take your car into the shop and they're pulling up on your screen and they're looking and you try to look at the screen like, oh, sorry, this is private.
00:00:52.106 - 00:00:58.330, Speaker B: What is in my service records that I'm not even allowed to see? There's something really powerful about all this information being on the blockchain.
