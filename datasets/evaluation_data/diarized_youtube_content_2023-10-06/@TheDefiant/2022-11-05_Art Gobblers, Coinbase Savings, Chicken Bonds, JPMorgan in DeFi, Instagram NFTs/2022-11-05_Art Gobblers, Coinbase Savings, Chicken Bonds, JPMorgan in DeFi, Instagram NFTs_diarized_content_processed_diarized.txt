00:00:23.530 - 00:00:42.600, Speaker A: Everyone to our third weekly recap. I'm Cami, the defiant founder and we have our print team of defiant writers here. I'll let you guys quickly introduce yourselves. Yeah, go for it.
00:00:45.290 - 00:00:49.160, Speaker B: Hey, guys, I'm Alex Gilbert. I'm a reporter at the Defiant, based in New York City.
00:00:50.050 - 00:00:54.270, Speaker C: I'm Owen, now based in San Francisco, also a reporter.
00:00:55.330 - 00:00:58.560, Speaker D: I'm YYC Trader. I'm head of news.
00:00:59.730 - 00:01:41.078, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay, and then before we start, thanks to Goldfinch for sponsoring our live show. We'll get to them later. So, yeah, let's get to it this week. Super interesting week in Defi. And mean, not such great news, but we had a review of the hacks that happened last month in October. And unfortunately, it was a record month of hacks with 760,000,000 of funds stolen in exploits.
00:01:41.078 - 00:02:48.930, Speaker A: That's according to Tech shield. Then markets were really active. We had a Fed decision and the US Monetary Authority had decided to hike rates for a fourth time with the benchmark interest rate getting to the highest since January of 2008, which is bad news for risk assets, which are starting to compete with just like regular old safe bank deposits. So we have a few Defi and crypto offerings trying to attract savers. Coinbase liquidity are a couple of them. On the NFT front, that sector remains active as always, even during the bear. This week's kind of turn to shine was the art gobblers collection.
00:02:48.930 - 00:03:49.270, Speaker A: And, yeah, lots of kind of controversies, like tons of trading volume that thing just started storing in the beginning of the week. And then some huge news with institutions coming to Defi. JP Morgan performed its live real FX like foreign currency transaction on the Polygon network. And Polygon has just been on fire recently. It just keeps announcing partnership after partnership. Besides this Morgan announcement, there was also an Instagram announcement with Instagram saying that it'll allow artists and creators to mint NFTs on the platform using the Polygon network. So those are the highlights.
00:03:49.270 - 00:03:58.700, Speaker A: But, yeah, let's start with the hacks. And Owen had a great overview with a story this week.
00:03:59.150 - 00:04:21.134, Speaker C: Right on. Thanks, Cammy. So, yes, as Cammy said, we saw a record 750,000,000 in exploits this October. People are calling it hacktober. I don't know if that's a good. That's probably not a good thing and maybe not the most original naming job, but it is what it is. So that happened.
00:04:21.134 - 00:05:35.880, Speaker C: And I had a very interesting conversation with the co founder of Zellek, which is a crypto security firm which has done some audits with Solana and Yuga and Sushiswap and, yeah, I mean, at a high level, it's just that as the space keeps, know what he told me was you're attracting more eyeballs, and there's a way in which if there's a $10 million hack and other people in the security space see that they're going to attract people. So there's almost kind of a compounding effect going on. As more people see these successful exploits, you're going to attract more people. And obviously, there's an arms race, so that'll also attract people beefing up their security budgets. I've been talking to people about, it seems like there are more audit firms stepping up and cryptosecurity efforts stepping up correspondingly to the hacks. But at least based on this month, the hackers are the. That's the headline news.
00:05:35.880 - 00:06:50.274, Speaker C: And I wrote in my article that I thought it was interesting that crypto is just like a freewheeling culture in a lot of ways, and Twitter is like such a crazy place, as we all know. But then you realize that there's a huge amount of money online, and these applications are very serious and arguably much more serious and mission critical than your average web two app, you know, and that's kind of what Steven said as well, was just like, yeah, you need to think about this in the same way you think about deploying software to airplanes or are, there's very real money on the line. So I think that contrast is interesting, and it's interesting in general with crypto, to watch crypto kind of try to grow up and become professional, get your Morgan's involved. But at the same point, what happens to kind of the fun rebel culture that kind of, I feel like, does characterize crypto so far. And maybe you've seen that with Apple. Like, back in the day, apple was kind of the bad boys fighting against IBM, and now crypto is maybe in that kind of intermediate stage. Hopefully, you can keep kind of the punk rock thing alive.
00:06:50.274 - 00:07:44.386, Speaker C: But as the hacks have kind of shown us, also very, it's a very serious industry. And yeah, the stakes are very high. So also kind of contributing to, I guess, November's hacks numbers. We had a cross chain bridge provider, P Network. They minted, I think it was a billion of P gala tokens and offloading them on Pancakeswap, which is an exchange on the BNB chain. And it was confusing because, and this wasn't my story, so I'm not super up on it, but that the P gala tokens aren't actually minted by the gala team, they're minted by pnetwork. And so there was kind of a miscommunication.
00:07:44.386 - 00:08:25.718, Speaker C: Know, how are these tokens kind of coming out of nowhere? And so pnetwork has said it was a misunderstanding. So maybe the takeaway is. Okay, cool. You have all these people building these products like they're building a bridge so you can have your token on another chain, but they're doing their own thing and they're not necessarily in close communication with the gala team. So another issue that we've had trying to connect all these blockchains and we've seen that happen before, and then other exploit was derabit. They lost 28 million in an exploit attacking their hot wallet. And I believe they said all their users will be made whole.
00:08:25.718 - 00:08:33.960, Speaker C: But that was kind of just yet another exploit in the wild west that is crypto. So we'll see where we go.
00:08:35.450 - 00:09:51.360, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like we had just done this hacked over story and then we get these two additional hacks or exploits this week. I think you very well said, Owen, on the fact that DeFi started as this just like very experimental alternative financial system, but now kind of the amounts at stake are becoming serious. I mean, they have been for a while with hundreds of millions and even billions in some of these DeFi protocols. So yeah, there is a balance to strike between the cipher punk and on and permissionless culture and just like making it safe for users, which should come first. Okay, let's shift gears to NFT land. And like I mentioned before, art gobblers was kind of the main kind of news. This.
00:09:51.360 - 00:10:25.260, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe YYC can give us the latest on what happened because I think it started off really promising, but now things don't look very good. And actually it was Alex who first reported this story. So, yeah, maybe. Maybe you guys can both kind of guide us through what happened here.
00:10:26.750 - 00:10:30.000, Speaker D: Sure. Thanks, Cammy. Alex, you want to get started?
00:10:31.730 - 00:11:18.160, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So art Gobblers is a collaboration between venture capital firm Paradigm, which is focused on crypto, but more notably for most people, probably the co creator of the Rick and Morty TV series, which I'm a big fan of, most of my friends adore. And it's an interesting collection. It's not a PFP collection. It's a tool that allows people to create one off NFTs. And it debuted on Monday and just like burst out the gate. I mean, within hours it was already.
00:11:18.160 - 00:12:06.540, Speaker B: Monday was October 31. Within hours it was already one of the most traded collections in the month of October and the floor price shot up as people were trading it on secondary markets. At the time that I had written that story, they were going for, if I remember correctly, like $20,000 a pop, something like that. Which part of it? This is unique. I'd never heard of anything like this before. It's a different kind of NFT collection, but also, obviously piggybacking off the star power of the co creator, Justin Roiland of Rick and Morty fame. But why? So do you want to take it from there? I mean, you're more up to speed on everything that's happened since then.
00:12:07.890 - 00:12:23.886, Speaker D: Sure. Yeah. So, yeah, very interesting project. A lot of interesting mechanics. Basically, what the gobblers allow you to do is if you hold one, it generates goo tokens. Right. Because naturally.
00:12:23.886 - 00:13:04.170, Speaker D: And what you can also do is draw your own art using the platform and then use the tokens to basically mint your own art and display it in your gobbler's, well, belly gallery, as they call it. So that's the blank space in the middle of each gobbler. So that can be filled with art. Right. And, yeah, this diagram basically shows you the goblet economy and what it's supposed to be. So this project has been hyped for months and it's been very difficult to get on the whitelist. I mean, it was a free mint.
00:13:04.170 - 00:14:14.662, Speaker D: Right. And it immediately shot up to 15 E. The first sales that happened were in that 1516 e range and it just took off from there. And one criticism that the project faced was that because it was so hard to get on the whitelist, for one, a lot of spots were given out to influencers in the space, prominent collectors, people with large followings on social media, et cetera, and they didn't really have to work to get on the whitelist like the other members of the community did, like winning competitions or like submitting artwork or et cetera. And this was basically just people who were handpicked by the team to probably give the project more exposure, obviously, because these people have a huge reach and what they do influences the space. Yeah. And a lot of them ended up selling their NFTs as soon as they minted them, like literally within minutes, we were looking at the sales feed and we saw all the influencer names popping across the screen.
00:14:14.662 - 00:15:04.274, Speaker D: One by one, we had prank C K money. There were a few more. And that kind of sparked, I wouldn't say outrage, because I think a lot of people were mainly coping that they didn't get on the whitelist. Themselves and who doesn't want a free 15 E, right. But in the days that followed, it sparked a wider debate over is it a fair process or are we kind of moving back towards the web two model where the people at the top who already kind of established themselves in the space and are already wealthy because they got in on NFTs early, just end up getting richer. Right. Because new projects want them to give their projects exposure.
00:15:04.274 - 00:15:45.314, Speaker D: And so if this model continues, what happens to the rest of us? Right? That's the question. Until now, most projects have been doing these pre mint raffles, which are completely random. Right. So at least it gives that element of fairness. Not to say that they don't give spots out to influencers, because that's just the nature of the game. But I think this is the first time that a project was very hard to get into for regular users, but influencers got in like a free ride. So that's been a criticism of the project.
00:15:45.314 - 00:16:07.850, Speaker D: In terms of the floor. Yeah, the volumes have gone absolutely insane. It did almost 40,000 E in volume. That's nearly $60 million in just four days. Right. And the floor price briefly went up above 20 E. It hit 24, 25 ETH on openc just two days ago.
00:16:07.850 - 00:16:49.240, Speaker D: And yesterday there was a huge wave of selling and it was cut in half. As we've seen many times with these very hyped launches, the insane pump just can't be sustained because eventually you run out of buyers willing to pay 25, 26, 30 for these NFTs. Right. And yeah, there's another controversy regarding the founder and some previous stuff he might have done, but we haven't had a chance to reach out to them for comments, so I'd rather not speculate on that. But, yeah, you can find it all over Twitter if you're interested.
00:16:50.730 - 00:17:00.474, Speaker C: What do you guys think of. I don't know, do you think this is another kind of flash in the pan NFT project or are we going to be talking about art gobblers in like a year?
00:17:00.672 - 00:17:02.300, Speaker D: It's paradigm, man.
00:17:03.470 - 00:17:04.502, Speaker C: It is paradigm.
00:17:04.566 - 00:17:16.910, Speaker D: I mean, at this price, it's out of my budget, but if it comes down to, I don't know, two, three e, maybe it would be worth a gamble.
00:17:17.250 - 00:17:17.950, Speaker C: Sure.
00:17:18.100 - 00:17:37.880, Speaker D: Because these are mechanics that no one's kind of done before. Right. And it does have the pedigree of a known artist, et cetera. And, yeah, it'll be interesting to see how this whole creating art and kind of displaying it within the NFT is going to play out.
00:17:39.050 - 00:17:55.420, Speaker A: So. Sorry, this mechanism is. It that each NFT holder can intervene or interfere in how their piece looks.
00:17:55.870 - 00:18:10.830, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. So you use those tokens that you get to kind of. That's the ecosystem token, I guess. So you'd, like, burn those tokens in exchange for putting your art into your nFt.
00:18:11.910 - 00:18:14.910, Speaker A: What's the token doing? What's the name of the token?
00:18:15.070 - 00:18:17.620, Speaker D: It's goo. G o o.
00:18:18.390 - 00:18:31.000, Speaker A: Let's see how it's done. Yeah, I think that's a pretty cool idea. And they look pretty cute, but to be honest, I wouldn't pay ten e for that.
00:18:32.090 - 00:18:35.340, Speaker D: It isn't this one. It's the second one on the list when you search.
00:18:35.870 - 00:18:37.814, Speaker A: Okay, that's confusing.
00:18:37.862 - 00:18:40.300, Speaker C: First, they're going to be like, tokens already.
00:18:41.790 - 00:18:56.320, Speaker A: That's not good. Okay, let's see. Max. What? Just like one big red candle. All right, well, super volatile, obviously.
00:18:57.090 - 00:19:27.960, Speaker D: Yeah, and it's highly inflationary. Each gobbler emits like a ton of goo. This price action is to be expected at launch, but the mechanics to burn the token and actually put it to use, I guess haven't been used yet because I'm not sure if people can already do the whole glamination process, as they call it. So I'm not sure if that lie yet.
00:19:29.310 - 00:19:43.040, Speaker B: Do you think that this inflationary mechanism, is this meant to discourage speculative trading and make it more about the art? What's the idea there?
00:19:45.810 - 00:19:55.780, Speaker C: I think you just need a deflationary mechanic, right? The more the better in a way. If it's all inflationary, the thing won't hold value. Would be my.
00:19:56.870 - 00:20:45.022, Speaker A: I think if you're already introducing a token, this is obviously not the defiant opinion, but my own. And it just seems like you're calling for speculation. I don't know if there's like an actual technical reason that you would need a token for this NFT collection. Right? I don't know. And adding this kind of like, burn mechanism, you're hoping to create some sort of, I think, pressure for the token to increase in price down the line. But interesting, for sure. At least there is some innovation here.
00:20:45.022 - 00:20:56.262, Speaker A: And like was saying, it does have this pedigree of the Rick and morty artists, and these guys are pretty. So anyways, we'll see how they do.
00:20:56.316 - 00:20:57.302, Speaker B: That's what it's about.
00:20:57.436 - 00:21:42.040, Speaker A: Yeah, it's all about the art. All right. Okay, let's move on from kind of the cutest story of the week to the most serious story of the week, the JP Morgan announcement. I think this is really exciting. We might have the. I'm blanking on his Ty Lovin on the defiant podcast soon, so stay tuned for that. He'll give us all the details on this story.
00:21:42.040 - 00:21:53.160, Speaker A: But, yeah, I think this was your story.
00:21:56.410 - 00:22:57.834, Speaker D: Oh, sure. Yeah. So this was, I mean, big news because Morgan Chase is the biggest US bank with nearly 3 trillion in assets, and the CEO has been an outspoken critic of crypto. Right? He's been panning bitcoin since 2013, and just last month, he called crypto tokens decentralized ponzies. Of course, it wasn't JPMorgan, the bank itself. It was its digital asset unit called Onyx. And what they did was part of the MAS, that's the monetary authority of Singapore, which is the central bank of that city state, is running a pilot initiative to basically test out Defi for institutions to see if Defi mechanisms can be used at scale to improve transaction times, cut costs, et cetera.
00:22:57.834 - 00:24:15.558, Speaker D: Right. And so this pilot project was done by the Onyx unit, DBS bank, and another institution, a japanese institution called SBI Digital Asset holdings. So what they did was they conducted a live foreign exchange swap on the Polygon blockchain. And what they did was they deployed a customized version of AAveARC, which is the lending protocol's permissioned version for institutions, and it requires KYC and AML procedures and the whole compliance process that institutions have to follow. So what they did was they created tokenized versions of the Singapore dollar and the japanese yen, and then they did these test swaps on Polygon, which went through successfully. I mean, they weren't very big transactions, but the proof of concept has been proven. So to mean, we know that DeFi is more efficient, faster and more trustworthy than the centralized financial system, but they don't know it yet.
00:24:15.558 - 00:24:18.150, Speaker D: So I guess they're finding out slowly.
00:24:19.290 - 00:24:21.190, Speaker A: How big were the transactions?
00:24:23.530 - 00:24:29.500, Speaker D: Not exactly sure. If you click on the links in the article, you can find the transactions themselves.
00:24:30.430 - 00:24:31.226, Speaker A: Okay.
00:24:31.408 - 00:24:42.560, Speaker C: And not to put you on the spot while I see, but when you say swap, what does that mean in the context of a lending protocol, what do we mean?
00:24:43.010 - 00:25:06.998, Speaker D: So I'm not sure what they did exactly with Aave because they didn't use it for this transaction. I don't think so. This transaction, they just swapped Singapore dollars for japanese yen on the chain. Right. And that's huge, because forex as a market is one of the biggest trading markets in the world, if not the biggest, like trillions of volume change hands every day.
00:25:07.164 - 00:25:33.280, Speaker B: There was a presentation I attended at Devcon where I forget what it was about, but I remember the speaker opening with a chart that showed the different financial markets. And it was like, when we can tap forex and it's like pointing to just the bar is dwarfing everything else, but in order of magnitude, the biggest trading opportunity.
00:25:34.690 - 00:26:00.070, Speaker D: Yeah. And it's an industry that's ripe for disruption because in most countries, trading forex for retail is very difficult. Like, if you're holding foreign currency and you want to change it for something else, you got to go to these exchange houses or banks are going to rip you off. They'll charge you like a 5% spread and smile and send you on your way. But you go to the exchange house, they're still going to take 2% or so. Right. Which is ridiculous.
00:26:00.070 - 00:26:24.720, Speaker D: And sadly, it's mostly low income folks who get affected by this the most because they're like remitting money globally, right? Because they're working everywhere and want to send money home and they get gouged the most in fees, et cetera. So if we can bring easy access to forex on chain, that's really going to be a game changer, I think.
00:26:25.650 - 00:27:27.102, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think cross border transactions are definitely the least kind of efficient areas in traditional finance because they require the most intermediaries for them to work. Like just transferring between banks in two countries require so many steps in between and, I don't know, take three business days to do and tons of fees. So, yeah, I totally agree. It's so ripe for disruption. Defi, like just blockchain infrastructure can make these transactions happen in seconds. And, well, if you're using polygon or like layer two or cheaper blockchains, a lot lower fees than in traditional finance.
00:27:27.102 - 00:28:27.990, Speaker A: So, yeah, this is super encouraging. I'm not sure either how Ave was used specifically, but it has to do with the fact that these banks want some level of KYC and permissioning involved. So I think what Ave does is that it KYcs all the participants in these pools. So that Morgan, when they did this transaction, if they used these liquidity pools, they probably did it because they wanted to know who their counterparty was. They didn't want to be just trading against some random wallet. They wanted the entire transaction to be just verified.
00:28:29.690 - 00:28:48.830, Speaker D: Yeah, they use these things called verified credentials from the Internet consortium. Basically. It's called w three C, I believe. Yeah. So this is basically the body that sets standards for the Internet. Right. And so these are these credentials that they issue.
00:28:48.830 - 00:29:02.002, Speaker D: I'm not sure of the exact details of how they work, but according to the team at Onyx, this can be used for on chain identity basically. And that's what they did.
00:29:02.136 - 00:29:54.900, Speaker A: Yeah, it's super interesting here. We reported that there's institutions like hundreds of institutions that are being whitelisted to use this ave arc system. So maybe this is a way to get bigger banks just more comfortable using blockchain as. So again, super, super promising. And I can't wait to interview Ty so we get more details on exactly how this transaction happened. And also I wonder if it was just a test or if it was something that they actually had to do for some business reason. I would guess it was a test.
00:29:56.710 - 00:30:59.542, Speaker D: Yeah, they call it a pilot program, but given the success, I don't see why they won't move on. They plan to use different blockchains and stuff as they move ahead in later phases. And I mean, honestly, the reason we're still stuck on this 50 year old swift system is because there's no incentive to change it, right? Because every correspondent bank in the chain gets to collect 1015 euros to pass a transaction along without doing anything. So why would they want to change the system? And it's just the users or the bank account holders who suffer because we have to wait a week for the wire transfer to clear and we get like $50 less than we sent. So until now we didn't have a choice. But now with stable coins, I mean, I haven't sent to wire transfer in probably two years now because I just send. And like, I convince the person on the other end, even if they haven't heard of it, I send them tutorials from the defiant and say, what is USDC? What is this? That? And then convince them to take, yeah, yeah.
00:30:59.596 - 00:31:39.118, Speaker A: It's so much mean. You'd guess that banks are incentivized anyways, right? Because it's cheaper for them. Or I guess they do pass most of the costs along to users. But I think the thinking should still be in JP Morgan's case. If we don't do it, somebody else will. There will be some competitor who takes advantage of this and is able to offer cross border transactions at a lot cheaper. So if you want to be competitive, I think it pays.
00:31:39.294 - 00:31:48.520, Speaker B: Assuming there's no backroom cartel, then capitalism should win the day. Competition should lead to better outcomes for consumers, right?
00:31:49.450 - 00:32:40.920, Speaker A: I think in the end there's only so much coordination you can do when you have so much money on the line. So many participants. There's hundreds of banks out there. So I would find it hard to believe that none of them would break and say, okay, actually, you know what I'm going to do something that is going to drive a lot more business to me. So, yeah, I'm optimistic that free markets win in the end. But Alex, let's move on to some of the other announcements that happened on Polygon, if you want to talk about this Instagram deal.
00:32:41.370 - 00:34:11.278, Speaker B: Yeah, Polygon has been on a roll just like left and right, trying to tie their product into the real world. And maybe Instagram isn't the best example of the real world, but I mean, nevertheless, this is a really big opportunity to onboard folks to crypto and web three. So essentially, Instagram announced that it would begin allowing users to mint and sell NFTs through Polygon. Right? We had spoken recently about what happened when Reddit allowed users to start dabbling in NFTs and a huge number of wallets were created. I mean, Opensea saw some of its best business all year, even though the NFT market has otherwise completely collapsed. Right? So with 1 billion active monthly users on Instagram, the Polygon co founder, he's not wrong when he says this is a huge onboarding opportunity to, I think his words were championing verifiable digital is this is the way that you get folks to interact with the technology to learn about its use cases and what it can do for them. It's debuting in the United States.
00:34:11.278 - 00:35:19.122, Speaker B: First, Instagram is going to launch a toolkit to help people make their NFTs on the platform. But Instagram has been clear that it plans on launching on other blockchains in the future. It just didn't say exactly which ones or give a timeline for this. But then, in other Polygon news, this is more into the real world use case discussion. They're letting students at the National University of Mongolia receive their diplomas as know somebody might wonder, well, don't they just get to then sell it to the highest bidder, which would be a debacle if possible. No, they're going to be soul bound tokens, so they're non transferable, they're not financial instruments the way a lot of other NFTs are. Part of the idea here is that it's going to fight the scourge of fake diplomas.
00:35:19.122 - 00:36:43.430, Speaker B: I mean, it's obviously that's an issue, right? When you're hiring somebody, you want to know whether they actually have the knowledge that they claim to have. And Polygon said that it plans on collaborating with more universities in the country in the near future. So that'll be a really interesting test case because there is a clearly stated real world rationale for pursuing this, and I imagine that it'll be fairly easy to see whether this has actually worked as intended. However, they're able to measure the proliferation and use of bogus diplomas. It'll be interesting to see whether it really cuts down on that, whether students from this university who are now receiving these diploma NFTs have some kind of leg up. Because when somebody says, hey, I graduated from the National University of Mongolia after this year, here's the proof, people can take that to the bank. So to know this comes on the heels of it, I'm not too familiar with this earlier example, but fairly recently Polygon announced some kind of collaboration with a police department in India.
00:36:43.430 - 00:37:14.670, Speaker B: I didn't cover that, I'm not too familiar with the details of that. But that's just another example of this whole suite of integrations that they've been debuting. You can see how folks are reacting to this news in the markets. And just in the past week, the value of Polygon's native token Matic has gone up 25% almost, which is just crazy. It's higher than any other token.
00:37:16.530 - 00:37:16.846, Speaker D: In.
00:37:16.868 - 00:37:26.660, Speaker B: The top 20 other than funnelly dogecoin in the past seven days. Yeah, just really interesting stuff.
00:37:29.670 - 00:38:35.180, Speaker A: Yeah. And again, kind of shilling the podcast here, but it just happens that we have really great guests recently, but we do have Hansa Khan, he's the head of Defi at Polygon in next week's podcast, and he goes through all these integrations. And I thought it was interesting that they have just like a very pragmatic approach to onboarding users. And it shows. He was like, if we keep building for crypto natives, this thing is never going to take off. This thing being crypto blockchain tech, he's like, we need to go where the billions of users are. And so, yeah, it just shows with their strategy going to all the big web, two tradfi names out there.
00:38:35.180 - 00:39:45.710, Speaker A: Before we continue with, I think, some of the most interesting stories this week with markets and what happened with rates and how Defi is competing. As I said earlier in the podcast, we have a great sponsor, Goldfinch. So let's hear more about them, stick around and also just hear what they have to say, because it's just a great platform. Olfin is a decentralized credit protocol with a mission to connect the world's capital to the world's growth with yields from real world lending and loans collateralized by real world assets. The protocol has announced Goldfinch membership empowering Goldfinch investors and aligning the protocol's participants with the network's long term success.

We publish daily, and so you can just get all these news in your inbox and subscribe to our YouTube channel where we are also covering the biggest stories daily. And now. Yeah, let's get to markets today.
00:40:34.110 - 00:40:46.386, Speaker A: This week was a big week in markets, with the Fed hiking rates for a fourth consecutive time. So, Owen, what happened?
00:40:46.568 - 00:41:16.742, Speaker C: Rock and roll. Okay, so as most of us may know, or some of us, so the Federal Reserve hiked rates 75 basis points for the fourth straight meeting, and markets didn't react terribly. Nothing tanked. And as we've seen today, bitcoin up 2.4, ETH up 4.9 and BNB up 6.8. Markets haven't really been deterred by the most recent rate hike.
00:41:16.742 - 00:42:43.990, Speaker C: And so kind of the story I spent a couple of days writing this week was exploring, what does this mean now that rates are about at 4%? I think treasuries are up at 3.5% for the short term treasury bills, which is much higher than the rates you can get on stablecoins on Ave and just lend, which is on Tron and compound. Just trying to explain, how does Defi exist in that world where the safest rates in DeFi are actually below the safest rates in tradfi, which was not the case. And Defi's main quote, unquote, use case, you could say, were the crazy yields that personified or characterized 2021. So, yeah, I had a couple of interviews with some fixed yield protocols, and it seemed like the general consensus was that there just isn't yet a great connection between DeFi and Tradfi, which we were kind of already talking about. I mean, bank to bank transactions have their own friction, and as does defi to Tradfi. So you're just not necessarily seeing huge amounts of extremely mercenary capital, leaving DFI for Tradfi to take advantage of these rates.
00:42:43.990 - 00:43:35.190, Speaker C: That said, USDC has dropped at least 10 billion. I could find the stat in the past three or four months, and Teddy Woodward of Notional attributed that to the rising disparity in rates. So basically, at a high level. It seemed like it's a mixed bag. Like some people are chasing those higher yields in Tradfi, but there's also a lot of sticky capital in DeFi that doesn't really want to move anywhere. So, yeah, that was kind of my main conclusion, is that it's a very mixed bag. And if rates continue to rise, at some point, people will eventually move their capital over.
00:43:35.190 - 00:44:12.230, Speaker C: But for now, it seems like it's just like a magnet, right? And as rates get higher, it's going to be a stronger and stronger magnet. For now, it's somewhat strong, but not as strong as it could be. So that's the basic idea. I mean, that's what I got from talking to people. And I thought it was interesting, Alan, with yield protocol, thought that both of them didn't really seem intimidated by the high rates. They weren't like, oh, DeFi is screwed because rates are getting higher. They thought that fundamentally, DeFi isn't about offering these crazy yields, because at some point they're going to be arbitraged away.
00:44:12.230 - 00:44:51.922, Speaker C: And yields like low risk yields in tradfi and low risk yields in DeFi should about even out. So the true advantages of Defi aren't necessarily going to exist. It's not going to be about these baseline yields. So that was my main conclusion for that article. I mean, more to come. I think it's very interesting, and there might be some people who push back on what my interviewees said, but that was my conclusion. And then moving on Coinbase, I think this wasn't my story, but they announced 1.5
00:44:51.922 - 00:45:40.020, Speaker C: APY on USDC, which was kind of in line with what my previous story was exploring, which is like, why are people want that 1.5 APY when they could get maybe up to three on savings right now, thanks to interest rates? So that was another thing we were exploring and wondering what the advantage is here. But as we covered two weeks ago, Makerdao did announce, or they did allow Coinbase to custody 1.6 billion of USDC to earn that 1.5% yield. So I'm not super well versed on why they chose to earn that 1.5 when maybe they could have earned more, but I'm sure there are logistical reasons for that.
00:45:40.020 - 00:46:50.582, Speaker C: And then plowing on, we got one thing that was interesting, which I think we have covered pretty extensively, but chicken bonds are a new mechanism from liquidy, which has been interesting. I mean, they've been getting real excitement and use from people generally, particularly Sifu, who was part of the Quadriga CX exchange. And it came out that he was also involved in DeFi, but he's a big fan of this project. And the basic idea is that you can bond your LUSD, which is liquite's stablecoin, and you're getting in, so doing, you're getting a boosted return on that LUSD. And it's basically a higher return than the normal LUSD. And they do that by kind of compounding, by kind of optimizing in ways that users wouldn't otherwise be able to do. And that is kind of a progressive process.
00:46:50.582 - 00:47:51.190, Speaker C: And then users can either decide to kind of take that extra yield as it progresses, and they can either take that or they can quote unquote chicken out, which is when they take their original LUSD out. So little confusing. But at a high level, it's a way where it seems like it's a pretty clean mechanism where users get something and the protocol get something in that the protocol actually gets some of the LUSD in the form of protocol owned liquidity, which helps them deepen the peg or deepen liquidity for their stablecoin, which allows the stablecoin to trade closer to one dollars. Because right now it's above because people want to hold LUSD because it is very decentralized. And users get that extra boosted yield, which they couldn't otherwise. So it's interesting to see another mechanism exploring protocol owned liquidity, which was kind of a big part of DFI 2.0, whatever you want to think of that trend.
00:47:51.190 - 00:48:13.010, Speaker C: So I thought it was interesting that they're reawakening that protocol owned liquidity and that that is still something that protocols definitely want. And I think maybe the mechanisms that Olympus Dow had weren't the best, but we're seeing continued demand for projects to figure out ways to own their own tokens, or at least stable coins.
00:48:13.430 - 00:49:14.454, Speaker A: Yeah, it's such an interesting mechanism. And if you guys want to see more or like the story in video form, we did cover this in the channel today, so. Not today. When was it? One day ago yesterday. Alex did this video on Defi yields and chicken bonds. But super interesting stuff, I think this point that you got from interviewees, Owen, about there kind of not being such efficiencies between DeFi and tradfi, and so yields not really spilling over or there doesn't seem to be such a straightforward arbitrage between tradfi yields and Defi yields is an interesting point. I don't think that's sustainable right.
00:49:14.454 - 00:50:22.090, Speaker A: In the long term, you would expect there to be some just like more market efficiencies and arbitrage happening. And in that case, because DeFi is riskier, traders, investors, they're going to start demanding higher yields to stay in DeFi for sure. Maybe that's not something that's happening right now, but I think it'll definitely happen in the future. I think maybe the more direct impact for rising rates is not that people are doing this kind of math. Like, okay, I'm taking out my maker, Dow deposit or whatever lending protocol deposit, and putting it, like exchanging my USDC to US dollars and putting them in my bank. People are not doing that because it's like, once you're in crypto, I think maybe you just stay there. But I think the more direct link is more like, wow, everything's tanking.
00:50:22.090 - 00:50:42.660, Speaker A: Just like risk assets are tanking because of the Fed and central banks are raising rates. So that's kind of what's driving people to get out of crypto. Not necessarily kind of this rate math, maybe, I don't know. But, yeah, really interesting.
00:50:43.670 - 00:51:01.080, Speaker C: It'd be interesting just to see. Yeah, I mean, there's just a lot more to dig into about USDC supply is going down, but USDT supply isn't. And so it would be interesting to find out what's making people stay and what makes people be. It'd be interesting to try to contact some of those.
00:51:01.850 - 00:52:13.630, Speaker A: Yeah, and definitely something to look into. Just comparing how supply for the different stablecoins is moving. And if it's true that USDT is holding up better than USDC, why might that be? I know we've reported that USDC was hit because of the tornado cash aftermath. The fact that they were just rushed to comply and ban a bunch of wallets, I don't know. USDT did the same, but yeah, interesting mechanics happening, for sure. Somebody from comments is saying we should talk about the co founder of Makerdao. That story we debated whether to get into, we thought it was a bit kind of removed from just our core defi and just like super speculative, but yeah, unfortunately, Makerdao co founder was founded Nikolai Mushi.
00:52:13.630 - 00:53:06.030, Speaker A: I'm not going to be pronouncing his name right. Mushigan Mushigian. Sorry. And there was just like a lot of speculation around his death. I think kind of the broader point we can make and that we should be highlighting is his contribution to Defi and the space he co founded, the biggest effect protocol he went on to work on. Rye, I believe, and other kind of really interesting and notable projects balancer. He was also part of so huge loss for the ecosystem.
00:53:06.030 - 00:53:50.926, Speaker A: Hopefully we get more kind of answers on exactly what. Yeah, I mean, starting to wrap up, there were a couple of other notable stories this week, also a bit controversial. Andre Krany is maybe back, maybe not. Who knows with him? Like, he's been in and out of Defi and crypto so many. You know, he tweeted, like, something like, here we go again, or something like that. He updated his LinkedIn profile. You guys should know.
00:53:50.926 - 00:54:38.094, Speaker A: He's like this serial Defi founder who he was heralded as this hero when he first got into the space with Yern. He's the one who started yearn finance. He basically kick started this whole valueless token trend that happened. When was that? Was that last year or the previous year? I don't know. I'm getting things mixed up. But he was like a huge part of Defi summer and known for testing and prod. He spearheaded so many different projects that then kind of were really hyped and then fizzled out.
00:54:38.094 - 00:55:36.634, Speaker A: So he doesn't have the best reputation. I think he's very polarizing in Defi. So, anyways, we'll keep an eye on what he's up to and what project he launches next. I'm sure it'll come with lots of hype as everything he does. And then another interesting story to look at is this story by Sam, which looks at what would have happened if Sailor had bought ETH instead of bitcoin. I mean, you all know kind of this laser eyed guy, the microstrategy CEO, Michael Saylor. He's been kind of this, like, I don't know, like the leader of the bitcoiners.
00:55:36.634 - 00:56:20.080, Speaker A: And it was interesting to see this analysis that says that if he would have bought ETH instead of bitcoin, he would have come out ahead. Anyways, just check out this story. It's pretty interesting. And, yeah, I think that wraps it up. Anything else you guys want to add that we might be missing that happened this week?
00:56:20.850 - 00:56:34.222, Speaker C: I'll say. Just that the defiant is at ETH sf this week. I think Diego, our community lead, is there today, and I may be there either today or tomorrow. So come say what's up. We'll be wearing shirts.
00:56:34.366 - 00:56:58.700, Speaker A: Yay. Yeah. Come meet defiant team in person. All right. Yeah. I think that wraps up another interesting week in Defi. As always, we really hope that we helped you all stay up to date in this interesting, crazy, fascinating corner of finance and tech.
