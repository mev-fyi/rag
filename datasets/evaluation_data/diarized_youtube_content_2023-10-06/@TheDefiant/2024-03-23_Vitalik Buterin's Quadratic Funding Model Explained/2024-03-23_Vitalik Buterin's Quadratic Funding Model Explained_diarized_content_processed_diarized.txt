00:00:00.090 - 00:00:01.982, Speaker A: So quadratic funding is basically a way.
00:00:02.036 - 00:00:16.398, Speaker B: Of running a crowdfunding campaign that as democratic as possible. So basically the key idea with quadratic funding is that you set out a matching pool and you allow people to.
00:00:16.564 - 00:00:19.498, Speaker C: Sign up for a crowdfunding campaign.
00:00:19.674 - 00:00:28.210, Speaker B: And when they contribute to that crowdfunding campaign, then their contributions are matched by funds from the matching pool.
00:00:28.290 - 00:00:30.194, Speaker A: And the cool thing about quadratic funding.
00:00:30.242 - 00:00:35.206, Speaker B: And this is all credit to Glenn and Vitalik for inventing this, is that the matching is based off of the.
00:00:35.228 - 00:00:37.734, Speaker C: Number of contributors, not the amount that they fund.
00:00:37.852 - 00:00:39.906, Speaker B: So Cammy, if you have a grant.
00:00:39.938 - 00:00:45.962, Speaker C: That raises $100 from 100 contributors and I have a grant that raises $100.
00:00:46.016 - 00:00:47.994, Speaker B: From one contributor, then you get 99%.
00:00:48.032 - 00:00:48.854, Speaker C: Of the matching pool.
00:00:48.902 - 00:00:51.194, Speaker B: Okay, so we're allocating capital to things.
00:00:51.232 - 00:00:55.198, Speaker C: That the broadest swaths of the Ethereum community care about.
00:00:55.284 - 00:01:04.334, Speaker B: And that's really powerful because if you're not a whale, if you're just an everyday person, then it's easy to feel like your vote doesn't really matter. But with quadratic funding it does.
00:01:04.372 - 00:01:09.570, Speaker C: You can give a dollar and the project can get hundreds of dollars depending on how many other people are contributing to it.
00:01:09.640 - 00:01:11.410, Speaker A: So quadratic funding is this really amazing.
00:01:11.480 - 00:01:15.394, Speaker C: Way of taking people who are in the outer orbit of your community and.
00:01:15.432 - 00:01:18.766, Speaker B: Giving them a say in how things are funded.
00:01:18.878 - 00:01:20.434, Speaker A: So that's quadratic funding.
00:01:20.482 - 00:01:21.686, Speaker B: It's one of the things that is.
00:01:21.708 - 00:01:26.706, Speaker C: On Gitcoin's menu during Gitcoin 2.0, but it's not the only thing that's on the menu.
00:01:26.818 - 00:01:32.154, Speaker B: Another thing that the Ethereum ecosystem has really rallied around over the last twelve.
00:01:32.192 - 00:01:34.682, Speaker C: Months is this thing called retroactive public.
00:01:34.736 - 00:01:39.766, Speaker B: Goods funding and retroactive public goods funding. The basic idea here is that it's.
00:01:39.798 - 00:01:41.920, Speaker C: Easier to understand if something.
00:01:44.290 - 00:01:47.882, Speaker B: Is a good public good in retrospect as opposed.
00:01:47.946 - 00:01:49.760, Speaker C: To in the future.
00:01:50.210 - 00:01:58.194, Speaker B: This has been pioneered by optimism. They've been running retro PGF rounds for the last year and a half, giving out tens of millions of dollars to.
00:01:58.232 - 00:02:07.590, Speaker C: Their community based off of who's building their ecosystems, public goods consuming block space, creating sequencers, creating liquidity on the optimism l two.
00:02:07.740 - 00:02:15.478, Speaker B: And basically the way that works is that they have a role in their ecosystem called the badge holder. It's basically just someone who is in.
00:02:15.484 - 00:02:19.194, Speaker C: The optimism ecosystem that is able to.
00:02:19.232 - 00:02:26.202, Speaker B: Allocate that capital to people in the ecosystem that have provided public goods in the past.
00:02:26.256 - 00:02:28.890, Speaker C: So it's a retroactive public goods funding round.
00:02:31.250 - 00:02:33.486, Speaker A: Gitcoin now supports both quadratic funding and.
00:02:33.508 - 00:02:40.554, Speaker B: Retroactive public goods funding. And that's sort of our menu of what we can offer to any EVM.
00:02:40.602 - 00:02:44.830, Speaker C: Based community that wants to fund their ecosystem's public goods.
00:02:45.490 - 00:02:48.306, Speaker B: And then I guess the third thing that I'll just mention real quick is.
00:02:48.328 - 00:02:50.478, Speaker C: That we also have a product called direct grants.
00:02:50.574 - 00:02:51.506, Speaker B: Say you don't want to do any.
00:02:51.528 - 00:02:55.198, Speaker C: Of this complicated quadratic funding or retroactive public goods funding.
00:02:55.294 - 00:02:57.118, Speaker B: You can use Gitcoin grant stack to.
00:02:57.144 - 00:02:59.206, Speaker C: Just do regular grants where you have.
00:02:59.228 - 00:03:02.294, Speaker B: A centralized grant administrator who is giving.
00:03:02.332 - 00:03:06.866, Speaker C: Out a pool of capital from your ecosystem's treasury to projects in the ecosystem.
00:03:06.978 - 00:03:11.602, Speaker B: That are building your ecosystem. So you can kind of think of gitcoin 2.0 as a menu.
00:03:11.666 - 00:03:15.330, Speaker C: Direct grants or quadratic funding or retroactive public goods funding.
00:03:15.410 - 00:03:18.934, Speaker B: Each of those things is good at doing one thing and doing it well.
00:03:18.972 - 00:03:20.718, Speaker C: Direct grants is good because it's simple.
00:03:20.804 - 00:03:31.340, Speaker B: Quadritic funding is really good at democratic capital allocation, and then retroactive public goods funding is really good at retroactively allocating capital. So.
