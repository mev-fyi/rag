00:00:03.370 - 00:00:18.560, Speaker A: All right. Okay. We're here with Vansa, the CEO of Ethereum scaling solution OMG, formerly known as Omisei. Go, Vansa. It's so great to have you. Thank you so much for joining me.
00:00:19.410 - 00:00:21.678, Speaker B: Thank you for having me. Excited to be here.
00:00:21.764 - 00:01:12.130, Speaker A: Of course, yeah. So Omisego has been kind of a big project in the Ethereum ecosystem for some time. It's been something that everyone in this space has kind of been looking forward to for years as kind of the solution that would make Ethereum scale and support more throughput and make it go forward for mass adoption. And so I'm super excited to hear you talk about that. But before we get into the specifics of OMG, I'd love to just hear more about yourself, your own background, how you got into crypto, and then get into how you got started with OMG.
00:01:13.350 - 00:01:39.546, Speaker B: Sure. So I was born and raised in Bangkok, Thailand. And when I was about eleven years old, my parents sent both my little brother and I to boarding school in the States. So we then spent the latter part of our teen years in the US. And then eventually I came back to Bangkok. Yeah. I've been kind of a two culture kid for most of my life.
00:01:39.728 - 00:01:41.040, Speaker A: Where in the US?
00:01:42.130 - 00:01:43.594, Speaker B: We were in Connecticut.
00:01:43.722 - 00:01:44.494, Speaker A: Wow.
00:01:44.692 - 00:01:52.778, Speaker B: So the typical boarding school kids. Right. And then I actually went to undergrad in Vermont and went to Middlebury.
00:01:52.874 - 00:01:53.182, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:53.236 - 00:01:58.114, Speaker B: And there's a couple graduates actually from Middlebury that are doing blockchain stuff now, too.
00:01:58.152 - 00:01:59.140, Speaker A: So it's been really.
00:02:01.430 - 00:02:16.678, Speaker B: And then I went on and did my master's at Columbia in New York, and that was actually around GIs and remote sensing. And that path led me to the World bank, which is how I actually stumbled onto bitcoin, funny enough.
00:02:16.764 - 00:02:33.150, Speaker A: Wow, what an interesting career. Okay, so can you talk about that first, what is GIs and remote sensing? And what were you doing at the World bank?
00:02:33.490 - 00:03:13.660, Speaker B: Yeah, so GIs stands for geographic information system. And so the idea is with a lot of the World bank loans to the government. Right. A lot of that time the money goes out into public infrastructure financing, and usually it's out in the remote areas, so you don't have a lot of data when you're making investment assessment and decisions. And so we pull a lot of satellite information in and things that are kind of now dubbed like Iots. Right. A lot of sensors to try to paint a picture on what kind of social environmental impact and investment might have.
00:03:13.660 - 00:03:20.214, Speaker B: Things that we were working a lot around was water resources management and agriculture.
00:03:20.342 - 00:03:20.742, Speaker A: Okay.
00:03:20.816 - 00:03:45.570, Speaker B: And so having more data input in terms of what does the topography look know? Demographics. People are using a lot of these technologies now to actually do poverty monitoring. Social giver has a really cool project. There's also a company called Planet Labs that do really cool satellite imagery, stuff associated with the un sustainable development goal monitoring and stuff.
00:03:45.640 - 00:03:47.574, Speaker A: Wow, interesting. Yeah.
00:03:47.692 - 00:04:35.650, Speaker B: So when I was hired into the World Bank, I was actually probably the first ten kind of GIs, remote sensing people bran into the bank. And that was when they started to leverage a lot of more of these technology. One of the first project I got sent to this was around 2011, was in Myanmar when the country started reopening. And the project I was working on at the time was improving resource management and utilization in the ag industry, in the agriculture industry. So what's really interesting there is, particularly in Southeast Asia, agriculture is so embedded in a very long supply chain. Right. And the fields are so small and so you don't have this large production system that you do in the west.
00:04:35.650 - 00:04:58.920, Speaker B: So from getting, from planting, processing, shipping, until the food actually reaches the table, like your table, it goes through multiple steps. Right. And a lot of that has to deal with rural commerce and financial services. How do you pay for things? And so that was how I got exposed to the rural financial services area.
00:04:59.450 - 00:05:00.078, Speaker A: Wow.
00:05:00.204 - 00:05:09.934, Speaker B: Yeah. But what was actually really interesting for me was when we started working in Myanmar, the banking infrastructure wasn't there.
00:05:09.972 - 00:05:10.174, Speaker A: Right.
00:05:10.212 - 00:05:20.626, Speaker B: Today it's still not there. I think the bank population in Myanmar today is about 25% and credit card penetration rate is less than 2% in.
00:05:20.648 - 00:05:46.650, Speaker A: These really long supply chains. How were people transacting with each other and paying for services? It was all cash. And I guess that's really limiting when sometimes you're expecting to get paid for a cop or something in the future, but you need to pay for products right away.
00:05:46.720 - 00:05:46.954, Speaker B: So.
00:05:46.992 - 00:05:50.650, Speaker A: Yeah, I can imagine how limiting that is for an economy.
00:05:51.250 - 00:06:00.538, Speaker B: Yeah. And so you see, things, know, we joke about, know, sticking your money under mattresses and mean, that's. That's reality.
00:06:00.634 - 00:06:02.330, Speaker A: Right. They actually do that.
00:06:02.500 - 00:06:24.530, Speaker B: And even with the World bank work, that was also reality, because when we dispersed the loans, there wasn't like a good way to transfer and wire money from DC to Yanko in the capital of Myanmar and then out to the countryside. Right. And so we used to have to carry cash out to local government offices.
00:06:24.610 - 00:06:33.478, Speaker A: No, that's crazy. Were you out with a suitcase full of cash running around Myanmar?
00:06:33.654 - 00:07:09.350, Speaker B: Pretty much, yeah. The dollar had a premium. Right. Because the country was opening up and know, the local currency now is more. I think it's a lot more widely accepted. But before that, people were still kind of, there's preference to actually get US dollars, but you have to pay those in like $1 bill. And even if there's like a little crank or a tear in the bill, you have to kind of sit there and try to iron it out.
00:07:09.350 - 00:07:15.670, Speaker B: Or when you go back to the states, we would have to exchange it to get new dollar bills because people just didn't trust it.
00:07:15.820 - 00:07:19.770, Speaker A: No, I guess it was like a lot of forgery.
00:07:20.750 - 00:07:21.306, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:07:21.408 - 00:07:22.620, Speaker A: Those had to be.
00:07:24.190 - 00:08:16.970, Speaker B: So, I mean, I think just like those two trends, right, the banking coverage or the lack of looking at how people view different currencies having premium in the US dollar. And then in the same time, if you look at the smartphone penetration rate in Myanmar, right. I think that's the third trend in the picture that really started sending me down the bitcoin rabbit hole was that the smartphone penetration in Myanmar now is about 80%. When I first started going into that country, it was about $500 per sim card. And that's just for call. That's like feature phone. That sector, the cost came down really quickly, and that sector grew so much faster than the banking sector.
00:08:16.970 - 00:08:46.514, Speaker B: You're looking at these trends. Right. And as an entrepreneur, you have to kind of think that there's just got to be a better way that you can start doing payments and fund transfer to add on to that. What I always think is really funny is Myanmar land is so expensive. It's like, mind blowingly expensive. And it's not just in the capital, it's anywhere. And so it doesn't make sense for banks to then start following the old traditional way of opening up bank branches.
00:08:46.562 - 00:08:47.014, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:47.132 - 00:08:50.966, Speaker B: It just doesn't make any business sense in that way.
00:08:51.068 - 00:08:51.720, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:52.410 - 00:09:07.786, Speaker B: So I started learning about bitcoin, and essentially I was just floored in a way. You can open a debit account, not having to talk to another human being, and then not having to go to the bank branch. You can get all that done in a few minutes, right?
00:09:07.888 - 00:09:08.490, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:08.640 - 00:09:12.240, Speaker B: And then on top of that, you can send it anywhere, which was amazing.
00:09:13.250 - 00:09:47.720, Speaker A: I'm sorry, because I know that in other countries with similar situation, in the sense that there's low bank penetration, but high smartphone or mobile phone penetration, there have been kind of traditional fintech banking solutions to cover that gap. But I guess Mtesa is, like the classical example. And in Myanmar, that wasn't even the case. There was, like, nothing.
00:09:48.510 - 00:10:04.430, Speaker B: Not in 2011. Today there are. Okay, companies like Ordeu, Telenor. Telenor has waived money. So people are trying to push the wallet play into Myanmar for sure.
00:10:04.500 - 00:10:11.440, Speaker A: Okay. But must have been so interesting to be in this. Oh, sorry.
00:10:12.370 - 00:10:34.642, Speaker B: No, I was just going to say, with wallets, there's a lot of, if I understand it correctly, similar to Thailand, it's two different financial licensing too. So wallets, you can only do certain things to it. So, like lending all these kind of complex, more banking services is not under a wallet license.
00:10:34.706 - 00:10:35.414, Speaker A: Okay, makes sense.
00:10:35.452 - 00:10:39.142, Speaker B: So I think it's just kind of a progression towards mobile banking.
00:10:39.206 - 00:10:39.674, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:39.792 - 00:10:41.260, Speaker B: It's not there yet.
00:10:41.870 - 00:11:09.940, Speaker A: Okay. It's really interesting to have seen this area where something like a distributed network for value transfer was so needed that not even these mobile phone based solutions were there. Okay, so that's when you were saying you got interested in blockchain technology. So how did that develop?
00:11:10.310 - 00:11:40.522, Speaker B: Yeah. So that panned out away where I actually came back to DC, to the World bank headquarter, and I wrote a little memo to my manager and I said, hey, why don't we look into bitcoin? At least we can try it for our own fund disbursement. And I think I got, like, stonewalled multiple times. Eventually I parked that idea and then fast forward a couple of years later, I moved back to Bangkok to start my own p. To p organic farming lending project.
00:11:40.656 - 00:11:41.580, Speaker A: Oh, cool.
00:11:42.110 - 00:12:08.680, Speaker B: So you touched on this earlier where there's a lot of different pieces that go into the agriculture supply chain. Right. So part of that was I wanted to see if I can help finance organic. So that was when I learned about Ethereum, and I actually got introduced to Jin and Donnie, who are the founder of the payment gateway company Omise. And back then, they were experimenting with Ethereum for their own payment.
00:12:12.090 - 00:12:19.750, Speaker A: Sorry, Omise was a traditional payments company back then. Just like using bank rails.
00:12:20.170 - 00:12:56.534, Speaker B: Yeah. So the payment gateway, essentially, in a nutshell, switches credit card transactions. They work with visa to process that. So back then, we were actually called Omisi blockchain labs, and Jen and Donnie, one of their earlier foray into the Ethereum space was they funded the first Ethereum dev grant. So part of that cohort, if I remember correctly, were people like status and Raiden. And so we got a lot of really good kind of og, Ethereum exposure through that. Right.
00:12:56.534 - 00:13:00.582, Speaker B: Both on scaling and also on the mobile side of things.
00:13:00.716 - 00:13:16.620, Speaker A: Right, okay, so you started working with them and kind of. In what way did you join their team to work on blockchain solutions to their gateway or what were you doing exactly?
00:13:17.470 - 00:13:43.314, Speaker B: So I was actually trying to poach one of the developers that they had. Because obviously Bangkok's not a very big ecosystem in terms of startup to begin with. And walking around and saying, okay, who knows how to interact with a smart contract was like finding needle in a haystack, right? So I was trying to lure this guy away from their project.
00:13:43.512 - 00:13:44.500, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:13:45.830 - 00:14:26.450, Speaker B: Jen caught me and kind of called me in one day and was like, what are you trying to do? It's like, well, kind of want to build this rail where I can do transfer of money because I want to do this p to P lending. I think after a couple back and forth we really hit it off. And what we realized is we had the same basic belief, right, that basic financial services like online payment, making a transfer is a 21st century fundamental human need. So we share this vision of a world where people have the options and the ability to transfer money globally without any restriction.
00:14:29.670 - 00:14:51.226, Speaker A: Sorry, I've heard you say this before and I think I've read it on OMG's website. This idea of the global value transfer being a basic human right or human need. I'd love for you to kind of expand on that a little bit since it seems to be like very core to what you do.
00:14:51.408 - 00:15:40.140, Speaker B: Yeah. Right now about 60% of the world population has some sort of access to the Internet, right? And as more of us moves online, for me, if someone cannot participate in that online economy, they can't get paid or they can't pay for services. They're essentially at a significant can't, you can't participate. It's like the UN, I think, declared that Internet access is a human rights from a very high level. I see basic financial services and online payment as the same thing. You can have communication, you can exchange services, but you can't get paid. I think it's just pretty, for me, it's pretty simple in that sense.
00:15:41.950 - 00:15:42.266, Speaker A: Where.
00:15:42.288 - 00:16:08.802, Speaker B: It'S just being able to participate in a global economy. And I think in Southeast Asia, where so much of our economy is importing and exporting and it's cross border goods and services and knowledge, right. The ability to move money around across those borders become really important. And I think it's a lifeline for the region in terms of growing beyond kind of just within the regional economy itself.
00:16:08.936 - 00:17:02.530, Speaker A: Right? I think you're totally right. And I think it's interesting to have your perspective from that side of the world where I think the issue becomes even more stark how important having this basic ability is to transfer value globally. And it's pretty amazing that we're still not able to. And we still have these geographical barriers for money. Okay, so once you kind of established that you and June had the same kind of values going forward, how did that happen? Progress.
00:17:03.030 - 00:17:13.874, Speaker B: Yeah, I think once we realized that, we said, okay, let's join hands and do something together, because we needed common infrastructure.
00:17:13.922 - 00:17:14.470, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:14.620 - 00:18:55.000, Speaker B: And as we see today, the scaling issue in terms of being able to transfer money on Ethereum becomes even more of a pressing issue as more and more applications are being put on it, them coming from a payment gateway experience, they know that 14 TPs is not going to be enough if they want to build any sort of financial applications on it. For me, I think even with lending 14 TPs and having to share and also pay high transaction costs was going to be a problem because I was targeting kind of small scale farmers. So in 2017, the end of 2016, actually, that was when we decided that we would launch then Omiseiko, now OMG network, and then we went down the whole path of we raise an ICO to fund it, because the way that we view it, the network is a public good. I'm actually very bullish on the fact that I think a lot of the payment systems will converge onto an open public infrastructure like Ethereum. And I say this because you need to build up an ecosystem, right, when you talk about financial services, and it's much more effective to do it to scale that when it open public system. We launched the ICO in 2017, and I think we became the first company to ever do a full KYC and AML on everyone. Oh, really? Yeah, I remember.
00:18:55.000 - 00:19:19.726, Speaker B: So this one lesson that I learned there was like, always listen to your CFO, because I think in the long term it helps us with a lot of regulatory headache as well. But I just remember when we announced that one side of the crypto space was like, yeah, this is probably the right idea. And the other side just completely blew up.
00:19:19.908 - 00:19:38.406, Speaker A: I imagine, like, an ICO in 2017 must have been crazy. And yours was one of the bigger ones. How was that whole experience like, yeah.
00:19:38.588 - 00:20:39.820, Speaker B: I think bigger ones, probably one of the ones that were talked about more. We certainly raised a lot less money than a lot of projects in our know, our goal for raising the ICO and our goal for founding OMG network has always been the same. Right. It's to build the scalable infrastructure to then enable open financial services, whether it's for payment or for transferring digital valleys. So I think from the white paper of the ICO itself, I think the why has always remained the same. What's been really important and interesting for me, and I think for our team to learn, is that the how to go about achieving this can change. And you can expect these things to change, right? Because the space is new, the research and technology progresses so quickly and the user behavior, the market demand, all those change.
00:20:39.820 - 00:21:05.970, Speaker B: And so from 2017 to what we launched as a commercial launch of the OMG network earlier last month, earlier this month, the big scope change for us was that we shifted from a fully on chain decks using plasma to focusing on building infrastructure that scales up transactions.
00:21:06.310 - 00:22:10.280, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Because I wanted to ask about this kind of perceived delay in shipping. And this is something that I've heard in this space a lot. OMG as the example of the ICO that was big in 2017 but hadn't shipped yet. And so when you shipped, it was even more confirmation of how much building there's been in Ethereum all the way through the bear market, even by the big ICOs of 2017, which many people like to kind of laugh at or say like, oh, these were all get rich schemes and whatever, but OMG was like a great example of. No, actually, many of these teams stayed on working.
00:22:10.280 - 00:22:32.880, Speaker A: I'd love to. In these couple of years, what was that transition like from your initial concept to what you finally launched? Why did that change happen?
00:22:34.130 - 00:23:34.850, Speaker B: Yeah. So from then until now, I think the big shift was, one is in our marketing, right. I think in 2017, a lot of people got caught up in the marketing of their product, selling it a little bit too early before product is available. And we were guilty of that. We also were on that wave. I think in 2018, we decided, hey, when you put the marketing so much earlier than when the product is available, it's just irresponsible. So we hunkered down for two years and then we just said, okay, let's build and then let's 2020, let's come out, let's get a really good launch partner, and then let's just let the product speak for itself in terms of our actual shift on why we went away from the decks to just focus on scaling itself.
00:23:34.850 - 00:24:11.370, Speaker B: I think the reason for that decision is pretty straightforward from a business perspective. In a mature money Lego world, right. That we're all excited about, products should be interoperable, in my opinion. So what this means is products are designed to not only be used as a standalone thing, because really integrated with other services and products. Right, right. This is the idea that everyone should be able to do one thing really well. So we look at it as, okay, let's stay simple.
00:24:11.370 - 00:24:47.558, Speaker B: We're going to be an infrastructure. So you want to minimize all the unknowns, all the complexity, do something really well, solve that scaling pain point really well for a specific customer, and then depending on what people want to use it for, they'll be able to put these different solutions together and have the best combination for what they're trying to do. Yeah. So I joke with my team that we don't want to be a duck, I don't know, like a thai thing or not, but with a duck. Right. You can swim, you can fly and you can walk, but you don't do any of this stuff.
00:24:47.644 - 00:24:49.650, Speaker A: Okay. That's a good thing.
00:24:49.820 - 00:25:00.006, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's what we want to avoid. And it's clear that the congestion problem is a problem today. Right. And so we want to be able to solve that.
00:25:00.128 - 00:25:34.150, Speaker A: Okay. No, that makes total sense. And I think what you said about marketing is such a valuable lesson. I think that's a great lesson that this space learned from 2017. And I think it's matures. From what I'm seeing now in projects launching today, it looks like people are doing marketing after launching and after shipping more and more. So I think that's a great development.
00:25:34.490 - 00:26:13.378, Speaker B: Yeah. I think it's maturity of the space as well. Great for us. Right now we want to focus on let's market, let's talk, let's communicate to customer about what we can do today. So let's be realistic about it. And I think that's from product perspective, it makes a lot of sense, but also from a consumer perspective, like consumer protection, I think that's the part that worries me is if you over at market and the product is not ready, there are so many solutions that go to market and don't get security audits. Right.
00:26:13.378 - 00:26:36.890, Speaker B: We were terrified. We did two security audits simultaneously. We did fund stamp and consensus. So I think we just need to realize we're dealing with real people's money and there's implications. I think just being a lot more responsible and take a cautious approach, it's going to be better for us as a space in the long run. Yeah.
00:26:36.960 - 00:26:46.240, Speaker A: For. So speaking of that, tell me about what OMG can do today and is doing.
00:26:50.050 - 00:27:25.482, Speaker B: So. The problem that we're trying to solve, the problem that we're focusing on is solving the Ethereum congestion problem. So the way that I've always framed this is I think blockchain is still in the early dollop days. If we compare it to the Internet and these L2 are meant to essentially be a broadband. And once these start to mature more I think it'll unlock a lot of different use cases that we haven't even thought about today. We didn't know Spotify was going to be a thing. We didn't know that network was going to be a thing, which is really cool.
00:27:25.482 - 00:28:07.222, Speaker B: That's what I'm very excited to see, the L2 maturity in terms of the problem itself that we're solving. I think the March twelveth is like a really widely talked about congestion event. Right, right. Even with the small number of adopters today in the crypto space during peak hours, the network, the Ethereum network, clogged up. And I think the average wait time of Ethereum is like 44 minutes to send a trip. Also, the last month or so, Ethereum gas fee has just been insanely ridiculous. I think the average is like 45 Guai or something.
00:28:07.222 - 00:28:32.014, Speaker B: So that's like twenty cents. I think it's a very timely launch of our network and also some other L2, but also I think with our partner, with our launch partner with Bitfinex, USDT transaction on Ethereum, I think alone was spending about $2.4 million over.
00:28:32.052 - 00:28:33.242, Speaker A: The last 30 days.
00:28:33.316 - 00:29:06.214, Speaker B: Yeah, it makes up 25% of Ethereum transaction and I think you've written about it. Also, Flipside has this really cool diagram that they were looking at, USDT movement. And so partnering with Bitfinex really was meant to start unlocking, taking some of this tether off of Ethereum main chain to decongest that and then help the exchanges kind of save costs as well, because a lot of the USDT transactions are between exchanges.
00:29:06.262 - 00:29:06.860, Speaker A: Right?
00:29:08.590 - 00:29:11.280, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead.
00:29:12.850 - 00:29:50.780, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I wanted to ask, before we get into whether OMG is achieving that right now with USDT and Bitfinex, I wanted to kind of take like parentheses and for you to explain a little bit of how exactly plasma works and what's the difference between Ong and plasma and L2. All those terms, I think can get a little bit confusing for people who are not reading and doing stuff on Ethereum every day.
00:29:51.310 - 00:30:21.390, Speaker B: So the OMG network scales up Ethereum transaction right now to a couple thousands of transactions per second. And we do this at a third of the transaction cost of Ethereum today. We solve this problem by using a scaling framework called plasma. As we've been kind of talking about it at the highest level, plasma is an off chain scaling protocol and it's predicated on the creation of a child chain, which is in this case the network.
00:30:21.550 - 00:30:22.162, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:22.296 - 00:30:48.502, Speaker B: The child chain batches transactions before committing it to Ethereum. And this is how we get to scale. So the OMG network, the child chain, relies on Ethereum as the ultimate arbiter of security. In that sense, there's many flavors of plasma out there. I think at one point in early 2019, we were counting and there were like 20 different flavors of plasma.
00:30:48.566 - 00:30:49.180, Speaker A: Wow.
00:30:49.630 - 00:31:28.460, Speaker B: And I think different it was during research phase as well. Right. And so people were trying different construction to optimize for their use case. And with the OMG network, plasma construction, what we use is what we call plasma more BP. And the objective of this construction is to achieve higher transaction throughput at lower costs while maintain the same security guarantee as Ethereum itself. Okay, so if we take one step back and we say, okay, the blockchain trilemma challenge, you have scale, security and decentralization. Right? And you can really tinker with two out of the three.
00:31:28.460 - 00:31:34.700, Speaker B: So what we chose with this construction is we optimize for scale and then we maintain the security.
00:31:37.470 - 00:31:40.650, Speaker A: So you're compromising on decentralization.
00:31:41.390 - 00:31:44.000, Speaker B: No, so we don't optimize for.
00:31:45.970 - 00:31:47.520, Speaker A: That'S. That makes.
00:31:49.650 - 00:32:16.966, Speaker B: Like, maybe the hardest part and the part that took us the longest to get right is really the trustless piece of. So credit to our CTO, Kasima, the way that he framed the product itself, if we have to say a one liner of what it is. Right. He says it's a trustless, centralized transaction processing service with decentralized security.
00:32:17.148 - 00:32:18.714, Speaker A: Okay, that's a lot.
00:32:18.912 - 00:32:33.882, Speaker B: I have to essentially imagine those words when I'm saying it every time. So what it really means, though, is that we do centralized security and trustless piece while including this piece of noncustodiality, which is like what people like about blockchain.
00:32:33.946 - 00:32:34.560, Speaker A: Right?
00:32:35.250 - 00:32:48.846, Speaker B: But you get the centralized transaction processing piece, which is how you get to scaling. So it's a single operator. Sorry, a single block producer. And OMG network is the block producer.
00:32:48.958 - 00:33:17.354, Speaker A: Okay? So in this kind of limbo, when transactions are being batched in the OMG child chain, and at this point, they are depending on a single block producer. So they are going through kind of this centralized transactions processor. Right. How do you maintain security there when transactions are at this point?
00:33:17.552 - 00:33:54.360, Speaker B: Yeah, we have these players called the watcher. So there's really three, if you imagine the high level construction of how all the services fit together, there are three players in this. We have the root chain, which is Ethereum, and with Ethereum, we have a set of smart contracts that manages the plasma protocol on the Ethereum root chain itself, and that handles the deposit and the exit in and out. Of our network. So we deploy that contract and we don't control it. So that's going to your point. That's the decentralized piece.
00:33:54.360 - 00:34:32.834, Speaker B: The second entity is the child chain that we talked about. So this is what we operate. And then the third component is what we call a watcher. So watchers are operated by our users or our partner or OMG token holders. Right now, staking is not an implementation, but that will be down later down in our roadmap. So today we essentially have partners running watchers, and the watchers validate everything that's happening on the child chain against the root chain. And that's the part that we're using right now as decentralized security piece.
00:34:32.952 - 00:34:42.550, Speaker A: Oh, got it. So watchers make sure all the transactions are going through correctly while they're being batched in the child chain.
00:34:43.050 - 00:34:50.758, Speaker B: Right. So it's a similar approach as the Watchtower and lightning for bitcoin.
00:34:50.854 - 00:34:55.050, Speaker A: Okay. And right now, who are the watchers?
00:34:56.190 - 00:35:23.406, Speaker B: Yeah, right now we're the watchers. And then we're assuming that Bitfinex and a lot of the exchanges that integrate will actually have to run their own watcher as well. Right. Because they have the incentive to essentially look at the transactions that are going on. Anyone can actually download a watcher. My dad actually is a watcher. It doesn't require a lot of processing.
00:35:23.406 - 00:35:34.790, Speaker B: It takes about an hour to set up and you just need a laptop. So right now we rely on really goodwill and community to help staking comes on board.
00:35:34.940 - 00:35:51.390, Speaker A: Okay. Right. And then with OMG incentives, that will be the piece that kind of helps decentralize the watcher system. Right. Do you have a timeline for staking?
00:35:52.450 - 00:36:16.790, Speaker B: We don't. We're still working on it. It's in one of our priorities for things to do this year, and I think a lot of we want to do it in steps. So I think we'll have to kind of see how we roll it out slowly and obviously cautiously. Right. Because it has a lot of implications on the network and long term sustainability of the network.
00:36:24.650 - 00:36:45.440, Speaker A: That's how plasma OMG works. And so how is it helping Ethereum right now? I mean, you launch with this huge partner, Bitfinex, and USDT, as you said, is a huge contributor to gas consumption. So has there been any impact so far?
00:36:46.130 - 00:37:02.498, Speaker B: Yeah. So Bitfinex integration is still progressing. So once that's done, I think we can then start to actually claim that we're helping to offload the congestion. So that piece is not done yet.
00:37:02.664 - 00:37:03.474, Speaker A: Okay.
00:37:03.672 - 00:37:11.720, Speaker B: So what's missing the integration. So we're still integrating with the exchange itself.
00:37:12.090 - 00:37:21.706, Speaker A: Oh, got it. So Bitfenx isn't processing its USDT transfers through. OMG. Yet?
00:37:21.888 - 00:37:22.858, Speaker B: No, not yet.
00:37:22.944 - 00:37:51.220, Speaker A: Oh, got it. Okay. And then would the next step be, I guess, adding more exchanges? Because as you mentioned, most USDT transactions happen between exchanges as people doing arbitrage with this stablecoin. So I think to really have a meaningful impact, you need all exchanges to be on board. Right. To be using this system.
00:37:51.990 - 00:38:25.566, Speaker B: Right. I think we talked about this in our last chat where you do need a couple of exchanges and you can kind of see in the flip side chart. Right. Who the big exchanges. You know, there's the big top tier exchanges that are using USDT, and then there's kind of the long tail. And in terms of our partnership roadmap, we're in discussion across that. So you need a couple people for the use case to be completed for sure.
00:38:25.668 - 00:38:45.060, Speaker A: Yeah, makes sense. I'm also really curious about how this scaling solution compares with others across Ethereum, because this is like, scaling is like the big problem and there's a couple of teams working on different ways to achieve it.
00:38:45.990 - 00:39:23.330, Speaker B: Yeah. Today it's like this Cambrium explosion of L two research. Right? I feel like it's one of those things where this is like where the cool kids do in 2020. From a high level, I would expect things like sidechain, state channel and plasma to be more production ready and robust compared to the newer research, like the roll ups. Right. Just because it has more development time, more tooling, more ecosystem. And we talked about this earlier, security audits, we've all gone through multiple.
00:39:23.330 - 00:39:58.854, Speaker B: When scaling, I always say that there's no such thing as free lunch, and so everything has a trade off. And you have to choose this trade off based on your use case. So the core element of plasma and what makes it different from other two scaling solutions out there is that every block on the plasma chain is bundled into a merkel tree and committed to the root chain. Right. So this provides the benefit that even if something goes wrong on the child chain, the honors users will always be able to exit their funds.
00:39:58.982 - 00:39:59.660, Speaker A: Okay.
00:40:00.110 - 00:40:32.402, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is like the hard trustlessness piece that we were talking about earlier to figure out. And so that's a value prop to plasma. Now I'll go down through maybe three or four kind of scaling framework, maybe starting from the OGs. So supply chains. Right? So side chain compared to plasma. Sidechain attaches itself to the main chain by using a peg that enables the two way transfer of assets.
00:40:32.466 - 00:40:33.174, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:33.372 - 00:41:07.300, Speaker B: There are different ways that you can operate them. And the nice things is that it gives the flexibility to a given use case. The trade off of side chains generally is that it asks the user to trust the mechanism of the side chain itself and not the root chain. So how plasma is different, is that security wise, because it's ultimately secured by the root chain, if something goes bad, then the user's funds are safe. Yeah, I think Vitalik describes plasma chain as like side chains that have a non custodial property.
00:41:07.750 - 00:41:10.386, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay. That's a good way to look at it.
00:41:10.568 - 00:41:44.206, Speaker B: Yeah. OG number two, state channels. So I think the big difference there is how transaction finality is reached, and it's also the limitations around the fixed number of participants in a given state. So the aim of state channel generally is to allow transaction off the blockchain without needing any additional trust. So in order to prove this is done, in order to essentially improve the cost and the speed of the transaction itself.
00:41:44.388 - 00:41:45.120, Speaker A: Okay.
00:41:45.650 - 00:42:08.130, Speaker B: So with state channels, just for people who are curious about how it's done in a high level, you need a unanimous agreement on the state updates generally. So how it works is like one, you have a set of users and they have to agree to lock up part of the main chain state. Right. And they also need to agree on when to update the state.
00:42:08.280 - 00:42:08.978, Speaker A: Okay.
00:42:09.144 - 00:42:20.986, Speaker B: Two is that when they update the state, they do it by signing a transaction to validate the new state. But these updates are not submitted to the main chain yet.
00:42:21.088 - 00:42:21.740, Speaker A: Okay.
00:42:22.190 - 00:42:40.618, Speaker B: Then when they're doing some transaction, the third piece is the participants have to submit the final state back to the main chain and then close the channel. Here you need all the participants to show up, because if they don't, it can essentially block status updates.
00:42:40.714 - 00:42:41.022, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:41.076 - 00:42:45.854, Speaker B: So it's not great for applications that require a lot of changing sets of participants.
00:42:45.982 - 00:42:46.660, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:47.670 - 00:42:57.620, Speaker B: Compared to plasma, on the other hand, we rely on Merkel proofs to submit to the main chain. So that means that finality on plasma is the same as finality on.
00:42:58.170 - 00:43:20.410, Speaker A: Okay. And you don't require all of these participants to be constantly online and updating and reaching this consensus, correct? Yeah, we don't. Is anyone using side channels and state channels?
00:43:22.190 - 00:43:35.266, Speaker B: State channel is. Raiden is still Raiden, I think, just had a launch recently as well. I haven't been that closely, but they had some sort of announcement earlier this month.
00:43:35.448 - 00:43:58.710, Speaker A: Okay. And side chains, I guess because recently I've been hearing about plasma and roll ups and decay roll ups and all that stuff. Optimism. But yeah, I haven't heard too much about these solutions. And so, yeah, I was wondering if they kind of fell out of fashion.
00:43:59.290 - 00:44:06.470, Speaker B: Yeah, no, they're still there. I think side chains, there was POA network and you think Xdai.
00:44:06.550 - 00:44:13.534, Speaker A: Oh, that's right. Okay. That's what they were running on that. Okay.
00:44:13.732 - 00:44:36.550, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. I think the Ethereum research ecosystem is very interesting. Right. Because with research, you can change the scope and you can look at different things in a short time scale. Right. You can pivot, you can do all that. But once you get into production, you take all that research into production.
00:44:36.550 - 00:44:52.280, Speaker B: I think a lot of these projects are just heads down building. They're not so much in the research, top of the research discussions, but I think they're actually working.
00:44:54.990 - 00:45:13.600, Speaker A: You're right, I've heard about them and I see them doing stuff, but I totally forgot they were using these solutions. To your point earlier, it's good to hear from projects that are actually launching and shipping stuff rather than.
00:45:17.350 - 00:45:18.514, Speaker B: There are two space there.
00:45:18.552 - 00:45:18.706, Speaker A: Right.
00:45:18.728 - 00:45:51.642, Speaker B: And I think everyone occupies a space. There's like the research space, which I would still put a lot of the roll ups there because it's so new. And then plasma was in the research space in 2017 and 18. Right. And then you saw a whole shakedown. The constructions that work, the constructions that can find a use case stay, and then you take that to production. The constructions that don't necessarily have the demand kind of go away or turn to some other research solution.
00:45:51.642 - 00:46:29.514, Speaker B: Right. And so I think it's just a natural part of kind of the research into production maturity, very darwinian survival. But I actually think, or all the roll ups will go through the same thing over the next couple of years. So it's a very exciting research space, but I think for me, looking at it from offering a business service to customers. Right. I would want to wait a couple of years and see which shakes up, because I think it's just a natural progression of where things go.
00:46:29.632 - 00:46:43.040, Speaker A: Okay. Between plasma and roll ups, beyond roll ups being in the more kind of research phase, what are some of the main differences there?
00:46:43.650 - 00:47:30.606, Speaker B: Yeah, so the optimistic roll up guys, the optimism guys, we've seed funded those guys. Initially they were plasma group, and then they pivoted. So I can speak a little bit more about their approach and how it's different plasma. There's actually a lot of similarities between the two as well. So both of those approaches have a smart contract on the main chain that holds users funds and that gets compact state updates from the child chain periodically and fund exits go through the same kind of similar challenge exit game. So you can kind of look at it as like, plasma and optimistic roll ups are essentially consequential innovation for the Ethereum in that sense.
00:47:30.708 - 00:47:31.360, Speaker A: Okay.
00:47:32.130 - 00:48:28.218, Speaker B: All of L2 comes with a trade off with or it runs an EVM compatible virtual machine called OVM. Key innovation here is that it enables something like optimistic rollups to execute anything Ethereum can. So arguably this gives it a wider range of use case compared to plasma. The challenge of or is that it's more complex, and there's a lot more. So as an example, like at Devcon, I think, or in uniswap, did a demo, and that was customized demo to showcase roll ups with no smart contracts. Now, I believe the recent one that they did with the OVM testing on synthetics, it didn't have roll ups. So what this means is you can't do deposit or withdraw, and so you're just running logic.
00:48:28.218 - 00:48:35.570, Speaker B: So at some point, they're going to need to put all this together and be exciting to see. Right. But it's definitely a complex undertaking.
00:48:35.910 - 00:48:37.300, Speaker A: Okay, interesting.
00:48:39.030 - 00:48:40.030, Speaker B: Straightforward.
00:48:40.190 - 00:48:53.640, Speaker A: Yes. And in that sense, do your potential partners or clients, are they missing that kind of smart contracts piece? That kind of EVM piece?
00:48:54.250 - 00:49:38.230, Speaker B: Yeah, we've been focused on payment and value transfer. You can push some of that logic up a layer on top of the infrastructure, the scaling infrastructure. Right. So we do get questions whether or not there is future compatibility or functionality we can add. I think Carl from optimism actually posted last August or September in a blog that his view is that in a mature L2 ecosystem, the two solution, actually, because I think, or scales to about a couple hundred transaction per second. But they do have that wider use case. Right.
00:49:38.230 - 00:49:40.738, Speaker B: Whereas plasma scales to thousands.
00:49:40.914 - 00:49:50.460, Speaker A: Oh, sorry, I lost you in the last 10 seconds. You were saying that Carl posted something about.
00:49:52.830 - 00:50:31.094, Speaker B: In August last year, Carl from optimism had a blog post that was talking about how plasma is critical if we want to scale up to thousands of transactions per second. Right. Because, or I think does a couple of hundreds, maybe thousand. But in his view, he was saying that in a mature L2 ecosystem, the two solution will probably coexist. And I think I would agree with that. I don't think it's a one winner take all game. There's just too many use cases that the technology can support.
00:50:31.292 - 00:50:57.600, Speaker A: Okay, that's interesting. Okay, this is like one of my final questions. I know we're a little bit running short on time, but really wanted to understand how these L2 solutions will fit with e two, do they work with e two? Will they kind of transition into this new chain? How will that work?
00:50:58.370 - 00:51:16.422, Speaker B: Yeah, I can speak from our perspective. I think every system has to evolve. Right. And E 2.0 is incredibly complex, but it's a worthy undertaking. It's going to take a few years to get e two engineering work done, but I think it will get done. Right.
00:51:16.422 - 00:51:44.462, Speaker B: The unknown for me from a business perspective is once the engineering is done, then you need to make it economically compelling enough to attract the ethereum ecosystem over. I think all this will take time to mature. In the meantime, congestion issue is realist today. So I think the L two s in today's world have that space to be solving today's problem.
00:51:44.596 - 00:51:46.494, Speaker A: Definitely, yeah.
00:51:46.532 - 00:52:19.180, Speaker B: The OMG network, the protocol is dependent on EVM support. So we don't expect that there is going to be a problem with future adaptability to E 2.0. And I think another thing about Ethereum 2.0 charting is that there may be a strong use case for l two to accommodate cross chart transfer during time of discussion. Yeah, I would need to Kissima, our CTO can probably speak a lot more to that, but that's a theory that we've been kind of looking into.
00:52:20.510 - 00:52:21.498, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:52:21.664 - 00:52:22.042, Speaker B: Okay.
00:52:22.096 - 00:52:46.370, Speaker A: But I guess for now the idea is we'll be using ETH one, I mean, the crank chain, for a while. And so in that time is where L2 can really help drive increased throughput and drive kind of adoption forward with hopefully more mainstream adoption.
00:52:46.950 - 00:53:27.630, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I think it's about solving a problem that people have. Right. I think kind of the build it and they will come mentality no longer is going to work at it. Yeah, it didn't work in 2017, it's not going to work now. So I think just for me, maybe the final two thoughts that I have just around talking about L2 scaling is at the end of the day, I think there's going to be multiple L2 solutions in the market and based on the use case and functionality, they'll all find our niche. But really, at the end of the day, the market decide who the winner is.
00:53:27.630 - 00:53:43.282, Speaker B: Right? So I think it'll be interesting, it's going to be interesting to see all the chains that are in production today and all the chains that are under research, all the L2s that are under research and see how the landscape pans out.
00:53:43.416 - 00:54:26.900, Speaker A: Yeah, no, that makes total sense. And then finally you came into this space with this really big vision of bringing global transactions to everyone in the world and making value transfer accessible and easy. Has that vision changed at all? Do you think it's still possible for ethereum to bring this kind of basic human right of value transfers to everyone? And how close are we to getting there?
00:54:27.510 - 00:55:04.910, Speaker B: Yeah, I think how close are we is a hard prediction. To put a timeline. I think there's a lot of different moving pieces, but I think for us, we're trying to do our part. We're trying to build the infrastructure. So going back to why all this matters to OMG, the real end goal for us is enabling access to open financial services, and that's really providing people with the option and choice. And I think these things come in step right. So, step one, we've achieved one of what we would think is a first major step in the grand plan.
00:55:04.910 - 00:55:46.666, Speaker B: We did the commercial launch of the OMG network. Now we're going to continue to ramp up and build up business and partnerships. You probably saw in the news earlier this week, our holding company closed a series C. So that's essentially a strategic raise, and it brought on a lot of corporate partners that we're going to be leveraging. And so we want to bring both the current open finance space and the enterprises together. And I think that's in terms of looking at where the company sits and the resources that we have at hand, we're in a really good position to be able to forge those two worlds that today kind of sit separately. Right.
00:55:46.666 - 00:56:03.186, Speaker B: And so when you talk about mass adoption, you kind of need the enterprise. As much as some people might not agree with me, but that's where the customer is sitting. So how do you make both of those world kind of coexist closer together?
00:56:03.368 - 00:56:14.180, Speaker A: Right? Yeah. So I guess you're now building the foundation for this vision to become a reality, but it's definitely still there.
00:56:14.790 - 00:56:38.410, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's going to take as a whole space, it'll take time. Right. Things don't just happen overnight. And I think that we have the resources and the partnerships that understand that. I think what I'm very excited about is the network is live. We're at the position where. This is where things get really fun.
00:56:38.410 - 00:57:04.722, Speaker B: Right. You start building up use cases and it's out there in the wild. I don't know. I've been very proud of my team. I've been very lucky to have our CTO, Kasima, our VP of product, Connie, and our CEO, Steven. Their leadership has just been amazing in bringing our team together and keeping them focused. And always, Jen and Donnie has always have our back.
00:57:04.722 - 00:57:14.262, Speaker B: And so I think I'm very excited to see the next couple of years and how it pans out with the space and also with our business.
00:57:14.396 - 00:58:02.440, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's really encouraging to see these solutions helping Ethereum scale right now and at a time when DeFi is really kind of exploding and actually bringing value to people, even though it's really niche still, what I'm seeing is super encouraging. So yeah, really exciting to see how everything develops and what OMG does going forward and when we start seeing that impact on transactions and congestion. It's been really such an interesting conversation. Vanza, thank you so much for taking the time. I really appreciate it.
00:58:02.890 - 00:58:04.740, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you very much for your time as well.
