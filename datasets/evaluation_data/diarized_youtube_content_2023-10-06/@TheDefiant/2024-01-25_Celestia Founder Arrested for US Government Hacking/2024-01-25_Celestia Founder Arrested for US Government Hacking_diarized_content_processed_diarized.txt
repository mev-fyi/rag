00:00:00.090 - 00:00:59.882, Speaker A: When I was a teenager, I was involved with various kind of like hacking groups. Some of you might have heard of like Anonymous and laltec, but I was part of this kind of like hacktivist group called laltec that hacked into various kind of us government and corporate entities. And for example, we hacked into emails of these federal contract called Hbgari Federal. And that revealed various wrongdoing that that company was doing. And at the time I was just like 15 years old, and all I had was a laptop, a cheap laptop. And so that kind of made me realize that it was kind of like a David versus Goliath moment. That made me realize that with access to just a laptop, by creating software or by manipulating information, you could basically redistribute power from the powerfuls to everyone else effectively.
00:00:59.882 - 00:01:05.486, Speaker A: And so that's kind of like, what? That's also a big reason why I'm interested in cryptocurrency as well.
00:01:05.588 - 00:01:14.562, Speaker B: Absolutely. And can you tell us a little bit about the trouble you got into with that group? And I also am curious to understand your experience kind of dealing with law enforcement, if you're willing to share.
00:01:14.696 - 00:01:39.300, Speaker A: Yeah, because I was 15 at the time, so I didn't have a big sentence. There was like something like 80 computer hacking charges. But because I was under 18 in the UK, I only had like a two year suspended sentence, which means I didn't have to serve time in jail as long as I didn't reoffend. And then I had something like 320 hours of community service in a charity shop.
