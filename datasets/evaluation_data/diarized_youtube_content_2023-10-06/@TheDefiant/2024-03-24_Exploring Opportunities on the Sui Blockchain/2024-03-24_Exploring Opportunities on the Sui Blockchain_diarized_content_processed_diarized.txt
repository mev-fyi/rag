00:00:00.330 - 00:00:21.386, Speaker A: Right now there's a lot of focus on incentive programs with tokens. Wondering whether you guys have anything like that. With Sui, you haven't done an airdrop that I know of. I don't know if that's something that you're planning or just like a more general incentive program for people who want to earn your token.
00:00:21.498 - 00:01:02.622, Speaker B: Yeah, the incentive program is basically occurring. Customer, every product doesn't matter if web two, web three, every product they want to get going. Solving the costar problem is common to have some kind of incentive program to acquire customer. We're working with a lot of different products and services to do that, to help them do that. So you may not see a sort of traditional airdrop of suite because we're way past main net launch anyway. And it's also a question of how sticky that is. But we definitely have a lot of things going on right now.
00:01:02.622 - 00:01:40.542, Speaker B: If people are paying attention to the suite ecosystem, they will see there's a lot of opportunity to be rewarded for trying out things and that we want to point people to. So one hand we want to remove all the friction for people to jump in and start playing around with three, and then we want to incentivize them to stick around or try new things, and that becomes part of their life, something they enjoy using and they stick around and we want to make them lifelong users. So, yeah, combination, these efforts are definitely going on.
00:01:40.596 - 00:01:45.946, Speaker A: Okay, so what's the best way to learn about that and to start getting involved?
00:01:46.138 - 00:02:23.214, Speaker B: Well, I mean, go to sweet IO, go to follow Sui network on Twitter. There are plenty of content, plenty of information out there. About three follow people who are being three OGs for a while. They are talking about their products, right? If you're interested in defi, you can talk about use scallop, you can use turbos, you can use Navi, you can use bucket. All these different protocols. If you're interested in gaming, we have like 80 some gaming in the pipeline. All them are launching.
00:02:23.214 - 00:02:41.422, Speaker B: A lot of them are launching pretty soon. Some are very well known IPs as well. Love to see people kind of try them. We also already have run legend. We have arcade champions, a lot of Cosmo. There's an amno crossing game. I forgot the name, exact name.
00:02:41.422 - 00:03:12.134, Speaker B: Cosmo something topion or something. These are game either in beta Appender, they're games. Right. So sorry, I can't remember the exact name. But if you go to follow us on the social media and on our website, you can discover this application. We believe that's the best way to get understand your suite or you want to buy fuddies. Right? There's the NFts.
00:03:12.134 - 00:03:18.102, Speaker B: That's another way to interact with the community as well. Lots and lots of opportunities.
00:03:18.246 - 00:03:34.318, Speaker A: Would you want there to be a focus of a specific use case on Sui? Do you see any specific use case having a competitive advantage on Sui rather than another?
00:03:34.484 - 00:04:26.560, Speaker B: No, I think we have technical and product competitive advantages across all the different product categories. Defi happened to be the first one to get to that point of product market fit because it's just a faster iteration kind of a space. But we're pretty sure gaming is going to take off big time in sui ecosystem. Like any point now as the games start to launch, NFTs and social media type of deep in. That's something that's very concrete that a lot of people benefit from. We have several project launching or they're not coming to suite because we want to build something better than what they can build on other platforms. So it's not one particular area.
00:04:26.560 - 00:05:08.750, Speaker B: And to be, we believe there's going to be new product categories that people have, maybe a combination of all these different elements or maybe just something we have never anticipate they will come out. And ultimately that's what we mean. This is a developer platform and the developers are the ones we care a lot about. Right. Because we want to empower them to build great products for tumors. That's the way to go. We are very confident that that's going to happen on street.
00:05:08.750 - 00:05:09.340, Speaker B: Thank.
