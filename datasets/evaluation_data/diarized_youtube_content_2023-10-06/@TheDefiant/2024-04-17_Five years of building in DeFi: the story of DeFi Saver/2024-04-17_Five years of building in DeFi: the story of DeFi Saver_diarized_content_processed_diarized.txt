00:00:04.480 - 00:00:19.794, Speaker A: All right, here we are with Nenat Valinkacevic, co founder of Defi Saver. It's great to have you here at the Defiant. Really interested to learn more about the Defi Saver story and what you guys are up to. So welcome.
00:00:20.094 - 00:00:22.034, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you for having me.
00:00:22.814 - 00:01:04.414, Speaker A: Awesome. So, yeah, Defi Saver has been around for quite a while. I think you're one of the first DeFi projects out there. You started out at CDP Saver originally, I think, to handle kind of maker positions and have expanded from that there. So, yeah, I'd love to hear more about the founding story and then we'll get into kind of all the latest. So just to. Sorry, just to get everyone on the same page, if you can just explain what Defisaver is and what it does.
00:01:04.954 - 00:02:07.444, Speaker B: Yeah, so basically what DefiSaver is, is we're an app. We're a DeFi management app. So we have different protocols like maker you mentioned, and liquidity and Aave and so on. So we integrated all of the main ethereum protocols, Defi protocols, and we aggregate them into one app. Besides just aggregating them, we provide a bunch of other additional features like liquidation protection, one click loan shifting. So moving your position from one protocol to another, basically providing like advanced actions in simple steps. So a lot of times people actually call us like a power tool or something, some app where you can access all the protocols you use but also have a bunch of advancements, features to make it easier to manage and to properly control your positions.
00:02:07.604 - 00:02:24.396, Speaker A: Awesome. So we'll get into more details on all those features and so on. But first, let's go back to the founding story and if you can include maybe your background, like what led you to starting Defi saver and how that turned out, how that was like.
00:02:24.580 - 00:03:00.934, Speaker B: Yes. So I have a technical background. I think that's like most of people in Ethereum, they do have some sort of a technical background. I was a coder kind of doing full stack development that quickly, I guess, became a bit boring. I was starting to get more interested in finance and looking at different things. So around like 2016, 2017, I started to looking into the crypto space a lot more. Started reading like mastering bitcoin and mastering Ethereum, really, really good books.
00:03:00.934 - 00:03:45.874, Speaker B: So I started to kind of technically go into the whole blockchain industry that was booming at that time. And I quickly stumbled upon Ethereum and really liked the developer platform. And that that's something that I could, you know, build apps on top of blockchain. So essentially that's how the company was founded from that idea. We at first we were R and D center. So research and development, because Ethereum was so young, there weren't really any live use cases for it yet. So we were experimenting and trying to build a bunch of different dapps and to see what works on this new technology.
00:03:45.874 - 00:04:46.358, Speaker B: So one of the projects was CDP saver. So we had a bunch of different experiments and projects. One of those projects was CDP saver. It is a quite interesting story how we started, because I was actually like an early makerdao user in 2017, 2018, and we were all in Thailand on a vacation trip. So I actually sponsored part of my vacation and traveling to Thailand with the maker CDP. So I deposited some ether and I could get some dye out of it. One bad thing from it is that I did not expect that one of the biggest Ethereum crashes was at that time, the price of it went to, like, I think like 70 or $80, and I was outside riding, like, motorbikes in the jungles of Thailand.
00:04:46.358 - 00:05:26.094, Speaker B: So I wasn't paying too much attention on the price and I didn't get liquidated. But I went back home and I saw that my CDP almost got liquidated. Right. I was like a few dollars away from liquidation, and basically that's how the idea started, because I was thinking, okay, I'm a developer that's working full time on Ethereum. I'm somebody that's online almost all the time. I'm someone that checks the prices and knows the technology. But even for me, it was hard, right, to not get liquidated, to manage my position, to kind of keep everything upfloat while I was doing it.
00:05:26.094 - 00:06:18.170, Speaker B: So we started kind of realizing that we do need better tooling, and we wanted to first, the idea was to create a, some sort of tool that helps users to protect from liquidations. But while we were building that, we realized, like, okay, definitely it's not just one problem, like the UI and the user experience needs to get a lot better. So we started building something called CDP Saver, which was kind of a dashboard for maker that had those, like, advanced liquidation protection and like one click repay, one click boost. So kind of aggregating what then was defi into one app and providing, like, a good user experience and more advanced options. So, yeah, I guess that's the gist of it.
00:06:18.322 - 00:06:38.194, Speaker A: Nice. So the idea was to make it easier for people to avoid being liquidated and just more generally access maker. I guess from there, how did that evolve into, more broadly defi saver?
00:06:38.854 - 00:07:18.424, Speaker B: Yeah. So around that time, we started working on it. I think the whole term of DeFi was being coined on one of those telegram groups. So basically back then there was maybe maker and a few other companies, I think like compound had a version v one and a few other protocols were kind of like zero x was doing exchanging back then and Kyerswap. So we quickly realized like, okay, this is maker is just one part of a bigger puzzle. And that puzzle is Defi. And we saw all the interesting developments going on.
00:07:18.424 - 00:08:07.810, Speaker B: So we quickly realized, okay, we actually want to integrate the different exchanges. We want to integrate stuff like compound. So we moved from being strictly be like a maker dashboard to being a defi dashboard. So that's why we moved the name from CDP saver to Defi saver to kind of signalize that we're doing now like the whole DeFi ecosystem and trying to. It's actually kind of an interesting point because when you only have one protocol, obviously there's kind of a limited amount of things you can build on top of it. But one really cool thing about Ethereum and defi in general, like everything is open source and transparent. So we can kind of easily implement other protocols and then kind of combine them together.
00:08:07.810 - 00:08:16.174, Speaker B: And I mentioned like loan shifting and stuff like that. So you can kind of easily combine different protocols and create kind of a more powerful tool.
00:08:16.914 - 00:08:39.184, Speaker A: Awesome. So there are other applications that are attempting to do somewhat similar things, you know, just like facilitate access to Defi. So how do you, how do you differentiate from them? Like what makes defisaver special?
00:08:39.604 - 00:09:17.428, Speaker B: Yeah, so I guess it's like most things, it's a few things. Not one thing that differentiates you in the market. One of the things we mentioned, like we, we started early, so we build a lot of trust with the users, with like OG DeFi users. They started early with us. It was a growing experience. And so we obviously over time, kind of learned a lot and kind of increased the quality of our outputs and the quality of the product. So I guess kind of, it's always, it's kind of, everybody says that, but we are like user oriented.
00:09:17.428 - 00:10:27.196, Speaker B: We are someone that's, we are like Defi users ourselves and kind of using that path that worked for us in the beginning of like solving our own problems and kind of finding other people that have similar problems. So we go from there. We generally don't try and rush and integrate everything, but we try and curate a really good list of protocols and features that we believe are beneficial to the user. Having all that tied up in a good ux and quality work that's something that we're proud of. The second big thing I think I would like to mention is the automation part. We call it strategies, but that's something that I think we're one of the first in the market to actually build a decentralized strategy, automation. When I say stopping liquidations, we're not doing that centralized or we're not doing that custodial.
00:10:27.196 - 00:11:01.078, Speaker B: Right. So we build a system or smart contracts, which we don't have access to the users funds. Users funds are still at the user's wallets and they have still full control, but we have a system of smart contracts that can monitor the blockchain and execute specific actions that the user approved. So I think leading that sort of automated, the liquidation protection, different defi strategies, that's something that we started four or five years back and are still kind of one of the largest features in the product.
00:11:01.206 - 00:11:07.918, Speaker A: Awesome. Can you get into some of the features you offer? What are some of the strategies that people can do?
00:11:08.006 - 00:11:55.724, Speaker B: Yeah, so one of the most common strategies and one of the first strategies we implemented is that repay strategy. So just a quick TLDR. Users can get liquidated on their default positions. If the price falls well enough, the collateral they put in is going to get sold on the market. That's something, that's not the best option for the user because most protocols, they will sell all your collateral, there's going to be a fee associated with it. It's going to occur, a lot of losses for the users. The first strategy we built was to create an automated repay so the user can put their own parameters.
00:11:55.724 - 00:12:52.254, Speaker B: When the price falls and their position is kind of more risky, they can sell just a portion of their collateral and we aggregate all the different on chain exchanges so they get a really good price and so we can repay just a small portion of their position to keep them safe without incurring all different losses. Obviously, that was the first strategy. We probably have now over like 50 different strategies like stop loss or take profit, or like trailing stop loss. Even some fund strategies like DCA strategy, that's obviously good when the price is down. So because we have a large collection, I guess, of different protocols, we have a lot of different strategies, usually dealing with kind of managing the position safely.
00:12:52.354 - 00:12:56.678, Speaker A: Nice. Okay, so over 50 different strategies and how many protocols have you integrated?
00:12:56.806 - 00:13:24.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm actually really bad with numbers, but I would say probably like ten plus protocols. We have all the, all the major ones, I guess we can count even stuff like Lido and different decentralized exchanges and so on. So we do have a lot of like everything basically. That's kind of being a long time in defi and it's kind of proven to work. We have it.
00:13:27.094 - 00:13:31.394, Speaker A: And so far it's just for ethereum based defi.
00:13:32.294 - 00:14:16.846, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I would say like from evm because we do implement l two s as well. So we have arbitram optimism and base l two s. Obviously the l two ecosystem is booming, so probably gonna add some more like l two s in the future, so. But we are kind of strictly oriented in the Ethereum e ecosystem, right. So the ethereum mainnet and all the bigger l two s around. And that's one of the, kind of, one of our big integrations was moving usage to l two s because we are doing like advanced strategies and advanced actions. They do cost a lot of gas.
00:14:16.846 - 00:14:39.736, Speaker B: So we were very sad when we went like the gas prices rises and Ethereum price rise, obviously that like prices out some of our users during the past. Now when we have stuff like arbitrum and optimism, it's really cool to see smaller users having the access to a lot of features as well.
00:14:39.880 - 00:14:50.764, Speaker A: Awesome. And speaking of l two fees, what did you think about the Den Koon upgrade? How did that impact you and your users?
00:14:51.144 - 00:15:50.052, Speaker B: Yeah, we actually love the latest work. One obvious win was the blobs. Right? So the l two s, especially even for us, like, because the, like I mentioned, transactions are more complicated, they have a lot of call data in them. So even on l two, sometimes they can cost, you know, a few dollars. Now with, with the blobs, I think the costs are like ten x less. Obviously that depends on the gas costs and everything, but in general, I think it costs the, the gas cost on l two, it costs a lot. One thing I actually like about Dankoon, not just with the blobs and the savings, like even the technical eaps, like with the transient storage, that's something that's going to help us kind of build a better code base and save some gas on l one as well.
00:15:50.052 - 00:16:04.164, Speaker B: Right. So I would generally say the latest work was really good for us. And in general for Ethereum it was kind of a bunch of smaller improvements and one really big with the bop and the gas fees on altos.
00:16:04.664 - 00:16:18.444, Speaker A: Awesome. And did you find now with the lower gas costs, there are actions that maybe you couldn't do before, but now you can like have any new strategies opened up?
00:16:19.144 - 00:17:08.660, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess we're kind of waiting to see how the whole blob thing plays out. Obviously it's still new. So we're going to see if the gas reductions are going to keep being so low for l two s. I guess the gas was never too much of the worry because even before the latest eip, the gas costs weren't that high. So no, really like dramatic, different strategies from us, but it's really cool to see that like some strategies that are simple, like limit order or even a DCA or some simple strategies like that. Now they can work with users that have a lot less money and they don't have to worry about gas fees. Because one thing about the l two is they are really cheap even before.
00:17:08.660 - 00:17:42.790, Speaker B: But when the gas spikes on l one, obviously when the l two s can get a bit higher. So now everything is kind of lower. And we are really glad to see, like for instance, on arbitrum, now we're kind of seeing, we have even more enabled strategies on arbitrum than on the mainnet. And we see a lot of users on arbitrum and on l two s in general. So it's cool to see a lot of different users kind of being able to use this on l two s because of that.
00:17:42.942 - 00:18:01.514, Speaker A: Awesome. And can you talk more about your users, like stats on a number of daily or monthly users or whatever is the right measure? Any insights you can give on kind of how people are using defi?
00:18:01.814 - 00:18:42.254, Speaker B: Right, right. Yeah. So in general, we do try and not track a lot of info about our users. That's one thing we're trying to do is to kind of respect the privacy. So I don't have a lot of like detailed information about the users because we generally don't track them. Obviously we do follow what's going on, I guess the amount of users, and we can see the rapid growth in the TVL, in our automated strategies that I think it's over half a billion right now. That rose a couple hundred million in terms of months.
00:18:42.254 - 00:19:48.984, Speaker B: As far as the users interactions, obviously during run like we're having right now, users are generally using landing protocols to leverage. One interesting use case we are seeing more and more is the liquid staking derivatives. So a lot of users are doing different options of looping liquid staking derivatives on AAVE and other protocols. We see people even doing like funding rate arbitrage between the spot markets and the perpetuals. So we see a lot of different usage, but it's during like, I'm not going to say a bull run, but during like an uptrend like we have now. Usually people are more into like trading and lever trading using money markets. But obviously in defi there's a lot of different like strategies to earn good yield and to stop without taking too much risk on price.
00:19:49.364 - 00:20:04.264, Speaker A: Awesome. Okay, so leverage, doing loops with liquid staking tokens in AavE and money markets. And how does that compare with the bear market? What were people doing more then?
00:20:05.444 - 00:21:05.244, Speaker B: Yeah, during the bear market, I guess obviously people are always going to do some sort of trading. I guess. I think strategies, like I mentioned, like a DCI strategy is maybe something that kind of the more experienced users during, when the price is low, they actually want to have a strategy to accumulate more money. During the last period, the rates weren't so high. So I feel like a lot of people were trying to loop something or use different protocols to get like a good yield on their assets. And that's something we saw beginning of the last year, like when people had the ability to stake ether and then use that stake theater in the Defi ecosystem. We saw a lot of different kind of defi alchemy going around and people building all sorts of positions where they can earn good yield or even kind of.
00:21:05.244 - 00:21:30.012, Speaker B: Now the rates are pretty high, but like a good usage was to have a liquid staking each derivative as collateral and then borrow some sort of die or something and you will pay like very little or almost have positive interest on your position because like you're earning yield on your collateral. Like that's something we saw about you.
00:21:30.188 - 00:21:43.264, Speaker A: Awesome. And now with, you know, the big thing is like airdrops and points, do you have strategies to optimize that currently, like for airdrops?
00:21:43.304 - 00:22:22.916, Speaker B: Obviously, because we're building in a lot of different protocols. Some protocols give away the tokens and airdrops and have some sort of point recollections. We didn't really jump on the whole latest points grace too much. I think we're trying to see what, what stuff is legitimate first. Definitely. I think there's some value there. So we do have a lot of even newer protocols like Morpho, I know they have some liquidity mining programs and AAvE has now a liquidity mining program and so on.
00:22:22.916 - 00:22:47.944, Speaker B: So our users are kind of, are exposed a lot to different liquidity programs. We haven't jumped on the whole points craze yet, but I think there is a lot of legitimate protocols that have some sorts of a point system and we're not opposed of integrating them and using that as leverage, I guess.
00:22:48.284 - 00:23:14.432, Speaker A: So if you were to jump on kind of the airdrops on point craze, how would that work? Because are you like technically executing actions for your users, but I would guess like you're using your own wallet to do that. So like, would the Airdrops point come to your wallet first and then you would distribute it to the user?
00:23:14.528 - 00:24:08.868, Speaker B: Generally? No, I don't think that really happens for us. It's kind of a technical point, but we can go into it. As I mentioned, because we were building with Makerdao early on, most of our users, when using defi server, they have like a custom smart wallet. That smart wallet is a DS proxy. That's the smart wallet that Makerdao was built in like 2016 or 17, and we started using that. So each user has their own wallet and the position they have on Morpho and so on, it sits on in that wallet. So usually when the user has some sort of rewards or when we do an action from the user, they only give us access to, like, they give us our smart contract specific access to call a specific function on their smart wallet.
00:24:08.868 - 00:24:29.274, Speaker B: So that's kind of the main point is users have custodial, they have kind of access to their own money in their smart wallet, and we don't really have access to it, and they get all the rewards on their smart wallet or their EOA.
00:24:29.734 - 00:24:59.040, Speaker A: Got it. Okay. So when interacting with Defi Saver, you will have your own smart wallet associated with your, you know, defisaver strategies, and then that wallet is going to perform all the actions and receive any rewards or anything that might be associated with it. Yeah, makes sense. And I saw recently you started using safe. Is that the partner you are using for the smart wallets?
00:24:59.232 - 00:25:43.174, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's something that we're gonna release in the next few weeks. So like I mentioned, the main smart wallet we're using currently is dsproxy, the maker based smart wallet. In the past, I guess, six months, we were researching on how we could upgrade that wallet and kind of provide additional features. We were looking at what kind of, because the DS proxy is kind of, I guess, an old wallet built in 2016. So obviously the industry has evolved. And so we were looking at technically what sorts of upgrades on the wallet side we can provide for the user.
00:25:43.174 - 00:26:35.926, Speaker B: One of the kind of the best solutions we came up with is to not really, really reinvent the build. We were looking at the safe code, which is really good code base, open source. It's kind of easily, it's modular and kind of easily. There are sorts of add ons. You can extend the ecosystem, and the ecosystem is obviously one of the largest. So that was kind of our decision to actually slowly move away from the DS proxy to integrate safes. As a firsthand citizen in the DeFi saver ecosystem, we know a lot of people have different safes and they use it as a multisig, which we do believe is the best way from a security aspect to actually use DeFi.
00:26:35.926 - 00:27:24.614, Speaker B: So we are really glad to move more into that multisig space and to integrate something that's kind of already popular and widely used so users are not really locked in with us. If you obviously have a safe and you use Defi saver, you can go to the official safe app if you don't want to use this anymore, or you can go to any other app and use your safe from it. So we really don't want to lock in users in some sort of proprietary wallet or something that they can only use it with us. With the safe ecosystem, we believe it's kind of a really good way to have advanced security, have a bunch of additional features, and then kind of use kind of a standard in the industry.
00:27:25.194 - 00:27:51.344, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And speaking of how DeFi has really evolved from 2016, 2017, and you've been through it all from the very early days, so I'd love to, I don't know, see your thoughts, get some insights from you on how the ecosystem has changed over time.
00:27:52.004 - 00:28:55.948, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I think the main thing, it's definitely grown a lot, and I don't think just like the TVL aspects and amount of users, it's grown as the industry, as like the practices and the security aspects and that the quality of the projects we're seeing now is getting much better. We were definitely at the beginning at some sort of prototype research phase. So there was a lot of, like, even now there are some obviously DeFi hacks and there are some protocols that fail and so on. But we do see that, like, there's a lot more like really good developers and really legitimate projects actually, like innovating. And we were kind of at the beginning, I almost feel like we were trying to emulate like the treadify system on top of the blockchain, but now you can see that we're kind of moving past that. Like, the current apps are not just replicate of what you can do in a tradify system.
00:28:55.948 - 00:29:12.774, Speaker B: There actually is something that they're going above that, right. There's something that are blockchain native and they provide a lot more features and a lot more than just your regular bank account or a trading app.
00:29:13.394 - 00:30:01.084, Speaker A: That's super interesting. Okay, so I guess right at first we had maker, I think was the first DeFi protocol, and that was kind of like the DeFi central bank issuing dai, allowing collateral based lending. Then we had Dexs with zero x fiber uniswap. So that was. Yeah, like decentralized trading, but still trading, still similar to tradfi. Then we had other compound, more kind of lending, borrowing with collateral. And what do you think? Kind of the next generation has been, I guess like staking based apps would be the thing.
00:30:01.084 - 00:30:13.624, Speaker A: Probably like liquid staking, restaking, like all these things or. Yeah. What else are you seeing is kind of these apps that go beyond tradfi?
00:30:14.364 - 00:31:25.324, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Like the staking and the liquid staking ether moves from proof of work to proof of stake. That kind of provided a whole info of yield that's reliable and consistent and you know where it's coming from. So all the projects kind of innovating on top of that kind of shows you the power that you can build some sort of like a simple, primitive, like proof of stake protocol, but then like all the defi Lego blocks can build all different, like financial instruments on top of it. I guess we kind of are seeing also, if you look at, you mentioned like different dexes, like uniswap V four is around the corner right now and probably stuff like Aave before, and we see new protocols like Morpho coming out and liquidity is coming out with the version V two. So definitely a lot of like the, the old OG protocols kind of, they never stopped innovating. Right.
00:31:25.324 - 00:32:17.634, Speaker B: It might seem like incremental improvements, but we are kind of coming to like a architecture of landing protocols that are much more resilient, much more capital efficient than they were like three years ago. So I'm really kind of glad to see that. I think that that's going to like, in the future, open up, open up a lot more use cases and kind of even from security and the capital efficient side, provide a lot more value for the users. So that's something not even looking at all the potential other use cases, just looking at the current use cases we have, I see it year over year, incrementally becoming better and better and providing more on that promise of decentralized and transparent finance. So I'm really happy about that.
00:32:17.974 - 00:32:30.926, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Makes me really excited as well to see all this progress and then to wrap up what's next for Defi saver. Like what are the big milestones you're looking at in the coming months?
00:32:31.030 - 00:33:32.074, Speaker B: So currently we are all focused on the safe integration. Obviously, that's kind of a lot of work for us to have a built in safe support and have the safe wallet work with everything we have currently and with other stuff we want as well. So that's kind of our immediate focus on providing like the best safe integration into any Defi app. Besides that, we are definitely working a lot on small quality of life improvements, but stuff like better p and l, better profit and loss. So providing better information for the user. So a lot of different new exchanges where the user will get better info. So with the latest safe integration we are thinking on how can we actually provide better power features on top of safe as well.
00:33:32.074 - 00:34:36.378, Speaker B: So one of the things we are working on is also besides just automating different stuff, even sending transactions for the user with the safe app, obviously you can just sign your transaction and anybody can send that recession to be executed. So we are providing building a service that's going to provide for the user, a way for them just to sign their operations and we'll handle the complexities of actually sending it to the blockchain and paying gas for it and watching out for math and failed transactions and so on. So kind of trying to simplify the user experience and also provide better security features of having a multisig. And that Multisig is built in and works really well with app because that's one of the common problems is everybody's pushing for the users to have better security and to use stuff like multisigs, but it's not really easy.
00:34:36.466 - 00:34:50.336, Speaker A: Well, Nenat, thank you so much for taking the time. This has been super interesting. Love learning about Defi Saver. Excited for the new safe integration and yeah, we'll be covering everything at the defiant. Thanks again for joining me.
00:34:50.360 - 00:34:51.384, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you for having me.
