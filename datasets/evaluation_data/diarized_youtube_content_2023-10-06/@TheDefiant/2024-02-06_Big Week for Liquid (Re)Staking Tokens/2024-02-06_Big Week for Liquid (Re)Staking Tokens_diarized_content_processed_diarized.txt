00:00:00.330 - 00:00:54.090, Speaker A: Now onto the other headlines, there's lots of liquidity staking news. Let's start with stride. So stride is the leading liquidity staking protocol in the cosmos ecosystem, and it has added support for Celestia. The project has allocated 5 million stride tokens worth 18 million, about $18 million at the time of reporting, and it will distribute an airdrop for early adopters of staked TIA tokens. So 3 million stride will be distributed in the next 60 days. Next up is Puffer Finance, another liquid restaking protocol launching recently. Pretty impressive.
00:00:54.090 - 00:02:10.610, Speaker A: It opened its doors to depositors on February 1, launching a quest and vampire attack, seeking to reward users in exchange for converting Lido state ETH token for its liquid restaking token, Puff E. So the campaign was very successful, and it was able to raise or attract almost $200 million in the first day of launch. So yeah, this puffer finance new liquid restaking protocol, really making waves. We've had a few vampire attacks, protocols, exchanging incentives for people, switching over from another protocol, and this is what puffer is doing, and doing so very successfully. So something to keep an eye out on then. Next liquid restaking news is vector reserve. So this is an Ethereum based protocol.
00:02:10.610 - 00:03:11.130, Speaker A: It launched vequidity position derivative, LPD. Hard to keep track with all of these acronyms for tokens, LSTs. Now there's liquidity position derivative, which this LPD token is backed by a basket of yield bearing tokens. So ve can be minted against Lido's staked ETH, renso ece, etherfi's ETH, kepler daos rs ETH, and regular wrapped ETH. And since launching this week, it has grown to a market cap of 5.2 million. And yeah, it's offering very high yield by aggregating all of these liquid staking tokens in one.
00:03:11.130 - 00:04:11.680, Speaker A: So interesting to check out. Next liquid Restaking news I told you guys this was heavy. LST week, swell announced the launch of RSW ETH, a liquid restaking token. The token allows users to earn Ethereum staking rewards and native restaking yield from Eigen layer without locking up their liquidity, meaning users can also use tokens in other Defi protocols. Token holders can also earn Eigen layer's restake points along with pearls, which is incentives of swell. So pearls are like points which represent a future claim on swell's forthcoming swell token. And final liquid restaking news.
00:04:11.680 - 00:05:05.214, Speaker A: DyDX chain launched a liquid staking token for its DyDX token. So this means that you can stake DyDx on the DyDX chain. That's a native chain of the cosmos ecosystem, and you get a token in return which gives you liquidity against your staked DyDX. So that's all for liquid restaking and staking news this week. Obviously, a huge sector growing sector in DeFi. Everyone wants to extract as much yield and as much liquidity from their trading activity. And so liquid staking and restaking is a way to do this.
00:05:05.214 - 00:05:10.670, Speaker A: So that explains the popularity of all of these tokens and all of these protocols.
