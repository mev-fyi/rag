00:00:01.200 - 00:00:21.121, Speaker A: Gm. Good Lord. So much has happened in the last 48 hours. And you know what they say, if life gives you lemons, make a lemonade. But what do you do if life gives you onions? I'll tell you what you do. You chow down and do the work. Now listen, this is supposed to be Bancor version 3 launch party today.
00:00:21.121 - 00:00:56.147, Speaker A: A whole bunch of new things. Bancor, the OG of AMMs. But you know what? Do kwon ust luna shat on everyone's parades. They pooped on the party and we are going to get straight into it after these messages. Onions Spicy.

Famous in the space for its automation features, Defi Saver has been the darling of many investors and degens alike during big market crashes and swings.

00:01:30.405 - 00:01:59.637, Speaker A: I'm fine. So we wanted to be Talking about Bancor v3. Impermanent loss protection kicks in instantly. BNT staking in single pools trading, single hop trading. It's pretty cool. Auto compounding of trading fees and rewards. The rewards themselves can be in BNT plus any token.
00:01:59.637 - 00:02:41.649, Speaker A: So the dual rewards there, that's actually really cool. Deposit limits, there aren't any and the gas costs have been significantly reduced and the pool tokens can be single sided and composable. But we will cover Bancorp V3 properly in a future video because this is a significant upgrade on where we were for AMMs and Bancor has consistently been one of those just pushing the boundaries in terms of what's possible. Impermanent loss protection. That was a cool one. Let's put that all to one side because wag me it didn't feel like that did it yesterday when UST dropped to wherever it dropped to. But like I woke up this morning and UST went as low as 22 cents.
00:02:41.649 - 00:03:05.251, Speaker A: This is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It's at 22 cents. Something is broken. Now we covered yesterday what actually happened here. But what is Do Kwon doing right now, well, he's been on Twitter and you know, do loves to be on Twitter. He says close to announcing a recovery plan for USD. Hang tight this morning.
00:03:05.251 - 00:03:38.669, Speaker A: Getting close. Stay strong, lunatics. Now, we don't know what that recovery plan is going to be, but there are quite a few heavily invested parties already in UST and Luna propping it up. Jump Capital, SBF Alameda. There are some big names in this and if it goes tits up, well then it's going to be bad for them. Janet Yellen was on was testifying yesterday saying that ust, I mean in the way that only Janet Yellen can, that.
00:03:38.797 - 00:03:42.923, Speaker B: There are risks to financial stability and we need a framework.
00:03:43.029 - 00:04:16.841, Speaker A: Saying the UST had gone on a bank run and it was something to be concerned about. She wants to see hardcore stablecoin regulation before the end of the year. That was the big news from yesterday. And then we have Stephen Dogetoshi saying Yellen hired Citadel to break USD pegs so US government can increase regulatory scrutiny on crypto. So conspiracy theories abound. Did Yellen hire Citadel? Well, we don't even know that it was Citadel and Ken Griffin behind the USTD pegging. But whoever it was, they needed to have very deep pockets and supreme confidence in their execution.
00:04:16.841 - 00:04:55.227, Speaker A: But execute they did. So here's how it went down. The first leg of this problem was the LFG Lunar foundation guard started buying BTC to help back up ust. Then they announced the four pool, ust, frax, USDC and usdt. So they removed liquidity from the three pool that had been sitting in, making that three pool very vulnerable and it got drained. There was a short position built on BTC which was where all the money was made. They borrowed UST to then drain the liquidity from the three pool, started de pegging ust.
00:04:55.227 - 00:05:31.465, Speaker A: And once that depegging process began, Dokwon was forced to sell btc, which crashed the BTC price, which accelerated everything because Luna started dropping as well. And then the whole thing just went to shit. What was amazing was that by yesterday afternoon in Central Eastern Time, USD had actually recovered to around 90 cents. So it hadn't done a terrible job. And the lunar mechanism actually kicked in and brought the peg back close, but not entirely up to $1 parity. Wake up this morning, it's even worse. So it had gone down to even into the kind of $0.20
00:05:31.465 - 00:06:16.949, Speaker A: area it was bouncing around. I don't exactly know where it is right now, but it had gone from 30 cents where it had kind of stabilized and found a floor to around 50 cents and then bounced off again. Who knows what's going to happen? What we do know is that a lot of people on paper have lost an enormous amount of money. Now if you think we preach this idea of retreating to safety and stablecoins are not a defensive position. If your stable net worth was in ust, you've been screwed here. And there are a lot of people who are, at least on social media, suicidal. We've seen stories on Reddit, people posting suicide hotlines, and yeah, things are pretty bad.
00:06:16.949 - 00:06:43.651, Speaker A: And this just comes off the back of what has been nonstop bearish pressure all the way since November last year. Is this capitulation? We'll know in hindsight. See you in six months. So will people regain confidence in Doe Kwon? Pentoshi says. That's the easy part. If number goes up, confidence restored, people forget in a week. So, quite rightly so, people have very short memories in crypto.
00:06:43.651 - 00:07:27.263, Speaker A: There will be a period where there'll be a lot of criticism and people will jump on this and dance on his grave. But do Kwon probably hasn't helped himself because here's a tweet from May 8 he said, those of you waiting for the earth to become unstable, I'm afraid you'll be waiting until the age of men expires. Cities have returned to the dust, oceans have gone bone dry, the map of continents have been drawn anew and dinosaurs once again roam the earth. But I've got news for you though, because dinosaurs of traditional finance do roam the earth right now and they have drained your ocean. So gluck to you my friends, gluck to you. And will people learn from this? Mike McDonald says the best part is Doe will disappear. He has made life changing money.
00:07:27.263 - 00:08:19.923, Speaker A: You have lost all yours. You will fall for the next grifter who employs the same tricks he will rebrand as something else and his next project will result in him profiting again, hopefully off you. Doe actually is fully public. He's been posting pictures of his kid on Twitter. What are you doing? Somewhere at some point do went from being kind of reasonable, smart businessman to being an egomaniac. I'm not entirely sure when it happened, but someone who has also not released their identity but has also been kind of experimenting with different things and disappearing is of course zagabond and the Azuki story continued yesterday with a very poorly received spaces with Andrew Wang, who seems to have a habit of picking up these projects which kind of get into people's souls and then turn out to be Garbage pudgy penguins. Andrew Wang was connected with that.
00:08:19.923 - 00:08:48.367, Speaker A: And now it's Azuki. So there was a spaces last night. Zagabond went on and spoke at great length about what had happened. If you remember, it turned out that the Zagabond himself was connected to not one, not two, but three previous rugs in the NFT space. Plum says the founder refused to dock, so he refused to give up his identity. Still called Zagabond. Refused to say where 500e from the Zunk's Mint went.
00:08:48.367 - 00:09:01.467, Speaker A: Framed rugging as healthy experimentation, learning. And I think it was the word learning that got most people pissed off. We just kept hearing him say, oh, this is all experimentation. I was learning. I was figuring stuff out. I was learning. And that's fine.
00:09:01.467 - 00:09:28.565, Speaker A: Like, if you or I want to learn something, we don't get people to pay for it. We don't crowdfund our own learning. Not to the tune of multiple millions of dollars. No, you pay for your own learning, but that's the issue here. Plum says Azuki was most probably a slow rug, but unexpectedly blew up. So now it's all about being here for the community and building. Zagabond himself probably didn't think that Azuki was going to just capture the zeitgeist the way that he did.
00:09:28.565 - 00:09:50.215, Speaker A: A lot of influencers piled in and shared their Azuki's on Twitter, saying, this is the most incredible art. This is the most incredible community. We all collectively lost our minds. So in the spaces, there was an emphasis on what they call story product. Story product. Like Bobo the bean farmer. The issue here is that people didn't realize necessarily that they were in a story.
00:09:50.215 - 00:10:18.185, Speaker A: I did a project way back in 2020 called the Rug pull. I advertised it was going to be a rug pull, and in that, people were expecting to have their rug pulled. As it turned out, I flipped it on them and I made them rug pull me and made them really question their role in that process. But they rugged me, not the other way around. But they knew they were in a story. They knew that they were in an experience. And I think that's the problem that people have here.
00:10:18.185 - 00:10:41.117, Speaker A: There's been this kabuki going on, but they didn't know they were in that story. They thought they were in a different kind of story. And Zagabond at no point made any attempt to disabuse them of that notion. So things got really ugly on Twitter. Paulie said, we're going to release their identities if they don't start telling the truth. This is mob rule. It feels like when Bored Apes got doxxed, except worse.
00:10:41.117 - 00:11:08.935, Speaker A: Paulie then actually posted the name and address of someone who's on the team. Rightly or wrongly, we don't know, but definitely that's a thuggish move. And then there was these rumors of tons of Eth being moved from the Azuki wallets. All the tweets about that have now been deleted. So it seems to me that maybe that that was a rush to judgment and actually this wasn't happening. But then more strange things. $60 million in royalties have been withdrawn from BlockFi.
00:11:08.935 - 00:11:21.291, Speaker A: Clearly they were a little bit scared. And I do have chili on my lip. I didn't realize. Delicious. So a lot of kind of snap judgments outrage on Twitter. 8000 ETH being moved. This guy's a fucking idiot.
00:11:21.291 - 00:12:01.775, Speaker A: How do you blow it this bad? Zagabond responded today after the spaces and after hearing all the criticism I fucked up, he says. After the space of the day, I realized my shortcomings in how I handled the prior projects, which I started. To the communities I walked away from, to Izuki holders and to those who believed in me, I'm truly sorry. As a creator of Funks Tendies and Zunks, I apologize to these communities which I made out to be learnings on the path to creating Iizuki. There should have been more transparency in communication, and the handover should have been handled with more care. Next, we want to let the Iizuki know how important they are to us. We're dedicated to improving transparency and communication.
00:12:01.775 - 00:12:57.505, Speaker A: It's very easy to be cynical about all of this, particularly when he finishes that tweet thread with we rise together, we build together, we grow together, we rug, but not together. So I'm not really one to dance on graves. The Azuki holders clearly saw some incredible gains on that project if they bought at the right moment. For anyone else who didn't, well, it's a salutary tale about really understanding who it is that's behind the project that you have this much capital tied up in. So that's where we finish it today. You know what is the best way to finish this? Well, I'll take another slug of this, another bite of my onion, and we'll just hand it over to Kay Money, who is way more articulate than I could ever be. At least not with a mouthful of red onion.
00:12:57.885 - 00:13:16.949, Speaker B: I didn't scam people. I was learning. Sure, you may have lost a lot of money, but your loss is my gain in knowledge. I'm always learning I don't even see the big deal. If Azuki was founded on scammed money, shouldn't that just be seen as crowdfunding?
00:13:17.077 - 00:13:17.669, Speaker A: Teehee.
00:13:17.717 - 00:13:38.375, Speaker B: I'm just a woman. Dev. Oh wait. My advice to you is once your project does make money, do something on your roadmap and then delete all of your social media. You need to teach people not to expect anything else. You can look at my last projects as rugs all you want, but really they were just helping me build my next learning experience. Azuki.
00:13:38.755 - 00:13:58.825, Speaker A: All right, so about 15 minutes ago, Do Kwon actually released the first stage of what the plan is. He says, I understand that the last 72 hours have been extremely tough on all of you. And he says, I'm going to weather this crisis. We'll build our way out of this together. The language has completely changed. Gone is the arrogant puffed up dough. Instead we have a contrite dough trying to find a Solution.
00:13:58.825 - 00:14:29.725, Speaker A: He says UST is currently trading at $0.50, a significant deviation from its intended peg at $1. Here's the big bit. The price stabilization Mechanism is absorbing ust supply over 10% of the total supply. But the cost of absorbing so much stablecoins at the same time has stretched out the on chain swap spread to 40%. If you know how this works, there's an internal AMM within terror and it has a target spread that it works within. 40% is definitely not that.
00:14:29.725 - 00:15:02.341, Speaker A: And when the spread goes too wide, then the lunar price diminishes dramatically to absorb the arbitration that's going on. So he says before anything else, the only path forward will be to absorb the stable coin supply that wants to exit before UST can start to repay. So there's basically all this. USC has lost all its confidence in the market and he wants to get the fuck out as fast as possible. And there's nothing they can do about it because there's just too much. It's like trying. It's like if your house floods and you're trying to shore up all the door sills and everything else, it's just not possible.
00:15:02.341 - 00:15:31.493, Speaker A: So they proposing to increase the base pool from 50 million to 100 million SDR. Sorry. And that will allow the system absorb the UST more quickly. So it's like just kind of buying a massive grab bag of sponges to absorb the water with. It's. It's a shit show right now. And anyone thinking that this would, you know, quickly resume the peg in like two weeks like the way it did last time, it's not going to happen.
00:15:31.493 - 00:15:39.665, Speaker A: It's going to take a huge amount of time for confidence to come back to ust. But the first thing they have to do is regain that peg. We shall see peace.
