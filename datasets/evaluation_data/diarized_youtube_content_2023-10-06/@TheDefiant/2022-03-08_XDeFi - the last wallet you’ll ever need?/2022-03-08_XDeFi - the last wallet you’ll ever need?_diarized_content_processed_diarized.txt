00:00:00.490 - 00:00:23.354, Speaker A: Admit it, you are just a little, tiny, little bit sick of metamask. All the issues, the fact that it's banning users in Fura, what's that all about? There are, believe it or not, alternatives out there, and some of them are actually pretty cool. Today we're going to look at one of those. It's X DFI, there's an octopus, there's a whole bunch of other stuff going on, but what is it? Well, that's coming up after these messages from our sponsors.
00:00:23.482 - 00:00:26.710, Speaker B: In 2021, Ethereum traders lost over $200.
00:00:26.780 - 00:00:30.210, Speaker A: Million to malicious bots exploiting their trades.
00:00:30.290 - 00:01:24.866, Speaker B: As DFI continues to gain popularity, this number is expected to rise. Eden Rocket RPC is a next generation private transaction service for Ethereum, providing traders with MEV protection by submitting transactions directly to miners and away from the prying eyes of harmful bots. Using Eden network for Ethereum transactions results in better and safer trades. Now, while MEV protection doesn't require any stake, traders who do stake the Eden token and use the Eden RPC on Metamask receive transaction block priority. And now with the release of staker extractable value, or SEV, they are paid for every trade they make on Ethereum. Edom Rocket RPC compiles some of Ethereum's fastest private transaction networks, resulting in a 90% plus effective hash rate. And this makes Eden Rocket RPC the fastest private transaction network available, protecting you from bots.
00:01:24.866 - 00:02:03.794, Speaker B: On top of that, Eden Rocket RPC users are paid to trade on Ethereum. Join the best and get started with Eden Network today and trade safer the NFT landscape is rapidly evolving. It's moving away from static JPEGs and towards real utility. Creators are looking for a solution that will help them to more deeply engage with and grow their communities. Galaxys sits on the cutting edge of this next evolution by allowing users to deploy a supercharged NFT collection that includes dynamic utility traits. These traits can be used by anyone with a following to offer exclusive discounts, VIP access, digital and physical redeemables, and.
00:02:03.832 - 00:02:05.470, Speaker A: Much more to their audience.
00:02:05.630 - 00:02:25.686, Speaker B: With the Galaxys launchpad, users will be able to define smart contract parameters, choose their utility traits and pre sale options, launch a website and community space, and deploy their NFT collection for sale with no coding required.

00:02:25.878 - 00:03:08.770, Speaker A: So let's get into the hard stuff. Banned what are the alternatives? Here are some headlines why Infuria cannot serve certain areas metamask is banning all wallets associated with iranian IP addresses now, you probably don't live in Iran, but if you do, well, you can't use Metamask. And this is because Infura, which is a US based. This is because consensus, which owns Metamask, is having to ban users connecting to Infura. Now, you can set up metamask to not connect to Infura, which is the RPC network, which most users use when they're interacting with Metamask. There are other ones that you can use. Eden is one, and the pocket network is another one, which is pretty good for getting around infuria.
00:03:08.770 - 00:03:25.626, Speaker A: These are things that are probably way above your pay grade and you're not interested in. But it also shines a light on the fact that we just kind of assume metamask is the one that we're going to use, because it's the one that we've always used. Now, metamaska was amazing. When it first came out, it was a browser extension that allowed you to interact with web3 protocols.
00:03:25.738 - 00:03:27.326, Speaker B: That was fresh, that was new.
00:03:27.428 - 00:04:00.598, Speaker A: But now, well, maybe it's time to put the old fox out to pasture. So we have tons and tons of wallets out there. We have the coinbase wallet, we have argin, we have trust, phantom, avalanche, rainbow, mew, formatic, terra station. Every chain has a native wallet, but they're not necessarily always the most fully featured. So we're moving to this exotic multi chain future. We've got wormholes, we've got rainbow bridges, we've got Defi, we've got nfts, we've got savings products, we've got a whole bunch of other stuff. We want our wallet to be able to do all of it.
00:04:00.598 - 00:04:35.678, Speaker A: Now, we're not there yet, but XDFI is really trying to be the thing that we need to connect to some of the major chains that we might be interacting with. We're talking thorchain, avalanche, binance, smart chain, if anybody uses that anymore. And terror, of course, allowing you to display your NFTs, but also allowing you to do very, very quick swaps. But abstract away all of that complicated stuff under the hood. You just press a button and it works. Is that too much to ask? Well, XDFI says no, so this is what it is. That's a wallet, basically, but it's so much more than that.
00:04:35.678 - 00:05:18.166, Speaker A: It's a multi chain web browser, basically. It's a wallet extension available on chrome and Brave and probably Firefox as well. But it has native integrations for thorchain, ethereum, and a bunch of EVM networks. And terra of course, and we cover Terra a lot on this channel, but it really is that chain that has so much exciting Defi being built on it. But again, so much of the other stuff that we want to do is on ETH. So those connections between ETH and Terra are really, really important. So at the moment, the XDFI wallet supports bitcoin, Ethereum, polygon, avalanche, binance, smart chain, binance chain, terra, thorchain, litecoin, bitcoin, cash, and it will support in the future Cosmos, Phantom, near, Polkadot, Solana, Xdai.
00:05:18.166 - 00:05:55.280, Speaker A: Looking at the list there, it's pretty clear that you'll probably have the likes of Elrond, Harmony, Algorand in the near future as well. It just feels like that's the list that should be there as well. So this is what it looks like. With NFTs, you can receive, store, and send cryptocurrencies. You can connect to decentralized applications, you can swap cryptocurrencies, you can access defi products. Kind of sounds like metamask, except the way it stores and displays NFTs is, I would say, a lot superior. But is it open source? No, not at the moment.
00:05:55.280 - 00:05:59.322, Speaker A: That does kind of make you sit up and take notice.
00:05:59.466 - 00:06:00.894, Speaker B: Is it necessarily a bad thing?
00:06:00.932 - 00:06:39.754, Speaker A: Well, no, probably not. The fact that it's not open source makes you think, well, what are they hiding? But at the same time, they're also building a product that they're looking to monetize, and it's very easy to fork this thing if it is open source. So plus, minus, I'm not sure there. There's also an xdfi coin. This is a fun looking graph, isn't it? Peaked at over $2, and now it's kind of heading towards $0.50. This is a pretty standard looking graph for a new token when it launches, and it's been around for a while. The XD five wallet itself has been around for a while.
00:06:39.792 - 00:06:40.618, Speaker B: I was actually going to cover it.
00:06:40.624 - 00:07:21.686, Speaker A: At the end of last year, and I didn't because there were some question marks around it. But I think it's been around long enough now for us to take a proper look and see if this is a replacement for Metamask. So that XDify token was designed by Delphi Digital. They're very bullish on XDFI, not necessarily saying that that's a good thing, but of the people involved in this space, I think they definitely got some smarts about them. So we've often talked about metamask having a mask token. Joe Lubin teased it at one point. Now it's worth bearing in mind that metamask only recently integrated the swap functionality into metamask.
00:07:21.686 - 00:07:40.174, Speaker A: I say only recently, it was relatively late in the product lifecycle. But that swap feature is generating an enormous amount of profit, around 330,000,000 or so up to October of last year. 330,000,000. That's not bad.
00:07:40.212 - 00:07:41.274, Speaker B: So the whole idea of a token.
00:07:41.322 - 00:08:18.358, Speaker A: Is it will return some of that value back to token holders. The more tokens you have, the more of the value comes back to you. And you can stake the token in a single sided vault that will enable you to earn extra perks and rebates on fees and also some fun nfts. And they look like this, these funky little octopi. Yes, Octopi is the plural of octopus. So here's a single sided staking. You stake XDFI token for a certain period of time, you get a lock multiplier, you earn rewards in XDFI and then you get these NFTs.
00:08:18.358 - 00:08:48.006, Speaker A: So 75% of fees generated from in wallet actions, I. E. Bridging and swapping, will be used to buy XDFI on the open market, and those XDFI tokens will be distributed to stakers. So nice constant flow of the token there. In the near term, these rewards will be supplemented by distributions from the XDFI wallet treasury until swap fee revenue reaches sufficient levels. So they're bootstrapping the staking system at the moment, you'll get a discount on fees. Each NFt you receive for staking comes with an amount of fee discount credits embedded within it.
00:08:48.006 - 00:09:18.960, Speaker A: This is kind of fun. These NFTs also come with these perks. You get credits which you can spend, you can spend them on other things, like custom wallet skins. Are we there already? There's voting rights in the governance system and access to a growing range of premium features and future community events, whatever that means, we will have to see. But certainly they've definitely thought about it. The token is embedded and it has a purpose, and if you are in that ecosystem, then those rewards will come back to you.
00:09:19.650 - 00:09:21.070, Speaker B: So that's kind of how it works.
00:09:21.140 - 00:09:39.880, Speaker A: What we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and set up the wallet and take a look at some of the features that you can find within the wallet itself. So let's go ahead and do that. So the first place we're going to look is the XDFI website. It says it's the fastest wallet in Defi. I didn't do a test here. Big claim, big words. I'm not sure.
00:09:39.880 - 00:10:05.390, Speaker A: Get an edge with the number one wallet for Defi. You can see that they're big on the language here. And we also have some other things connect to the best of defi. What else do we have here? Bill for nfts power up with automation. Yeah, there's a bunch of fun features in here, but what we want to do is go to add to chrome. I'm actually using brave, but it's the same basic system. Add to brave and then add extension.
00:10:05.390 - 00:10:23.520, Speaker A: That will go ahead and then install that extension into your browser. So what I want to do now is go ahead and make sure I pin it like this. And now we can go ahead and set it up. So here's how we do it. Click on. Let's get started. A page will open up.
00:10:23.520 - 00:11:04.296, Speaker A: We need to agree to the terms and conditions and I'm actually going to restore an xdfi wallet. But creating an XDFI wallet will basically be the same thing, except it will spit out a seed phrase which you will then need to write down and then use that to set up and confirm that you want to have that wallet. You can connect a hardware wallet as well. Trezor and Ledger are supported. So I'm just going to go ahead and restore the wallet I set up earlier. So now it says, do you want to make this your default browser wallet? So this will mean that whenever you connect to a web3 application could be openc, it could be other, whatever you want to connect to. It will first go to the XD five wallet.
00:11:04.296 - 00:11:23.060, Speaker A: Now, turning this on doesn't really mean very much. You can very easily turn it off and we'll go ahead and do that in a bit. But we're going to say yes and then click on next. So then it will say confirm which chains you want to use with XDFI. So you have a list of all these chains here. Let's say you might not use binance at all. You don't want it there.
00:11:23.060 - 00:11:42.568, Speaker A: Binance smart chain, that's fine. Again, we can go ahead and set that up and we can change it all later on if we want to. So now it says you may open the extension. So here's what we're going to do. Welcome to XDFI wallet. Thank you. Happy to be here.
00:11:42.568 - 00:12:12.020, Speaker A: So first thing we're going to do is look in this window up here. So we have networks that we can connect to Ethereum, Binance, smart chain, Polygon and avalanche. You'll notice you don't have the likes of Terra in there as well. And this is. I'm not sure exactly why this is, but it's saying select which network to inject in window Ethereum. This will signal to the blockchain app which network you want to use with it. Not entirely sure what's going on here, but it doesn't seem to make a difference because I connect to Terra apps, for instance, and it works just fine.
00:12:12.020 - 00:12:29.272, Speaker A: You'll see a red dot here. This means you're not connected to a website or an app. This will go green when we do. So that's the first thing you wanted to look at there. Next thing we can look at is the assets here. So we have a list of assets. If we want to add a new one, click on the add assets button.
00:12:29.272 - 00:12:56.912, Speaker A: And then there's just an absolutely absurd number of assets in here that we could add to the wallet. So let's say I wanted to add basic attention token because I'm on brave next confirm. And now it's added simple. Simple. What's also nice is you can pin that asset to the top if you wanted to. So if there's one that you use in particular, you can pin that nice and easily. You'll notice here next to XDFI, there's a stake button.
00:12:56.912 - 00:13:17.848, Speaker A: This will open up the staking dashboard. Here it is. If you want to stake directly, you can. You'd obviously have to connect the wallet first. So what else can we look at in here? These three dots next to the asset. This gives you some options here you can go to the block explorer, copy the chain address or unpin from top. We're going to do that.
00:13:17.934 - 00:13:18.984, Speaker B: But actually, if we go down to.
00:13:19.022 - 00:13:55.460, Speaker A: UST, which it says is on the terra network, gives you another option, deposit and earn. So here we can actually deposit directly into anchor and earn the anchor interest rate directly from within. XDFI takes a little moment to set it up, but this is basically just the wallet connecting to anchor under the hood and allowing you to deposit. So here you can see we have the very simple anchor protocol interface. We can deposit, we can withdraw. It gives us the current APY and that's that. You don't have to touch anchor, you can just deposit directly from within the app.
00:13:55.460 - 00:14:45.876, Speaker A: And I think when they have the Orion protocol integration as well, there'll be another way to do that. But it's very, very straightforward and it's straight in the wallet, which is nice. So what else can we look at? So up here we've got some menu items we've got the wallet management, so we can connect to a hardware wallet, we can import a wallet and you can import your metamask wallet and you can import your terra station wallet. There's actually some handy information here on the XDFI medium about migrating from metamask to XDFI and migrating from terra station to XDFI, but really it's very, very simple. All you need is your seed phrase and that's it. And you can be set up with your metamask wallet directly within xdfi in less than a minute. So very very simple to do.
00:14:45.876 - 00:15:09.784, Speaker A: I will leave the links for those documents in the description below. Let's carry on. Just a few more things to look at. So here we have that prioritize xdfi button. This will just make it XDFI, the priority wallet, the same way that you would with your browser, which one you want to use. We have dart mode. Let's keep it on dart mode.
00:15:09.784 - 00:15:31.940, Speaker A: Everybody loves dart mode. What else do we have? So settings is where we want to look. Require password for transactions. We've got an auto lock feature. That's nice. We've got some RPC and node URLs we can set up if we want to. So we can click on here and then set some custom RPCs if you want to go further into wallet functionality.
00:15:31.940 - 00:15:58.556, Speaker A: We also have DaPPs permission management. So there'll be a list of dapps here that we're connected to. You can revoke those permissions very, very easily in there. You can change your currency, you can hide balances below a certain amount. So all that dust that you might have in a wallet, you can hide that. And then chain management, that's the really interesting one. So here we have all the chains, we can move them around as you can see here, and then we can set binance, BCH and litecoin to on.
00:15:58.556 - 00:16:34.948, Speaker A: So now we have all the chains on. But here's something weird. If I turn off Ethereum, polygon, avalanche and BSE go as well. Isn't that weird? If I turn off avalanche, same thing happens. So I'm not entirely sure what's going on there. But hey, there you go, there's a list of all the chains, and there will be more chains coming as well. So it's not just the ability to house assets on that chain within the wallet, but also we're going to see more and more functionality and things that we can do on those chains built into XDFI.
00:16:34.948 - 00:17:08.000, Speaker A: So XDFI becomes this portal hub for your defi and NFT activities. One last thing we're going to do. I'm going to go to mirror, which is a synthetic asset exchange for Terra. And here if we go to my page, we can connect to a wallet. We have the XDFI wallet, so let's go ahead and do that. So we can go ahead now and connect to the XDFI wallet. This will pop up and I say select this account, click next and connect.
00:17:08.000 - 00:17:52.008, Speaker A: And now if we go to the XDFI wallet up here, you'll see a little green light to say that yes, this wallet is now connected to mirror and that is basically how it works. Now, it's not by any means perfect. There is a lot of things that it will hopefully start to be able to do, but my overall impression is it's a nice wallet to use. It's fast. And one of the fun things I didn't show you is if I go to the send Ethereum page here you have this ape mode. You can go max gas on the ape mode button, so you can click that on and you go full ape. Isn't that fun? So that was the XT five wallet.
00:17:52.008 - 00:17:59.540, Speaker A: If you have any suggestions for us to cover in tutorials, do drop them in the comments below. And until next time, be safe out there. Peace.
