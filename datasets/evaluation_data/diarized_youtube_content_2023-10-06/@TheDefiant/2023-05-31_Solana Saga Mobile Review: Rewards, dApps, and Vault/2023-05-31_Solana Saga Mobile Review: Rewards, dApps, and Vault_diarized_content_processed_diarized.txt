00:00:23.050 - 00:01:01.902, Speaker A: This is the Solana saga. It's an Android phone produced by Solana's mobile arms that costs $1,000. Saga was first announced on June 23 of last year, and less than a year later. They've already begun shipping quite an impressive delivery time in crypto terms, but this should be no surprise, since the cofounder of Solana has over a decade of experience working at Qualcomm, so he knows a thing or two about mobile products. The saga aims to become a crucial stepping stone in bringing web3 into to our pockets. Users of the Salana chain can use the Saga to buy and sell nfts, sign transactions and self custody assets on the go through biometric solutions. I've been playing around with it for a week now, and it's pretty neat stuff.
00:01:01.902 - 00:01:49.600, Speaker A: So let's dive into why this saga could be a total game changer for web3 adoption, and whether or not it could survive a drop test. The unboxing experience is pretty sleek. The saga comes with a SIM tray, ejector, quick start guide, seed phrase recovery sheet, and a USB typec cable with a switch that, once turned on, disables data transfer capabilities. The saga is designed and manufactured by awesome, which is a leading Android development company whose team has extensive experience building computing hardware for Google, Apple, intel and others. It turns out the Saga is a rebrand of Awesome's ov one, o for awesome and v for vault. So privacy and security has been integral to the phone from the get go. And if you think I'm mispronouncing awesome, just check this out.
00:01:49.600 - 00:02:23.270, Speaker A: The saga includes a 6.67 inch OLED display with a peak refresh rate of 120. Back you'll find a 50 megapixel main and twelve megapixel ultra wide dual camera system, plus a 16 megapixel selfie camera. You also get a rear fingerprint sensor. The build quality is impressive. Saga has a solid, sturdy feel with a stainless steel frame, ceramic backing, and a titanium housing. It weighs 247 grams, which makes it heavier than an iPhone 14 Pro Max or the Galaxy S 23 Ultra.
00:02:23.270 - 00:03:06.358, Speaker A: It comes with twelve gigs of ram, 512 gig storage, dual SIM, and the snapdragon eight plus gen one processor. This particular processor comes with a number of security features such as the trusted execution environment, trust zone, and the secure processing unit. These features are crucial for the web3 elements which we're about to get into. There are a couple of reasons why this phone is unlike any other Android phone. First reason is the seed vault. The seed vault is a security protocol that safeguards your keys against unauthorized access by using biometrics and password protection. Together with hardware assisted key encryption, it keeps your private keys and seed phrases isolated from the application layer and the operating system.
00:03:06.358 - 00:03:40.990, Speaker A: It's almost like a cold wallet that lives inside the phone. But unlike a cold wallet, you can easily approve and sign transactions, move nfds and link dapps to your wallet using just your fingerprint. Another unique component of the saga is the DAP store. It currently has 27 dapps across various crypto subcategories such as wallets, nfDs, DFI, staking games, and social. Here's something neat. Inside the DAP store, all early saga users are greeted with a welcome pack to get started. First thing you can claim is the Saga Genesis token, which is a nontransferable NFD for saga owners that gives access to saga rewards.
00:03:40.990 - 00:04:27.862, Speaker A: You're also eligible for 20 USDC 0.1 soul and an opportunity to win a Kleino NFD from the new 2000 piece Kleinosaurs Call of Saga collection. But hold on, we're just getting started. The NFT Marketplace Magic Eden drops another 25 USDC to your wallet music streaming platform audience provides a selection of music gated by the Saga Genesis token. The messaging platform dialect gives you some free stickers, and Solana's play to earn game Honeyland gives you 50 HXD and an automatic bemium upgrade. It's a sweet selection of welcome gifts, but let's have a closer look at a couple of dapps I first tried Jupiter to swap some of the USDC I received for Soul tokens. After connecting my wallet and entering the desired amount, I hit swap and Jupiter brought up the wallet, and the wallet summoned the seed bolt.
00:04:27.862 - 00:04:45.240, Speaker A: Then I used my fingerprint to approve the transaction. The experience was seamless, cheap, and fast. Later, I checked out Minty fresh, which is a Dap that allows you to mint nfts from your photo album. Conveniently, Jack had captured a selfie, so I decided to mint that again. Very cheap, very fast.
00:04:46.570 - 00:04:56.490, Speaker B: Oh my God. Tapping again. Solano blockchain has been halted.
00:04:59.230 - 00:05:31.830, Speaker A: Okay, it's time to address the elephant in the room. Solana's had a rocky 2023 so far, and even rougher 2022. There are concerns that Solana is centralized, and on several occasions it's experienced outages. So these are definitely not optimal qualities to have as a blockchain, particularly when you produce a phone that runs on it. But let's put that aside for now and focus primarily on the saga and not the blockchain. First, they don't ship it with the latest version of the Qualcomm Snapdragon processor. It shouldn't be a deal breaker, but with a premium price tag, you would expect it to come with the latest tech.
00:05:31.830 - 00:06:01.258, Speaker A: The saga is essentially a first of its kind, so another drawback might be that it's too early. The current selection of dapps are a bit limited, so there's room to grow. Occasionally, apps can be unresponsive and crash. One of the games is even missing an icon. Needless to say, the saga is still in an experimental phase. On the bright side, progress is being made. Five more dapps have made their way into the DAP store since I received the Saga two weeks ago, and with the Solana mobile stack, I'm pretty sure developers will be keen to try out web3 native mobile experiences.
00:06:01.258 - 00:06:41.850, Speaker A: Also, the reality is that the saga started off as an Android phone and later took a uturn to be reconceptualized as a device with web3 components. So it's not truly a web3 native device, but at least as a piece of hardware, it's a solid device. But how durable is it? Rather than consulting a psychic octopus, we decided to put out a tweet. We wanted to let the people decide the height of the drop and oh boy, that tweet blew up. Retweets, likes, comments, the whole shebang. So I asked Jack to participate in the experiment. He graciously accepted my offer, decided to cast his vertigo aside, hoist his courage, and ascend to the picotop of a familiar towering structure.
00:06:41.850 - 00:07:04.322, Speaker A: No, not the birch Khalifa. We're talking birch Solana. Now it's time for the drop. Look at that. It made the dead cat bounce. Very good, very good. So who's the saga for? Obviously, if you're a Solana Maxi, you're going to love it.
00:07:04.322 - 00:07:59.238, Speaker A: If you're a daily user of the Solana chain, if you're a staker, a bag holder, you want to mint photos on the go. Or maybe you're just a noob who wants to get into crypto in a fun, easy way on an affordable chain and you have $1,000 laying around, then you should go for it. Bringing web3 to phones is a no brainer. So much of our lives revolve around mobile devices, and yet web3 experiences are so far behind on mobile signing transactions. Trading on chain minting nfts and claiming rewards through a mobile phone is really awesome. So, back to our question. Is this the web3 phone we needed? Well, to be fair, it's more like a web two phone with a web3 component, but it most certainly feels like a step in the right direction and makes us question what would a truly native web3 phone look like? While it's certainly on the horizon, we can safely say it probably won't be like the Virtu web3 phone, and if you want us to review that one, let us know in the comments below.
00:07:59.238 - 00:08:00.600, Speaker A: Until next time.
00:08:18.650 - 00:08:19.480, Speaker B: I look.
00:08:24.450 - 00:08:25.660, Speaker A: Keep it there, keep it there.
