00:00:01.770 - 00:00:15.166, Speaker A: Meet George. George is a highly neurotic member of the DeFi community. He aspires to become a degen and believes he will make it someday. We are going to make it. He tweets and whispers to himself every day.
00:00:15.348 - 00:00:23.070, Speaker B: But George is, sadly not going to make it. He spread himself thin. He's way too distracted.
00:00:25.370 - 00:00:45.180, Speaker C: It the world of DFI can be chaotic and stressful. You might find yourself pondering about your next move, chasing the next ten X, hundred X, a thousand X. And at the end, you've made no progress. Fallen victim to inertia. To make the move, you need information. And information is everywhere. You need to organize the information before making any sense of it.
00:00:45.180 - 00:01:12.560, Speaker C: In Defi, there's constantly a new update, a new launch, a new yield, farm, liquidations, rugs, users, billions going in and out. It's endless and honestly exhausting to keep up with. And it doesn't end there. It's the multiple screens, charts, tables, dashboards, countless tabs, discord channels, Twitter accounts, telegram, bots, notifications. Here, here, here, here and there. It's easy to get lost in the noise. But also, who can you even trust?
00:01:13.010 - 00:01:15.622, Speaker B: Imagine combining all of that on one page.
00:01:15.676 - 00:01:20.130, Speaker A: Everything neatly organized, displaying all encompassing defi data across all chains.
00:01:20.210 - 00:01:21.410, Speaker B: Reliable and timely.
00:01:21.490 - 00:01:32.038, Speaker A: Customizable charts, tables with historical data including for yields, users, TvL volume, real time news and an exclusive user only chat where you discuss alpha live on the spot.
00:01:32.214 - 00:01:43.294, Speaker B: However, this isn't only about data. This is about illuminating the unknown. The Wild west. The frontier. We're arming those who dare venture into the forefront of finance with the most.
00:01:43.332 - 00:01:45.680, Speaker A: Powerful weapon of all information.
00:01:47.170 - 00:01:52.160, Speaker C: After all, the right information, in the right hands can make all the difference in the world.
00:01:55.730 - 00:02:02.318, Speaker A: Information is power. The defiant helps you seize it. Now. There you go, George. It's in your hands now.
00:02:02.484 - 00:02:04.334, Speaker B: You are going to make.
