00:00:18.970 - 00:01:18.486, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, welcome to another edition of our weekly recap. This. This week we're having a really special edition where we're joined by Amit Gajala, who is the co founder of Stada Labs, Daniel Dezon, founder of Swell Networks, and Ken, head of institutional sales at Pendle. And we're going to be diving into one of the, I'd say the hottest sector this year in DeFi, which is liquid staking, and LSDFI, which essentially refers to protocols that are building on top of liquid staking tokens to help traders kind of manage risk, boost yields, and do all sorts of crazy stuff. So before we dive into that, we're going to start with a quick overview of how Ethereum got here in the first place. It's been quite a long road. Ethereum turned eight last month.
00:01:18.486 - 00:01:55.534, Speaker A: So, yeah, a lot of great stuff planned for the stream. And before we get started, we'd like to thank our sponsor bumper. It's the DeFi protocol that lets you defend your crypto from market crashes and downside volatility. And that's probably something that might have come in handy yesterday. I hope everyone escaped unscathed after the carnage we had yesterday. And so let's dive right in. All right, so taking us back right to the beginning.
00:01:55.534 - 00:03:05.510, Speaker A: So what is Ethereum? Ethereum is a public blockchain, of course, that enables the execution of smart contracts. Most of us have used it. And how is it different from a centralized exchange or any centralized database? It's basically a global network of computers that are working together and they need to reach consensus and say that, okay, a transaction is valid or not. And if it is, it's appended to the end of the blockchain. Can't be changed after that. That's the whole concept of immutability, and that's how blockchains work. Of course, Ethereum started out very similar to bitcoin, with a proof of work consensus algorithm, in which miners, which are essentially computers, running pieces of software that try and crunch these incredibly complex mathematical problems in order to earn rewards, right? And in this era, of course, Ethereum was emitting new ETH every block as rewards to these miners.
00:03:05.510 - 00:04:37.874, Speaker A: And one of the main challenges of this algorithm, of course, is the environmental impact, right? Because the energy consumption was going off the charts, especially back in 2021, during the bull market, I think we had daily comparisons of which country's Ethereum's consumption was crossing, right? So obviously something needed to be done. And I think it also had a big impact in terms of institutional interests, because a lot of institutions have ESG mandates, so they don't invest in dirty tech, oil and gas, stuff like that. I'm sure that also played into the Ethereum foundation and the community's decision to switch away from proof of work to proof of stake. And actually, before we move on, you can see from the chart that since the transition, there's been roughly 2000 x, I think, or one 2000 the power consumption now, as we had under proof of work. So that's quite amazing. So of course, Ethereum 2.0, which is a name that we don't use anymore, but back then that was the buzword, right? So the idea was that Ethereum would switch from proof of work to proof of stake.
00:04:37.874 - 00:05:47.146, Speaker A: The idea being that after running for so many years, ether as a token was sufficiently decentralized, like enough holders had it, and it was time to switch to a new mechanism by which people who held ETH could stake it and run validators themselves in order to secure the network. Process transactions basically take on the role that miners had until this point. So, with a lot of fanfare, just before the bull market actually kicked off in earnest, we had the beacon chain launch in December 2020. And I remember it well, because that was when DFI tokens were just bleeding and everyone thought the sector was dead. And of course, as we know now, the first half of 2021 for OG D five was a sight to behold. And who knows if we're ever going to see those kind of runs for those tokens again? But anyway, I digress. Just memories, right?
00:05:47.248 - 00:05:47.900, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:49.390 - 00:06:29.514, Speaker A: So the beacon chain launched in December 2020, and at the time it was basically a one way streets. You could stake your ETH, but you had no way of knowing when or if, not if, it was always on the roadmap. But you had no way of knowing when you'd be able to withdraw that ETH, because at the time, there was no timeline given. It was quite nebulous. And Ethereum has faced a lot of delays in the past, so it was a real leap of faith for those who decided to, as soon as it went live, let's take it was the true believers, I'd say, who took the leap and said, all right, we trust in Vitalik, let's go for it.
00:06:29.552 - 00:06:30.140, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:32.350 - 00:07:36.894, Speaker A: So this gave rise to the whole concept of liquid staking and the industry as a whole, I'd say, with the launch of Lido, which launched just a few weeks after the beacon chain went live. And this solved two problems. One, it took away the need for people to have the technical knowledge to run a node themselves, which is not a casual undertaking even today, I'd say. And why is this important? It's because if you are running a node and you have your ETH staked, if your node goes down and you have issues and you have downtime, you get slashed, you essentially lose money. Your staked ETH is at risk if your node is not up to par, essentially. So that was one challenge, and the main challenge, of course, was that people wanted access to their liquidity. Since withdrawals from the beacon chain weren't enabled, Lido gave people a way to essentially have their cake and eat it too.
00:07:36.894 - 00:08:44.340, Speaker A: Right? So they could participate in securing Ethereum, while at the same time they'd get this kind of receipt token representing their stake teeth, called stake teeth, I guess, which was liquid and could be deployed across Defi and used. I mean, today it's almost, I'd say, equivalent to using ETH across defi with the amount of integrations that Lido has managed to put together. But back then it was still a niche. And even as late as last year, when three arrows collapsed and there was a slight deepging event of stake teeth, it caused a lot of fud around the whole liquid staking industry, I'd say. Right. That was last summer was quite brutal for the markets. Compared to then, we're still two x higher in terms of ETH and bitcoin, I'd say so.
00:08:44.340 - 00:09:38.194, Speaker A: All right. And of course we had the Shanghai upgrade that finally enabled withdrawals for the first time. This happened in April, and the liquid staking industry, I think, really took off after this happened because this took away one of the main risk factors that were associated with liquid staking. Meaning could you actually get your ETH back at some point if you wanted it? Right. And with the Chappella upgrade and withdrawals going live, that was taken out of the equation because it didn't happen immediately. But I think over the next weeks, all the major liquid staking providers started to introduce functionality to kind of get your ETH back. Redemption started to be enabled.
00:09:38.194 - 00:10:33.238, Speaker A: And that, I think, gave people a lot more confidence to use these providers. And we can see that in the Lido TvL chart. Right, so this is denominated in ETH because I thought it will give a better idea rather than a dollar chart, which shows the TVL down here somewhere. But you can see that in terms of ETH, it's just been straight up. Except for when we had the terra collapse. I mean, that battered, I think, every protocol because the contagion effect was so much because a stablecoin vanishing means you had people who got liquidated on positions where they had borrowed USD against, say, ETH and other things. And that really took the industry back quite a while.
00:10:33.238 - 00:11:19.640, Speaker A: I think it took the industry quite a while to recover from that. So we had the Ustvag, but again, after that it's just been straight up and to the right. And after Shanghai, you can see it's gone through the roof, essentially. Which brings us to the current state of liquid staking, where there's about 20 billion worth of ETH staked through liquid staking protocols. But this pie chart also gives us a recent pause. Right. You can see Lido has nearly three quarters of the market, which is of course a concern being DFI, we value decentralization above almost everything.
00:11:19.640 - 00:11:40.090, Speaker A: So today we're going to be speaking to some of the guys who are looking to, I guess, take a piece of the pie away from Lido. And I think let's start with Daniel. If you'd like to talk about what you guys are building at Swell network.
00:11:41.390 - 00:12:07.602, Speaker C: Yeah, sure thing. Thanks for having me on. My name is Daniel. I'm the founder of Swell Swell is an up and coming Ethereum liquid staking protocol. Yeah, quite right. Agree with the overall assessment here. It's incredibly important that we maintain a diverse and decentralized liquid staking market that sort of preserves the underlying decentralization, security and value of ethereum.
00:12:07.602 - 00:13:09.494, Speaker C: And it's also incredibly sort of optimistic to see just the rise and rise of liquid staking and the derisking of staking writ large. Post Chappella and we can see that in the chart moving post Chappella in April of this year that there has been more validators coming online. The queue is still, I think, about 25 days to get in and there's virtually nothing to get out. So there's just been a massive demand for elliptical staking and we've been a real beneficiary of that. So we've been live on main net since about April of this year, late April. So just a touch over three months. And we're one of the fastest growing protocols in DeFI and we're really trying to be a base layer and accelerate for what is now the biggest category in DFI, which is liquid staking overall, and quite rightly pointed out that the industry generally is a valuation of about 20 billion.
00:13:09.494 - 00:14:00.630, Speaker C: I'm not sure what the latest is at the moment, just with the quotational drop in Ethereum recently, but with swell network in particular over the past three months, we've been able to secure just over 45,000 each state with more than 10,000 unique depositors. And we've been really buoyed by this particular campaign called the Voyage, which is, in summary, a pre token airdrop campaign for people to get involved and to reward early adopters and stakers into our ecosystem. And that ecosystem of our LFT, which is sweeth or swell ether has been increasingly and rapidly integrated within the DeFi ecosystem. And yeah, very excited to share more about swell and talk all things liquid staking with you all cool.
00:14:00.780 - 00:14:20.080, Speaker D: I'm kind of know we saw that pie chart, how for the most part, centralized it is. What's to stop swell from becoming the next lido? And then if you guys do have that type of supremacy in the marketplace, how would you introduce sort of layers of decentralization within the organization in terms of the protocol level?
00:14:21.170 - 00:15:31.422, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's a great question, and it's a question that has to be answered in a holistic fashion between the social layer, I e. Layer zero, or the social consensus, as well as just generalized market forces. Quite rightly, that there is potentially an unacceptable share of market from Lido. But by the same token, Lido's also paved the way for liquid staking protocols, generally speaking, in avoiding situation where we had market share captures from centralized exchanges. But by the same token, there is a situation wherein any particular protocol that has a certain share of market may be a risk to Ethereum, and there's been various sort of thresholds placed upon that. So, for example, one of the seminal pieces came out of Danny Ryan, who said no particular protocol or should have more than 25% lighter, is already well passed. That on the cusp of a 33% threshold.
00:15:31.422 - 00:16:18.690, Speaker C: And there's other thresholds of 51% and 56%. But by the same token, for new and up and coming protocols like Swell and others who have recently come to the fore, I think that's important from a market competitive standpoint. And I think that we are far and ways from achieving that particular share of market, largely because of the fact that there are these inherent flywheels and flywheels which lead to some of these power law distributions amongst liquid staking protocols. And there is always this sort of counteracting force between public and private interests in the sense that do LDo token holders, how do their interests relate with stakeholders? Relay with estakers, relay with Ethereum, writ large, relay with the entire blockchain ecosystem.
00:16:20.550 - 00:16:21.460, Speaker D: Oh, go.
00:16:22.090 - 00:16:26.198, Speaker C: Yeah, feel free to jump in anytime. Tell me if I'm sort of just rambling on here.
00:16:26.364 - 00:16:35.420, Speaker D: I would follow that up by asking then in that case, in terms of incentive stack, can you do to build towards that from here?
00:16:35.870 - 00:17:28.006, Speaker C: Yeah, this is a question. How does one appropriately utilize sort of commercial incentives or economic incentives and disincentives to try to drive new estate and current estate to shake that out, to bring it to newer protocols, I. E. Protocols like swell. And one of the techniques that we've done in the early stages of our voyage, just tldr the voyage, is our early token campaign. We're going to do like several chapters of seasons, which will then lead to the instantiation of the Dow or our TGE. We've calmed out a portion of our overall supply to early stakers, and then as a result, we're able to offer a higher blended yield because at the base layer, the staking rate is largely commoditized because it's just issuance from the Ethereum blockchain for staking.
00:17:28.006 - 00:18:23.930, Speaker C: But there is that component where you can give and bootstrap your stakers with the governance token and at the same time try to drive as much utility and integrations as possible. And we try to do that. We have folks like Pendle here on this call, who's been a major sort of collaborator with swell. And together by enabling that lftfi stack with sweeth and the yield trading components and sort of the balancer or pendle sort of stack and then going through to equilibrium and penpi, there are sorts of interesting sort of daisy chain of yield plays. If people want to do that particular thing, you can carve out a bit of a section of the market for yourself. But by the same mean, there are other things that one could do as a protocol as well. And there are various levels of aggression, but it's just about the timing, sequencing thereof.
00:18:24.370 - 00:18:45.074, Speaker A: Interesting, interesting. I'd like to turn it over to Amit now to talk a little bit about ethX. And then a general question for both of you being how is your product different from, say, lidos or rocket pools? Who are the current leaders in the market? Right, sure.
00:18:45.192 - 00:19:09.754, Speaker E: So quick. Thanks a lot, guys, for having us here. My name is Amit. I'm one of the co founders of Stator. So stator has been a multichain liquid staking protocol. We currently are about 140,000,000 total assets staked across several blockchains. We're one of the market leaders on polygon, and we started our journey on Terra 1.0,
00:19:09.754 - 00:19:54.998, Speaker E: had about a billion dollars in TVL, and then after the collapse, we aggressively expanded to several chains. We are very early entrenched in Ethereum, just launched about a month ago, have about 15K each staked with us with several integrations across curve, balancer, wombat, pancake, pendle, et cetera. Growing pretty quickly. So that's a little bit about Stader. And etex is our liquid staking token on Ethereum blockchain. It's a reward bearing token that kind of increases in price every time rewards are accumulated quickly. Talking about the I think that's probably a good segue into your question, YVC.
00:19:54.998 - 00:20:53.150, Speaker E: How are we different from the existing players in the ecosystem? So etex is a very different architecture, which is a combination of the way I look at etex is. It's a two sided marketplace. On one side you have the liquid stakers that can stake any amount of ETH to get etex, which kind of increases in price as rewards are accumulated. On the other hand, on the other side of the marketplace is these node operators. They can be like any type of node operators, professional node operators, or small and medium sized node operators who want to just run Ethereum validators. The fundamental premise with which etex was born was that we want to create access to these small and medium sized node operators. Because if you look at the landscape, the entry barrier or the capital entry barrier for these node operators is significantly higher in the market.
00:20:53.150 - 00:21:13.170, Speaker E: For a solo staker, it's about 32 E. And ignoring the price drop over today and yesterday, that's roughly about $64,000, right? And ETH is at $2,000, which is a significantly high barrier to entry for anybody to start an ethereum validator. Even some of the other protocols.
00:21:15.030 - 00:21:15.394, Speaker C: That.
00:21:15.432 - 00:21:58.514, Speaker E: Allow permissionless node operators, they had a barrier of about 16 ETH. Now I think they have close to 4.10.4 E, which is again a significantly high barrier to entry, which is probably close to 25,000 oD. Now imagine somebody who wants to run ten nodes. He has to cough up like 250K worth of capital on his own. One can imagine how difficult or hard it is for somebody to start at least a small number of nodes. So that was one of the biggest things that we wanted to solve in the ecosystem, where we reduced capital barriers to entry to almost just 4.4
00:21:58.514 - 00:22:49.490, Speaker E: e, where four ETH is the actual ETH that they need to bond, and 0.4 E is the amount of SD tokens that they need to bond. SD is our governance token. The second problem that a lot of these node operators face is they don't want exposure to any other token other than ETH. So we wanted to bring that down as much as we can, while we also creating some utility as well as downside protection for any kind of negative slashing events, et cetera. So that's the fundamental premise of where we started with Ethex, as we started thinking about this sooner than later, when we are all here to kind of support decentralization and crypto, right? This means a lot of permissionless node operators can just like Bond 4.4 E and start running validators.
00:22:49.490 - 00:23:50.310, Speaker E: So we are creating access then. The advantage of this is obviously now we can invite hundreds of permissionless node operators. We already have about 400 plus validators, 130 plus permissionless node unique permissionless node operators that are operating nodes with stator at already. Sooner than later we are going to hit a supply block or a supply wall in terms of scaling the permissionless operators. That's where we have this multipool architecture where we also have a set of high quality operators who can spin up hundreds of nodes without any type of collateral. So while on one hand we have this pool of permissionless node operators who can just borrow 4.4 e and start running validators once this supply hits a ceiling, we also have a fallback mechanism onto these permission side of node operators, right? We have four to five operators already on board running nodes.
00:23:50.310 - 00:24:28.580, Speaker E: Just adding further extension to this. The beauty of what we've built is now this can be extended to several. Currently we have two pools. This can be extended to multiple pools. Tomorrow, if you want, we can spin up a pool where only KYC operators and KYC users can deposit and run nodes can extend this to an institution that wants to run a liquid staking pool of its own without mining link funds with anybody else. So this is kind of a general idea of etex and the underlying architecture that we've built, and it's quite different from the existing architectures in the.
00:24:30.470 - 00:25:10.218, Speaker A: Amazing. Thanks. Thanks for that overview. I think that makes a lot of sense as think like you said and Daniel too, Lido kind of paved the way for the liquid staking sector. They started off with fully permissioned, only their operators can run nodes, et cetera. And then we're seeing progressive decentralization of that stack where different projects are taking different approaches and trying to give users the best options, all types of users. Like you said, whether you have a ton of capital or very little, you should be able to participate.
00:25:10.218 - 00:25:38.380, Speaker A: That's the end goal. So I'd like to ask Ken now to introduce himself and talk a little bit about Pendrel which has been around for a long time, but I think really took off after the LST boom. And even before that, I think your marketing shift from option trading, yield trading to buying assets at a discount, I think that made it a lot simpler for dgens to kind of understand what you guys are doing.
00:25:39.950 - 00:26:38.250, Speaker F: Yeah, happy to start. So my name is Ken. I hit the institutional business at Pendle, and basically what that means is I reach out to different types of institutions, including liquid yield funds, centralized exchanges, wallets and so forth, to deploy different types of DFI strategies using pendle markets. I think, yeah, you hit the nail on the hit. We've been around since 2021 and spent the first couple of years building the EMM in our V one, and only launched our V two in November last year. Since then, we've been, I would say, quite fortunate to be a central part of the LSTFI narrative. Having said that, we are not an lsdfi protocol.
00:26:38.250 - 00:27:29.622, Speaker F: In fact, we are a fixed rates or yield train protocol. And to what you mentioned earlier, assets had a discount or yield training protocol. They're basically, I guess, two sides of the same coin, and we've been experimenting with different narratives for different target audiences. And essentially the problem that we're solving in DeFi is that the fact that in DeFi, most yields are essentially spot or floating, and that there's no fixed rates markets. So Pendle is a fixed rates markets. If you look at Tratfi, the closest analog would be the swaps markets, or specifically the interest rate swaps markets between fixed and floating rates. And we basically provide such markets for any asset that is yield generating in DFI.
00:27:29.622 - 00:28:01.560, Speaker F: What's been working very well for us since our V two launch in November has been a lot of different types of LSD tokens, as well as non LC tokens, including revenue generating LP tokens from GMX or gain straight. But having said that, the LSE space is a very important part of the vertical to Pendle. It makes up more than 50% of our TVL. Yeah, and very excited to chat more about the space. Awesome.
00:28:02.010 - 00:28:57.062, Speaker B: It's exciting. I found out about swaps maybe a year ago, so I understand its importance. As a crypto native, I didn't quite understand its importance, but realizing that it's a very important tool in tradfi was eye opening when I read that article and made the connection. So it'll be exciting to see how you guys do. I mean, it's definitely a little, you need a little more sophistication, I think, to enter the swaps arena. And I think with a lot of these LSTFI products, I think generally we are waiting for Defi to become simpler, but I almost think it's going to become more complicated as kind of the basic building blocks have been built out. And now you're starting to play with yield, which I feel like is a more sophisticated realm of the market.
00:28:57.062 - 00:28:58.860, Speaker B: I don't know what you guys think about that.
00:28:59.630 - 00:29:46.402, Speaker F: No, exactly. I totally agree. I think especially with estaking yields now essentially serving as, quote unquote, the risk free rate in Defi and LSD is essentially taking that yield and making it obviously very liquid. But what is lacking sorely in the space is a term structure or a yield curve. In DeFi, everything spot, everything fluctuates from day to day depending on utilization and staking, withdrawal rates and so forth. But I think if, say, ethereum, the network can issue a yield curve per se, we can sort of let the market imply one via swaps market. So that's kind of the goal or the angle for us with regards to LSDs.
00:29:46.546 - 00:30:21.330, Speaker A: Right. I think that makes a lot of sense because institutions don't want to deploy money day to day. Right. If you're raising a fund, you generally have a longer time frame and want to deploy capital at a fixed yield. You want something that's predictable, and we don't have that in DeFi. Right. So as the industry matures and we move more from your day trading degens to hopefully more sophisticated long term investors.
00:30:21.330 - 00:30:41.740, Speaker A: Yeah. These products are required, I'd say. They form such a huge portion of traditional finance swaps. And I think forex, of course, is another huge market that DeFi hasn't quite cracked yet. But when it does, that's going to be the next meta, probably, I think.
00:30:42.750 - 00:31:04.340, Speaker B: And sorry, I know we're asking Ken a lot of questions, but Ken, could you explain, just like super, like I'm five, how do you get a fixed rate out of a variable rate like the one associated with staked ETH? For someone who maybe has taken a calculus class or something, but not much else, yeah.
00:31:05.190 - 00:31:48.750, Speaker F: I think the easiest way to think about it is to first understand the components within. Have to. Essentially we split the principal and yield portion of a yield bearing asset. Let's take Lido's teeth, for example, into principal and yield. So PT and Yt for short. And the main thing to know is that the relationship between PT and YT is that they have an inverse relationship. And if you look at, say, the swaps markets or tradfi markets, PT behaves very similarly to a zero coupon bond or to a strips bond without the yield, essentially.
00:31:48.750 - 00:32:20.780, Speaker F: And so long as you hold Pt to maturity, let's call it end of the year, you will redeem PT at par. And PT usually trades at a discount if you get in early enough. So that's kind of the fixed rates element. And the price that PtnYT trades is dictated from trading activities through the amm. And that really determines what the moving yields would.
00:32:21.950 - 00:32:24.300, Speaker B: Okay. Okay, I'm getting.
00:32:25.390 - 00:32:26.140, Speaker C: See?
00:32:26.750 - 00:32:46.340, Speaker A: Awesome. So now I'd like to ask you guys what our community would love to hear for each of the tokens that you guys have created that are issuing, what are the best ways to deploy them across DeFi, where the best yields, how can we profit the most?
00:32:48.790 - 00:32:50.898, Speaker E: Awesome. Should I go first?
00:32:51.064 - 00:32:51.780, Speaker A: Sure.
00:32:52.390 - 00:33:33.614, Speaker E: Awesome. So, yeah, right now, since we just started about a month ago, we have over four to five primary defi integrations. The first one is on curve balancer, and we are also integrated on Pendle. There's wombat. That's a dex from popular dex from BNB. And we have a few more integrations lined up across a few dexes, as well as learning protocols. So any user who wants to earn further rewards on top of their etex, which is our liquid staking token, can provide LP on curve.
00:33:33.614 - 00:34:06.330, Speaker E: I think today the yields are close. Boosted yields are close to about 10% additional on curve convex. The other one is pendle. I think we've just did our bribes yesterday. There's about 35% plus boosted yields on pendle. For somebody who is choosing the balancer etex pool on Wombat, I think somebody who wants to provide etex LP, there's about 15% to 20% additional rewards.
00:34:07.790 - 00:34:21.840, Speaker A: That sounds tasty. Just to get an idea, though, I haven't looked into the balance of pools yet, but what are the token pairings? Is it like the principal token paired with ETH, or is it like.
00:34:22.930 - 00:34:28.118, Speaker E: Yes, ETH paired with our liquid stake token, which is ETH.
00:34:28.314 - 00:34:50.010, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, that's great, because I think at these prices, very few people want to take on the risk of impermanent loss. Right. Pairing with stable. I mean, of course we could go lower, but we're the true believers left. If we're still here after two years of. Yeah, so that's great to know, Daniel.
00:34:50.010 - 00:34:56.220, Speaker A: Moving on to sweeth. How can we maximize our pearls, my friend?
00:34:57.390 - 00:35:50.860, Speaker C: Yeah. I think the first thing to do is just to realize that you're still early, Tiswell, everyone that's listening to this call and on the call. So the general rule is the earlier you stake, the bigger you stake, and the longer you stake for the more pearls you get. It's pretty simple, and we've tried our best to really speed run a lot of the ecosystem integrations and partnerships across Defi. Currently we're on main net, but we're going to go to crosschain, ideally next week, hopefully next week if everything sort of checks out. And then in terms of the specific strategies, I think just even just on a sort of a raw staking play, because we're in this bootstrapping phase, I think it's a pretty attractive sort of play. But if you want to step through and go a bit further than that and utilize the LSE suite across DFI, you can do that.
00:35:50.860 - 00:36:35.530, Speaker C: And so we have the various integrations across multiple dexes, whether that's something like a maverick, a balancer, a curve, or univ three. And we have the various emissions layers or meta governance layers on top of that. So, for example, I'd be remiss not to talk about the pendle integration here. So, with regards to pendle, you can do the balancer or a pendle stack. We have a lot of materials available, and we're also happy to talk you through that on our discord or what have you. And then we were the first team, I think, to externally to deploy pendle pool. So we work with the Pendle dev team and then we've done our Pendle suite pool at the moment.
00:36:35.530 - 00:37:21.894, Speaker C: So you can just zap in from ETH into the pendle pool there, and that will actually stake it for you. So you can just do that right on the Pendle UI. And at the same time, we're also on the Pendle earn page, too. If that's not really your flavor, you don't want to do the lp thing or you don't want to do the interest rate swap thing. We have also other integrations with protocols like Gravitar, which is a CDP cbac stablecoin. And also, even if you're not sort of primarily going through suite, we have integrations with various index or structured product style integrations as well. Recently with yarn, which is bootstrapping at the moment, it's ye product and at a high level, those are some of the integrations.
00:37:21.894 - 00:37:26.730, Speaker C: But if you want to maximize your pearls, that's general outlay.
00:37:27.630 - 00:37:44.340, Speaker A: All right, that's good to know. Well, I had a chat with your official Twitter account. Not sure who runs that, but I believe that if you deposit your suite on gravita, you don't earn perls yet, right?
00:37:45.110 - 00:38:18.278, Speaker C: Yeah. So at the moment, with CDPs, generally, we're working through what the incentivization looks like for that. But you can earn pearls if you provide liquidity on grey and sweeth. So when you borrow gry by collateralizing your suite, that LP position, which is primarily on bunny, which is a layer on top of UDB three, that's incentivized. So just generally, it's like at a high level, the pearls incentivization happens with staking and LP for suite.
00:38:18.374 - 00:38:29.150, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, I'm waiting for. What's it called? Liquis. Is it to launch so that I don't need to lock any lit tokens myself to get those boosted?
00:38:32.470 - 00:38:33.860, Speaker C: Yeah, you are, man.
00:38:35.830 - 00:38:46.130, Speaker A: You know, we do a weekly defi Alpha newsletter, right? So it's my job to keep on top of yields so we present best yield opportunities.
00:38:48.310 - 00:38:50.102, Speaker B: Obviously she's bringing the heat this.
00:38:50.236 - 00:39:13.760, Speaker D: It's crazy, you know, talking of keeping on top of yields, we've seen the rise of Egon layer for people who want to take their staked ETH and then further see returns on it. One of the things I wanted to talk to Mitt a little bit more about is something that stator is working on to help people kind of expose themselves to DeFi while seeing Aegon layers value too. Can you give me a little bit more insight on that?
00:39:15.730 - 00:39:55.434, Speaker E: Caught me out there, Jeremy. Yeah, so sure. So what we've been working on is actually something called the liquid restake token. We've just announced that last week we've been following Eigen layer and all the narratives surrounding restaking. It's obviously a very interesting concept of using the Ethereum's decentralized trust network of security to actually secure other applications or dapps or whatnot, everything. Right now, one of the questions that we asked ourselves is, hey, we are all in DeFi. Lst is in Defi now.
00:39:55.434 - 00:40:52.326, Speaker E: Restaking is going to compete against the DeFi opportunities. The most important question that kind of confounded us for some time was like, hey, how do we actually get the best of both the worlds? That was the genesis of liquid restake tokens, where if somebody restakes their LSTs with the stators restaking contract, which probably is in testnet now, and we're probably putting it out on the main net in a couple of days. When somebody stakes their LSTs or ETH with stator contract, we restake them on a set of validators running on Eigen layer. We issue something called an LRP. For simplicity. Let's just call it igneath. And then we are going to build the DFI ecosystem surrounding ignite like liquidity pools, additional reward opportunities, collateralized positions, et cetera.
00:40:52.326 - 00:41:10.770, Speaker E: So if ETH base staking rewards are about 4%, sky is the limit for restaking rewards, right? They could be 10%, 15%, or 20%, depending on the number of services that are utilizing the restaked LSTs or restaked Ethereum.
00:41:11.350 - 00:41:28.490, Speaker D: I think this whole thing begs the question, and forgive me for asking this, I think it's a perspective that's widely held when you see these types of things stacking on top of each other. Is this just a house of cards? Is it turtles all the way down here? Or, I mean, how do we derisk this space to make it appropriate for people to approach it and thrive?
00:41:29.870 - 00:42:09.506, Speaker E: I think your question has the answer right. We need to have fundamentally very strong risk management practices. That is where we're constituting a risk committee and a dow to kind of have a close watch on what services we are onboarding. What is the risk to reward ratio that we are taking? Right. So the job of the DAO or the risk committee shouldn't be, will actually be to do a deep assessment on the services and only whitelist those services that qualify certain criteria. Apart from general smart contract risks, et cetera. There's going to be slashing risks.
00:42:09.506 - 00:42:38.830, Speaker E: There's going to be like some other potential risks that there are so many unknown unknowns in this equation that till restaking and some of the services on top of restaking go live. It's very hard for us to sort of imagine that at this stage. But having said that, if we ensure that the risk management is properly in place, it's a fundamentally new primitive that is going to be built on top of Defi and restaking.
00:42:39.970 - 00:42:47.730, Speaker A: All right, fascinating stuff. Before we go forward, just a quick clip from Bumper, our sponsor for this week's recap.
00:42:49.270 - 00:43:16.534, Speaker G: So here's something new, Bumper. Your assets to defend them from price drops without losing upside exposure. You set a price floor and term length, then lock your tokens into the protocol. When your term ends, if the price has fallen under your floor, you leave with stablecoins at the floor's value. Otherwise, you just take back your original asset. Bumper is going live in August, and it's one of the most innovative defi protocols for hedging being built right now. So check out bumper Phi.
00:43:16.534 - 00:43:18.490, Speaker G: There's links in the description of this video.
00:43:18.560 - 00:43:19.900, Speaker C: Now back to our story.
00:43:22.050 - 00:44:11.386, Speaker A: All right, I would have been really curious to see how Bumper performed in a crash like yesterday's. I've been playing with this protocol called FX, if you guys are familiar with, from Aladdin Dao. So they're kind of creating this new stablecoin, like dampened volatility stablecoin combined with a leverage token that lets you basically go long without funding or liquidations. It's nice. Personally, I feel like DFI has kind of stagnated a bit. At least 2022, maybe first half of 2023 as well. It was a lot of the same old being recycled into new packaging, essentially.
00:44:11.386 - 00:44:29.220, Speaker A: And finally we're seeing more innovation, whether it works out or not. I just like to see new designs being attempted. That's why we're here, to iterate until we revolutionize the financial system, right?
00:44:30.390 - 00:44:32.354, Speaker D: Not move fast and break things.
00:44:32.552 - 00:44:33.540, Speaker A: That too.
00:44:35.130 - 00:45:27.826, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess maybe going back to a liquid Eigen ETH, I just wonder where the incentives lie. Like maybe stator will have strong risk management practices. But I wonder, is there going to be an incentive for some project to say, yes, let's take Eigen layer staked ETH deposits and give a liquid token for that. I don't know. I'm trying to think through whether, I don't know, what are the incentives there? Like, someone could add some crazy yield on top of that. And I don't know, does that present a systemic risk? I don't know what you guys think. And maybe it just happens, right? I mean, 2008 happened, and we slice and dice till our heart's content.
00:45:27.826 - 00:45:34.680, Speaker B: So I don't know, I'm trying to see what the end game is, and maybe we'll have to deal with that in like 510 years. I don't know.
00:45:36.410 - 00:46:23.394, Speaker C: Jump in there. I think there is a fundamental difference between sort of 2008 GFC and this daisy chaining of DFI, and even like outside of DFI, more broadly into crypto. And the fundamental difference is just the nature of blockchain on chain transparency and that sort of thing. I think that, generally speaking, just looking at the DFI sector overall, the DFI sector is really a sector that is still very much in its nascent early stages. We had DFI 1.0, where you came out with the fundamental building blocks or primitives. And of course, principle of DFI has always been money, Lego and composability, right? And so in some way shapes and forms.
00:46:23.394 - 00:48:00.242, Speaker C: It's largely inevitable that this composability and data chaining will happen, because a lot of the financial innovation has actually been driven by hunt for yield risk on sort of behavior coming from principally this idea that you can be permissionless. So you don't need to be a sophisticated jump through the hoops of being a sophisticated investor or being in a particular jurisdiction that you can take these plays on. But by the same token, what happens is you have this effect, derivatives, synthetics on synthetics, you have this rehypothecation on rehabilitation. And I would agree with the sentiments earlier made that there has been a stagnation in DeFi generally, where this is just a copy of a copy of a copy, this sort of similacra of just nothingness, right? But something different with regards to things like eigen layer, like distributed value technologies like ZK and optimistic growth. These are real innovative infrastructural technologies, where the yield isn't just because you're just gambling, it's actually there to secure another piece of the fundamental blockchain technology. So, for example, the Eigen layer, there has been criticism about that, but this idea of the heritage of ethereum security to build sort of data availability layers, application layers on top, that's a different sort of proposition. And I would say the distinction between that and something like collateralized debt obligations in the GFC, or even more recently in mid 2022, with the cascading implosion of FTX, Alameda, and all these sort of CFI protocols, is that DFI is transparent.
00:48:00.242 - 00:48:40.098, Speaker C: And during that time, in mid 2022, all the way through to the shaking out of that DFI worked just fine. The liquidations on Ave were fairly orderly. The bad debt was largely minimized because of this notion of isolated, the isolations. And there are definitely mechanisms such as committees and so on, like Ahmed's mentioned. But also I would say that the layering of smart contract risks is largely isolated to that particular layer, but then it goes all the way down. So it's incumbent on users to really understand those risks and for us to improve as an industry to be able to communicate those risks up front.
00:48:40.264 - 00:49:33.090, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think that. Just 1 second. Yeah, I think that is a great answer. And it did make me think that it'll be interesting to see how if you layer on the same incentives of humans want to make money, but you layer that onto a more transparent system, whether that you kind of reach certain equilibria, which is kind of optimized in terms of risk reward, in a way that maybe the obfuscation of traditional finance, there's ways in which where you end up on the risk spectrum may not actually be where people are comfortable, but it might be like that. Defi, I mean, the idealistic part of me is like, you can hit a better point of equilibrium because the risks are more transparent. So that's an interesting thought for sure.
00:49:33.240 - 00:50:31.190, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think Daniel hit the nail on the head with on chain transparency, right? All the names we saw collapse last year, all CFI players doing opaque stuff, off chain uncollateralized lending and everything. And Celsius, they paid off Defi loans as soon as they had to. Right? But other depositors won't see money for years, most likely. Like the actual me, I'm not too technically proficient as to how smart contracts work. But to me, Eigen layer and the whole restaking idea remind me somewhat of Cosmos and the whole interchange security model that they have been talking about for a couple of years now, right? Which is use the cosmos hub to kind of rent out security to new projects so they don't have to bootstrap their own validator set, et cetera. The concept seems the same.
00:50:31.190 - 00:50:46.986, Speaker A: So ETH, as a proof of stake, 40 od billion value locked system should be able to take on a little bit more load, in my opinion. Yeah, we'll have to wait and see how it plays out.
00:50:47.168 - 00:51:40.010, Speaker D: It's interesting because you see this sort of cycle of complexity in terms of the iterations of innovation that get put out in the marketplace. People who are on the core and the zero layer perhaps are able to adopt those. And then centralized institutions that represent potential points of failure come up to sort of dissipate those layers of complexity and allow other market players to come into the institutional ones, for instance. And unfortunately, while we've seen a great boost from the institutional players that have come into the marketplace driven bull markets, we've also seen that with the central institutions that come up to serve them, we're introducing systemic risk and contagion to the marketplace, because as these things become hinges and focal points where individuals turn to them and trade, we start to lose some of the decentralization factor that helps to secure and create robust network practices and architectures.
00:51:41.410 - 00:51:57.140, Speaker A: Yeah. Quick question for Ken. With the rise, you guys support most of the major LSDs on the market, right? So in terms of inflows and your users interest, which ones are people looking at right now?
00:51:58.470 - 00:52:33.760, Speaker F: I think just by nature of being the largest and the most blue chip, it will definitely be Lido steeth in different forms, depending on the chain, right? So on ethereum, obviously on native steeth, and then wrapped steeth on other chains. But we're definitely seeing different types of inflows from different users, obviously from stator and from swell and also from around binance as well. So wrapped binance ETH. Also some interest there, but, yeah, predominantly lidos ETH for now.
00:52:34.850 - 00:52:50.706, Speaker A: Yeah, it was interesting to see binance jumping into the ETH staking game. That was not something I would have predicted even a few months ago. But, yeah, I guess they saw that Coinbase is doing really well with their product. Right?
00:52:50.888 - 00:53:43.890, Speaker F: Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense, because prior to Chappella, most of the staking products were basically led by exchanges. And if you look at the top stakers today, like by entities aside from LSDs, exchanges like Coinbase, Binance and Kraken, they're still, I don't know, top five or so in terms of percentage of total staking. And I think now with LSD taking a lot of the essentially achieving instant PMF and post Chappella, even more. Right. It's basically gone up only, and we're basically seeing exchanges, trying to play catch up with CBE, with binance ETH. Who knows who'll be next? So I think that's going to continue to be a trend.
00:53:46.410 - 00:54:07.386, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's good for the ecosystem. I mean, they're centralized players, but it still diversifies the overall liquid staking. Yeah, I think that's pretty much all the questions I had for you guys, but I've kind of monopolized most of the stream, so I'm going to let Owen and Jeremy grill you now.
00:54:07.488 - 00:54:07.802, Speaker E: Just.
00:54:07.856 - 00:54:52.250, Speaker B: Oh, well, yeah, not a grilling, but I guess Ken, as a head of, I guess, institutional mean, are there interesting war stories or things that you think people might not understand about how do you, like, what kind of clients are you approaching? Do you tailor your sales pitch based on a potential client's background? Are people super up on ETH and they're just waiting? Are they scared about security? Are they scared about the ecosystem's long term viability? I don't know. What is that like, kind of interacting with big money players?
00:54:52.750 - 00:56:23.814, Speaker F: Yeah, I think the term institution tends to be thrown around a lot, but definitely in practice, there's a wide spectrum of types of institutions. So I guess on the left side of the adoption curve, there's all your prop funds, liquid yield funds, managing some external LPs, your 20 to 50 mil type funds that are very frontier, a lot of on chain strategies. Those are the guys that we tend to prioritize in terms of bringing liquidity into our amm, and also to capitalize on different opportunities from locking good fixed rates for duration and or to take directional positions on their views on the yield markets. So that's one end of the spectrum. And I think on the other end of the spectrum, we have, say, staking platform or institutional staking platform that are looking to add on more avenues of yields. Aside from just natively staking on the beacon chain and wanting to introduce something like Pendle earn, which is basically long Pt on pendle, locking a good rate to maturity and having a solution that is on defi that is non custodial, I think that's something that's quite in demand right now. A little bit of a shill here.
00:56:23.814 - 00:56:41.260, Speaker F: So we just announced a couple hours ago integration with OKX wallet, basically plugging in pendle earn as a modular infrastructure into OKX wallet. And this is, I guess, the other side of the curve that we're approaching different types of.
00:56:42.830 - 00:56:59.650, Speaker B: Cool, cool. Yeah. OKX has been doing. I know they partnered, or I don't know if they partnered, but they integrated with Starknet, and I saw the TVL on Starknet go a little crazy too. So they're kind of, I think, experimenting with some on chain. I guess integrations would be the word.
00:56:59.800 - 00:57:06.520, Speaker A: Are the principal tokens supported on any lending platforms currently? I mean, can you leverage them up?
00:57:07.530 - 00:57:57.000, Speaker F: Yeah, you definitely can. So the first protocol that announced integration with Pendle to support PTS collateral was dolomite. And over time, we've seen more and more time, swap being another example, and we're in discussions with quite a few protocols at the moment for PT, specifically, simply because of the way that PT behaves, I guess, quite predictably over time towards maturity and converging to par. The other use case apart from PT that has been quite interesting, is some protocols are looking at ways to collateralize lp positions on Pendle. So that's quite frontier. But some conversations are happening as well.
00:57:58.330 - 00:58:00.360, Speaker A: Interesting. We'll keep an eye on that.
00:58:01.610 - 00:58:02.630, Speaker D: Fascinating.
00:58:03.050 - 00:58:07.218, Speaker B: Like strip the yield off an LP, is that what you're saying?
00:58:07.404 - 00:58:19.110, Speaker F: No, just to collateralize. Let's call it a money market protocol, taking LP as collateral and allowing users to borrow off of that collateral.
00:58:19.190 - 00:58:23.038, Speaker A: This would be borrowing against your balance LP tokens, essentially, right?
00:58:23.204 - 00:58:23.870, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:58:24.020 - 00:58:49.160, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, that would be nice to do as well. I kind of haven't really personally dived into the Pendle pools just because the strategy I'm trying to do is buy some ETH at a discount and then borrow it and buy some more. So I haven't found the set of protocols supporting that yet, but. Yeah, waiting for that.
00:58:50.650 - 00:58:53.160, Speaker B: Yeah, tell us when you find it.
00:58:53.770 - 00:59:25.620, Speaker A: Yeah, man. It'll be in. I really like the gravita suite strategy because it lets you. If you want conservative leverage, right? Like, you borrow a little bit and boost your sweeth position, you're not paying any interest. So it's like essentially free leverage. And if you have a safe liquidation price like mine, I'm not going to say it on the stream just in case I get hunted. But if you have a safe liquidation price, I mean, it's a great way to improve your yield, right?
00:59:26.950 - 00:59:27.940, Speaker B: Right on.
00:59:29.990 - 00:59:30.980, Speaker C: Sounds good.
00:59:31.910 - 00:59:43.250, Speaker A: I'm so glad to have you guys on the call because I rarely get to discuss these Djen strategies with these guys. They're like, oh, no, we're not going to play with it. We'll write about it, but we won't.
00:59:43.410 - 00:59:46.534, Speaker B: I'm busy working, man. I can't do that stuff.
00:59:46.732 - 01:00:06.910, Speaker D: Like I said, there's this layer of complexity that someone like me, I just need an asset management service to be able to turn over a small portion of fees to them and then let them leverage my ETH to maximize the yields across a number of protocols. Perhaps one will come in the future that allows me to do it across all of these protocols.
01:00:07.970 - 01:00:08.862, Speaker C: We'll see.
01:00:08.996 - 01:00:17.380, Speaker B: But, yeah. Thanks, guys. Good to make sure I do keep stepping up my game and staying on top of the absolute cutting edge of what's happening.
01:00:18.070 - 01:00:19.282, Speaker D: Always more to learn.
01:00:19.416 - 01:00:20.846, Speaker B: Yeah, totally.
01:00:21.038 - 01:00:21.614, Speaker F: Likewise.
01:00:21.662 - 01:00:31.320, Speaker A: Thanks so much for joining us, guys. We're reaching the end of the hour, so unless you guys have anything else you'd like to share with the audience, I think we can wrap up for today.
01:00:34.250 - 01:00:58.654, Speaker C: I think I'm good just on my side. Yeah, I do think as well. It's also incumbent on the D five protocols to make it as simple as possible for users. I cannot expect everyone to be cutting edges, some of us keeping on top of something. I was surprised about the liquor system. That's awesome. But, for example, with us, I think Pendle has done a really great job in sort of simplifying and bringing that down.
01:00:58.654 - 01:01:23.746, Speaker C: Like something like the earn page. And with swell, we're trying to always come out with new features that make it as simple as possible. Like liquid staking made simple. That's our mantra. And being like a gateway into Lstfi. So I think in the coming weeks, we're going to come out with an earn page where you can see all the strategies nice and easily. Almost like, I don't want to use a transport term, but like a vanguard for LSTs.
01:01:23.746 - 01:01:30.694, Speaker C: So you jump on and you can just see it there. It's all in one place, but, yeah, it's great sort of feedback and just hearing you guys talk about that at the end.
01:01:30.892 - 01:01:31.542, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:31.676 - 01:01:32.360, Speaker C: Awesome.
01:01:34.890 - 01:01:49.642, Speaker A: All right, so have a great weekend, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We'll be back next week at the same time for the next weekly recap. Let's hope we don't see a repeat of this week's market action next week. And stay defiant.
01:01:49.786 - 01:01:51.520, Speaker B: All right, see you guys.
01:01:51.970 - 01:01:54.890, Speaker E: Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
