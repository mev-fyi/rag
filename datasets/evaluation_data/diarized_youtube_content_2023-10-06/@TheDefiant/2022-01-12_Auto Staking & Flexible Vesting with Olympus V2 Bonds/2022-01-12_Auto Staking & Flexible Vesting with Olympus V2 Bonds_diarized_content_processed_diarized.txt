00:02:23.526 - 00:03:14.780, Speaker A: So let's get straight to it. V two bonds on Olympus Olympus was arguably the protocol of the year in DFI last year, and now, as the token price seems to be on a free fall downward spiral, you might think that Olympus is dead far from it. When you own 99.99% of your own liquidity, you are definitely in a strong position and Olympus is now ready to go farming on other chains and basically just have a really good time building stuff. If you missed our interview with Jala on Olympusdao at the end of last year, do go and check that out because it will give you an insight into what's happening on this chain. One of the big things they was talking about was making Olympus more decentralized and we'll go into how they're going to do that. But essentially these V two bonds, an upgrade to the bond system that was in place before and that is what we're going to take a look at today.
00:03:14.780 - 00:03:43.220, Speaker A: So first look, let's go into it. So a recap on what version one bonds were. So the whole protocol and liquidity thing, that was Olympus down, they did it through bonds. So these are liquidity bonds. You can basically lock up Dai or fracs or LP tokens and you would be able to buy ohm at a discount. And this is basically kind of a short term strategy. They call it the one one strategy here.
00:03:43.220 - 00:04:35.938, Speaker A: And it's slightly risky because what you're going to do is you're going to say, okay, over the course of five days I think that the price of ohm will stay above where I bought in at and I'm happy with the discount that I'm going to get and I will realize a profit if the price stays where it was. But of course we know that this system is highly volatile. Token prices go up and down and it's entirely possible that you could buy in at a set price and see a discount. But then the actual overall price of OHm would go down and therefore you would actually be at a loss. So it's a risky strategy. When ohm was busting up and going through the roof, this was a great strategy because you're basically buying a discount that became a massive discount if you were smart enough to do so. But yes, in essence you're buying Ohm at a discount and you have to lock it up for a few days.
00:04:35.938 - 00:05:31.826, Speaker A: And under the previous system, the vesting schedule was linear, so you could claim some over time and then you'd be able to stake that ohm into the staking side, the three three side of Olympus, and earn staking rewards from the rebase. So that's what that was all about. So if we do some number crunching, this is what that looks like. So if you assume that the ohm price is $1,000, remember that on day one you have $1,000 in ETH and you want a 4% ohm ETH bond. So that's an ohm ETH liquidity pair. And on day five, you would then get $1,000 worth of ohm with $960 worth of ETH. So that 4%, that's your ROI, your return on investment, and the positive number discount, that's, as they say, the percentage discount you will get when you bond tokens into the protocol.
00:05:31.826 - 00:06:00.910, Speaker A: And that's assuming that the price of OhM remains at $1,000. It of course could go down. And last year it went up a lot and so that ROI goes up. But at the moment that you purchase the bond, that is the price quoted and that's what you get in V two bonds. So what are the differences here? So you have first the auto staking. So now when you buy a bond, the som that you receive is automatically staked. And that means you're instantly entitled to rebase rewards.
00:06:00.910 - 00:06:18.886, Speaker A: This saves a lot of time and saves a lot of gas. And it means you don't have to kind of be on top of when you withdraw your funds from the bond contract. So that's pretty handy. It's quite complicated to actually do that. So it's kind of nice to see that that's there. So you just have a simple one.
00:06:18.908 - 00:06:20.454, Speaker C: Click go and then the rest is.
00:06:20.492 - 00:07:03.842, Speaker A: Just taken care of and you're instantly earning those rebase rewards. And then there's a flexible vesting system as well. So there will be fixed term and fixed expiration bonds and there'll be different vesting terms compared to V one, which were all held for five days. And you'll be able to hold multiple types of bonds for the same assets in V two. That's kind of interesting as well. So a bit more flexibility there. And the reason they've got these longer vesting schedules is because I think basically the kind of people that were taking out bonds were short term traders and they were looking to flip and they were instantly selling the Ohm that they had acquired for the profit, which is not really the mechanism that people behind Olympus want to see.
00:07:03.842 - 00:07:35.070, Speaker A: They want to see more commitment to the protocol and less selling pressure coming from those bonds profits. So that's pretty interesting. Oh, look, I've gone the wrong way. So with V two bonding makes you a three three player. So it turns you from a one one player to a three three player, which is kind of nice because the most effective strategy on Olympus is three three. That's the best strategy for everybody. So it's diverting more funds into that strategy.
00:07:35.070 - 00:08:05.000, Speaker A: So what are the pros? So we've got automation of claiming rewards and staking. They no longer vest linearly, so you will have to wait until the end of the term, but it's not that long. It's okay. This should decrease sell pressure. It will allow Olympus to sell bonds in a more efficient way. There are many to be seen whether that's actually going to work out for them, but certainly it's definitely an improvement on where they were. Those bonds can be held as nfts, so that's going to enable you to trade them on secondary bond markets, which is kind of fun.
00:08:05.000 - 00:09:00.022, Speaker A: What was I looking at? The new protocol from Andre Cronier, this VE 33 token that's coming out, similar kind of thing, allowing you to trade assets as nfts kind of fun. Sees it's so much more than illiquid. JPEGs bonds can be fixed term or fixed expiration. And yes, the composability element to this fixed expiration bonds can be wrapped into a fungible token and traded like any ERC 20. So like everything else in DFI, something can be wrapped as something else, it could be represented as something else, and if you can do that, then it can be put to work elsewhere. And I'm sure there'll be all sorts of interesting developments and developers looking at how they can take advantage of this and that massive liquidity and massive interest in Olympus. And don't forget Olympus is also moving cross chain onto avalanche, for instance, and then they're going to be a whole bunch of other instances of Olympus across the entire ecosystem.
00:09:00.022 - 00:09:30.146, Speaker A: So it's really starting to put its tentacles out there. What else do we have? Oh, look at that. Not having a good day today. So geome, not GM, but geome is the governance version of Ohm. And you can choose to take out your rewards for bonding in som, which is staked ohm, or geome which is governance ohm. I mentioned before that Olympus is moving towards a more decentralized version of itself. The more decentralized you are, the more important governance is.
00:09:30.146 - 00:10:06.926, Speaker A: So those governance tokens are a right to vote on proposals and improvements to Olympus and they're kind of important, and there's a distinction between the two. So if you have Som, you will see the value of your holdings in there increase as the rebase rewards appear. With Geome, that doesn't happen. You have a set amount of geome and you always have that amount of geome. It's just that the amount of rebase rewards you get will increase as the rebase increases, but you just won't see them. There's an index that links back to what the Som would give you if you hadn't wrapped it as geome. And that's still represented within it.
00:10:06.926 - 00:10:26.382, Speaker A: So you'll see you've got this bag here and that's your geome token. So that one geome is always going to be one geome, but the som that's represented by it increases. So if you unwrap it, you will then unlock the correct amount of som that you would have received if you had just held onto Som.
00:10:26.446 - 00:10:27.330, Speaker C: Does that make sense?
00:10:27.400 - 00:10:42.826, Speaker A: But the geome grants you the rights to vote, so there's no difference really to owning Som, you just get a bit more superpowers to it, you just won't have an obvious representation of how much som you actually have. So we can go ahead now and.
00:10:42.848 - 00:10:44.170, Speaker C: Have a look at the dashboard.
00:10:44.590 - 00:11:10.226, Speaker A: This is the bond dashboard. So here we've got some v one Frax and ohm Frax bonds that you can still take advantage of. And then here we have an ohm ETH bond as well, which is -4.12% so that's not very attractive. But this could go up, it can go down, and then we also have a die one, which is zero point 26%. So that you're not getting a great discount on this. To be honest with you.
00:11:10.226 - 00:11:53.786, Speaker A: You're probably better off just buying ohm off the market anyway. But of course these opportunities pop up and you might see a great opportunity to explore the difference between the bond price and the market price. Bear in mind here, the duration is 14 days and then the max you can buy is this. So it's slightly limited at the moment. And when I'm looking at this, when I'm looking at this, the thing that always staggers me is bonds are a way for the Olympus Dow protocol to own its own liquidity, but if you look at how much liquidity they own, 99.99%, that is staggering, absolutely staggering. And their risk free value of treasury is 215,000,000.
00:11:53.786 - 00:12:11.158, Speaker A: Now I'm not sure how correct these statistics are because they're still migrating over to the new contracts for V two, but like I said, it's tempting to look at this and think that Olympus is in freefall and that all the sentiment is dribling out of it, but.
00:12:11.164 - 00:12:12.214, Speaker C: This is not the case.
00:12:12.332 - 00:12:57.262, Speaker A: If you looked at what happened with the big DeFi protocols last year, other curve compound maker yearn as well, they all had a pretty fallow year, but that's because the year before was just so insane. It takes time for that to all wash out of the market and for a new market cycle to begin. I suspect that's where Olympus is going to be this year, but there's no doubt that in terms of what they're doing and what they're building, they're very, very busy and they just have so much money in their treasury. I'm excited to see where they go with it. But yeah, don't make the mistake of thinking this thing's dead because I really don't think that it is. So that's a first look at Olympusdao Vtube bonds. It's not a massive upgrade, but it will definitely simplify the process.
00:12:57.262 - 00:13:32.350, Speaker A: And for short termers who are looking to kind of get some ohm at a discount could be interesting. But I think the most telling part of this is that they're simply trying to take the bonding mechanism and squidge it more towards a three three staking mechanism. And that is that. If you have any suggestions for me to have a look at and first look, please do drop them in the comments below and also get subscribed. And also just check out the Olympus film we did last year, it will give you so much insight into what's been built there. And good insights from Jalla as well. That's it for today, I'll see you on the next one.
00:13:32.350 - 00:13:32.570, Speaker A: Peace.
