00:00:04.520 - 00:00:10.878, Speaker A: Here we are with Daniel Fox, CEO of Rootstock Labs. Daniel, it's so great to have you on the Defiant podcast.
00:00:10.934 - 00:00:11.610, Speaker B: Welcome.
00:00:12.070 - 00:00:13.958, Speaker C: So happy to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:00:14.134 - 00:01:10.216, Speaker A: Of course. So, like I was just saying, super excited about this episode. Rootstock is one of the longstanding builders on bitcoin, building a L2, trying to bring more utility to the first and largest cryptocurrency. And with all the activity that's happening around bitcoin the last few months, I think this ecosystem is getting more and more interesting. So excited to hear what all the latest on Rootstock and bitcoin defi is, but let's start from the beginning. If we can just go over the, the founding story of Rootstock. Like, when did it, was it founded? What was its mission? Like maybe who the initial developers were? And also, when did you join the project?
00:01:10.408 - 00:02:19.300, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So Rootstock story really starts in Argentina. There were a series of bitcoin meetups that were happening in Buenos Aires around 2012 1314, where a number of people interested in using bitcoin for social impact, a number of cypherpunks and cryptographers and developers were all coming together to see what bitcoin would mean for Argentina. Now, for anybody that doesn't, I mean, most people in crypto know the context around Argentina, but this is unfortunately a chronically mismanaged economy, runaway inflation, people with their savings disappearing overnight. I mean, really, some of the worst, yeah, some of the worst economic and civil violations you could imagine. And it was in this environment that rootstock was born in around 2013, 2014, bitcoin had been around by that point, by about five years. It established itself as a store of value and as a payments mechanism, and was kind of growing.
00:02:19.300 - 00:03:09.740, Speaker C: And around 2014 to 15, the concept of a smart contract platform that later became Ethereum was proposed. I think that the original contributors to Rootstock, they recognized the power of bitcoin as a fully decentralized means of storing value and paying. But really, if you want to build an economy, you want to build a financial system to parallel that of a nation state or the world, you need more than that to build out all sorts of different use cases. There are mechanisms to invest, build primitives. You basically need a smart contract platform. And so the original idea of a bitcoin sidechain was first proposed back in 2014 to 15. And I think really there was a light bulb moment.
00:03:09.740 - 00:04:02.554, Speaker C: I think my understanding is that the history of sidechains and scaling layers and L2s goes all the way back to Satoshi Nakamoto. Who originally proposed some of this stuff to scale up bitcoin, but it was entirely theoretical until a proposal was made. And then really it was Sergio and the rootstock team that sort of said, hey, we could actually build this. We could take the Ethereum virtual machine, where you have the programmability, it's true, and complete. You can build an entire computer, build an entire stack on there, and what bitcoin offered and a mechanism to basically fuse the two. I'm skimming over a lot of the details here, but that was the original idea between Rootstock, the best of both. And so a white paper was published, and then we made the idea of a bitcoin side chain go from theoretical to practical.
00:04:02.554 - 00:04:18.026, Speaker C: Launched in 2018, in January 2018, it's been live now for six and a half years. Obviously, in the early days, it was one of the first layer ones back then. Now what's considered the bitcoin? L two. And, yeah, it's been six and a half years of basically building it out.
00:04:18.098 - 00:04:22.370, Speaker A: Nice. And were you around since that time? Since 2018?
00:04:22.490 - 00:05:01.242, Speaker C: No, I have a sort of parallel journey. So my first exposure to crypto was late 2012. And then in early 2013, a friend of mine took me to a conference to south by Southwest in Austin, and he was super excited about bitcoin and was trying to get me into it. No, I didn't buy any back then. Wish I had. And I was working at the time on the early, basically working on Internet of things, technology. I spent, period, about four or five years building out a product called Buffalo grid that provided remote power and Internet access to rural communities.
00:05:01.242 - 00:06:08.020, Speaker C: And in fact, it was actually working in that that I started to realize what an issue payments, digital payments, outside of the western world, really was. My background is in the combination of macro geopolitical trends, emerging technology, and how emerging markets and emerging technology all fuse together to create opportunities for basically solving some of humanity's biggest problems. I was back then focused on how you addressed the power and Internet shortage in rural communities. There was over 3 billion people who didn't have access to easy to use renewable power. And yet within that group, you had a huge amount of people, billions of people, that were accessing the Internet. And as the economy was going more and more online, this issue of getting access to power and Internet was becoming a blocker and preventing people from joining the global economy. So I was kind of on that track, and I spent a lot of time solving micropayments problems at the end of a dirt track in north India, where I spent sort of four or five years on and off, that kind of journey went where it went.
00:06:08.020 - 00:06:45.388, Speaker C: And then in 2020, when the Rootstock labs team back then, referred to as known as iv labs, were trying to build out the RSK ecosystem, rootstock ecosystem, I met with Diego and Sergio and Adrian and the founders, and they were really trying to scale the ecosystem up. I was blown away by the technology, by what they built. This best of both worlds. Still to this day, hasn't been. There really hasn't been anything that's come close to what Rootstock has managed to achieve in terms of technical architecture. And, yeah, I've been on the journey ever since. Coming up for four years really soon.
00:06:45.524 - 00:07:11.776, Speaker A: Awesome. Can we dive a bit deeper in the rootstock architecture? So you mentioned it's based on the Ethereum virtual machine. So there's, I guess, like a fork of the EVM which you use. I understand there's also something called merged mining. There's the two way peg. So, yeah, like, how do all these pieces fit together?
00:07:11.928 - 00:07:48.998, Speaker C: Sure. So, I mean, there's lots of definite. So, firstly, l two s. That's an ethereum concept that's been ported into bitcoin to help people understand what scaling layers for bitcoin would look like. But really, there are lots of different types of scaling mechanism for bitcoin. For example, you would consider both lightning and rootstock as an l two, when in fact there are very different types of technology trying to solve very different problems. One's about low cost, high speed micro payments, the other one is about building smart contracts.
00:07:48.998 - 00:08:34.640, Speaker C: And they're completely different. But it's helpful because it allows people to understand what this bitcoin l two space is. The reason I make that distinction is there is a formal definition for sidechains, and rootstock today is by far the biggest and the most developed sidechain. The way I always try and talk about it, in simple terms, is cryptographic, economic and monetary alignment to bitcoin. So firstly, the cryptographic component, the merge mining process, means that rootstocks consensus is deeply tied to bitcoin. So the merge mining process, in very simple terms, means that the consensus mechanism of bitcoin is used to help rootstock achieve consensus. And we do this by anchoring the hash of rootstock into the bitcoin blockchain.
00:08:34.640 - 00:09:17.620, Speaker C: Today, 60% of the hashing power of bitcoin is used to support rootstock. Then you've got the economic alignment. So the transaction fees that are used that are generated from merge mining are shared with the bitcoin miners. So I believe vary slightly but between 79 and 81% of all the transaction fees that are generated on rootstock are distributed to the bitcoin miners that emerge mining. This means that there is not any kind of rootstock and bitcoin are in support. We're supporting the miners, we're supporting there, providing them alternative revenue streams. It's a symbiotic relationship, it's not parasitic.
00:09:17.620 - 00:09:56.270, Speaker C: The third point is monetary alignment. Very simply, in rootstock, bitcoin is king. You bring bitcoin to rootstock, you lock it into a peg, and you unlock rootstock, bitcoin, and you use bitcoin to pay the gas. It's native to the network. Yeah, bitcoin is king and rootstock. So, cryptographic, economic, and monetary alignment, the two way peg is a fundamental part of rootstock. It's simply put, it's a smart contract where you lock bitcoin on the bitcoin network, and through series different mechanisms, you unlock rootstock.
00:09:56.270 - 00:10:37.870, Speaker C: Bitcoin on rootstock. So that's the definition of a sidechain, economic, monetary, and cryptographic alignment. But this term often gets used to refer to all bitcoin l two s. And that's not quite accurate, because, broadly speaking, certainly from what I've seen, every bitcoin l two has a different approach to, let's call it working with bitcoin. Some are merge mines, some are not. Some are just a bridge architecture to an EVM, some are payment and scaling layers, but they're all quite different, and they also slightly different purposes. So quite different to the ethereum l two space, where, to my understanding, they're essentially just different versions of roll ups.
00:10:37.870 - 00:10:43.304, Speaker C: All great, all fantastic, but they're variants of the same thing. Whereas in bitcoin l two s, it's very different.
00:10:43.442 - 00:11:03.600, Speaker B: How does this two peg system work? Is it like people deposit their bitcoin in some sort of. What wouldn't be a smart contract on bitcoin? Like, where exactly is the bitcoin held and how is that secured? And then how is that represented on rootstock?
00:11:04.180 - 00:11:38.652, Speaker C: Yeah, super interesting question. Okay, so there's a smart contract on Rootstock, which is secured by. It's effectively a bridge architecture. It was originally, when launched, a federated, multisig model. This is six and a half years ago. But almost immediately, we started moving away from this, and we developed something called the proof of work, HSM architecture. So there are eight devices which are all connected into in secure rooms in data centers around the world.
00:11:38.652 - 00:12:07.790, Speaker C: The controllers of these devices are all fully attested public keys. Everything is public. And you can see it all. And the proof of work mechanism of rootstock secures these hardware security modules. It's a novel architecture. We haven't seen anyone else develop something like this. And so the key message here is the proof of work of Rootstock, and therefore bitcoin, is securing these hardware devices that then secure the bitcoin in the two way peg.
00:12:07.790 - 00:12:39.820, Speaker C: And the two way peg is essentially a smart contract that interacts between rootstock and bitcoin. Locking and unlocking bitcoin and RBTC. You can directly interface with the two way peg. There's lots of different ways to get RBTC, but you can directly interface with the two way peg through a two way peg app where you essentially send bitcoin to the address after. After quite a significant amount of time. If you want to go the full, decentralized, hardcore way, it's about two days. It's about 18 hours, but it feels like two days.
00:12:39.820 - 00:13:08.720, Speaker C: You essentially then unlock RBTC on rootstock. So you can directly go through the two way peg, but it's not the only way that you can get hold of RBTC. You can get it through swaps and exchanges and on ramps and peer to peer and lots of other different ways. But if you want to directly generate RBTC, you can essentially send. I'm simplifying here, but you essentially send bitcoin to a bitcoin address, and after a period of time, that bitcoin is unlocked and the rootstock bitcoin pops up on the rootstock network. Again, I'm simplifying the architecture here, but that's essentially how it works.
00:13:09.420 - 00:13:16.500, Speaker A: Okay, got it. And that's secured by, you said, like an eight person multisig kind of structure.
00:13:16.540 - 00:13:45.940, Speaker C: So it used to be a federated bridge model. We moved away from that some years ago. It's secured by their eight hardware security modules. And those hardware security modules run a bespoke firmware, which is connected into the proof of work mechanism that runs rootstock. So it's secured by proof of work. Fundamentally, there are no individuals that control these devices. The fact that these devices are, if you get hold of one or got hold of all of them, you couldn't do anything with it.
00:13:45.940 - 00:14:01.710, Speaker C: It's a novel architecture. We've got quite a lot of stuff up on the site because I think this is probably one of the biggest misconceptions around how rootstock works. But, yeah, the key message here is this is not a multisig. It's not like there's eight individuals with ledger devices knocking around. That's just not what we're running here.
00:14:01.790 - 00:14:07.862, Speaker A: Super interesting. Okay. And then my original question was how much bitcoin is actually locked here?
00:14:08.046 - 00:14:28.838, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's 3000 bitcoin in the two way peg today. Theoretically, you can bridge up to 21 million bitcoin if Satoshi pops up and moves his into rootstock as well. So theoretically, you can bridge all the bitcoin that is ever created. And there's 3000 bitcoin locked in the peg today.
00:14:28.974 - 00:14:53.042, Speaker B: I guess. So the original purpose of rootstock was to bring programmability to bitcoin, to build out essentially decentralized finance, like financial applications, to provide more utility to bitcoin. So how is that going? Like, what main use cases are being built on rootstock today?
00:14:53.166 - 00:15:51.022, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. So the original, original idea with rootstock remains true for rootstock labs and our promotion of rootstock today, which was we needed to extend bitcoin. Bitcoin, the blockchain, the asset isn't enough to build a fully decentralized economy. And so the intention was always to build a mechanism that allows to scale bitcoin. How's it going? Defi wasn't a thing when Rootstock launched. We predated Defi, and bitcoin DeFi is entirely new as well. I think bitcoin Defi, even though people have been talking about it for some time, and even though wrapped BTC is one of the highest traded assets on Ethereum, I would say DeFi on Bitcoin has only really been a serious endeavor for maybe like two and a half to three years.
00:15:51.022 - 00:16:57.096, Speaker C: And I'd really say it's only starting to mature as a subsector of the crypto space in the last, like nine to twelve months. If your definition of bitcoin DeFi is you're not just interacting with the asset, you're actually doing it on top of bitcoin in some mechanism. And so it's taken the bitcoin l two s that have emerged, frankly, over the last year or so to allow DeFi on bitcoin to take place. So, yeah, when we launched Rootstock, Defi wasn't really a thing, but it was really the intentional along, which is to provide a mechanism to construct an economy that was independent of national state control. How's it going? I think by far one of the biggest proponents of, to be honest, the shining example of bitcoin DeFi has got to be sovereign. So sovereign is a community of tens of tens of thousands of bitcoin advocates. It was built on a rootstock and launched in early 2021.
00:16:57.096 - 00:17:56.340, Speaker C: It's got a thriving community, and is by far one of the biggest communities on rootstock today. And really, they've been trying to build out all of the DeFi primitives that you would find on any DeFi platform on Ethereum, but build it en route stock, and therefore anchoring it directly into bitcoin. Incredibly passionate and innovative team, and really, the trailblazers, from what I've seen, unmatched in other ecosystems. So how's it going? I think definitely they'd be the shining example. But if you think of the more expansive definition of DeFi, one of the notable projects in rootstock that I always like to talk about, because it's such an interesting protocol, is money on chain, which is a bitcoin collateralized us dollar peg. Stablecoin, extremely secure, highly decentralized, fully bitcoin native bitcoin collateralized, never gone down, never de pegged. Remarkable team building that out.
00:17:56.340 - 00:18:42.028, Speaker C: It's a very capital intensive protocol. I think they have an over collateralization ratio of seven to one, and that creates scaling problems for it as a stablecoin. But it's by far the most impressive stablecoin, decentralized stablecoin architecture I've ever come across. One of those super exciting things for us at rootstock is over the last. I'd say over the last six months, things have really started moving on the network. While we were looking at some of the stats internally of the growth in the ecosystem we've seen, I mean, there have been 48 projects and protocols that have launched on rootstock in the last twelve months. And in fact, there have been 19 that have launched in the last three months.
00:18:42.028 - 00:19:24.098, Speaker C: And I think we saw six launched in the last two weeks. So the rate of protocol launches and projects going live on rootstock has just exploded. Now why is that? Probably two or three things. I mean, the first thing is that we, we've seen this incredible enthusiasm for bitcoin and Defi in the last price run up over the last six months. That's one thing. We're seeing people speculating more, and we're seeing people engage in the protocols more that you see in a bull market. I think the second thing is, the Bitcoin l two space has really developed over the last nine to twelve months, primarily because of the work we've been doing, the work stacks has been doing.
00:19:24.098 - 00:20:18.426, Speaker C: Then the third thing is, there have been a number of conceptual technical breakthroughs that have meant entirely new types of l two can be built. And really here we're talking about BitVM and what BitVM means for bitcoin l two s, but equally bootstrapping ecosystems, which is really our role at Rootstock Labs. Yeah, it takes work, takes time, takes experimentation. Yeah. But I think things are really running now. It's a combination of the mechanisms that we've started to deploy to attract people into rootstock. The market run up some of the innovations around bitcoin, getting people really excited about bitcoin l two s, and, yeah, just the steady hard work of the other bitcoin l two s and ourselves building out this l two narrative, which is really starting to take off.
00:20:18.426 - 00:20:19.520, Speaker C: It's super exciting.

00:20:48.430 - 00:20:56.774, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, there's. I think there's been more activity around bitcoin than, you know, probably ever, but.
00:20:56.822 - 00:21:08.390, Speaker B: Still, you know, the. I think bitcoin l two s are still lagging ethereum and even some activity on other layer ones.
00:21:08.470 - 00:21:23.038, Speaker C: It's still really early, for sure. It's still really early. I would. I honestly don't think that this Bitcoin l two space Washington even worth. I mean, with the exception of us and stacks, there was really nothing going on until about six to nine months ago.
00:21:23.134 - 00:22:05.644, Speaker B: It's so early, and that's changing now because of these new innovations and the market run up. But do you think, has there been a change also in the bitcoin community? Like, in the. I don't know if you can, like, think of, like, a stereotypical bitcoin error or not even that. Just like maybe the majority of bitcoin holders were active in the community. Is it fair to say that they were less open to the idea of defi on bitcoin before and now that's changed, and if that's the case, what do you think is driving that?
00:22:05.732 - 00:22:09.180, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm always cautious when talking about the bitcoin community, and monolithic.
00:22:09.220 - 00:22:09.800, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:10.380 - 00:22:12.708, Speaker B: Lots of different people in it.
00:22:12.844 - 00:22:55.730, Speaker C: And I think when you think about crypto in general, maybe this is less the case now, but most people's first interaction with crypto is bitcoin. So we're all bitcoiners at a certain level. Right. However, there are kind of more extreme voices in this space, it is a highly culturally and even religiously. Yeah, it's a very intense culture. So I'm always cautious about talking about it in monolithic terms, because there's all sorts of subsets and different positions. I think the way I look at it, I kind of self identify, if you will, is as a bitcoin pragmatist.
00:22:55.730 - 00:24:10.850, Speaker C: For me, this is an entirely. Bitcoin represents an entirely new computing paradigm, something that we really haven't seen, we really hadn't seen in decades until bitcoin went live in 2008. To understand it or see it as simply a means of storing value and a means of exchange is to massively limit the possibilities for what you can do with the bitcoin blockchain. We have always seen it as a entirely novel form of computer that anybody can interact with. The launch of the first bitcoin sidereal and launch of Rootstock was really just an example of how you can take the cryptographic power of bitcoin and bring it to bear for a completely different set of uses that bitcoin was never really originally designed for. To be very honest with you, I'm very like. I tend not to get too involved in the debates around what you should or shouldn't use bitcoin for what is or isn't a right use of block space.
00:24:10.850 - 00:24:45.014, Speaker C: I'm pro experimentation. So long as nobody's getting hurt, it's all good, and everybody's staying within the rails. I think it is fair to say that up until. Has there been a change? I don't know. I don't know. There's been a change. I think maybe the number of people building has grown and the experimentation space has expanded, and maybe the example and the.
00:24:45.014 - 00:25:22.858, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe those voices have just got louder and started to drown out. To a certain extent, the more. Yeah, the more sort of extreme, culturally dogmatic voices. You know, there's a. You know, a lot of bitcoin culture and a lot of crypto culture in general, is people just talking about stuff and getting excited about the culture. I think I'm more interested in seeing what people are building and letting those who are creating things and using this technology for new and novel use cases or just everyday use cases. I'm more interested to see what they do, because I think those are the ones that are going to build the future.
00:25:22.858 - 00:25:45.342, Speaker C: I think those that are more interested in kind of conserving and protecting and anchored in a sort of romantic, almost religious view of the technological past. Yeah, history tends not to be on the side of those. I think history is a bit more favorable to people that try new things and try and experiment and build stuff that's for everyone.
00:25:45.446 - 00:25:54.586, Speaker A: I think in the end the market tends to decide, right, like, you organically.
00:25:54.658 - 00:26:12.850, Speaker B: See use cases, tokens, you know, things that work and people like, emerge, do well, and, you know, and that will be the answer on whether people are liking more utility on bitcoin or not.
00:26:12.890 - 00:26:50.480, Speaker A: And I think so far, yeah, we've seen so much interest, like we've reported at the defiant how the top NFT collections are now all bitcoin based, which was pretty unthinkable in the last NFT bull run. So, yeah, things are definitely changing and related to that. I wanted to get your thoughts on actually this, on this rise of ordinals and BRC twenties and all this innovation happening.
00:26:51.700 - 00:26:54.884, Speaker B: Yeah. What are your thoughts on how does.
00:26:54.932 - 00:26:59.532, Speaker A: Rootstock integrate any of that, if at all?
00:26:59.676 - 00:27:59.180, Speaker C: Yeah, so on the second part of the question, there's a BRC 20 bridge that I think is going live in the next few weeks. There is a wallet going live in the network that's going to allow people to interface with and view runes. So, yeah, we're going to definitely be bringing a lot of that to rootstock on the first part of the question. I've been working in technology long enough to know that often the future at first looks like a game or looks like a plaything, or looks like silly or stupid, or the kind of thing that doesn't have any business model or doesn't really have any point or any purpose, that is often the next thing. It's just the experimentation phase. Looks a bit more like a hobby or looks a bit more like. Yeah, looks a bit silly.
00:27:59.180 - 00:28:58.488, Speaker C: Right. But I've been. Yeah, I've seen time and time again that if you're able to look through the kind of play which is essentially what the early experimentation phase should be, if you can see through the play, what you're often looking at is sketches of interfaces or sketches of use cases that. I mean, for example, I was looking at. I can't remember what protocol it was, but I was looking at a. I was looking at a BRC 20 interface the other day and it was kind of messing around with it and I thought to myself, and I can't remember exactly, there was faces and jpegs and cartoons and images and stuff, and I thought if you kind of strip all of that out, you're essentially looking at an interface for a housing market here at the moment. It's like jpegs of dogs with hats and wizards and stuff.
00:28:58.488 - 00:29:53.000, Speaker C: And I think it's super, super exciting and super interesting. Do I think the global economy is going to be built off wizards and badly spelled names of us presidents? No, but that's not the point. The point is we're experimenting, we're playing, we're trying things, and once that settles, some of that will stay, because that's part of the culture, and that's awesome. But once that settles down, when you look through that, you're looking at an interface for real world assets, you're looking at new art markets, you're looking at mortgage systems, you're looking at an economy emerging. So, yeah, a bunch of this stuff is coming to rootstock. Like I said, we've got bridges launching live, we've got wallets coming online the next couple of weeks to allow some of this stuff to come onto the network. But, yeah, I'm super excited about it.
00:29:53.000 - 00:29:59.808, Speaker C: The experimentation space is just opening up on bitcoin, and long may it continue.

00:30:33.370 - 00:31:00.600, Speaker B: You mentioned, speaking of innovation, about this new virtual machine, BitVM. So we discussed earlier that rootstock uses a forked version of the EVM. What are your plans with BitVM? Like, are there any plans to actually use this instead?
00:31:01.300 - 00:32:07.946, Speaker C: Yeah. So maybe I'll let you in. The sort of an experience we've had over the last six months. So a cryptographer called Robin Linus developed the idea for BitVM maybe like six or nine months ago. I don't know the exact time, and there was a lot of discussion about this, and people were kind of super interested to know, does this allow roll ups in bitcoin? And I remember talking to Javier, who's our head of research and innovation, and Sergio, our chief scientist, and there were differing opinions around what this meant. And these new technologies tend to, especially when they disrupt or undermine what you've built, especially when they cannibalize what you've created and what you've been creating for many years, I think people can initially be resistant to that and think, oh, this is a threat. But after a series of conversations and some quite intense debates in the team and rootstock labs.
00:32:07.946 - 00:32:45.060, Speaker C: There was a bit of a breakthrough, I think, just before Christmas. And all I can say is that over the last three months, there's been quite intense work in looking into what BitVM means for rootstock. We think, I mean, fundamentally, the bridge between rootstock and bitcoin is an absolutely. It is. I mean, it is rootstock. It's absolutely fundamental to what we're trying to build out here. And we believe we've taken the, you know, we've evolved out of a federated bridge into the hardware, security, proof of work, secured bridge.
00:32:45.060 - 00:34:04.940, Speaker C: But we think there might be something entirely new that you can do using BiTVM to interface with bitcoin in a way that's even more decentralized and even entirely permissionless. And we think BiTVM might be an interesting way to do this. But in order to do that, we need to look at some of the amazing work that Robin, Linus and the other contributors to BiTVM have done, and maybe adapt it, improve it, change it all in the spirit of open source collaboration, and obviously publish that with everyone. And so this is what we're looking into at the moment. On the 2 May, our chief scientist and some of the people from our research team are going to published their thinking about this BTC in Austin. And obviously, we'll make all this public then. But, yeah, this is arguably the most technically interesting thing to happen to bitcoin since Rootstock, I would argue, but certainly since Rootstock, since lightning, this is an entirely novel new way to scale bitcoin.
00:34:04.940 - 00:34:25.160, Speaker C: Yeah, we're going all in. We think there's something really, really exciting here, and we think there's a lot of work to do, but we're going all in and we're putting a lot of resources and quite a big team behind allowing this to transform rootstock and then sharing all of that with the wider Bitcoin l two community as well.
00:34:25.700 - 00:34:26.100, Speaker B: Wow.
00:34:26.140 - 00:35:01.408, Speaker A: So interesting. Yeah, definitely. We'll keep an eye out for that paper and see what your thoughts are on how you can keep improving the BitVM and using it on rootstock. So if that happened, what would. What would that mean for the applications that have already been building on bootstock? Would they have to deploy new smart contracts using BiTVM? Would they lose any compatibility with other EVM chains? Yeah. Like, what are the implications?
00:35:01.544 - 00:35:24.060, Speaker C: Yeah, they shouldn't be affected at all, but I think it might be best waiting until we publish the white paper, because I really think the, you know, we're still very. I say we, the whole bitcoin l two space is still very, very early here. The implications of BiTVM are still being fully understood. A couple of weeks more.
00:35:27.370 - 00:35:58.550, Speaker A: Okay, sounds good. Then. I wanted to ask you a couple of other, a bit more technical questions. I got from. I asked on Twitter what people wanted to know. I got a few questions on your merged mining mechanism. So what people were asking what your strategies are to incentivize miners to participate in merged mining?
00:35:58.910 - 00:36:33.630, Speaker C: Yeah, really good question. So do you know what I'm going to do? I'll do this live. We actually published a mining merge mining report last week, I believe, and as part of the report we were reviewing over the year how much had been paid to the bitcoin miners. We're looking at some stats here. Yeah, it's a significant amount. I'm not going to quote, I'm not going to quote the stats live, but there's hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Several hundred thousands of dollars a year going to the bitcoin miners.
00:36:33.630 - 00:37:19.590, Speaker C: I'm cautious of quoting the stats in case I get them wrong, but several hundred thousand dollars a year is supporting the bitcoin miners with a completely alternative revenue stream that is independent of bitcoin mining, but using the same compute power. And this is why when we say that we're economically aligned to the bitcoin miners, we're literally providing rootstock is providing entirely new revenue streams for them. And we believe very strongly that other bitcoin l two s should follow a similar path because supporting the bitcoin miners is they, of course, have their own independent economic model. But if you're building an economy off the back of the proof of work mechanism that they're building, we think that you should be contributing to that and you should be sort of paying your way, essentially. And rootstock definitely does.
00:37:19.740 - 00:37:31.010, Speaker A: Does rootstock need separate sets of miners or do you use directly miners of the bitcoin blockchain?
00:37:31.050 - 00:37:31.786, Speaker B: And that's it.
00:37:31.898 - 00:37:56.740, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Really good question. So we use the miners of the bitcoin blockchain, the merge mining process, essentially. I can probably give you a quick list. So ant pool brains btc.com comma f two pool Luxor via BTC secpool. So it's the existing bitcoin miners that are merge mining with rootstock.
00:37:56.740 - 00:38:15.086, Speaker C: We're always trying to add more. And of course, the amount of hash rate that's securing rootstock varies. But right now I think we're hovering around 60% of the bitcoin hashrate. So 60% of all the hashrate that's brought to bear to mine bitcoin is also merge mining on rootstock as well.
00:38:15.168 - 00:38:20.242, Speaker A: So do bitcoin miners, do they need to opt in to mine rootstock?
00:38:20.306 - 00:38:20.950, Speaker C: Yes.
00:38:21.690 - 00:38:36.270, Speaker A: I see. Okay. And when they do that, obviously they get this incentive, this share of, I guess, is it fees, like network fees? What your. Exactly were these hundred thousand?
00:38:36.650 - 00:39:15.350, Speaker C: Exactly, exactly. They get a share of all the transaction fees that are generated through the network. And one of the interesting things as well is the bitcoin miners only receive a simplifying here, but a fee for mining bitcoin if they manage to unlock, if they manage to find the next block and receive the reward in bitcoin. But that's not the case with rootstock. They generate fees whenever they're merge mining. So it's. Yeah, I mean, if you could imagine ten miners and one unlocks the next bitcoin block, all ten of them are going to receive in fees from rootstock for the merge mining process.
00:39:15.470 - 00:39:36.118, Speaker B: So in this kind of symbiotic relationship, does bitcoin also share any of the risks of rootstock? Like, are there any, I don't know, security implications for bitcoin if anything goes wrong with rootstock because you are using bitcoin miners?
00:39:36.214 - 00:39:36.790, Speaker A: I don't know. Any.
00:39:36.830 - 00:39:40.384, Speaker B: Any chance that that could affect bitcoin itself?
00:39:40.582 - 00:40:01.540, Speaker C: I mean, to be straight, no, not really. It's entirely beneficial for the miners. Rootstock is independent of bitcoin, but shares the hashrate of the miners. And were anything to go wrong with rootstock, it would in no way shape or form impact the miners or the bitcoin blockchain.
00:40:01.700 - 00:40:16.028, Speaker A: I guess the main thing that could go wrong with rootstock is something happening to the bridge. That's the main. I don't know where the assets are. That's where something could go wrong and that's something.
00:40:16.084 - 00:40:16.680, Speaker B: That.
00:40:18.380 - 00:40:22.840, Speaker A: Vault of bitcoin is on Woodstock itself, not on bitcoin.
00:40:23.380 - 00:40:39.542, Speaker C: The vault of bitcoin is on bitcoin. But yes, it could be locked. Yeah, that's right. It could be locked and therefore the assets would not be in circulation. They'd be essentially sat in an address. Yeah, but it wouldn't in any way. Yeah, that wouldn't in any way impact the operation of bitcoin.
00:40:39.542 - 00:40:50.342, Speaker C: It would just be like somebody lost these historical stories about people losing their usb sticks and the garbage behind down sofas. It would just be another one of those.
00:40:50.526 - 00:41:12.300, Speaker D: Protocol 20 introduces Sorbonne, which is stellar's cutting edge smart contracts platform. This creates new surface area for innovation and provides new opportunities for developers to build protocols and products that create access to everyday financial services. So it means a gradual increase in transaction capacity and a chance to fine tune applications. And it's the most transformative upgrade to the stellar network to date.
00:41:13.760 - 00:41:55.940, Speaker A: Okay. And then moving on to competition in the bitcoin l two space, which is great, which is. It's becoming really intense. So recently, there's been a few very big announcements of fundraises. So there's thesis secured 21 million in series a to fund the mezzo, I think is how you pronounce it. L two bit layer announced a seed round of 5 million. There's build on bitcoin, raised 10 million.
00:41:55.940 - 00:42:20.456, Speaker A: And, you know, that's just three of the recent funding rounds. So, yeah, lots of competition in your space. How do you. I mean, how do you differentiate? How do you plan to attract more users, attract more capital, versus all these up and coming chains?
00:42:20.568 - 00:42:54.150, Speaker C: Yeah. So, you know, our purpose at Rootstock Labs is to make bitcoin work for everyone. Making bitcoin work for everyone. Rootstock is not the only way we hugely value and encourage new entrants into the space. The pie is still very small. We want more developers, more builders, more projects building on bitcoin. And while we think Rootstock is the best place to do it, there are different configurations and different optimizations that might function in different ways.
00:42:54.150 - 00:43:28.260, Speaker C: Simply put, we think it's fantastic. Shout out to stacks for doing a really, really good job of building out a new narrative for building on bitcoin. The lightning community has brought a lot of developers into bitcoin in a way that prior to that, it was only core bitcoin development, which is super important. But it's a very specific niche. It's like the core core architecture and infrastructure. It's not the use case build out, which is what lightning represents. The Bob guys are doing something really interesting.
00:43:28.260 - 00:44:12.500, Speaker C: You're right. It's nice to see thesis doing an l two. They've been building out some great bitcoin apps over the last couple of years. Honestly, I think this is only positive. How do we differentiate? Well, if you simplify, what a lot of these teams are doing is very similar to what we're doing, which is that, first you need novel architecture, more secure, or faster, or better interoperability, or use case specific, or app specific, or whatever it might be. But then you need to build an ecosystem. You need to build an ecosystem of developers and capital and enablers and all the different partners that you require in order to build out a bitcoin defi ecosystem.
00:44:12.500 - 00:45:01.184, Speaker C: So in terms of differentiators, I think one of the big ones is that we already have a thriving ecosystem on rootstock. There's over 117 partners and protocols that have integrated where they're alive on the network. We've done all the hard dog work of building from baseline during a bear market, during a cold, cold winter, multiple cold, cold winters. And I think that means that the community's got an incredible amount of experience. A lot of the narratives that you need, because, of course, narrative market fit is really important here. A lot of the narratives you need to explain to people why defi bitcoin, why using protocols on bitcoin is something that. Something different and novel and exciting in comparison to Ethereum.
00:45:01.184 - 00:45:51.800, Speaker C: The community in Rootstock has been doing that now for several years. The idea that you can fork the protocol, but you can't fork the ecosystem, I think, is a really, really powerful one here. So differentiating factors of that. When you look at technical architecture, we believe very strongly that our approach through the two way peg architecture, it's interesting. Our two way peg, often, it's often misunderstood, and it often receives a lot of criticism because of the original architecture. If you look in the original white paper, the architecture for the two way peg is completely different to the one we operate now. It's kind of evolved over time, but it's still by far the longest lasting, most secure, and highest performance bitcoin bridge in operation today into a bitcoin l two.
00:45:51.800 - 00:46:25.840, Speaker C: A lot of the bitvm implementations are either theoretical or testnet only at this stage. So, yeah, I mean, we welcome new entrants. We welcome in. Like I said, if there's anything I can say about Rootstock, the rootstock community, and the people at Rootstock Labs, we're pro innovation and pro experimentation on bitcoin. We're not going to be able to extend bitcoin alone as a single l two community. We need a whole army of builders and developers and innovators doing this. So, yeah, I think it's super positive.
00:46:25.840 - 00:46:52.658, Speaker C: Rootstock labs is well capitalized, and there's a number of different well capitalized actors within the rootstock ecosystem that mean that we're going to be around for a long time, and we look forward to these new entrants helping build this space out with us. We welcome them as the first bitcoin sidechain. We think that their experimentation and their energy is only good for bitcoin.
00:46:52.794 - 00:46:58.410, Speaker A: Very, very politically correct answer, but it's true, though. Yeah.
00:46:58.570 - 00:47:11.144, Speaker C: Look, for me, anyone that's been working in defi a lot of. Enough, like the good actors. Yeah, they tend to be. Let's build some stuff. Let's experiment. It's still so early. I mean, we haven't.
00:47:11.144 - 00:47:34.454, Speaker C: Crypto hasn't taken over the global economy yet. Right. And it's for good reason. There's so much more to do, and we're not going to do it alone. And the idea of sort of monolithic chains and single genius teams that can change the world is a kind of a bit of a fiction in my mind. We need a huge movement to disrupt the global economy, and we think a really, really important part of that is smart contracts and bitcoin. So we welcome all these teams.
00:47:34.454 - 00:47:40.090, Speaker C: I think it's great. I think it's fantastic, honestly. Not just politically correct, but also true.
00:47:40.430 - 00:47:48.770, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I get it. No, and I agree. I think obviously, competition is good for everyone.
00:47:50.990 - 00:48:03.712, Speaker B: Which leads me to the following question about competition, not just within the bitcoin ecosystem, but between other blockchains.
00:48:03.856 - 00:48:08.216, Speaker A: And what's your view there on the future of crypto?
00:48:08.248 - 00:48:28.856, Speaker B: Like, do you think that there's room for many layer ones, like, for many of these smart contracts based ecosystems to take over the financial system? Or do you think it has to be bitcoin long term?
00:48:29.008 - 00:49:13.584, Speaker C: Yeah, good question. So there's space for lots of different l one s, for sure, different l one s. And ethereum l two s are better configured for different use cases. It's just true. Some are more secure, like rootstock. Some are faster, some are cheaper, like optimism. There are, you know, there are, you know, if I sort of think maybe like 20 or 30 years into the future, with a lot of blockchain networks having reached what they would consider like a successful endpoint, it's not going to look like one or two or three and all the others are gone.
00:49:13.584 - 00:49:59.104, Speaker C: It will probably look like hundreds. With those that have really thrived, been either highly specialized at something or particularly good at interoperability. I think when you think about Rootstock's place within that, what is unique about rootstock is it is extraordinarily secure. When we say that bitcoin is the second most secure smart contract. Sorry, second most secure blockchain on the planet after bitcoin and the most secure smart contract platform on the planet, it's because of the hash rate, the proof of work, hash rate, that's securing it. It's extremely secure. Bitcoin is entirely native.
00:49:59.104 - 00:51:03.950, Speaker C: You can interact with bitcoin on rootstock in a way that is simply not possible in ethereum or other evms or networks that are not anchored into and connected into the bitcoin the same way that rootstock is. So that's kind of how we differentiate ourselves. But I think there are. I mean, we're going to have, there will probably be ten or 15 or 20 game specific networks or networks that are particularly useful for gaming alone. And that's just a tiny segment of the global economy. And do I believe the entire global economy is going to move into blockchain networks? No, but I think certain large parts of it definitely will. The way I think about this, if you think about the last 25 years and how software and the Internet has essentially taken over, every aspect of every economic interaction we make is in some way mediated by the Internet or mediated by technology, you have to at least partly accept that money and the economy is going to go the same way.
00:51:03.950 - 00:52:04.250, Speaker C: And when you map that out, it can either go in a highly centralized direction or a very decentralized direction, or some strange combination of the two, where different use cases are more or less preferable for centralized or decentralized systems. So, yeah, all economic activity will go digital. Then eventually most economic activity will become digital native. And within that, it's very easy to see how a very large portion of it will be entirely run on decentralized networks like rootstock. Exactly how it's going to shake out, who's going to win, who's going to lose. Still too early. But I think where I get most excited is not in the player versus player crypto casino, or not in the highly technical arguments around one network over another, even though that's super important.
00:52:04.250 - 00:53:20.170, Speaker C: But when you see real world use cases being naturally better, either on bitcoin or on blockchains. And that's where emerging market use cases and uses of stablecoins, bitcoin payments between different communities in Africa, cross border payments across Africa, using bitcoin as a store of value instead of us dollar stablecoins, I think that's where you can get a glimpse. You can think, okay, how does this map, where does this go over the next 10, 20, 30 years? I think that's where you see the future. You're going to see extreme cases where economies collapse or economies go through these significant shocks, and bitcoin specifically, or crypto networks emerge as a kind of backup or replacement. But I think that's going to be on the, that's rarer, and it will only be in extreme situations like war or kind of some kind of economic collapse. What you're instead going to see is slowly but surely economic activity operated on blockchain networks will just become a thing that's happening in the background that we're not entirely aware of. It will just become the rails.
00:53:20.170 - 00:53:25.116, Speaker C: And, yeah, I'm here for the journey because we've got to build it. It's not going to happen automatically.
00:53:25.268 - 00:53:58.952, Speaker A: Yeah, I absolutely agree that it just makes sense for most of economic activity to happen on chain, just a better infrastructure for finance. So, yeah, it's a matter of time, in my opinion. But thinking about crypto and blockchains right now and not 2030 years into the future, why would someone who wants to use defi choose bitcoin over some of the maybe more liquid ecosystems?
00:53:59.056 - 00:54:04.880, Speaker C: So bitcoin the asset or a bitcoin? L two? Because if it's bitcoin, the asset, I mean, bitcoin is still the.
00:54:05.040 - 00:54:09.464, Speaker A: No, no. Yeah, no, I mean defi bitcoin.
00:54:09.512 - 00:54:09.840, Speaker C: Right.
00:54:09.920 - 00:54:15.192, Speaker A: Like wherever it may be on all the different side chains and l two s. Yeah.
00:54:15.216 - 00:54:29.520, Speaker C: I mean, for some. In some ways, the dominant use case of bitcoin today is a bit of a. It's great, but it's got a tragic element to it. Everybody experiences bitcoin. They onboard into crypto through bitcoin. They hold bitcoin in their wallets, and it just sits there.
00:54:29.820 - 00:54:31.804, Speaker A: It sits in centralized exchanges.
00:54:31.892 - 00:56:00.310, Speaker C: Right. It's in centralized exchanges and it doesn't do anything. It's. And, you know, I feel quite strongly that this has to change. Like, you're not going to see a decentralized crypto revolution if you're not able to take those assets and lend them to people, or borrow against them, or collateralize them and turn them into a us dollar stablecoin that you can use to pay a bill, or even taking it above the finance layer, use them to interact with people in a digital environment, pay to access a community, or even, in the case of rootstock, just allow the computational power of bitcoin to secure whatever is important to you, whether it's something personal, like a letter or something financial, like the kind of title deed on your house. So, yeah, I think what Bitcoindefi offers is the opportunity for all the, I believe, hundreds of millions of people out there who hold bitcoin to actually enter this new economy and to interact with this new economy, which is still effectively by comparison to the wider crypto ecosystem, still early and quite dormant. Hodl is great, and it kind of made a lot of sense, but we're kind of past that now.
00:56:00.310 - 00:56:09.054, Speaker C: There's a lot more you can do with your, with your bitcoin and it's part of our job to build out all those different environments and all those different use cases.
00:56:09.182 - 00:56:30.094, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, I love that vision of all the kind of dormant bitcoin hopefully waking up and being put to use on bitcoin defi. So, Daniel, it was great chatting with you about rootstock. One of the main places to make that happen. Thank you so much for taking the time.
00:56:30.182 - 00:56:32.590, Speaker C: Thanks, Camilla. This was great. Thanks for having me. Really appreciate it.
