00:00:02.330 - 00:00:36.162, Speaker A: In DeFi, the possibilities of what can be built to replace legacy finance are endless. But there are a few use cases that every newcomer to DeFi will want to know about and explore early on. Because one, they're easy to understand, and two, battle tested with billions in liquidity and hundreds of thousands of users. And three, although we didn't say three, they're easy to use. Now, first off, you need to know about stablecoins. And these are pretty much exactly what they sound like, a coin that is stable. And if you know your crypto well, that's something to be valued.
00:00:36.162 - 00:01:11.694, Speaker A: And in most cases, that stablecoin is pegged to the US dollar. In the future, we'll see more stablecoins pegged to other fiat. But for now, USD pegged stablecoins are the standard. And you might be surprised to know that there is almost $15 billion in stablecoin liquidity currently on Ethereum. That's a lot. Now, stablecoins have been a huge breakthrough in DeFi because they allow users to transfer value with a reliable price point versus the highly volatile markets normally found in cryptocurrencies. Next up, we have trading in DFI.
00:01:11.694 - 00:01:42.262, Speaker A: Trading happens on decentralized exchanges, or Dexes. A Dex allows buyers and sellers to agree upon a price and exchange assets. Uniswap is one of the most popular Dexes, with over $250 to $500 million in daily trading volume. And the best part of a Dex is traders don't have to trust anyone to hold their assets. So in DeFi, it's a peer to peer exchange. You are always in control of your assets. Lastly, we have lending and borrowing.
00:01:42.262 - 00:02:15.378, Speaker A: Now, when you go to the bank and borrow money, they ask for you to collateralize. Two things, your home and your reputation. But in DeFi, we don't have courts to keep borrowers incentivized to follow through with their contract. So what happens instead is we over collateralize. Borrowers deposit more than the value of what they aim to borrow. And lenders know if borrowers fail to maintain their loan, the DeFi app will auto sell their collateral to pay back the lenders. At the end of the day, borrowers pay lower interest rates and lenders earn higher interest rates.
00:02:15.378 - 00:02:54.490, Speaker A: So it's a win win. So the takeaway here is while DeFi essentially mimics the traditional banking world we all grew up with, this is really about a new way of transacting peer to peer with no minimums, no signups, no permission required, and no middlemen. Sound radical? Well, it kind of is. And that is why DFI is so hot right now. You've been watching DFI 101.
