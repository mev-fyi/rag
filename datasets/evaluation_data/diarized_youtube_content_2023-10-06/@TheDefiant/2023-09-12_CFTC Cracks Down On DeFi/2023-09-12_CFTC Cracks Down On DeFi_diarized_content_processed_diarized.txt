00:00:20.890 - 00:01:08.354, Speaker A: Hey everyone, happy Monday and thank you for joining us for this special live stream that we're doing today. To discuss the CFTC's latest crackdown on Defi, we're joined by Will Warren, co founder and co CEO of Zero X, and Ashley Ebersol, general counsel at Zero X. And of course Owen for now, our staff reporter. And I'm Yyc Trader, your head of news. So Zero X's matcha aggregator was one of the projects targeted specifically by the CFTC. So we're glad to have will and Ashley on the show to tell us what happened and what this action could potentially mean for Defi moving forward. So let's dive straight in.
00:01:08.354 - 00:01:17.160, Speaker A: Start at the beginning. When did the CFTC first get in touch with you guys? You said in a tweet that you've engaged in discussions with them.
00:01:19.210 - 00:01:19.622, Speaker B: Sure.
00:01:19.676 - 00:02:32.206, Speaker C: Well, first I just want to say thank you for having us on today. It's great to be with you all and with your listeners and to discuss what for us are very recent and pertinent issues. I'm Ashley Eversol and like you said in general counsel here, I previously was with the securities and Exchange Commission here in Washington DC for about five years where I was part of the working groups internally that were looking at the agency's approach to the crypto space. So I've been on the regulatory side as well as law firms and now with Zero X. So regarding your question, the CFTC had reached out to us earlier this year and their focus was exactly as last week's order described, leveraged tokens that us users could potentially trade via our matcha platform. The CFTC views these tokens as derivatives that are within its jurisdiction. It does not have jurisdiction over the spot market in tokens that are not derivatives in some way.
00:02:32.206 - 00:04:02.570, Speaker C: So the fact that these offered a multiple return gave them a derivative feature that the CFTC was focused on. I think after discussions with the agency and the staff there as well as our lawyers, we determined to settle a case on terms that we could live with and that we thought could advance DFI's stance with the agency. Our main takeaway is that we're a nascent industry in web three and we're figuring it out alongside regulators. And at this stage there's always some tension between the innovators and regulators that have the laudable duty of looking out for our users. It's uncharted waters on both sides and we always knew that there would be challenges with regulation as we grew, that was expected as this space expanded. This is part of the journey for Zerox and Matcha. We're glad that we were able to address these issues with the CFTC and that it was just a friction point and that we at Matcha and Zero X more broadly and the entire industry, including the other entities that were part of that order, are walking away intact, operating and with greater clarity.
00:04:02.570 - 00:04:23.760, Speaker C: So all in all, we have a very positive outlook for the future. We're operational on Matcha and Matcha does have some tokens that are now restricted for trading by us persons. But beyond that everything's running as usual. So check out matcha Xyz and see for.
00:04:27.090 - 00:04:28.240, Speaker A: Oh, go.
00:04:31.110 - 00:04:55.820, Speaker B: It's Monday morning. I'm trying to get the groundwork back in my. What? When you say restriction for us persons, is that done via. That's done via VPN, I would assume, or kind of based on IP address. Is that how you restrict? And if we're getting into details that we can't discuss, let me know. But is that how you restrict based on.
00:04:57.470 - 00:05:00.300, Speaker C: I can. Sorry. Yeah, go ahead.
00:05:00.750 - 00:06:17.430, Speaker D: Yeah, I can jump in and share a little bit more context about kind of how we were engaging with the CFTC and kind of the outcome. But yeah, before digging into it, just want to echo Ashley's points that, yeah, web three is a nascent industry and we are figuring this out right now. So are the regulators and we're trying to figure out how to make things work and it's challenging and in particular. So for Matcha, I guess before kind of talking about how we responded to the order, like what processes we put in place, I think it's worth kind of highlighting first of all, what is matcha and how does it work? Because the processes that we put in place also are kind of related to how matcha is designed and how it works. Matcha is a Dex aggregator built by Zero X. It is tapping into 100 plus different decentralized exchanges and different liquidity sources that exist across various blockchain networks. It supports eight different EVM blockchains.
00:06:17.430 - 00:07:28.860, Speaker D: It will figure out how to find the best path through all these liquidity sources in order to help users kind of find the best price that's out there in the world. And yeah, more recently we introduced like a gasless trading mode that kind of helps users avoid kind of reverted or failed transactions and also kind of embeds MeV protection. But one of the things that's really interesting about Matcha is that it is kind of similar to a block explorer. So in the same way that Google kind of crawls and indexes every single website that exists out there on the Internet, matcha crawls and indexes every single ERC 20 token that exists on top of the different blockchains we support. And if someone goes and deploys a new token, we'll detect that. Pick it up and you'll be able to search for that token on matcha within minutes. So matcha really isn't like a curated front end experience where we're picking which tokens users can access.
00:07:28.860 - 00:08:17.370, Speaker D: It really is like a block explorer. It's a window into what exists on the blockchain, both in terms of tokens and liquidity. And it's challenging because on one hand, Matcha offers the widest token availability in the entire market. There's over four and a half million tokens that you can search on Matcha. But the challenge here is that since we're providing a window into what exists on the blockchain, we don't necessarily control which tokens people decide to deploy. We don't necessarily understand what those tokens represent. And so kind of curating access to these tokens is a challenging issue.
00:08:17.520 - 00:08:18.026, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:18.128 - 00:09:17.710, Speaker D: The good news is that there aren't any public guidelines on how to approach this problem of providing a window into the blockchain, but doing so in a compliant way. Tokens can represent anything and they can be deployed by anyone permissionlessly. So when the CFTC approached us, they said, look, this is an issue. We have identified some of these assets that you can't be offering these to us people. So essentially what we did is we drafted a proposal and it's a process for kind of automatically detecting and flagging leverage tokens within Macha. And then that would allow us to kind of restrict trading access for us people. And we shared this proposal with the CFTC for review and feedback.
00:09:17.710 - 00:10:12.880, Speaker D: And we received constructive comments back from, you know, we didn't kind of receive a formal blessing or any sort of no action letter, but we did receive kind of a positive response. And they acknowledged that we were quite responsive to their concerns and putting kind of corrective policy in. So that's kind of how things played out. They approached us, they said, look, this is a problem. You can't be offering these tokens to us people. Fix it. And we put together a proposal and worked with them to find something that would mostly satisfy the realities of the product we're building, but also the law.
00:10:13.490 - 00:10:14.722, Speaker B: Yeah, fair enough.
00:10:14.776 - 00:10:57.118, Speaker A: That was actually going to be my next question as well, because I've been using matcha for a long time. Love it. The UX is amazing. And especially with these illiquid tokens that we trade these days and gas fees going up, it's a lot easier to use limit orders and leave them. So that's exactly the thing, right? Like you said, anyone can deploy a token. I can go on March, I'll just paste in the contract address and start trading it immediately. So there's obviously going to be a lag between you guys discovering that, oh, this could be a leveraged or margin token and then blocking it from there.
00:10:57.118 - 00:11:36.330, Speaker A: Like, was there some kind of discussion with the CFTC on that? Do they understand that distinction? I know that some of them do, because we had the dissenting opinion from one of the commissioners who basically said that the CFTC wants defi to register as, what was it? Swap execution facilities and DCMs. FCMs, these are all designations that are meant for centralized companies, right? Like, these regulations were written probably decades ago. So is there even a path to kind of compliance with these laws, or does that raise, open up a whole different can of worms?
00:11:37.390 - 00:12:49.140, Speaker D: Well, Ashley, I'll let you hop in in a sec, but I think that's part of the challenge that we've attempted to address. There really are no public guidelines. There isn't an instruction manual for us to go and look at in terms of how we kind of address this issue. The good news is that by the end of our conversations with the CFTC, it was clear they understand how macho works. They understand the issues we face as a platform that can't manually kind of evaluate the legal status of millions of ERC 20 tokens. They understand those realities in terms of, can the DFI space be compliant? I think the answer is, yeah, we're going to have to engage with regulators and find a way to do so. And right now we're trying to figure out a way to share the process we put in place for matcha, or at least perhaps like the principles behind that process.
00:12:49.140 - 00:13:16.380, Speaker D: It's a very sensitive issue, and so we need to be careful about how we approach this, and we're working through it now, and we're going to be engaging with other players in the industry, like the blockchain association, and kind of figure out how we can approach this issue as an industry. But, yeah, I'll pause there. And, Ashley, if you have anything else to.
00:13:18.830 - 00:14:48.220, Speaker C: You know, I think the choice that we had, which really wasn't a choice for how to move forward as a result of this order, is in order to trade derivative tokens or to permit trading in derivative tokens, an exchange either needs to be regulated. You mentioned SEPs and some of the other types of regulated markets that the CFTC oversees, or we just have to block those tokens for us users, obviously, to register with the CFTC as any of those entity types, a lot of requirements come with those registrations, including things like KYC, which are sort of an impossibility for DeFi entities. So we went the other path and decided to design and implement a system that we thought we could live with and that would achieve the aim of preventing as best we can. And it's showing some good effectiveness at present trading in regulated instruments by US users. So that is the direction we went.
00:14:49.070 - 00:14:49.530, Speaker B: Cool.
00:14:49.600 - 00:15:47.306, Speaker D: Yeah. And to add to that, some. Some of the other kind of large players in the space have abandoned the US market completely and completely blocked us people from accessing their product. Despite the fact that it is challenging to operate as a US company and serving users in the US, we're going to do it. Crypto is a global phenomenon. It's going to play an important role in the future, and the US is going to be a part of it. And so while it can be kind of challenging to navigate the current space, not a lot of regulatory clarity combined with regulation through enforcement, it is challenging to be a company operating here, but it's too important to us.
00:15:47.306 - 00:15:55.534, Speaker D: And yeah, we're going to continue to ensure much is available to us people, but in a compliant way.
00:15:55.732 - 00:16:57.810, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, I would definitely imagine that I can only begin to think of designing a system that would be able to ascertain whether a token is indeed a leveraged or margin. Mean, kudos to taking that on, because know doesn't sound very fun in some ways, of figuring out a system to make that. So. Moving on. I'm curious, because people did point out, and I thought so too, that the southern District of New York seemed to make a ruling somewhat contradictory to the CFTC's ruling in that I think Judge Falia, I might be butchering her name, tossed out a case alleging that uniswap was facilitating scam tokens trading. But they were saying, no, uniswap is just an interface, and they actually don't know who's issuing these tokens, so they can't necessarily.
00:16:57.810 - 00:17:43.520, Speaker B: They don't know who's trading these tokens, so they shouldn't be held liable. I mean, I'm sure there's a legal framework in which to assess all those claims, but maybe this is a question for you, Ashley, but is there a clash there? Are these kind of issuances both possible, or is it possible to kind of thread the needle legally to make both of those, like the CFTC's requirement and the judge's order, do those work together, or do we really need legal clarity to kind of make those rulings cohesive together? Kind of a long winded question.
00:17:44.450 - 00:18:47.254, Speaker C: Sure. No, it's a difficult question because you do have the rizzly be uniswap order from fairly recently. I mean, obviously, we were pretty far down this road by the time that came out. But even all the same, that's in the southern district of New York. It's in a different context. It's private class action litigation, albeit with allegations that brought a similar context in terms of the mechanical workings that underlay it. But, yeah, I guess, suffice to say, when you're in a context like this, you can either engage with a regulator and try to find a solution, or you don't and you resist and you fight it.
00:18:47.254 - 00:19:19.630, Speaker C: And if we were in that posture, yes, the Risley v. Uniswap would have possibly been helpful to us. Obviously, with all the caveats that come with. It's in the southern district of New York, and it technically only applies in the southern district of New York. That sort of. We were. We are not of the size or to be able to take on a fight like that.
00:19:19.630 - 00:19:37.720, Speaker C: And I think that our core focus was getting through this and being able to continue with our core mission of serving our users. And we're happy we were able to do that with a framework, like I said, for compliance that we can live with.
00:19:38.490 - 00:19:39.240, Speaker B: Cool.
00:19:41.210 - 00:20:08.480, Speaker A: I'm glad that you're still looking to stay in the US and push the industry forward, because in traditional banking, we've seen this over the years. If you're outside the US, no one wants to touch you. If you're a US citizen, you don't want to open a bank account, don't want to deal in your investments, how much ever? If you're extremely wealthy, sure. But other than that, we don't want to see Defi go down that same path, right?
00:20:10.050 - 00:20:58.960, Speaker D: Yeah, of course not. I think it's worth kind of calling out what's at stake here. We have a global financial system that isn't perfect. It has flaws, it has inefficiencies. Lots of middlemen, very fragmented and decentralized finance or blockchains. They have the potential to serve as, like, a powerful equalizing force for the world. If anyone with an Internet connection can plug into a kind of global open financial rails, that is something that could be very good for a large percentage of the global population, including people in the US, and it's worth fighting for.
00:20:58.960 - 00:21:15.880, Speaker D: At the same time, I think laws will have to evolve with this disruptive new technology. The laws weren't written with blockchain technology in mind and I'm sure they'll evolve as well, but it's going to be a process.
00:21:18.250 - 00:22:04.414, Speaker B: And how would you say. It seems like this whole year has mean. I'm working on article right now about the CFTC's ruling and it's just been such a roller coaster. I mean, judges, legislation, enforcement like, I guess. How would you characterize the changes over the past couple of years? Because it was the Wild west and now it seems like as Defi is starting to scale and try to become solidly useful to maybe the average, this is this like an inevitable battle? I don't know. How would you say the discussions have changed? Because it seems like I'm seeing more and more. Like you said, the CFTC kind of understands what's at stake.
00:22:04.414 - 00:22:29.100, Speaker B: They understand what matcha is. It seemed like Judge Falia understood what uniswap is. Is the discussion changing from people not knowing what's going on to knowing what's going on and starting to wrestle with what clarity looks like now that everyone is somewhat on the same page, at least about what's happening? Both you guys have been around for a long time.
00:22:31.470 - 00:23:54.294, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe I'll start on this. I think whatever your view of regulation, it's just a fact of life. The more successful web three becomes and D five becomes, the more attention it's going to get and the more there's going to be a need to engage with regulatory requirements. And I think that's true on the regulatory side as well. I think our hope is that through the CFTC action, we were able to work to a solution that, like I said, we could live with and that was acceptable to the agency, ideally going forward with in any other regulatory context. We can handle that at the regulatory level rather than the enforcement context. And I think the entire web three space would love to work alongside regulators to get a system in place that actually is feasible for them.
00:23:54.492 - 00:23:55.238, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:55.404 - 00:24:47.346, Speaker C: Whether that happens or not, I don't have a crystal ball, but otherwise I think you will continue to see a lot of what you've seen. But like you said, these get to there's the regulatory level and then there's the court context. And as you said, some of the court rulings are recognizing things that are views that have been advanced by those in our space and those in the larger digital asset space and saying, you know what, there is something to what that entity is saying, and here's why that changes the analysis. It would be great if we can get ahead of that from a regulatory perspective so we will see, hopefully it goes that direction.
00:24:47.538 - 00:25:11.920, Speaker B: Yeah, it seems complicated how as a non lawyer, just understanding how all these agencies move in parallel seems just like kind of know what's happening. While the SEC and the CFTC are doing what they're doing, the courts are doing what they're doing, legislators are doing what they're doing, and everyone has a slightly different understanding of what's happening. Anyways, I think Yyca's next question.
00:25:12.610 - 00:25:38.860, Speaker A: Yeah, just wanted to ask. There's a general belief in the industry, or at least there has been, that the CFTC would be or is a better regulator for crypto than the SEC, just given the high profile actions et, but given this latest action, first of all, do you agree with that sentiment and do you think that this action changes that at all?
00:25:44.430 - 00:27:14.934, Speaker C: Let me quickly just say my piece, and then I think will has some good viewpoints on this coming from the technical side, as he does, and what we were able to see from the agency. But obviously the CFTC's jurisdiction, as I said, is only for the spot market. It could address fraud or other manipulation in the spot market. But in order for them to squarely have regulation, where you've got to talk about regulated entities and that sort of thing, it needs to be over. Derivatives on spot market crypto, you know, whether or not they are the right regulator or know there is an opening for a regulator of the spot market, whether that's the SEC or CFTC. I guess what I would say, and curious to get will's take afterwards is the CFTC staff that we dealt with were tough but reasonable, and our engagement with them, I think, ultimately can only be characterized as constructive. I was at the SEC, obviously, I know great folks there.
00:27:14.934 - 00:27:33.230, Speaker C: We have not dealt with that context at this point, but we can only hope that they are similarly reasonable and constructive if ever we do cross paths. So, Will, anything from your observation?
00:27:34.530 - 00:28:38.114, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think it's a tricky question because it's kind of hard to say which regulatory agency would be the best one to regulate crypto, because crypto is so many things. And, yeah, kind of one of the core thesis behind zero X protocol. My co founder Amir and I started working on this back in 2016, and that kind of core thesis is carried all the way through to today with matcha. We think that all forms of value are going to be tokenized on public blockchains like Ethereum. So billions of tokenized assets ranging from kind of traditional stocks and startup equity and derivatives and bonds and fiat currencies, all the way to video game items and nfts reputation points. And tokens are an abstraction that really can represent anything. And there are probably verticals or kind of segments of tokens where it really does fall within the jurisdiction of one regulatory body versus another.
00:28:38.114 - 00:29:12.320, Speaker D: And there's probably going to be new, innovative use cases for tokens that we haven't contemplated yet and that I don't know who should regulate these things or if they should be regulated at all. What about NFTs? So I don't know if I directly answered your question, but I do think that the space as a whole is so broad, and it's really kind of hard to kind of map it to a single individual regulatory body.
00:29:12.690 - 00:29:29.700, Speaker B: Yeah, that's helpful context. I mean, just to help understand what we're working with. Right. Because I think mapping is the key word. Trying to understand how this unifying system fits into these regulating bodies seems complicated to me.
00:29:31.270 - 00:29:38.440, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's complicating for them and for us and for everyone involved, but I think that's just the nature of disruptive new technology.
00:29:39.050 - 00:30:16.900, Speaker B: Yeah. Maybe a good segue into just asking, are there events on the horizon? Maybe this is more for you, Ashley, but either or are there events on the horizon that you see as kind of giving the next boost of. I mean, everyone says regulatory clarity. Are there things you're looking at like people say, new head of the SEC. I know there are some major bills moving through Congress right now. Are there major events that the casual or just the focused crypto investor should be paying attention to moving forward?
00:30:19.590 - 00:30:24.190, Speaker C: I guess I'd say I'm not the one to look to for investment advice.
00:30:24.350 - 00:30:27.940, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, not investment advice, just like, sure.
00:30:32.250 - 00:31:50.030, Speaker C: Many reasons not to do that. But, yes, look, as was referenced earlier, the past few months, really, this summer, there were some court decisions that came out that were, I think, laid down principles that will advance the digital asset space, the DeFi space, as long as they stand. And those same decisions were probably setbacks for the SEC's enforcement agenda. But that said, I don't have a feeling that the SEC is still here. It's still very active, and we'll see what ultimately happens in those decisions. But look, the way that they went was obviously the way that our industry would have preferred rather than the alternative. And I think it does provide some useful precedents for folks in our industry.
00:31:50.030 - 00:33:06.658, Speaker C: There are obviously some still pending decisions, the Coinbase, the SEC case being one that probably, whichever way that goes, will bring clarity. I think that there were some very persuasive briefs written in that case, including by securities law scholars from the legal academy that made good points and did a lot of research that many people don't have the ability to do and that could really inform this debate. So I think in the court context, there could be developments that end up being quite salient on the legislative side. Look, there are, as you identified, some pieces of legislation that could provide a lot of clarity. There have been for each of the last two years. None has yet made it far enough to become law. So that's sort of yet to be known.
00:33:06.658 - 00:33:16.246, Speaker C: What will come of that this legislative year? Hopefully there is further clarity in some fashion.
00:33:16.438 - 00:33:30.542, Speaker B: Yeah. Cool. Well, yeah, just good to know. Looking forward, because it always seems like there's these new rulings and kind of figuring it out. I always feel like I'm writing about, oh, this is the big ruling. Like the Coinbase v. Sec is like the one.
00:33:30.542 - 00:33:39.330, Speaker B: And then it's just hard to figure out what this, the varying significances of various rulings and legislative proposals and so forth.
00:33:41.110 - 00:34:27.506, Speaker A: Just wanted to switch gears a little bit and talk about this Reddit post that's been kind of getting traction this morning as a kind of fallout from the ruling. I guess. I guess this is like worst case scenario, people sounding the alarm. But basically what they're trying to say is that US citizens will be essentially blocked from Defi using these various tools like chain analysis, IP metadata tracking, stuff like that, which most of these firms already have. Right. And there's no real regulation to do with that data, like blockchain specific transaction data I don't think is protected by any privacy statutes that I know of. Could be wrong.
00:34:27.506 - 00:34:58.860, Speaker A: But yeah. Just wanted to get your thoughts on what the implications could be because this post goes on to quote something, where is it a regulator should aim to identify the national person's KYC, essentially. Right. So how would defi, I guess, effectively block us users? I guess those processes will evolve over.
00:35:04.830 - 00:35:10.430, Speaker C: Probably will, would be better to speak to that from a technical perspective.
00:35:11.730 - 00:36:15.010, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I didn't read the post and I don't know what claims are being made in the post. It did kind of glance, I didn't mean to put you on the, it did seem like potentially, I do think that folks, and maybe rightly so, when they see some sort of order or enforcement action in the defi space, they naturally get worried. And sometimes folks do kind of go down the slippery slope and jump to conclusions that the world is ending and it's all over for DeFi or something like that. DeFi is not going anywhere. It's just going through its infancy. And I'm not really sure the specific claims that Reddit post is making around kind of how to track or kind of ensure us people can't access specific tokens. But yeah, I mean, generally I would say go talk to a lawyer, go get some counsel.
00:36:15.010 - 00:36:18.680, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:36:22.410 - 00:37:10.280, Speaker C: I pulled up what I think you're referring to, and I also haven't had a chance to read through or digest all of this, but part of it that I see is, I think, look, this was a significant event. It was a significant event for our sector. The CFTC action against this I'm referring to and against two others in this space. And it was significant for us, certainly. I don't want to minimize, you know, forecast. Know, the entire industry is about to be forced to do things and that sort of thing. I mean, again, the CFTC is a powerful agency, but its jurisdiction is only over derivative tokens at present.
00:37:10.280 - 00:37:37.360, Speaker C: So that is a slice of the overall market. So I think based on this action from last week alone, some of the commentary here is a little bit outsized in terms of reading more broadly beyond what the CFTC actually does.
00:37:38.210 - 00:38:12.170, Speaker D: Yeah. And I'll also add to that, it kind of sounds like, yeah, I mean, we're not going anywhere. We're staying in the US. We're going to continue serving folks in the US to the best of our ability in a compliant way. I know some folks look at this stuff, they pack up their bags or they consider moving jurisdictions. We're not doing that. We're going to continue to serve us people through matcha until something changes.
00:38:12.170 - 00:38:15.740, Speaker D: And at the moment, we're quite comfortable with our current position.
00:38:16.750 - 00:38:27.040, Speaker B: Cool. Because the tokens represent a pretty small portion of Matcha's trading volume. Right. I think I saw it was like 0.1 are potential derivatives or something like that.
00:38:27.810 - 00:38:55.414, Speaker D: Yeah, it was a very insignificant amount of usage. I think in the order they highlighted four specific leverage tokens. And frankly, it was kind of the first time I was even aware these things existed. And I don't really think these were kind of the tokens that people were coming to visit Matcha to find.
00:38:55.612 - 00:39:36.740, Speaker B: Yeah, it is funny. I mean, there was that enforcement action against an NFT project a couple of weeks ago, which also was kind of, has anyone heard of them? Situation. So it's funny that some of these actions are catching these kind of edge cases or not core crypto use cases, but they're kind of, I mean, I think some of the nuances lost on social media about what they mean. And it's also interesting that regulators are choosing to kind of or are finding fault with projects which aren't necessarily like, I think, core to the kind of focus of where crypto is. Yeah, it's good not to conflate what's happening.
00:39:37.270 - 00:40:07.180, Speaker A: Yeah. Switching gears a bit, I'd like to ask you guys about matcha and what you guys have been building recently. I know you're running a campaign with dbank. I just want to get an idea of what that is because even dbank has been making a huge push with their l two and the messaging system, and everyone's focused on friend tech and lens, but there are so many of these web three messaging tools that are popping up. So, yeah, I would love to hear more.
00:40:08.430 - 00:40:25.620, Speaker D: Shoot. I'm aware of the debank campaign, and I am aware of kind of the high level details, but I actually am not super sure about some of the lower level details of the dbank campaign or how it works, but it looks really interesting.
00:40:27.670 - 00:40:40.730, Speaker A: And what do you think of social phi as a sector? I'm sure your feed, like most of ours, is just full of friendtech, either keys or analysis on how this is the best farm ever, et cetera.
00:40:41.550 - 00:41:16.050, Speaker D: I have one comment on friendtech. I neither like or dislike it, but I am irritated that they chose to not have keys represented as ERC 20 tokens and instead chose to use a different abstraction that kind of locks users in. I think one of the amazing things about smart contract platforms is composability and interoperable building blocks. And I think it's a missed opportunity for friendtech to create kind of an open ecosystem where kind of keys are tokens.
00:41:17.030 - 00:41:36.570, Speaker A: I'm guessing they probably didn't want people to find a way to get out of paying the fees. Right, because it is steep 10% on buying and selling. That's basically what's, I think, keeping at least creators engaged. Right? Because if your keys are highly priced, you're making bank just from trading fees.
00:41:41.070 - 00:41:58.594, Speaker B: No, but I feel you. It would have been nice to see ERC. I was talking to Lucas Vogelsong of centrifuge doing the RWA work, and yeah, he said the same thing. He was like, man, ERC 20s are the best thing crypto has got going. So I feel your pain. I understand that. All right.
00:41:58.594 - 00:42:00.580, Speaker B: Why we see we got any more questions?
00:42:02.070 - 00:42:16.310, Speaker A: I'm good. In terms of regulation, I think we've covered everything we wanted to. What about you guys? Anything more you'd like to share before we wrap up? And thanks again for joining us and shedding light on this. Like you said, it is a big event for Defi.
00:42:18.170 - 00:43:12.540, Speaker D: Yeah, of course. Thank you for having us on. Yeah, I guess just want to reemphasize that crypto is a global phenomenon and it is important that the US is able to participate, and it's important to us that matcha remains a tool that is available. And so we're going to do everything we can to make sure that we can continue to offer matcha to people in the US in a compliant way. And also that we learned a lot from this process. And overall it was a very constructive one. And at this very moment, we're kind of working through how we can help kind of provide some of this clarity to others in the industry and hopefully allow this to be beneficial for others in the space.
00:43:12.990 - 00:43:13.740, Speaker B: Cool.
00:43:17.550 - 00:43:38.634, Speaker D: Other than that, yeah. Thank you for having us on. Other than that, I would highly encourage folks to check out matcha. I think you'll really like it. It's a very unique product experience and you're going to get incredible coverage of tokens and networks. And the pricing is excellent. So give it a shot.
00:43:38.634 - 00:43:40.914, Speaker D: Check it out. Thank you.
00:43:40.952 - 00:43:41.540, Speaker B: Definitely.
00:43:41.910 - 00:44:01.480, Speaker A: Like I said, I've used it for a while. Just one thing that bugs me a lot is that it doesn't work properly for me on Firefox. For some reason. Chrome is fine, but when I use it in Firefox, I can't switch the duration. I'm stuck at a 1 hour limit order. I don't know why. And there are a few people who have the same issue.
00:44:02.170 - 00:44:02.870, Speaker D: Okay.
00:44:03.020 - 00:44:04.550, Speaker A: May want to take a look at.
00:44:04.700 - 00:44:09.606, Speaker D: We're going to get on this today, hopefully check in 24 hours and hopefully there will be a fix.
00:44:09.788 - 00:44:13.246, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks again, guys. Great having you on the show.
00:44:13.428 - 00:44:14.380, Speaker B: All right, thank you so much.
