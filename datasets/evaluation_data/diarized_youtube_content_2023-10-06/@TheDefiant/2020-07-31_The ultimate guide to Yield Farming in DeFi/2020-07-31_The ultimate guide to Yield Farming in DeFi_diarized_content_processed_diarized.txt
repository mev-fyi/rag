00:00:00.170 - 00:00:43.990, Speaker A: I don't know about you, but every single day my inbox is full of messages, blogs, articles about one thing, yield farming, which is literally the hottest topic in defi, which is the hottest topic in crypto right now. But do you understand it? I think I do, sort of. Some of it. Well, that's the problem, you see, because it is quite challenging. This is the defiant. Okay, firstly, let me just say that nothing you see in this video should be taken as financial advice. This is an examination of what's happening in Defi, not a roadmap to future prosperity.
00:00:43.990 - 00:01:08.178, Speaker A: So please do your own research. And with that out of the way, let's get our wellies on and go digging in the fertile fields of yield farming. Unless you've been living under a rock, you will no doubt have seen all the excitement surrounding governance tokens like comp and bal yielding interest rates as high as 100%. What is going on?
00:01:08.264 - 00:01:09.906, Speaker B: Well, there is only one person to.
00:01:09.928 - 00:01:26.790, Speaker A: Ask, and that is, of course, Camilla, yield farming. It's had a profound effect on the crypto market in general. But can you explain to me what the appeal of it is and why people are going so crazy for it?
00:01:26.860 - 00:02:22.502, Speaker C: So, yield farming, I think, has two main appeals for people. One is definitely owning a piece of the app that you're using, like owning a piece of the protocol. There's this great concept that investor Jesse Weldon likes to talk about, which is a new ownership economy. And it's this idea that through these tokens, you can have greater ownership and participation in these protocols and applications, and participate in governance and have a say on how these things are run. But the second reason why this is so attractive is simply people like to make money. And I think that's what's driving a lot of the activity. Most of the activity, probably, if we're being honest, more than the lofty goals of decentralized governance.
00:02:22.502 - 00:02:34.798, Speaker C: People are drawn by the 1000% yields. Basically, that's what's going on. People are putting money into these protocols, depositing funds to get these governance tokens in return.
00:02:34.884 - 00:02:41.818, Speaker B: And as you spend more time in this space, you quickly realize that there is a whole lot to talk about, including, of course, the risks.
00:02:41.914 - 00:03:21.462, Speaker D: But first, let's do a quick recap on Defi. What we're talking about here is an ecosystem of decentralized applications, enabling anyone with an Internet connection to access a variety of financial products and services, spanning crypto asset exchanges, margin trading, financial derivatives, synthetic assets, algorithmic trading and lending markets. Got it. But the biggest change to come about recently is from protocols like balancer and compound, distributing their own native tokens to incentivize liquidity, increasing activity and returns for traders as these tokens gain in value. So this is what we're really talking about with farming, planting seeds and reaping crops in the form of these additional tokens. And appropriately enough, I have some lego in front of me to demonstrate. So here's how it works.
00:03:21.462 - 00:04:07.866, Speaker D: You start with a token, let's say dai, which you place in compound. Now, there's an interest rate for leaving the dai there, which you will earn more dai with. Very nice. But on top of that, you earn comp, a governance token, which is also yours and which also has value. And those are yours to withdraw whenever you like and do with what you feel like. Happy farming. The thing is, given the amount of competition between investors as well as high gas prices yield, farming is only really profitable if you're willing to put a significant sum of money to work.
00:04:07.866 - 00:04:23.778, Speaker D: I mean, we're talking big bucks here. If you're only farming with, say, $100 to $1,000 in crypto, that'll probably result in a net loss. And if you're tinkering with small amounts to understand how it all works, that's okay, but that strategy won't be profitable. But let's go deep and take a.
00:04:23.784 - 00:04:39.366, Speaker A: Closer look at liquidity pools. Centralized exchanges like binance and Coinbase enable trading through an order book. All orders set by traders are put into the order book and matched based on a trader's desired price and the.
00:04:39.388 - 00:04:40.194, Speaker D: Size of the trade.
00:04:40.242 - 00:04:56.742, Speaker A: But in DeFi, liquidity is provided by automated market makers, or Amms, where a traditional exchange needs a market maker to ensure its order book is liquid, amms pull liquidity from various users and execute it based on a given equation. So it's all maths, and this equation.
00:04:56.806 - 00:04:58.486, Speaker D: Varies for each amm.
00:04:58.598 - 00:05:30.562, Speaker A: Now, anyone can be a liquidity provider on these Dexs. There is no capital restriction. You can put in as much or as little as you want. And adding liquidity to an Amm like uniswap or balancer is actually quite simple. And you can use one of the many dashboards or mobile wallets around, like instadap, Xerion, or Arjun. It's important for people to add liquidity to Defi's Amms, as this gives these DeXs, or decentralized exchanges, the capability to serve a larger number of customers. Moreover, increased liquidity can attract crypto speculators who trade larger volumes.
00:05:30.562 - 00:06:06.114, Speaker A: Now, right now, the liquidity of Dexes is inadequate for large traders, meaning that working as a liquidity provider is a critical service for these exchanges. So how do you make money? The trick is to spot where an outsider's return appears and exploit it early. Yes, the interest is great, but the rates aren't particularly exciting. It's those secondary tokens that are the multiplier. For instance, 2880 comp are issued every day, so users receive what is essentially free money every 24 hours. And with comp trading above $150, well.
00:06:06.152 - 00:06:07.780, Speaker D: That'S not bad, is it?
00:06:09.430 - 00:06:56.766, Speaker A: Compound wasn't the first to do this either. Synthetics introduced an S ETH to ETH pool that offers liquidity providers the added incentive of SNX rewards. And synthetics currently has two substantial liquidity incentives, an SBTC pool and an SUSD pool on curve, again, paying out rewards in SNX. And I realize as I'm saying this, that it probably sounds like complete gobbledygook. But if you don't understand what any of that means, or what wrapped tokens are, don't worry, we will cover it in a future video. Another interesting one is Ampleforth, which recently announced their geezer, or Geyser, or Geyser, their so called smart faucet that will distribute ample tokens to liquidity providers. And so far, users have locked twelve and a half million dollars in the geyser, geyser, geyser.
00:06:56.766 - 00:07:21.818, Speaker A: And just check out the interest rate. And yes, there's a disclaimer here, which is that the APY doesn't take into account any loss in value in the underlying asset. So if the market goes down, that's on you. But come on. So this is really the main appeal of yield farming. It works essentially like a high yield savings account, and when the interest rate drops, you can go on a site like defi rate, look for a better opportunity, and just keep going.
00:07:21.984 - 00:07:24.346, Speaker D: Your money can do so much for.
00:07:24.368 - 00:08:06.262, Speaker A: You and Defi, and I think that's why it's so exciting. But I know what you're thinking. If something looks too good to be true, well, you know. So you can't really talk about DeFi without talking about the risks. Like hacks balancer drained of half a million dollars, facilitated by a Didx flash loan using an exploit they'd already been warned about, or the D four's ecosystem protocol lend f me relieved of a mere $25 million. Or even that fateful day, March twelveth, when the price of ETH fell sharply, causing makerdao to be under collateralized by around $2 million. There were lots of liquidations, and now there's a lawsuit, and it's likely we'll see many, many more.
00:08:06.262 - 00:08:09.846, Speaker A: But beyond that, there's so much irrational price discovery going on.
00:08:09.868 - 00:08:11.618, Speaker D: I mean, just look at comp, all.
00:08:11.644 - 00:08:26.846, Speaker A: The sudden, 27% interest on bat tokens, for instance. It will, of course, settle down as the space matures. But, yeah, it's risky. I'm reminded of the quote from Wall street where Michael Douglas stands up in front of a room full of people.
00:08:26.868 - 00:08:36.402, Speaker D: And he says, greed, ladies and gentlemen, for want of a better word, greed is good. Greed is right. Greed works.
00:08:36.536 - 00:08:43.570, Speaker A: And I wonder if, for crypto, greed in a sense drives innovation. What do you think?
00:08:43.720 - 00:09:10.300, Speaker C: Oh, definitely. I think we've seen evidence of this throughout crypto's history. I think the best example is the IcO boom, 2017. It drew in billions of dollars and thousands of people to human capital into the space. A lot of those people then left. A lot of them lost money. But in the end.
00:09:12.130 - 00:09:13.070, Speaker E: It brought in.
00:09:13.140 - 00:09:47.190, Speaker C: Investment in many of the protocols that are leading the space today. Like synthetics, zero X Kyber network. All of these names raised money back then. And so what's happening now will be similar. We're seeing kind of this new inflow of money and attention, and some things will break. There will be scammers, some people will lose money. I think the outcome will be more innovation and we'll learn from the mistakes that surely are being made right now.
00:09:47.260 - 00:10:04.560, Speaker A: Now, you'd be forgiven for thinking that this was just a bunch of eggheads sitting around in a room experimenting with money and experimenting with economics. And this won't really have any lasting impact. But let me leave you with a startling statistic. The Defi market cap has tripled in three months, is now sitting just shy of seven and a half billion dollars.
00:10:05.170 - 00:10:06.446, Speaker D: That's a lot.
00:10:06.628 - 00:10:37.910, Speaker A: The teams behind these new protocols are active in Telegram and discord. You can engage with them and help steer the direction of this brave new world. That's exciting, but it's also scary because smart contracts are relatively new tech. There are hacks seemingly weekly now, so just be sure you know what you're getting into.

I've been Robin Schmidt, creative director of Harmony, alongside Camilla Russo, and this was the defiant.
00:10:38.570 - 00:10:43.122, Speaker E: Been a little nice to y'all. Now I gotta up price for y'all. Snake eyes on dice.
00:10:43.186 - 00:10:46.520, Speaker A: What is going on and what does it all mean? Hello.
00:10:48.970 - 00:10:50.254, Speaker D: Wonderful. Farming it.
00:10:50.292 - 00:10:52.426, Speaker E: I'm flipping the balls, flipping the, flipping.
00:10:52.458 - 00:10:54.560, Speaker D: The whole record off that didn't work.
00:10:55.010 - 00:10:55.740, Speaker E: When he got it.
