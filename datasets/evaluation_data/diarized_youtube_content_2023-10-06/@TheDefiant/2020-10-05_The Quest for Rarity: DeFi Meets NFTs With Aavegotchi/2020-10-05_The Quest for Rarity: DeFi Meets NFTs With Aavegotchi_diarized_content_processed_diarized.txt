00:00:00.410 - 00:00:09.118, Speaker A: This week we're taking a much needed break from food fight to explore one of the fastest growing categories of tokens that nobody's really talking about yet.
00:00:09.204 - 00:00:10.446, Speaker B: Stop ignoring me.
00:00:10.548 - 00:00:16.590, Speaker A: Nfts. Nonfungible tokens. If it's funging you're after, then you've come to the wrong funging place.
00:00:16.660 - 00:00:17.518, Speaker B: What did he say?
00:00:17.604 - 00:00:20.702, Speaker C: Funging. Urban slang. Feeling and looking good.
00:00:20.756 - 00:00:57.854, Speaker A: Now, there is a problem you encounter when talking about NFTs, and that is that it's possible to talk about them without. Well, you know what? Creeping in at every opportunity, journalists just can't seem to help themselves, knowingly referencing it whenever discussing non fungies. It's wild success. Seemingly yet another example of crypto's dumb, irrational exuberance. Because that's all there is to NFTs. You just can't escape them, no matter how hard you try. But.
00:00:57.854 - 00:01:19.702, Speaker A: And stick with me. Now, as we lollop gaily through some verbal gymnastics, if you take the word non fungible, strip off the back end and bring what's left to the proximal of your labial cleft, then you're left with non. And in French that's non no, which means no, as in no, we won't be lazy. And no, we won't default to comparing everything to. God damn it, where are they coming from?
00:01:19.756 - 00:01:23.030, Speaker B: I think you might want to pick a more masculine note.
00:01:23.370 - 00:01:30.680, Speaker A: No. It's time we took ourselves far, far away. Get ready for NFT 3.0.
00:01:39.890 - 00:01:40.830, Speaker B: The camera.
00:01:55.190 - 00:02:20.950, Speaker D: Stood a chance. They came from everywhere, suffocating. The very landscape multiplying beyond control. If you can hear this message, just know one thing. There is hope. A portal somewhere in this desolate land. Somehow we must find other gotchi.
00:02:30.210 - 00:02:51.550, Speaker E: And yeah, I've done things I'm not proud of those damn kitties. Just an experiment, they said. And they let it get out of control. Nobody understood what was really going on. This all started with tokens. Get them into as many hands as possible, they said. Broad distribution.
00:02:51.630 - 00:02:52.594, Speaker F: Everyone, welcome.
00:02:52.712 - 00:03:03.046, Speaker E: Okay. Okay. But then came the NFts. Limited distribution in as few hands as possible. Scarcity. Value. But they didn't understand the power.
00:03:03.046 - 00:03:19.846, Speaker E: Nobody did. Why did they come? The farmers? The chance, the woe jacks? Because they had the power ripped from their hands and they wanted it back. Even if that meant war. But the tokens. Tokens. Regular tokens. There was no power there.
00:03:19.846 - 00:03:41.810, Speaker E: Only the illusion of power. NFts, nFts, NFts. Yes. Then they had the power, the agency, to choose their own destiny. Somewhere out there, the ghosts of liquidated yield farmers. We will honor them. We will honor that familia.
00:03:41.810 - 00:03:44.180, Speaker E: I must find them.
00:03:46.090 - 00:04:02.810, Speaker D: What people never realized the so called tokens lived and died at the mercy of the market and the humans who built them. The NFts change all that now. The owner created the value, the life.
00:04:02.880 - 00:04:05.210, Speaker E: Force of what they owned.
00:04:05.550 - 00:04:20.750, Speaker D: The key to finding the Avagotchi is to understand there is no value but what we make. Make it well, and the portal will be revealed.
00:04:27.430 - 00:04:34.850, Speaker E: They did it. They goddamn did it. Diverse NFTs with defi.
00:04:42.010 - 00:05:22.690, Speaker F: Between the nether realm and the world of humans lies a third space, the ether realm. Powerful wizards known as summoners have built arcane magical portals that allow humans to summon avagatchis from the nether. However, to complete this process, Avagatchis must be staked with a certain amount of spirit force known in the human realm as ababacked erc tokens, or atokens. A tokens generate yields via Abba's lending pool, which increases the quantity of a tokens held in the wallet. To open a portal, you will need ghost token, which can only be acquired.
00:05:29.850 - 00:06:30.090, Speaker E: Ghost? What ghost? I can't stay here. Too exposed. Follow the curve. What does it mean? Only one way to find out. Open the kitchen. Cats on the menu. And it tastes delicious.
00:06:30.090 - 00:07:02.178, Speaker E: Let's dance. For months I wondered, looking in vain for signs of the curve. But there were none. Only pain, death and barbecued kitty flesh. There was no escape from Beelzebub's hellcats of death. I had no choice but to consult the oracle. My last hope.
00:07:02.178 - 00:07:20.140, Speaker E: But I could only use it once and that it would be destroyed forever. Help me. Go, peterly. You're my only hope.
00:07:22.510 - 00:07:23.946, Speaker G: How can I help you, friend?
00:07:24.048 - 00:07:28.122, Speaker E: I've been chasing a ghost. I just want to know why is it so important?
00:07:28.256 - 00:07:42.474, Speaker G: The name Ghost Avagatchi is about the hottest NFT in the land. Surely you've heard of it. Every time a new ghost token is born, a new community member rises from the ashes to help take over the NFT and defi landscape.
00:07:42.522 - 00:07:43.802, Speaker E: And why is it purple?
00:07:43.946 - 00:07:47.666, Speaker G: Purple, blue, color? Doesn't matter. Only the community.
00:07:47.848 - 00:07:50.562, Speaker E: Now, how do I find him? How do I get there?
00:07:50.696 - 00:07:56.390, Speaker G: Go where the sand meets the sky, friend. That's where you will find the porter. To the ether realm.
00:07:58.490 - 00:08:09.774, Speaker B: All right, I can do that's.
00:08:09.922 - 00:08:38.160, Speaker E: This world is a closed loop. I keep going round and round and back again to the same place. Nothing will be won by standing still. If we detace victory, it will be here upon this hill. And know this, whatever happens, I gave it my all. Because wherever it is, I plead for you.
00:09:01.310 - 00:09:37.490, Speaker H: Daico is a fundraising model far superior to the age old Ico Vitalik. Of course, the funds that flow to a daico are controlled by a tap. This tap represents the promise and the responsibility that belong on the shoulders of the development team. Community controls the tap and can increase or decrease the flow of funds over time. This means that all of the dai collected by the ghost token sale is controlled by the avagatchi dao.
00:09:38.490 - 00:10:03.306, Speaker F: Congratulations. You have found the bonding curve. Ghost for die. A worthy exchange. Now you have the power to open a portal. Upon opening the portal, you discover ten different avagatchis lurking within. You will be forced to make a choice.
00:10:03.306 - 00:10:14.798, Speaker F: Depending on the rarity of its traits, each avagatchi will require a different amount of staked collateral to summon. Stake that amount to the avagatchi of your choice.
00:10:14.894 - 00:10:15.540, Speaker G: As.
00:10:18.310 - 00:10:34.870, Speaker F: Congratulations, you can now dress your avagatchi with wearables. ERC 721 one five five. To alter its traits, it can wear many hats or whatever you fancy to adapt its skills.
00:10:38.490 - 00:11:01.840, Speaker H: This is the promise of dynamic rarity, where an avagati can change itself over time, fixing flaws in their personality or increasing the best attributes they already have, with the ultimate result being the avagatchi's overall rarity score increasing into the best percentile possible.
00:11:02.370 - 00:11:05.310, Speaker F: We call this rarity farming.
00:11:15.370 - 00:11:16.120, Speaker B: O.
00:11:43.090 - 00:11:53.710, Speaker E: The future is only half written. But it was written in the blazing fire of ghost blood. The blood from the Ava gotchi.
00:12:05.370 - 00:12:06.120, Speaker B: Um.
00:12:08.330 - 00:12:19.798, Speaker E: Scarcity value. A fucking plane? There's no planes in the future. They've all been shot down by the cryptokitties. There's one bang. Dead.
00:12:19.894 - 00:12:30.402, Speaker A: What's just happened? I basically crashed a drone into this huge tree and now I'm going to retrieve it because it's my responsibility.
00:12:30.566 - 00:12:32.160, Speaker E: The intrepid out.
00:12:33.170 - 00:12:34.570, Speaker I: Can't handle wood.
00:12:34.650 - 00:12:38.458, Speaker E: In he goes. Good thing we're insured.
00:12:38.554 - 00:12:48.718, Speaker A: But not for him. I'm going in. Oh, look. There it is. This drone has seen some action.
00:12:48.894 - 00:12:54.500, Speaker I: Flight test. Does it still fly? That's the question.
00:12:56.010 - 00:13:05.880, Speaker A: We have crashed the drone from a tree there. All the way down, and we were flying it up there. And that is. That's a long way.
00:13:06.890 - 00:13:10.470, Speaker I: Let's see. Does it fly? Does it fly?
00:13:13.370 - 00:13:21.120, Speaker B: What? It. You.
