00:00:01.290 - 00:00:29.634, Speaker A: Cool. Thanks for joining everyone. Know we have super packed calendars, but really excited to chat with the group here. Fintech and crypto nerds. Ton of stuff going on Twitter in the last few months talking about ways Fintech and Defi can collaborate. So I wanted to bring a group together with kind of the most thoughtful people. I think we all know each other in passing, but just get a roundtable going to ask some questions and get some thoughts going around ways to bridge this kind of defi plus fintech areas of collaboration.
00:00:29.634 - 00:00:35.320, Speaker A: So yeah, thanks everyone for the time. Super stoked to kick things off. Camilla, turn it to you.
00:00:36.330 - 00:01:24.166, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, Bruno. So the Defiant will be hosting this roundtable and super thrilled to be doing that. I think Fintech and Defi are in these weirdly separate camps, but I don't think they should be so very happy to get this group together. I'm Camila Russo, the founder of the Defiant. I'll be leading the panel conversation and then I will introduce all the panelists. So on the defi side we have Lex, he is the head economist at consensus. Santiago Rail Santos, he's an angel investor in the crypto space.
00:01:24.166 - 00:02:21.980, Speaker B: Spencer Noon, an investor at variant, Dan Spencer, co founder at Framework Ventures. And on the fintech side we have Keith Gross, he is head of the international business of Plaid. Nick Milanovich, Simon Taylor, co founder at Eleven FS, and Bruno, who put this all together, his business on corporate development at Plaid. So welcome everyone. I think that was kind of really brief intro to all these awesome panelists. So I'll let them kind of explain a bit more about kind of their goals and outfits and then we can get to the panel. So Lex, why don't you start?
00:02:23.790 - 00:03:00.754, Speaker C: And it's actually terrifying to see all of these Twitter people live and that we're all the same. That super freaks me out and clearly needs to change as well. I feel like if I need maybe like a half shaven beard and glasses, and then we'll all be the crypto punks party avatars. Okay. After that self dig. I'm really excited about this event and this conversation because I've kind of bet my career on this convergence of DeFi and fintech. For consensus.
00:03:00.754 - 00:03:23.520, Speaker C: I head up crypto economics as well as think about marketing and our product development and financial services. Previously I was a fintech entrepreneur building out robo advisors and then had this realization that distributing the old stuff isn't nearly as good as making the new stuff. And that's why I'm so interested in what DeFi is doing today.
00:03:25.570 - 00:03:28.110, Speaker B: Awesome. Santiago.
00:03:30.050 - 00:04:14.154, Speaker D: Yeah, really, again, echoing what Lex said, been interested in this sort of this nagging idea that finance hasn't really caught up to the Internet in many ways. I think bitcoin for the first time showed us what is possible to move money in a seamless way. I think anyone that has traveled, anyone that has lived in overseas countries understands that Venmo doesn't work internationally, it doesn't work as seamlessly. And it's just been sort of a nagging frustration of mine in that journey. Everything led me to DeFi, been investing in DeFi, kind of more very focused over the last two, three years. And I think we're seeing this intersection. We see folks like revolute, PayPal, these were like dream headlines that when I first started investing this space in 2012, you never imagined like JPMorgans of the world getting involved in this space.
00:04:14.154 - 00:04:38.050, Speaker D: But I think it's real. I think they understand the business potential. Look, I'll be the first one to tell you DFI is not perfect. There's a lot of challenges. So I'm actually really excited to have this discussion that touches not only about, look, DFI is all wonderful or fintech is all wonderful, let's actually talk about the things that can push us forward because there is a lot of intersection, as like I said. So I think in that convergence, it's not perfect. I think it will require a lot of things to stitch together.
00:04:38.050 - 00:04:52.570, Speaker D: But I'm quite optimistic. I think a lot of people in crypto inherently say we're going to blow up finance as we know it, and I think that's not going to be the case. I think I'm more of the mind that there will be a lot of value in aggregators and traditional financial firms interacting with Defi.
00:04:56.230 - 00:05:40.000, Speaker E: Spencer hey everyone, I'm Spencer Noon at variant. Variant is we invest in early stage projects, protocols, kind of among other categories. I also wrote a newsletter called our network, which is about on chain analytics and getting all of this data off of blockchains because there's kind of a lot to dig into. And so yeah, I'm super excited to talk today about this topic. I think there was maybe 24 months ago, not a lot that we could have done. It's pretty ripe. So yeah, excited to dig in.
00:05:42.530 - 00:06:30.020, Speaker F: Vance hey everyone, I'm Vancer, co founder of Framework. Framework is a crypto venture fund and also a company that largest consumer of defi services writ large. Most of the derivative platforms, most of the borrow end platforms. We have an entire team in a separate business that is purpose built, use these protocols in a productive way. And so I think a lot of comes from the perspective of not only being a venture investor, but also just being a large user of most of these services. Yeah, excited to have this chat. I think it's been a long time coming, the fintech and the defi side together, and I think we've got valuable insight to share across both sides of the business.
00:06:41.980 - 00:06:46.280, Speaker B: Sorry, on the fintech side, I was saying let's start with Keith.
00:06:47.260 - 00:07:27.600, Speaker G: Hey, everyone, I'm Keith Gross. I lead the international business for Plaid. We're the world's leading open banking platforms. You can think of us as the layer in between traditional brick and mortar financial institutions and fintech applications. And I'm personally really passionate about DeFi and really excited to think about what's the bridge between fintech and decentralized finance and bring some of that perspective to this conversation as well. Camila, I think you're on mute.
00:07:29.060 - 00:07:36.690, Speaker B: I'll stop putting myself on mute. I was saying. Yeah, let's go with Nick next.
00:07:38.500 - 00:08:44.392, Speaker H: Thanks for having me. Really excited to talk with this group. I've been working in fintech for about ten years now, and it's been really interesting to watch the space evolve. And for all the evolution in fintech, a consistent narrative has been democratization of finance and disintermediating traditional gatekeepers. But if you look at how a lot of consumer fintech has evolved, we are leveraging architecture and infrastructure for financial services that's existed for many years before fintech became available, and basically repurposing it with better user interfaces or workarounds that are available online, that weren't available offline. And so it's interesting to face technological innovation that really is focused on constructing new rails that are repurposed for disintermediation and for removing traditional gatekeepers in DeFi. And so it seems to me like these two spaces are definitely going to converge, and it's just a question of how.
00:08:44.392 - 00:08:58.750, Speaker H: So I'm really interested to hear from the variety of perspectives we have on the call today. And just as quick background on myself, I write this week in fintech, which is a weekly digest and summary of financial technology news. Thanks for having me.
00:09:00.480 - 00:09:01.500, Speaker B: Simon.
00:09:02.000 - 00:09:34.276, Speaker I: Hey everybody. Simon, one of the co founders of eleven Fs. We're probably best known for our podcast Fintech Insider, Blockchain Insider, that kind of good stuff, and fintech brain food, which is my own little blog. We're a bit of a super group. So my co founder Jason was one of the founders of Stalling and Monzo. And we've sort of sucked people out of the London fintech ecosystem and built neo banks and challenger banks for both big banks and smaller ones around the world. But increasingly higher and higher double digit percentage of our revenues is coming from people in crypto that want to get access to the traditional financial rail.
00:09:34.276 - 00:10:05.648, Speaker I: So we find ourselves bridging those two worlds. And my own background. Yes, five years in eleven fs helping people build new fintech propositions. Everybody from grab to Natwest to standard Chartered. But before that I was head of blockchain R and D for Barclays. Did a lot of work with central banks and governments helping them understand policy and risk. And if you want to know more about that perspective of where these things cross over, I actually did an episode of the Defiant with Cami maybe about a year ago where I described fintech as being almost like a 1.5
00:10:05.648 - 00:10:24.710, Speaker I: bridging technology to the 20 world of new infrastructure. So there's a lot of natural crossover here. I think of it as almost like we're in Captain Planet and we're putting the rings together to make something super happen. So I'm excited to be here today amongst people that I am really big fans of. So thank you for having me.
00:10:25.720 - 00:10:27.860, Speaker B: Okay. And finally, Bruna.
00:10:28.220 - 00:11:28.492, Speaker A: Hey folks. Yeah, I think the best way to summarize where I've spent time in fintech and DFI is essentially following what Lex and Spencer have done over the last ten years. So it's been this interesting combination of paying attention around the trend that Lex kind of first was thinking deeply about back in 2012, 2013. How do you build new financial systems, new rails to really kind of address kind of non mass affluent? So this started as robo Advisor 1.0 and evolved over the last ten years into kind of what is this really interesting new opportunity when you think about first principles based enabling technology? So one of the things I'm most excited to talk about is path dependency. I think we all know the kind of trade thing around. If the Internet had know the ability to do micro payments on TCP IP, would we have a different kind of Internet business model today? So yeah, one of the things I think about on the fintech side is as we think about new enabling technologies, how do we ensure that when we're building some of these systems we understand what the knock on incentive mechanisms are going to be.
00:11:28.492 - 00:12:20.936, Speaker A: So as the system evolves and new folks get embedded in things like fintech and DFI, how do we make sure that it's a sustainable kind of long term project? That also optimizes your velocity, the things that kind of DFI gives you with the, I think, long term opportunity that fintech has been driving towards over the last ten years. Yeah, thanks to Lex for getting me into fintech in 2012. And thanks to Spencer for I think BT City back in 14 was the first time I heard about bitcoin. So kind of lighting that spark for me a few years back. So, yeah, it's been an awesome kind of few years watching these two trends converge. I currently spend time on new product partnerships in VD for plaid, so work super closely with Keith on kind of international Europe opportunities, and then spend most of my time thinking about the next evolution of how credit evolves in the United States. So verification of income, new credit rails really creating more access to a broader base of consumers.
00:12:20.936 - 00:12:36.130, Speaker A: And part of that is how do we think about DeFi as one of those core spaces where borrowers can go and get new systems of credit or validate themselves in ways that traditional finance can't? So, yeah, I think I've talked to everyone here one on one, but excited to get the group together.
00:12:37.140 - 00:13:53.610, Speaker B: Awesome. Okay, well, thanks, everyone. To start the conversation, I'll get straight to the meat of things. This integration between DeFi, crypto, and fintech. It seems like from your introductions that you all seem to agree that this is something that is bound to happen. I mean, first off, just to make sure we're all on the same page, do you all agree with this basic premise? Does anyone have any caveat to that? Everyone's in agreement? Okay, so with this basic premise said that we all expect DeFi and crypto to integrate with fintech, or vice versa. Let's get into more specifics of how you all think this will happen, with what tools, on what use cases, what will come first in this bridge that we all, I guess, agree need to be built? And anyone? Feel free to start.
00:13:54.380 - 00:14:33.556, Speaker D: I guess from my perspective, it's been interesting to observe that over a year ago, it was like crickets when I was at like, no one kind of thought DeFi was a thing. It was like, let's just think about decentralization. But finance was like an afterthought in many ways. But of course, then compound and maker and really just kind of paved the way for, I think the killer use cases for crypto native folks is lending and borrowing. But when it comes to more traditional users, I think what's piqued a lot of interest is like something like circle savings account, and it's abstract. The way the complexity defi is really complex. Still is, probably, even though the front ends are quite intuitive, but it requires multiple steps.
00:14:33.556 - 00:14:59.560, Speaker D: But you use something like argent or circle, that is offering, like, a high yield savings account. I think stablecoins are like the Trojan horse of this space, where it's very intuitive, right. You're not buying something that's very volatile. Could be like bitcoin or Ethereum. You're buying a crypto dollar, a digital receipt that sits in a bank account. It's regulated by entities. And so I think that's the onboarding funnel.
00:14:59.560 - 00:15:28.520, Speaker D: And it's very compelling in a record low interest rate environment where effectively, most users are paying banks to store their money. And then you have a neo, call it neo crypto challenger bank like circle that says, wait a minute, I can actually give you 8% or 4%, which is impressive. It's very compelling for the user when they see that. So that's been super interesting. I think that, to me, feels like the more immediate bridge between traditional fintech and Defi.
00:15:29.500 - 00:16:05.520, Speaker I: There's another layer to that as well, Santiago, where it's not just the Defi native projects or businesses. You've also got these fintech companies that are like wallets, like Echo.com, like Donut, where it looks and feels like a fintech proposition, and it's defi behind the scenes. But all of that complexity has been abstracted away into something that just looks and feels like a wallet that I use every day. So that's like one area. And then the second area is things that are already established as a neo bank adding Defi as a feature. So I know current announced that they're going to be partnering with compound finance to do the defi yield.
00:16:05.520 - 00:16:19.770, Speaker I: So there's those two things, and then there might even be another thing, which is what happens when PayPal adds, this. Is Defi a feature for fintech, or is fintech a feature for Defi? I think that's what I'm kind of wrestling with.
00:16:22.480 - 00:17:02.010, Speaker G: Yeah, I'll follow on there with. I think Simon hit on an important point, which is one of the theses I'm very bought into is we're now in a mobile first world for managing your financial life. I think that extends across both of these. And we've hit a place where the user experience for Defi has drastically shifted, where the difference in feel for the average user between the two is very little. And I think in that world, then it's pretty interesting to see how the adoption is going to grow. Folks like Dharma and some of these others people have mentioned, because I do think you're in a world where switching costs of moving between fintech and Defi is as small as downloading a new app and onboarding to that.
00:17:05.110 - 00:18:13.882, Speaker A: I think at the same time, one of the things, Camilla, to go back to the priors that we're all working off of is one the kind of onboarding friction that is required. I think we're all talking about it, right? Argent, Zapper, Xerion, the kind of wallets are getting as easy as it looks to onboard in a traditional kind of fintech neo bank. But in terms of visibility into, I think there's a Twitter thread going around this, maybe yesterday was understanding what the kind of product that a defi yield is actually giving to you versus like an FDIC backed account, like being more transparent and clear what that looks like and maybe even adopting new metrics, it's risk adjusted. Right? Here's what Defi yield actually means for consumers. And then to, I think, I think Fred Wilson even talked about this, right? Once you start seeing the opening of hundreds of millions to billion users being on a common platform, that's when you can really go and invest behind it, whether you're a product builder or an investor. And I think Defi still, if you look at, I think Spencer tweets about this a bunch, right? Like the actual users on something like a compound or Ave, like the TVLs look interesting. The metrics are going up, but in terms of that being comparable to something like Internet scale, it's still very early days.
00:18:13.882 - 00:18:59.180, Speaker A: So. Yeah. What are the friction points that get those next hundred million users online? And then once that happens, are there any scaling issues? Less from like a core blockchain perspective but more from will KYC reduce friction? We're seeing all this legislation, right? How do DeFi protocols and DeFi companies actually think about engaging with regulators in a way that's thoughtful but still doesn't slow down company building. So I think there's a little bit of a meme that DeFi can move faster because they're less regulated. But I think part of that is like, DeFi is just faster, right. The primitives are there. They don't have to deal with legacy software and systems, but bridging that gap, like how much of that innovation is actually going to be potentially slowed down by things like regulation or scaling impact is something I still grapple with a little bit.
00:18:59.790 - 00:19:27.762, Speaker E: Yeah. I mean, just to jump in and respond maybe. I think a lot about these subjects too. Specifically on scale. Ethereum can only do a certain number of transactions times every 14 seconds. So literally there's only so much computation that can be done. But I think what we've seen is that scaling is important in the computational sense, but it's way more important in the monetary sense.
00:19:27.762 - 00:20:29.826, Speaker E: Right. Having a scalable monetary base that DFI interacts with. And today, it's scary to just see the growth. It's over $500 billion across. Ethereum as a base layer asset stablecoins like we've talked about, as well as ERC 20 tokens that are on top. And I think it really this point that with the Internet, you are able to send info as packets, right? And the big unlock of crypto is that it allows us to. When I look at the PayPal's of the world and other fintech providers enabling deFi, if trusted, kind of like guardrails set, it's far less interesting than all of the opportunities that you can do if you actually allow your users to compose with other primitives and kind of leverage these amazing primitives.
00:20:29.826 - 00:20:46.794, Speaker E: So I don't know. I am very bullish on fintech, but I think that we're going to be surprised at how much fintech conforms to defi than probably the invert tough, because.
00:20:46.832 - 00:21:37.766, Speaker C: It'S like everybody says the things that I also think, and there's nothing to disagree with. So I'm going to try to kind of drive a little bit of a wedge, although it's not really a wedge. We go and we buy finance in the finance store. Isn't that really quaint? Like we go buy cars at the car broker, and we go get medicine at the doctor, and we get fruits at the fruit cart, and we get loans at the bank. And fintech is this. Fintech is just like a bank branch in your phone. And it is utterly powerless and embarrassing relative to the awesome scale of the artificial intelligence behemoths.
00:21:37.766 - 00:22:14.870, Speaker C: Right? Like, what power does Robinhood have relative to apple? None. It's a rounding error. It can be bought three, four times over. If Robinhood was no longer in the Apple store, does it make a difference to Apple? No, there's going to be another one. Right? And I say this with great affection for fintech stores of financial products. And so I think there's a really kind of clear outcome of Defi based manufactured financial products also being distributed in these digital storefronts. That totally makes sense.
00:22:14.870 - 00:22:40.670, Speaker C: It's great for revenue generation. It's probably like a novel asset class, the Federal Reserve, blah, blah, blah. But at the same time, we're not on the crypto side building a store for finance product. We're building something that is going to be 50 times larger than Apple because it is the Internet. But for all human economic activity.
00:22:45.350 - 00:22:45.666, Speaker F: In.
00:22:45.688 - 00:23:44.630, Speaker C: That case, the curation of crypto products and crypto functionalities into mere packages of random number generation and sort of like interest rate performance feel really narrow. They feel incredibly limiting. Like, I don't want 5% interest rates. I want a video game avatar that I wear in every single social network, which is worth $50 million and print bucket loads of 50 different currencies and makes me special and makes me feel cool with 16 year olds. That's what I want, because I'm trapped in the metaverse in a COVID pandemic zombie apocalypse. And I have to paint this picture because that's the distinction, right? It is not the finance store, although it is because finance is a feature. Rather, it is the human economy.
00:23:44.630 - 00:23:50.120, Speaker C: For the centaurs and the AIs that are going to come after us.
00:23:53.530 - 00:23:53.798, Speaker E: You.
00:23:53.804 - 00:24:55.578, Speaker H: Would spend less time catering to being cool to 32 year olds. I think you're cool for what it's worth. And to build on that point a little bit, it does feel like a lot of the conversation around where decentralized finance and where financial technology can go is based on, as Spencer was saying, old primitives and use cases that financial services 1.0 already unlocked. And so for all the talk about higher APYs and faster transactions and lower cross border currency costs, these are problems that we're marginally solving on a continual basis. And the increments are very gradual, and there's no real de novo innovation there. But then when you talk about a product type like a flash loan, there are reasons that that could not exist within fintech on traditional financial services.
00:24:55.578 - 00:25:09.342, Speaker H: Rails and I think these kind of exotic products that are impossible, the way that financial services is built right now are going to really define where DeFi goes.
00:25:09.396 - 00:25:12.274, Speaker E: And the question in my mind whether.
00:25:12.312 - 00:26:33.914, Speaker H: Fintech companies even still exist when we crack those use cases, or like Lex said, whether having a finance store becomes kind of a quaint anachronism. And so you hear a lot of people on fintech talking about embedded financial services, and I see a couple of people nodding their heads. And right now, this is kind of confined to still current financial technology. Rails and the idea is if you have a platform, for instance, like Airbnb, let hosts take out cash to invest in a new location so that they can offer it on Airbnb, or let guests pay later for a booking and manage all that through Airbnb as a platform through an embedded financial services provider. And embedded fintech in one way or another looks a lot like that, embedding the consumer offering within a platform. But if you're able to build on rails that have permissionless KYC built in, where you have a persistent state of identity that's always online, that's able to take in data from non financial services providers, you move from the fintech store to, effectively a wallet. But it's even abstracted away from the notion of a wallet that follows you around everywhere you go.
00:26:33.914 - 00:26:44.800, Speaker H: Because we have so much data exhaust in our day to day lives that we can have using, like Lex said, artificial intelligence, very intelligent embedded financial services.
00:26:45.170 - 00:26:49.082, Speaker E: That follow us around, predict our interests.
00:26:49.146 - 00:27:54.882, Speaker H: And meet our needs at the spot that we have them, rather than waiting for us to come into the financial services store. So kind of like one last idea to end on and kind of tie these, I guess, disparate points together is reading a book recently about somebody who came up in poverty and then started making money for the first time. Something that they said stuck with me. And they said, for the first time, I understand the true power of money, which is when you have money, you no longer need to spend all your time thinking about money. You can think about other things. And to me, that's always kind of been a goal with financial services. Then a goal with fintech, and now a goal with DeFi is how do you make your money work for you so intelligently that you don't need to actually go and submit all these requests? You don't have different product types like equities, investments, debt, investments, savings, checking, but your money is kind of fluid and communicates across the full fintech stack so that you're able to do what you want in life without having to think about how money is going to enable you to do that.
00:27:54.882 - 00:28:03.430, Speaker H: To me, that seems like a much bigger promise of Defi, kind of based on all these exotic features that aren't available in fintech, it seems like this.
00:28:03.500 - 00:29:06.940, Speaker B: Group is converging towards the idea. That kind of goes back to what Simon mentioned this question of is DeFi first, or is fintech first? Like, does Defi integrate with fintech, or is it the other way around? And it seems like a lot of what you guys are saying is you think that DeFi will come first. This more open global financial system will start to just be bigger than any individual fintech company. And then maybe these fintech companies will have to adjust to this new world order. So maybe the future of finance doesn't look like this. Fintech in the front, party, Defi in the back. The party is in the front, which I think it's a novel idea.
00:29:06.940 - 00:29:57.546, Speaker B: I think in general, kind of, if I'm reading newsletters and Twitter threads, I think the general idea is that Fintech will adopt DeFi on the back end. But I think it's interesting to turn things around, and maybe Fintech will have to catch up with just this new way of transacting. If that's the case, and if anyone disagrees with this, I'd love to kind of hear the counterargument to this playing out. But if this is the case where it's like party in the front, what are the next steps for this to happen? It seems like we're such a long way from that. What are some of the steps to take to get there?
00:29:57.648 - 00:30:35.138, Speaker I: I think just before we get into that, Cami, though, we have to say the R word. We have to say regulation, right? And we have to stand back and look at regulation from first principles, because you can see this happening with the infrastructure bill and everything. Right now, I think there are two macro trends. One is a generational shift of people crossing the chasm into where they're at in their understanding of crypto and defi. On one end of the spectrum, you've got boomers like Janet Yellen sort of hating it. And at the other end of the spectrum, you've got, as Lex says, people trapped in the metaverse that just this is the default. It's the no brainer.
00:30:35.138 - 00:31:15.450, Speaker I: But typically, policymakers and regulators skew older, and they still have a lot of influence. And regulated financial services has a high install base and high network effects. And it can be very hard to chisel away at it without being adversarial. So to me, the question is, are we adversarial to regulation, or do we make it? That's like the low watermark, and Defi can do better. And I think that's where the conversation gets really interesting. So as I stand back and look at what do you do to improve on regulation? You have to understand why it existed in the first place. And there was a great quote, and I don't know who to attribute it to, which is regulation is public opinion on a five year gap.
00:31:15.450 - 00:32:06.822, Speaker I: I don't know if all regulation that exists now is, but if you think about the SEC is created after the stock market crash, and something must be done. Even with the troubles Robinhood had and the challenges they got into, there was a lot of press around the consumer getting into stocks and shares. So there is a section of society that doesn't want to be their own bank. There is a section of society that would like some rules of the road and some controls. In fact, I would put it to you that that is the overwhelming majority of society in many cases, not all cases, but in many cases. And so where cryptos come from is this much more anarchistic view of the world than is compatible with most of humanity, in my hypothesis. So we need to create things for people who don't live in private keys and don't live in that level of complexity and detail, which I think many folks have pointed out.
00:32:06.822 - 00:32:28.250, Speaker I: And so what becomes that high watermark? Because if we're going to cross the chasm from fintech in front or defi in the back to the other way around, then we're really going to have to solve for that r word in some way, shape or form. And then the third thing I'd leave you with is this idea that part of the problem spaces are different.
00:32:28.320 - 00:32:28.554, Speaker D: Right?
00:32:28.592 - 00:32:50.740, Speaker I: So what fintech is very good at solving is what's my user's challenge, and how do I create the best experience? And what Defi has historically been very good at solving is how do I create the best primitives that are the most composable and have the most community support? And could these things be compatible? Could I do that better with the primitives? I think that's an interesting space to kind of.
00:32:54.230 - 00:33:52.322, Speaker A: For me, I think, as Lexi mentioned earlier. Right, human activity shifting to this digital first model, one thing I think about is what are the friction points and the kind of onboarding when you're doing human activity? Call it from when you're sentient, from when you're five to when you're an adult and can make independent human financial choices. One thing I kind of struggle with is traditional financial services and fintech are serving an opt out model. Right. Most of the activity you do in your financial life either got set up for you by a third party, or it's the easiest kind of system to participate in. So you have a 429 plan when you're born, then you go to college, you get your first credit debit card, then you get your first brokerage account, first savings checking account, and then over time, it's all these systems that are either put in front of you, or if you're employed with a traditional company, you're going to be a 401K, you're going to be an IRA, and that's the majority of where assets sits today. Crypto, as a percentage of the total assets out there is still a tiny fraction.
00:33:52.322 - 00:34:24.180, Speaker A: So I just think about what are those humans activities that are increasing as a percentage of what we do and not sort of circumscribing DeFi activity to just financial activity. It can be things like NFTs being part of kind of metaverse financial transactions, but those are all opt in. It feels like human activities you have to go and seek out. I want to be my own bank. I want to do all my activities on DeFi protocols versus the friction. To do that is so much higher right now that opt into the traditional system is just easier and in fact, oftentimes imposed. Right.
00:34:24.870 - 00:34:30.306, Speaker D: I'm encouraged by. I would agree with. I think it was Simon who said this.
00:34:30.408 - 00:34:30.722, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:30.776 - 00:35:20.114, Speaker D: DeFi has been building core infrastructure and the best primitives that potentially can scale and be super interoperable, whereas fintech is just a patchwork of stuff that's trying to piece together stuff that just is very convoluted and won't talk to each other very easily. Whereas DeFi rearchitects stuff from the ground up, which takes time. But I'm encouraged most recently by NFTs and what's happening in the, like, think of like flow and board apes and mean, it's pretty impressive. I was talking to the team at board apes and it's new users coming in. Right. And so I think Asia has always, in my mind, been a window into how consumers think about finance in a digital first world, especially younger generations. People use wechat and they have no semblance of what a brick and mortar bank is.
00:35:20.114 - 00:36:58.658, Speaker D: I think COVID in some ways accelerated that transition in the US where people said, hey, wait a minute, I actually can't go to my retail bank. But I think younger generations, the onboarding flow in finance has been, hey, your parents bank at bank of America, they're going to open you an account when you go to college and you're set for life. Moving money is not something that most people want to do, and so you're very loyal, not because they provide good services, but because it's just like a mental overhead that you don't want to go through and pain. But I think that's going away in a world where finance, and someone said it is sort of like abstracted, it's sort of an afterthought where you're playing a game like Axie, or you're trading NFTs because that's what you do when you're young, or that's more fun than just thinking about money. And I think that's the onboarding funnel that I'm most excited about, where once you have a punk or you have a board ape or you start playing with Axie, then it's like, what else can I do with this? Hey, I can earn some yield on my native token or convert it to a stable coin. And I think at that point it becomes what WeChat did in WeChat started as a social application and then built a whole suite of services around that user base. And I think in many ways I think that's how the metaverse will probably do it for DeFi where you're going to see all these services be layered in natively in these games and these metaverses and people, not, again, totally abstract away the complexity and challenges of fintech and just dealing with your relationship with money.
00:36:58.824 - 00:38:04.582, Speaker E: Yeah, and maybe to just pull on that thread a little bit more, going back to this framing of who wants, obviously no one, including me, who's like, but I think if you pose it as do you want game and earn money for doing so, it's like 10% yield on your savings. Like hell percent that my bank is giving me. Or better yet, do I want to own the literal bank that I am using, right. The thing about DFI that I think is so important is that it aligns incentives between users and operators, right? Are built, owned and operated by the users of the platform. And when you have that really strong incentive, you don't have things where a fintech company is taking some arbitrary, ridiculous fee for services that should be free. Right. And we all know kind of what rent seeking is, I think in crypto because it's just harder to do that.
00:38:04.582 - 00:38:23.414, Speaker E: And so I think it comes down to the user journey here. Everything in crypto is at this user Persona level. And I think we're going to see as the infrastructure just gets better, the UX gets better, that more people want to take these journeys one way door.
00:38:23.462 - 00:38:26.346, Speaker F: And a lot of on chain doesn't.
00:38:26.378 - 00:38:28.782, Speaker E: Really ever go back to the traditional history.
00:38:28.836 - 00:38:46.718, Speaker F: There just really is no reason once you've gotten acclimated to the infrastructure and the tooling. And so I think that's one of the reasons why I think that just in the way that people didn't think crypto would be anything, it will eventually just be everything. We're having a conversation with fintechs right now, but I think in two or.
00:38:46.744 - 00:38:48.630, Speaker E: Three or four years, the more representative.
00:38:49.130 - 00:38:51.510, Speaker F: Who really matter are gaming and content.
00:38:51.580 - 00:38:52.694, Speaker E: And a little bit of.
00:38:52.812 - 00:38:59.962, Speaker F: But really it will become the underpinning and the fascia of most modern day consumer applications. And I think in a world where.
00:39:00.016 - 00:39:03.546, Speaker E: That really struggle, fintechs to me, are.
00:39:03.568 - 00:39:15.118, Speaker F: Basically a wrapper on the set of intermediaries. Take plaid, for example. It's wrapped ach wires, which is really old technology. It's just a base for intermediaries to.
00:39:15.124 - 00:39:16.560, Speaker E: Operate in the financial system.
00:39:16.930 - 00:39:19.994, Speaker F: When you go from transacting from plaid.
00:39:20.042 - 00:39:22.898, Speaker E: Which however many intermediaries to conduct a.
00:39:22.904 - 00:39:31.666, Speaker F: Financial transaction to, you're just accessing a financial service on a blockchain via an API stand. What fintechs do, and I think they.
00:39:31.688 - 00:39:34.478, Speaker E: Have a regulatory speaking with, and that's.
00:39:34.574 - 00:40:01.550, Speaker F: Relatively interesting, but the coinbase of the future looks like Zapper. They don't have an order book. They don't really touch any of their customers'funds. They're kind of a referral platform and a wallet and a way to kind of think about your finances. I don't think that places like revolute or Plaid or Google Play or really any of the fintechs have these same positions of people actually living through their services. And I think that's primarily the reason why I think they'll struggle in a world where DFI and crypto is very popular.
00:40:02.370 - 00:40:09.470, Speaker B: Guys, I want to give you a chance to respond to what's the place for plaid in a web3 feature?
00:40:10.850 - 00:40:57.358, Speaker G: That's an interesting question and appreciate the hard point just to view there from Vance and others. I want to go back to what Simon said, though, because I think it's really important. And this is a factor that fintech is going to have a big impact in, which is we're talking about a world. And what makes DeFi so exciting, right. Is the Internet is global and borderless, but the reality is that financial services and the way people manage and run their lives are defined by borders and the laws within those borders. And we're going to have to figure out a way to bridge that gap, regardless of whether you're fintech or DeFi. And that's a lot of the world that plaid helps with right now, is we help abstract away the regulatory complexity and help companies be compliant regardless of the jurisdiction they're in.
00:40:57.358 - 00:41:32.940, Speaker G: And I think crypto and Defi have some growing up to do in that sense. And you're starting to see challenges with some of the things facing companies like finance today. Of you have to decide, are you going down to the lowest common denominator? Are you going completely sort of off the reservation and saying, we're not following regulation, or how are you going to figure out how to solve this in a world where every different country might approach crypto and defi in a very different way. And I think it's going to take a long time before you have the consumer and user demand to make that uniform globally. And bridging that gap is somewhere where I think Fintech and Defi will have to work together to make that happen.
00:41:38.030 - 00:42:43.806, Speaker C: And I'm happy to not talk, but I want to kind of do two examples on top of this point around regulation that I think are maybe an interesting framing. And it's this distinction between a financial feature that is distributed through a large, established digital footprint. Advanced to your point, the point of fintech is to distribute, it's to sell, and it doesn't really care what it sells, whether it's a bank account or a brokerage account or a loan. And embedded finance kind of shortcuts that. And I think that there's going to be ten to 20 years of that potentially melting away. But the broader bet is super exciting, I think. Imagine we got some books in 1998, and if you live in this country, you can read these books.
00:42:43.806 - 00:44:16.400, Speaker C: And if you live in this country, you can't read these books, you have to read these other books. And if your citizens read the books in another country, you're going to go and sue and find and potentially jail the publishers of those books in that other countries because your citizens dared to look at that book, right? And that is what the SEC does today. And now imagine the Internet, where you don't have books, you just have blog posts and Twitter, right? And so it's entirely orthogonal to this sort of command and control. You can't have this type of regulation in a world that is completely kind of like horizontal. And I think just for me, the torch is also that crypto based systems protect human dignity in the way that our current systems do not. So if you walk into Amazon, if you were to instantiate them as a physical store, or if you walk into Shopify or Facebook, imagine you go into a Starbucks and they, like you come up to pay, and they say, we've got a drawer in the back with photocopies of your passport and your username and password, and we've got your credit card photocopied in there as well. Actually, we have all your addresses and all your proofs of addresses conveniently stored in the slocker, along with photocopies of that for millions of people.
00:44:16.400 - 00:45:05.920, Speaker C: Give me your fingerprint and I'll go grab your photocopy of your personal files. That's like an insane, horrible dystopia that we live in, right where there is no privacy, there is no sovereignty, there is no data protection, and you're constantly being intruded on. And so crypto flips this in a way where you walk into any store and your wallet's in your wallet, it's in your pocket, nobody gets to take it from you and take it out and photocopy it and keep it forever. And so I think, for me, that's massively inspirational. And I think that it's going to end up being an issue of human rights and human dignity, especially in the type of dystopian environment that the attention economy has created for us.
00:45:07.490 - 00:46:49.770, Speaker B: Super interesting stuff. I think the tension that we're seeing here is this kind of idealistic vision of this web3 open global metaverse future where individuals own their assets and own their information, but also the reality, which is right now, regulations aren't built for this future. And there's just the practical matters of platforms that don't scale to where billions of people can actually interact in these open platforms, just like the user experience isn't there yet. So we have this tension between the ideal world that we would like, but the realities that we have to struggle with and overcome before we get there. And we are coming to the end of the hour, and I definitely want to get to at least one community sourced question, and I think I'll go with the one that, because we've touched on many that came up, but one that's interesting is this security versus speed debate, and should not be a debate anymore. What collectively can be done to harden crosschain protocols built on solidity? Can consensus security standard be created by the industry? We have a long way to go. So I think that the question of just user safety is something that we haven't touched very much in the discussion.
00:46:49.770 - 00:46:55.860, Speaker B: Maybe it's worth doing this one community question before we wrap up.
00:46:56.310 - 00:47:28.966, Speaker F: This is really hard to do because you can get from underwriting the risk of one stablecoin or one amm to very quickly underwriting the entire risk of Defi and all cross chain protocols just in an instant in a transaction. And so I think there's a few ways to think about this. There does need to be some international standards of auditing firms. I think that's first and foremost the biggest one. Frankly, all of these hacks, I just assume that they're the auditors. When you look at these protocols, it's not obvious how you would attack them. You have to have some sort of nuanced knowledge.
00:47:28.966 - 00:48:15.290, Speaker F: And so that profession needs to actually have, I think, the most oversight. So I think that's the first one that actually look at the liquidity of the underlying assets and all around them. That's the other piece of the equation. Large part, if something bad happens, there is no customer support number that you can call. And I think right now we've sell in the future that won't be the case. And that is maybe where front ends really play a role in just kind of like capacity, deciding which is safe and which is not for their consumers. And that's not quite the full throated version of deep.
00:48:15.290 - 00:48:19.310, Speaker F: I think it's okay in terms of baby steps to onboard.
00:48:23.650 - 00:49:39.880, Speaker H: Yeah, I saw this question come up on Twitter and I think this is a key question for the scaling of the DeFi ecosystem. Until you have a standard where rug pulls and exploits are not happening on a weekly or daily basis, you're not going to get doctors and retired dentists putting their life savings onto DeFi protocols. I agree with Vance. I think a much higher auditing standard is necessary, and this is kind of a solved problem. And I put big quotes around that. In some areas of financial services where you have international consortia like FinCEn that are focused on distributed group information sharing and auditing, it feels to me like this is possibly a model that could set the path for DeFi, where you have much more stringent audits and that stamps of approval from a variety of different paid auditors and also nonprofits and communities, each of whom can give their own validation for new products in the market before you can have people actually be comfortable with signing up to them. Outside of the, I'd say the more speculative class of investors that you have on DeFi today, including the people here.
00:49:42.170 - 00:50:23.486, Speaker I: Ask of the group and the industry, would be like, how do we build a high watermark of what's possible? Because the entrepreneurs and the builders build for the happy path. But actually to hit mainstream, we need to think about the unhappy path. And is it around audits? And how do we take the best of crypto native, but not throw the baby out with the bathwater? When it comes to what has worked in the traditional financial system, and getting people together to communicate and collaborate and share information across these borders, build a high watermark, I think is a good idea that we can build on. But doing that with crypto native tools makes way more sense than we're going to do audits with paper and auditors. That just makes no sense when the whole thing's sitting there on a blockchain.
00:50:23.518 - 00:50:23.666, Speaker A: Right.
00:50:23.688 - 00:51:16.174, Speaker I: It makes no sense. But how do we create those high watermarks I think is something to really think about for normies. How are they going to come into it? They're going to want that trust, Mark. And what's the equivalent to the Twitter blue check that? Is that brand? What's the FDIC insured? What's the visa? Is it a traditional thing or is it something that you could actually create that gives people that confidence? Because humans are weird and humans buy into logos and they'll really value that. But then that might not be the revolution everybody wanted, but it could be something really good. As a final piece though, on the security side, I think that a lot of people looked at the original Internet, the original cyberpunks, and thought, we're going to build this open, free, permissionless communication world. And what you got was platforms that kind of did rent seeking with Defi.
00:51:16.174 - 00:51:30.970, Speaker I: Right now there's a hint of that kind of optimism. And I just worry that unless we bake these things into the infrastructure now and think about try and see around some of the corners, we might just end up in a similar dystopia with new technology and new ideas.
00:51:32.270 - 00:52:04.342, Speaker E: I think those are some really good points. I don't think we're ever going to get to a point where there are never hacks happening on a daily basis. If anything, it's only going to accelerate. Long tail of protocols that are launching every single day. But I'm definitely sick because the incentives exist for. Right. The incentives exist for for profit businesses, protocols to build things that don't break.
00:52:04.342 - 00:52:50.466, Speaker E: And also from the government and kind of regulatory side, there's a pretty big incentive for governments to regulate, understand and tax this new technology. And so from both sides of the kind of aisle here, I think it's going to be quite strong. And maybe the last thing to just talk about is getting paradigm of smart contract risk. And there are so many edge cases, it's just evolving on a day to day basis. But the one thing that you can't, I guess, fabricate is literally the history of these protocols. We can look and see that AAvE has billions of dollars in it and it has not been hacked and it's been around for this many years. Right.
00:52:50.466 - 00:52:59.670, Speaker E: And there's lindy effect to that and trust that I think will just grow. And so I think history and time is one of the more underrated.
00:53:02.890 - 00:54:22.286, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess the pile on like this is a comment Santiago made earlier. Right? Like the difference between Internet and technology usage in western countries versus places like China, just outside of the western hemisphere. The concept of there will be a balkanized sort of version of DeFi that emerges based on if we get these regulatory sandboxes, like different levels of risk that consumers are willing to take, or businesses depending on what are your incentives and what's your regulatory kind of regime that you're forcing to operate with? I think a lot of this was thoughtfully answered in the last couple of weeks with the crypto community around the infrastructure bill and actually running towards regulation, but at least well defined, nuanced regulation with the whole idea that innovation will go to the places where it can flourish most. So, yeah, I do wonder if there's a high watermark for if you don't get, you know, savings, right, if that does opt in a smaller number of users that would otherwise participate in DeFi, if there was just more transparency, if you understood the risk adjusted decisions you're making by leveraging like a blockfly account versus a JPM account. And I guess the last thing I would end on is there's a meme that you put your money in US bank and it's backed by FDFC and it's safe. Like that idea of us banks being safe forever, I think will decrease over time. Right.
00:54:22.286 - 00:54:31.602, Speaker A: But what's the next kind of version of where you can kind of sleep safe at night and you're just really putting your money in place that you don't necessarily want to take additional risk? Right.
00:54:31.736 - 00:54:32.034, Speaker H: Yeah.
00:54:32.072 - 00:54:38.690, Speaker A: Just think about. There's probably different versions of how this emerges, and a lot of it's dependent on kind of your risk. Uptight.
00:54:40.170 - 00:55:26.734, Speaker D: I think in many ways, I'm encouraged that we're having some sort of meaningful dialogue with regulators because, look, we've been wanting clarity for so many years. Finally, I think we're talking about it, which is, I guess, encouraging. And it's a sign of this industry just growing and becoming meaningful for regulators and the government to tax it and what have you. It's a big economy, right? Crypto is a trillion dollar industry now, so it's not chump change. My message to regulators is very simplistically, you got to meet innovation with innovative regulation. Trying to fit old regulatory frameworks to new innovation never bodes well. You saw it in the Internet, kind of regulate stuff like YouTube and IP and royalties.
00:55:26.734 - 00:55:48.202, Speaker D: It was just like you couldn't have contained the music industry. Artists obviously had to adjust their business models and their ways of engaging with audiences. But look, at the end of the day, they got much more distribution through Spotify. And I think the last point I'll make is, for instance, what are you actually regulating? Like, what is consumer protection in a DeFi world?
00:55:48.256 - 00:55:48.474, Speaker A: Okay.
00:55:48.512 - 00:56:17.430, Speaker D: It's hacks for sure, that is problematic. There's no standard. There's this sort of ever increasing surface area because you're pushing the boundaries of innovation that has collateral damage, like we saw yesterday. Right? It's not fun to have a $660,000,000 hack. Not everyone's ready to be their bank and custody their own keys. But at the same time, this idea of consumer protection is very interesting because some of these things are noncustodial. And look, when money in a bank, you have no insight and transparency into what they're doing.
00:56:17.430 - 00:57:09.330, Speaker D: And lo and behold, you see 2008 or Cyprus or some of these places where you just don't know, you don't have transparency. Whereas I think Spencer was the one that said it. These are smart contracts that execute a very predictable, transparent logic that can be audited and monitored. 24 7365, you see what's going on, and it's rule based logic, of course, that can have its whole set of issues, but that, to me, is most encouraging. You need to regulate a bank because you don't want them to, I guess, buy junk bonds with your money and have the government have to bail them out in 2008. But regulating Ave is, it's not like the team at Ave can determine. They set certain risk parameters, for sure, through governance and stuff like that, but they can't touch your assets.
00:57:09.330 - 00:57:27.340, Speaker D: It's a smart contract that executes that logic. So I think that's a key primitive here. That's the message that I want to kind of leave and always press on, which is it's very different financial ecosystem and system. And we ought to just think about from first principles how we regulate this.
00:57:28.910 - 00:57:46.020, Speaker I: There's like a section 230 for DFI. What would that look like? What's our section 230 bit of legislation that really enables it? There's definitely a first do no harm piece, but what else is in there? And I imagine getting to that clarity could be really helpful for him.
00:57:47.430 - 00:57:49.314, Speaker F: I think one of the problems is.
00:57:49.352 - 00:57:52.146, Speaker E: That agencies, none of these regulators are.
00:57:52.168 - 00:57:59.910, Speaker F: In the general investor protection business. The SEC doesn't really care if you are in a smart contract that gets hacked. They care if you're trading securities.
00:58:00.410 - 00:58:02.200, Speaker E: Fincen much?
00:58:04.010 - 00:58:06.120, Speaker F: I think the good news is that.
00:58:07.050 - 00:58:10.520, Speaker E: Most popular bipartisan issue of an entire.
00:58:11.150 - 00:58:15.914, Speaker F: You look at the engagement on any of these politicians tweets. They get 23 tweets when they go.
00:58:15.952 - 00:58:22.906, Speaker E: To a kid's kitchen, they get 15,000 likes if they tweet about bitcoin.
00:58:23.098 - 00:58:25.246, Speaker F: So I'm just kind of of the.
00:58:25.268 - 00:58:28.046, Speaker E: Opinion that over probably five or ten.
00:58:28.068 - 00:58:32.926, Speaker F: Years, we will have the most optimistic regulation that you could possibly ask for in crypto.
00:58:33.038 - 00:58:35.438, Speaker E: That'll be a function of people, that'll.
00:58:35.454 - 00:58:59.738, Speaker F: Be a function of the midterms and the redistricting that just happened flow from these industries into politics. And so I'm not actually that concerned about regulations in the near. We would have had more users that we could have fought this tooth and nail better. But just seeing the industry galvanize around set of events that are seemingly scary, but a small give in the longer.
00:58:59.904 - 00:59:03.658, Speaker E: Frame of what does a legislative process.
00:59:03.744 - 00:59:11.630, Speaker F: Look like for crypto? I think that's going to be the big battle, and that'll probably happen in the next year or two, and I expect that to be hugely positive.
00:59:15.010 - 00:59:54.970, Speaker B: Awesome. Okay, and then to wrap up, I think one final quick fire question to go around, just, like, something more forward looking. And I'd love to have everyone's thoughts on, just, like, what's the most exciting development to you in either Defi or fintech right now? What's the latest dap that you went on that blew your mind, or what are you seeing in fintech? That's really. Yeah, let's keep these relatively short. Simon.
00:59:56.750 - 01:00:31.906, Speaker I: My mind at the moment, I feel like such a, like even just trying to get and play axie and deal with the fact that there's somehow people making four times the minimum wage in the Philippines playing to earn, and we've got a new business model that just is mind blowing to me. And the convergence of the macro trends of all things metaverse and meta economy. And every day there's another thing that comes up around it. So how does that all come together every ten minutes on Twitter?
01:00:31.938 - 01:00:33.190, Speaker E: My mind gets blown.
01:00:34.010 - 01:00:35.762, Speaker B: Fair enough. Same here.
01:00:35.916 - 01:00:37.130, Speaker E: Santiago.
01:00:39.230 - 01:01:17.818, Speaker D: I think I'm very encouraged by the launch of L2s on Ethereum. For a long time, it's been a huge bottleneck. It's detracted a lot of consumers and applications that may have not worked because it's very competently expensive. But now you're graduating from dial up to broadband, and it's explosive. It comes at a right time where there's a lot of users, there's play to earn, there's a lot of trends and interests. And I think a lot of these applications can credibly now scale to some extent. And super encouraged by that, you have things like arbitrum that is launching at the end of the month and then a few other l two solutions out there in the market like optimism and Starkware.
01:01:17.818 - 01:01:20.360, Speaker D: That is very encouraging. So I'm excited about that.
01:01:21.850 - 01:01:22.870, Speaker B: Bruno.
01:01:25.050 - 01:02:17.126, Speaker A: Yeah, I think in terms of bringing more d five users into captive kind of fintech platform. So I think the next mean people are already talking about it, right. The large kind of fintech incumbents, whether it's know, Robinhood really either being super active on M A to bring things like crypto in house and then exposing DeFi to consumers within native kind of fintech applications. So yeah, I think this next step function of how do we actually pull through DeFi users into that fintech front end while also exposing folks that are already on these fintech platforms to easily onboard onto things like Ethereum and all the kind of lending borrowing protocols. So yeah, I think in the next six to twelve months we'll see a ton of super interesting M and a activity all kind of net positive against introduce more folks to onboarding flows that I think would ordinarily take a ton more friction for them to access directly. So looking out for some of that.
01:02:17.148 - 01:02:20.710, Speaker B: M and a interesting Benz.
01:02:23.310 - 01:02:25.386, Speaker F: This isn't new, but the story of.
01:02:25.408 - 01:02:28.998, Speaker E: Stablecoins internationally is really go to Hong.
01:02:29.014 - 01:02:54.310, Speaker F: Kong, to the foreign exchange counter in Kowloon, they don't quote you US dollars, they quote you USDT. And so the ability for them to supplant in Asia, especially in Southeast Asia, the payment ecosystem is just terrible. And seeing the dollarization of these things in real time is super encouraging. And so yeah, really impressed by tether in Asia and USDC in western Europe and North America.
01:02:54.730 - 01:02:59.750, Speaker B: Oh so interesting. Had no idea that was happening. Cool. Lex.
01:03:02.250 - 01:04:12.350, Speaker C: I'm biased but I'm pretty excited about of we've been on this ride at consensus watching metamask grow along with the ecosystem and seeing it start in sort of like crypto wallet land and then financial functionality land and then plug in polygon and power a bunch of polygon transactions. And then one day we discovered millions of people per month using binance smart chain with metamask. And that was a neat surprise. And now one of the biggest use cases is not axie but like a crypto blades game. And so to actually see that in the operating of the project is pretty cool. So it signals the sort of like people getting actually educated about crypto native tools rather than relying on saying this is too hard, I can't use, it's not safe. And so for me that's really encouraging.
01:04:14.690 - 01:05:17.986, Speaker E: Spencer yeah, for me I would say, looking back, right, legacy banking, fintech, even DeFi for the better part of its life has been about single player mode, a user interacting with this technology. But with Defi now we're multiplayer mode. And it's like ridiculously exciting. It starts with DAos and these groups of kind of ethereum addresses that are coming together to collectively buy something, whether it's an NFT or a token or something else, and they're forming communities and enterprise around that. And the implications of this, right, just spinning something up are just so big. Investing is becoming a team sport, right? And it's disrupting things like VC and legacy finance and really how we look at investing in kind of the broader culture. And so, yeah, I'm just seeing so much innovation there.
01:05:17.986 - 01:05:30.280, Speaker E: The infrastructure build out is ridiculous, like over the step function increase and really encourage everyone to just dig into the Dow space more and more.
01:05:31.530 - 01:05:32.310, Speaker B: Keith?
01:05:34.170 - 01:06:18.002, Speaker G: Yeah. I'll highlight two things. One is I just recently got my first debit card where I can spend stable coins out in the real world. And that bridge for me has been really exciting because I feel like that's something that had been missing from my personal world. I know that's not necessarily new as in this week, but I think for me that was something that has me really excited because I think to Vance's point, it really brings the value of stablecoins into the real world. And then the second thing is, I'm really excited about the reaction and debate that happened around the infrastructure bill because I think it demonstrates what a force DeFi and crypto are going to be in governance and policymaking going forward. And it's going to bring a lot of smart people into that world, not just on the technology side, but on that policy side.
01:06:18.002 - 01:06:26.280, Speaker G: And I think that's the next wave of maturity that we need all over the world as well. So I think that's a really exciting and encouraging development for me.
01:06:27.870 - 01:06:29.450, Speaker B: And finally, Nick.
01:06:32.990 - 01:08:06.120, Speaker H: What if I say Coinbase? Do I get kicked off the group call taking a different tech here? I think some of the devtools being built for the defi ecosystem are pretty interesting and are going to enable a lot of protocol and asset class expansion to new, different types of underlying real world blocks. The one that I'm thinking about more specifically is ceramic by three box labs, which is building back end data and identity infrastructure that will allow a lot of these services, like a metamask or like an NFT provider, to basically scale what they're doing really seamlessly as they grow. And so as an NFT holder myself. Right now, we seem to be in this fun kind of toy experimentation phase where we're talking about collectibles and it looks like a game, but when you see somebody list their property or their house for sale on OpenSea, because these service providers have the right back end tools to be able to scale what they're offering to customers, then the value proposition is just going to look really different from buying a punk or board ape. So I'm kind of excited to see with these back end innovations what can happen as Defi slowly eats the world.
01:08:07.150 - 01:08:55.800, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, what an amazing roundtable and panel discussion. Such a privilege to have you all in the same spot talking about this. Just like interesting topic of how fintech and DeFi will interact in the future. I think what's come out of this conversation is that first it's clear that DFI and web3 will continue growing. There's no kind of shutting it down at this point. It's almost like an inevitability that it'll kind of continue developing and become the future of not just finance, but just any web based application.
01:08:55.800 - 01:10:20.206, Speaker B: And there are different views on how this will play out. But I think an easy answer is kind of all of the above because I think there's just not one future of finance because there's not just one individual user that will use it. So I think this will be, maybe it develops into kind of the spectrum of most decentralized to more centralized with these fintech front ends curating all these different applications, and a user that's maybe more comfortable in the fully decentralized way of interacting with these protocols. And maybe as time moves on, users will start to migrate, maybe from those fintech front ends into just graduating to the more and more decentralized part of the spectrum as just a user base is younger and gets more comfortable with all these tools. And maybe in that transition, regulators catch up too, and we get to our open and global and trustless utopia. I don't know when, ten years from now, who knows? In our lifetimes, I think, because the space just moves so quickly. So, yeah, thanks everyone.
01:10:20.206 - 01:10:34.040, Speaker B: Thanks, Runo, for organizing and maybe and do this again because I think I got in like three of the 20 questions I had planned for this. So definitely a lot more to talk about. Thanks, everyone.
01:10:34.410 - 01:10:38.022, Speaker A: Super good to see everyone. Thank you, John.
01:10:38.156 - 01:10:39.990, Speaker H: Thanks for being such a great host.
01:10:40.570 - 01:10:41.560, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone.
