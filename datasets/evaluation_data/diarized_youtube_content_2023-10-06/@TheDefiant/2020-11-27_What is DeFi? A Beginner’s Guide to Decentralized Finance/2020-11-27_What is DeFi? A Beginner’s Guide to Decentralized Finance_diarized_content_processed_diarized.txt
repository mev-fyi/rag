00:00:00.250 - 00:00:28.500, Speaker A: You welcome to DFI 101. If you saw the pilot to this series, which was impermanent loss, you'll know that we're digging into the core concepts behind DFI, and in this series, you'll learn all about DFI in under two minutes, in 30 videos, with topics spanning dapps, smart contracts, lending, borrowing, trading, trust, intermediaries, censorship, p to p wallets and all that good stuff. So buckle up, lean back. This is DFI 101.
