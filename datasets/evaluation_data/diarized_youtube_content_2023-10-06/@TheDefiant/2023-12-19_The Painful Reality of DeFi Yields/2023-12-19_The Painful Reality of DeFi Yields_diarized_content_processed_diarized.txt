00:00:00.170 - 00:00:39.110, Speaker A: If you don't know where the yield is coming from, you are the yield, as they say in crypto, because there are like. If you look at RBA, RBA gives you sustainable yield, like corporate bonds, right? Because companies are working, they're generating revenue, whatever. There is some distribution, there are some yields being paid, and that is somewhat regardless of the market cycle. Of course, the price of the bond can vary, but the yield usually is based on the coupon. You have, of course, a bunch of risks in there. But the point is, regardless of the cycles, as we mentioned before, there are many different instruments which have lesser or high yield, regardless of what cycle it is. But that means there is constant flow, there are constant things to do, there are constant things to rebalance.
00:00:39.110 - 00:01:00.094, Speaker A: With crypto, it's a very cyclical market. Coin go up, many users, everybody happy. Coin go down, zero users, nobody happy. Everything is wrecked. Like funding rates. Because of that, volatility is the driver of the yields, right? Essentially funding rates. So last cycle, I think funding rates for BTC and ETH loan were like, or short.
00:01:00.094 - 00:01:30.620, Speaker A: Were like, what, even at 100%, right. 50 plus on centralized exchanges in the past few months, it was about 510. So it's a huge collapse. Usually they should be about 10% plus 20, right, 30 good range. Perpetual, Dexes and D five protocols. So far, perpetual is exceptionally having about three x in the funding rate compared to sexes, right? Because again, the bigger the books, the lower you give. The smaller the books, the more you give, because you have to balance it out.
00:01:30.620 - 00:01:55.182, Speaker A: Crypto for now is still based on the cycles, because most of the yield. Why do people pay lending rate? Because they borrow. Loop whatever, hedge whether they hedge, whether they borrow, because there is a lot of money being made, a lot of volatility. So it all comes back to that. What do you think about the sustainability of yield? So, sustainability of yield depends on the different activities that are done within the space. And crypto for now is only based on volatility. And like coin go up, coin go down.
00:01:55.182 - 00:02:19.094, Speaker A: When coin go down, funding rates are terribly low. Coin go up, funding rates are insanely high, 50% plus. So it's a really huge discrepancy, and there is no recurring activity, recurring yield. Like, for example, corporate bonds paying you for capital, right? Which is like just fixed rate, or like SME lending, which is fixed rate. The underlying can fluctuate, but the rates are based on the coupons. Crypto doesn't have that, right. So it is fully based on up, down, up, down.
00:02:19.094 - 00:02:49.550, Speaker A: So when it's down, yields are ass really bad when it's up. Yields are insane. Entire tradfi wants to put their mothers into crypto and deposit everything. They have to take bank loans like they have before. I'm not sure how exactly crypto will get to the point of having sustainable revenues. Because for yields to be sustainable, need to have revenues, right? There needs to be sustainable businesses to an extent, because if you only base it on volatility, all of the yields will slowly collapse. Right? Nobody's buying options out of the normal price range anymore.
00:02:49.550 - 00:03:18.986, Speaker A: The yields are lower. Everything is lower, activity is lower. So it's again, cyclical. You would need to have companies actually having products actually with recurring revenues for these flows to be more consecutive and stable and repeatable. I'm not sure next cycle will bring that just yet. This cycle already we have obfuscated funding rates into different segments already. Of course, a lot of it is based on the token emissions, because again, it's still only a few thousand users really, who are using it.
00:03:18.986 - 00:03:44.430, Speaker A: Liquidity is still very small. You still need to bootstrap it. There are still not really huge revenues happening. So token bootstrap is a big thing, which is okay, right? It lets people take part in something new, and if their bet is right, or if the protocols they hold are good, then yeah, fantastic. If not, well, they can always be consecutively selling the yield. So, yeah, yields are not sustainable in crypto. I'm not sure if they exactly can be.
00:03:44.430 - 00:03:53.490, Speaker A: If more rea is brought into crypto, that of course makes that more sustainable. Right. It will not be crypto native, but it will be taken from the outsource.
