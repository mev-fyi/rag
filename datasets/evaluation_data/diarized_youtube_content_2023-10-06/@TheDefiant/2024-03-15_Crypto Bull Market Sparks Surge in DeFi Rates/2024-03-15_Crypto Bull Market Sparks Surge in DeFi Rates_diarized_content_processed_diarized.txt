00:00:00.170 - 00:00:23.214, Speaker A: With all the big brains in DeFi, I would assume this can be added to the algorithm. It would be more efficient to have maker rates adjust automatically than to rely on maker community springing to action and voting on a rate hike or cut. All right, welcome everyone, to crypto with.
00:00:23.252 - 00:00:41.218, Speaker B: Cami, where we go through the main headlines in crypto and DFI in the past week in 30 minutes or less. This is the show for the week starting March 11. So for this week, main headlines were ethereum implemented its Dencoon upgrade. Crypto markets continue to rally. Meme coins are the focus of the current rally.
00:00:41.314 - 00:00:43.318, Speaker A: Doc with hat and misspelled.
00:00:43.334 - 00:01:24.840, Speaker B: Joe Biden are some of the top ones. And there's an interesting trend in DeFi. As the bull market heats up, rates are spiking. I'll dive into DeFi rates because this key measure of the cost of money has far reaching implications. So the first thing to note is that lending and borrowing rates have been climbing in DeFi all through this year. It used to be that DeFi lenders weren't offering much more than treasuries, with T bills yielding around 5%. Well, those days are gone, as stablecoins in DFI are yielding between 15 and even topping 20%.
00:01:24.840 - 00:02:26.358, Speaker B: So here into the block, you see these charts of stablecoin lending rates. Everything is spiking in the past couple of months, way above 10% rates. So the, you know, rates are, rates are a reflection of how much money costs and how much leverage there is. And right now, there's so much leverage in DeFi. This really great chart by coinglass shows this. So the orange reflects increasing APRs and green and blue are lower apRs. And here you see, since February, everything is slowly changing to orange.
00:02:26.358 - 00:03:36.834, Speaker B: So, like I said, rates are a reflection of how much money cost, how much it costs to borrow money, and how much you are being compensated for depositing money and indirectly lending it out. So the reason why yields are higher now is because there's more demand for money in Defi, and that's because traders believe they can borrow money and make more money with it. So with all the airdrops and points, liquid staking and restaking protocols, meme coins blowing up, all of that is hyping up the market and putting FOMO back in traders and inspiring djens to borrow and hopefully amplify their winnings. On most cases, lending and borrowing rates get set according to supply and demand. But maker is special because in maker rates get voted through with governance. This means that lend and borrow rates for Dai, the stablecoin, that maker issues. When everything else was spiking, dai rates started lagging behind the market.
00:03:36.834 - 00:04:28.462, Speaker B: So you see here again into the block, that green line is spark. That's makers lending market. And you see it there lagging below everyone else. So that means that while everything else was over 10%, dye savings rate, or the rate that maker offers in order to deposit DAi was at 5%. While the so called stability fees, or the fees associated with minting dAi, or borrowing against different token collateral was at around six and 7%. That's versus 20 plus percent to borrow stablecoins. So what happened was that there was no incentive to hold DAi, since other stablecoins were offering much higher rates.
00:04:28.462 - 00:04:59.734, Speaker B: And that prompted DAi supply to drop dramatically from 5.3 billion at the start of the year to as low as 4.4 billion last week. So here on the maker burn website, you can see how quickly Dai supply was falling. So a reminder that the way to issue die is to borrow it against collateral. Dai has a liquidation ratio of 150. So in order to get 100 die, you have to post at least collateral worth at least 150 die.
00:04:59.734 - 00:05:56.430, Speaker B: So Makerdao takes all sorts of collateral, from ETH to USDC to rock, bitcoin and real world assets. So what happened was that people were closing out their Dai loans because they were dumping Dai. So the proportion of stablecoins backing Dai started declining, presumably because they're the most liquid assets and they were easier to sell when people want to close out their positions. So here you see in this dune chart, the collateral asset per type. It's super interesting to see that stablecoins went from making up over 60% of collateral to under 10% in just a few weeks, just since the year started. And what was left was mostly real world assets. So the Makerdao community sprung into action and approved a proposal to hike rates.
00:05:56.430 - 00:06:26.966, Speaker B: The DSR was increased from 5% to 15%, and die stability fees to borrow were raised between 15 and 17.25%. Since then, die supply has increased to 4.6 billion from 4.4 billion, adding 200 million in just five days. So it's not bad. The higher rates are working. See here that you see a bit.
00:06:26.988 - 00:06:28.038, Speaker A: Of a bounce back.
00:06:28.124 - 00:07:16.434, Speaker B: So now there's a couple of interesting takeaways besides the obvious one that DFI traders are paying more to borrow, and that's raised rates across the board in Defi. It's also interesting to note about maker that one, it relies on humans to coordinate and vote in order for its rates to align with the broader market. Meanwhile, other lenders like Ave and compound use algorithms to determine rates in real time. So I asked Twitter why this is the case and got a few interesting answers. So rice ETH said, in other platforms there is indeed a market where one borrows the asset from another user. There is a counterbalance where the interest rate can be determined by supply and demand. In maker, there is no counterbalance.
00:07:16.434 - 00:07:27.174, Speaker B: The borrowed assets are freshly minted by the protocol. So Makerdao works more like a central bank. It issues Dai against collateral.
00:07:27.222 - 00:07:33.200, Speaker A: It's not really a lending market. There's no borrower on the other side.
00:07:34.130 - 00:08:24.154, Speaker B: I would counter though, that spark is maker's lending market. So there you can find lenders and borrowers. So presumably maker could have some sort of algorithm that took into account the supply and demand on spark to determine Dai rates. And then son McPherson from Phoenix Labs, which continued to spark, said this is easier to do when there isn't an excess of demand for holding the stablecoin as a currency. Since 2020, Dai demand has been much higher than demand for leverage. So you don't get that on chain feedback mechanism readily available. Still, like Sam said, there could be an algorithm that takes into account the amount of collateral there is in the system to calculate rates.
00:08:24.154 - 00:08:36.210, Speaker B: So Sam said a mechanism could be made to track the PSM side, that's the collateral pool size and make automated adjustment, but it just hasn't been a priority.
00:08:36.630 - 00:08:38.500, Speaker A: So to me this is super interesting.
00:08:39.430 - 00:09:14.110, Speaker B: This time the market move was gradual enough that Makerdao could put forward this proposal. It says accelerated proposal rate system and could react in time. But you could easily imagine a time when this is not the case and rates can shoot up, prompting a large amount of dye to be burned and collateral to be withdrawn. And maybe humans aren't fast enough to react, while an algorithm would just do it automatically. And then the second point is what happens in this theoretical dye supply crunch.
00:09:14.770 - 00:09:17.434, Speaker A: If a lot of the collateral that's.
00:09:17.482 - 00:09:23.970, Speaker B: Left is not liquid stablecoins but real world assets, so what happens?
00:09:24.040 - 00:09:32.754, Speaker A: That stablecoin collateral would be quickly depleted and then maker can't sell real world assets fast enough so you could have.
00:09:32.792 - 00:09:36.622, Speaker B: This kind of spiraling bank run scenario.
00:09:36.766 - 00:10:37.720, Speaker A: Anyways, this is very much a block swan. Don't want to sound like any alarms or anything like that on maker, which has always proven to be safe and resilient in all of these situations, all through booms and busts, and so far this human centric approach works. There is something to be said. Maybe algorithms don't take into account many other factors that maker wants to optimize for. It is a special situation where this is more of like a central bank than a lender. But in any case, with all the big brains in Defi, I would assume this can be added to the algorithm. And I don't know, it just seems like it would be more efficient to have maker rates adjust automatically than to rely on the maker community springing to action and voting on a rate hike or cut.
00:10:37.720 - 00:10:50.402, Speaker A: What do you think? I love to know. More opinions in comments. I think this is such an interesting topic. Okay, now moving on to other headlines.
00:10:50.486 - 00:11:01.614, Speaker B: Obviously the big headline this week in Defi and Crypto was Ethereum activated its Denkun upgrade. It went by really smoothly and it.
00:11:01.652 - 00:11:26.630, Speaker A: Really brings in a new era for L2 scalability. As the main thing that this upgrade does is it dramatically reduces L2 costs. So hopefully, just as this bull market gets started, L2s are cheaper and more mainstream apps can be built on top of Ethereum. It's interesting to note though that this EIP.
00:11:28.890 - 00:11:43.326, Speaker B: 4844, which is the one to bring down L2, cost with something called blobs or binary large objects. And I won't get into all the technical specifics here, but this eap was.
00:11:43.348 - 00:11:44.990, Speaker A: Not the only one to go through.
00:11:45.140 - 00:11:56.846, Speaker B: Apparently Denkun was one of the Ethereum upgrades that had the most eips baked in. So really recommend this story by Sam.
00:11:56.878 - 00:12:01.060, Speaker A: Haig of our team, which goes through all the different upgrades that.
00:12:02.870 - 00:12:18.774, Speaker B: Denkun had. Next up is obviously more price action. Bitcoin stored past 72,000 on the ETF front. Grayscale filed for a mini bitcoin ETF.
00:12:18.822 - 00:12:50.062, Speaker A: Like a mini GBTC. And this is of course as it's seen, billions in outflow flows from GBTC because it has the highest fees out of all of bitcoin ETFs. So mini GBTC would have lower fees and be more competitive with other ETFs. Also, markets related AI tokens continue to outperform. The combined market cap of AI tokens.
00:12:50.126 - 00:12:53.380, Speaker B: Is up 800% in four months.
00:12:54.970 - 00:13:30.430, Speaker A: Meme coins are obviously another big point of focus in this market. Dog with Hat is one of the main ones, and this is a Solana based meme coin. It's just a meme of a really cute dog with a hat. I can see why people want to get behind this. It's just incredibly cute. Anyways, this community raised almost $700,000. They raised $690,000, exceeding their 650K goal to put dogwith hat in the famous Las Vegas fear.
00:13:30.430 - 00:14:19.310, Speaker A: People were worried this is definitely looking like a top signal, but there you go. There are no limits to how far memes can go. Next is the Avo Airdrop happened this week it debuted its token with a $3 billion valuation, and another token lots of people are looking out for is the Etherfi token launch. So Etherfi is one of the biggest restaking protocols. They have moved up their plans to launch a token, so they had said that they would release a token in April, but this week we learned that they moved it up to March 18. So heads up on that.
00:14:19.460 - 00:14:50.042, Speaker B: Another project that's heating up is thorchain, this really OG crypto project that facilitates cross chain swaps. It has been played by bugs and exploits and hacks, but it launched a lending market. The mechanics are super interesting, really recommend reading our story to learn more about it. And with this new lending feature, its.
00:14:50.096 - 00:15:22.480, Speaker A: Rune token was up 70% in just one week. And finally, we have really interesting news in the Dow front, with Wyoming passing a new bill that provides a legal framework for Daos. So those were the main headlines in Defi and crypto this week. Let me know what you thought about them, let me know what you think about Makerdao's rate system, about the increasing leverage in Defi, and see you all next week.
