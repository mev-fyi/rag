00:14:49.464 - 00:15:11.550, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Good morning. How are you feeling today? Ready. You had enough coffee and tea to be awakened? Almost any jet lags? Yeah. Long flight. All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host today and tomorrow. My name is Rashid Berker and Hosh.
00:15:11.550 - 00:15:50.354, Speaker A: And it's my pleasure to extend a warm welcome to all of you to Solana Crossroads. Thank you. In 2023, this event stood as the apex of crypto gatherings of the year. And now we are back to bring you the second edition. And right here, right now, in Istanbul, Turkey, a quick note. The name of the country changed from Turkey to Turkey. Local people, they know.
00:15:50.354 - 00:16:51.294, Speaker A: So I might be going on the official site for a while, but it's turkey, Turkey that's the same country. And the country is a dynamic place for burgeoning hub for the crypto industry. And as a historical site, Istanbul has long been a center of crossroads, melting pot and the meeting point for different civilizations. That's a city of 3000 years, the capital for roman empire, byzantine empire and ottoman empire. And now this is the largest city in Turkey, roughly. Turkey has 90 million population and Istanbul officially, 17 million, unofficially, 20 million, maybe more, we don't know. And it's a emerging capital hub for crypto community and also leds the way to innovation and commerce.
00:16:51.294 - 00:18:00.144, Speaker A: In 2020, Turkey. Turkey boasted the highest cryptocurrency adoption rate among all european nations, with 16% of its populace reporting ownership or usage of digital assets. And the city is teeming with the burgeoning array of blockchain and crypto startups flourishing within a dynamic tech ecosystem encompassing over 5000 startups and more than 70 incubators and accelerators. With a youthful, as you might see in this room, and tech savvy demographic with over half of its residents under 30 years old. Maybe I see under 20 years old. Like my cousin who's helping me today, he's assisting me. And as I told him, I'll be presenting an event like this named Solana, he said, oh, uncle, I should be there and he's here with me, so you can mingle and network during the sessions later.
00:18:00.144 - 00:19:38.484, Speaker A: And Istanbul witnessed exponential growth in its startup scene and a warm embrace of transformative technologies such as blockchain and crypto. As for today, we all gather to celebrate Solana, a blockchain platform, as you may know, that is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of decentralized finance. Solana is designed to be fast, secure and highly scalable with the ability to process thousands of transactions per second. This makes it an ideal platform for a wide range of use cases from gaming and NFTs to defi and more. We are thrilled to present an exceptional roster of speakers and panelists today, and they are poised to delve into their insights and expertise on Solana and the expansive crypto ecosystems. You're expecting to glean knowledge from investors, developers and entrepreneurs driving the evolution of crypto as they unveil the latest trends and innovations in the field. Because of that, we are strongly encouraging you to cease the day to networking and engaging with fellow attendees, hailing from varied backgrounds and experiences.
00:19:38.484 - 00:21:23.234, Speaker A: This affords a unique chance to connect with kindred sprits, exchange ideas, and cultivate new collaborations that have the potential to reshape the future of landscape of crypto. For this end, we have created an extensive agenda featuring mainstage presentations, panel discussions, breakout sessions and workshops that is ranging from crypto fundamentals to advanced topics like Solana AI developments and spotting the hardest token launch. Additionally, our sponsors and exhibitors will be showcasing their latest offerings, so we strongly encourage you to explore their booths during the breaks and they are downstairs. At this point, a very heartfelt thank you is owed to our esteemed hosts and partners whose unwavering support has brought Solana crossroads to life. Without them, today's exploration of the thrilling possibilities of crypto and blockchain technology would not be possible. So after this long and precise introduction, I don't want to take too much of your time because I see you're excited to see the speakers and panelists. Let's fully embrace the potential of this dynamic technology and vibrant Istanbul ecosystem as we embark on this journey into the world of solana and crypto.
00:21:23.234 - 00:22:17.856, Speaker A: And if we are all ready to kick the things off, I'm excited to introduce George Harrop, co founder of Step Finance and a driving force behind Solana Crossroads. Thanks. Welcome. So, with over twelve years of experience in crypto, including founding the first crypto money transfer startup, George is now dedicated to bringing the next billion people, next billion people into the crypto world. That's what we're going to do. And once again, please join me in welcoming George Hareb with a big round of applause. Thanks.
00:22:17.856 - 00:22:37.948, Speaker A: Thank you. That's me, by the way. You can see the likeness. Thank you so much, guys. Welcome to Solana Crossroads in Istanbul 2024. Really excited to see you here. We've got, we've got an amazing crew together.
00:22:37.948 - 00:23:14.920, Speaker A: We've got some of the best names in the whole Solana ecosystem coming to join us this year. I want to just take a little bit of your time to, I guess, set the stage and then I'll hand it over to our amazing next panelist as well. So look, Solana Crossroads is our second year. Very excited to be here again. This is three x three times larger than the last year. The first year that we did this last year, the point was to prove that we can do it, we can put on a conference and it can be a great success. And it was, and now we're upping it, we're going a lot larger.
00:23:14.920 - 00:23:38.418, Speaker A: And you know what I said last year, why are we here in Turkey? Why? Well, it's because crypto in Turkey is 30 million crypto users. There's events that we're putting on Solana All Stars. We've got our Solana all stars in the crowd as well. Let's go. We've got Solana all stars from all over the country. So amazing. So thank you so much for coming.
00:23:38.418 - 00:23:58.794, Speaker A: I know some of you have been traveling through the night on buses and it's been a very long journey to get here. Welcome. I hope you'll enjoy it. In some cases. This is people's first crypto conference that they've been to. So number one, really excited to have everyone here. Number two, we're building in Turkey because it makes sense.
00:23:58.794 - 00:24:49.072, Speaker A: It's the place to be if you're building a business, if you're building a crypto company, a startup, all these sorts of things. We want to introduce the world to Turkey, so we want to bring the world here and we want them to see the opportunities here. We also want to help the people of Turkey be able to find jobs in web3, to be able to start companies, to be able to start and do amazing things. Solana, as the fastest, cheapest blockchain out there with the highest volume, the most number of users, some of the wallets, we got the solflare crew in the crowd as well. You know, some of these wallets have millions of daily active users, and that's really incredible. Right? There isn't really any other places that this happens, by the way. So Solana is really poised to be that place where you can, you can build stuff.
00:24:49.072 - 00:25:12.464, Speaker A: There's hackathons going on, there's grants going on. We've got the Solana foundation here as well. We've got some of the daos in the house as well. We're going to be talking with Jupiter later on with some of their dao stuff, and they do grants. So there is lots of ways that you can engage and be part of the Solana ecosystem. Please do, like, go downstairs to the exhibits. Go and talk to all of the people if you can.
00:25:12.464 - 00:25:41.028, Speaker A: We have the simultaneous translations as well. If you are not an english speaker, no problem. You can get the headsets out the front, so please do that. And we're going to have panelists from across the world on today. But look, Crossroads was really an amazing event for us to put on some of the awesome step finance crew that's been putting it on. We got Chris over there. We've got a lot of other people.
00:25:41.028 - 00:26:11.014, Speaker A: Theptilla is somewhere around here, but we've got an amazing bunch of people that's making this happen. Thank you so much for coming. I'm pretty sure I've said everything I need to say, so enjoy the conference, have fun. Go and talk to all of the exhibitors. Really excited to have you here. We have events in the evening as well, and, yeah, we have really cool panelists throughout the day, so definitely come into this area. By the way, did you like the tunnel? The tunnel's great.
00:26:11.014 - 00:26:27.716, Speaker A: The tunnel's amazing, man. I really like the tunnels. So, yeah, take some pictures there as well. We've also got, like, an Instagram area as well, so hashtag like solanacrossroads. Or if you're on Twitter, alanacrossroads. But, yeah. Thank you so much, guys.
00:26:27.716 - 00:26:53.592, Speaker A: Without any further ado, I'll hand over to an amazing hype man, cash from super team. So testing, testing. Cool. No chairs. Ah, there are the chairs. Excellent. How's everybody doing out here? People feeling good? Hello, hello.
00:26:53.592 - 00:27:19.452, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, this is someone. I see some friendly faces over here. My name is Kash Donda. I am the Sherpa of super team, freshly hydrated as well now. And I'm going to be talking today with Xiang, the co founder of Jupiter. How many people here have heard of Jupiter before? Can I see a show of hands? All right, most of the audience. How many people here have actually used Jupiter? Anyone? Any Jupiter users here? All right, pretty good.
00:27:19.452 - 00:27:37.360, Speaker A: Yes. Young zappy. Anyone use it this week? Is anyone on top of this morning? I'm hearing from the audience as well. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. All right, well, we're going to talk today about a whole bunch of things around Jupiter. Maybe to start, I think the panel title was billion dollar token.
00:27:37.360 - 00:28:16.522, Speaker A: What's next? So maybe we can start with the token itself. Well, actually, I'll take that back. Do you want to tell for, I think, part of the audience maybe not so familiar with Jupiter? How would you describe Jupiter in, like, 60 seconds? So Jupyter is basically an aggregator on Solana. So you can go to Jupyter to buy any tokens that you can buy on Solana at the cheapest price. That's what we do. On top of that, we also have other products as well, limit order, DCA and the perpetual product and even more afterwards, which we'll talk about a little bit here. So with the token launch, any Jup token holders in the building here? Yeah, all right.
00:28:16.522 - 00:28:48.624, Speaker A: A few people. Not enough people. That's not financial advice. You know, you should do what you like, but. So the token launched in January, excuse me, in Jupiter, if I'm not mistaken, and went to something like 950,000 wallets. Can you talk a little bit about how that launch happened and just like from the infra perspective, how you made that real? I mean, it's a, you know, Jupiter, we've been working on it for the last two and a half years, so that's why we have like 955,000 airdrops that we are planning. I mean, we were planning to do at that point.
00:28:48.624 - 00:29:20.600, Speaker A: Obviously, the biggest concern at the point was like whether Solana can take on the stress, like suddenly to have like 955,000 users coming back to Solana and claim the Jupyter token. Right. So we did. I was pretty worried for the longest. I think everyone's, the foundations was worried. Dito was telling us how you can do the airdrop more properly and stuff like that to make sure that the network can sustain the stress. I mean, Miao, my co founder, has some very good suggestions.
00:29:20.600 - 00:30:06.924, Speaker A: So he basically told us that why don't we just do a series of pre launches? I'm pretty sure some people got the mock juke token as part of it. Then before that we did the when launch as well. So all this launches basically to get us prepared for the main Jupiter airdrop. It's actually pretty fun because, I mean, fun in the way that we did end up spending a lot of money on all the infrastructure around and also the teams we have to build. So many redundancy. So one of the things that, I'm not sure how many people here are technical, but I would just share what I can we just see a show of hands, who here is actually a developer or a coder that we'll know how technical to kind of go? Seems like some, some. Yeah, maybe not.
00:30:06.924 - 00:30:51.104, Speaker A: I mean, hopefully this will be like, interesting to you guys, but I'm just going to say it anyway. So before the launch, we have basically won, like, I think it's like five servers in one region serving all the traffic around the world. Then to prepare for the launch, we actually went multicloud. So we have servers on AWS, we have servers on GCP, we have servers on this thing called Fly IO. So in case any of one of them goes down, there's a redundancy to make sure that we can make sure the airdrop happens. Then we also end up signing up for two RPC providers as well. Triton and also helis to make sure that if one of them do go down, then we can make sure that there's enough redundancy.
00:30:51.104 - 00:31:23.836, Speaker A: It's a very stressful event. We went together at one place, I think it's like 20 of us in one house to make sure the launch was smooth. I mean, it was fun. I think everyone get to some of them never met each other before. And at the final launch, everyone was in the same house making sure that everything was working. Then on the day of the launch, everyone's looking at the graph going up and down, see how many people are buying and selling. Overall, it was stressful, but very, very fun experience.
00:31:23.836 - 00:31:57.460, Speaker A: And the community, I think, really embraced it. Obviously after a few weeks, it hit a billion dollars in market cap, if I'm not mistaken. I'm not sure. Yeah, I was like, I mean, if you ask me, it was still, I mean, it's still a blur to me. Like for the last three months, token launchers, then, like a lot. I mean, a good thing is like mint tokens coming up, picking up on Solana, then it put a lot more stress on our network basically since the launch. I think it helps, like in general, the overall Solana community and like everything, our team has been like very busy for the last three months.
00:31:57.460 - 00:32:35.726, Speaker A: Like, you know, the launch, then the Mint token seasons, then the Solana congestions, then now, now there'll be slightly a bit of slack with the network coming down, like properly. But still, I mean, it has been fun. Yeah, I mean, I think it helped kind of forge the network in fire a little bit to kind of stress test the network, but all right, so that's the token. The way that I kind of think about Jupyter these days and you tell me if this is right or wrong is. On the one hand, you have the kind of most comprehensive set of tools for traders. So anyone who wants to trade swaps, limit orders, dollar cost averaging, perps, et cetera. So that's one.
00:32:35.726 - 00:33:14.398, Speaker A: The second is this suite of tools that is like the most comprehensive liquidity solution for most developers or so your price APIs and everything else you're doing there. And then on the third side, you have a bunch of things that you just do for the ecosystem, because your tam is kind of limited by Solana's tam right now. And so maybe what we can do is talk about each of those kind of in turn. I think that on the trading side, I'm not sure. Certainly if you haven't heard of Jupiter, you might not really understand the scale of what Jupiter is doing right now. So I learned what is, to me, just like a bananas fact that right now, 50% of all compute for each block ensemble. So every 400 milliseconds, 50% of that is just Jupyter.
00:33:14.398 - 00:33:48.078, Speaker A: Is that true? And what are you guys doing about that? It's actually quite crazy, right? People are talking about, you know, like, how many transaction per second ethereum can do. Now, I was looking like, okay, like, I want to see how many transaction per second Jupiter alone is doing on Solana. Then when, like, looking at this, we are doing about 250 to 300,000 requests. I mean, transaction per second on Solana, and that's Jupiter alone. Jeez. And I think it's like, 300 /second transaction per second spot. I think more than Ethereum.
00:33:48.078 - 00:34:18.162, Speaker A: I think it's more than, like, all l two s. Exactly. It's actually pretty funny. Then, at the same time, yeah, we are doing about half the block size, every block coming in into Solana. It's actually very interesting in the sense that because of that, we can actually do a lot of optimizations on top of it. So, right now, is there a sense that you guys are crowding out other transactions through all this compute that you're using? I don't think we are counting out. I'm pretty sure that other transaction can still come in.
00:34:18.162 - 00:34:49.285, Speaker A: But as one of the protocols on Solana, it's also our responsibility to make. Make sure that we are not wasting any transactions unnecessary to make sure that more transactions can come in. So there are a few optimizations that we are thinking to do. If you look at all the Solana, I mean, Jupyter transaction on Solana right now, it takes up about. I mean, I'm not sure how many people here know about compute units. You can think about it, like, cpu cycle. It takes up about, on average, like, 65,000 cpu cycle.
00:34:49.285 - 00:35:26.090, Speaker A: But by looking at all the transactions that happened in the past, we feel that, I mean, our engineering team feel like there are ways to improve. So let's say that if we can improve, like, 20% less on the cpu cycles. That means we can free out 10% block size for everyone in the Solana ecosystem to use, which means another like 150 transactions. Hopefully all those are going to be extra Jupiter transactions. Just take more and more of the block. All right, so the scale of Jupiter is just bananas, but right now it is largely a kind of desktop experience, I think. Right.
00:35:26.090 - 00:35:55.798, Speaker A: In this kind of sense of what is next for Jupiter. Something I've seen that I'm very excited about is the great migration. Can you talk a little bit about the great migration strategy? I think there are a few things right. But the part that I'm most excited about is to get, you know, Solana and Jupiter to the, you know, greater, like, outside of the Solana ecosystem, like, in real life, whether people are using it for trading. Right. I'm not sure you, like anyone here, saw the news that we just bought the ultimate app. The plan is to migrate.
00:35:55.798 - 00:36:28.326, Speaker A: I mean, not migrate. Migrate is. I mean, I'm not too excited about migration. I'm more excited about growth. The goal is to actually get more users on the Jupyter apps that we are working on right now because I'm a song believer. I used to be, like, iOS engineers, and now, like, you know, everyone's like, I really want to see people, you know, like, it's actually very cool as, like a founder or like a, like, someone who's working, like, at Jupyter to see people start using, you know, the Jupyter app or have the Jupyter app icon on the phone, like, everywhere that goes. Right? Yeah.
00:36:28.326 - 00:37:01.110, Speaker A: And I think I personally very excited and very excited for that, that route and, you know, so the Jupyter mobile app is coming. Can I ask you a question that's going to make you hate me? When is it going to launch? When is the Jupyter mobile app? I mean, we have the test flight I'm running right now. We are submitting it to Apple for the approval and whatnot. I think it will come out, like, late now it's late May or early June. Okay. And you're guaranteeing that test flight? Test flight. Okay, cool.
00:37:01.110 - 00:37:18.710, Speaker A: So Jupyter mobile app is coming. I am really excited about that. It's probably the best way to start to onboard the masses. Instant swaps, zero fees, one click trading, all that other good stuff coming together. So it should be pretty fun. But I know we're short on time, so let's talk a little bit of the dev side. Because people in the room have used Jupyter.
00:37:18.710 - 00:37:53.634, Speaker A: They kind of get that it's a pretty phenomenal product. But from the dev side, basically every Defi team that I know of has integrated Jupyter at some kind of level. What can you say about the scale of the partnerships that you've had and the kind of value that you guys are driving for your partners? Yeah, it's actually very interesting. Our Jupyter API is free, so anyone can use it. At the same time, we have the self hosted binary, so we have people like quicknode and Triton. They will run the binary to serve the same API for all other partners in the Solana ecosystem. All for free? Yeah, all for free.
00:37:53.634 - 00:38:12.434, Speaker A: Unless you charge a fees on top of it. Then we'll take the cut. It's actually very interesting. I think it was like, two weeks ago, I was sitting down. I want to see how much all these partners are making by using the Jupyter API. I went through the ecosystem. I look at all the fees.
00:38:12.434 - 00:38:44.784, Speaker A: It's not 100% accurate, but looking at it right now, I think the Ecosystem, I don't think at LeAsT all these partners are making 100 million fees from just using the JuPyTeR API. That's insane. I think at a pretty ROugh CaLculatiOn, it's BetweeN 100 million to 150 million fees, $150 million in fees a year that your partners are making on Top of JupiteR. That's pretty exceptional, actually. That's a lot of money. We are not taking a single sense for. I mean, actually, we are taking some.
00:38:44.784 - 00:39:03.594, Speaker A: Not enough. Take a little bit. But that's crazy. The reason I love that so much is I feel like there's this constant complaint in Crypto. They're like, oh, these protocols, they have no Actual Revenue. They're not Actual Businesses and whatever else. Not only does Jupiter have revenue, but you're creating revenue based businesses for all these other partners as well, which is pretty exceptional.
00:39:03.594 - 00:39:35.076, Speaker A: We don't like to brag about numbers that we are doing, but I was bragging. Not bragging, just telling you some of the numbers, but something that I'm super proud of, you know, it's like, how do we create a system that let people make money on it? Right? Yeah. Because in the end of days, like. Like, the whole idea of, like, you know, protocols and whatnot is to make sure that other people can integrate, other people can use it, then at the same time, they actually do. They can create sustainable business on top of it. Yeah. It's the promise of, like, true defi, interoperability, composability.
00:39:35.076 - 00:40:16.174, Speaker A: On Solana, anyone can access and build a very substantial kind of business on top of. Are there any things that you want to see built on top of the Jupyter APIs that maybe some people in the audience might be able to pick up and do after? I would say, like for the last month or so, I've been working on, you know, a lot of. On the perpetual product, I've been talking to some of the teams that are thinking to build on top of the perpetual product. One thing that we are not very like aggressive on the front is that we still don't have the SDK out yet for the perpetrator. But I mean, but even that, we are still seeing people integrating with it. Yeah. The goal, I would say the goal for the next month or so is to have the SDK out.
00:40:16.174 - 00:40:46.064, Speaker A: I want to encourage people to start thinking about what are the things that they can build around JLP. What are the things that can build on top of the perpetual product? Makes sense. Let's actually talk a little bit about the perps product because I know you don't like talking about numbers. I do so, like, the numbers on the perps product are just, I think as of yesterday you had something like 70% to 75% market share for perks. For actually. Do you mind describing perks for people who don't know real quick? I mean, it's actually very easy. Like you can buy and sell with leverage up to 100 x.
00:40:46.064 - 00:41:05.124, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, which again, do your research before you're trading with 100 x leverage. That's a separate thing. But you guys launched the product five months ago at this .67 months ago, six months ago, six, seven. And now you're already routinely having billion dollar volume days with a B. Billion dollars, 700 something million just yesterday alone.
00:41:05.124 - 00:41:56.678, Speaker A: Where does the success, like, how did you guys build a product to get this much scale so quickly? I mean, it's actually pretty funny. People like, you know, look at the numbers. They ask me is how many people are involved in the team, is that it's technically one front end, one contract, then one back end. So three people are working on the product and it has, I mean, the team has way too much stress for the last six months because of the gray hair coming up on your head. When we launched perpetual, our idea was like, oh, we might be able to do like, you know, 1% of what the typical Jupiter volume is like a day. But now we are doing about sometimes 50%, sometimes equal amount of volume on the swap volume. Then we were like, okay, obviously that comes with a lot of problems as well.
00:41:56.678 - 00:42:39.606, Speaker A: Over the last six months, a lot of things that we have to learn and improve. To be honest, if you ask me why people are using it, I think in general the liquidity helps. There are zero price impact. That is very helpful for a lot of people who don't put big volume into it. But at the same time, I was also pretty surprised by the fact that people who are using it are not actually like doing big amount of transactions. There are actually a lot of smaller traders who are like, they like engaging with it daily and we want to encourage that. So there are a few improvement that we are going to release, like in the next two or three months to help more smaller traders, like in the sense that we're going to reduce some of the fees to make them lower for the smaller traders.
00:42:39.606 - 00:43:02.778, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. So lower fees based on the size of the actual trade. Gotcha. Anything else that's coming up on the perps product side? I know you guys been working tirelessly on that. SDK is one thing. I think they'll be very helpful for the developers then. The second thing is that I'm not sure people saw the announcement that we are working with Gauntlet and Chaos lab on the parameter risk setting as well.
00:43:02.778 - 00:43:38.164, Speaker A: They might be something that we will launch. I'm not sure I can share right now that would be good for just not, not just for the purpose. It will be cool for the whole Solana ecosystem as well then. Yeah. The good thing is, all this improvement that we are working on right now are all under recommendation by Chaos Lab and Gauntlet. These are the people who have been very involved in the EVM ecosystem, and we are the first Solana protocol they are working with right now. It's actually very cool to see them getting onboarded on the onto Solana.
00:43:38.164 - 00:44:17.414, Speaker A: Like, start learning all these in and out about Solana, you know, how the account system works and stuff like that. I feel like with them in the ecosystem, we can start measuring what are the market risk people that some of the things that people always think about, you know, contract risk or, like, security risk, but, like, not many people think about, like, market risk in general for the, for everything on the ecosystem. So more stability, more resilience, more safety for everybody around, which is pretty great. Listen, we only have about two and a half minutes left, and I want to do a few hot questions. We'll see if you like these. So the first question for you solicited from the audience. Shout out the streamflow boys who gave me this idea.
00:44:17.414 - 00:44:58.892, Speaker A: When is Jupyter going to go multichain? Obviously, you're only on Solana right now, when are you going to expand to the rest of the world? I mean, that's the question that I feel like it's actually pretty funny. People ask, like, before, before Jupiter token came about a lot of investors want to invest in, like, Jupiter. They always ask us like, oh, like, when? When are you guys thinking about multi chains? We always tell them, no, we are going to be on Solana only, right? Then all the investors will be like, oh, you're going to be on Solana only. There's, like, nothing like, you know, not that exciting. Yeah, there are not many, like, people using it and stuff like that. Like, I don't want to invest in you, you guys. But, like, yo, but you're the one who wants to talk to us first, right? And then now they're coming back.
00:44:58.892 - 00:45:20.582, Speaker A: It's like, oh, wow, you guys are on Solana. Seems like, you know, everyone's on Solana right now. Can we invest right now? It's like, yo, but the token is already alive. Like, if you want to invest, just buy token from the market, right? Yeah. So just to kind of confirm this for anyone who's listening in at home, Jupiter Solana only for the foreseeable future, right? Yeah. And the people like it. This is good.
00:45:20.582 - 00:45:34.246, Speaker A: That's good. That's what we like to see. Staying loyal, staying home. The next one here is. Any advice? Or let's go with this. What is your hottest crypto take? You've seen it all. You've been in the ecosystem for a long time.
00:45:34.246 - 00:46:00.278, Speaker A: You have a billion dollar protocol. What are your hot takes that you might be able to share with these folks? To be honest, I don't know. But one thing that people have been talking about recently is Solana, l two. What do you think of Solana, l two? I mean, I tweet about it. I think just something that get people excited, but nothing really, like, behind it. Yeah. And, you know, it's like everyone talk about l two just to get people excited.
00:46:00.278 - 00:46:35.052, Speaker A: But, like, in the end of this, like, yeah, yeah, I get the money as well. But the cool thing is that I would say, like, any time, you know, they are like a hot thing, people will start investing into it and they will bring, like, you know, thing people might export, like, cool new things. I don't. I don't want to say 100% that, like, l two is useless, but I think for now I feel like something is there, but not like that, not too much. So there's not a Jupyter l two coming anytime soon that it has yeah, stay on the base chain, you get all the composability benefits, you have all the liquidity already there. Y fragment things around. Yep, I like that.
00:46:35.052 - 00:46:58.952, Speaker A: I think that's pretty good. We have just 10 seconds left. Any kind of final words? How do people in the audience get more engaged with Jupyter? What's the next step? I mean, if you're not on Solana, wait for the Jupyter app to come out. Definitely download it and use it. Yeah, download Jupyter app. Late May Siang has promised that it's going to ship exactly on time. And folks, if you're not already in the Jupiter discord, I definitely recommend you do that as well.
00:46:58.952 - 00:47:10.266, Speaker A: And then every Wednesday there's a planetary call that I actually host. So you can come hang out with us. 03:30 p.m. uTC and learn more about Jupiter Sion. Thank you so much. Thank you. Great.
00:47:10.266 - 00:47:37.954, Speaker A: And thank all of you. Cheers, guys. Bye. Let's roll. Oh, there's like dance music, too. The question was a good one. Thank you, gentlemen, for this interesting chat.
00:47:37.954 - 00:48:21.310, Speaker A: We began in full throttle and we will keep the same vibe and pace. And I see more people coming. Is this room is going to be enough for everybody? So now next we invite on stage Alevtina Jakovenko, who is head of community relations at Solana foundation, pursuing a sustainable community for the Solana ecosystem. And she's joined by my fellow friend Chris Fiore to give her insights on Solana community building. Please. Oh, hello. Testing, one, two.
00:48:21.310 - 00:48:37.876, Speaker A: Hello. Hello. What's up, everybody? How are you guys doing? Thank you for coming here. Thank you for being here. Thank you for sitting here with our talk. This is crazy. Thank you for coming here.
00:48:37.876 - 00:49:00.312, Speaker A: Sincerely, really appreciate it. There's nothing that I enjoy more than getting people together in one place that are passionate about something. I think everybody here is passionate about Solana, and there's nobody better that I could think of than Alvetina to, to talk about community, community building, community relations. So thank you for being here. Maybe you could just. Absolutely. My pleasure.
00:49:00.312 - 00:49:19.026, Speaker A: Could you just walk us through, like, what is your journey? Who are you? What's the myth, the legend? Tell us more about yourself. Okay. I always stand up. Let's sit down. Let's sit down. Good. Well, first of all, I'm very excited to see all of you here because that is the first conference of that scale that is organized not by Solana foundation.
00:49:19.026 - 00:49:53.024, Speaker A: Now, we're going to be talking a lot about the community building, but this is a great example of what the community can actually achieve where such a massive event that is literally the size of our first breakpoint, which is our yearly conference, in case you don't know. And this is organized completely, individually and autonomously by the step team. So very big applause for the step team as well. Thank you. Thank you. And just in terms of your Solana journey, your community journey, we were just talking about it over there. I've known alive Tina, for a while now.
00:49:53.024 - 00:50:45.256, Speaker A: She's been in Solana for probably over five years at this point. So walk us through that journey. It's been four and a half years for me at the Solana foundation at this point, but my Solana community journey has started a little bit earlier, which is actually pretty random. It was about seven or eight months before I joined Solana foundation, and I was just in a telegram group for the Berlin blockchain week, and someone asked if they could get help on helping setting up some local marketing and activating the Germany. And I'm not from Germany, but I do speak German, I've been there so many times. So I offered some help and asked what project it's for, and that was the only marketing person back at that time from Solana. And I just googled what the project was about and started reading about it, because in order to help, I had to understand what it is about.
00:50:45.256 - 00:51:26.060, Speaker A: So I got very excited through reading, and then we got connected a couple of times more. They asked me a bunch of marketing support, which I was more than happy to provide. And I guess they just liked what I was telling them, because seven months later, in January 2020, they offered me a full time job. Since then, I've been with Solana foundation. That's wild. So I think the takeaway here, for everybody out there listening, if you don't take anything else away from this talk, it's that if you go to events like this and you network and you talk with people, you never know what's going to happen. This could be the next person you start a company with.
00:51:26.060 - 00:51:43.058, Speaker A: They're sitting right next to you right now. This could be the place where you meet the next company that you're going to work with for the next five years and build something like Jupiter. Maybe that could change the entire world. So that's my takeaway from this. And you've been with the foundation four and a half years now after. That's correct. Right.
00:51:43.058 - 00:52:58.618, Speaker A: That's amazing. So, okay, walk me through what is community building? What does that mean? It is very different from four different companies and Solana foundation and definitely changed out throughout the years. So at this point, how we see the community is, let's talk about first what community is, because we use that term quite a bit in our conversations, and it always refers to something different depending on a context. So for Solana foundation, necessarily, the community is anyone who has interacted with something, some of the social media or some of the events or doesn't matter, any channel that was designed for the community within Solana foundation. So the second you follow us on Twitter, congratulations, you joined Solana community on a general level, but then we, of course, can go down the funnel and be a little bit more granular. So let's say there are activations in the markets, like in Turkey, there is a super team, or in many, so many other regions in Ukraine, there is a Kumeca team, or there is just regional channels that are allowing you to read about the information in your local language. So the second you find those channels, subscribes.
00:52:58.618 - 00:53:43.354, Speaker A: Congrats. You sort of, like, passed the test twice, and now you are much more deeper into the regional growth. But then you participated at the Solana crossroads or at Solana hacker houses. Now you are in that little group that has Austin hacker House, let's say people, a lot of people actually, from the hacker, continue chatting within that group and building together and exchanging ideas. So you are now much more closer and intimate community, even though it's still public. But then we go down even lower to the funnel, and those are closed communities, gated community, if you want to put it like that, like super team, like collective, that are close communities that are based on contribution and stronger contribution to the ecosystem. And you can go as granular as you want down.
00:53:43.354 - 00:54:39.818, Speaker A: And you can see that throughout these levels, you sort of increase your contribution to the ecosystem. So it takes a little effort to follow us on Twitter, but it takes a lot of effort to travel somewhere to provide your knowledge, to share it with the community. So it's sort of proof of work based structure. But that is, for Solana foundation, might be different for the local teams. And it has also changed throughout the years we went through from the model of managing the community where we had community. This is actually very fresh information, but we had community managers that had Solana official accounts that were helping people to get to know about Solana at the beginning. That is not the case anymore because of how many wonderful regional communities we have that offer much better services, much better skills and interactions for the local communities.
00:54:39.818 - 00:55:13.314, Speaker A: So we try to empower those and not manage them, and that has actually been working really well. Cool. So what it sounds like is there's many layers to what it means to be a community member. You could just follow on social, or you could be a part of Solana all Stars, super team Dean's list. Whatever it is, there's many layers. Do you have any idea how. How large the Solana community is? I know I'm putting you on the spot now, but do you have any idea? Well, if you do, count it, as I just said, from the general perspective, it's millions.
00:55:13.314 - 00:55:43.618, Speaker A: Over 10 million for sure. That's incredible. So 10 million a day, and in the future, trying to reach a billion. So you got to start somewhere, and I think that's huge. So I wanted to ask about the value, community values. So what do you see as the core community values for Solana? I think it's not as easy to win a new Solana member into the community. They are a little bit more picky.
00:55:43.618 - 00:56:32.216, Speaker A: They're a little bit more like evaluating you for the better purpose. So it takes a little bit longer to win a person over in order to join the Solana community. Sometimes because the tech is a little bit more complex, sometimes because they never heard about it, sometimes because they don't have a content in their own language. So it takes a little bit more time for them to absorb everything that needs to be to win over their heart. But then the second you won over their heart, I think the Solana community is very loyal, is very supportive to each other as well, which is one of the values that we keep at Solana foundation. There is never a conversation whose fault it is. It's always a conversation on how to find a solution.
00:56:32.216 - 00:57:05.564, Speaker A: And I can see definitely that's being streamlined to the community itself. And I cannot be more than happy to see them support each other. Actually, in hacker House in Miami, I was telling the story that inspired me the most. Someone asked me if what was the most, like, this tickling moment in your career? And back then, it was the moment when, after managing the community so many times and telling, hey, we don't like this. We prefer this type of communication. We really want to see you thrive. We really want to see your support.
00:57:05.564 - 00:57:40.824, Speaker A: When the moment when you see in the first fresh setup group that people start to exchange other's the skills and answering questions to each other. This is the most heartwarming moment for me. And it's funny because what's happening right now is actually the same thing, but on steroids, on a larger scale. That's amazing. And in terms of this tight knit community, that solves problems and works together. What would you say some of the largest challenges the community has faced and how have they overcome them? You've been through many storms, I'm sure, but we've weathered all of them. So talk through that.
00:57:40.824 - 00:58:13.544, Speaker A: Well, we try to stay very positive about the future, about the instruments, and there are a lot of stuff that foundation cannot talk about. That stuff we can talk about. And that's why I see our community being constantly challenged by misunderstanding of something. And this is my favorite part, to see where everybody's just coming together to fight against the misinformation about blockchain, about teams that build on that. And this is fantastic. It always gives me goosebumps. That's probably my favorite part of the crypto Twitter.
00:58:13.544 - 00:58:40.532, Speaker A: But I think that is also the hardest challenge for them because they do care so much. That's another value that I think is noticeable, that Solana community cares really deeply about the growth overall, not only being egocentric, but also supporting everybody else. So when there is a misinformation spreading out, I see them taking it very seriously. Yeah. And it's not, ooh, there's a problem. Let's talk about the problem. Oh, there's a problem.
00:58:40.532 - 00:59:40.750, Speaker A: How do we solve this? How do we help? Exactly? Yeah, there's always facts involved and solutions and instruments that I actually can check and try instead of just sharing and linking to informational sources. For sure. Very cool. So, okay, in terms of self sufficiency, we've talked a lot about this off camera, but I'd love for the audience to hear a little bit more about the foundation's vision for decentralization. What does that look like in terms of the foundation's involvement with the community over the next one year, two years, five years? Well, I just mentioned a couple minutes ago about how they support each other in a telegram group, but that's basically what's happening just on a larger scale. Our management has deeply invested into creating the local self sufficient teams, which has started from the super team. How many people know here what super team is? Everybody else? Okay, super team.
00:59:40.750 - 01:00:42.724, Speaker A: Super team Turkey is here. Okay, great. Yay. Fantastic. All right, so for those who don't know, super team is basically a separate company that got a grant from foundation at the early stages to grow the region, which was initially India, but then they expanded to many other companies. What they do is they set up a team locally that basically functions as a local Solana foundation, and we treat it that way, helping build the infrastructure on the market for people to easily onboard onto the Solana blockchain, which includes developers, of course, as our primary focus, but also users, also artists, VC's, universities. So they sort of work with the whole company, with the whole, sorry, infrastructure of the country, but focusing only on one region, which allows them to match the mentality better, get to the hearts of people in the right way, explain it in a way that actually makes sense.
01:00:42.724 - 01:01:36.614, Speaker A: So that has worked. This model has worked out so well that there are so many super teams right now in so many different regions. There are Malaysia, Turkey, Dubai, France, Germany, UK, like so many ones, which is a great way also for people to start when joining the Solana ecosystem system. But now we also see, I wouldn't call it competitors, because they usually are in a different region, but they sort of replicate the model under different brands, which is an example is medicamp in Singapore, Kumeca in Ukraine. They all do, they all pursue the same goal, just using different instruments, or sometimes similar instruments as we share the best practices is all. So just a little note on what, what super team is. And I think us relying on these parties is definitely the future which we are already in that moment.
01:01:36.614 - 01:02:40.052, Speaker A: They do, as I mentioned, they function as little foundations in the region, making it, making Solana instruments a little bit more accessible for the local society and for the local community. Just as far as the message in the discord, they also offer a bunch of, like, earning opportunities and stuff like that. So for us, getting away from managing decentralizing, that's for sure the vision for the next year or two, if you're speaking about five, that's basically turning into this massive self governance system, which I think, again, we are on the way to. And it's been working out very well. And you mentioned earlier, if fire dancer is going to launch, there's going to be much more. When the fire dancer is going to launch, it's going to be much more scalable and a lot of new applications going to be able to come onto the chain. So I think it's going to be a much more easier mass adoption for that purpose.
01:02:40.052 - 01:03:14.932, Speaker A: Yep. So your job in the future is to put yourself out of a job. That's exactly, exactly right. The interesting fact is that we are trying to make foundation less important instead of more important. So if something can be done better by the community or faster or more efficient, I would highly encourage you to do so and help as much as I can. So we always discuss that with my team, that we try to get rid of our jobs, that we try to be not needed on the market. Of course, foundation is going to keep the role if community cannot or doesn't want to do something.
01:03:14.932 - 01:03:44.042, Speaker A: But owning more and centralizing the community, that's not the goal at all. So it's decentralization not only on the tech side, but also on the community part, which is awesome because for everyone here, what she's saying is this is a massive opportunity. Like, there's so many opportunities to grow the community, to decentralize things within Solana. Obviously, this conference is a great example. It is. It's like a perfect example of what can be achieved. Yeah.
01:03:44.042 - 01:04:12.006, Speaker A: And that's only possible with the community. So thank you guys for being a part of this. But I guess my point to your point is there's so many more opportunities and directionally, maybe I love Tina will not have a job because of you guys. Please do so. Okay, what projects and initiatives? I know we've talked about a lot of stuff, but what projects and initiatives are you just most excited about? Are there any that you. Anything secret you could talk about or Alpha. Alpha.
01:04:12.006 - 01:04:59.024, Speaker A: Okay, so as I mentioned, subitim for sure. If you are from any of the countries that they are present for, or if you are not, they also have a global bounty. But check out, that's an amazing project for you to start and join. Whether you're a developer or designer, doesn't really matter. If there is no, no super team in your region, then I guess that's also an answer for you. What you can do, right? Wink, wink about that. If you are in a content stuff and you like creating videos and other content that is blockchain oriented, then Solana Collective might be an interesting point for you to explore, which is a program that started within the Solana foundation and potentially will be exploring, exploring its way outside as its own independent entity.
01:04:59.024 - 01:05:44.662, Speaker A: If you are a developer, then events like Mountain Dell, that happened already for several times, very successfully, producing many hackathon winners. That's definitely one to check out. And following the same module, we have an Island Dao already coming right after actually crossroads in Greece. And then if you want an alpha, then there's going to be another lake Dao in Canada, maybe later, potentially. What is that? Can you tell us? It's also mountain Dao focus. So developer focused, several weeks long event where you can come and build with other builders and get the support and mentorship you need. It's sort of different from the hacker houses because hacker houses are great, don't get me wrong, but they're a little bit more chaotic.
01:05:44.662 - 01:06:26.324, Speaker A: They're a little bit more about networking and meeting and presentations where mountain Dao type of events, similar like Island Dao and Lakedao, they are focused on successfully building. It's sort of like a coworking, but with one goal and with a lot of support. And if you're a user or you want to become a power user, I cannot be more than happy to share the all Stars program that step finance team is doing. It's in, correct me if I'm wrong, but it's in three countries right now. There are over 50 cds activated, and I think you guys have, like, 20,000 users. Yeah, over 20,000 people attending our meetups. That's insane.
01:06:26.324 - 01:07:02.914, Speaker A: So that's crazy. But I also like that the model is scalable. So if you want to join as a user, feel free to do so. But you can also join as an ambassador and contribute and bring this program, maybe you, your country, into your city and help and contribute in a way to the local community and become that leader, become that main contributor as we all are looking for. Amazing. Okay, so final thing, and then we'll do a little wrap up. The final thing is, for somebody here who's attending this conference, this is their first crypto conference ever.
01:07:02.914 - 01:07:30.944, Speaker A: They know about Solana. They want to get more involved. They want to do more within the ecosystem. What would you say to that person? Joining a more focused community is definitely going to be step one. So go check out super team Turkey. If you are from Turkey, go check out the all stars again and see what the communities are available in your region, because they do offer a lot of bounties. So if you want to start earning, that would be the case.
01:07:30.944 - 01:07:59.396, Speaker A: You're gonna get feeling of belonging immediately because of how supportive everybody is. So if you want to just start the journey, just go for the closest community and then to circle back. Our conversation is just react to random messages in german groups that can bring you a long way. So react to random messages in groups and definitely join a tight knit community for sure. Awesome. Cool. Well, thank you so much, Aleptina.
01:07:59.396 - 01:08:17.664, Speaker A: This is awesome. Yeah. Last thing, guys. Aleptina came from really far to be here with you guys. I want to get a big round of applause for her coming here and for you guys coming here. Come on. Hey, thank you so much, everybody.
01:08:17.664 - 01:09:22.496, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, Chris, Oliv, Tina, that was great. Hey, Chris, can I be a lifetime member of your team? I know you want to hear more. You want to spend more time with them, but tomorrow they'll be back on the stage as moderators. Now, with that being said, it's time for our first panel discussion, so we're changing format a little bit, and it's on the feature of trading on Solana. Join us as we uncover the transformative potential of Solana trading. Our expert panel will explore opportunities, challenges, and future trends, offering invaluable insight for traders. And please welcome on stage trags from clash trade, sion from Jupiter and King from Bunkbot.
01:09:22.496 - 01:09:56.238, Speaker A: And moderating the panel, Caitlin Cook, head of communications and marketing at Herolabs. Thank you. Sign seats, everyone. All right. Hi, Stanbull. How are we doing? There we go. Some more enthusiasm for the morning, maybe there.
01:09:56.238 - 01:10:14.316, Speaker A: Everyone's still waking up. All right, well, we're gonna get started here, as they said, first panel discussion, and it's on the future of trading on Solana. Obviously a big one. How many of you out there, by a show of hands, trade on Solana. Guessing it's going to be everyone. There we go. Good showing.
01:10:14.316 - 01:10:34.036, Speaker A: All right, long enough, yes. Could be more. No? We'll work on that this week. That's what it's for. So an original tenant of Solana, as told by Anatoly himself, was Nasdaq at the speed of light. So trading, obviously, a very core tenant of Solana. And we see a lot of teams that have been leading the charge on that.
01:10:34.036 - 01:11:22.030, Speaker A: We have contributors from three of those teams today, flash trade, Jupiter and Bonkbot with us. Going to have to be careful on watching the time here, because I think there's a lot that we can get into. So, for the few of you out there who may not be familiar, I just want to go through on intros first for who each of you are. Obviously, you're anonymous, so say as much as you want who you are, your journey in Solana, and then, of course, sign each of your respective products and the issues that you're tackling in Solana as pertaining to trading, I'll start with you. Yeah, I guess I'll start. I'm Tregs from flash trade. I think I've been in Solana since the very, very beginning and since back in 2020, 2021, and, yeah, mostly was a trader in the space, but only in the past two to three years.
01:11:22.030 - 01:12:06.312, Speaker A: Kind of decided to lend my expertise in trading and markets to a very capable dev team that we have a flash trade, and flash trade itself is a purpose protocol that allows for the trading of crypto and non crypto assets set up to 100 x, leverage not dissimilar from JUP's perp, but nevertheless, I think we do have. We're focused on just this. So we've been able to add a little bit extra functionality to the purpose trading experience both on the trader side and open. And yeah, my role there is head of risk. I'm the one that's setting all the parameters, setting up all the rules set and making sure that the trader experience is perfectly balanced with lp performance. Oh yeah. I'm Siong, co founder of Jupyter.
01:12:06.312 - 01:12:33.224, Speaker A: We do offer like a few trading experience on Jupiter, like the typical aggregator swap. Then we have the DCA, we have the limit order and the perpetual product as well. Down the road, we are now working on the mobile apps that I think can be very interesting to onboard more users onto Solana. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Hello, hopefully you can hear me. Okay. I'm king from Bonkbot co founder.
01:12:33.224 - 01:12:53.104, Speaker A: My mom said that if I was born a girl, I would have been called queen. So bonkbot is a Solana telegram trading bot. We are the biggest telegram bot on any chain. We started in August. I don't know if anyone here has used bonkbot by any chance. Thank you. Thank you very much.
01:12:53.104 - 01:13:17.160, Speaker A: And everything for us is about making trading easier for Solana traders. Trading meme coins primarily, but also any coins making it faster, which is Nasdaq on the blockchain, and making it so simple that even your friends from the pub or from the cafe can still, still use it. And that's punk book awesome. Thank you. And I didn't introduce myself. I guess that's an important part too. My name is Caitlin Cook.
01:13:17.160 - 01:13:46.026, Speaker A: I'm a marketing and comms contributor to Hero Network. Hero is an infrastructure and liquidity layers, protocols, power derivatives, trading applications and betting applications as well. But want to focus on the panelists here today. Obviously, three very big projects in Solana specific to trading, want to level set before we talk about the future, future of trading and just start talking about trading today. So might have some people in the audience jump up with their takes on this too. What do you. And we'll start with you.
01:13:46.026 - 01:14:35.254, Speaker A: What do we think are the biggest pain points for traders today when it comes to trading on Solana? Yeah, I think recently we kind of had issues with congestions from the tremendous amount of meme coins launching every day. Significant amounts of demand, demand to trade these very instantly. These are markets that move 30, 40, 50% in a matter of minutes. And so people are moving those markets that fast and that's the result of a lot of transactions going onto the chain. I know personally when I traded, if my transaction had landed five blocks later, it would have made a difference of 10% of my p and l. So it's kind of ridiculous. But at the same time it just shows that there's a lot of people that want to trade and a lot of people that want to use the blockchain and participate in these permissionless markets.
01:14:35.254 - 01:15:31.360, Speaker A: So yeah, obviously a lot of that traffic causes some bottlenecks and it's been really, at least I think the entirety of Defi got together for like a good two weeks. There was like, alright, we're not competitors today. We're just trying to make the experience better for all. How do we do that? And that was really cool to kind of see that come together and find out, you know, different approaches, different ways to, you know, every team had like, hey, I discovered this, that makes my transaction land a little bit better. And that was shared among everyone. And you know, I think, you know, we, the experience now has gotten better, but it can always be improved. I mean, yeah, since you're talking about congestions, it's actually very interesting topic, right? I think a lot, a lot of teams reach out to Jupyter like, yo, how do you guys land transactions when everyone couldn't land any transactions? It's actually pretty funny because we've been working on this problem even before congestion was an issue.
01:15:31.360 - 01:16:03.764, Speaker A: Our goal has been not as fast as bomb bot. These guys are crazy. But at least we want to make sure that anyone who comes to Jupyter, they can swap easily without worrying too much about how long it would take and stuff like that. So that part of the infrastructure has been built up for the longest time. So during the congestions, we actually share with a lot of people in the ecosystem. Iron fog, how do you spend like you can fan out your transaction to more RPC, stuff like that. Those are the things that we've been doing.
01:16:03.764 - 01:16:38.386, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure you guys are doing as well for the last six months. Like I say, in the end of the day, it's like, yeah, like anything that can land transaction faster. It's actually pretty funny, right? Because you look at Ethereum, people don't really think about these problems like 30 seconds, 1 minute, it's like, oh, this is fast. But on Solana it's like anything take more than 5 seconds, people will be like. And people get anxious like why is my transaction not going through? And stuff like that? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That. I think congestion is probably the main issue that we've all experienced.
01:16:38.386 - 01:17:07.884, Speaker A: Shout out to Shawn and the team, they've been really helpful for us. And other teams across Solana shout out also to Helios and Triton. We've worked very closely with them to just make transactions as fast as possible, because this is Solana, this is the expectation that your transaction lands within seconds, and if it doesn't, you get users angry, which is fair enough. You know, that's why we're here. We're here to build the future of Ux and blockchain. And so the users deserve the best possible trades. So, yeah, I agreed with that.
01:17:07.884 - 01:17:41.056, Speaker A: I think one thing, I guess, which is specific for us, has been trying to keep users safe. With the approach of meme coins and the takeover of meme coins. There's many rugs out there. I'm sure someone here has probably been robbed at least once. I've been rugged my fair share of times, but, yeah, keeping users safe as well as congestion have been the main issues we've been facing on our side. I think I want to add one last thing to that, is that not only do you have to land a transaction, then you have to display that information to the user. And it's that second step that your transaction may have landed, but you don't display to the user within 5 seconds.
01:17:41.056 - 01:17:59.836, Speaker A: Again, same amount of anxiety, even though you got the thing that they wanted to be done. No, definitely. And what great issues for Solana to have to tackle and many other chains. Look at the speed of Solana. Definitely one great feat in itself. And then also talking about recent congestion, again, what a great problem to have. Oh, no.
01:17:59.836 - 01:18:29.374, Speaker A: We have so many users that this is causing congestion issues. So it's great to have these things coming up early. It's great to see teams coming together and trying to solve these issues together as well. A lot of big brains out there, so moving forward as one, rather than, you know, kind of being broken up there. Speaking of, you know, things that we've all been doing together, so it wouldn't be a trading panel if we didn't talk about me, meme coins. How many of you guys out there traded meme coins in the recent run that we've seen lately? There we go. So have I.
01:18:29.374 - 01:19:12.300, Speaker A: So let's talk about how, from a trading platform perspective, I think there's something interesting, interesting to be said for the balance. Right? Meme coin markets run very hot. Sometimes it's a flash of a pan of like what? Meme coins are hot. And then when they're not anymore, how do you balance building this long term vision for a sustainable trading platform and the longer term visions and work that comes with that, with the sort of meme coin metas that pop up. I think there's a really important note to staying with the culture and what's relevant. How do you strike a balance there? Maybe we start with bonkbot. So we believe, as we said, that trading should be fast and frictionless.
01:19:12.300 - 01:19:56.670, Speaker A: I think the meme coins are a good example of a way to onboard retail. I'm sure you guys probably agree with that. And you can onboard retail, because they're a simpler product than other more complicated products, like options and stuff. And a user can look at a meme, and if they laugh, they can buy the coin, and it's much simpler than looking at a coin and reading the white paper. And I think some people argue that it's against the e force of crypto, and I think I can understand where you're coming from, but also I think that users just want to trade and have fun, and that's what we offer. We're not a complicated product. So, yeah, I would say one thing that we do have to watch out for is we have this bonkbots meme incinerator link.
01:19:56.670 - 01:20:28.784, Speaker A: I'm not sure if you guys have heard of it. We basically created a link in the first place for daos, and they could create their own custom referral link. And even if a user had already used bonkbot, they could sort of pledge their. Their fees to the dao. So it's monkey Dao, it's geckos or mad lads or whatever. And in doing so, they can fund the Dao, which has historically been really hard to do. And so we're really proud of that initiative, and it's helped fund different daos, and we did it for meme coins as well, because I think, Caitlin, I think you tweeted recently about how meme coins are becoming communities, and we agree.
01:20:28.784 - 01:20:56.616, Speaker A: And so we think that meme coins deserve the same opportunity to have the community rallied around each other. But it's also hard because we make these links for established coins, but we don't want to make them for rugs. Right. But it's often hard to distinguish what's a rug and what isn't a rug. Like, with NFT, sometimes projects just don't work, and that's just business and crypto. So, yeah, one thing that we struggle with is trying to figure out, like, from our side, who is a good project and who's not. Obviously, we offer the open marketplace.
01:20:56.616 - 01:21:20.142, Speaker A: You can trade whatever you like, but if we're going to sort of offer our own buyers we have to figure, figure out who's good, who's bad. Yeah. Min is a very polarizing thing. There are people who think that mint is not serious. We are crypto builders. We shouldn't do anything with Min. Then we have a group of users.
01:21:20.142 - 01:21:44.826, Speaker A: Actually, 99% of the crypto users are, let's trade it, let's buy it. Do all these things. For the longest time on Jupiter, you cannot really trade any new tokens that are coming up. But I'm not sure. People start noticing in the last two, three weeks, we actually have this t zero. We call it t zero initiative. The whole idea is that at t zero, the token launch, that's liquidity.
01:21:44.826 - 01:22:16.780, Speaker A: You should be able to trade on Jupiter. I mean, obviously you can argue about how do you think, whether it's safe, whether they will rock and all these things. The way we do it is that we show all this information on the UI right now. You will know it's a new token that just minted in the last few seconds. You would know whether they can. I think one of the biggest problem on Solana is that all these projects can freeze the token account, then become a big issue. So we actually let the user know that, okay, the project can freeze your account.
01:22:16.780 - 01:22:55.794, Speaker A: You might think about not buying it and stuff, stuff like that. And on the other end of it, it's like all the other SDK users, they are asking for it as well. Like, how can I trade tokens that are like, you know, just appear with some liquidity on chain? So we've been pushing hard on the, on the SDK side as well. The problem is that mostly on the stress on our infra to have, like, it means, like, what, 3000 new tokens a day right now? Whatever. 14,000. Yeah, 14,000 new tokens a day just to make sure that the infra can take in the load. Yeah, I'll kind of tail on two things there and then talk about my perspective.
01:22:55.794 - 01:23:51.016, Speaker A: I think the whole community with meme coin thing is just so, so strong. It's interesting that in some cases we have meme coins being created and then the community comes after, whereas I kind of find the strongest ones tend to have like a pretty strong community initially, and then the coin itself is created and in some way that there are coins out there that their entire market value is held up. Just because the community is holding a lot of the token and is willing to buy more and wants to. It's part of their social identity to a certain point. And the way I kind of view it is like, if you're among one of these communities, everyone kind of holds the meme coin, and we all have, our wallets are relatively public. And you find out, like, that your friends sold, you know, that's gonna create a social dynamic there that's, you know, pretty powerful. And it's what kind of, like, brings all these communities together, and it creates these, like, you know, kind of flash in the pan products that can be long lasting.
01:23:51.016 - 01:24:19.732, Speaker A: And we kind of see that with, you know, Bonk. We see that with wif, where they have kind of taken a small, that little bit and just made it huge. And now it's, you know, almost a movement. So I think that's really cool. I think the infra behind trading meme coins is, gets pretty ridiculous, and as it should, their, you know, speed matters. And, you know, if you're able to land one, transact your transactions even 10% better than your competitors, that just means more dollars in your pocket. Speaking of, sure, when leverage on meme coins checks.
01:24:19.732 - 01:25:10.956, Speaker A: So that was my next thing. Like, flash trade is a druidist platform. And so we always have demands of, like, hey, when are you listing this or what's your listing criteria? And we offer quite a bit of leverage. And the one thing that we always have to keep in mind, and I'm sure Jupiter keeps in mind as well, is that you never want to offer, especially no slippage, the ability to take along a no slippage, buy it up on the spot market, thus moving the price, and then sort of manipulating the market up, and the cost of that manipulation being less than what you would win on your derivatives position. I know I said a bunch of words there, but essentially, it's a very huge concern for anyone who offers derivatives platforms, especially with the structure that Jupiter and Flash offers. So as far as when meme coins, it's a very interesting risk problem, and we'll kind of work down the line. We started off with the main crypto, Solana, Ethereum, bitcoin.
01:25:10.956 - 01:25:43.080, Speaker A: We have our Solana beta pool, which includes Jupiter, pith, jitto, and wormhole. And these are billion dollar plus coins. Like, yes, they're volatile, but it takes quite a bit to move them. And we're not offering, like, infinite size on the derivatives. When it comes to meme coins, it becomes a very real concern. And so I think the way we'll kind of approach it is just, you know, keep working down the market capitalization list and, you know, because bigger assets take more money to move, and thus we can offer derivatives on them a little bit with a bit more of a safe approach. Yeah.
01:25:43.080 - 01:26:41.644, Speaker A: No, that was gonna be one of my questions for sure, because I think from a retail perspective, if you're just trying to trade, and obviously in meme coin season recently, that we've seen such a pressure in terms of the activity and trades that were being placed and whatnot, I think it's hard to step back and wonder why no hundred x on insert meme coin. I'm not shelling your bags up here, so not naming tickers, but there's some serious considerations from the back end, especially when you're adding in leverage to the equation and what that means for systems and kind of pressure testing those and whatnot. So that's a super important consideration. Yeah, there's always the other side of your trade and in flashes and Jupiter's case, like, there are the liquidity providers that are providing liquidity to these massive pools of money, and they are not doing so out of charity, they do expect some level of return or at least exposure to a reasonable amount of risk. And, yeah, you always have to keep them in mind, don't hand them something, be like, it's probably safe when it very much isn't. Definitely thinking on kind, kind of more on user experience side. And this is when I want to start with King here.
01:26:41.644 - 01:27:20.868, Speaker A: So meme coin season, I feel like everyone is trading pretty actively. Everyone probably glued to, I would assume, their laptop PC rather than mobile, but I think the mobile trading experience and mobile native trading, I'm sure everyone has thoughts on that up here. I personally would love to be able to have the same user experience for mobile versus a computer. Everyone has a phone in their hands. I'm sure every single person in the audience has a phone with them right now. So let's talk about advancing the mobile experience and what we think the future of that looks like, because I think that's every dev team that I've talked to that seemed very thoughtful about it, has some sort of approach for what the development of mobile side looks like for them. Sure.
01:27:20.868 - 01:27:47.064, Speaker A: Thank you. We're quite lucky because with Telegram, we don't have to write two sets of code. We do the main code and then it works both on your laptop and on your phone. It's tougher for you guys if you're making an app. I guess so, yeah. Good luck. But I think that, like, it's interesting because a lot of our users come from Nigeria, Indonesia, Turkey, and they use phones more than laptops.
01:27:47.064 - 01:28:15.416, Speaker A: And I think that most users in the future are going to use phones. I think we saw this transition from your big desktop computers and it's got smaller and smaller. Now there's the new iPad, which is like this thin. And going forward, I've seen a reason why users wouldn't use phones. We have been fortunate enough to have optimized four phones from the outset. I was talking to Shawn just a second ago about a new product or not. And I was saying that we can't.
01:28:15.416 - 01:28:51.582, Speaker A: We have to be so brutally careful with what we add to bunkbot to the main display because telegram is so tiny on your phone. Like, if we add loads of clips, clutter, it makes it a shit experience for you. So, yeah, so it's hard, like, with telegram, it's really hard to make it a good product with like a wealth of offerings, but also really simple and simple enough to use. But I think going forward, absolutely everyone will be using their phones. And I think even like, the chinese model with WeChat could be mirrored increasingly in other countries where I guess, yeah, the dreams. The dream of Telegram is going to be to have this all in one app. Right.
01:28:51.582 - 01:29:23.296, Speaker A: And I think that's what it will look like going forward. Absolutely. Yeah. Like, obviously, like, I mean, I just say that we are, we are building our own mobile apps right now. The cool thing about it is, like, you know, when we were thinking about it is that people think about, like, when you build mobile apps, you think about, okay, should I do react native? There's one code base supporting two platforms, stuff like that. We are like, okay, then that performance there might not be as good. Especially if you're talking about people using phones from Indonesia.
01:29:23.296 - 01:30:02.060, Speaker A: Like, a lot of these places, they don't have very powerful phone. So what we decided to do was like, okay, let's not do react native. So we're building two apps right now, Android native, iOS native, so we can make sure that the performance is there. And one thing that's very cool is that been learning a lot on the Jupyter website UI. When people are swapping on it, there are a lot of things that we feel like we can improve and drop, like just like remove it and make the experience on the app a lot faster. The whole goal of the app is that people like to say that it's a wallet, but I don't think a wallet is a Jupyter app for swapping. It should be the best.
01:30:02.060 - 01:30:18.904, Speaker A: If you just want to buy any token right now, it should be the best experience out there. There, yeah. And should be on, I mean, I want it to be on everyone phone. If you want to buy Mintoken, go for it. If you want to buy anything, just go for it. Yeah, very exciting. Yeah, very exciting.
01:30:18.904 - 01:31:32.296, Speaker A: I do want to, like, throw a little bit of appreciation towards the bonkbot product because I remember in 2021 and 2022, telegram bots trading things weren't a thing, but Telegram OTC trading groups were a thing. And I remember just, you could trade from Telegram and through a chat, but you were usually eating like 40 to 50 bps of slippage, even like, allocating towards Solana, bitcoin or ethereum. So it's very cool to have bonkbot come in and sort of take those fees away, like, you know, make them a percentage of what they were and, you know, that kind of shows just the, you know, improve the user experience and you'll grab an insane amount of users and then, yeah, as far as, like, the mobile app, we at flash, actually, we knew that the mobile user was there and they just needed the ability to have a usable app. And again, on the front end, on our web UI and also on the phone UI, we focused so much on keeping resources low. And, yeah, I think right now on Flash, we have about 40% mobile users versus, like, web users, which is pretty, pretty cool. And I remember when our mobile users started having some issues, we were reaching out to other defi teams. We had some data leak things with charts updating, and people were using two or 3gb of data in a day.
01:31:32.296 - 01:32:01.748, Speaker A: And we're like, that's unacceptable, especially for these countries that pay by the gigabyte of data. And we were reaching out to teams being like, hey, how did you fix this? And people weren't even aware that this was a data leak that was happening. It was cool to see, oh, wow. All right, the mobile user is there and we just kind of have to meet them where they are. And I think right now we have our web app. It can be accessed through a mobile interface and can be used. But obviously, yeah, like, a native app is going to be infinitely better for performance and is on a roadmap as well.
01:32:01.748 - 01:33:13.488, Speaker A: We have a few things we want to do, a few more cool things with derivatives first. But, yeah, definitely a native app is the way to go. And, like, things like bonkbot, you know, integrating with a telegram bot, always kind of a kind of fun thing to contemplate and do. So the line that you just said of meeting users where they are, and I think the three of you might have different opinions on this given the products that you're operating right now. Does that look like going to telegram discord bots, solving the security issues where there is already mainstream usage outside of the crypto native users we have today? Or do you think that does come from having superior experience on more? We were talking about with, say, Jupiter of getting things fixed on the backend for PC first and then building out iOS versions as well. Sorry, you're asking where the next group of users are from? Yeah. Do you think, I guess mobile native experience, do you see them going more to the kind of messenger apps where there already is mainstream usage outside of trading, or do you see it being more of they come to you at the app level specifically to use your product? I think everywhere, like Telegram.
01:33:13.488 - 01:33:32.544, Speaker A: I mean, Bong Bong is a good example. I mean, the website is a good example. But for us, the bet, the big bet is on the, on the mobile apps. Yeah. I think for a protocol like Jupiter, it makes sense. Like they are the front. Like if you need to do something on in Solana, you go to Jupiter and you trade and you can trade just about anything.
01:33:32.544 - 01:34:13.044, Speaker A: You can, can do the limit orders, dcas. So I think going with an app first approach makes total sense for us. We are a bit more of a focused product and so we kind of like. I think it's very engaging to trade, especially perps on high leverage with a very satisfying user interface. And so I think on an app makes a lot of sense, but at the same time, it's pretty easy to say the trade you want in a few lines. Again, I recall the days of the OTC trades, telegram groups, where it'd be like, buy Solana at 145. This amount of leverage, here's a collateral, here's the address, and it'd be all abbreviations and it'd be maybe 25 to 30 characters at most.
01:34:13.044 - 01:35:05.850, Speaker A: So high leverage trading can be possible through just telegram apps. But I think for the retail user, there's just something about having fast performant app showing you the graph showing your p and l, allowing you to manage collateral very easily, allowing you to open and close positions across different markets, and, you know, if possible, cross margining, all those things. So I think it's very important to kind of, again, make it easy for the user and sort of, like we said, meet them where they're at and what they really want to experience. Yeah, I feel as though Jupiter is one of the most famous products in crypto. One of the best products in crypto, at least one of my favorites. And I think that given that, it's probably easier for you guys to have an app and then gain real users on your app. I think that if you're a new product starting out, it's probably quite hard to create an app and get users.
01:35:05.850 - 01:35:42.466, Speaker A: We've always optimized for minimum friction for the user. So it's something like Telegram, where they already have an account, and it's very easy to just add funds to your wallet. If we'd started with an app, we probably wouldn't have done well, to be honest. But now that you're in this situation, it's excellent, and it probably will offer you a higher level of ux to your users because of how you can customize it and make it just insanely designed just for your users. So it's an awesome situation to be in. Talking about derivatives a little bit more. We started talking about this on the idea of meme coin perps and kind of the restrictions there at present, looking a little bit forward.
01:35:42.466 - 01:36:15.634, Speaker A: This is the future of trading on Solana, I guess, for the new, this panel. Right. So let's talk about the future. There's been so much interest specific to perpetual futures. Do we see new derivatives products coming up? Where do we see the interest shifting? And, like, what does the future of derivatives trading on Solana look like more specifically? Because I think there is definitely a lot of attraction from retail and the idea of leverage, obviously trade responsibly. But we've seen a lot of interesting there in the past, and I assume that we're going to see that interest continue in more. So I'll take the first bit of this.
01:36:15.634 - 01:36:49.910, Speaker A: I think as a product for traders, perpetuals is unmatched. There have been multiple people that try to bring options or even more exotic things we see maybe on nfts, it makes a little sense with tensors, price locks, and all this on liquid tokens. Perpetuals as a product is just super easy to understand for users. You don't have to worry about expiry dates, non linear equity curves. It's just I have leverage. If price goes up 10% and I'm on ten x, I'm up 100%, it's like the math is easy to get. So I think, on the trading side, perpetuals are here to stay.
01:36:49.910 - 01:37:25.082, Speaker A: I think on what you are trading against, that's where a lot of innovation can happen. So we like, for flash and, and Jupiter, we have our FLP and they have their JLP. That's a pool of capital filled with, like, money of the community. It's not like some market maker. It's just gonna siphon off the money for the community. That's community money that is getting to have the fruits of their labor, so to speak, and like, getting the yield that they deserve and earn for, you know, being participating in the innovative side of defi. And the cool thing is that these pools of capital technically could be made out of anything.
01:37:25.082 - 01:37:52.094, Speaker A: So right now, we're just asset backed. Bitcoin long is backed by bitcoin on chain. There you go. LP's take very little risk in that, but technically you could back them by anything if you wanted. I don't know. There's a lot of people out there that love holding gold, but they want a source of yield. You could theoretically back any kind of trade versus a pool of gold, and they still have their exposure to gold, but get this additional yield on top of it from all the purpose trading happening.
01:37:52.094 - 01:38:34.538, Speaker A: So I think there's a lot of innovation to be had in sort of backing perpetual trading, which traders love with all sorts of assets, depending on what LP's want exposure to and as well as, like, what level of risk they want. Like, perhaps maybe they don't want people trading at ten x leverage against them. Perhaps they only want, like, okay, we'll do three x because we're afraid of, you know, if bitcoin wounds against gold, we're going to lose a lot of money in that scenario. So, yeah, I think that's, like, where a lot of playing and innovating can happen, especially when we have a lot of crypto native assets, like lsts, nfts, all these different things that, you know, people just hold in their wallets. Like, we can put those to use. That's a lot of dormant capital that merely sits. I mean, I mean, that's actually very good point.
01:38:34.538 - 01:39:12.474, Speaker A: Right? The way I think about this is that I feel like at the beginning of Solana is like, you know, Nasdaq for, like, on chain and stuff like that. It's a very cool idea, but sometimes, if you really think about it, it doesn't really make sense in some way. You have centralized exchanges running all these open books and whatnot. I mean, audible. Does it really make sense to bring order book on chain? You know what I mean? The very cool thing about GMX is that they came up with this JLP back, same thing we are doing on GLP FLP is that, like, it's a very. It's a. It's a.
01:39:12.474 - 01:40:07.152, Speaker A: It's a very new, like, paradigm for people to trade on chain. Like, you don't have to start. You don't have to start worrying about, like, market makers like, you know, all these like typical traditional finance stuff that people have to worry about. Like now you have like a bunch of djen on the other side, a bunch of degeneres on the other side to make sure that they can do all this thing together, right? I think that's like the coolest part about all this new trading paradigms that coming out on chain instead of all these boring audible, you need buy, sell, whatever, whatever. Yeah, I guess derivatives on bonkbot. Do you guys want leverage on your meme coins? Anyone? No? So this guy here does, he wants 100 x leverage on some meme coins? I'm not sure. Maybe someday.
01:40:07.152 - 01:40:31.364, Speaker A: It's not on our roadmap, to be clear, but it'd be fun to do, you know, like open up ten x leverage on some ten k market cap coin. Right to gen wealth. So. So yeah, that's my perspective. No rush to do leverage of meme coins, but it could be something cool for you, for you guys, for sure. I think what I'm really excited about is backing perpetual trades on anything. But the backing capital is meme coins.
01:40:31.364 - 01:41:10.224, Speaker A: So any community could have, like if they want exposure to their bong or to their Wif and they don't really want to have USDC in their pool. Theoretically you can back trades against the pool of meme coins and, you know, traders are going to get their p and L. You can abstract the whole, the fact that they're getting paid in the meme coin or losing in the meme coin away by just like swapping with Jupiter really quick. Just integrate that API. But at least traders know that their p and l is backed by liquid market and the meme coin people will now have a source of yield for their meme coin instead of just yelling on telegram buys and sells that are happening the last five minutes. Never seen that before. I guess I don't participate.
01:41:10.224 - 01:41:56.604, Speaker A: I want to make sure we give time for all three of you to talk about the future specific to your platform slash trade. Jupyter bonkbot. Lots of users in the audience, so just want to wrap with each of you going through any alpha that you can give for the people. We have such a big crowd out here today, which is super exciting to see what's coming next that you're most excited about for your platforms. And we'll start with Flash trade. Sure. As you can imagine, I'm already alluding a little bit to backing those pools of capital, being backed by anything, I think first and the most exciting, or maybe not most exciting, but that makes the most sense is there's a lot of protocols bringing RWA assets, you know, real estate, stocks, gold, what have you, on chain, but then there's nothing to do with them on chain.
01:41:56.604 - 01:42:50.164, Speaker A: You can maybe trade on order, book, hooray, whatever. We've created a worse version of centralized exchanges, but you can create pools of capital and sort of spin up the sort of GMX model, Jupiter and I guess Flash's model on top of all these different assets and that, you know, now you have liquid derivatives that are fun to trade, and you can offer quite a bit of leverage, because when trades are asset backed, the leverage considerations for LP's, it just goes a lot easier. So I would say that's what I'm most excited about. I mean, yeah, like, we are still, like I mentioned earlier, like, mobile apps, like, make it easy to do, a lot easier to trade, create new tokens. We are launching a new, not DCA, like a value averaging as well. That's one of the product. Yeah, I guess I'd like to start, actually by saying thank you if you're a bonkbot user.
01:42:50.164 - 01:43:12.624, Speaker A: We launched in August of last year and nothing happened basically until November. Zero users. So it's really been like six, seven months of Ponkpot actually having users. So thank you. It does mean a lot to us in terms of what's next. We have been saying limit orders for quite some time now. They are coming.
01:43:12.624 - 01:43:43.328, Speaker A: They may be coming with some special help from the Jupiter team. But, yeah, limit order is coming very soon. We're working on a sniper, which I think is quite important increasingly. And we also want to integrate every Dex, basically, on Solana. My friend from Orca is in the front row. We want some orca integration and flux beam for token 2022 and SPL 404. Can I actually get a show of hands if you've heard of SPL 404? Okay.
01:43:43.328 - 01:44:09.190, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Yeah, so it's like a new token standard. And I won't bore you guys now, but it's like you have coins and they can become nfts and they can be interchanged. And so we're also planning on integrating that. So, yeah, basically just integrating everything possible, keeping bonkbot really, really fast for you guys, and adding essential new features. All right, we do have a couple minutes. I had one last question from someone prior to this around governance and the governance of all these platforms.
01:44:09.190 - 01:44:42.934, Speaker A: Right. I think generally, if you talk to a lot of different teams and the idea of progressive decentralization of platforms going to a Dao model, I know Jupiter's thought on this a bit. We'd love to hear from all of you, but maybe we start with Seung on where Jupiter is going in terms of dao structure, governance, etcetera. So we have the vote Jup ag right now. It's actually one of the most active Dao, I think, across all chains. It's like the last word has like, what, 250,000 like participants. I mean, 250 million took of juke token being staked.
01:44:42.934 - 01:45:27.526, Speaker A: I think it was like 200, 5300 thousand people voted or something like that. It's actually very interesting to see people who are so excited about it, but at the same time, it's also quite overwhelming to manage the community as well. I mean, cash was here before. We run this weekly Wednesday, like Dao community engagement stuff. It's actually very fun to do in the sense that we have sometimes a couple thousand people show up just to listen to new updates on Jupiter. What are the things they can vote on and stuff like that. A lot of teams reach out and ask us, can you open source the UI for other people to use as well? That's actually one thing that we are working on right now.
01:45:27.526 - 01:45:59.564, Speaker A: Actually, all the programs are open source. Anyone can use it, but the UI is not. That's one thing that I'm trying to get the team to extract out from our current repo and make sure that people can start hosting it on their end as well. Yeah, I think it's interesting. So, Flash, there's still a bit protocol, still no token, so therefore decisions are being made by us. I think I will point out there's a lot of cool alternatives. I think Jupiter's exploring meta with utarchy is exploring something cool as well.
01:45:59.564 - 01:46:52.084, Speaker A: I think the most interesting is sort of deciding what decisions go to what level of governance. So Jupiter just had their risk metrics and parameters from gauntlet and chaos labs. I'm not sure you want to set up that discussion in public on a discord where the entire community says, well, what should our margin rate be? So I think those decisions have to come in a more complete form before being put up for governance. But again, these are just decisions of like kind of. If we look at how governance works in the real world with governments, you know, there are stages to it, and I think we're all experimenting with what stages go where. And then finally, like, what do we use to make the final decision? And there's a lot of cool experiments and, you know, when flash has a token there, it'll be interesting to say which one we go with, which one we think is best. I hear some alpha there.
01:46:52.084 - 01:47:06.442, Speaker A: Yeah, well, bonk bought governance. I'm not sure we're the best people to answer this question. To be honest, I'm not sure how much governance is involved. So we. Our token is Bonk. The ticker is bonk. We.
01:47:06.442 - 01:47:23.142, Speaker A: Well, in fact, all fees buy back and burn. Bonk. I'm not sure if you guys knew this. All fees do buy. No, sorry, all fees buy bonk and then some, and then 10% buy back and burn. But all fees do get converted into bonk, which is a fair amount of money. And we, we care about Bonk a lot.
01:47:23.142 - 01:47:39.830, Speaker A: We think that bonk did a lot of good things for Solana. So we're Bonker lined. But, yeah, that's the most governance I guess we have. There is no be bot token coming, I'm afraid. Or is there? No, there's. No, there's not for now. Wow.
01:47:39.830 - 01:47:57.424, Speaker A: What a point to stop on. All right, well, from the sounds of things, I'd say, and I think we can all probably agree from this is the future of trading on Solana is quite bright. So thank you so much to all of our speakers. Thank you to everyone for listening, and we will leave you to the rest of this great conference. Thanks, everyone. Thank you. Thank you.
01:47:57.424 - 01:49:29.546, Speaker A: How are we doing? Good. So we have two more sessions before lunch break and I see more and more people and I could not make my way to the coffee stand in ten minutes. So next in line, we have the co founder and CEO of Birdeye, which has swiftly risen to be the go to platform for traders seeking real time market intelligence, robust analytics and invaluable strategic guidance. Please, with a big round of applause, welcome on stage Ka Nguyen, for our chat fireside, moderated by Mia Grodsky. Hello, everybody. It's so great to be here. And kaa, thank you for coming.
01:49:29.546 - 01:49:45.386, Speaker A: Thank you for having me. Yeah, this is incredible. It is amazing. So many smiling faces. So we're going to continue this trading conversation and we're going to talk a bit about bird Eye. Just a show of hands. Who here has heard of bird Eye? Raise your hand.
01:49:45.386 - 01:50:21.142, Speaker A: And who uses bird eye? Amazing. I think all of those hands stayed in the air. So for those who haven't heard of bird eye yet, ka, maybe you can give us just kind of an overview of the product, what you've built and maybe why you built it. For sure. For sure. So Bodai in general is an aggregator, like trading, data aggregator. So we provide a tool called bodai, so you can check that out after this so we provide them the most comprehensive and accurate real time trading data for all the traders.
01:50:21.142 - 01:51:02.056, Speaker A: We started with Solana blockchain, but now we're on solo support, ten other blockchains as well, including all the EVMs and some other non EVM blockchains. But then Solana is still our major audience. So we provide trading data to retail traders, to professional traders, and to some institutional as well. So, yeah, it is a trading data company and provide all that. Okay. And so maybe you can walk us through the journey of an average trader on Birdeye. So let's say this is a person who, they hold tokens, they experiment on different l one s, but they haven't fully gone off the deep end yet.
01:51:02.056 - 01:51:43.622, Speaker A: So how is that person using Birdeye? Where are they going and what are the phases that they go through when using the platform? Absolutely, absolutely. Just before that, I just want to ask anybody here is trading meme coins in the last few months. Can you raise your hand, please? Wow. Okay, okay. Okay. We have a number of people, but then just in my experience, on average, people gonna go through different phases when they are trading any typical assets, right. There will be exploration phase where people looking for the assets, and then there's analytics phase where people actually looking at all the numbers and check on the charts and to making the decisions.
01:51:43.622 - 01:52:43.194, Speaker A: And then the third phase is the trade executions, where they actually press the button, buy or sell. So at BDAI, we really focus on the first two phases, where actually we can help people to explore the new opportunities. And then we provide all the analytics, all the numbers that they can actually evaluate whether that asset is a good buy or is that not a good buy? And then for the trade execution, we integrated with our third party partners like Jupiter and some other Dexs as well. But we are really focused on the first two phase where we can help the traders to make better decisions. Because, you know, typical meme core traders, they tend to skip the second step, which is analytics. They just explore, okay, I see the tokens and then they jump into to trade execution. But then still, I mean, there's like the whole steps that we want to support traders in a sense.
01:52:43.194 - 01:53:13.454, Speaker A: And so maybe, like, who are the users of bird eye? Could you break up your audience a bit? We kind of just talked about, like, the average trader. Who else is on there using the product regularly. Yeah. So bird eye has been going live for over two years now. We started off the late 2021, and then we go live at about the middle of 2022. And so far we are serving over 20 million users, most of them coming from Solana. So thank you very much.
01:53:13.454 - 01:53:53.280, Speaker A: And that is only the users going into the website. But I. So which are like most of them are retail traders. But then we also have a different product line where we providing, supplying data to some protocols and to some individuals who want to trading more sophisticatedly. So they're coding trading board, they are putting our data into their algorithm and to do the trade automatically. And that one is also very big as well, in volume. So I think maybe you don't really know that you are using our products.
01:53:53.280 - 01:54:57.134, Speaker A: But then if you actually take a look, if you look at the price of any meme tokens, especially the very, very fresh tokens anywhere in the ecosystem, in the wallets, in the Dexs, in the telegram, trading bots, that data probably come from bodai, like from different routes, but then we supply the trading data to many, many partners in the ecosystem. So yeah, we have that type of users, retail traders, professional traders, institutional and some protocols as well. Some projects on Solana, they're also using our data. So let's go a bit deeper into retail traders. So they're going on bird eye. What are they looking at when they're using the platform? They're looking at tokens. What are some of the red flags that are making them not go into something? And then what are also some of the green flags? And this is insights that they're gaining from Birdeye for retail? Yes, sure.
01:54:57.134 - 01:55:46.850, Speaker A: So there are a couple of things that people are looking at, as I said before, about the three phases that average traders want to go through. Explorations, analytics and then traders executions. So in the first two phases, the explorations, right, we have something called the trending list, which is being very popular among all the Solana traders. So it is being updated real time. We have a very sophisticated algorithm that we want to filter many thousands of tokens and then we result in the top hundred and then the top ten, top 20, top 100. So that is one of the major exploration tools for our traders. And then in the analytics, we have also the whole range of tools as well.
01:55:46.850 - 01:56:41.364, Speaker A: And many besides the token details pitch itself. So this is where you actually going in and then check for the candle charts, check for the price, but then many traders going to check for the traders themselves. Like check for. Okay, what are the other traders it's doing? What are the assets that the Wales is buying and those kind of stuff. So those are, we have two page called fivegems and Trader profile which are very being visited a lot in any single moment. We have like thousands people visiting that one and they are looking forward to what other people are buying. And how is that token performing? Okay, and so I know your team, you've been very busy.
01:56:41.364 - 01:57:45.754, Speaker A: You've been shipping a lot. And for these retail traders specifically, what are some of the tools or features that you've put on the platform that in your opinion aren't being used, utilized yet? Like what are people missing? Yes. So we have been working on a lot on the tools and there are some very tools that we spent a lot of time working on. But then when we look at all the numbers of people, whether or not people are using it, we figure out that not many people actually discover that tools. So for example, we have something called alerts, right? It's where you can actually put on all the conditions to see whether or not a token actually meet your conditions, to be flagged as should be buying, should buy or should sell. You can actually put on the technical analysis, something like to draw some charts and stuff. And then when the token's price meet that conditions, you will receive a notification through telegraph or discord or to your email.
01:57:45.754 - 01:58:27.842, Speaker A: And we're seeing some users using that thing and they can make pretty good profits. But then that one is a bit technical. So this is why it is not being used by the mass. But then if you guys can spend a little bit of time and take a look at our alerts functions, then that could be something pretty good. It can generate pretty good profits. Okay, so we kind of talked about the average trader. We talked a little bit about retail traders, how about professional traders? And specifically wanted to ask about the data APIs that Birdeye provides for those traders to spot potentially hot tokens.
01:58:27.842 - 02:00:01.784, Speaker A: Yeah, we provide quite a lot type of APIs where we supply the real time trading data to many projects and professional traders as well. We have some people actually using that one and post it on social media, on Twitter, like how he actually used that data to coding the trading boards and how he actually using that bot to make some profits. And I think his tutorial is incredible. And I think currently if you are trying to automate your trading journey, it's like you figure out one algorithm that you think that it works, then we are very happy to provide the data for you so that you can put it into your workflow and then you trading that one and actually put that into work. And if you can, you know, share that, share some of that information to the community, then that would be awesome as well. Yeah, but currently we have, we're providing data I think to thousands of people, thousands of people are coding, you know, personally using that one because, you know, trading, if you do it, you know, long enough, deep enough, then you actually can automate some part of it. Okay, so I guess we've talked about traders.
02:00:01.784 - 02:00:29.476, Speaker A: Now on the other side, let's talk a little bit about the teams and the projects that are actually launching tokens. And the title of this talk was kind of spotting the hottest token launch. I guess just looking at the audience, has anyone in the last year launched a token? Anyone? Nice. Okay, I see one hand. And is anyone planning a token launch for the next maybe six months? A couple? Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, nice.
02:00:29.476 - 02:01:19.292, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Even more hands came up. So let's talk about the different facets of launching a token and how to avoid some of those red flags and what the team needs to do to not necessarily appeal to the community, but to have this, you know, professional sort of attributes as they're launching. What should they avoid? Which things do they need to make sure they've done and how do they have a successful launch? Yes. So I think one of the things that we should notice is that in Solana we have a lot of tools that already automate a lot of token issuance. I think on some other EVM blockchains, the developer actually have to deploy the smart contract and have to do a lot of technical works.
02:01:19.292 - 02:02:19.964, Speaker A: But on Solana it is like there's a lot of tools that can actually help you to do it automatically. And I think Jupyter, they're having the launch part as well. So that could be a very good tool. So the part where you actually, the technical part is actually being taken care of already. Right. So the other part that you need to take care of is about the social part where you actually need to build up the trust. And one of the things that on Bodi we have something like called security measure, and in that one we want to take a look at on the on chain information, whether or not that token is being, the ownership is being renounced or something like whether or not it attacks people when they buy or sell it, or something like whether or not that token can, the token information can be changed.
02:02:19.964 - 02:03:29.974, Speaker A: So later on, for example, some people just decide that, okay, I can change token name or something. So we have all of that in place already. So if you are launching a token, I think, for example, meme tokens, then you should make sure that you're going to have all that checkbox in checkout, you renounce the ownership, you maybe don't really tax it too high or something like that, because if you tax it too high then we're going to label it. These tokens had a very high tax and something like the token owners holding too much tokens in the supply or stuff like that. So all the on chain information, we will try our best to give as much information as possible to the traders so that they can get to know that at least. Okay, technically this token is safe or not. And then the other part is, is of course on the social part where, you know, you give it the information on your discord, on Telegram, on X where you know, you gather your audience.
02:03:29.974 - 02:04:54.264, Speaker A: And that one, that is for the meme coins, but then for some other, you know, more major protocols that they are, you know, farming the points and then they issue the tokens, then you are very welcome to work working with us. You know, we can have labeling on the wallets and stuff so that you can actually let your community know that, okay, these wallets, although it holds a lot of token, but it's actually being locked or it is actually belong to the team and it will be removed from the circulating supply. So we have a lot of things, you know, automatic mechanism and also make manual mechanism where we can support on their projects so that they can have a better launch. And so do you have any sort of examples or case studies of maybe a very unknown or new project that launched a token recently? And to you it was a very good blueprint of how to approach it, either from the community aspect. Is there any sort of project or token that comes to mind where you're like wow, that was unexpected, I did not anticipate that. And then you saw all the traction. Anyone that comes to mind or a couple ones that come to mind? Well, I mean like there are many good meme cards, right? I don't think I can tell any names, but then I think many meme coins, you can ask these questions.
02:04:54.264 - 02:05:45.908, Speaker A: I think many of you can ask Ansem, I think he's around here. Yeah, we'll ask him later. But then from outside, I think all the tokens that actually got into what I trending list is actually pretty safe to do. Some of them are not. But then of course you do your own research. But then from ourselves we are checking all the data technically automatically. Then on the good one, then if our system thing that is, it's a good one and we're going to put it in the channel list popularity, we consider a lot of things like on the liquidity popularity, number of people actually buying it, number of people actually selling it, number of actually unique traders, stuff like that.
02:05:45.908 - 02:07:04.002, Speaker A: I mean, we consider quite a lot of stuff, so a few dozens of factors. So I think it's a pretty good list. Okay, so you're all about helping people, helping traders sort of spot the next hottest token launch. What are some things you're working on in the platform right now that you can kind of maybe tease a little bit to get people excited about using it? Yeah, well, we are working on quite a number of new features, but I think one of the things that we have been spent sometimes on is, well, some statistically we have about 60% of Berda users accessing the website through their mobile device. So we have decided that we also need to have a mobile app, which is a very natural thing to do. But there are some challenge because when you will move from the giant screen like this one, any typical traders going to have, some of them have even have few screens so that they can consider more numbers and charts. And then we have to reduce it into this size.
02:07:04.002 - 02:08:13.084, Speaker A: So what kind of data, what kind of arrangement we have to put into the one so that we still keep the on the trading experience, on the analytics experience the same or more or less the same, or maybe at some point it can get even better, then that is a serious consideration and we need to spend quite a lot of time into that one and we are working on that already. You can expect it to have some mobile app from us about one or two months from now. And that one can be very optimized. If you want to receive instant signals because it's mobile, you bring it everywhere with you. So we really focus on providing you the real time data. And as I said before, on the alerts and all the signals that we can get, we're going to just push the notification to our users so that way you can make the decision much faster. And if you don't use that, then probably the signal is going to reach you a little bit slower and then it makes your trading a little bit less effective.
02:08:13.084 - 02:08:48.604, Speaker A: So I think that would be something that's something that we spend quite a lot of time thinking and working on. And yeah, I think it will be a major upgrade in terms of user experience. And when can we expect to see the mobile app? In about one or two months, depending on the testing process. But then, yeah, we're working on that. Okay. And are there any features on the mobile version that will be, you know, different from the browser? Yes, as I said, we want to have a lot of notifications stuff. We want to be very optimized for that purpose.
02:08:48.604 - 02:09:34.564, Speaker A: So you can actually, the whole idea is to. The mobile device is actually a light version of the website, browser version. So you can actually go into the browser version. You make a very sophisticated conditions where you want to receive the notifications. And then when all those conditions are met, you're going to receive the notifications on your mobile. So whenever you are going out or you are having a dinner, then you receive a notification and you can actually go into the app and to make decisions, like to buy or to sell something. So the whole idea is to make the whole trading journey become more efficient.
02:09:34.564 - 02:10:17.062, Speaker A: Okay, very cool. Well, I can't wait to try out the mobile version. And is it, I guess you turn on the notifications or do you kind of, like, choose specific tokens for those? So there will be conditions, right. So you can choose, okay, I want to receive notifications on this very specific tokens. For example, like bonk. If, for example, bonk price cross this number, then I will receive a notification. Or if it's more sophisticated, then if the RSI cross, like, like a certain threshold, I will receive a notification.
02:10:17.062 - 02:10:55.906, Speaker A: Or maybe when its price gonna go above the average, the industry average, then I will receive notifications. Or if some new tokens get into the training list, I got notifications. So you can be actually very creative on how you receive that one. And then you're gonna receive, I think it's being very custom. So you're gonna be the owners of what kind of information do you wanna receive? And I mean, that's really cool, too, because it's not just Solana that you have data for if you're trading across, you know, different ecosystems. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
02:10:55.906 - 02:11:15.910, Speaker A: This can be the one place you have and have your notifications on. So wherever you're trading, you're getting that information. Yeah. So our goal is. Yeah, of course. Solana, I think, is a very cool place. And a lot of liquidity will eventually flow into Solana, but then some other chains also have some other cool tokens as well.
02:11:15.910 - 02:12:29.554, Speaker A: So our goal is to have a, being an one stop shop where you can actually getting the data on the signals from as many places as possible. So crypto wise, I think you mentioned this at the beginning. Beginning just kind of like the, you know, where people are actually looking on the website, but are most of the people using bird eye look, using it to look at Solana tokens or what is kind of the breakdown of some of the ecosystems? So Solana has been our very, very first blockchain that we have been working on and we still being the pioneer on integrating on the data from Solana projects until now. And then many of our users coming from solar na, but then we also have an increasing number of people joining from some other blockchains as well. And when they go into bodi, then they're going to take a look at the landscape of all the blockchains and many of them being converted into Okip file. These Solana tokens is very cool, so they actually convert it into Solana users, which is very cool things. I love the name, too.
02:12:29.554 - 02:13:24.172, Speaker A: I think bird eye is a perfect almost description of what the product is. It's giving you this bird's eye view of everything. And then to have that on your phone, in your pocket and getting notifications, I think it's even getting deeper into the bird's eye view. Cool. So we have a couple of minutes left, maybe, again, kind of just discussing like maybe more newcomers, people coming to bird eye, using it for the first time. Like, what is your advice for people that are really hunting for the next token that's going to pop off? If there's like one or two things you would tell people or advise people to look at, what would those two things be? Well, I think if you are, I think many people in the room are pretty new to crypto and to Solanaz specifically. So I think if you go into bird eye, you're going to see a lot of information.
02:13:24.172 - 02:14:24.354, Speaker A: Actually, sometimes it is too much information for a beginner. But then I would suggest that you go through some of the lists that we have over there. We have some the trending list, which is being updated every minute or few seconds. So that really give you some sense of how the market is actually moving. And you can go into, also go to our five gems page. It's where you can actually browse through, like you can swim through the oceans of all the tokens, you can actually sorting it using on the liquidity, the volumes, the market cap. So you can actually have a sense of what are the biggest tokens, what are the most active tokens, what are the tokens that a lot of people are buying, what are the tokens that a lot of people are actually watching it and to wait for the signals.
02:14:24.354 - 02:15:10.782, Speaker A: So it could give you a lot of insights. And under the hood, we are also actually working on something else as well. So we realized that a lot of users want to have a more simple version with less information, with some more simple insights. Because currently, but I probably provide, as I said too much information for a beginner. So we are thinking of having version where just like providing some essential information so that you can, you don't get, you know, too confused about everything. But then it could be something we can look forward to. Very cool.
02:15:10.782 - 02:15:41.290, Speaker A: Well, thank you so much. Ka. Thanks for being here and sharing about Birdeye and anyone who hasn't checked it out yet. Oh, one more thing that the final thing I can tell you is that we have a page called rewards. It's where our users getting rewards from our partners. Many people asking when we have itokens, but we still haven't really had that plan. But then we do have a lot of plans to reward our users, especially loyal users.
02:15:41.290 - 02:16:28.636, Speaker A: So we have this page called rewards where you can actually go into that one and take a look. We are working with a lot of partners who want to distribute their tokens or want to give away some part of their profits. And then boda users can actually register to receive some of that and we will have a lucky draw so that some people getting one $2,000 as the rewards. And there are more and more partners working with us to do that. So I would suggest you to go to check that out. Probably you're going to get lucky and then get some cool rewards from that. I love that.
02:16:28.636 - 02:16:40.124, Speaker A: Yeah. Anyone who's been using it, make sure you check out your rewards. And yeah, you might be lucky. Great. Well, thank you so much. This was great. And everyone, make sure you check out bird eye if you haven't already yet.
02:16:40.124 - 02:17:42.424, Speaker A: Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thanks a lot, Ka and Mia for the great talk. So we have one last break. I have a quick advice and maybe we can keep quiet at the back for the rest of the event. Thank you very much. Now we have our next panel discussion exploring Solana's integration into the broader crypto ecosystem, highlighting partnership and innovations driving its growth.
02:17:42.424 - 02:18:52.973, Speaker A: Please give a big round of applause again. Formo Elahi from Mayan Finance, Nico Chapeller from Arkium, and Camilla Russo, the founder of the Defiant. Thank you. Hi, everyone. So excited to be here. And hi to Mo and Nico. Great to be moderating this panel with you guys.
02:18:52.973 - 02:20:03.544, Speaker A: So we're talking about connecting Solana to the rest of crypto. And this topic implies a future where users are spread out across dapps in many different blockchains rather than using mainly one blockchain first to set the stage. Do you guys agree that's how things will ultimately play out? Okay, first of all, hi, everyone, I'm Mo and thanks for having me here. So, yeah, like, I have a kind of hot take about this topic. I think, like, in the ideal world, you don't need many blockchains. You just need one state machine that gets synchronized in a stop second across the world. And since this machine is turing complete, you basically can run everything on it, right? So, and having multiple of these machines, it just reduce the network effect.
02:20:03.544 - 02:20:59.124, Speaker A: So I would say it would be best if we only have one, like, blockchain. But the reason that we in future, it's not going to be like one blockchain is because of the obvious economic reasons. And it's a good thing. Like, if we only had Solana and there was no competitor, there was no rush for getting Solana better. So, yeah. Do you agree, Nico? Yeah, for sure. I mean, the way I view it is that generally speaking, you know, if you look at the biggest products on Solana today, for example, Jupiter, what it takes care of is aggregating and abstracting away from which blockchain, or rather in this case, which Dex or protocol you want to use and just ask you basically what do you want to do? And then it does the thing for you without you having to tell it on top.
02:20:59.124 - 02:21:50.204, Speaker A: And I think the same applies for a multi chain future. In the future, I think people, generally speaking, especially more normie users to some extent, don't really want to worry. Okay, what's the best blockchain for this specific thing that I want to do? Rather, they want to have the same experience as in Tradfi where they just tell some sort of engine or something. Okay, I want to swap this token or I want to send money. Please figure out for me what's the best infrastructure for this. And along the lines of offering a UX that's similar to tradfi in the good ways, of course, is, in my opinion, on one hand intense and on the other hand, privacy, which is just quick tangent, why we're building Archium, because we think if you're a normal user, you don't want all your trace to be publicly visible and you don't want to tell every last detail of what action you want to take to the blockchain. Rather, you just want it to happen.
02:21:50.204 - 02:23:05.354, Speaker A: Okay, so in general, I think we agree that in the future we'll probably see maybe a handful of blockchains, maybe not hundreds or even dozens, but, you know, maybe ten or so, ten or less. And then. But users won't even think about this, right? Like, I think ideally what we want to see is people just choosing the Dapp that is best for whatever use case they're looking at, and that the thing just works and you don't have to care about which network it's on. So what technologies are enabling this sort of experience today? Yeah. So to dial down on Nico's take, like, the intent based protocols are the future of how we interact with blockchains. It abstracts away the details of how to interact with blockchains. The need for gas, the need to submit transactions and land transactions.
02:23:05.354 - 02:23:48.096, Speaker A: They all going to get abstracted away by intent. Intents. And we already have like multi chain wallets that help users to move fonts to interact with different dapps on different blockchains. We just need one more step of having these intent based protocols in place to basically remove the friction for users. When you say intent based, you're talking about saying, okay, the thing I care about is say swapping tokens. Yes, exactly. I don't care where it happens.
02:23:48.096 - 02:24:33.976, Speaker A: I just want to swap these two tokens and then the protocol will, I don't know, like route my transactions to where it makes sense. Yes. The example that I mentioned a lot when I want to explain is how Uber works. Like, when you want to get an Uber, you just specify that I want to go from this source source to this destination. You don't specify how I want to go, you just specify the requirements and the driver drives you from the source to the destination. This is basically intent based thing. The same thing should happen on blockchain.
02:24:33.976 - 02:25:08.624, Speaker A: Whenever you want to move from Ethereum to Solana, you just specify that I want to do this thing and this thing magically happens. And that's intent based protocols. Right. And then the UX to do that with would probably be a wallet. Right? Like, yes. Well, let's play a key role because it's the entry point where user sign the intent and basically say that I want to do this and it gets executed. Right.
02:25:08.624 - 02:26:23.036, Speaker A: Nico, what do you think? Are the enablers for this just seamless cross chain future to happen? Yeah, so of course, intent based bridging or intent based architectures in general are huge. Definitely agree with Mo on that. But just something that's a little bit different that I think is also very important is you touched upon earlier that in the future there's probably not going to be 1000 chains or something, but maybe a handful. And those will take care of probably 80% of the use cases or maybe even 99% or what it may be. However, for that to happen, I think off chain chain agnostic infrastructure is really important. And let me explain what I mean by that because generally speaking, if you go on Coinmarketcap or something today, or Birdeye, for example, you'll see there's thousands, maybe tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of different tokens and of different chains. And the reason for this is because up until recently and still today, to some extent, whenever someone has a new use case that they want to do with the blockchain, be that they need it to be very fast, like Solana, or they want it to be very cheap, or they want it to be optimized for gaming, whatever, they said, oh, okay, let me create a new chain just for this, which is how we ended up in the state that we are today.
02:26:23.036 - 02:27:28.344, Speaker A: However, I think the future is more along the lines of saying, okay, let's use verifiable compute to basically compute something off chain and then post this on chain, and then basically prove, using cryptography, that we can say whatever we computed off chain here is the correct result, and it wasn't cheated in some manner or something like this. And through that, we can really give, to some extent, superpowers to existing chains by computing things that they normally wouldn't be able to compute, but using cryptography, still being able to make those use cases happen on existing chains. So I think leaning more into that is important as well, because otherwise, intent based things are just going to be quite difficult to build. Correct me if I'm wrong, if there's just so many different chains that you need to integrate each of them separately. I think this architecture of saying we give existing chains more abilities has more potential. Sorry, but will off chain compute have the potential of centralizing web3? Not directly, no. That's what I was talking about with cryptography.
02:27:28.344 - 02:28:23.506, Speaker A: Case of Arkham. What we do, essentially, with Arkham, what we want to do is we want to offer privacy, or rather private shared state so you can have an encrypted, decentralized exchange, for example, on a decentralized blockchain on Solana. The problem is, if we would want to build that with a normal Solana smart contract, we would not be able to do it, because to do this, we need sorts of cryptographic primitives, such as zero notch proofs, but in our case, multiparty computation. And Solana doesn't support executing these cryptographic primitives. And so what we basically do is we say, let's execute this off chain. And then we can use special types of cryptography to generate kind of like proofs or other ways that you can prove fault or prove correct execution. And then all we do is we post the result, and we post the proof on chain so that anyone can see, okay, this is the result, and this is a cryptographic proof that this result is actually what I expect that was computed correctly.
02:28:23.506 - 02:29:12.230, Speaker A: So, in that sense, anyone can execute this more difficult or computation that isn't normally supported by blockchain off chain. But you can be still sure that this person isn't cheating or abusing their power by just verifying that the proof that was posted along with that data is actually verifies. Got it. Okay, so that has a potential to give the ability to execute very maybe complex tabs or use cases to any blockchain. So a blockchain doesn't necessarily have to support smart contracts. They can use this off chain computational system to do that. Is that the idea? Precisely.
02:29:12.230 - 02:30:28.084, Speaker A: Like, it doesn't even have to be something super complex, because, for example, if you look at Solana, initially, they didn't support verifying zero notch proofs, and soon they finally will. But it's been a process that takes quite long, of course, because it's a big feature to implement. And so, for that reason, if for every small thing that Solana doesn't currently support, we would go to the Solana core team and tell them, please add this, they'd be flooded with requests, and they wouldn't be able to support everything. Which then basically means, as a developer, you have the choice, either we build our own chain, which isn't ideal for a cross chain future, or you basically say we build systems whereby we can run these things off chain, but still connect them with existing systems. Okay, so we have two super interesting insights here. One is, in order to enable this seamless crossing future, we'll need intent based protocols and also the ability to for. For any chain to perform more complex computation without having to maybe launch a separate chain or upgrade their own chain, but the ability to do it off chain, but then prove it cryptographically and upload it to or download it or post it to their own chain.
02:30:28.084 - 02:31:29.270, Speaker A: Okay, but then I think we're missing, like, a key piece in cross chain use, which are bridges, right? I mean, bridges are the way that people move from chain to chain. And we've seen how much risk is involved in bridging. Like, most of the biggest hacks have been bridge related. So how do you guys think that we can reduce this risk? Obviously, bridges. Right. So, like, about hacks and, like, the security incidents, one of the reasons is that it feels that, like, bridges are getting hacked regularly is that they are actually so big and so common for users, and they are having a lot of TVL. So whenever a hack happens, it spreads, the news spreads really fast.
02:31:29.270 - 02:33:02.762, Speaker A: But the fact is that the risk on bridges currently is really similar to other DeFi protocols. It's a smart contract risk, and the hacks were really related to the smart contract itself. But what we do, and the reason is that there's a lot of money locked on the bridges that makes hackers interested in those networks. So instead of locking funds for bridging, the intent based idea basically allows anyone to fulfill a bridge request without having a large pool of funds on one blockchain. So it reduces the risk a lot and brings a much more smooth user experience. Okay, so you're saying intent based protocols reduce the need to use bridges altogether? No, the bridge concept is a vague concept. It reduce, it removes the need for classic bridging, which LP's needed to lock the funds on both networks.
02:33:02.762 - 02:33:22.994, Speaker A: And those funds were at risk. Right. But with intent based, you don't need to lock funds on blockchains. And instead anyone can fulfill the order whenever there is a request for bridging. Okay. Without needing to lock funds in both blockchains. Yeah, exactly.
02:33:22.994 - 02:34:07.154, Speaker A: Okay, got it. What are your thoughts on, like, bridge risks? I mean, you know, obviously can't disagree with that, but, you know, for the time being, unfortunately, a lot of bridges still rely on, you know, locking funds to some extent. So I think that's important to address, too. And for those, as Mo said, inherently the thing you have is smart contract risk. And reducing smart contract risk is, you know, not just prone for bridges, but for pretty much any crypto protocol out there. However, there is, you know, a decent, there is no silver bullet for avoiding it altogether, obviously, but there's a decent amount of things along the lines of defense and depth that you can do to minimize your smart contract risk. So for starters, you should obviously always test and fuzz your code, which goes for pretty much any software, but not everyone does.
02:34:07.154 - 02:35:03.220, Speaker A: The next one, which is kind of a no brainer as well, is especially if you are not just building it as a little hobby project, but you want to build it to be a real company to some extent, or a real project. You should always get your code audited. And of course, this plays in together with writing, testing and fuzzing, because if there's any auditors in the crowd, you probably know what it's like to audit a code base with zero tests. Because for you as a developer, it's not worth it either, because then your auditor is just going to find tons of stuff that you would have found with one test anyway and miss the truly important stuff that they would have found that you wouldn't have found. And then beyond that, I mean, those are the most obvious ones. But I think beyond that, two other things that I think are quite important as well, is on one hand, open sourcing, ideally your code, or at least open sourcing your design and making your design as accessible and debatable as possible, having good docs. And this isn't just so that people can look at your protocol and say, oh, cool, this is how it works.
02:35:03.220 - 02:35:53.932, Speaker A: Let me write a Twitter thread about it, but rather so that if there is some flaw inside of your design, they can give you feedback. Because inherently, I still believe that most people in the crypto space space are good actors. So if they find a flaw in your design, I think most people would go to you and tell you, hey, I found a big bug in your thing that will allow me to drain your bridge or your smart contract in some manner, and please give me a small bug bounty instead of stealing all your money, hopefully. And I think the final thing specifically for bridges, if you look at the biggest bridge hack of all time was the axie infinity one, the Ronin bridge. And there was a couple things that was wrong with that one, including, for example, it not being audited and stuff like that. But most importantly, it being a multi sig bridge. Because if you look at how the exploit happens, if you look at some other exploits against smart contracts, you can really see it.
02:35:53.932 - 02:36:46.024, Speaker A: Some crazy thing with manipulating memory or whatever. But in the case of the Bronham bridge, it was really just one guy had three of the keys needed for the multisig, which held $350 million or some crazy number like that, and they just hacked into the system. So, yeah, just to summarize, obviously, first is having good coding practices in general, second, getting your stuff audited. Third, having your design be up for scrutiny. And fourth, well, I mean, not using a multisig for your bridge, if you can, those are great points. And you bring up a really important issue, which is bridging many times involves trusting centralized parties. Like there are many times held under multisigs.
02:36:46.024 - 02:37:36.326, Speaker A: How can we avoid this? Like, where are we with the technology so that bridges don't have to rely on multisigs? Like, are there, like, what are versions of decentralized bridges that people can rely on today? Yeah, whoever wants to go first. Yeah. So obviously currently all the bridges are basically multi seats, and that's not a good thing. And the path forward is obviously zero knowledge proofs that can enable decentralized bridging. But we are still in progress of that. We. And.
02:37:36.326 - 02:38:43.268, Speaker A: Yeah, sure, yeah. Like, totally agree with Mo on that one. And I think it kind of ties back to what I said earlier, in the sense that, like, if you look at academic papers or something, you'd think, oh, the solution is obvious, just use your knowledge proofs, or use multi party computation or fully homomorphic encryption or something. The problem is, it says that in academic papers, but in practice, it's not that easy for the reason I mentioned earlier. It's that, you know, Solana doesn't, or most blockchains don't support verifying every type of proof, or they don't support every type of cryptographic operation, which is, you know, why I think it's so important to, instead of building a new network for everything, to basically say, okay, for these existing chains, we want. We want to give them superpowers, we want to give them the ability to support more features without needing to wait potentially even years to add them, which then will allow us to more quickly transition to more advanced bridging models and smart contract models in general. So right now, you both agree that the technology to get to more decentralized, and therefore safer bridges is zero knowledge proofs.
02:38:43.268 - 02:39:36.436, Speaker A: But is it because it's too hard to implement that it hasn't been so widespread until today? Or, what's the hold up? Nico can go, but, yeah, it's too, like, on paper it's possible, but it's too complex or too computation heavy. And verifying those proofs on chain is, like, not practical. Yeah, I mean, mo basically said it. Some of you guys know, I mean, it says on the hat I'm wearing as well. Like, prior to now that we're doing Archeum, I was, well, we're still the same team, but we were elusive, which was the leading zero knowledge proof protocol on Solana. And I can tell you from personal experience, verifying zero knowledge proofs on Solana today is not nice at all. Fortunately, Solana is adding syscalls, which will make this a little bit easier.
02:39:36.436 - 02:40:18.006, Speaker A: But those won't work for every single type of zero knowledge proofs. And the other side of this as well is that the tooling, this is improving, but, you know, it's still not all the way there yet. The tooling for zero knowledge proofs has made big leaps and bounds over the last years, but it's still not ideal. For example, when we were writing the circuits for elusive before, we had so many issues that, you know, if you're especially. Especially someone who's not into cryptography, who doesn't want to hire a cryptographer or is not a cryptographer, doesn't want to deal with the whole time because there's so many edge cases. So, as mo said, better tooling for verification, but also better tooling for creating zero narge proofs. But, yeah, fortunately, both of these are making tons of progress, so the future is bright.
02:40:18.006 - 02:41:11.698, Speaker A: Okay. Okay, so we've talked about some of the tools, technologies that are needed for a seamless cross chain experience. Serial knowledge proofs, this off chain computation system, intent based protocols. But I think those are more in the kind of just, like, infrastructure layer. What about to make things simpler on the kind of front end ux layer for the end user experience to be easier? Because right now, moving from chain to chain, it's pretty clunky. Like, I was just saying, like, myself. Like, I just, you know, I'm covering defi every day, but, like, I would usually do, like, move funds via a centralized exchange.
02:41:11.698 - 02:42:36.724, Speaker A: I'm ashamed to say I think that's, you know, that's probably the experience for most people, to be honest, right now, sexes just, like, make things easier, even though I think a lot of people here would agree. Ideally, you will be doing everything in a web3 decentralized way. So what's missing on that front? To just make the web3 bridging experience the default one? Yeah, yeah, one of the, like, if you ever try to, like, on board a non crypto person to use blockchain for the first time, you see how hard is it to teach that person what's gas? This concept is just like, it's a crypto thing and people never seen it before. Like in imagine in an example of getting Uber, you needed to have Uber credit for requesting an Uber. And we have to tackle this problem. It should be the number one priority in the user experience, because whatever you want to do, you need guests. And it's.
02:42:36.724 - 02:43:17.212, Speaker A: Let's say you want to bridge from chain a to b. Even if you receive the funds on chain b, you still need guests to interact. Yeah, so it's. We have, like, some workarounds, like giving users some guests on arrival, but we have to abstract away the whole thing. It's like the clutch on the cars. And I'm sure in future we won't need to explain gas to people to interact with blockchains. Yeah, I agree.
02:43:17.212 - 02:43:47.414, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, totally agree. But the other thing that I still think is important is obviously, I'm a bit biased, but privacy for sure. You spoke about onboarding people who aren't, who've never used crypto before to crypto before to crypto. And whenever I meet a friend who hasn't used crypto before, and I told them, hey, you want to try it out? And they're like, wait, I can see how you sent me funds. I'm like, yeah, that's for everything. Whether you're trading, whether you're bridging, whether you're doing anything, everyone can see what you're doing, whether you want to or not.
02:43:47.414 - 02:44:39.644, Speaker A: And there's no way to turn that off. I have not once had someone react to that by being like, oh, man, I wish my bank account worked the exact same way, so everyone could see what I do. And so I think that's something that is not the forefront of many people's minds when they first trial crypto because they're simply not aware of it. But as soon as they get a bit deeper into it, it significantly restrains what you want to do. And that ties into central exchanges as well, because if you're, like, some big investor or something and you have a complex trading strategy that you're paying yourself quants, millions of dollars to develop, or simply, you have a trade that you might not want the entire world to know about because you're buying some cringe meme coin or something, you might not necessarily want the entire world to know that. So that's what you resort to using central Exchange. In some cases, however, with Arkham, we try to combat that by allowing you to build anything you want in an encrypted manner.
02:44:39.644 - 02:45:13.240, Speaker A: Perfect. And then to wrap up. Interested to hear your take on in this cross chain feature, what the role of Solana and maybe, you know, other big chains is. Like, do you think that all chains will be doing everything, or do you think each chain will be more specialized to specific use cases? Yeah. So, yeah, definitely. Each chain has its own features, which makes it. It better for some use cases.
02:45:13.240 - 02:46:02.864, Speaker A: But in mayan, we think Solana can be the chain that connects every other chain together. It's like a glue. And the way that we use Solana is that, let's say you want to move your assets from ethereum to an l two to arbitrum, right? We need to find the best provider for that service. You create an intent. You say, I want to move my funds from ethereum to arbitrum, and we need to find the best provider for that request. And the way that we find that is through Solana. We hold an auction on Solana and find the best provider, and that provider fulfills your request on arbitrary.
02:46:02.864 - 02:46:34.424, Speaker A: And this way, we have a, like a decentralized protocol that basically finds the best provider for each service, and it's all through Solana. Interesting. Okay. Yeah, no, I mean, I agree with mo. You know, if you look today, actually, Solana already is in many metrics, you know, the leading ecosystem. For example, if you look, look at who's doing the most defi volume and stuff like that, it is Solana. And, you know, why not? It's the fastest, the cheapest.
02:46:34.424 - 02:47:41.650, Speaker A: No one will complain about that specifically. And up until recently, or up until recently, like at the beginning, what was sort of holding Solana back from becoming this really rank one and global settlement layer, whether that be for bridging or even roll ups to some extent, is that it always had this, you know, bad thing on Twitter where people would be like, oh, Solana VC, it's centralized, blah, blah, whereas ethereum ideal, it's wonderful. It's decentralized, which is true as well. However, Slon has evolved a lot in that sense, which means that now we can really say it's fast, cheap, but also extremely decentralized, which I think makes it primed to become the number one as a settlement layer for all of blockchain. Really? Okay, so you guys agree that you think that Solana will be the main chain for global settlement? Like, it will be the place where most financial transactions happen, and then maybe the other chains will be secondary to it? Yeah, definitely. Yeah, no, I think so, too. I mean, I think we wouldn't both be building on that as our primary chain if we weren't extremely confident in that.
02:47:41.650 - 02:48:24.974, Speaker A: Yeah. And what do you think that other chains will be more used for gaming? Do you think there will be more specific use cases on other chains, or what will the role of other chains be? I don't see a reason why people should use other chains. Wow. It's all on Solana. Interesting. All right, thanks so much, guys. This was super fascinating to chat with you about cross chain and hope you all enjoyed it as well and have a great lunch hour and hope you are also all subscribed to the defiant.
02:48:24.974 - 02:49:15.294, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, everybody, here comes the lunch break. And stay tuned with us because after lunch break, we will have interesting topics and discussion panels, and we will have legendary speakers like Raoul pal Ansem and Anatoli Jakhovnko. Thank you. Enjoy your lunch and be back here at 01:30 p.m. thank you. Change my.
02:49:15.294 - 03:49:53.584, Speaker A: Hello again. Good afternoon. How was your lunch. Hope you enjoyed. You're back. Got some power nap. I've seen some people in the picnic lounge, backside having power naps.
03:49:53.584 - 03:50:20.804, Speaker A: Once again, I'm your host. My name is Rashid Berker enhors. I'm a stage and screen artist, but not a scam artist, though. And now we have more exciting, more energetic, and interesting second half for you. And I want to get the ball rolling. I want to invite someone you already know. It has a lot of qualities.
03:50:20.804 - 03:50:58.260, Speaker A: And he is Sherpa super team, host of Solana ecosystem call and the lead of the Jupyter uplink working group. Did I miss something? There is more. Yeah, I'm talking about Kesh Danda, so he's gonna be on stage. Please, let's welcome him with a big round of applause. Thank you. Super team. Yeah, do we have any super team members in the building right now? Yeah, a few people.
03:50:58.260 - 03:51:30.340, Speaker A: All right, that's good to hear. So today I'm gonna be talking about super team and how we onboard builders globally. Out of curiosity, how many of you have even heard of super team already? Oof. My delicate ego is shattered, but all right, I guess that's why I'm here, to tell people about how this all works. What I'm going to talk about today is why Superteam exists, what we actually do, how we go about doing it, and then I'm going to end with a little request for everyone here in the audience. Over on the right side, you can see some nice things people have said about us in the past. As already mentioned, my name is Kash Donda.
03:51:30.340 - 03:51:50.724, Speaker A: I'm the sherpa of super team, which is a made up title. I made it up myself. Does not mean anything. Part of the founding team, I run all the super teams globally, do product and a bunch of other things, along with all the other stuff that kind of already came through. So let's jump right into it. Why Superteam exists. Like any good startup, we kind of built superteam with a problem to solve in mind.
03:51:50.724 - 03:52:20.970, Speaker A: And maybe you noticed there's a lot of bad ideas out there. The general world has this kind of, like, mind virus about crypto. So what we're trying to fight against at super team is first and foremost the idea that it's all a scam. Right? Like, when I told my mom I was going to start working in crypto, she was immediately disappointed. Does anyone have family members that are like, oh, crypto's a scam and shouldn't really be a thing? Yeah, I see some very sad faces in the audience. Yeah, it is a bummer. And so that's one of the things that we're trying to fight against and rewrite people, people's mental programming.
03:52:20.970 - 03:52:47.710, Speaker A: The second thing is that it's just for traders. So maybe it's not just a scam, but really you can only do it if you're making money. Maybe you're like ansome and you're making millions of dollars or whatever else, but what do other people kind of do, right? And it turns out there's a bunch of opportunities that we want to bring to the front and show people that are out there. And then the final thing is this idea that there are too many chains. So you don't think it's a scam. You know, it's not just for traders, but you don't really know where to get started. And it feels like everything is kind of the same same out there.
03:52:47.710 - 03:53:21.326, Speaker A: So the new kind of mental programming that we're trying to put into the world through superteam fixes these three problems. The first one is that actually crypto is not a scam. There's real value for real people in the real world being built, whether that's in DeFi or deep in, or with NFTs or social fi or any of the other areas of crypto that are actually good for the world. So we try to promote those as much as possible. The second thing we're trying to do is help people earn their crypto rather than just buying it. Right. Because odds are you, like me, are a terrible trader, and you probably lose money whenever you trade.
03:53:21.326 - 03:53:55.658, Speaker A: I certainly do. Right. In fact, most of the money that I have made in crypto is by actually earning it, by advising projects, by actually working in Daos and so on and so forth. So we're trying to get people to understand this a little bit more clearly. And then finally, on too many chains, we're trying to show the world that one community is not like the others. And you can see this if you look around yourself right now at the, what, whatever, 800 people that are in this room, that Solana is kind of built differently. So what is super team actually doing all day? What do we actually do? In one sentence, we are a network of communities all around the world, helping to onboard talent to Solana.
03:53:55.658 - 03:54:22.100, Speaker A: So not just users, not just traders, but people who are producers who can create more value for the ecosystem. We do this indeed, all over the world. So we started in India like, two and a half years ago, and now this graphic's actually already out of date. I'm realizing, because we just launched Japan and we're launching super team France in about a week, but we have like 13 of them now, including super Team Turkey. I don't know if Ezgi is in the building. I can't really see out there. I see Ezgi and Sulei stuff are back there.
03:54:22.100 - 03:54:48.636, Speaker A: Shout out to them. Super team Turkey does awesome work. It's a community of up to 150 talented people here who are helping push Solana forward, serving as evangelists for the ecosystem. This graphic used to be a Venn diagram. I'm not sure what happened to it on the technical side, but basically, what does super team actually do? We help people learn, earn and build in crypto. So on the learning side, let's go there. First, we do a bunch of content that people maybe have seen on Twitter.
03:54:48.636 - 03:55:26.090, Speaker A: If you're active on Twitter, we do videos about Solana projects, like this video we did about Hivemapper. And then we do some kind of trolley fun content as well. Like this video about ETH maximisis, which is a disease that eats at the brains of ETH people. Has anyone seen that by chance? Okay, more people have seen that than know about super deep, which is good. So we do a bunch of content stuff. We also do a lot of workshops, right? So actually helping people learn how to create products and protocols on Solana. So you can see here from Super Team Germany, from Super Team Vietnam, Super Team India, super Team Turkey does a particularly awesome job of this here in Istanbul and Ankara and Anatolia and a bunch of other cities all across Turkey.
03:55:26.090 - 03:56:16.032, Speaker A: So you can actually go there, meet other people who want to build, find a co founder, or at the very least, learn how you can start contributing to the network on the earning side. The second kind of big piece here, right? Because we want people to earn their crypto, not just buying it. Earning is the gateway truck, right? Like, the first time that you make money on chain, you'll never forget it, and it immediately gets you kind of hooked and you immediately feel like you want to explore the rest of crypto. So to push this forward, we created a site called Earn Superteam, which has all of the bounties, grants, and many of the jobs in the Solana ecosystem in one place for people to find. This is entirely free, and if you go there, you will start making money. As of, like, literally an hour ago, we have $75,000 of earning opportunities listed on this site that anybody can actually use. I see some smart people in the audience taking photos of this slide.
03:56:16.032 - 03:56:42.470, Speaker A: You should go sign up. It's entirely free and will notify you based on your skills and what you're interested in to make sure that you can earn in the future. I'll leave this up for a little while as people take the photos. Like I said, a lot of these are open bounties, which are permissionless contests. So anybody who wants to contribute can start to contribute and earn some funds. These typically range from about five hundred us dollars to five thousand us dollars. Then we have projects, grant programs and so on.
03:56:42.470 - 03:57:06.656, Speaker A: Here are a few of the projects that we've worked with. Basically every major project on Solana has used superteam in some fashion at this point. So yeah, there's a bunch of them on there. The last piece all around building and actually creating valuable startups. So we do a few different things here. The first one is we have this website called Build Superteam Fun. It's an idea bank that has more than 200 different ideas that anyone in this room can pick up and start to build.
03:57:06.656 - 03:57:31.816, Speaker A: We source ideas from experts all across the ecosystem in terms of what the Solana ecosystem actually needs. Otherwise, you just end up building like NFT ticketing for the thousandth time. Instead, we have some actual value add kind of things in here. No disrespect to anyone building NFT ticketing. We also run a bunch of grant programs that we called Instagram. So Instagram are free money that we give out to people with no strings attached. We don't ask for any equity or anything else.
03:57:31.816 - 03:57:56.194, Speaker A: You can apply in less than 15 minutes and get a grant of up to $10,000 delivered to you in your wallet within 72 hours. It's a pretty incredible thing. We've done a few million dollars worth of grants already. Super team Turkey, actually, again, in the back of the room, they have their own grants program. So if you speak Turkish or if you live in Turkey, you can apply directly to that. You have a fast lane to get approved. We're specifically trying to fund people who are building things with code or with content or with community.
03:57:56.194 - 03:58:19.108, Speaker A: So if you want to host a Solana meetup in your city, I would love to give you money to do that. If you are building a public good or developer tool, we will give you money to do that as well. Maybe you're just making videos about Solana crossroads. We might be able to give you some money for that as well. These are all on the Instagram, part of super team earn. We run this for the Solana foundation, for wormhole, and for many other partners. So I think we have like a dozen different grant programs at this point that people should go check out.
03:58:19.108 - 03:58:55.634, Speaker A: All in the spirit of helping people build is the idea. And then lastly, on the build side, we provide a lot of mentorship and more importantly, friendship. Right? Super teams are fundamentally the community is the core product. And what we have seen is that building in crypto is really lonely because a lot of people think it's a scam or only for traders or whatever else, right? So what makes it a lot easier is when you're with like minded people who also believe that Solana is actually a real thing that can drive real value, and so together, you can actually make tons of friends. This is a photo from Super Team India. As you can see here, super team Turkey is awesome. There's a bunch of really cool people in there, and there's already companies that have been forming.
03:58:55.634 - 03:59:31.796, Speaker A: There are people who are splitting off and creating their own communities on the side of it and so on and so forth. So super team really provides intimacy as a service. That's the kind of idea that we're trying to do, bring people together who want to build really cool ship. Here are a few numbers in terms of how this is all going so far, the important one here. So up on the content side, you can see we have a bunch of folks kind of following what we're doing, whether it's in discord or Twitter or substack readers. The community side, we've only been tracking events for over the last, like, I think, seven or eight months, and we're already at 61,000 total attendees across virtual and IRL all over the world. Basically every week.
03:59:31.796 - 04:00:12.280, Speaker A: If you're in a super team country, there's an event that you can go to and meet like minded people, level up your skills and all the rest. But the metric that matters most is this one down in the bottom corner. Our key Northstar metric at super team is something called community GDP, which is how much money has been earned for super team members by super team members. All of the earning opportunities, did you hire somebody? Did you use them for a bounty? Did you give them a grant? And so on and so forth. To date, we actually just crossed a few days ago $4 million earned by super team members just for being super team members. And that does not include venture funding or anything else like that. Right? So being a super team member is one of the most lucrative things that you can do in crypto.
04:00:12.280 - 04:00:35.628, Speaker A: This does not include all of the airdrops that super team members get and all the unique access to talent and opportunities and networking and so on and so forth. So being a super team member, it's good business, I can tell you. How does this actually work? Let me tell you a little bit about that. So we are not venture backed. We are grant supported. We're effectively a nonprofit. What we're trying to do is be a public good for any Solana project to actually benefit from.
04:00:35.628 - 04:01:14.962, Speaker A: So for anyone who's talented in Solana, or if you've started a company on Solana, we want to help you grow, right? There's no fees on anything we do, and we don't play favorites. So we'll work with every staking provider, we'll work with every defi protocol, including many of the speakers that have already come up. Right. So if you're a talented person, what do we actually provide you? Well, first, the earning opportunities that I mentioned earlier, so you can actually get some security in your own life and be able to work on things that really interest you. We have had dozens and dozens of super team members quit their jobs that they hated and go full time in web3 just by becoming super team members. Obviously, the mentorship is pretty big and the fundraising. So we help teams fundraise across the world, including teams like uprock from Turkey.
04:01:14.962 - 04:01:46.258, Speaker A: So shout out to uprock, who I think are just finishing up a round as well. And then, of course, distribution. We have a big, kind of a. We have a big presence in the Solana ecosystem, right? I host the Solana ecosystem call every month where we can have super team members profiled. We have all of the Twitter followers, all the discord following and so on. So by becoming a super team member, your distribution game is already solved, right? You have an army of other evangelists around you who are part of the same community, who share that same identity and who want to help you succeed. So being a super team member is quite good if you are.
04:01:46.258 - 04:02:10.978, Speaker A: Do we have any founders in here? Are there people with projects? Should I even talk about this? A few folks. Okay, cool. If you are a Solana based project, you can use super team entirely for free. So the main things that we help with are go to market and awareness building. So if you want to enter a new market, let's say you want, you want to expand in Turkey, you'll work with super team Turkey to distribute your bounties, your grants, your projects. All across people can do decentralized content creation and a lot more stuff. We also help with ecosystem building and community building.
04:02:10.978 - 04:02:31.812, Speaker A: We've done fellowships for people like hero. I know they're going to be speaking a little bit later as well. And then, of course, talent recruitment. So if you're a dev and you need a designer, or you need a marketer or a new copywriter, we have a talent network that literally spans the globe, and we're the best place to find talent. And the best part is we don't charge any money for it. Right. We're just here to help Solana projects win, whether you're big or small.
04:02:31.812 - 04:02:45.260, Speaker A: So you can reach out to super team and we will help. These are some of the specific ways that we help with projects. But if you're a founder, I think there's a fewer of them. We don't need to go through all that. So that is why we exist. That is what we do. That's how we do it.
04:02:45.260 - 04:03:05.678, Speaker A: But we need some of your help. Right? We've been around for about two and a half years, and we've grown from one country now to 13 countries. But the goal is to continue growing. We're trying to get to 198 countries by the end of next year. We want a super team in every single country is where we're driving towards to make that happen. We need some help. So a, if you are a founder, or if you work with people who are founders, we need your money, honestly.
04:03:05.678 - 04:03:23.612, Speaker A: So give us your money. Get contributions back. So again, you'll get value for it. You'll get talent to create valuable things, to write code, content, or community around it. You can shoot me a DM on Telegram, I'll respond to every single one of them. If you want to sponsor something like this and have your go to market improved or find some talent. So that's the first thing.
04:03:23.612 - 04:03:37.244, Speaker A: The second thing is that we're looking for more super team leads. In particular. There's a few countries. This is Alpha. I don't know if this is meaningful alpha, but it is Alpha. These are the countries that we're looking to expand to next. Canada, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, and basically everywhere else.
04:03:37.244 - 04:04:07.194, Speaker A: So if you know somebody who is a community founder, somebody who can really bring talented people together and help unlock their potential. Potential, then please reach out and let me know. Maybe you're sitting in this room and you want to do it, or maybe you have a friend in a different country or someone you really look up to who you think could benefit from tapping into the super team ecosystem. And then the final one is help spread the word. Right? We do this all for the love of the game, to help Solana win in the long run. And we need people like you to support us as we do that. So you can follow us on Twitter, or you can follow super team Turkey in particular.
04:04:07.194 - 04:04:24.024, Speaker A: Ezgigaljan and Shule, I think, are here somewhere. Find them. Try to become a super team member by either winning a grant or a bounty, earning your way in, and you'll find good things happen to you. That is super team with a little bit of time to spare. Not bad. Thank you very much, everybody. Cheers.
04:04:24.024 - 04:05:21.714, Speaker A: Thank you again, Kash, for this amazing call. And next in our agenda, like in any business model, we need targets, we need leads, because we'll be talking about onboarding the next billion crypto users and our presenters. Our speakers is gonna talk about and share insights on bridging the gap and embracing the new users. Like me, for example. You can use me as a case study because I'm a very old school guy just hiding my belongings and assets under a tree in an unknown place in a jug. So there are many, like, they're on the way. Level one, level two, level three.
04:05:21.714 - 04:06:06.510, Speaker A: So join us to discuss and pave the way for the next billion in crypto. And let's have our speakers on board and warm welcome. Big applause for Ansem Jake. Jake Hillhouse and Tep Tiller. Thank you. Yo, what's up, everybody? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? All right, that was some weak applause. Let's do that again, everybody.
04:06:06.510 - 04:06:17.874, Speaker A: Excited for everybody on this panel right here. Let's go. Thank you. Thank you. That was good. That was good. Hey, that was a proper turkish welcome.
04:06:17.874 - 04:06:54.946, Speaker A: All right, so we've got this awesome, awesome all star panel here. We've got theptila, the queen of step, the queen of Solana All Stars. We've got Ansem, the legendary, famous man of mystery. And we've got Jakey, the man who literally drove across three countries to make conference. So this panel we're gonna talk about, how do we onboard the next billion people to crypto? And I couldn't think of a better group of people to talk to about that for various reasons. So I want to kick it off just by saying, what is the reason we're trying to onboard a billion people? Right. It's about this.
04:06:54.946 - 04:07:25.358, Speaker A: It's about private money for the world. It's about people having access to something that allows them to store the value of their money versus their money getting deteriorated and them being poor, in essence. So we're trying to create wealth and richness and the ability for people to own their own future. That's what we're trying to do. And so, really excited to talk about all of the ways that we're onboarding these people. So, phep, I want to start out with you and talk about the importance of global events when onboarding the next billion people. Walk us through.
04:07:25.358 - 04:07:58.904, Speaker A: Why are events important in general? Well, look at this crowd. I guess that's the answer I want to talk about in real life events first, which is my passion, which is why we're all here mostly. There is a difference between real life events and online events, right? And most of you know, Solana all stars, more than 50% of you here are actually coming from Solana all stars. So can you guys make some noise? Solana all stars. Solana all stars. Are we in here? Yeah. Yeah.
04:07:58.904 - 04:08:58.946, Speaker A: So I want to tie this with the reason why we have this crisis crowd in front of us today is because of those engagements, those real life events that we held at a places like it's 18 hours away from here. There are friends here sitting in these chairs that came from that city, just from being on boarded through salon. All stars in real life events give you this ability to taste, smell, and understand the room and shape your community building based on what you see. So I'll give you examples. Most of you know that Solana all stars is actually in three different countries. Venezuela, Turkey, obviously, and Nigeria. We found that every country is really unique to how we approach the community.
04:08:58.946 - 04:09:26.498, Speaker A: Not only every country, but also every city. Right? Like, we go to a different city. Okay. This audience is not actually taking our content the way that we want it. Right. So it is unique in a way that we approach these events. And when I go to Elazu again, it's not the same as an event in Istanbul, as you mostly would agree.
04:09:26.498 - 04:10:07.364, Speaker A: People in Istanbul is. You know, there's a lot of events that are going on, not in. There's not events going on in Navshare. We were there two weeks ago. 300 people showed up for our first event, and they said, hey, be prepared, because we'll be a thousand next time. So what happens with these events is that this happens, then those people actually take the time to come to a conference 20 hours away, and that's how we build community. This is not, you know, people just tweeting each other on crypto Twitter, but physically being here, they value being here.
04:10:07.364 - 04:10:45.584, Speaker A: They actually take their hurdle of total of, what, 40 hours of travel for two days? I don't know if you guys saw. Is Kate here? Hero Kate. She just tweeted something today. Said, I love crossroads, because I only know one person that I met, I saw today, meaning that this is new, this is an unlocked community that we created. Right? That's the beauty of that. And I encourage you guys to actually look at your Twitter today. Trending will say, answer why? Because you guys have been tweeting about Ansem all day, right? Taking pictures with him.
04:10:45.584 - 04:11:02.564, Speaker A: And that. That's the power. We took over Twitter today through this event. So I guess that's the power of events and how we onboard people. That's amazing. Being unique in every place that we go to. Cool.
04:11:02.564 - 04:11:31.744, Speaker A: So speaking of that, so we're talking about the in real life component, right? And that's massive. That's massive. But then there's this whole virtual world as well. And to ask Ansem, what is it like, kind of being this digital shepherd of people where people are following you, what are you noticing? What is it? Yeah. What does that feel like? It's honestly been very surprising for me. It came out of nowhere. I've been pretty active in crypto since, like, 2017, I want to say.
04:11:31.744 - 04:12:08.036, Speaker A: But just more recently, my Twitter, I guess an ex, went crazy. I think it's cool to see how much impact you can have on people by just knowledge that you share online. That's been one of the biggest things for me because I was at three k followers, I think, in 2020. And then that Covid cycle, as you guys know, everything went insane. And I was just sharing trades I was taking, and my account was just like, as Solana was going up and bitcoin was going up and everything else, I just hit a lot of trades back to back, and people were telling me on them. So it was like my following went to, like, I think, 100k. But it's really cool.
04:12:08.036 - 04:12:45.770, Speaker A: Like, I have a strong community online, and then whenever I come to events like this, people are super excited to see me, which is awesome. I think crypto is really representative of that. It's like any country that you go to, you're going to find somebody who knows Solana, who holds bitcoin, who holds ethereum. It's a very globally distributed community, and it's kind of why we're so tightly knit online is because that's where we can talk to everybody. And you pop up somewhere and it's like, yo, we're best friends, but I've only met you once in person. And in terms of Solana in general, you were here through the bear market, here for the bull market. You've been through quite a bit, and I'm just curious what stood out about Solana.
04:12:45.770 - 04:13:13.302, Speaker A: As this unique community that you wanted to be a part of. Yeah. So I've been in Solana since early 2021, so almost four years now. It's a long time now, but, yeah, for me, I've seen the entire growth of the Solana ecosystem back in early 2021. That was right after Defi summer happened on Ethereum. That was kind of like a big proving, like, proof of proof of concept for crypto. Like, Defi is a real thing.
04:13:13.302 - 04:13:38.876, Speaker A: These are real applications in crypto. This isn't more than just the icos we had in 2017. These are actual applications that people can use and have real value compared to Tradfi and all those other web two incumbents. So I was like, proof of concept. But then Ethereum had a lot of issues with congestion and high fees towards the end of 2020. So in my head, I'm like, okay, we have all these different l ones in crypto. I assume that we're not just going to have DeFi on ETH, we're going to have DeFi on all of these other l one s as well.
04:13:38.876 - 04:14:03.324, Speaker A: And that was the beginning of what? Like, why I thought the Solana trade would make sense. It was really just an idea at that point, because there was nothing really built on the chain yet. So I was like, early 2021. Yeah, I've been around. I saw when solid was the only wallet, I think radium was like the only Dex. I was farming all those things super early, like Sam. Oh, the first meme coin on salon, and now we have thousands every single day.
04:14:03.324 - 04:15:09.800, Speaker A: And then 2021, you kind of saw that community form, because back then, the all l one thesis was not strong at all. It was very e focused, all of crypto, and nobody really thought any of the l ones would result in anything, because a lot of the other ones, before it failed, it was before Defi, there wasn't really that many applications in crypto, but Solana in the market, a lot of people were able to buy it, like super low. And that community that formed around, like one, $2, $3, $10 before any real applications were there have been on Solana and active on chain since the very first applications existed. And that's why you see with Ethereum, too, like everybody who bought the Ethereum ico back in 2014, 2015, there's a super strong Ethereum community. And it's the same with Solana now back from 2021. A big part of my thesis on Solana last year was because I've seen that community grow, saw all the applications get built, and then met a lot of the founders on Solana. And then in 2022, when I saw the chain have issues with, like, downtime congestion, when people were spamming the NFT mints and all of that, I don't know if y'all remember that.
04:15:09.800 - 04:15:43.156, Speaker A: And there were just a lot of things that had to be fixed on the technical side. But if you were active and following Anatoly and following all developers and following their updates, you knew that they were doing a ton of work behind the scenes to fix these issues. If you were active and present, which I was online, and a lot of other salon people were, too. So it's just if you were outside looking in, you're like, oh, this chain's down five times a year. It doesn't work. It's down 80% from the highs. Why would I ever want to buy that? But if you're active in the community, which a lot of you guys are, and I was, you saw the value there, and a lot of people were able to see that the same way that I saw it.
04:15:43.156 - 04:16:15.432, Speaker A: I was at breakpoint in 2022. I think Price was around, like, $40. They just announced the Google Cloud partnership, and then I'm flying back from breakpoint, and that's when FTX happened, and everybody got off the plane and was like, yo, what? What the fuck? Like, this just went from 40 to 80, and it's down, like, 80%, and everybody's panicking. But all the founders, developers in Solana, were unfazed for the most part. Like, we know why we're here. We know why we're building on Solana. It wasn't dependent on SBF.
04:16:15.432 - 04:16:32.344, Speaker A: He wasn't even president breakpoint. Nobody talked about him at all at break point. So just having that. That background knowledge on. On the entire community was really a crucial part of me building my thesis. So I didn't really waiver all of 2023 when everybody was saying I was crazy. That's amazing.
04:16:32.344 - 04:16:53.888, Speaker A: Thanks for walking through that. Well, you're still crazy, though. A little bit. Not that way, though, so. Okay. Jakey the man, the myth, the legend, the person who went from Canada all the way to Serbia to Bulgaria to finally being here in front of us today, getting through some crazy border stuff, and you're here. So you've had meetups along the way.
04:16:53.888 - 04:17:35.224, Speaker A: You've met with so many people over the last several months. Just in general, I don't think there's maybe a better person at this exact moment over the last few days to discuss, what is that journey like? What is the community like along the way the people you've been talking to, what's going on? Yeah, I don't know. It's been pretty interesting. I think, like, my first crypto event was NFT LA, which was 2023, beginning of 2023. And, you know, it's like, certain opportunities that you realize that you wouldn't get elsewhere if you weren't inside of crypto. So, like, a great example was there's this indoor ski park called the Barracks. It's, like, a very famous skate park out in LA.
04:17:35.224 - 04:18:04.366, Speaker A: And I would have never been able to go there if it wasn't for Solana and the people within Solana to have the connection to put on an event there. And so that was, like, an eye opening experience where it was, like, these events and these people that you get to meet inside crypto, it doesn't matter where they are in the world. They all share, like, this one interest, and they can all bring kind of, like, something to the table. And so after LA, I was like, I was telling Colton, he's right here. We're gonna go to every event. We're gonna film it, we're gonna document it, because these events are sick. Like, crypto to the side.
04:18:04.366 - 04:18:29.864, Speaker A: Like, these events alone, I think, can, like, onboard people just because of how much fun they are and the people you get to meet and the different types of people you get to meet. And so, yeah, from that point on, even, like, breakpoint, that was my first time in Europe, you know, is in Amsterdam. I didn't get see much of it, so I'm glad I'm back here. And we did the road trip. That was, like, a perfect experience to kind of get cultured and. What's it called? The tracksuit. A slav.
04:18:29.864 - 04:18:42.044, Speaker A: Am I saying that right? The Adidas tracksuit? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I was looking like Slav. You were looking good, man. We put a cigarette in my mouth, and I looked like a gangster. So it was cool to do that.
04:18:42.044 - 04:18:53.010, Speaker A: And so we went from. Yeah, I flew it to Serbia and then ended up here, and I got to meet a ton of cool people. I don't know if Marco is out there, but he was the driver. I love Marco. Shout out Marco. We love you, Marco. Shout out Marco.
04:18:53.010 - 04:19:38.302, Speaker A: Thank you. But, yeah, awesome. That's amazing. So, okay, in terms of directionally, the whole mission of Solana is how do we get a billion people using this chain? How do we get everybody using crypto in multiple different facets of their financial life, as well as maybe gaming deep in infrastructure, et cetera, like, that's the direction we're headed in. But where are we right now? I'm curious, ansem, your take on where are we at in the journey of trying to get to a billion people in terms of users? Yeah, I think we're in a good spot. I think the biggest hindrance before was the infrastructure, I think because I mean, Solana and all these other l one's really weren't capable of handling even a billion users on chain. Like that wasn't possible, I think, in the past few years.
04:19:38.302 - 04:20:39.174, Speaker A: But I think we're a lot closer to that now. And even with fire dancers coming as well, we're going to even more closer to that. So I think it's really twofold. It's on the side of people who don't know anything about crypto. It's more of a perception, I think, issue, because crypto has seen a lot of scams over the past ten or so years, and the space was a lot more immature, I would say, back then, than it is now. And people just have to catch up to realizing that it's on people like us who are active in the community to kind of change that perception. Whether that's telling your friends who you're close to, like, oh, telling them about crypto, getting them set up with a wallet, like talking to people actively in your communities, or if it's stuff like what Jakey's doing, which is the content online, that just gets a lot more distribution online through channels, like the entertaining stuff is just as important as what the developers are building behind the scenes, because there can be amazing developers building out great products, but if nobody sees the products, then nobody's really going to even know that they exist.
04:20:39.174 - 04:21:17.318, Speaker A: So I think the distribution piece of crypto is something that people are working on as well, which is why the entertaining aspects and content creation is also really important. And then I think the other big issue that we've had is kind of like trad five pushing back on crypto. And that's changing a lot this year, in the past year with, with stuff like the bitcoin spot, ETF getting passed. Just generally, I think in the US, we've seen a lot more politicians be like, more favorable to crypto. And globally, it's a lot, I think, easier than it is in the US and other places. But I think generally people are accepting that crypto is not going anywhere. Crypto is like a cockroach tried to kill it a ton of times.
04:21:17.318 - 04:21:49.634, Speaker A: Over the past ten years, we've had scams rivaling that of the biggest scams in financial history happen in crypto, and we're still here. So I think people are real. Like, now we're not going anywhere. And now it's just like what I've said this cycle is. I think this is the best time for retail. Who's not active in crypto to get active in this space because you're front running literally trillions of dollars, who are just gonna be passively allocating to this industry in the same way that they allocate the stocks and everything else and all these other assets. So I think it's on us to tell people that, like, we have to do our part in doing that.
04:21:49.634 - 04:22:12.824, Speaker A: And we have a ton of super, super smart developers working on building out all these other applications outside of DeFi, whether it's consumer AI stuff, DPIn real world assets. I think we're close. I mean, it's a long process, though. You got to think crypto is only, what, 1015 years old as an industry. You compare that to how old all these other industries are. We're super, super, super small, super early. I want to add something here.
04:22:12.824 - 04:22:58.202, Speaker A: And I think we're learning as a community, right through memes, before, ogs would be like, why are you buying this? Why is a meme important, too? Now we're understanding. Building a community could go through a whiff, right? Or ansem. You know, that's how a lot of people got into crypto this cycle. Would you agree? I definitely agree. I mean, I think NFTs last cycle were big as well in that aspect, like building community. Nfts and memes, I say they're like a trojan horse for getting people active in crypto and active in these communities. It's like once you have a wallet, you have, what, $10, $100 worth of width.
04:22:58.202 - 04:23:31.006, Speaker A: You have some bach, you have some of some other meme coins, and you go on Twitter and there's like hundreds of thousands of people who all hold the same coins too. And they're super excited, super active in the these communities within. That's kind of like, I think the click for people like, oh, crypto is kind of cool. What else can I do now? Now maybe I want to use margin five. Now maybe I want to use some other NFT platform. Now maybe I want to do more research, like, why is bitcoin exist? Why is ethereum exists, why Solana important? What are the differences between these ecosystems? But it's kind of like a, it's almost like a. Yeah, it's like a trojan horse because speculation is really easy for people to understand.
04:23:31.006 - 04:23:49.066, Speaker A: Oh, I can make money on this. I'm interested in this. And then it's like, okay, why else does this have value? Yeah. And I would add to that, I think that's what's really cool about what Jakey did with the. With the car. The used cars drive them here, the meme ability of that. I think that's a perfect example of the trojan horse.
04:23:49.066 - 04:24:21.714, Speaker A: Like, literally a physical version. Horse holding up here and you guys hopping out, actually hiding inside. So that. That was super cool. I'm very curious in terms of the timeline, right, this timeline of when are we actually going to hit a billion people? Obviously, that's complete speculation, but now you're on stage, so I have to get you locked in with the numbers. So just say a year. How many years you think, before we reach a billion people? Within crypto, it doesn't have to be Solana, but just crypto community in general.
04:24:21.714 - 04:24:45.346, Speaker A: Jakey, how many years? Two. Two years, my man. Okay. What are you about to do, bro? I was thinking six months. A billion people on chain. I'll say, like, seven years. Seven years.
04:24:45.346 - 04:25:06.670, Speaker A: Okay, two years, seven, six months. What? Do you got that? Hmm. I'll play it safe. Five. Five. Yeah, I'm working on it. Okay, so somewhere between two to seven years, you know, maybe bold case scenario, six months, we'll say, hey, hey, you know, once fire dancer's out.
04:25:06.670 - 04:25:27.574, Speaker A: Exactly. That's what I'm saying. So I guess the other thing is, what are you guys most excited about from the community standpoint? What are the things that just get you amped up? You know, we've got the sphere. We're trying to do, for example, with dogwuf hat. We've got the used cars. We're just doing stunts with that. We've got some fun stuff in the background playing.
04:25:27.574 - 04:25:53.704, Speaker A: There might be a race. There might be some sort of race that's occurring as well. And then obviously, we've got the all star events where there's a lot of fun stuff. So maybe we start with Jakey. I'm very curious. What are you just most excited about it, moment in time with onboarding people? I don't know. I think it's a buzzword at this point, but I think the idea of content creation and web3 is still relatively new.
04:25:53.704 - 04:26:24.052, Speaker A: For the longest time there, we only had these NFT pfps. There was no real personality or relatability to these crypto characters. That's a new thing, at least within the last year that you see people start to blossom and attach their face to their profile. And so I think continuing down that line and continue to create, like, cool videos. Like, I know Colton and I, we just got a warehouse on Vancouver Island. I want to continue making, like, sweet commercials out of there. Break another world record.
04:26:24.052 - 04:26:46.370, Speaker A: You know, something like, I don't know, what's the world record? Give us some alpha. I was looking at one. It's the farthest distance traveled barefoot on legos. Honestly, I was just searching the world record. I was, like, looking for. So, like, the one, the paperclip one or the clothes peg one. I was just looking.
04:26:46.370 - 04:26:55.834, Speaker A: I was like, hey, the Lego one's gonna take a lot of time, like, in preparation. And I found the clothes peg one. I was like, dude, I'm. I can beat that. Next weekend. So I flew it to Colton. Colton's place, and we did it there.
04:26:55.834 - 04:27:15.614, Speaker A: So, yeah, just for context, he's a Guinness book of world Record holder for the most number of face clips on his face. Give it up. He might be the first Guinness Book of World Record person you ever meet. So definitely take a selfie. That was the. Really, the goal was like, you know, I've never met somebody with a world record. Yeah.
04:27:15.614 - 04:27:50.374, Speaker A: So, like, I want to be that guy to those people, you know? Yeah, that's super cool. What about you, Ansem, from your perspective? Yeah, I think I'll double tap on the content creator piece as well. I think that's going to be really important for crypto. I think if you look at how online gaming popped off, where people started streaming online gaming, and now it's like a big industry. In similar way, I think crypto is a really cool unlock for content creation, especially because you can monetize very directly with people. So I think that's another good area. But more so, I would say number one for me is probably social consumer apps and crypto.
04:27:50.374 - 04:28:49.828, Speaker A: Just because. Because of my experience in crypto, how I've grown socially online and being able to pop up anywhere and know people literally anywhere in the world, it's crazy to me that all of those connections are through Twitter and not through a crypto specific application. Whereas, like, I could own some NFT in my profile and, like, be able to update it. As I go to all these different conferences, meet all these different people, I feel like my web of connections is still in web, two applications, but all the meaningful connections for me personally, well, not all of them, but a lot of them are in crypto. And there's not really an application that has built out that web yet. And like, especially since everything is on chain with crypto, I feel like the history of that, the history of your social network as it grows over decades is going to be super, super powerful. Whether that's like monetizing that through selling what, looking at your trends, what applications you're using or like, which people you know, which people you meet.
04:28:49.828 - 04:29:11.474, Speaker A: There's a lot of different cool ways, I think, that social and crypto are going to intersect and nobody's really tapped it yet. Cool. And what are you most excited about? Being right. Being right. So I want to be able to say I told you so to the people. Right. I believe that we're in the era of like 19 1990s of Internet, right.
04:29:11.474 - 04:29:49.826, Speaker A: And I believe I freshly quit my job, corporate job of 15 years, by the way. Thank you. Full time crypto, it took a while for me to make that decision. Obviously, it was a family decision, but being able to say, you know, like, I knew it before you did, that's my drive. But, you know, believing in this, like, knowing that this is gonna go somewhere that most people don't see how big it's going to get, that excites me. Yeah, I think that's my answer. That's awesome.
04:29:49.826 - 04:30:05.174, Speaker A: I coastline that. I love being right. I love being right. That's right. Only possible on Solana. I'll actually add to to that. I told you about this before Ansem during bear market.
04:30:05.174 - 04:30:35.750, Speaker A: He was like, talking about Solana. Everybody was hating on Solana FTX and they were like, calling him a scammer and all that. And I was like, he's going to be the influencer of the next cycle because I knew that Solana was going to make it right. And it's just a no brainer when you know something that you track it in a way that you're like, so sure that's gonna happen. Ansem is not a surprise. The guy knew and he, like, kept doing it the right way and it happened. And Jakey is the same way.
04:30:35.750 - 04:30:57.362, Speaker A: Right. The way that he. His path, it's all about believing in something and you know, and telling people the gospel of whatever you believe in. Yeah, and that's an interesting point. It's also just conviction and doing your research as well. Do your research and then have conviction because you've done the research right. And then you're good.
04:30:57.362 - 04:31:32.146, Speaker A: You don't. You can continue to research other things, but you don't need to just jump around like magical musical chairs. That's not. You're not going to win, like, that you're going to lose all your money like that probably and be really bitter and then leave crypto and then you're going to come back in two to seven years when a billion people are here and be like, man, yep, I was there. So imagine your dad was at a, a conference for Internet in 1990s and he walked away like, you wouldn't, you could have been rich now because he didn't. So, like, that's how I feel about this. That's.
04:31:32.146 - 04:32:10.154, Speaker A: I believe that if you walk away from this and not take anything with you, you're literally walking away from your future potential. That's how I look at it. Yep. Yep. Cool. Well, any last words that you guys want to say to this amazing turkish and global audience that's right in front of us about just in general, how you think people can get involved within the Solana community, how they can make the most out of their time within crypto in general. My recommendation would be to talk to as many people as possible, whether that's online, in person, wherever your crypto channels are.
04:32:10.154 - 04:32:57.490, Speaker A: And don't be afraid of not knowing anything because when I first started in crypto, I didn't literally knew nothing. I didn't know anything in crypto. But I was on Twitter talking to everybody that was on there, asking questions all the time, asking how to trade, like, how does this market work? What should I be looking at? And literally I learned, I want to say probably 90% of how to trade and how I made all my money in crypto, I learned from crypto, Twitter and everybody that was on, like, active in crypto back in 2012, 2013, we're still active on Twitter then. I was asking them questions every day, every week, just like back and forth. And it's even more so now in crypto. It's such a new industry that you still have access to a ton of people. Like a ton of the smartest people in crypto you can talk to on a, like, very easily in other industries, you cannot do that.
04:32:57.490 - 04:33:19.714, Speaker A: And I think a lot of people take that for granted now just because of how small crypto is. But you definitely should not do that. Like, talk to as many people as possible. Build the connections. You never know, like, which friend you make randomly on some weekend is like going to be your co founder in like five years or going to be somebody that you rely on in five years for something. So I think that's, that's really important. Building your relationships and connections is important.
04:33:19.714 - 04:34:08.814, Speaker A: Amazing. I mean, I would just add time kind of to like, what Ansem said was like, everybody's somebody in crypto, and so they all have something to bring to the table. So making sure that, you know, you're asking questions, whether it's on a timeline, whether it's in person, and just meeting new people and staying in group chats. I think, like, the one thing that benefited me really early on, because I think I'm in the grand scheme of crypto, I'm still relatively new. Like, NFTs are what introduced me to crypto. So my biggest thing was like, okay, I want to find people from these NFT communities or whatever it is, people that I resonate and, you know, have, like, a group chat or whatever, and if I got questions or there's these plays or whatever it is, let's learn together, because, you know, you know, more brains in the room is better. So, yeah, I would just add to what Ansem said, to be honest.
04:34:08.814 - 04:34:42.164, Speaker A: That's what helped me very early on. Cool. Sure. What was the question? The question is, what would you say to this amazing, wonderful audience out there in terms of how they can make the most of their crypto experience? Solana experience? I'm going to give you motherly love with this. Contribute in some way. And that contribution is not just show up, like, give feedback, constructive feedback. Be part of something that contributes to something.
04:34:42.164 - 04:35:29.245, Speaker A: I'll give you examples. I met the male manager of Solana All Stars turkey during the lost crossroads, and she's now taking over the entire country management for solon all Stars. So this is not just, hey, do you have a job? Let me have the job. But how do you start something? How do you approach someone? And what is your approach? That's what I would say to everyone here. I know most of you are here to hear about what's the potential on that. Everything that I'm hearing now is talk to people, network, create groups, and you're going to be good. Just work together.
04:35:29.245 - 04:35:41.914, Speaker A: We're a team. Solana is a team. We've been through a lot of ups and downs, and you know what that trajectory is up in the grand scheme of things. So hop on the wave. Cool. So we're at time. This is the end of the panel.
04:35:41.914 - 04:36:13.754, Speaker A: I'm going to do something that's going to make the technical team really mad right now, but it's going to be really awesome, which is we're going to take a giant Ellen DeGeneres selfie with the crowd. Why not? All right, cool. So if everybody wants to stand up, is it possible that we could turn on some lights. Maybe flip the lights. All right, this is pretty good. Who wants to take the selfie? You take the selfie. Here, I've got mine.
04:36:13.754 - 04:36:35.963, Speaker A: All right. Can I veto the picture if it's not good? If it's not good, you can. I feel like I'm blocking half the crowd. One, two. Hands up. One, two, three. Solana.
04:36:35.963 - 04:37:11.300, Speaker A: Cool. That's awesome. Thank you, guys. Big round of applause. Big round of applause. Wow. One all stars.
04:37:11.300 - 04:37:45.384, Speaker A: That was very convincing. And they got me on board. And my cousin junior is going to be helping me out to get from level one to level two in. In crypto world. All right, thank you very much for this interesting conversation and moving on. Now, let's welcome our next fireside chat with Shiti Rasugi Manghani, an award winning business leader and CEO of Stepn. For the ones who haven't heard before, it's a web3 fitness app.
04:37:45.384 - 04:38:16.934, Speaker A: She's here to talk us through what's next for Stepan. And please give a warm welcome. Big round of applause. Welcome to Sheeti. And our moderator is Mia Grotsky. Enjoy. Hi, everyone.
04:38:16.934 - 04:38:58.452, Speaker A: Can I just say that a beautiful part of, one of the beautiful part of the job is to go to several events across several ecosystem, but the vibe in Solana ecosystem, hats off. Hi, Mia. Hi, sheeti. So we're gonna talk about Stepn today. We're gonna kind of dive a bit deeper into the community, into the product. I wanted to first start and share a personal anecdote of how I heard about the project. I mean, how many people in here use Stepn or have heard of it? Yeah.
04:38:58.452 - 04:39:23.136, Speaker A: Okay. So I remember this very clearly. It was about two years ago. I was at NFT NYC, and everyone started asking me if I had a referral code. And I had never heard of Stepn before. So everyone was saying, hey, do you have a referral code? Hey, do you have a referral code? And I had no idea what it was. And then everyone was walking around, kind of holding their phones, looking at it, power walking the streets of New York in between side events.
04:39:23.136 - 04:40:01.572, Speaker A: And it was like the day after that conference, it completely blew up on Twitter, and everyone was talking about Stepn. They were showing off their shoes. And it really inspired, I think, this kind of new generation of blank to earn, move to earn, walk to earn sleep to earn. There's meditate to earn, all kinds of different blank to earn products. Now, can you bring us back to the beginning, the early stages of Stepn? Where did you start with the product? What did you want to initially build and where are we now? A few years into it? Sure, sure. Thanks for sharing that story, Mia. It actually absolutely resonates with our experience.
04:40:01.572 - 04:40:46.238, Speaker A: Like, we had to have a person completely dedicated to sharing activation codes. Like, not just from the regular people on Twitter, like our users, but the most prominent investors, like the vip people. And people are just, like, being so precious about activation codes. So that's when you know you've hit the BMF. Where did we start? So, back in November, December 2021, we were just in test flight. Our two amazing founders, Yon and Jerry, they are very accomplished people in blockchain and space of gaming, respectively. And they were toying with the idea and the landscape.
04:40:46.238 - 04:41:35.934, Speaker A: Just the backdrop of. I just want to share that thinking was coming on the back of COVID coming on the back of a bit of loneliness, disjointedness, people not being able to go to gyms. There were australian bushfires happening, so bit of climate change. What can we do with blockchain that we're in the space of blockchain? What can we do? And therefore, the idea of combining fitness with blockchain in a way that could incentivize people came about first. The early name of the app were in fact even find Satoshi, where people could just go find Satoshi in the app. And it gradually evolved and evolved and evolved to the stage that Stepn is today. And the kernel of idea was to make it as simple and as accessible to people as possible.
04:41:35.934 - 04:42:11.450, Speaker A: So blockchain brought the uniqueness of business model. NFTs brought the ability to not having to rely on VC's and raise millions of dollars to bring community and, you know, basically let people own it. And fitness brought the element of getting people in. Yeah, it's very cool to kind of witness the evolution firsthand. And that also brings up an interesting point of, you know, I think something that's, that's unique about Stepn is that you're not really one thing. You're sort of a wellness app. You're also a web3 application.
04:42:11.450 - 04:42:46.504, Speaker A: You're also sort of a game. You've kind of gamified exercise. So when thinking about the identity of your project, maybe even thinking about different stakeholders that you speak with, how do you define Stepn? Thinking about those three categories? Or maybe there's a fourth that you fit into. How do you kind of define and what identity do you associate the project with? Do you want the honest answer or the clever answer? We maybe both. Well, let's start with the honest answer. The honest answer is we don't. So we let the community define what it is.
04:42:46.504 - 04:43:37.014, Speaker A: Part of that is just how small and how busy we were as a team. So we just launched something, made sure it fit the bill, made sure it hit with the community and then. And let community run with it, like decentralized community at its best form. But yes, now we have had time. We have two years into this app, which is like 20 years in a normal business. So initially it was a combination of fitness, lifestyle and speculative finance that people would define step in as over the years, more and more we have lent towards, as well as the community has moved towards it being a fitness app. At the core of the app lies the element that people go out and move.
04:43:37.014 - 04:44:31.388, Speaker A: Earning is, by the way, that is an incentive, just like the community is, just like being in web3 spaces. So fitness has become increasingly an part of why we exist. And that reflects in our community events. That reflects in the fact that without our intervention, without our financial support, there were events that were happening as we speak in La, Miami, Taipei, Taiwan, Philippines, Melbourne, Sydney, London, Japan, Tokyo, and so many countries I've missed out on. Right? So length and breadth of it. We had a contest on Twitter where we asked people to post some pictures of where they were using Stepn. And I came across countries and regions that I didn't know the names of.
04:44:31.388 - 04:45:09.878, Speaker A: And that is the beauty of the app that community built for us. There were products that were built on top of Stepn, as does for any ecosystem. I mean, I'm in no way comparing ourselves to Apple or Android or Google, but then their ecosystems are their ecosystem because people want to build on their platform. We, of course, didn't have bandwidth to even track these events on our website back in that day, and there was a product that came about to track these events. So that is the true power of web3. And that is how we have become comfortable with people letting define step in. We're really, really good in it.
04:45:09.878 - 04:45:47.482, Speaker A: Not just being a web3 app in it, not just being a move to earn app. We're very comfortable with it being a fitness app that combines people together in web3 space. Yeah, I think that's really well put. And when you're at the forefront of technology like all of web3 is, I think it's really cool to see these undefinable kind of products and moments where it's like you might have started as one thing, it's evolved, but it's also very hard to fit into a box, and it will probably continue to evolve. I'd love to talk a bit more about your community, though, about the stepn community. Right now. Obviously, we're at crossroads.
04:45:47.482 - 04:46:30.970, Speaker A: This is a Solana community conference. There's another Solana conference. There's many Ethereum conferences. So there's a lot of l one conferences that happen. But you do a lot of events for your product, for your community, for your ecosystem. So how do you think about planning IRL events for the Stepn community? How are you engaging people? How are you really getting that FaceTime with your community stakeholders? And are there any upcoming events you kind of want to tease or plug? Of course, once again, the honest answer is there is just so very little that we as a team do for the events, and there is so much more that our community does right off the bat. I can see will here.
04:46:30.970 - 04:46:56.334, Speaker A: Will just give us a shout here. He's one of our community members, many of them. I've seen him probably most of the european events. I don't know how you do what you do, but I guess it's the love of the brand and love of the community that pulls him where he goes. There are many people like that. We call them FSL champions who hold events in their respective regions. Over time, we have come to support them in some financial way.
04:46:56.334 - 04:47:33.260, Speaker A: Very little, very nominal, to be honest. Like, in the early days, I remember we weren't even able to send the t shirts out to them. Like, they were just doing it for the love of Stepn. And we hugely appreciate that. So, over time, we've come to support them in a way that we can. But I cannot overemphasize the importance of IRL events. I know we live and breathe on crypto Twitter, and we live and breathe on this web3 app, but somehow the feeling of a warm touch, a face to face smelling the app in the room is just different.
04:47:33.260 - 04:48:15.912, Speaker A: Right? And in our events, bear in mind, it's not just the crypto bros. Sorry, no offense, but it is their spouses, their mom and dads, their babies in pushpram, their dogs. It's a wholesome event when we have a running marathon. Talking of which, may I plug? We have a step in event tomorrow at 04:00 p.m. so please, please see you there. And, yeah, we love IrL events, and we love our community to host them. We can check, they can check our website on how they can go about organizing them, but I wish I had somebody like theptila all stars who could just run this for us, but we're probably not there yet.
04:48:15.912 - 04:48:49.324, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess. Do you have any advice or kind of like takeaways for folks here that are building products and maybe trying to start invoking IRL communities? Any tips just from the lessons that you've learned throughout the years of doing it? Actually, I was just standing over there when Ansem and theptalin, they were talking, talking. And it's funny because they were saying, network. Talk to people. Network, network. And I completely agree, but it's very hard for me as a person. So if there's anybody like myself out there in the crowd, don't lose hope, don't lose heart, right.
04:48:49.324 - 04:49:24.724, Speaker A: Networking is not all that you need. There's so many other ways. Because guess what? One of you guys is going to build the next step in. One of you guys is going to build the next tensor or the next super team or the next bigger app than stepn that is going to onboard tens of billions of dollars people and earn tens of billions of dollars. That is the beauty of web3 at this stage. In that sense, we are not solely reliant on vc model. In that sense, we are not solely reliant on cost heavy access to users.
04:49:24.724 - 04:49:53.726, Speaker A: And therefore, my perspective is not that of a content creator or a networker. My perspective comes from a hard go builder. Our team till date, through the abyss of the bear market, has spent 18 hours workdays. Yes, and I'm not kidding. I'm very proud of that. If you have it to work hard in you, web3 space rewards. That's the best part, honestly.
04:49:53.726 - 04:50:40.174, Speaker A: I've worked in web two and web3 at all levels, and it is very hard to build startups and apps and successfully, so, and very hard in web two. But guess what? Web three just makes it that little bit easier. So build, build, build, work hard. And that's probably the advice that I would leave with. So I guess touching on that, you know, we were kind of just in this bear market where, you know, token prices were down and I saw a lot of people I knew lose that motivation. I had friends pivot to AI and then come back to crypto when the charts started going up again. And for an app like Stepn, where, you know, the incentive for users is the, you know, the token rewards.
04:50:40.174 - 04:51:35.498, Speaker A: What, what was that phase of step in, like kind of being in the bear, you know, how did that affect the product? Did you make any changes to the product? What were the conversations with the community like then? And has that changed? Do you feel like you're out of that now? Yeah, I would love your take on that. Again, honest answer very hard. Very hard. Because the bottom line is that any moment you have made anything remotely speculative and financial, you've created an economy. Any economy is inflationary. Inflation erodes value, that erosion just takes time for good economies, meaning for good countries, it could take hundreds of years, us being an example for bad economies. There are many countries I wouldn't take the name of, but we see them in super deflationary phase and they could take ten years.
04:51:35.498 - 04:51:59.740, Speaker A: For AAA games, it takes three years. Sometimes. For crypto games, it takes three months. Step in has lasted for two years and is going to last another ten years. And that is what we are working towards. We are working towards making that economy, making that ecosystem as robust and as stable as possible. Our company is called FSL.
04:51:59.740 - 04:52:26.284, Speaker A: Step in is one of our products. So we launched the front end games, so Stepn is one of them. We launched it on Solana and then also expanded on other chains, which I shall not speak of. Solana event, wink Wink. But then we launched another game called Gas Hero on Polygon, and that broke Polygon. We sort of did like $100 million in a month of trading. Then we launched DeX to support the swap.
04:52:26.284 - 04:52:53.436, Speaker A: It is called Door again. It was number one in Solana. We launched a marketplace called more to support NFT trades. It's multichain again. Then we launched recently a wallet slash unifying Id as a login to web3. Our vision is that at some point, just how you use login with Google, login with Facebook, you will have a login with x in web3. And we're trying to build towards that, as are many other people.
04:52:53.436 - 04:53:35.404, Speaker A: But that's a product builder's version towards it. So long and short of your question is, are bear markets hard? Super hard. But if you're here to stay, if you've got, if you just zoom out just one tiny little bit, I'm not even saying four year cycle or super cycle or this and that, over time, the value accrues and compounds. So then it doesn't matter whether the token is at $0.37 or a 50 cent, because at some point it is at a dollar or $2 and at some point all of us are going to make it, right. That's not a trope, that's a reality, and that's how it has been for the last 15 years. One thing I do say is, though, that, no, we're not early.
04:53:35.404 - 04:54:01.024, Speaker A: We're not early for any accelerationary tech. 15 years is a hell lot of time and we're over that. Mark. What we early is in terms of use cases and adoption. We've had stable coins as a use case. I mean, people do keep saying, they love saying that crypto hasn't had a cracker use case. Guess what? In last year alum, we had seven trillions of dollars worth of settlements in stablecoins.
04:54:01.024 - 04:54:24.354, Speaker A: It's way more than Mastercard, on Amex or any PayPal. They do 1.4 trillion. For context, guess how much does movie industry make in a year? 26 billion. How much does music industry make in a year? 26.2 billion. Guess how much gaming makes in a year? 184 billion.
04:54:24.354 - 04:54:53.538, Speaker A: And we're part of that web3 gaming industry. So Sky's the limit. Potential is infinite. If we just work hard, believe and study day, we're all going to make it. I love it. I think that might be the first wag me on stage today also, by the way, I don't know if I've heard one yet, but I love the sentiment and thinking about these other industries. Stepin recently did a partnership.
04:54:53.538 - 04:55:48.560, Speaker A: I'm not sure if that's the word you used with adidas. Is anyone wearing Adidas kicks today? Yeah. Okay, so can you tell us a bit about what you did with Adidas? How you maybe even started the conversations with them, how you approached them? Were they thinking about web3 on their own and then maybe speak on some other partnerships similar to adidas that you've done in the past? Of course. Partnerships are a good way for win wins, right? I make a lot of deals for a living and I think win win is the best way in relationships. Professional personal partnerships give in web3 community crossovers and in web two brand crossovers. Right? So with web and at stepn, we always, always only aim to do best of partnership. Like, my inbox is coming back to the point of networking.
04:55:48.560 - 04:56:14.614, Speaker A: Like, I get so much, I really regret it. I'm not able to respond to the DM's or tweets and this and that. So. Which is why I again insist, once you build, networking automatically happens, right? Sometimes it's not the other way. It's. So we've partnered with, like, people like Steve Aoki in Web two. We're partnered with Asics.
04:56:14.614 - 04:56:42.418, Speaker A: It was one of the runaway success. We had about two mil for just thousand sneakers. Adidas is a step towards the same. The partnership is to. Is a year long. It is going to be one of the most exemplary partnerships that will happen in Web three. We just launched a thousand sneakers and about, yes, I'm going to quote this figure, $30 million were staked for it.
04:56:42.418 - 04:56:54.638, Speaker A: So 100 million GMT. We just broke all records. The thing is, we just like to stay on the radar. Our community is just like very close knit, tight somehow. Maybe that's not such a good thing. Maybe that's a good thing. I don't know.
04:56:54.638 - 04:57:24.444, Speaker A: We just keep building. We have a few other exciting pieces of news coming up. I don't believe in the concept of alpha, so maybe nothing is going on this stage. That's the sad part. But if you keep on our Twitter so stepnofficial and fs, you will soon learn about it. The idea behind all these partnerships is adoption. And we look at adoption in three ways.
04:57:24.444 - 04:57:43.614, Speaker A: The first is product. Second is partnership. Third is events in product. We are probably, and I just say probably because I don't want to sound too immodest. Probably the only app that has partnered with Apple Pay for in app payments. That's part of the adoption. We take the hit on business with 30% tax.
04:57:43.614 - 04:58:36.038, Speaker A: I know it's such a controversial topic, so we won't go into the details, but the idea behind partnering with Apple Pays so that people don't have to get into wallet onboarding this, that seed phrases would just double click. You buy, you purchase the NFTs. So those are kind of the product integration wallet. Fslid that we've launched is another effort in simplifying onboarding in simplifying that login into the web. Three, second is, like I said, partnerships, whether it's de gods, whether it's Steve Aoki, we try and partner with the best people for Stepn for more, which is our NFT marketplace. And then third is events that we have spoken about, which is, again, adoption at scale for people who are crypto native, but more importantly, also people who are non crypto. And we're at that stage where a lot of this onboarding actually happens in real time.
04:58:36.038 - 04:59:12.574, Speaker A: I've seen so many people, like, helping people, the moms that purchase the first NFT for setting up their first wallet. Yeah. I mean, sadly, we are at that space. But we do, when we get lemons, we make lemonade. Right? So these events help in that kind of adoption. So that's the thinking behind. And when working with some of these brands, like Adidas, do you feel like the sentiment for what blockchain, what crypto can do for them, has sort of recovered or is there still some questions left for them? Oh, my God, that's such a great question.
04:59:12.574 - 04:59:38.704, Speaker A: And I think it's cyclical pretty much with the token prices. Right. So sad. As it is, our utility or our use case goes up and the token price goes up. And equally the other way. Most companies, most big ones at least, who think future, have set up a web3 division. So that's hardening.
04:59:38.704 - 05:00:29.238, Speaker A: Now comes what is their budget allocation for this web3 division? Slash, what is their scope that does toggle with market sentiment? Regulatory uncertainty is not making it any easier. It's not the regulation. Regulation is mother of adoption, right? You give us a regulation, we'll all comply with it. That's a problem. I mean, that's what uniswap and Coinbase are asking, right? Like they have done everything by the book, but you tell us what to do, right? The problem comes when there is uncertainty, when even after doing buy the book, you get served a world's notice. So that doesn't help because now that scares companies away. They don't want to get into it.
05:00:29.238 - 05:01:05.834, Speaker A: Their p and l is billions of dollars. So for this extra hundred thousand k, they don't want that kind of headache. So I think that's beyond our hands. There are some people who are doing an exemplary job as far as moving the space forward in terms of regulatory compliance, in terms of moving lobbying for these rules. Hats off to them. We try and help when we can. What we can do is build relationships with these brands and show what crypto and crypto communities are capable of, what these users are capable of.
05:01:05.834 - 05:01:28.234, Speaker A: I mean, our partners have, have been just blown away with the kind of support that has come from our community. You were there. We launched the ASIC sneakers, the physical sneakers at breakpoint itself at Solana break point last year. They sold out in minutes. Minutes. And the mines were just blown. Like this could happen.
05:01:28.234 - 05:02:13.006, Speaker A: The fulfillment was not ready for this. And we'd repeat this and more with Adidas. Yeah, I think it's exciting to see stuff like the Adidas and Stepn partnership. I think for the community, even if you're not a stakeholder in something like Stepn, even if you're not a user, it's a powerful sentiment to see that and know that our industry is there and more partnerships like that will likely emerge. And also, speaking to a lot of attendees here today, a lot of students that are in high school, this generation is going to grow up. And even if they're not working for web3 projects, like you mentioned, many of these big brands already have web3 divisions. There's just going to be a lot of convergence there.
05:02:13.006 - 05:03:04.892, Speaker A: I think many people here who will, you know, potentially go off to college and go into the working world will find themselves working in web3 in some way. Even if you're working at a web two company, firstly, you're making me feel very, very old, these people. But secondly, couldn't agree more. Right? So just after how successful our first phase of Adidas partnership was, we're already talking about how to make things bigger. You know, first, brands are like, a little bit nervous, a little bit like, what's gonna happen? And then they see success and then they see the scale and then they see the possibilities, right? A completely new audience, new, new segment, new category unlocked for them, which pushes their agenda forward, right? All we're trying to do is make people run, walk, jog outdoors. That's pretty much what Adidas wants to do. And together we're trying to make that happen.
05:03:04.892 - 05:03:43.712, Speaker A: So once brands come to that realization, that financially, marketing wise, user wise, positioning wise, all we're trying to do is help. And we can help so much more than the other brands, if I may say. Yeah, I think that's a very positive kind of core mission, obviously, especially for the chronically online, which is likely everyone in this room I know, myself included, we have just a couple minutes left. About three minutes. So I would love to get big picture. 510 years long term vision. What do you want to do with Stepn? Where are you going? What are the hopes and dreams? What do you see for the next five to ten years? Wow.
05:03:43.712 - 05:04:21.084, Speaker A: Very existential question. Firstly, we're going to be here, right? When we launched stepn, I still remember 2020, 1st December, test flight 2020 to early people gave us months, right? Oh, this project, once again, once again, a hotbed will go away. Guess what? We're still here. A thriving community, thanks to you all. Multi chain infrastructure, technology, world class. And we've got partners, world class. We've got products, product partnerships and product things happening.
05:04:21.084 - 05:05:01.458, Speaker A: Like Apple play again, moving the industry forward. First in the industry. So whether it's been Apple pay, whether it's been adidas, whether it's launching our own Dex or marketplace or wallet id services service or new games, it feels like we have launched ten products in two years, right? Because it is. So the vision pretty much stays the same. We are very delivery action, execution oriented firm. We will continue to deliver value to our users and to the space. We will continue to work hard and we will continue to expand.
05:05:01.458 - 05:05:41.634, Speaker A: Yes, we may not get wrong, we may not get things right all the time, but as long as we reduce the probability of getting things wrong, we're on the right track. And that's where we are our north star is adoption. Bring as many people as possible to web3. And if that's not going to happen, we will take web3 to web two and we will make that happen. So, yeah, here, just a. So I'm going to take a note out of, out of Chris's book, who is moderating the last panel, and he kind of ended with this question of how long will it take to reach a billion users? I think his answer was six months. And someone else on the other end, it was seven years.
05:05:41.634 - 05:06:18.426, Speaker A: So that was sort of the spectrum. What's your out of pocket prediction for this question? I think the question will have to change a little. The web3 that we currently know, know sits pretty much at the fringe of tech. I don't want to get too geeky here, but the way technology will evolve will be a seamless boundary. There will be no web two, web3, kind of a web four kind of a thing. Like today, we don't sit and marvel, oh, wow, what a fascinating technology. Electricity is right, but everything runs on electricity.
05:06:18.426 - 05:07:01.860, Speaker A: This call, this room, our health infrastructure, governments, everything. So technology becomes mainstream once it fades away, once it goes in the backdrop. And that moment for blockchains is coming, right? When you log into base or binance these days with Paschis biometrics, you don't have to save your seed phrase, guess what? Everything is happening, right. The chain is integrated with the wallet, with the apps, and once the seamlessness comes in, once the infrastructure is getty, you will know the adoption has happened before you know it. And that Jack GPD moment for us is coming. It's coming. All right, well, thank you so much, sheeti.
05:07:01.860 - 05:07:42.820, Speaker A: That is our time and thank you to everyone here. But, yeah, thanks for joining us for this session. And I think maybe we'll hang over there if there's any questions, if any community, community members want to come and pick your brain a bit more. But thank you so much for your time and it was a great chatting with you. Thank you. Pleasure to be here. And Mia.
05:07:42.820 - 05:08:42.374, Speaker A: Now, from what is next for stepn, we're going to what is next for Marginfi. And it will give us a glimpse of into the future of Marginfi. And I'm inviting here Mark Brennan, Pete, co founder of the margin group, and he's going to be joined by Camilla Russo on the stage. Warm applause again. Thank you. All right, hi again, everyone. Super excited to talk here with McBrand and Pete, co founder of Marginfi, on what's next for Marginfi.
05:08:42.374 - 05:09:45.034, Speaker A: I'm Kami Russo, the founder of the Defiant, the best source of Defi news. So starting with just the basics on Marginfi, you're one of the biggest lenders on Solana. What differentiates you from other Defi lenders and what product has found the most fit with users? Yeah, so Marginfi is about margin lend, which is like, the lending component of marginfi is about a year old. In 2023, it was the fastest growing Defi product in the industry, like Solana Ethereum. And that's sort of like our foundation for what we're building at the protocol layer. At Marginfi. We have, like, a really defined thesis that unlike the crypto native terms, a borrow lend, a stablecoin, and a stable swap are the same product.
05:09:45.034 - 05:10:20.020, Speaker A: They should use the same liquidity, they should use the same risk, they should be the same ux. There's a ton of, like, capital efficiencies that come when you effectively combine these three products. And so margin lend is our start to that. Margin lend is our effective foundation for that. And in terms of, like, differentiation, I think it's very much a question of accessibility. So we have, like, three main work streams at Marginfi. One is expanding the protocol layer.
05:10:20.020 - 05:10:55.872, Speaker A: Two is expanding our developer ecosystem. So we now have, I think, 15 teams building, like, really dedicated, unique products on top of Marginfi that we're really focused on supporting. Like, some are coming out of stealth, some are like web two veterans that have built, like, viral apps when it comes to just like, the web two world. And then the third is like our application layer. Like, we have a lot of work we're doing at the application layer. And the accessibility comes. Like, you can use Marginfi right now just with your Google account, with your Apple account, with your email.
05:10:55.872 - 05:11:27.652, Speaker A: You don't need a crypto wallet. You don't even need to hold crypto before you use Marginfi. And that's already like a pretty distinct differentiation in terms of a lot of the Defi products out there. A lot of Defi products out there sort of just self serve to realistically, like, a group of like, 250,000 power users within Defi as a whole, which is tiny. Like, that's not scalable at all. And, like, we're very focused on sort of like, breaking outside of that. So I think accessibility is one.
05:11:27.652 - 05:12:09.848, Speaker A: And then also just like selection. Like, we have a really, really deep selection of assets at margin lend. So whatever assets you're holding, if they're a widely used asset on Solana, we probably offer that. Perfect. And just a quick follow up on the accessibility point. Do you think, realistically, do you think that users, outside of those hardcore 250,000 defi users, are using Marginfi right now? Or is it more of, like, you think so? Yeah, so we know so we've been. We've been tracking this pretty, pretty heavily.
05:12:09.848 - 05:12:58.844, Speaker A: We now have, like, some, like, interesting penetration with, like, early markets, just like, on a global scale. I think an easy way to encapsulate that is like, just ask yourself how many people in the world use a bank, right? And it's quite a lot of people, but it's also, like, very segmented towards the financial infrastructure in your region, like, the currencies that you hold. The cool thing about marginfi is it's sort of like, it's better than a bank in a lot of ways. Like, one, all you need is an Internet connection to use marginfi. You don't need like, a Social Security number or a passport number. Two, you can see everything that's happening with your money on Marginfi. With a bank, you can't.
05:12:58.844 - 05:13:30.344, Speaker A: Like, marginfi is open source, double audited, code verified, transparent. You can see where. Where your yield is coming from, from borrowers in a bank. You can't. Three, you can hold, like, stable currencies in margin Phi, right? You can hold like, the tokenized US dollar and get 11%, 20% over collateralized yield on that. A lot of people around the world don't have access to, like, a real stable currency, especially when it lines up to the US dollar. So that's really powerful.
05:13:30.344 - 05:13:50.862, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And so these things. These things already sort of show, like, just how powerful this is as a product. And so when you think of, like, all the people that have a bank account or something that acts similar to a bank account, in my mind, that is like our tam. Like, that's our. That's our addressable market. That's who we're.
05:13:50.862 - 05:14:32.110, Speaker A: We're trying to help. And it makes me really excited when, like, people outside of, like, people in countries where there's, like, the financial infrastructure isn't as great or the national currency isn't as. As stable, can benefit from Marginfi. Just, again, with an Internet connection and an email login or a crypto wallet. Yeah, no, absolutely. I agree with you that Defi is ten x, maybe 100 x better than a traditional bank. But I was wondering whether you have any evidence that people outside of that core web3 native group is using Marginfi right now, like in the future.
05:14:32.110 - 05:15:16.442, Speaker A: Yes, but, yeah, yeah, I mean, we have someone actually in the margin telegram, like, posted a photo, like, two days ago of him onboarding his dad to margin. Find his dad just being amazed of like, oh, my goodness, like, I can get 20% yield on tokenized us dollars, and I can see exactly what's happening. It's all over collateralized, and it's instant. I can move money out in a second. I don't have to wait three days to transfer it from, like, one account to the other. Right. So, yeah, we have, like, that, that was, that's just like, a very explicit example where, like, we have, we have, like, margin community people.
05:15:16.442 - 05:16:02.124, Speaker A: Yeah. Onboarding their, like, parents, which is, like, really, really cool to see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's the first thing toward getting, like, a normie quote unquote user is the crypto native users just onboarding their closest network to defi. Now switching gears a bit, Marginfi has recently gone through a very tumultuous period. Right. So you got to a peak of over 800 million TVL, but that dropped drastically to about half of that, around 400 million after one of your co founders left or stepped down, I think, following a disagreement over when or whether to issue a token.
05:16:02.124 - 05:16:32.584, Speaker A: So I'd love to chat a bit about that, like, what led to that outcome. Yeah, so there was a few things that happened. Like, one. One, yeah, my co founder left pretty abruptly, and so everyone just sort of captured a lot of attention. Like, Marginfi is, like, one of the most used defi applications, like, in the industry. So a lot of people, it had a lot of attention when that happened. The cool thing that happened, there's a few things that happened that are actually pretty amazing.
05:16:32.584 - 05:17:07.940, Speaker A: One, a lot of people who didn't have as much of an understanding of just the efficiencies that, like, on chain, like an on chain protocol brings, just withdrew their money because they were, like, they were unsure what's happening, and that money's already coming back in. Like, if you look at merchandise inflows, they've been net positive since that, since that incident. Two, something really cool. $300 million moved out of margin fi in a day. That is not possible in a bank. You can't move 300 million million dollars out of a bank in a day. You can't even move $300 million.
05:17:07.940 - 05:17:36.574, Speaker A: Outside of most, a lot of protocols, like, across crypto in a day, like, liquidations will fail. A lot of protocols explicitly don't allow that. They'll have withdrawal limits. Marginfi does not. This happened while Solana, I'm sure everyone here sort of remember Solana, is extremely congested as well. So from, like, a matter of landing transactions for like, liquidators and protocol solvency. This is like a really great time of just stress testing.
05:17:36.574 - 05:18:23.784, Speaker A: So this actually just showed how much more efficient marginfi is as a protocol, as a money market where you can move this money out in a day, everything can work seamlessly. Like, the people who, all the lenders who left their money in Marginfi were earning like, close to 80% yields at that time. And, yeah, and now inflows are coming in because the other thing is, marginfy is secured by a multisig. So one person can't affect marginfi, one person can't do anything to marginfi. It's sort of like this shared on chain program. So a lot of people that withdrew their money just didn't, just didn't understand that. And that's sort of like, on us to sort of like, effectively communicate, hey, one person, like, we're building a resilient system here.
05:18:23.784 - 05:19:26.116, Speaker A: One person has no control over what happens at the protocol layer. And then at the second point, there wasn't really any disagreements over token. Marginify is designed to be decentralized, to have a token to. Marginify is designed to sort of like, we're working really hard on building out our governance process behind the scenes, and we actually just take this really seriously. Like, we take the concept of governance and the concept of token ownership extremely seriously, and we're not as interested in just like, or the margin foundation isn't as interested in just like putting out a token for the sake of having a token, right? Like, we're interested in having a token where it means something and it has embedded real governance weight in the process. And so that's why we've been just very methodical about it. Margin's like a team of twelve.
05:19:26.116 - 05:20:19.232, Speaker A: I think I gotta count them up in my head. World class people from the brink of like HFT and cybersecurity and robotics and digital identity. It's like the SEAL team six of crypto, and we've kept very lean up to this point, and we're also just very focused of the effective work that a token brings to the formula, and we want to be able to hire into that as well, and be staffed for that and be prepared for that. So that's sort of like, those are just some of the things that are important to us and just transparently how we think about things. So great points that you made on the fact that people were able to withdraw 300 million, like, close to half of your TVL in one day. That already proves the resilience of defi yeah, and this was also wall. It was like four.
05:20:19.232 - 05:21:28.794, Speaker A: If you look on like a USD value chart, it's about 400 million that came out because this is also, while Solana was like spiking in price, it went from like $190 to like 120, $20 or something like that, $130, which is also like. That puts a lot of stress on our liquidation systems, our risk systems. Again, if this happened in a off chain, like lending protocol, this happened in a lot of, we saw with the regional banking crisis in the US, how when there was all this concern about, about liquidity and collateral and so on, people were not able to withdraw money from their bank accounts. Exactly. So, I mean, we already have that example very recently of what happens in tradfi when a crisis goes down. But so if it wasn't questions about the token, I mean, that's what the co founder that left had said very publicly and sometimes a bit aggressively, that that's why he left. So not to dwell too much on the past, but just to understand what that conflict was all about.
05:21:28.794 - 05:21:53.790, Speaker A: So why did he leave so abruptly? Yeah, I think that's just like what he wanted, essentially. I think he just wanted to, like, it's really stressful. Like, this is a 24/7 job. There's no weekends in building an on chain finance protocol. And so. Yeah, like, it's stressful, essentially. Okay.
05:21:53.790 - 05:22:29.374, Speaker A: Okay. So things got, like, too much, I guess, for him, or. Potentially. Yeah, okay, got it. Okay. And to clarify on the token point, then, you definitely are planning a token, you said, but you want to do it in the right way. So, like, are there specific milestones that you're waiting to hit or like, what, what's the roadmap that you're looking at there? Yeah, so token is sort of like the domain of the margin foundation, which is set up and operating at the protocol layer.
05:22:29.374 - 05:23:09.054, Speaker A: Again, we have three main work streams that we're really focused on at the whole margin layer. At the protocol layer, our decentralized, stablecoin stable asset yield accruing stable asset will be coming out target this month. We just wrapped up our second audit, so we got it audited by otter, Sec and Sec three, which are like two of the best in the business. Yeah. And so we're pretty ready to go. There's been a ton of demand for this, so we have about 12 million of initial committed bootstrap locations. Liquidity for this.
05:23:09.054 - 05:23:48.256, Speaker A: And, like, we want to get this up over like 100 million. Where's that liquidity coming from? It's coming from just a lot of big Solana power users, essentially, like people who. People who. So just to give an overview of, like, Solana and why this, this, this is so needed, Solana Defi as a whole right now is like, completely reliant on USDC. If USDC de pegged like it did did like, a year ago and stayed deep, Solana Defi would be in a really rough spot. USDC underlines all major trading pairs. And so Solana really doesn't have like, a decentralized stablecoin that's widely used throughout the ecosystem.
05:23:48.256 - 05:24:26.114, Speaker A: And it also doesn't have a yield accruing, rebasing stable assets. Something where just like, LST is accrue value against Sol, YBX is going to accrue value against USD. And we now have hundreds of millions of dollars in lsts, in Marginfi that will be able to mint YBX day one. So YBX will be collateralized by the LST's lent into marginfi from minters. And so this is like, this is really exciting. Also, just another thing. If you have 100% of your stablecoin exposure in USDC and USDC to pegs 100% of your portfolio depex.
05:24:26.114 - 05:24:55.842, Speaker A: Right? And you can't really rebalance that portfolio into Dai or fracs, for example, which are to, like, Ethereum native stable coins. Because DAi and Frax are collateralized by USC, they also use USDC. Right. So this will be an effective diversification to USDC. Like, YBX will be collateralized by Solana lsts only to start. So, a, this will be like, you'll be able to diversify your state stablecoin exposure with this. B, you'll be actually natively capturing the monetary policy of Solana itself.
05:24:55.842 - 05:25:36.194, Speaker A: You'll be capturing the staking yields, the MEV capture, and soon the lending yields and margin phi that'll be naturally rebased to YBX and three YBX. Like, there's already some major protocols and dexs on Solana that are looking to use YBX as like, a main margin asset. So you'll be able to use it in a bunch of places. So target this month, we just wrapped up. Yeah, second audit again, auto second sec, three. And we want to get it effectively bootstrapped and we want to do this right. And then soon after YBX, we're going to introduce.
05:25:36.194 - 05:26:19.038, Speaker A: This is something. So, again, like our thesis at the protocol layer is borrow lend a stable coin and a stable swap are the same thing. We're going to introduce crypto's first ever, what we're calling an integrated stable swap, where the existing liquidity and margin Phi you can use to move between. If someone wants to swap from like USDC to USDT, for example, or to YBX, you can use the existing liquidity in marginfi to do that, which is really cool. So that means for a lender, you're not only earning lending interest, you're also earning some swapping fees on top of that. So like a first in its class product that'll come out this year as well. That's really just what's in front of us at the protocol layer.
05:26:19.038 - 05:27:00.056, Speaker A: Again, at the developer layer, some teams are going to be coming out of stealth soon, and we've been working with some public teams as well. We want to continue to reinforce that we have a lot of support available for that. And then at the application layer, we're very focused in turning margins into like, a native mobile app. So we want people, a native mobile app that, again, you don't need to use a wallet to access. So anywhere in the world can get access to incredible over collateralized stable rates just using their email address to sign in or whatever. And it's still all on chain, it's still all transparent, it's protocolized, it's audited, it's open source. I think that's a really powerful, powerful product.
05:27:00.056 - 05:27:30.736, Speaker A: Awesome. I have a few, like, quick follow ups. So you talked about YBX, your stable coin that you're looking to launch this month. Do you have a separate governance token that you also want to launch, or will the stablecoin be marginfize main token? No. So the protocol, like, what we're building at the protocol layer is, again, like this. Unified borrow lends stablecoin stable swap. So margins governance token will have governance across all three primitives.
05:27:30.736 - 05:28:16.994, Speaker A: Okay, got it. Okay. And then this. The fact that you're only banking this stablecoin with lsts definitely introduces some risk. Right, because you're relying on the value of the LST to actually stay pegged to Seoul. How are you mitigating that risk? Yeah, so it's similar to if you were borrowing USDC against an LST on Solana, right? Like, if the collateral value of your LST goes down according to, in respect to the value that you've borrowed in USDC, at a certain threshold, you open yourself up to liquidation. It's the same sort of thing.
05:28:16.994 - 05:28:50.014, Speaker A: So based on how collateralized you are with YBX, you're much more protected against liquidation. And also, you know, like, I, like we as a team, like, we really believe in sort of long term success of Solana defi. And so we see Solana as like, a really great form of collateral over a long time horizon. So. And our systems are ready for that. Like, again, we saw Solana go from, again, 190 to, like, 130 at a high point of salon of blockchain congestions. And our risk systems handled it perfectly.
05:28:50.014 - 05:29:17.638, Speaker A: Yeah, we're super prepared for the ups and downs that, you know, Solana will have moving forward. And as I understand those, those staking yields will be accrued directly to the stablecoin holder. Like, you don't need to stake it anywhere. Like, it'll, it'll just be rebased. You'll just have it in your wallet and you'll watch the value rise against. That's pretty original. A lot of the yield accruing stable coins, you need to stake them in order to accrue yield.
05:29:17.638 - 05:30:08.684, Speaker A: So that's pretty cool. Okay. And then as we start to wrap up, like, when I see the, when I hear about, like, the longer term vision for marginfi and how the stablecoin is of it, like, do you view YVX as the hopefully becoming, like, the default stable coin for the Solana ecosystem? Like, where does margin five fit in the broader Solana and broader blockchain ecosystem? Yeah, I think, I mean, Solana as an ecosystem will have room for centralized stable coins and decentralized stable coins. And that's good. That's like a form of redundancy, and that's, like, good for risk and it's like, it's a healthy thing. I think YBX will be, Solana's like, decentralized stablecoin. Like, that's what I, that's what I want it to be.
05:30:08.684 - 05:30:55.040, Speaker A: And, yeah, we have, like, super high hopes for it and, yeah, I'm just like, I'm just, yeah, I'm super excited for it. Some of the, like, scaling challenges that, on the Ethereum side, decentralized stablecoins have, have faced is that, you know, you only get so much collateral available when you're only relying on, like, crypto native assets. So that's why DAi started incorporating USDC and, like, real world assets. And so how do you, how do you think about that problem? Yeah, I hope to quickly run into that problem. Like, that's like a, that's just like a healthy capacity problem. We're very focused on starting with lsts, but, yeah, absolutely. That doesn't mean we can't expand outside that.
05:30:55.040 - 05:31:44.346, Speaker A: And there's a lot of other options as well, outside of just like USDT or USDC, for example, in terms of forms of collateral. So we'll absolutely, like, given we execute well with YBX, we'll hit that point. But like, I'm just excited to have that problem essentially. And we'll expand the collateral set and we'll continue to grow ybxx and, yeah, that'll just be a good thing. Awesome. And then more broadly for margin fi, you know, you're building this app that doesn't need a crypto that hopefully like everyone can use. And you have this pretty unique take on just combining swaps, lending and possibly like payments with, with a stable bitcoin.
05:31:44.346 - 05:32:41.666, Speaker A: So do you, I mean, how do you think marginfight can transition from being like a Solana native defi app to just like a fintech that anyone can use globally? Yeah, I think it's nailing. That's why we're so focused on the application layer, like a mobile experience that doesn't require any prior crypto knowledge or assets or a wallet to sign in which were already sort of there. You can use Marginfi today as a progressive web app on your phone. So you can download it from your mobile browser and you can sign in with Google or Apple or your password, and then your wallet is set up and you can have it as like a pretty native app already. You know, iOS or Android on your phone. We're just missing like, people who are very, very accustomed to the flow of like, going to the app store to download things. And so, yeah, we want to hit that.
05:32:41.666 - 05:33:23.134, Speaker A: But given we turn margin Phi, like, also enable, like, native application downloads, we're like 80% of the way there. In terms of, like, it being like a true fintech app. Because at that point, yeah, you can sort of do all those things. You already can do all those things. It's just, it's just a pwi instead of like a native app. Yeah. So what are kind of a couple of things that are missing that will get you to 100% there? Yeah, so I think a lot of what's missing is just more effective communication on, like, why margin fi is so much different and better in like, sort of like the optimized way of do like having a money market.
05:33:23.134 - 05:34:18.474, Speaker A: Like having something that's like, acts like a, similar to a bank account on your phone. That's what we're super focused on. It just comes with a lot of, there's a time element to it, there's a communication element to it, and there's also just like, as we onboard more and more people who are outside of crypto in terms of like native on chain users, it becomes an easier sell to more and more people outside of crypto crypto because like their friends are using it, their family's using it. Yeah, like leaning into that natural growth process is something we're pretty focused on. Awesome, super interesting stuff. So I think it's great to see projects focusing on how to get non crypto natives to use their dapps so that DeFi just becomes finance down the line. Yeah, 100%.
05:34:18.474 - 05:35:22.754, Speaker A: So thanks so much, McBrennon. Thanks everyone. Thank you McBrennen. And now next I want to introduce you mister Bobby Ong, co founder of Coingecko, and this is an analytics platform for tracking cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets. And Coingecko was established in 2014 and is the largest independent cryptocurrency data aggregator in the world. Chatting with him is going to be George Harrop and let's give them a warm welcome. Thank you.
05:35:22.754 - 05:36:01.414, Speaker A: What's up everyone? We're going to be talking more coins, maybe a little bit of defi here and there, but with my good friend Bobby. How are you, Bobby? Very good. We're excited to be here and see a room full of audience. Excited for this conference. Absolutely. Bobby and I have known each other for I don't know how many years now, like five or six, probably longer, probably longer, I guess. Yeah, Hong Kong days.
05:36:01.414 - 05:36:31.226, Speaker A: But look, Bobby, Coingecko, I mean Coingecko doesn't really need much, much introduction, but maybe to set the scene there for people. What's Coingecko? How did you get started? Yeah, maybe sort of start with the origin story and we'll get into it. Yeah, sure. Happy to share. So yeah, my name is Bobby, I'm the co founder of Coingecko, started Coingecko ten years ago. So it's been a, a long journey in the crypto industry. I've seen the ups and downs, little bit of what we do.
05:36:31.226 - 05:36:54.242, Speaker A: Coingecko is a crypto data aggregator. We have two products right now, coingecko.com and Gecko terminal.com dot. So we basically track price, market cap, trading volume of cryptocurrencies. There's about 11,000 coins on Coingecko and Gecko terminal. We track over 150 different chains, 11,000 dexs, decentralized exchanges.
05:36:54.242 - 05:37:25.912, Speaker A: That's insane. Close to 3 million tokens. So yeah, that's what we do. We basically help you track your favorite token. Yeah, yeah, I mean Coinkecko is kind of the place to go and always has been, I think for many years of if you need info on a coin like where do you go? And it's going to be probably one of the first ones on Google and it's one of the first places to list the data about the coin. I mean I use it all the time. I think I have a tab that's been permanently on my browser for years or something where it's like you know, market cap, price supply and all that sort of stuff.
05:37:25.912 - 05:38:17.226, Speaker A: And you get that directly from all of these different chains. Yeah, so it depends, I mean previously when we started Coingecko there was no such thing as decentralized exchanges, there was only centralized exchanges. And we basically get the API from the centralized exchanges, put them together, remove the outliers and then kind of do a volume weighted average price on Coingecko. But I think with decentralized exchanges, with the rise of smart contract platforms, Solana being one of the big ones these days, we start seeing a lot of decentralized exchanges coming up and now there's a big competition between centralized and decentralized exchanges. So getting data from decentralized exchanges isn't the easiest thing. There is no central party to give you an API and to help you with the data. So when we ask all these decentralized exchanges hey, can you give us data? And all we get an answer is you all just read it from the chain.
05:38:17.226 - 05:39:20.846, Speaker A: So got to get some developers to kind of work on reading data from the chain, getting it and combining the data from the centralized exchanges to kind of get the real price data for each coin. Well, and one of the problems is that this data is not standardized, right? Like you guys when you're saying that you're pulling from centralized exchanges, dexs everywhere else and we'll get to gecko terminal in a moment. But it's kind of like you guys are the only ones doing the hard work. Someone's got to do the hard work of formatting all of this data into some common place where it resides. And I think you sell APIs and other different kind of stuff to people. But I mean how is that as a business? Is it difficult to scale, is it problematic long term? I mean there's always a new thing coming out, right? So I guess your team like you have to have people whose ready to go on, oh, the next l two is dropping or the new chain has come out, we need to support it. Is that a difficult problem to manage? Yeah, yeah, so I talk a little bit about centralized exchanges first before we get into decentralized exchanges.
05:39:20.846 - 05:40:21.456, Speaker A: And for centralized exchanges we get a rest API and then actually just like binance or backpack or Kraken and so on, they return an endpoint and what they return is BTC slash USDT for example. Well, can't really assume that BTC, I mean, I guess you can for BTC, but you can just take any tickers, h o t or Fet or step for example. Different exchanges have different conventions. Like some exchanges refer to bitcoin as BTC, but some exchanges refer to them in the ISO standard, which is XBT. Yes, I was going to say some exchanges have three characters limits. So instead of calling it USDT, they call it ust, for example. So what happens is it's kind of a very manual process, so somebody on our team's got to verify that, hey, this ticker, SDEP for example, refers to step finance, and then we got to map them and approve them.
05:40:21.456 - 05:41:29.424, Speaker A: We used to kind of map things automatically, but as we see more and more tokens coming out, there were a lot of tokens sharing the similar symbol and we end up having clashes and end up wrongly mapping things. So that's where things get difficult, especially on a Dex, right? Where a Dex, anyone can launch a coin, you can make 100 crossroads coins tomorrow if you want on a Dex, but then what's the real one, right? And Coingecko, I guess you guys have to sift through or go through some process or have some criteria of determining if there are mismatches or if there's maybe existing coins which are well known but the data is wrong, like the supply or this kind of stuff. Yeah, I mean, as much as I like to automate everything and not have people manually reviewing things, that's not really possible because of all these situations. The DExs are interesting because everybody's looking at the contract addresses, but contract addresses are unique. Every different token have its own contract address. The hard part is you may have the same name but different contract addresses. And you have a lot of situations being phishing scam spam tokens.
05:41:29.424 - 05:42:01.146, Speaker A: I mentioned that's close to 3 million tokens that we track on gecko terminal, but probably 90% are spam or scam tokens. How do you separate? Because it's so easy to create a token these days. Anybody could kind of clicks. Create a new clicks basically. Yeah. Well look, I mean Coingecko has been around for many years now and that means that you've navigated many bear markets as well. So I mean, I guess is it different every time? Are there challenges that are new each time? Or are you just so weathered to it now that, okay, another two year bear market or, hey, a two years bull market or something like that.
05:42:01.146 - 05:43:10.928, Speaker A: Like that changes how you operate as a company or what's been, I guess you're learning for the bear market so far. Yeah, I think one of the things is we always, like, during the bull market, you just feel a lot of pressure, pressure to kind of, because everything's growing so fast and so quickly that you always feel that we are understaffed, and there's a temptation to just kind of over hire people. But then when we do that, like, we know that that's going to come biting back at us during the bear market, and as much as we can not try to do layoffs. So the hard part about scaling in crypto is that the peak and the trials has, like, extreme ends. Unlike a traditional business where you can kind of predictably grow your revenue or your hit count, like, 1015 percent per annum, like, in crypto, you see, like 400%, 500% increase in one year, and then the next year, it falls down 70, 80%. So that's the challenge in crypto. And always we try to maintain a large margin of safety over here, like, you know, have sufficient cash to kind of weather through the bear market, so that we just don't want to be.
05:43:10.928 - 05:43:31.176, Speaker A: I mean, the idea is to be a cockroach, I suppose. Don't. Just don't get liquidated. I suppose if you're not out of business, you survive another cycle to kind of leave another day. Unfortunately, we see many people in crypto have a very short term mindset. They get too leveraged or they just too optimistic, and then during the bear market, just can't survive and just get liquidated, I suppose. I mean, that's what it's about.
05:43:31.176 - 05:43:53.224, Speaker A: It's about survival, right? Survival mode. Sometimes during these crazy sort of market cycles. Another thing, I guess, to compete with as well is data itself. In the crypto world. It's kind of a commodity in that, okay, binance has an API, or whoever has an API, this Dex has an API, or you can get it from the chain somehow. Okay. Everyone can do that.
05:43:53.224 - 05:44:38.554, Speaker A: So how do you guys maintain relevance? And is it a case of, okay, you were just there first, and then, okay, you have a bit of a moat, or is it like a. I don't know. How do you think about that? Is it a constant battle? Yeah, those are interesting questions. How do you differentiate yourself when all the data is available on chain and is accessible to anyone out there? So it's a question that we ask ourselves because then anyone can come along tomorrow and hey, we got a flashy new coin gecko thing that does all of this kind of stuff. And then, okay, now you have to compete with this new person, right? Yeah, there's a few things I suppose. One is you probably have to build your community, build a niche, build something that is not available in the market. You alluded earlier as well.
05:44:38.554 - 05:45:24.448, Speaker A: Do you have a group of people trying to track and add new chains, new coins? So we try to do that as well, try to be early into the game and not be late, I suppose. The funny thing is, off chain data is surprisingly important. Despite the fact that everything's on chain, everything's available, people still want some of these off chain data and doing that well is important as well. So yeah, those are some of the things. I think the interesting thing about crypto is that this industry is not a static industry. It constantly changes. If you, or if we just kind of stay where we are and don't innovate, we'll be irrelevant pretty quickly.
05:45:24.448 - 05:45:57.926, Speaker A: So we have to constantly stay up to date, know what's the latest meta and kind of innovate from there on. Yeah, and it seems like the way to go is as you said, in a bull market you want to be making the money and during a bear market you want to be stashing the money so that you can survive. Right. But the revenue model of Coingecko, tell us about how that works. So you have APIs that you, you sell, you have all of this data of everything. You also have the Gecko terminal as a separate product to the sort of, I guess the coingecko.com main page and you have all the different stats and stuff like that.
05:45:57.926 - 05:46:36.254, Speaker A: And okay, maybe you can make money on advertising or something like that, but what are the sort of revenue streams that you look at and are you able to share any breakdown like what works and what doesn't? Yeah, sure. So in summary, there are two ways how Coingecko makes money. Traditionally we've been making money while advertising. And that was kind of like the, maybe the only way or the majority of our revenue source was some advertising. So we get, I mean, Coine Gecko gets a lot of traffic, a few hundred million page views per month. And a lot of crypto companies want to tap on the audience that Coingecko has. So they advertise on the Coinkecko website.
05:46:36.254 - 05:47:11.596, Speaker A: So, but in the last couple of years we've also grown our API data subscription business. So that's been like it's a more software as a service kind of business, and that's kind of a second way how we grow our revenue. So it's more diversified from advertising and also data subscription. We tried a couple of other things as well, but some of them haven't really worked out. We used to have a premium subscription. I mean, you still have it, but hasn't really had as much traction compared to this data or advertising. I say new, but it's been around for a few years now.
05:47:11.596 - 05:48:03.024, Speaker A: Gecko Terminal, right? How did that product come about? Because I mean, you guys were known for many years of, okay, we're, the web page has all of the information and everything, and then you guys are like, let's have a Bloomberg type terminal thing. Why was that? What was the decision for that? Yeah, one of the things that we realized is because Coingecko takes a cure rated approach. Like we have to list tokens on the Coingecko website. That means somebody on our team have to go and manually edit and check and verify all the tickers. No matter how fast we try to add the tokens, we can't compete against something that adds a token. Prices automatically, instantly, from the moment a first trade takes place on the DeX. So we knew that as more and more people trade on decentralized exchanges and we start seeing more and more people move towards Defi, there will be more tokens created on Defi.
05:48:03.024 - 05:48:47.262, Speaker A: More. It's so easy to create a liquidity pool on Defi compared to, you know, asking a centralized exchange to, to create a market for it. We knew that we need to build something to kind of stay relevant. And I think the decision to invest in this Gecko terminal a couple of years ago is prone. True, because previously there was only Ethereum and there was a smart contract platform as a smartphone contract platform, and there was Uniswap as the only DeX. But fast forward two years later, we now have over 150 different layer one, L2 layer 311 thousand dexs, most of them forks and nearly 3 million coins. And what wouldn't surprise me is we start seeing 1000 smart contract platforms by the end of this year.
05:48:47.262 - 05:49:10.358, Speaker A: I mean, we are talking about Solana SVM L2, for example. I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon. But as Solana scale, maybe we start seeing more and more l two s or so on as well. But it's happening really rapidly on the Ethereum and the cosmos ecosystem. For now. Yeah, yeah. I guess there's some chains that maybe you need to make a decision, like, for example, Cosmos, right? So, Cosmos, it has all these different app chains.
05:49:10.358 - 05:49:40.434, Speaker A: And do you have the decision where it's like, do I support all of them, or do I just have to pick some which are the most important? But then how, how do I determine the most important? Is it based on TVL? Is it based on users demanding it or something like. And then you just have a team, like, yo, discord. Yeah. Can you support this? Or something like that? Yeah, that's always a hard question. I mean, there's so many different chains. In the ideal world, we'll track everything, all the chains or the Dexs or the tokens, but the reality is, resources are limited. We have to pick and choose.
05:49:40.434 - 05:50:02.720, Speaker A: So generally we choose the chains or the dexes that have, you know, where the users are. The one with the highest TVL, highest transaction count, trading volume. And then we have to just prioritize. It's the same for Dexs as well. Like, not all Dexs work the same. Like, for some, like, uniswap, it's very easy. We just plug and play.
05:50:02.720 - 05:50:53.564, Speaker A: We can support them. But like, for most of the Solana Dexs as well, we just have to, you know, put in the resources to kind of R and D and figure out how it works to kind of get the data on chain. So it's a matter of prioritization. Yeah, and you mentioned before, like, some of the decisions around Gecko terminal was kind of driven by a lot of the stuff happening with Defi and Dexs. And maybe the shift towards there, is that a shift that you're seeing? Is that a real thing? I mean, of anyone in pretty much the entire world, you're probably best suited to make that judgment. Right, because you see everything. So do you think that Dexs, I mean, what percentage of volume are they? I don't know if you know, off the top of your head, but, like, are you seeing more focus on that, more volume? Do you think we're going to get to a world where everyone's just trading on Dexs? So, I mean, if you look at based purely on trading volume, I think the centralized exchanges still have alliance share of it.
05:50:53.564 - 05:51:20.420, Speaker A: I mean, if you look at perps, spot market perps is a different story. Central exchanges like perps are even way smaller on Defi. But if you think about it, if you look at, like, I guess lending, like, not many lenders exist now that are centralized, and I guess all of that now happens on Defi. Yeah. So maybe there's some things that do more and for spot market is still a lot on. I think. I think a lot of the market makers, and they drive most of the volume on centralized exchanges.
05:51:20.420 - 05:52:09.560, Speaker A: They find it easier to kind of, you know, set limit orders and kind of trade there. But on, on, on, maybe on Phoenix trade, you can kind of do that on Solana, but, like, on, on radium and so on. Amm model is kind of hard, but it's still cheap on Solana, so you could kind of do that. But I think if you look at the state of Defi or state of decentralized exchanges, like three years ago and compared to where we are today, and I look at the various chains as well, like, it's so much easier to trade on the Dex these days, especially on Solana, especially on a mobile wallet. Yeah, I think metamask on Ethereum, on mobile, still a pretty clunky behavior. But phantom wallet on Solana, I think, works perfectly, and it's cheap and fast as well. So I think I'm seeing a lot of trend of people, especially meme coins as well.
05:52:09.560 - 05:52:30.868, Speaker A: I mean, it's not that people want to trade meme points, and the reality is. Oh, that's not me. There we go. Someone's answered the call. Hello? Yes, Bobby, you're there. Okay, thanks, guys. Yeah, people want to trade meme coins, but you can't find these meme coins on centralized exchanges.
05:52:30.868 - 05:53:06.894, Speaker A: They're all on dexs. So you're kind of forced to use Dex if you want to trade this hottest new coin. And that's where the traders people have learned to use wallets. No matter how clunky or hard they are, somehow they've learned how to do it. I think it was the NFT stuff, right? So everyone, at least prior to NFTs, the general consensus was, oh, defi is too hard to use. Nobody understands wallets, nobody understands seed phrases, blah, blah, blah, user base never going to grow. But then millions of people came to buy pictures of dogs on the Internet.
05:53:06.894 - 05:53:51.068, Speaker A: And all of that NFT traction was not delivered by centralized exchanges. It was all defi stuff, new dexes that set up. So maybe the barriers that we thinker, barriers, or maybe not barriers. What do you think? Yeah, you're right. I think with a strong enough incentive, in this case, the chance to make money, people go through the hard path of educating themselves on how to use a wallet and how to stay safe online. Like, they may have to go through a few pain of, like, losing some of their coins and nfTs, but eventually they learn and they get better out of it. And the best part about Defi is once you onboard somebody into DeFi, it benefits the entire ecosystem as a whole.
05:53:51.068 - 05:54:50.976, Speaker A: I guess, you know, one of the, so another thing that's important is customer discovery, right? It's like how does a new person, like what I've, what I've done in the past is I might introduce someone new to crypto and I'll link them to a coingecko page of that coin, right. And then they'll look around and they'll see like all of these other different coins. And to, for them it's like, oh, there's like 10,000 different things. Are they all the same? But they're not all the same, right? And what are maybe some of the metrics that you think people should be looking for? Or like, I know you guys also like itemize things, right? So you have all the Solana tokens, like tagged as Solana, right? Or all the Dexs like tags as Dexs. So are there sort of ways that you think that maybe new people into the ecosystem, how they can make sense of seeing 10,000 different coins and trying to make a decision on what should they look at? Because there's a lot of things competing for that attention. Yeah, I think gone were the days where you could kind of realistically know everything that's happening in crypto. And I think these days you just have to pick a niche and then go deep into it.
05:54:50.976 - 05:55:34.606, Speaker A: So it could be like Solana ecosystem and going to know. Or maybe your niche is Solana meme coins, for example, and then go deep into all the meme coins that's happening. Solana, why is with a more interesting coin than bong, for example, why is we more interesting than paypay, for example? So I think those are the niches. Looking at categories on Coingecko is probably a good place to start to kind of dive deeper into some of the various chains. We create categories. We have the defi category, NFT category, AI category, deep in whatever. There's so many categories and it's all about picking a niche and going deep into it.
05:55:34.606 - 05:56:44.950, Speaker A: And do you guys, I guess it comes back to the questions earlier, but is there a way for you to automate the screening of that, or it's sort of manual and you guys are sort of tagging things at the moment, it's still very manual. Are we thinking of it like for example, like if there's an Inu in the coin name is probably a dot coin, for example. But I mean coins, I mean like how do we tag defi or NFT or AI, like it's hard, you can't really tell it from a coin name. Probably have to start thinking about there's no good ways. Yeah, yeah. And I guess another important factor for growing a business like Coingecko is hiring, right? And firing, you know, finding the right people. And you've been around for many years so I mean you hiring and firing and these sorts of things, how do you look for someone who would be good working in this ecosystem and what do you think, what are the qualities or what are the type of roles that you guys are sort of either recruiting for or looking for? I think the hard part about hiring, I mean we set a pretty high bar for ourselves in hiring and for us, someone wants to join.
05:56:44.950 - 05:57:40.774, Speaker A: Coingecko needs to, to sort of meet these two criteria. One is you got to have the technical skills, I mean if you're an engineer or a marketeer or a product person you've got to be good at your craft. For example, if you're not good as an engineer there's no point working as a software engineer in Coingecko. The second thing that's important as well is you've got to have an interest in crypto. You might not need to be that deep into crypto, obviously being deep is better, but you need to at least have some interest, probably have exchange account you bought or sold some coins before. Are you asking people that like on the job interview or something? And yeah, I asked everybody that I interviewed tell me about your crypto experience, tell me how far deep have you gone into your crypto experience? And if someone says like I don't know anything about crypto then like you probably not a good fit at Coingecko. I mean the fact that you are applying to a crypto company, you should probably already have done some research into crypto as well.
05:57:40.774 - 05:58:49.880, Speaker A: The other question that we ask as well, and I find this pretty useful is that at the end of every interview we have a question that we ask ourselves, does this person raise the bar? It's a yes no question. If the answer is no then why are we looking to hire this guy? Are we hiring this guy? Because we are desperate for bodies to kind of solve the problem. If that's the case then are we making a decision that we will probably regret in a few months time because we have a wrong cultural fit. So once we have this raise the bar question, the interesting thing is we notice that the people that we bring in, although slower but the quality have gone up significantly over the time. And I guess you can easily screen out if people, people are talking nonsense when they come and they use a lot of buzzwords, like we've all seen, I think, in the past, crypto likes to invent buzzwords, you know, oh, metaverse, oh defi, oh, this and that. And sometimes the buzzwords are real, and sometimes a lot of projects just make up new words for things and that sort of stuff. Right.
05:58:49.880 - 05:59:14.300, Speaker A: So I guess if someone's in buzzword city, you can easily determine that. I mean, using buzzwords are okay, but like, what does it mean? Like, I'll probably dig a little bit deeper. Okay. If you use the password, like metaverse. So, like, tell me more about which metaverse you've used. Which one? What did you do? Yeah, what do you do? Like, if you just, if you just know the password, you probably just jam and just fumble at a question and it's pretty obvious. Yeah.
05:59:14.300 - 06:00:11.210, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, look, we are about a few more minutes to go, but what are you most excited about this coming year? Is there any sort of things that, I mean, I guess we're almost halfway through the year now, aren't we? Geez, that's coming, coming pretty quickly. But what are you most excited for? Maybe at Coingecko or just in general in crypto, like we seem to have, I guess, in the last six to seven months, turned the corner of a bear market into a bull market again, which is great. And that means, like, we've spoken, people and panelists before have said, look, numbers go up, more user base comes in, protocols becomes profitable, and so on. But what are you sort of looking forward to the rest of this year? Yeah, I always have this vision that anything that can be tokenized will be tokenized. And I'm so excited to see, like, so many different things being tokenized now. In this cycle, a lot of people are tokenizing attention, meme coins being one way of attention.
06:00:11.210 - 06:00:57.494, Speaker A: We see politifi, satire, tokens coming out, and that's kind of like a proxy of the us elections at the end of the year. That's very interesting stuff. I think rwas are interesting. We start seeing people tokenizing watches, whiskey bottles, and all kinds of interesting things. Do you think they would get traction? Because remember back in the day, maybe four years ago or something, people were talking about tokenizing a lot of real world stuff, or supply chains or something like that. It never really happened, but I guess we are seeing the RWA kind of stuff, like us treasury bills or something like that, or etherfuser in the audience somewhere tokenizing bonds. Do you think that this time around, we're actually going to make more progress on these sorts of things.
06:00:57.494 - 06:01:23.264, Speaker A: Yeah. I think from a few years ago, defi infrastructure wasn't really there, so it doesn't really support. Why would you want to tokenize something, for example? But I think with the lending protocols being more mature now, let's say I have a Rolex watch, for example, that I don't wear that. I saw it in a, you know, have it custody somewhere. Well, I can. How do I make do with it? I don't want to sell the watch. I can kind of tokenize it.
06:01:23.264 - 06:01:51.596, Speaker A: And then I get, like. And then I get that NFT or something like that. And then I put it into a lending protocol, and then I draw a $10,000 loan, which I then use to speculate on meme coins, for example. So that, I think could be an interesting use case. Wasn't really possible three, four years ago, but now it's very possible. So, yeah, that's one case, I think socio five and game five has a lot of interesting use cases. We start seeing a lot of these things coming out as well.
06:01:51.596 - 06:02:26.754, Speaker A: So those are very interesting things. Yeah. And we're at a Solana conference, I guess. So I would have to ask some sort of Solana question for you guys, adding Solana. I mean, you had Solana pools for many years now. Is that a focus for you guys, or are you sort of seeing that there's a lot of interest or traction in that area? Yes. Solana is, I think, the meta for this cycle, if you think about it, everybody was on Ethereum and uniswap trading meme coins on Uniswap, like two years ago, three years ago.
06:02:26.754 - 06:03:02.624, Speaker A: But I think this cycle is firmly on Solana. And, I mean, there's a lot of challenges on Solana data, but it's important. We have to figure out how to make this work. The interesting thing that I saw on Solana is that people, the retail traders, are trading on Solana because the fees are low. People are trading $510 of coins on Solana, things that are not possible on Ethereum. Yeah. And as well, there were some people before talking about mobile.
06:03:02.624 - 06:03:33.404, Speaker A: I have the Coingecko app. I'm sure many people do here in the audience as well. What percentage of user base is maybe mobile versus web? Or is that something, are you seeing maybe more interest in mobile with the Solana phone? Anatoly is trying to make a bet on. Okay, mobile is going to be the future. Everyone has a mobile. There's billions of them around the world, they're all connected to the Internet, but often we don't do crypto stuff on them. I mean, for step, it's like 20% or something like that.
06:03:33.404 - 06:04:02.568, Speaker A: But maybe we should be doing more. Maybe there's certain products, maybe the NFTs are more predisposed to that. But I guess for you guys at Coingecko, is mobile a focus area for you guys or. How do you think about that? Yeah. Increasingly over the years, we start seeing mobile gaining more and more traction. The mobile apps, a very important piece for Coingecko. We found that users who have downloaded the Coingecko mobile app are more engaged than users who are using the Coingecko website, for example.
06:04:02.568 - 06:04:32.524, Speaker A: So it's definitely more important. I think Solana is definitely going on the right direction when it comes to UX because I never really trade on Ethereum on my mobile. It's practically not possible, very hard to use. But I can be lying on my bed on a Friday night just before going to sleep at midnight and just buying a meme coin on my phantom wallet on my mobile. And I've done it a few times and I love it. It's something that I can't do on Ethereum. I wish I could do it, but only Solana could do it.
06:04:32.524 - 06:04:53.784, Speaker A: And I think Solana has got the direction right to focus on, on mobile. Yeah. And we saw earlier this morning, I think we did a show of hands in the crowd. How many people have used Jupyter and probably most of people put your hand up if you've used some crypto thing on mobile in general. Okay. That's a lot of people. Right.
06:04:53.784 - 06:05:22.450, Speaker A: So I think mobile seems to be something that is the right play here coming up to time. But where should people go to find out more about Coingecko? I know that you guys do little competitions and cool little things here and there, but where should people go to find out more? Yeah, I mean coingecko.com on your website or open your iOS or Android store and download the Coingecko app. Awesome. There we go. Well, Bobby is one of the legends in the space. Definitely after this, we'll be over there.
06:05:22.450 - 06:05:51.164, Speaker A: So definitely come up to him with any questions that you guys have. But thank you so much for being with us today, Bobby, pleasure. Thank you very much. Cheers. Thank you, Bobby. Thank you. Thank you, George.
06:05:51.164 - 06:06:25.704, Speaker A: Now I see many people, they are already busy with their leads or market interactions. So more energetic section of our event today is about to come. First, I want to invite to the stage the co founder of Genesis. Go Frank Mathis. And he will be talking about discovering the feature of decentralized infrastructure. Warm applause and welcome. Thank you.
06:06:25.704 - 06:07:06.194, Speaker A: All right, can you guys hear me? Perfect. That works. So, good afternoon. I got some notes here that I'm going to be using as we talk through a few things. Appreciate you guys letting me up here. As he just said, my name is Frank Mathis, co founder of Genesis Go, and I have the privilege of leading the team that created the shadow drive. It's Solana's only truly native, fully decentralized storage protocol that allows users to maintain performance, security and stability.
06:07:06.194 - 06:07:46.008, Speaker A: So they say that you don't often know that history is being made until after you make it. So today we're going to challenge that notion a little bit. And I'm going to need, I'm going to need all of your guys help to do it because we're going to have to do it in what? It's 04:07 right now. We're going to do it in about 15 minutes or so. But I think today, if I can get you guys help, what we're going to do is we're going to knowingly make history and it should be pretty cool. So first question, who out there in the audience, how many of you have a saga phone? Raise your hand. Okay.
06:07:46.008 - 06:08:00.964, Speaker A: Kind of here and there. Perfect. How many of you all have an Android phone? Raise your hand. Awesome. Perfect. Cool. So what we're going to do, and I just realized I need my clicker for the presentation.
06:08:00.964 - 06:08:28.924, Speaker A: So what we're going to do is here in just a sec, I'm going to put a QR code up on the screen. You guys are going to use the QR code to download the shadow drive app. Now, what's so special about an app? It's kind of already been done before. Once I get my clicker, wait and see. It should be pretty cool. Hey, guys, over here. Clicker.
06:08:28.924 - 06:09:08.294, Speaker A: Thank you. No, no, that's my fault. All right, so if you have a saga or if you have an Android device, I mean, same thing, right? But then what I'd like you to do, use this QR code, download the app. And if you don't have a QR scanner for some reason, there's a direct link right there at shadow drive Ggrxroads. And I'm going to give you guys just a minute to download it. So you're going to download it and you're going to install it and obviously open it. That would be helpful.
06:09:08.294 - 06:09:46.554, Speaker A: There's going to be two steps. Just two. First thing you're going to do is you're going to press create id. After you press create id, you're going to hit join network. So here's what you're looking for. As you guys kind of work through that. What I want to see is as you get connected, take a look and look for a box that says uptime report.
06:09:46.554 - 06:10:30.414, Speaker A: And it may take 10 seconds, 15 seconds, might take a minute. So you're looking for a box that says uptime report. And what you're looking for is you want to see it say uptime equals true. So when you see it, when we'll kind of find out who's brave and amongst you all, when you see a box that pops up that says uptime equals true, raise your hand for me. We're waiting. We got one over there. Who else? Say, when you're doing live stuff like this, it's the waiting that's the hardest part.
06:10:30.414 - 06:10:44.090, Speaker A: We got. Anybody else? Uptime equals true. We got another. Perfect. There we go. Another. Okay, perfect.
06:10:44.090 - 06:11:58.054, Speaker A: So, as you guys are looking through this, right, so what you're seeing, as you're seeing that box pop up that says uptime equals true, right. What's happening as we speak is that your phones are joining the shadow drive network live, and you're contributing latent storage, unused hard drive space from your phone directly to the shadow drive network. Every time that your phone, every time somebody downloads the app and the phone says uptime equals true, you're now running a mobile shadow node as we speak. Every time that you see. And you're looking at the. As you're looking at your screen, you're seeing, like, you know, the logs fly through, right? When you're seeing a new snapshot get uploaded to your phone, what's actually happening is you're uploading, you're ingesting Solana Ledger history. So you're ingesting the history of all the Solana transactions, of the state of all accounts into your phones, and you're actually storing them live right now, but you're doing it using a network that is literally completely powered by only mobile devices.
06:11:58.054 - 06:12:49.144, Speaker A: The mobile devices that are in this room. There has never before been a moment in web3, where phones are communicating exclusively using cell signal with no middleman servers in between. There's no servers and data centers that is feeding information. There's no middleman servers. You're taking the data directly. Directly from the Solana validator network, and you're dropping it directly, and it's being dropped directly into your phones, which what's happening is your phones are communicating trustlessly with one another. The data you're ingesting is being, is being eraser coded into shreds.
06:12:49.144 - 06:14:24.164, Speaker A: And those shreds are being distributed amongst your guys phones based purely on the consensus between your guys phones as to where that data needs to live in order to make sure the network runs and is serving requests, you know, for someone who wants to check the price history of a coin, someone wants to check, someone to check, you know, who minted an NFT. All of those things your guys phones are deciding, like, where's this data at? And is this data then being reassembled properly in order to have those requests be served properly. That's a really cool moment, and I want to tell you guys why. So the whole purpose behind Shadow drive, the whole reason why we created it, was, you know, to look at the, basically to look at the world of web3 and say there's a lot of solutions that we're trying to create. There's a lot of things that we're trying to solve. But at the end of the day, it still isn't producing the same type of performance, the same type of stability that you see from traditional cloud based storage platforms. Shadow Drive was designed to solve that by introducing a platform that takes all the best parts of web3 and puts it together with the best parts of web two.
06:14:24.164 - 06:15:51.946, Speaker A: Well, what's kind of the barrier there, right? Like, how many of you all, you know, how many of you all in the audience have never put together, like, never built a server and maintained a server in a data center, right? How many of you all, you know, have, how many of you all have the time where you're spending? You want to spend all of your time monitoring your servers, right? Putting your extra income towards leasing those servers in the hopes that you make revenue off of them? All of those things. All those things are barriers, right, to entry for web3. Not just in terms of, like, paying, you know, buying meme coins or, you know, trading jpegs. There are barriers to entry for web3 because web3 is all about the individual people powering the network themselves, not relying on having the data sent to them individually by a quote, like, trusted provider. Your phones right now, I'm mentioning your phones right now, they're working through, they're eraser coding the data. They're taking it, splitting it into, into data shreds and distributing them out amongst you, all right? Now, those data shreds, they've been encrypted. They've been basically encrypted using zero knowledge proofs shadow drive.
06:15:51.946 - 06:17:01.798, Speaker A: We recently upgraded the way that our proofs work to basically ensure that you guys can always trust, like the participants of the network and always trust that the data that's being stored amongst you all, it's literally impossible for it to be altered, which the data availability meme is going to be a little bit mad at that one as we continue to push out these upgrades. But that's super important, that's super critical, because that means that right now, as your phones are literally storing the actual ledger, the actual history of Solana, you guys, like you all have become the custodians of Solana's ledger history. But I digress a little bit, circling back to this moment here and why. It's really, really cool. This is a moment where it took you all, what, 10 seconds to download an app. It took you all two clicks, two button presses to join a network. That simplicity, that's the power of mobile.
06:17:01.798 - 06:17:47.444, Speaker A: That's the power of mobile devices, that's the power of cell networks. They're easy, they're plug and play. They automatically work. You all basically have the ability to download an app super quick, punch a couple of buttons and get to start to help, do help. Power helped contribute to the thing that shadow drive was really, truly built to do, which wasn't about decentralizing, like just pushing on another decentralized storage network. It was about taking the hundreds of billions of dollars per year that big tech cloud companies take in every single year. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, they take in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, storing data, providing cloud services.
06:17:47.444 - 06:19:10.264, Speaker A: The true goal, and the true, like what's truly powerful about what it is that's happened here today is that revenue streams, those revenue streams, those revenue streams can now be decentralized and put where they belong, which is out with you. The mobile network. The fact that mobile networks is communicating purely off of cell signal sell service means that anybody in the world, right, regardless of their knowledge, their access to resources, anybody in the world who has a phone can connect to shadow drive, contribute storage, and start getting paid to do so. And as I said, that's the true goal, the true goal of web3, the true goal of bitcoin. When the bitcoin network was sort of first launched, it was about giving the power back to the people. It was about taking the power, taking the revenue that big banks, big finance had basically captured, cornered, whatever, and give that power and that revenue back to the people by creating a trustless peer to peer payment network. Shadow Drive is doing the same thing except we're doing it for cloud, cloud infrastructure.
06:19:10.264 - 06:19:55.184, Speaker A: Again, mobile, you know, mobile's the future. Mobile is impactful, and mobile's powerful because there's, you know, four point, what, 4.8? I think roughly, you know, active, like Android devices in the world. I think there's no, it's 3.8 million active Android devices in the world right now. There's, you know, another like, 3 billion active iOS mobile devices. There's nearly, you know, putting those together, right? You have nearly 5 billion active devices that, you know, most everybody, I mean, these days, everybody has a phone these days, everybody has something in their pocket that, you know, it's essential.
06:19:55.184 - 06:22:34.234, Speaker A: It is an essential resource, an essential item for them to just conduct their normal day to day life. What's impressive, what's cool, what's impactful about what it is that's happened here today is for the first time, that phone in your pocket, that thing that costs you money every single month but you can't live without, is now turned into an appreciating asset because as shadow drive continues to gain popularity, as shadow Drive continues to gain users, the revenue that shadow drive generates is pushed directly out to the end users or the end storage providers, which in this case, and as it will be in the future, as we push shadow drive to a fully, completely mobile only architecture, stripping out servers, stripping out any type of middleman steps along the way, and creating an architecture that powers shadow drive exclusively from mobile phones means that all of that revenue ends up in the hands of you, all in the hands of people, ordinary people, for doing something as simple as downloading an app and pressing two buttons. One of the things that's funny, one of the things that shadow drive right now does extremely well, is it provides performant cloud storage for fractions of a penny, like, fractions of a penny, like, on the dollar. It's the single most cost effective, decentralized cloud storage platform in existence today. And one of the things that I get asked a lot that we hear on our team here a lot is, okay, well, that's cool, right? Shadow drag, how can it be sustainable? How can it scale? Because, you know, it's. It's too cheap, right? Well, you know, it's been, what, two years? We've been developing shadow drive now for two years, slowly making incremental progress along the way. And after two years, it's a really, like, we're really excited to actually finally be able to announce, like, shadow drives, like, final four form of its architecture in which we push it, as I said straight to a completely mobile cell powered, cell signal powered network that basically allows the overall cost, the overall expenses of running servers, maintaining servers, dealing with network problems to just be completely eliminated.
06:22:34.234 - 06:24:54.924, Speaker A: So two years of development to kind of get to this point and what gets, like, where it gets kind of where it's, you know, getting very fun for us and where it will get very fun for, you know, for you all and for the, you know, the members of our community and participants in the network is mobile allows us, then they have the opportunity to do some really cool things with expanding the way the token works, expanding the way tokens power the network, you know, adding into the, you know, the shadow drive token ecosystem, you know, data data accessibility tokens, bandwidth tokens, so on and so forth. So, you know, as I said, a lot of people, I get quite, we get the question a lot that a lot of people are concerned about shadow drives ability to scale and maintain performance and still exist. And it's a fair question after today's development, after seeing how quickly and how, frankly, nonchalantly, how easy it was to just start connecting and be like, oh yeah, this thing's working. I don't think the question is actually like how can shadow drive scale? Can it be performant, be profitable? You know, with nearly 5 billion mobile devices in the world like right now that are active and that's not counting inactive ones, I think the better question is how could it not? I want to thank everybody for the time today. Thanks so much for playing along, downloading the app, and I really appreciate you all hearing me out. Thanks a lot, Frank presentation. Our next guest is the co founder and CEO of Real Vision, or you might know him via his flagship publication, Global Macro Investor.
06:24:54.924 - 06:25:26.974, Speaker A: And everybody please give a warm welcome to Mister Raul Paul. And our George Harrop is going to be hosting this conversation on the stage. Thank you. Hello. Hello Raoul, can you hear us? Can you see us? I can hear you perfectly. Can you hear me? Testing, one, two. I can hear you.
06:25:26.974 - 06:25:35.262, Speaker A: Can hear me. Can you hear me? Hello Raoul, we can see you. I can hear you. I can hear you. Ah, there we go. Awesome. Okay.
06:25:35.262 - 06:25:50.968, Speaker A: Can you hear me? Awesome. Awesome. Welcome. You're live in Istanbul, a city that's 3000 years old. If not, add another thousand on there somewhere. You're in front of a crowd with a couple of thousand people. Indeed.
06:25:50.968 - 06:26:29.018, Speaker A: So no pressure about what you're going to do. But look, I'm really excited to be talking to you today and maybe for everyone in the crowd, you're known as a macro investor. We're at a Solana conference today, so we can talk a little bit about that, but maybe just a brief overview. What do you do? What's real vision all about? And, yeah, we can, we can go from there. Yeah. So, yeah, so what I do is what I do is complicated. I do a lot of things, but essentially, but essentially, the core of what I think is something called global macro, which is this basically, basically institutional research service.
06:26:29.018 - 06:27:12.842, Speaker A: There's a macro out of that. Formed my hypothesis back in 2013. Also out of that real, because I realized, I realized that people needed to be, needed to be empowered with their own information to make their own decisions. People didn't trust the system anyway, all part of the same thing. And real vision, the idea was democratize finance beyond that community and a whole bunch and a whole bunch of things. My job is, my job is really trying, what I'm really trying to do at core to help people understand the journey is going, what is going on in the global economy, why it's so broken, and the solution and the solutions that we've got in front of us, of which crypto is, always has been. Well, that's what it's all about.
06:27:12.842 - 06:27:44.994, Speaker A: And I think you come to it with a more of a philosophical take, which I think is probably for me, I mean, we've both been in for a very long time. I'm like 14 years in this clown show. But I think that's the way to start. Right? Philosophical take of what should money be and how should we use it, how should it interact with the rest of the economy? And crypto is trying to reinvent that. Right. Decentralization and so on. We don't need to rely on a bunch of people that sit around a table, meet once a quarter and decide what interest rates are anymore.
06:27:44.994 - 06:28:24.048, Speaker A: But maybe we can talk a little bit about your quote as well. I'll give the family friendly version, which is don't mess this up, but what are you talking about there? And I. Yeah, yeah. So listen, how I think about this is most of us, most space on a certain hook might be technology, money, it might be ideals of ideals, whatever the brings you in. Really what we really, what we do is we're scaling and scaling a network, which is a, which is a public utility. Good. And we'll have a show, have a share of.
06:28:24.048 - 06:28:42.016, Speaker A: That's what we're, that's what we're doing here. And, and game change. Game changer, the same, the same investment, investment, product. Every country. Every country in the world, whether Istanbul, whether it's in Delhi, whether it's in New York, here in the Cayman island, it's the same. It's the same, right? That is incredible. Also, it's also actionizable.
06:28:42.016 - 06:29:03.620, Speaker A: So everybody, everybody can put in terrorist, egalitarian, something really, something really interesting about this. Oh, and if you can still hear us with slight, slight video issue. Oh, we're back. We're back. We can hear you again. Hello, hello. Testing.
06:29:03.620 - 06:29:27.516, Speaker A: 121212. Testing. We'll get him back. We'll get Raoul back as soon as we can. This is always the thing with these live, live crosses from halfway around the world. It's always struggle to maintain. But Raoul, are you with us? Maybe a few more.
06:29:27.516 - 06:29:35.996, Speaker A: Few more moments. Thank you. Ah, we're back. We're back. Yes. Yes. We can see you all the way through.
06:29:35.996 - 06:29:59.428, Speaker A: Oh, sure. Amazing. Sorry, sorry. Continue. Yes. So if we think about this public utility, which we can all invest in now, this is an asset class that is two and a half trillion dollars now. It's the fastest growing technology, which has now become faster.
06:29:59.428 - 06:30:42.172, Speaker A: So it's a twice the speed of the Internet. It also is the fastest appreciation asset of all time is bitcoin. And many of the other, whether it's Solana or whatever, are all scaling up Metcalfe's law. But the big picture, really simple, this is going to trillion, the end of this cycle be ten to 15 trillion, and it's going to 100 trillion. This is going to be the largest, fastest accumulation of wealth in all humanity. And so the reason I say don't screw this up is you just need to ride the secular trend. And yes, it's difficult because there are big drawdowns in this space, because it's driven by liquidity, big macro stuff that drives it.
06:30:42.172 - 06:31:13.240, Speaker A: But over time, it is a network adoption model. So it's a logarithmic chart. And if you can just hold on and not do the wrong things, don't over trade, don't have fomo, don't use too much leverage, just stay in the game. It will compound wealth. And that's how we can help. The most number of people is bringing people into the network and letting the wealth generation machine of number go up work for everybody. Because the more people join the network, the more valuable the network is.
06:31:13.240 - 06:31:54.500, Speaker A: Creates more money in the ecosystem to develop new protocols and new applications. If bitcoin hadn't been a success, Solana wouldn't have been a success. We all build on top of each other, and we build this incredible applications layer and network layer at the same time. That's what this is all about, and I guess as well, building on that, there's these two sort of thesis out there with the store of value thesis and that's maybe where bitcoin comes into play. And then you have maybe the smart contract chain thesis. And sometimes I guess I'm curious your take, but people seem to mix them up. They maybe think that a smart contract chain is trying to be a bitcoin, or a bitcoin should try to be something else.
06:31:54.500 - 06:33:03.148, Speaker A: But are these fundamentally two different things? Are we building maybe one with a financial system and maybe one with an equivalent to gold? Or what's your thought on maybe this differentiation of why these crypto assets should be valued such that they are? Because Apple and Google and Amazon are all Internet companies, yet they're all different, yet they all use the same technology, which is the Internet. So what we're using is the technology of blockchain and people are developing different use cases and variations of the technology stack. And so it's a. I think of the world in terms of abundance and not as a finite pie where you're fighting over the pie that can't be so because it's gone from $0 to two, two and a half trillion. And if it goes to that, the pie is growing. So what we got is a bunch of incredibly smart people solving different problems. And like all startups, because many of these are still startups, some won't get product market fit and others will get product market fit.
06:33:03.148 - 06:33:26.584, Speaker A: So there's space for everybody, the space for multiple narratives, different business models. Because in the end, at protocol layer, everyone's just selling block space. It's nothing that fancy. We dress it up with a lot. We just sell block space. Is my block space more attractive than your block space for the use case that you've got? If I build block space, that's not attractive to you? It won't work. Over time, it's pretty simple.
06:33:26.584 - 06:33:57.004, Speaker A: Everybody loves to over complicate everything in this space. They do. And they often invent words every other day. Right? And we have to contest with this new dictionary being created. But I guess one of the big things that's happened recently, and I guess looking at as an investment asset is the ETF's. So the ETF's went live. We now have these very large ETF's with, I think it was top ten ETF inflows ever or something like that, to the spot bitcoin ones.
06:33:57.004 - 06:34:39.270, Speaker A: Is this an ongoing trend? Are we going to see maybe more of these ETF's? Look at some of these other maybe smart contract chains or just other things other than bitcoin, or is it really, as you say, it's not a winner takes all? There's space for everything. And yeah, maybe we see multiple of these ETF's. What's your take on sort of where do they go next? Okay, let me reframe all of everything in terms of what these ETF's are. And again, I'm going to try and make it pretty simple. Cryptoland is a new digital economy. If you think of Balaji and his network state idea. Right? We're building a giant network state, which is cryptoland.
06:34:39.270 - 06:35:11.436, Speaker A: It's made up of substates, bitcoin land, Solana land, ethereum land. And many of us just live entirely within that space. But we, you know, we may visit fiat world because we live there, but we do a lot of our transactions. A lot of wealth stays within crypto land. It's a new emerging market economy, and it's the fastest growing emerging market economy on the world. Okay, fabulous. We've got much like all economies, we have foreign direct investment, FDI.
06:35:11.436 - 06:35:51.434, Speaker A: FDI flows, venture capital that comes from fiat world and goes into crypto land and starts building crypto land. What the ETF is, is a free trade agreement between cryptoland and fair world. So these are hot money flows. It allows capital to come in and take advantage of the higher rate of return in this new emerging economy. And so what happens is that money then pours into this new small economy, and the economy grows and people go out the risk curve and they start buying other assets. So it benefits the entire economy as profits are generated. It causes people to start new businesses.
06:35:51.434 - 06:36:27.134, Speaker A: And because there's more money in that economy, they use that for venture capital to build new application layers and stuff like that. So that's how I frame this. So I'm indifferent to whether different products come. They will come. And I do think the ethereum one gets across the line, but really, it's not so much that it's the free trade pipes that were allowing to happen. So now you can be a fiat world investor, and you don't actually have to go outside of fiat world. You don't have to open a wallet and do all of that stupid stuff that we do in our land.
06:36:27.134 - 06:36:42.590, Speaker A: They can just take advantage of the high rate of returns. The downside is it's hot money flows, so it can leave as well. And that's typical of emerging market economies. So you're in Turkey. Turkey. Seen this endless cycle of hot money inflows. Hot money outflows.
06:36:42.590 - 06:37:16.706, Speaker A: Foreign direct investment going up and down. It's the same thing. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And I guess here in the audience today, we have thousands of people that are maybe also looking to get a job in this new economy as well. And when we're talking at it at a stage of an economy level, does that necessarily, like a normal economy, let's say a country of Turkey, right? You've got people from the country, kebab shop owner to an investment fund, to a guy selling you a boat trip on the weekend somewhere. So you've got lots of different elements of the economy in crypto land. We have a lot of online things.
06:37:16.706 - 06:38:05.684, Speaker A: And do you think that this economy will continue to grow into different ways? So a lot of people are trying to do rwas. They're trying to tokenize stuff. They're trying to do these. Obviously, we have dexs and trading and speculation and that sort of thing. But do you think there's a place for people to derive their income from this magical Internet land, and therefore, they're not encumbered by the borders of whether it's Turkey or the UK or wherever you might be, it's this global economy that everyone has a part of. But do we run the risk of it's only available in certain areas, or do you think we're at the bottom of the mountain and maybe there's still more things that are yet to grow in this economy? What's your take? Yeah, so, look, this is a new world for us. We're now living in a duality.
06:38:05.684 - 06:38:22.544, Speaker A: So I'm physically in the Cayman Islands. You know, you're physically, you know, in Turkey right now. Maybe you're in the UK. You pay taxes to your domestic economy for your use there. You do the same in cryptoland. It's called gas fees. Yep.
06:38:22.544 - 06:38:59.944, Speaker A: Right. So it's you're paying taxes in the economy that you operate within. So we will all operate in this dual world. But because of the speed of adoption of this new country, it's like the United States back in 100 something years ago. It encourages an enormous amount of risk taking, speculation, and then entrepreneurship. And we see that. So people are saying, okay, this system is a great way of building new products and solving different problems.
06:38:59.944 - 06:39:37.572, Speaker A: The problems of web two, let's say. But then we've got the giants, the absolute giants of fiat world, saying, actually, this country is a better way of doing things. And so when I think about, you know, the real prize in all of this lands in two places, one is the kind of overhauling of web two where we get ownership of our own selves back again. That's a battle we're going to fight. That's a huge battle. We're going to fight it again in AI. But the other side is, I think, all of the financial system comes across.
06:39:37.572 - 06:40:09.980, Speaker A: Now, to put that in perspective, most things in all of finance are just contracts, and we happen to have a bloody good way of operating contracts at scale that are immutable and written in code. Absolutely. So that means, let's say something simple like the OTC derivative market. That's a 1.4 quadrillion dollar market. They're just contracts. Then we think of the blockchain rail of.
06:40:09.980 - 06:40:59.198, Speaker A: And that's why fire dancer, for example, has been very interesting to me, is when you can get enough speeds for the financial system, well, then it's a lot of proof of ownership at speed and instant settlement, which the financial system struggles with. So we're actually solving enormous problems for a larger part, which is why I've always said that this new economy is going to get much more migration across from the traditional economy, because people just can operate better there. It's just cheaper, faster, better. It's like the United States. If you want to be an entrepreneur, maybe not in Web three, because it's awful to be an entrepreneur in Web three in the US, but otherwise, if you're in technology, you want to be in the US. Why? Because the capital, the intellectual capital, everything is there, the regulatory framework, and that's what we're building. Absolutely.
06:40:59.198 - 06:41:55.514, Speaker A: And maybe an example of that is kind of what you're doing with real vision right now is you're one of these companies that's trying to find its way in this new economy and doing a great job, by the way. But maybe you can maybe talk us through the journey of building real vision to what it is now. And how does, is there a way that you guys fit into this new crypto economy? I know, obviously, a lot of your content revolves around that. And hey, anyone with a phone, we can be here in Istanbul and we can be looking up real vision and doing whatever we're doing, right, so you can service your products to 7 billion people around the world. What's the founder's journey been like? Or how do you think that you fit into this crypto world? Well, at first, the idea, the essence was to democratize this information. The very first video we made in 2014 had bitcoin in it. So it's always been part of our journey.
06:41:55.514 - 06:42:27.106, Speaker A: And if we're just thinking about the crypto side of things. What we're really trying to do is educate people about the opportunity. Also why you need to take advantage of the opportunity. A lot of things don't work, but let's go and look at what works. And we go down the rabbit hole in everything, whether it's NFTs or meme coins. We kind of examine, okay, what is happening within this economy now. As we've evolved, we've got an NFT community called Real Vision Genesis.
06:42:27.106 - 06:43:01.432, Speaker A: We've got an NFT community called the Real Vision Collective. We've got somebody spun up a meme coin community called DTFU, which is the don't fuck this up memecoin. Nothing to do with us, but it's a bunch of our members. So that's them using our network to build on top of. Obviously we accept crypto payments, but that's only the start of our ambition with what we want to do. We've got ZK login to do, identities to do. We've got maybe our eventual loyalty token program doesn't have to be a freely traded crypto.
06:43:01.432 - 06:43:41.000, Speaker A: What are we going to do with content authentication because of AI? Well, that feels like that's blockchain. There's a lot we want to do with this outside of just educating people, bringing people in, giving them some of the tools. We want to start building what we do on the web3 layer and trying to abstract it away as much as possible, because that's the other clunky issue we've got now is it's very not abstracted, it's awful. Bridging stuff across and then all sorts of just horror stories. But eventually we'll get there. The technology is being built with a lot of people building great tech stacks to do this. So that's our journey, is the proof is in the pudding as well.
06:43:41.000 - 06:44:01.988, Speaker A: So NFts were part of that. The community side token gated content. We've done that. We've done po apps for attendance, all sorts of stuff. So we keep iterating and experimenting. Wow, I had no idea you guys are doing so much. I mean, what it comes down to is you use the word community and NFT nfts as well.
06:44:01.988 - 06:44:40.124, Speaker A: This is a word that's used a lot in the NFT world now. Nobody, there's no Starbucks discord that we all go and join. We don't join the McDonald's hangout group on Twitter or something like that. So I guess there's quite a difference between the crypto communities that we're building and it seems like there's a lot more connectivity between people. They're much more engaged. Maybe as a business founder, maybe this is, is actually a great way to grow a business, is if you can build this community, that creates loyalty. I mean, maybe this is just the evolution of, I don't know, a Starbucks gift card or voucher or something that you punch and you get something free.
06:44:40.124 - 06:45:20.730, Speaker A: Like is this maybe a new way that businesses should look at monetizing themselves or getting out there as growing a community? So it's even bigger than that. What this is is culture, and culture and brand are intangibles on a balance sheet. So Disney is actually not that valuable these days because the stock struggles. Disney's brand and culture around it is gigantic, huge. Maybe it's a trillion dollars, maybe more. Tokenization can turn an intangible on a balance sheet to a tangible. But to do that, you kind of have to do the opposite of what corporations are used to, which is total control.
06:45:20.730 - 06:46:05.670, Speaker A: You have to let the community take control. And that's hard for people to do, but brands are experimenting. I'm really excited about that space. You know, what is the size? Well, we can see the size of the Taylor Swift economy because she actually moved us gdp. Okay? So that's clearly an opportunity to create a passionate, thrive, thriving community that could be tokenized in certain ways, whether it's nfts or whether it's a token itself. And I do think, and I've spoken to many, many brands, in fact, I built a business on this. We didn't manage to survive the bear market, but the idea is that all of this culture will get tokenized in a way that is meaningful.
06:46:05.670 - 06:46:47.224, Speaker A: Because in a world of AI, when it becomes less obvious what we're going to do for a living, being a community member and driving culture is very human and it can't be replaced by a machine. So if we can derive value from being part of a community and helping that community grow, okay, well, there's a purpose for humanity, much like religion. Did you know people go to a church, they put money in the thing, the catholic church gets the money. It's the same idea, but at a Internet globalized scale. I love it. Yeah. I think that focus on community is maybe something that web3 and NFT world and all that sort of stuff has really brought to the fore.
06:46:47.224 - 06:47:40.158, Speaker A: Maybe switching gears again, back to more of the investment side and how to get involved in this community and how to like the people here in the audience. People want to be involved so what would be sort of your, your comments on how should people be involved in this growing economy? What should they do? Should they go to school for twelve years and study a degree that makes no sense and get into debt and all that sort of stuff? Or maybe they should learn to code. A lot of people are saying that, right? Or maybe they should, I don't know, do something else. Like how can people be involved in this new world? And yeah, I'm curious, your take. So I've always found the journey is the same. Is whatever hook it is that gets you into buying a token, that's a start. Now you've got something you want number to go up, right? It's perfect behavioral incentive system.
06:47:40.158 - 06:48:02.114, Speaker A: It's like the best I've ever seen. So now you want number to go up. So now you start talking to other people about how the number can go up. Now it depends what you're good at. If you're an artist, well, you've got NFTs. That's a community for you to start getting into. You're a music artist, well, there's a bunch of people trying to struggle to get that off the ground too.
06:48:02.114 - 06:48:33.634, Speaker A: Maybe you're a developer. Okay? There's plenty you can do there in figuring out how you can use your skills. Maybe you're an influencer or you've got a small community of your own. Well can you bring that community along? Or maybe you're just passionate about something and something there will be a web3 representation of that community somewhere. So just get involved. So don't force a narrative. You're never going to get me to go into the developer community because I don't know what I'm doing.
06:48:33.634 - 06:49:22.762, Speaker A: But you can get me to get into nfts, music, media, all sorts of other areas. So it's find where your passion lies and then lend your hand, lend your brains, or just be involved things vibrant, you know, just being an active community member. Let's say you are a Solana investor, maybe it's one of the NFT communities you're in. Well, be active, help grow it, help, you know, or whether it's Solana itself, help educate people, get them to understand and then number go up. More people come into the network, the more valuable the network is because more people are building new applications on the network. So it really is simple that we can all play our part in whatever we do. Absolutely.
06:49:22.762 - 06:49:58.254, Speaker A: And here at the conference we've got all sorts of different Solana applications. We've got people roaming around the audience that are doing really cool things. Many billion dollar protocols sitting around. So definitely go out, go meet these people, engage, see what can be done. I guess coming up to time here as well, one final sort of question is, what are you excited about? We're almost halfway through the year now. That's shocking. But what are you excited about for in 2024? Maybe particularly on the crypto side, and maybe any of your thoughts on Solana or anything like that.
06:49:58.254 - 06:50:37.960, Speaker A: But just in general, what's exciting to you for the rest of this year? What's exciting rest of this year, from a macro perspective, it's like we're in the middle of the election cycle, the liquidity cycle, all of that. So it kind of gets fun at this point, and people lose their minds. So we're going to be in middle of that. I always look forward to that. Sleepless nights. Not from the horror of markets going down, but of the market going up. But I'm actually excited about all of the vc money that went in into 2020 and 2021 to see what applications people build, the new blockchain technologies or just the applications layer.
06:50:37.960 - 06:50:56.988, Speaker A: We know we've got a UX problem. People are solving that. Some cool stuff happening. We know we've got. We've had, you know, complications with how complicated things like Dexs are. Well, we're seeing things resolve there, too. The big one for me, particularly in Solana, is, look, there's a lot of applications layer stuff.
06:50:56.988 - 06:51:27.792, Speaker A: That's what drew me to Solana. It's like, it's something that can be very retail led, and the applications layer is very interesting. But fire dancer people don't understand. They still don't. They still don't understand how big a deal this really is, because the speed of what things can be done changes use cases. And if you change use cases by quantum leap, we'll see it won't be this cycle. This cycle, we'll talk about it and hype it.
06:51:27.792 - 06:52:10.324, Speaker A: It'll be the next cycle where before you know it, somebody's built an unbelievable exchange, centralized exchange or whatever it is, using this technology with automated market making built in at a speed we didn't think was possible. And then before you know it, Nasdaq's knocking on the door saying, hey, can we use this technology? Okay, that gets really interesting. Or whether it's the ability to have, have massive throughput for ticketing. And so tickets can go onto nfts. We don't know the use cases, but we know that it's quantum leap forward. So I'm very, very excited to see fire dancer launch. When I first heard Toli talk about it properly, I don't know, about a year or so ago and a few others.
06:52:10.324 - 06:52:27.828, Speaker A: It took me a while to process it. And I actually went on Twitter and said, hey, who knows about this? Virtually nobody. I'm like, yeah. And then I asked totally, you know, publicly, when does it go on to testnet? He's like, oh, in two months time. I'm like, oh, my God. People just haven't got their heads around it yet. They're still.
06:52:27.828 - 06:52:58.144, Speaker A: People tend to look at present state and not future state often, but the future state of Solana, both with the sheer number of applications, the ux, the really nice ux that's being built on top. You know, it feels like a premium experience, but a retail experience. And then fired answer changes everything again, absolutely. No. We've been talking a little bit about fire dancer today. I think I'm talking with Toli in 2 hours or something like that. And I'm going to put a question in there.
06:52:58.144 - 06:53:14.964, Speaker A: But a lot of the people in the audience, they're building application layer stuff. A lot of the reason we're here, I mean, we at step, we built because of the speed and the scalability. That's a lot Lana brings and the UX as well. It's just simple to use. You just download an app, press a button and boom. Okay, it all works. That's amazing.
06:53:14.964 - 06:53:31.380, Speaker A: But thank you so much for your time today, Raoul. So Raoul pal from real vision, definitely go and check them out. Go and check out blogs. They've got amazing video content as well. Of course. I mean, you're on Twitter all the time, Raoul as well. So definitely go and follow.
06:53:31.380 - 06:53:48.376, Speaker A: But any parting words for the, for the audience here? Yeah, I'm going to go bigger than the usual. Don't fuck this up. Look, we've got a massive opportunity in front of us. We're going to get into the banana zone. The crazy part of the cycle. Don't lose your minds. Remember, there will be a bear market.
06:53:48.376 - 06:54:20.238, Speaker A: If you're building, and this is a serious point. If you are building product or applications, make sure you have a plan to have cash for the bear market. Not just tokens, because you need to pay your staff and people go under because they misunderstand the cyclicality of this industry. Make sure you understand the cycle. Have some cash, stable coins, whatever on the side. Because whatever token you're building on will go down 70 or 80%. And suddenly you can't pay your bills.
06:54:20.238 - 06:54:41.854, Speaker A: So that's the piece of advice. Is don't fuck this up. It's really important for you guys in the room, because a lot of people are building or investing in this space to just keep going. Staying in the game is the most important part. Very wise words. No, I think that works on so many levels. So thank you so much for your time today, Raoul, and for everyone.
06:54:41.854 - 06:55:24.790, Speaker A: Definitely go and follow the links, but all the best for the rest of today. Take care, everybody. Enjoy Istanbul. Bye bye. He was connecting to us. And thanks, George, for moderating. And now I will invite somebody already, you know, but there are some people who just checked in now in the afternoon, and I think you want more of him.
06:55:24.790 - 06:56:00.814, Speaker A: And that was not enough. So I'm inviting Ansem to the stage, and he'll be talking about Solana's main character with Mia Grotsky, please. Thank you. Hello, hello, hello. Who is excited to have Ansem back on stage, folks? Yeah. All right, so before we get started, I would like everyone in the room. If you follow Ansem on Twitter, raise your hand.
06:56:00.814 - 06:56:13.302, Speaker A: All right, now, if you followed him. So we're in 2024. If you followed him in 2023, keep your hand up. Okay. 2022. Okay. 2021.
06:56:13.302 - 06:56:32.582, Speaker A: 2020. Any 2020 followers? Covid? I think I saw one. Wait, 2020. Put your hands back up. Oh, there's, like, one hand going up and down. Okay, I'm gonna count you as the longest follower back there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
06:56:32.582 - 06:57:06.304, Speaker A: All right. Fun to see. Okay, so the title of this talk is Solana's main character. So, Ansem, there's two of us on stage. I don't think I'm the main character, so I think this is about you. Maybe you can give us kind of a quick history of your time in Solana and past main characters. You can walk us through maybe by the years 2020 to now or by the different bull runs D five summer, NFT mania, who have been some of our past main characters in the ecosystem.
06:57:06.304 - 06:57:50.880, Speaker A: Yeah, pre me, I would say I've been in Solana since, like, January, I think January 2021. So I've been trading crypto since 2017. Before trading Crypto, I was a software engineer and did really well during the COVID cycle, which was 2020. And that's when Solana was, like, my biggest trade that cycle. I missed the first portion of Defi Summer, and then after DeFi Summer happened, as you guys know, Ethereum had a ton of problems with congestion and high fees on chain. So it was difficult for people with not a lot of capital to transact and use all these applications. And that's when I got the original thesis for Solana back in early 2021.
06:57:50.880 - 06:58:22.234, Speaker A: I bought it around like $1.50, I think. And, yeah, did well riding it up through that whole cycle. I think I got out around like 200 or something there. So, yeah, that's when my account went crazy, because my thread on Twitter, I had a thread basically detailing the entire trade all the way up, all the pullbacks and, like, entries, reentries, like local tops, local bottoms. And it went from literally from a dollar 50 all the way to 200. So I was in 2021.
06:58:22.234 - 06:58:55.588, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say main characters before me, SBF, probably don't have a greek president there. But, yeah, no, it's been cool. It's been cool seeing people follow the trade that cycle. And then also this current cycle, 2023. A lot of the same people that had conviction in Solana back then took a similar trade this cycle, around like 15, $20 after the FDX explosion, and are now doing well again. So it's been cool. Okay, so, well, thank you, first of all, for being here at the conference.
06:58:55.588 - 06:59:28.284, Speaker A: I think everyone is excited to have you here. And you've already been on some really great panels today. And those panels have talked a lot about your background, kind of your take on trades and the meme coin mania. So I'm keen to return to this talk title here. The main character, so very recently, Beeple tweeted and beeple, you know, huge NFT figure, I would say he was an NFT main character in the last, you know, bull run. He tweeted and he said, it's Ansem's world and we're all just living in it. And then he had this really funny photo with, like, a kind of avatar of your face on it.
06:59:28.284 - 07:00:00.474, Speaker A: How did you feel when you saw that? I mean, it's been wild. The amount of, like, memes that people have made of me, different coins have made of me. Me. Like, different people put me in videos. Like, all different types of stuff has been insane, honestly, just to watch because it came out of nowhere. I mean, last cycle, I did well with, like, 100K followers, but this cycle, literally, my face is plastered across all of, like, the Solana altcoin ecosystem. A lot of it is because of Wif and bonk, two trades that I took, I did pretty well on, and people tailed me on.
07:00:00.474 - 07:00:41.174, Speaker A: And then, just like, the entire thesis around Solana, not a lot of people were confident that Dex volumes, NFT, volumes like daily active users, would come back on Sol after FTX blew up. And the whole perception around SPF people had a very negative perception of Solana, and not a lot of people thought the chain would come back. But I was one of the few people was like, loudly outspoken, talking about Solana, Defi and the opportunities with airdrops, talking about the opportunities on chain. Once people, people move back over. And just the difference in Ux between Solana and other l ones, like Ethereum, it was clear to me, but it wasn't as clear to other people. But it's wild. It's crazy.
07:00:41.174 - 07:01:15.054, Speaker A: Well, we're all living it through you. Was there a moment you had where you woke up one day and it was just an insane amount of followers, or you were in person at a conference and people started recognizing you? Did you have a moment you can remember where you thought to yourself, wow, like, my life is different now. Something has changed? Honestly, not really. I mean, it's because it's still going. Like, I'm still getting followers at a rapid pace that I was have been the past three months. Like December, I was around 100k followers. Now I'm getting close to 400k followers, which is insane.
07:01:15.054 - 07:01:44.314, Speaker A: Insane. But the cool thing is that whenever I come to conferences like this or go to crypto events, there's always somebody there who, like, bought with earlier or bought some of it, bought Solana early and did really well and either got to pay off some debt or bought a house or whatever else. But those people are just really grateful that I'm online sharing information. So that's why I still keep doing it, even though there's some crazy people online also. But it's really cool. It's cool to see. I don't think there's really one moment.
07:01:44.314 - 07:02:25.570, Speaker A: Token 2049 was pretty crazy, people circling me to take pictures, but it wasn't all that different from Barcelona in like, 2022. Okay. And obviously, you're this very public figure, and I think after this conference, too, even more people within Solana will kind of know your face and know your voice. Did you ever consider being anon? No, I mean, the reason I never considered being anon, I've been on the Internet forever. Like, I was playing World of Warcraft, like 910 years old on those forums, talking to people, like doing the raids and PvP. I played League of Legends. Like, I was a tumblr kid before I was active on crypto, Twitter.
07:02:25.570 - 07:02:45.524, Speaker A: I was on Twitter nonstop. The same Twitter account I have now that I'm active. Talking about crypto is the same one I had in 2012. All my boys from high school and college follow me on. So I've always been doxxed on my Twitter. My Twitter has been my personal Twitter. Before it was my crypto Twitter, and I was Ansem, it was zion Z.
07:02:45.524 - 07:03:28.116, Speaker A: So, yeah, I never really considered it because I just, it just kind of flowed into what I was doing. Whatever I was talking about online just came through all my accounts. Okay, so maybe you could walk us through, like, what is an average day in your life? Walk us through kind of your routine, your morning routine, maybe your skincare routine. Like, how are you spending your time? What is the first thing you're doing? Are you pulling out your phone right away? Like, what do you, what webpage do you go to when you open your laptop? Like, walk us through a day in your life? Yeah, I pull out my phone immediately when I wake up. I checked Twitter before I brushed my teeth, like, before I do anything else. So, yeah, that's first. But I think right now.
07:03:28.116 - 07:04:12.424, Speaker A: So in 2020, 2021, I was really heavy on perps. I was very heavy, like, doing technical analysis. My best trades that cycle were rotating between all the different altcoins and different narratives as they were happening, like, before they were happening. I was really good at being in position before stuff would pop off. And then when stuff popped off hard, I would, like, slam the trades really aggressively like that. Soluna, I don't know if you guys remember Sol, Luna Avax, that trio last cycle, the l one s I did really well with, rotating between all of those l ones, all those trades axie did really well with, but it was mostly on purpose. So I was active, like whatever, twelve plus hours a day looking at charts on, like the low timeframe charts, not just daily, weekly, monthly.
07:04:12.424 - 07:05:05.814, Speaker A: And this cycle I'm not as active trading perps as I am doing, like more on chain stuff and then kind of swing trading because I'm also doing angel investing now, like also co founder now. And I'm more active with like, the social media stuff, which I'm working on Anson media on, because for me, it's like, it's easier for me to just hold spot positions now rather than try and maximize my daily profits. I'd rather like swing trading than focus on other things where I think I can help help more people. So that's kind of where I'm at this cycle. So more of it is calls with, like, people, people founders, investors, all that type of stuff. More of it is working on, like, my app and then also I'm still in the trenches for sure, but it's less like charts 12 hours a day. Okay, so the next thing I want to kind of ask and talk to you about.
07:05:05.814 - 07:05:30.706, Speaker A: This isn't really a fully formed thought yet. It's something I've been thinking about and want to hear your take on. We all have kind of these different relationships to talk tokens and ecosystems. I think a lot of people like bitcoin is probably the first thing we learn about. Then it's usually ethereum. There's sort of this path many of us take. Some of us feel this philosophical connection to certain ecosystems.
07:05:30.706 - 07:06:26.104, Speaker A: Some of us find humor in the meme coin mania. There's all of these different kind of reactions we have to projects and ecosystems. And how has that changed for you? I guess I find obviously, and especially with people taking your face and plastering it all over, there's a lot of humor in kind of your line of work and the work that you do, but it probably wasn't always like that. How has your relationship to tokens or chains or ecosystems sort of shifted over time? Like, where did you start and how are you thinking about it now? Yeah, it's, like, a lot more personal now. I would say kind of. I would say early on, when I was early to Solana, I was an active market participant, but it was kind of like outside looking into everything. So I was one of the first people doing DeFi on Solana, like on radium and all those Dexs, providing liquidity, like testing out protocols in that way.
07:06:26.104 - 07:07:14.576, Speaker A: Like one of the first people to buy Sammo when that dropped, like, the first meme on Solana, being active, like nfts and all that, and kind of, like sharing my thoughts on the process. But now it's almost like I'm a part of this sauna community because I did all that back in the day when I was, like, outside looking in, people saw me do all that, shared it all publicly. A lot of people are taking the same trades, doing the same things, using the same protocols, and now it's like, kind of a shared experience that all of us who have been active on Solana for the past three, four years or so have together. So it's kind of, like, more, I would say, close knit community. Pretty, like, connected to all the memes and all that stuff on seoul, too. Yeah, literally, like, directly in the middle of it. So, yeah, that's what I would say.
07:07:14.576 - 07:07:37.228, Speaker A: It's kind of, like, more intimate relationship. And do you feel like you have to kind of, like, you kind of have the online version of you, and then you have the real life version of. Of you, and you have to, like, consciously separate those things? Or is it kind of like it's just your life and you're just. You're just in it 24/7 no, I'm definitely the same. Same online and offline. Like, I post a lot. I'll post stuff from space club space in Miami.
07:07:37.228 - 07:07:54.764, Speaker A: I post that online, same place. I post my trades. You can see me in person doing that. I think, like, sharing, like, trade information. I'm literally will be on my phone trading while I'm talking to people. People are like, yo, z, how do you tweet so much? They'll see me outside walking around. I'm walking around, my phone in my hand, like, tweeting nonstop.
07:07:54.764 - 07:08:22.114, Speaker A: I'm pretty much the same person online and offline. I would say one thing that's changed for me is being more extroverted and doing more public speaking, because I did zero of that in high school and, like, college. I was way, way, way more introverted. I was always, like, the quiet kid. Whenever I talk, people would usually listen to what I had to say, but I didn't talk a lot. I was, like, captain of some of the sports teams that I played on, but I didn't say a whole lot. It was the other people who talked a lot.
07:08:22.114 - 07:08:59.214, Speaker A: And more recently, I realized over the past few years or so, it's helpful to other people when I'm more outspoken and speak more, talk more about my ideas and everything else, which is why I've been more active with doing that. But it's definitely a learned skill. Public speaking, everything is not. Not an easy thing to do. So who's the craziest person or, like, you know, most influential person or who made you the most excited to, like, get a random dm from probably Arthur. Arthur ayes, for sure. I met Arthur Ashley in space.
07:08:59.214 - 07:09:36.226, Speaker A: I actually went to a talk to see Arthur talk, I think, in 2018, I want to say 2018 during the bear market. And I got to see him talk about, like, BitMex, how he thinks about crypto, and, like, what he thinks about the space, what he thinks about it moving forward. But I've been following him for, like, super long time, and, like, as one of the only prominent black people in crypto, he was huge to me. So getting to meet him in person was super cool. And, like, just being able to talk to him, I think, is cool. When was that, that you got to meet him in person? I met him, I want to say 2021. No, 2022.
07:09:36.226 - 07:09:41.410, Speaker A: 2022 still. It's. Yeah, two years ago. Yeah, relatively soon. Yeah. 2022. I think it was big.
07:09:41.410 - 07:09:55.014, Speaker A: I think it was bitcoin Miami in 2022. Yeah. Okay. And I had one more question, and then I have some questions. I gathered. Yeah. Okay.
07:09:55.014 - 07:10:16.710, Speaker A: So I went around the conference today, and I went up to a bunch of random people and, you know, asked, who is following you? Told them I was doing this fireside and wanted to see if there was any questions from. Yeah, from folks from our fellow, you know, community members. Yeah. So I have a list here. Some of them are serious. Some of them are a bit more silly. Okay.
07:10:16.710 - 07:10:49.196, Speaker A: It can be rapid fire. Some might require a bit, you know, more thought, but we'll kind of go down the list here. So the first question was, what's your alt handle? I don't have an alt. My trade journal is c o n z I m p. It's consent, which is like, consolidation and impulsion. Basically only two things that markets do. So that account was the one I had during COVID is where I posted literally all my trades.
07:10:49.196 - 07:11:11.884, Speaker A: So that was my journal. I just posted it like I was writing to myself, and I had about 100 or so followers on there. When I was posting, I would post, like, every chart, every trade that I took, the amount of risk I was taking. Like, week to week, month to month. All my ideas were just lived there. And then some of my followers were like, yo, dude, you need to publish this. Do more long form stuff instead of just writing a journal.
07:11:11.884 - 07:11:46.180, Speaker A: Like, write longer pieces. So that's when I started writing my substack, which I think was Q 420 21. I want to say I think Q 420 21, but I wrote that sub stack, which is like a longer piece, same format as my journal and everything, and I posted it on my private account. It was private, private trade journal. And then somebody took the substack and reposted it on Twitter, and it just got shit shared super far. That's when that blew up. And that's kind of when my account started going, like, parabolic.
07:11:46.180 - 07:12:05.384, Speaker A: We're like, who is this dude? Like, calling all this stuff, talking about his thesis and everything. But, yeah, I don't have, like, an old account that I shared stuff on. I have a telegram channel where I post trades, but I don't have an old account. Okay, so we'll shut down the rumor. Yeah, no alts. I don't have an alt. No, all the cats, I swear.
07:12:05.384 - 07:12:30.896, Speaker A: Okay, so the next question, I'm gonna just read it as they said it. Have you bought an island? Will you buy an island? When will you buy an island? No, I have not bought an island. And I don't plan on buying an island. No. All right, you heard it here, folks. No island. Okay, so this next question, I thought this was a really interesting one.
07:12:30.896 - 07:13:08.642, Speaker A: Someone was bringing up the bowdoin, the Biden bowdoin. And the question is basically, like, how do you choose which ideas you're gonna seed into memes? Like, you know, there must be many ideas that go through your head a day or many things that you're seeing online. And, like, what is that process? Like, how are you kind of choosing things that you're gonna put your time into? And maybe with that one, like, what was it that you were like, oh, this is funny. I'm gonna, you know, jump on this train, or. Yeah. What's that process like? That's a good question. Yeah, I said this on a pod the other day.
07:13:08.642 - 07:13:51.174, Speaker A: I think if you were to ask somebody if you thought memes on the Internet were ever gonna go away, everybody would say, no, no shot. Memes that exist on the Internet since its introduction are gonna be around forever. Just with more people being online, everything's going to be memed. Stuff's going to go viral. And so because of that, the total addressable market now for all these meme coins is, like, infinite. Anything that's been popular on the Internet or pops up or goes viral in pop culture or, like, on social media, people can literally just turn it into a meme instantly. And with that, you're just going to have a ton of options on, like, what memes you want to buy, what you want to trade, and all of that.
07:13:51.174 - 07:14:15.326, Speaker A: I would say, like, how I decide which memes I think are going to be good ones. It's mostly three things. It's like, the first thing I would say is how relatable it is. And that's talking about, like, say, somebody has no idea what crypto is. Absolutely zero idea. Couldn't tell you what an l one is. L two is defi any of that.
07:14:15.326 - 07:15:04.454, Speaker A: If you show them a picture of whatever meme coin, how likely is it that that's relatable to them? So one of the reasons that I think with dog with hat did so well is because it's just a dog with a hat. You don't need to know anything about crypto or finance or anything to understand, oh, it's a picture of a dog with a hat. It's funny. So it's like, super relatable people, and that's kind of like your retail score for how likely it is that somebody would like the meme. Laugh at the meme, whatever else. The second thing I think I would say is distribution. So distribution with these memes is super, super important in the early days of forming community, because if you have somebody who has, like, 10% of a coin supply, it's super hard for a meme to hit escape velocity because they're constantly going to be selling or tewapping out.
07:15:04.454 - 07:16:11.684, Speaker A: And also, if it's in a single person's hands, nobody's really going to want to buy. So distribution is really big because you want a ton of smaller wallets with smaller positions in the coin early that are just really active. And then if you have a ton of people in at low market cap, that's typically when you see these Colt communities form as stuff goes up, like, oh, I'm in from solo anyway. My price basis is basically, cost basis is basically zero. My targets are like infinity or whatever else. And then I would say the third thing is, like, the virality aspect, and it's probably not the most, probably second most important one outside of relatability. But you can have something that's relatable to a lot of people, right? But then the more important piece is how is it going to go viral? So for something to go viral, you either have to have connection to some current events that's going on, or like, somebody big who's pushing it, or somebody with a ton of influence that people listen to that's pushing it, or just like, a super large amount of people that already have access to it.
07:16:11.684 - 07:16:50.588, Speaker A: And with bowdoin specifically, the way that can go viral super easily is through the election. So, like, Trump and Biden are going to be speaking nonstop all year. People are going to be talking about politics all year. The election is going to be front, face front of media and all of that. So it's like, if there's any kind of connection that people can make between Bowdoin and the election, whether it's making fun of Biden or like, whatever, Biden's support is supporting it, Trump's supporters supporting it, whichever, that's like, one of the ways that could really go viral. And if you look at last cycle, the reason that those went to literally 100 billion market cap is because of Elon. And Elon was talking about it nonstop.
07:16:50.588 - 07:17:37.984, Speaker A: So it's super easy for it to go viral because he's literally the richest person on the planet and he's nonstop talking about doge. So everybody who knew what Elon was like, okay, I'll buy $10 worth of doge, I'll buy $100 worth of doge. So, like, his distribution was just crazy. And then I think, I don't know if, like, the fourth thing I would say is, like, how you can connect the meme to other things that already exist aren't directly the meme. So, like, whiff is another good example where it's, like, the hat, if anybody's wearing a hat, hat stays on. That's connected to with, and people's minds already make the connection to with. And I think a lot of other memes are kind of similar in the way that you can extend them out and put attach them to other things, which is, like, super, super powerful for making stuff go viral.
07:17:37.984 - 07:18:21.124, Speaker A: I think your point on kind of the notoriety of the name, whether it's, like, biden, bowdoin or Elon Musk, like, going on and referencing dogecoin, that can go so far. And then also the really cool thing about the Internet and about memes is that it also doesn't have to have those things to sometimes go super viral. Yeah. You know? Yeah, it's really interesting. Yeah. All right, so another audience question we had is, what is your daily average screen time so high? Honestly, I can probably check it. It's got to be, like 1012 hours or maybe higher, depending on if the market's hot, you're in a safe place? I think most people.
07:18:21.124 - 07:18:50.394, Speaker A: Most people, it's probably 1012 hours in this room. So there's no judgment here. It's super high. Super high. Okay, so what is bad advice on trading that you've received, and maybe someone in the traditional trading world world gave you advice, and when you came to crypto, you realized it was wrong, or maybe someone in crypto trading gave you some advice. Is there anything you can think back on where you're like, you know, I didn't listen to that. I stuck to my intuition, and I'm so glad I did.
07:18:50.394 - 07:19:50.996, Speaker A: Yeah. Something came to mind almost immediately, I think. So a lot of, if you read your normal ta books or listen to a lot of buy the book traders, some of them will tell you to risk the same percent on every single trade. I think that's actually really bad advice, because if you risk the same percent on all of your trades, you don't size up in positions where you have more conviction, and you also don't size down in positions where you don't have as much conviction. And I think the differentiator between really good traders and just like average traders are those, like, when they hit big, they profit a lot, where it's like, the people who just saw regularly into something they had a lot of conviction in. They don't make as much as they would have if they really believed in their ideas and their thesis. Like, for example, Solana, if I would have just sized that like a regular trade that I take every day, I wouldn't have made as much as I did, like, off that trade this past year or so where I was super, super confident and it was a situation where I was against a lot of people.
07:19:50.996 - 07:20:19.682, Speaker A: I knew that if I was right, it was going to pay out a lot. So I think that's a really good one, like, not sizing the same on all your trades. And then something else I think is really helpful is like, just journaling in general. In general. Because anybody can learn ta, anybody can read a chart, anybody can look at a meme and decide, like, if I want to buy or sell it. But the biggest thing for really being a great trader is the psychology aspect. So you have to be able to forgive yourself when you're wrong.
07:20:19.682 - 07:21:12.268, Speaker A: You have to be able to know when you're euphoric, like when you're upset with yourself and be able to manage your emotions in a way that doesn't affect your trading. And I think that's, like, really, really, really important. So if you journal on a consistent basis, whenever you're in some trades, you know how you're feeling about the trade, know, like, how the market is feeling generally, and then you can look back on that and reference that in the future when you need to look back and see, why did I make this decision or why did I do well with this but do poorly with this? And then it also just helps with tracking all your positions on a regular basis. Okay, well, we have just under a minute left, so I have one final question for you. And this question is, if you could go back in time and let's pretend you're sitting right here, but instead of me. It's 2020 Ansem. Okay, what would you want to tell him? 2020 Ansem.
07:21:12.268 - 07:21:49.030, Speaker A: Yeah. Sell jewel, probably. I think. Yeah, I would say, like, so when you hit a lot of trades back to back to back to back to back, which is what happened to me in 2020, 2021, I didn't miss a lot of trades consistently for a while. I was, like, on a super hot streak, and eventually I was like, okay, I think market is top. And I called the market top as well, pulled money out of the market, but I wanted the trades so bad because I was so confident in my ability to trade that I was like, okay, I got to get back in the market. What am I missing? I couldn't just sit and be like, I'm good.
07:21:49.030 - 07:22:22.432, Speaker A: Like, I'm chilling. I don't need to trade right now. So I think an important part of trading is also being able to step back and just, like, be able to take time away from the market because the market is always going to be there. There's always going to be trades to take. Whether you take off a week, a month, a year, two years, there's always going to be be some trade that's like an amazing trade that's there that you missed or you took the trade. So I would say, like, when you hit big, if you do hit big and you do well, like, just take some time away from screens. You don't really need to be trading 24/7 especially if you're confident.
07:22:22.432 - 07:22:42.566, Speaker A: Like, market is chilling for a bit and then have hard invalidations for when you really, really feel like you need to get back in. But that's what I would say, like, being able to take time away from the market. Amazing. Well, thank you so much, Ansem. It was a real pleasure to get to speak with you and, you know, very glad to have you as our main character. And thanks for being here. Cool.
07:22:42.566 - 07:23:35.482, Speaker A: Thank you. Thanks. On stage, we will have George Harrop again, and it's about Bloomberg of Solana. And thanks again to Ansem and Mia for this friendly and sincere and warm talk. Thank you, GM. Hello. I'm back.
07:23:35.482 - 07:24:03.650, Speaker A: I'm back. I'm going to be back one more time before we go because we're talking to Toli soon. Thanks so much, Ansem and Mia, great job again. This is me. I'm a chicken on the Internet. But today we're going to be talking about, again, I like to talk about crypto businesses and how they operate. I mean, obviously I run one, but it's a way to make something sustainable in this space.
07:24:03.650 - 07:24:28.304, Speaker A: Right? So you've got to be able to deliver value to people, and people have got to be able to value that as something that they actually want. Bill Gates didn't get rich by stealing candy from babies. He got rich by people actually buying a product, which they want. So that's something to keep in mind. Right. You've got to build something that people want. So one of those companies we're going to talk a little bit about today is called Bloomberg.
07:24:28.304 - 07:25:05.864, Speaker A: And what that word means to a lot of people can be a lot of different things, and it's kind of a boring tradfi. We're not talking about smart contract, crazy options trading, perpetrating Dexs. We're not talking about that, but we're going to be talking about a lot of cool, fun things. So let's see if my clicker works. And I can click over here, I can click over there, I can click away. There's a company that does a few things. So when we are talking about.
07:25:05.864 - 07:25:28.506, Speaker A: Let's keep going. When we're talking about Bloomberg, Bloomberg, what is it? It's a giant financial media organization in tv and print. Right. We have the Bloomberg TV. They do like 24/7 coverage, maybe something like that. But they're known as a financial media organization. They're usually the first to break the news in financial media.
07:25:28.506 - 07:26:05.568, Speaker A: So that's probably their distribution mechanism of how they get the word out there in the financial world. The core product as well of what they sell, is a thing called a terminal, the Bloomberg terminal. This is how the world trades. Everyone who works in an investment bank or any sort of business like that, brokerage and so on, a lot of them have access to a thing called a Bloomberg terminal. And a Bloomberg terminal is how people do trades. So if you're in a bank, this is what people are using. So that's also a really core part of their business.
07:26:05.568 - 07:26:39.950, Speaker A: Let's do clickity click. They also do data and research. So data and research. It's people analysts. They probably, of all the financial analyst places that people work at, I mean, Bloomberg's probably one of the core important ones that people listen to. And they also do IRL events, they do webinars and all these sorts of things, so good for them. But they are also a multibillion dollar market cap business, and that's essentially what we're trying to do at step.
07:26:39.950 - 07:27:09.340, Speaker A: So what we're trying to do at step, this conference is an example, actually. At step, we started as a portfolio dashboard. We're providing data. You connect your wallet and you're able to see all the different positions of your wallet. We've been one of the most active apps in Solana since forever. So 330,000 monthly active users. It usually goes wallets and then maybe a few dexs, and then it's usually us.
07:27:09.340 - 07:27:24.186, Speaker A: So it's usually top five, something along those lines. But step, the product, very important. That's our core product. So that's the data side of things. We also have Solana allstars, Solana All Stars. We've got a lot of all stars in the audience. Put your hand up.
07:27:24.186 - 07:27:51.204, Speaker A: If you're a Solana all star person. We've got a lot of the people coming here today from Solana all stars, so that's really cool. But three countries, 30 plus cities, 20,000 attendees, 3000 plus people monthly. I mean, people get excited about Solana breakpoint once a year. Breakpoint gets about 3000 attendees. Attendees, awesome. We get 3000 a month at our meetups.
07:27:51.204 - 07:28:47.164, Speaker A: And that's growing at a clip of like ten to 15%. So if we're talking about places that people can go to onboard, a lot more people into the Solana ecosystem, this is what we're solving for. So all stars is all about distribution, it's about education. During the bear market, I might just phrase this, a lot of defi apps out there, they were lucky if they had 50 users. I actually know of some, and look, it kind of sucks because in a bear market, number go down, not as many eyes on the product, and there's nothing too much that you can do about that. But in a bull market, a lot of the time, the situation changes, but in a bull market, you get a lot of people shouting and going, hey, look at my thing, looked at me, talk about my product, and you get this proliferation of a lot of different products. So it's much harder to cut through and actually get your product in front of real people.
07:28:47.164 - 07:29:25.804, Speaker A: So what we do at Allstars is we also have an amazing bunch of, I think about eleven or so sponsors who are part of the All Stars program and getting their products into the educational content as well. And we're teaching people about trading on dexs, downloading wallets, NFT platforms and what they can do there, and how to mint and so on. So a lot of these different topics are what we cover at Allstars. That's very important. Step I mentioned before something I think that number is 3.5 million users, maybe closer to four at the moment, 330K monthly active users. That's great.
07:29:25.804 - 07:29:48.414, Speaker A: It's a place ideally at step. Our core product, the data product, we want it to be the front page of Solana. So being the front page means that it's a place that you have open on your browser every day. It's a tab you never close. And that's what we want to do at step. So, data side of things, we also have Solana floor. That's another part of our brand.
07:29:48.414 - 07:30:23.426, Speaker A: So when I spoke before about Bloomberg and how they have tv and media, right? Tv and print media, this is our version of that. So about two years ago, by the way, I think we're the only company in Solana that's done. Two acquisitions, maybe Sharkey, I think someone told me that they did some as well. But anyway, two acquisitions. One of our acquisitions two years ago was Solana floor. Solana Floor was the number one NFT analytics platform, still is, by the way. And we acquired it because we're like, yo, we don't know anything about this NFT stuff.
07:30:23.426 - 07:30:50.428, Speaker A: We need to have a foot in the door. And at step, we covered a lot of the Defi things. So that was important to us. But in order to spin up, I mean, who are we going to hire? You can't just hire people like that. So anyway, we acquired Solana floor, but what happened during that journey was, oh, a lot of people follow Solana floor. They're really engaged. And it's a different type of user than what we had at step NFT people, basically.
07:30:50.428 - 07:31:20.910, Speaker A: So it's a brand that we shouldn't just, you know, go away with and get rid of. We wanted to keep it, we wanted to keep the brand intact. And then it sort of, it sort of dawned on us that, you know what, actually, we want to start serving more content and we want to have a strong community around that content. So we made it a news platform. So Solana floor is Solana's number one news platform. It only excludes exclusively focuses on Solana. So that's also a very important thing for us.
07:31:20.910 - 07:31:47.890, Speaker A: There's other crypto news publications out there. There's a lot of, we've got a lot of great publications that defiant is also helping us out with streaming. There's a lot of crypto publications that focus on the entire sector. That's great. Our niche in this sort of world is just focused on Solana. So, yeah, 15 million weekly impressions. I think that number, it's over the last couple of months, additive something along that, 500K users and so on.
07:31:47.890 - 07:32:16.636, Speaker A: So two to three x growth in the next twelve months is what we're targeting and it's going really well. If you tune into the feed from Solana floor, it's really awesome. So assemble like Voltron. This sounded cooler when I wrote it the other day, but essentially we have all these different parts of the business, right? So we got step, it's about the data. We got Solana floor, it's about the news. We got crossroads. Awesome.
07:32:16.636 - 07:32:44.490, Speaker A: That's about the IRL conferences. We've got all stars, which is the meetups every other couple of weeks in 30 different cities around the world. By the way, those cities, they have meetups in them every two and a half weeks. So it's a consistency, right. It's all very well to do one meetup once a year and then go, right, job's done, see you next year. But to actually do it consistently every two weeks, that's how you get power users. We also have step data insights.
07:32:44.490 - 07:33:11.872, Speaker A: This is our research arm. And the next billion, you'll see me talking on podcasts. And we've actually done some cool stuff. We did a documentary as well that you might like. So steps forward and back, essentially. PMF, for us, is a never ending journey. And by that, I mean that at step, we had a product, it did data, and we were like, well, what do we do next? How do we get more users? It was the depths of the bear market.
07:33:11.872 - 07:33:46.912, Speaker A: SBF had wrecked everyone. Things were blowing up all over the place. There's, like, grenades falling down, and we were like, what can we do next? To try and get some traction with people? So that's why we went down the path of media and. And IRL events. But it also means that maybe there's some rabbit holes that aren't worth pursuing. And we have pursued a lot of those rabbit holes. We've spent six months building out something that nobody uses and wasting sort of time and effort doing that, thinking that something is going to go somewhere where it actually doesn't at the end of the day.
07:33:46.912 - 07:34:09.454, Speaker A: But you know what? You have to experiment. You have to come up with something. The world is bigger than the English speaking world audience. This is an important one as well. So we have the simultaneous translations. If you don't already, or if you're listening through a friend's headset in Turkish, please go out the front and get one. We'll have 300 more tomorrow, by the way, because we need more.
07:34:09.454 - 07:34:26.612, Speaker A: And so, yes, basically, a lot of Solana content is focused on English. Now, that's kind of unfortunate, but it means that the. The world is big out there. We have Turkey with 30 million crypto users. Crazy. That's insane. That's a huge audience.
07:34:26.612 - 07:35:14.794, Speaker A: Right? How much Solana content is out there in Turkish? Not enough is the answer. What about Vietnam in Vietnamese? What about, I don't know, Thai? What about all sorts of different languages around the world? Portuguese, Spanish, whatever it might be, generally, a lot of the content, and maybe that's because obviously, the founding team, us based english speakers and so on, so it makes sense. But in order to be a global product that's relevant for the world, we need content in languages more than just English. So that's something also that we're rolling out very soon. But it's a realization that we've had in building our product. And maybe for people building out there right now in the audience, if you're building a product and you're only focusing on english users, I mean, how many english speakers are there? 1.8 billion, something like that.
07:35:14.794 - 07:35:51.950, Speaker A: 2 billion maybe. Okay, cool. That's one third, 33% market share max potential. What about the 66%? So definitely, I think, focused on that, talking about focus. Key strengths for us, we have to keep reminding ourselves with all these different brands going on, our key strengths are data, community building, IRL events, news media. But the core product, at the end of the day, that brings in a lot of eyes to step, is the dashboard. And that's why we're building a lot of analytics and data things, APIs and stuff like that.
07:35:51.950 - 07:36:40.176, Speaker A: So we just need to keep focused on our key strengths. And that's a struggle for all the people out there that are building their own startups, it is a struggle, especially when, okay, meme coin hype comes and everyone's trading dogs with hats and all these sorts of things and making a squillion billion bajillion dollars, you're kind of thinking, well, maybe I should just make a dog with a hat and then I can get $10 million tomorrow to build my company. But unfortunately, it doesn't work like that. But you need to keep trying new things, and if it doesn't work, keep at it. So another thing is often it's dependent on the crypto market. We've spoken a little bit here today from different people, that when number goes up, everyone's happy, number goes up, yay, everyone's rich. When number goes down, everyone's poor.
07:36:40.176 - 07:37:19.744, Speaker A: We're wrecked again. But that also, for crypto businesses, it's quite pertinent because crypto businesses can go -95% in terms of number of users during a bear market. And I mean, the guy at the end of the road that's selling the shoes, people are always going to buy shoes or they're going to go to the candy store and buy candy. It's generally not too dependent on market cycles like crypto. But if you're selling a crypto product, you can literally lose 95% of your users in the space of a week, which is pretty crazy. But of course, the flip side of that is that you can also gain 500% of your users in a week as well. So double edged sword there.
07:37:19.744 - 07:37:47.924, Speaker A: But the next step, essentially 2024, we're focused on scaling all stars and crossroads. Crossroads. This year is three x last year, three times bigger in kind of every way. So awesome. Thank you very much. So crossroads will be coming to more countries and cities around the world. I don't know if we've.
07:37:47.924 - 07:38:01.756, Speaker A: Oh, maybe, maybe. Okay, Sara Leone over here. Let's go. So crossroads going to be in more places, in more cities around the world. We want to expand it. We want to essentially want to have a crossroads in every. Every continent.
07:38:01.756 - 07:38:19.132, Speaker A: Absolutely. That's the plan. All stars as well. It's growing at a rapid rate. That's the way that we can on board, by the way, this isn't really something that's crazy that we've thought up. Binance has binance angels, and they've onboarded, I think, 1.7 million people to date through these IRL meetups.
07:38:19.132 - 07:38:54.222, Speaker A: And that's why. It's one of the reasons that whatever country you are in the world, there's like 120 countries of which binance is number one in. Why are they number one? Often? It's because they have these binance angels meetups, and they have, essentially, this is people's first introduction to crypto. It's this centralized exchange that's a website with an email and a password. And that's what people think, think crypto is. So we need to get out there, and we need to show them that actually, if you onboard into the decentralized world, you don't have to store your passwords with some custodian. You don't have to give your ownership of your assets to someone else.
07:38:54.222 - 07:39:10.414, Speaker A: You can keep full control of all of your assets. So that's absolutely what we want to do. But all Stars is a very important component of that. We have the step finance v three dashboard. We have some of the step team over here. I think some of the crew is elsewhere, scattered throughout the audience. We've got some hands up over there.
07:39:10.414 - 07:39:33.238, Speaker A: But the v three dashboard is going to be really awesome. It's going to be a really cool product. Essentially, we want to bring all of this together in the step product. So that means the news, that means the event stuff. That means better tracking and insights, protocol specific insights. That's all coming soon. And under active development right now, that's going to be really cool.
07:39:33.238 - 07:40:05.656, Speaker A: We also have the Stepdefi API for those in the audience. This has been something much requested. So step is uniquely positioned in the Solana ecosystem, I guess, to have all of the defi data for everything, because we have to integrate everything. When you see an integration of a radium LP or a zeta perp position or a tensor bid or something like that. We've done custom bespoke integrations with every single one of those contracts. Oh, magic Eden. Okay.
07:40:05.656 - 07:40:30.774, Speaker A: Magic Eden has seven versions of contracts. We're having to integrate all of them. Right. It's been a hard slog, but it's also something that, for us, when we do a new integration, there's no payoff for that. We spend tens of thousands of dollars on an integration. Do we get tens of thousands of dollars for adding a new protocol? No, but if we add no protocols, we get nothing. So it's kind of like we have to do it right in order to get anything.
07:40:30.774 - 07:41:05.514, Speaker A: It's kind of. You don't come to step and you see 53% of your portfolio, it might as well be zero. So you actually have to go there and see as close as we can get to 100%. And that's an ongoing battle. But it means that we want to expose this data to other people. So if you're a wallet out there, if you're an apple, if you're building something cool, if you partake in any of the Solana hackathons, we want to give you the step defi API, come and talk to us. Not quite ready just yet, but we're going to be starting testing of that very, very soon.
07:41:05.514 - 07:41:29.554, Speaker A: And then you'll be able to get any positional data on any wallet, address on the chain. And it all comes from our very complex infrastructure, which. That guy over there, over there with the hat, Dana, you should go and talk to him about indexing and all these sorts of things. Solander floor. We want to grow the team. We're looking for journalists. We're looking for people that are good at content writing.
07:41:29.554 - 07:42:06.074, Speaker A: We want to grow that into, as we said, the Bloomberg of Solana. We want to be writing quality content. So definitely wherever you are in the world does not matter. We've done many Dao incentives as well, where people have submitted content from all around the world. I think at season one of our Dao in step, we had 2000 submissions a week or something like that. Some crazy number, which I think is more than any other Dao combined on Solana as well. In terms of individual payouts, I think it was 253 payouts per week, something like that.
07:42:06.074 - 07:42:42.454, Speaker A: So, okay. A lot of people are submitting multiple times for multiple different bounties, but pretty huge numbers, right? Season two is going to be run in quite a different way because actually scaling that is super, super, super hard. But yeah, essentially, content creators, we want to hear from you. That's what Solana floor wants to do. And yeah, that step, I go back to the concept of a Bloomberg for Solana. A Bloomberg is a business which has a lot of different verticals. They do news, they do data, they do trading terminals, they do research, they do IRL events.
07:42:42.454 - 07:43:34.592, Speaker A: This is what we at step are trying to do. And, yeah, look, thank you so much for being here and it's been an awesome ride and there's still much to learn. But, yeah, enjoy the rest of the conference. Thank you. We will see you again on the stage soon. Well, next up we have a live talk with Arif Khan, the CEO and founder of Alizea AI, who is a research and development studio pioneering the convergence of two revolutionary technologies, generative AI and blockchain. Alice.
07:43:34.592 - 07:44:28.754, Speaker A: AI's mission is to empower decentralized ownership and democratic governance of AI by harnessing the potential of these transformative technologies. So let's have a warm welcome with a round of applause. Arif Khan, right, it's great to be here. I've been working at the intersection of crypto and AI for the past seven years. First at sea level with Singularitynet, and then about four years ago, we started Aletheia AI with my co founder, Ahmed. And this intersection has started getting popular in the past year. But I want to leave you all with an initial question or a seed of a question that you take till the end of this conversation.
07:44:28.754 - 07:45:43.692, Speaker A: And that question is, what is the future of meme coins? What is the future of these meme coins that we are seeing today, and how will they evolve? If you think about version one of them being nfts, version two being the meme coins that we see today, what will version three look like where people can come together and build communities? And we have a hypothesis at Alethea. I'm going to walk you through it and have you understand the intersection of the generative abundance that AI brings. Everyone understands this circle, that AI is an abundance engine. But what we also understand being in the blockchain and crypto world is that blockchains are a scarcity or a trust based engine, right? And it's at the intersection of these two worlds. When they collide, very interesting innovations start to happen, very interesting experiments start to unfold. Now, this is all conceptual right now, but I'll show you one quick example that we started off with almost three years ago, right? So this was the first ever intelligent NFT, right? It's a simple NFT. Instead of making it a static image, we said, hey, let's approach our friends at OpenAI, speak to them.
07:45:43.692 - 07:46:51.514, Speaker A: OpenAI was not well known back then. GPT-3 and private beta, a number of people were aware about LLMs. And so we approached OpenAI and said, hey, can we partner and create this really interesting, unique, intelligent NFT? An NFT that can talk, learn, evolve, learn from its users, right? Not just be a static asset. So this pioneered a new category called intelligent nfTs, which aletheia has been pioneering for the past few years. But what's really interesting is as we start to grow and evolve, and you think about aletheia AI, or even just traditional businesses, right? If you look at and think about Disney, a web, one version of it, where you have the studio, you have the animation, you have the talent, all of these are physical assets, right? And if you look at a web, two sort of play, like Unreal engine, or the Epic Games ecosystem, you start seeing interesting things come along when all of these network effects collide. But when you start combining AI and crypto together, you get some really weird and interesting effects. And I'm going to show you one today as well, which I think will answer the earlier question I planted in your mind.
07:46:51.514 - 07:48:09.796, Speaker A: And that is really when you start looking at the applications that AI truly enables, because AI provides, at a horizontal level, massive amount of consumer use cases. So AI, for example, chat GPT, has about a billion plus users, LLMs provide an interface people like to interact with chatbots, communicate, learn and really understand, and even upload datasets to AI's, right? So from an application standpoint, AI does provide that capacity to interact with the consumer. So if you think about at the blockchain or scarcity level, when you think about the protocol level, you start thinking about how we can actually transmute some of these assets and bring them on chain and make them transactional, or even make them scarce and verifiable. So all of these network effects combine to create the AI protocol ecosystem that we have built. And aletheia AI now is in its third season. When we started off with intelligent nfts, with now characters that we can bring to life, and also AI agents. But today, we're very excited to talk about something that I think will be an evolution of what a meme coin can do or what an intelligent meme coin might be like, right? And so let me show you one example of a computer vision model that we have just released.
07:48:09.796 - 07:48:51.996, Speaker A: It's called the emote engine, but this is an animation now created within a matter of 60 seconds, high fidelity. Forgive me for using his face. But like, the reason that this is part powerful content is because you don't necessarily need powerful 3d rendering graphics processing units to create this type of content. This type of content can be delivered over the cloud. It is an AI model that is quantized, that can work as you upload any image from a single image. And some of the people in this audience have experimented with and tried this at our booth today, as well as they created their digital twins. You get this highly emotive, expressive AI avatars or characters that can be used in games.
07:48:51.996 - 07:50:00.044, Speaker A: So think of one of our favorite main characters at this conference, Ansem. Right? Like think of interacting with Ansem if you wanted to, as you chatted with him, and he winks at you and he winks at you, and then he refers you to a meme token that's about to succeed, and then he rug pulls you, right? So, and that way, this entire story or this interactivity that's possible with this digital characters is what the AI emote engine really empowers, right? And so this is something that we have released, and we are going to bring this on chain and show you how this would actually work, right? So I think the exciting part about some of this stuff is that all of these characters, all of these AI agents that are coming in season three can do real time, coherent interactions. Number one, they can be generative. So these digital twins can create generative content. You don't necessarily need to go and create manual content anymore. An AI agent that is actually intelligent can create multiple types of content in multiple different languages, translating it from one white paper. So the opportunity to be able to spread the message of that AI is going to become very, very relevant to all of that global demographic.
07:50:00.044 - 07:51:02.098, Speaker A: What's also interesting is the long term memory and context combined with, I think, key criteria, and that is on chain liquidity and activity. So on chain liquidity. When AI agents start having on chain liquidity, when they start having their own wallets, just like a kid, as a kid is growing up. And as the parent starts teaching the kid about financial discipline, when the kid gets their first pocket money, they can decide what to do with that pocket money. Do they go out and buy a candy bar, or do they go out and buy a book that they want to read? Similarly, we are at a stage today, especially with a platform like Solana, where transaction speeds, with the ability to tolerate stress levels in the magnitude that other networks cannot tolerate. You are looking at the possibility where these AI agents themselves start to do very interesting on chain actions, because remember, these AI agents now have programmable memory. They look human, they sound human.
07:51:02.098 - 07:51:37.882, Speaker A: They will start doing on chain actions. And so AI agents, before this moment, did not necessarily have crypto wallets. Now that these AI agents have crypto wallets, the question we have to ask ourselves is, what does this mean for the broader ecosystem? So, enough talk. Let me show you one example of what this looks like in like a video sort of demo, just so you get a sense and feel of it. And you can start playing with some of these tools to bring your creativity to life. Introducing the future of agentic AI, where your imagination meets reality. Meet your very own AI agents.
07:51:37.882 - 07:52:03.754, Speaker A: Imagine having a friend who's as real as can be right on your screen. An AI agent is not just any character. It's like a virtual twin, with expressions, personalities, and autonomy. It's not just about texts. It's about a real connection with another being. Watch as your AI agent initiates conversations just like a friend would. Let's see Jake's conversation with Cristiano Ronaldo as a star footballer and his inspiration.
07:52:03.754 - 07:52:34.418, Speaker A: And yes, just like any real person, our AI agent can respond with gifs, create images, share links to videos, and answer questions. But that's not all. Cristiano Ronaldo is not the only AI agent Jake owns. Bella, his personal AI assistant, one of many AI agents the Jake owns. Like any other contact in your contact list, Bella can send you texts to say hello anytime. Let's see. What if we ask Bella about the weather today? There you have it.
07:52:34.418 - 07:53:18.052, Speaker A: Reliable weather update at any time. That too, just a text away. Every eight. Agent is unique according to its occupation and personality. Unlock the possibilities, unleash your creativity, and discover the full potential of agentic AI with us. So what's really interesting is when you start combining these AI agents that look human, that are able to interact like a human being, and then you start looking at them as on chain assets, where they actually have a wallet, and that wallet has liquidity in it, and even their own native token. We experimented this with our community recently, and we've selected one agent that was created by a community member, and this agent is called Gen.
07:53:18.052 - 07:53:53.662, Speaker A: So I'll just show you an example of what the community is creating. Forgive me if it's a slightly more interesting example for the crowd here, but let me just show you an example of Gen. So, Gen is the first ever on chain AI influencer, revolutionizing digital engagement with her proprietary meme token. So she's an AI agent that has her own liquidity pool. She has her own meme token. She's able to create content and she's able to create selfies on chain and mint them as nfts. She's able to generate these nfts and mint these and create these selfies as you interact with her.
07:53:53.662 - 07:55:05.258, Speaker A: So these selfies are going to be contextual. What's also interesting is that she has her own Twitter profile completely auto populated based on her personality. She has her own telegram bot where you can interact with her and she can also take actions on chain for you once you start interacting with her. So if you have her, if you want to give it a try, you can actually start interacting with Jen today and see the impact of what an AI influencer would have once it starts to have its own meme token, once it starts to evolve and starts creating its own community. How far can we push this experiment in terms of the intelligence this AI agent can get? What I know from the way Jen has been programmed by her creator is that Jen, as you interact with her, is going to be able to reward you with her ecosystem with her own meme token. And I think what's interesting about Jen is because of the number of transactions that that she has to do, Solana is a natural fit for her ability to be able to interact with thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of people eventually. Because these AI agents are essentially multidimensional, they are able to interact with millions of people at once.
07:55:05.258 - 07:55:36.376, Speaker A: They are not limited by our human ability to be restricted to this meat space body. They transcend the boundaries of time and space, so they are able to interact with millions of people, people at once. Combine that with an underlying token economic infrastructure and you start getting a very interesting experiment unfolding so you can experience gen live. We have had some experiences already with the team below at the booth, so it's been a pretty fun experience. It works with the phantom wallet right now. I think you guys can give it a try. Let us know your feedback of how Jen is interacting with you.
07:55:36.376 - 07:55:56.440, Speaker A: Just FYI, she is. I think I see some young folks in the audience, but I think she's in the 18 plus category in the sense that she does swear, she does talk a lot, she does cuss at you. She's very direct. Her starting tagline is I ain't no vc's bitch. So it's a bit of a rougher character. Give it a try. Let us know what you think.
07:55:56.440 - 07:56:29.208, Speaker A: It's a community created character. But what's really interesting is about the Ali agents platform that has been launched is this intersection as you start thinking. Thinking about the question of meme tokens and how they will evolve over time. How AI really brings all of these agents to life. Think about the next evolution of meme tokens. Think about how this generative AI technology that is coming to market is going to transform what is really a static image or what is just community. How will AI start interacting and playing in this new field? So with that, I leave all of you to try.
07:56:29.208 - 07:57:13.854, Speaker A: Jen, thank you so much for giving me your time. Looking forward to it. Chatting with all of you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Arifan, for this amazing presentation. Well, we will have an announcement for everybody in English and Turkish after this long awaited session. This is the last for today.
07:57:13.854 - 07:58:15.370, Speaker A: We will have a special announcement at the end. Please don't leave the room. It's regarding Ansem. There is a surprise. All right, so with that, it's time for our last fireside chat for the day. We have none other than Anatoly Jakhovenko, the co founder of Solana and CEO of Solana Labs. As a pioneer, he has almost two decades of experience building high performance operating systems, including leading OS development at Qualcomm and holding engineering roles at Dropbox and Mesosphere.
07:58:15.370 - 07:58:52.406, Speaker A: Please welcome Anatolia Coenko with a live link. And our George Hareb is going to be leading, moderating the conversation. Thank you. Hello? Hello, tolly, can you hear me? Gm, how are you? I'm good, I'm good. Welcome to Solana Crossroads. Just FYI. So we're here in Istanbul.
07:58:52.406 - 07:59:15.294, Speaker A: I'm currently standing in front of an audience of. There's a couple of thousand people here today. We've got builders in the house, we've got other protocols on Solana. Right at the end of the day, you're like, I know it's like really early for you, but we're right finishing our day now. So you're going to take us off. We're going to have some fun. It's going to be good.
07:59:15.294 - 07:59:51.114, Speaker A: But thank you so much for. Yeah, yeah. Thank you so much for joining us today. So we're going to be talking about the latest things that are going on in your head and what's going on with Solana and all that sort of stuff. Yeah. Maybe a good, a good way to start is where are we at in terms of Solana in 2024? There was some scaling stuff that we've been dealing with in the last few years. We've had a few outages and we can talk about Anza, we can talk about other things there as well.
07:59:51.114 - 08:00:54.424, Speaker A: But in terms of your mind, what are you thinking of where Solana's at? We're still mainnet beta as well, by the way, for those out there. But toli, to hear from you, where are we at in 2024 in Solana, so folks can stop calling it beta at any time. It's just my personal preference is that we do that after fire dancer ships, because the thing that I think is most important in these networks is verifiability. And when you have a single client, you have a single point of failure just because you have a single set of humans that have worked on one client. And if you look at even the original byzantine fault tolerance paper, the folks talk about that you need multiple teams that are independent building the implementation. So you have this idea of kind of reducing the bus factor, as we call it in engineering. You want different people to work on the same component.
08:00:54.424 - 08:02:05.184, Speaker A: So the probability of a bug being in both of them is virtually zero. So that's kind of my view, and I think we're making really good progress, especially on stability. I kind of look at all of these events that cause Solana to struggle right now as a blessing, because my view is within five years, we're going to have a trillion dollars worth of stable coins, at least. And right now we get to see the network through economic incentives, through meme coins, through inscriptions, through nfts, stress test parts that were blessed to stress test with meme coins and not with a trillion dollars worth of stable coins. So right now, we're lucky to get to find those bugs and fix them. And I think, as you've seen over the last four years, in a lot of ways, I think, got lucky with the design, that all the issues that have come up have basically been fixed within a single sprint. And I think that speaks well for all the engineers that put their minds on building the right design and the right bones, and now we get to find any kind of implementation bugs and correct them.
08:02:05.184 - 08:02:28.114, Speaker A: So I guess a lot of these struggles with certainly. Well, actually it's a good thing, right, because we've had congestion on the chain, but congestion exists because a lot of people wants to use the product. That's kind of a good problem to have. Right. So maybe, did it come with that? That part is a blessing, too. Yeah. It's better to fix scaling bugs than lack of PMO.
08:02:28.114 - 08:02:53.932, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I guess if we're going to be talking about scaling, we would be remiss to not talk about fire dancer. So maybe for those in the audience as well, if you want to. We spoke about the multiple implementations, and I think Ethereum is the only one with multiple validation clients out there as well. But Solana firedancer is the new validator client. But maybe tell us a little bit more about that. Set the scene sort of.
08:02:53.932 - 08:04:26.026, Speaker A: What are we looking at with fire dancer? How's it going in terms of sort of what you're seeing? And, yeah, go from there. Well, you can follow all their work in their open source repo on GitHub. And what's really cool about what they're doing is that they're basically taking the Solana protocol as is and demonstrating that if you knew the end state and you had a bunch of really good engineers, you know how to build it, right? The Anza engineers, unfortunately, had to build it and design it and get it to market at the same time. So there's technical debt there, but if you do it from scratch, you know the end state, and you can show that the same design scales with hardware without any changes to the protocol. And that's really, really important, because once you get to the stage where the only difference that you need to do is add cores, it's a very powerful system, because every two years, there's twice as many cores for the same amount of dollars. DSMC, Nvidia, all of these folks working on AI, they're all pushing this very, very large semiconductor industry forward, not even just crypto, but everything in the world that depends on semiconductors pushes it forward, and that causes these very massive improvements in scale and performance. So, in my experience, working at Qualcomm, once you got the design to that point where all you need is hardware, you're done with the not even just computer science problems, you're done with the computer engineering problems.
08:04:26.026 - 08:05:01.332, Speaker A: It's kind of in maintenance mode, and that's ideally where we want to get to. And it's really awesome that firedancer folks, if you've been following their GitHub and their demos and stuff, have clearly shown that every component can scale up. If you add cores, it goes up. And because they get to kind of show off their stuff when they're a bunch of high frequency trading engineers, they're showing. Gail, that even surprises me. You know, unlike a couple dozen cores, they're able to saturate 20 gigs of throughput. And that's, that's awesome.
08:05:01.332 - 08:05:52.834, Speaker A: And the way Solana is designed is that, you know, we're scaling, by scaling TPS, we're scaling the entire chain, because we've demonstrated that consensus number of nodes, all these other dependencies that people think about, they're all really bottlenecks of bandwidth. You can lay that out in theory on paper, and it makes sense. It's very painful to prove that in the implementation. And this is why Solana can have ten times the number of nodes that most other proof of stake networks have. That takes just a lot of implementation work. And fire dancer now, taking that design and showing that you can just scale bandwidth up with the number of cores means that you can use that bandwidth for applications, but you can also use it to massively decentralize the network. If we need 100,000 nodes, that's possible.
08:05:52.834 - 08:06:37.224, Speaker A: So then the market will figure out what those parameters are. It can basically scale to whatever the global demands are. Well, that's a good point, is do we need 100,000 nodes? Like, where's the inflection point of what we. Like? Is it 573,425? 23? Like, why not 422? Like, well, like what's. Yeah, well, what do you think? My job as an engineer is to unblock, and I think that let the world decide where that lands, right? If the, if the, if there is demand for that many nodes that are all verifying and participating consensus, that's awesome. It means that decentralization is super important for global finance. There's so much demand for it that that's what the network does.
08:06:37.224 - 08:07:40.764, Speaker A: I think the bad outcome is if the demand is there and somehow the technology isn't there. This is what I think as an open source code base that it needs to solve that. It just needs to unblock the world. But it's up to the developers, up to the application builders, up to the businesses running on top of the network, providing validator services or transaction flow services or whatever, those are the folks that are through competition are actually going to decide what it looks like. Absolutely. Yeah. So I guess talking on this sort of decentralization aspect and so on, you recently spun out Anza from labs, right? And like, what was the thinking behind that? Is that to unblock people? Is that to reduce friction? Is that to just, hey, there's another team out there with their own direction that can make decisions quicker, or what was the thought process biblical behind that? I'm kind of blessed as somebody that hates management to be in an industry where this is also the fastest way to grow.
08:07:40.764 - 08:08:31.004, Speaker A: So one is we couldn't stop engineers from creating their own company and going and doing their own thing because all the code is open source, all the AP is publicly owned, so anyone can go do this. And it's awesome to see that group of folks come together and go do it, and now do it. As an external company, I think it's easy to say that all those things are possible on paper, and you can even show, hey, look, all the licenses are open source, but it's really hard to demonstrate it in live and show. No, really, it is a fully decentralized network. I can't tell Trent what to do or the acs how to build a code base. I think from a long term open source growth perspective, this is really, really important, because it's. It's a bad outcome.
08:08:31.004 - 08:09:14.908, Speaker A: If you have, like, Linus getting, you know, like, not also having influence over the design, but also having, like, managerial control over. Over the engineers, I think you start losing the benefits of open source where folks feel free to, like, decide, agree, and fight, and, like, really, that, like, design grind is what creates better and better outcomes. It's when you have, like, competition of ideas is how we actually move forward. I think that's a key thing that you just said there, like, the competition of ideas. And I think one of the things which Solana has done and continues to do really well is the prevalence of hackathons, right. Certainly during the bear market, there's a ton of hackathons. Right.
08:09:14.908 - 08:10:39.654, Speaker A: We had the hacker houses going on, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seemed like there was a focus on developers first, of building stuff. And is that sort of what you see as the path forward of, hey, we just need to build a thing? Is it build it and they will come, or is it, like, build it and build it in some way? That maybe they build something sooner rather than later? Maybe there's hackathons, maybe there's other incentives, or what's your thought process around? I guess this inspiring, this competition, like, how do you generate that on day one? Yeah, I think there was a bit of luck for us with timing that we were. We launched in the bottom of kind of the worst time in 2020, right, when I think the world froze up because of the massive crash in both bitcoin and the stock markets. So we didn't really have a choice to stop because we were a tiny company with limited Runway. We had to go and launch. And that window kind of allowed us to establish, like, a group of devs that are very entrepreneurial folks that are really focused on building products and serving users. And when you have that group as your first customer, it's a blessing, because all the engineers that are supporting them start kind of thinking in that loop.
08:10:39.654 - 08:11:50.694, Speaker A: There's a customer that wants to do x. Somehow the core engine is not supporting that. How do we fix that? And once that flywheel started, I think you saw that the design and everything else that was built was built to respond to end user demands like actual end users, and that attracted more developers and kind of got our flywheel going. So I think, I don't know if I would hope that everyone that is an intrapreneur thinks like that, but I don't know. And we're blessed that we got lucky with that initial set of really, really good developers like Armani, like Steph, like Mango, like all these folks that are really focused on serving the end user got that flywheel going. So that's really kind of, I think, has been going for the last four years. And it reflects in the hackathon, we see a very large set of folks that are very different, I think, from the initial ethereum community, which is very research focused, to folks that I want to get PMF, I want to find a niche where I'm really making customers happy and creating a really good product.
08:11:50.694 - 08:12:49.728, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And I guess maybe this comes back to the developer focus, but what's, I guess, your core focus these days? I mean, Solana's been around for a number of years now. There's lots of people in positions that can make decisions. That's not anatoly. So what are the, how do you see growth happening? Like, what do you, like, how are you thinking? Is it a strategic perspective that you're sort of at the sidelines being like, yeah, look, I think this is a focus area that we need to look, look at, and maybe that's, you know, alternate clients? Or is it like, how are you, so are you setting the agenda? Is it just sort of, yeah, or is it just, every time I have an idea at this point, I talk to somebody and they're already working on it, there's, there's somebody in, some company in Orec that's building it already. So that's been really good. It's also been really good that there's been, like really strong pushback on the, on the engineering side.
08:12:49.728 - 08:13:56.164, Speaker A: If I have an idea and it's wrong, there's enough smart people that are very engaged with how the network works that they push, push back. My favorite example of that was Ben from Marginfi, who was really adamant that the problems in congestion, way before we even saw them on the network, blow up in a really bad way, were all in the network stack. It was really, really good to see that an external, like an app developer that's been using the network got that deep enough to understand and debug everything. There was this inflection point in the nineties with Linux where people that were using Linux eventually became the best developers in the Linux kernel. And that's when Linux really took off, is when you start seeing external companies master the, the kernel to the point where, hey, I can build Android, right? Like, you wouldn't even think twice about using something else in the, in, you know, 2003 to build Android. If you're an entrepreneur, that, that's really, really cool. So we're getting there.
08:13:56.164 - 08:14:36.418, Speaker A: I'm at that point like probably mobile is my biggest focus. Yeah, I think there is. It's cool to go kind of do something from zero to one again and see it grow. Like always. Every startup, we almost failed last year and somehow there was this kind of weird bank shot with bonk that really, I think, proved out that there is a path for digital content subsidizing hardware. External digital content built by developers subsidizing hardware. I mean, that must have been, that must have been a really sort of.
08:14:36.418 - 08:14:50.370, Speaker A: What was it? An interesting realization because it was kind of like, okay, the phone. The initial, initial thesis is cool. Like, everyone uses a phone. There's billions of them in the world. They're all Internet connected. We should probably do more crypto things on it. It's a thing, let's do it.
08:14:50.370 - 08:15:13.226, Speaker A: And then, okay, sales are great. And then all of a sudden, boom, like it completely blows up and it's like, wow, actually maybe this is what we should be focusing on. So it is, yeah. Like, what was it? A little bit of a different struggle. The sales were terrible. We, yeah, we wanted to sell like 20,000 units. And day one we sold 2000 and then it was like 50 a week.
08:15:13.226 - 08:15:36.922, Speaker A: So it was, it was a, it was a brutal struggle. And our thesis was that like, crypto's trying to disrupt banks. Banks charge like 2%, you know, or they charge basis points. Right? Like the way the banks measure fees is in basis points. Apple and Google charge 20% to 30%. Yeah. To them, basis points are rounding error.
08:15:36.922 - 08:16:11.010, Speaker A: So there's a massive difference in the kind of fees that centralized providers have in the digital space versus the rest of finance. So I thought that was a very disruptible kind of take. And the challenging part is that like with credit cards, the consumer doesn't really feel that pain. It's a developer that does. Right. A company that has a ton of revenue in Apple and gives 30% of that to Apple cannot hire as many engineers, they cannot produce as much content. Right.
08:16:11.010 - 08:16:38.954, Speaker A: They cannot make as many productivity apps. That really hurts. Like that small business. Apple gets to rake in those dollars and invest them in better hardware, and that works. But there should be a different competitive path. And our thesis was that a lot of digital content has a very power law distribution of users. So a small percentage of users generates the vast majority of revenues.
08:16:38.954 - 08:17:21.726, Speaker A: So could we incentivize developers to actually take some of their content, airdrop it to their power users on a platform that doesn't charge them any fees, and start moving those folks over? So we'll see. We got like a small taste of that with bonk. I would love to see, like a traditional web two company to eventually kind of get it like, oh, yeah, we can build a game and we could give out a bunch of our, you know, skins and us nfts and get a bunch of the players off of Apple. We'll see if that happens. That would be kind of the sign of global crypto adoption in my mind. Yeah. It seems like half the battle is against the app store and the other half is like, okay, yeah, cool.
08:17:21.726 - 08:17:50.472, Speaker A: There's a phone involved, and the phone involved is like the physical proof of life device. But you kind of need two things at the same time to have a product. Like, if you just have an alternate app store, probably not many people are going to use it. Right. You sort of push that forward with the device, then that maybe changes the game. Is there a thinking maybe internally, or what's going on in your mind with, yeah, is it about the app store? Is it about, oh, cool, this phone has a cool camera and it's. How many megapixel? Like, is that important or.
08:17:50.472 - 08:18:20.760, Speaker A: Not really. I think we're at a point where you can build a competitive phone. It's really like at the middle, mid tier range. The hardware is very hard to differentiate. You can build a better phone than Samsung, but it'll take you longer and it'll be more expensive because they have the economies of the scale. Same thing with Apple. It's really, really hard to compete with Google and software because they have the economies of scale there.
08:18:20.760 - 08:18:49.104, Speaker A: Luckily, you can reuse a bunch of their stuff, but still, it's very, very hard to compete and differentiate there. So I think you really need. The app store is the only thing that could really be a differentiator there. And what's weird and cool about crypto is that it's a shared user experience. You have content that creates communities. It's mixed of operating system and social network and finance. It's a really, really bizarre industry.
08:18:49.104 - 08:19:23.994, Speaker A: And to me that's an advantage. As long as it stays weird, it's very hard for Apple and Google to adopt it and subvert it. So the weirder it stays and kind of is an opportunity for us to kind of grow with it. Yeah. Do you think so? Another people would call it a narrative, but it's actually a legitimate vertical of Solana is deep in. Right, so like decentralized physical infrastructure networks. I see that there's maybe a bit more focus in recent times, let's say the last year of Solana with DPN, we got helium, we got some other cool things.
08:19:23.994 - 08:20:21.746, Speaker A: Is that something which maybe changes the way that you go about actively developing something? If we're trying to build these physical networks or just sort of slots into everything that already happens on a blockchain, it's a giant ledger with a bunch of blocks and people put some information in each one. Does that change anything from your perspective? I think this kind of comes to like probably just again, the entrepreneurial spirit of everyone participating in the network is like once you have a cheap giant public ledger, what can you do with it? It is. The ledger itself is very boring. It's an accounting system. It's just a spreadsheet. But if it's an open transparent one, what properties does it have that you can exploit to do something cool when you're. At least I think like I fell in love with helium probably because of my background spending a career in telecom.
08:20:21.746 - 08:21:27.618, Speaker A: The business kind of billing systems that tie a phone call that uses data and a connection to a tower to an actual like client payment are very, very ancient. These are like things that were built in the eighties and they're ripe for disruption. And because they're so old, like even today in the US, you have like roaming fraud, like towers will lie that user ain't connected and actually paid for something. It's crazy to think about that. You have this like the most advanced communication network that we have, right? Built with like latest silicon that can get you one gigabit live FaceTime between a user in China driving at 100 miles an hour and one in the US don't drive that fast, but whatever, you can set up this link, mobile link, that's 100, you know, one gigabit at like 100 miles an hour. But there's no way that the telecoms can figure out who actually should be paying for it because the billing systems and databases are so old. This is bizarre, bizarre state of the world that we live in.
08:21:27.618 - 08:22:29.896, Speaker A: So I think it's in a weird way, like, having this open, transparent Ledger is a way to disrupt a lot of the kind of old infrastructure for finance that exists not just for banking and payments, but even internal systems between, like, seemingly advanced technology companies. So helium is awesome in that it can scale globally. You can have 5G cell providers anywhere in the world. All that stuff is easily tracked and traced, and it's above public ledger. So they benefit from the users that get to nerd out and become like cellular provider geeks and track all the stuff that's happening and making sure that the rewards are distributed in a fair and open way. And that, I think, is like a very critical piece that is often missing in big organizations that are closed because you expect, oh, there's some team that's supposed to be doing that, but in reality, they're understaffed and not in the bottom line for anyone. Yeah.
08:22:29.896 - 08:23:23.418, Speaker A: You know, on a side note, one of my favorite videos is the anatoly meme video that starts with sharding sucks. And then you go on and say some stuff. But I guess one of the things that Solana is famous for is consensus at the speed of light, right? So is that still a thing that a lot of people might say, look, l two s should exist. You shouldn't have everything on one layer. You should have multiple layers doing different things. And why is the logic not separated? Like, is that still a focus for you and Solana going forward? Do you think that, look, we still want to make sure that consensus at the speed of light for everything on one layer is the way to go. I mean, what's your thoughts there? Has anything changed over the last, you know, year or so with all of these different announcements and 5,000,462 l two s? Absolutely not.
08:23:23.418 - 08:24:04.964, Speaker A: I think it's actually, you know, don't, don't fear the competitor with 10,000 l two s. Fear the competitor with one l two. This is kind of how I look at it. I think it's pretty obvious to developers what a pain it is to deal with fragmented state. And the underlying problem is that the l two s themselves don't really address the core kind of hard scaling problems. If you have 100 billion accounts, they can't all fit in a single l two. And if you have that many active users, you have to go route all that information between all the l two s.
08:24:04.964 - 08:24:36.136, Speaker A: It is in itself a bottleneck. You have to solve that problem. And the only way to do it that I know is, again, optimize with silicon. Right. Like, make the system as fast as possible using the hardware that we have, and that will improve by two x every two years. It may be that today it's not fast enough to support the world, but I can guarantee you in 20 years, it definitely will be, and probably within five years. The reality is, is that hardware moves pretty quickly these days.
08:24:36.136 - 08:25:27.632, Speaker A: So that, in my mind, is kind of the core part here is that l two s in themselves don't solve fundamental scaling problems to handle a very large concurrent set, and the developers don't really want to deal with the asynchronous nature of moving state between these systems. It's a very, very hard and gnarly problem. So this is an opportunity for a single giant kind of world computer that synchronizes the speed of light. If I, you know, like, think of what does finance look like in a science fiction world 100 years from now? It's a giant, hyper fast computer where everything moves at the speed of physics, right. It's not a whole bunch of network systems where things are slow and expensive and have to synchronize. Yeah, yeah, no, I love that perspective. I guess we're coming up on time, but sort of.
08:25:27.632 - 08:26:14.300, Speaker A: One final comment. What are you most excited about in 2024, halfway through the year now, we've mentioned a whole bunch of different things, a lot of different stuff going on, but what are you excited for? What gets you up in the morning? Fire dancer making a ton of progress. And my guess is that 50 50 odds will be done before for breakpoint in terms of having a full client implementation running in Mainnet. So we'll see. But I'm very bullish on the kind of progress they're making. You can already see that their full implementation of the runtime handles 200,000 slots. So basically a full epoch at a time.
08:26:14.300 - 08:26:29.776, Speaker A: So there's still like a few small kind of wrinkles there to fix to make sure it never, never disconnects from Maina. But it's making a ton of awesome progress. It's getting there. I love it. I love it. Well, thank you so much for your time, Toli. I know it's very early there.
08:26:29.776 - 08:27:04.002, Speaker A: We have a lot of builders in the audience and people doing cool stuff. I mean, just quickly, is there any final message that you have for peeps? If they're interested in engaging, being part of Solana, doing anything, where should they go? What should they do? Yeah, any thoughts? Yeah, I mean, go to Solana.com, and if you're a dev, seriously, just go jump in into the next hackathon. There's one. There's a couple every year. It's the best place to meet a team. That is a team of entrepreneurs that want to build a product, get PMF, raise capital and scale a company.
08:27:04.002 - 08:27:26.566, Speaker A: It's been awesome to see, like, first time entrepreneurs, like, succeed in that whole path. Amazing. Amazing. Well, everyone, if you could please, like, round of applause for Toli. It's thank you and we'll let you get on with the rest of your day. Tolie. So peace out.
08:27:26.566 - 08:28:20.090, Speaker A: And GM. Thank you, gm. Well, we survived the first day. Thank you so much. I hope you guys enjoyed that. Tolly, it's some really early hour right now, so that's awesome that he was able to join us. So really hope you enjoyed the first day of crossroads.
08:28:20.090 - 08:28:47.846, Speaker A: We've got day two coming up. We haven't even got through a lot of the big ticket items that we want to get through on our list. So definitely tomorrow, come on down. We've got some awesome panels. We've got some really good speakers. And from what I'm hearing, generally, like after every thing on stage, I go and say, hey, is anything wrong? Is there any problems? Everything's good. So there's a few different things that we're going to work out tomorrow.
08:28:47.846 - 08:29:20.796, Speaker A: We're going to get more of the headsets. These are all growing pains, right? I think this is the biggest conference, obviously, that we've ever put on. So, yeah, very exciting and yeah, come join us again tomorrow. Now after this as well, I might say just actually before that, tomorrow we're going to have some cool goodies that are going to be claimable. If you haven't already, go downstairs and talk to some of the teams. I think the Etherfuse guys have claimable bonds and stuff. So definitely go and scan that, claim some bonds.
08:29:20.796 - 08:29:41.620, Speaker A: There's a few more handouts and sort of giveaways. There's merch going on. I think people maybe have already gone through all the merch, I'm pretty sure. But there's going to be more merch tomorrow. Don't worry. So, yeah, definitely go and check out some of that. But everyone outside after this, if you could, would be much appreciated.
08:29:41.620 - 08:30:10.684, Speaker A: We have a really awesome video that we're filming. It's going to be pretty sick. We've got like one of the main characters of all of crypto in the entire world here and a bunch of other really cool peeps. So yeah, definitely if you would head outside after this, that would be amazing. But otherwise, enjoy the rest of your evening. It's been an awesome time, and, yeah, welcome to crossroads and onwards to day two. Thanks, everyone.
