00:00:06.570 - 00:00:23.594, Speaker A: Hello and welcome once again to real vision and the defiance weekly clash of the titans as we pitch the might of macro with the deviousness of defi degeneracy. In the red corner, weighing in with wit, wisdom, and wherewithal, it's the Clark Kent of finance, Ash Bennington. His opponent's in the blue corner, scouring the universe in hopes of any kind of story that isn't about the board apes.
00:00:23.642 - 00:00:26.130, Speaker B: Well, it's me, Ash.
00:00:26.290 - 00:00:30.726, Speaker A: We do have a story to kick off that isn't about the board apes. Do you want to take us through.
00:00:30.828 - 00:00:32.934, Speaker B: Like, the big story in the world.
00:00:32.972 - 00:00:34.166, Speaker A: Of financial markets right now?
00:00:34.188 - 00:00:35.574, Speaker B: The FOMC. Yeah.
00:00:35.612 - 00:00:55.566, Speaker C: So we're filming this here at 10:00 in the morning on Wednesday. So we don't know the results of this fed hike rate talk sort of extravaganza that we've been hearing now for the last few weeks. Let me give you the basics. Let me give you the setup. Let me give you the background. So here's what we do know for a fact. Inflation right now is running at a 40 year high.
00:00:55.566 - 00:01:29.558, Speaker C: We're running at an eight handle. That means that we're seeing 8% annualized inflation based on CPI and some of the other data. The Fed expanded the money supply 40% during the COVID crisis. We've got a balance sheet now that's around $9 trillion. The new news out this morning, actually, is that Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, of course, was out this morning saying the Fed, basically, they're late to the party. They should have hiked earlier. So the bacon on this is that the consensus is for 50 basis points today at the meeting around 02:00 p.m.
00:01:29.558 - 00:01:57.570, Speaker C: But the reality is there's always uncertainty in this. You never know if the Fed is going to hike more or less for whatever reason. I think that the consensus is probably toward more right now. But it is kind of a precarious time in macro. It's a choppy time in macro. If you look at year to date here in US equity markets, Nasdaq 100, Nasdaq Composite, both off 20% on a year to date basis. That's obviously January to May, not a pretty time.
00:01:57.570 - 00:02:27.190, Speaker C: And we're seeing that in the crypto markets as well. You see that same chop when you look at the chart of bitcoin and Ethereum. And that's basically where we are during this kind of like weird pivot point. I'll add one other point. A legendary investor, Paul Tudor Jones, out, I think, yesterday with some really grim comments about these markets, basically saying, hey, you don't want to own bonds, you don't want to own stock. It's an ugly, ugly time. Now, here's an interesting sort of thought, or thought experiment.
00:02:27.190 - 00:03:25.886, Speaker C: Maybe there's this dichotomy out there where you see folks in the crypto space, particularly bitcoiners, though not exclusively bitcoiners, and not all bitcoiners have made this argument, saying that when there is chop in traditional markets, when we see the problems that we've seen with central banks, we've seen with expanding money supplies, we've seen with inflation, crypto assets should rally. Obviously, that has not happened yet to date. So it is this kind of paradox. I think the flip side of that argument is also one that people need to understand, which is when you see a tightening of financial conditions, meaning you see the availability of credit, the ability of investors to get easy access to credit, to buy assets, particularly in this case, as we refer to digital assets, you may see declines in price. That's basically the setup. Paul Tudor Jones described it as the cross hatching pattern you see in the ocean when waves collide, when you see the squares and they tell you not to go in the water because of the riptides. It's an interesting time.
00:03:25.886 - 00:03:33.626, Speaker C: It seems to be something of a kind of an inflection point. We've got to wait to see what the data is saying. We'll wait to see how markets react. Robin?
00:03:33.818 - 00:03:39.826, Speaker A: Well, there's that great maxim, isn't it? Times of uncertainty are actually times of great opportunity, if you know how to read them.
00:03:40.008 - 00:03:42.978, Speaker B: And Paul Tudor Jones famously was one.
00:03:42.984 - 00:03:52.870, Speaker A: Of the early kind of big voices to come out in favor of bitcoin as this hedge against inflation. Michael Saylor followed suit, and so those guys are making a big bet on it. So I guess it's in his interest.
00:03:52.940 - 00:03:56.210, Speaker B: To tout that narrative to a degree.
00:03:56.370 - 00:04:00.426, Speaker A: But it is interesting, as you say, know if bitcoin is to take on.
00:04:00.448 - 00:04:02.666, Speaker B: This mantle as being this great kind.
00:04:02.688 - 00:04:17.086, Speaker A: Of hedge against inflation, that it should see some interest, but it is so risky and so difficult to acquire at scale that how can it take on that mantle? What's interesting is that the cost of transacting on bitcoin is pretty much at.
00:04:17.108 - 00:04:23.566, Speaker B: An all time low. Did you know that? Yeah. And nobody's using it, so they're just.
00:04:23.588 - 00:04:26.494, Speaker A: Hoddling it, which is the wonderful, wonderful.
00:04:26.542 - 00:04:29.934, Speaker B: Paradox about bitcoin, that as an actor.
00:04:29.982 - 00:04:34.738, Speaker A: In financial activity, it sucks. You don't want to use it, you just want it to sit there and do nothing.
00:04:34.904 - 00:04:35.282, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:35.336 - 00:05:29.030, Speaker C: But I was going to say, economists would think about this and say that you basically have the medium of exchange function and the store of value function of a currency acting sort of in opposition to each other. There's something called Gresham's law, which states that, effectively, bad money chases good money out of the system in terms of transactions, because people want to retain hard assets while spending assets that are going to decline. And so it's interesting talking about the paradox, as you mentioned, Robin, it's sort of these nested paradoxes in bitcoin. Bitcoin was originally sort of conceived, if you read the white paper, as a transactional currency. And obviously, what we're seeing is more of the store of value function. Now, obviously, the lightning network is a topic of a great deal of excitement. The level two, that's going to, in the view of many in the bitcoin space, supplant bitcoin for the level two transactions.
00:05:29.030 - 00:06:00.942, Speaker C: In other words, smaller value transactions, the medium of exchange function. But again, incredibly, incredibly early. Look, we do have to say this, though. While we experience all of these challenges in the dFI NFT web three ecosystem, what's bitcoin been doing? In addition to not having high transaction fees, it's basically been performing precisely as advertised. Bitcoiners will tell you this. Hey, well, you guys are out there doing all this crazy stuff on the edge. Bitcoin just keeps functioning as it always has.
00:06:00.942 - 00:06:11.406, Speaker C: Not a maximalist argument, but the reality is, that's just a fact. Bitcoin has not experienced some of the challenges that I suspect we're about to talk about on Solana and Ethereum.
00:06:11.598 - 00:06:13.266, Speaker A: Well, it may not have done, but.
00:06:13.288 - 00:06:17.006, Speaker B: It has done in the past. And it did clog up to a fair degree.
00:06:17.118 - 00:06:29.066, Speaker A: I remember a bitcoin documentary. Roger Ver has got his phone out and he's just zapping bitcoin to people willynilly, as if it's nothing and it's just pennies. And it seems so easy and so wonderful back then.
00:06:29.088 - 00:06:31.306, Speaker B: But at times in the past few.
00:06:31.328 - 00:06:37.530, Speaker A: Years, it was definitely not that. And that does indeed segue us nicely to ETH.
00:06:38.430 - 00:07:19.020, Speaker C: You could imagine it being like this beautiful abandoned beach, right? And you go up on your Instagram, you live stream from this amazing abandoned beach, and you talk about just how incredible it is because there's no one there and you're the only one there. And at the same time, you're streaming your GPS coordinates and suddenly people show up on the beach and it's this challenge of being a victim of their own success. And this is something that we saw in bitcoin historically. Now we're seeing it in Ethereum. We could talk a little bit about Solana, but that's the challenge, is how do you continue to get these networks to function at scale in a way that's economical and that can process the throughput that gets demanded when these networks become victims of their own success?
00:07:19.870 - 00:07:21.418, Speaker A: And it's timely that we should talk.
00:07:21.424 - 00:07:24.314, Speaker B: About that, because over the weekend, the.
00:07:24.352 - 00:07:41.130, Speaker A: Entire collective crypto space held its breath in anticipation of the Yuga labs other side mint drop. And this was unprecedented. The statistics on this are. Well, they're pretty mind blowing. I'm calling up the watch the burn website at the moment, which is fascinating.
00:07:41.210 - 00:07:43.134, Speaker B: You can see a spike here for.
00:07:43.172 - 00:07:52.114, Speaker A: Just how much ETH was actually consumed during this mint. So there are 100,000 of these NFTs on offer, and like 75,000 of them.
00:07:52.152 - 00:08:00.086, Speaker B: Could be, sorry, 65,000 of them could be picked up during the mint. But the amount of ETH burnt on.
00:08:00.108 - 00:08:09.446, Speaker A: That single day, 71,000 ETH. And I think for the mint itself, they were responsible for around $150,000,000 worth of ETH just being thrown in the.
00:08:09.468 - 00:08:11.974, Speaker B: Toilet, which is nuts.
00:08:12.022 - 00:08:18.406, Speaker A: The net issuance on that day was around -58,000 E. So normally the net issuance is mildly positive.
00:08:18.438 - 00:08:20.870, Speaker B: So there's more ETH being issued than burned.
00:08:20.950 - 00:08:25.434, Speaker A: Occasionally it dips below, but it's generally mostly positive. This was just the most massively negative.
00:08:25.482 - 00:08:27.006, Speaker B: Day there's ever been.
00:08:27.188 - 00:08:31.066, Speaker A: And even so, the rewards remain consistent.
00:08:31.098 - 00:08:36.194, Speaker B: At 13,400 e per day for the miners. So the miners didn't see any of it either.
00:08:36.392 - 00:08:43.202, Speaker A: So this was just a huge kind of anomaly blip. And then what was also interesting, that the entire network just shut down.
00:08:43.336 - 00:08:45.698, Speaker B: I actually minted, and I had to.
00:08:45.704 - 00:08:47.862, Speaker A: Pay three ETH and gas to get my mint through.
00:08:47.916 - 00:08:51.640, Speaker B: That's around just under kind of $9,000.
00:08:52.330 - 00:08:56.360, Speaker A: Think about that. Just to get my transaction through. $9,000.
00:08:57.050 - 00:08:58.220, Speaker B: What is that?
00:08:58.990 - 00:09:00.810, Speaker A: What am I doing, Ash?
00:09:01.390 - 00:09:05.340, Speaker C: I mean, that's the most beautiful beach in the world, getting clogged with people.
00:09:06.270 - 00:09:11.642, Speaker B: It is. The big story here is that the.
00:09:11.696 - 00:09:15.274, Speaker A: Yuga labs changed the nature of the mint. They were going to do a dutch.
00:09:15.322 - 00:09:19.818, Speaker B: Auction, and then they changed it to a flat rate of 305 ape.
00:09:19.994 - 00:09:34.178, Speaker A: And they said this because they said dutch auctions are bullshit and they wanted to mitigate gas wars. They even put a beautiful little mirror article out, saying, in three different paragraphs, we want to mitigate gas wars. We want to soften the blow of gas wars. What resulted was the biggest gas war there has ever been.
00:09:34.344 - 00:09:42.838, Speaker B: And I mean, they must have known this is a 16 z have invested in these guys.
00:09:42.924 - 00:09:44.454, Speaker A: You model this stuff out, you game.
00:09:44.492 - 00:09:46.406, Speaker B: It out, and it then led to.
00:09:46.428 - 00:09:49.162, Speaker A: Them admitting in an email chain that.
00:09:49.216 - 00:09:57.706, Speaker B: Perhaps apecoin shouldn't really belong on Ethereum, that maybe apecoin needs its own chain. Do you think that's just kind of.
00:09:57.728 - 00:10:00.154, Speaker A: Theatrics or did they really mess it up?
00:10:00.272 - 00:10:01.600, Speaker B: What's your take on that?
00:10:02.450 - 00:10:37.474, Speaker C: Well, I don't know if it's theatrics. I mean, it's not sort of a far fetched thesis. That board, AP, cub like Yuga labs would want to have apes on their own chain. You would think that that would give them a greater degree of granularity, a greater degree of control, whether or not we get there and what the tokenomics look like and what the structure of this looks like is, I think, very much an open question. But the one statistic I did not hear you mention was how much Ugalabs made on this mint. The number I saw was $320,000,000. Over a quarter of a billion.
00:10:37.474 - 00:10:46.330, Speaker C: Indeed, nearly a third of a billion dollars. This is some real money. So despite the challenges in the system, Ugalabs did very well.
00:10:46.400 - 00:10:47.626, Speaker A: Well, there's a caveat to that, because.
00:10:47.648 - 00:10:48.790, Speaker B: It was raised in ape.
00:10:48.870 - 00:11:04.674, Speaker A: And as we know, you buy the rumor, sell the news, and people did sell instantly. The ape token dropped significantly. So it might have been 320 at the moment of sale, but it did drop a fair bit since then. I mean, I think the prognosis for.
00:11:04.712 - 00:11:15.794, Speaker B: Apecoin itself is pretty good, I would say. But I think what's interesting here is that in public they said, yeah, maybe.
00:11:15.912 - 00:11:35.290, Speaker A: Ethereum isn't the right chain for a game. They've been promoting this game as being able to bring in a huge number of players. They partnered up with Improbable IO, which is a networking specialist for creating massively multiplayer online gaming systems, for allowing people to be social at the same time. Tens of thousands of people altogether.
00:11:35.790 - 00:11:37.286, Speaker B: The scope for this is massive.
00:11:37.318 - 00:11:56.034, Speaker A: And if you want people to interact with each other, to be trading NFTs actively and vibrantly to create that secondary market, Ethereum is not the chain for that, not that scale. So why are they sort of saying that publicly? It's just seemed odd because it would have been probably the first question you ask. Axie Infinity, probably the biggest success story.
00:11:56.072 - 00:11:59.822, Speaker B: Of last year in play to earn thousands and thousands of transactions.
00:11:59.886 - 00:12:04.082, Speaker A: Still one of the largest NFT players in the space.
00:12:04.216 - 00:12:07.666, Speaker B: They built their own chain, ronin. It got hacked, yes, but they had.
00:12:07.688 - 00:12:09.494, Speaker A: To build their own sidechain in order.
00:12:09.532 - 00:12:12.406, Speaker B: To allow people to transact in a.
00:12:12.428 - 00:12:14.134, Speaker A: Kind of more economically fair way.
00:12:14.252 - 00:12:16.406, Speaker B: It was a bit strange, the whole thing.
00:12:16.508 - 00:12:32.790, Speaker C: This is sort of an interesting space right now. You mentioned this idea of the decline the value of ape offsetting the losses that board apes that Yuga would have made on this. But what was their cost of goods sold? Robin, how much did this land cost them to produce?
00:12:32.950 - 00:12:35.440, Speaker B: Well, that's a very good question. I'm glad you brought it up because.
00:12:35.970 - 00:12:42.670, Speaker A: The scale of this is far greater than pretty much anything we've seen. Metaverses tend to have quite a large.
00:12:42.740 - 00:12:48.226, Speaker B: Number of pieces of land, but they're not designed yet. Whereas there was an enormous amount of.
00:12:48.248 - 00:12:52.894, Speaker A: Artwork that needed to be made for this. And of course, some of it repeats across different pieces of artwork.
00:12:52.942 - 00:12:55.314, Speaker B: But when you scale up from 10,000.
00:12:55.352 - 00:12:57.662, Speaker A: To 10,0000, that's an order of magnitude.
00:12:57.726 - 00:13:02.322, Speaker B: More traits, more pieces of art that need to be created.
00:13:02.386 - 00:13:07.974, Speaker A: And it's not like the kind of expansion pack standed over time. This is built from the ground up and it's built using the same art.
00:13:08.012 - 00:13:09.362, Speaker B: Style as the mutants.
00:13:09.506 - 00:13:14.266, Speaker A: There's quite a lot of work gone into this, I don't think they just.
00:13:14.288 - 00:13:16.682, Speaker B: Kind of put it together for zero cost.
00:13:16.736 - 00:13:18.330, Speaker A: There's quite a lot of things that.
00:13:18.400 - 00:13:20.118, Speaker B: Are going on here and still plenty.
00:13:20.134 - 00:13:26.702, Speaker A: Of stuff that needs to be revealed in terms of the gameplay, in terms of what we can actually do. I mean, there are so many talking points this.
00:13:26.756 - 00:13:31.050, Speaker B: But really the main thing is people didn't know what they were buying.
00:13:31.210 - 00:13:36.942, Speaker A: They had very little information. They knew they were called other deeds. And there was a leaked pitch deck which gave people some of the idea.
00:13:36.996 - 00:13:38.162, Speaker B: About what they were buying, but really.
00:13:38.216 - 00:13:39.522, Speaker A: They didn't actually know.
00:13:39.656 - 00:13:41.746, Speaker B: And effectively what you have done by.
00:13:41.768 - 00:13:43.058, Speaker A: Buying another deed has become.
00:13:43.144 - 00:13:46.466, Speaker B: It's basically a pass to be a beta tester for a game that will.
00:13:46.488 - 00:13:51.670, Speaker A: Be free to play for anybody coming in. But you can be a beta tester by owning one of these other deeds.
00:13:52.650 - 00:13:53.810, Speaker B: It's mad.
00:13:53.970 - 00:14:42.614, Speaker C: So there's so much to talk about here. I didn't mean to suggest that their cost of goods was zero. But look, the reality is, any type of software, the margins are enormous when you can sell it at scale, right? That's why SaaS companies have made hundreds of billions of dollars gains in market cap. That's why you see the valuations that we see on Google and Facebook and Amazon, the reality is it's incredibly cheap to produce this. I'm also not entirely clear about the other side. Land offering versus the game, how that gets allocated in terms of where the costs are matched to what raise and how that works. But look, the reality is that this is a very profitable business that Ugoabs is in.
00:14:42.732 - 00:14:44.758, Speaker A: Well, here's the kicker, right?
00:14:44.844 - 00:14:48.310, Speaker B: 5% royalty on secondary sales. 5%.
00:14:48.380 - 00:14:54.490, Speaker A: And they've done 63,726,000 in secondary sales already.
00:14:54.640 - 00:14:58.470, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, this thing is going to be beyond profitable.
00:14:58.550 - 00:15:04.342, Speaker A: And you've got 100,000 assets, all of which have little pieces of them which can then also be traded. I mean, just.
00:15:04.416 - 00:15:05.470, Speaker B: Oh my gosh.
00:15:05.810 - 00:15:37.670, Speaker C: I want to point this out because we mentioned this in passing, but your point is spot on. And it's a really critical thing for people to understand. The ability to actually make money. A 5% royalty on a secondary market in perpetuity is extraordinary. And it's not something that we've generally seen before in the history of commerce. The ability to basically get a 5% royalty at essentially zero cost in terms of the transaction fees, that puts creators in a very powerful position across the board, not just Ugalabs, but for the entire ecosystem.
00:15:38.890 - 00:15:44.774, Speaker A: Well, it does. And I think that was the big selling point of this entire metaverse, is.
00:15:44.812 - 00:15:46.534, Speaker B: That I think a lot of projects.
00:15:46.582 - 00:15:59.278, Speaker A: Right now that aren't in the kind of top bracket are really struggling. They've had all their secondary sales sucked out of the market. And so they're looking at projections for whatever their Runway looks like for the next twelve months to build stuff and promise stuff and keep their community happy.
00:15:59.364 - 00:16:00.734, Speaker B: But they've run out of money and.
00:16:00.772 - 00:16:02.826, Speaker A: They'Re going to be unable to make.
00:16:02.868 - 00:16:08.606, Speaker B: New money unless they can pivot. And the pivot makes sense if you see other deeds.
00:16:08.638 - 00:16:11.330, Speaker A: So there's an SDK that Ugalabs have.
00:16:11.400 - 00:16:17.342, Speaker B: Developed which will allow other NFT projects to port into their ecosystem.
00:16:17.406 - 00:16:21.238, Speaker A: I don't know what that SDK looks like yet. It's a really vital piece of the.
00:16:21.244 - 00:16:23.778, Speaker B: Puzzle here, because if you have Rama.
00:16:23.794 - 00:16:28.598, Speaker C: Can you explain what that means for some of our folks who don't follow the space as closely as you do?
00:16:28.684 - 00:16:30.970, Speaker A: So an SDK is a software development kit.
00:16:31.390 - 00:16:33.226, Speaker B: It's a way of making it easy.
00:16:33.328 - 00:16:46.766, Speaker A: For a developer to come in and build on your system. And like any blockchain layer, one will have it. It's not exclusive to blockchain by any degree, but it's a set of tools to allow anyone who wants to build.
00:16:46.788 - 00:16:50.720, Speaker B: On you to build on you rapidly and with support.
00:16:52.610 - 00:16:54.078, Speaker A: Basically, board apes are a bunch of.
00:16:54.084 - 00:16:56.418, Speaker B: 2D flat images, and if you want.
00:16:56.424 - 00:17:02.466, Speaker A: Them to be able to run around a universe, they have to be translated into a format which will work in that space.
00:17:02.648 - 00:17:05.714, Speaker B: Most PFE projects suffer from that same problem.
00:17:05.752 - 00:17:12.306, Speaker A: They weren't built with 3d components already in, so they've created a system that will allow them to translate the mutants.
00:17:12.338 - 00:17:19.270, Speaker B: And the apes onto the other verse or the other side. And they're open sourcing that, allowing other.
00:17:19.420 - 00:17:22.374, Speaker A: Projects to come and use it. Now, there will be a development overhead.
00:17:22.422 - 00:17:26.474, Speaker B: To that, but it also means that if you're a new project and you.
00:17:26.592 - 00:17:28.346, Speaker A: See that you're going to build a.
00:17:28.368 - 00:17:30.298, Speaker B: Minigame on the other side, you can.
00:17:30.304 - 00:17:45.506, Speaker A: Do it from the get go using this SDK. I don't know what that SDK looks like at the moment, but that's a big cherry on the cake, because everyone else is having to do it by themselves. But if they open source it and allow any project to come in, that means they benefit not only from their.
00:17:45.528 - 00:17:47.346, Speaker B: Own primary and secondary sales, but they.
00:17:47.368 - 00:17:49.362, Speaker A: Benefit from everybody else's as well.
00:17:49.416 - 00:17:51.726, Speaker B: It's genius. Yeah, it's genius.
00:17:51.838 - 00:18:29.658, Speaker C: I mean, Ugalabs has been a leader in all of these kinds of technological. I mean, I feel like I've broken record whenever I say this, but it is incredibly, incredibly early in this space. When we talk about things like SDKs, software development kits, we talk about APIs, application programming interfaces. These are things that have existed in the traditional sort of development space for decades and decades. This stuff is being built up layer by layer. Right now, Ugolab is one of the innovators on the forefront of doing this. But it takes time to create these things in ways that are stable and especially in ways that are secure.
00:18:29.658 - 00:19:03.786, Speaker C: Obviously, there's an incentive structure in the decentralized world to attempt to exploit these systems, because it can be enormously lucrative for the people who do it. And so it's like we're building a bridge and we're walking across it at the same time to get to the other side. This is incredibly exciting, but also, I think it's fair to point out a perilous moment for the ecosystem, particularly for investors who may be coming in and speculating on this without really understanding the nature of the risks and also potentially the opportunities, we should say, well, what.
00:19:03.808 - 00:19:06.634, Speaker B: Was particularly interesting, that people coming into.
00:19:06.672 - 00:19:08.538, Speaker A: This mint were unaware of what a.
00:19:08.544 - 00:19:10.262, Speaker B: Gas war would actually imply.
00:19:10.326 - 00:19:18.506, Speaker A: So a lot of people had kind of scrambled together 305 ape in the hopes that would be significant enough to allow them to participate in the mint.
00:19:18.538 - 00:19:21.262, Speaker B: Which it was, but they couldn't push a transaction through.
00:19:21.316 - 00:19:26.078, Speaker A: So they would find themselves suddenly needing to get an extra two E on top, which is not chump change.
00:19:26.244 - 00:19:28.606, Speaker B: And suddenly they're excluded from this mint.
00:19:28.718 - 00:19:42.166, Speaker A: For those of us that could afford it, great, we're the privileged few. But a lot of people had honestly put together just enough, and at no point had Yuga said, listen, this is going to be the biggest mint in history, and you probably should be aware that this is what's going to happen.
00:19:42.268 - 00:19:51.462, Speaker B: You could have modeled it out, but they didn't. And that left a lot of people feeling very pissed off and a lot of failed transactions. They have actually refunded the ETH for that.
00:19:51.516 - 00:19:54.486, Speaker A: But that's exactly one of those risks.
00:19:54.518 - 00:19:55.946, Speaker B: That if you knew, you knew, and.
00:19:55.968 - 00:20:05.626, Speaker A: If you'd done ICOs in 2017, you would have been very familiar with this. The setup was exactly the same. You could just see it. Limited number of KYCs, limited availability, massive.
00:20:05.658 - 00:20:12.574, Speaker B: High push the gas. It was an obvious thing. Apecoin has since tumbled, but today it.
00:20:12.612 - 00:20:13.934, Speaker A: Suddenly shut up again.
00:20:13.972 - 00:20:18.494, Speaker B: It did a classic pump and dump, all because of one man, Elon Musk.
00:20:18.542 - 00:20:25.006, Speaker A: Who changed his profile picture on Twitter to a composite of a bunch of apes that he'd actually stolen from, I.
00:20:25.048 - 00:20:32.374, Speaker B: Believe, the NFT head at Sotheby's. Yeah. And this is classic Elon, right?
00:20:32.412 - 00:20:34.994, Speaker A: This is just trolling everyone senseless.
00:20:35.122 - 00:20:36.520, Speaker B: What did you make of this?
00:20:37.290 - 00:21:33.158, Speaker C: Know, I'm not really sure. Is Elon sort of aware that in the community, he wasn't actually grabbing an individual ape, he was taking this sort of composite? Did he know that he needed to credit the Sotheby's author, the Sotheby's content creator for it? Was he just sort of grabbing it off a Google image search and maybe didn't know? Open questions. But I wanted to get back to the gas fees question for a minute here, because these are substantial and I wanted to run through some of these numbers. Gas fees, Ethereum gas fees. Now around $500, I believe people paid $10,000 to get executed on this mint, and some folks were paying $5,000 just to get burned. Now, obviously, as you say, uglabs is reimbursing those fees, but these are really extraordinary numbers, particularly when you see it in relation to the price of the underlying asset that they were buying at the mint. A very high proportion.
00:21:33.158 - 00:22:25.420, Speaker C: And I think it's fair to say that transaction fees that represent a massive proportion of the underlying assets are just simply not sustainable for an ecosystem to exist at scale. And I'm not talking about board apes here specifically. I'm talking about the entire NFT space, the ethereum ecosystem. If you were buying a house for say, $250,000 and the transaction fee was 150 grand, that's probably something that doesn't look terribly economically interesting to most people. And these are issues that ultimately have to get sorted out. We talked a little bit about Salana, seven hour outage, Salana being touted as one of the L ones, as a potential ethereum, I don't want to say replacement, but an alternative to Ethereum for doing some of these transactions. And yet we see that ecosystem going out for 7 hours, right?
00:22:25.950 - 00:22:32.714, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. The cost of transacting on Ethereum isn't that bad. On a good day, I can spend.
00:22:32.752 - 00:22:35.566, Speaker B: Like a buck 50. It depends what you're doing, though.
00:22:35.588 - 00:22:38.398, Speaker A: I mean, the problem with this is that anyone who was trying to do.
00:22:38.484 - 00:22:41.200, Speaker B: Anything else on Ethereum at the time.
00:22:41.970 - 00:22:47.522, Speaker A: And people were going on to opensea and trying to buy these NFTs on the secondary market and having to still.
00:22:47.576 - 00:22:49.922, Speaker B: Spend two ETH on top of the.
00:22:49.976 - 00:23:08.114, Speaker A: Price, which was all over the place anyway. But imagine you had a position on a lending protocol, there was a risk of liquidation, and you were trying to top it up, and you were suddenly, in that kind of scenario, what do you do? There's more to Ethereum than just nfts, and it obviously can't handle that kind of load.
00:23:08.242 - 00:23:08.582, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:08.636 - 00:23:50.578, Speaker C: But in some senses, that's an even more damning statement. There's more to Ethereum than NFTs because it suggests that when you do have these peak moments, I'm looking at a chart here and I see the May 1 peak around $474 for gas fees on ethereum. And it's like the old joke about liquidity, Robin, which is there's always a ton of liquidity, except for the moment you need it. And so if transaction fees remain relatively stable, except for the moment when there's a significant mint and everyone attempts to dive into it, that's something. That's a challenge. I'm not saying that it's an insurmountable challenge. It's just something that obviously is going to need to get sorted out before we're able to do these things at scale.
00:23:50.578 - 00:24:24.130, Speaker C: If you think about this ecosystem, for you and for me, and for people who follow the space and who are super into this, this is a huge story. But if you ask folks on the street, some of our friends, hey, what did you think about the landmint? They'll look at you like you have three heads. Right? And so what that means is it's a subset of the subset in terms of the people who are using this now, and yet you still have these massive spikes in terms of gas fees when there is demand. So that's obviously something that's going to need to get sorted out and it's something that's going to need to get solved.
00:24:25.270 - 00:24:30.206, Speaker B: Yes. And yet Elon has changed his Twitter.
00:24:30.238 - 00:24:35.326, Speaker A: Profile picture to an ape. He's literally done their marketing for them. This is one of the most followed.
00:24:35.358 - 00:24:36.566, Speaker B: People in the world.
00:24:36.748 - 00:24:39.762, Speaker C: Yeah, 90 million Twitter followers or thereabouts.
00:24:39.906 - 00:24:41.458, Speaker A: And he's just doing all their marketing.
00:24:41.474 - 00:24:43.240, Speaker B: For them so they'll know.
00:24:45.930 - 00:24:59.194, Speaker A: You're absolutely right. I mean, there are so many layers to this. Salana is an interesting one. We should definitely jump onto that story because Salana went dark for 7 hours. And that for a blockchain, is, I mean, it's like being a broadcasting network and they're just being dead air.
00:24:59.392 - 00:25:01.658, Speaker B: You just don't do it.
00:25:01.744 - 00:25:30.646, Speaker A: There is so much financial activity on these major blockchains that it's just the cardinal sin. And this has happened before with Solana. They went dark because a bot started spamming the network. And Solana is architected in a slightly unusual way, and that's designed to make it go fast. It doesn't have a mem pool, so most transactions you submit to the blockchain, they go into a mempool, and then miners look at those transactions, say, what's the best one for me? And then they get audited according to which one's the most profitable, and then.
00:25:30.668 - 00:25:34.758, Speaker B: They get processed over time until they're all cleared out.
00:25:34.764 - 00:25:39.458, Speaker A: And then more ones join the mempool. Solana doesn't have that. They have leaders and validators.
00:25:39.554 - 00:25:41.786, Speaker B: And it's actually a very neat and.
00:25:41.808 - 00:25:52.538, Speaker A: Efficient system designed for massive speed. Solana are not shy about touting themselves as being the Ferrari of blockchains, being able to process tens of thousands, up to, nay, a million transactions per second.
00:25:52.704 - 00:25:57.406, Speaker B: But that makes them a subject for attack. And as you said earlier, blockchain is.
00:25:57.428 - 00:26:11.714, Speaker A: A very adversarial environment. And for those who want to dig further, you can look into Mev and sandwich attacks and what goes on when bots spot your transaction early and then front run you and squeeze out more value from you than you're prepared to give them, or you're expecting to give.
00:26:11.752 - 00:26:17.426, Speaker B: Them this is going on all the time. And I remember being at harmony, which.
00:26:17.448 - 00:26:29.318, Speaker A: Is another high speed layer, one blockchain. When we were under attack and someone took down a shard, they deliberately took it down, and you have to scramble to get it up, and the community hates you, and they think something's wrong. And then you're really sort of determined.
00:26:29.334 - 00:26:31.398, Speaker B: By how you act in a crisis.
00:26:31.574 - 00:26:39.450, Speaker A: This was, again, an NFT minting thing. So you were talking about SDKs before. This was actually the ClI of a.
00:26:39.600 - 00:26:48.574, Speaker B: NFT minting tool that a bot started attacking and spamming, and it just completely swamped the network. NFTs again, over and over and over.
00:26:48.612 - 00:26:59.540, Speaker A: It'S the same story. So Solana just couldn't handle the load. And Solana is supposed to be the one that can handle the, you know, victim of success and teething problems, whatever you want to call.
00:27:00.150 - 00:27:05.310, Speaker B: We, as you say, we are ridiculously early. That's the truth.
00:27:05.390 - 00:27:35.002, Speaker C: Yeah, Robin. So let me talk a little bit more generally to this. The challenge that we see here is that we're seeing this amazing opportunity, this massive shift in the way that venture capital gets done. Historically, we have this Sandhill road model, this very sort of structured way of thinking about investment in early stage technology. Angel rounds, seed rounds, a rounds, b rounds. Like this idea of this very sort of structured system. And this distinction here is liquidity.
00:27:35.002 - 00:28:10.534, Speaker C: So liquidity was not immediately available. If you were an investor in Google, if you were an investor in Amazon and Dropbox and Netflix, you didn't really have an active secondary market to get liquidity. In other words, you couldn't take money out once you'd put it in. So the system that we live in right now is one where there's this radical liquidity from the moment that a token gets issued. So the upside here is that there's liquidity, and the downside here is that there's liquidity. So you may purchase something. You think it's something that is something you're passionate about for whatever reason.
00:28:10.534 - 00:28:54.242, Speaker C: You think the technology is great, you think the end use is great, you think the application is great, you think the art is great, for example. But the reality is you're effectively seeing this enormous degree of transactions, this enormous degree of trading in something that is extremely, extremely early. Beta Alpha, maybe pre alpha in some cases, in the Silicon Valley jargon, for the degree of maturity of the technology. And this is the challenge and the opportunity. And this is where we find ourselves having these conversations about technologies that effectively would never be publicly traded companies because it's just too early. But again, that's the promise, that's the opportunity. But it's also the risk and it's also the downside.
00:28:54.242 - 00:28:54.994, Speaker C: Robin?
00:28:55.122 - 00:28:58.358, Speaker B: Well, you and I, as youthful as.
00:28:58.364 - 00:29:11.246, Speaker A: We appear on camera, probably old enough to remember the.com boom, 98, 99 through thousand, where you had pets.com in the UK, we had lastminute.com. I went back and looked at some.
00:29:11.268 - 00:29:15.306, Speaker B: Of the valuations, my mind completely blown.
00:29:15.418 - 00:29:19.440, Speaker A: Like these multibillion dollar valuations for these companies.
00:29:20.610 - 00:29:24.206, Speaker B: It just felt so familiar to the.
00:29:24.228 - 00:29:28.820, Speaker A: Experience I'm going through now, where we really feel this is life changing tech.
00:29:29.190 - 00:29:34.530, Speaker B: But probably, as you rightly say, like 20 years from now, it'll all be so obvious.
00:29:34.680 - 00:29:36.110, Speaker A: But right now, in the noise of.
00:29:36.120 - 00:29:40.662, Speaker B: It and the mess of it, I have no idea. I have no idea.
00:29:40.716 - 00:29:41.938, Speaker A: I mean, it's fascinating.
00:29:42.034 - 00:29:49.154, Speaker B: And it's fascinating seeing a project like Ugalabs and other side dominating the conversation.
00:29:49.282 - 00:29:51.226, Speaker A: Knowing full well there's every chance that.
00:29:51.248 - 00:29:54.394, Speaker B: This becomes the footnote, the caveat to.
00:29:54.432 - 00:30:01.978, Speaker A: What actually happens later on. But it just feels so kind of dominating and overwhelming right now. But as we know, it can completely evaporate.
00:30:02.074 - 00:30:05.086, Speaker B: Netscape and Mark Andreessen, they went through.
00:30:05.108 - 00:30:10.874, Speaker A: All of that and then antitrust with Internet Explorer. These are legendary stories of a period.
00:30:10.922 - 00:30:12.574, Speaker B: Where the Internet was being built.
00:30:12.692 - 00:30:14.766, Speaker A: And this is exactly where we are right now.
00:30:14.788 - 00:30:16.302, Speaker B: We are the chroniclers of that, Ash.
00:30:16.366 - 00:30:17.538, Speaker A: We are the ones that are going.
00:30:17.544 - 00:30:22.466, Speaker B: To look back historically and say, ash Bennington, he knew. He knew.
00:30:22.648 - 00:30:25.986, Speaker A: I don't know what he knew, but he knew something. I don't know about that.
00:30:26.008 - 00:30:52.826, Speaker C: But there's the old joke that journalism is a first draft of history, and sometimes it's an incredibly rough first draft. But to follow up on your metaphor with 1999, the.com boom, the.com bust, I think that's spot on. As the old saying goes, history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. In those days, late 90s, early two thousand s, I was working at Credit Suisse down in midtown Manhattan at Credit Suisse private banking. I remember the moment that Nasdaq collapsed.
00:30:52.826 - 00:31:17.186, Speaker C: I believe it was in April of 2000. It was precipitated by a judge ruling that Microsoft was going to get broken up. Ultimately, Microsoft didn't get broken up because of some prejudicial comments the judge had made out of court. The decision ultimately got reversed on appeal. But Microsoft was about to get broken up, and that's what precipitated that crash. Now here's the interesting thing. To precisely your point, Robin.
00:31:17.186 - 00:31:51.982, Speaker C: The world has obviously changed in the last 22 years, and the Internet has powered those changes. So ultimately, the revolution, in fact, did play out. People who were early, people who were innovative, people who had the foresight to see the technology, the direction it was going. People like Bill Gates and Larry Ellison over at Oracle made enormous, enormous fortunes. But here's the thing. Here's the flip side of that coin. Two points.
00:31:51.982 - 00:32:24.390, Speaker C: Number one, very often those stocks were underwater for long periods of time. Amazon, if you bought Amazon at the peak in whatever it was, late 99, early 2000, you were underwater for years. Cisco Systems is another example of a stock that was underwater for many years. It takes time, and you can lose money. And you can lose money not just on paper, but you can lose money in reality. If you come into that in a realized way, if you come into that and you get spooked and you sell out. The other important point is survivorship bias.
00:32:24.390 - 00:32:47.454, Speaker C: When we look back and we say, yes, well, but look at what Amazon did over the last 20 years. Look at what Microsoft did over the last 20 years. Look at oracle. The reality is there were companies that didn't survive. So you're cherry picking the data at the end to only look at the winners. Survivorship bias is always one of the sort of canonical traps that investors can fall into. So where do we land? Right? That's the challenge.
00:32:47.454 - 00:33:37.230, Speaker C: We know the forces that are driving innovation, that are creating these new technologies that are able to drive enormous efficiency, that are just able to create growth, that's able to increase GDP. And on the other, we know that there is survivorship bias. We know that there are bombs out there. We know that there are landmines that haven't yet been overturned. And we know additionally that there's this issue of cherry picking data and survivorship bias. And now add to all that, all the additional uncertainty we have in these decentralized ecosystems, these massive hacks that can drain a treasury in a matter of minutes. Misrepresentations that we talked about, again with yuga Labs, where web, two platforms like Instagram get hacked and misdirect people who lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in a matter of seconds.
00:33:37.230 - 00:34:12.220, Speaker C: These are these forces that are colliding. We can see the future. We can see, I think at least, and maybe I'm wrong, maybe we're all wrong, but there really seems to be a huge amount of potential value to unlock in these decentralized ecosystems. And yet, at the same time, we have all the old problems that we just talked about in the.com bubble era, and simultaneously, we have entirely new categories of problems. How does this sort itself out? How do these things balance in the end? Who are the winners? Who are the losers? That's what these conversations are all about. Trying to figure that out.
00:34:12.750 - 00:34:22.078, Speaker A: Yeah, you're absolutely right. The tendency to kind of say, if only I'd seen board apes. Well, the thing is, if you'd seen board apes when they were selling for.
00:34:22.084 - 00:34:26.050, Speaker B: 0.8 e, you probably would have passed because you wouldn't know.
00:34:26.120 - 00:34:27.780, Speaker A: And how could you possibly know?
00:34:28.230 - 00:34:29.874, Speaker B: The best strategy, it's the one that.
00:34:29.912 - 00:34:32.354, Speaker A: The VCs I've spoken to use is.
00:34:32.552 - 00:34:35.358, Speaker B: They spread, they spread, they hedge.
00:34:35.534 - 00:34:38.722, Speaker A: They have a bunch of turkeys, but the ones that hit, they hit so.
00:34:38.776 - 00:34:40.422, Speaker B: Big, the turkeys don't matter.
00:34:40.476 - 00:34:44.246, Speaker A: And that is a very privileged position to be in. I was talking to another VC friend.
00:34:44.268 - 00:34:49.926, Speaker B: Of mine that said, the big ones, yeah, they do great, but actually the.
00:34:49.948 - 00:34:54.746, Speaker A: Medium level ones, the ones that haven't gone so big, are still doing great for them.
00:34:54.848 - 00:34:59.242, Speaker B: Like strong VCs that know what they're doing are making a killing right now.
00:34:59.296 - 00:35:06.670, Speaker A: And we'll probably continue to make a killing as this continues to grow, because I feel still a lot of narrative to play out before we really understand.
00:35:06.740 - 00:35:09.294, Speaker B: What'S going on here. I don't know how you feel.
00:35:09.492 - 00:36:04.874, Speaker C: No, I think that's exactly right. And it's also interesting to me, if you look at the history of Wall street, of the securities industry in the modern sense, you could say it runs about 75 years, from the securities act of 1933 until 2008. Obviously, the system is still in place, but it's experiencing, obviously some flux as we talk about with all these macroeconomic challenges. So that system lasted for about 75 years. The modern venture capitalist paradigm, the Kleiner Perkins of the world, the people who were really early to this, those shops were founded in the 1970s, but they really didn't, to use another term that's common on Sandhill Road, they really didn't eat the world until the late 90s, early 2000s. So that system has been in place now. The Sand Hill model that we were talking about with multiple rounds and how venture capital works, that's been in place only now for about 25 years, a relatively new system.
00:36:04.874 - 00:37:10.440, Speaker C: And now when I talk to these young guys and gals in their 20s who are doing work in the VC space in the tokenized world, they refer derisively, dismissively to the Sandhill road model. Those are the old guys and gals, right? That's not the future. That's the past. And so it's really interesting to see how these sort of venture capital, private equity models are being just absolutely disrupted by the decentralized world, by the tokenomics that we're talking about now. And obviously, people who are smart about technology and who understand the risks and opportunities and are able to invest and invest early are going to make a ton of money. But the flip side, precisely as you pointed out, are the risks for those who are early and maybe don't know or don't understand, haven't seen these cycles, haven't had the opportunities to understand what's happened in the past and how that history applies to the present and indeed to the future. And the reality is they can and will lose money.
00:37:11.530 - 00:37:26.906, Speaker A: Yes. Well, Gary Gensler agrees with you, and he means business. And he has just announced the newly formed crypto assets and cyber unit, and they're increasing the positions there from 30 to 50. They're doubling up and focusing basically on.
00:37:26.928 - 00:37:29.274, Speaker B: Enforcing securities law in pretty much all.
00:37:29.312 - 00:37:37.118, Speaker A: Aspects of crypto lending, nfts custody, pretty much anything that he can sink his teeth into, he's going to. I mean, 50 seems like it's still.
00:37:37.204 - 00:37:41.626, Speaker B: Underpowered for the scope here, but it's.
00:37:41.658 - 00:37:43.794, Speaker A: Pretty clear what they want to do.
00:37:43.832 - 00:37:46.900, Speaker B: Here, is it not? Yeah, absolutely.
00:37:47.350 - 00:38:12.474, Speaker C: This release crossed the wire just yesterday, and obviously it's a big story, growing this enforcement division to 50 dedicated positions. These are people who are going to be working full time to do this. Look, I think the challenge here isn't so much on the enforcement side. I think people will tell you we've talked about them. There are challenges out there. We know that there are scams. Right.
00:38:12.474 - 00:38:34.814, Speaker C: We know that there are fraudulent securities or de facto securities that are being offered in the space. There are bad actors in crypto. Surprise, surprise. Right. But the challenge here is that effectively what SEC here is doing is they're stepping up enforcement. These are folks who've stepped over the line. SEC reaches out and confronts them.
00:38:34.814 - 00:39:21.134, Speaker C: Right. SEC doesn't criminally prosecute. This is on the civil side, but they can refer to Department of Justice if they believe that there have been violation of criminal laws. So when someone steps across the line, SEC is there with an enforcement action. The challenge is folks in the space who are good actors, who are actually going out there trying to build things, trying to add value, trying to figure out where the puck is going and to build the systems that are going to execute, implement, and be the new standard bearers of that space. They don't have any guidance right now about where those lines are. So the challenge is that you have enforcement actions when people step across the line, but very little guidance about where those lines are.
00:39:21.134 - 00:40:00.554, Speaker C: This is a theme that I hear constantly from people who are building in the space. They're like, regulate us, give us some way of knowing where those lines are, of knowing how we can act in a way that's compliant with the guidance so that we don't wind up crossing that line. And that's a challenge. And it takes time to build up those precedents. It takes time to build up case law. It takes time to build up rules and regulations for how that takes place. And so this is the challenge that good actors in the crypto space find themselves in now, trying to understand where those lines are, where those barriers are, and trying to build accordingly.
00:40:00.554 - 00:40:01.418, Speaker C: Robin.
00:40:01.594 - 00:40:05.598, Speaker A: Well, absolutely. Well, here's hoping that we look back in 20 years time and see that.
00:40:05.604 - 00:40:08.094, Speaker B: We were indeed the rough draft of.
00:40:08.132 - 00:40:13.806, Speaker A: History, and we know where our lines are. So thanks, Ash, for joining me on this weekly. This is a great conversation, and I.
00:40:13.828 - 00:40:15.820, Speaker B: Will see you all next week for more of the same.
