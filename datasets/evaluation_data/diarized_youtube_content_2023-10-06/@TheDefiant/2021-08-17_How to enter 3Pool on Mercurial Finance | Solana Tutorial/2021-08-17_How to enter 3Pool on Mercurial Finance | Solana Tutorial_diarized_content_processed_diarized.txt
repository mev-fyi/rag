00:00:00.170 - 00:00:02.894, Speaker A: Tuesday tutorial time, and it's going to be a bit of a different one today.
00:00:02.932 - 00:00:03.866, Speaker B: We're going to be looking at adding.
00:00:03.898 - 00:00:07.482, Speaker A: Liquidity to the mercurial protocol stable pools.
00:00:07.546 - 00:00:08.730, Speaker B: And where is this puppy?
00:00:08.810 - 00:00:10.782, Speaker A: Well, it's not on Ethereum, it's on.
00:00:10.916 - 00:00:13.614, Speaker B: Solana, which is continuing our efforts to.
00:00:13.652 - 00:00:29.586, Speaker A: Explore alt Defi and go foraging on other chains for interesting ideas. And we'll start our journey with Sol tokens, set up a phantom wallet, swap them on serum, and then deposit into the mercurial vaults. So what is mercurial? Well, it's basically a liquidity platform for stable assets on Solana.
00:00:29.618 - 00:00:30.706, Speaker B: And if you're looking for an analog.
00:00:30.738 - 00:00:46.486, Speaker A: On Ethereum, that's probably something like curve. Slightly simplistic. But as we've covered in the past, amms are kind of a little bit clumsy when it comes to large size trades. And curve's party tricks has been to facilitate these big trades with very low swippage.
00:00:46.678 - 00:00:48.182, Speaker B: Swippage slippage.
00:00:48.246 - 00:01:25.346, Speaker A: And curve's party trick has been to facilitate big trades with very low slippage between stable pairs. Mercurial does the same thing. Their big selling point is their dynamic vaults, which are market making buckets which allow for these low slippage swaps, but also create much better profit opportunities with dynamic fees and flexible capital allocation. So if we check the pools, you can see we have three pools. They're actually called three pools, which are made of three distinct stable assets. Now, there is a huge amount of detail on these and how they're made up and the algorithms that define the relationship between the assets. That's all in the documentation.
00:01:25.346 - 00:01:51.818, Speaker A: I'll link that below, but it's really not for today. Now, as of recording, there's nearly $57 million deposited in those pools, with the UST pool going for around 22.34% APR, which compares favorably, I guess, with the 19.47% currently available on anchor. So if you're a UST fan and you're doing your business on Terra, you could get a slightly more favorable rate on mercurial.
00:01:51.914 - 00:01:52.880, Speaker B: There you go.
00:01:55.090 - 00:01:56.490, Speaker A: Okay, so here we are then on.
00:01:56.500 - 00:02:08.514, Speaker B: The Mercurial finance page. And there's going to be a few different steps that we are going to have to do to get ourselves into a position to deposit funds on mercurial. So up here, we're going to look at connect wallet.
00:02:08.562 - 00:02:10.214, Speaker A: Now, the options you have to connect.
00:02:10.252 - 00:02:49.380, Speaker B: The wallet are Phantom, solid soulflare, math wallet, and ledger. The one we're interested in is Phantom, because as Raj Gokal claims, Phantom is the best wallet experience in the world ever. So let's see if he's right. So Phantom is a friendly software wallet that you'll love. So let's add it to chrome and see if they're right. Can they add the extension? It has been added and as I always do, I go and pin the extension. Where have you gone? There we go.
00:02:49.380 - 00:03:07.638, Speaker B: So now I'm going to go ahead and create a new wallet and write down the seed phrase. Okay, that's done. Yes, I've saved it somewhere. Create a password, agree to the terms of service. Oh, look at that. Alt shift p to bring up Phantom. We're all done.
00:03:07.638 - 00:03:27.840, Speaker B: Finish. So now we have a wallet. If I click on the extension, I have nothing in here. So I'm going to need to deposit some soul. I do not have currently any soul, but I do have Ethereum. So as we did in the last tutorial, we're going to use chain jelly to do this. So we need to get the wallet address.
00:03:27.840 - 00:04:05.980, Speaker B: And now we're going to use changelly to send some ethereum to my sole address. So what I want to do is send point. I'm not going to send too much zero five ETH, which will give me approximately if I type in solana tokens. So give me 3.88 salana tokens, click on exchange. Now paste in my sole recipient address, which I got from here. I can copy this here, paste that in here, and then go to the next step, confirm and make payment.
00:04:05.980 - 00:04:44.354, Speaker B: And now I need to send zero one to this address here using my metamask. Zero five ETH. Confirm. And we will wait for that to finalize a few minutes later. Okay, so we are in business now, checking my wallets, and I do have $110 worth of Sol tokens in my wallet. So now what we need to do is a couple of different things, because what we need to do is we want to get the sol that's now in my wallet, switch it to USDC, and then switch that to UST. But in order to do that, we have to use two different dexes.
00:04:44.354 - 00:05:26.034, Speaker B: So the first Dex we're going to use is radium. And here's radium swap. So I'm going to connect my wallet, that's the phantom wallet and going to connect. So the first thing I need to do is create a USDC account, which I'm going to do now. It's very simple to do approve, and transactions usually happen pretty fast on salana, so that's done. What I'm going to do now is swap to Sol for USTC. So that gives me $56 of USDC.
00:05:26.034 - 00:05:53.326, Speaker B: Click on swap, approve the transaction, and we're done. So now I need to go to a different exchange. I need to go to saber. So this is sabre here. Just going to refresh the page, connect my wallet phantom. And now I want to switch from USDC. See, it's reading my USDC balance, and I want to change it.
00:05:53.326 - 00:06:35.200, Speaker B: For now, we need to just go back to the mercurial app here. The one we want is actually wst wrapped ust. So on saber, I'm going to, from the drop down menu, select wrapped UST I'm going to do the max review, that all looks good, and confirm the swap, approve it, and I believe we are done. So now I can go to the mercurial finance protocol. I'm just going to refresh the page again. Sometimes on Solana, you just need to refresh the page before you connect. So I allow the site to connect.
00:06:35.200 - 00:07:09.702, Speaker B: So now we have WST. What we can do is go ahead and deposit some WST to this pool. So this is the Ust three pool, APR of 22.37%. I'm going to deposit there, and then we can select the WST. I don't have to deposit USDC or USdt. I can simply deposit this and that will then give me an LP token, which is USDC, USDT, UST. I can deposit that, confirm and deposit and approve it.
00:07:09.702 - 00:07:28.638, Speaker B: And like with every other transaction here on Salana, it's very fast. And there we go. So I now have $56.76 deposited in the pool. No, I know it's not very much, and if we're properly aping, we would do a lot more than that. But it's just to give you an idea of how quick and fast and cheap it is. Now, there are other ways to get your funds over here.
00:07:28.638 - 00:08:03.174, Speaker B: Now, normally, what we would use is the Solano wormhole bridge. And here we could take wrapped ETH or wi fi, all sorts of different things, and send them over the bridge. And I believe that you could send them over and exchange them directly for the LP tokens. Let's just check, see if that's possible. Yes. So down here, there's a USDT, USDT mercurial lp token. So you could exchange directly for those tokens and jump straight into the pool that way.
00:08:03.174 - 00:08:05.866, Speaker B: That might be a quicker and more easy way to do it, but I.
00:08:05.888 - 00:08:06.842, Speaker A: Thought I would do it this way.
00:08:06.896 - 00:08:35.902, Speaker B: Chaining two different Dexs together. To show you how kind of fast and cheap it is on Solana, and also get an idea of the phantom wallet. So that's mercurial. It's an alternative to curve. It's paying out at slightly better rate than anchor at the moment. And I believe when we were scooting through the discord that their benchmark APR that they're targeting is around 20%. So similar to the similar to the anchor rewards.
00:08:35.902 - 00:08:54.474, Speaker B: So that's how we use mercurial finance. It's early days for the Salona DFI ecosystem, but it's building out rapidly and just reminds me, using this, how fast and cheap it actually is, I have to keep pushing myself to use these alternative layer ones and see what they're up to. But yeah, worked pretty well, so I.
00:08:54.512 - 00:09:17.138, Speaker A: Hope that was a helpful tutorial. And as we've said many times before, alt layer ones are going to have to work pretty hard to incentivize capital to move away from Ethereum. But as yields decline there, they might well be tempted to cross the bridges into faraway lands. But of course, when you travel far away, make sure you're safe, really safe. Get vaccinated, all that stuff. I'll see you on the next one.
00:09:17.224 - 00:09:20.080, Speaker B: Peace. Close.
