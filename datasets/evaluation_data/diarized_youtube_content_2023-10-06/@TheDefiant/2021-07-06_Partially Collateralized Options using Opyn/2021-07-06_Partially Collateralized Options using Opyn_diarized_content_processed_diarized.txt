00:00:00.490 - 00:00:23.486, Speaker A: Good morning. It's Tuesday, which means it's time for a tutorial. And this week we're going to do the one we couldn't do last week, which is open. What is open? Well, it's an options protocol built on Ethereum, and they've done something pretty cool. They've allowed people who mint options the opportunity to do so. Not fully collateralized, but partially collateralized. What does that all mean? Well, stay with me and we'll dig in.
00:00:23.486 - 00:00:53.270, Speaker A: But first, a message from our spawn. So, and it's a new sponsor this week. It is Nansen.

00:00:53.270 - 00:01:40.300, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm not going to lie here. I tried to do this tutorial last week, not once, but twice, and I got my ass thoroughly kicked by options, puts and calls and this kind of thing. And that is for no other reason than it's not something I've ever done before. I don't come from a finance or trading background, I just haven't really done that before. And so the kind of basic core concepts of options, well, it's a little bit kind of out of my normal wheelhouse, but did my homework, dug in, tried to understand what was going on here and why you would use it and what's actually on offer here. And now I think I understand it. Shout out to wade at open, who was very helpful in guiding me through what exactly is going on here.
00:01:40.300 - 00:02:25.546, Speaker A: But here we go. Open is basically it's an options platform that allows you to sell, buy and mint options, and there's all sorts of different kind of sliders and terms that you need to understand, like the delta, Theta, the gamma, the Vega, the rho of all of this. And I still don't really understand any of that stuff. And it doesn't really matter, to be honest with you. There's an awful lot of funky stuff going on. Open is not new, but this is open version two we're looking at, and open version two is doing something cool, and they are allowing you to do partially collateralized options. So previously, what happened if you wanted to mint a put or a call on open, you would have to fully collateralize it.
00:02:25.546 - 00:03:03.718, Speaker A: So let's say, for instance, you had a call option collateralized with ETH, you'd have to fully collateralize it. So if the option was realized and you hit the strike price, then you would lose the ETH. Similarly, with a call option, if you were collateralized in USDC and you had to fully collateralize it, you would lose all the USDC if the strike price was hit. Now, you don't have to do that. And they've actually handily put together a deck that allows, I mean, this is a pretty good deck. It's seven slides and it's very, very straightforward. But what we're looking at here specifically is minting options.
00:03:03.718 - 00:03:47.606, Speaker A: Minting puts and calls, not buying them or trading them, just minting them. And the reason you mint them is because there's a premium on options, which you can then realize as a trader. So it's a way of betting on the market to realize a premium. Now, the premiums are not massive, but if you have a pretty big sample size, a pretty big stack to play with, then they can add up. And what's interesting is in tradfi, this partially collateralized options, basically you're trading on margin that's been around for donkeys years. And it's a very capital efficient way of trading the markets. We haven't had that before in Defi, but now we do.
00:03:47.606 - 00:04:06.586, Speaker A: So what this does. Yeah, the way they do it is quite complicated. There is a medium post that goes into exactly what's going on. I don't understand it. It's fine. I don't need to understand it. There's a whole bunch of stuff going on here.
00:04:06.586 - 00:04:34.386, Speaker A: This medium post is very long. I will put a link to it in the description. We're not going to go there now. So why this is good is with partial collateralization, you'll be able to sell more options, you'll be able to sell more puts and sell more calls than if you were fully collateralized. It just means there's more profit to be made with less upfront capital. And this means. Here we go.
00:04:34.386 - 00:05:21.282, Speaker A: This big win slide explains it perfectly. It means the APIs go up for people who are actually selling options. It means that smaller users can actually kind of operate in this market in a way that was simply impossible before. And there's also the degree to which if you have a longer option at stake, so let's say it's a six month option, locking up all of that capital for that amount of time. That's quite a lot of capital inefficiency and it also means that it's more attractive for market makers, and market makers make the market, which creates liquidity, and that's a good thing. So there's a little cheat sheet on Twitter, which I needed, and I still need it. So it's really simple.
00:05:21.282 - 00:05:57.998, Speaker A: You sell a call if you expect the price of ETH to be below the strike price at expiration, and you sell a put if you expect the price of ETH to be above the strike price at expiration. And that's basically it. So we'll just dig into exactly how that works in a second on the open dashboard. But I would highly recommend just going through the deck because it's very clear. There's another tutorial from Wade himself where he explains all of this and goes through that deck, which was super helpful. But for now, for this tutorial, we're just going to get straight into it. I hope that bumbling explanation of puts and calls was better than it sounded because it felt like I'm stumbling through it.
00:05:57.998 - 00:06:35.082, Speaker A: But I am still figuring this stuff out on the fly. It's more to do with how you would use it, what you're actually doing here. But as I understand it, basically when you sell the put or a call, you are saying, I'm making a bet on the market that I'm hoping that someone else will pick up and take on because they think I've got that bet wrong. And so that's what's going on here. So if we look at the trading side of the dashboard, we have a weath USDC and a WBTC USDC. The partial collateralization is only available on the weath pair at the moment. Next year we have the expiry date.
00:06:35.082 - 00:07:16.210, Speaker A: So this is when the options expire and they will be settled. And then we have on the right hand side, we'll see all the options that we have. Now, I don't have any USDC in my account right now, but if I did, then I'll be able to sell puts. But actually what we're going to look at now is selling calls. So we're on the Friday 9 July 2021 call side of the market. If we were to look at the 30 July, you'd see all of these things change. So we can also do the Friday the 31 December.
00:07:16.210 - 00:07:37.786, Speaker A: There are no calls there. There are some puts, but nothing there yet. And this one goes even as far as the 27 May. Wow. But the one we're going to look at is the 9 July. So this blue box here, this indicates the premium. This is the premium that you will earn for selling these options, which is where you make your profit.
00:07:37.786 - 00:08:10.546, Speaker A: And so what we can do now is we can look at the strike price. So this is the price. If the price of ETH remains below that strike price, then I make the money. As you can see, there's no real options here for that. But if I were to say, okay, I think the price of ETH is going to stay below 2400 by the 9 July. Gosh, that is quite soon, and we're actually quite close. Let's just see where we are at with Ethereum.
00:08:10.546 - 00:08:34.782, Speaker A: So the price of Ethereum is 2317. This would be a terrible trade to take, let's be honest. So we're making a bet that the price of ETH is going to stay below 2400. I think that's pretty risky, to be honest. Let's say we said the price of ETH is going to stay below 2600 in two days. That seems like a fair bet. Let's have a look at the 30 July options.
00:08:34.782 - 00:09:04.490, Speaker A: That might be a better place to look. Yeah. See that? By the end of July, do I think that the price of ETH is going to stay below 3200? Yeah, potentially. So I got a premium of $19.49. So we click on that and then it opens up this little tab here. So what we now have is position size in o tokens, and the o tokens are the tokens that represent your option in the market. So we're going to sell those.
00:09:04.490 - 00:09:51.398, Speaker A: We have to set a position size. And then once we set a position size, that will start to ripple through the rest of this little dashboard here and tell us what's going on. So at the moment, let's say we want to do 1.5. So our position size is fully collateralized at the moment. So if we scroll down to the bottom to buy, sorry, to sell this position, we would need one and a half ETH. So it's a one and a half. One and a half o tokens will cost one and a half ETH, and we will receive $16 in premiums, which doesn't sound like very much, but of course, the idea is to scale this up and then it can become quite significant.
00:09:51.398 - 00:10:29.320, Speaker A: But at the moment, we're looking at not the most attractive options here, but it's just to give you an example. So what we can do now is look at this partial collateralization slider. And so we'll have a profound effect on everything that's going on down here. So what we want to do is we want to get this collateral required number to as close to one ETH as possible. And there is a reason for that. The minimum collateral amount required is one ETH at the moment, and I want to create the most efficient position possible. So we start sliding this, and you'll start to see the collateralization ratio changes, the spot change changes as well.
00:10:29.320 - 00:10:58.622, Speaker A: And there we go. So you can see if I can start bringing the liquidation price down and the amount of change down. And you see down here, the collateral required is getting close to one e. We're pretty close there now. So we look at the collateralization ratio. This is how much collateral we have compared to the position. That's 66%.
00:10:58.622 - 00:11:40.934, Speaker A: Then the spot change is the amount the price would have to change in order to be liquidated. And then the underlying price at which the vault will be liquidated is 3576. Do we think ETH is going to go to 3576 by the end of the month? Well, stranger things have happened. I don't think it would be impossible. When the market starts to move heavily, then these things could happen. And we do have, of course, this EIP 1559 narrative in the market, which could result in a big move. So I don't know how confident I would feel about holding this kind of position.
00:11:40.934 - 00:12:35.054, Speaker A: So I might want to just maneuver that slider to somewhere else. But let's say, for instance, we're just going to go ahead and take that risk for now, because we will be able to do something with it later on in the dashboard, and we'll take a look at that. So what I'm going to do now is issue that o token. So I'm going to mint the o token, and that will open up metamask, and then I'll catch you after this transaction is confirmed. So that has now confirmed. There was one other step which we didn't cover, but it's hopefully in the screen recording where we had to approve the o token. But now we have a position, we can go and look at the dashboard, at our position and see what's going on here.
00:12:35.054 - 00:13:03.622, Speaker A: So it'll give us the current asset prices. ETH is at $2,289. It still feels weird to see that it genuinely does. So this is an untraded call. It's one and a half e and the collateral here. And then we can see the safety of our vault. So we can click on that and it will give us basically the health and the status of the position.
00:13:03.622 - 00:13:32.814, Speaker A: So a liquidation price of 3710. In order for that to be liquidated, the price has to change 64%. So now that we have this, we can do a couple of different things. We could adjust the collateral. So let's say I was starting to get a little bit nervous about this position. I wanted to add collateral, then I could, but I could also remove collateral. If I'm feeling quite good about this and I want to free up capital for another position, I can also do that.
00:13:32.814 - 00:14:03.770, Speaker A: And that's the place where we would do that. We can also market sell the token. We can close the position. This will burn the o token and redeem our collateral, or we can manage them, but I don't think that's what we need to get into at the moment. But those are basically the ones that we're going to be looking at. So that's it basically. So what I'll probably do now is I'll probably close this position and extract my collateral.
00:14:03.770 - 00:14:36.230, Speaker A: So this is a two step process. So first thing I need to do is just check how many tokens I want to redeem, burn, and redeem. So I'll click on max, and then I need to burn them, and then I can withdraw it. It's worth bearing in mind that we stuck ETH in as collateral, but what we'll be getting back out is weath, and that's because we is wrapped ETH. It's an ERC 20 token. ETH itself is not. And ERc 20 tokens can do things that ETH itself, it's harder for ETH to do.
00:14:36.230 - 00:15:20.232, Speaker A: So that's what's going on here. And there we go. We have no active positions. And now I should have in metamask some weath that's come back. Where are you? Where are you? So once I burned and withdraw my weath, I then went into metabask and actually didn't show up in my assets tab. So I was kind of curious what had been going on here, because I could see the position, which is the option here. And of course, you can add a token if I add wrapped ETH.
00:15:20.232 - 00:15:56.776, Speaker A: Didn't want to have it. Just didn't want to have it. That's probably a good reason for that. It just didn't want to have it. So what I did next was I went and looked on ether scan, then looked at my ERC 20 token transactions, and I could see quite clearly that the wrapped ETH, and I could see quite clearly the wrapped ETH had, in fact, arrived in my account. So the burn and withdrawal process worked perfectly, and everything was good. It just was a bit of a strange situation there but all good in the end.
00:15:56.776 - 00:16:22.560, Speaker A: So there you go. That's how we use open for partially collateralized options. I'm certainly looking forward to digging into this further and trying to understand how and why you might use it, but it's definitely giving you more capital efficiency, giving you more ways of betting on the market, and expanding the suite of defi tools at our disposal. Thanks to Wade for helping me through this, and if you have a suggestion for a tutorial, drop it in the comments below. I'll see you on the next one. Cheese.
