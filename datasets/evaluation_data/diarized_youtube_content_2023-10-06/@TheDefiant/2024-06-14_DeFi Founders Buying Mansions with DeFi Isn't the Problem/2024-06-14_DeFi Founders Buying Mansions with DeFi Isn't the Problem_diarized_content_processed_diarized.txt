00:00:00.240 - 00:00:33.420, Speaker A: In my view, the man built one of the most valuable Defi protocols. He should be a millionaire and buy as many mansions as he wants. Same thing when people criticize Kane for buying property. It's just weird to me to see crypto people turn into sudden communists when they see founders succeed building legitimate businesses.

Soroban on stellar a smart contract platform to build deep fight for the real world.
00:00:33.532 - 00:00:35.236, Speaker B: More on them later in the show.
00:00:35.340 - 00:01:05.220, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Welcome to Crypto with Kami, where we go through all the main headlines in crypto and Defi in the past week. In 30 minutes or less. This is a show for the week starting June 10. We'll talk about Curve finance founder Michael Egarov's massive liquidations. Eric Gensler saying the ETH ETF will likely get approved over the summer, the CK sync Airdrop, a couple of exploits and more. As always, I'll give you my hot take and then quickly go through the rest of the week's main headlines.
00:01:05.220 - 00:01:40.004, Speaker A: Okay, let's start with Egarov's liquidations. So it finally happened. Curve founders Michael Egarov's huge DeFi loans got liquidated. For context, this was a threat that had been looming over DeFi for months. Michael Egrob, the founder of Curve, borrowed 100 million in stablecoins using 140 million of crV, that's curves token, as collateral. He used many DeFi protocols to do this. So for reference, 140 million in collateral is about 30% of CRV's total market cap of around 370 million.
00:01:40.004 - 00:02:30.514, Speaker A: This matters because if the price of CRV falls enough that Agarov can't supply the additional collateral needed, then that CRV collateral would get liquidated. If loans aren't paid back, then that would leave DeFi protocols with bad debt. So really, this single individual had started to pose almost a systemic risk to the entire deFi ecosystem. Or at least that was the concern. So the size of Michael's loans had been making defi nervous for months. Last July, Egarov came close to getting liquidated, and it prompted Defi whales to band together and help him top up his collateral before he did get liquidated. It also prompted avid to apply more conservative metrics to CRV following a proposal from Gauntlet.
00:02:30.514 - 00:03:28.560, Speaker A: But this time around, Eggarov's positions got wiped out quickly, following a sharp decline in CRB liquidations, which means lending protocol sells CRV in the open market to help pay back the debt led CRV to fall further. Curves token dropped by as much as 45% in the past seven days. Egrobs 140 million of collateral distributed across five protocols, inverse, overland, Fraxland, lameland and Ave was liquidated. Curve lend, which was launched by Egrav's Curve finance, was hit with 11.5 million worth of bad debt as of Thursday, Egroff said only CRV market on curv land was affected and I've already repaid 93% and intend to repay the very the rest very shortly. It will help users not suffer from the situation. According to Arkham Intelligence, two of Egroff's accounts also incurred more than 1 million worth of bad debt.
00:03:28.560 - 00:04:19.406, Speaker A: However, Ekorov cleared the debt after selling 30 million of CRV tokens to Christian seal of NextGen Venture partners for 6 million USDT. So that's where we're at, and there's a few takeaways from this. The first is that it turns out that Michael Egroff's massive CRV backed loans didnt present such a huge risk to defi as a whole. Beyond crv cratering, Defi lenders remain overall healthy lenders. TVL collateral ratios and lending rates are all stable throughout egroffs liquidation next some people are raising the alarm about Agarov taking out massive loans against his token and even giving him shit for buying a huge mansion with it. In my view, the man built one of the most valuable Defi protocols. He should be a millionaire and buy as many mansions as he wants.
00:04:19.406 - 00:05:13.472, Speaker A: Same thing when people criticize Cain for buying property. It's just weird to me to see crypto people turn into sudden communists when they see founders succeed building legitimate businesses. So aggro should be able to get rich from founding curve and cash out on a CRV stack in the same way that web two founders get rich off their company equity. A bit of a difference here is that Egrov, instead of selling CRV, took loans against it, and now that the CRB was liquidated, it was an indirect way of selling. He basically got $100 million in stables for 140 million in CRB collateral, minus whatever he was able to pay off his liquidations. I'm not sure if the deal would have been a lot better if he had directly sold CRV onto the market, considering slippage, but that's a different issue. What I think you could criticize is how soon he started cashing out.
00:05:13.472 - 00:05:28.784, Speaker A: Typical founders vesting schedules last four years with a one year cliff. That means founders can't sell any shares for the first year. Since they get those shares after the first year, they begin vesting their shares on a monthly or quarterly basis over.
00:05:28.824 - 00:05:30.192, Speaker B: The remaining three year period.
00:05:30.288 - 00:05:32.160, Speaker A: In the case of CRV, the token.
00:05:32.192 - 00:05:34.832, Speaker B: Was launched in August 2020, and as.
00:05:34.848 - 00:06:14.776, Speaker A: Soon as December of that year, egroff started to borrow against it on Abe. Still, borrowing against tokens isn't exactly cashing out, and you could argue that liquidations four years after launch roughly matches the average founder vesting schedule. So it's not so bad. So no, I don't think the correct take here is that Defi founders shouldn't use the very infrastructure they built and tokens they launched to borrow more crypto or cash out. They're just using DeFi, following Defi rules, paying market rates. Nothing wrong with that. I think the problem here lies in what those DeFi rules are.
00:06:14.776 - 00:07:22.874, Speaker A: There's definitely something off here if someone is able to put up 30% of the total market cap of a token as collateral, especially tokens that don't have enough liquidity to be able to find buyers worth that collateral in short notice. So while all lending protocols take their own lending ratios into account, we should take advantage of the fact that DeFi is fully transparent and make sure that lending protocols take into account global lending ratios, not just what's happening on their own platforms. So they should look at what's total collateral and total loans being taken out against assets in all of DeFi. One drew Kirk, the founder of credit guild, makes this point too. He recommends that when global leverage ratios are becoming risky, protocol should gradually alter parameters, including setting the loan to value ratio to zero, gradually raising the liquidation thresholds and raising interest rates. So at least now we don't have this massive threat of Ekarov's liquidations looming over DeFi. It happened.
00:07:22.874 - 00:07:38.504, Speaker A: Defi didn't end. Everyone's moved on. He has said that he's committed as ever to continue building curve, but there are some takeaways and important lessons for DeFi lenders to take into account.
00:07:38.804 - 00:08:00.564, Speaker C: Protocol 20 introduces Sorbonne, which is stellar's cutting edge smart contracts platform. This creates new surface area for innovation and provides new opportunities for developers to build protocols and products that create access to everyday financial services. So it means a gradual increase in transaction capacity and a chance to fine tune applications, and it's the most transformative upgrade to the stellar network to date.
00:08:01.784 - 00:08:13.484, Speaker A: Now, moving on to ETH news, ACC chair Gary Gensler said that Ethereum ETF's will likely be approved by the end of the summer. In a testimony given to a subcommittee of the Senate.
00:08:13.864 - 00:09:16.954, Speaker B: Next ProShares Proshares filed an s one registration statement for a spot Ethereum ETF emerging as a major contender in the race to bring spot ETH ETF's to the market. Broshares manages $70 billion in assets, including two x leveraged long and short ETH ETF's, which were launched recently. Also, it looks like institutions are warming up to ETH. Coinshares found that funds holding ETH at their best week since March, in stark contrast to last year when Coinshares called Ethereum the least loved asset. Also, we have a great feature detailing all of the changes in Ethereums upcoming Petra upgrade. There are so many changes that it might need to split into two different hard forks. We also had a major airdrop this week from CK Sync, so CK Sync is a zero knowledge proof based Ethereum L2, and the CK Sync association said it plans to distribute 3.675
00:09:16.954 - 00:09:35.362, Speaker B: billion CK tokens, or 17.5% of the total CK token supply of 21 billion tokens. The airdrop will run from June 24 to January 3 of next year. For context, 17.5% front airdrops is on.
00:09:35.378 - 00:09:48.786, Speaker A: The high side, as most major token distributions have been at around 10%, but as always, not everyone was happy with the airdrop mechanics. CK Sync said that over 6 million.
00:09:48.850 - 00:10:20.674, Speaker B: Unique addresses interacted with the network. That's an insane amount, making the L2 scaling solution one of the most heavily farmed air jobs. Yet some users feel that the team was in an impossible position considering the large number of civil users, while others are outraged that real users are not being rewarded more. We had a couple of other L2 news optimism. The team behind the L2 network op Mainnet, launched support for permissionless fault.
00:10:20.714 - 00:10:22.058, Speaker A: Proofs on the network.
00:10:22.226 - 00:10:56.944, Speaker B: The upgrade allows users to execute ETH and ERC 20 withdrawals without requiring actions from centralized third parties, and enables any op mainnet user to challenge and remove invalid withdrawals in exchange for compensation. Similarly, the Arborgym community passed the preliminary temperature check vote for a proposal to introduce permissionless transaction validations. The upgrade would achieve what Vitalik buterin termed as stage two decentralization. This means that no centralized entity can unilaterally post state route of the layer.
00:10:56.984 - 00:11:00.360, Speaker A: Two network, so all signs optimism and.
00:11:00.392 - 00:11:03.344, Speaker B: Arbitrum are decentralizing further.
00:11:03.464 - 00:12:06.512, Speaker A: We also had a couple of exploits this week. Unfortunately, UWu Lend was exploited twice for a total of $23 million. Notably, the second time happened when the lender was trying to process Michael Egroff's liquidations and loopring and Ethereum L2 reported a security breach that resulted in the loss of $5 million worth of tokens. We also had a few noteworthy product announcements. Metamask announced it's introducing a pooled staking to allow users to participate in Ethereum staking with allocations of less than the usual 32 ETH minimum. So competing with Lido staking giants and speaking of that Eigen layer competitor symbiotic launched this week together with liquid staking protocol Melo Finance. Melo attracted over $100 million of TvL in one day after launch, and Melo.
00:12:06.568 - 00:12:19.648, Speaker B: And symbiotic have really close ties with Lido. The thought is that they could help boost staked ETH's market cap and reaffirm Lido's lead as the largest DeFi protocol.
00:12:19.736 - 00:12:32.168, Speaker A: Another major headline this week is one of the largest collapses in the history of crypto is finally getting closure. Terraform Labs, the company behind the now defunct UST stablecoin, has agreed to pay.
00:12:32.216 - 00:12:36.084, Speaker B: The SEC $4.47 billion.
00:12:36.424 - 00:13:15.784, Speaker A: The settlement raises eyebrows. Many wonder whether Terraform even has the money to pay off the debt, while others were enraged that these funds didn't go to users who lost money from the collapse of the protocol and is going to the SEC instead. Pretty outrageous. I'll run through the next few headlines. Donald Trump continues to court the crypto community. He said he wants every remaining bitcoin to be mined within the United States. Trump added that bolstering the domestic mining industry will also serve to promote the country's energy industry and protect the nation against the hypothetical moves to introduce a CBDC.
00:13:16.444 - 00:13:21.676, Speaker B: It would also, I think, centralize bitcoin, but that's another issue.
00:13:21.780 - 00:13:49.314, Speaker A: Tokenized Treasuries so past 1.5 billion of market cap. And speaking of tokenization, bitcoin Swiss, a swiss crypto financial services provider managing $5.57 billion in assets, issued a tokenized bond on top of Polygon. Also, Uniswap acquires Crypto, the game and and Socialfi app Frontech wants to develop its own blockchain.
00:13:49.394 - 00:14:07.594, Speaker B: Okay, those were the main headlines for this week. Curious to know what you think about Michael Eggroff's liquidations. Should he have taken out those massive loans against his own token? And what should defi lenders do to protect against that risk? Thanks for joining me and see you next week.
