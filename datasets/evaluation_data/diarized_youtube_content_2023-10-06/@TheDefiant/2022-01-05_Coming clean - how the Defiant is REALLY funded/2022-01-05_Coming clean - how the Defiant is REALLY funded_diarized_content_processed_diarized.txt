00:00:10.650 - 00:00:19.018, Speaker A: Some say you shouldn't read the comments on YouTube videos, but I do. I read every single one. And some of you, oh, some of you, you do make me laugh.
00:00:19.114 - 00:00:19.710, Speaker B: Many.
00:00:19.860 - 00:00:30.594, Speaker A: Why your video so long? Have you had eye surgery, cringe, etc. Etc. All good. That is just the game. But what's not good is how many comments we see about being paid shills.
00:00:30.642 - 00:00:34.546, Speaker B: Or about our sponsors messages. And I understand the skepticism about crypto.
00:00:34.578 - 00:00:39.094, Speaker A: Content in general, because how can you ever be sure what the motivations are.
00:00:39.212 - 00:00:41.946, Speaker B: Behind a piece of content? So that's why I wanted to make.
00:00:41.968 - 00:00:43.866, Speaker A: This video, to come clean, if you.
00:00:43.888 - 00:00:51.882, Speaker B: Like, because with the defined, it's actually very, very simple. Unlike other channels you'll come across. We don't make any money from ads because we don't run any.
00:00:52.016 - 00:00:54.326, Speaker A: YouTubers make more ad money the more.
00:00:54.368 - 00:00:55.886, Speaker B: Views they get, but we don't make.
00:00:55.908 - 00:00:58.846, Speaker A: Any money from views. So there's no incentive to make the.
00:00:58.868 - 00:01:00.890, Speaker B: Kind of content that maximizes views.
00:01:00.970 - 00:01:03.006, Speaker A: And trust me, if we did, the.
00:01:03.028 - 00:01:05.774, Speaker B: Content on this channel would be very, very different.
00:01:05.892 - 00:01:25.506, Speaker A: And what that means is we can be weird. We can cover the strange fringe stuff that doesn't get covered anywhere else. And most importantly, we are not exploiting you and your eyeballs. Now, we do make money from the channel, of course, but that's done through sponsors. When a request comes in, I forward it to Camilla and she vets the team. I have nothing to do with those decisions.
00:01:25.618 - 00:01:26.646, Speaker B: And we do get a lot of.
00:01:26.668 - 00:01:43.558, Speaker A: Requests to partner up on stuff or to blow stuff up. And we say no to everyone, with two notable exceptions. That's ledger and real vision. There have been no other partnerships when it comes to deciding on editorial what we cover. I keep an ear out for what's.
00:01:43.574 - 00:01:44.518, Speaker B: Going on, and I keep a list.
00:01:44.544 - 00:01:52.926, Speaker A: Of anything I find interesting. I work on it with ALp, who's behind the camera here. We pitch it to Camilla on Mondays and that's it. Now, I might ask a team for.
00:01:52.948 - 00:01:54.206, Speaker B: More information if I need it, but.
00:01:54.228 - 00:02:09.446, Speaker A: Generally we do all the homework ourselves, out of sight of the project we're covering. And very rarely do we tell them that we are in fact covering them. It's a surprise. None of this is to say that I'm unbiased, because of course that's impossible. But if a project is covered on.
00:02:09.468 - 00:02:11.606, Speaker B: This channel, you can be 100% certain.
00:02:11.708 - 00:02:17.686, Speaker A: That no money exchanged hands for that to happen. So hopefully that answers your questions about this.
00:02:17.788 - 00:02:20.306, Speaker B: No financial incentive to cover projects funded.
00:02:20.338 - 00:02:27.480, Speaker A: Segments only appear in marked sponsors bits, and we don't run ads clear thanks for watching.
00:02:29.290 - 00:02:36.940, Speaker C: Give me even magazine wishes. Close.
