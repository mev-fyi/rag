00:00:00.490 - 00:00:24.062, Speaker A: This is an artist. And this is a computer. This is art made by an artist. This is art made by a computer. And this, well this is art made by an artist and a computer which was created at the exact moment the buyer purchased it. And this, well, this is me back on June 11. Not buying Tyler Hobbs Videnza from me is the .17
00:00:24.062 - 00:02:03.614, Speaker A: e because yeah, I thought generative art was dumb. June 11 is actually my birthday and boy, what a present that would have been. Now, if you've been scratching your head about the value of generative art and python scripts and all that stuff, particularly in the light of the frankly staggering big money buys sweeping in in the last ten days, I don't blame you. But in this film we're going to explore the art blocks phenomenon, speak to its founder, snowfrow, and probably experience some deep regret along the way. Are you ready to get arty? This is the defiant during the big Nft surge of the past spring. The hype was around one of ones exclusive sales from named artists that brought the Muggles scrambling for any way they could to access platform nine and three quarters. But didn't that all feel also very web two? There was some cool work created and sold, but to me the best work to come out of this space has always been the work that feels like it could only exist here.
00:02:03.614 - 00:02:50.650, Speaker A: A genuinely crypto native experience and with generative art styled by humans but executed by code, I feel like we have something that fills that brief. Personally, I was pretty slow to see it, but now it seems so obvious. And perhaps this explains why, of all the JPEGs in all the websites in all the world, it's these ugly bastards who have inexorably claimed the mantle of poster punks for the crypto generation. And their importance to the artblock story will become apparent once we meet the legendary punking instigator himself, Snowfrow. But first, let's take a moment to hear from our spunking instigators. I'm of course talking about our sponsors, the ones that make this channel possible. The first one up is Balancer, who've been a fantastic supporter of the defiant and consistently proven themselves to be one of the best defi protocols in town.
00:02:50.650 - 00:03:22.962, Speaker A: Their gas optimized vault architecture makes trading cheaper than anywhere else. Liquidity providers can optimize their fee earnings using the dynamic fee system that automatically adjusts to market conditions. You can also use asset managers to lend out idle assets, dramatically increasing your capital efficiency. Because balancer is an open platform for flexible automated markets, you can choose from stable pools or weighted pools. And in the future, tons and tons more designs will be created that, frankly, we don't even know about yet. Check it out at balancer Phi. Our next sponsor is Ava.
00:03:22.962 - 00:04:07.750, Speaker A: Fun fact, the name ABa is actually taken from the finnish word for ghost, and it's a decentralized open source and non custodial liquidity protocol built on Ethereum. Depositors earn interest by providing liquidity to lending pools, while borrowers can obtain loans by tapping into these pools with variable and stable interest rate options. Deposit into AVA protocol and receive a tokens which accrue interest every second right in your wallet. And it's fun just seeing your balance just go every second. Swap any of your deposited assets at any time to get the best yields on the market. And for the developers out there, ava features access to defi building blocks like flash loans and credit delegation. The other protocol liquidity pools are now available on Ethereum and everyone's favorite sidechain, Polygon.
00:04:07.750 - 00:04:48.930, Speaker A: Okay, so it's time for a quick recap on what on earth has been happening. For starters, tens of millions of dollars have been spent on generative art NFTs in the last ten days. Yes, the punks were the big headline generator, three arrows capital, Gary Vee. But the fun actually started when the weirdly monikered Vincent van Doe acquired three Fidenzas for $600,000. And it's worth sparing a thought here for the person who sold a Fidenza to the person who then sold that Fidenza to Vincent. I'm, of course, talking about little wheel.
00:05:09.870 - 00:05:32.754, Speaker B: Looking at the Opensea transaction now is pretty depressing. And you've got to remember that like two months ago, the markets didn't really care that much by NFTs. So when I was minting them, it's like the contract was selling off super, super slowly. No one was paying attention. And I had this idea that what I'd do is I'd. I would just mint from the contract and then dump onto Opensea so I could. I think I had like 0.1
00:05:32.754 - 00:06:11.806, Speaker B: ETH in my wallet or something because everything was automatic. But I would mint from the contract and then dump onto Opensea so I could keep minting more because I really liked the pieces and that's kind of why it hurts so much. But yeah, I had this stupid idea and I just dumped, without looking at any of the trades or anything else, just to keep minting. And it kind of worked, right? Like, I got like three of them, four of them, or something like that. But yeah, fast forward two months, the markets decided that Videnzas and our blocks are like the new hottest thing ever. And, yeah, I saw, like, a couple sell for 1020 30 E, and I knew that I really messed up. I was like, well, I don't know.
00:06:11.806 - 00:06:30.210, Speaker B: You can't really predict it, right? So you just got to let it go. Maybe that's cope. But, yeah, Vincent Van Doe is crazy. He just bought out everything. And, yeah, as soon as I saw him buying it, I was just like, yeah, this is done. And, yeah, I don't know. It's depressing, but it's like, you wouldn't have known that two months ago.
00:06:30.210 - 00:06:33.122, Speaker B: So you got to trade with the market that you're given, and that's about it.
00:06:33.176 - 00:07:08.278, Speaker A: Vincent has been on a spree, buying NFTs like they're the last meal on earth. And in particular, he's been buying from the art blocks label. As I write this, 345 from created, 110 from playground, and 245 from factory. The effect of all of this is to signal quite clearly to the market that art blocks is hot shit. But here's the secret. Art blocks has always been hot shit. It's just that most people, myself included, didn't realize generative art is basically the perfect fit for crypto.
00:07:08.278 - 00:07:55.978, Speaker A: It creates communities, it's inextricably woven with code, but it's also energetic, unpredictable, and, yeah, fun. So what exactly is generative art? Well, if we go straight to the Internet's encyclopedia, Wikipedia, generative art refers to artwork that's in some way created by an autonomous system. Generally, that means non human. Now, in the NFT space, what this typically refers to is an algorithm created by an artist coder, where the NFT minting process itself generates the art. Sure, the algorithm will set attributes such as color, shape, curves, etc. But the mix of those attributes is randomly generated in the minting process itself, so no two pieces will be the same. And both the artist coder and the buyer have no idea what the piece will look like before it lands in your wallet.
00:07:55.978 - 00:08:25.106, Speaker A: You are in the hands of fate. So to show you how that all looks, I went and did a drop myself. So this is it. It's two minutes of the drop, and we are going into full attack mode. So the first thing I'm going to do normally is look in discord and track the conversations that's going on there. Fortunately, this drop is an open drop, so it's going to be open for the next 45 minutes. But the tactic here is not to go in in the first couple of minutes because people will be spamming hard or the gas will surge.
00:08:25.106 - 00:08:58.180, Speaker A: And we don't want that. The other thing we do is we keep an eye on the gas. So I use this little widget here, which is gas now, and this will tell me what's happening with the gas situation. And it's now 1 minute to the drop, so we can keep an eye on that. But the good thing is we will have time to bed in and mint. But I'm reckoning that I'll leave it a couple of minutes, see what happens and then start to see what people are actually minting. So what I will do is I will check in the R blocks main channel, start to have a look at some of the conversations that are going on there.
00:08:58.180 - 00:09:27.322, Speaker A: And then it's just like wait for the moment. And these r blocks drops. It is so exciting. Normally when it's a limited drop you're just like. But this one, what we're going to try and do is we're going to try and breathe luck into these mitts and roll something really cool. But we don't know what we're going to get because as Snowfroy told us, there's just this little magic thing that happens. The hash, the string, the art, the algorithm.
00:09:27.322 - 00:09:31.040, Speaker A: And then there it is. Let's see what happens.
00:09:35.090 - 00:09:35.870, Speaker C: I'm.
00:09:47.270 - 00:09:50.034, Speaker A: Okay, I'm done buying. We will check back in on that.
00:09:50.232 - 00:09:52.338, Speaker C: Later the next day.
00:09:52.424 - 00:10:17.318, Speaker A: So now it's time to take a look at what I actually got. Because I was just minting, minting, minting, minting what's known as spam minting. Because like with all these things, you just don't know what you're going to get. And because each time it's different. It's addictive. And so what I've got here is my gallery on the Artblocks website and I can have a look at all these different pieces of digital art that were created. And I have to say they're absolutely stunning.
00:10:17.318 - 00:10:49.094, Speaker A: We have variations that are red. We've got five flowers, six flowers. Some instances here I've got a 22 flower instance, I've got 19 flowers, which apparently is the most rare. I've got ones that look like jellyfish. This one in particular I just find beautiful. So I can click on details and it will give me the various features of the piece. I can look at a full static rendered image of the thing, but we can also run the script live.
00:10:49.094 - 00:11:47.140, Speaker A: If we look at the live script, it says we can visit the live script which will run the script in the browser and generate the content in real time and some instances on our blocks, you can actually manipulate the image in 3D, like transitions, for instance, which I have some of, so we can have a look at those. So here's transitions, which is from Jason Ting and Matt Billfield. Same thing again, if we click on. If we select the image now, we're going to run the script in the browser and you will see that it's starting to move. But not only that, but we can also manipulate it so we can move it around and have a look at it from different angles. And we can also zoom in really close and see what's going on. And after a while, it starts to become kind of mesmeric.
00:11:47.140 - 00:12:29.780, Speaker A: And yes, it is quite a simple thing, but when you think about how it's created and the elegance with which the code has been implemented, then it starts to get a lot more arresting, interesting, collectible. So, look, all of this is nothing new, really. Artists have been playing around with computer assisted art since the 1960s. Raymond Alger's robot painting machine is a good early example, and today, the very best artist coders like Rafique Anadol are creating word that is both stunning and aweinspiring. But our blocks inhabits a different kind of space. Here you have the thrill of the role when you mint. There's the ease and speed of trading on OpenSea, and there's an instant global community to tap into.
00:12:29.780 - 00:13:21.536, Speaker A: And each successive drop both enriches and gains stature, thanks to the ones that went before. Now, again, like I said, it all seems so obvious now, but our blocks hasn't even been around that long. And it all starts with the journey of one man, who early on realized there was something genuinely special here. His name is Snowfrow, a Mexico City born generative artist and technologist. And he was one of those now incredibly rare humans who was present at the original cryptopunk claiming event in 2017. Today, he owns over 60 of them, including seven zombies, two apes, and a partial claim to one of the nine aliens, the rarest cryptopunk character of all. He's also one of the few lava labs designated cryptopunks, moderators recognizable by his distinctive fro zombie.
00:13:21.536 - 00:13:25.856, Speaker A: But there was something nagging the fro. A crucial question that needed answering.
00:13:25.968 - 00:14:00.224, Speaker C: The idea of our blocks came while I was claiming my cryptopunks. As I was claiming my cryptopunks, I was baffled by the idea, by the fact that I was able to claim all the rare ones, all the zombies. Like, I literally got to pick the ones I wanted, and I thought man, blockchain technology can totally fix this. I can click a button that says claim and some math would be done in the background, and I would be presented with my crypto punk, whether it was a zombie or an ape or an alien, based on the Ods of it occurring, not based on my inclination to select the ones that I really wanted to select.
00:14:00.342 - 00:14:14.464, Speaker A: And so our blocks is born. You have to convince artists that blockchain is a thing, that NFTs are a thing, and that there's an audience for what they're doing. How hard was that in 2018?
00:14:14.512 - 00:14:45.688, Speaker C: It was impossible. In 2018, if you wanted to explain to somebody what an NFT was, you had to explain what the smart contract was, and then you had to explain what Ethereum was, and then you had to explain what a distributed ledger was, and then you had to explain, just to kind of sum it up, what bitcoin was and how this all kind of tied together. And it was just this really long conversation. So finding the ven diagram between a creative coder and someone that understood blockchain enough to not feel completely intimidated was very difficult, almost impossible.
00:14:45.784 - 00:14:54.716, Speaker A: But the word now is firmly out, and with huge sums being earned in the secondary market, has the original vision of Artblocks as a platform for artists been lost?
00:14:54.828 - 00:16:04.330, Speaker C: I think we have a significant amount of members of the community that really are not necessarily chasing profits right now, I hope, at least, because I think that's what kind of keeps me excited. But I think a lot of it has to do with the ability for someone to own this tiny little sliver of an artist's soul. Like the artist puts together this piece without knowing what the outputs are going to be. And then you experientially create the piece based on the artist's work, and you end up with this thing that belongs to you, you created it, and obviously people sell it sometimes, and that's part of this mad crypto world that we're in. But the idea that you have this piece and it's unique and makes you an individual, especially during COVID and this whole thing where everyone's just on computers all the time, I think there's just this really beautiful thing where the individuality that comes from purchasing a piece on Artblocks becomes infectious, not just for yourself, but then when you start sharing with other people in the discord what you got and what they got, and people start putting together this beautiful emotional connection to this piece of art, I think that has a lot to do with it.
00:16:08.780 - 00:16:47.248, Speaker A: The generative art scene is, let's be honest, pretty niche, but the community values open collaboration and education. And if you're interested in learning more, it's worth picking up a couple of books. Processing, a programming handbook for visual designers, and Matt Pearson's generative art a practical guide using processing. But if all that's too much for you, you can learn more about the Artblock's tech philosophy on their website. And here you discover that most of the art is created using P five Js code. P five Js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, and the goal is to make coding accessible for everyone, not just programmers. So people like artists, educators, beginners, or me.
00:16:47.248 - 00:17:24.080, Speaker A: P five Js isn't just about drawing on a canvas, though. It allows you to use the whole browser so you can use text, you can use videos, sound, and any other input you can think of. So let's give it a go. So, like I said, if we go on the Artblocks website and we go to the learn page, it gives you a bunch of information about how these projects are created. And then if you go down to how Artblocks works in depth, it tells you a generative script using P five Js, for example. We can click on that and it will take us to the P five JS website, gives you a bunch of information about it. There's a bunch of community stuff, forums, libraries, learning resources.
00:17:24.080 - 00:17:53.450, Speaker A: But if you want to just get started, you click on this button here, start creating with the P five editor, which opens up this window. And here we are now in code. And it's like, oh, what do I do now? So up here you'll see a play button and a stop button. You can play, and this is all that happens. So if we look in the code here, it says, create canvas 400 by 400. And that's exactly what it's done. It's created a canvas of 400 by 400.
00:17:53.450 - 00:18:48.504, Speaker A: We could also say create canvas, change this to 800, press play again, and now you can see it's an 800 by 400 canvas. Well, that's not very exciting, is it? But if you go back to the homepage, there are some examples, and you can click through a bunch of different examples here of different things that you might want to do. So, for instance, we could look at Brownie in motion, which will draw this very exciting, but it also gives you the code. So because it's code, you can start to tweak it and do things with it and start playing around with what you might want to do. Now, what other examples might we have here? Oh, a spirograph let's have a look at that. So this is creating something kind of cool. It's very basic, but you can start to see how these shapes, these ideas, these feelings of movement could start to inform something a lot more refined.
00:18:48.504 - 00:19:28.756, Speaker A: Add color in there, add some randomness, add some wiggliness, some turbulence, these kind of things, to create something that's starting to look like a project that could be on art blocks. We're a long way away from that. Now, one I particularly liked here is this flocking one. So I can click and draw the flocks here so I can actually copy all the code. If I go back into my editor here, paste all that code, press play. Now, it will do this so I can go around here and maybe mess around with some of the fill so I can change the fill. As you can see, hopefully you can see the fill is a little bit transparent.
00:19:28.756 - 00:20:03.940, Speaker A: So I could change the fill to, for instance, ten, or run that again. And now you're going to get just an outline here. Or we could change it to 200 and it will probably be a block arrow. There we go. We can change all those different things. Now, this is a long way away from being something I would ever want to share with people, but because everything is transparent and just here in the codes, you can start to dig into what these codes are doing and start playing around with instances where you can get something genuinely interesting. Maybe not artistic yet, but certainly interesting.
00:20:03.940 - 00:20:52.768, Speaker A: Now, let's imagine that I am not a beginner, but I'm actually a very crafty coder. And I've built this amazing algorithm. Once that P five Js code is created, the script is stored on chain, which proves its provenance and secures it to the immutable ledger. Now, to amble clarity here, it's only the logic behind the series that's hosted on the chain, not the actual visual representation itself. Now, in practice, this means that when an NFT using that script is minted a unique seed or hash string, there's long alpha numeric sets that are everywhere in crypto. One of those is randomly generated with the script, and it's that combination which generates the artwork. Now, generally, what happens is an artist puts a limit on this series when we think of PFPs or profile picks like punks or board apes.
00:20:52.768 - 00:21:32.396, Speaker A: Sweet spot is generally thought to be around 10,000. But art blocks mints are much, much smaller, usually less than 1000, which does give each collection much greater cachet. Now, each drop creates new opportunities for collectors to get in on the ground floor and become part of this very crypto specific art movement. And prices range from kind of zero, one to zero, something like that. So they're not massively expensive. Now, while Fidenzas and ringers have skyrocketed in price, there's actually one Artblocks piece that really represents the soul of the collection. And if Artblocks has its punk equivalent, it's this, the chromy squiggle.
00:21:32.396 - 00:21:43.952, Speaker A: Now, unlike the other collections, there are many squiggles, meaning they're actually still relatively affordable. But if you're looking to see if a collector really understands their art blocks, just check if they own a squiggle.
00:21:44.016 - 00:22:31.204, Speaker C: The squiggle was originally created to kind of demonstrate what could be done with generative minting, to kind of prove that you could have thousands and thousands and thousands of potentially millions of outputs without a collision, which is without two things that were identical. It's a script that I developed over the course of two years. It actually started with me wanting to send chromy scoggles to the entire design industry in Houston. And so I printed 2000 of them. I generated 2000 of them using the Ethereum blockchain as the block hash as the generative input, and then framed them and gave them to my clients. And that was to demonstrate the technology that was to demonstrate, I guess, creativity. As time went by, I started noticing that there's not a lot of other things that look like chromy squiggles out there.
00:22:31.204 - 00:22:55.656, Speaker C: And I started feeling very strongly that the chromy squiggle itself could be something very unique and very identifiable, even in 10,000 or 100,000 iterations. So over the course of those two years, I kind of started modifying it. I started tinkering with it. And then I started feeling really good about putting it on the platform. So I put it out there as kind of representing me. I like colorful things. I like rainbows.
00:22:55.656 - 00:23:21.380, Speaker C: I like light hearted stuff. And to me, the squiggle is this light hearted, goofy thing that it's like my signature, if you will. And the end result has been such that I think we have 9184 as of today. They're all unique and people can recognize them pretty immediately. And I think for that reason, I feel like we achieved the goal.
00:23:39.720 - 00:24:27.584, Speaker A: There are currently three labels on Artblocks. There's curated factory and playground. The curated collection is, as the name suggests, curated by the Artblocks team. And these projects are vetted and are supposed to add something unique to the overall body of curated work. According to Artblocks, they represent the best vision for the Artblocks platform. The current waiting list for curated projects will likely take around two years to process, so there is no shortage of artists looking for exposure on the platform. Then there's playground, and once an artist has a curated project, they can then release a more experimental project on the platform.
00:24:27.584 - 00:25:22.624, Speaker A: Now, these projects aren't as carefully vetted and have certain stipulations. For instance, only one project at a time per artist can be active in playground, and there's a month cooldown period once the project goes off playground before the artist can release another one. Finally, there's the factory collection. And this is the newest collection type looking to solve the problem of too many artists wanting to get onto the platform itself. And in factory, any artist can showcase their work, but before they can create another series, they must sell out the first. And like Playground, they'll also have a one month cooldown in between projects. So our blocks, well, it's successful.
00:25:22.624 - 00:25:49.260, Speaker A: And one of the reasons it's been so successful is people could buy and almost instantly flip for 5610 x what they paid. And obviously the side effect of all this is that artblocks drops are now victims of the most savage gas wars I have ever seen, as speculators overbid themselves for a quick flip opportunity. None of this benefits either artblocks or the artists themselves, with all that additional value jumping straight into the pockets of the miners. So what can be done about this?
00:25:49.330 - 00:26:25.704, Speaker C: We originally wanted everyone to be able to buy art for an affordable price because the artist is going to be making even at 0.1 e, the artist is making life changing money with a drop of 1000 iterations. And it was already a lot of money being collected. It was already a lot of money going to the artist. And we love that it made it to where people could each individually mint something and own something. From such a brilliant mind, that's changed. We can try to pretend like it hasn't, but the fact that today, if you want to buy something on Artblocks, you buy a piece for 0.1
00:26:25.704 - 00:26:47.052, Speaker C: and then you pay another 0.5 in gas just to be able to secure the mint. So yeah, I guess from an egalitarian perspective, you can still buy it for 0.1, but you're actually out of pocket 0.6. So that is no longer feasible. And it's not just because of the gas wars, it's because there's no price discovery. So our blocks is looking for ways to create price discovery.
00:26:47.052 - 00:27:43.776, Speaker C: That is what's missing in this ecosystem for us, that's what's missing in this ecosystem, for most NFTs out there, we don't know what the consensus value is going to be. And you have to consider consensus value at the moment of minting consensus value 24 hours later, and then consensus value three months later. If you have a long term mentality towards this, then three months later, a year later, three years later, your $300 NFT could be worth a million bucks. It could also be completely worthless. The day of the mint, people are able to instantly flip the price of the piece for more than what they paid for it, even on top of what was paid for. The mining of the transactions means that there's just a complete lack of price discovery there. We are not a wholesaler of generative art, catering to a retailer of generative art being the flippers to then be the ones that sell our art for us.
00:27:43.776 - 00:28:11.396, Speaker C: We do want to support the ecosystem, but that's not our intention. We are not here to support a retailer. We want to directly get the art into people's hands, because the minting process is so fun. Creating it on demand is so special that we don't want people to miss out on that. So one thing that we've started tinkering with is the idea of a dutch auction. A dutch auction starts really high. Hopefully, artists start pushing that a little higher just so it doesn't sell out immediately.
00:28:11.396 - 00:28:32.080, Speaker C: But, yeah, when you have a dutch auction, you're basically creating a consensus price, at which point people think, hey, this is how much I would like to pay for this piece. And so there's not a huge opportunity, there's not a huge upside for people that want to buy the piece, literally just to mint it, because we've already kind of established what the value of that piece is by consensus in advance.
00:28:37.300 - 00:29:21.520, Speaker A: So while I was speaking to Snowfrow, he told me that for generative artists, the amount they raise on the platform is significantly higher than they might normally expect to raise anywhere else. But beyond that, the art block smart contracts also specified that an artist will receive 5% of the sales each time an artwork is resold. And in this way, the artist not only gets paid in perpetuity, but it can also track how the artwork is trading hands. While 5% doesn't seem like a whole lot, if you think that Tyler Hobbes's Fidenza collection is now worth between $15 to $20 million, 5% of that makes Tyler Hobbes a millionaire. Well, that isn't what's important here. There is big money everywhere in crypto, we know this. But for newbies coming into this space.
00:29:21.520 - 00:29:34.288, Speaker A: There is also here the opportunity to pick up a little piece of art, as Fro said, a little sliver of an artist's soul and start collecting something that in the future might well be worth a great deal. Like these flowers, for instance.
00:29:34.384 - 00:30:30.272, Speaker C: With art blocks, I feel know I've always been intimidated to walk into real art galleries. I think NFTs have created a comfort level where even new people can feel accessible, can feel access to art and to conversations about art and to the artists themselves. And something that's happening with artblocks now, it's like you have a drop, and inside of the discord, you have thousands of people sitting there posting their piece that they just minted, talking to the artist, talking about, oh, mine, mine's green and I love green. And some other person likes a red one. And they trade. That experience is elevating art in a new way that really hasn't existed before for a new generation of people that would otherwise feel intimidated or not worthy of having these art conversations. And so if the art world is going to change, if future generations are going to look at art differently than our generation and the previous generations, I think that we might be seeing something happening.
00:30:30.272 - 00:31:02.320, Speaker C: Being born at art blocks, man. It's not just because people like art blocks themselves, but this community that's being created around it, I think, is something very special, something that we didn't plan for, so we can't take credit for it, but something that we really, really want to study and explore over the next few years. Because I think it's kind of revolutionary for art to be this accessible and this exciting while at the same time be this affordable and providing this incredible sense of individuality to the collectors.
00:31:07.400 - 00:31:23.400, Speaker A: I clearly remember my first ever response to art blogs. I didn't get it. I just thought this was lazy art. You were just pressing f five refresh. F five refresh. F five refresh. I couldn't understand why a computer doing all the work could be art.
00:31:23.400 - 00:31:49.970, Speaker A: And it's taken me time to find a way into my own appreciation of what's here. Firstly, though, the community is phenomenal. It's niche and it's weird and it's nerdy. And you have this feeling of being at the beginning of something different, something strange that has value, but it's also artistic and you feel cultured. The randomness of minting is also exciting. You don't know what your role is going to throw up, and that's always a thrill. And then there's the art itself.
00:31:49.970 - 00:32:39.244, Speaker A: I don't love all the pieces there. Some playground and fatchy pieces, I think are more beautiful than the created ones, which are supposed to be the blue chip ones. But some, honestly, are stunning. And what's maybe not made clear enough is that taking a piece of code and compelling it to deliver beautiful results, not one time in a thousand, but every single time, that requires an exceptional level of skill. Now, what generative artists normally do is they run the algorithm thousands and thousands of times until they get that one extraordinary outlier that creates something beautiful. But here, they're not allowed to do that. They have to give the code to the people who are minting and say, I trust that this code is good enough, that there's going to be enough of these that make me look good as an artist.
00:32:39.244 - 00:33:27.872, Speaker A: That's quite a big leap of faith. See, normally in collections, you'll find there's one or two that didn't quite work out right. There's always a runt somewhere. But that's why when you scroll through the 999 images that make up the Fidenza collection, but you fail to find a single one that isn't just stunning and beautiful, that's when you realize why they are now so valuable, and why, when assessing these pieces, you have to take into consideration not just the artist, not just the aesthetics, not just the market, not just artblocks itself, but these works place in the context of all generative art. Fidenza, for want of a better word, is a miracle of art and code collaboration. And I wish I owned one, because now I can understand what's going on here. Unfortunately, they're too expensive for me.
00:33:27.872 - 00:33:43.380, Speaker A: But even though I don't own one, I can still appreciate what's happening here, and maybe I can recognize the next Fidenza when it comes along. I got this same feeling looking at avid lions. Is it Fidenza? I don't know. We shall see.
00:33:43.450 - 00:34:21.884, Speaker C: Artists will spend years possibly refining and tweaking their script, their algorithm, to get to a point where they're happy with every single output. And that is a significant achievement. It's not easy. It's so easy, as used to happen before with generative art, where you would write an algorithm and you would just kind of, like, see all the different outputs, and eventually you'd find the one you like and you keep that one, because that one was really special. And I think that's fine, too. Obviously, that's a really different methodology. What artblocks has done is it's forced the artist to not just get to filter and curate from within their collection.
00:34:21.884 - 00:34:32.260, Speaker C: But be willing to put something out where every single thing meets their expectation and represents them as an artist. And I think that's where the majority of the skill lies.
00:34:32.680 - 00:35:03.630, Speaker A: But as Snowfrow said, there is something here about exposing new generations to art and culture in a completely new way. Not all art blocks pieces are going to go for ten figure sums. Sometimes there are bigger collections with a much lower buy in, like those flowers I picked up in the drop. Or you can pick up a chromy squiggle and just start that journey and be an Og. Those flowers, I don't really care about the price. I just think they look beautiful. And sometimes that really is enough.
00:35:03.630 - 00:35:08.380, Speaker A: From the arty side of the block, this was the defiant.
00:35:20.680 - 00:35:20.996, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:21.018 - 00:35:22.004, Speaker A: So there's a film about.
00:35:22.042 - 00:35:23.796, Speaker C: It's just NFTs in general.
00:35:23.978 - 00:35:25.632, Speaker A: No, it's about art blocks.
00:35:25.776 - 00:35:27.440, Speaker C: The whole film is about our blocks.
00:35:27.520 - 00:35:28.928, Speaker A: Yeah, completely art blocks.
00:35:29.024 - 00:35:31.030, Speaker C: Oh, my God. That's crazy.
00:35:31.560 - 00:35:32.788, Speaker A: Why is that crazy?
00:35:32.954 - 00:35:38.000, Speaker C: It's just crazy to me. I don't know, man. This is all happening so fast. It's.
