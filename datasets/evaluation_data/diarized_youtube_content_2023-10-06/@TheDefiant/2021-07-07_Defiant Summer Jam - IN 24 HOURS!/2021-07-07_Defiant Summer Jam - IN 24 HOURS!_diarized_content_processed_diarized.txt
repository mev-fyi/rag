00:00:00.090 - 00:00:50.454, Speaker A: The Defiant's first summer jam is happening tomorrow. And into this steaming cauldron of hot, sticky goodness, we have drawn what might just be one of the best lineups you'll likely ever see outside of a conference. We have the legendary crypto artist Trevor Jones. We have Gabby Dizon, the founder of Yield Guild Games, a project that is deeply embedded in the heart of the phenomenon that is axie infinity. We have Parker Brooks, formerly Apple Music's head of dance and electronic artist relations, now leading legend, his NFT division. Opposite him, we have a very familiar face in Defi Cooper Turli, a music industry vet and now leading crypto strategy at Audius. Then we have the british team behind top Dog Beach Club, Paul and Abbey representing collectible avatars and another limey in the shape of Richard Welsh, one of the brightest thinkers I know on arts, media and culture Daos, who's currently building a new power chain on Kusama.
00:00:50.454 - 00:01:13.662, Speaker A: We also have actor, musician, writer and artist Simon Wan, whose work you should be familiar with from previous episodes of the define. And finally, our very, very, very special guest is Seth Gable, whose CV boasts acting stints in nip Tuck, fringe, Salem and arrow. We will be discussing the long term future of NFTs for creators and artists, but also just jamming. I mean, come on. What a lineup. It's happening tomorrow. 07:00 p.m.,
00:01:13.662 - 00:01:22.018, Speaker A: CET, 10:00 a.m., PST, 01:00 p.m., ET and 06:00 p.m.. BST. Don't miss it. That's the place to be. I've run out of acronyms.
00:01:22.018 - 00:01:23.080, Speaker A: Get some.
