00:00:07.610 - 00:00:40.786, Speaker A: Hello and welcome to real vision in the Defiance weekly Tetra Tet. On the finer points of decentralized Tom foodery and dancing a Twitter tango, on the tortured titterings of underresearched cocombatants sits a man who really should have been a villain in Game of Thrones. You missed your calling, Sir Ralph Powell, and bringing balance to the forest the only way she knows how. With 2020 vision and a hot web, three media properties, the defiance chief of chiefness, the chiefest, Camilla Russo. And then there's me, middle aged, tired, and running out of ways to craft an introduction. I am Robin Schmidt, and it's been a wonderful, wonderful week of blood. Raul, how are you seeing this from your side of the pond?
00:00:40.898 - 00:00:45.100, Speaker B: I'm seeing that as you're just the king of the intro. That's it. I'm in awe of you.
00:00:45.710 - 00:00:49.574, Speaker C: We need to take a moment to appreciate, turn it into an NFT.
00:00:49.622 - 00:00:50.890, Speaker A: We'll make a fortune.
00:00:52.530 - 00:00:53.280, Speaker C: Amazing.
00:00:54.290 - 00:01:25.078, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's been quite the week, right? But I think most of us have been around for a while. It's kind of just all part of the game. And it's just been interesting being on Twitter, watching the monkeys throwing poo at each other. As soon as things fall apart, everybody's freaking out, accusing each other of all sorts of things. It's kind of hilarious. But within the general context of crypto and the logarithmic trends that I look at, it's kind of nothing really happening. We're just in a big sideways range right now.
00:01:25.078 - 00:02:01.490, Speaker B: And I think I looked at this in detail, and for me, it's all been driven by the lack of inflows into the overall network. We just haven't seen network growth for a while and whether that's a function of consumer spending patterns. So if you raise a lot of prices on people and don't raise their wages enough, then the marginal investor disappears. And I think we've seen that. We've seen that in stuff like the meme stocks as well. So I think that's kept people away and that's kept the market a little more volatile. But from the top down perspective, all I get is phone calls and conference calls with all of the world's biggest investors.
00:02:01.490 - 00:02:19.410, Speaker B: This week alone, I've spoken to two of the largest private equity firms in the world who are like, how do we do this? How do we get involved? And that's speaking to pension funds, asset allocators, everybody. So I don't think anything's changed at all. It's just a period of stagnancy.
00:02:19.570 - 00:02:35.582, Speaker A: When you say they're looking to get involved, on what grounds are they looking to get involved? Is it this represents a better place for us to park money? Or is it, we've read this thing, we're interested in it, we don't know how. I'm curious how that conversation goes.
00:02:35.716 - 00:03:18.614, Speaker B: It's a combination of levels. So firstly, most people have done some VC, almost everybody has. And we've seen that in the flows because that's easy to get past your investment committee, because there's no mark to market. You're not having something on your balance sheet that nobody knows how to deal with. So we saw that and people are now like, okay, where do we go from here? So one of the things I've done is I've set up a fund of funds investing in crypto hedge funds. There's a lot of interest in that space. How do we get exposure? That's how people want to get exposure to DeFi as well, because it's an easier route to get a bunch of different hedge funds who run DeFi strategies to have a kind of diversified portfolio because people don't yet understand the risks.
00:03:18.614 - 00:03:43.540, Speaker B: And I think that's right. So they're looking at the secondary markets now. And realistically, if you look at the VC space, I mean, there's been tens of billions of dollars gone into VC, while if you look at the secondary market, I. E. The hedge fund market, there's been about a billion dollars of primary capital only and the whole space is about 6 billion. And that's mainly driven by performance. So there's a lot of institutional interest in that.
00:03:43.540 - 00:04:41.682, Speaker B: The banks and everybody else are looking at, okay, how do we service this market? How do we set up trading desks? What do we need to provide? The mega finance firms are thinking, okay, how do we further get into this market beyond? Just know people are looking at, I mean, I'm seeing people looking at DeFi separately to figure how can we get involved in the lending markets? Because these guys are super experienced. We've seen the launch of things like the new Brevan Howard, which is the mega hedge fund run by Alan Howard. They've just launched Brevin Howard digital. And that's a whole kind of soup to nuts organization. Know they've retooled a bunch of credit traders and brought them into DeFi because they understand the kind of risk cycles and stuff. They've brought a whole bunch of people into the space. So I just see that institutionalization of product which actually allows for new capital to come into the space, which was something that was needed, because a lot of people can't put bitcoin and ETH on their balance sheets.
00:04:41.682 - 00:04:46.166, Speaker B: It just doesn't work for them. So they're looking at, how do we get involved without doing that?
00:04:46.268 - 00:05:22.510, Speaker A: Yeah, there's been plenty of opportunities to plunge the knife in, and it's much easier to have this conversation when the market is up. Only Christopher Bloomstrand says one entertainment read the microstrategy recent ten Q and investor day presentation. These guys took an unleveraged 500 million dollar revenue, $500 million book value company earning 7% on equity to then borrow 2.1 billion, sell 900 million shares to purchase $3.2 billion worth of bitcoin. Michael Saylor is taking it in the face repeatedly right now, but how is the view over where you are? Is he looking like a fool or is he just kind of chilling and saying, who knows?
00:05:22.590 - 00:06:02.026, Speaker B: He's either one of the bravest corporate bets of all time, kind of like Masa does at Softbank from time to time, or it's going to go horribly wrong. My guess is he knows what he's doing. Michael's not a stupid guy. He really understands what he's doing, and I think the probability of it paying off remains pretty high. Now, does the market want to test his entry point, which is about 31,000 in bitcoin? Possibly. Markets like to do that kind of stuff, to kind of stress test people's positioning. I don't think anything really changes at that point, but I don't think many other people will follow suit just because it's so hard for accounting.
00:06:02.026 - 00:06:07.634, Speaker B: You've seen him fighting with the SEC over how you account for this stuff. It's just not easy for people to do.
00:06:07.752 - 00:06:23.574, Speaker A: Yeah. At the same time, it's all transparent. It's all there on the blockchain from our side. We love these moments in the market because they stress test lending protocols and in particular, the kind of hero ones. Camille, I wonder if you give us an insight into what was going on at maker this week.
00:06:23.692 - 00:07:24.922, Speaker C: Well, taking it a step back, just looking at liquidations in general, because this is a pretty kind of good stress test for DeFi. And I think the takeaway here is that DeFi just worked. At least DeFi on Ethereum can say the same for DeFi on other layer ones, but DeFi on Ethereum Dexes continued swapping tokens, lending and borrowing protocols. Liquidations happened, but they were pretty orderly. There weren't any catastrophic cascading liquidation moments at all. We have a story on the defiant out yesterday, very proud that it was the first story using our own proprietary defined terminal data, looking at liquidations. This is a chart you can't get anywhere else, so take a look.
00:07:24.922 - 00:07:50.942, Speaker C: And we're seeing liquidations from Ave Makerdao compound spiked, but only to the highest level since September. So pretty contained in kind of the context. So I think that's kind of one big takeaway in this big stress test defi is passing.
00:07:51.086 - 00:08:07.190, Speaker B: And we've done this twice now, right, because we did it in the summer, last summer. And these are sharp, big moves that in other financial markets would create problems, a broker going under, somebody somewhere. But this has been, again, super orderly and has worked really well.
00:08:07.340 - 00:08:38.740, Speaker C: Yeah. And it's surprising because I was kind of waiting to see what would happen in a moment like this. And we actually mentioned this in our interview, Robin. I was saying, I wonder what would happen this time around if there's a big test for Defi. Because the Defi ecosystem now is a lot different from where it was last year when there was this big sell off. It's gotten a lot more complex. There's a lot more lego pieces that need to fit together.
00:08:38.740 - 00:09:20.974, Speaker C: Everything is stacked up higher with just like, how interconnected the entire space is. So I would have thought there was a lot more room for something to go wrong like one of these pieces. Who said it yesterday, I'm not taking the credit for this. Somebody else on our team said it. There was a chance for money Legos to become money dominoes. Like, something goes wrong and everything else crashes. So that could have been expected given the level of interconnectedness that there is in Defi, but it just hasn't happened yet.
00:09:20.974 - 00:10:04.190, Speaker C: So I think that's one big takeaway. And then there were kind of some pretty intense situations, though, over the weekend. I think it was rune from Makerdao founder spotted this huge position that was about to get liquidated. And this is another just remarkable thing about DeFi. You see these positions out in the open. Like, everyone has access to maker Dow's books, so you can see these things unfolding as they happen. And it was like a 600 million position that was about to get liquidated.
00:10:04.190 - 00:10:30.790, Speaker C: So everyone got on Twitter trying to wake this person up who I guess their wallet's name was seven siblings for some reason. And so everyone was like, oh, my God, 600 million worth of ETH is going to get sold in the market. This is going to crash the price even further. At the very last minute, the person came in and topped up their collateral.
00:10:31.610 - 00:10:38.982, Speaker B: Who the hell are these people who have 600 million lying around, Chuck? At a few hundred million, who the hell are they?
00:10:39.116 - 00:10:42.462, Speaker C: I don't know. Who has 600 million in Makerdao?
00:10:42.626 - 00:11:28.210, Speaker A: Well, I think there's a broader story here, which is you're right, that these liquidations have happened previously, and maker notoriously had black Thursday, I think it was where things got really bad and dye fell off its peg, but it restored itself. The more that happens, the more confidence there is that it will restore itself. And so the participants in these ecosystems develop pretty thick skins. And I think, as you rightly say, people who have that much skin in the game are actually pretty resilient to this stuff. It's bizarre. What's interesting about all of this is that if you are at risk of liquidation on, say, binance or BitMex, they will email you and tell you, by the way, you're at risk of liquidation. That doesn't happen on maker.
00:11:28.210 - 00:12:27.062, Speaker A: We've been looking at a service called ePNs, which will. It's the Ethereum push notification service, and it will allow you to set up notifications for liquidation events like this. It's not there yet, and we're looking at ways to do that with news and everything else, but it ties into something else, which is wallet to wallet communication and using your ETH address as a method of connecting to you and contacting you. And we just had an app called block scan released yesterday, which allows you to do encrypted wallet to wallet messaging, which doesn't sound like that big a deal. But if everything is anonymous and you need to contact someone, knowing that there's this sort of weird back Channel that you can connect to, that your message will definitely be delivered, whether the other person reads or not, who knows? But it will definitely get to the person you are trying to reach. That's sort of unheard of in crypto. So these weird kind of mycelial network connections between people are starting to be formed that will allow things like these liquidations to be alerted earlier.
00:12:27.062 - 00:12:33.866, Speaker A: And it feels so upside down that we should have all of that. But in a decentralized world, that's actually very difficult to accomplish.
00:12:33.978 - 00:12:56.774, Speaker B: So here's a question for you that I've been trying to mull over, is these ETH addresses? Surely if you use that as your Twitter handle or whatever it is, and it's public, then somebody sends you an NFT, and you like that NFT, and you want to stick it in your ledger wallet or whatever, before you know it, you expose all of your wallets and everything that you own?
00:12:56.972 - 00:12:57.382, Speaker A: Yes.
00:12:57.436 - 00:12:59.480, Speaker B: It's kind of like, why would you do that?
00:13:00.330 - 00:13:05.494, Speaker A: Well, yeah, go ahead, Cammy. I have a take on this, but you go first.
00:13:05.612 - 00:13:44.930, Speaker C: Okay. No, I think the way people do this is you have your public wallet where you have your ens name attached to, and you're okay with people looking at that wallet. And it becomes kind of your online profile in the same way that your Facebook profile, you would have showcased kind of your best images and your photo albums and whatever your most witty takes on your Twitter profile, it becomes like your public facing Persona. So that's where you keep your nicest NFTs and so on. And then you have your other wallets.
00:13:45.270 - 00:13:51.926, Speaker B: But you can't connect them. You can't move it from your public wallet to your private wallet without everybody being able to just follow it.
00:13:52.028 - 00:14:12.326, Speaker C: There's an easy way to do it. You just send money to a centralized exchange, and then from the centralized exchange, you send it to a different wallet. So you never send funds directly from your doxed ETH account to your non doxed one. You have the centralized exchange in between to kind of as a buffer.
00:14:12.358 - 00:14:15.680, Speaker B: Yeah, but if you've got an NFT, you can't do that. Or can you still?
00:14:16.210 - 00:14:21.406, Speaker A: I think you can. There isn't a tornado cash for NFTs that I know of at the moment. And it's interesting you bring up this.
00:14:21.428 - 00:14:23.758, Speaker C: Point because maybe for NFTs it doesn't work.
00:14:23.844 - 00:14:56.970, Speaker A: The NFT community has been in a process of kind of self policing, I think, the last couple of weeks, and deliberately looking to weed out bad actors. Some things have come to light. There's a Twitter account called NFT ethics that has unmasked Beanie, or Charles Moscow, as he is apparently known, who seems to have been engaged in a number of things that could be questionable, let's put it that way. Let's be diplomatic about it. And all of it was traced via his NFTs. And yeah, it's very, very difficult to hide your tracks. But on the flip side, it's a reputational thing.
00:14:56.970 - 00:16:07.522, Speaker A: If you're a politician and you lean one way, you could use a wallet and the history of transactions that you have as a way of guaranteeing legitimacy or at least a commitment to an ecosystem, which I think is fair. What we're starting to see is there are certain projects like the ENS Airdrop, that will give you rewards based on your participation. And so if you participate, if you're a part of the community, then you get rewarded for it. Whether those rewards are commensurate with the amount you put in, I don't know. But at the same time, if you're smart enough and you do participate and it's actually a daily habit to participate, then it's not a thing anyway. So I think in terms of the way I use it, I feel it's important for us at the defiant to at least try and be open and acknowledge the fact that it would be very easy to abuse the position that we're in to trade against the market or to do some insider trading like Nate did at, you know, just putting everything out in the open and just being transparent about it, it's the first thing we should be doing. And so those ETH addresses, they just sit there and that is what they are.
00:16:07.522 - 00:16:09.314, Speaker A: And I've had people, if I asked.
00:16:09.352 - 00:16:17.186, Speaker B: You to show me your bank account, you'd say, fuck off. It's that I like the idea of the.
00:16:17.288 - 00:16:18.078, Speaker A: I actually will.
00:16:18.184 - 00:16:20.006, Speaker B: I think it's pretty important, but I.
00:16:20.028 - 00:16:21.762, Speaker A: Wouldn'T because I got nothing to hide.
00:16:21.906 - 00:16:25.160, Speaker B: No, it's not about something to hide. It's just a personal thing. Right.
00:16:26.890 - 00:16:29.640, Speaker A: I don't really care, though, to be honest with you.
00:16:30.650 - 00:16:50.110, Speaker C: Right. I think you don't care, but it's legitimate to want to keep that information private. And I think there's ways to do that. There's ways to have your private wallets that you keep guarded off the public eye and then you have just like public ETH addresses that are your online profile.
00:16:50.930 - 00:17:13.554, Speaker A: You know what I say to this? First world problems. Deal with it. If you've got something that's that valuable, go sell it. Have your, you know. And we're talking about NFTs here. A canadian journalist called Dan Olsen published a two and a quarter hour film crapping all over NFTs last week. And it's got two and a half million views.
00:17:13.554 - 00:17:36.538, Speaker A: This thing is immense. And as someone who's made very long films about NFTs, I kind of respect this in a way. And I think it's important that we have these contrarian views. Nurabini has been out in force telling everyone that bitcoin is a Ponzi and a scam and a barbell and like the Mississippi barbell and the tulip barbell. God, I love Rubini. He's the best. Pure panto Cammie.
00:17:36.538 - 00:17:38.014, Speaker A: Did you see this one from down?
00:17:38.052 - 00:17:39.840, Speaker C: No, I didn't. Did you see it?
00:17:40.850 - 00:17:45.346, Speaker A: I tried to watch like ten minutes of it and then I got bored because he's quite hard to watch if.
00:17:45.368 - 00:17:53.778, Speaker C: You had watched it. Apparently he has, like, five minutes straight shitting on me and my book.
00:17:53.944 - 00:17:55.060, Speaker A: Oh, awesome.
00:17:58.150 - 00:18:07.366, Speaker C: I feel like you can't really make it unless you have someone who's put in the time to actually kind of criticize you. Calling me a failed journalist and all.
00:18:07.388 - 00:18:09.286, Speaker B: This stuff, I take that as flattery.
00:18:09.398 - 00:18:21.226, Speaker C: Right? Yeah. I haven't actually watched it, but a couple of people kind of tagged me and were like, why is he going on about Cammie's book anyway?
00:18:21.328 - 00:18:49.654, Speaker A: Well, I find these remote commentators are very happy to publish within the circle of themselves, but if you ask them to come and have a debate with you, they're not interested. Ral, I actually found you on Cointelegraph. Here's the headline. Wait, what? Former bitcoin bull, Ral Paul only owns one bitcoin. Greg, explain what happened there.
00:18:49.772 - 00:19:25.054, Speaker B: I got so much hatred for that, but it's hilarious. It's just like, as I've been talking about for a long time, I think bitcoin underperforms some of these others. And over time, I just get tired of the bitcoin, the hardcore bitcoin community, and they prove it time and time again. By I explained that network effects is actually about encouraging people onto the network and not attacking them when they don't agree with you. And then. So when I then say, well, I've actually only got one bitcoin because I feel like I should have a stake in it, but I don't feel like it's where I want to be or what's the best use of my money. Oh, my God.
00:19:25.054 - 00:19:39.350, Speaker B: Everybody freaks out again. And then they dredge up the fact that I bought a bunch of ETH call options that are going to expire worthless. And now I'm exposed as a scam and a fraud because I lost money in an option trade. It's hilarious.
00:19:41.450 - 00:19:46.198, Speaker C: Patience. Patience is a virtue, but I think.
00:19:46.204 - 00:20:02.958, Speaker A: It'S worth kind of trying to understand where this comes from. Is it fear? Is it abandonment issues? Because it's very easy to dismiss people when they feel this way and everyone's emotional, but I want to understand why. And then I actually want to kind of undermine that and rewind and not fight, but try.
00:20:02.964 - 00:20:56.654, Speaker B: And I did this once before. I got thrown into anti climate change Twitter a few years ago. And all of these people, I was arguing with them saying, well, why would you not take Pascal's dilemma and suggest, well, if the downside is catastrophic, then the worst you're going to do is maintain the status quo by trying to save the planet? And whatever. But people were really arguing. So I took some people off aside in conversations and I said I was trying to find out, why are you so anti this? Because it didn't really make that much rational sense. And the answer was, basically, I'm worried you're going to raise gas prices or taxes on gasoline. So what it actually was, was a reflection of poverty and lack of opportunity set, particularly the middle of America got gutted out over the last 30 years, and it was a representation of that.
00:20:56.654 - 00:21:26.966, Speaker B: And I think it's somewhat the same in crypto. There's a bunch of people that kind of have fun, stay poor crowd, who are really. This is their bet, this is their thing. This is their thing that could save them. And they don't have a lot because you don't get it from the whales in bitcoin. They're not like that at all. So it's the small holders who think that this is their chance to escape the trap, and they will want to defend the network at all costs and their position, because they've self identified as this.
00:21:26.966 - 00:22:10.130, Speaker B: So I think you're right in the question is why. It's a much more emotive level. There are also some know, we had an interview, Ash did an interview with somebody who had invested in BSV, and, oh, my God, we got attacked on Twitter. I'm like, really? You can have an open conversation. You might still think Craig Wright is the Antichrist, that's fine. But some guys who are investing in this and they want to put their case across, we should be able to have those conversations, but you can't. And that was all about that forking and the psychological fear of that community splitting twice back in 2017.
00:22:10.130 - 00:22:13.078, Speaker B: So it's. Right. It's all emotional scarring. I think.
00:22:13.164 - 00:22:52.130, Speaker A: Yeah, there's something interesting with Ethereum. They're what we kind of playfully refer to as ETH maxis. And generally, if you unpack it, it boils down to, ETH is the most decentralized non bitcoin chain. Therefore, ETH is the truth, because ETH is decentralized. So it's promoting this idea of decentralization. And so anything that isn't ETH is wrong. And that is so painfully off piece for me, because I think with Defi, what you're trying to do is promote the most kind of approachable, inclusive version of finance that we can.
00:22:52.130 - 00:23:13.178, Speaker A: And anything on Ethereum inherently is not that. It's just too expensive, it's prohibitive. And so you can't, in one sentence, say, ETH is for everybody and then say, well, you can't afford it at the same time. But that is where most people are at. So that's where ETH maximalism falls down. It's not even about decentralization. It's just like entry point access.
00:23:13.178 - 00:23:19.610, Speaker A: It's for an elite. And the people that was meant to serve are now priced out, and that's a fact.
00:23:19.760 - 00:23:55.506, Speaker B: And also to argue that everything is all about ultimate decentralization is kind of missing the point, because most people don't care. Now, when you're arguing that it's from a philosophical standpoint that that's how you think it should be, but people have proven time and time again they will take the trade off of time or cost versus decentralization, and that's okay. And that's why the rest of the space, the layer ones, have grown so fast. It's because people will take that trade off. And decentralization is not the everything. Everything is relatively decentralized, but not totally decentralized.
00:23:55.618 - 00:25:01.966, Speaker C: I have two takes here on whether everything should be decentralized, but also I wanted to add something on maximalism. So for me, bitcoin maximalism, I kind of get it why some people become bitcoin maximalist, because from what I understand talking with some of these people from their worldview, the end goal is to replace, they actually want to replace the dollar with bitcoin. They want bitcoin to become the digital global currency. And in that world, there's no space for anything else. That is the base layer of money, that is the global reserve currency. That's where the financial system is being built on. So if ETH starts to gain traction and people start using it as a means of exchange, that comes in direct competition to what their worldview is.
00:25:01.966 - 00:25:59.680, Speaker C: So if you have this worldview that bitcoin is everything, and you believe this because bitcoin was the first and the best, and it's so pure and it's sound money and all this kind of view on things, you believe, like this is the right path forward and the only path forward. So that's why this kind of competitive fear kicks in when they see Ethereum or others gaining traction. It's like literally a battle of survival for bitcoin. Because the end goal of bitcoin is becoming everything. And if it doesn't, then it fails. So it is like a survival instinct that kicks in like, okay, no, you can't take what is ours. So I kind of get that from bitcoin maximalists, but from Ethereum, Maxis, I don't get that at all.
00:25:59.680 - 00:26:58.002, Speaker C: If you like Ethereum, and I like ethereum. The way that Ethereum wins is becoming a base layer for decentralized applications. There's like nowhere in the vision or narrative or anything that says that this should be the only layer for decentralized applications. I think it can be a great layer for maybe the most secure applications, for maybe those use cases that really require that level of decentralization and security where you're okay with spending a couple of transaction because you're transacting millions or billions of dollars on top of that. And it makes sense. All of that, I think makes sense. But yeah, like Robin said, or like you both have said, it's like some people are being priced out of this most secure layer one.
00:26:58.002 - 00:27:12.120, Speaker C: So who cares if they want to go somewhere else and just play some play to earn game for cheaper, they should be able to. Why that kind of competitive fear on the Ethereum side?
00:27:13.850 - 00:27:44.930, Speaker B: Because it depends what your worldview is, and I think we probably all share the same worldview, is we want this Internet of value layer to be available to everybody, full stop. So however that morphs and however that changes and whatever permutations and combinations of different protocols and different layers is fine because that's what we really want, because that is still decentralized at a broader level. And it's not just down to single protocol. So I guess it depends on worldviews.
00:27:45.830 - 00:28:28.606, Speaker A: It does. The essential definition of web three, as Gavin Wood expressed it, was in sort of direct response to Snowden, and it was, we cannot fundamentally trust big data, big organizations and governments to look after our data properly. So web three is an attempt to carve out a system or an idea or an identity for a world in which we don't have to. It's not that we can or we can't, it's that we don't have to. And somehow all of that gets lost in all the politicizing and everything else. And I think Ethereum is unfortunately sort of caught in the best of both worlds. It's both fantastic and also deeply flawed at the same time.
00:28:28.606 - 00:28:54.280, Speaker A: And its flaws are what has created this insecurity about its future as a relevant chain in everything. And of course, Ethereum is never going to go away. What was interesting this week was the great renaming of ETH two e two is no more when it passes, the felix of spiritual Santos. Amen. Cammie, the sequel to the Infinite Machine. You're going to have to rename it because these two gone away.
00:28:54.890 - 00:28:55.574, Speaker B: What is it?
00:28:55.612 - 00:28:56.726, Speaker A: Explain this one.
00:28:56.908 - 00:28:59.260, Speaker B: Yeah, I missed this story.
00:28:59.870 - 00:30:08.234, Speaker C: It's something that's been happening for a while, at least since. For a while, in crypto terms, since kind of maybe November last year. Yeah, but Dave, as in kind of ethereum foundation, have been wanting to change the narrative a little bit from ETH one and ETH two to Ethereum consensus layer and ethereum application layer or execution layer. So I think the idea is that the reason behind this is because the end chain, where there's proof of stake consensus protocol and the application layer on top, that is ethereum. And in the e one, e two narrative, that would have been called e two. So I think in the same way that when Ethereum forked, the new chain was also called ethereum, the old chain was called ethereum. Classic Ethereum just wants the latest iteration of the protocol to be ethereum.
00:30:08.234 - 00:30:56.814, Speaker C: So I think that's kind of what this is about. So it's like right now, there's kind of the proof of stake consensus layer that is the proof of stake chain that's already working. And then there is the execution layer, like the application layer that's happening on the current ethereum chain that we are all kind of using right now, which at the moment sits on top of our proof of work consensus layer. But in the coming months, there's supposed to be a merge between the current execution layer and the proof of stake consensus layer, and that will become ethereum instead of e two.
00:30:56.932 - 00:31:30.538, Speaker A: So I can pick this one up a little bit, because the architecture of E 2.0, as it was, is quite similar to what we had at harmony, which is it's sharded. And shards are essentially like little mini, standalone blockchains that sit within a larger blockchain ecosystem. But there's one main chain called a beacon chain, and this is where everything gets filed into, and that's where all the messages are finally committed. So ETH one, as we know it now, is that beacon chain. And it's actually very straightforward for them to implement that beacon chain. The shards that sit on top of it or sit alongside it are actually quite difficult.
00:31:30.538 - 00:32:10.774, Speaker A: And one of the things that you understand when you start working on shards is that individually, they're quite robust. But communication between shards is very, very complicated. And particularly with things like Defi. The danger with shards is that what you will find is that all the money Legos that we know now will cluster on the same shard. So you will lose all the benefits of being sharded, which is you have data distributed all over the place, which makes it a lot faster because the intercommunication is so difficult between shards. And this idea of distributed networking and distributed consensus is. It sounds easy.
00:32:10.774 - 00:32:25.610, Speaker A: It's really not. It's really not. So you will find that everyone wants to be on the beacon chain. They want to be there because that's where all the action is. But actually, the fastest transactions will be on shard. One, two, three. And I think with Ethereum, they're talking about 50, 60 shards.
00:32:25.610 - 00:32:48.830, Speaker A: The communication overhead on that is going to be utterly insane. And I don't think anybody quite realizes quite how complicated sharding actually is. Of course, it's amazing, but very, very difficult. So this ETH one chain is going to be the beacon chain, and it's going to kind of move up and be this thing. And that's why they don't want ETH 2.0 anymore, because they need to merge these things together. They need to move to proof of stake.
00:32:48.830 - 00:32:52.274, Speaker A: But calling E 2.0 is a misnomer because it's not E 2.0.
00:32:52.312 - 00:32:53.470, Speaker C: It's just Ethereum.
00:32:53.550 - 00:32:54.286, Speaker A: It's just Ethereum.
00:32:54.318 - 00:32:55.758, Speaker B: It's just an upgraded ethereum.
00:32:55.854 - 00:32:56.402, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:56.536 - 00:33:12.346, Speaker A: Yes. It's not like it's insignificant. It sets expectations in the wrong place. And I've seen various kind of comments about this. Those who want it to be called E 2.0 want ETH pamp. And those who actually understand what's going on understand that it's nothing to do with that.
00:33:12.346 - 00:33:53.730, Speaker A: It's not even a rebrand. It's just realism. This is a really tough engineering challenge, and it will represent things, and it will just bring up things that we've never even seen before at scale, and it'll break all the time, and everyone will get really angry. And I can't wait. As per usual, I had a fantastic chat with Andrew Kanye from yern finance, who's a big kind of engineer on the phantom network, just talking about how much crap phantom has had over the years. And Phantom is having an amazing time right now. They're really proving their worth as a layer know vaulting above avalanche that everyone thought was this amazing engineering marvel.
00:33:53.730 - 00:34:10.918, Speaker A: It just goes to show that if there's a great developer and he has the tenacity to stick with a chain for a prolonged period of time, then that chain can thrive and. Fascinating story, that one. I love Andre. He's just fresh and honest, and it's rare. Very, very rare.
00:34:11.014 - 00:34:20.538, Speaker C: Yeah. Can we check it out? I think we'll have it up on the channel soon. So. Yeah, we want you to go watch this Andre interview.
00:34:20.714 - 00:34:22.000, Speaker B: Yeah, look forward to.
00:34:23.010 - 00:34:28.370, Speaker A: So it's probably a good moment to wrap it up. I don't know if Raoul, you've got anything else that you want to air publicly?
00:34:29.190 - 00:34:30.980, Speaker B: Nothing that I could admit to.
00:34:31.990 - 00:34:41.170, Speaker A: I've got a question for you. Were you present at Boris Johnson's birthday party? Because rumor has it you had a slice of cake, but you didn't inhale.
00:34:41.330 - 00:34:43.880, Speaker B: I'm not at liberty to confirm or deny anything.
00:34:45.290 - 00:34:52.806, Speaker A: British politics is so lame. Cammie, any final words on any further news on Infinite machine?
00:34:52.838 - 00:34:53.158, Speaker B: The movie?
00:34:53.174 - 00:34:54.250, Speaker A: The NFT project?
00:34:54.400 - 00:35:21.966, Speaker C: The project is coming along. I really hope to have some big news to share soon. But TBD on that, we still have to announce our third and final sale. But go check these NFts out on Opensea. It's the infinite machine movie collection. Yeah, they're just like beautiful NFTs. And talk about Ethereum.
00:35:21.966 - 00:35:33.106, Speaker C: They really kind of celebrate Ethereum. Like just lots of colorful, diverse. This explosion of Ethereum logos and Canadian.
00:35:33.138 - 00:35:59.578, Speaker A: YouTuber Dan Olsen is apparently not a fan. So if you need a greater reason to buy, then go. NFTs have actually been on a massive boom in January. I seem to remember 2018 February ICOs just went berserk. So I'm curious to see whether this NFT boom is simply money needs to go somewhere. It's now buying NFTs, but I am seeing some really interesting things happening. Some rumors around Clonex and Justin Bieber and Nike.
00:35:59.578 - 00:36:16.322, Speaker A: Apes have reportedly been valued at something absurd, like 5 billion. As they prepare to launch their token, there's just a bunch of stuff happening in NFTs that I'm like, are they uncorrelated? I don't even know anymore, but I'm still guts deep in all of this stuff and having the best time.
00:36:16.376 - 00:36:26.022, Speaker B: Yeah, that ape social token. I'm really interested in seeing how that works because that's going to be a big unlock for another whole phase, I'm telling you.
00:36:26.076 - 00:36:33.994, Speaker A: Like pop culture insertion, pop culture relevance. It is literally the lubricants that will allow the great iron wash to come in their numbers.
00:36:34.112 - 00:36:37.514, Speaker B: Culture is an investment now. And that's something I've been talking about.
00:36:37.632 - 00:37:00.110, Speaker A: And I'll tell you what, you cannot make a better investment in culture than watching this trio of unholy people come together again next week. We won't have you, Ral. I know we get you like, doing anything fantastic. Well, thanks so much for joining us and thanks, Camille, as always. Thanks, Raoul. And we will see you next week for another edition of this, whatever this was.
00:37:00.180 - 00:37:00.734, Speaker B: This was real.
00:37:00.772 - 00:37:02.860, Speaker A: Vision versus the defiant. See you next time.
