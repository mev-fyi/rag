00:00:00.170 - 00:00:19.182, Speaker A: Welcome back to another Monday quick take. It's Alp Gasmov here, and I'll be taking over the quick take for the next few weeks, so it's a good day for the defined, but also for bitcoin. It's been a minute since we've seen six green candles in a row. Everyone's bullish up. Only feels good, doesn't it? But you know what else feels good? Earning 12% interest on your idle assets. That's right.
00:00:19.236 - 00:00:54.562, Speaker B: With the fast paced nature of the crypto industry, more and more wealth building platforms are entering the market. So it's only natural can be confused about who to trust and where to hold your assets. That's why we're introducing Nexo, the world's leading digital assets institution. Being one of the safest options out there, Nexo fully protects and ensures your assets for up to $375,000,000. You can buy crypto directly on the web platform or mobile app and start earning up to 12% interest on your idle assets. They also allow you to borrow against your crypto from 6.9% APR and the best thing is your credit line becomes instantly available with no credit checks.
00:00:54.562 - 00:01:09.230, Speaker B: You can even buy, sell and swap 100 or so crypto and fiat pairs with zero price fluctuations. So if you're looking for a place where you can maximize the power of your crypto while having all of your assets insured, then check them out by visiting nexo IO.
00:01:09.310 - 00:01:46.474, Speaker A: So last week, uniswap tweeted this, which at first seems counterintuitive, since Defi's purpose is to be permissionless, immutable, et cetera, et cetera. But here's the thing. Common misconception is that uniswap delisted a number of assets from trading. No, uniswap only removed some assets from their interface. Users can still trade the removed assets via contracts, decentralized interfaces, or aggregators. The list of 129 tokens show that the protocols most affected by the censorship were synthetics, open Uma, mirror and tether, which mostly consist of tokenized stocks and derivatives. But again, there are other many ways to trade the removed assets.
00:01:46.474 - 00:02:16.422, Speaker A: So nothing too big to worry about, I think. But let's back up a moment. Why did uniswap do this? Uniswap's announcement came days after US regulators announcement that they would increasingly scrutinize such products, so the censorship is rather a reaction to the evolving regulatory landscape. Now have a look at this whale. It's an eight bit blue pixel whale vector stock image that's available for enhanced license at $530. Isn't it the perfect candidate for a generative NFT series? That's what twelve year old Benjamin Ahmed thought. So too.
00:02:16.422 - 00:02:54.702, Speaker A: Benjamin created a series titled Weird Whales, a collection of 3350 whale themed NFTs which sold out within 9 hours of its release, totaling a sale of 80 E, which is around $160,000 at the time of the sale. Not a bad return on the license he paid for the original stock image at all. According to the article by decrypt, Bainuman plans to hoddle his earnings. So the art itself is basically a copy pasta. But what stands out here is the creator behind the art, a young boy from England with a passion for coding. Maybe sometimes that's all you need to make $160,000 in 9 hours. Another headline from last week was the divorce between finance and FTX.
00:02:54.702 - 00:03:37.034, Speaker A: Binance had announced a strategic equity investment in FTX in 2019, which is now ending, with CZ portraying the exit as part of an investment cycle. Although the reason behind the divorce remains partially unclear. The breakup came right after FTX had raised $900 million in the largest ever funding round for a crypto exchange. And it's no secret that Binance is under scrutiny with UK restrictions and US regulators while FTX continues to strengthen their US presence. So is this the beginning of a shift of powers between the big exchange powerhouses as they prepare to cement their bases? Time will tell. That's it for today.

00:03:37.034 - 00:03:37.610, Speaker A: See ya.
