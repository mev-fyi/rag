00:00:00.240 - 00:00:04.414, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. I got here, to be honest. Okay. It's really hurting for me. Okay. I'll be hurt.
00:00:04.534 - 00:00:04.990, Speaker B: All right.
00:00:05.062 - 00:00:10.142, Speaker A: I'll be hurt. Okay. I'm actually a little bit hurt. Okay. I'm actually a little bit sad. And it's not just hurting me, hurting my community.
00:00:10.238 - 00:00:10.758, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:10.886 - 00:00:18.046, Speaker A: Because, guys, you've been working on this for. We have been working on over years. You can shit on everything you want. Lots of people have said many times that Jupyter is one of the best products in Defi.
00:00:18.110 - 00:00:18.286, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:18.310 - 00:00:19.310, Speaker A: You know, and I use it every day.
00:00:19.342 - 00:00:19.630, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:19.702 - 00:00:24.558, Speaker A: So it's like, to, like, completely neglect that. That years of work we put into it.
00:00:24.646 - 00:00:25.038, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:25.126 - 00:00:27.782, Speaker A: And focus on things. That is kind of misunderstood.
00:00:27.878 - 00:00:28.278, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:28.366 - 00:00:34.750, Speaker A: I don't think that's fair. But unfortunately, that's actually where, like, the merger attention is. It's not just hurting me, it's hurting my whole community.
00:00:34.822 - 00:00:35.006, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:35.030 - 00:00:36.078, Speaker A: And hurting my whole team.
00:00:36.206 - 00:00:36.518, Speaker B: Right.
00:00:36.566 - 00:00:40.674, Speaker A: You know? So that's actually where a lot of the. A lot of my frustration comes from. Yeah.
00:00:45.774 - 00:01:56.124, Speaker C: Today we're chatting with Miao. Meow is the founder of Jupyterswap, which is, which is one of the biggest dexs on Solana. And it's also one of the biggest talking points among many crypto communities on crypto Twitter due to its recent controversial sort of airdrop mechanism that they deployed. Typically, Twitter is the home for generating FUD for coins that you miss the opportunity out on. But in the case of Jupiter, I feel like it was, things were slightly different because influencers with large followings attacked Jupiter and its founder with outright misinformation. That was sort of my takeaway from this conversation with Meow. So in today's interview, we address all the misinformation, the controversy, learn what he would do different if he would go back in time, the improvements that we can expect in the upcoming airdrop and the future of LFG Jupiter and his thoughts on Solana.
00:01:56.124 - 00:02:20.768, Speaker C: But my main takeaway from Meow as, like, a founder and a personality in the crypto space is that he's sort of like this outlier who's not afraid to voice his unique opinions, and he's a person that says the quiet part out loud. What does Ivan think? Ivan, what was your takeaway from today's interview?
00:02:20.936 - 00:02:46.032, Speaker D: Hello, everybody. ALP with me today. As always, ALp is the head of videos that defined a video magician and an expert when it comes to everything per hand. Anyway, we have indeed the founder of Jupiter today, Alpsat. And me coming into this, I was totally unprepared for two reasons. One of them me being lazy. Second one, I actually have a job, a wagecock like many of you.
00:02:46.032 - 00:03:23.400, Speaker D: And the third one is, I am not Solana native. So to me, to get to the deep things of some of the projects takes a while. And that's what happened. We read some of the highlights and some of the headlines on the Twitter influencer posts, and it turned out, at least the way we understood it after this interview, is that it wasn't just misleading, it was plain fucking wrong. Like really, really wrong. Again, we'll do our due diligence again later, and you can do so as well. And you should comment about whether the things Miao said were true or not, but at least the perception I have of meow from this call is actually very positive.
00:03:23.400 - 00:04:27.154, Speaker D: As Alps said, seems like an outlier is not afraid to speak out those things. Whether that is a good quality for a founder and not being a narrative suck up as to say all the time is a good or a bad thing, I guess that's up to everybody subjectively to judge. But the conversation, as you can see, at some point got heated up quite fast. And that was a great thing because we managed to have like a person to person conversation rather than a usual podcast where it's like, sir, what does your token do? Sir, what is the next stage of your project? Who the fuck cares? Or rather, we all care, and it is very easy to read, but it's just very boring to listen to. So hopefully after ALP edits, you will get some conversation and information that is more distilled. How do you say it? Actually, the conversation that is more real and more human. Things like when it comes to a founder's life, how you should be able to take the punches and how you should commemorate and pay respects to the investors and community that you had, let's say, from the previous days.
00:04:27.154 - 00:05:00.970, Speaker D: That's at the end. So end of the day overall ended up being quite an interesting one. I feel like very lively, very heated. Some of the fact checking is up to you to do. We will do our own. But again, the stigma that was out there on the founder, on himself, and on the project seems to have been largely overblown. Coming into this, I only really somewhat, to an extent, deeply researched the part about the token launch model and me being not a geek, because I'm moronic.
00:05:00.970 - 00:05:40.534, Speaker D: More so me being interested in all things, tokens, launches and all of that other gamification stuff that actually seemed to me like a pretty strong, interesting model to be done, which allows you to make a lot of money, but also comes with a big risk from the team side. And. Yeah, anyway, that's what the interview is about. You can learn about the launch, the controversies, the heated arguments, learnings as a founder, and how to get over these stages when it comes to hype and fun. But before all of that stuff, let's start by hearing an introduction from Myau about how he got to Solana, what was his history in building, and how he got started with Jupiter in the first place.
00:05:40.694 - 00:05:43.838, Speaker C: Hey, Miao. It's great to have you here. Thank you for joining the show.
00:05:43.966 - 00:05:45.598, Speaker A: Hello. Nice to meet you guys.
00:05:45.766 - 00:06:05.494, Speaker C: Nice to meet you, too. So let's kick it off. Meow. We all know you as meow. I couldn't find much information on you besides, like, your official website, so I'd love to get started with maybe an introduction to who you are, what you're doing and what led you to building Jupiter.
00:06:05.954 - 00:06:19.750, Speaker A: I guess I got started in crypto about a few years ago. I think since then, I've done a lot of things. I think I actually did quite a number of things in Ethereum as well. We started with Kyber instead and then built WPTC.
00:06:19.922 - 00:06:20.206, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:20.230 - 00:06:32.726, Speaker A: You know, as well, and also was also advisor to portfolio, which was one of the largest portfolio apps. Yeah, I think. And been working on working the Solana ecosystem for about three years now.
00:06:32.910 - 00:06:33.302, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:33.358 - 00:06:36.222, Speaker A: You know, started with a different project and then we started Jupiter.
00:06:36.358 - 00:06:36.606, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:36.630 - 00:06:39.830, Speaker A: You know, yeah. And then. Yeah. So, you know, been a while. Yeah.
00:06:39.902 - 00:06:51.558, Speaker D: What initially brought you to Solana, then? Because you said you were so core in Ethereum before we maybe even chatted through alternative accounts at some point in time then, because I didn't know you were so back deep in Ethereum. But what made you switch at first?
00:06:51.646 - 00:06:53.822, Speaker A: I mean, I don't consider switching.
00:06:53.878 - 00:06:54.094, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:54.134 - 00:07:12.110, Speaker A: You know, I think I consider it, like, because for me, I've always believed in the multi chain world, right. So, you know, I mean, the part of the reason why I did WTC was that, okay, I wanted to, you know, we were very. We were very, very serious about saying that, hey, how do we kind of, like, make BTC as usable in Ethereum as possible?
00:07:12.222 - 00:07:12.710, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:12.822 - 00:08:01.224, Speaker A: So I feel like. And since then, I've also been working on a lot of multi chain things. So, yeah, I think it's not so much that I switched, I don't think of it switching it to Solana, but more like, hey, it's a multi chain world. How do I gain experience in a completely different stack and ecosystem? Because as we all know the EVM stack is very well established, and then it has its own quotes, its own mechanisms, and then with the l one, l two. Also, obviously the whole EVM is an extremely well set up and extremely researched community. So I think part of it is also the desire to explore new grounds, to go into an ecosystem that's a lot more newer, a tech stack that's a lot more unproven. So that's how the appeal for me, I guess.
00:08:01.224 - 00:08:13.358, Speaker A: I also think that in doing so, I think it will also really help me get a better view of the whole landscape, more so than just staying in one place. So that was actually part of the core motivation. Actually.
00:08:13.476 - 00:08:27.254, Speaker C: It's been a few years you've been building in Solana, and then you've advised a number of well known projects associated with Ethereum. What does life look like before crypto for Meow? What were you doing before you entered crypto?
00:08:27.554 - 00:08:50.101, Speaker A: I was actually in the valley for a number of years. I started a few projects in the valley and also worked for some pretty prominent projects in the valley as well. I was looking a lot in tech and product and growth. Yeah, so I would say that like, I would say that like, yeah, I would say that like, it's actually a very relevant background, you know, for crypto.
00:08:50.197 - 00:09:41.084, Speaker C: It's been nearly a couple of weeks since one of the recently most like, anticipated airdrops happened in crypto. It's among the 10th largest airdrops in crypto history, with early adopters receiving more than $700 million worth of Jupiter, if I'm not mistaken. And I'd like to get your thoughts on like, on this token in general, because like, you've been quite vocal and like a prominent voice of like, token utility being a myth, token utility having being the greatest distraction and value destroyer ever. So that being said, I'm just curious to hear your thoughts around why would I hold the Jup token when the founder of this project says such things like what is, what is from a token holder perspective, what's the value of holding Jup in this context?
00:09:41.204 - 00:10:29.866, Speaker A: I mean, I think if you look at a lot of the Ethereum projects, right, I mean, that's not what you talk about, Ethereum projects, right? If you talk about Ethereum projects, I feel like they have managed to hold value just totally fine, you know, like being a governance token as well. And I feel like, so that is actually one of the main contexts, right, of this conversation as well. So I think that's actually one big reason. So I think actually, what's actually really more important for Jupyter at this point is to grow as a project is to continue being like it's to continue being seen as one of the best products in DeFi, is to continue growing the user base. And actually, I think that's actually way more important than emphasizing on quote unquote token utility. Yeah. So that's my honest feedback.
00:10:29.866 - 00:10:57.244, Speaker A: I feel like what I said is quite simple. I think that there's actually a lot of value in governance tokens and the token representing a project. Now if you don't believe that statement, then Uniswap should be zero. If the statement that a project, if your statement that a token doesn't hold any value as a representative government as a project, then many, many tokens in the crypto will be zero.
00:10:57.404 - 00:11:02.984, Speaker C: Yes. So if you have no holders, then you have no value. Basically.
00:11:04.644 - 00:11:34.644, Speaker A: No. Think about it. I mean, think about is weird, right? It's like what I'm saying is quite simple. I'm saying that like certain, for certain tokens, right? Utility is a key message, right? You know that Jupyter is not right. Jupyter didn't start by saying, hey, you know what we are utility, token buy us for utility. We didn't say that, right. In many ways we're more similar to Uniswap or by saying, hey, you know what we are here, we are governors, we represent this project.
00:11:34.644 - 00:11:58.424, Speaker A: That is where our value comes from. Initially, if you throw my exact statements now, what I say is this. I didn't say no to community. I said right now it's not a time, because we are still a new project, we're just birthed. And then I feel like the main thing right now is to really consider the community, consider the product, consider the brand, and really grow the project. Yeah. So that's actually what I think is really important.
00:11:58.424 - 00:12:02.900, Speaker A: And I think the reason why I say token utility is a myth.
00:12:02.932 - 00:12:03.100, Speaker B: Right?
00:12:03.132 - 00:12:37.036, Speaker A: Just simple. I feel like there's such intense pressure from the community, especially crypto Twitter, to force the narrative, including from you. You're forcing a narrative of saying, hey, let tokens mass have ut their value. And then what happens to this project? Many projects, what they do instead is rush to implement some kind of utility, some kind of thing to justify token value. And what it does is that it actually destroys our value. So that's what I believe. So I think, again, what I believe very strongly is this.
00:12:37.036 - 00:13:35.246, Speaker A: Now for this current phase of Jupyter, the most important thing right now is to establish Jupiter as a brand, a token and a symbol, and then following which we grow together, we establish a community and then we can actually figure out the true Utility together. So that's actually what I think. So I think one of the things that I've been very, very clear on as well, on Reddit as well, and on many messages as well, is that right now it's different phases. Right now, Jupyter is just a beginning project and we have seen from many, many, many other examples that governance and Symbolic has value. The main thing right now is to build up, establish that first, to stay the ground first. Actually, one of the things that I did say is let us ten X first, let's grow our user base like Crazy first. Because when we grow our user base and our product set like crazy, that's actually when I think that's actually where I think the idea of token utility becomes meaningful when it comes to the valuation.
00:13:35.246 - 00:14:12.272, Speaker A: So that's how I think about it. So I think, in summary, I think token Utility is a very divisive topic. In crypto you have many, many tokens, you have many projects, including many outside Ethereum world that really hangs on to the idea of governance as the main utility, many that argue that without some kind of mechanism there's no point in the token. I think both sides have. So I think, in summary, I feel like, I apologize if I come across as being too one sided in my view.
00:14:12.378 - 00:14:12.644, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:12.684 - 00:14:24.948, Speaker A: You know, but it's a good time for, it's a good time for me to crush interview. That to me is, to me that is like, it's not, it is not a binary thing, you know, in fact it's a process.
00:14:25.076 - 00:14:25.388, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:25.436 - 00:14:36.772, Speaker A: You know, I think, and for us, I think at this current stage I believe very strongly that windows, we need to start off with the, in a very simple way, right? And then as you go along, as you grow the project, then I feel like we can actually consider more things.
00:14:36.868 - 00:15:06.364, Speaker D: Makes sense. Makes sense. Thank you. Yeah. So if I may rephrase you, it's somewhat similar to what Andre Croni used to say back in the days because he was also fed up with narrative of like, oh, you need to do revenue sharing and stuff. He just outright at the beginning said, this token is useless. You buy it with your own risk and whatever, right? So you pretty much just don't want to deal with the bullshit attacks every now and then, right? Because as soon as, let's say you did revenue sharing, right, or let's say you implement a new utility in two days, after that people would be asking for new stuff, right? So it will never be enough.
00:15:06.364 - 00:15:15.728, Speaker D: And it would only be basically distorting whatever you do with the product. So you're not saying you're not doing it, you are just saying, guys, listen, don't mix up the stuff that doesn't make sense at this stage.
00:15:15.876 - 00:15:21.096, Speaker A: Yeah. And I feel like. Ivan, thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Appreciate it.
00:15:21.120 - 00:15:21.280, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:21.312 - 00:15:24.520, Speaker A: You know, thank you for paraphrasing that.
00:15:24.552 - 00:15:24.696, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:24.720 - 00:15:44.240, Speaker A: You know, we appreciate it. No, no, you're 100% right. I feel like, I mean if you look at what actually happens is that many projects, they, again, it's different if your utility is part of your origin story, right. You know, but then what many projects do is that they have utility at that. Like, you know, for. It pumps for like 2 seconds.
00:15:44.272 - 00:15:44.392, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:44.408 - 00:15:45.760, Speaker A: You know, and then like it just dumps again.
00:15:45.792 - 00:15:45.960, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:45.992 - 00:16:34.314, Speaker A: Because it's just never enough. So until we are sure that this project has enough, the growth engine started, the revenue engine started, it's strong enough, it's stable enough. Then when there's enough, sufficient recurring thing, that's actually when it makes sense to discuss that. But at the start, I think part of the reason why I'm so honest, I took a big risk in being so affirmative at the start, you know, about of this topic. It's precisely because I feel like, okay, I don't want to lead. I don't want to over promise and think about what I'm going to do. At a start, I'd rather take the hit early on and go like, hey, this is what I believe and this is the growth path we need to go to in order to kind of go there.
00:16:34.474 - 00:16:34.786, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:34.810 - 00:17:00.218, Speaker A: So precisely your point. I feel like if I just, if I. If I just keep on promising things, then I don't think it's a good start. I'd rather just be like, hey, this is what it is right now. If you look at a lot of projects in the space, it has value and it's up to the market to determine what their value is. Then together as a community, we grow it and then we figure out what we can do from there. That's how I think about it.
00:17:00.386 - 00:17:44.022, Speaker D: Yeah, totally makes sense. However, do you think there is expectations on the token, which is not cool to give? Even if you want to have a narrative of the product, it doesn't mean you need to give fake narrative on the token. Right. So speaking of the concrete narratives that are real, what would those be then? Let's say you said yourself, right? Product take stages. So what stages do you see it now? For example, just by searching some on Twitter before this recording, a lot of people are basically asking, they see a big opportunity in this launchpad type of scenario, right, launch type type of business. And that's what they see as being one of the main drivers because then they start comparing it to BNB and things like that. So do you see it in a similar way? Or you would say the focus is fully different than that specific trajectory.
00:17:44.022 - 00:17:47.838, Speaker D: And apart from this one, what other ones do you see as the main drivers?
00:17:48.006 - 00:18:42.494, Speaker A: Yeah, so for sure. I think that the main thing that I think I'm pushing for right now is like, it's really like, okay, can we create an on chain exchange that is a good replacement for the current exchanges? That is the first step. Can we actually make the user experience and the quality of projects? So it's really as good as a centralized exchange? Because I feel like that is the bar that we're trying to cross. So I feel like the first bar we're trying to cross right now is that, hey, can we actually make the exchange as, can we make Jupiter as good as you go to Jupiter, you don't need to go somewhere else. It's good enough to replace the search. So that's the first bar we are going across. And that encompasses many different things.
00:18:42.494 - 00:19:31.784, Speaker A: That encompasses the swap itself, limit orders, DCA and also everything. I would say the launchpad is not the main thing, but it's part of the whole story. But again, I think that's the reason why I think we really invested in not just launching Joop. I mean, obviously it would be much easier to just launch Jupe as a token, but I think we also wanted to experiment with building something along the way. So that is what we did as well. In summary, I think long story short is that I think that the near term trajectory is to improve the product to a point that it's good enough, such as someone doesn't. I don't think we're there yet, to be honest, but such that we are legitimate sex replacement.
00:19:31.784 - 00:20:07.696, Speaker A: And after we do that, then it's about really growing, growing the user base and then after. I think we have a lot more longer term ideas around. For example, how do we create a giant atomic network of all the different markets in the world, whether it's forex and RWas and everything. Also, how do we bring the stock exchange experience into Jupyter as well? I think there's a lot of, I'll say, basically short term is really to bring the experience on par midterm is to really massively grow the user base. And then thirdly is to kind of, can we really kind of change the way a lot of the financial system works? Yeah. So I think those are three steps.
00:20:07.800 - 00:20:38.256, Speaker C: Moving on. I wanted to go back to the day of the airdrop launch and the days that followed it. The airdrop faced significant criticism. Lots of people called out on crypto Twitter for it being resembling the dynamics of an ICO. There was criticism for the team selling a significant amount of jupe. There was another mechanism called moon protection. Can you possibly detail the main points of criticism from the community and the critics that really stood out to you? And what was your reaction to that?
00:20:38.400 - 00:21:11.424, Speaker A: I would say that there are two communities here. One is the Jupiter community, who actually has to process, and the other community, which is those that happen, you know, so I would say that it's two relatively different sets of people. So I think. I think, okay, let me take a step back. Let me take a step back. What we were doing. I think, honestly, I'm actually a big fan of the meta that we are creating.
00:21:11.424 - 00:21:30.450, Speaker A: So for you, for those who are not too familiar, what we're creating here is actually quite simple. It's a mechanism whereby. Okay, so you have airdrops, you have a pool, and then you also have the buying activity. And all that happens all at once. That's how you call it. LFG. Let's fucking go.
00:21:30.450 - 00:22:12.564, Speaker A: Where the air drops, whereby the air drops, whereby people crimp the airdrops at the same time as the pool goes live, as well as the buying and the balls, and all the buying goes live as well. So that's actually the core mechanism at work. And actually, let us take a step back to revisit why we built this mechanic. Now, first of all, I think if you look at previous. If you look at previous token launchers, one thing that's actually really the previous launchpads, one thing that actually really stood out is that they are not catered for the airdrop metadata, because when you actually have airdrops, the whole thing changed completely. Especially if you're doing a large add on Jupyter. You have no idea.
00:22:12.564 - 00:23:06.444, Speaker A: You have no idea who's gonna buy you, who's gonna sell. You got no idea what the ending price is gonna be, right? That's one thing. Now, the other thing that's actually very important here to understand is that it's really the idea that you don't really know the true market price until everything goes live. Because, for example, for you can develop different isolated pool models, there's been a few in the past, people put in tokens and putting USDC and the price is whatever, and the price is whatever that pool is. Then that kind of pull mechanisms is also, for example, for balancer we have the LDP model. It's similar as well. But the issue is that the initial pool of capital, the price set during the pool, is not actually effective of the price in the open market.
00:23:06.444 - 00:23:44.016, Speaker A: So you don't actually know what the. So even though there's a quote unquote price that's set in the pool, you don't actually know what's the price in the open market as well. Another thing that we're trying to figure out in this token launch model is that it's something about there's no priority, so everyone just starts at once. So there's no pre sale, there's no pre sale, there's no allocation, but more like every such ones. So those are kind of the core motivations for us to kind of like work through this model. Yeah. So I would say that.
00:23:44.016 - 00:23:55.680, Speaker A: I think. I would say that I actually think that this model works well. You know, I think, and I think it's the right meta for many. Not for every project.
00:23:55.832 - 00:23:56.096, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:56.120 - 00:24:33.150, Speaker A: You know, but for many projects. Yeah, I would say that. I would say the mistakes that were made were more technical. I will say that we were trying very hard to protect against bots attacking the pool. That's actually why, I think, because that's actually why we priced the initial price a bit too high, if you ask me. I feel like things have worked out pretty well if both the initial price and the max price was lower. I think that's actually one, one of the main mistakes that I made.
00:24:33.150 - 00:25:36.566, Speaker A: I think I over optimized for bot protection. Yeah, because I think, because I think there was a very, very big outcry in the community over bots getting most of it. So I think that's actually one big reason for us, I would say the other thing that I think we could have done better was that on a technical point of view, a lot of the DCA, they also fire early on, didn't really fire early on, they fired later, and there was actually a bunch of tanker issues involved there. I think that's actually one other big issue as well. Then the last issue I would say is that I would think that I could definitely have done a better job, actually. The third thing is that actually I did write in extensive detail about how a lot of things work, but I think so. I think everyone who has been following, following along in terms of the Jupyter project.
00:25:36.566 - 00:26:07.484, Speaker A: I think they are all very familiar with what's going to happen, but I think there were a lot of people who just came in late and then maybe they weren't too familiar with how the whole thing works. That's actually one big issue as well. I will say that. Lastly, I will say that a lot of things that were discussed were just filled out wrong. A lot of numbers that are being thrown out in social media, including by a lot of friendship people were just plain wrong. And to do a test, I think you can look at the pool now, everything's on chain. You can see exactly how many tokens were in there.
00:26:07.484 - 00:26:26.814, Speaker A: You can see exactly how much users you've taken out. And it's nothing like what's being mentioned in the thing. In fact, one last thing to say is that if you look at the pool now, you will see that we actually didn't even take out the full amount, right. We took it out bit by bit by bit. So actually, the vast majority of pool is still in there, right. You know, for anyone to who. For anyone to sell into, you know, if they want to.
00:26:26.854 - 00:26:27.006, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:27.030 - 00:26:38.926, Speaker A: You know? Yeah. So I think I feel like we addressed. So in summary, I think we address everything really well. I think, you know, that's how I think about it. Yeah.
00:26:39.070 - 00:27:25.240, Speaker D: Thank you for the thorough reply on this. I myself like token models and all of the token launches and things, so it's very interesting to me. And as much as I want to shit on the models and I always shit on things for no reason, I feel like your approach was actually quite cool, if I may say so. It's like having an airdrop be released at the same time as having a balancer pool beam life, right? So it's like if you combine those two things at a time, to an extent, right, because you essentially are able to raise money. But then if the airdrop comes in and it's all sold into, you essentially almost don't take anything at all except for the fees that you have for swap it, right. And those, of course, if you put higher to the USDc side, that makes sense because end of the day, you are essentially risking all of the race that could have happened, right. You could have also just opened it at a lower price, right.
00:27:25.240 - 00:27:40.504, Speaker D: And just pocket all the money. Instead, you basically gave it like a plunge. Protection. Yes. It's not forever, but you took that risk anyway, right? Like the risk was there that it would have been much, much less. So, honestly, personally, I feel like the model is quite beautiful and it really is cool.
00:27:40.544 - 00:27:45.384, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah. Appreciate it. Yeah. To your point. Okay, so I think.
00:27:45.384 - 00:28:16.954, Speaker A: Let me just address a couple of things that I could, could have done better, because it's actually pretty. Again, I think, hey, in all clarity, I feel like I did say many times that I'm willing to. I think I'm testing things out. And so one of the things that I think we learned a lot, guys, we learned a lot. I don't pretend to do anything perfectly, but we learned a lot. And part of the thing that I need to do is also kind of postmortem. But actually, I'm really grateful.
00:28:16.954 - 00:28:53.124, Speaker A: I'm really grateful for learning so I can help other projects do better. I tell one major learning, one major learning that I learned is that I think we pretty much set our Max price too high such that it became an anchor. You do really want that. I think that's actually one thing that we did. But again, I feel like a lot of that is actually because we were very afraid of botting. I mean, if you follow the kind of conversations that happened, and that's totally my fault, right. Because I think I was too worried about that.
00:28:53.124 - 00:29:32.774, Speaker A: But if you follow a lot of the earlier conversations before we launched, a lot of it was about how to prevent the bottles from getting most of the pool. And the easiest way to do that, obviously, you can do all kinds of technically sophisticated things of doing that. We did that. But then the best and most economical way is to just increase the enterprise. But I think in doing so, I think we went too far in that extent. That's one thing. I think the other thing in response to what Ivan is saying is that, yeah, it's open marketing.
00:29:32.774 - 00:29:37.174, Speaker A: One of the most important things here is that there's no pre.
00:29:37.334 - 00:29:38.034, Speaker B: Right.
00:29:38.734 - 00:29:59.350, Speaker A: There's no ico, there's no pre, there's nothing. It's just. It's literally the same thing as opening a liquidity pool on uniswap or whatever. I tell you, from mechanical point of view, it's exactly like going to uniswap and putting LP. That's it. I'm not kidding. So I think that was actually a really big deal as well.
00:29:59.350 - 00:30:25.804, Speaker A: The fact that there's no pre. There's no pre allocation, there's no pre anything. It's just like all in the open market. Yeah. And so I also argue that this is like the most, by far the most transparent thing. You can go more, you can't get more transparent than this, than a team putting up a sell of liquidity at a given price, at a given price range that anyone can see and do. And also, by the way, any USDC is there in the pool.
00:30:25.804 - 00:30:51.180, Speaker A: And again, we actually took a really big risk because it was only three days. But then after all, everyone came in. We missed seven days. Actually, a lot of people were scolding us for making it seven days. They actually didn't want us to make it seven days. They actually want us to keep it three days because they think that it's hampering the price volatility. So actually they wanted to make it lower.
00:30:51.180 - 00:31:15.484, Speaker A: But I think for us, we made seven days. And then, in fact, even after seven days, you only took out a small part of the pool. Lots of pool is still there. So I feel like, I think we have gone above and beyond in refuting a lot of the criticisms that we are just there for the money or just there. Guys, I will say this. We built this thing for years. We built all the best products in Defi for years.
00:31:15.484 - 00:31:29.228, Speaker A: To come in here and say that we are all those things, you know, while not really recognizing the mechanic, I don't think that's fair, to be honest. Yeah, I still think so. I still think they think that's fair.
00:31:29.356 - 00:31:52.344, Speaker D: Yeah. I would agree with you here, as much as I love shitting on people, and I always feel like the way you had your model was quite unique. I mean, unique for Solana, right. On Ethereum, you could have done it with a uniswap range, pool rate, price and then some, I don't know, balance alike mechanics. Doesn't really matter, right. Point was, you did something new with it. It potentially could have made a lot of money.
00:31:52.344 - 00:32:04.080, Speaker D: It could potentially also have made very little money. Right. And you were transparent to take in the risk. And I don't see it being bad. Whether the prices could have been established a bit differently on the levels or not. That's a different point of topic.
00:32:04.112 - 00:32:04.256, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:04.280 - 00:32:31.474, Speaker D: Because again, if you weren't that hyped, you would have different prices. Right? You can never know when the exact ceiling is and when the exact bottom is. You could have also made the entire thing without price levels and completely made it as such that every buyer would have an average price that is the same for everybody. Right? That would probably not have the effect that you wanted then without. With the price discovery. Right? So again, numbers could have been different, but I feel like it was. There are other things you can be shot on and out.
00:32:31.474 - 00:32:39.866, Speaker D: Maybe we should move to those, because this one, I feel like you explained really well enough. So we don't need. I feel like, yeah, I think so too.
00:32:39.890 - 00:32:41.970, Speaker A: Shit on me for other things. Come on then. Come on.
00:32:42.002 - 00:33:04.814, Speaker D: Come on, let's shoot on. When you were getting to it, right? When you were getting to the model intestine in it, why did you have to make stuff with other assets, let's say, prior to it? Why? What was the rationale there that I feel like is the criticism that I at least could side with a little bit more. But again, I don't have the full context, so I would love to understand what's your perspective on that?
00:33:05.994 - 00:33:33.094, Speaker A: Oh, you made other assets to try before Joop. Yeah, for me. For me, it's having fun, right? For me, it's having fun, right? For me, I think I wanted to be. For me, it's more like, okay, we're building a launch pad, right? You know, and then, so again, I feel like the context here is actually important, right? Is that like, we are building a launch pad, right? No, we are not launching. I feel like. And then launchpads need testing, right. You know, and the important thing about test.
00:33:33.094 - 00:34:03.064, Speaker A: The important thing about. The important thing about testing is that, like, about testing is that it's not tanker test, right? It's not a tanker test at all. It's actually a market, a community, and a test. So I feel like. And to me, it was like, I think to us it was like, okay. And by the way, just to be clear, we actually improved our backend systems dramatically before those things. Every single test that we did, we figured out a lot of things that were not working that well.
00:34:03.064 - 00:34:30.156, Speaker A: And whether it's UI point of view, infra point of view. I mean, it was actually a lot of load. I mean, guys, think about it, right? It's like, you really haven't, I don't know of that many projects that handle a million dollar, a million account drop, right? You know, or more than that, right? So I think that's actually one thing that I think. And things just go. Things just keep going haywire in each of these things. So I feel like, I feel like fundamentally, okay, I'll say this thing, right. Fundamentally, we're product people.
00:34:30.156 - 00:34:33.500, Speaker A: Okay? And I bring this to my grave, right. You know?
00:34:33.532 - 00:34:33.724, Speaker B: Right.
00:34:33.764 - 00:34:52.826, Speaker A: Is that we are product people, right. We don't really see things from a point of view of like, okay, we're doing. We're doing. It's more like we are testing the product. So that's actually one main thing. And then the things that we did actually make a lot of mistakes and learn a lot. Like, it or not from point of view.
00:34:52.826 - 00:35:27.784, Speaker A: Even, for example, even for other. Even for other coins, like the wan coin, honestly, I think the price curve was completely different. The price got completely. It was at a really low price, and then it had very slip curve. I think, by the way, anyone who is watching this thing, you can also check out LFG Drupal ag design. We have this really cool modeling tool there. You can actually set your mean price, max price, and the curve and see and have different kind of understanding how we can actually model the curve, the launch per curve.
00:35:27.784 - 00:35:55.410, Speaker A: So for that, we had very different curve. We had very different audience, very different semantics. And I think overall, I think actually went well. Actually the thing well, even now, it's still double or close to double of the launch price. Of the max launch price. I think the mystic, there was not actually around the token. It was actually around the part that got overhyped.
00:35:55.410 - 00:36:21.800, Speaker A: It got overhyped so bad because the launches actually went really well. The launches actually went really well. The pool cleared out really fast. But I think certain, but it just over hyped, in my opinion, later on, you know, and I think certain. And also, like, also in both cases, I feel like the big lesson for me in both the when coin and also was that, okay, when the liquidity pool removal.
00:36:21.832 - 00:36:22.024, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:22.064 - 00:36:24.408, Speaker A: Becomes a really big deal for people, you know?
00:36:24.456 - 00:36:24.808, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:24.896 - 00:36:27.312, Speaker A: It's like when the liquidity pool is, like, redrawn.
00:36:27.408 - 00:36:27.808, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:27.896 - 00:36:31.408, Speaker A: Then there could actually be a lot of fud around that.
00:36:31.456 - 00:36:31.784, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:31.864 - 00:37:07.416, Speaker A: But again, the good thing is this, right now that we've gone through a couple of rounds and then people are actually familiar with the mechanism, future teams are going to be able to take out the KTPU with much less fun and much less fear. I feel like going through that process was actually really important for the launch pad. Again, guys, as a product builder, it doesn't make sense for me to go to a project and be like, hey, use this thing until I've proven it. I think doing a couple of launches was the least I could do, you know, to kind of like, you know, make sure that I understand the whole thing well enough.
00:37:07.560 - 00:37:13.328, Speaker C: We never put a name on it, but we were. Yvonne was referring to the when token, I guess. Right? Is that. Is that correct?
00:37:13.416 - 00:37:13.848, Speaker A: Yep.
00:37:13.936 - 00:37:20.872, Speaker C: Do you have any plans for what's going to happen next with this or you just. It was just an experiment and you're just going to let the community to decide where.
00:37:21.008 - 00:37:33.632, Speaker A: No, there's a big, bro, come on, man. There's a big team running it now. Right there's a really competitive. Come on, that's not fair, right? You know, even to. Even to make a statement, that's not fair, right. You know, because there's actually a really competent team running it. There's lots of updates going on every day.
00:37:33.632 - 00:37:42.470, Speaker A: It's. Is anchoring a new entity standard. I mean, the active community is really active. Check it out, man. Www.whenwithcoin.com whencoin.com dot.
00:37:42.470 - 00:38:02.582, Speaker A: I feel like it's not fair that you're coming into this interview, essentially with a lot of assumptions around how things work. How things work. Because this project is actually having, it's actually anchored by a really good team. That was actually the plan from day one, communicated clearly from day one.
00:38:02.678 - 00:38:03.054, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:03.134 - 00:38:10.238, Speaker A: This is a team that is really good and really smart and. Yeah. So I think, I feel like people should really be more conscious of that.
00:38:10.326 - 00:38:29.934, Speaker D: Oh, by the way, not assumptions. So the point was basically to. Because as you said yourself, there have been many accusations that don't have basis. Right. So what I was, I was just taking, you know, a comment from the outside to let you, like, explain how it is not true. Because, for instance, for me, I am not Solana native at all. I've always been in ethereum, so my knowledge of Solana is not that huge.
00:38:29.934 - 00:38:54.366, Speaker D: So thanks for you taking the time and explaining this stuff. Because for me, as an outsider, as you said yourself, I look at those posts that people post, right, by presumably people who have brains, and if you dig deep, deeper to them, right, a lot of those accusations. So Al wasn't making an assumption. No offense at all. That's what we see from the outside. Alp, you're not Solana native fully either. Right? So that is what we see.
00:38:54.366 - 00:39:12.930, Speaker D: So we were asking only from the perspective, like, okay, that's what people say. Right. So the fact that there is a team, to be honest to me, I knew there was something behind it, but I also thought it was like an experiment, you know, because that's how those influencers portrayed it, so. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So that's good that you're saying it. Yeah.
00:39:13.042 - 00:39:17.050, Speaker A: So can I get a question? What is not an experiment? You know?
00:39:17.082 - 00:39:17.298, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:17.346 - 00:39:19.170, Speaker A: What is. What is not an experiment?
00:39:19.202 - 00:39:19.346, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:19.370 - 00:39:19.506, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:19.530 - 00:39:26.730, Speaker D: I mean, like, yeah, yeah. I get what you mean. I get what you mean. I get what you mean, yeah. Is this a similar topic to the tokens?
00:39:26.762 - 00:39:26.906, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:26.930 - 00:39:49.194, Speaker D: And the utility, those are also people, when they say revenue sharing and stuff like that, right. Those are also just narratives. They are not actually concrete things. Like you said yourself, if you were to promise DUP revenue sharing on day one, it wouldn't really make any sense. Right. You would just be playing into the mob's hand and giving them what they want and they would be asking you for new bullshit already tomorrow. Right.
00:39:49.194 - 00:39:54.282, Speaker D: Again, I'm not, I'm not arguing with you. I'm actually confirming what you said. So. Yeah. In that sense, agree.
00:39:54.338 - 00:40:00.498, Speaker A: Yeah, I wasn't. Sorry. Again, I want to apologize for like, you know, any, any rudeness.
00:40:00.546 - 00:40:00.730, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:00.762 - 00:40:02.346, Speaker A: You know, I might have convict, right?
00:40:02.370 - 00:40:02.610, Speaker B: No, no.
00:40:02.642 - 00:40:07.254, Speaker D: You should be totally saying that. You know, you're totally right. If I were at your place, I would be fucking pissed, to be honest.
00:40:08.034 - 00:40:16.674, Speaker A: I just feel like. I just feel like a lot of things have been communicated before very clearly at the start and also a lot of context that you give at the start.
00:40:16.794 - 00:40:17.454, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:18.234 - 00:40:54.978, Speaker A: And it is like, I do feel like in many of these interviews I have been on, or even on those Twitter. For those Twitter posts that you're mentioning, it just doesn't seem to come from a good place for me. I'll be honest with you. If you look at my track record, I feel like I've always been extremely supportive. Other projects, whether it's ethereum or solana or whatever, I've never been anything else. I think, you know, so I think it's a bit. Okay, okay, guys, guys, I'll be honest.
00:40:54.978 - 00:40:57.914, Speaker A: Okay. Is it hurting for me? Okay. I'll be hurt.
00:40:58.034 - 00:40:58.322, Speaker B: All right.
00:40:58.338 - 00:41:01.498, Speaker A: I'll be. I'll be hurt. Okay. I'm actually a little bit hurt. Okay. I'm actually a little bit sad.
00:41:01.546 - 00:41:01.826, Speaker B: Alright.
00:41:01.850 - 00:41:19.186, Speaker A: I feel like a lot of those. I feel like a lot of the. I feel like a lot of the. And it's not just hurting me, my community, right. Because guys, if we work years and then we guys building, you can shoot on the. You can shoot on everything that you want.
00:41:19.210 - 00:41:19.370, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:19.402 - 00:41:26.528, Speaker A: But it's quite. Lots of people have said many times that Jupyter is one of the best products in Defi. I use it every day.
00:41:26.696 - 00:41:28.128, Speaker D: I thought it. Yeah, yeah.
00:41:28.216 - 00:41:48.502, Speaker A: So it's like to completely neglect that years of work we put into it and focus on things, that is kind of misunderstood. I don't think that's fair. But unfortunately, that's actually where the majority of attention is. It's not just hurting me, it's hurting my whole community and hurting my whole team. So that's actually where a lot of my frustration comes from.
00:41:48.608 - 00:41:48.930, Speaker B: No, no.
00:41:48.962 - 00:41:54.082, Speaker D: Totally understandable. And apologies from my side. I wasn't a train last two days, so I didn't do that much. No, no, no.
00:41:54.218 - 00:41:54.634, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:41:54.674 - 00:42:03.570, Speaker D: You're totally right. I should have done modi delusions on it, because you are correct that even if we don't make assumptions by asking those questions, we do bring it from a negative point of view. Right.
00:42:03.642 - 00:42:41.466, Speaker C: You mentioned that I come from, like, with assumption or something, but, like, that, that was definitely not my, like, point to come and put you on, like, a negative light, as Ivan said. Like, I'm. At the end of the day, I'm a journalist, and I need to take the voices of the public and bring it out to you as well. And typically, I understand that, like, you're frustrated about this as well. I would be frustrated in your place as well. But, like, one thing that we have to understand that these people are doing that for engagement like this is they're playing the Twitter game, and that's why they're doing this bullshit, like, commentary. Because it became so popular to shit on Solana and Solana products, because a lot of people just missed out on the train.
00:42:41.466 - 00:42:52.218, Speaker C: At the end of the day, that's why we're having this conversation with you as well. Because a lot of things that were unclear for me, or, like, I didn't understand. I'm asking to you apologies if you took it the wrong way.
00:42:52.346 - 00:43:11.506, Speaker A: Just trying to understand. It's like. Because. Okay, honestly speaking, I feel like the team actually worked really hard for the last three years. And honestly, guys, from a financial reward point of view, I can tell you we really didn't get much. Really, seriously, we didn't. It's like, even now, we are living.
00:43:11.506 - 00:43:24.196, Speaker A: Guys, to be clear, we are living 10 million. We took 10 million in the pool. We left vast majority in the pool right now. And it's at the risk of getting shot, being dumped on, you know, being like. And being farther on.
00:43:24.300 - 00:43:24.732, Speaker B: Right.
00:43:24.828 - 00:43:37.644, Speaker A: And we do that because we wanted to kind of prove. Right, you know, to the. To the haters, right? Not haters. Not to the community that we. Dude, so many people were saying we were doing for the money, right? It's like, guys, I mean, every single tweet.
00:43:37.684 - 00:43:43.820, Speaker D: Yeah. Like, sorry to interrupt you, but every single tweet says that. I like. I mean, I. That's why I mentioned it a couple of times. I like. I'm an ethereum.
00:43:43.820 - 00:43:48.426, Speaker D: Defi. Maybe you heard, maybe gearbox. Not a big project or, like, lobster dao. A community.
00:43:48.610 - 00:43:48.906, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:48.930 - 00:44:13.054, Speaker D: So, like, I. Because I wasn't. Defi, what is it since 2000 to not to lie? 20. I also. Even the circle of people who just laugh to shit on Solana for no reason, just because, you know, like, how early bitcoin people love to shit on Ethereum for no fucking reason. So I'm just exposed to the same stuff. So, honestly, a lot of the stuff I've seen about Jupiter, any Solana friends I have, they always say it's a great product.
00:44:13.054 - 00:44:24.142, Speaker D: Anybody outside of Solana really goes proactively to shit on it. And I don't even understand what the reason is. Like, I'm so. That's what I meant. I live myself to shit on stuff also, which is not a good quality, by the way.
00:44:24.158 - 00:44:25.194, Speaker A: That's not a good quality.
00:44:25.614 - 00:44:50.784, Speaker D: But in this case, when I saw the model, I was like, the model? Like, you can tell anything, but the model actually makes sense. Like, it's like, if you allow, like, you took the risk, you had. Again, not to rephrase yourself to the third time, but there was money, but you are taking that. You took the risk, and you are still taking the risk. So I still don't understand how people shit on it. Like, it's just a very genuine model. It wasn't just an ICO where all money goes to you.
00:44:50.784 - 00:44:55.724, Speaker D: Yes, they were fees that were high on USDC side, but again, you could have also just raised the same.
00:44:56.704 - 00:44:58.216, Speaker A: Go to a dow, by the way, you know?
00:44:58.280 - 00:44:58.648, Speaker B: Right.
00:44:58.736 - 00:45:00.352, Speaker A: 75% of fees go to dow.
00:45:00.448 - 00:45:00.656, Speaker B: Right.
00:45:00.680 - 00:45:02.544, Speaker A: You know, it's not even by us. We don't take the money.
00:45:02.624 - 00:45:21.360, Speaker D: Okay. So, see, like, every single thing I seen on Jupiter online, people shitting was basically wrong. Every one of them. And I. I know people love to shit on people who are successful, right? But in this case of Jupiter, I feel like everybody went out of their way to shit extra hard. Like, I haven't seen that level of shittery in a long, long time. Right.
00:45:21.360 - 00:45:21.800, Speaker D: Alp.
00:45:21.872 - 00:45:27.744, Speaker A: Like, okay, man, why did you make so many enemies?
00:45:27.784 - 00:45:29.336, Speaker D: Like, I've seen people.
00:45:29.440 - 00:45:36.720, Speaker A: I'm so nice. Like, dude, I'm so nice. Like, I. I don't shoot on anything. I'm actually really nice. Like, seriously, like. Like, if you look at anything I did and stuff.
00:45:36.720 - 00:45:41.474, Speaker A: WTC instad Kyber. I'm so nice. Everyone who looks at me.
00:45:42.174 - 00:45:49.994, Speaker C: I think if anything, you should. You should see this all, like, negative negativism and, like, hatery as a sign of success. Because if you're not.
00:45:51.454 - 00:45:57.914, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I know. It's easy. By the way, you know Andre Cronier?
00:45:59.294 - 00:45:59.654, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:59.694 - 00:46:36.146, Speaker D: I mean. I mean, we were close friends before now a bit less because he's doing only phantom stuff, but he was also going through similar things, and again, some people really hate him but if you knew him as a builder I don't know what your opinion of him is, but he also was faced with quite a few similar things and at some point the, he just got like, I remember people like back in the days like wire and co contributors and like Ethereum they were like supporting him. And these days whenever people shit on him I don't even see anybody protecting. So somehow people just mix up their own shit and like poop into, how do you call it, don't shit where you live. Right. Or like the. And they for some reason do it.
00:46:36.146 - 00:46:58.718, Speaker D: Yeah. Anyway, good that we got it out of the way and they're very glad to have this call because now my opinion of Jupiter and like your steps has changed a lot in the positive direction of course, because before I only saw, before I only saw shit online, you know. So it's good that we are doing this interview and hopefully making things less shitty in terms of public optics.
00:46:58.766 - 00:47:19.854, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like, I feel like probably, I feel like what frustrates me the most is I feel like we are very misunderstood. It's like we really worked out headstart for a few years and stuff and we are here trying to create a new model for. Okay, let me take a more organic view on things. If you guys have just a couple of minutes. Is that. We were stuck, man. We were stuck.
00:47:19.854 - 00:47:46.576, Speaker A: We were not trying to do it, man. It's like we had this massive airdrop that's going on that might or might not. We have no idea. Is there actually enough iniquity in the market to adopt such a big airdrop? We don't know. Also at the same time I think really high expectation of the price is we didn't set the price. By the way, this is not what we said, it's what the market thought it would be. Whether it's in the purse market or the wheels market.
00:47:46.576 - 00:48:36.766, Speaker A: No other predictions. In many ways I think in many ways I think what we're trying to do is that we're trying to say, hey, you know what, given a project, given our situation, by the way, another thing is important is this, I did mention this before, is that in breakpoint I did actually mention that 20% of the token was going to be for token sale. So I think it was 20% by the way, which obviously wouldn't make sense given the valuation. And we kept scaling that back 20 to ten to five. Now into my five. It just kept staying there all the way back to one where we think it would be reasonable. Again, even though I think the final outcome is pretty reasonable, I think it was still, as Ivan was saying and stuff, there were some parameters that couldn't battle.
00:48:36.766 - 00:49:27.468, Speaker A: But now I know, I think now I know that, now I know, hey, I can tell other projects, hey, you know what, it's really important that you set this curve in the right way. So I think, in other words, I feel like three things, we genuinely had no idea how the dynamics would come about. Secondly, that we did actually want to offer tokens in a way that we wanted to be as transparent as possible. Again, I think you can shoot on the model for a lot of things, but what you can't say is that it's very transparent. The whole thing is there and you can literally see how much he's taken out. And then we don't take anything until three days or seven days or months later. So I feel like again, you can shoot for many things and stuff, you can't ask for saying that, oh, we took the money out, things like that.
00:49:27.468 - 00:50:29.338, Speaker A: You can't say that. I think lastly is that, I think that is that I do actually, I do actually think that we spend a very long time. This didn't come from. I think part of the reason for the surprise is that I think, I think part of disparity between our community, what community sees and what the outside world sees is that our community knows that we've been here for years and grinding over every single aspect of product from the infra site to the routing side, to the UI side to the ecosystem building site and also to kind of really making it work awesomely. For example, I'll give you some example, for example, you have clob, you have Dexa. Also a lot of other liquidity models on Solana that's actually not anywhere else. So making them all, and then we have three token standards, we had three token standards, SPL 22, token 22 and SPL standards and working, all of them work well together in one single thing.
00:50:29.338 - 00:51:02.864, Speaker A: It was actually a lot of work. It wasn't trivia. And obviously building on top of that, the limit order and the DC and the purpose launchpad, it was just a lot of effort to come together. So I feel like maybe if you are new to the whole thing you just go oh, this is shitty. Why were. But then if you are part of community, you see the work that's been done over the years. So I feel like there's actually one disparity I see about why there's such a big disparity in your opinions between someone who just goes like, oh, why is this thing with x versus people? Oh, yeah, this makes sense because they've been working for years.
00:51:02.864 - 00:51:09.604, Speaker A: So I feel like that could actually be another reason why there's such a big disparity in opinions.
00:51:10.344 - 00:51:32.686, Speaker D: Yeah, makes sense. I mean, people can cheat on valuations and prices as much as they want. That is fully subjective and you cannot do anything about it. I mean, the only thing you can do is keep executing and then at some point people's over exceeding expectations will be matched. Whether that's the case or not, market can only tell. Right. But indeed about the model and the progress that has been done, that just doesn't seem fair to shit on that.
00:51:32.686 - 00:52:02.890, Speaker D: So thanks again for clarifying those parts. I don't even know how, but I saw literally at least four different posts that claimed that when was simply empty shitcoin being launched to test the platform and for Meow to make like dozens of millions of dollars. I've seen literally many posts like that from people I thought actually who had brains. How could they, I don't even understand. How could that have been twisted so hard, right? Like very different. Right? Like that's a reality.
00:52:02.922 - 00:52:15.778, Speaker A: Like, I mean, I don't know either. First of all, I made zero of when zero. I mean, like zero, zero. Like zero. You can check on chain off chain zero. And I'm saying done, right, whatever, right. And secondly, is that, secondly, it's a good coin.
00:52:15.778 - 00:52:19.450, Speaker A: I mean, I mean, I think. I think the only problem is you're overhyped, you know?
00:52:19.482 - 00:52:19.794, Speaker B: Right.
00:52:19.874 - 00:52:25.446, Speaker A: I think overhyped. I didn't do the hyping. Right. Again, I take responsibility for everything that happened.
00:52:25.570 - 00:52:25.806, Speaker B: Right.
00:52:25.830 - 00:52:39.434, Speaker A: And I think, you know, and I recognize that things could have done better, you know? But I mean, I think it's a good coin. I think it's a good project. You know, there's a routine behind it. They're making a lot of like, you know, great comedy behind it and stuff. Yeah. And then. Yeah, and then I don't.
00:52:39.434 - 00:53:12.644, Speaker A: I think. I think it went well, you know, I think the whole launch went really well, you know? Yeah. I think the problem actually, for when the problem happened after the launch, it got way, way over hyped, you know? Right, yeah. So the launch itself went well. Massive airdrop, like over one, over a few hundred thousand people got the airdrop and they were really happy with it and the community got formed. The issue was that after the launch happened that it got way over hyped. And then there was also a bunch of hype and fart around the liquidity and the burn.
00:53:12.644 - 00:53:36.056, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we could have managed that hype a lot better. But then again, we didn't really, like, we didn't. I think hype is one of those things that we can't really control, you know? Yeah, but, yeah, no, but again, I guess one of the things I'm very happy about is that right now, after everything, including this interview, I feel like hopefully people understand things better now.
00:53:36.200 - 00:53:36.480, Speaker B: Right.
00:53:36.512 - 00:53:39.576, Speaker A: You know, and, you know, certainly I feel like for other projects you can do better.
00:53:39.640 - 00:54:08.684, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah, hopefully. And again, sorry for coming in with not negative assumptions, just very shitty information. They put it like that. And I am just again, surprised how shitty the information is these days about it, because I know people lie, people make up facts for clicks, right? For engagement. But in this case, I feel like it's just way perverted. Like that level of pervertism I don't even see in Hentai, you know, even Hentai is less perverted than the amount of, than the stuff they were making up.
00:54:08.724 - 00:54:12.664, Speaker A: And that's pretty cool. I mean, depending on what you know. But I don't know.
00:54:13.254 - 00:54:15.434, Speaker D: We know we are experts in that, sir.
00:54:17.414 - 00:54:18.086, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:54:18.110 - 00:54:18.462, Speaker D: Good to know.
00:54:18.478 - 00:54:23.954, Speaker A: Good. I'll ping you privately, you know. Sounds good. Yeah, cool.
00:54:24.254 - 00:54:38.748, Speaker C: Maybe let's just continue on with the future. What's next for Jupiter? So the third crucial component of Jupiter that you called Jupiter, United Planet, can you possibly break down the upcoming phase and what the three components involved in this phase are?
00:54:38.846 - 00:55:10.764, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for asking. I feel like there's three parts of Jupyter, I think Jupyter, we call it the three dupes, Jupy AG, which is the platform and the product. And the goal is to really build that into the best on chain platform in crypto. Then the second part is of course the token dollar. Juke, which is the governance token. And ideally in the future become a currency. If the Jupyter economy becomes big enough, then it can become currency.
00:55:10.764 - 00:56:02.636, Speaker A: And lastly, the JW, which is the community, the work groups and the DAO. Because I do think that Jupyter as a project has three key parts, which is the platform, the token, and also the community. I guess the important thing here is that people emphasize the DAO. But as we all know, the DAo in and of itself is not very useful. The DAO in and of itself is a program that people can put and they vote and they release some kind of tokens or whatever decisions. But the essence of a doubt is really in the people who put in the work, in proposing the right. Projects in the community that believes in the mission and all the work that is done into preparing all the grants and all the proposals and everything.
00:56:02.636 - 00:56:41.476, Speaker A: So I think that's actually what we call JWRP. It's like a collective. It's like this group of people, whether it's including the DAo, the work groups, and the community, that comes together to kind of like grow Jupiter input, Solana, and to drive the meta. So I think that's why we call the JWP. And one thing that we announced today is the workgroups Jupyter work groups, basically, these are small independent groups of community leaders who can each take on a critical part of the community. For example, our first work group is going to focus on LFG applications. It's going to focus on creating the ecosystem.
00:56:41.476 - 00:57:15.584, Speaker A: Token list is going to be preparing the grants. It's also going to be moderating the discord. I think that is actually one group. Then we're going to have another group that's going to be doing weekly ecosystem calls where we get together our partners and our partners and community leaders and everyone to come together to a rally on a weekly basis. Jupyter we might have other groups that are more focused on content. And now we get more focus on onboarding new users to Solana and Jupiter, I don't know yet, but the whole point is to. And then also, as I mentioned earlier, what's actually really important here is that the DAO is actually funded.
00:57:15.584 - 00:57:54.684, Speaker A: That's actually why 75% of the launch pool fees go into the DAO. And also Dao is also going to be incentivized to work as well. I think what we're doing now is just preparing the entire, alongside improving the product is to create the entire. I consider the apparatus for the community to work well because the DAo alone itself doesn't do much. It's like a Dao. And then if the team does all the work, it actually doesn't really make sense. So I think a really, really big part of what we did in the last few months was just setting things up for the DAO to work well and the team to work well.
00:57:54.684 - 00:58:03.482, Speaker A: That's how we did. Yeah. So that's actually gonna be kind of my main focus for next to next to next. Next few. Definitely next couple months. Yeah.
00:58:03.538 - 00:58:33.810, Speaker D: Do maybe put a couple of people in the Dow who would be walking around and telling shitfluencers on when they are on and fact checking them, you know, could help a long way to like. Right. Because like, it's it's not your fault in any way, per se that people have misinformation and a lot of it, but it does help when people don't face it too much. Right. And there is somebody fact checking. I'm making this statement as half a joke, right. But maybe not per se, because sometimes clearing that up for people who are outside is also helpful without you having to resort to it.
00:58:33.810 - 00:58:42.610, Speaker D: Right. Without the core team having to spend energy in time. Because then again, your lives are also easy if things are clarified. Right. If that makes.
00:58:42.802 - 00:58:48.322, Speaker A: I've been. I've been thinking. I've been taking a lot of advice recently just to, like, just to focus on stuff, you know.
00:58:48.378 - 00:58:48.570, Speaker B: Right.
00:58:48.602 - 00:58:50.994, Speaker A: Yeah. Everything, you know. Yeah.
00:58:51.074 - 00:59:08.372, Speaker D: I mean, during the launch, right. Couple of weeks in couple of weeks after, you will always be bombarded with a ton of shit, with a ton of criticism whether you did it. If the price goes up, you will be criticized for not giving enough to community. If the price goes down, they will say that you made too much money. So it will never be enough. It will never be. Right.
00:59:08.548 - 00:59:21.740, Speaker A: So indeed, I accept that as part of the game. Yeah. I also accept that I have to defend my team and my community, you know? Yeah. So that's. That's how the game and stuff, you know? Yeah, yeah.
00:59:21.812 - 00:59:36.518, Speaker D: It's good that you have that perspective. That's. I think that comes to founders only after a couple of times. Because at first, many are like, oh, my God, this is so stressful. I didn't sign up for this. I'm like, listen, man, you work with big amounts of money, you have a big enough reward down the line. It is fun and new.
00:59:36.518 - 00:59:40.150, Speaker D: So strap up. Right. And don't cry.
00:59:40.302 - 00:59:50.582, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Like, shut the fuck up, you know? Print the work on Twitter. Pointer one. Disco. Print the one on no podcast. Just doing the work, man.
00:59:50.718 - 00:59:55.184, Speaker D: You don't want to do it, go back to fucking ABM, right? That always has open doors for you. So if you.
00:59:57.924 - 01:00:02.384, Speaker A: Want me, man. They don't want me, man. Trust me, they want you either, bro. Forget it.
01:00:03.404 - 01:00:09.404, Speaker D: I mean, if he and Balina got to it, then maybe you can do as well. You will have chances. You know? I'm. I'm trolling.
01:00:09.444 - 01:00:17.348, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I know. Yeah, but, no, but. But you're right. You're right. I think one of the things that. I think, um. I think one of the things I think, um.
01:00:17.348 - 01:00:43.446, Speaker A: I mean, I'm quite sure we're shooting on time, but I think that that's just from a very personal founder point of view, right. Is that, like, I feel like. So, like, actually the, this project, let's just do one last conversation, right, since you're talking real here. Okay. Let's talk real here. Okay, cool. So when I first started Jupiter, when superstar and Solana, we started a project called Mercurial, right, and Mercury didn't do well.
01:00:43.446 - 01:00:45.366, Speaker A: Mercury went to shit.
01:00:45.430 - 01:00:45.630, Speaker B: Right.
01:00:45.662 - 01:01:16.004, Speaker A: I mean, that despite our best efforts, right. And I think that the good thing was that we didn't give up. We just didn't give up. We didn't give up. We started Jupiter and then Mercurial became Mitura, a new platform. I think as a result of, I think as a result, all this. And then we also took a snapshot of mercurial we took a snapshot of mercurial right, on February last year.
01:01:16.004 - 01:02:07.904, Speaker A: And then now mercury holders are going to get 5% of juke. And also they also form the initial stakeholders metro, which is a really up and coming, highly regarded Amm on Solana. Now, long story short is that actually mercury stakeholders are going to do well. So it's like we didn't do well at the start, but we never gave up. We kept working for them, and as a result, I think as a result of Jupiter and Mitura doing well, I think we are going to be able to do well for the mercurial stakeholders. Even it took a while. For example, every mer would.
01:02:07.904 - 01:02:30.674, Speaker A: I'm actually very proud of my team for that. Despite us not doing well, I think facing a lot of criticisms early on, we just never gave up as a result. I think we have two leading projects now. I think whatever happens, I think we're going to do well for them. I'm actually very proud of that. The fact they just didn't give up. Same thing with Jupiter.
01:02:30.674 - 01:02:43.316, Speaker A: I feel like I can't promise what's going to happen to the token price in the short term. That's out of my control in many ways, but I think we'll just keep working.
01:02:43.420 - 01:03:17.598, Speaker D: That's how it's, that's actually very genuine. Thanks for more light on this. It happens very rarely in crypto, and actually one of the podcast ideas we had with AlpSA, maybe you would even want to come on board to that one, is how some teams essentially keep the promises they made to the early backers, even five years back, and then somehow tried to remedy that, whoever believed in them and some just completely shit on their communities and make new tokens two months into the life of a project. It's such a huge discrepancy. There are many, even in Ethereum which is like a boomer community at this point. Solana is more new. Let's be honest.
01:03:17.598 - 01:03:49.650, Speaker D: Ethereum is boomer. And I think even Ethereum people agree with it even there. There are many public teams at this point that have made two plus coins at the same time publicly. And it's just becoming really weird that people don't know where the limit is. Some of them just stop something and just never even do a snapshot. The only other case that happened that I think was really well and not regarded as much as it should be is Igor Barinov of Poa Network and then Xdai, which sold toggnosis. Both essentially got the snapshot and gnosis.
01:03:49.650 - 01:04:08.304, Speaker D: Dao acquired Xdai, which then acquired Poa. So a similar thing. Of course, price wise, maybe it wasn't perfect, it has dropped already, but at least two projects that he did before were essentially acquired diagnosis Dao. So in that case, thanks to gnosis now. Right. But still, a founder did go through the miles to do the snapshot like you did yourself. Right.
01:04:08.304 - 01:04:21.184, Speaker D: So that the only folders who had a belief. Yeah, you cannot promise moon, right. You cannot make the snapshot that they do 100 x. Maybe they only make back whatever they invested or a bit less. But you did go through the hoops. You did give.
01:04:21.344 - 01:04:27.800, Speaker A: Actually, actually, if you bought mer at the end of a snapshot, you would do extremely well. Yeah.
01:04:27.832 - 01:04:42.184, Speaker D: I mean, like, you can, you cannot always promise it and make it exactly perfect. So you kind of just make money for everybody end of the day. But the fact that you go through these hoops and do a meaningful amount already makes a ton already is a great thing to do.
01:04:42.224 - 01:05:04.578, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like to your point, right, I think. To your point, right. It was like we were like. So to your point, it was like we had to kind of like really go through the hopes there to make it work, you know? Yeah, but I'm happy with it. I think at the end of the day, I think the community was actually really happy with it, you know?
01:05:04.626 - 01:05:05.214, Speaker B: Right.
01:05:06.314 - 01:05:26.602, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, you know, I think obviously, I think the thing was this, right. It was like there was a really big, pure uncertainty between the snapshot and also, and also the tokens finally manifesting, which took like almost a year, I think, you know.
01:05:26.658 - 01:05:27.186, Speaker B: Right.
01:05:27.330 - 01:05:31.908, Speaker A: But I think it turned out really well for everybody in the end, you know? Yeah, but it took a while, I think.
01:05:31.956 - 01:05:56.842, Speaker D: Yeah, but you cannot make it perfect, right? I mean, you maybe could have made it perfect, but you cannot really always make it perfect. End of the day, a lot of it is intentions. Right. And at least making something back to the holders who believed in whatever you were doing before. And I think that's a great effort and a great thing to do because many people just completely shit on that. Right. Because, for example, in web two, whenever you invest in something, right, you have this pro rata shares to whatever the founder has done.
01:05:56.842 - 01:05:57.910, Speaker D: You have non competes.
01:05:57.942 - 01:05:58.086, Speaker B: Right.
01:05:58.110 - 01:06:25.090, Speaker D: And stuff like that. Many of the times it's bullshit, but in many cases at least, you cannot just have a founder, like, completely make a token next week like this right after the launch and then just go on and the investors are basically left in the shithole. So in crypto, that happens way too often. Yeah. Anyway, I was just, like, supporting that. It is cool that you have done it and I think more people should be taking an example from it and given. Given how they call it, pay respects.
01:06:25.090 - 01:06:27.626, Speaker D: Right. To an extent, yeah, I think.
01:06:27.650 - 01:06:54.670, Speaker A: I think actually, the other thing is that I think. Yeah, I think. I think besides Jupiter, I think we also have Mithora and stuff. Another thing that I think is interesting is the whole thing about team having multiple projects. I think it's going to be very common to have a team having multiple projects at the. I think it's about just being transparent. I think everyone knows that we work on, you know.
01:06:54.702 - 01:06:55.274, Speaker B: Right.
01:06:55.774 - 01:06:59.206, Speaker A: I think that is actually really important. I think, you know.
01:06:59.270 - 01:07:11.926, Speaker D: Yeah. It's such a subjective thing. Right. Because I just don't know better examples. So not. I'm not gnosis holder by any means, or their friend. It's just that Gno is known to have done multiple tokens.
01:07:11.926 - 01:07:19.478, Speaker D: Right. You know. You know, gnosis now. Right. Like, in their case, the products are very different from what the core thing started.
01:07:19.526 - 01:07:19.686, Speaker B: Right.
01:07:19.710 - 01:07:44.202, Speaker D: Like a safe or like a cow swap. Right. So they're very different from what they began with. But the question is, where is that subjective line which allows you to make a new token lie? Right. Does it need to, like, how different does it have to be from the first main vision? How many people new have to be in it to justify doing it? Right. So that's a bit of a question. Like, the resources, the optics.
01:07:44.202 - 01:07:46.484, Speaker D: It's incredibly subjective. Yeah.
01:07:46.594 - 01:07:52.824, Speaker A: Incredible subjective. Yeah. And I would say that it comes down to whoever invests later on.
01:07:52.864 - 01:07:53.040, Speaker B: Right.
01:07:53.072 - 01:08:07.576, Speaker A: You know, like, you just have to. I mean, no one. And the wonderful thing about crypto, I think, is like, you know, I think you have to do your own research, right, into kind of, like, the background and everything, you know, and everything and stuff right before you jump in.
01:08:07.720 - 01:08:08.000, Speaker B: Right.
01:08:08.032 - 01:08:39.395, Speaker A: You know, so I feel like that's actually pretty important, I think, you know, just to. Yeah, I think it's pretty important to have the. But isn't it cool that no one is forcing anybody to do anything? And that is the whole genesis of crypto. It's a very. All the information is there if you want to research and actually look into it. And I feel like the world you guys are doing is actually really important that you shine more light on what's going on, you know?
01:08:39.459 - 01:08:46.347, Speaker D: Now we're just shitting on people here, as you know, so. No, no, we. We not. We don't do educational stuff, really. At least not so far.
01:08:46.395 - 01:08:50.663, Speaker A: Let's go. Let's go. Let's shit. Let's go. That's a big poop. Let's shit on you. Let's go.
01:08:50.663 - 01:08:52.859, Speaker A: The girls. One cup.
01:08:52.891 - 01:08:55.543, Speaker D: You know, the video. I'll be on you, by the way.
01:08:56.443 - 01:09:01.183, Speaker A: Dude, you're such a shit talker, man. What's going on? Oh, my God. You're such a shit talker. What the fuck?
01:09:01.523 - 01:09:04.219, Speaker D: I'm sorry. Yes. I should have done more research to the shit talking. Yeah.
01:09:04.291 - 01:09:12.664, Speaker C: I just wanted to ask what advice you would have to aspiring founders looking to build in the defi space or in the Solana ecosystem.
01:09:14.684 - 01:09:26.944, Speaker A: I mean, it's really interesting, right? Because, like, you. It's like. It's really interesting. I know, I know, I know. I got it, I got it, I got it. Don't get caught up in hype. Don't.
01:09:26.944 - 01:09:33.332, Speaker A: It's like the hype just. It's funny because you need hype, right? Just be clear. You need hype.
01:09:33.348 - 01:09:33.476, Speaker B: Right?
01:09:33.500 - 01:09:34.983, Speaker A: Jupiter was very hyped.
01:09:35.163 - 01:09:35.455, Speaker B: Right.
01:09:35.479 - 01:09:49.047, Speaker A: You know what I'm saying? You know what? Jujuts really, really hard, right. And then. But then I feel like the good thing. I feel like the good thing about it is that I think. I think it's very, very easy to be extremely worried. Okay. Okay.
01:09:49.047 - 01:09:55.319, Speaker A: I know, I know. Sorry. I think you think Jupiter for a long time, long, long, long, long time, was not hyped at all.
01:09:55.351 - 01:09:55.495, Speaker B: Right?
01:09:55.519 - 01:10:03.130, Speaker A: You know, for, like, you know, like, no one care. That's just. No one care. That's part of the reason why people were so surprised when Jupiter came out. No. Nowhere.
01:10:03.162 - 01:10:03.546, Speaker B: Right?
01:10:03.650 - 01:10:12.266, Speaker A: But the reason. Because we worked our ass off, right? We just worked our ass off, right? You know, the barriers. Remember the barriers from, like, when Solana went down and down and down and shit, and was shit.
01:10:12.290 - 01:10:12.570, Speaker B: Right.
01:10:12.642 - 01:10:14.002, Speaker A: No one cared about Solana and Jupiter.
01:10:14.058 - 01:10:14.634, Speaker B: Right.
01:10:14.794 - 01:10:25.114, Speaker A: So we just woke the s off, right. Just improved the product. We didn't care about hype. Improved the product every single day. The only metric, the volume keep going down, but the only metric that went up was the user satisfaction.
01:10:25.274 - 01:10:25.666, Speaker B: Right.
01:10:25.730 - 01:10:27.122, Speaker A: That metric kept going up.
01:10:27.258 - 01:10:27.506, Speaker B: Right.
01:10:27.530 - 01:10:27.794, Speaker A: You know?
01:10:27.834 - 01:10:28.322, Speaker B: Right.
01:10:28.458 - 01:10:30.282, Speaker A: And I think that was really good for us.
01:10:30.298 - 01:10:30.426, Speaker D: Right.
01:10:30.450 - 01:10:57.966, Speaker A: Because we ignored the hype to just keep building. Then when the time came, obviously we leveraged on the hype, but I was never happy. We can't launch the right time to get a certain amount of awareness and traction now, I feel like. But I think I didn't actually manage the hype that well, I think. Especially towards the end of things.
01:10:58.100 - 01:10:58.514, Speaker B: Right.
01:10:58.594 - 01:11:06.858, Speaker A: You know, I think that's actually a big reason for a lot of the backlash I'm facing now, you know?
01:11:06.906 - 01:11:07.618, Speaker B: Right, right.
01:11:07.746 - 01:11:31.806, Speaker A: So I feel like. I feel like learning how to, like, ignore the hype and, like, not worry about the lack of hype and do the work is really important. And then when the hype comes, just being, like, lever headed about it, you know, and not, like, not thinking of the best just because you're hyped up. That's really hard, by the way. It's really fucking hard. It's really fucking hard to, like, you know, not think you are the best, the smartest fucking guy in the world.
01:11:31.830 - 01:11:31.966, Speaker B: Right.
01:11:31.990 - 01:11:34.654, Speaker A: When the whole way, oh, yeah, you're a genius, blah, blah, blah. No, it's really hard.
01:11:34.694 - 01:11:35.206, Speaker B: Right.
01:11:35.350 - 01:11:39.470, Speaker A: And then, like. And later when the hype turns to fart, you know?
01:11:39.502 - 01:11:39.958, Speaker B: Right.
01:11:40.086 - 01:11:49.254, Speaker A: You're just gonna, you know, you're just gonna be able to take it easy. I didn't do well there. I don't think I did too well then. Yeah.
01:11:49.294 - 01:11:55.430, Speaker D: I would slap your wrist if I were on your team and I read your twitter. I would, like, cut your finger off at some point, to be honest.
01:11:55.542 - 01:12:01.398, Speaker A: I mean, something better? Come on. Not that bad. I didn't. I know it's not that bad, but.
01:12:01.446 - 01:12:18.774, Speaker D: I think it's the PFP. I think it's your profile image of a cat making you seem like a, you know, like a slick. Slick. How do you call it? What's the english word? Like a cunning person, you know? And then it gives that vibe. Put something more like a nun there, you know? Like something with a monk or something.
01:12:18.894 - 01:12:24.758, Speaker A: Yeah, but, yeah, I think learning how to deal with hype is very important.
01:12:24.886 - 01:12:25.126, Speaker B: Right.
01:12:25.150 - 01:12:27.990, Speaker A: Like, just. Yeah, I feel like I could done it better. Yeah.
01:12:28.142 - 01:12:40.714, Speaker D: All you said is true. All I said is actually valuable feedback. That's exactly how things are, really. But as a joke, to summarize, you said three things. Hype, chart, go up, leverage and then fud. So as a summary.
01:12:43.094 - 01:12:55.558, Speaker A: No, nothing. Boom. Again. And you know what, guys? That's funny. If I'm lucky, right, I gotta go through it several times. If I'm lucky, you know?
01:12:55.606 - 01:12:55.838, Speaker B: Right.
01:12:55.886 - 01:13:30.218, Speaker A: Yeah. If I'm lucky, then you. If. If as a founder, you're lucky, right? You gotta go through it several times, you know, and ideally just get better at it every time, you know? Ideally, you know, if you don't manage that cycle well, you die, you know? I feel like, like, I mean, amazing respect, right, to people like butter lig or toli or these guys, right? Because they went through, like, it's very easy to die in those cycles, right. When there's no hype, it's very easy for a team to just demoralize and just give up. When there's too much hype, it's very easy to, it's very easy to just go, I'm the best, blah. And then just like, and just get caught up and just like.
01:13:30.218 - 01:13:33.042, Speaker A: And just do too much. Right. If we've seen many, many times.
01:13:33.138 - 01:13:33.346, Speaker B: Right.
01:13:33.370 - 01:13:33.650, Speaker A: You know?
01:13:33.682 - 01:13:33.970, Speaker B: Right.
01:13:34.042 - 01:13:49.280, Speaker A: And then when comes. That's where you just give out. Ah, I suck. Right. So I feel like being able to. I feel like, like my very deep respect, right. You know, to people like Bertha Lique and Toli and many others in the space who just, like, who survived this cycle and just live many times, right.
01:13:49.280 - 01:14:00.120, Speaker A: It's just amazing. So for me, I'm like, okay, you know what? Even as I'm going through this thing right now, it's kind of tricky. But I appreciate the fact that there has been so many people before that did well. Yeah, that's it. Happy with that.
01:14:00.272 - 01:14:03.112, Speaker C: Do you have any final thoughts that you would like to share with our audience?
01:14:03.168 - 01:14:20.750, Speaker A: Miao, final thoughts? No. I mean, thanks, everyone, for paying attention to Jupiter. I hope you watch the whole thing. I hope you don't. You know, I hope you try the product. I hope you talk to us on Twitter or discord. You know, I hope you are fair.
01:14:20.750 - 01:14:30.374, Speaker A: I hope you. I hope to get to know you, you know? Yeah, I think. And it's a long game. It's a very long game. And we intend to be here for a long time.
01:14:30.534 - 01:14:30.806, Speaker B: Right.
01:14:30.830 - 01:14:36.006, Speaker A: You know? Yeah. So, yeah. And I'm sure we'll have many chance to interact. Yeah.
01:14:36.030 - 01:14:55.694, Speaker C: That's all fantastic. Well, meow. Again, great to have you on. We learned a lot. I certainly have gained a different perspective on the ins and outs of Jupiter and both you as a founder. So it's been a great conversation and looking forward to what happens to Jupiter next.
01:14:56.114 - 01:14:56.974, Speaker A: Me too.
01:14:58.874 - 01:15:04.506, Speaker D: That was a hysteric laugh. You're not really looking forward. You're like, fuck, me too.
01:15:04.530 - 01:15:05.274, Speaker A: Me too. I'm looking forward to it.
