00:00:05.200 - 00:00:14.008, Speaker A: Here we are with Justin Drake, one of the top researchers at the Ethereum Foundation. Justin, welcome to the Defiant podcast. It's great to have you here.
00:00:14.144 - 00:00:15.432, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, Camila.
00:00:15.496 - 00:00:50.960, Speaker A: Awesome. So, like I was saying, really excited to have you on the podcast again this time, right after DEFCON in Bangkok. It was such an incredible DEF CON for me, I think, you know, I haven't been to all of them obviously, but I've been to a couple and this one to me just felt like the best. It just like the amount of energy, it blew my mind to see the number of people there. Like, to me, it just like, really it was a showcase of the strength of Ethereum community.
00:00:52.300 - 00:01:27.156, Speaker C: And one of the main announcements to come out of DEFCON was your talk about a proposal for a new Ethereum consensus layer called the Beam Chain. So I'd love to just dig really deep into what this means, the different technical features. So, yeah, maybe we can just start from the beginning. Let's maybe take a step back and talk about why you felt the need to, to make this proposal. What is it looking to achieve and solve?
00:01:27.268 - 00:02:18.096, Speaker B: Right. So I've been spending the last few months looking at the broader picture when it comes to the Ethereum roadmap, and I noticed that there were some items that were extremely ambitious where the ambition of the roadmap didn't match the pace of change of Ethereum Layer one. So the way that we traditionally do upgrades to Ethereum is through forks, and those have happened once per year since Genesis. And when we do those forks, generally speaking, we add a small feature. So we've added withdrawals, we've added the sync committee. We're going to do Max eb. One of the forks was also the merge where we connected the EVM with the Beacon chain.
00:02:18.096 - 00:03:38.980, Speaker B: And what I'm a little bit worried is that in the path that we're currently going down is going to take decades, potentially 20 years to complete the roadmap. And I've been thinking of ways to basically pour some acceleration as fuel on the roadmap to try and get the whole thing completed within roughly five years. And so what I'm basically proposing with the Beam chain is, is a rewrite of the consensus layer, which uses the latest and greatest ideas from research. But instead of starting from the beacon chain and applying incremental upgrades, which is somewhat difficult and only really possible for small incremental changes, instead just taking a clean slate from scratch approach. And one of the benefits here is that we can get rid of a lot of technical debt that is slowing us down and that is preventing us from making these big changes. And then another interesting aspect of it is what I call basically a governance batching optimization. So in order to make changes to the L1, we have to go through this whole process, which is extremely expensive.
00:03:38.980 - 00:04:45.572, Speaker B: So there needs to be research and then spec writing, and then you need to propose an eip and then there's going to be multiple or core dev calls and then there's a process of arguing overall priorities, which EIP should go first. And then when an EIP does get selected, there's a whole pipeline around testing, so there's devnets and testnets and, and audits and all of these things. And that is just a very, very expensive process that we have to do every time we do a fork. And so if we need to do 10 forks, let's say that's going to take 10 years and it's going to be very slow. What if instead we batch everything together into a single fork so that we only have to go through this process once? Maybe the testing and due diligence process will be especially long and robust because it's a bigger change. But ultimately the slow and messy human part is minimized and we try and maximize the ability to just push technology at layer one.
00:04:45.676 - 00:05:06.792, Speaker A: So is this similar to what happened with the merge, where there was a separate beacon chain and that replaced proof of work with proof of stake? Now you will be creating a separate beam chain and that will replace the current consensus layer.
00:05:06.936 - 00:06:12.050, Speaker B: So there are similarities, but there's also big differences. So with the merge, basically we completely changed the set of consensus participants. So we went from proof of work miners to proof of stake stakers, validators, and as you said, there was this period of time where there's two chains that had to be merged, the two chains running in parallel. This time the situation is similar in the sense that it is a big change, but it's also dissimilar in the sense that we're not changing the set of consensus participants, so we're keeping the validators on both sides of the fork. And that means that it's actually much more amenable to do a normal fork. So what does that mean? It means that we would choose a slot number and at that slot number we would do the the change of rules, just like we've done with all the other previous folks. And the reason why I say would be, by the way, is that at this point in time, this is just a proposal.
00:06:12.050 - 00:06:47.786, Speaker B: In order for this proposal to achieve rough consensus and Go to mainnet. We're going to need broad acceptance from the researchers, from the devs and the wider community. Now, I did a bunch of legwork before devcon presenting to the developers and to the researchers. And I think broadly speaking, directionally there is acceptance there, but now there is a whole process of gathering feedback from the wider community and trying to get full acceptance there as well.
00:06:47.858 - 00:06:54.430, Speaker A: Okay, so let's talk about the technical features included in the beam chain.
00:06:56.290 - 00:07:05.722, Speaker C: That will enable Ethereum to reach kind of its end state, like the end state of the roadmap that you're talking about.
00:07:05.826 - 00:07:45.578, Speaker B: Right. So where we are at today, there's about nine different items in the roadmap that we'd like to push forward. And those are basically described in Vitalik's roadmap diagram, which is very big and quite complicated. And so what I've done is that I've started with this roadmap diagram and taken the subset of upgrades that are relevant specifically to the consensus layer. What I call the consensus layer is specifically excluding the data layer. That would be dank sharding and the blobs. It's also excluding the execution layer and the evm.
00:07:45.578 - 00:08:35.432, Speaker B: So the firm virtual machine. What the consensus layer is all about is basically having the validators vote and agree on the, on the tip of the chain. And what we want there is the most secure, the most robust foundations for the Internet of value. And so in some sense the consensus layer is all about health. Right? It's not about performance, it's really about maximizing robustness. Now we can go through like one by one, these nine different upgrades to, but if you zoom out, there's basically two categories of upgrades. There's four, there are actually five of these upgrades that I think can be done and probably should be done incrementally within the next few years.
00:08:35.432 - 00:09:23.966, Speaker B: And then there's the big ticket items that I think are much harder to do incrementally and more suited to be done in this from scratch, holistic approach. Now the reason why I highlight these two things is because if we were to go with this beam chain proposal for a period of time, there would be two parallel R and D tracks, there would be the current development track with the beacon chain over the next, call it three, four years. And then in roughly four years, let's call it, take all of the timelines with a huge grain of salt, we, we would have this big fork, the beam fork, that would bring on mainnet the rest of the big ticket items.
00:09:24.078 - 00:09:30.846, Speaker C: Okay, so let's go through first the incremental changes and then we can review the big ticket items.
00:09:30.958 - 00:10:08.290, Speaker B: Okay, great. So I've just opened up the consensus layer roadmap that highlights the nine items and the way that they're structured is in three different buckets. We have the block production bucket, the staking bucket, and the cryptography bucket. And the incremental changes fall under block production and staking. In block production, we have two. The first one is censorship resistance. So we want to make sure that even if the current proposer and winning builder and relay decide to censor, we can still get transactions on chain.
00:10:08.290 - 00:11:11.870, Speaker B: And the best proposal that we have here is called fossil. And the basic idea is that in any given slot we will have 16 different validators who will propose inclusion lists. So these are transactions that have to be included in the next lot by the next proposer and builder. And so even if there's extremely high centralization at the builder layer, we, we would still have the ability for the validators to force transaction inclusion on chain. And then the second incremental upgrade under the block production pipeline, which is related to mev, is this notion of isolating the validators from the centralization forces of the MEV pipeline. So in order to build an optimal block, you have to be extremely sophisticated. And what we want is to make sure that the validators are not sophisticated.
00:11:11.870 - 00:12:32.954, Speaker B: And today the validators do play a very small role in choosing which blocks go on chain, namely that they connect to the relays and then they sign the very top bid from the builders, and that will lead to a block going on chain. But even like this little process of signing this top bid blindly can lead to sophistication. So for example, we've seen timing games basically where the validators try and delay when they sign this top bid in order to get a little bit more mev. And there's all sorts of other issues related to, for example, the high volatility of MEV as well as the sophistication that comes with pre confirmation. So there's been a lot of research this year around this notion of pre confirmations, which allows for transactions to be immediately pre confirmed so that users don't have to wait until those transactions get included in the next block. But that comes with more sophistication for the validator. So all of that stuff we can isolate completely with what we call a tester proposer separation.
00:12:32.954 - 00:13:25.882, Speaker B: All of this is a lot of jargon, but basically it's about improving again, the health of the network by reducing the sophistication required for the validators. And then in the second bucket, in the staking bucket, we have two suggested improvements. The first one being having smarter issuance. So right now, the issuance curve that we have is effectively forcing any rational ETH holder to become a validator. And this is going to lead to a very, very high percentage of all the ETH being staked. And that comes with various negative externalities. The first one is that we worry that raw ETH pristine ETH may lose its dominance as a unit of account.
00:13:25.882 - 00:14:27.696, Speaker B: Instead, what we might see is wrappers around staked eth, so, for example, steth from lido becoming dominant as a unit of account. And unfortunately, these wrappers dramatically weaken the credible neutrality of the assets because they add new security assumptions. There could be contract bugs, there's governance risk. There's also a branding issue where we're moving away from raw ETH and adding these staking protocols as brands. And so if we could change the issuance curve to cap the amount of ETH staked, for example, around 25% or 50%, that would mitigate this risk. And then the second issue with everyone staking is that we would be overpaying for security. And the way that we pay for security is through issuance, and that has a real world cost.
00:14:27.696 - 00:15:58.274, Speaker B: So, for example, as a staker, when you receive issuance, you get taxed on this issuance, and that leads to billions of dollars per year of sell pressure on eth, which is something that we could remove to a very large extent. And then there's also an opportunity to improve the mimetics of efa, the asset, by reducing the issuance and basically very, very likely bringing it lower than the burn, which would mean that the total supply of ETH would go down and it would make ETH ultrasound money. And this would kind of a differentiator from a memetic standpoint, relative to the competition, such as Bitcoin. And then there's the final item, which would be done incrementally under the staking bucket, which is the smaller validator. So today we have what I call whale staking, where you need to have 32 ETH to become a validator, which is about $100,000. And this is the main bottleneck for many of the smaller ETH holders to become validators. And so instead, what if we just had one ETH as the minimum deposit to become a validator? So all of these upgrades I'm hoping will happen over the next few years, and then we would be left with the big ticket items, which are Colored in red here in the roadmap.
00:15:58.322 - 00:16:05.510, Speaker A: Okay, so let's spend a bit more time in these two big buckets. Block production and staking.
00:16:06.170 - 00:16:19.156, Speaker C: So with block production, is the end result to have faster confirmation time, faster finality?
00:16:19.268 - 00:17:31.376, Speaker B: No, so faster finality would be a performance metric. A lot of the chains out there, like Solana for example, are competing on having extremely short slot times. And this leads to faster confirmation and better ux. But it has a big downside that it makes it harder for a validator to join in, especially if you're on a home Internet connection. And that ultimately weakens decentralization. So the strategy that Ethereum is taking instead is to keep the slot durations relatively high, maybe 4 seconds or 8 seconds, or even the current 12 seconds, and focus on what we call pre confirmations. A pre confirmation is when a user sends their transaction ahead of the slot boundary to the next proposer and asks them, hey, can you please make a promise that you will include my transaction at the slot boundary? And the nice thing about preconfirmations is that the UX has a latency proportional to the ping time.
00:17:31.376 - 00:18:10.990, Speaker B: So if the user is, let's say, 100 milliseconds away from the sequencer, well, the total round trip latency would be 2 times 100 milliseconds. So 200 milliseconds in order to get your transaction preconfirmed. And this is optimal, you can't go faster than the speed of the Internet. And it would allow us to simultaneously have better UX and Solana because you can think of the slot durations being reduced to just milliseconds and simultaneously be able to keep the decentralization that makes Ethereum very unique.
00:18:11.490 - 00:18:15.706, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay, so I was, I guess confused.
00:18:15.898 - 00:18:30.114, Speaker C: With just like seeing the key takeaways from your presentation. One of them was four second slot time. So where did that kind of conclusion come from?
00:18:30.202 - 00:19:38.936, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So when we designed the beacon chain, we picked 12 second slot times, and this was picked to be very, very conservative because we didn't know exactly how many validators we would have, and we didn't know how the network would behave when we had very large amounts of validators. So today we have a million validators, and 12 seconds is more than enough to very comfortably handle all these million validators. Now the good news is that over the last five years we've discovered all sorts of optimizations that mean that we could comfortably reduce this load duration while still keeping the requirement that to become a validator you can be on a home Internet connection. With high latency. So for example, you could be in Australia, rural Australia, and have very high ping times and still be able to participate. So this proposal of reducing slot times to four seconds is just a matter of picking up the low hanging fruit that we didn't pick up originally when we designed the beacon chain.
00:19:39.048 - 00:19:52.040, Speaker A: I see. Okay. Okay. So right now reducing slot time to four seconds, again, it's just like responding to technological advancements that allow stakers or.
00:19:52.080 - 00:20:17.910, Speaker C: Validators to have all the decentralization requirements even within that time. But what you were saying, what actually makes the UX better and faster is the pre confirmation part of this upgrade is that you'd be able to get your transaction confirmed in the time that it takes to confirm ping a validator.
00:20:18.070 - 00:21:00.180, Speaker B: Yes. The one thing that I would stress though is that pre confirmations do not require an upgrade. Pre confirmations is something that we can do on the network as it exists today. And actually on the very last day of Defcon on November 15, the very first pre confirmation landed on Mainnet. So it was a proof of concept and there was a culmination of 30 different teams working together a week prior at something called sequencing week. And yeah, this has been a massive effort all of this year, both from a research perspective, but also from a development perspective to get these pre confirmations out of the door.
00:21:00.260 - 00:21:05.300, Speaker A: Oh great. Okay, so, and I guess like this.
00:21:05.340 - 00:21:31.080, Speaker C: Is a bit of the original question of like going through each update. But just to stay on this pre confirmation topic, do you think this would be then implemented sooner than. Since it doesn't need an upgrade, it could be implemented at any time.
00:21:31.200 - 00:22:07.570, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And it's already implemented for almost all of the rollups out there. So if you take Arbitrum for example, it has 250 millisecond preconfirmation. If you look at the superchain, which consists of op, mainnet and Vase, they have two second pre confirmation times. And one of the things that I've been advocating for is so called base rollups where the sequencer is the same decentralized sequencer as the L1. And here the pre conformations are technically more challenging. And this is what the proof of concept at layer one was all about.
00:22:07.570 - 00:23:02.738, Speaker B: And the reason is that right now the pre confirmations that are done by Arbitrum and the superchain are based on reputation. So you have a centralized sequencer and they're basically giving you a pinky promise that your transaction will be included in the next batch that goes on chain. But in the context of decentralized sequencing pinky promises don't work very well and instead you need preconfirmations that are based on cryptoeconomics. And the idea here is that the sequencer would put forward collateral and if they don't honor their promise, then they get slashed. Another type of preconfirmation, just as a side note worth mentioning, is Unichain. So Unichain is proposing to have 250 millisecond pre confirmation and that uses yet another technology, which is tes, so trusted hardware, in order to get those pre confirmations.
00:23:02.834 - 00:23:03.874, Speaker C: Oh, interesting.
00:23:04.002 - 00:23:08.498, Speaker A: Okay, but are these Pre confirmations for.
00:23:08.634 - 00:23:12.514, Speaker C: Layer 2s or are they also included in Ethereum Mainnet?
00:23:12.562 - 00:23:52.930, Speaker B: Yeah, fantastic question. So definitely all of the layer 2s will want preconfirmations, and most of them have them today. But the cool thing is that we can also have preconfirmations for the L1. Now, it turns out that there's two types of preconfirmations. There's what's called execution preconfirmations, where you know exactly how your transaction will execute. So for example, if you're making a uniswap trade, you'll know exactly what price you're getting and what fees you're paying all upfront. And then there's the weaker type of preconfirmation, which is called an inclusion preconfirmation, where the only thing that you know is that your transaction will be included, but you don't know exactly how it will execute.
00:23:52.930 - 00:24:13.260, Speaker B: Now, unfortunately, the best that we can do is in terms of providing pre confirmations, that every slot for the L1 is the weaker type of inclusion pre confirmations. But my expectation is that almost all user activity will move to the L2s and they'll be able to enjoy the better form of preconfirmation, which is the.
00:24:13.300 - 00:24:23.764, Speaker A: Execution pre confirmation and any timeline on when pre confirmations will be included in L1 and. And L2s as well.
00:24:23.852 - 00:24:26.852, Speaker B: Yeah, so the L2s already have execution pre confirmations.
00:24:26.916 - 00:24:27.924, Speaker A: Oh, right, yeah, you mentioned.
00:24:27.972 - 00:24:53.462, Speaker B: So that's Arbitrum and Superchain and all of the other rollups. And we're also going to see base rollups have these execution preconfirmations next year. In terms of the L1 inclusion pre confirmations, I think it's happening this year. So there's a project, for example, called Bolt from Chainbound, and they're specifically focusing on these L1 preconfirmations in the short term and they're making huge progress.
00:24:53.606 - 00:25:15.254, Speaker D: Protocol 20 introduces Sorobond, which is Stellar's cutting edge smart contracts. Platform. This creates new surface area for innovation and provides new opportunities for developers to build protocols and products that create access to everyday financial services. So it means a gradual increase in transaction capacity and a chance to fine tune applications. And it's the most transformative upgrade to the stellar network to date.
00:25:15.382 - 00:25:16.330, Speaker B: Woohoo.
00:25:17.150 - 00:25:21.270, Speaker A: Okay, super interesting. Then quick follow up question on the.
00:25:21.310 - 00:26:02.266, Speaker C: Staking bucket of features. I guess what I didn't quite get is that on the one hand you were talking about how you want to reduce the amount of ETH staked. Right. But on the other hand you're also pushing for a reduced amount of ETH required. So it seems like those two things are incompatible. Like if, you know, if you lower the threshold to 1 from 32, then more people will be able to stake.
00:26:02.378 - 00:26:40.034, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. So I guess one is related to quantity and the other one's related to quality. So by having a stake capping, by changing the issuance, we're basically reducing the quantity of eth. But what we're hoping will happen is that those that do choose to stake will be the smaller, more decentralized, more diverse validators. And effectively, if we have lots of solar validators coming in, they would push out some of the bigger validators who, who for which the value proposition of staking might not be as attractive.
00:26:40.162 - 00:26:59.522, Speaker A: So with this issuance cap, how would that effectively work? So it would be like an amount of ETH that is the maximum that can be issued to reward stakers. And so what happens to liquid stakers like Lido?
00:26:59.586 - 00:27:04.284, Speaker C: They'd have to mean would that kind of affect their business model?
00:27:04.412 - 00:27:58.630, Speaker B: Basically the way that issuance works is with a curve that describes the amount of issuance for a given amount of ETH staked. And right now what we have is that the curve is always above 2%. Sorry, 2% APR. So even if 100% of all eth is staked, there would still be kind of this 2% APR instead with stake capping. The idea is that past a certain threshold, let's say 50% of all ETH, the issuance would be zero. So the issuance curve would kind of go all the way down to zero. And what would likely happen is that past this point there wouldn't be any new stakers that would come in and some of the stakers might even choose to unstake.
00:27:58.630 - 00:28:50.006, Speaker B: Now in terms of the impact for LSTs like Lido. Yes. Basically what will happen is that the total revenue that they're gaining, which is basically a cut of the Nominal issuance would go down. So right now they're taking a 10% cut out of all of the rewards that the stakers get. And if there's just overall less rewards for everyone, then basically their revenue would go down. And so this is why there's a little kind of spicy emoji next to it, in the sense that it is not a pure technological proposal. It has implications from an economic standpoint.
00:28:50.006 - 00:29:24.674, Speaker B: And so it's going to be one of the more controversial changes to do. But ultimately, I think it is kind of a big win for Ethereum and a big win for the ETH holders. And I think ultimately it's a healthy change to do. But it's one that is controversial, I guess, for two reasons. The first one is that changing the issuance is always a delicate topic, regardless of what the issuance change is. But secondly, it does affect the economics of. Of players like LSTs.
00:29:24.802 - 00:29:27.890, Speaker A: Wow, super interesting. And again, the reason to propose this.
00:29:27.930 - 00:29:50.340, Speaker C: Is because in your view, right now Ethereum is overpaying for security, like it doesn't need as much security, and people are staking because of this apr. So it makes sense for you to cap that those rewards at, at the level where, you know, Ethereum needs security, but not more than that.
00:29:50.450 - 00:30:26.700, Speaker B: Yeah, and there's a little bit of a tragedy of the commons. Just let's imagine as a fourth experiment that all the ETH is staking, then what will happen is that everyone would get diluted equally by the rewards that they get, and so no one is gaining anything. And actually it's even worse than that because some of the rewards that you get have to be paid and sold for taxes. And so ultimately we would all be losing money all the time, the whole ecosystem, which is not an end game that anyone would want.
00:30:27.240 - 00:30:41.872, Speaker A: Right. Super interesting. Okay, yeah, that should get spicy then. Okay, so then, yeah, let's move to the next set of upgrades.
00:30:42.016 - 00:31:39.858, Speaker B: Sure. So the big four items which are relevant to the beam chain, because those would be the new ones that are brought forward, are the really tough ones that I think are difficult to do in a short amount of time unless we have this clean state approach. And the four of them are number one chain snorkification. So the idea here is that in real time, for every single consensus block, we would have a cryptographic proof that proves that the block is valid. And so for anyone that is consuming Ethereum, whether you're a wallet or block explorer or bridge from an L1 or even a validator, and you want to sync to the chain and know that it's valid. All you have to do is verify this snark proof. And so one of the memes, for example, is that you would be able to be a validator on your smartwatch.
00:31:39.858 - 00:32:32.820, Speaker B: You wouldn't need to run these expensive full nodes on your computer. But in order to have this real time snarkification, we need to change a lot of the internals of the consensus layer to make them friendly to snarks. So we need to change the hash function, we need to change the signature scheme, we need to change the way that we serialize and merkle data, all of these technical stuff that just needs to be done. And it's a rather big fork. The second big upgrade is quantum security. So a lot of the cryptography that we use today, especially the BLS signatures, will get broken eventually once we have powerful enough quantum computers. And this is something that your followers might not appreciate, but in 2024, we've had massive breakthroughs in quantum computing.
00:32:32.820 - 00:33:38.196, Speaker B: And one of the leading experts and commentators in quantum computing, Scott Aronson, for a very long time was somewhat skeptical on whether or not he would even see quantum computing within his lifetime, is now saying that either we're getting practical quantum computers within the next 10 years, or we're going to learn something fundamentally new about the laws of physics. And so he's basically very, very bullish on the development of quantum computers within the next decade. But thanks to some of these big breakthroughs that have happened this year, and upgrading the cryptography takes many, many years. And so now is a good time to get started. The third big ticket item is this notion called single slot finality. This is something that has been discussed for many, many years. Today, finality on the firm is a process that takes a long time.
00:33:38.196 - 00:34:24.340, Speaker B: It takes more than 10 minutes. And this affects the UX, for example, of depositing into exchanges. So if you deposit funds into an exchange, they might wait until the chain finalizes, and that takes a long time. It also affects L2s. And the reason is that L2s have a mechanism to force include transactions, and they can only safely force include those transactions once the chain is stable enough. And one way to do it is just to wait for finality. Then there's a fourth item which I guess we've already discussed, which is this idea of having faster slots.
00:34:24.340 - 00:35:36.686, Speaker B: So today the beacon chain wasn't really designed with this performance first mindset. And if we are going to shorten the slots, we're going to have to change the architecture of the Beacon chain. But yeah, zooming out. What I'm trying to do here is to complete the entire roadmap in a reasonable amount of time, call it four or five years, so that Ethereum can go into maintenance mode and achieve what I call pre ossification, where there are no longer any big changes that need to be done to Ethereum layer one and we can enter this maintenance mode. And one of the memes I guess that I have is ossification accelerationism. So that might sound like an oxymoron, but the basic idea is that we would accelerate the timelines and the point at which we can say, hey, Ethereum is essentially done and now we can start thinking about ossification, maybe in a similar way that Bitcoin thinks about ossification.
00:35:36.798 - 00:35:37.278, Speaker A: Got it.
00:35:37.334 - 00:36:18.400, Speaker C: Okay, now just double clicking on just like. Or maybe summarizing what the implications for these three big changes are. So the first one was snarkification, and the takeaway there is that will allow for validators to just require a snark proof of the chain. You can run an Ethereum node without needing so much hardware or memory. Or like you said on a smartwatch.
00:36:18.900 - 00:36:51.624, Speaker B: Exactly. Another use case would be users of MetaMask, for example. So when you use a wallet like MetaMask, you're trusting in intermediary, for example, Infura in the case of MetaMask, to tell you what the valid chain is. And so it's a fully trusted relationship. And instead we could change that completely and just have the wallets verify the snarks directly. So this is the notion of a light client, but it's a fully validating light client. The best type of light client that you could hope for.
00:36:51.712 - 00:37:02.910, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay, and then the reason to do that is, would be to make Ethereum more decentralized, like you'd have more. You'd lower the barrier of entry to validators.
00:37:03.070 - 00:37:17.086, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. And then another kind of interesting use case is a trustless bridges between L1s. So let's say that we want to build a trustless bridge between Solana and Ethereum or Bitcoin and Ethereum. This could be done with these snark proofs.
00:37:17.198 - 00:37:21.050, Speaker A: Trustless bridge. So what exactly is that?
00:37:21.670 - 00:37:25.342, Speaker C: Yeah, and we don't have to go so deep. That's like a whole other thing, I.
00:37:25.366 - 00:37:27.100, Speaker A: Guess, but just to understand.
00:37:27.400 - 00:38:31.078, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So let's say that you have some assets, for example, BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain, and you want to bridge it onto Ethereum so that you can use it in lending Markets or whatever it is. The way that it's done today is to use a trusted bridge. So you have some entity, for example Bitgo, that is creating the wrapped btc, wbtc and all of the funds could just go poof from one day to another just because Bitco could just steal all the funds or something bad could happen Instead. What you'd like ideally is a bridge where you're not trusting anyone, any human or any company. And in order to do that you need Ethereum to be aware of Bitcoin and Bitcoin to be aware of Ethereum. And because blockchains are so resource constrained, the, you know, they can't just run a full node.
00:38:31.078 - 00:39:00.930, Speaker B: You can't run a full node of Ethereum on Bitcoin. But what you could do potentially is verify a snob proof on Bitcoin that proves that the state of Ethereum is such and such. And like recently we've seen this project called BitVM on Bitcoin which basically allows for the verification of those snarks on Bitcoin. And that could potentially lead to a trustless two way bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum.
00:39:01.010 - 00:39:14.556, Speaker A: Oh wow, that'd be awesome. Very cool. Okay, so that's snarkification and then quantum security basically is ensuring that Ethereum doesn't break with the advancements of quantum computing.
00:39:14.668 - 00:39:59.850, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. Specifically the consensus layer. So we wouldn't be touching the execution layer. So if you hold eth in a typical Ethereum address that uses a cryptography called ECDSA in the background and that would be not post quantum secure. The good news is that in order to provide post quantum security at the EVM layer, you can use what's called account abstraction. So you can create wallets and addresses where the signature scheme is fully decided by the user. And so the user could choose to use post quantum cryptography there without needing a hard fork at layer one.
00:40:00.390 - 00:40:06.882, Speaker C: And then the last one was, you said single slot finality.
00:40:07.026 - 00:40:07.970, Speaker B: Yes, correct.
00:40:08.050 - 00:40:08.626, Speaker A: Okay.
00:40:08.738 - 00:40:15.150, Speaker C: And that was all about what we talked about before, reducing the slot time.
00:40:16.090 - 00:41:06.518, Speaker B: So it's about reducing the depth of the reorgs. So what happens from time to time is that the chain reorgs. So some of the blocks that were posted on chain kind of get rolled back in some sense and then there has a new, a new history that gets written. And one of the things that we're quite worried about is this notion of deep reorgs. So imagine an attacker is able to rewrite large chunk of Ethereum history. And so to prevent these rewrites we have what's called economic finality, which basically says that if an attacker tries to do these deep reorgs, they will lose a lot of money. And the amount that they would lose at minimum is one third of all of the ETH staked.
00:41:06.518 - 00:41:45.410, Speaker B: So there's about $100 billion of ETH staked. That's what we call the economic security. And one third of it would be roughly $33 billion, unfortunately. So this $33 billion is very, very good. It's a huge amount of defenses against these re orgs. But unfortunately the tip of the chain, meaning the most recent part of the chain, is still subject to reorgs. And what faster finality gives us is that it shrinks the part of the chain which is subject to these reorgs to just a few slots.
00:41:45.410 - 00:42:19.520, Speaker B: Technically it's three slots. And yeah, the term single slot finality is a little bit confusing because what it means is that at every slot there is a new block which is finalized. So the throughput is one block per slot, but the latency is actually three slots, meaning that the block that actually gets finalized is three slots old. Basically what this fastifi gives us is that it limits the opportunity to reorg to just a few slots at the tip of the chain.
00:42:19.680 - 00:42:39.548, Speaker A: And these three changes are the ones that you said are the big ticket ones and are needed in a, in an upgrade. But the other ones that we were discussing before, the ones around block production and staking, could those be implemented sooner?
00:42:39.644 - 00:42:56.710, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. So for example, for the censorship resistance with Fossil, we already have an eip so we've already started the process of proposing a change and hopefully that will be included not in the next fork because that the contents of the next fork has been finalized, but hopefully in the fork after that.
00:42:56.830 - 00:43:53.948, Speaker A: Supra is an all new blockchain that vertically integrates native oracles, bridges, automation and randomness into one powerful layer, one with multi VM compatibility. Supra boasts an impressive 530,000 tps throughput with 500ms. Optimistic finality and a three tier parallel extension execution strategy. Super enables a new breed of super DAPPS with shared security in protocol, Oracle, price feeds, automation, cross chain communication and on chain randomness, giving you all you need to build, trade and play in one chain. Is the beam chain a concept of like once all of these features and updates are included, that's what is called a beam chain. But not necessarily all of these changes need a beam chain upgrade?
00:43:54.044 - 00:44:44.544, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. So we'll be able to provide real value in the next few years with upgrades like Fossil, that gives us this better censorship resistance. We technically don't need the beam chain for that. What the beam chain is, is kind of the completion of the full roadmap and is going to require new clients to be written. So today we have five teams that have written like five different consensus clients. And each of these teams have kind of signaled interest in building a Beam client. And the other thing that has happened is that over the last week or so, we've had seven other teams also express interest in building a Beam client.
00:44:44.544 - 00:45:15.964, Speaker B: So we have these potentially 12 different teams that would be implementing these new consensus rules. And because it's kind of this from scratch approach, it means that a lot of the legacy Beacon clients can be deprecated. So a lot of the code and a lot of the complexity can be jettisoned and we can stay with a very, very clean code base where a lot of the technical debt is just erased from one day to another.
00:45:16.052 - 00:45:47.612, Speaker A: Okay, and that's interesting because one of the main criticisms after your talk was how long these changes would take, like five to seven years. So I think it's good to add that caveat that not all of these changes, changes require five years. It's kind of the completion of this whole roadmap that may take that. Right. But you can start implementing things gradually along the way.
00:45:47.716 - 00:46:36.980, Speaker B: Exactly. So for the consensus layer, there would be four incremental and gradual upgrades that would happen before the beam fork. Now, I don't know where this number five to seven years came from, because what I actually suggested in my Talk was a four year roadmap. So basically it would be from 2025 to 2029. And I've tried to be relatively realistic. As I mentioned, a lot of preparation work went in this proposal, talking to the various developers. And actually from the point of view of the developers, four years is somewhat ambitious for such a big fork.
00:46:36.980 - 00:47:26.008, Speaker B: But yeah, I do acknowledge that the community was disappointed by the long timelines and hopefully four years is a realistic timeline. The other thing that I want to highlight is that Ethereum layer one is made out of these three different layers that I mentioned at the beginning of the podcast. There's the consensus layer, but there's also the data layer, and there's also the execution layer. And the data and execution layer are going to evolve gradually as well. So for the data layer, it's basically all about increasing the bytes per second that we can push through Ethereum and we have this notion of blobs. So these big Data blobs. And today we have a target of three blobs per slot.
00:47:26.008 - 00:48:30.820, Speaker B: And the idea is to grow that roughly 40x to 128 blobs per slot within the next five years. Call it, and this is known as dank sharding. And this is not going to happen in one big upgrade where we suddenly increase things by 40x. Instead, you should think of it as maybe doubling by a factor of two every year, roughly speaking, until we get to that number. And then on the execution side of things, one of the things that I'm very excited about is snarkifying the evm. So there's a lot of progress within the industry on what's called ZK VMs. So a ZK VM is a piece of technology that allows essentially any developer in the world to make use of the power of snarks without having to be a snark expert or a cryptography expert.
00:48:30.820 - 00:49:08.008, Speaker B: And in particular the existing execution client team. So that's GEF and REF and BISU and various others, Aragon, that are not cryptography experts. They can compile their code bases down to the ZK VMs. And the ZK VMs will do all of the heavy lifting on their behalf. And once we've snugified the vm, we'll be in a position where we can do two things that are very exciting. The first thing is that we'll be able to increase the gas limit. And the reason is that the gas limit is there to protect the validators.
00:49:08.008 - 00:50:12.718, Speaker B: But if the validators only have to verify these very, very cheap snot proofs, they won't be exposed to this attack vector where someone provides a very big block with a lot of execution and they get overwhelmed by the amount of work that they have to do to validate the block. And then the other really interesting thing is something called native rollups. So once we've snarkified the evm, we can expose within the EVM a pre compile that would allow anyone to deploy an exact copy of the EVM as an L2 as a rollup. And so that would allow us to scale the EVM horizontally. So it's very reminiscent to what's called execution sharding, where there was a proposal to have, for example, 64 copies of the EVM. While here with native rollups, we can have as many copies as the community wants. And each copy can also be customized.
00:50:12.718 - 00:50:19.550, Speaker B: So you can have its own fee token, it can have its own governance mechanism, it can have its own sequencer et Cetera.
00:50:19.630 - 00:50:20.878, Speaker A: Oh, very interesting.
00:50:20.974 - 00:51:28.726, Speaker C: Okay, so like you were saying, the beam chain is all about the consensus layer. You mentioned two other layers of Ethereum data and execution with the evm. With the data, the main thing are increased blobs or data that's included in each block to 40x in the next five years. And then in the execution layer, the main change that you're looking at, that you're excited about is also snarkification. We talked about snarkification of the chain, but also snarkification of the evm. Really interesting the implications of what that snarkification could do. I guess having the ability to execute just with a snark proof gives a lot more flexibility to developers.
00:51:28.726 - 00:51:53.956, Speaker C: To the point of maybe going back to the very initial Ethereum vision of having shards. But now Ethereum wouldn't be constrained to 64 shards, it would be more than that. Like an unlimited number of shards which are like mini Ethereum chains.
00:51:54.078 - 00:51:57.020, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. You said it beautifully.
00:51:58.080 - 00:52:01.480, Speaker A: Great. Okay. And then beyond that they would be.
00:52:01.520 - 00:52:08.936, Speaker C: More customizable, which is super interesting. It kind of sounds a bit like what Polkadot was trying to do or is trying to do.
00:52:09.008 - 00:52:58.830, Speaker B: Yes. And this is more in line with the ethos of Ethereum. Right. Ethereum is all about providing the most basic building blocks and allowing builders to build whatever their creativity allows them to build. And so here, instead of being very top down and saying there's going to be exactly 64 shards and they're going to have to be exact copies of the L1, we're allowing for more customizability. And in particular what this allows is for the existing L2s that have an existing ecosystem to upgrade their virtual machine to an exact copy of the L1 EVM. Because what is happening today for the the top roll ups arbitrum optimism base, they're trying to be EVM equivalent, but it's a very, very big lift technically to be EVM equivalent.
00:52:58.830 - 00:53:38.052, Speaker B: And more likely than not there's going to be bugs, so there's going to be places in which they're not exactly EVM equivalent. And also there is an issue of keeping track with changes to the L1 EVM. So the L1 EVM is a living beast in some sense. Every time there's a fork we can have a new opcode. And the way that the L2s keep track of these changes is using governance. So their token governance will vote in changes to reflect and mirror the L1 EVM. And once we have this pre compiled, that allows you to have an exact copy of the L1.
00:53:38.052 - 00:53:58.896, Speaker B: We can remove the bugs and then we can remove the governance, which is in and of itself a potential attack vector for the rollup. And so we'll really be in a position where roll ups can truly, fully inherit the security of the R1 because they wouldn't have these additional attack vectors.
00:53:59.008 - 00:53:59.696, Speaker C: Super interesting.
00:53:59.728 - 00:54:04.608, Speaker A: And again, this is all within a five year timeline that you think can be implemented.
00:54:04.784 - 00:55:09.764, Speaker B: So one of the things that has always surprised me in the last seven years that I've been working on Ethereum is the pace of improvement of snarks. And so if I were to kind of project out the improvements of Snox, it's possible that timelines could get accelerated. It's possible that, you know, in two years, for example, we'll have multiple ZK VM vendors that are fully snorkifying the entirety of the EVM chain and are doing so with very, very low latency. So what's known as real time proving where the, the proof is provided within one slot. Once we have that, we'll be in a position to expose this pre compile. And the good news for me as a researcher at the Ferm foundation is that to a very large extent we can sit back and relax because all of the heavy lifting is done by these external companies that have received hundreds of millions of dollars of VC funding and we just have to ride the wave of technology there.
00:55:09.852 - 00:55:10.680, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:55:12.380 - 00:55:20.960, Speaker A: This is super exciting. All of the different upgrades and changes that we can expect from Ethereum, but.
00:55:21.420 - 00:56:16.540, Speaker C: Looking at it from maybe someone with just a bird's eye view of the blockchain ecosystem as a whole, there has been increased competition for Ethereum in the past year or so, with other layer ones becoming very popular. It seems as though this proposal might be a response to that pressure, which I think there's nothing. I mean, that's what competition is good for, right? Like just making everyone stay on top of their game. But just, just wondering if that's something that you're concerned about or seeing or if you wanted to accelerate the ossification of Ethereum kind of in response to how these other layer ones are gaining more adoption.
00:56:16.700 - 00:57:29.166, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So if I were to summarize the competition we have on the one hand Bitcoin, which is competing on robustness and lindy and moneyness, and as you said, the beam chain is all about improving health to the max for Ethereum layer 1 and therefore being more of a competition with Bitcoin and the other part of the competition is Solana, which is all about performance. And here my mental model is that it's the L2s that are competing with Solana, it's not the L1 directly. Now the good news for Solana is that there are two key performance metrics that it has shined on in the last year or two. The first one is latency and the second one is throughput. So latency being the very short slot times that they have. And the good news for Ethereum is that with pre confirmations, the latency is going to be so much better than Solana instead of having to wait on average 200 milliseconds.
00:57:29.166 - 00:58:31.042, Speaker B: So 200 milliseconds is 400 milliseconds divided by two, which is the average that you have to wait. Depending on when your transactions lands towards the beginning of the slot or to the end of the slot, that will be reduced to something closer to 10 milliseconds. So it's a 20x improvement in terms of the latency overhead from the slots. And then the other key performance metric is throughput. And one of the things that we've seen this year is the blossoming of L2s. And there's this website rollup WTF, that shows the growth of throughput from the point of view of, of computation, which is measured in gas per second. So what we want is the Ethereum ecosystem to process as many transactions per second and this is measured in gas per second.
00:58:31.042 - 00:59:15.082, Speaker B: And if you go to the website rollup.wtf, you'll see that the L2 ecosystem as a whole is doing roughly 100 times more than Ethereum layer one. And because of the horizontal scalability of the L2s, that could very easily be 1000x next year and then 10,000x. You know, it's a very scalable, sustainably scalable architecture that we have. On the other hand, Solana, what it's trying to do is run all of the activity on a single server. So every validators are expected to have one big server and run everything through it. And to a large extent these servers are maxed out, they can't increase throughput.
00:59:15.082 - 00:59:43.846, Speaker B: And so I don't see Solana increasing its gas limit 10 times over the course of next year. But I could totally see Ethereum scaling its overall gas limit across all of the L2s by a factor of 10x. This will be relatively easy. And so I think we might see the end of the Solana golden era where the two key performance metrics that has shined on historically will no longer be Competitive differentiators.
00:59:43.958 - 01:00:12.322, Speaker A: I must say, Justin, you are an expert in, like you say, mimetics and just the right sound bites. So that's a great quote right there. Seeing the end of the Solana golden era. Yeah, big words. We'll see if that's true. And leads me to another question. And I know we're coming up on time, but I think this is kind of top of mind for many in.
01:00:12.346 - 01:00:50.670, Speaker C: The Ethereum ecosystem, which is just directly related to the ETH price, which has been underperforming other cryptocurrencies. So given your. Obviously this is a markets related question, but it's also, you know, technical in that a lot of these technical changes should impact Ethereum price. So just wanted to get your take on what you think from a technical standpoint might be impacting the price of Ethereum and how that may change going forward.
01:00:51.050 - 01:01:54.056, Speaker B: So my time horizon tends to be years, if not decades. And this is I guess epitomized by the, the proposal of the Beam chain, which is kind of a four or five year roadmap. And I think to a large extent the price action in the last year has been noise. But if I were to somehow ascribe some sort of a story behind it, I think the underperformance of ETH relative to Solana has to do with Meme Coins. Meme Coins somehow found a lot of product market fit on Solana. And I think the reason is that the UX has been extremely good on Solana. And again, it goes back to this notion of having very, very low latency with the 400 millisecond block times and having very, very high throughput so that the fees are very low and you can do many, many transactions per minute.
01:01:54.056 - 01:02:58.880, Speaker B: And so we've seen kind of this Degen casino kind of blossom and lead to many transactions happening on Chain. Now if a lot of these Meme Coin developers were to migrate to Ethereum in 2025, they would actually find a platform which potentially provides better ux. Right. Because again, the latency would be lower than Solana and the ability to scale 10x or 100x can only happen in this horizontal L2 architecture and it just can't happen on Solana. And we're already seeing the transaction fees on Solana skyrocket. So the number that I have in mind, don't quote me on this, that I saw from Twitter a few days ago, was 50 cents per transaction. So we're starting to see the limits of how Solana can scale and this is going to lead to Prices going up.
01:02:58.880 - 01:04:03.530, Speaker B: And this is a problem that I don't think we'll see on Ethereum, because we have this much more scalable architecture now in terms of the underperformance to Bitcoin. The way that I think about it is that Bitcoin is a pioneer in many different things, right? It has pioneered the first ETFs, it's pioneered the first Michael Saylor, it's pioneered the first nation states that are buying bitcoin in large quantities. And all of this pioneering work is actually great for the whole ecosystem. It just grows the pie. And I think the overperformance of Bitcoin will stop once there's nothing left to pioneer on. Bitcoin is in some sense increasingly attacking bigger and bigger fish, but ultimately it will attack the biggest fish possible. It might be, for example, the United States government.
01:04:03.530 - 01:05:11.826, Speaker B: And then once that's done, there won't be anything else to attack. And what Ethereum has done is that it's always been a close second mover. It was a close second mover for the ETFs, and I think it will be a close second mover for other things. And so, I mean, hats off, I guess, to Bitcoin for just continuously pushing the boundaries in terms of showing the world what can be done and growing the piece. But ultimately, I think bitcoin is going to have challenges over the long term. And the reason has to do with the way that it is secured. It's secured through issuance, but its issuance is going to zero, meaning that its security budget is going to zero, which means that the ease of attacking it relative to the benefits that you can get from attacking it, is, is, is going to keep on going up.
01:05:11.826 - 01:05:58.518, Speaker B: So as, as, as one data point here is, if you want to attack bitcoin today, perform a permanent 51% attack. The rough amount of money that you're going to need is about $10 billion. You know, that is a large amount of money, but it's one that is, you know, small enough for many nation states. And in terms of the benefits that you can have from attacking bitcoin, one of the easiest one is just to short bitcoin in size. And one of the things that we've seen is that there's a lot of open interest on the perpetuals market. So if you want to short $10 billion or $20 billion of Bitcoin, you can actually do that. There's going to be enough liquidity.
01:05:58.518 - 01:06:52.176, Speaker B: And right now there's something like 30 to 40 billion dollars of open interest, meaning that the ratio between open interest and cost of attack is greater than one. And so it might be rational for an attacker to go ahead and perform that attack. But of course what happens is that every four years there's a halving. And so every four years we should expect that ratio to keep on worsening and worsening. And not to mention that as Bitcoin, the asset institutionalizes, there's going to be more and more liquidity. And so the open interest kind of organically and gradually should also increase. And so I wouldn't be surprised if in a few years the ratio is going to be 10x, meaning that you can, roughly speaking, make 10x your money from attacking Bitcoin.
01:06:52.176 - 01:06:57.950, Speaker B: You'll invest $10 billion for example, but you'll make $100 billion performing the attack.
01:06:58.070 - 01:07:05.422, Speaker A: Okay, so you're saying the incentives to attack Bitcoin will increase in the next few years.
01:07:05.606 - 01:08:13.786, Speaker C: And also that about the eth price, what you're saying is in the longer term, all of these things that are weighing on Ethereum now are getting solved. So it's, it's becoming more performant versus Solana. And with Bitcoin, like you were saying before, the security model isn't as strong as Ethereum's in the long term. And also just I wanted to add something to your point about Bitcoin always being the first mover. I think that's true, but also Ethereum has been a huge first mover in other things. So just to highlight how Bitcoin has been a second mover to Ethereum on a virtual machine, like you said, the Bit VM is just being investigated. While obviously Ethereum was the first blockchain to allow computation and being turned complete and so on.
01:08:13.786 - 01:08:18.746, Speaker C: So amazingly, you're undercutting Ethereum for once.
01:08:18.818 - 01:08:19.370, Speaker A: I think.
01:08:19.490 - 01:09:36.988, Speaker B: Yes, in some sense we're all converging towards the best ideas and it makes sense for Bitcoin to embrace bitvm and devm and this could potentially give a run to Ethereum for its money. I guess the reason why I'm not super Ultra bullish on BitVM is that Bitcoin has a data availability problem. So you know, the blobs and the bytes per second, this is limited to 4 megabytes every 10 minutes, which is a tiny, tiny amount of data. So even if it can crack the bit VM nut it will still be left with this massive problem of how do you increase data availability. And unfortunately Bitcoin has gone through the scaling wars where there was the big blockers that were suggesting bigger blocks and now it's become taboo to even discuss the possibility of increasing the block size just because there's this scar tissue in Bitcoin history. And so I personally don't see Bitcoin hard forking to increase its block size and therefore I see it kind of always being fundamentally limited when it comes to roll ups on Bitcoin.
01:09:37.084 - 01:09:37.920, Speaker C: Awesome.
01:09:38.500 - 01:09:43.820, Speaker A: Okay, and now just to wrap up. So we've talked about just like the.
01:09:43.860 - 01:10:04.374, Speaker C: View for Ethereum, for just like the very long term, what the end state roadmap will be. But I'd love to just get a sense of what should be expected in the very near term. What are the next few changes that you're excited about and that the Ethereum community should be looking forward to?
01:10:04.542 - 01:11:02.380, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So after my DEFCON talk, I gave a talk at the Bankless Summit which was meant to be a response to a lot of the the response on Twitter and I have this slide with 25 different items that would happen between today and in five years time. One of the things that I haven't mentioned looking at this slide, okay, so one is, for example Maxeb that is coming in the next fork today. We have 32E validators. And so if you have more than 32 ETH, you have to spread your EBITDA for across many validators. And what that means is that we have a million validators, but only, roughly speaking, 10,000 stakers, 10,000 operators. And what we would do with this upgrade is that we would allow the validators to consolidate.
01:11:02.380 - 01:12:07.390, Speaker B: And that is kind of a stepping stone towards having these 1e validators that only that don't need the whole 32eth to stake. Another thing that will happen incrementally is that once we've snarkified the evm, the validators won't need to run a Geth client. So right now I'm running a GEF client at home. I have this one validator and it's consuming a lot of resources. I have a two terabyte hard drive and every once in a while it uses more than it uses up all the space. And I have to basically delete GEF and then resync from scratch in order to save on my disk space. And this is a massive pain and this is something that will go away with these ZK VMs and instead of running Geth, I'll be able to run the ZK version of Gethsemane.
01:12:07.390 - 01:13:00.134, Speaker B: Another thing that I haven't mentioned is that the Ethereum foundation is working on this website, ethproofs.org which is a block explorer for ZK VMs. And the idea is to allow every ZKVM to publish for every L1 EVM block a proof and to disclose how much time it took them in seconds to generate the proof and how many cents it cost them to generate the proof. And then we will have basically this leaderboard where the different ZK VMs can have a friendly competition. I'm hoping this will accelerate the development of these ZK VMs so that we can have the big performance upgrades that I've been talking about in the form of native roll ups, but also increasing dramatically the gas limit of the R1.
01:13:00.212 - 01:13:24.162, Speaker A: Awesome. Great Justin, this has been so fascinating. Really appreciate the time breaking down all of the upgrades expected in the meme chain and with Ethereum going forward. Super interesting stuff. And yeah, I mean Ethereum is such a ambitious and just long term project.
01:13:24.266 - 01:13:54.528, Speaker C: And I think maybe with the pace of markets, many people in the crypto ecosystem want to have changes right away. But I think it does make sense to. When you're thinking about changing the entire infrastructure of the Internet and of finance, you need to think with a more longer term horizon. And obviously that is what you're doing here.
01:13:54.664 - 01:14:28.826, Speaker B: Exactly. And if you want week to week or day to day changes, look at the L2s for example. Base every single week is increasing its gas limit. What I'm hoping as well will happen is that every month, for every quarter, the various L2s can accelerate the pre conformations. So today we have two second pre conformations on base. I'm hoping that eventually it'll be 1.5 seconds, 1 second, half a second, and then we can bring this all the way down to just a few milliseconds and be so much faster than Solana.
01:14:28.938 - 01:14:33.050, Speaker A: Great. Thanks again, Justin. Awesome having you on the podcast.
01:14:33.210 - 01:14:34.010, Speaker B: Thanks Camila.
