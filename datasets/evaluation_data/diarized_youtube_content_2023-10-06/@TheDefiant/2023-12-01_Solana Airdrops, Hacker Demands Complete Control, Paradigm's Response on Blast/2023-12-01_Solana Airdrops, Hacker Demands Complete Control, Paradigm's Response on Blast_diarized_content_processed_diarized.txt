00:00:00.250 - 00:00:13.374, Speaker A: If you're looking for airdrops, I would check out, you know, what other salana Dapps are doing. Which reminds me, we have just stealthily launched a new section of our website.
00:00:13.492 - 00:00:44.380, Speaker B: We haven't really publicized it yet because it's not a hundred percent ready, but I'll give you the scoop. We have an airdrop and yield section on the website. This is a summary of our Defi alpha. That's our paid newsletter, and we give you all of the potential airdrops that are coming out. Same with the yield section. Great kind of yield opportunities for ETH, stablecoins, and other major tokens. So you have all of that handily summarized in one place.
00:00:44.380 - 00:00:47.626, Speaker B: Hi, everyone.
00:00:47.728 - 00:01:05.940, Speaker A: Welcome to a new episode of Crypto with Cammie, where we go over the biggest news and headlines of crypto and DFI. We'll be going over the biggest news of the week of November 27, talking about the cyber hack, but specifically how.
00:01:06.310 - 00:01:11.330, Speaker B: The hacker is sending some really interesting messages on chain.
00:01:11.750 - 00:02:08.226, Speaker A: We'll be talking about the Ave, stablecoin, go. The activity, picking up on the near protocol, Solana project, Jido doing an airdrop, the Cosmos fork, Vitalik's techno optimism post, and a bit of Gamefi news. So, yeah, let's jump to it. All right, so this Kyber hacker messages are super interesting. The latest that we got was on Thursday morning, late Wednesday night Eastern. So, okay, basically a bit of background. Kyber is one of the earliest or one of the first Amms to exist in D five, one of the first decentralized exchanges.
00:02:08.226 - 00:03:29.326, Speaker A: It was founded in or launched in 2018. It never got as big as uniswap, but it is pretty long standing decks in the space, and it got attacked last week with 48 million of funds stolen from the decks across various chains, including Ethereum. It's very unfortunate, but unfortunately, such an uncommon thing to happen in Defi. What's more uncommon is just the kinds of messages that the hacker is sending, and just a reminder that anyone executing a transaction on chain is able to input a message on that transaction, on kind of the data field on that transaction. And you can easily see that on Etherscan. So it's been an increasingly common way for hackers of Defi to leave messages for the public or for their protocols themselves.
00:03:29.508 - 00:03:31.680, Speaker B: This has been just like a very.
00:03:32.470 - 00:04:56.682, Speaker A: Interesting trend that's become more and more common for hackers to start negotiating with the protocol that they're attacking via these messages. And it usually does work out that the protocol team agrees to give the attacker a percentage of the funds that it drained in exchange for them returning most of the funds. And so the agreement is made that nobody's pressing charges or going after the hacker, after these agreements. So that's kind of the usual way that these exchanges go. But in this case, the Kyber hacker went a step further and is actually demanding to take control and ownership over the Kyber protocol and company itself, which is definitely a first, very brazen of this hacker to do this. So they sent a list of demands. They said they want complete executive control over Kyber, the company.
00:04:56.682 - 00:05:33.030, Speaker A: They want temporary full authority and ownership over Kyber Dao to enact legislative changes, and they want all legal documentation pertaining to the company's legal structure and so on. They want all of Kyber's on chain and off chain assets. And then they are so gracious, quote unquote, to offer severance packages to employees who want to leave. They offer to buy out executives of the company.
00:05:33.180 - 00:05:36.166, Speaker B: Just like very crazy.
00:05:36.348 - 00:05:39.146, Speaker A: I don't know what they expect to.
00:05:39.168 - 00:05:40.474, Speaker B: Come out of this or why they.
00:05:40.512 - 00:06:46.430, Speaker A: Think the Kyber team will agree to these demands. There are more and more sophisticated ways of catching on chain attackers. I'm sure it's very likely that if Kyber went after this hacker, they'd end up catching him. So I'm not sure why he or she or they believe they have such leverage over Kyver to be able to make these demands. So I don't see this succeeding. Of course we'll see, but I think what's interesting is just this trend of these negotiation tactics by hackers becoming almost the norm in these kinds of attacks. So we'll keep you posted on how this story develops.
00:06:46.430 - 00:07:55.474, Speaker A: What's next on the protocol side of news, there was a huge effort behind getting the Ave stablecoin go. That's gho to climb back to, or not back to, but climb to parity with the US dollar. So Ave a few months ago launched a stablecoin called Go and Ave is one of the largest, or has mostly been the largest lending protocol in Defi. So they launched this stablecoin, but it's been very hard for it to maintain a peg to the US dollar. And in our story, we explore the reasons why it's had trouble maintaining that peg. Basically, there's not much that traders can do with go. They can't use it as collateral in many places.
00:07:55.474 - 00:08:19.100, Speaker A: They can't get a lot of yield with it, so there isn't much demand for go. And that's why it struggled to maintain the peg with US dollar. So there was this kind of committee that formed to get go back to its peg with a so called, you know, benevolent dictator, token Bryce, who.
00:08:21.490 - 00:08:21.758, Speaker B: Kind.
00:08:21.764 - 00:09:03.034, Speaker A: Of applied for this position to lead the charge in getting go back to Peg. He was awarded that position. And this kind of executive committee formed because the task of getting go back to PEC wasn't being achieved in a decentralized way. So they decided they needed a more executive kind of body to do this. And so token Bryce took on the leadership of this, and they had a deadline for go to get back to.
00:09:03.072 - 00:09:11.454, Speaker B: Peg, which was, I believe, November. Yes, it was November 30 with the.
00:09:11.492 - 00:10:06.160, Speaker A: Target of getting go to zero 980, couple of days before the deadline, they actually achieved this. So right now, go is right at, this is November 30, and it's kind of been hovering at that .98,982,985 for the past few days. So, yeah, it's great to see that this team was able to pull together and really was very effective in the measures that they took to get go up from.
00:10:06.610 - 00:10:10.720, Speaker B: Where was it? It was at zero 96.
00:10:11.810 - 00:10:17.220, Speaker A: They got it up to zero 98 in a few days.
00:10:17.830 - 00:10:41.514, Speaker B: So the main things that they did is that they applied incentives, obviously, to it. So now there's incentives on the Maverick protocol to borrow go, and there's also.
00:10:41.552 - 00:10:47.642, Speaker A: A limit for the issuance of go.
00:10:47.696 - 00:12:11.122, Speaker B: So that also just puts more pressure on go price to increase for whoever wants to take advantage of this. The yield options on Maverick protocol for go range between 34 and 45%. And Mark Seller, who we interviewed for this story, said it's not sustainable to incentivize go this much for so long. So it will only be for a limited time, but there will have to be more sustainable demand for go going forward. So I think there will have to be an effort to integrate go into more and more DeFi protocols to make it more productive in order, again, for there to be demand. It can't rely on having these high incentives because incentives run out, and then you're just back to square one. So there will have to be some sort of more sustainable organic demand for go for it to actually retain its one dollars peg.
00:12:11.122 - 00:12:20.234, Speaker B: But so far, this committee has been really effective. So I'm sure that they are on.
00:12:20.272 - 00:12:22.662, Speaker A: Top of this and thinking of further.
00:12:22.726 - 00:12:29.610, Speaker B: Ways to incentivize go and to make it more useful across Defi.
00:12:31.250 - 00:12:33.326, Speaker A: Now, moving on to, we have a.
00:12:33.348 - 00:14:08.038, Speaker B: Few layer one news. It's interesting that there seems to be a lot of increased activity in, let's say, alt layer ones, which I'm describing as non bitcoin, non ethereum. There was a short time frame recently where I saw this narrative come up that non Ethereum, non bitcoin layer ones were kind of dead, and that all of activity would happen on ethereum roll ups. Well, recently I think that narrative is, at least for now, proven wrong, because we've seen just so much activity happening on alt layer ones. We saw Solana really take the spotlight in the past few weeks, and now we're seeing near also climb in different key metrics, which pretty unexpected. I at least hadn't thought about near for a while. It hadn't been making much news, but we were surprised to see just this jump in activity in terms of daily active addresses and daily transactions.
00:14:08.038 - 00:14:29.570, Speaker B: So near active addresses are actually beating out bitcoin and Ethereum. It's also beating Solana in daily active addresses, which was surprising. I think it's only second to TrOn and it's tying with BNB chain.
00:14:30.630 - 00:14:53.610, Speaker A: And then the other metric that's growing for near is daily transactions. So also just beating out Ethereum, beating out bitcoin, but still lagging Solana, TrOn and the BNB chain. Looking at just like the major layer one protocols. Sorry, layer one chains.
00:14:55.070 - 00:14:57.702, Speaker B: So what's driving this activity?
00:14:57.846 - 00:15:12.430, Speaker A: It's mainly two applications. It's Kaikai now, which is a payments application, and it's sweatcoin, which is this move to earn, if you will, DaP.
00:15:13.410 - 00:15:18.660, Speaker B: It's a Dap that kind of incentivizes exercise, I believe.
00:15:19.670 - 00:15:28.982, Speaker A: And that's, you know, that's those two apps are making up a really large chunk of activity on near.
00:15:29.036 - 00:15:30.680, Speaker B: I think it's like 90%.
00:15:32.650 - 00:15:50.614, Speaker A: Of activity there. But still, even if it's those two Dapps, they are two very successful Dapps, which are kind of real world applications.
00:15:50.662 - 00:16:04.594, Speaker B: They're not defi or gamefi. They have to do with, again like real world payments with this kind of exercise DAP. So it's interesting, it's an interesting use case that's something that we don't see.
00:16:04.632 - 00:17:36.030, Speaker A: Very often in layer one chains. So just something to watch activity on. Near picking up now on Solana, it looks like it's having a bit of an airdrop season. So Jito, which is the second largest DAP on Solana after Marinade, announced a new token and an airdrop Jito produces infrastructure for Solana. It builds kind of MeV protection and it has a liquid staking token called Jido Sol token. But now it announced it's launching a governance token, JTO, separate from Jiro Sol, which is already live and these new tokens, JTO tokens will have a supply of 1,000,000,010% of which will be airdropped to users who have contributed to the judo network development. The snapshot for the airdrop was already taken on November 25, so unfortunately for all of you listening, it's a bit late if you haven't already participated in the Jiro network.
00:17:37.570 - 00:17:41.738, Speaker B: But yeah, interesting to see airdrops happening on Solana.
00:17:41.834 - 00:18:29.054, Speaker A: They're kind of taking the same model that Ethereum DApPs took early on, which is doing a snapshot and seeing rewarding users who participated in the DAP retroactively. So if you're looking for airdrops, I would check out what other solana dapps are doing and if it makes sense to participate in any of those. Which reminds me, we have just stealthily launched a new section of our website.
00:18:29.172 - 00:18:51.574, Speaker B: We haven't really publicized it yet because it's not 100% ready, but I'll give you the scoop. Now, for those listening, we have an airdrops and yield section on the website. For those of you watching this on YouTube, I'll show you here. It's on our menu. It's a drop down.
00:18:51.612 - 00:18:54.870, Speaker A: It says airdrops yields if you go to airdrops.
00:18:55.290 - 00:19:34.082, Speaker B: This is a summary of our defi alpha. That's our paid newsletter, and we give you all of the potential airdrops that are coming out. And then, same with the yield section, we give you great kind of yield opportunities for ETH, stablecoins and other major tokens. So you have all of that handily summarized in one place. So we really hope that this is useful to defi and crypto users. We really think it is. So check it out.
00:19:34.136 - 00:19:59.238, Speaker A: So that's Solana other layer one news Cosmos co founder Jquan proposes to fork the network. He was in disagreement over a proposal that passed to cut Adam inflation. Adam is Cosmos native token, so he is rallying his supporters to fork the network.
00:19:59.414 - 00:20:52.458, Speaker B: We'll keep you posted on how that goes. Really interesting development. Of course, Cosmos is one of the biggest layer one ecosystems, so we'll see if this fork succeeds or not. Next, this super interesting post by Vitalik Ethereum co founder and creator. He has a philosophy that he's proposing called defensive acceleration. It's either defensive decentralization or differential acceleration. Dac it's a post on techno optimism.
00:20:52.458 - 00:22:41.600, Speaker B: So to give a bit of background, this is in line with what Mark Andreessen posted recently. He had this techno optimism blog post where Mark Andreessen, Sam Altman and a few others, VCs and founders, are of this kind of line of thinking, the techno optimist line of thinking that basically goes like this. It says, technology is a net positive for the world. We should do everything to advance technology, because the outcomes will greatly outweigh any negatives that might come with technological developments. The counterargument to that is people who say technology can have very negative effects on humans and on development. And so technological developments cannot come at any cost, like, we need to set up guardrails around it. And this becomes more interesting and more relevant given what happened with OpenAI and the ouster of Sam Altman from the company, because apparently Sam Altman is from the techno optimist side, like, he wants to push AI to its maximum state no matter what happens, no matter what the consequences are.
00:22:41.600 - 00:23:39.650, Speaker B: This isn't exactly confirmed. That apparently, from what's come out of all those discussions, it looks like part of the board, the. The part of the board that was on the side of making OpenAI a nonprofit foundation, they were kind of more cautious about the development, about the consequences that developing a super intelligent AI could have. And so there was this tension between developing AI to its fullest or being more careful with it. And so initially, it looks like the cautious side had temporarily won out, pushing Sam Altman out, but then, as we all know, he was reinstated.
00:23:39.990 - 00:24:02.620, Speaker A: So, anyways, this whole techno optimism debate has been going on and kind of was further highlighted with this whole issue with OpenAI. It became more relevant. And so it's interesting to see.
00:24:05.790 - 00:24:09.050, Speaker B: What Vitalik's position is on this.
00:24:09.200 - 00:26:07.650, Speaker A: And he stands somewhere in the middle. He is definitely in the middle, but more towards the effective acceleration side, the EAAC side, which is what Mark Andreessen adheres to, and maybe Sam Altman, than to the anti EAAC side, but he still advocates for a more careful development of technology, specifically AI. So what Vitalik says is that there is a risk that if AI reaches its full potential, that it overtakes human intelligence and ends up controlling humans, and that this, in the hands of a centralized party or a centralized organization, can be a huge threat to human life. And so as a way to prevent this or a hedge against this would be to have more decentralized governance structures. And that's obviously where blockchain and crypto come in. So that's why his position on technological advancement and development, he calls it defensive or decentralization acceleration, because it's accelerating technological development. But introducing this element of decentralization, which can be a way to defend humans against some super intelligent AI robot that can overtake humanity.
00:26:07.650 - 00:26:34.982, Speaker A: So we have a summary here on the post, which is a very long post by Vitalik. So check it out, or definitely read the post itself, which is super interesting. Now we have this news about web3 gaming company obaby partnering with Paramount.
00:26:35.046 - 00:27:47.410, Speaker B: Just wanted to quickly point this out because we think that Gamefi is going to be a trend that will start picking up again as we maybe are heading into a bull market. Gamefi is these things that come and go with crypto cycles, apparently. Now, finally, crypto and blockchain games are actually fun to play, which was not the case in the previous bowl. So maybe they have a chance to actually get more mainstream adoption, which hasn't been the case so far. So that's just a trend to watch. And recently there was, like I said, this partnership between Obavy and Paramount, the major studio. And finally, there is this story on the latest controversy with Blast.
00:27:47.410 - 00:28:37.534, Speaker B: For a bit of background, for those of you who missed it, blast is a new L2. They are backed by paradigm, the famous venture capital firm. And yeah, they came out very loudly announcing their launch, announcing that they are backed by paradigm. Everyone kind of jumped in. They were very much criticized because they're a L2, but there's no actual network or anything yet. It's just a wallet that people can send money to. It's a one way street.
00:28:37.534 - 00:29:25.890, Speaker B: So people can send money, but they cannot withdraw. And the idea is that they'll be able to withdraw when the L2 launches, I believe, in February. And the idea is that if you send money, that money will be deposited in lido or in maker to get that additional yield. And of course you'll get blast tokens. And that's pretty much it. If you look at their website, there isn't much, anything on the tech on why it's better than other L2s, other than the fact that they are issuing these incentives.
00:29:26.390 - 00:29:32.242, Speaker A: So a lot of people have come out and criticized it, saying it kind.
00:29:32.296 - 00:31:51.710, Speaker B: Of seems like a pyramid scheme, like a Ponzi. There isn't much there except incentives and rewards. There's even a sort of referral program which raised a lot of flags. So anyways, it didn't get the best reception in crypto when they launched. There was also this question of, has paradigm lost its touch? Like, has it lost the mark? Is it just backing any shiny new thing with a promise of a token? And so Dan Robinson from Paradigm wanted to kind of say that they disagree with a lot of the marketing and with many of the decisions that blast made at the launch, which to me it's pretty shocking to see a VC publicly come out and criticize a portfolio company that's usually done quietly. Of course, VCs can disagree and give founders advice and it's appreciated, but to do it publicly, I think it just shows that there was so much backlash, that blast was received so poorly, it was starting to damage Paradigm's name because blast just very clearly positioned themselves like a paradigm project and played that to their advantage and used that to get almost about $600 million in funds to this contract in just a week or so. So it was starting to actually affect the paradigm name itself, that they were being used to attract all this money.
00:31:51.710 - 00:33:02.050, Speaker B: So I think that's what prompted Dan Robinson to come out and just publicly say that they disagree with the marketing, that they disagree with the fact that this is a one way street. But just very interesting development. Very interesting to see paradigm kind of distance themselves from some of the decisions that blast has taken. Now I'll be interested to see what the actual L2 looks like because I think paradigm are definitely smart people. I don't think they would have backed this project just based off its token incentives and its founding team, which it's founded by Pacman who launched obviously, you know, the NFT marketplace that took over. It's a, it's a great founding. You know, hopefully there's more to blast than the founding team and the token incentives.
00:33:02.050 - 00:33:29.180, Speaker B: So that's yet to be seen. But so far it's not looking good, to be honest, for blast. So we'll see. Obviously we'll keep you posted on all of this and more, and I'll see you all next week with all the latest Defi news and headlines. Thanks so much.
