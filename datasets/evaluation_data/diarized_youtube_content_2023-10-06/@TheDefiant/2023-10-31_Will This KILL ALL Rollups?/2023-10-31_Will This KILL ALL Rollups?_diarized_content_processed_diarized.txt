00:00:00.250 - 00:00:40.762, Speaker A: I think zero knowledge will make a huge difference in the next two, three years, because once you have a powerful zero knowledge capability, you don't need optimistic rollups. You may not even need rollups, period, because you can build blockchains directly on these principles. How to, how to make it fast and harder. That's something that I'm really, really interested now. I think of optimistic rollups as a trade off, as a compromise that we had to make in order to move on. But if we had a perfect ZK engine, as we thought PI square is going to be, then you wouldn't need to go that route. And in general, reexecuting program.
00:00:40.762 - 00:01:42.510, Speaker A: There's a very basic principle in software engineering that duplication is evil, duplication is bad. Students taking software engineering classes at our universities, at our university, champagne, they may fail classes if they just copy and paste code and change the name of the function and of the variable from t one to t two. So you should avoid duplication of code, duplication of execution as well. So currently what happens in blockchain is pretty ridiculous. If you step back and think about the big picture, we re execute the same program many, many times over, only to check whether the program or the proposal of the result was correct, only to validate why. If we have a formal semantics for programming language, and if we can generate a proof that the execution was done correctly with respect to that semantics, now we can only check the proof, which is much, much easier, much, much faster. So that's what I believe will happen in the future.
00:01:42.510 - 00:01:56.380, Speaker A: And many blockchains, I don't think they will disappear. I think they will migrate naturally into something else. We don't know yet what, but into something, what blockchains were supposed to be or what they promised to be from day one.
