00:00:04.570 - 00:00:27.480, Speaker A: This week on the defined podcast, we speak with Will Warren, founder and CEO of Zero X Labs, one of the largest decentralized exchanges around, as well as being one of the oldest. But before we go into Zero X, we talk about the effect this bear market has had on the DEX ecosystem. How have sliding prices affect that Dex volume in the past couple of months?
00:00:28.570 - 00:01:39.698, Speaker B: Yeah, happy to. So I think DeX volumes tend to be somewhat cyclical, same as kind of the centralized exchange volumes. There will be some correlation, and as the crypto market goes down or something like that, there will be some volatility and volumes go up, but then they tend to fall. But I think what is exciting in what we're seeing today is that Dexes have real product market fit. There are a ton of different use cases, tokenized assets that people want to be able to access or to exchange with others. And that kind of, some of those use cases are also cyclical, like NFT markets. There's a little bit less activity today than maybe at the heights, but there is still real demand to be able to access and to exchange different tokens, whether they're like fungible assets or non fungible assets.
00:01:39.698 - 00:02:36.186, Speaker B: And it's pretty amazing that we're even at the current level of Dex volumes that we're seeing today, if we think about 2017. So, yeah, we launched the first version of Zero X protocol in August of 2017. And back then, it was exciting for us. If there was like $100,000 of trading volume in the entire day, I think a lot of startups or projects will do something where they have a dashboard on the wall, and every time something happens, it'll make a noise. We were thinking about doing that for Zero X protocol back in the day. Every time a trade trickles in, it would make a noise, and everyone on the team would be excited about it. And then if you look at where we're at today, it's insane.
00:02:36.186 - 00:02:47.570, Speaker B: The number of users, the number of trades that are going through Dexes just generally is very encouraging, I would say, and exciting.
00:02:47.990 - 00:04:20.046, Speaker C: I totally agree. The fact that we're seeing kind of real scale in Dexes is super exciting. And I do remember those days in 2017 through early 2020 where Dexes were just like a tiny, tiny, tiny drop in the bucket of total crypto trading volume, but that percentage has risen to a significant amount, like a decent chunk. There are stats that show decks versus centralized exchange volume at around 15%. So it's definitely becoming like a force to be reckoned with for centralized exchanges, which have been traditionally just like the biggest players in crypto in general, and now Dexes are rivaling it. And just to give context, I have this Dune analytics dashboard up, and it shows that in June, Dex volume was at a bit under 80 billion total counting all Dexes, and that compares to just over 120,000,000,000 in December, January. So it's taken a hit from the height of the market, but it's more.
00:04:20.068 - 00:04:25.374, Speaker B: Than $100,000 per day. Yeah, I guess that's like a step in the right direction.
00:04:25.502 - 00:04:25.938, Speaker C: Definitely.
00:04:26.024 - 00:04:26.660, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:27.590 - 00:05:40.460, Speaker C: There was, like this big bump up in end of last year, but compared to just like all of most of 2021, and before then, it's higher than it was. So I think you're right. That's been a big evolution in just like, the deck story, there's, like, real users today, even in the middle of this huge downturn. But speaking of Dex versus sex volume, while it remains around 10%, it has been dropping this year. So I'm wondering why you think this is. Are people just more comfortable maybe going to centralized exchanges in times when there's more volatility? Maybe it's like people are just like cashing out. So that's kind of what that's reflecting, or why do you think kind of this proportion is changing a little bit?
00:05:41.070 - 00:07:16.280, Speaker B: That's a good question. To give you the honest answer, I don't know. But to take a stab at guessing what might be causing it, I think that a lot of the, I guess, like, yield farming activities that were going on over the last year, year and a half, I don't really remember, but all of that subsidy and all those tokens that were kind of funneling into the market, I think created a very kind of inflated the amount of economic activity happening on chain. And as there's more economic activity happening, there's more people that are doing swaps on Dexes, there are more people that are interested in getting into the pickle token because they can earn 20% interest on it. A lot of that kind of is starting to cool off, and I think the entire Ethereum web3 space learned a lot of interesting lessons from kind of like yield farming strategies and different ways of incentivizing activity. But I think now we're starting to go beyond it.
00:07:17.870 - 00:07:56.840, Speaker C: This is maybe getting a little bit off topic, but I'd love for you to expand on that a little bit, if you could just what are those lessons like? What do you think is next after maybe yield farming and just the kind of liquidity incentives we saw in the past year or so, especially kind of post defi summer that's kind of wearing off. What are lessons from that? And what do you think is kind of the next model that people are looking at?
00:07:58.250 - 00:09:20.350, Speaker B: That's a good question. Well, okay, so what were the learnings from yield farming? Kind of defi summer? So some of the takeaways that I've seen other people talk about and that I also have observed are like a lot of projects that are launching a token, and you can stake your uniswap LP tokens or Sushiswap LP tokens and earn an interest rate by kind of depositing staked liquidity. Those subsidy programs are really like growth programs that you would see at a traditional tech company. It's like a user acquisition tool like PayPal. I forget what the number was, but they gave new PayPal users like five or $10 for signing up and getting a PayPal account. And I think that's essentially what a lot of these d five summer projects were doing, is they were kind of bootstrapping not only their project, but also their community. Were getting a bunch of stakeholders that were excited about, maybe excited about the project genuinely.
00:09:20.350 - 00:10:33.750, Speaker B: Probably a lot of mercenary folks that were looking to maximize yield. But at the end of the day, a lot of these projects were looking to more or less acquire users with tokens that they were emitting. And user acquisition is like, I think it's pretty hard to do it effectively or efficiently. That's my understanding. And if you look at kind of the customer acquisition cost versus lifetime value of community members that aren't actually really bought into a mission, or that don't necessarily believe in a project because it's going to accomplish something important for the world. They're just trying to chase yield or whatever. I think that we basically saw that it's really hard to keep people interested and engaged in a project unless it's offering value without any subsidies.
00:10:33.750 - 00:11:03.700, Speaker B: That's not to say that there haven't been projects that have used token subsidies effectively, and there probably have been really effective campaigns. But yeah, I think one of the bigger takeaways has been that's not a way to build a sustainable product that creates value for the world.
00:11:05.110 - 00:11:42.320, Speaker C: Yeah, that's kind of been a lesson from this past cycle and the just decreased amount of activity that results from less interest in these programs and fewer projects actually implementing these kinds of incentives. Where do you think the next kind of wave of activity and liquidity for Dexs, where do you think that will come from?
00:11:46.450 - 00:14:01.802, Speaker B: Well, so internally at zero X labs on our team, we talk about crypto going through a toy phase. And Chris Dixon has that quote. Like many of the most important new technologies start out looking like toys or something like that. And I think that's very true in crypto, where the things that have found product market fit and generated a lot of interest and excitement have a lot of, it has been things that are not necessarily changing the world. Like another quote, Vitalik said, Ethereum has gotten so far, some milestone was reached, but have we really earned it and meaning? Has this technology actually started making an impact on people's lives beyond the ability to access probably very speculative and not necessarily great markets? I think there will continue to be speculative use cases or interesting use cases that are real, but also maybe get really crazy and frothy. But I'm also hoping that we'll start to see adoption of stablecoins and decentralized exchanges and trustless lending borrowing solutions so that people that want to have an alternative to their local financial system, that want to be able to have access to financial services that may offer some sort of important benefit to them, whether it's economic or an opportunity to be employed by a Dow and go work on something that they would never be able to work on locally. Those are the use cases where I think we're going to see a slow growth, slow, consistent growth over time, and it's going to take a lot of time for us to get there.
00:14:01.802 - 00:14:06.380, Speaker B: But I think we're maybe starting to get to the point where it's becoming real.
00:14:09.230 - 00:14:40.920, Speaker C: What are some of the initial kind of signs that you're seeing of this? Just like real world adoption or kind of use cases emerging? What are some of the first kind of bridges that are being raised between crypto and just real kind of productive use cases that are useful for everyday people?
00:14:42.250 - 00:15:44.810, Speaker B: Yeah. So they are there. There's actually a number, and I'm definitely going to forget a really good example. And people will be like, why didn't you mention that? And I'll be like, oh yeah, I should have mentioned that. I think one is the ability to just earn interest on a lending borrowing protocol like compound or AAve. And yeah, it's a peer to peer system where demand for leverage or the desire to short a specific asset. I think in a lot of cases the borrowers are people that are looking to take some sort of financial position and they're paying interest to this latent capital that we know it's there, we know it's solvent, it's all viewable on chain, we know exactly how the protocol works we know exactly what's going to trigger a liquidation.
00:15:44.810 - 00:16:50.154, Speaker B: There's no risk of funny business going on. I think that's a huge and underrealized opportunity where if people have access to earning interest in a relatively stable store of value, that's massive, and we're already seeing the interest is there. Like, the total amount of crypto that's deposited into these protocols is massive, and they've been functioning well for years now. So I think that's one use case. Another use case is actually the ability to borrow money from compound or aave for real life uses. So say, for example, if your money is denominated in crypto, you can't get a mortgage with that. You can't go and get a loan to buy a house if your assets are in crypto.
00:16:50.154 - 00:17:26.140, Speaker B: The banks don't acknowledge that as being capital that they can treat as collateral. You can go and deposit your crypto into compound. You can borrow USDC. If you're in the United States at least, and you can go and convert that to dollars, you now have a mortgage through the blockchain. And theoretically, we should be able to convert USDC to every local currency so people can do this all over.
00:17:26.590 - 00:17:28.202, Speaker C: I wanted to let you know about.
00:17:28.256 - 00:18:04.214, Speaker A: A 16 C's new podcast called Web three with a 16 C. We're excited to recommend what is sure to become one of the best podcasts for understanding and going deeper on crypto and web3. It's hosted by Sonal Chaksi, former showrunner and longtime host of the A 16 C podcast, along with frequent guest appearances and hosting by Chris Dixon. This new show is really about building the next generation of the Internet. You can listen to web3 with a six Inc. Today on Apple Podcast, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcast. Be sure to follow it.
00:18:04.214 - 00:18:21.950, Speaker A: Now, as we go deeper into Dexes, what has been the progress within the sector? We've seen some massive developments, such as concentrated liquidity with Unisoft V three. But how does it work in practice? And what are will's thoughts on some of the more under the radar innovations?
00:18:23.650 - 00:19:10.810, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. There's a lot going on in the deck space. It's a very active space with a lot of innovation and a lot of competition. Yeah, I think going back to uniswap V One, when it launched, I don't know if it was like 2019 or maybe that was like, when it really started to get a lot of traction. But uniswap definitely changed the deck space. Like it brought in a massive flood of users. And suddenly Dexes were just way more useful and being adopted by many different projects, thousands of different liquidity pools being created.
00:19:10.810 - 00:20:14.980, Speaker B: And that was massive for the space. There have been a variety of different automated market maker solutions. As you mentioned, curve came in and made stablecoin to stablecoin swaps really capital efficient compared to this constant product Uniswap approach. And then uniswap created this kind of hybrid automated market maker order book approach with concentrated liquidity. And this massively increased the capital efficiency and the amount of liquidity available for just markets. Some of the more liquid markets especially. And it has also had the effect of being attracting a much more sophisticated set of participants, liquidity providers, that are able to.
00:20:14.980 - 00:21:35.562, Speaker B: Frankly, you have to be pretty sophisticated, I think, to be a market maker on concentrated liquidity system, unless you have a really wide range, but in that case, you're getting a lot smaller kind of portion of the LPPs being generated. So, yeah, as you mentioned, it's definitely more complex and challenging for the everyday community member to say, just throw some tokens into this pool, and they're contributing in equal proportion to everyone else according to their deposits. The release of uniswap v three with concentrated liquidity, huge. It immediately took over most of the Dex volume share. So in a matter of months, uniswap v three was doing like half or more of all Dex volume on Ethereum. And, yeah, it definitely brought way more efficiency to these markets. I would say getting to where the cutting edge is like, where we are today.
00:21:35.562 - 00:23:13.340, Speaker B: And there's actually been a lot of cutting edge work going on over the years, and just not all of it has ended up kind of making it to end users. But I think there's like, the entire Dex game now is about how do we address minor extractable value, or maximally extractable value, which gives the miner who has the ability to arrange transactions into a block, how do we address their ability to kind of have, like, trading God mode, and the ability to just arrange transactions in a way where they can just take a bunch of money from those people that are sending the transactions. And it's a big challenge. But the space has gotten to the point where MEV is kind of a mainstream topic now. In the crypto space. It's something that is discussed quite actively. Flashbots has offered a private mining pool, or like a private channel that kind of protects your transactions from being viewed in the public mempool and getting like, Sandwich attacked and front ran, and all of these different MEV challenges that will kind of extract money from people trading flashbots is definitely a big step forward.
00:23:13.340 - 00:24:37.410, Speaker B: Beyond that, too, in terms of how transaction ordering, you can have a lot more control over how different transactions are strung together with flashbots, which is really cool and arguably the more compelling piece versus the private minor channel, cowswap is doing batching of transactions. So if there are a bunch of people that are doing trades on a particular market, and they happen to be wanting to trade the same asset or on opposite sides of the same market, instead of having both of them kind of cross over the bid ask spread, they can meet in the middle and they can both get a better price because they just happen to want to do a trade at the same time. Frequent batch auctions, that's kind of the technical term for this form of trade. Execution is like a really compelling approach. The challenge is that you have to have enough people, like a high frequency of people submitting trades in the same period of time for you to really get the benefit of price improvement.
00:24:37.570 - 00:24:46.150, Speaker C: And is that related to MeV, or is that a separate innovation?
00:24:46.730 - 00:25:32.920, Speaker B: These batch orders, they are in the same universe. Batching orders together is a way of executing trades that can potentially provide better pricing. It can technically help with MeV or help avoid MeV that you might have gotten if you went to like an amm, versus just trading with a counterparty that wanted to trade with you at that very moment, I don't think it's necessarily eliminating MeV today, but it could get there.
00:25:33.690 - 00:26:08.980, Speaker C: Okay, so the state of the art, or I guess a lot of the innovation now then, is focused on eliminating or avoiding or minimizing MeV for traders on Dexs. And ways to do that are through flashbots using these kind of private pools. So I guess miners don't have access to your trades before they're executed. And then these batch orders, is that right?
00:26:09.430 - 00:26:26.450, Speaker B: Yeah, that is right. Yeah. Frequent batch auctions. Yeah. But wait, there's one more amazing approach. Yeah. Well, now I have to, of course, pitch our recently released slippage protection.
00:26:26.450 - 00:27:44.850, Speaker B: So, we recently launched slippage protection within Zerox API. So it's a feature you can choose to turn on or off, but slippage protection is, in my mind, it's like one of the biggest developments in the deck space that has happened in quite a while. And basically, our team was curious to understand how does MeV impact the prices that zero X API users are getting or any Dex user? How much is slippage reducing? Kind of the price they're getting from what they were told they were going to get in the user interface. So, yeah, I guess to be more specific, when you go to a Dex and you go onto the website, it shows you a price that's like the quoted price. It's the sticker price that was advertised to you. Oftentimes that price is really just based on a snapshot of the most recently mined block. And it doesn't really tell you what price you're going to end up getting when your transaction is mined into the next block.
00:27:44.850 - 00:28:56.470, Speaker B: That price can be very different. Usually it'll be like distributed around the price that was shown to you. And so what we did is we studied this. We captured data on like 700,000 trades that went through zero X API and went through automated market makers that due to their price curve design, you can induce slippage, you can get a different price than you saw in the user interface. And what we found was pretty shocking. We didn't go into this necessarily having any assumptions of what would come out, but what we found was that on average, you're inducing 20 basis points or more of slippage if you're trading over $100,000 and the relationship between how much you're trading through an amm and the amount of slippage that you realize once your transaction is mined is, it's a linear relationship, so slippage increases with the trade size. And that was pretty shocking.
00:28:56.470 - 00:29:47.830, Speaker B: If, you know, if this, if there were no kind of malicious MeV bots extracting money from trades, slippage should average at zero. There should sometimes be negative slippage, sometimes positive. It should be like a normal distribution. But instead, what we saw are that mevbots are just attacking these trades. They're just extracting every penny that they can and pushing it to the very limit of what price is acceptable. And users are just getting millions of dollars per month are being taken from them. For example, $27 million was lost to MeV in the last 30 days through zero X API, the 30 days leading up to our launch of slippage protection.
00:29:47.830 - 00:30:44.890, Speaker B: So slippage protection was the kind of second part to that. So we went and captured all this data because we were curious and interested. We're like, holy cow, this is a big problem. Like users are getting fleeced. And so what we did is we basically created the second part of this solution, which is our slippage protection solution. It basically will look at what are the amounts of slippage that are likely to be induced for a specific trade on a specific trading pair, specific trade size, and it will basically factor that into the order routing. So when Zero X API is choosing to route you to liquidity, source A or B instead of routing based on the quoted price that you see in the UI, it will route to get you the best executed price, which is what you see on the blockchain.
00:30:44.890 - 00:31:01.230, Speaker B: So I know that was like a really long explanation and quite a lot to unpack, but I'm really proud of the team. I think it was like a really awesome achievement and all the Xerox API integrators and their users are benefiting.
00:31:02.690 - 00:31:26.226, Speaker C: I'll start with kind of the results of that and then I want to kind of follow up on exactly kind of how it happens after this was implemented. So you said traders were losing 27 million in the last 30 days before slippage protection. So what's the effect of this been on trades?
00:31:26.418 - 00:32:01.650, Speaker B: Yeah, so we just launched slippage protection last week and so we're still gathering data. And yeah, I'm really excited to be able to show all of our integrators how much we're saving their users when we get more data coming in. But we have a really high degree of certainty around how much slippage will be induced just by looking at historical trades.
00:32:04.230 - 00:32:27.500, Speaker C: Can you explain again exactly how this happens, how you're able to save users money? So you said it's about kind of the difference between the sticker price of the trade and the actual kind of execution price on the blockchain. But can you explain that a little more? I didn't really get it.
00:32:27.870 - 00:32:59.698, Speaker B: Oh yeah, no worries. It's pretty kind of hard to explain too. And I'll do my best. Okay, yeah. So when you go to a decentralized exchange interface, say like your favorite one, like matcha XYZ. Sorry, I had to plug it. What you would have seen prior to using slippage protection is you would see a price in the user interface.
00:32:59.698 - 00:33:58.118, Speaker B: And usually a user would say, okay, I'm getting this price. That looks good to me. Let's move forward with the transaction. They sign that transaction with their private key, and then that transaction is transmitted to the blockchain, to the peer to peer network to be eventually mined into a block. What happens with amms and slippage in particular is that the price that you saw in the user interface before you shipped it off to the blockchain, that's the price that was present at the end of the last block that was mined. So we're looking at the last block that was mined. We're like, okay, this is the price that was on uniswap at the very end of the last block.
00:33:58.118 - 00:34:45.000, Speaker B: That's the price that we're showing users, that's how every single Dex works, every single Dex interface. And what happens is when you send your transaction off to the blockchain, other malicious participants in the network can view your transaction. They can view every transaction, and they know what you're trying to do before you do it. And so what they can do is they can do something called a sandwich attack, and they can put your trade in between two of their own trades, pushing the price up. So it's a very bad price. Then your trade goes through, then they push the price back down. And this is called a Sandwich attack.
00:34:45.000 - 00:35:36.840, Speaker B: The bots are on top of every single transaction where it's possible to pull this off. If your transaction can be sandwiched, there's going to be a bunch of bots competing to sandwich it every time. And what happens is that if you look at many of these different trades and compare the price in the UI versus the price that was mined on chain, what we find is there's like a negative average. The distribution of outcomes of slippage is heavily shifted towards negative slippage. So the user is losing money on average, or they're getting a worse price on average. Does that make sense?
00:35:37.390 - 00:35:55.280, Speaker C: Yeah, that part kind of like how MeV works and how kind of bots get in front of trades to take advantage of those opportunities. But then how do you fix it?
00:35:56.290 - 00:36:36.140, Speaker B: Yeah, so we simply base our routing on what will produce the best executed price on chain. So every time a user requests to trade some amount of tokens, instead of pointing them in the direction of a liquidity source that provides just the best sticker price, we factor slippage into the sticker price so that we're able to show a price that is reliable. You are going to get what you see and on average you're not going to be suffering from that slippage the same way.
00:36:36.750 - 00:36:51.550, Speaker C: Got it. Okay, so you're able to better determine the actual price of the trade. So traders aren't paying more than what they're seeing on the UI.
00:36:51.890 - 00:36:53.220, Speaker B: Yes, exactly.
00:36:55.270 - 00:37:14.418, Speaker C: But does that mean that, are traders actually beating bots? Are those sandwich attacks being avoided, or is it just more transparent? Do you just understand kind of what the final price will be for the trade?
00:37:14.594 - 00:38:06.870, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. So it's kind of both. When Zerox API's routing is evaluating two routes, instead of comparing the quoted prices for each of them, it will compare what it expects. The price will be inclusive of slippage, and it will route to the one that provides the best executed price inclusive of that slippage. In some cases, what that means is you'll go to a source that doesn't have any slippage. It could be like an RFQ, or it could be like a limit order. In other cases, it might say, okay, if you route your entire trade to this liquidity pool, you'll incur way more slippage than if we split that up and put it between two different liquidity pools, because that way, on average, you'll induce less slippage.
00:38:06.870 - 00:38:18.038, Speaker B: And so it's always looking to maximize the outcome for the user that actually hits the blockchain.
00:38:18.214 - 00:38:53.186, Speaker A: To swap crypto, a user has to choose among hundreds of dexes on multiple networks, all offering different rates and fees. Do you want to avoid that hassle? Swap on one inch. A Dex aggregator built to get you better rates than any single Dex. Enjoy unlimited liquidity across multiple networks and top level security. Get one inch on your phone now, or swap on Oneinch. IO. We've looked into the overarching Dex space, but what about Zero X itself? Zero X API is currently the fifth largest Dex by trading volume.
00:38:53.186 - 00:39:07.130, Speaker A: Matcha made by Zero X is the second largest Dex aggregator. But Zero X is structurally different to other dexs, such as uniswap. So how does it work? And what are some of the advantages and trade offs?
00:39:08.030 - 00:39:58.214, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Well, so this piece has gotten a little bit more nuanced over the years. Now, today, our team is, we're a proper kind of corporation, Zero X labs. And Zero X Labs is the original kind of creator and steward of Zero X protocol, kind of in the same way that Uniswap Labs is like the creator and steward of uniswap protocol. Zero X protocol is like a peer to peer exchange protocol. So with automated market makers, you're trading with a smart contract as your counterparty. Whereas with Zero X protocol, there is an entity on each, there's a peer on each side of that trade.
00:39:58.214 - 00:40:46.854, Speaker B: So you can go directly to your friend and email them this cryptographically signed order. They can go and complete a trade with you in a peer to peer manner. You can create like a peer to peer order book. You can do things like RFQ, where market makers are providing customized quotes just in time. There are many different ways to kind of propagate these protocol orders, but at the core of it's this message format for trading in a peer to peer way. And so my co founder Amir and I started working on Xerox protocol in October 2016. We released the white paper on our Ethereum in February 2017, we met our very first teammate through Reddit.
00:40:46.854 - 00:41:22.194, Speaker B: He read our white paper on there and reached out to us and was like, hey, this would be really useful for my project. We're like, you should come work for us. Work with us. And now today, we kind of view three layers to the Dex stack. There's like the application layer. So this is the consumer facing piece. It could be like DAP, like Matcha, or like a wallet, like metamask or Coinbase Wallet.
00:41:22.194 - 00:42:01.374, Speaker B: It could be, well, yeah, application layer, kind of the execution layer. This is where Xerox API sits, where it's providing liquidity aggregation from many different sources, like weaving it all together to achieve the best average price for the user. And now it has slippage protection. Then finally, the third layer that sits at the bottom is the trade settlement layer. So application, trade execution, trade settlement, and Zerox protocol is the trade settlement layer that sits underneath the entire stack. Zerox protocol is an open source project. It is Dow governed.
00:42:01.374 - 00:42:53.890, Speaker B: It has a community treasury. Our vision for Zero X, ever since 2017, has been that this should be public infrastructure that is governed and managed by a community of stakeholders. It feels like we're finally starting to see this model really become more viable, like a lot of really great dows that are operating pretty efficiently and autonomously. And that's our vision for the protocol. It's a public good, it's open source, it's out there. We're one of the big stakeholders as Zero X labs, but we're also building our own products on top of the protocol as a way to generate revenue, but also drive growth and adoption.
00:42:54.970 - 00:43:10.250, Speaker C: Yeah, super interesting. Okay, so on the DeX protocol level, like CRX protocol, that's where this peer to peer trade messaging system lies?
00:43:11.390 - 00:43:12.554, Speaker B: Yeah, that's correct.
00:43:12.672 - 00:43:53.560, Speaker C: Okay, so the protocol kind of works to connect traders peer to peer, rather than using kind of this function that automatically sets a price. Like traditional amms. Does it work more like an order book? Like there's different traders waiting to agree on a price, and then the protocol matches those traders. Is that kind of the difference?
00:43:54.890 - 00:45:16.450, Speaker B: Good question. So the protocol is really a messaging format. So it's not specifying, we call it off chain orders with on chain settlement. So it's this package of data that kind of specifies the details of a trade, what tokens are on either side, how many, how long is this order going to remain, something that you can go and fill, but how that message is passed from one party to another, or how it's stored and surfaced to the world, that is kind of out of scope for the protocol. It's really just focused on how do we support swapping arbitrary tokens in a way that is, in a system that is like modular, upgradable, can support future community standards, future types of cryptographic signing operations. And so it's really much more of like an upgradable system that accepts these messages. How those messages are generated and then kind of find their way to the counterparty is out of scope for the protocol.
00:45:16.450 - 00:46:40.990, Speaker B: But the ways that people have built systems on top of this protocol are there's kind of these formally peer to peer systems, like pseudoswap provided an interface where you could kind of manually enter in the details of a trade you wanted to do and click sign, and then you could copy it and paste it to a friend over slack, and then they could go and take that and fill that order on their end? There were also especially, like in the early days of Zero X, there were a lot of relayers that would take all these cryptographically signed orders and arrange them in the form of an order book and display them to you in kind of a traditional order book looking user interface. And then there's like the RFQ systems, where if a user wants to complete a trade, a market maker is pinged at that very moment. They generate and cryptographically sign a zero X order, and it's shipped off to the user in 100 milliseconds. And it's all the same. The message passing semantics are flexible, and the protocol itself is really just around trade settlement and supporting an ever evolving set of community standards.
00:46:42.130 - 00:47:03.380, Speaker C: That's so interesting. Okay, so the protocol is there to just gather all these messages around trades, and then it's up to developers outside of zero X to take those messages and actually execute trades in whatever kind of way that they.
00:47:05.910 - 00:47:46.798, Speaker B: And so I think one example that might resonate with a lot of folks is like, so like, Opensea uses a very similar Dex approach. So same idea. There's these off chain orders that are cryptographically signed, and they sit in OpenSEA's database, and it says, I'll swap this NFT for this amount of token. And when a counterparty comes along and wants to purchase that NFT, they take that cryptographically signed message from OpenSea's database, and then they sign it as well and send it off to the blockchain for processing and settlement. Same idea with zero X protocol.
00:47:46.974 - 00:47:47.506, Speaker A: Got it.
00:47:47.528 - 00:47:54.930, Speaker C: And then, is the zero x API a way to access those messages, or what's the connection?
00:47:55.270 - 00:48:52.200, Speaker B: Yeah, so zero X API is a complete liquidity aggregation as a service solution. It's a hosted API, endpoint for developers of apps and wallets. And what it does is it basically provides a way to support liquidity, aggregated swaps in your wallet or in your app. And it sources liquidity from zero X protocol orders, whether they're limit orders or RFQ orders. It sources liquidity from 95 plus different liquidity sources across seven different blockchains. Seem to be eight different blockchains. So if you want to get an asset, and you want to get it at the very best price, Xerox API is the most comprehensive solution, or at least we believe it is.
00:48:52.200 - 00:48:56.520, Speaker B: And so you'll always get the best price available.
00:48:56.970 - 00:49:23.040, Speaker C: Got it. Okay, so it's not just a way to access liquidity, it's a way to access, you know, as much liquidity as possible. And then the final layer that you guys built, the app layer, as you mentioned, and that's where matcha comes in. Is there kind of another application that you've built, or is matcha the kind of the main one?
00:49:24.150 - 00:49:49.798, Speaker B: Matcha is our main consumer facing product. We've also built user interfaces for zero X governance and a Zero X trade Explorer, et cetera. But, yeah, matcha is like its own consumer product. That is for opening up the world of tokens to everyone in the world. At least that's our goal.
00:49:49.974 - 00:50:11.662, Speaker C: Nice. Okay, and then before we continue on Zero X, I want to take a step back and just have your story. Why did you want to create Zero X in the first place? What was your goal with it?
00:50:11.796 - 00:51:14.270, Speaker B: Yeah, so I learned about bitcoin on Hacker News in 2011, 2012. And a good friend of mine who knew my wife, who was my girlfriend at the time, they also became super interested in bitcoin. They wrote like a paper on bitcoin for university back before anyone really knew what it, you know, we both were just interested. We thought it was interesting. So my wife Linda eventually went on and joined Coinbase pretty early on. It just seemed like bitcoin really had potential to have a broad impact globally at that point. And it had really advanced from a hobby project to something that could be really impactful.
00:51:14.270 - 00:52:15.250, Speaker B: And so she joined Coinbase. And through her being at Coinbase, I was a grad student doing a PhD in structural engineering at UC San Diego, and I also spent like a year and a half at Los Alamos National Lab in New Mexico doing physics research. And while I was doing that, know, Linda was at Coinbase doing amazing know, learning about all these cool things happening in the crypto space. And through her being at just, you know, basically became much more interested in crypto. And when Ethereum came out, it felt like the most important invention since the Internet, if you want to work on something that is going to have a broad impact. Ethereum was like, in my mind, one of the few opportunities that comes along in a decade or multiple decades to have a really big impact. And so I dropped out of grad school and moved to San Francisco with Linda.
00:52:15.250 - 00:53:20.310, Speaker B: She was nice and didn't charge me rent, so I could work on zero X and, you know, just focus on developing on Ethereum. I was initially developing a protocol for options tokens on Ethereum. The thinking being that crypto is too volatile for most use cases. And if there was a way to hedge against that volatility, then with options tokens, then that could make crypto more useful. I met my co founder Amir in San Francisco later in 2016, and we were introduced through our coworker, who was the one that wrote the paper about bitcoin with Linda back at UCSD in 2012 or something. And Amir and I were working on this options tokens project. We quickly realized that options tokens on Ethereum would be very useless without somewhere to go and trade them.
00:53:20.310 - 00:54:48.142, Speaker B: And there was no way a centralized exchange was going to support tokens for arbitrary options on arbitrary tokens on Ethereum, they would support bitcoin and litecoin pretty much. And so it became clear that someone needed to build decentralized markets infrastructure on Ethereum, so that any token on Ethereum could be exchanged. We were working on this more so as like a proprietary decentralized exchange product, that it would be more a proprietary product. But as we spent more time in San Francisco with the Ethereum developer community and met a bunch of projects like Auger for prediction markets, Gnosis, Mellonport, Makerdao, what they all had in common is that they were working on a use case that required exchange functionality. And exchange wasn't their core focus, but it was a necessary building block. So for example, Makerdao created their own proprietary decentralized exchange called Oasis Dex. And that was where market makers were able to provide the very first liquidity for DAi, the stablecoin.
00:54:48.142 - 00:55:41.178, Speaker B: And they were building this out of necessity. Same with Auger and gnosis. They both required markets to trade these prediction market outcomes. And so Amir and know became very clear to us that there are going to be so many use cases that require exchange functionality, there are going to be billions of tokenized assets that require exchange functionality. And so instead of building a product that is a decentralized exchange, we should build an open source public good exchange platform that anyone can build on top of and that can standardize kind of exchange. The, that was the initial vision for Xerox protocol. Now we're here.
00:55:41.264 - 00:55:49.462, Speaker A: When you shop for plane tickets, you probably use kayak, Expedia, or Google flights. So why would you limit yourself to just one exchange?
00:55:49.526 - 00:55:50.886, Speaker C: When you trade crypto?
00:55:50.998 - 00:56:33.320, Speaker A: To make sure you're getting the best possible price, you should use a Dex aggregator like matcha. Matcha routes your orders across all the various defi exchanges on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BSC, Phantom, Sello, and optimism to provide the best possible prices without taking any commissions. Matcha also has integrated fiat on ramps so you can buy directly with your credit or debit card, and uses smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources. When looking at the roadmap, has Xerox's vision evolved over time? Where will it be in 20 years? And in the medium term? What are the key milestones and projects you're aiming to roll out?
00:56:34.090 - 00:56:50.800, Speaker C: Has that vision changed over time? Like, what's kind of the big 1020 year idea? Where would you want Zero X to be?
00:56:52.530 - 00:57:46.750, Speaker B: First of all, our mission is to create a tokenized world where all value can flow freely. So Zero X, you know, Fabs, as an organization, that's our mission. We want to see a world where all forms of value are tokenized on public blockchains, like Ethereum. So fiat currencies, stocks, bonds, derivatives, startup equity, video game items, airline miles, Internet reputation points. We envision billions of different tokenized assets existing on blockchains. And that's the future that we've been working towards since the beginning. And it feels like in the last few years, we've really seen a lot of validation of this idea that tokenization is like the killer app for blockchains.
00:57:46.750 - 00:57:59.080, Speaker B: It's the movement and the transmission and the exchange of value. And so our focus has only, our conviction has only grown stronger in this tokenized world.
00:57:59.530 - 00:58:31.262, Speaker C: I love it. And then to start wrapping up. So that's kind of the big long term mission. What about just the next specific kind of milestones and projects that you're working on? I know that you recently raised a pretty large round with Greylock, I believe 70 million. So what are you planning to do with all this cash?
00:58:31.396 - 00:59:52.154, Speaker B: Yeah, we were fortunate to get to work with a really great group of supporters. Grey lock letter series be round. And the reason why we raised capital is because in order to achieve two things, so supporting this transition to like a multichain or cross chain blockchain ecosystem that requires an immense amount of building capacity. So at the beginning of 2021, it became clear to us that, okay, the transition to multichain is happening. Now, Ethereum has gotten such strong product market fit, there's so much demand for block space on Ethereum that it's way too expensive and it's pricing out so many different use cases, all of these users are going to spill over into other networks like Polygon. At the time, binance smart chain was one of the biggest ones, and now there are many different layer ones and L2s that have significant adoption. And so it became clear to us at the beginning of 2021, this transition is happening.
00:59:52.154 - 01:01:17.106, Speaker B: And as an organization, we need to be really focused on supporting what we think is going to be like a ten X or more expansion in the size of the ecosystem through new and more accessible and less expensive blockchains coming to market. And so, you know, we, you know, a large part of why we decided to raise our Series B round was so that we could scale our existing product offering. And while supporting basically this fractal scaling and fragmentation of the blockchain ecosystem, now, instead of aggregating liquidity across ten different liquidity sources on Ethereum, 20 sources on Ethereum, there's like seven different blockchains that we have to aggregate liquidity across. And each one of those blockchains has different tokens to support and different ecosystems to support. And so for us, it was like a matter of how do we support the growth of the entire ecosystem as effectively as possible? And that just requires more engineering and product and go to market resources.
01:01:17.298 - 01:01:25.720, Speaker C: So how big is your team now, and how big do you want it to get to actually be able to achieve all this?
01:01:26.730 - 01:02:39.174, Speaker B: So right now we're around 65 people, and we've been around for almost six years now. And I'd say throughout that entire time, we've taken a pretty measured approach to growth and hiring, really only growing when there was clearly a gap that needed to be filled. And I would say that we continue to be pretty measured in our hiring. That being said, we do have about 20 or 30 open roles we're actively hiring. And so if you're interested in considering one of the roles we have open, check them out@zerox.org. Jobs and yeah, so we're 65 ish, and we're looking to grow by 20 or 30 roles in the next six to eight months. So we currently support seven blockchains.
01:02:39.174 - 01:03:45.000, Speaker B: So Ethereum, polygon, binance, smart chain, optimism, celo, others, arbitram coming soon. And yeah, I think the biggest one that the most heavily requested blockchain that we don't support is like Solana and so big growing community on know lots, know activity and excitement around the use cases that are being built on Solana. It is a completely different kind of tech stack from the one that we are using to scale across different AVM blockchains. So it would require a specific technical skill set that we're hiring for. So if someone wants to come and join our team and help us support the Solana ecosystem as well, send us a message and we can talk.
01:03:45.930 - 01:03:57.180, Speaker C: It's pretty telling that the demand for Solana is such that projects are having to hire specifically to build that out, to build out that.
01:04:04.270 - 01:04:17.470, Speaker B: There'S a lot of demand for blockchains and block space. And Solana has done a pretty incredible job onboarding new users to the ecosystem.
01:04:17.810 - 01:04:39.190, Speaker C: And yeah, I'm about to wrap up. I'm just curious. On Solana, you keep hearing the main headlines besides kind of Solana phone and all this activity is also just like the, like, I don't know, are you worried about kind of just like performance of the Solana blockchain?
01:04:40.250 - 01:05:16.980, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a fair question. And I think that this probably goes beyond just outages. Also, a lot of people in the crypto space have strong opinions or philosophies on the important properties of a blockchain. The security guarantees, the consensus mechanism. And for us as well, we're true missionaries. We want to see decentralized finance and markets be available to everyone in the world and never go down. And decentralization is important.
01:05:16.980 - 01:06:34.954, Speaker B: At the same time, decentralized networks like Ethereum are so successful that they're too expensive to use. People are just willing to pay so, so much to use it. And in order to support this massive wave of new adoption, people that are setting up self custody wallets for the first time, for us, it's all a win win. These are all people that are going to be self custodying their assets, that are going to be educated about blockchain technology, and they're going to experience some of the rough edges that come with brand new cutting edge technology. So we're not dogmatic about which blockchains users decide to use. We're more so invested in getting them onboarded to the space and they can kind of educate themselves and make their own decisions about which blockchains they want to use and why. Over time, when it comes to things like outages for a blockchain, I do think those has a significant impact on user experience.
01:06:34.954 - 01:07:03.960, Speaker B: And so people that are using Solana and maybe there is network congestion. Well, now they're going to learn about network congestion. And how good is that? We're educating users about this technology that they're using. So in my mind, all of this technology is rapidly evolving, and it's pretty hard to make a judgment call on technology today because you never really know what it might end up looking like in three years.
01:07:05.050 - 01:07:10.840, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. Okay. And then now to really wrap up a final question.
01:07:12.650 - 01:07:13.414, Speaker A: How are you?
01:07:13.452 - 01:07:14.310, Speaker C: Defiant.
01:07:15.050 - 01:07:58.274, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. One of the ways that I'm defiant, that our team is defiant is that we don't necessarily buy into the current way that the world does things. We want to hire people that have exposure from all different cultures and parts of the world. We want the very best and most motivated and aligned people to come and spend time working with us. It doesn't matter which college you went to, it doesn't matter what. We just want folks that are bought in and long term aligned with our values.
01:07:58.274 - 01:08:07.580, Speaker B: And so we have team members from all over the world and couldn't be better.
01:08:08.350 - 01:08:36.850, Speaker C: So you want other defiers as part of the Zero X team. Nice. Will, thank you so much for taking the time. This has been awesome. Such an interesting conversation on Dexs, on Zero X, and just like, on this amazing, big tokenized vision for the world, which I also share. So thanks again. It's been a pleasure.
01:08:36.850 - 01:08:41.360, Speaker C: Close.
