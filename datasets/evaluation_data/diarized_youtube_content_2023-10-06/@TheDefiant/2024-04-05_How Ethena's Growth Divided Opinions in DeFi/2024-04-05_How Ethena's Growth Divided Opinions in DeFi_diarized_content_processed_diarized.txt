00:00:00.320 - 00:00:15.074, Speaker A: Makerdao is simply not the conservative protocol we used to love. That's pretty interesting. This move by Makerdao to add USDe asset collateral is prompting all these other lending protocols to reduce their exposure to dai.
00:00:18.374 - 00:00:19.214, Speaker B: Hi everyone.
00:00:19.334 - 00:00:39.218, Speaker A: Welcome to Crypto with Kami, where we go through all the main headlines in crypto and Defi in the past week in 30 minutes or less. This is a show for the week starting April 2, so these are the main topics and headlines for the show. There's tons of Athena news and it seems like Crypto Twitter simply cannot stop.
00:00:39.266 - 00:00:40.614, Speaker B: Talking about this project.
00:00:41.034 - 00:01:09.572, Speaker A: On a related note, TvL soared to $4 billion in just a few weeks. Crypto markets were volatile this week, turning lower, and stablecoin wars are heating up with PayPal and ripple making moves. Let's start with all the Athena news. For an in depth analysis on Athena and its many risks, check out the crypto with Cami episode I did on them, and also our podcast episode with.
00:01:09.588 - 00:01:12.300, Speaker B: The founder, which will be both linked.
00:01:12.332 - 00:01:36.762, Speaker A: In the description of this video. A TLDR is that uste that's Athena's synthetic dollar, is pegged to $1 and is backed with staked ETH, while also hedging staked ETH with short ETH positions on centralized exchanges. So that's how it maintains its peg.
00:01:36.858 - 00:01:41.450, Speaker B: On the one hand, it's long ETH via staked ETH.
00:01:41.562 - 00:02:38.104, Speaker A: On the other hand, it's short ETH with short positions. That's called kind of a delta strategy that has no up or down market exposure, and that's how it maintains its $1 peg. What's great about Athena's model is that thanks to its holding of stake ETH and to the funding rates it gets paid for taking short positions on ETH, it's able to pass on what right now is double digit yields onto its USDE holders. And so that's why it's grown so spectacularly, climbing to about 1.6 billion in market cap to become the fifth largest stablecoin only a couple of months after its launch. But there are several risks. One, it relies on centralized custodians for its crypto, which can be breached, censored, et cetera.
00:02:38.104 - 00:03:16.400, Speaker A: It takes short positions on centralized exchanges, which can fail. It also takes on lido risk. So Lido is a staking platform that issues Steth, or staked ETH. These are tokens representing ETH deposited on the Ethereum blockchain. If staked ETH de pegs or loses its value versus ETH, USDE will lose its collateral. Also its model relies on short position rates to remain positive. And that's been mostly the case as the market usually wants to go long crypto and not short.
00:03:16.400 - 00:03:33.524, Speaker A: So it pays short sellers. But if this turns around, then it means that instead of getting paid to take short positions, Athena will need to pay to hold these trades. So that was a TLDR or inhena again for in depth look at our video.
00:03:34.224 - 00:03:36.576, Speaker B: But this week the news was that.
00:03:36.760 - 00:04:30.064, Speaker A: Makerdao that's kind of considered the Defi grandfather, voted and chose to accept USDe as collateral for Daisy the stablecoin. That maker issues, and many were not happy. For context, maker is supposed to be the Defi central bank. It's supposed to be a more conservative protocol. So Makerdao approved in an executive proposal to set a debt ceiling of 100 million dai via the spark vault on Marfo, which is another lending protocol. So that would let investors borrow DAi against USDE on Morpho via this spark Dai vault. There so many different protocols involved.
00:04:30.064 - 00:05:48.344, Speaker A: This prompted Marc seller of AAVE that's the largest DeFi protocol by TvL to make a very drastic proposal of cutting the Dai collateral on AAVE to zero. So there was another smaller protocol called Nostra Finance, which also did the same. Mark Seller said this will mitigate potential contagion risk for AaVE users, and he told us at the defiant in an interview that Makerdao is simply not the conservative protocol we used to love. You know, that's pretty interesting. This move by Makerdao to add USDe asset collateral is prompting all these other lending protocols to reduce their exposure to DAi. And as these lending protocols fight over USD, so are DeFi and crypto heavyweights doing that on crypto Twitter? Andre Kronje, the yearn and Fantom founder, is the latest OG to weigh on Athena. He said that he sees red flags all over the place and that USD can lose its collateral if and when market conditions change.
00:05:48.344 - 00:06:35.202, Speaker A: We talked to Nick Carter and Ryan Watkins, who had praised Athena before, and they both stand their ground. They continue defending the project, saying that it's sound. Nick Carter went as far as to say that those criticizing Athena are just chasing cloud. So you'll notice that Makerdao did not add USDE directly, but like I mentioned, it did so via Morpho and Spark. This mitigates risk somewhat, according to Monet supply of Block Analytica. And he's also a holder of maker and frequently participates in Makerdao forums. The order of who would be on the hook if anything happens to USDE would be first the Ethina Insurance fund.
00:06:35.398 - 00:06:38.946, Speaker B: Next would be Dai borrowers on Morpho Labs.
00:06:39.050 - 00:07:55.564, Speaker A: After that would be the maker Dao surplus buffer and last would be maker holders. So like I said, the fact that Maker is adding USD collateral via Morpho and spark mitigates losses for maker holders and Makerdao a little bit. Something else to note in this kind of maker Dao versus Aave fight is that AavE is now issuing its own stablecoin called Go G h o. And Maker, like I said, is the issuer of Dai. So Maker and Abe are now more direct competitors. And this is just speculation at this point, but it could, it could be that part of the proposal to take down Dai collateral from another issuer of a stablecoin could be more strategic and have other implications other than just considering the risks involved in USDE. If this is the case and it continues to happen in DeFi, it would be super interesting shift from the money legos compostability, everyone wins mentality.
00:07:55.564 - 00:08:39.384, Speaker A: Two, maybe we would be starting to see a more competitive mindset emerging among the different protocols. Not saying this is the case and not saying this is the motivation behind the Abe proposal, but it's not something to completely rule out. Makerdao and Ave are at the end of the day offering the same type of assets, the same type of service, more or less. So there could be a more kind of strategic competitive strategy happening here. So something to watch.
00:08:41.164 - 00:08:41.904, Speaker B: Next.
00:08:42.684 - 00:09:12.952, Speaker A: Still on Athena news, we had the ENA launch this week. That's Ethina's token. It's obviously very widely expected. They airdropped 750 million ENA. That's 5% of the total token supply. And the token quickly touched 1 billion in market cap after the launch. It's now at around 1.3
00:09:12.952 - 00:09:18.804, Speaker A: billion in market cap and 14.6 billion in fully diluted valuation.
00:09:19.684 - 00:09:29.104, Speaker B: So, you know, massive, massive numbers. And you know, this much awaited airdrop.
00:09:29.484 - 00:09:59.544, Speaker A: Came six weeks after Athena's shards campaign or points program. The campaign was incentivizing traders who posted collateral in exchange for future distribution of ENA. So those users are now able to cash out. But if you missed out on ENA Airdrop, don't be too sad because there's a season two coming, so there will be future airdrops down the line.
00:10:01.244 - 00:10:14.924, Speaker B: There was the kickoff of the second phase of Athena's incentives program this week, which is called the SATS campaign. Sats after bitcoin's smaller unit, and in.
00:10:14.964 - 00:10:22.104, Speaker A: This phase, the project will onboard bitcoin as collateral for the protocol in addition to staked ETH.
00:10:24.764 - 00:10:41.214, Speaker B: Now related to Athena's points. Pendle, which is a really interesting protocol that enables degens to trade on points.
00:10:43.394 - 00:11:20.324, Speaker A: Just has been exploding recently. So it's total value locked went parabolic in the past two weeks, increasing by 40% and climbing to $4 billion, in part as traders were using Pendle to get exposure to the Athena airdrop with leverage. So there was a Defi investor on who posted this on Twitter. He said that $10,000 invested in usde yield tokens on Pendle returned over 80,000 worth of EnA tokens.
00:11:20.904 - 00:11:54.524, Speaker B: So investors are now looking ahead to accumulate points towards Athena's season two airdrop via Pendle as well. And like I mentioned before, this season two phase for Athena is all about bitcoin, and the protocol just added bitcoin as collateral. So the move should allow it to scale because now it won't only have access to staked ethos collateral, but also the much more liquid bitcoin market.
00:11:54.904 - 00:13:19.714, Speaker A: For perspective, Ethina's short positions have ballooned to 20% of total ether open interest, according to the project. That's just massive. So they estimate that bitcoin collateral could enable it to scale USD by 250%. Something to note here is that unlike state ETH, bitcoin doesn't have native staking yield to offer to holders, but I guess the fact that it'll allow USD to scale compensates for the fact that it doesn't have yields. Staying on the topic of points and airdrops, circuit and Ethereum layer two has quietly amassed more than 1 billion worth of ETH and ETH staking derivatives just six weeks after opening its doors to deposits. And what do you think is behind this rise in TVL? Of course, surprise, surprise, a points campaign circuit launched its points campaign on February 24, allowing users to stake ETH and ETH staking derivatives in exchange for earning circuit points, which of course are expected to qualify holders for a future airdrop. In addition to the yield and points accumulated by the deposited assets.
00:13:19.714 - 00:13:59.464, Speaker A: The project followed up with its build to earn program on March 27, and that's incentivizing developers to build infrastructure tooling and deploy dapps on top of circuits testnets still more on airdrops wormhole, the popular cross chain bridge airdropped its w token this week, and it immediately landed the token in the top hundred tokens by market cap on Coingecko. With a market cap of about 3 billion, Wormpol plans to airdrop 1.1 billion tokens to early adopters over the next four months.
00:14:00.444 - 00:14:18.532, Speaker B: Now onto markets after ending March. On a high note, crypto markets are bringing in the new month with about a volatility, with bitcoin down 4% this week and ETH is down 6.5%. So that was in line with global.
00:14:18.588 - 00:14:33.964, Speaker A: Markets, which also turned lower as the dollar index hit a six week high this week. Notably, hedge funds are taking record short positions against bitcoin.
00:14:35.424 - 00:14:57.338, Speaker B: Hedge funds have built up about 80,000 bitcoin in shorts, and that's worth about 5.4 billion in today's prices. And one possible explanation for this extreme a short position is the basis trade.
00:14:57.506 - 00:15:51.828, Speaker A: Which looks to profit from the difference between the bitcoin spot price and its future price. So by buying spot bitcoin and opening an equal size short futures position, traders can capture the difference in price when prices converge at expiry. So June futures are currently trading at a 3% premium. So traders are betting that difference will convert and they'll be able to pocket that difference. Okay, now on to stablecoin news. Both PayPal and Ripple made moves this week. PayPal's cross border money transfer service, Zoom, will allow us based customers to convert us dollars into PyUSD.
00:15:51.828 - 00:16:09.264, Speaker A: That's PayPal stablecoin and send to people in 160 different countries. So PayPal is increasing use cases for its PY USD stablecoin, a really interesting something to watch.
00:16:10.884 - 00:16:25.154, Speaker B: And this will be done with no fees associated for sending funds. So really nice use case for remittances and any sort of cross border transfer.
00:16:25.974 - 00:16:34.550, Speaker A: Now, Ripple announced that it's launching its own stablecoin. It makes sense.
00:16:34.582 - 00:16:43.204, Speaker B: Like Ripple has been this OG payments network. It's kind of surprising now that I think about it, that they don't have a stablecoin.
00:16:43.544 - 00:17:27.254, Speaker A: So according to them, the new stablecoin will be 100% backed by a dollar deposit, short term us government treasuries, and other cash equivalents similar to USDC, USDT and other fiat backed stablecoins. Interestingly, it's an ERC 20 token. It's a stable coin that's on the Ripple ledger, but actually it's an Ethereum token. That's super interesting news. Vana is a decentralized network hosting user owned data set models, and they announced the launch of a Reddit data Dao.
00:17:27.594 - 00:18:15.894, Speaker B: On top of this network. The Dao plans to incentivize Reddit users to contribute their comment history to a pooled dataset, which can then be sold to AI companies following a community vote. So this was not done in conjunction to Reddit. But it's, this startup wants users to leverage their Reddit data and feed it to AI models and sell it to them. So it's kind of empowering users to own and sell their data. I thought, you know, really interesting stuff. Next, there's a proposal by an Ethereum developer to reduce ETH issuance.
00:18:15.894 - 00:18:46.704, Speaker B: He said that the rewards curve hasn't changed since the merge and it should be updated. This, of course, drew a lot of pushback as it, you know, it messes with Ethereum based yield and return and rewards. And so this is still in discussion. Something to watch. Dex trading volume rose to an all time high of 260 billion in March.
00:18:46.784 - 00:18:49.240, Speaker A: Driven by meme coin traders.
00:18:49.392 - 00:19:47.284, Speaker B: This is really interesting. I mean, we're just beginning a bull market, and Dex, the Dex volume is already at an all time high, of course, you know, driven by the hot topic or hype of the moment, which is meme coins. And speaking of meme coins, Vitalik Buterin and Arthur Hayes weighed in on the meme coin frenzy. They were both arguing towards these tokens, utility and value. Still on Ethereum, the restaking and staking sector continues to grow, with the total value locked in liquid restaking tokens climbing to a new all time high of $8.5 billion. It's insane how quickly and how much this new sector of crypto has grown.
00:19:47.284 - 00:21:14.774, Speaker B: Matt Hogan of Bitwise, who we had in the podcast, recently, predicts there will be $1 trillion entering crypto markets from institutions buying the spot bitcoin ETF. He said just 1% allocation of tradfi portfolios would translate into a 1 trillion entering the crypto market, also related to ETF's. The SEC asked for public comment on ethereum's ETF's, which caused a short lived celebration on crypto Twitter after. But it ended quickly after James Safart, ETF analyst for Bloomberg, said that asking for public comments on these types of filings is standard procedure and nothing to be excited about. Finally, I urge you guys to look at this feature, and not just because I'm chilean, but because it's very interesting to see that Chile is standing out to lead Latin America for crypto regulation. They have passed a fintech law that creates a specific category for crypto assets, giving a transparent framework for crypto. And this is interesting because Chile is not known.
00:21:14.774 - 00:21:37.384, Speaker B: It doesn't stand out within the region for being hugely crypto friendly or for having a lot of or very high crypto adoption. But it's still providing this new law that hopefully will give clarity for the community there. And that's it for this week.
00:21:37.544 - 00:21:47.564, Speaker A: Let me know what you think. Let me know your thoughts on Athena. Is Makerdao being reckless by adding USCC as collateral?
00:21:48.384 - 00:22:03.074, Speaker B: Are people exaggerating the risks? And yeah, I hope you enjoyed this and join me next week. Thanks so much. It.
