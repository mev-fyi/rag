00:00:04.890 - 00:00:37.480, Speaker A: This week on the defined podcast, we speak with Hart Lambert, co founder of the UMA protocol. UMA is an optimistic oracle on ethereum that aims to record any knowable truth onto a blockchain. Hart was also CEO of Openfolio, a personal finance tracking platform, and before that he was a U. S. Treasury trader for Goldman Sachs. Before we get into Oracles and Uma, what are hard stakes on this current market? If this is Crypto's Lehman moment, how does it compare with the actual Lehman moment from someone who lived through.
00:00:39.450 - 00:01:10.642, Speaker B: It's actually, it's pretty interesting if you compare. So I have a story where during the financial crisis, I'm on Goldman's trading desk, I'm a treasury trader sitting beside the swaps traders, and Lehman is actually going bankrupt. And I'm there on the weekend, which is not something you usually do because there's nothing to trade. But I'm there on the weekend because we're trying to figure out what's going on. And the swaps desk in particular has no idea what their risk is. Not to the closest billion dollars. Right.
00:01:10.642 - 00:01:46.910, Speaker B: Because they have all this swaps. There's so much opacity in the swaps market and nobody knows who their counterparty is, whether their counterparty is solvent, whether they're going to make good on their margin calls, like all this stuff. And it was wild, right? And I'm a young guy at this point. It's wild to sit there at Goldman Sachs, supposedly the kind of the center of capitalism. They're like, no idea what their risk is because nobody in the market knew what their risk. You know, this is a sales pitch for Defi. Like Defi does solve this.
00:01:46.910 - 00:02:15.158, Speaker B: There is can. This is exactly what needed to exist back then where you could see who your risks are. It's transparent on chain. You can see whether you're collateralized or who needs to be liquidated or all that kind of stuff. That is a wonderful thing. The crisis we have right now is not a defi crisis. It's a crisis of a bunch of centralized entities that are using some defi products here and there.
00:02:15.158 - 00:02:53.780, Speaker B: But it's a bunch of centralized entities that have no idea what their risks are because they're using centralized financial tools and they aren't using the innovations that DeFi has brought us in terms of transparency and seeing where your risks are and all, I mean, again, I think you can say that the three arrows thing and then the contagion into all these other businesses, into Celsius and all that, that does look like Lehman a lot. But it looks like Lehman on the centralized finance side of things, on the traditional finance side of things, not the DeFi thing where compound and Ave have held up great. As an example.
00:02:55.110 - 00:03:49.750, Speaker C: I think it's such a great point. And this issue of counterparty risk is exactly what's been kind of the most damaging aspect of the crypto crash of this year. Right. It's like not knowing how much of Celsius is missing or how much three arrows borrowed and how much needs to be repaid, because all of that is opaque and untrackable, untraceable. And yeah, that looks a lot like 2008. So it's like, why rebuild this financial system using crypto, like the assets. Celsius is kind of borrowing and lending crypto assets, but they're not using.
00:03:49.750 - 00:04:07.126, Speaker C: These CFI entities are not using crypto rails, which actually improve, were supposed to improve on the traditional financial system. But it looks like they're just, like, falling on the same issues that we saw back in 2008.
00:04:07.228 - 00:05:03.760, Speaker B: Yes, 100%. And I mean, again, the mistakes or the crisis, the contagion is happening at the institutional level. And at the institutional level, they're using the tools of opaque agreements and financial, like, opaque bespoke agreements and unsecured loans and all this stuff that's really just tradfi tools that institutions have access to. At the retail level, it's not so much. The disastrous part here is that Celsius sold a product to retail users and then effectively gambled their money away with a bunch of other untoward stuff. And I don't know all the details of the Celsius thing, and I shouldn't point fingers before I know all the details, but the evidence looks like the retail people all had transparency and then the institutions all gambled their money away. And that seems bad.
00:05:04.850 - 00:05:58.958, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. I'm wondering kind of your thoughts on whether it seems feasible that in the future, most of transactions and just the financial system will be happening in a more transparent on chain way. Because I don't know, there's a reason why so much money was in CFI. It's just easier to use and maybe at least there is some degree of the feeling of a safety net and so on. I don't know if you see a path where more and more funds are going to defi so that we can prevent this in the future.
00:05:59.124 - 00:06:58.450, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we could have a very long conversation on that, because I've spent a lot of time thinking about this. Another way of framing your question, Cammy, would be like, what are the barriers to CFI using DeFI today. And some of the barriers, I think, are pretty real institutions, or like centralized institutions, first of all, generally need a concept of an undo button where if something goes wrong, they can undo things, and they have that in the form of legal recourse. You go and you sue somebody. DeFi doesn't really work that way. And hopefully later on we'll talk about how I actually think of DeFi as an invention of law, like a new type of law system, of legal contracting system, more than an invention in finance, which we can get into. But the CFI institutions, they don't have an undo button in terms of legal recourse in DeFi, at least not by default.
00:06:58.450 - 00:07:56.334, Speaker B: They also don't have a concept of identity, which brings up all kinds of problems when it comes to anti terrorism, anti muddering, laundering and all that kind of stuff. And then the centralized institutions, which are very much regulated, they have regulators that are attempting to regulate defi like it's a legal, traditional financial contract, when it's just not, it's a different beast. So I think those three hurdles are reasons why centralized institutions are not able to use DeFi at scale right now. And I do think that will get unlocked. But there's a lot of wood to chop there. There's a lot of work to do, and I think it's a process, and I think it's going to move slow, but is what it is. In the interim, I think DeFi grows in its own ecosystem, and it grows and builds all this useful plumbing like we've seen over the last couple of years, and it just gets better and better as sort of a product offering.
00:07:56.334 - 00:08:07.318, Speaker B: It just works better and better and better, and CFI is going to want to use it more and more and more. And then the reasons, the barriers to that actual usage get figured out as time goes on.
00:08:07.404 - 00:08:41.970, Speaker A: To swap crypto, a user has to choose among hundreds of Dexs on multiple networks, all offering different rates and fees. Do you want to avoid that hassle? Swap on one inch. A Dex aggregator built to get you better rates than any single Dex. Enjoy unlimited liquidity across multiple networks and top level security. Get one inch on your phone now, or swap on Oneinch IO. So we know heart's market insights. But what about Uma? As mentioned, from the outset, it aims to record external information onto blockchains.
00:08:41.970 - 00:08:48.760, Speaker A: We talk about the crucial problem it's solving and why it shifted away from structuring derivatives products.
00:08:49.210 - 00:09:48.200, Speaker B: So back in early 2018, I had worked at Goldman and I'd seen all these OTC swaps and derivatives and all that. And I studied computer science university and kind of technical that way. And sitting there and I'm looking at smart contract platforms like Ethereum. And to me it was just an obvious way to write financial contracts. It seemed like a really useful way where you could use a public blockchain to write contracts that enforce payments between two or more counterparties. And so our original idea here, and this is again before DeFi as a term was invented, was to focus on how to make our kind of original idea was how to make risk universally accessible. How do we make it a protocol for risk transfer? And that brought us down the path of thinking through what sort of financial contracts like derivatives might look like in the blockchain space.
00:09:48.200 - 00:10:04.138, Speaker B: But to go back and answer your question, our goal here was to make financial products and services universally accessible, which is where the name comes from. UMA stands for universal market access. And that was the mission.
00:10:04.314 - 00:11:02.800, Speaker C: Okay, so the mission was to make financial instruments universally accessible. And the way to do that initially was through these derivative type of tokens, right. That people were able to build on the UMA protocol. I remember just covering it, I don't know, on the very first issues of the defiant kind of covering UMA and the launch and just like the early crazy tokens that people were creating. So it's just like very exciting time. And now I'm really interested in this shift from derivatives and tokenizing different things into more kind of the oracle aspect of the solution. Why did that shift happen?
00:11:03.670 - 00:11:55.970, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. So to back up, when we're talking about making finance universally accessible, I kind of break financial contracts down into two components. One is like the logic of what's supposed to happen. The if this, then that of a contract, and the other is the oracle component, like the data, that's the input to what should happen. And so if you think of an insurance contract as a really kind of clean example here where an insurance contract says like, okay, if this event happens, make this payout, and if it doesn't, don't make that payout. Right. The logic is very simple and then the oracle component is actually arguably pretty difficult here where it's like, did that event happen or not? And you can kind of actually work that logic through to everything.
00:11:55.970 - 00:12:44.414, Speaker B: So including like compound or ave, like a lending protocol, make this loan at this interest rate and don't liquidate provided that the price stays above this. And it all kind of works with these two interwoven components. Back originally we were looking at trying to make markets universally accessible. And we were thinking, okay, well, first of all, Defi doesn't exist yet. What do people want to use it for? How can we actually pique people's interests? We were figuring that out while we were also working on our own version of the oracle problem. And we had a very specific design or idea on how to solve the oracle problem, which we can get into. And originally we're like, well, we have this oracle that can be used to get data for anything.
00:12:44.414 - 00:13:38.862, Speaker B: So let's build synthetic tokens. Let's build people like tokens. Tokens are understandable. Let's build tokens that can track anything. And that was our original kind of synthetic token concept where we're going to use this as one version, one type of contract that we could use our oracle for to showcase to the ecosystem what this oracle could do. And we did take, people created all these crazy tokens, some that were useful, tokens that tracked the price of gas on Ethereum, tokens that tracked a basket of stocks on Wall street bets, tokens that tracked the ETH bitcoin rate, like relative rate, which is like a pretty interesting one. Tokens that track bitcoin dominance.
00:13:38.862 - 00:14:20.400, Speaker B: A whole bunch of things got produced. But we've sort of realized as the market has evolved, the demand for those synthetic tokens. I don't think it's that strong right now. People in crypto are mainly interested in trading around other crypto. And I actually have views that real world assets which are kind of in vogue on crypto Twitter right now, real world assets are not particularly of interest to a lot of crypto users right now. And so we realized that our better way of showcasing what UMA can do is to focus on our oracle concept and how it is an oracle that lets you get any arbitrary bit of data which we can get into.
00:14:21.090 - 00:15:23.090, Speaker C: Okay, super interesting. So the synthetic tokens were a kind of use case or demonstration of what the UmA oracle could, you know, instead of going like falling down that path, you guys decided let's just focus on the oracle itself. And so, yeah, let's get into what's special about the UMA protocol because I guess there's, Chainlink is like the big kind of protocol, I mean, sorry, the application or project kind of providing oracles for the blockchain ecosystem. So if you can maybe explain kind of how Uma's oracle works and how it compares with Chainlink, which I believe is it kind of the leading provider at the moment in kind of oracles?
00:15:23.670 - 00:16:08.740, Speaker B: Well, it certainly has a lot of usage, and they do a good job. So Chainlink is used by a lot of Defi protocols for price feeds. And really the most commonly used price feeds are the price of Ethereum in dollars, the price of bitcoin in dollars, the price of major cryptocurrencies in dollars. And Chainlink functions as an oracle that pushes data to the blockchain. So it pushes price updates onto a blockchain periodically, and they sign that data to say that it's correct and valid. And this design, I do think there are some weaknesses in the design, but I'm not a chain Linkator and I'm not a chain link cater at all. There's a big passionate community out there.
00:16:08.740 - 00:17:06.254, Speaker B: What Uma does, though, is very different, is it doesn't sit there and push data onto a blockchain. It functions as what we call an optimistic oracle. And the concept is really quite simple, where any application, any contract, can make a request for any piece of knowable data, any piece of arbitrary data at all, they make a request. So, like, who won the tennis match last night? And anyone at all is able to respond to that question. If no one challenges that response in a given challenge window, which can be set to different lengths, but let's say it's 2 hours, if nobody challenges that, disputes that answer, then that response is taken as truth. So optimistically, we assume people to respond truthfully. And that's the core idea of this optimistic concept.
00:17:06.254 - 00:17:17.986, Speaker B: So the difference here is you have to wait this challenge period to get your data, but you can ask absolutely anything that is knowable and you're not limited to a set of price feeds.
00:17:18.098 - 00:17:24.358, Speaker C: No. What's the incentive for the people who answer those questions to answer truthfully?
00:17:24.454 - 00:17:48.210, Speaker B: Well, I'm skipping ahead of some of the details, but at every layer of this, there's economic incentives. So the person that responds to a question can get paid a reward. Sometimes that reward is not needed. Sometimes there's like a natural reason why people want to respond to these questions. But anyone that responds to a question has to post a bond. They have to stake something of value. So they have skin in the game.
00:17:48.210 - 00:18:08.630, Speaker B: And if they get disputed, and the dispute turns out that the person that responded originally was incorrect, that original responder loses their bond and it goes to the person that disputed them. So basically, at every layer of the system, we have these economic incentives at work that keep people honest because they have skin in the game.
00:18:08.780 - 00:18:12.850, Speaker C: And who resolves a dispute, that's where.
00:18:12.860 - 00:18:24.558, Speaker B: It gets super interesting. And that's the part that we spent a lot of time building, like way back in 2018, 2019, Vitalik wrote or came up with. All the good ideas come from Vitalik. We know this, right?
00:18:24.724 - 00:18:26.000, Speaker C: Yeah. Basically.
00:18:27.730 - 00:19:16.222, Speaker B: Vitalik wrote a post called shelling Coin back in 2014. And it was a design for a shelling point like oracle system where people voted in secret. You paid the people that voted with the majority a reward and you penalized those that didn't. And you could show that this system would respond truthfully under certain assumptions, basically under the assumption that no one controlled more than half of the token supply or the voting supply. So we expanded on that and that's something that we've built and that's the premise of what UMa does. It is this shelling point voting system where Uma token holders, when there is a dispute, they vote in secret. There's a commit reveal scheme, so they vote what they think the truth is.
00:19:16.222 - 00:20:09.150, Speaker B: And we can prove with game theory that the system, it's incentivized to vote the truth, the actual truthful answer provided nobody controls more than half of our token supply. And so it's a really cool design that's been operating in production for a couple of years now and it works. I don't want to say that we've got everything figured out and works flawlessly, but it's worked better than I expected, where we're able to ask lots and lots of questions at the optimistic oracle level. So you can think of this as a layered system. The optimistic oracle, if we stay optimistic, we can ask all these questions and there's no disputes and we just move on. It's fast and easy. And then when there is a dispute, it gets escalated to all of our token holders who vote in this shelling point voting system.
00:20:09.150 - 00:20:49.740, Speaker B: And that has worked really well and it's resolved a bunch of really interesting questions, most notably polymarket, which is an information market or a prediction market. Polymarket, they were resolving their questions in a centralized way until earlier this year and they've switched to our system and they're using it to ask, it's like 50 questions a day about who won various sports games or whether, who won an election or whether things happened. And that system has just been working in a purely decentralized way pretty flawlessly since they switched over.
00:20:50.110 - 00:20:52.714, Speaker C: As builders continue to innovate and adoption.
00:20:52.762 - 00:21:14.260, Speaker A: Ramps up, Avalanche is striving to design the premier scaling solution for web3. Avalanche subnets let you minimize transaction costs and maximize your speed, consistency and user experience. Scale with Avalanche Subnet and experience web3 like never before. Head to Avax network to learn more.
00:21:14.970 - 00:21:48.880, Speaker C: Oh, cool. Okay. How many people are participating in this system, like, resolving disputes, answering questions? Yes. Is it like a liquid kind of market? And just, like, if you can give me a sense of that and how many questions are asked per day, I'm looking to kind of gauge the activity that's going on.
00:21:49.570 - 00:22:20.762, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's like 20 to 50 questions that are getting asked per day right now. And it's hard to know exactly the number of people responding because there's some civil problems or whatever. They're behind addresses. So we don't totally know, but we do have a reasonably diversified group of people that are responding to these. And, Cami, I should actually back up, too. Some of the questions that get asked can be responded to by bots, too.
00:22:20.762 - 00:22:58.818, Speaker B: Some of them are like, questions that you don't need a human to type in the answer. You can run a machine to do so. So there's a combination of both questions that are being answered by humans and questions that are being answered by machines. And all of them. We have fairly diversified. It's not like hundreds of people, but it's 50 ish people that are sort of actively engaged in answering these things. And then disputes are a little bit harder for us to get data on because they don't happen that frequently.
00:22:58.818 - 00:23:15.354, Speaker B: But disputes have been triggered to date. Disputes have been triggered every time they need to be triggered, which is good. And there is some diversity in terms of who is triggering those disputes, too. So it's pretty cool.
00:23:15.552 - 00:23:24.750, Speaker C: So so far, have any questions gone through with incorrect answers?
00:23:25.730 - 00:24:41.078, Speaker B: Not yet. Well, I'll back up and say that some of the disputes that have been escalated have been things that are contentious. And I think that there is more than one right answer to. And in those circumstances, the right response of the system, in my opinion, should be to put forth the most reasonable of these reasonable responses, like, what is the best answer? So some of these are like, get into some technicals, like, should we be responding to the question based on the spirit of what was asked or very nit picky about the wording and the words, right. And I think depending on the facts and circumstances, you can actually look at it and see, like, okay, well, both are not wrong, but one makes more sense. And generally speaking, I think this is a huge benefit of our system, where we do have human judgment involved here. There is sort of like, if something gets disputed, it's getting debated by these humans that are exercising their own human judgment to figure out what the right answer is.
00:24:41.078 - 00:25:29.110, Speaker B: And it handles a lot of edge cases, much more elegantly than I think you're able to if you just program it in code. My whole thesis here is that disputes, disputes and data is very hard to get absolutely perfect in real time. I would actually argue, I think it's impossible to get data perfect in real time. There's always edge cases, there's always scenarios that don't quite make sense. And so I think that our system at its core is trying to insert a layer of human judgment as the final step in sort of understand in resolving disputes about what the right answer should be.
00:25:29.260 - 00:25:55.150, Speaker C: Super interesting, do you think, could people make participate in answering questions and solving disputes as a way of gaining kind of additional income? How much can someone expect to earn from answering questions correctly?
00:25:55.730 - 00:26:45.630, Speaker B: I think so. Again, there's both really cool and kind of scary versions of that too. Right. I think it would be very cool to be able to have an economy running through this, and we do right now at some scale, but we're also not trying to trap people into this machinery and just have them sit there, like responding to questions. Right. But I do think it's not like it's play to earn, right? But it sort of is too. It's like, hey, if you can reasonably respond to this question, you can make money off of it, and you are providing both on the proposing questions and on disputing them.
00:26:45.630 - 00:27:39.120, Speaker B: And the reward for dispute, for getting a correct dispute is substantially higher. Right. So I think it is really cool if you can have humans watching this system, and if you want, like a really weird analogy, but that's actually kind of fun. You can actually think of this voting process as like a human powered blockchain where every voting cycle is basically one block, and a bunch of humans are sort of being like, hey, what is the right answer here? They're sort of establishing consensus, and in this case, they're using the Ethereum blockchain as their way of writing down what they all think the right answer is. Right. But as long as we have one honest participant that disputes things, it functions, and I think that's super cool.
00:27:40.130 - 00:28:39.940, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd love to hear kind of some specific use cases for this. We talked a little bit before about how maybe this can be used to improve how dows are working. We've been talking a lot about Daos and just how the Dao model has worked so far. In the podcast, we had Joseph DeLong in the previous episode, Hasu speaking about their experiences with Maker and sushi, and there's obviously a ton of work to do. Before DAOs can just successfully run organizations. So wondering how can potentially maybe oracles make governance and just like execution in DAos better? What do you think?
00:28:40.870 - 00:29:33.620, Speaker B: I think there's a huge use case there. One of the sort of dirty secrets about a lot of crypto right now in Defi and web3 is that there are these points of centralization that usually take the form of multifigs. And so people kind of like hand wave away and say, hey, we have this multi sig, but it's no big deal. It's not a point of centralization, but it kind of is, right? Yeah. And so I think if you step back and you look at a lot of snapshot votes, like many governance systems that use snapshot, the snapshot vote happens. That's great. But then it's up to a multi sig to actually go and execute the vote, right? And the multi sig could just choose not to or choose to veto the vote or whatever else, and that isn't very good.
00:29:33.620 - 00:30:37.590, Speaker B: So one of the cool use cases for optimistic oracles, like what we've built is for enforcing contracts or enforcing or basically repeating back data that is off chain onto a blockchain. So in the use case of governance, a very useful and simple question would be, did this snapshot vote pass? And you can ask this oracle system, ask our optimistic oracle, did this governance vote pass? If so, execute this transaction? If not, don't. And it's a very clean and very simple way to get around the centralization of a multisig. So an angle we are actively going down is basically looking at where multi sigs are and asking the question, could our optimistic oracle replace them? And I think in most cases it can. So that's like a real useful place for getting kind of further decentralizing dows and Dow governance.
00:30:38.490 - 00:31:22.086, Speaker C: So how would that, like, would a vote have to happen? And then this contract would have to be established beforehand, like a contract that says if this vote passes and is approved, then do this and then the opposite. Like if it passes and it's rejected, then do something else. And so you'd have to write both of those contracts on Uma beforehand. Then the vote happens and then those contracts get executed thanks to the Oracle. Is that how it would work?
00:31:22.268 - 00:31:57.198, Speaker B: We can make it simpler than is. This is something we're launching very soon, in the next few weeks, too. So we have another brand we call outcome, outcome finance. We actually launched this recently because we've been creating so many of these Dow tooling things. We wanted to create a home for them. So we created this brand called outcome finance. The tagline is, we want to help Daos achieve positive outcomes, and it's using a lot of our Oracle techniques, but we're launching something that we're tentatively calling optimistic governance.
00:31:57.198 - 00:32:46.098, Speaker B: And it follows in the lines of what Safesnap did to give them credit here. But it's basically a connection between a gnosis multi sig and snapshot. And it's a bit of code that we've written that says, now when I propose my snapshot vote, I include the transaction that I want to have be executed. And in my gnosis safe I okay this contract to execute transactions that pass our oracle. And then it's like a one button click and it's a seamless process. So now when a snapshot vote is proposed, if it's passed, it asks the optimistic oracle, hey, I think this vote passed. I want to execute it.
00:32:46.098 - 00:33:20.060, Speaker B: And as long as nobody disputes it, that transaction will be allowed to get executed in the nosis safe. So, very seamless, actually, in some ways removes the centralization of a multisig, also makes it for less work for the multisig signers. They don't have to sit around and sign these transactions. And as a multi sig signer myself, that's both a pain and a chore and also kind of scary because I don't always know what I'm signing. So we think it's a pretty cool use case, and that's something we're going to roll out in the next couple of weeks.
00:33:20.430 - 00:33:22.042, Speaker C: I wanted to let you know about.
00:33:22.096 - 00:33:58.680, Speaker A: A 16 C's new podcast called Web three with a 16 C.

Be sure to follow it now.
00:33:58.680 - 00:34:20.510, Speaker A: Dells continue to be a source of debate within the space. There's constant discussion regarding management, the issues surrounding governance, and relying too heavily on multi sigs. Hart talks about the DAO model and how Uma's cross chain bridge and Dow tooling can potentially help decentralize and automate some Dow processes.
00:34:22.610 - 00:34:42.290, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I got a lot of thoughts. So, first of all, there are some aspects of dows today that are super valuable. We the kind of risk labs team. We're a global team. I don't know. We got like 30 people in 20 countries. And doing that in a traditional organization is really annoying.
00:34:42.290 - 00:35:57.046, Speaker B: Like really hard to try to employ all these people all over the world. It's just challenging and difficult. And so I think we should realize that the global nature, the fact that dows are global by default is super cool, super compelling and useful today. On the other hand, though, I think some of the Dow thinking is making the same mistake a lot of early defi stuff did, too, which is just failing to research what has already been discovered. There is a very long history and academic literature around how organizations are constructed around the principal agent problem. How do you put somebody in? How do you pick a principal that's in charge of like some power that a bunch of agents pick? There's a lot of theory here around what organizational structures work well, in what circumstances. And I think that dows should spend a lot more time kind of looking at that and being like, hey, we figured this out like a thousand years ago, that this structure works well for this and not well for like the example that I like to point to, Amazon is not run by its shareholders.
00:35:57.046 - 00:36:53.826, Speaker B: Amazon as a Dow would be insane if we asked the shareholders to vote on every decision that Jeff, or it's not Jeff anymore, but I actually forget who their CEO is. Andy, I guess if we had a Dow vote on every decision that Jeff is supposed to make, that's like completely insane. It just doesn't work. And I think DAOs sometimes make that problem. Like, if you're going to be doing complicated things, there are going to be some people that know more and have more expertise, information, knowledge, or whatever else that you do have to entrust to make some decisions. And so if you want the kind of very pure Dow that's run by the individual entities, maybe that does work better for simpler institutions or simpler organizations, like an investment club or some sort of smaller type collectives. I don't know.
00:36:54.008 - 00:37:50.030, Speaker C: Right. But it's funny. I think you're right that DeFi dows, it seems like they're kind of building everything from scratch in kind of this separate bubble and ignoring kind of what's already been done. And it looks like dows are now in these growing pains because before it used to be a lot simpler, right? Projects were smaller. Defi itself was a lot smaller. So maybe a lot of coordination just wasn't needed. But now that all these projects are becoming bigger and are needing to scale is when we're kind of running into these problems where, okay, maybe having token holders vote on every single thing is not the best method.
00:37:50.030 - 00:38:17.980, Speaker C: Maybe more formal hierarchy and organizational structure is needed. And so we are kind of slowly recreating some version of just like, how a company looks like, but on chain. So, I don't know, maybe it works out. Kind of doing everything from scratch, but using just web3 tools. We'll see how that works out.
00:38:18.430 - 00:39:08.442, Speaker B: I also don't underestimate that new infrastructures do also invent new things. I think that's true, know, because otherwise it could sound pretty pessimistic, like, okay, so we just recreate the exact same structure as traditional companies like the Delaware C Corp. We recreate that on chain and we recreate middle management and all these other layers. And everybody's like, that's not exciting. They're like, okay, first of all, I think it actually would be really useful to do that at a global level where you have a global company, and it's incredibly painful trying to actually run a global company otherwise. So maybe that is useful, that aspect of it. But that infrastructure could also allow somebody to come up with a totally new way of organizing people that hasn't been invented yet.
00:39:08.442 - 00:39:16.910, Speaker B: And often with new infrastructure and new technologies, you do invent new things, and I think that's super cool and compelling.
00:39:17.330 - 00:39:53.020, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that'll necessarily happen. If kind of all these teams are building these models from scratch using this kind of completely different infrastructure. I think kind of the outcome will have to be different from what's already been created, but I think it will kind of take some things from the old model, but I think it'll end up looking different and hopefully better, I think better. That's why we're here, right?
00:39:53.710 - 00:39:54.780, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:39:55.230 - 00:41:01.594, Speaker C: And going back to kind of the issue of multisigs and how potentially oracles can help remove that central point of failure. A big issue with multisigs have obviously been cross chain bridges. They've been super reliant on multisigs, and that's how we've seen kind of the biggest hacks in DeFi with these bridges. And it's happened so often now that it's becoming obvious that, or at least it's casting this doubt on what used to be a very common perception that, okay, the future will be this cross chain place where different blockchain ecosystems can interact. Now, because so many bridges have been hacked, that's being put into question. So, yeah, would love your thoughts on kind of how this can be improved.
00:41:01.722 - 00:41:35.420, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. And I agree, Cammy. Okay, so bridges have a bunch of problems and they break for a few reasons, but I think the oracle problem is actually the biggest one. And people don't always think of bridges as having an oracle problem, but they do usually remember when you have two blockchains, they don't talk to each other. They don't know anything about what's happening on the other blockchain. And there are ways where you can build a light client that can read another blockchain. And that's a kind of complicated engineering thing.
00:41:35.420 - 00:42:27.674, Speaker B: But a lot of approaches that a lot of bridges take is they use a service to tell blockchain a what blockchain B has done. And specifically they say, hey, if I've sent money on blockchain B destined for blockchain A, they tell blockchain a that and then send the money on blockchain A to the user. And so there's an oracle problem here where you've got to communicate a bit of data about what happened on the other chain onto the destination chain. And there are different approaches here. Some bridges are actually shockingly centralized that just basically have like a multi sig. Sometimes it's a glorified multi sig, but there are some bridges that just, you're trusting a pretty small set of people to say what happened there or not. And that can both be compromised, which can be very bad.
00:42:27.674 - 00:43:21.594, Speaker B: It's also, like risky, right? You can just lose your money and it's very dangerous. It's sort of a little side note here we came up with. There's a problem here with communicating between shards. Back when ETH two had this multi shard design. This is like way long ago before the current ethereum two design. And how are we going to communicate between shards? And one idea we came up with, and this was just at our lunch table, well before COVID was effectively using financial concepts like insurance to communicate between chains and the idea, or between shards in this case. And the idea was, well, if I know a message is worth, say, $100,000, then I can be the oracle and bridge.
00:43:21.594 - 00:43:42.420, Speaker B: This provided I bond or I insure that transaction for $100,000. Basically, like, you can trust me entirely to report it over there as long as I've posted 100 grand bond, that if I lie to you, you can get back. Does that make sense?
00:43:43.270 - 00:43:49.270, Speaker C: Yeah, in theory it does. But who posts these bonds?
00:43:50.250 - 00:44:44.518, Speaker B: You can call this like a relayer. They're charging a fee to do this. And I'll show you where I'm going with this is like we took this concept and we're basically saying, hey, we can reframe this as an insurance problem where anyone can be bridging transactions but they can only get paid back, they only get their bond back if the oracle says, if nobody says it was like a fraudulent transaction. So it's a perfect use case for our optimistic oracle here. And so where I'm getting to is we actually went ahead and implemented this. We built something, we built our own cross chain bridge, the same team behind Uma called Cross, and it uses this optimistic oracle design to bridge it's EVM compatible chains. It's Ethereum to polygon optimism, arbitrum, Boba and a few others are coming online.
00:44:44.518 - 00:45:06.430, Speaker B: But we do this at actually shockingly low cost. It's very, very efficient because of this optimistic design. And yeah, it's another use case, I think, of where Oracle designs in this optimistic design pattern can actually be a more secure and credible way to move information between chains.
00:45:08.530 - 00:45:19.678, Speaker C: That's so interesting. Okay. People can use across this oracle instead of the Polygon bridge.
00:45:19.774 - 00:45:35.430, Speaker B: Yes, we do the same services like Hop or Stargate. We support some different chains. But yeah, it's a use case of an optimistic oracle bridging your transactions.
00:45:38.030 - 00:45:45.450, Speaker C: Practically. How would you go about using this? Instead of a multi Sig based bridge.
00:45:45.870 - 00:46:01.038, Speaker B: It'S a front end consumer facing application. So you go to across two to and you bridge bridge away. It's also been integrated with some aggregators now too, which is pretty cool.
00:46:01.124 - 00:46:03.214, Speaker C: How long has this been running?
00:46:03.412 - 00:46:29.402, Speaker B: It's very recent. I mean we had a V one of this that was pretty under the radar, but version two we put out. I should really have this memorized, but about a month ago now, maybe five weeks ago. So it's a recent thing and it's been doing good volume. Yeah, sorry. So I'm not trying to turn this into a pitch for a cross, but your users should check it out. It is pretty cool and in our opinion, it solves a lot of security problems here too.
00:46:29.402 - 00:46:37.606, Speaker B: And it's a truly decentralized and truly permissionless method for bridging transactions or for bridging between chains.
00:46:37.638 - 00:46:42.620, Speaker C: That's super interesting. So how much has been bridged so far?
00:46:43.310 - 00:47:12.840, Speaker B: I should know. Again, off the top of my head I think we're over 350,000,000 total bridge volume, but I don't have the exact number off the top of my head, I don't know if we've broken 400 quite yet, but we're on our way. So real volume bridge volumes have dropped off recently in the bear market. Like the last couple of weeks have actually been pretty quiet. But people, we have this multichain world and as that grows, there's lots of volume to move.
00:47:15.290 - 00:47:18.246, Speaker C: Where are people mostly going? Like what chain?
00:47:18.358 - 00:47:59.314, Speaker B: So I think right now it's still mostly people going from Ethereum to L2s, which makes sense. They're like, L2s are growing. Arbitrum had their odyssey week, which was like big kind of draw to get people into the arbitrum platform. Optimism around their launch had lots of reasons why people bridged over there too. So most people are still moving from main net Ethereum onto these L2s. It is interesting how in the bear market, how gas fees on Ethereum layer one have dropped so much that there's less of a need to move to L2s at this particular moment. But anyone that's long term bullish on the space knows that that's not going to persist.
00:47:59.314 - 00:48:35.460, Speaker B: And these L2s are like a really important scaling solution. I think the most interesting thing that I want to track is how people move between L2s themselves. And I don't quite know what this use case is going to be like once I'm on arbitrum or on optimism, or on polygon, which isn't a L2. I know, but let's just put it in that category. When do I want to move between chains? And I'm not totally sure. We don't have enough data on that behavior yet. I'm quite interested.
00:48:35.990 - 00:48:53.960, Speaker C: Could you also use a cross for that to bridge between L2s? You're right. I don't know whether a lot of people are doing that. It's mostly kind of ethereum L2, not between L2s. I don't know.
00:48:54.650 - 00:50:05.050, Speaker B: We'll see. One hypothesis is like farms, like farmers, if there's a good farm, if they're farming on optimism and there's a good farm on arbitrum, then they want to get over there. But ignoring kind of the farming use case for the everyday user, I think it's going to be interesting to see because it's not clear which of these L2s are going to be used for what. I'm very supportive of all these scaling solutions, but it's not clear to me. Is one of them going to become like the NFT L2 and another going to be, I don't know, the gaming L2, who knows? But I do think it's important for users to be able to seamlessly move their funds between them, and nobody is going to want to have to go back to Ethereum main net and go to the other ones. So I think there's a really interesting dynamic there. And I do think that as time goes on, we will have data around these bridging flows as to be able to hypothesize with more accuracy around what is driving flows to different networks.
00:50:05.210 - 00:50:29.160, Speaker C: That'll be super interesting. And speaking of just multi chains, what about non Ethereum like non EVM chains? Are you interested in building for them or do you see kind of, is it better to just focus on kind of EVM blockchains, do you think? Kind of that's a future?
00:50:29.610 - 00:51:30.938, Speaker B: Look, I won't lie that I'm generally partial to just it's a cool community in there and I think it is kind of the birthplace of defi, but I'm not at all against other chains. I think there's lots of good stuff happening in Solana and avalanche. Avalanche is kind of, again, EVM compatible and very close to the ethereum ecosystem in some ways too. But I think there's lots of good stuff happening on Solana and the only reasons why across doesn't support it yet are purely technical and we'll solve them. So there's no axe to grind there. Yeah, and I am pretty interested again to see how these different networks continue to evolve in this sort of bear market. In the bear market, how are their personalities? How is the kind of the personality of these different networks going to change? I think it's pretty interesting, but I think all of them are here to stay.
00:51:31.104 - 00:51:47.854, Speaker C: Oh, interesting. Okay, so you do see kind of a future where there's like this EVM compatible blockchain ecosystem, but also Solana thriving and I don't know, others as well.
00:51:47.972 - 00:52:22.922, Speaker B: Yeah, why not? I think that's not a crazy view. It's really hard to predict, though. I think we've kind of got enough data right now to suggest that it's not a winner takes all market for these blockchains. There is this multi chain world, and yeah, I am partial to the EVM ecosystem, but I also think there's great stuff happening on these other chains and everybody should learn from everybody else. And it doesn't seem to be a winner takes all market, so why not?
00:52:23.056 - 00:53:17.754, Speaker A: When you shop for plane tickets, you probably use kayak, Expedia or Google flights. So why would you limit yourself to just one exchange when you trade crypto? To make sure you're getting the best possible price, you should use a Dex aggregator like Matcha Matcha routes your orders across all the various Defi exchanges on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, BSC, Phantom, Sello, and optimism. To provide the best possible prices without taking any commissions. Matcha also has integrated fiat on ramps so you can buy directly with your credit or debit card, and uses smart order routing that splits your order across multiple liquidity sources. In this final section, we talk about what's next for UMA. What are the upcoming milestones to look out for beyond UMa? We talk about the areas and projects in defi that's worth keeping an eye on in the next few months.
00:53:17.952 - 00:54:10.522, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot because we're doing a few things, I think, to zoom out for a second and kind of level set. I am of the opinion that the Oracle design space, we're just at the first inning of it, and Chainlink has built this great product. It's been really useful for a lot of early DFI innovations. I think though, the design space is big and there are lots of other designs like our optimistic Oracle and others that will continue to grow and evolve. And I think that that's actually very critical for a lot of web3 use cases. As people build more and more different or interesting or unique applications, they're going to need different types of data and they're going to need other ways of getting that data. So that's kind of like my meta thesis in terms of our roadmap for the next few months.
00:54:10.522 - 00:54:51.020, Speaker B: Uma itself, there is like an UMA 2.0 release which really improves a lot of our staking features for people that vote in our system that's on a roadmap. And we're actually getting some of that code audited next week, which is super exciting. And we're doing a lot of work in improving our developer tooling to make it a lot easier for developers to build on this oracle design. This Dao tooling brand we put together called outcome is launching this optimistic governance framework. This is sort of our version of safe Snap, which will translate or which will safely and securely pass snapshot votes through to your gnosis multisig. So I'm pretty excited about that.
00:54:51.020 - 00:55:26.930, Speaker B: And then across is doing a couple of things. Across is launching a very interesting referral program that I'm really excited about. Very interesting referral program that kind of turns across users into their own owners. You earn portions of the network by telling people about it, which I find really exciting. And there is a token launch coming up too. That's completely community done as well. So a very community centric token launch coming up later in the quarter.
00:55:27.090 - 00:55:28.600, Speaker C: What do you mean by that?
00:55:29.530 - 00:56:14.740, Speaker B: Well, we came up with this idea of a fair, fair launch back in November when we talked about this. I think we can talk about this experiment and how it's gone. The idea was we wanted to sort of say, hey, we've come up with this across code base. We think it's pretty great. We're not looking to kind of retain too much ownership of this thing. Why doesn't the community help us design the token distribution of this? So you'll have a token, but the token here is really to give ownership of the protocol back to the community. And in some ways, as we've grown, we tried to see can we work with our community to come up with a token launch plan.
00:56:14.740 - 00:56:36.940, Speaker B: And I think we were semi successful. It required some handholding and some sort of guidance from us, but we're going down that process and we're trying to really develop this token launch and this token strategy with our community in mind. It's been a fun experiment or, and learning experience there.
00:56:37.790 - 00:56:40.842, Speaker C: So this was something you did for the UMA token?
00:56:40.986 - 00:56:57.570, Speaker B: No, the UMA token was that got launched way back in 2020. Right. So this is just this whole other thing for this across token that again, it's just this whole other protocol for cross chain bridging that we think works remarkably well.
00:56:57.640 - 00:57:06.898, Speaker C: Got it. Okay. And that's being the distribution, how it's going to be distributed, that's coming from the community?
00:57:06.984 - 00:57:18.406, Speaker B: It's coming from input from the community. It's a hard thing to. How do you achieve consensus if there is no voting mechanism? There is no way of seeing how people. It's been a bit of an experiment for us.
00:57:18.508 - 00:57:21.130, Speaker C: Oh, right. Like how do you do that without the token?
00:57:21.550 - 00:58:17.260, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So it's like, how do you design a token distribution without a token to vote on the token distribution? And so you get yourself into a little twisted thinking it through. But the spirit here has been to do something that's incredibly community centric and to really build a vibrant community around this protocol. And again, it goes back to some of our questions around dows too. Like, hey, does this actually always work? I think we do need some leadership around the protocol itself, particularly in the cross chain bridge space, which is so hyper competitive. There are lots of other competitors out there. The plan around how do we launch a fair token with the across community has been pretty fun, but definitely a learning experience too.
00:58:17.710 - 00:58:22.720, Speaker C: Very cool. Okay, we'll be keeping track of that around. When is that?
00:58:23.810 - 00:58:24.686, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:58:24.788 - 00:58:25.710, Speaker C: Expected.
00:58:27.410 - 00:59:10.134, Speaker B: I don't want the team to kill me by putting out deadlines or whatever, but next couple of months Soonish, the referral program, I think we're launched, might be launching by the time this is published too, but there's a very cool referral program. And it's actually pretty interesting where we're going to run this referral program before the token exists. So it's almost like this early bonus referral program where you're going to get ownership of this thing that doesn't yet exist by referring users and by generally just promoting this bridge. So I'm pretty excited to see how that experiment works too, because I think it'll be pretty fun.
00:59:10.272 - 00:59:17.600, Speaker C: Nice. Okay. And then for Defi in general, what are you excited about in the coming months?
00:59:18.690 - 01:00:25.560, Speaker B: That's such a hard question. I do feel like we are between cycles of innovation right now, and I think, Kimmy, we were talking about this just before we started recording too, the sort of bear markets are a very fruitful time where I think a lot of really interesting ideas emerge. I'm actually pretty excited to see what ideas emerge, but I don't have a very strong thesis or very strong gut feel as to what it is now. I think this NFT stuff has really got a lot of people into the space. And I think, again, with the bear market coming, that hype cycle is going to die down some. But I feel like there's going to be really interesting innovations around NFT that I don't quite have a sense of yet, but something around NFTs and financing them like DeFi related, not just like borrowing and lending, nfts like something much more sophisticated. I think there's going to be really cool shit that emerges from there.
01:00:26.730 - 01:01:01.870, Speaker C: Nice. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think it's really hard to predict what exactly will come out of this, but just the fact the amount of people and money that's come into crypto because of NFTs, I think it's a good guess to say that it'll be something kind of NFT related, like one of the big innovations that we'll see come out of this bear market. Nice. And then to wrap up. What makes you defiant?
01:01:03.410 - 01:01:31.590, Speaker B: What makes me defiant? I think it's the fact that I want to not so secretly kind of invent a new legal system. I think that is what DeFi is doing at its core. Like I said earlier, I think it's a legal invention, not a finance one, so much. So I guess I'm defiant in the sense that I don't really like some of the trade offs of our traditional legal system. And I want to invent a new way to write contracts that works for everybody everywhere.
01:01:32.430 - 01:01:46.030, Speaker C: I love that you came back to this point, because I thought it was super interesting when you mentioned it, and then I forgot to come back to it. So can you expand on that a little bit? What do you mean that it's more legal than finance?
01:01:46.530 - 01:02:20.170, Speaker B: Well, I mean, we talked about Daos, too. Like, Daos are right now reinventing a lot of things that companies and corporations or organizational structures have already done. Defi has invented some new things, I would argue, like amms, like uniswap are a new thing that doesn't have a tradfi counterpart. But a lot of Defi is reinventing things that tradfi has already happened. Like, the finance stuff isn't really that new. What is new is how we are enforcing these financial contracts. So traditional finance is all enforced by legal.
01:02:20.170 - 01:02:48.878, Speaker B: Any. Basically any financial product and service. You rip it down, and the actual technology behind it is like a legal contract. This is very true with insurance and with derivatives. But even, like Robinhood and your stock account, you only know you have that money because there's a legal contract that says Robinhood can't go and sell your stocks for you. Right. Defi has invented an entirely new way of writing contracts.
01:02:48.878 - 01:03:23.458, Speaker B: Like entirely new that has. It's just not legal recourse. There's no legal system involved. And I think it's lost on people how freaking cool that is that we've invented a new contracting system. And it is literally like the DeFi contracts, their underlying technology that enforces them is entirely different from the legal contract that Tradfi is based off of. And these systems have trade offs. DFI is global by nature, global by default.
01:03:23.458 - 01:03:52.550, Speaker B: And it's like 14 year old kid in their basement can go and write a DFI contract. Tradfi is not global. You only have access if you're within that legal jurisdiction. And you have to have $10 million to invent a new financial product. So big differences here. And I think it's super cool that DFI has come and invented an entirely new way of writing contracts.
01:03:53.050 - 01:04:18.398, Speaker C: Totally. 100%. That's so interesting. And also like a double edged sword. Yeah, there's trade offs. Right? It's fascinating, and it just unleashes this wave of innovation and lowers barriers of entry to the financial system. And so many good things are coming out of it.
01:04:18.398 - 01:04:45.320, Speaker C: But at the same time, it's scary and maybe not very usable at this moment for institutions who do need that actual kind of undo button and have some kind of meat space legal recourse, not just like a smart contract that says, oh, liquidate this at whatever price. So I don't know, I think maybe kind of defi evolves where you can have everything.
01:04:46.970 - 01:05:37.490, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, again, software eats the world, right? I'm very confident software will eat finance. I'm very confident that DeFi will eat finance or eat traditional finance, or we will find ways where traditional finance CFI can use DeFi, let's say. I think that's all going to happen. But yeah, the trade offs are real and you've seen it in the last few months too, where again, I think that a lot of the contagion and bear market, three arrow stuff, that's not DeFi. That is very much like the tools of centralized finance that have caused that collapse. But DeFi still has a lot of usability issues. There's still lots of reasons why it's got some ways to go.
01:05:37.660 - 01:06:14.934, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a reason why it's still niche even though it's so much better. It's obviously better in many other ways. Hart, this was really fun, interesting conversation. Thank you so much for taking the time. And yeah, I'm looking forward to how oracles get implemented in all these different use cases we talked about. Seems like something that's just very useful and needed. So just super early and really interested to see how this all plays out.
01:06:14.934 - 01:06:17.480, Speaker C: So thanks for giving us the alpha here.
01:06:18.570 - 01:06:20.840, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having me. It's really great.
