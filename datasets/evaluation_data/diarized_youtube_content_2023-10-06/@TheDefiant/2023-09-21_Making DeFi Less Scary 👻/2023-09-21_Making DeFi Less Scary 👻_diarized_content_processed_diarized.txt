00:00:00.090 - 00:00:10.730, Speaker A: You were mentioning how scary it is for people to go into DeFi. What would make DeFi easier or more palatable for the mainstream?
00:00:10.810 - 00:00:21.630, Speaker B: I wouldn't say I know the answer exactly here. But for example, in this day how people perceive crypto, if it's like crazy high interest rate that will come off scary to people.
00:00:21.700 - 00:00:22.282, Speaker UNK: Scammy.
00:00:22.346 - 00:00:57.150, Speaker B: Yeah. But the one thing that could be interesting is to really simplify DeFi and help people relate. I think that's a pretty cool way. But also I think stable currencies are also on the rise. Like for example PayPal just did one like tremendous effort on that front in this climate, those kind of motions, it's going to gradually help users on board into DeFi because it would be something that they're familiar with. Oh, USD. Now I just have this other USD or this share or token that's expressed in a very different way.
00:00:57.150 - 00:00:59.100, Speaker B: Yeah, that's like some top of mind thought there.
