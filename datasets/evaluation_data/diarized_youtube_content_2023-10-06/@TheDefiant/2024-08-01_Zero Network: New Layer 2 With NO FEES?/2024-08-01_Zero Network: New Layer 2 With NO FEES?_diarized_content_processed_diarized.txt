00:00:00.320 - 00:01:01.450, Speaker A: Nine months ago, we convened with the team members of Xerian and we started strategizing, like, what can we do? What? Like the next big thing that we can do to make the user experience better. And we've always were passionate about with Xerian, we've started with the idea that it's got to be useful and easy to interact with DeFi protocols to know where your money is at. And all of that has been at the core of Xeriandem. And we realized that without us being able to influence the direction of the underlying chain, it's really hard to make any meaningful ux improvements. Because if you're just a wallet, you don't really control much of the user experience stack. You only control the signing flow and the custody flow, which is relatively little because a lot of the interactions actually happens on chain capabilities that Dapps can leverage are limited to what the chain provides them, and there is nothing that wallets can do. And it started to change with 4.37
00:01:01.450 - 00:01:38.748, Speaker A: a little bit. But for example, the gas market is universal for all the users, and the gas is still like the biggest ux blocker across the board. And it became more and more complicated with the L2 emergence. Now you have different tokens as gas and people have. You need to bridge every time you're transacting on a new layer too. So the fragmentation really became a big issue. And even though the cost went down, and that's amazing use, and I think it allowed for more applications to emerge at the same time, the fact that gas still exists for the end user, I think it's a major blocker of on chain adoption.
00:01:38.748 - 00:01:50.450, Speaker A: So we figured that and we decided that we want to solve that. And this is the origin of zero network, and hence the name. Pretty obvious, I guess.
00:01:51.910 - 00:01:58.478, Speaker B: Two questions. First, aren't you able to subsidize gas in other L2s as well?
00:01:58.654 - 00:02:38.890, Speaker A: We can, but there are some issues with that. So the first one, there is no elegant solution. We can do that because we would need to actually send money directly to their wallets to subsidize the fees. Because most of the user, I mean, account abstraction in its current form is not working. Like the 4337 did not get any traction outside of separate, singled out applications. So most of the users still use AOA wallets because that allows them to have composable experience across all of the different networks. And because of that, there is no good solution that we will be able to leverage to subsidize the fees for the users.
00:02:38.890 - 00:03:26.660, Speaker A: And second part is that this is us subsidizing the actions on networks where we don't have any, I guess, upside in some sense. So it's like the cost actually of making these transactions is now with Ethereum, blobs is very low, but what the L2s charge you is actually much, much higher. So they do take a pretty big margin, which goes directly to coinbase or to optimism. Optimism is a better example. But we have corporate networks like Op B and B. OkX is working on their own chain, so this essentially just goes directly into their pockets with us paying them for using the infrastructure. So I think that's like the second part of this equation.
00:03:26.660 - 00:03:43.500, Speaker A: I think in the future with 3074, it's going to become more and more seamless on other chains. But we wanted to start on zero and make zero actually the best user experience that we can achieve by verticalizing with the Zerian experience.
00:03:44.950 - 00:03:52.490, Speaker B: Just like a bit of a side note with the account abstraction, why do you think it hasn't taken off so much?
00:03:53.110 - 00:04:20.440, Speaker A: I think there are many reasons for that. I think two that I see, and I'm a big fan. And actually we didn't talk about that. But on Xero, every EOA is an account abstraction wallet. So that's the major upgrade in terms of fux. And this is what allows us to do free transactions actually. But speaking of 4337 as a standard, I think the issue was that it's not composable in the same way across all the L2.
00:04:20.440 - 00:04:29.648, Speaker A: So you need to deploy a contract every time you go to a new L2. Someone has to manage that. Someone needs to maintain their state across all of the different L2s.
00:04:29.744 - 00:04:33.688, Speaker B: Would this be something that the L2s themselves have to do?
00:04:33.824 - 00:04:37.690, Speaker A: No, that would be the wallet's job to maintain all of that.
00:04:38.030 - 00:04:38.990, Speaker B: Oh, okay.
00:04:39.070 - 00:05:18.632, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think there were attempts like avocado wallet and now the smart wallet by Coinbase. It's great attempts to do that, but it's like, it's a big lift on the wallet side to maintain access to, I guess the same experience as in that you get with Eoa. So EOA is very simple, it works the same way, works the same way for Dapps as well. They can deploy on any chain and they can expect that it's going to work with 4.37 fragments the experience further. And second, you need to make people migrate over and people never want to do that. So it's only targeting the new users.
00:05:18.632 - 00:06:03.646, Speaker A: But here's another problem. With 4.37, most of the account abstracted wallets were asking them to sponsor like to actually pay upfront for creating this wallet in some sense. So you would need to deposit funds first before this wallet is even deployed. So there are like challenges with the cost versus eoas are just free, you can create as many and people don't really care in the beginning about the wallet and setup, they care about the content that they want to buy, mint game that they want to play. So yeah, their first experience is, I think not the end of the story. I think the experience of like overall use and converting them into active users of web3 is more challenging.
00:06:03.646 - 00:06:09.430, Speaker A: And that's why they all stick to centralized exchanges because that's the main point why they're coming to the space.
00:06:09.590 - 00:06:25.822, Speaker B: Okay, so the reason why you're creating your own L2, I guess the main reason is to improve that Ux for users and easily abstract fees and subsidized fees for them.
00:06:26.006 - 00:07:01.494, Speaker A: Yeah, in some sense, yes. And I think that's just, I guess the first step in the, in the journey. So we would like to say that we want to make on chain experience enjoyable and rewarding. And I think, I think not many people have experimented with that to date. So all of the gas model, no one really was doing any innovation in that, in that regard to date. So all of the things like all of the networks work kind of very similarly. They just copy paste Ethereum's approach and you getting charged basically the gas fee for any kind of action.
00:07:01.494 - 00:07:43.650, Speaker A: But I think it's not directly related to the value that you're creating to the network. Some users create a lot of spam and that actually increases the cost of operating your network. Makes the whole experience for end users worse because you see a bunch of weird nfts with promotions coming to your wallet. All of that is not useful for the network, while some actions are directly benefiting the quality of the network. So I think there's a lot more innovation that we can do in that capacity while still maintaining the permissionless nature of it. So we're not removing the gas. So if you do want to transact, you're able to transact on zero, so it's fully permissionless.
00:07:43.650 - 00:08:02.010, Speaker A: While some actions will be able to subsidize which we think are benefiting the user experience and the quality of the network. And initially it's going to be us as well. And then we want to expand that further so others can do similar benefiting actions to the network. So network can grow together.
00:08:02.910 - 00:08:04.806, Speaker B: What do you mean specifically?
00:08:04.958 - 00:08:28.300, Speaker A: Yeah, so any Dapp can sponsor transactions, right? So initially for xero users, it's going to be us doing all of that job, but we don't want to limit that to just ourselves. So in the future, we want other players to be sponsoring the transactions for the end users, maintaining the continuity of user experience, but not putting all of the cost on just ourselves.
00:08:28.840 - 00:08:35.272, Speaker B: So what would be the reason for other devs to subsidize users?
00:08:35.456 - 00:09:11.816, Speaker A: Because they would be making money from other ways. And this is how, I guess, most of the web two products work. So if you look at the infrastructure, you don't pay for AWS as a user directly. You pay your subscription fee to Netflix, and Netflix does all of the infrastructure work. And I think this is how it should be. But because of the little eroded nature of crypto incentives, we got used to the fact that users are paying the infrastructure costs. Dapps are not paying pretty much anything, and they're passing all of the, and they're getting actually grants, primarily from the chains to operate.
00:09:11.816 - 00:09:50.802, Speaker A: So there is no incentive for Dapps really to build a sustainable business model. And no one is really trying to focus on the actual users. Everyone's okay with having millions of farmers just reap the rewards, distribute them, recycle something again and get a grant. So that's, I think, a bit of a dead end. So we got to get out of that somehow. So we've got the users, we'll be able to bring them via the zircon wallet to the Dapps if they can figure out how. And we'll be doing all we can to make content creators and people who deploy in Dapps benefit from that the most.
00:09:50.802 - 00:10:04.498, Speaker A: And that's the rewarding part of the zero network. So we want them to earn, but not from just, I guess, grants and stuff. So we want them to contribute to the network, bring more activity, bring more users, and yeah, get rewarded for that.
00:10:04.594 - 00:10:21.946, Speaker B: Okay. Okay. So for the serum wallet to work in this layer, two, will you require Dapps to deploy on Xero as well for those transactions to work?
00:10:22.058 - 00:10:50.486, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's a separate network. So you would need to deploy on Xero as well. We obviously don't need, we're not going to be restricting people just to zero. So if ADAP exists on another network, that's completely okay. Yeah, and we expect actually less. We don't need to build, like most chains approach that as they come in and they say, ok, here's our ecosystem, or ecosystem is coming.
00:10:50.486 - 00:11:12.292, Speaker A: The way we want to approach that is focus on why users are actually coming. So users are not coming after Dapps and that's like how we see the world happening. People don't come after OpenSeA. Opensea is a tool. They're coming after a certain NFT collection that someone told them about, or they're not going after Zora. They just happen to find the mint that someone shared with them. Similarly like the game.
00:11:12.292 - 00:11:55.498, Speaker A: So there are certain, and I think that distinction matters. And most of the chains just try to focus on the Dapps versus we want to focus on the end creators of unique experiences, unique content. And we want to make sure that Zirian helps these users actually get the rewards. And we're going to be building the whole, I guess, how do I explain that? And obviously, a lot of that is a work in progress. We have the direction, but we want to direct all of the users that are on ZR into mint stuff that is happening on Xero network. So more and more users would come in and more rewards that can be generated by the creators.
00:11:55.594 - 00:12:10.690, Speaker B: Okay. But like, for example, if the action your user wants to do is by a meme coin or something, will you need to have a Dex launch on Zero to do that?
00:12:10.770 - 00:12:44.846, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. We definitely will need to have the Dapps and we believe that just going to happen. So every time there is a new layer too, I mean, we already have a lot of people coming to us and saying we want to deploy. We want to be first XYZ on Zero, and that's great. So we obviously want to support as many of them and, yeah, that's just, I kind of feel that this is the steps that happen with every L2. So, yeah, people come like DApps are able to deploy, smaller teams are able to fork a lot of the stuff and just deploy as well, to be the first.
00:12:44.846 - 00:12:57.472, Speaker A: So we believe that the Dapp ecosystem is going to happen. Yeah. The important bit is what is going to be traded on these Dex is what's going to be like the NFTs that you want to have. So that's a crucial bit.
00:12:57.576 - 00:12:58.408, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure.
00:12:58.504 - 00:13:10.752, Speaker A: And that makes actually dapps more useful as well. So if you are the first Dapp and everyone is deploying first Dex and everyone is creating new meme coins on your decks now, so you're getting more trading volumes. This is how you actually earn as a Dapp.
00:13:10.856 - 00:13:25.302, Speaker B: What do you think about just like the potential friction that having a just another layer added to the user experience?
00:13:25.446 - 00:13:55.846, Speaker A: I think at this point there is no additional friction. So there are so many L2s. It's already a very fragmented experience. We care about all users and I think it's a similar question to when we were launching a wallet. People were asking, there's so many wallets, why do you need another one? And I think with L2 it's the same. Obviously there are million L2s that are not going to make it. We wouldn't be honest here, but for us we believe that this is a long term project.
00:13:55.846 - 00:14:19.020, Speaker A: It's not like it's an important part of the journey. It's an important part of verticalizing the user experience and creating better, actually being able to create a better experience and. Yeah, and that's why we're, that's all I can say. We just think that people are going to love using it. We're going to be onboarding users that and over time it's going to show the rewards.
00:14:19.140 - 00:14:26.316, Speaker B: Okay, what stage of the launch are you in? I think you're in testnet still. Like when's Mainnet?
00:14:26.468 - 00:14:29.200, Speaker A: Yeah, and when token, right?
00:14:29.580 - 00:14:31.080, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the next question.
00:14:32.100 - 00:14:54.862, Speaker A: So the testnet is already live. We have over 250,000 transactions. People are starting to do something there. We're not, I guess, incentivizing or anything. So this is mainly for the infrastructure partners that we have to start deploying stuff and testing out the flows. It's still missing a few components that are new to that. We want to add before Mainnet.
00:14:54.862 - 00:15:02.734, Speaker A: So mainnet is currently planned for early fall. Let's say that. Okay, I don't want to be too specific.
00:15:02.822 - 00:15:10.682, Speaker B: Okay, sure. And you mentioned you're not incentivizing users. Are you planning to at some point?
00:15:10.826 - 00:15:20.458, Speaker A: Yeah, we're planning to. As we launch the L2, we plan to have more, let's just say loyalty campaign.
00:15:20.594 - 00:15:22.390, Speaker B: Okay. No points.
00:15:22.850 - 00:15:42.666, Speaker A: It's more focused with a focus on the rewards that you're getting along the way. So points are usually used as a mechanic to distribute airdrop. That's the only goal of it. We want to approach that slightly differently, but yeah, we'll, I guess have more, more data about that later as we launched.
00:15:42.698 - 00:15:49.750, Speaker B: Interesting. And then obviously that should lead to an airdrop at some point, right?
00:15:50.450 - 00:15:52.670, Speaker A: Not commenting on tokens. Okay.
00:15:56.170 - 00:16:06.916, Speaker B: Come on. All right, I'll let you off the hook. What are some of the dubs that you already have lined up that will be kind of the first to launch?
00:16:07.058 - 00:16:39.300, Speaker A: Yeah, so we have a few. So we have Dodo and the one inch basically Dex infrastructure and that we've been mainly working on RPC providers like Oracles and things like this, like basically infrastructure that enables other people to deploy. We've got questing campaigns like Galaxy layer three as well. And there's, like, on the NFT side, we're working. It's not confirmed yet, but we're working on a few minting platforms, yeah.
