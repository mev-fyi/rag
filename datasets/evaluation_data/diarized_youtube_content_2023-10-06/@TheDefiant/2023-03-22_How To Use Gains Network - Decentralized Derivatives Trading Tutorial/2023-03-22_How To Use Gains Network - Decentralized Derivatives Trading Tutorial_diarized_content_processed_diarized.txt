00:00:00.250 - 00:00:02.606, Speaker A: Welcome back to the Defiant explains our.
00:00:02.628 - 00:00:50.102, Speaker B: Comprehensive tutorial videos, which dive deep into defi projects and show you how to navigate them with a step by step guide. Today's video was sponsored by Gains Network, but it was researched and created in house by the defiant team while adhering to our standards of objectivity. Today we're kicking things off with an exciting but risky perpetual futures example. We'll then explore the gains network before doing an actual will walk through and placing some trades. So stick around for some useful tips and tricks on how to generate returns, which you can start using right away. So what is Gains network? The FTX crash left a massive void in the derivatives trading market, with many retailers searching for a trustworthy platform that's not based on fraudulent schemes. Fortunately, the answer may lie in decentralized networks that prioritize self custody.
00:00:50.102 - 00:01:06.446, Speaker B: And one such platform is the gains network. And before we jump into the platform itself, we should know how exactly the derivatives market can be beneficial to us as traders. So why would I want to trade derivatives in the first place? Well, economies are generally driven by production.
00:01:06.478 - 00:01:08.354, Speaker A: And trade, but both are layered with.
00:01:08.392 - 00:01:40.182, Speaker B: Heavy doses of speculation. And broadly speaking, the higher the risk, the higher the potential returns. Among the more popular speculative instruments is perpetual futures. These are contracts that allow traders to speculate on price movements of an underlying asset, but without owning the asset itself. So perpetual futures are a type of derivative, and they're among the highest risk instruments available. They're typically used by experienced traders and professionals. But naturally, retail investors with a higher risk tolerance are also known to dabble in derivatives.
00:01:40.182 - 00:02:29.750, Speaker B: So now that we're armed with the knowledge of what a derivative is, let's figure out what exactly perpetual futures are. Perpetual futures are settled in cash instead of delivering the underlying asset. That means the trades don't result in delivery of assets upon contract maturity, traders can simply roll over their contracts with cash or stablecoins. And finally, where does the perpetual come into play? Whether you bet on the price movement to go up or down, these futures contracts have no expiry date. This means that you can hold your position as long as you're able to maintain the required margin and rollover fees. Although a word of caution, as much as the perpetual element of these derivatives offer flexibility, the fees associated with holding the position open for a prolonged period often makes this a suboptimal strategy.
00:02:29.830 - 00:02:31.318, Speaker A: So now that we've cleared up the.
00:02:31.344 - 00:02:44.334, Speaker B: Basics on perpetual futures, the most important question is which trading platform to pick. In the wake of the failure of the crypto exchange FTX last year, investors lost confidence in centralized platforms.
00:02:44.462 - 00:02:46.738, Speaker A: Instead, as I mentioned earlier, people are.
00:02:46.744 - 00:03:25.482, Speaker B: Now seeking decentralized protocols, which allow trustless access to users who have their own selfcustodial wallets. In the last year, gains Network's user count has surged from 800 to a whopping 10,000 traders. The trading platform is available on Ethereum's top scaling networks, Arbitrum and Polygon, with negligible gas fees. Arbitrum, as many of you will already know, is steadily becoming Ethereum's scalability solution of choice for veteran traders. And thanks to these drivers, Gtrade has already settled over 700,000 trades. But how exactly does a decentralized protocol handle derivatives trading? And wouldn't you need a centralized exchange.
00:03:25.546 - 00:03:27.610, Speaker A: With deep liquidity like finance?
00:03:27.690 - 00:04:24.750, Speaker B: Well, the gains network does have a trick up its sleeve that makes even 1000 times leverage possible not only for crypto tokens, but also for certain stocks, commodities, indices and even forex pairs. The demand for either asset class shifts, but is still mainly crypto centered, as shown in this chart here. As with any decentralized application or DAP, you can access G trade with a self custodial wallet such as metamask, and you can do so without having to sign up. But before we get into opening your first perpetual futures trade, let's figure out how exactly G trade maintains liquidity. First, you should keep in mind that leverage trading is a high risk, potentially high reward venture. Case in point, if we take a look at Gtrade's profit versus loss statistics, we'll see that the PNL of closed positions is cumulatively in the negative range, at nearly $7 million. And just like a traditional exchange, gtrade is built with an assumption that most traders lose money on average.
00:04:24.750 - 00:05:15.838, Speaker B: In turn, the losers fill the protocol's liquidity coffers, specifically by depositing DAI stablecoin as collateral for investment positions. This is G trade's first line of defense against liquidation, when margin called. But what happens when traders have positive p L in excess of their collateral? This is when the second line of defense kicks in an overcollateralized layer in the form of a $5 million liquidity pool owned by the protocol itself. Lastly, Gtrade has a third line of liquidation defense called the GDI vault. In this liquidity pool, anyone can deposit DAI stablecoins as counterparty balance. In exchange, they receive a cut of the trading fees incentivized by these yields. Liquidity providers bolster the protocol's liquidity trading fees organically incentivize liquidity providers as their yield fluctuates based on trading demand.
00:05:15.838 - 00:06:06.106, Speaker B: Currently, the vault pays 20% annual percentage yield, or APY, while holding over $30 million worth of die stablecoins. And if we take into account polygon and arbitram, that figure is at $45 million. And although in the double digit range, the APY comes from trading fees, gains network also has its own GNS token that allows users to earn a share of protocol revenue. Whenever you deposit die in the vault, you will receive a liquid GDI ERC 20 token, which represents your ownership of the stake. Okay, so there are nice returns to be generated, and the next logical question is, how does one go about withdrawing? The withdrawal system consists of epochs. Within the first two days of each epoch, you can withdraw your funds. However, there is a time lock between the withdrawal request and execution.
00:06:06.106 - 00:06:22.310, Speaker B: Now, this time lock delay is dependent on the collateralization ratio of the vault itself, and you can see these figures on screen right now. For instance, if the vault is 120% or more collateralized, there is a one epoch timelock of three days.
00:06:22.460 - 00:06:24.086, Speaker C: You can see the rest on screen.
00:06:24.188 - 00:06:31.618, Speaker B: The purpose of the timelock is to cover for leveraged trades with high risk, high reward in mind. Let's get started on your first G.
00:06:31.644 - 00:07:14.470, Speaker A: Trade gains network has two types of access, so let me explain them both quickly before diving in and using them. The regular access method lets you connect a wallet and select the network, either arbitrum or polygon. And if, for example, you have metamask, the wallet would automatically pick the network settings. The second access type enables gtrade's very own one click trading, or onect wallet. Now, this is a super convenient function which allows traders to create a proxy wallet to cover the gas fees. So the idea is that traders no longer have to approve trades on metamask, allowing them to trade seamlessly, as if they were on a centralized exchange. Oneclick trading actually uses two mechanisms to provide the convenience that I just mentioned.
00:07:14.470 - 00:07:50.370, Speaker A: You have the onect wallet, and secondly, you have trade delegation. So let's start with the one CT wallet. Just like metamask, the gtrade website encrypts and stores key material, meaning onect is a self custodial wallet, and you can hold your private keys if you choose to export them. Now, the most convenient way to fund a wallet would be to connect an externally owned account, or EOA, to submit transactions. And essentially this means you're granting the onect wallet permission to trade funds on your behalf. Second, we have trade delegation. This feature allows you to delegate trading to another externally owned account.
00:07:50.370 - 00:08:17.158, Speaker A: The beautiful part of this feature is that you only need to have enough funds to cover gas in your delegation wallet, as the collateral and PNL are actually tied to the trader address. So your one CT wallet comes into play as a delegation wallet. And as the name suggests, it's a type of wallet that allows you to delegate crypto funds to a third party for trading purposes. And in this case, that's the gains network. Given that your onect wallet is tied to your original wallet address, which holds.
00:08:17.174 - 00:08:18.886, Speaker B: Your collateral and your profit and loss.
00:08:18.918 - 00:08:49.154, Speaker A: Balance, the onect wallet only needs gas funds for submitting transactions. This way, you can engage in a more seamless trading experience while still maintaining full control over your funds. So let's go to gains trade trading to get started. And as soon as we scroll down, we notice that what they're really all about here is optimizing the trading experience. They're talking about making it faster and cheaper. And there's also a mention of mitigating some of the risks associated with leverage trading. And that's something we'll get back to.
00:08:49.192 - 00:08:51.362, Speaker C: Right after we start placing some trades.
00:08:51.426 - 00:09:01.242, Speaker A: So I'll scroll back up and I'll click on the start trading button. And the next step is, of course, to connect your metamask wallet. So the Dex conveniently tells me that I'm on the wrong network, and we can go ahead and click that button.
00:09:01.296 - 00:09:03.366, Speaker C: And change over to the arbitrum network.
00:09:03.478 - 00:09:43.142, Speaker A: To make sure we're in the right place. I approve this transaction through Metamask. Now, from here, I'm going to go straight into the one click trading option, because I don't really want to be dealing with multiple metamask popups for every single trade. So if I activate the oneclick trading wallet, it prompts me to create a pin. So I've entered my pin, I'm signing the transaction on metamask to essentially acknowledge that this is indeed my pin code. Next, I have to approve the onect wallet and give it the authority to submit transactions without me having to manually accept each transaction inside metamask. And for this, I have to pay a tiny amount of gas to complete.
00:09:43.142 - 00:10:01.338, Speaker A: And we're ready to fund our one click trading wallet already. And we really don't need much gas on arbitrum. It's very cheap because it's a L2 network, and the one CT wallet only really needs these funds for gas. So I'll go ahead and put something like $25 worth, which is a very, very small amount in ETH, and we get the confirmation message from Metamask, and.
00:10:01.344 - 00:10:02.822, Speaker C: We'Re ready to start trading.
00:10:02.886 - 00:10:40.598, Speaker A: So, with wallet funding out of the way, how do you actually open your first G trade position? The first thing you'll notice is that G trade has all these options available at a glance, and the major one being that you're betting on a token appreciation. So long. Or you're betting on the token depreciating in value or short. For example, let's take Cardano as the perpetual futures target. The Cardano blockchain's native currency is AdA, and the token trading pair will be AdA USD, which you can manually search for by typing in the first few letters over in this top hand corner. I've already done so, and I'll select it so it's there and it's ready to go. Now, once we've selected the trading pair, we have to also decide on the trading position.
00:10:40.598 - 00:11:13.662, Speaker A: Are we going long or are we shorting it? After that, we can select the leverage amount. Now, leverage options do range from two x all the way to 150 x. And today we're trading on arbitram. The minimum position size on arbitram is 7500 die, which is calculated by your collateral times the leverage that you choose to use. So if I use 50 die as collateral, I'll need 150 x leverage to get there. Or I can open a position with 150 die as collateral and use only 50 x leverage. And both of these options will get me to the 7500 die threshold.
00:11:13.662 - 00:11:16.226, Speaker A: With position, type and size set, you.
00:11:16.248 - 00:11:19.070, Speaker C: Have three conditions under which the position is closed.
00:11:19.150 - 00:11:20.870, Speaker A: First, we can set a limit order.
00:11:20.940 - 00:11:22.646, Speaker C: Which will set the specific price at.
00:11:22.668 - 00:11:47.818, Speaker A: Which to buy or sell adder. For example, if you believe adder will go up to $0.5 and you want to buy it, you would set that limit. Second, we have a stop loss which automatically sells adder when it reaches a specific price point in order to limit losses. For example, if you bought adder at $0.35, but you set a stop loss order at $0.30, your adder will be auto sold when its price drops under $0.30.
00:11:47.818 - 00:12:06.590, Speaker A: Then we have the take profit order, which automatically sells cardano when it reaches the price point that we've set. So, for the sake of today's video, let's assume that I think Cardano needs to cool off a bit and find some new support. So I'm going to short it. I click on short on the top right hand corner of the screen and I'll select 50 x leverage for demo purposes.
00:12:06.670 - 00:12:07.778, Speaker C: And that means to get to the.
00:12:07.784 - 00:12:37.562, Speaker A: Threshold, we need of 7500 die. We need 150 die as collateral. I manually enter both of these numbers and once I've done so, I'll indicate a stop loss of around 25% to avoid getting liquidated in the event of a rapid price increase. So my stop loss is now at 0.36. My take profit is at 100% or 0.35 if I want to take profit at 100%. Basically what that means is I'll walk away with 150 die in profit.
00:12:37.562 - 00:14:02.714, Speaker A: Assuming that my price target is hit, my position is placed, and I can see where I entered the position. I can see my take profit and I can see my liquid 8th position as well, all on the screen. Now, the convenient layout which displays all of the key information in one place is worth noting here. And it means that I don't have to keep interacting with metamask pop ups like some of the other Dexs. But beyond that, the charting here, which is powered by trading view, also allows me to actually see all the tools and technical analysis all in the same place.
00:14:02.832 - 00:14:04.602, Speaker B: So we've placed a limit order going.
00:14:04.656 - 00:14:10.714, Speaker C: Short and let's now try to go long using a market order to see just how quickly gains network will execute that.
00:14:10.752 - 00:14:12.874, Speaker A: As I mentioned earlier, gains network will.
00:14:12.912 - 00:14:14.810, Speaker C: Allow me to open positions on cryptos.
00:14:14.890 - 00:14:17.722, Speaker B: Stocks, forex and even commodities like gold.
00:14:17.786 - 00:14:18.526, Speaker C: So I'm going to go ahead and.
00:14:18.548 - 00:14:20.922, Speaker B: Try that out going long on spy.
00:14:21.066 - 00:15:03.054, Speaker C: So I've clicked on pairs and I've typed in spy and it's giving me this position and I'm going to select 350 die as my collateral this time my leverage is going to be 35 x because I have to get to the 12,000 die threshold to actually open the position. This is a high risk position, so I'm going to have a tight stop loss. I will manually enter it, let's say 395396, and my take profit is indicated at 25%. So I stand to walk away with 87 and a half die in profits. And if I lose, I lose 33 die. You also have to factor in the 6.1 die in trading fees for this position as well.
00:15:03.054 - 00:15:17.698, Speaker C: So the parameters are set. My stop loss is there, my liquidation price is displayed on screen, and I'm going to click the market long. The order is initiated and almost instantaneously the position is open.
00:15:17.784 - 00:15:19.422, Speaker A: Now, once again, I have the convenience.
00:15:19.486 - 00:15:21.346, Speaker C: Of seeing all the most relevant information.
00:15:21.448 - 00:15:23.506, Speaker B: Right here at the bottom corner of my screen.
00:15:23.608 - 00:15:29.366, Speaker C: Or I can also refer to the price chart for the key information as well. And once I'm in this position, I.
00:15:29.388 - 00:15:32.406, Speaker A: Can exit it with ease by just clicking on the graph, or if I.
00:15:32.428 - 00:15:59.438, Speaker C: Choose to, I can also close it manually myself. So let's assume the position, or the trade rather, is going against me. I can click right there and the transaction is closed that quickly. So for our final trade, I'm going to short an entirely different asset class and we're going to go for stocks this time. I'm going to type in Tesla over here in the top left corner. There we have it.
00:15:59.524 - 00:16:01.786, Speaker A: So the idea here is to simulate.
00:16:01.818 - 00:16:28.086, Speaker C: A scalping situation where, for example, the RSI might be in the overbought territory and I want to quickly get in and out of a trade. So let me go to a different time frame and let's also add an indicator. Once my parameters are selected, all I have to do is press the market short button right here. And just like that, it should open the second trade going short. There we go. Almost instantly I'm in the position and.
00:16:28.108 - 00:16:29.398, Speaker A: I can see all the key information.
00:16:29.484 - 00:16:43.946, Speaker C: Here on the bottom right corner, or as I mentioned on the trading screen itself. Now it seems that the trade is going against us. So assume that the scalp isn't working for me and I want to exit the position as quickly as possible. I have the option of closing it.
00:16:43.968 - 00:16:45.806, Speaker A: Right here or closing it on the.
00:16:45.828 - 00:17:00.210, Speaker C: Trading screen as well. So the trade's gone against me. My scalp hasn't worked, and for the purpose of demo, I'll close this position as well. I click the close button, I wait for about a second and my position is closed. My stop loss wasn't triggered.
00:17:00.790 - 00:17:02.210, Speaker A: So there we have it.
00:17:02.280 - 00:18:01.880, Speaker B: Gtrade is a liquidity efficient DFi trading platform which allows me to use leverage with low fees and without the hassle of a million metamask popups. I can actually trade with leverage up to 150 x on crypto, 50 x on stocks, 35 x on indices, and a whopping 1000 x on forex. And how does gains network know the accurate price of any given token? We're going to start with an analogy borrowed from ancient greek mythology, where an oracle was an intermediary between humans and the gods. Applying this to the crypto space, oracle networks are intermediary systems that feed off chain data to on chain smart contracts. This is how dapps gain their capacity to execute the logic based on real world data. Typically, this real world data is the price of cryptocurrencies. The most popular such Oracle network is Chainlink, or link, which uses a decentralized verification system to make sure the data's correct.
00:18:01.880 - 00:18:55.922, Speaker B: In contrast, gains network uses its own customized chainlink, Oracle, to guarantee price accuracy. Now Gains was initially launched on the polygon blockchain, but we really saw the impressive uptick that we did in user count around December and into the new year when gains deployed on arbitrum, which, as we know, is a L2 scaling solution for Ethereum, which proved to be the catalyst for Gains's recent growth. Isan Baidani, a gains contributor, said that the protocol's Oracle network also played a significant role in the recent momentum. The project uses customized Chainlink oracles, which provide pricing data for on and off chain assets, and you might be wondering, why is price accuracy important? Well, when traders rely on rapid decision making to ensure gains or to avoid losses, they've got to be confident that the oracle feeding is flawless. But sometimes we get what's called a scam wick.
00:18:55.986 - 00:18:57.238, Speaker A: Now, wicks are there to show the.
00:18:57.244 - 00:19:04.426, Speaker B: Range of price in a particular time period. But a scam wick happens when a cryptocurrency's price is manipulated to create the.
00:19:04.448 - 00:19:05.830, Speaker A: Illusion of market activity.
00:19:05.910 - 00:19:35.966, Speaker B: You'll typically see this when whales place large volume orders that are drastically above or below the asset's current market price. Consequently, this manifests as a scam wick to trigger stop losses or artificially drive up the price, enabling the whale to sell at this higher price. Gtrade's customized Chainlink oracle is specifically tuned to filter scam wicks to prevent that form of market manipulation. So to wrap it all up, the gains network has built a resilient DeFi product with a wide variety of trading.
00:19:35.998 - 00:19:37.894, Speaker A: Pairs, and they've made it easy to.
00:19:37.932 - 00:20:11.660, Speaker B: Use for practically anyone trading the price of crypto, forex stocks, and even commodities. The most convenient aspect of what we've discovered today is likely the oneclick trading wallet, which allows users to create a proxy wallet with gas so you don't have to keep approving transactions through the metamask wallet over and over again. In that sense, using Gtrade emulates the experience of trading on a centralized exchange. I hope this video has informed you enough about the gains network, but of course, do let me know in the comments if you have any specific features you'd like me to explore further, and we'll see you in the next video.
