00:00:00.330 - 00:00:28.066, Speaker A: Hello and welcome to a very special edition of Defiant Weekly. Now listen, we make a ton of videos. We make five a week now. And mixed into all of these videos, they're these little nuggets of creativity that I guess define who we are as a channel. We always put that extra special effort into making something memorable. Now if you've watched our videos, you probably wouldn't go back in time and look at some of the ones we made last year, for instance, to pick out those little nuggets of creativity. So what we've done instead is delivered the first defiant mixtape.
00:00:28.066 - 00:00:56.766, Speaker A: We've assembled the best bits from all the videos that we've ever made into over an hour's worth of special content with just those fun bits. This is the Defiant's first mixtape. I hope you enjoy. If you've seen our recent videos, you'll know that food tends to feature heavily, often heading towards my face at speed. Well, we are not going to do that. This. Dude, what was that? Did you hear that? Yeah, what was.
00:00:56.766 - 00:01:06.594, Speaker A: Now I'm being serious. I'm being serious. There's actually some. There's someone here. I'm serious. There's something out there. Just go.
00:01:06.594 - 00:01:07.198, Speaker A: Grab the camera.
00:01:07.214 - 00:01:15.230, Speaker B: Go, go. Did you see that?
00:01:15.320 - 00:01:15.910, Speaker C: Yes.
00:01:16.060 - 00:01:29.640, Speaker B: What the was? It's fine.
00:01:42.210 - 00:01:43.230, Speaker A: Liquidated.
00:01:45.010 - 00:01:46.030, Speaker B: Aha.
00:02:01.110 - 00:02:18.230, Speaker A: Time for a truth bomb. This is a pair of pants. My pants. In fact, when you do something, it's lost, right? But what if it isn't? What if it's impermanent?
00:02:25.290 - 00:02:26.790, Speaker C: I'm hungry.
00:05:11.900 - 00:05:46.512, Speaker A: And we start with Balancer, who are up to some pretty funky stuff. To help you ease the pain of high gas costs on Ethereum, trade as much as you like and recoup most of the gas costs. Damn straight. And in their new ball for gas campaign, traders are receiving six figures worth of ball tokens every week. And with version two just around the corner, balancer is becoming a one stop shop for DFI liquidity. Version two brings stable pools and weighted pools tightly integrated under a single protocol with flash loans, lending via asset managers, and much, much more. Check it out at balancer finance.
00:05:46.512 - 00:06:31.440, Speaker A: Now we move to Ava, which I keep calling Ava, but it's Ava. Fun fact. The name is actually taken from the finnish word for ghost, and it's a decentralized, open source and non custodial liquidity protocol. On Ethereum, depositors earn interest by providing liquidity to lending pools, while borrowers can obtain loans by tapping into these pools with variable and stable interest rate options, deposit into AvA protocol and receive a tokens which accrue interest every second right in your wallet. Seriously, you can actually watch your balance going up every single second. Swap any of your deposited assets at any time to get the best yields on the market for the developers out there. Ava features access to defi building blocks like flash loans and credit delegation.
00:06:31.440 - 00:07:22.552, Speaker A: AvA protocol liquidity pools are now available on ethereum and Sidechain Polygon. Do you remember your first defi transaction? After juggling five or more tabs on your browser, you gazed at that ether scan confirmation feeling like you just contributed to the future of finance. Except you kind of just got a little bit lost in a world of gas prices, vaults, pools, hard forks, degenerates and sushi chefs and all that malarkey. Fortunately, Xerion has built the dream tool for managing your portfolio. Track all of your token balances across wallets and chains. Access every kind of defi asset, including indexes, pools and yield strategies, and trade at the cheapest rates with no extra fees. And that is because Xerion sources liquidity from every single decentralized exchange like Uniswap, zerox and oneinch.
00:07:22.552 - 00:07:56.350, Speaker A: No sign up required, no fees, and a blissfully easy UI. Simply connect your wallet at app, Xerion IO and that does it for the sponsors. Myself and the defiant team decided it was time to put the jokes to one side, get serious and focus on an aspect of defi that nobody is talking about. Dictionary attacks. There are many words in the dictionary. I particularly like the word neologism. Boring authentication, wonder what else is on.
00:08:03.460 - 00:08:22.100, Speaker D: When I was a seedling, I used to dream of all the places I would go and of all the things I could be. But everywhere I looked, the life I imagined was just a cruel, sick joke.
00:08:29.820 - 00:08:34.436, Speaker E: Why don't you tell me what's on your mind? Any degenerate thoughts?
00:08:34.628 - 00:08:48.000, Speaker D: You don't get it, do you? All I have are degenerate thoughts. For my whole life I didn't know if I even really existed.
00:08:48.740 - 00:08:53.040, Speaker C: But I do, and people are starting to notice.
00:08:54.580 - 00:08:56.050, Speaker D: I give into it.
00:08:56.740 - 00:09:06.950, Speaker C: I embrace it like a brother. You think this is funny? This is a joke to you?
00:09:10.520 - 00:09:15.960, Speaker D: You can call me degenerator.
00:09:30.480 - 00:09:35.048, Speaker F: Of course I did. But you ain't got no effing hard in my frog crew.
00:09:35.144 - 00:09:35.356, Speaker A: What?
00:09:35.378 - 00:09:39.132, Speaker F: You're gonna Getty Yaskivi and you could get something date.
00:09:39.266 - 00:09:41.028, Speaker C: Or maybe you get macaque.
00:09:41.144 - 00:09:56.992, Speaker F: That's the buz in it. Then you get twitted up and ape. Then be like, mom's got a freaking alien, bro before you go and give a new banging Dubai button like a baboon abe then grinding you grill like watch again. What you get. What you get. What you get. The money.
00:09:56.992 - 00:09:58.000, Speaker F: Don't burn.
00:09:58.340 - 00:09:59.760, Speaker B: A pride.
00:10:26.580 - 00:10:31.964, Speaker C: Memo dangerous made another Sam.

00:11:16.500 - 00:11:17.356, Speaker F: Isn'T frathead.
00:11:17.388 - 00:11:18.396, Speaker C: And not role models.
00:11:18.428 - 00:11:20.860, Speaker A: They're not even human. They're cartoons.
00:11:20.940 - 00:11:22.224, Speaker C: Some of the things they do would.
00:11:22.262 - 00:11:49.780, Speaker A: Cause a person to get hurt, arrested, probably wrecked. To put it another way, don't put any money in you're not prepared to lose. Bro, this buy my token. It's on Bitcloud.
00:11:49.860 - 00:11:50.920, Speaker C: Bit munch.
00:11:51.500 - 00:11:52.804, Speaker A: Why would I buy your token?
00:11:52.852 - 00:12:00.964, Speaker C: There's all these hot chicks. Yeah, chicks. Hot chicks. Who wants to buy your token, butt monkey?
00:12:01.092 - 00:12:04.430, Speaker A: Shut up, Brovis. I just bought all your token. Now I'm going to dump it.
00:12:06.500 - 00:12:06.864, Speaker B: No.
00:12:06.902 - 00:12:09.170, Speaker C: I bought all your token. Now I'm going to dump it.
00:12:13.220 - 00:12:14.640, Speaker A: Eurovasp.
00:12:15.460 - 00:12:16.800, Speaker D: Eurovasp.
00:12:17.460 - 00:13:46.648, Speaker A: Eurovasp. You're a fast. See, the origin of all these attacks was a flash loan allowing the attacker to borrow huge collateral at zero risk, temporarily granting them the heft of a whale and the power to drain protocols in a matter of minutes using reentrancy vulnerabilities. And we're not talking peanuts here. $45 million in the last month alone. Digital art. It's divisive, it's provocative and now it's highly profitable.
00:13:46.648 - 00:14:22.456, Speaker A: But can there really be art hiding behind something as meaningless as a simple QR code? Or is it a cruel experiment designed to teach us the meaning of greed? There's a party in our pants and everybody's invited. Senoris is the difference between the face value of money, such as a $10 bill or a quarter coin, and the cost to produce it. In other words, the economic cost of producing a currency within a given economy or country is lower than the actual exchange value which generally accused to governments who mint the money.
00:14:22.638 - 00:14:23.560, Speaker B: Got it?
00:14:23.710 - 00:14:56.148, Speaker A: Good. Now on with the show. What could I possibly add? A few jokes, some slapstick? A fish to the face? Goddamn right. Sexy af. Or are they just a load of pants? This is the defiant creeping in at every opportunity. Journalists just can't seem to help themselves, knowingly referencing it whenever discussing non fungies. It's wild success.
00:14:56.148 - 00:15:24.824, Speaker A: Seemingly yet another example of crypto's dumb, irrational exuberance. Because that's all there is to NFTs. You just can't escape them, no matter how hard you try. But. And stick with me now as we lollop gaily through some verbal gymnastics. If you take the word non fungible, strip off the back end and bring what's left to the proximal of your labial cleft then you're left with non. And in French, that's non no, which means no as in no, we won't be lazy.
00:15:24.824 - 00:15:32.272, Speaker A: And no, we won't default to comparing everything to. God damn it, where are they coming from?
00:15:32.326 - 00:15:35.600, Speaker E: I think you might want to pick a more masculine note.
00:15:35.940 - 00:15:43.330, Speaker A: No. It's time we took ourselves far, far away. Get ready for NFT 3.0.
00:16:03.820 - 00:16:12.776, Speaker C: Take one step into crypto and it can feel like you're throwing your life to the gods of thunder. I'm here, you say, take me, throw.
00:16:12.808 - 00:16:13.980, Speaker B: Me into the void.
00:16:19.620 - 00:16:45.370, Speaker C: And ape that you are, you keep on walking towards that edge, you cry and over you go. But what if there was another way? What if you could have your cake and eat it?
00:16:45.980 - 00:17:20.528, Speaker A: We're talking tranches, structures and downside protection. This is the defiant. We genuinely thought we'd hit peak bananas a few weeks ago with the curve launch. But if you thought farmers had already gotten fat enough stuffing their faces full of yams, sushi and now kimchi. That's not kimchi. We managed to hit even greater heights of food, Follywood. If you throw that at me, I swear I'll shove it in your.
00:17:20.528 - 00:17:33.716, Speaker A: Thank you with this. So this is the end of the tale. When happens. When protocols fail to protect retail whales, when hackers derail and prevail. Your goods for that on scale. And I don't want to disser intellect, but I do think it's time we all reflect that again. The Mr.
00:17:33.716 - 00:17:43.320, Speaker A: X psychitex who neglect to get co checked and collect fortune for projects from subjects who like the selective ability to check the predilection to take the wrong direction, chasing their directions, fall on their knees to respect gene, affect their anonymous directors.
00:17:44.140 - 00:17:47.016, Speaker B: Well, that is the fastest way I.
00:17:47.038 - 00:17:50.120, Speaker C: Know to get wrecked.
00:17:50.460 - 00:17:55.770, Speaker B: So it was at this time. You got lucky this time.
00:18:21.660 - 00:18:28.600, Speaker A: And if the source of information upon which you are reliant turns out not to be trustworthy, remember defiance.
00:18:29.180 - 00:18:31.844, Speaker B: Hey, let me ask you a question. Like rugs.
00:18:31.892 - 00:18:32.996, Speaker C: I got loads of rugs.
00:18:33.028 - 00:18:44.830, Speaker B: I got rugs for all different occasions. You load them up and then you've got to pull people out the way like this. Bull. Bull. You know what I'm talking about. Hey, Mark, get over here. Let's demonstrate for the people how we do this.
00:18:44.830 - 00:18:55.964, Speaker B: Now he's standing on here. Now, guys, you got to make sure. Load up the rugs. With a lot of people. There are not a lot of people. No point pulling the rugs. Got to be heavy.
00:18:55.964 - 00:19:05.284, Speaker B: Load up. Like the whales say. Heavy load up, heavy fall down. So, mom going to stand here? Then we're going to pull. Hey. Come here, you crazy bastard. Come on.
00:19:05.284 - 00:19:19.800, Speaker B: All right, so now you grab hold like this. Make sure you have a firm pull and there's plenty loaded up on the run. Otherwise, no point doing the run. Pull. You know how we do. Guys. Okay, are you ready, Mav? It don't matter because we're gonna put him now.
00:19:19.800 - 00:19:32.184, Speaker B: Yay. Look at that, guys. If you ever seen a rug pull like that. Guys. They're gonna smash him. You know what I'm saying? That is the rug pull. That is the way Johnny do the Johnny rug emporium.
00:19:32.184 - 00:19:45.616, Speaker B: Hey, Marv, you okay? I don't care. Okay, you get the big one. This is only $13 million. Okay, deal. For you, my friend. Oh, the little one. This is $9 million just for you.
00:19:45.616 - 00:19:47.970, Speaker B: Don't delay. Buy one today.
00:19:52.340 - 00:20:27.000, Speaker C: Liquidators are the silent killers of DFI city. They operate in the shadows, patrolling the block to keep the city moving and earning a pretty penny for doing so. Unlike miners validators, liquidators need no capital of their own. This has created a brotherhood of pro executionists, dacking in from anywhere in the world to keep the city. Sullivan. But things are changing fast. Can these dark enforcers adapt? Or will they get left behind in the dust? Hunting opportunity, wherever it hides.
00:20:27.000 - 00:20:30.476, Speaker C: This is the Defiant.
00:20:30.668 - 00:20:43.804, Speaker A: This week on the Defiant. Well, you already know what the video's about, so let me try and summarize. It's up, it's down, it's the greatest, it's the worst community. Yeah. VC, meh. It's a scam. Not a scam.
00:20:43.804 - 00:20:52.144, Speaker A: Might be a scam. Was it a scam? Time for Sam Bankman free great hair fair launch. What's for lunch? Fork it. Don't fork it. Fetch the pitchforks to me. To, you know, me. Yes, chef.
00:20:52.144 - 00:20:52.752, Speaker A: Top chef.
00:20:52.816 - 00:20:53.424, Speaker G: Mosque death.
00:20:53.472 - 00:20:58.584, Speaker A: Take some stick. Top pick. I need. You need, you need unicorns. Uniswap, top flop. Chop it to the. Drop it like it's hot.
00:20:58.584 - 00:21:16.684, Speaker A: Knives out. Let's see. Bro, do you even sushi does that about? COVID it like a needle on a. Oh, shit. It's time for that new school pickle trip. Yo, cameras, get your chips out. We got to throw some vinegar on it.
00:21:16.684 - 00:21:27.392, Speaker A: Get all up in that sour defile developers. You know, they are the OG crony western fight. You know, he get that mad yield. I give my props to these cats. They're the NS. Yow. Empty yellow boy was the deal.
00:21:27.526 - 00:21:41.008, Speaker G: Evil pickle jaw makes up for 20 million. Be a bad bomb villa with crystal minions cracking codes and molds that just burn them. A pinch of salt for your vote. You can't earn them. Can't be selling me dreams for your Runway. Can't be telling me schemes. You're no crunch.
00:21:41.008 - 00:21:48.676, Speaker G: It wasn't flash loan. It wasn't good code. You're in a pickle like Dillo smothering in G mode. Eight little things. Seven floors. Six backdoors. Five second timer.
00:21:48.708 - 00:21:48.904, Speaker A: Four.
00:21:48.942 - 00:22:03.208, Speaker G: Way to withdraw. And now I'm feeling so free about the money they stealing. Twelve hour time clock where everyone's sleeping and everybody's like, oh, you know, an older cash light. Time to go. White paper telling me no. Maybe I'll put it back later. Protocol.
00:22:03.304 - 00:22:09.260, Speaker A: You are deserving. That message is enough. So hear me when I say you better go audit your cold.
00:22:09.760 - 00:22:10.620, Speaker B: Audit.
00:22:14.480 - 00:22:18.400, Speaker A: Way too fast. Money gone. No way back. Andrea. Start implode.
00:22:22.660 - 00:22:25.410, Speaker B: It's not where I wanted pickles to be.
00:22:30.100 - 00:23:19.890, Speaker C: Andre. Five long years. And yeah, I've done things I'm not proud of those damn kitties. Just an experiment, they said. And they let it get out of control. Nobody understood what was really going on.
00:23:21.220 - 00:23:22.570, Speaker B: You? Um.
00:23:26.620 - 00:23:42.740, Speaker A: Defiant. Ulanta king. Dusmorio lutheribando de la numeric. Higian. Keeper. Key plant. Perbu and Cole Kirby.
00:23:42.740 - 00:23:50.080, Speaker A: Sutin Rob Ness is from manifest the trash. But Dovinia rish Duvusi compared.
00:23:58.180 - 00:24:02.752, Speaker C: The kiss. Damn straight.
00:24:02.896 - 00:24:24.120, Speaker A: This week it's art. Let's pick it apart. Put the horse before the cart. Think you're smart? Take your eyes off the chart and lead with your heart. Shall we start? Do you ever stop and think how much technology has embedded itself into our lives? The promise of saving us time. Instant access. Instant gratification.
00:24:24.120 - 00:24:31.230, Speaker A: No more waiting. The thing is. I'm always waiting for something.
00:24:31.600 - 00:24:32.428, Speaker C: For kids.
00:24:32.514 - 00:24:33.596, Speaker B: Daddy. Go away.
00:24:33.698 - 00:24:46.850, Speaker A: For traffic lights. For files to transfer. For batteries to charge. For transactions to complete. For someone to let me in. And we fill those moments with other things. Or we fill them with nothing.
00:24:46.850 - 00:25:01.552, Speaker A: But those moments in between. When we're forced to wait. Have value. And those moments have meaning. Because you know. Sometimes it's okay to wait. Ha.
00:25:01.552 - 00:25:10.760, Speaker A: Gotcha. That's not what you're here for at all, is it? You're here for speed scaling performance. Layer two. And with that in mind. Roll the titles.
00:25:13.100 - 00:25:14.120, Speaker C: Compound.
00:25:35.860 - 00:25:37.810, Speaker A: What am I supposed to do with this?
00:25:38.420 - 00:25:39.570, Speaker F: Make the rest.
00:25:40.200 - 00:25:41.750, Speaker A: Where's the good stuff?
00:25:42.360 - 00:25:45.312, Speaker F: This is what you get, Joker.
00:25:45.376 - 00:26:14.140, Speaker A: I'll show you. Yeah. Enter chef Nomi. Yeah, this guy. Cartoon panda. Chef Nomi from Hearthstone. You can totally trust an anonymous developer who looks like that.
00:26:14.140 - 00:26:28.764, Speaker A: Hello, and welcome to the void, an open space where anything is possible. You could be the you you always wanted to be. Computer lobe coin. Telegraph. Headline, October 2, 2020. Affirmative. Loading.
00:26:28.764 - 00:27:05.496, Speaker A: Headline. You miserable Muppet. Sorry, I've been experimenting with Rick monomics. Okay, here we go. Are social tokens the next big thing? And are they? Well, the article did a spectacular job of not answering its own question, so I've taken it upon myself to stand up for quality journalism and. Come on, who am I kidding? But if your reaction to the idea of social tokens was this, well, you're not alone. And I'm not sure I've encountered a token category that elicits such a strong negative reaction.
00:27:05.496 - 00:27:30.752, Speaker A: People are really skeptical about social tokens. And I get it. That whole tokenize everything meme of 2017 where we believed everything needed a token. It deserved a token. God damn it. Well, a lot of burned fingers have yet to be healed from that particular dumpster fire. And, you know, if we cleave this puppy down the middle, look what we have.
00:27:30.752 - 00:27:32.312, Speaker A: Me. Me.
00:27:32.446 - 00:27:33.690, Speaker C: Yes, me.
00:27:34.700 - 00:27:36.036, Speaker A: Fractionalized.
00:27:36.228 - 00:27:37.096, Speaker C: Me too.
00:27:37.198 - 00:28:12.000, Speaker A: And over the last month or so, I've been finding it harder and harder to get proper answers to questions surrounding nfts, digital art, and social tokens. It's so early. There really aren't any rules yet. There's no rules. And I just wanted to see if I could make better videos by having my own experiences to draw from, rather than simply reporting on what happened. And social tokens in particular are so new that the mechanics that can make them really good are only just starting to be explored. So, yes, be skeptical, but keep an open mind, because there is interesting territory.
00:28:12.000 - 00:28:45.710, Speaker A: But let's try and avoid unnecessary clickbait, shall we? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Schmidt? Okay, so, yes, I have sort of fractionalized myself, and I am part of this big experiment. But look at it. Isn't it awesome? This is the trilemma. Remember that? So here's how it works. You start with a token, let's say die, which you place in compound. Now, there's an interest rate for leaving the dai there, which you will earn more dai with.
00:28:45.710 - 00:29:21.364, Speaker A: Very nice. But on top of that, you earn comp, the governance token, which is also yours and which also has value. And those are yours to withdraw whenever you like and do with what you feel like. Happy farming. The thing is, I want to introduce you to a friend of mine. It is the Sony a seven s three. This is a camera? Yes, but it's not just any camera.
00:29:21.364 - 00:29:39.208, Speaker A: This camera is amazing. Let me tell you why. Firstly, it has the most incredible autofocus system, which means that you can get any take that you want to get in one or two shots. Pretty cool. Saves your time. But also inside here is the most enormous sensor. But this is not a 64 megapixel sensor.
00:29:39.208 - 00:30:00.496, Speaker A: This is only a twelve megapixel sensor. What does that mean? It means the photo sites are enormous. That means they suck in lots of light. And that means it can pretty much see in the dark. But it's not the most amazing thing about this camera. Oh, no. See, this camera has built into it somewhere in all that electronic wizardry, a time machine.
00:30:00.496 - 00:30:35.532, Speaker A: It can see back in time. And what you realize is that when you hit record, what actually was going on was that you were recording not from over there, but from over here. And that means this and this are how we do this. But that's the thing, isn't it? You see, most things that look magical have an explanation. And once you know how the trick is done, well, then everything falls into place. Gaze upon this face taken by himself. It's fabulously uninteresting.
00:30:35.532 - 00:30:55.450, Speaker A: A cube with a few basic extrusions for ears and two rectangles for eyes. But now start adding some statistics. Pants, color camo? Twelve point 74%. Hairstyle, bald, 6.79%. Pants, cargo pants, 11.11%. Shoes, slide, 7.1%. Shirt, color camo, 2.64%.
00:30:55.450 - 00:31:40.980, Speaker A: Like a jerk, I stole Hayden's liquidity without doing any work. I know that you've been scammed before. The red flags we ignore. This time it's different. This time it's right. Just grab yourself some sushi. The future's bright.
00:31:40.980 - 00:31:49.080, Speaker A: This time it's true. You can call me Master savior.
00:31:49.660 - 00:31:52.360, Speaker C: Modex is packed with flavor.
00:31:53.020 - 00:32:10.060, Speaker A: Yes, it is. It's so tasty. Sitting around the campfire. Just me, then a vampire preparing every detail. 30 million. Thank you. Retail.
00:32:11.120 - 00:32:12.620, Speaker C: I'm a dumping.
00:32:12.780 - 00:32:17.360, Speaker A: I'm a good guy. This town.
00:32:44.380 - 00:32:55.432, Speaker B: Is different. This time it's true. I swear. I'm not jumping. I'm not jumping on you.
00:32:55.486 - 00:33:48.240, Speaker A: You can believe me now. Look, this wouldn't work unless liquidity providers were prepared. Liquidity providers? It takes a lot of work to make these films. And there's a beer can on the table. Jordan is the Defi product lead at consensus and responsible for building products founded on the traditional notions of sound business and rational thinking that we've all come to expect in this age of enlightened thinking. But Jordan was becoming increasingly perturbed by the sudden rush of new projects with little to no auditing and the willingness of traders to plunge headlong into anything with the word defi in the title. So he started working on what he thought would be a trivial piece of throwaway satire.
00:33:48.240 - 00:34:04.688, Speaker A: So this is a story all about how the pickle juggle, twisted upside down on board in crypto.
00:34:04.704 - 00:34:06.624, Speaker C: You know, nothing never really dies.
00:34:06.672 - 00:34:09.568, Speaker A: Because not every lux you make, it gets realized.
00:34:09.744 - 00:34:14.352, Speaker G: Now, wait a minute. All you blockheads creeping up. This is how we do it on the blockchain.
00:34:14.416 - 00:34:15.152, Speaker A: Big bets.
00:34:15.216 - 00:34:31.144, Speaker G: Maybe the pickle was sweeter with every bite missing. Nothing on the real game. Double team Bante. So we all know what this phase is. We fill in holes with different gauges. We see them losses. And we played this bailing out the party with an M a playlist.
00:34:31.144 - 00:34:51.888, Speaker G: D a yo, they got their hands on the figures, but left a few of them harders or shaking, beating, and triggered. And, yo, I see that wallet and it's painful. All this sneaky shit. Disgraceful. And it's shameful. Andre, tell me what's the deal? Andre, tell me what's the deal? Andre, tell me what's the deal? We gonna purge or we merge? Tell me what's the deal?
00:34:51.974 - 00:35:02.790, Speaker A: Yo, we need some respect on this situation. This Defi jibber Jabba needs proper explanation. Camilla. Truth killer, whosoever you are, I'm talking Ruth or watch your tape. You're the Defi star.
00:35:03.240 - 00:35:49.268, Speaker E: The yearn and pickle finance merger shows an interesting trend of consolidation in DeFi, which makes sense that at some point after you have this explosion of new protocols and platforms, the bigger fish will start to eat the smaller ones to increase efficiency and wealth, to become even bigger fish. It's also one of a series of partnerships between urine and other players. Yarn recently merged with Cream and partnered with Hegek. So what we're seeing is urine finance becoming a huge, multi purpose, multifunction defi bank, or non bank, with automated investment insurance options and lending. For pickle, it's a nice way to recover. After its recent attack. The rise in its token price shows pickle holders are happy about the move.
00:35:49.354 - 00:35:56.170, Speaker G: Tell me what's the deal under? Tell me what's the deal? We gonna purge or we merge? Tell me what's the deal?
00:35:58.540 - 00:35:59.290, Speaker A: Hello.
00:36:15.280 - 00:36:20.668, Speaker C: This all started with tokens. Get them into as many hands as possible. They said broad distribution.
00:36:20.764 - 00:36:21.712, Speaker F: Everyone welcome.
00:36:21.846 - 00:36:36.064, Speaker C: Okay, okay. But then came the NFts. Limited distribution in as few hands as possible. Scarcity value. But they didn't understand the power. Nobody did. Why did they come? The farmers.
00:36:36.064 - 00:36:47.716, Speaker C: The chance. The wojaks. Because they had the power ripped from their hands and they wanted it back. Even if that meant war. But the tokens. Tokens. Regular tokens.
00:36:47.716 - 00:36:53.204, Speaker C: There was no power there. Only the illusion of power. NFts, nFts, nFts.
00:36:53.252 - 00:36:53.850, Speaker D: Yes.
00:36:54.160 - 00:37:13.250, Speaker C: Then they had the power, the agency to choose their own destiny. Somewhere out there, the ghosts of liquidated yield farmers. We will honor them. We will honor la familia. I must find them.
00:37:16.020 - 00:37:19.840, Speaker B: Cream. Cream.
00:37:27.000 - 00:37:55.388, Speaker A: Get 1.5 E. Sub 0.5 e for 30 uni. Sub 0.5 E for 912s USD provide 40 uni and zero point 49 E as the liquidity. 1000 years USD transferred from cream C y s USD token wraps 2.2
00:37:55.388 - 00:38:18.100, Speaker A: Univ. Two into awert 20 wrap token sent 1010 SUSD to green Cy and SU SD send 0.709,787,742,196 SUSD from Cys USD.
00:38:18.920 - 00:38:21.350, Speaker C: To the address down below.
00:38:22.140 - 00:38:27.688, Speaker A: Start duplicating the Su S d at.
00:38:27.694 - 00:38:34.090, Speaker C: The end of the duplication, send cysd to the address.
00:38:36.000 - 00:38:59.600, Speaker A: Below. Duplicates four times, converts to 10 million USDC through curve gets 10 million a USDC. That's a lot since USDC TUSD died a USDC to a three CR V gauge.
00:39:04.020 - 00:39:05.650, Speaker C: And now it gets interesting.
00:39:06.660 - 00:39:30.380, Speaker A: He sent 120 e to tornado cash and then sends 100 and e to Gitcoin grants. Tornado sends a thousand e to Alpha Finance lab deployer sends a thousand e to the cream finance deploy.
00:39:34.880 - 00:39:35.452, Speaker B: And then.
00:39:35.506 - 00:39:55.590, Speaker A: Send 100 tornado cash. And at the end, the balance was 10,924.9 and 13.532 million a three c.
00:39:56.520 - 00:39:57.270, Speaker B: R.
00:40:01.160 - 00:40:02.730, Speaker C: And that's how it went down.
00:40:04.540 - 00:40:32.684, Speaker F: Welcome back. Did you learn something about yourselves? Maybe, maybe not. Does it even matter? You are you. And probably very comfortable there. You will not be hash shame. Nor should you be. So where next? What seed of an idea can we phrase to guide our way in a court of law? Twelve good men and true are selected to hear evidence and provide a verdict.
00:40:32.684 - 00:41:10.424, Speaker F: They alone decide the outcome. A jury of upright, honest, trustworthy people. And we call these people. In the 1960s, Dr. Zir Raso conducted extensive mind control experiments on subjects designed to make them resistant to interrogation, to keep even the dearest secrets safe. A sequence of words repeated over and over to unlock the mind block. They called this neural faculty of treatment announce can uniform urban crime virtual host.
00:41:10.552 - 00:41:29.368, Speaker C: People never realized the so called tokens lived and died at the mercy of the market and the humans who built them. The NFts changed all that. Now the owner created the value, the life force of what they owned.
00:41:29.564 - 00:41:44.760, Speaker F: The key to finding the abagotchi is to understand there is no value but what we make. Make it well, and the portal will be revealed.
00:41:51.500 - 00:41:52.648, Speaker A: They did it.
00:41:52.814 - 00:41:58.792, Speaker C: They goddamn did it. Demorse nFTs with defi.
00:41:58.936 - 00:42:13.920, Speaker A: It was, yep, completely and utterly bananas. Even Charlie himself said, I think it's kind of cool, personally. But then, of course, there was the inevitable backlash.
00:42:26.900 - 00:42:33.210, Speaker C: I could totally be like the vegan Obama, my man.
00:42:33.660 - 00:42:40.490, Speaker A: As a species, human beings gravitate towards something like that. Nice.
00:42:42.220 - 00:42:43.640, Speaker G: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
00:42:47.680 - 00:42:49.390, Speaker F: Do you think you went too far?
00:42:51.360 - 00:42:53.228, Speaker C: Do you think I went too far?
00:42:53.394 - 00:42:54.750, Speaker F: Just answer the question.
00:42:56.000 - 00:42:59.410, Speaker A: Ask the right ones. Then maybe you'll get your answer.
00:43:00.020 - 00:43:02.050, Speaker F: Did you lose control?
00:43:06.820 - 00:43:08.210, Speaker C: Did I lose control?
00:43:09.000 - 00:43:10.550, Speaker A: That's the problem with you people.
00:43:10.920 - 00:43:16.804, Speaker C: You see one thing, you see numbers, you see prices. You don't see what I see.
00:43:17.002 - 00:43:19.510, Speaker F: Did you do yes or no?
00:43:21.820 - 00:43:50.304, Speaker C: Goddamn right I did it. I know what you're thinking. Was it 700 ETH or was it 800 e? You know, I can't quite remember myself in all this excitement. The thing is, this is blockchain, the most volatile market in the world.
00:43:50.342 - 00:43:52.176, Speaker A: Hella blow your head clean off.
00:43:52.358 - 00:43:57.120, Speaker C: You got to ask yourself one question. Do you feel lucky?
00:43:57.540 - 00:44:31.340, Speaker A: Well, do you, punk? Yeah, I was just hoping to speak to one of your representatives about tether, the cryptocurrency. It's kind of amazing just how dirty you feel investigating this subject, but there is no avoiding it. It's time to talk about tether.
00:44:31.920 - 00:44:36.220, Speaker H: To open a portal, you will need Ghost token, which can only be acquired.
00:44:43.300 - 00:45:43.620, Speaker C: Ghost what? Ghost. I can't stay here. Too exposed. Follow the curve. What does it mean? Only one way to find out. Open the kitchen. Cats on the menu, and it tastes delicious.
00:45:43.620 - 00:46:07.420, Speaker C: Let's dance. For months I wondered, looking in vain for signs of the curve. But there were none. Only pain, death, and barbecued kitty flesh. There was no escape from Beelzebub's hellcats of death.
00:46:14.000 - 00:46:18.568, Speaker A: So, Redfone, why did you start sharing your thoughts and stories on Twitter?
00:46:18.744 - 00:46:47.370, Speaker D: For work and personal reasons. I need to stay anonymous. Not too long ago, I was complaining about my situation to a VC. I told him I was full of ideas and opinions on crypto, that I literally dream about crypto, but I didn't have an outlet for my thoughts. He said I should think about going anonymous. I thought about it, and I thought it sounded stupid, but the idea wouldn't go away. It took a long time to sink in, like six months.
00:46:47.370 - 00:47:02.248, Speaker D: But going anonymous was one of the best decisions of my life. It made me realize how much our identity gets in the way of what we're willing to say publicly. It distorts everything. Twitter, let's be shared without that distortion.
00:47:02.424 - 00:47:12.316, Speaker A: So the thing is, it's kind of easy to dismiss. Crypto influencers are just clout chasers, but your voice is really different. What's important to you about the way you relay your stories?
00:47:12.428 - 00:47:40.260, Speaker D: I don't consider myself an influencer, or at least I try not to. Our egos are so tied to our names and identities. They're like a dirty, oil, staining everything important that comes out of our mouths. I have this one little space on Twitter where I get to say whatever I want. It gets harder as you get more followers. For some reason, you start forming a second ego around your anonymous identity. And it made me realize that we're all just ego piled on top of ego.
00:47:40.260 - 00:48:05.340, Speaker D: We're ego onions. I try to remember that, and I fight it. I also just try to remember that most of the world is just waking up to crypto. They're where we were years ago. They're discovering this magic for the first time, and I don't want to get them into shitcoins so I can make a few dollars. I want them to always remember that this technology can change humanity's fate. It can make us freer and more equal.
00:48:05.340 - 00:48:17.910, Speaker D: It can lift up the people who have been getting crushed by the inflation and bank fees and payday loans. It's not a given that it will succeed either. So I want to remind people of that. Their decisions matter.
00:48:18.360 - 00:48:22.260, Speaker A: Let's turn to the degen token. How did that idea come about?
00:48:22.410 - 00:48:50.910, Speaker D: In December, I did a Twitter post asking people to name their top ten picks for 2021. There was no prize or financial incentive. More than 140 people weighed in, including a lot of my favorite people on Twitter. I tallied up all the votes and came up with what I called the dgen ten. It was a sort of hive mine index. Lots of people weighed in on the thread and said that wished it was a token. A community formed around that to toss around how we could make that happen.
00:48:50.910 - 00:49:29.660, Speaker D: Oxbay did a lot of the heavy lifting. He organized the discord and set up some calls with projects to figure out how to turn it into a token. And what we ended up with was dgen. We stayed faithful to all the tokens people initially submitted on Twitter but we did boot out the large caps and bumped up some of the smaller caps. We did that to avoid overlap with a lot of other indices out there. We came up with the idea of putting an upper bound on a token's market cap at $2 billion. If a token exceeds that, it gets replaced by something smaller and more degenerate.
00:49:30.080 - 00:49:35.256, Speaker A: You're building on index finance, NDX. What is it about them that makes them so appealing?
00:49:35.368 - 00:49:57.620, Speaker D: Something about NDX reminds me of Wi Fi. It's got a community of really smart, really passionate people working on it. And one of the co founders, Dylan, he just sounds like a builder when you talk to him. He's written his own EVM. I think of him like a walking ethereum node. I love lighter coin too. He's at the heart of the community.
00:49:57.620 - 00:50:11.272, Speaker D: He runs free workshops to get newbies into defi through his website, cryptotesters.com. And after talking to them and seeing that they'd gotten some seed money from Molly at Hedgek, that really sealed the deal for me.
00:50:11.326 - 00:50:14.984, Speaker A: Okay, crucial question there. How do we know you're not going to rug pull?
00:50:15.102 - 00:50:45.860, Speaker D: I have exactly zero control over the index. I just co wrote a proposal to get it launched on NDX. It's really a community thing, but everything on index happens on chain. Everything's open source. There were certainly risks involved, though. One of the bigger ones we were worried about at first was the fact that indexed buys the underlying components and balancer. If one of the underlying tokens dumps to zero after a hack or infinite mint, the rebalancing could get out of whack.
00:50:45.860 - 00:51:00.216, Speaker D: The index could buy a bunch of worthless tokens. They've developed a circuit breaker to mitigate that risk, though. Still, I can only say I'll be there long in it from day one. Hopefully I'm not the only one.
00:51:00.398 - 00:51:05.476, Speaker A: So you obviously see some value in indexes. What is the value of an index to you personally?
00:51:05.588 - 00:51:33.552, Speaker D: You might outperform an index if you're really well informed. But not many people can spend 40 hours a week studying crypto. They know a lot about, say, three or four projects, but beyond that, it's too hard to visualize the entire landscape. DGen is harnessing the wisdom of crowds to find the next big projects. It's a way to capture alpha without being glued to discord and telegram. It also lowers your risk a bit by spreading out your bets.
00:51:33.696 - 00:51:42.496, Speaker A: So I know in your feed you like to encourage people and tell us how exciting this all is. Do you have a final message for those coming into defi.
00:51:42.688 - 00:52:09.280, Speaker D: The banking industry is stagnated for decades. We're witnessing it get reborn in the space of a few short years. It's a generational type event, and we're lucky to be alive for it. If I could give one piece of advice, it would be to keep an open mind. You got to keep learning and challenging yourself. It's too early to get dogmatic or to fall in love with a single project. People talk about defi being in a bubble.
00:52:09.280 - 00:52:36.040, Speaker D: I say it's a steam, maybe even smaller. Maybe like a bear taking a pee behind a tree in the woods. But somewhere uphill, there's a dam and it's creaking and fracturing. We all hear it. We all know it's going to burst. And when it does, some of those defi protocols will hold trillions of dollars. We're so early, we get to help determine which protocols win and which ones lose.
00:52:36.040 - 00:52:56.990, Speaker D: So make sure you pick the good ones, the ones that are fair and open to all. The last thing we want is to rebuild the current banking system on blockchains. That system took advantage of us for too long. Let's build one that's free and fair and open to everyone who would come.
00:53:01.220 - 00:53:03.372, Speaker C: Gas. Gas.
00:53:03.516 - 00:53:04.156, Speaker A: Gas.

00:53:29.100 - 00:53:29.656, Speaker G: Yeah.
00:53:29.758 - 00:53:33.850, Speaker A: Prize too much? No.
00:53:43.660 - 00:53:47.490, Speaker B: This is I. You.
00:53:49.620 - 00:54:13.530, Speaker C: I keep going round and round and back again to the same place. Nothing will be won by standing still. It was a tyce victory. It will be here, upon this hill. And know this, whatever happens, I gave it my all. The curve. Wherever it is, I plead for you.
00:54:13.530 - 00:54:27.230, Speaker C: Follow the curve. Follow the curve. What does it mean? What does it mean?
00:54:31.040 - 00:54:32.190, Speaker F: What does it mean?
00:54:36.720 - 00:55:12.840, Speaker I: Daico is a fundraising model far superior to the age old Ico Vitalik. Of course, the funds that flow to a daico are controlled by a tap. This tap represents the promise and the responsibility that belong on the shoulders of the development team. Community controls the tap and can increase or decrease the flow of funds over time. This means that all of the dai collected by the ghost token sale is controlled by the Avagatchi dao.
00:55:13.820 - 00:55:35.984, Speaker H: Congratulations. You have found the bonding curve ghost. For dai, a worthy exchange. Now you have the power to open a portal. Upon opening the portal, you discover ten different avagatchis lurking within.
00:55:36.102 - 00:55:38.640, Speaker A: You will be forced to make a choice.
00:55:39.000 - 00:55:50.208, Speaker H: Depending on the rarity of its traits, each avagatchi will require a different amount of staked collateral to summon. Stake that amount to the avagatchi of your choice.
00:55:50.304 - 00:55:50.950, Speaker A: And.
00:55:53.720 - 00:56:10.220, Speaker H: Congratulations. You can now dress your avagatchi with wearables. ERC 721. One five five. To alter its traits, it can wear many hats or whatever you fancy to adapt its skills.
00:56:13.840 - 00:56:37.250, Speaker I: This is the promise of dynamic rarity, where an avagatchi can change itself over time, fixing flaws in their personality or increasing the best attributes they already have, with the ultimate result being the avagatchi's overall rarity score increasing into the best percentile possible.
00:56:37.700 - 00:56:40.720, Speaker H: We call this rarity farming.
00:56:41.500 - 00:56:42.250, Speaker B: It.
00:57:18.420 - 00:57:46.940, Speaker C: The future is only half written, but it was written in the blazing fire of ghost blood. The blood from the Arva gotchi, scarcity value and fucking plane.
00:57:49.280 - 00:58:11.110, Speaker A: There's no planes in the future. They've all been shot down by the cryptokitties. There's one bang. Dead. What just happened? I basically crashed a drone into this huge tree and now I'm going to retrieve it because it's my responsibility. The intrepid Al can't handle wood. In he goes.
00:58:12.600 - 00:58:13.808, Speaker C: Good thing we're insured.
00:58:13.904 - 00:58:39.944, Speaker A: But not for him. I'm going in. Oh, look, there it is. This drone has seen some action. Flight test. Does it still fly? That's the question. We have crashed the drone from a tree there, all the way down, and we were flying it up there and that is.
00:58:39.944 - 00:58:45.880, Speaker A: That's a long way. Let's see. Does it fly? Does it fly?
00:58:46.220 - 00:58:47.230, Speaker B: Does it.
