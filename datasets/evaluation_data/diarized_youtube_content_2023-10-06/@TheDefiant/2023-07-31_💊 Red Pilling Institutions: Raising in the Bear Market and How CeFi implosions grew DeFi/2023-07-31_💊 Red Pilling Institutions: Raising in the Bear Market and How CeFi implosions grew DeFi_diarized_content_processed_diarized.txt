00:00:04.730 - 00:00:45.066, Speaker A: Welcome to the Defiant. I'm your host, Tagan Klein. Today we have Aya, co CEO and co founder of Fractal. Aya is a crypto og from Bloomberg to CNBC. Now the defiant Aya shares her founder journey of Fractal, the impact that the FTX collapse had on institutional players DeFi growth since many CFI companies imploded, how fractal is red pilling institutions, as well as her prediction on how many institutions will be custodying crypto and having tokens on the balance sheet in five to ten years time and so much more. But first, Aya tells us about her crypto journey thus far.
00:00:45.168 - 00:01:36.118, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's been definitely, I would define it as a journey. It started off in 2018 when I joined Pantera Capital, and few people actually realized this, but 2018 was actually at the cusp of when a lot of the DfI blue chips that really gained traction in the DFI summer of 2020 actually started. So you had Ave synthetics compound were just a few auger. All of these companies were started either pre 2018 or around 2017. And so that's when I joined Pantera. That was also during the boom and bust of the ICO bubble. And so it was a really interesting time to test how companies can raise capital in tokenized public markets and in a way that was decentralized.
00:01:36.118 - 00:02:28.522, Speaker B: And so that was really interesting. It was a front row seat to all of that growth and then from there transitioned into an operator role, which was previously my background at Falcon X. So was part of the founding team of Falcon X and joined very early on to build out their sales and trading arm of the business globally and headed that as well. So after being there for three and a half years, leading the company through their Series D left last year, definitely had a lot of concerns when I left, even starting from around the Luna crash beginning of March of 2022, and concerns that I wanted to spend not just part of my time, but all of my time really focusing on and helping fix. And that led to my transition out in September and then into fractal and where it is today.
00:02:28.656 - 00:02:45.934, Speaker A: Amazing. And I'm super excited to get into fractal in a moment. But I do want to double click on your time at, you know, I know you left. I think it was around two months before the FTX collapse. Can you tell us a little bit about kind of the inside scoop leading up to that collapse and just client and investor sentiment?
00:02:46.062 - 00:03:34.394, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So as you mentioned, I left in September prior to FTX. But what I can say is I think there was a lot of, and you see this actually happen a lot in crypto, where bull markets create confidence in investors that may necessarily not need to be there in certain third parties. And what FTX led to was actually this huge impulse of self custody and exchange withdrawals, the largest, actually in history of crypto. And it led to a momentum of on chain activity. You saw it, I'm sure, with the graph, you saw it with other protocols, and you saw even developers on other ones, like Ethereum, even avalanche. Those numbers peaked after what happened with FTX.
00:03:34.394 - 00:04:08.966, Speaker B: And there's actually two statistics that I think are really interesting. Most notably that happened on chain. What happened after the March 2020 sell off was you really started to get real entrance in size on chain. And then what happened with FTX in 2020 was you saw this massive deleveraging, and that deleveraging is what led to self custody being a must not should have and exchange withdrawals. And I think you're seeing the effects of that both in the companies that are being built today, but also in investor sentiment overall.
00:04:09.078 - 00:04:18.254, Speaker A: Absolutely. And kind of on fractal. So it's an institutional DeFi platform. First, can we talk a little bit about the current state of DFI as you see it?
00:04:18.372 - 00:05:01.686, Speaker B: Sure. So I would say DFI TPL itself is obviously a statistic people look at quite a bit. It's been kind of all over the place with the markets, but it has in April of earlier this year, from Jan to April, it was up 30%. And so you are definitely still seeing activity on chain happening. The other thing that's happening with DFI is you're seeing, because you have interest rates at where they are today. You have the Fed potentially gearing up to raise interest rates later this week, and you also have treasuries and risk free rate at around 4%. Where you're actually starting to see in DFI is the first time there's this massive push to get real world assets on chain.
00:05:01.686 - 00:05:31.014, Speaker B: So I think the number is there's over $4 billion worth of real world asset loans that have been extended and tokenized on chain across all the protocols in crypto today. That's a pretty big number, and obviously that's growing. You're seeing a number of tokenized treasuries. And so there's definitely interest in bringing a lot of the activity that you saw in CFI and some of the activity you're seeing in traditional finance on chain, despite TVL potentially being down at large.
00:05:31.132 - 00:05:54.554, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting that it did increase 30% over that duration that you mentioned. And I almost think that the regulatory action on these centralized exchanges had the opposite effect of what the regulators thought they was. They maybe expected money to go back into centralized finance, but really what we saw was it went to decentralized finance. Would you kind of agree with that correlation?
00:05:54.682 - 00:06:45.514, Speaker B: 100%. And I think there's so much data to back that up. If you look at uniswap alone, uniswap has had more than two to three days where it not just slightly surpassed Coinbase volumes, but there was one day where it had over 45% more volume, spot volume than Coinbase. I mean, that is a tremendous statistic. And I think people don't realize the amount of volume that happens on those high volatility days, and that DeFi is easier, sometimes cheaper to use. And the first choice for a lot of, not just retail, but also institutions. And a lot of the regulatory actions did create some of that push to off chain or on chain, excuse me, on chain providers.
00:06:45.642 - 00:07:04.418, Speaker A: Totally. And kind of thinking back to the TVL explosion from DFI summer in 2021 and 22, and as you alluded to, we realized kind of a lot of that was based on this excessive leverage. So where do you kind of see DeFi headed overall? What path do you see it kind of going on?
00:07:04.504 - 00:08:39.214, Speaker B: Sure. So at large, I think the big issue that DeFi has had is always this cat and mouse game of yield. And where's the yield coming from? And is the yield normal and non incentivized and just natural flow versus like, token incentives or any other incentives that inflate non real yield? And I think real world assets is a big bucket that I know a lot of money is being spent towards to tokenize whatever real world asset has yield. I've seen really interesting products that, for example, you have a vault and you're buying very, very boring insurance products, and you're just able to tokenize that and now use that as collateral in the same way that you would use that as collateral in traditional finance and find someone who would underwrite it. So there's really interesting stuff that's being worked on in the real world asset space that just takes time to build. And there's a lot of jurisdictions in the world, whether it's France, Singapore, Japan, that are very proactive and trying to push those along. And then the other area that you're seeing in Defi is you're actually just seeing this move away from a lot of these tokenized incentives, whether it's derivative exchanges or even uniswap x you're seeing that there's just natural volume and flow of people who want to trade in and out of these assets that lead to very natural trading fees that incentivize the market makers to continue providing volume.
00:08:39.214 - 00:09:04.762, Speaker B: And so really, what I mean is that the iterations of these products are finally reaching a point where you don't need incentives for something to not only break even, but you can make money off of if you're a user in that ecosystem. And so, again, this stuff just takes time, and incentives are sometimes a necessary way to jumpstart that growth. But I'm sure you've seen a lot of that, even in your position as well, with what you've seen.
00:09:04.896 - 00:09:19.818, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And it looks like you guys are targeting institutional defi, which kind of signals to me that you think that that's here to stay. How do you see that evolving and growing? Do you think it is poised for growth?
00:09:19.994 - 00:10:10.954, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think that what I've seen, at least with the clients previously that we had at Falcon X, was a lot of them wouldn't touch anything on chain. And the biggest transition I've seen with those same clients post at PX, is that on chain risk is conceptualized. You can actually underwrite it, even smart contract risk, because you can transparently see where those assets are being held and how they're being used. You can underwrite that risk. CFI risk, you cannot underwrite. It's really this black box model of not knowing whether rehypothecation is happening, not knowing where those assets sit, not knowing that when you log into your account and it says $10 million, the $10 million are actually there, and it's not being sent to some backdoor market maker that's trading it on your behalf.
00:10:10.954 - 00:10:42.854, Speaker B: So all of this stuff has really led to better adoption of DFI. You have to be able to underwrite your credit risk and your counterparty risk. And I think that's an unfortunate lesson that a lot of counterparties learned. And so DeFi provides not only that disintermediation, but also transparency. And I think the gap is there just haven't been institutional D five products in the space. And what I mean by that is, institutional products are white glove. They have to have 24/7 coverage.
00:10:42.854 - 00:11:09.566, Speaker B: There needs to be support staff, someone that you can call and talk to. So the protocol itself could be decentralized, but you still need people to help onboard those users to the protocol, to help facilitate those trades. And that's hopefully where fractal is really bridging the gap. But we've definitely seen a lot of interest from clients who wouldn't necessarily use the product six, eight months ago, who are now some of our first beta users.
00:11:09.678 - 00:11:33.910, Speaker A: Amazing, exciting, and I guess we have to learn these lessons every new cycle, it feels like. But it is good that more and more people are learning. And for us, retail DeFi users like us, it's so much easier and cost effective to use DeFi than anything centralized. And so do you think that cost efficiency of defi kind of carries over through to the institutional users?
00:11:34.070 - 00:12:21.014, Speaker B: Yes, I can't emphasize enough how much cheaper it is to use DeFi. So one thing that was a really interesting pattern that we saw while I was at Falcon X was because of the way that a lot of these tokens come to market. Majority of them actually don't initially launch on binance or centralized exchanges, but in fact will launch and do an initial token launch on a decentralized exchange. Sometimes that's uniswap, other times it's in partnership with someone like balancer. And what you'll find is that a lot of the best liquidity pockets are actually in DFI versus CFI. And so sure, if you go out of the ten top majors, majority of the time, there's better liquidity on chain than there is off chain. So that's a first.
00:12:21.014 - 00:13:03.798, Speaker B: You will find cheaper prices in DFI than CFI for a lot of these tokens, even to just purchase spot. And so I don't think a lot of people realize that. And that's also the beauty of the way that a lot of these tokens come to market, is that the best liquidity is where they are initially launching. So that's the first. The second is disintermediation. Right. It's just when you have five different people trying to take two to ten bips on a trade, that adds up tremendously, as opposed to you just engaging directly with whether it's the lender, the bar, the market maker, and you just have that one single transaction fee, that's the second.
00:13:03.798 - 00:13:46.794, Speaker B: And the third, which I think is the best part of just on chain finance and at large, is it's all transparent. You can literally go and see how much you are charged. And if, let's say you disagree with that, you are more than welcome to go and use other service providers. And I think that's the beauty of what you've seen. It's one reason that it's very hard to build on chain, but it's the beauty that you've seen even between the relationship between sushiswap and uniswap. It's the beauty when you see any forks of any of these large blue chip protocols, even the relationship between compound and Aave, where you've seen those lending yields change or differ between protocols. And I think that's great for the end user.
00:13:46.794 - 00:14:59.318, Speaker B: Why? Because you're given the option to really decide where you want to trade, and you're given the transparency as well, which you should appreciate. And then the last thing I'll say too, in addition to it being cheaper, I can't emphasize again, the counterparty risk is a cost that you are also paying, right? Whether you might be paying less in transaction fees, but you're actually paying higher in counterparty risk, and you may not necessarily be thinking through how much that counterparty risk is. So sometimes that smart contract risk, if structured correctly, whitelisted correctly, with the right security features on top, is actually a cheaper model and cheaper counterparty risk for you than the black box CFI model that you just don't know how to price. And so I think that's something that people don't always calculate into their end score. And one also beautiful example of that was during the FTX debacle, there was someone who was a counterparty who was incredibly long on Makerdao. They were about to get margin calls. It would have led to a huge liquidation in the market and really rocked prices.
00:14:59.318 - 00:15:34.642, Speaker B: And what was nice about that event was the entire ecosystem was talking about it publicly and everyone could hedge against that margin call happening. And that's amazing. Whereas if you take even traditional finance with arcagos and what happened with Credit Suisse and what happened with these when you're unable to hedge and plan accordingly, because you don't have that transparency, that cost can sometimes be much larger than you as a counterparty can. Even, you know, it leads to what we've seen happen even in traditional finance.
00:15:34.706 - 00:15:40.390, Speaker A: Can you double click into that? Why is that such a great thing? Maybe for the less financially minded listener?
00:15:40.470 - 00:16:28.626, Speaker B: Sure. Absolutely. So taking FTX as an example, as opposed to you trading on uniswap or you doing trading on any on chain marketplace, when you are trading on an on chain marketplace, you do have smart contract risk if you are leaving your assets or depositing your assets. But assuming we're just doing a simple trade where you're going in and you're buying something, so you go in and buy something on uniswap, you have the assets pre funded in your metamask wallet. You are the signer of those transactions. You may have a fireblocks or other multi party signature security feature on top, but then you purchase, it happens automatically with a liquidity provider on the other side. And now you have the assets now held in your wallet with a ledger.
00:16:28.626 - 00:17:08.450, Speaker B: Whatever security features you have on top that's done on an exchange. Let's say, take for example, FTX. You have to pre fund your account, and so now your assets are leaving your wallet and they're sitting on the exchange. Now you may go and buy the, let's say, bitcoin or whatever asset on exchange. However, now the assets that you own are still sitting on that exchange. What happened with FTX is all of a sudden FTX collapses and your assets are now, not only are they not in your wallet, but you're not even able to withdraw them because lo and behold, the exchange is bankrupt. And so people don't think about that being that's what we define as counterparty risk.
00:17:08.450 - 00:17:35.598, Speaker B: But if that counterparty risk, sometimes you don't know how to underwrite it or calculate what that is. Sometimes that counterparty risk is much higher than any transaction fee that you'll be paying on something transparent like uniswap. Because again, in the uniswap example, you still have the assets. They're yours, they're sitting in your wallet. In the FTX example, you not only lost the asset, but you also probably paid a fee on top of it, too.
00:17:35.684 - 00:17:48.818, Speaker A: Absolutely. Thanks for the breakdown, and I want to get into the product and customer journey in a second. But before we do, maybe can you give us just the quick TLDR of fractal and the founding story, what inspired you to start?
00:17:48.984 - 00:18:21.606, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So fractal was actually built initially over a year ago with the team over at Ledger prime. So it was incubated at Ledger prime. And really the backend system was a number of risk engines that were used to manage Defi and on chain positions. And the original team of Fractal, as they were building it, realized, like DeFi and just on chain finance is incredibly difficult as an institution to manage. Not transparent, not capital efficient UI.
00:18:21.606 - 00:19:27.346, Speaker B: UX sometimes isn't giving you the accurate numbers. It's difficult to plug and pull information from smart contracts. Again, a good plug for the graph, which helps you organize a number of those features in an easy way, but in mean, it's just very difficult to operate in DeFi. And so the team came out of that and as last summer, basically spun out to build fractal and the initial iterations of fractal and what it came to be is combining kind of that background and then the background from Falcon x and some of the feedback from our clients was in order for institutions to ever be able to use on chain protocols, you need to make them capital efficient. You can't have these protocols pre fund every single account in your wallet because it becomes very, very expensive to do in size. And so how do you create both a capital efficient on chain product that gives you the institutional feel, but is still able to integrate into the DeFi protocols that have been battle tested now through multiple cycles. And that's what fractal is.
00:19:27.346 - 00:19:38.066, Speaker B: So it really is an institutional on chain collateral management tool that allows for ease of clearing, settling, and then extension of credit on top of those positions.
00:19:38.178 - 00:19:42.978, Speaker A: Amazing. I love it. And then talk to us a little bit about that product and customer journey.
00:19:43.074 - 00:20:38.200, Speaker B: Sure. So, for us, all of our borrowers on the platform are institutions that go through KYC, KYB. I'd say, on average, they tend to be like 150,000,000 plus in AUm, and they tend to be market neutral, crypto native funds. So the type of trading that they're looking to do is some sort of delta neutral position where they are long on one side, short on the other side, and earning some sort of interest on the asset in between. And that's the yield that they're making on the position that can look anywhere between, like an ETH basis trade, where you're long ETH, short the perp, and you're just collecting the staked ETH yield, or any other asset where you're staking it. Or it can be one of these defi yield farming pools, or like a convex pool, or even as a liquidity provider on uniswap or other DEXs. And so those are kind of the ranges of strategies that these clients are running.
00:20:38.200 - 00:21:49.274, Speaker B: They may be running them already on chain, and some of them are running them also via OTC, bilateral agreements. So, for example, if you have a client that can't necessarily touch DeFi directly due to KYC concerns, there's a way for you to wrap these products up in an OTC agreement whereby you get exposure to the underlying asset, but you're really still facing a market maker on the other side that's pricing it for you. And so those are a few examples. So really the user journey is, how do we take these borrowers? We let them put on the same position, but we do so in a way that is far cheaper than their ability to do so right now in Defi. And so what we've done is we've created basically these lender owned, segregated, managed accounts, whereby managers deposit assets, deploy strategies, they're segregated, and lenders have full transparency into the strategy and can underwrite the risk. The reason for that is there's no capital in the space lap after what happened with FTX, and rightfully so, because lenders couldn't underwrite the risk, they were lending into black boxes. And so this is a way for lenders to have full transparency into what's being deployed on what protocol, with what asset and so forth.
00:21:49.274 - 00:22:14.002, Speaker B: And so lenders are able to really manage the restrictions there. And then for managers, what we'll do is we'll make it capital efficient. So we will find ways to underwrite different types of collateral, as long as there's a liquid market. We've explored ways of collateralizing with tokenized treasuries, in partnership with a number of different players and so forth. So that's a very long ramble, but hopefully just a high level on the user journey.
00:22:14.066 - 00:22:21.062, Speaker A: Super helpful. And can you double click into some of the core features and capabilities that the sub accounts offer to an institution?
00:22:21.206 - 00:23:16.842, Speaker B: Sure. So I would say the biggest one is really this institutional wycle of service for underwriting different collateral requirements. So for example, we've been able to underwrite, in partnership with lenders and borrowers and different market makers, we've been able to underwrite esoteric things like a convex tricrypto pool. We've been able to underwrite assets that aren't currently supported on Aave that there's still a very liquid market for. We've been able to also underwrite liquid staking derivatives and get a lot of the large crypto prime brokers comfortable with those. And that's obviously very big, because really when you have the risk free rate at 5%, what happens for an institution is you need to minimum make a majority of these clients need to make a minimum of 15% to 20% baseline return. And so you have risk crew right here at five.
00:23:16.842 - 00:23:59.310, Speaker B: You could either lever into treasuries, or you can try to find that level of yield in onchain finance. And through these strategies, and what we've done is basically try to find ways where we've been able to underwrite yield bearing collateral for all of these positions, the same strategy, so that you're able to maximize the yield while still using very liquid assets to get capital efficiency. And really I would simplify that as allowing for different assets that currently exist across different protocols, across different layer ones and twos, allowing the ability for each of them to speak to each other through our risk engine and through the partnerships we've made across the ecosystem.
00:23:59.410 - 00:24:05.594, Speaker A: Amazing. And on the topic of liquid staking, who are the top players in the liquid staking industry, in your mind?
00:24:05.712 - 00:25:03.350, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So I mean, without question, obviously, stake teeth and wrap stake teeth is going to be the biggest one. On top of that, it really depends. We've seen a lot of, so it depends between you have iterations of that with things like origin ETH, so aggregations of liquid staked derivatives for Ethereum. And why those are attractive is because you'll see like minimum of, let's say 8% on something like oeth. And then we've seen on the liquid staking derivatives, it's not necessarily, obviously there's interest in eigen layer and some of those other players in the space, but we've also seen a lot of interest in even lp positions with the tricrypto pool. So for example, today, when you have something like a convex LP token, it's not necessarily a liquid staking derivative, but it's still a yield bearing LP token.
00:25:03.350 - 00:25:08.414, Speaker B: And we've seen a lot of interest in trying to be able to do something with that position as well, too.
00:25:08.532 - 00:25:21.070, Speaker A: Amazing. And just so I understand, can institutions use fractal to use existing defi primitives like say Aave or Uniswap? Or is it kind of built more to allow two counterparties to trade against one another directly?
00:25:21.150 - 00:26:07.294, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So it'll do both. So what fractal does is, depending on the strategy, it will create a customized smart contract that allows for only two whitelisted addresses to access it. So you'll have two whitelisted addresses, one from the lender, the borrower side, that are whitelisted funding accounts, and they're allowed to fund the strategy account. And then what happens with the strategy wallet that then deploys into whether it's aave, whether it's compound balancer, we are EVM compatible. So we do currently have integrations with the major players, GMX, mux. And basically what it allows it to do is now you're running a strategy, and it'll look and feel in the same way as if you were running the strategy independently.
00:26:07.294 - 00:27:16.502, Speaker B: But it is done in a strategy account, a fractal with a fractal risk engine inside that account. And so what that does is it monitors for if there's a loan on top, it monitors for margin requirements, it monitors for collateral requirements, and if necessary, it also monitors for liquidations as well that is, if it's deployed into these decentralized applications which we support today, there may be one that we don't support. We're currently building out that list. So if there's any DApps that are top of mind that institutions would find interest in, that's always something that we're looking for as we continue to integrate with more of these in the space. And then we're also bringing the OTC bilateral agreements on chain. So as you mentioned, if two counterparties are just facing each other, then what will happen is these accounts will, you'll still have your funding account, but then your strategy contract will basically act just as a third party escrow account. So let's say if you're entering into a transaction that requires margin, that margin will sit in that escrow account.
00:27:16.502 - 00:28:01.910, Speaker B: It will not be rehypothecated. You will see where it sits. And then what's nice is if it does need to get liquidated, it'll allow either the lender, the market maker or the borrower to call to liquidate depending on how the position is performing. So the idea again is how do you create an on chain transparent settlement system for collateral across all these applications, across all these tokens that don't speak to one another, across all of these OTC bilateral agreements that are just signed with traditional ISTA contracts but basically executed via Google spreadsheets on the back end? How do you create a more sophisticated, fully automated process that does so for you in a transparent way?
00:28:02.060 - 00:28:14.022, Speaker A: Amazing. And I've seen you refer in your comms to the product as a protocol, as in fractal protocol. Do you see it to be more of a Defi primitive or kind of somewhere between a product and a protocol?
00:28:14.166 - 00:29:35.058, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great call out and I think a really good catch. I think from our perspective today I'll talk about kind of the different phases of where we are today is kind know, as I discussed with the product in its early initial days, the future state of fractal. And what we're very excited for is as we've been onboarding more and more lenders and capital markets desks, we're super excited about working with Maple Clearpool, Cicada and all of these other lending providers as well. What we've noticed from some of these providers and even centralized lending prime broker desks is they all want to run the risk engine themselves because they are taking on some level of risk in order for the risk engine to operate correctly, for the margin calls to happen correctly, and for liquidations to happen correctly as needed. And so in today's state, Fraxola's protocol is automatically running the risk engine. In tomorrow's state, the goal is to have these lenders, market makers and different risk, basically different risk actors running the risk engine, and then fractal can fully decentralize in that state. At that point, it will make sense for us to have a token so that all transaction fees would get paid to those running the risk engine.
00:29:35.058 - 00:30:15.062, Speaker B: And of course, doing so in a fair way. And so that's the future state. And I think once, and if we're able to accomplish that, that will be a really beautiful state of institutional clearing and settling in a fully automated way without manual margin calls overnight or any of the manual mistakes that I think FTX really showed light to. And at that point, you'll have a fully decentralized system whereby you have two sides of a marketplace taking ownership for a trade face to face without the 15 middlemen that typical institutional products require.
00:30:15.226 - 00:30:21.618, Speaker A: Exciting. And that's some nice alpha. And how can listeners get involved in fractal today, say the everyday person?
00:30:21.784 - 00:31:02.218, Speaker B: Sure. So we're not as active on our fractal clearing Twitter, but our discord is pretty active today in terms of how we're working through the product, any product updates. For example, we did launch both the Camelot and Kronos pool in partnership with those exchanges. We're currently integrating with Mux, which we're really excited about and excited for GMX's V two as they're gearing to launch that. And so all of those updates will happen in our discord channel. And always feel free to send me an email. My email is just a ya@fractalproteocol.org.
00:31:02.218 - 00:31:09.538, Speaker B: And always happy to find both new applications for us to integrate with and anything new that we can keep. Top of mind.
00:31:09.624 - 00:31:15.574, Speaker A: Totally. And on that, what are some examples of how the protocol could be used in a composable way?
00:31:15.692 - 00:32:25.242, Speaker B: Yeah, so, I mean, the huge piece here is really what we're working on, is how to make different positions composable with one another. And so for us, the way to continue that expansion of composability is to be able to continue to underwrite more and more assets in the space that, again, are liquid and have liquid markets and also onboard more and more of these underwriters to manage the risk engine for these different assets. And so as assets launch and have liquid markets, you need risk engines that can back test, underwrite and then forward test and manage positions using those assets as collateral. And so in the example that I mentioned with tokenized insurance, the way for us to make expand composability is to have more and more of these underwriters get comfortable with underwriting these different tokenized assets, bring more and more lenders that are comfortable lending against those assets, and expand that ecosystem. So really, the future state is that all things should be composable on fractal as long as there's a liquid market to back it up. And that's kind of what we're working towards.
00:32:25.376 - 00:32:32.446, Speaker A: Exciting. And then can you double click into how you guys identified the need for something like fractal early days?
00:32:32.548 - 00:33:51.522, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, again, there was just so many pain points, and there still are. To engage in DeFi today, it's really hard to get the accurate information across these different protocols, and it's hard to not only build to the protocols, but also manage positions across the space. And as I mentioned, on the institutional side, there really just isn't an institutional feel to any of the on chain protocols today. And so for us, the idea was, what if we were able to bring this 24 7365 institutional white glove experience to onchain finance, add a layer of KYC into it, make these positions composable, really teach institutions how to use some of these protocols and smart contracts, and we do the heavy lifting. And will that then lead to more institutional adoption on chain? And so far it's been working. So I think we're pretty excited about how that's progressed. One actually cool data point that we have is, I think again, initially in our beta stage, we are very much supporting a lot of these delta neutral yield farming strategies.
00:33:51.522 - 00:34:24.174, Speaker B: And I think initially we're expecting those to churn monthly at maximum. And what we've seen is that these positions, since launching three months ago, have actually stayed on for the full three plus months. And so we haven't seen that churn happen. And so you actually get this cool institutional stickiness that you get in CFI, in DeFi. So if you're just able to bridge that gap, even for some of these protocols, it's great. I mean, that's the kind of user that you want on your platform. You just need to bridge the gap to getting them comfortable to use the application.
00:34:24.372 - 00:34:37.138, Speaker A: Totally. But that's not always easy. Talk to us, because it sounds like you're red pilling a lot of institutions, so talk to us about how those conversations usually go. And what do you generally include in those conversations that get people to actually listen?
00:34:37.304 - 00:35:12.110, Speaker B: Yeah, you're pretty spot on. I mean, listen, it's hard to teach anyone something that they haven't necessarily used or felt or seen before. There's always this initial pushback. I think what's nice is, and same goes for you as well. Having been in the space this long, a lot of these institutions have already had the first or maybe 2nd, 3rd iteration of that conversation by the time we get to them. But yeah, absolutely. I think the biggest thing our industry struggles with at large is simplification.
00:35:12.110 - 00:35:47.898, Speaker B: It's very easy to go down the rabbit hole of account abstraction and what a notes is safe is. And some of these more difficult terms where if you just don't understand what a smart contract is, you've already lost the user on the other side. And so one thing that we've spent a lot of time with our investors on is how do we simplify what this actually means? It means a lot of charts, a lot of user journeys that we've drawn out, and just sitting down with some of these institutions and using metamask. And hopefully that's what it takes to get these across the finish line.
00:35:47.984 - 00:36:07.246, Speaker A: Totally. And I remember during the last bull market, a lot of institutions were like, well, do you think I really need to be able to custody tokens in order to get involved in this space? And I'm like, yes, absolutely. If it's equity, it's not the space. And so I guess fast forward 510 years from now, how many institutions do you think will be custodying tokens?
00:36:07.358 - 00:36:54.990, Speaker B: All of them. I just don't imagine a world where you should not be not custodying your own assets. And I think, unfortunately, that's the one lesson the industry has had to teach users time and time again. It happened with Mount Gox, it happened with Bitmax, it happened with FTX, and it hasn't happened with Makerdao, it hasn't happened with compound, it hasn't happened with Aave. And sure, don't get me wrong, there are issues with usability sometimes of some of the applications that exist out there, but you don't lose the asset. And so I think that's the biggest thing. And so, yeah, I mean, there shouldn't be a single institution out there that isn't custodying their assets.
00:36:54.990 - 00:37:20.198, Speaker B: And one thing I will say is the custodians have progressed significantly in the types of things that they're able to support, the types of assets they're able to support. Bitco, Zodia, Fireblock. So much innovation has happened there and it takes time, but a lot of innovation has happened there, and that's really great for the space. But yes, back to your question, 100%.
00:37:20.364 - 00:37:27.830, Speaker A: Love that and agree. And then talk to us a little bit about the round you just raised. Congratulations. And what are you guys planning to do with those funds?
00:37:27.910 - 00:38:23.914, Speaker B: Sure. Thanks. The company actually raised the round, started the raise a week before FTX collapsed, and closed the round a week after FTX collapsed. So timing was really interesting, to say the least. And sentiment back then was you were either speaking to someone who thought crypto was dead or you were speaking to someone who really had conviction on the space. And so it was really interesting to speak with different investors at that time. But in terms of the round, so really fortunate and very lucky to have raised from some of the best investors, $6 million will be deploying that into just hiring and really making sure that we understand collateral, we understand composability, we understand security, and we understand DeFi as well as we can, and become very, very good at on chain collateral management.
00:38:23.914 - 00:38:41.090, Speaker B: That's really the area that we want to be best at everything else. We're excited to build partnerships with different players, whether it's on the capital market side, the prime broker side, the exchange connectivity side and so forth. But really, the focus is hiring some of the best and brightest engineers out there.
00:38:41.160 - 00:38:46.798, Speaker A: Amazing. And tell us a little bit about the business model today, kind of ahead of that potential future token launch.
00:38:46.894 - 00:39:22.222, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So today, I would think of us as structured similar to the way fireblocks is. So the way we make money is over assets under custody or assets that are held in this sub account as collateral. And so as opposed to more of the prime broker model, which is typically a yield spread or transaction fee. And so it's really thinking through different iterations of how long are those assets held as collateral, and also how are they being cross margined against other positions and other collateral management accounts as well.
00:39:22.356 - 00:39:28.286, Speaker A: Amazing. And then what advice do you have for someone who wants to follow a similar path as you have in your career?
00:39:28.398 - 00:40:46.586, Speaker B: Do it. I know that sounds simple and silly, but I think the hardest thing coming out of last year was having the confidence to say, I think I know what the solution is, and I think I've heard from clients what they want to be built. The hardest part was really just having the confidence to say, I'm just going to do it, and I'm going to have those conversations, I'm going to tough it out and raise during an FTX collapse and still have some confidence to say, this has to get built. And I think the people who build in crypto are some of the craziest people I've ever met, because crypto will beat you down. And you really need to have love and belief for what these different protocols and companies are building to say, I want to do it. I want to surround myself with more of these builders and thinkers and innovators, and I want to innovate. And, yeah, it's very hard to do that, but I would just say have as many conversations as possible because there's so many people out there who would be really supportive for you to just go for know, Tegan, I have so much respect for you.
00:40:46.586 - 00:40:53.854, Speaker B: You've done the same, and it's not easy, and we just need more people to rip the band aid and do it.
00:40:53.972 - 00:41:01.466, Speaker A: Completely agree. And I guess what is your why? What kind of keeps you motivated? Why crypto over any other industry?
00:41:01.578 - 00:41:28.694, Speaker B: Yeah, I would never leave. I would never leave crypto at this point. Once you've seen how much better the user experience is, how much easier it is, every time I have to send a wire, I think I lose like five years off my life through traditional banking rails. It takes five days. Something gets lost. They keep calling me to confirm small amounts. I mean, it is absolutely absurd.
00:41:28.694 - 00:42:25.910, Speaker B: And once you've been to your point, like red pill, to, well, this is what finance should look like, this is what the future financial iteration of products that we deserve should look like. You just can't go back. And institutions deserve. We're in the institutional space, but I truly believe that institutions just deserve a cheaper, easier product to use than traditional banking rails. And I truly believe that the people who should be making money in the space are the ones that are providing liquidity and the ones that are supporting these applications. And once you see how much, even if you take, for example, this is going to sound very traditional finance. But if you look at even just FX, the amount of money the FX markets brings in for just the ability to convert assets from one currency to another is egregious.
00:42:25.910 - 00:43:13.210, Speaker B: It's crazy. And it's because you've had these financial institutions who monopolize different industries, and FX is just one big example of that. You only have three big FX debts that monopolize all of FX flow. But if you were to take that even to auto sales, home sales, when you don't have transparency for how these financial transactions happen, you start to see that there's a lot of cracks in the way they're being priced, and the users are always the ones paying for that. And so, yes, despite the market beating you down, there's nothing else I'd rather be working on. And I can't really imagine having a not crazy roller coaster ecosystem to be in every single day.
00:43:13.360 - 00:43:18.998, Speaker A: Totally embrace the chaos. And with that, our last question is just how are you defiant.
00:43:19.174 - 00:44:20.480, Speaker B: I think there's a big group of builders who have really toughed out so many market cycles and I'm fortunate to be surrounded by those builders like yourself, like many others in the space who have, despite market cycles that for a lot of people, force them to go back into traditional jobs, despite that have been able to say, you know what, this is the reason I want to double down on this. And to your point about embracing chaos, that's a really hard thing to do when markets collapse and it's a really hard thing to do when things don't go as planned. And yeah, just very grateful for that community of builders in this space who are able to time and time again, just see the chaos happen and say, this is why I'm going to double down. We're all just a little bit crazy, but clearly love this space enough.
00:44:20.850 - 00:44:25.486, Speaker A: Totally amazing. Well, thank you so much for coming on. I appreciate it.
00:44:25.588 - 00:44:30.860, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having me close.
