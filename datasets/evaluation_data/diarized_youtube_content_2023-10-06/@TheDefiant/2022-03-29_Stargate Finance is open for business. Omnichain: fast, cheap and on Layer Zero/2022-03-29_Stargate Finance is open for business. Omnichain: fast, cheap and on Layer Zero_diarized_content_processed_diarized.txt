00:00:00.330 - 00:00:15.742, Speaker A: Are you welcome for the omnichain future? I certainly am. And today we're going to be taking a look at Stargate, specifically a walkthrough of what's going on here. It's built on layer zero zero Xmarkey is involved. What's going on? Well, we'll get to that straight after this.
00:00:15.876 - 00:01:11.298, Speaker B: In 2021, Ethereum traders lost over $200 million to malicious bots exploiting their trades. As DFI continues to gain popularity, this number is expected to rise. Eden RocketRPC is a next generation private transaction service for ethereum, providing traders with MEV protection by submitting transactions directly to miners and away from the prying eyes of harmful bots. Using Eden network for Ethereum transactions results in better and safer trades. Now, while MEV protection doesn't require any stake, traders who do stake the Eden token and use the Eden RPC on Metamask receive transaction block priority. And now with the release of staker extractable value, or SEV, they are paid for every trade they make on Ethereum. Eden Rocket RPC compiles some of Ethereum's fastest private transaction networks, resulting in a 90% plus effective hash rate.
00:01:11.298 - 00:01:57.930, Speaker B: And this makes Eden rocket RPC the fastest private transaction network available, protecting you from bots. On top of that, Eden rocket RPC users are paid to trade on ethereum. Join the best and get started with Eden Network today and trade safer the NFT landscape is rapidly evolving. It's moving away from static JPEGs and towards real utility. Creators are looking for a solution that will help them to more deeply engage with and grow their communities. Galaxys sits on the cutting edge of this next evolution by allowing users to deploy a supercharged Nat collection that includes dynamic utility traits. These traits can be used by anyone with a following to offer exclusive discounts, VIP access, digital and physical redeemables, and much more to their audience.
00:01:57.930 - 00:02:17.990, Speaker B: With the Galaxys launchpad, users will be able to define smart contract parameters, choose their utility traits and presale options, launch a website and community space and deploy their NFT collection for sale with no coding required.

00:02:18.330 - 00:03:01.878, Speaker A: So the skinny is that Stargate is a fully composable liquidity transport protocol that lives at the heart of omnichain defi. What do they mean by omnichain? Well, it's not exactly omni where Omni means everything, it's just a bunch of specific chains that can be connected together using the layer zero protocol. Now we looked at layer zero a while back, and I really liked the idea of it. A low level communication protocol that avoids the need to wrap tokens through bridging mechanisms. That is very exciting because it makes the whole thing more efficient and it actually makes it much more secure. That is the secret source of Stargate, and it does it by using its own native assets, the Stargate token, to do so. Let's look at some of the highlights here.
00:03:01.878 - 00:03:35.502, Speaker A: I mean, it feels kind of like a swapping decks kind of thing. You have a transfer that really is actually probably the secret sauce in all of this. We'll get back to that. There are some pools, there are some farms, and then there's some staking here. And it kind of feels a little bit like Olympus in a way, or curve. You can lock STG tokens to receive VSTG, and the longer you stake those tokens, the more rewards you will receive. But if we remember, Layer Zero is this, and this is the first protocol built on layer zero.
00:03:35.502 - 00:04:01.980, Speaker A: But what I liked about it was this low level communication, primitive. It's literally like getting on the phone, calling up someone at the other end and saying, yes, I can confirm that the funds are there. Rather than having to physically move the funds from one place to another, it's simply communication. I mean, obviously it comes with some trade offs as well, but that's fundamentally the thing that's exciting here. So here it is. Here is Stargate. I'm logged in something interesting here.
00:04:01.980 - 00:04:19.386, Speaker A: I'm logged in under my Robinschmidt ETH account, and it's actually really in the uppermost NfT in my collection as my avatar here. No idea why. As usual, we have dark mode. Dark mode looks like that. A little bit nicer. I'm actually going to keep it like this. And the first panel we come across is this transfer panel.
00:04:19.386 - 00:05:02.042, Speaker A: This is really interesting because you can swap from the ETH network to binance, smart chain, avalanche, matic, arbitram, optimism and Phantom. This is a long way from being omnichain because obviously there are many more layer ones that you might want to swap to that are not represented here. I can think of Polkadot and Cosmos harmony, for instance. They're not represented here, but that's not to say they couldn't be in the future, and I would expect them to be as well. So the whole point of this is that using bridges and swapping over bridges is fraught with difficulties. It can be expensive and very, very slow, and there are a bunch of protocols aiming to solve this. You've got synapse, you've got hop connect as well.
00:05:02.042 - 00:05:41.830, Speaker A: This is aiming to do the swap from changer chain in the most elegant, simple, cheapest way possible. Now, we can look at some of the other things we've got going on here. The pooling. So you've got some pools here where you can pull USDC on different chains to add to the liquidity that is available across the network. And if you do that, then that will give you an LP token, which you can then farm. And there's some pretty attractive rates going on here. It's not massive, but probably better than simply getting rewards for putting USDC or something like that into a pool.
00:05:41.830 - 00:06:09.298, Speaker A: So again, we always look at anchor as the benchmark here. Anchor is around 19 and a half percent. So you're getting a pretty decent relative rate of return. Of course, it is variable as well, but across different networks. So if you have USDC on Phantom or an optimism, then you can just plug it straight in and off you go. Staking is coming and auction. Well, they basically auctioned off a bunch of STG tokens and you can redeem those here.
00:06:09.298 - 00:06:23.282, Speaker A: Nothing that exciting there. But this really is the secret sauce here. Transferring. So what I'm going to do now is literally do a transfer. We can go. What I'm going to do is something really ridiculous. So I'm going to bridge from phantom to optimism.
00:06:23.282 - 00:06:45.674, Speaker A: USDC, as you can see here, my balance is $3.21. I'm going to bridge $2 and that's it. I'm going to confirm the transfer. I need to switch to Phantom. Confirm that transaction. Your assets are on the way and should arrive in 36 seconds. 36 seconds.
00:06:45.674 - 00:07:16.162, Speaker A: If you've ever used a bridge before, you will know that it is pretty slow. It's not the experience that you want. Now, this is not fast, it's not instantaneous, but I can continue talking to you and telling you all sorts of exciting, naughty stuff. While that does that, one other thing I wanted to show you. Down here at the bottom of the main page, you got a transfer gas estimator. So it gives you basically an idea of what it would cost to transfer from one network to another. As you can see, anything from Ethereum is more expensive.
00:07:16.162 - 00:07:44.590, Speaker A: But the one we were doing, phantom to optimism, pretty damn cheap. Let's come back. It's just finishing up your assets on the way and should arrive any minute now. It really doesn't take very long. Remember, we're moving from phantom to optimism. Completely different chains, completely different networks and should be done. I wanted to do this in real time, just to prove how fast it was, because it really is quite fast.
00:07:44.590 - 00:08:02.350, Speaker A: Maybe if you put it into dart mode, it'll speed it up. But when I did this earlier, it was about a minute and a half. All in. Let's see if it takes any longer time than that. I want to do this in real time. Come on, you can do it. There we go.
00:08:02.350 - 00:08:46.346, Speaker A: That transaction is confirmed. So if I now switch to optimism, I will see in my assets that I have. There we go. So I actually did a test of this transfer earlier, and I had $2 that I transferred in, but there you can see, I now have $4, or just under $4, and that arrived really, really quickly. Now, I think if you're moving from Ethereum to another network, it'll be considerably slower. But if you're not on Ethereum and you're dancing around these other less heavy chains, you could do all sorts of things very quickly. And now, why would you want to do that? Well, I was basically looking at these farms and thinking, well, maybe I want to move some USDC onto, I mean, take advantage of the optimism farm here.
00:08:46.346 - 00:09:13.202, Speaker A: Then how quickly could I do that? And the answer is, very, very quickly indeed. And very, very inexpensively as well. So you'd be able to chase the best return across the different pools with relative ease, relative speed, and pretty cheaply as well. And that's obviously what you want to be doing in defi. You don't want to be held up by the constipation of the chain. And that's why this is so interesting. It's really, really fast and really, really cheap, and it's really, really simple.
00:09:13.202 - 00:09:23.862, Speaker A: And that's what we've been waiting for, for this cross chain piping to really step up and be something that's actually usable. We're not there yet, but this is a very good step along the way.
00:09:23.916 - 00:09:24.966, Speaker B: One other thing I wanted to point.
00:09:24.988 - 00:09:49.006, Speaker A: You to is this walkthrough mode. So if you walk through in the walkthrough mode, it will literally walk you through how to do it. And it's a very nice system for doing that. Highly recommend checking Stargate out. There's a huge amount of interest in this one huge number of developers building on it. Layer zero really caught my eye last year because I thought it was a really elegant solution to the cross chain problem.
00:09:49.108 - 00:09:49.726, Speaker B: But that's it.
00:09:49.748 - 00:10:01.462, Speaker A: That's Stargate. That's just literally a starter tutorial for you to get your lips wet on the juicy, moist flesh. That is the start. I don't know what I'm talking about. But anyway, you get the picture. There.
00:10:01.516 - 00:10:02.310, Speaker B: That's it for today.
00:10:02.380 - 00:10:07.190, Speaker A: Any suggestions for tutorials, drop them in the comments below and I'll see you on the next one. Peace.
