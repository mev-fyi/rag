00:00:00.490 - 00:00:38.486, Speaker A: Drama, drama, drama. It wouldn't be a blockchain Monday without some red blooded action. And today it's EIP 1559, though not some forgotten German Prague rock band, but an Ethereum improvement proposal designed to provide wallets and users a much needed improvement to the user experience of gas management. Knowing how much to spend on gas in order to pay for one's transactions is a giant pain in everyone's butterins. EIP, initially proposed is by Yaboy Vitalik back in April 2019. Advocates burning most of the transaction fees given to miners and unsurprisingly, has been heavily supported by developers. But would you believe it, some miners just don't like it one bit.
00:00:38.486 - 00:01:34.714, Speaker A: Notably Flex Pool, a moderately small mining pool which decided, well, Flex was what was required and got all up in the grill of those proposing their proposal. And they did what all good conscientious opposing voices do and set up a propaganda campaign, hashtag stop EIp one five nine. With strong language like Ethereum, developers initially needed miners for their coin, but once successful, they've thrown them under the bus. Eleven pools have now swung in behind the campaign to support hardworking Ethereum miners, and in time honored fashion, of course, a counterpropaganda website has now sprung up, hashtag support EIP 1559. And there you can find a delightfully awkward litany of hat and baggery between the two parties. Flexpool has also continued to speak out of both sides of their mouths as of the last 30 minutes, again continuing with the pity card. Now look, it's classic crypto governance posturing and putting the sarcasm to one side.
00:01:34.714 - 00:02:18.310, Speaker A: It does kind of remind me of all the finger wagging that accompanied the adoption of Segwit on bitcoin a few years back. Now, if you're interested in following along, there will be a community call on the 26 February, which will include flexible and should be unmissable popcorn entertainment for almost nobody, I expect, because I don't think anybody really cares. Still fun, though, to watch smart people bicker like cats. Compromise required. But will we find it? After all, if a country as enlightened and distinguished as the UK can leave Europe so elegantly, surely can all just get along. That's it for today.
