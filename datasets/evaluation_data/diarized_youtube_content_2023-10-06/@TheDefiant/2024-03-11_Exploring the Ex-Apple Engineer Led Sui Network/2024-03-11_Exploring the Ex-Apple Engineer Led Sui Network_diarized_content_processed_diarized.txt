00:00:04.410 - 00:00:15.646, Speaker A: Here we are with Evan. Evan Chang is a co founder and CEO of Misten Labs, which develops the Sui blockchain. Evan, thank you so much for joining me here at the defined podcast. Welcome.
00:00:15.828 - 00:00:18.094, Speaker B: Thank you. I'm very excited to be here.
00:00:18.292 - 00:00:57.034, Speaker A: Great. Well, excited to have you here. Sui has really kind of broken through the noise this year. Of course, there's many different layer one chains, but the suite, TVL and token has really taken off, surpassing many other layer ones recently. So I'm excited to hear what makes Sui different. The founding story, what kind of development and use cases you're seeing on the chain, all of that stuff. So let's start at the beginning.
00:00:57.034 - 00:01:06.850, Speaker A: I'd love to hear first your own background and then what led you to start Suey.
00:01:07.590 - 00:01:51.150, Speaker B: Yes. So I've been in tech for, I think about 26 years now. I spent ten years at Apple, built some of the very core technology that power software and many hardware devices across the world. Pretty much my software is the foundation on every smart device out there. On iPhones and Android phones, everybody uses my software. You probably heard Solana also use ALVM, which know my main work back at Apple Days. So I've always been very interested in kind of developer platforms, tooling for them, program language, all those areas.
00:01:51.150 - 00:02:42.430, Speaker B: My interest has always been some more foundational technology that have a lot of kind of deliver a lot of impacts to developers. So that's relevant because that's my view about blockchain as well. These are ultimately developer platform that empower developer to build new type of applications and products. It's very different than what we are used to today. These days, if you're using any of the platforms, TikTok, Instagram, you name it, it's sort of a custodial model. Each one is a silo. You basically are sort of giving them permission to sort of use your information, use your assets.
00:02:42.430 - 00:03:35.940, Speaker B: In the future, we believe it's going to be a more less decentralized world where applications can sort of coordinate among themselves and the coordination is done through the consumer themselves having complete control of the assets and the information. They can sort of give permission. Right. So if you understand that model, sort of you understand kind of what we're building towards. And that's a lot where I came know I work at Apple, then followed by my time at Facebook. It's always about sort of at the forefront of developer experience, tooling, language, everything. And I work at this company that's very much the leader of the current centralized web two world.
00:03:35.940 - 00:04:27.246, Speaker B: They know how to serve their developer they know how to serve the customer. But it's a model that in my view I have always feel like society would demand a different model. The social trend will want something with consumer more in control. Not saying one is right or wrong, but that's just how things tend to shift from one end to another. We go from highly decentralized or peer to peer Internet back when it started, to more centralized model. Custody of information make things more convenient, having networking effect, network effect means it's more efficient in distribution of content or information. There has a lot of positive about it, but there's also a lot of downside.
00:04:27.246 - 00:05:19.154, Speaker B: So we're going to see the shift. So for me, I always want to do something about it. I want to help build that developer infrastructure, that platform that empowers this new type application. And I believe that's the great opportunity in the coming decades. So that's sort of a lot of my background. So obviously Facebook was kind of running R D for the Libra project and that was exciting period of time, learned a lot, we built a lot. We also somewhat left unsatisfied because in hindsight we felt like it was more of a product for Facebook and less of a platform.
00:05:19.154 - 00:06:07.294, Speaker B: And part of it is just the scale of Facebook and sort of incorporating feedback of the government's regulators, parties. We just didn't quite understand. So giving example, we were talking about financial inclusion. And even for financial inclusion, we're thinking about government having opportunity to potentially reaching millions of their citizens through some kind of sending them monies. G two C. And we learned how difficult is to using blockchain is insufficient. It's one thing to be able to if there's already direct connection, it's much easier.
00:06:07.294 - 00:06:47.774, Speaker B: But given that bootstrapping the onboarding experience is very difficult. The difficulty of having all those assets living on chain at one time, you have to deal with all the complexity, storing things on chain. We learned a lot, right? Those things turned out having a traditional blockchain was insufficient to solve this kind of problem. So when the opportunity came along for my co founder and I to start missing lab, we just took the chance and we said, okay, let's take our learning and let's build something very different and with this sort of asset centric view in mind.
00:06:47.972 - 00:08:04.310, Speaker A: Super interesting stuff. I want to touch on a couple of points that you made. The first is just how remarkable it is that you were at developing for probably the epitome of centralized web two. Right. Like Apple is known to be very centralized, very much a closed garden, probably the most closed ecosystem there is so pretty much opposite to blockchains and then Facebook, obviously together with Google and Amazon, the reason why Web two is so centralized. So, yeah, I think it's just very, I don't know, funny, I guess that you came from these companies and then learned about blockchain inside of Facebook now meta and just wanted to, after Libra didn't pan out, you were inspired enough by this vision that you went off and wanted to start your own blockchain. I think that's just a really interesting path.
00:08:04.310 - 00:08:32.698, Speaker A: I'm curious to hear your thoughts because you were so much at the core of web two. What about this system you think should be changed? I mean, why do you think this system no longer works for society currently and that a new kind of blockchain based web3 would be better?
00:08:32.884 - 00:09:00.054, Speaker B: Yeah, like anything, right? So technology paradigm shifts over time. Why Ms. Change? Well, it's getting to the point. It's very hard for new players to challenge the established players. It's getting harder and harder. Right? We've seen this, the fantastic what if five these days they get bigger and bigger. Right.
00:09:00.054 - 00:09:58.566, Speaker B: These companies have accumulated more power. It's harder to crack, it's compete. Right. When there's less competition, it's generally bad for consumer because you're stuck. And I think some of the potential downsides are hard to quantify, right. When policy changes such as Apple with a privacy policy change doesn't allow cross app tracking, probably intention is good and probably do some good for consumer, but for advertising for advertisers becomes a big challenge, right? All of a sudden you don't understand how to target your ads and the cost of acquiring customer increases and that will have downside impact on small medium businesses. These things are very hard to quantify.
00:09:58.566 - 00:10:26.498, Speaker B: It's not right or wrong. It's just sort of general trend. Right. Once you get to Max centralization, it's inevitable there is going to be a push to the other direction and couple that with a general distrust in institution. And I think this is something we can all agree, right. The world is getting to the point where that trust is not there anymore. So those combination creates an opportunity.
00:10:26.498 - 00:10:57.770, Speaker B: Right. You kind of can't trust big institution, big companies. At the same time you are sort of almost powerless. You have to use them because they are everywhere. You rely on them so much. And in general people will seek alternative. And what we're seeing with the younger generation, with some more, the progressive kind of builders, they want to have more, be their own boss, right? The rise of the creator economy, people want to have more control of their destiny.
00:10:57.770 - 00:11:45.470, Speaker B: They don't want to work for a big company. And that's definitely a trend. Even a lot of other, what we've seen in fashion, in art, collaboration across different company, different brands, mixing IPs is something people are definitely interested in because it's unique. If you can build something that uniquely represents even the customers or the artists, that's powerful. Those social trends and just the need for competitive advantage is a reason why we're talking about decentralized applications. And I think we believe this trend will continue, will gather momentum.
00:11:45.810 - 00:12:05.442, Speaker A: Awesome. And then the other question I wanted to ask from your background is you mentioned you took the lessons from Libra to build Sui. So what are the main lessons that you took away from that experience?
00:12:05.576 - 00:12:59.206, Speaker B: Yeah, first of all, the developer experience with blockchains were suboptimal. When you're thinking about, I think if you think from first principle, you understand public blockchain, like Sui, is for coordination, and coordination through assets. You want to allow developer and consumer to say, this is my asset that lives on chain, and I can coordinate between multiple services, say, okay, you get to use my information here. You use my information, but I own my identity. I own my asset. Then you realize the developer model, sort of programming model of the blockchains doesn't really map it well. And that's the fundamental driver of understanding of what we want to do.
00:12:59.206 - 00:13:50.626, Speaker B: And knowing that we realize we want to have assets as the first class citizen on the blockchain. And we kind of have a concept how to take, understanding, how to take the move programming language, which we designed and built at Facebook. How do we change that model to fit what we want? But then we run into other difficulty with the blockchain. How you store data is one problem. You probably know before suite, all the blockchain is limitation in what they can, the amount of information data they can store on chain. It's very expensive. There's some redundancy, there's some bad kind of design there that sort of carry on from earlier days that makes that very limited.
00:13:50.626 - 00:14:20.878, Speaker B: And that's very fundamental, because if you think about it, we're going into the world where humans are constantly interacting with software. You have an asset. You are basically empowering software to manage it for you in some way. And pretty soon we're going to probably going to see software just have an interaction as well. So these things are intelligent. These assets are intelligent. They're almost like autonomous in some way, making decisions or incorporating changes over time.
00:14:20.878 - 00:14:42.166, Speaker B: And you need to empower it. If you are saying I'm holding all the information that are necessary that describe what the asset is off chain, you're fundamentally limiting what it can do. Right. And you're basically reintroducing human in the loop. You're reintroducing centralization in loop. Right. You're going away from the decentralized application model.
00:14:42.166 - 00:14:59.770, Speaker B: So once we understand all these, it's just. Okay, now we understand we need to build something have somewhat very different requirement from all the blockchain that live before. Okay, let's go actually design it from the ground up and see what we can come up with. And the result was three.
00:14:59.840 - 00:15:45.034, Speaker A: Interesting. And that's a great segue to the next question I have, which is with so many layer one blockchains, what makes sui special, what makes it different? Especially with comparing to Aptos, which I mentioned, we recently had their co founder on the podcast, and there's very similarities between you two. You're both using move, you both came from the Facebook Libra experience. So, yeah. What makes you guys special compared to Aptos and to all the other layer ones?
00:15:45.152 - 00:16:15.640, Speaker B: Yeah. As I alluded to earlier, we want to have a very different model. It's an asset centric blockchain because we believe what we want is sort of frictionless global coordination that sue intelligent asset. Right. What I mean by intelligent assets is assets can make decision ourselves, can enforce rules around them. The model is very different. The programming model, the data model, everything is very different.
00:16:15.640 - 00:17:11.954, Speaker B: And that doesn't really work well in sort of the classic kind of layer one model in terms of how they program. So everything is very different from that point on. We talk about the ability to store information on chain, and every asset is an object with full encapsulation, and you can compose assets. Right. So that's another aspect that's very different about suite. While everybody is talking about composability, alluding to the ability for protocols to interact with other protocols, composing many as a chain, we have to also think about asset composability. If you think about in the real world, everything is composable.
00:17:11.954 - 00:17:53.102, Speaker B: I have this glass that has water, right? These are two actually assets composed into one, an empty glass with water. These are two assets composed into one. And if you model everything in the world, that's how the world works as well. To enable all that, we have just fundamentally very different data model. And the transaction processing pipeline, even the move programming language is quite different because of that. Also in terms of transaction, while everybody's sort of talking about what we need to focus a lot on scalability. We're saying scalability should be table stick.
00:17:53.102 - 00:18:32.926, Speaker B: If you want to use infrastructure at a global scale, you need to basically ensure you never run out capacity, right? Don't talk about scalability, talk about elasticity. Meaning if you have increased demand, you have increased supply to meet that, and then you have predictability in terms of cost. So it's a lot of different design principle. So yes, people confuse us with aptos all the time. The difference is very clear. Aptos is based on DN core, which is open source by Facebook. The Libra project, we built everything from the ground up.
00:18:32.926 - 00:19:16.570, Speaker B: We designed the move language. We designed different variant of move language using this more sort of asset centric in the programming language terms, it's more object oriented like with some functional aspects as well. So every aspect is basically redesigned from the ground up. And we also focus a lot on the layers above a blockchain. All the primitives allow solving problems around kind of onboarding experience, the ease of creating assets that can enforce rules. These things are very important. You're probably aware the story about NFTs.
00:19:16.570 - 00:19:50.300, Speaker B: The marketplace decided to drop enforcement of royalty. That's an example where you essentially humans corrupt the intention of software. The software was designed with intention of delivering royalty payments. But human, which is the marketplace, decide to drop that for their own benefit. We are about creating a platform that allow the asset to be intelligent, where these rules, once it's baked in, they cannot be circumvented by human. So all these things are very different.

00:20:37.404 - 00:21:17.422, Speaker A: When you talk about an asset centric blockchain and storing assets on chain, I understand all blockchains do this, right? That's what chains are about, having at least like a native token and having that be a part of the economic system of how the chain works. So can you explain a little bit more about in practice, what does being an asset centric blockchain mean? What can you do that you can't do on other chains.
00:21:17.566 - 00:21:55.454, Speaker B: Blockchain actually store the transaction records on chain. A lot of information. The data about the underlying asset actually don't necessarily live on chain. Nft ERC 721 is an example of this. In most cases, you store the JPEG off chain on some other storage mechanism for cost saving reasons. But think about beyond that, right? All these standards basically keep very little information on chin. And the information also sometimes are hard to mutate them because it's, again, very costly.
00:21:55.454 - 00:22:53.086, Speaker B: So this is like one fundamental understanding here is what makes an asset is not just the JPEG, right? It's about all the information relevant to it, how much you want to. What about the rules around them? So for suite, you can basically store arbitrary amount of information on chain. If you want to describe, say, not JPEG RPG game, you're probably familiar with it. A hero has all this information about them, their race and maybe their intelligence, their strengths and the experience point. These are assets. These are information that makes that asset together. And we want to empower these things to be stored on chain.
00:22:53.086 - 00:23:15.750, Speaker B: They can be mutated on chain. They can be composed. A hero acquiring a magic sword. All of a sudden you're composing two assets together. So these things are really not easily doable with other blockchains because the programming model, because their data model, and also because the cost that's associated with storing information on chain.
00:23:15.830 - 00:23:36.526, Speaker A: I see. Okay. So the big difference is that Sui makes it, I guess, cheaper, easier to store arbitrary amounts of information about an asset on chain. So that gives more predictability to how these assets works and makes them more composable.
00:23:36.638 - 00:24:14.250, Speaker B: Make them composable is a big part of it. And also enforcing rules is other parts of it. We have created a kiosk standard that you can imagine sort of like a kiosk you see in a shopping mall. Right. You put things there, and if you buy it off of it, then automatically the royalty payments are guaranteed, handled by the software by smart contract. You don't have to rely on marketplace to decide whether you enforce the rules or not. Same thing with a closed circuit standard, coin standard that allows restrictions.
00:24:14.250 - 00:24:46.722, Speaker B: Right. The way you think about is a permission asset on top of a permission list platform. So there's a lot of sort of differences. Yes. In theory, you can build everything on any kind of programming language platform, programming platform. But if your platform isn't sort of designed to support that model, it's going to make things very difficult. And that's one of the main kind of design criteria when we design the suite.
00:24:46.786 - 00:25:11.466, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay. And then hopefully without getting too technical, but the main reason why this is possible or easier on suite, is it because you're using this modified version of the move language, or is there also aspects of your consensus mechanism or other things involved in making this feasible?
00:25:11.658 - 00:25:56.990, Speaker B: The most important thing is the data model. So basically, how you store this information on the blockchain. So most of the blockchains sort of don't have a good separation between the transaction records as well as the data they store. So everything is kept on. Everything sort of have a massive amount of overhead when you store on the blockchain. For us, the data model is, this is not a blockchain where you think about in terms of smart contracts and sort of this kind of a file based data model, address based model. Each of the objects is distinct.
00:25:56.990 - 00:26:52.430, Speaker B: Basically, it's a global sort of a database of all these objects, each one representing an asset that allow us to use conventional means to scale storage on chain. So, yeah, I'm trying not to go into all the details here, but every aspect of the processing pipeline going through consensus execution and also storing the resulting state changes on chain, how we handle the data, the storage that's associated with the assets are all completely different. Complex system like this, every aspect has to sort of support each other. You kind of want to leverage the characteristic of each of the different components so they work well, harmoniously.
00:26:53.110 - 00:27:11.720, Speaker A: Makes sense because all of these objects are distinct. Would sui be classified as a modular chain? You know, there's like this big trend about modular chains. I don't know if Sui would be a part of that.
00:27:12.170 - 00:27:55.060, Speaker B: Every piece of large scale software should be modular by design. And I think modular chains are more of a design to be used, each one as a component. But for us, our belief is it's for a different target audience. Right. So module chains are used for other infrastructure builder to sort of taking data availability part taking different consensus module, all these things to create their own chain. We are targeting developers that want to build applications. The way we think about it is very different.
00:27:55.060 - 00:28:27.710, Speaker B: We'll see. We believe we can achieve scalability and a lot of modular sort of theory behind thesis behind the modular blockchain is that's the way you scale blockchain. We fundamentally don't believe that. We believe we have architecture that actually can scale without any issue whatsoever. You don't want to kind of present so much complexity to a developer that should just be focusing on building applications.
00:28:28.130 - 00:28:50.230, Speaker A: I see. No, it's definitely a valid viewpoint. And speaking of building applications, recently the suite TVL total value locked crossed 500 million. So yeah. Interested in what are the applications and use cases that's driving this growth?
00:28:51.130 - 00:29:42.726, Speaker B: The d five ecosystem is definitely taking off. If you pay attention to the numbers, recent weeks is between 556 hundred and we'll probably get back there above 600 very soon. The number you actually should look at apart from TVL is the transaction volume. So our transaction volume was actually leading the TVL growth and it was in the top ten overall chance a while ago. And that means it's a healthy defi ecosystem because you can actually fake TVL rather easily by putting a lot of sort of assets into protocols, but placing outside the range to be used. What we want to see is healthy growth in TVO and healthy growth in transaction volume. And both those are happening.
00:29:42.726 - 00:30:39.980, Speaker B: And the reason is, well guess what? We have builders that are building better products and traders are using these DeFi protocols to make more money with some features that suite has program transaction block, you can basically chain a lot of activities together into one atomic block and you execute, then iterate on them without writing smart contract. You can do it on the client side. So people are figuring out how to sort of do this composability at a d five protocol level. And that allowed them to do some pretty powerful thing. We had one day, we still don't know who did it. There was one bot that did 400 million transaction volume in one day. Probably somebody just tested out writing some of these sort of bots to do that.
00:30:39.980 - 00:31:20.454, Speaker B: When you see something that's growing healthy, like the suite DeFi ecosystem, it's because usually the reason behind it is simple. People are building developer, building better product, and the users are making more money or getting better experience. We have another project called Bluefin that's not part of TVL because of derivative platform. And they also up there in terms of over daily transaction volume, I think it's in the top five among some of the most used protocols out there.
00:31:20.572 - 00:31:27.126, Speaker A: Got it. Okay, so it's mostly finance like Defi related apps that's driving this.
00:31:27.228 - 00:31:51.440, Speaker B: Yeah, well, TVL is mostly driven by those. Yeah, DeFi is definitely the first one on suite to sort of cross that chasm to be sort of a reach product market fit and scoring healthily and other kind of vertical, other kind of applications are catching up as well.
00:31:52.470 - 00:32:14.294, Speaker A: Interested to hear more about these experiments. I guess you said DeFi developers are building on SUI. You mentioned something about using kind of this composability aspect to make some interesting applications. Can you give me a couple of.
00:32:14.332 - 00:33:05.910, Speaker B: Examples yeah, obviously composability, especially in DeFi, has been talked about for a long time. And if you ever use these protocols, you also know a lot of times limited right to be composable, they kind of have to agree on some kind of common standard, have some agreement between them for them to follow. Same standard to be used together. Three, allow permissionless composability at both asset level, but also at the protocol level because the program transaction block allow you to chain these things together. As long as enough of the protocols functionality are exposed, you can just sort of do it without their permission. Right. That's the whole point of permissionless.
00:33:05.910 - 00:33:50.086, Speaker B: So that is very powerful. And developer experimenting how we do these things or do some kind of flash loan type of kind of bots, this is a very common thing. But what we're seeing is they really don't need to coordinate too much ahead of time to enable this happening. And also the possibility of doing this, composing this transaction into a block on the client side without you need to write a smart contract without need to generate move code is a very powerful feature that other platform don't support quite as well as we do.
00:33:50.108 - 00:34:11.260, Speaker A: You think that the fact that you're using move, will that be a limitation for existing DeFi apps in other blockchains, say on Ethereum or Solana or other popular ecosystems for them to also deploy on Sui because they'll have to kind of build things over?
00:34:11.950 - 00:35:09.630, Speaker B: No, no, we're not really seeing that. Yes, it is easier to say taking existing Solidico and fork it on another evn chain, but that over time just fragments your liquidity because you have a lot of duplication of essentially the same protocol, all these chains that they're not really easily interoperable. In theory you could, but in reality each of the l two are sort of separate, for example. And what we're hearing from the developer is they love move. Then we believe, for example, Sri Lank they came from Solana, right? Solan, it's one of the biggest lending protocol there they came over three, they have come out and say because on Salana using Ross is kind of like chewing glass. On Sui is like chewing puree. It's a very different experience.
00:35:09.630 - 00:35:35.960, Speaker B: It's ten X better. They say that developer experience. So yes, there is a learning curve initially, but once you overcome that learning curve, the productivities of developers are actually much higher. We think this is healthy because this allow them to build better products rather than forking existing product and maybe tweaking it.
00:35:36.570 - 00:36:35.398, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good point. Maybe it takes a bit longer to do, but potentially the products that do get built are more original because they're done with a bit more intention than just creating a fork. Speaking of DeFi more broadly, you talked about how people are using these Defi apps to make money. And it's something that I've been watching and waiting for it to happen that DeFi connects more with. Just like the productive world. I don't know, people will say kind of the real world, but I think blockchains are very much real. But call it just like the productive everyday economy of just like earning a salary, taking a loan, getting a loan to invest in your business, or to buy a house, and not to take leverage to buy more crypto.
00:36:35.398 - 00:36:41.322, Speaker A: Right. So what do you think is missing for DeFi to actually make that jump?
00:36:41.386 - 00:37:49.330, Speaker B: Yeah, we think sort of finance world in sort of three categories. Broadly, there's an onchain finance that we call DeFi, where everything's on chain, but there is a lot of friction for consumer because you have to essentially tokenize your asset, your fiat money, into stablecoin or other tokens. And then you can interact with this Defi protocol and there's other frictions. How do you get on board it? Do you need to acquire tokens to deal with gas? You have to deal with wallets and all that. It's fairly non intuitive to a lot of normies, so to speak. Then what we want to do is consumer finance. How do you use these technologies to empower consumer finances? And then finally in the future, maybe the more institution finance will utilize blockchain as well, rather than doing it in sort of private chains or permission chain as something doing right now, all are moving or are still having a lot of limitations.
00:37:49.330 - 00:39:10.230, Speaker B: So the things we have done is we're solving a lot of onboarding kind of issues with zk logging. Allow you to sign, not just sign in, sign on, but allow you to utilize application with your social logging and basically manage your credential in a way that's more familiar to normal people, but still maintain the privacy, still maintain the self custodial sort of model. And that's crucial. And have sponsored transaction means you can jump into using these protocols, potentially without dealing with gas. If you ever downloading a mobile app, you understand this, you don't have to say, okay, do I have some changes here to pay for gas or some kind of cost in using this app? So we have built the primitives and product builders are taking advantage of those. And it's somewhat different kind of experience. Consumer finance is sort of next sort of frontier for using blockchain.
00:39:10.230 - 00:40:18.850, Speaker B: If you think about a cross border payments, we know there are people benefiting from having stablecoin and using it as a replacement for kind of the traditional cross border payment solutions. But you still have the friction of on rampant off ramp. These things again needs to be solved. And also in emerging market, if you want to say you can imagine some kind of point of sales kind of transaction, consumer paying for something, what if you have bad connectivity, right? And you mentioned one thing we talked about is forecast. We sort of talk about internetless transactions. This is why these sort of technology are very crucial. Basically it's solving all these friction at the edges, what is going to required to empower the next generation of consumer finance products.
00:40:18.850 - 00:40:46.010, Speaker B: And we believe we have a lot of solution there and do so in a way that's still regulatory compliant. That's going to be important, still safe and secure. These are sort of table stakes. We cannot afford to have more large scale hacks and other kinds of issues that sort of scare people away from utilizing blockchains.
00:40:46.830 - 00:40:54.720, Speaker A: So for you, do you think it's mostly a Ux UI problem?
00:40:55.570 - 00:42:07.246, Speaker B: Well, people think about it's a Ux UI problem, but it's much more than skin deep, right. If you think in UX is sort of external facing to solve this kind of problem without reintroducing centralization is a big part. Again, I use the NFT secondary sales as an example. Well that was the example of reintroducing centralization because the marketplace was a centralization agent here and they can decide, you know what, I'm not going to enforce royalty payment because that increase the transaction volume is good for me. Anytime you take that very easy solutions by reintroducing centralization that you lose, something bad happens. We saw what happens in the loss cycle. A lot of these sort of applications that aggregating sort of off front end to defi allow people to put that money in like Voyager as one example, right? And take that money and then deploy in DeFi protocol and supposed to pass the yield back to the consumer.
00:42:07.246 - 00:42:44.002, Speaker B: Turns out they didn't really take the money and do what they supposed to do. They put in lots and lots of risky kind of products and the whole thing fell apart. So solving these kind of problems actually take very deep technology solutions and it's not as simple as say just ux. Apple is famous for this, right? Their product, seamless gray, feels like butter is because everything is built to support that function, supports that possibility, right?
00:42:44.056 - 00:42:56.342, Speaker A: It's like okay. The user sees a better experience, but that's because there's a lot of technical work, deep work behind it that allows that to happen.
00:42:56.396 - 00:43:17.894, Speaker B: Right. Think about it. Pretty soon we're going to demonstrate internetless transaction. Maybe go out in the middle of nowhere. You can imagine. Maybe you can play a Pokemon type of game in a place where there's no Internet. You can capture that Pokemon and that's on the blockchain.
00:43:17.894 - 00:43:31.342, Speaker B: Or you can do a point sales payment without great connection. That will seem like a UX problem, but solution, but it's deep technology underneath it.
00:43:31.476 - 00:44:05.450, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Do you think that with bitcoin crossing its previous all time high very recently, it really does seem like we're starting a new bull market. Do you think it's these types of applications what will be driving the next bull? Do you think it will be defi focused? Last bull run, it was all about NFTs. What do you think is going to bring in the next wave of users?
00:44:05.870 - 00:44:41.666, Speaker B: Yeah, I think in a bull market, everything goes. We're seeing that in the past. I think the way we are thinking about it is how do you get beyond this bow and bust cycle? You see this happening all the time. Bull market get more users to come in. That's great. People are making money, speculation, and they stick around for a while until a bear market and you see the users drop. Not even the token price drop.
00:44:41.666 - 00:45:13.470, Speaker B: You see the user drop. How do we overcome that? If as an industry you can deliver actual value impact to the world, that won't be the case. If you have a technology product you depend on, it's not going to matter to the consumer whether it's a bull market or bear market. They're just going to keep using the product. So we care. We're obviously watching the market cycle. Things changes dramatically in the bull market.
00:45:13.470 - 00:45:37.880, Speaker B: More people trying it, that's all great. But it's also about how do you capture these users so they become lifelong users and not just they only here for the right. And that's very important for us. So we focus a lot on the long term. Also be aware of what the kind of near term market condition and what we need to do to capture the opportunity.
00:45:40.350 - 00:46:11.646, Speaker A: For sure. And then related to that. Right now there's a lot of focus on incentive programs with tokens. Wondering whether you guys have anything like that. With sui, you haven't done an airdrop that I know of. I don't know if that's something that you're planning or just like a more general incentive program for people who want to earn your token.
00:46:11.758 - 00:46:49.040, Speaker B: Yeah. The incentive program is basically acquiring customer. Every product, doesn't matter if web two, web3, every product that want to get going. Solving the costar problem is common to have some kind of incentive program to acquire customer. We're working with a lot of different products and services to do that, to help them do that. So you may not see a sort of traditional airdrop of suite because we're way past main net launch anyway. And it's also a question of how sticky that is.
00:46:49.040 - 00:47:30.750, Speaker B: But we definitely have a lot of things going on right now. If people are paying attention to the three ecosystem, they will see there's a lot of opportunity to be rewarded for trying out things and that we want to point people to, right. So one hand we want to remove all the friction for people to jump in and start playing around with three, and then we want to incentivize them to stick around or try new things, and that becomes part of their life, something they enjoy using and they stick around and we want to make them lifelong users. So, yeah, combination these efforts going young.
00:47:30.820 - 00:47:36.186, Speaker A: Okay, so what's the best way to learn about that and to start getting involved?
00:47:36.378 - 00:48:06.098, Speaker B: Well, I mean, go to sweet IO, go to follow sui network on Twitter. There are plenty of content, plenty of information out there about know follow. People who are being three OGs for a while. They are talking about their products. Right. If you're interested in Defi, you can talk about use scallop, you can use turbos, you can use navi, you can use bucket. All these different protocols.
00:48:06.098 - 00:48:29.502, Speaker B: If you're interested in gaming, we have like 80 some gaming in the pipeline. All them are launching. A lot of them are launching pretty soon. Some are very well known IPs as well. Love to see people kind of try them. We also already have run Legend, we have arcade champions, a lot of Cosmo. There's an Amno crossing game.
00:48:29.502 - 00:49:06.826, Speaker B: I forgot the name, exact name, Cosmo something topion or something. These are game either in beta Appendzer, they're games. Right. So sorry I can't remember the exact name. But if you go to follow us on the social media and on our website, you can discover this application. We believe that's the best way to get understand your suite or you want to buy fuddies, right? Is the NFTs. That's another way to interact with the community as well.
00:49:06.826 - 00:49:08.390, Speaker B: Lots and lots of opportunities.
00:49:08.550 - 00:49:24.578, Speaker A: Would you want there to be a focus of a specific use case on Sui? Do you see any specific use case having a competitive advantage on Sui rather than another?
00:49:24.744 - 00:50:16.820, Speaker B: No, I think we have technical and product competitive advantages across all the different product categories. Defi happened to be the first one to get to that point of product market fit because it's just a faster iteration kind of a space. But we're pretty sure gaming is going to take off big time in sui ecosystem. Like any point now as the games start to launch NFTs and social media type of deep in. That's something that's very concrete that a lot of people benefit from. We have several project launching all that are coming to suite because we want to build something better than what they can build on other platforms. So it's not one particular area.
00:50:16.820 - 00:50:58.634, Speaker B: And we believe there's going to be new product categories that people have. Maybe a combination of all these different elements or maybe just something we have never anticipate they will come out. And ultimately that's what we mean. This is a developer platform and the developers are the ones we care a lot about, right. Because we want to empower them to build great products for consumers. That's the way to go. We are very confident that's going to happen on street.
00:50:58.682 - 00:51:29.210, Speaker A: Interested in your just broader view on what the future blockchain ecosystem will look like and what Sui's role is there. Do you see a future where there's dozens of chains and they're all interoperable with bridges? Or do you see a future where it's like a handful of chains will end up capturing most of the use cases? Or will there be a single chain? What's your view there?
00:51:29.360 - 00:52:06.290, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a good question. Nobody really know for sure. And what we're believing in is growing the oversize of the pie and not worry too much about this small slice that currently exists. Right, because it's so early. Obviously there's a lot of China chains are built to be interoperable and have bridges between them. Evn chains are one example of those. Some of them are going to be more compatible with others.
00:52:06.290 - 00:52:45.810, Speaker B: Some are not really that compatible. Whether that becomes one big ecosystem or becomes a fragment, lots of different fragment ecosystems is somehow interoperable or not. It's not clear, but fragmentation is going to make things the user experience much worse. Liquidity also going to be fragmented. It's not good as well. So we believe power loss always play a role and there will be a few dominant ecosystems. Exactly what that number is and what they look like, surely to tell.
00:52:45.810 - 00:53:16.618, Speaker B: To be honest, nobody really know. What we do believe is given in a way like we have second mover advantage. We build suite. After learning about all the limitations of everything else. We're quite confident in our technology, in our product, in the differentiation, and we are already seeing the different kind of product, better products. We believe we will be one of the biggest one, if not the dominant one. How long that would take when that becomes reality, hard to say.
00:53:16.618 - 00:53:40.386, Speaker B: We got to do our job. We are working with so many different developers to empower them. But yeah, I think we'll be around for a long time. It's not possible for hundreds or thousands of ecosystem all prosper. It will be a relatively small number. Exactly what that number is, nobody really know at this point.
00:53:40.568 - 00:53:48.070, Speaker A: Makes sense. And then finally to wrap up, what are the next milestones for Sui like, what should we be looking forward to?
00:53:48.140 - 00:54:45.826, Speaker B: Well, in April 10 and eleven in Paris, we have Sui base camp where if you want to get the alpha, the latest about Sui evolution of the chain, we're going to talk about a lot of very exciting product launch, feature launches. That's where you're going to see all the things that we only hinting about right now. So that's the next major milestone. Over the next few days and weeks, there will be lots and lots of exciting product announcements and partnership announcements following along. Some of them will actually prove to the world that, yes, blockchain can do that. The things that people have been sort of dreaming about, hinting about will show actual proof of concept or actual products that show that's possible oftentimes with partners. So it's not one major milestone.
00:54:45.826 - 00:54:47.442, Speaker B: It's a continuous sets of milestones.
00:54:47.506 - 00:54:52.860, Speaker A: Can you give us a hint of one of those products that are like, wow, blockchain can do?
00:54:53.390 - 00:55:05.150, Speaker B: I mean, I think people have been thinking about traditional trading in stock exchanges and whatnot, and can blockchain do something about it? Stay tuned.
00:55:05.650 - 00:55:24.110, Speaker A: Interesting. All right, well, we'll definitely cover that on the defiant. And Evan, this was great. Really appreciate you taking the time. Super interesting chat and really glad we got to dive deep into, you know, great stuff. Appreciate it.
00:55:24.180 - 00:55:29.300, Speaker B: Thank you. Kimmela, our channel.
