00:00:02.730 - 00:00:36.294, Speaker A: Welcome back to the terminal tutorial series. In this video I'll show you how to create, use and arrange custom charts on the defiant terminal for a walkthrough on how to customize your very own profile of defiant dashboards. Watch the first video in this series. So to create a very simple chart tracking the price of Sushiswap, I'm going to go on my dashboards and I'm going to select the dashboard that I want to add my chart to. So I'll select DeFi lenders. Then I'll go to add chart and table and I'll create a new chart. So first I'm going to select the metrics that I'm most interested in, which is the price.
00:00:36.294 - 00:01:12.654, Speaker A: And then I get to select the asset that I'm interested in. I can type it in into the search bar, select Sushi. Now when I press create, I can give the chart a name. So I'm going to name it Sushi price and I can also edit the name of the data set in case I'm adding multiple sets of data. Press create and I save it. If I scroll all the way down to the bottom of my dashboard, I'll see my newly created simple chart has appeared. Now, as before, I can edit this in any way that I want to display the data the way that I want it to be displayed.
00:01:12.654 - 00:01:54.740, Speaker A: But what if I want to combine asset and protocol metrics in the same data set? I can also do that. So I scroll back up and I press add chart and table, create a new chart and I select the metrics the same way I did before. So this time I'm looking to compare the price of uniswap versus the number of trades on the protocol. So I select price and I select the asset, which is going to be uniswap save this and I create. Now I'm going to make two combinations of data sets. So it's important that I name them. So the first data set I will name uni price and then I go back and I add a selection of the second data set.
00:01:54.740 - 00:02:37.790, Speaker A: So I again select the metrics and that's going to be the trade count I save. And the protocol is again, uniswap save. And again it's important to name the data set. I create it. Now I have to give my chart a title, unique price versus trade count. When I press create and I scroll all the way down, I see this new chart has been created with a combination of my two data sets combining asset and protocol metrics in the same chart. Now in the next video, I'm going to create custom tables and add them to my personalized dashboard.
00:02:37.790 - 00:02:42.620, Speaker A: Close.
