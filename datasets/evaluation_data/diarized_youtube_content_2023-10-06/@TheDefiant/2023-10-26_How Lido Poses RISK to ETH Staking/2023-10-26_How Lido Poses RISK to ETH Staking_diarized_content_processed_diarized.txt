00:00:00.170 - 00:00:39.810, Speaker A: Why are people so concerned about this? There are individual staker risks, and then there are protocol wide risks. One of the main things for me is that controlling over 30% of the stake, first of all, you can control finality, so you could essentially hold the chain hostage at that point. The other thing is, on a per person or per staker perspective, Lido. At the moment, each node operator, they have 1% of the stake. That's an awful lot of stake to be on. One node operator, one node operator fails, takes down 1% of Ethereum, they get slashed horrendously, and all of that gets passed on to the consumer or the staker.
