00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:04.370 - 00:00:42.934, Speaker B: Welcome to the Defiant. I'm your host, Tagan Klein. Today I'm joined by Mustafa, CEO and co founder of Celestia Labs. 15 years after Satoshi, we finally have what a blockchain actually is. Celestia provides the ability to publish data and make sure that data is available. Celestia had what many are calling one of the best launches of 2023 and they are the first data availability layer live. Today we get into how Mustafa built Celestia, other data availability layers in the space, how Celestia can be thought of as a bulletin board for computers with some cryptographic and economic assurances.
00:00:42.934 - 00:01:10.530, Speaker B: So computers posting info so everyone can see it, it's so simple. It's an obvious fundamental building block, yet they were the first to do it. Prior to Celestia, Mustafa was generally known for his expertise in ethical hacking. He hacked the US government at the age of 16 and was sentenced for it. We get into this and so much more. But first to ground the conversation Mustafa shares. What do you focus on at Celestia today?
00:01:10.600 - 00:01:38.918, Speaker A: My day to day involves lots of different things. I sometimes participate in the research, engineering, sometimes more like marketing, but ultimately I'm an engineer by heart. That's where I kind of started out. And we're a very kind of like technical team. And yeah, I started Celestia as part of my, which was formerly known as Laseledger as part of my PhD at UCL when I was focusing on layer one scaling.
00:01:39.014 - 00:01:45.598, Speaker C: Amazing. And you have a long history in crypto. Can you tell us a little bit about that history and what really attracted you to the space?
00:01:45.764 - 00:02:41.226, Speaker A: Sure. So I was kind of always very interested in peer to peer systems from an early, like, before bitcoin was around. I was interested in peer to peer file sharing systems like Bittorrent. Back in the day, before Netflix was popular, people used to kind of illegally download copyrighted films and software from websites like the pirate bay using decentralized or peer to peer file sharing systems. I kind of thought that was really cool. It was really cool that there was like, because a lot of websites at the time were centralized and this was like a decentralized system that basically allowed people to circumvent kind of like copyright laws effectively and download, get access to software or movies or videos they would otherwise not have access to easily. And back before Netflix existed, BitTorrent, which was the peer to peer file sharing system that everyone used, actually handled like half of the Internet's traffic.
00:02:41.226 - 00:03:44.770, Speaker A: And so it was like a very kind of scalable system. And so I was kind of like thinking a lot about what other ways can we decentralize the Internet? Because to me, Bittorrent was a very powerful example of being able to redistribute power to people because it allowed people that otherwise didn't have access to money to download software that could be used to improve their lives. For example, one of the most pirated pieces of software at the time was Photoshop, and it was used by graphic designers. At the time, it would have cost like hundreds of dollars for a subscription to Photoshop, but graphic designers could download it for free from Pirate Bay and do graphic design or make money that way. So it was kind of like, to me it was like a tool to kind of redistribute power. And so I was kind of more interested in what else on the Internet can be decentralized. And at the time before bitcoin, people were kind of thinking about how to create all kinds of decentralized systems, like decentralized domain name systems, decentralized chat systems and so on and so forth.
00:03:44.770 - 00:05:08.014, Speaker A: So when BitTorrent came around, I was naturally very interested in that. And I kind of got involved with the community very early on, around 2010, and it was a very exciting space at the time. But one of the main problems bitcoin at the time was that there was this 1 Mb block size limit, and it was kind of like a ticking time bomb, because by the time there was a 2013 bitcoin bull market, bitcoin blocks started becoming full and the transaction fees became very high. And it was kind of like a very existential crisis moment for the bitcoin community because the whole point of it was we're going to replace payment systems and everyone's going to pay with bitcoin, but it wasn't feasible at the time. And there was this huge debate within the bitcoin community about should we increase the block size or should we just keep the block size as it is and pursue L2 systems like lightning? And at the time it was like a massive rift in the community. And that's what led to the bitcoin cash fork, where bitcoin cash fork, bitcoin and increased block size limit. And the reason why the kind of core bitcoin community didn't want to increase the block size limit was because the whole point of bitcoin was that it was decentralized system where you don't have to trust anyone.
00:05:08.014 - 00:06:23.346, Speaker A: And as part of that it should be cheap to run a node that can verify the chain if you make it too expensive to run a node that verifies the chain by increasing block sizes, then it makes it they have to trust the miners more and more. And that kind of defeats the whole point. And so at the time I was thinking, well, how can we increase on chain scalability? How can we increase the block size and scale the layer one system without this trade off where users have to verify the chain, need more resource requirements to verify the chain. And in the original bitcoin white paper, there was this idea proposed by Satoshi called alerts. And the idea was he proposed this idea of light nodes, which were called spv clients in the paper. But the idea is like, you can run a lighter version of the bitcoin node that doesn't download every transaction, but only downloads the headers, and trusts the miners to only produce valid blocks. But if a miner is producing an invalid block, you can receive from other full nodes what's called an alert to effectively force black client to redownload that block.
00:06:23.346 - 00:06:51.098, Speaker A: But there was various problems with that design, but it was really interesting. And I decided to kind of pursue that further. And then I decided to pursue layer one scaling further. And I did a PhD at UCL from starting 2016, focusing on layer one scaling. And as part of that, we kind of came across, we proposed one of the earliest sharding systems. This was back in the time when Ethereum 2.0 was all about execution sharding.
00:06:51.098 - 00:07:29.430, Speaker A: And we proposed a paper called Chain space, and we commercialized it. And that was later acquired by Facebook as part of the Libra team. But I decided not to join Facebook, and effectively I decided to pursue this kind of like layer one scaling idea further. I decided to pursue alerts and fraud proofs further. So alerts is kind of like an early version of fraud proofs that optimistic roll ups use. But the main problem at the time with fraud proofs was this data availability problem. And this data availability problem had to be solved to actually fail layer one blockchain.
00:07:29.430 - 00:07:58.746, Speaker A: And so I kind of pursued that, and I co authored the paper with Vitalik on how to solve the data availability problem. And then I decided to say, well, then I kind of realized that data availability is basically actually the core thing that blockchain does. Think from first principles, like how can we make a blockchain that only does that? And that's basically how Celestia formed. So celestia is like a very minimal blockchain for building blockchains on top of, in the form of roll up chains.
00:07:58.878 - 00:08:26.382, Speaker C: Absolutely. So much to dig into there. And for me, it's kind of this full circle moment with Celestia. 15 years after Satoshi, we kind of finally have what a blockchain actually is and being able to publish data and making sure that data is available. It's kind of a simple concept, but it's wild. Guys, it's been about five years since you've been working on this, so I'm excited to dive into all of this in a moment. And on the block size war we actually had Jameson Lop on last week.
00:08:26.382 - 00:08:43.860, Speaker C: So for those listening, definitely check out that episode to go deeper there. And you touched on this, but I want to double click because I think it's an important concept on just the redistribution of power. And that's kind of the passion for decentralization. That's where your passion comes from. But can you share a little bit more about that?
00:08:44.790 - 00:09:51.686, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, when I was a teenager, I was involved with various kind of like hacking groups. Some of you might have heard of Anonymous and laltec, but I was part of this kind of hacktivist group called laltec that hacked into various kind of us government and corporate entities. And for example, we hacked into emails of this federal contractor called HP, Gary Federal. And that revealed various wrongdoing that that company was doing. And at the time, I was just like 15 years old, and all I had was a laptop, a cheap laptop. And so that kind of made me realize that it was kind of like a David ves goliath moment that made me realize that with access to just a laptop, by creating software or by manipulating information, you could basically redistribute power from the powerfuls to everyone else effectively. And so that's kind of like, what? That's also a big reason why I'm interested in cryptocurrency as well.
00:09:51.788 - 00:10:00.842, Speaker C: Absolutely. And can you tell us a little bit about the trouble you got into with that group? And I also am curious to understand your experience kind of dealing with law enforcement, if you're willing to share.
00:10:00.976 - 00:10:25.826, Speaker A: Yeah, because I was 15 at the time, so I didn't have a big sentence. There was like something like 80 computer hacking charges. But because I was under 18 in the UK, I only had like a two year suspended sentence, which means I didn't have to serve time in jail as long as I didn't reoffend. And then I had something like 320 hours of community service in a charity shop.
00:10:25.928 - 00:10:45.942, Speaker C: Got it. Okay. And I know you have an interview on Lad Bible that you go deep into it. So for those listening, definitely check out that interview. Amazing. Well, I want to get into Celestia and kind of understand a little bit more about your inspiration. You shared a little bit about it, but can we kind of go deeper into how you came up with this idea of a dedicated chain that handles publishing?
00:10:46.086 - 00:11:27.826, Speaker A: Yeah. So Celestia was formerly called lazy Ledger because it's basically a very lazy blockchain. It's basically the answer to the question of like, what fundamentally is a blockchain? If you strip back a blockchain to its core components, what do you get? And what's the laziest possible blockchain you could make that's still useful for developers? And the answer was basically lazy ledger. It was basically like, what if we just create a blockchain that all you can do on it, all developers can do on it is dump arbitrary data to it and it doesn't do any computation on that data. All you do is just like dumb. It's a dumb ledger. It doesn't have any transactions or smart contracts.
00:11:27.826 - 00:12:21.050, Speaker A: You just post arbitrary messages to it and those messages get ordered and they're made available. It turns out that's all you really need to build any kind of cryptocurrency application on top of it. You can imagine a version of bitcoin where the nodes, they don't actually execute the transactions, anything goes on the chain, but the execution can happen off chain on roll ups effectively, or like on the end user client. And that's effectively how roll ups work, right? Like roll ups effectively only use the base layer in a very dumb way. Like they basically just use it to post data onto it. But all the actual interesting stuff, the actual execution, the computation, the transactions happen off chain on the actual roll up chain. So it turns out like, and laser ledger was proposed before roll ups were proposed.
00:12:21.050 - 00:13:18.860, Speaker A: So the application model was very kind of like primitive at the time, but kind of realized, well, that's basically the fundamental thing that blockchain does. So what if we made a blockchain that only does that and scaled it extremely well? And that's where the idea of modularity comes in. Whereas previous blockchains, like bitcoin and Ethereum, they try to do everything or they try to bundle everything. So Ethereum had this world computer model where every single application runs on the same chain or runs on the same computer, but in the modular paradigm, you basically decouple, you decouple consensus from computation. So the L1 is only responsible for consensus and data availability. But developers are free, have more flexibility to define their own execution environments on top of. So instead of being limited to just using the Ethereum virtual machine or sharing the same computational resources with everyone else in a modular design.
00:13:18.860 - 00:13:56.850, Speaker A: Developers have their own roll up chains on top of it, and they can define, they have complete flexibility. They define how that roll up chain works and what kind of execution environment it uses. It doesn't have to share computational resources with everyone else. If one roll up has high gas costs, that doesn't necessarily leak into other roll ups. And that's basically a very similar model to how the web works today. Like websites don't run on the same server as everyone else. You can go on AWS or digitalocean and spin up a virtual machine very quickly with your own environment.
00:13:56.850 - 00:14:00.570, Speaker A: And roll ups are very similar to that. They're basically like virtual blockchains.
00:14:00.910 - 00:14:13.726, Speaker C: Absolutely. And you mentioned this, but the paper with Vitalik where you outlined light client proofs of data availability. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you ended up collaborating with Vitalik on that paper?
00:14:13.908 - 00:14:52.140, Speaker A: Yes. I mean, that was kind of like in the very early Ethereum 2.0, days before roll ups were part of the roadmap. Ethereum was mostly focusing on sharding. Had this idea where Ethereum was going to be sharded into like 1024 different execution shards, and execution would happen on all their shards, and their shards would either be zk proven or fraud proven. But the shards still had a data availability problem, because to fraud prove a shard, you make sure that the data behind that shard was available. And that was kind of like the missing piece of the puzzle to making sharding working.
00:14:52.140 - 00:15:48.042, Speaker A: And so this was also a problem that I was thinking about with chainspace, because chainspace was also a sharded system. So then I was emailing Vitalik, and he pointed me to this note that he wrote, it's like a very old note on GitHub from 2018 called a note on data availability. And he kind of proposed this idea of using erasure coding as a primitive to do what's like, these data availability challenges. And so I decided to kind of flesh that out more and kind of implement a prototype of it. And we kind of ended up collaborating on this data availability paper in around 2019. And then after that, I decided to kind of like, I realized that this could be used as a primitive to, because this is a core component of what blockchain does. What would a blockchain look like? That only does that.
00:15:48.042 - 00:15:50.714, Speaker A: And that's what lazy ledger effectively is.
00:15:50.832 - 00:16:01.326, Speaker C: Amazing. And yeah, as mentioned, that process started in 2019. So almost five years. What were the major challenges that you needed to overcome to implement what seems like a simple idea.
00:16:01.508 - 00:16:43.178, Speaker A: Yeah. So from an engineering perspective, in theory, Celestia is a very simple idea. It's just like a data availability layer without smart contracts. So it's like a very simple chain. But at the time, the infrastructure was very early on when we would start building this in 2020, Cosmos was just released. So that was the only option we had to build a proof of stake chain. So that's what we built on, and we basically modified the Cosmos SDK to strip it down and to add data availability sampling to it.
00:16:43.178 - 00:17:51.854, Speaker A: And so there's a lot of work involved in, even though the chain itself is simple, like, it's just a chain for posting data, there was a lot of work involved to implementing data availability sampling, because the thing that makes lesser interesting is that it's not just a dumb chain where you post data on it. It also does that in a trust minimized and scalable way, using a new primitive called data availability sampling, where effectively you can have light clients, like anyone can run a light node on their phone, for example, that does this thing called data availability sampling, which effectively allows you to verify the data availability of the entire chain without needing to download all the data, but by only downloading random pieces of the data. And this was kind of like a very new and cutting edge primitive that no one had really implemented in practice yet. But it's a primitive that other chains, including dankshotting, plans to implement because it's effectively the cutting edge of scalability. So no one had implemented this before. So that was one of the key challenges of kind of like shipping the protocol effectively.
00:17:51.982 - 00:18:00.610, Speaker C: Absolutely. And kind of putting it all together. How do you see Celestia and data availability fitting in to an overall kind of blockchain architecture?
00:18:00.770 - 00:19:00.122, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Celestia basically provides the base layer for roll ups to build on top of. Before Celestia roll ups, the only option that roll ups had effectively for data availability was the Ethereum L1, which had extremely limited data availability or using some kind of centralized data availability committee. But once Celestial was launched, it kind of like unleashed a fundamentally new primitive that for the first time, it made it possible for roll ups to have access to cheap, decentralized data availability. So for the first time now, we see since Celestial has launched, we've seen various Ethereum roll ups, for example, switch to Celestia or support Celestia as the earlier. And one example of that is manta, which is an op stack roll up that previously posted the data on L1. And there's this application on top of it called ZK Holden. And it costed something like $100 to play a game.
00:19:00.122 - 00:19:13.994, Speaker A: But now with Celestial, it only costs one dollars. So you get this huge kind of 100 x cost improvement that made certain applications possible that simply weren't possible before on chains like Ethereum.
00:19:14.122 - 00:19:28.238, Speaker C: Absolutely. Okay, and the buzzword is modular blockchains. I think you all are responsible for that becoming a buzword. Can you tell us what is a modular blockchain and how is it kind of new or different from previous approaches?
00:19:28.334 - 00:20:10.670, Speaker A: Yeah, so a modular blockchain is basically any blockchain that outsources a component to another blockchain. And those components, there's four components. And those components are consensus data availability, settlement or execution. So for example, like a roll up is a modular blockchain because it outsources data availability to another chain like Ethereum or celestial. And then celestial is also a modular blockchain because it outsources computational execution to roll ups. And it's a very kind of like evolved way of building blockchains. Scalability is one of the main advantages, but to me, the biggest advantage is developer flexibility.
00:20:10.670 - 00:21:17.126, Speaker A: Developers. Previously with traditional blockchains, if you wanted to make one small improvement to the chain, like for example, you had chains like Solana or Aptos or Sui, they introduced new execution environments that parallelized the smart contracts to make it possible to process more transactions. But previously, in every cycle, to make one improvement to one part of the stack, you would typically have to launch a whole new blockchain that had a new proof of stake network and so on and so forth. But with Mario blockchains, if you want to make improvement to one small part stack, you don't have to launch a whole new chain anymore, you can just launch a new roll up. If you wanted to make a more efficient execution environment, let's say, and this is like an actual example, you could modify the EVM to add new opcodes to make certain applications possible. Previously, without roll ups, you would have to launch a whole new blockchain. But with roll ups, you can just modify the EVM in one roll up and then launch it.
00:21:17.126 - 00:21:42.022, Speaker A: And that's what certain projects like Curio are doing. For example, like Curio is a game engine where they can modify the EVM to actually embed the entire game as an opcode to the EVM. And then Ford prove that. For example. And previously that would require launching a whole new chain. But with roll ups, it gives developers a lot more flexibility with a lot less friction.
00:21:42.086 - 00:21:54.494, Speaker C: And now that Celestia is live, how do you envision that impacting the future of Web three, maybe 510 years out? And what are your thoughts on these monolithic blockchains that you mentioned? Kind of long term?
00:21:54.622 - 00:22:52.980, Speaker A: Yeah. The ultimate goal is to make smart contracts. Sorry, to make roll up chains as easy as to deploy a smart contract in the future, we could very well see that the default way to deploy new decentralized applications is to deploy a new roll up chain instead of a new smart contract. Just like how today in web two, if you want to deploy a new website, you're more likely to deploy a new virtual machine rather than use some shared web hosting provider like Jira cities or Dreamhost, which was popular back in the day, but now we have virtual machines that you don't need to do that anymore. So I see that as a major evolution in the blockchain space for deploying applications. I think there's still space for monolithic blockchains to fundamentally have different trade offs, but ultimately, it's very clear that we live in a multi chain ecosystem. So it's like this idea where it's like you have one monolithic chain that does everything.
00:22:52.980 - 00:23:16.102, Speaker A: It's pretty clear the market has rejected that because it's pretty clear we have a multi chain ecosystem, and roll ups are very important set to that. Because if you have a multi chain ecosystem, it's pretty clear that it's not sustainable for everyone to launch their own proof of stake network from scratch because you're fragmenting security. But roll up chains are much more practical because they inherit security from one base layer.
00:23:16.166 - 00:23:45.060, Speaker D: If you haven't already considered building your next smart contract in rust, you got to have a look at Sorabond. You can migrate your existing solidity smart contracts over to sorabond and we'll show you how you can also get funding for your projects. There's a 100 million dollar adoption fund just to drive the adoption of sorabond so you can help build the ecosystem and potentially qualify for grant awards up to $150,000. You can visit us now at sorabond stellar.org to learn more.
00:23:46.070 - 00:23:55.890, Speaker C: This is more of a marketing question, which you might hate answering as more of an engineer mind, but I am curious, how did you get everyone so excited about this concept of a modular blockchain?
00:23:56.050 - 00:24:41.154, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think. Yeah, I mean, I think we introduced the idea. We, we kind of like introduced the phrase of modular blockchains to refer to roll ups around back in 2019 and around a year later, around a year after later that was introduced, Ethereum kind of switched to its roll up centric roadmap, and they kind of abandoned execution, shrouding in favor of a roll up centric roadmap. And there was this kind of like Ethereum influencer called Polynea who started writing about roll ups, and he started adopting the phrase module blockchain to kind of get everyone involved. So I think it's partly like it kind of caught on heavily in the Ethereum community. Effectively.
00:24:41.282 - 00:24:56.250, Speaker C: Got it. Okay, amazing. And then there are other projects. Ethereum's working on their own data availability layer. We have Eigen layer also providing data availability in the future. Can you talk to us a little bit about how Celestia compares kind of being in the cosmos ecosystem?
00:24:56.750 - 00:25:31.682, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think DLAs have different trade offs, but ultimately, developers should be free to choose what kind of components suits them, because the whole idea of modularism is that we're trying to overcome maximalism and give developers flexibility. But it's pretty hard to tell at this stage what different trade offs are because Celestia is the only kind of like outda layer, if you like, that is live right now. But once those other dlayers are live, then it become clearer what the trade offs are. But right now, it's fairly hypothetical.
00:25:31.826 - 00:25:42.520, Speaker C: Fair enough. And with that, let's get into the fundamentals of how celestia works. Can you tell us a little bit about how the blockchain functions and then the role of various, I mean.
00:25:44.330 - 00:26:44.378, Speaker A: I guess I have the idea of this consensus nodes, but effectively, Celestia is pretty much like a standard cosmos chain, except that it has this kind of transaction type called pay for blob space or pay for blobs. And you can create a pay for blob transaction to effectively submit data to the chain and pay for it. So it's kind of like very simple. It's kind of very similar to EIP 4844 on Ethereum, like how you can submit data blocks on chain and you can get it included on chain, and then it's based on tendermint. So you have these tendermint consensus nodes that are producing blocks, but then we also have this kind of, like, we have the core consensus network, but we also have this side data availability network that is kind of like segregated from the consensus network or like separate from the consensus network. And this data availability network is what roll ups interact with. You have full nodes and light nodes on that data availability network.
00:26:44.378 - 00:27:20.626, Speaker A: Full nodes. They serve effectively samples to light nodes. So if you're running a light node that does data availability sampling or trying to get data from certain parts of the chain, then they kind of like ask the full nodes for that data. And there's this concept of namespaces in Celestia. So if you're a roll up, you can submit data to, it's kind of like a Twitter hashtag. So it's like how you can, like, if you tweet something, you can have a hashtag for it, and you can search for specific hashtags on Twitter. So Celestia has a kind of similar concept called namespaces.
00:27:20.626 - 00:27:51.246, Speaker A: So when you submit data on Celestia, you submit them to certain namespaces, and then you can search namespaces for data. So if you roll up, you can submit data to a specific namespace for your roll up, and then other users on that roll up can search data for that roll up in your namespace to reconstruct the state of your roll up. And so you have these light nodes on Celestia. They can ask the full nodes on the data availability network for data within a specific namespace.
00:27:51.358 - 00:28:01.094, Speaker C: Got it. And what do you think about the analogy of kind of celestia being this Twitter for computers or maybe a bulletin board for computers? Have you ever put it that way?
00:28:01.212 - 00:28:44.606, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty hard to come up with a perfect analogy for celestial because it doesn't really fit into, neatly into any kind of bucket. But I mean, bulletin board is accurate. It's kind of like a bulletin board in the sense that you put data on the board and other people can see it for a certain amount of time, and that data is kind of like taken off later after everyone can see it. Everyone has seen it already. So, yeah, you can definitely think of it that way. Twitter for roll ups or Twitter for blockchains also makes sense as well because Twitter effectively is also proposed. Like someone should do inscriptions on Twitter.
00:28:44.606 - 00:28:48.066, Speaker A: I think there's actually a project doing inscriptions on Twitter.
00:28:48.178 - 00:29:09.254, Speaker C: Oh, very amazing. Okay, nice. And then I would say more of the maximalists around decentralization, oftentimes would define decentralization as the ability to kind of verify the state of the network yourself at low costs. So with that, can you talk to us a little bit about compute and storage requirements to run a full validator on Celestia?
00:29:09.382 - 00:29:54.970, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's very important to us that anyone could run a light node with very low resource requirements. You can run a light node on your phone. So the resource requirements for light nodes are very low. I think it's something like you only need something like 25 bandwidth and only a few gigs of disk space. So you might have seen it on Twitter, but there's like these campaigns where a lot of people are posting pictures of themselves running light nodes in all sorts of different locations. We can run a light node on your phone using WiFi or airplane, for example. It's very low resource requirements, whereas full nodes have much higher resource requirements.
00:29:54.970 - 00:30:52.640, Speaker A: But the whole point is like the light node should give you ideally almost the same level of security as a full node. So it kind of makes it that light nodes aren't disadvantaged in terms of security compared to a full node with higher resources, resource requirements. And to me, that's kind of like the whole point of a blockchain in the first place. The whole reason why we're here is to kind of like, we don't want to replicate traditional finance and traditional corporations. In traditional finance, it's kind of generally based around committees, right? Or shareholders in a company. If a majority of shareholders decide one thing, then something can happen. But the whole point of blockchains is that it's supposed to be trust minimized so that no one can rug you, including committee, shouldn't be able to rug you, not even the validator set.
00:30:52.640 - 00:31:46.686, Speaker A: And that's why, for example, on bitcoin and Ethereum, the validator set cannot collude to violate the protocol rules. If there was a government order, for example, to say, hey, please change amount, please change the protocol rules in this way. To print more money, for example, or to freeze this account, or to redistribute funds from this account to another account. The validators cannot be compelled to do that because their blocks will be rejected by full nodes. And that's what fundamentally differentiates web3 from web two. It's not just a decentralized database. It's also something where the end users can verify the state of the network and light nodes that can verify the chain using fraud proofs or zk proofs or database sampling are extremely important to achieve that.
00:31:46.868 - 00:32:16.498, Speaker C: Absolutely. I couldn't agree more. And I do feel like this industry, I don't know if it's from vcs or maybe traditional web two characters coming into web3 and kind of masking as web3 while putting paywalls up and kind of trying to create the same vendor lock that we have in web two. Are you seeing that as well, and are you worried about that or concerned about that kind of corrupting the industry going forward? Maybe not at the blockchain layer, but at parts of the stack above the blockchain layer.
00:32:16.594 - 00:32:56.562, Speaker A: Yeah. Building decentralized systems is always a challenge. But fundamentally, I think one of the core principles of sedestia is that off chain governance trumps on chain governance. So it's like the idea is even if someone has a lot of tokens, for example, it's not a member of accuracy. So it's like kind of very similar to Ethereum governance where you can't just buy your way to pushing a certain proposal. And that's very important to, I think, making very difficult for your protocol to corrupt. And that's why.
00:32:56.562 - 00:33:33.802, Speaker A: So one of the key things that we value at celestial is this idea of the social layer. So it's like layer zero is effectively the social layer. The reason why a blockchain has value in the first place is because people have agreed to have value. The reason why the current bitcoin chain has value and not some fork. The bitcoin chain is because layer zero, social consensus, agrees that it has value, has value. And that's kind of like a very important part of celestia. Like this idea that the community can hard fork or decides what chain is a valid on.
00:33:33.802 - 00:33:52.338, Speaker A: So it's like the validators, if the validators, for example, or token holders, become disconnected from the community into social vision of celestial, that the community has this ultimate say, or the off chain kind of social layer has ultimate say of what is the correct chain.
00:33:52.434 - 00:34:09.754, Speaker C: Love that governance minimized, I think is so important. Okay. And kind of double clicking, let's say someone's running a client and queries to find out if a blob of data is available. How do they identify that that's at fault? How does that work? And how do they identify that the data is not available?
00:34:09.952 - 00:34:53.546, Speaker A: So basically the way it works is site nodes. They sample every block for random chunks. So they say, okay, there's a new block. I'm going to try to download random parts of that block. And basically you can get a very high guarantee, higher than 99% guarantee that the entire block is available by only downloading less than 1% of the block. And basically, if the light nodes don't receive a response to any of their samples, then they can assume that block is not available. So only if the light client receives all the responses to the parts of the block they responded to, they will know that the block is very likely to be fully available.
00:34:53.728 - 00:35:05.514, Speaker C: Got it, thank you. And I've heard some people kind of confuse the graph in celestia. Can you explain a little bit between decentralized indexing and querying versus data availability and how they kind of intersect.
00:35:05.642 - 00:35:41.980, Speaker A: Yeah. So the graph is more like a layer above data availability in sense, like the graph protocols. Like the graph, they kind of index data on data availability layer to kind of make sense of it. And it's kind of like also people confusing data availability from data storage. So you can kind of think of it like celestial is a bulletin board, and a bulletin board. If you think about a bolting board in real life, it doesn't permanently, like when you post something on a bolting board, it doesn't stay there forever. It just stays there long enough for enough people to see it.
00:35:41.980 - 00:36:31.042, Speaker A: For anyone that wants to see it can see it, but if someone wants to see it for longer, then people can store it on storage protocols, like filecoin, for example. But the graph layer on top of that, it kind of interprets that data and has to make sense of it and indexes it effectively. So kind of like they can say, okay, here's a certain category of, for example, if you think of like a bulletin board, where here's a certain category of bulletin. I want to create the graph to say, please give me a list of all bulletins that are related to this specific thing. Like how many bulletins charge rent over 1000. So you can kind of think of that as more like indexing.
00:36:31.186 - 00:36:41.354, Speaker C: Absolutely. Kind of organizing the sticky notes on the bulletin board, perhaps. And with that, can you talk to us a little bit about the developer experience of someone building on Celestia? What does that look like?
00:36:41.472 - 00:37:33.070, Speaker A: Yeah, you would basically have to use a kind of like a roll up framework because Celestia itself is just for festing data. So you can use any roll up framework because we've done a lot of work integrating various roll up frameworks to use celestial. So you can build an optimism stack roll up, for example, Celestia, you can build a arbitram nitro roll up, for example. So if you go on build, it gives you a list of different roll ups. And there's also kind of like a new set of non Ethereum roll ups that are coming along that are also very exciting. So you have projects like the sovereign SDK, which allow you to build sovereign roll ups. You also have projects like dimension with things like diamond and Roll kit, which allows you to build cosmos chains as roll ups.
00:37:33.070 - 00:38:13.350, Speaker A: And we also have this new category of projects called roll up as a service. So it's kind of like very similar to AWS. You can go through a roll up as a service provider, and you can basically upload the code for your application, and it can automatically deploy that roll up for you on your behalf. Kind of like how you would deploy a virtual machine on AWS. And I would say that's probably the easiest way to deploy a roll up. If you go on the caldera or Conduit or Vistara website, you can literally click on a web interface and fill out a form, and in minutes, you can deploy your own roll up without having to worry about your own infrastructure.
00:38:13.510 - 00:38:22.800, Speaker C: Absolutely. Thank you. And you mentioned why you chose building in the cosmos ecosystem. If you were kind of starting fresh today, would you have built it the same way?
00:38:24.050 - 00:39:02.250, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it would still build it as a cosmos chain because it's kind of like very aligned, the idea of cosmos, whereas anyone can create their own chain. You could also build it using swapstrate. But I think Polkadot is less aligned with this idea of roll ups. They're more focused on kind of execution charts, but also, funny enough, that's kind of changing. Recently, people are discussing how do we use Bulgar as a data availability layer. So this tides are turning a. I mean, there's definitely a lot of things we had to redo when we were building celestial.
00:39:02.250 - 00:39:23.978, Speaker A: Initially, we didn't have this idea of a different database network. Initially, we tried to make the data evolution network, try to bolt it into the tenement consensus network and didn't work very well. So, I mean, there's definitely a lot of things that we learned along the way that if we were doing it again, we might be able to do it faster or more effectively.
00:39:24.074 - 00:39:30.930, Speaker C: Absolutely. That's always the case. And what about non engineers? Is there any way for them to participate in Celestia today?
00:39:31.080 - 00:40:02.618, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you can either check out some of applications on Celestia that are live. Mantis, for example, is pretty cool. They have various applications. It's a ZK based chain, and they have applications like ZK Holden. There's also other cool applications on the dimension testnet that you can play around with, and you can also run a light client or a light node if you want to kind of contribute to the security of the network. So if you go on the selashi website, it kind of gives you instructions how to do that.
00:40:02.784 - 00:40:21.220, Speaker C: Thank you. Okay. Amazing. And with that, you had one of the most epic launches in 2023. I think actually you had the best launch in 2023. For the teams listening, maybe there's a team listening that they want to launch a network. Any advice for them? Tips, learnings that you can share?
00:40:25.750 - 00:40:56.954, Speaker A: I think the most important thing is the ship as soon as possible. I think that's good advice for any kind of startup to ship earlier than later. For us, we're lucky because we kind of identified the problem way before anyone else. So we have a first rev advantage because we shipped very early. But I think that's kind of like the most important thing to basically ship as early as possible and to kind of iterate from there effectively.
00:40:57.082 - 00:41:02.874, Speaker C: I like that. Yeah. Ship an MVP and iterate. Amazing. And how big was your team at the launch?
00:41:03.002 - 00:41:04.126, Speaker A: Around 40 people.
00:41:04.228 - 00:41:05.262, Speaker C: Amazing. Okay.
00:41:05.316 - 00:41:05.918, Speaker B: Wow.
00:41:06.084 - 00:41:11.566, Speaker C: And for those listening who might want to join your team, can you share a little bit about what your culture is like internally?
00:41:11.678 - 00:42:01.394, Speaker A: Yes, I think we have, like one job opening for software engineer on the role kit team at Lesha Labs. But, yeah, I think the way I would describe our culture is that everyone is kind of like very world class what they do. So it's like anyone who joins immediately learns a lot from people around them, and everyone's very passionate about what they do. So there's very high bar of quality for work. So if that's kind of like something you're interested in, you're very passionate about celestia, and you want to learn from others who are also very passionate and a world class, what they do is kind of like a very good place to be.
00:42:01.512 - 00:42:09.778, Speaker C: Absolutely amazing. And then talk to us a little bit about the different orgs that exist within Celestia. You mentioned labs. Are there any others foundation?
00:42:09.954 - 00:43:12.582, Speaker A: Yeah. So the Celestia foundation, which established, which was announced earlier this year, and that basically the Celestia foundation kind of holds the foundation, the treasury, or like a big part of the treasury, and is basically responsible for, has a responsibility to do things like grants, R and d grants, and that kind of thing, we do have a very surprisingly decentralized core development ecosystem. So there was a lot of people involved in celestial launch other than celestial labs. So even though celestial labs developed the kind of national testnets, now we have a lot of other core developer organizations contributing celestial. So if you have succinct, for example, which contributed the kind of like Blob stream, the ZK blobstream, Xbridge, which is like the data bridge to Ethereum, and there's various other kind of project organizations like informal systems, which were one of the original contributors to Cosmos.
00:43:12.726 - 00:43:26.990, Speaker C: And as Vitalik oftentimes plants these little seeds and these little nuggets of what he wants to kind of see built, are there any seeds you would like to plant? As you think about grants and things that are being built in the celestia ecosystem?
00:43:27.330 - 00:43:50.022, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one thing I want to see is payments. I know a lot of people try to do that before, but I actually think roll ups are potentially the thing that actually makes payments. Because to me, the original use case for crypto is payments, but no one has really cracked that yet. And I think roll ups might actually fundamentally make that possible.
00:43:50.156 - 00:44:01.410, Speaker C: Can you share more about that? Because I feel like it's really difficult to infiltrate the payment system because Visa and Mastercard are so easy to use, but I guess they are expensive. But can you share more about your vision there?
00:44:01.500 - 00:45:04.080, Speaker A: Yeah, but to me, the beauty of roll ups is that they can give you web two style ux with web3 properties. Because the whole point of roll ups is that you can create your own execution environment and roll ups can have extremely fast latency. The arbitrarim sequencer has faster latency than Salana has, something like 100 millisecond block times. So you can have extremely fast payment systems that competitive with PayPal, for example, use on Mastercard, and you can have it with cheap transaction fees thanks to cheap DA and roll ups. And you can make it so that you can customize the execution environment to make it more conducive to payments. So instead of being limited to the ethereum virtual machine or the virtual machine, you can make it more optimized for specific payments use cases, and you would just use a stable coin. So, yeah, I really feel like if you do it as a roll up, it could potentially make kind of payments way more usable than they've been before.
00:45:04.530 - 00:45:10.730, Speaker C: And thoughts on stablecoins and how we kind of decentralize them while having efficient liquidity?
00:45:10.890 - 00:45:51.390, Speaker A: Well, you obviously wouldn't do it the way that terra did, but I don't know if anyone knows how to really make. It's not really clear the jury still out if algorithmic stablecoins are even kind of like possible without collapsing. I mean, I don't really have too much thoughts about that. Unfortunately, it is the case that stablecoins like USDC and USDT are centralized and jury sold out is if a decentralized stablecoin, how possible decentralized stablecoin is? I guess makerdao has been working pretty well recently, but I think most of the collateral on there is USDC, if I remember correctly.
00:45:51.970 - 00:46:08.434, Speaker C: Yeah, going a little bit more centralized. Rari is another one, but they're lacking liquidity. Yeah, jury's still out. I suppose you're right. Amazing. And then talk to us a little bit about the technical roadmap what does that look like? And what are the next important feature upgrades we should look out for?
00:46:08.552 - 00:46:43.546, Speaker A: Yeah, so kind of like long term more star is centered around three things, which is 1GB blocks, 1 million roll ups on 1 billion light nodes. So that's kind of like the long term community vision for celestial, but in the short term, a lot of short term features like various networking improvements to make networking layer more efficient, adding pruning to the network, that kind of thing. And there's a team working on browser light nodes so that you can run a light node in your browser as well. So ideas like you can integrate a light node to wallet this directly.
00:46:43.658 - 00:46:47.322, Speaker C: Amazing. Okay. And the final question is, how are you defiant?
00:46:47.466 - 00:47:22.246, Speaker A: How am I defiant? Well, I think it's pretty clear I'm defiant given that I was arrested for computer hacking when I was like teenager. I think anyone in web3 should be defined because the whole point of web3 is that you want to decentralize power effectively and to effectively to create systems that are immune or more or trust minimized and don't rely on corrupt or untrustworthy institutions or middlemen. And that's effectively why I'm here.
00:47:22.428 - 00:47:35.358, Speaker C: Absolutely. Me as well. Grateful to have you in the ecosystem and congrats again on all the success. I can't wait to see how celestia transform forms the web3 space and ecosystem. Thank you so much for coming on, Mustafa. Appreciate it.
00:47:35.524 - 00:47:40.700, Speaker A: Thank you. Our.
