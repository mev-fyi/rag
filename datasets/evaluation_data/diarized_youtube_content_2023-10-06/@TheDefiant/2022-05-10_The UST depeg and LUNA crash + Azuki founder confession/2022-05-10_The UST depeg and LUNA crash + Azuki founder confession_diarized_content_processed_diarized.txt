00:00:00.720 - 00:00:16.300, Speaker A: Good morning, afternoon, wherever you are. It's Tuesday, which means normally it's time for a tutorial. But no, we're not going to do a tutorial today because, well, there's only one story dominating the market. It is of course ust. So alp, let's do this properly. Come with me. Bring the lights.
00:00:16.300 - 00:00:56.034, Speaker A: Oh my goodness. Oh, that's good. Good thing we have this set set up. Nothing as you can see to see here. Nothing to see here. Now let's start with a tweet. You could listen to influence oars about UST depegging for the 69th time or you could remember they're all now poor and go for a run instead wid this, believe it or not, was Do Kwon's tweet a day before UST lost its peg and plummeted to a scarcely believable 60 cents.
00:00:56.034 - 00:01:27.138, Speaker A: Bear in mind this is a stablecoin we're talking about. You know that thing that's supposed to be like stable. Now, if you had the conviction that UST would reach its peg again, then buying a dollar for 60 cents on the dollar, well, that would be a good opportunity to get in. And guess what? 0x Sifu, well, he went in with size. So SIFU exchanged about 2.8 million USDT and it is weird to be in a situation where USDT is like the safe sane option and and he exchanged it for about 3.88 million UST.
00:01:27.138 - 00:02:07.718, Speaker A: They're supposed to be one to one. This is nuts. And that was when UST was around 72 cents, which is an easy 700 grand profit on a stable to stable trade. Now, at the time of writing the script, UST has yet to regain its peg and it's hovering just around about 91 cents.

It is an algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. You can redeem Luna for UST interchangeably, meaning Luna at 50 bucks gets you 50 UST and vice versa. But if UST loses its peg to, let's say 90 cents, you can then buy it at a discount and redeem it for a dollar's worth of Luna. That's the way the system is designed, and it's supposed to be kind of creating an incentive to keep UST as close to $1 as possible. It's basically arbitrage. Now the game mechanics to maintain the PEG are supposed to work in theory, and by and large they do.
00:04:09.910 - 00:04:56.380, Speaker A: But we know by now in theory there is no difference between theory and practice, while in practice there is. So to overcome any potential vulnerability, DO Kwon and others founded lfg. They called it lfg, the Lunar Foundation Guard. LFG is dedicated to supporting a vibrant community of blockchain innovators committed to developing a decentralized global economy, they said. Now, LFG had been buying up Bitcoin in large quantities since late January as a kind of backup plan to maintain UST's peg and do. Kwon himself had been extremely vocal on Twitter about this. It even became the reason why people were bullish on Bitcoin because they knew there was a buyer coming in, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying every month.
00:04:56.380 - 00:05:45.426, Speaker A: And well, you can see where this is going, right? So the Bitcoin backup to USC's peg is there as a backstop, and yesterday they needed that backstop. In a thread they explained the LFG Council has voted to execute the following Loan $750 million worth of BTC to an OTC trading firm or firms to help prot the UST peg. Then loan 750 million UST to accumulate BTC as market conditions normalize. Yikes. Now, after a 6% drop in UST. Do tweeted this referring to the Bitcoin held by the LFG Treasury. But that didn't save the day as UST dropped down another 36% from there.
00:05:45.426 - 00:06:10.198, Speaker A: Now more on LFG in a bit. If you recall, back last year, 2021, there was a catastrophic de pegging of UST. It went down to 86 cents. That was the worst it went to. This was so much worse. Now think about this. Is it a problem if UST market cap is larger than the lunar market cap? Well, not necessarily.
00:06:10.198 - 00:06:37.492, Speaker A: Every time UST is minted, the equivalent is burnt in Luna. That's how it works. The problematic scenario looks a bit like this. Luna is burnt at a high Luna price to mint UST. So you get X number of UST for that high price of Luna, say 60 bucks per Luna. You get 60 UST. But as Luna's price falls, UST is then redeemed for more units of Luna that was initially burned to begin with.
00:06:37.492 - 00:07:12.094, Speaker A: And that suddenly creates a situation in which you have a whole bunch of extra Luna on the market that nobody really knows what to do with except sell. And that's what happened yesterday. Essentially the reason behind the severe drawdown of Luna and the deepg of UST boils down to this. Massive amounts of UST was unstaked from anchor and then dumped. And this led to UST de pegging due to the extraordinary high sailing pressure. UST holders then redeemed for Luna, then dumped that Luna and all in a matter of days. TVL on ANKR dropped from 14 billion to to 6 billion.
00:07:12.094 - 00:08:05.866, Speaker A: So suddenly there's a massive supply shock and the whole house of cards collapsed. Now, at this point in time, this seems like a very well executed, well coordinated attack. So who could be behind this? Well, this is what we see when we peek into the Genesis trading loan book. The LFGE has unveiled the closing of a $1 billion OTT swap of UST for BTC led by prominent digital currency prime broker Genesis. Now Do K offered to buy a discounted BTC for UST and he took the offer. Now who is the big bad behind this? Well, nothing concrete, but there are suspicions that Citadel. Yes, Citadel, the absolute behemoth trading monster borrowed 100,000 BTC, then traded 25,000 BTC for UST, opened a BTC short, started dumping 75,000 BTC.
00:08:05.866 - 00:08:38.134, Speaker A: And once BTC reached 30k, they started dumping UST to make it lose its peg, which forced Kwon to sell 25,000 BTC at major loss to recover the further dumping the price of btc. And all of this happening while Citadel is in a delicious short. How cute. Now again, this is unofficial, but come on, this is what the sharks do. Welcome to Swimming with Sharks. And yesterday, a very different type of shark, Naim Bukele, bought the dip himself. 500 coins at around $31,000.
00:08:38.134 - 00:08:56.290, Speaker A: And as he bragged on Twitter, I could sell these coins right now. I make almost a million dollars in just 11 hours. But of man, I'm a geezer. I got the bitcoins down, brav. I ain't selling shit. I'm a hodler, innit? Ah, very cool man. Very cool.
00:08:56.290 - 00:09:21.810, Speaker A: What a boss you are. Now the country's total reserve is up to 2,301 bitcoin, or about $71.7 million at current prices. And they also revealed their bitcoin city layout. Even cuter. That whole El Salvador story just gets weirder and weirder. And on top of everything else, Teamazuki decided yesterday was the perfect day of all days to come clean.
00:09:21.810 - 00:09:50.900, Speaker A: Confessing to pulling several rugs with projects like Funks Tendies and Zunx. This is Zagabond. There is a rumor here that it was actually cool cats who were threatening to out Zagabond as the founder of these rugs. So maybe there was just pressure behind the scenes. Come clean yo on all on such a day as that. I actually ran the numbers on this. There was so much volume, so much selling volume on Azuki's that they made around $3 million in one day.
00:09:50.900 - 00:10:24.150, Speaker A: Genius. So as we heard from Zagabon, Funks taught us the important magic behind storytelling. That is Philip was the inspiration behind Bobo Tendies. Remember them? Taught us the importance of original ideas rather than chasing a short lived meta. Come on, mate. And Zunks told us that no matter how great the product is, the space is looking for new universes, a strong sense of purpose beyond rare traits and unique experiences with gas optimizations, I.e. this was the inspiration for ERC 721A to reduce gas costs for the community.
00:10:24.150 - 00:10:48.320, Speaker A: So why now? Why did he come clean now? Well, the suspicion is that Zagabond had actually been blackmailed. But who knows. It was a bad day for Suzuki holders. It was even worse for those holding UST Luna and and Azuki. And I never thought I'd see the day when a UST dollar was worth pretty much as much as these. And when the money printer runs dry, it doesn't sound great, does it, Pe?
