00:00:00.170 - 00:00:06.986, Speaker A: So what is Eigen layer? Can you give us maybe the level five version? Speak to me like I'm five, and then we can dig in further.
00:00:07.098 - 00:00:34.914, Speaker B: Eigen layer is a mechanism to share the security of Ethereum to any other protocols, whether they be new chains or there are new services built inside the Ethereum ecosystem, like oracle, data availability bridges, index, anything that really requires a decentralized validation network. How can we take the Ethereum trust network and supply portions.
00:00:34.962 - 00:00:36.294, Speaker UNK: Of that to.
00:00:36.492 - 00:00:58.090, Speaker B: Services that want to consume it? Another way of thinking about it is it's a marketplace for decentralized trust. I would say the first marketplace for flexible decentralized trust. That's what Eigen layer is. Eigen comes from the german word I again, for your own. And it's basically your own layer. We want to empower anybody to come and build their own layer on top of this common trust framework.
