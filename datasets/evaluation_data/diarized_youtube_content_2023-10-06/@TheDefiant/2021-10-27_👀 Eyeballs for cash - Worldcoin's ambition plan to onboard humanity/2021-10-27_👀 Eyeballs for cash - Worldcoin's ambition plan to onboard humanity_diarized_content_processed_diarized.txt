00:01:34.768 - 00:02:40.190, Speaker A: So, hey, if you've spent any time around crypto recently, you will have not been able to avoid worldcoin, the cryptocurrency, if we can even call it that, that wants to scan your eyeballs and give you cash, cold, hard cash, for free. I'm going to try and keep my snark to a low level here and just evaluate this thing on the facts that are in front of me because it is so easy to get judgy and preachy and angry about this. So let's not do that before we get into world coin, because world coin, there's so many things that are problematic about it, but we will get into that because we are adults. So worldcoin, what is Worldcoin? Well, in their words, it's a new, collectively owned global currency that will be distributed fairly to as many people as possible. Note the word fairly fair launch. Kind of a meme, right? Yearn finance fair launch. But now when I hear projects say fair launch, what do we think? Probably not fair.
00:02:40.190 - 00:03:12.614, Speaker A: If you have to say it, it probably isn't. So they have this vision, a coin for humanity. It's going to be built on top of its own layer two, using optimistic roll ups. And this is a company that is obsessed with network effects. In their words, 3% of the world's population is in crypto right now. They reference a crypto.com survey, a piece of research that came out in July to back this up, and they're saying that's terrible for creating the network effects required to really make something out of cryptocurrencies.
00:03:12.614 - 00:03:58.470, Speaker A: So they say, imagine a world where everyone around the globe, regardless of who they are, could participate in the growing space of digital economies and benefit from decentralized collective ownership. What would it take to get there? So their point is that cryptocurrency is kind of this boys club where it's all in the hands of Wales and most, the concentration of wealth is incredibly compact. And that actually, to do what cryptocurrency wants to do, you have to get around that. And the way you do that is by distributing tokens to as many humans as possible. So what they say is welcome, aims to overcome this coordination problem by aligning the incentives of all participants and allocating the majority of the currency to new users as a reward for joining the network. So it's like a sign up bonus, basically. You join the network, you get a coin.
00:03:58.470 - 00:04:32.338, Speaker A: Note the fact that the majority of the currency to new users, it's not all of the currency, it's the majority. And we'll come back to why that's important. But the concept here is Ubi. Wellkind is not a Ubi project, but the concepts and the ideas are very, very akin to the concept of UBI. If you don't know what UBI is, it's universal basic income. It's this notion that everybody on earth could be entitled to, basically a stipend. It's a form of income that you get every month.
00:04:32.338 - 00:05:17.534, Speaker A: And there are instances of this around the world already. Andrew Yang in 2020, built his entire platform on the freedom dividend. I mean, there were a bunch of other things as well. But he's primarily talking about how AI is going to eat all of our jobs, pretty much, and particularly middle class income, which makes up the bulk of how we pay for taxes and everything else. And so he implemented what he was going to implement if he was elected, the freedom dividend, which was a basic income of $1,000 per month, $12,000 a year for every american adult over the age of 18, every single adult would be entitled to $12,000 a year. That's a massive, massive idea. Andrew Young himself is a massive proponent of cryptocurrency.
00:05:17.534 - 00:06:12.622, Speaker A: He believes that this is one path to universal basic income, and this may not impact you. But if you think about the number of drivers in the US and the particularly young adult males, a lot of them go into driving around, in some states, it's around ten to 15% of jobs of young males are driving jobs. And if you think automated vehicles and particularly automated heavy goods vehicles are coming at speed, all of that goes away, and that's going to be problematic. And Andrew Yang has made that the core piece of his platform. Finland ran an experiment where they actually gave 2000 unemployed people a monthly tax exempt basic income of â‚¬560. And they ran it for two years. And the results of it were small employment effects.
00:06:12.622 - 00:07:18.194, Speaker A: So, yes, people were slightly better able to get jobs, but better perceived economic security and mental well being. So Ubi, under the conditions of this finished experiment, improved people's lives. We actually spoke to Ollie Spangas, who ran that experiment about a year and a half ago and had a really good chat with him about just the impact of Ubi on their thinking, and particularly this experiment. And he was very, very positive about what had happened in the experiment, but very, very pessimistic about the Finn's ability to roll that out in any meaningful way outside of Finland. A lot of things have happened in Finland since then, but the immediate pushback from any government organization to Ubi is, how are we going to pay for this? And Andrew Yang has a lot of interesting ideas about how you do that, and none of them revolve around taxing billionaires, by the way. So something to look into. But anyway, that's Ubi, and it's the kind of the noble cause that sits underneath worldcoin.
00:07:18.194 - 00:08:04.738, Speaker A: They don't specifically say that is what we're going to do. They have some other ambitions as well. But Ubi certainly sits in there, and it's probably not a bad piece of marketing for them to adopt that idea. Now, the challenge around all of this is, and it's very much a core piece of the world coin offering, and that is, how do you ensure that only new users receive the currency? How do you ensure that? As we know, airdrop and bounty hunters don't just go and hoover up multiple instances of this effective airdrop. Their solution, biometric verification. So Iris recognition with zero knowledge cryptography creates what they call proof of person. So we know that you are a unique individual that signed up for cryptocurrency.
00:08:04.738 - 00:08:55.958, Speaker A: Now, it's important to state here that they're not saying we have a record of who you are and where you live and a bunch of other data. We simply have a scan of your iris that allows us to know whether or not you have already claimed your world coin. That's the core principle here. They're not saying we need to know who you are. It's simply saying in our database, because it is a database, we have a record of an iris scan. And that iris scan did or did not claim worldcoin. And the way they do that is by using this device here called the orb, which is this sleek, glossy, kind of compelling, circular object with its chrome surfaces and its green glowing light around it.
00:08:55.958 - 00:09:17.242, Speaker A: This was designed by Thomas Meyhofer. Thomas Meyerhoffer has designed things for Porsche and Apple. He's an industrial designer. He makes beautiful, compelling objects. That's what he does. So the orb captures a detailed image of your eye, then it converts it to an iris hash. Then that code is stored in the database, which is how the project checks for uniqueness.
00:09:17.242 - 00:09:49.586, Speaker A: So you can't just go and scan your eye and then scan it again? And scan it again. So that's basically it. And you can see here some of the guts of the machine and how there's some kind of snazzy gifs on their website that explode the diagram and then bring it back together. It's all kind of very heavily into the fetishization of the hardware component. So worldcoin plans to ramp up production to 4000 orbs per year. Per month. Apologies.
00:09:49.586 - 00:10:34.694, Speaker A: And then these are going to be produced in Germany, and then they're looking to produce around 50,000 of them a year. And these things are kind of premium devices. Who gets their hands on them? Well, that's the Orb operators. So orb operators are basically sales reps for worldcoin, except they're not sales reps because they are independent operators. They're franchise owners, really. And they can sign up to bid for an orb because they can't just get one, you have to bid for one. And then you basically get this device, and it's up to you to go onto the streets, into community centers, wherever it is that you think you can sign up users and then sign them up.
00:10:34.694 - 00:11:35.770, Speaker A: And your job is not just to sign up, it's also to proselytize, which may or may not be the right word here. Maybe advocate is the better word. But when you see what this looks like, proselytize kind of is the right word, because there is an onboarding process here which is getting people who are not in cryptocurrency to sign up and be part of cryptocurrency. That necessitates proselytizing the ethos and the spirit and philosophy of cryptocurrency that is proselytizing. It's not just charity muggers in the street getting you to sign up for UNICEF and giving â‚¬3 a month. This is a fundamental mind shift exercise, and it finishes with the target looking into the orb and having their iris scan. Now, I'm trying to make it sound as non threatening as I can, but even by doing that, you can start to see why this is problematic.
00:11:35.770 - 00:12:05.230, Speaker A: So in their documentation, they say the operators are tasked with explaining Worldcoin to new users. So there's this process. Explain cryptocurrency, explain Worldcoin. And the shill here is, would you like some free cash? That's it. And we'll get on to how much free cash it actually is. But that's basically the shill. So orb operators get a one month contract.
00:12:05.230 - 00:12:38.222, Speaker A: So they have a month to prove that they're good at running the orb, and then after the end of that month, they have to rebid for the contract. Now, can you start to see the problems with this? There's a pilot program running at the moment in five different countries. We'll look at which ones those are. And so people are kind of running these things and they're starting to see the data about how many people you can sign up. But there are incentives for signing people up. So you get a small reward in worldcoin for doing so. The more users you sign up, obviously, the more you get.
00:12:38.222 - 00:13:24.762, Speaker A: But those rewards decay over time. So the earlier you are, the more rewards you will get. At the end of the month, when you have to rebid for the contract, bids will be given to those who bid higher. And obviously, the more successful you are at signing people up, the more collateral you will have to bid higher and maintain the contract. Starting to see where this gets problematic again. So you have this front loaded mechanism whereby those who are successful early will start to monopolize the franchises around the orbs, and it will then become, yeah, they'll become incumbents and be able to lock up more and more orbs. Now, this is encouraging people to become entrepreneurs and to run businesses around these franchises.
00:13:24.762 - 00:13:55.126, Speaker A: And that in itself isn't necessarily bad, but you keep stumbling across these things with this project where you're like, did they have to do it like this. And I don't know if they did. So this is what the sign up process looks like in the field. So they've been running these field tests with the orbs. This orb is this shiny chrome thing. It reflects everything around it. It looks futuristic, it looks Sci-Fi it looks like it doesn't belong in the environment that it's in.
00:13:55.126 - 00:14:13.150, Speaker A: It's dystopian. Now, there is a reason for this. It's the magpie effect. They want people to come and have a look at this shiny thing because they believe people are fundamentally drawn to shiny things. And you think that I'm just making this up. But Alex Blanier, who's one of the co founders, actually said this. Actually said this.
00:14:13.150 - 00:14:44.600, Speaker A: So they're running pilots in Chile, Kenya, Indonesia, Sudan and France. Anything strike you about those particular countries? Yes, these are almost all emerging countries. Sudan has just had a coup. Indonesia, Kenya, Chile, France is obviously the exception. Here in France, they're running specifically with students. So they're running a student program there to test that out. But you can see here, the Kenyan one there in the street, the indonesian one is a bunch of old women.
00:14:44.600 - 00:15:17.566, Speaker A: Can you see it? Are you there with this? If you saw this on the street, would you walk over and wonder what was going on? I suspect you probably would. It just looks weird, right. So this is what's happening. These people are signing up for a world coin wallet which they will receive and then they will receive some world coin tokens. So the onboarding rate is. Well, I mean, I'll let you be the judge of that. Their goal is to get towards a billion sign ups and beyond.
00:15:17.566 - 00:15:56.686, Speaker A: So far, I believe they've had 60,000 sign ups and the best performing operators have been able to onboard around 1000 users per orb per week. With our best performing operator even signing up 2198 users in one week with a single orb. Now, these numbers for this project are incredibly important. Explosive growth, explosive sign up, explosive onboarding, network effects. That's what they're after here. So the best forming operator is in Indonesia and signed up over 30,000 users in a little over four months. So whoever that was on busy, busy, busy, busy B.
00:15:56.686 - 00:16:43.206, Speaker A: And his first week as an operator, he set the highest single weekly sign up total and has partnered with one of the biggest food delivery countries in the country to sign up. Its drivers rented out a storefront and a shopping mall to capitalize on high foot traffic and has even been invited to a nearby village to sign up all those who live there to worldcoin his time signing up the village was so successful that it resulted in eight other villages asking him to do the same. Define success, please define success. So does this sound like multilevel marketing? Well, of course it does. That's exactly what it sounds like, because that is in fact what it is. So it's hard not to be cynical about this, but let's try and keep going. So this token itself is WLD world coin.
00:16:43.238 - 00:16:43.946, Speaker B: There's going to be a fixed supply.
00:16:43.978 - 00:17:23.370, Speaker A: Of 10 billion tokens. 20% of those are going to be used to fund ore production and the initial protocol development, that's a pre mine, by the way. If you get this world coin, you don't get all of it in one lump sum. You get 10% upfront and then the rest is dripped to you over the course of two years. And the estimates about of how much it's going to be worth to you are quite rough. It could be $10 or it could be $200 over the course of two years. So in the context of western wages, not a lot.
00:17:23.370 - 00:18:11.610, Speaker A: But I did actually go and look at the minimum wage in Sudan and I apologize if the data is not that robust, but it's interesting that the minimum wage in Sudan is around ninety five cents per month. So that gives you a little bit more of a concept about why $10 might actually be quite significant. And it is 3000 sudanese pounds, or around $6.72 per month for civil servants. So in the context of a country like Sudan, it actually could be significant and it could make a difference. And so you're kind of wondering, well, if you want to airdrop this token to the entire world's population, then maybe people like me that don't necessarily need it could opt to return it back to a fund or put it into something else. Like, I don't know.
00:18:11.610 - 00:18:38.610, Speaker A: If you're scanning all these eyeballs, maybe you could put it into eye research and actually solve the problem of blindness in Africa, for instance. Or put money into that. I don't know. There are certain parts of the world where blindness is a genuine problem and you could do something about that, maybe. So who's behind Worldcoin? Alex Blenier and Sam Altman. Come on, Google Slides. You can do it.
00:18:38.610 - 00:19:19.134, Speaker A: There we go. So Alex Benier and Sam Altman are the head hondos. They're the figureheads of this project. Altman was the former president of Y Combinator, co founder and CEO of OpenAI, which is a project whose aim is to make sure that AI is used for the good of humanity and not for ill and for driving us all into obscurity and infinite destruction. The project also had $25 million worth of funding from Andreessen Horowitz, from Coinbase, from Reed Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, and Sam Bankman Fried. And that valued this company, Worldcoin, at a billion dollars. We shouldn't really call it a company because it's not.
00:19:19.134 - 00:20:10.618, Speaker A: It's a decentralized network, decentralized currency with a foundation that's going to get 20% of the tokens. So 2 billion world coin tokens will be going to the foundation? Yes, they will. And. Sorry. There we go. Sam Altman bears a striking resemblance to this young man, does he not? So there was a lot of pushback on weldcoin from the likes of Edward Snowden, who saw the collection of eyeballs, the cataloging of eyeballs, as deeply problematic. Dan Dartbill, the legendary trader, picked up on the pre mine aspect of it, that it creates an area of centralization that's deeply problematic.
00:20:10.618 - 00:21:13.198, Speaker A: Mulvey landed on the idea that extreme surveillance and compliance measures in response to the pandemic, combined with irresponsible centralized banking policies suggest now is not the time for a biometric coin corporation. And there's this sense that worldcoin themselves were kind of just not with it when it came to the optics of this project. Like designing this item that looks like it's literally born in a dystopian Sci-Fi movie calling it Worldcoin, which, if you're going to come up with a name for an evil coin or an evil corporation in a Pixar film, well, you call it world coin, but that's exactly what they did. They call it Worldcoin. It's the coin for the world. It feels, know Michael Jackson, heal the world, make it a better place. You know what I'm saying? So Sam Alban himself said, I definitely underestimated the visceral reaction to using biometrics for identity verification.
00:21:13.198 - 00:22:02.722, Speaker A: And I was surprised to hear from people who don't. And it didn't come through in Worldcoin's field tests. Interesting update for me. Every single person that I have seen that came into contact with this just went, that's weird. Did nobody at any point say, oh, this looks creepy at any point? Or did they just ram it through and say, yeah, we're just going to do this because we're just going to do it? There are some data privacy concerns as well, particularly around GDPR. If you live in Europe, GDPR protects you, doesn't apply in the US. So if you're a european citizen and you agree to give up your data, particularly your iris hash, then it's entirely possible that worldcoin themselves can do something about it that you may not like.
00:22:02.722 - 00:22:36.414, Speaker A: Sorry, I meant Worldcoin. So there's this quote from Alex Bonneo where he was talking about specifically the orb itself, and he says, it's the first contact for users. Right. We just wanted to make it really, really cool and really, really exciting. And by making it shiny, it gets people's attentions and they see their reflection as they stand there. It's a very cool and memorable experience. Doesn't that just feel completely disconnected from reality right now? There is a danger, of course, that we all become too woke about everything.
00:22:36.414 - 00:23:15.286, Speaker A: And I understand those who are perturbed by just how woke things can get, but this just seems incredibly tone deaf. It just feels like a bunch of people got on a room, went, wow, you're so good at tech. No, you're so good at tech. You're so good at tech. No, you're so good at tech. You know what I'm saying? So, listen, I did the best job I could with being relatively objective about it, but it's incredibly difficult. This whole idea of network effect, of spreading things as far wide as possible, was a very web two concept.
00:23:15.286 - 00:24:20.446, Speaker A: Facebook, et cetera, proved the benefits of massive networks operating at scale. And it has seemed to be the paradigm for blockchain networks that we need to scale as rapidly as possible, get these tokens into the hands of as many people as possible. But there's this growing idea that actually, that's not how this works. That small clusters, even temporary clusters of ideas and energy and economic value popping up and then disappearing, popping up and disappearing. But being connected within a broader network that is interconnected, is a much more holistic and interesting and healthy way of creating network effects than the kind of one size fits all vision that is being produced here. And I can't help feeling that this is the web two paradigm being used to ram through something. And it's interesting when you look at the blurb itself and you look at this long 19 minutes, read how the launch works.
00:24:20.446 - 00:25:20.942, Speaker A: So much of it is about the tech, it's about the hardware. And so very little indeed is about what we will use Worldcoin for, what the vision for the use case of it actually is. It's shoehorning in a multi level marketing scheme with a glossy thing and then a bunch of really problematic biometric data privacy concerns. And that's why people have been kind of pissed off about it, and I get it. I would love to say that the vision for this thing, the ideas are groundbreaking and should be supported, but it seems to me that they just didn't listen to the concerns that people had when they first raised them and just went ahead with it anyway. And any entity that's looking to do that and brute force a product into people's hands, I think we now are within our rights to be very mistrustful of that. And that is where I shall leave it.
00:25:20.942 - 00:25:33.410, Speaker A: If you have any suggestions what we should cover on first look, please do drop them in the comments below. This was I got a new toy. Can you tell? I'll see you on the next one. Peace.
