00:00:00.170 - 00:00:07.360, Speaker A: Why do you think Satoshi never touched the bitcoin? Do you think they destroyed their keys out of fear of the government?
00:00:07.730 - 00:01:42.222, Speaker B: My thesis is that the million or so bitcoin that are believed to have been mined by Satoshi were mined not because they had any intention of spending them, but rather because they had a dedicated custom mining machine. I mean, it was probably just a regular PC, but it definitely had custom mining software on it, and that they were using this machine for the first couple of years of the bitcoin network's existence, essentially as a heartbeat. It was basically to ensure that the blocks would keep getting mined at regular intervals, regardless of how many other people were mining. So this was essentially a bootstrapping mechanism that they used. And you can look at the hash rate of the supposed Satoshi miner, and you can see that as other miners joined the network over that first couple year period, the Satoshi miner would actually intentionally in step functions, decrease their own hash rate. So if Satoshi was trying to maximize the amount of coins that they were mining, which wouldn't really make sense because they had no value at the time, nobody knew what was going to happen. But if they were trying to maximize their total number of coins, then they would have kept going full steam ahead at 100% of their hash power.
00:01:42.222 - 00:02:11.826, Speaker B: There's also pretty conclusive evidence that this machine was powered off half of the time, that the machine would stop mining for about five minutes after it found a block. And I think part of the reason for that is Satoshi didn't want to overwhelm the network. They wanted to give plenty of possibilities, opportunities for other miners to come in and join and get some rewards and start being able to play around with bitcoin.

00:02:42.212 - 00:02:47.134, Speaker D: Tools, you just need to connect to one simple DAp to navigate your web3 journey.
00:02:47.262 - 00:02:54.322, Speaker A: So you think it was fully altruistic, but then don't you think there would still be a temptation to want to spend that at some point?
00:02:54.456 - 00:03:40.430, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely. I mean, it's difficult to imagine anyone sitting on billions and billions of dollars and not doing anything with it. On the flip side, though. If I try to put myself in Satoshi's shoes, I probably wouldn't touch it either, because it's basically impossible to do in a private sense. If you believe that all of the powerful nation states of the world are looking at this and going to be trying to track it and trace any movements back to you and your identity, it would be a really weird situation to be in. On one hand, you're theoretically one of the richest people in the world. On the other hand, if you try to spend your money, you put your life in tense danger.
