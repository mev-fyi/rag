00:00:23.690 - 00:01:04.500, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone. It's to another weekly recap with the Defiant. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. We're here with YYC Trader, our head of news, Jeremy Nation and Owen for now, our staff, reporters and myself, Camarusso, the founder of the Defiant. And we'll be going over all of the biggest headlines and news of Defi and crypto this week. So some of the biggest topics we'll cover. The SEC delayed the decision on the bitcoin ETF, which made markets erase all of the gains we saw this week.
00:01:04.500 - 00:01:42.270, Speaker A: And Grayscale had won a legal challenge against the SEC, which had spurred those games, but again, which were just erased. Unisoft class action lawsuit was dismissed and Twitter gets money transmitter license hinting at potential payment app built on top of the social media network. Crypto payments incoming, maybe. So those are some of the biggest headlines we'll be covering. YYC, why don't you start us off with the market action?
00:01:43.730 - 00:03:02.134, Speaker B: Sure. So after a summer of very low volatility, we've seen quite the roller coaster over the last ten days or so. So early on in the week, we got some great news in the form of Grayscale winning a legal challenge against the SEC. Basically what the case was all about was that the SEC denied Grayscale's application to turn GBTC from a closed ended exchange traded product of some sort into an ETF which would be able to be more freely traded with daily rebalancing and essentially trade closer to its net asset value. That's one of the biggest problem with GBTC, is that it's been trading at a discount to its NAv, simply because there's no way to redeem the shares for the underlying bitcoin anyway. So the SEC denied that, and so Grayscale sued them and the judge came out and said yes. The SEC acted capriciously, and especially given the fact that they did approve two bitcoin futures based ETFs last year.
00:03:02.134 - 00:03:03.560, Speaker B: Or was it this year?
00:03:05.210 - 00:03:06.358, Speaker C: It was last year.
00:03:06.444 - 00:03:46.820, Speaker B: It was last year, right? Yeah. So based on that, I believe the judge said that the SEC should review its decision. And that's basically it. It didn't say that the SEC needs to approve it or anything beyond saying that it should be reviewed and that the SEC just denied it in contravention of whatever regulations. So markets cheered that we rallied. Bitcoin was up 7% in a matter of minutes. I'd say that's one of the biggest green candles we've seen in a long, long time.
00:03:46.820 - 00:04:26.670, Speaker B: Sentiment was all bullish. It's like, oh, yeah, ETFs are coming. I believe there were some analysts who put the ODs of approval in 2023 at 75% or something. Right. Which might still happen. I mean, the year is far from over. And yesterday the SEC basically came out and said, we need more time and the decisions on the ETF applications from Blackrock, wisdom tree and Vesco, like a bunch of big investment management firms, which was supposed to be decided on, I believe it was on the third or 4 September was the deadline.
00:04:26.670 - 00:05:04.880, Speaker B: They've not that by another 45 days to mid October at the earliest. I mean, this is the SEC. They can delay and do it again if they want to. I mean, the law is on their side, right? There's no compulsion for them to act within a specific period of time. And, yeah, so all the gains that we saw on Tuesday and kind of into Wednesday were all wiped out yesterday afternoon. And in terms of the weekly candle, it's pretty much flat. And the monthly doesn't look too great.
00:05:04.880 - 00:05:25.300, Speaker B: Traditionally or historically, August and September are the weakest months for all markets. And of course, with everyone getting back from summer holidays and getting back to their trading desks, I'm sure we'll see more volatility in the days and weeks to.
00:05:29.910 - 00:06:09.646, Speaker C: Was. Jake Chavinsky, who's been on the podcast, did note that the SEC was arguing that Grayscale's proposed ETF didn't adequately protect against fraud and manipulation, and having that struck down would end a reasoning of the SEC which had been going on. Know, he said, a full decade, that's been their reason for denying an. So interesting. It'll be interesting to see what the SEC comes back with for these future rulings.
00:06:09.838 - 00:06:25.334, Speaker B: Absolutely. And why are ETFs, I mean, why is the crypto community so crazy about a spot ETF? Just go and look at the price of gold after the first ETF was approved back in, I believe, 2003, 2004, maybe.
00:06:25.452 - 00:06:26.310, Speaker C: Oh, really?
00:06:26.460 - 00:06:58.370, Speaker B: Yeah, because this basically means that a whole bunch of funds around the world are forced to own this asset because it exists as an ETF, and it's supposed to be like part of an ideal asset allocation. So you have these flows of basically passive capital, right, which just keep flowing into these ETFs month over month as people's 401 ks get funded, et cetera, et cetera. So it's a massive kind of floor under any asset.
00:07:00.470 - 00:07:01.294, Speaker D: Indeed.
00:07:01.422 - 00:07:02.100, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:04.470 - 00:07:05.380, Speaker C: Go ahead.
00:07:05.690 - 00:08:03.474, Speaker A: Wouldn't bitcoin and crypto have to be a part of a portfolio composition in the first place for that to happen? I'm not arguing against the fact that having an ETF approval would be huge. But I think for gold, maybe it was a bit different because precious metals were already accepted as part of sound portfolio composition. I don't know if crypto is there yet. I think first, traditional asset managers have to accept that, okay, a portfolio should have 10% of crypto or 5% or whatever it is they want to allocate. And then from there, you can expect this kind of floor for just, like, passive flows into this ETF.
00:08:03.522 - 00:08:19.082, Speaker B: So that's happening already. There were a bunch of investment banks. We did a story on it, I think, a couple of months ago, where a big asset manager came out and said crypto or bitcoin should be part of. I think it was 5% of an ideal high net worth.
00:08:19.136 - 00:08:42.594, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, it's like that discussion. People are slowly coming around to that idea. So, yeah, I'm not sure we're there yet where the biggest asset managers just accept that crypto should be a part of a portfolio. I think there's a lot of resistance against that, but I agree they are coming around to that.
00:08:42.712 - 00:08:43.940, Speaker D: And once you need.
00:08:44.710 - 00:08:55.720, Speaker B: If they can earn fees from it, and if they have demand for it from people who are actually holding money from it, they'll do it. They'll trade like toxic waste if there's demand for it.
00:08:57.210 - 00:08:59.320, Speaker A: Well, literally, they are.
00:09:03.390 - 00:09:05.194, Speaker B: They just go where the incentives are.
00:09:05.232 - 00:09:06.300, Speaker A: Right. Of course.
00:09:06.830 - 00:09:09.770, Speaker D: And once one exists, there will be an incentive.
00:09:10.610 - 00:09:24.190, Speaker B: I think fidelity just put out a report yesterday or two days ago about the case for ETH as. What was it? Emerging money. Or, I mean, there's a new meme.
00:09:24.270 - 00:09:26.740, Speaker A: Not sound money anymore. Emerging money.
00:09:27.110 - 00:09:29.940, Speaker B: I think they refer to ultrasound money as well in the report.
00:09:32.070 - 00:09:35.380, Speaker A: Interesting. What's the argument for emerging money?
00:09:36.810 - 00:09:47.080, Speaker B: Basically, the arguments that we see on Ct all the time, deflationary asset yield, bearing, et cetera, et cetera. Used as unit of count in the.
00:09:49.930 - 00:10:06.960, Speaker A: Interesting. I mean, I'm sure after we have a bitcoin ETF, then the whole crypto tutor and speculation is going to move to, okay, now, when ETH ETF, that's going to be kind of the next.
00:10:08.290 - 00:10:18.914, Speaker B: And the applications have already been filed. Right. So I'm sure it'll be quite close to each other, like we saw with the futures as well.
00:10:18.952 - 00:10:29.030, Speaker A: Right? Exactly. There's, like, no timeline for the SEC to actually provide an answer. Like, who knows?
00:10:30.330 - 00:10:42.986, Speaker C: Yeah. Why say, were you saying that you think if a bitcoin ETF gets approved, an ETH one will be soon on the heels, you think?
00:10:43.168 - 00:10:43.900, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:10:44.430 - 00:10:45.130, Speaker C: Really?
00:10:45.280 - 00:10:45.642, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:45.696 - 00:10:50.540, Speaker C: They're not categorically separate or moderately distinct from each other?
00:10:50.910 - 00:11:17.060, Speaker B: Not particularly, I'd say, in terms of trading volumes and stuff, which is what the SEC is supposed to focus on. Right. So there's no manipulation and stuff. So it's not illiquid. I'd say, like, daily transaction volumes are probably comparable. All right, so, yeah, I don't see a reason why they would approve bitcoin and not eat, especially since we have running futures products for both. Yeah.
00:11:17.530 - 00:11:19.560, Speaker C: Okay, fair enough.
00:11:20.410 - 00:11:27.910, Speaker A: Okay, let's move on to the next headline, the Unisoft labs class action lawsuit.
00:11:28.910 - 00:12:29.046, Speaker C: Okay, yeah, I can take this. God, it feels like that was two years ago. I guess that was maybe literally two days ago. On August 29, we found out that Judge Catherine, I'm not going to pronounce that. Right. Of the Southern District of New York, of New York dismissed a class action lawsuit against Uniswap and a bunch of people who invested in mean, I guess the big exciting thing was that the plaintiffs were arguing that uniswap had facilitated these scam tokens. And I don't know exactly the legal language they used, but basically that they got scammed and uniswap facilitated that, and the judge threw it out on the basis of, look, they're just operating this decentralized software.
00:12:29.046 - 00:13:35.246, Speaker C: They didn't endorse any of these. Um, so that was the big thing that the judge seemed to exhibit a pretty high degree of understanding of decentralized finance, understood the difference between operating an interface and operating the software in and of itself, and also took some shots at Congress and the lack of regulatory clarity that many people in crypto have criticized for seemingly years. So that's, that's the big know. And also just one other point to note is that this judge will be presiding over the SEC's case with Coinbase. So it's definitely, I think, encouraging to people in crypto that the judge at least has a moderately sophisticated understanding of what it means, what decentralization means. And uniswap is maybe one of the best in terms of, I think it's, like, non upgradable. So it's kind of a good bellwether for the rest of the industry.
00:13:35.246 - 00:13:46.822, Speaker C: So that was, that, I think, definitely encouraging for crypto proponents. And, yeah, I don't know what you guys took out of it, but that was the main high level take for me.
00:13:46.956 - 00:14:06.250, Speaker D: I mean, it's certainly a win to see a judge exhibiting knowledge of the crypto space and some of the dearth of regulatory clarity that we have and the knowledge that this individual is going to be presiding over the Coinbase case. Suggests to me at least that we may see some justice from the Justice Department.
00:14:07.550 - 00:14:16.270, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll see. But, yeah, encouraging to see that happen, I think for the DeFi proponents.
00:14:16.610 - 00:15:17.934, Speaker A: Yeah. Because it does imply two things. Like, one, they see that uniswap is actually decentralized. It's actually decentralized and not controlled by a centralized entity. So that's like the first step, that this is what they see that they're arguing, okay, this is actually a Dex, because a lot of kind of the questioning around Defi is that it's actually not decentralized. So in this case, they actually see that. And then the next positive step for DeFi is that, okay, not only do they recognize uniswap as decentralized enough or actually decentralized, they also are ruling that the activity that happens on a decentralized protocol isn't the responsibility of the developers of that protocol.
00:15:17.934 - 00:16:15.814, Speaker A: So if there are scammers issuing rug pools on uniswap, that's not uniswap developers fault, or the protocol developer shouldn't take any responsibility for that. And I don't think that argument, which is pretty consensus within crypto. I don't think it's consensus outside of it. I think there's a lot of debate over whether that's true. And I think the best example is tornado cash, which we've talked about here. It's like, okay, yeah, tornado developers did this, but they built this tool, but they don't have responsibility over how that's used. And in that case, that didn't go in the developer's favor, but in this case it did.
00:16:15.814 - 00:16:27.000, Speaker A: So I think there's not consensus outside of crypto that's the case. So it's interesting that for Uniswap, it went their way.
00:16:27.390 - 00:16:44.766, Speaker B: I think an important factor here is the fee switch. Uniswap did not profit from these scam coin transactions. If the fee switch was on and uni token holders got a cut of those trading fees, the decision might have been different.
00:16:44.948 - 00:16:58.158, Speaker C: I think that's interesting you said that about tornado cash last week. I think that was what I see, that you thought the torn token had a lot to do with the tornado cash ruling. Yeah, the charges.
00:16:58.254 - 00:17:25.530, Speaker B: I mean, just logically to me, if you're seeking damages from someone, they should have profited from this said activity that you lost out from. Right. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense. I think that's one of the core kind of principles of common law. Right. Damages must be kind of proven. So the fact here that uniswap, neither Uniswap labs nor Uni token holders, no one except the LPs in those particular pools, made money from those trades.
00:17:25.530 - 00:17:35.740, Speaker B: I think that could have played a factor. I'm not sure if it might be buried somewhere in the decision itself, but.
00:17:36.610 - 00:17:53.906, Speaker C: If it isn't, no. That makes a lot of sense intuitively to people coming in. It's like, yeah, if they're not incentivized for those trades to happen, I can see why uniswap comes out looking much cleaner than if they're taking a fee on that.
00:17:54.088 - 00:19:01.930, Speaker D: I'm curious, this ruling, I wonder how it might bear in terms of the interpretation of the Treasury Department's most recent handed down prospective regulations that may affect decentralized exchanges in terms of KYC. Here we have a judge saying that this decentralized exchange is not responsible for the things that people did on it. Here we have another entity saying that decentralized exchanges may be seen as brokers in the crypto sense, and thus be responsible for gathering information on people that transact on them for the purposes of reporting. If there's legislative or, sorry, if there's a judicial ruling that says uniswaps off the hook for that type of thing, will it run afoul of the IRS's attempt to gather that information or force uniswap to gather that information? I'm really curious to see how that plays out. And if there are other judicial actions that perhaps reinforce or go against what has been handed down by the treasury department in the years coming before this enforcement.
00:19:03.950 - 00:19:40.246, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it'll be messy. I mean, I'm glad that uniswap is one of the protocols kind of in the limelight, just because I think I was talking to a developer like years ago, but she was like, yes, the contracts aren't upgradable, from my understanding. So it's also just very different in terms of. I don't know. I mean, I could see there being like sleazier exchanges where it's like, yeah, they are trying to pump volume or something, but uniswap is big enough that they don't need any one scam token. They're. They're actually solidly decentralized, I think, in terms of.
00:19:40.246 - 00:19:52.060, Speaker C: Or their contracts are solidly autonomous. Plus, they're not making money on trades right now. I'm glad Uniswap is not a bad flag bearer, I would say.
00:19:52.990 - 00:20:50.638, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. So, moving on to the next headline, but before we do, I just want to give a shout out to our sponsor, Arch Finance. Arch is a Dap that empowers you to invest in the best of crypto and web three. With ease and confidence, you can invest in risk based portfolios, earn, yield and diversify your holdings, all in a few minutes going through their app. And it's non custodial, so you retain full ownership over your assets. So speaking of ETFs, arch builds tokenized sort of ETFs. Check them out at arch finance and just heads up that they're for non us residents only.
00:20:50.638 - 00:21:21.270, Speaker A: So watching out for regulations there. But yeah, arts finance, check them out. Very cool. Tokenized funds. And yeah, speaking of interesting, defi innovation, link had really impressive growth with a new liquidity model. Owen, sorry, you want to take it?
00:21:21.420 - 00:21:50.138, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll start. Although shout out to YYC, he was the one who surfaced this for us. So I definitely can't take credit for digging into the kind of lower cap tokens and finding this. But I can summarize. So yes, Link is a new protocol, new paradigm. They even say that in there. I looked at their code on Etherscan, they said they're a new paradigm.
00:21:50.138 - 00:23:06.390, Speaker C: Whether or not they are remains to be seen. But fundamentally, the primary mechanism for the token is you trade between trading between ETH and this token. Link or link ETH, there's a 6% tax, 3% of the tax is converted into LP tokens, which the holders of link can claim. So basically there's like, as people trade into the asset or out of it, there's a stream of liquidity being purchased by the protocol, which then can be claimed by link holders, with the end result being that not only are you buying link when you buy the token, you are also buying a stream of LP tokens. It's interesting, I won't claim to have thought through what that actually means, whether it's sustainable, but that is how it works. And it's kind of interesting because liquidity providing is maybe a bit more sophisticated than just like holding spot. So you're giving people this kind of revenue generating asset as well as the spot asset.
00:23:06.390 - 00:23:26.560, Speaker C: It'll be interesting to see where it goes. I don't know what your guys'thoughts are. I mean, there's kind of a lot to talk about in terms of whether it's sustainable, whether it matters. People have messed around with liquidity in the past, but yeah, it's interesting, kind of distributing it to the community instead of kind of trying to incentivize it through a pool or something like that.
00:23:27.570 - 00:23:33.006, Speaker D: Well, you run the risk of them selling of the link team, it's completely.
00:23:33.108 - 00:23:59.542, Speaker B: Opposite protocol owned liquidity. Right. Where the protocol owns nothing and you're handing it out to LPs. I think it's a cool experiment. One thing that plays into it, especially on main net, is gas fees. So you do end up with a lot of sticky liquidity from small holders for whom, if you airdrop them $50 worth of LP, it's going to cost going anywhere more than that to unwind it back into tokens and ETH. Right.
00:23:59.542 - 00:24:15.920, Speaker B: It's just going to be sitting there. So does that mean it's a pool of dead capital, or, like you said, is it sustainable or not? We'll have to see. But, yeah, it's just another experiment in the more djen corner of the market.
00:24:16.370 - 00:24:34.770, Speaker D: But if you have capital sitting like that and the price makes any sort of action upwards, it's going to trigger these sell offs of people that were waiting in the wings to be able to make the gas worth their while to take the tokens. So there are going to be some predictable dips after any type of meaningful price action, in my opinion.
00:24:36.330 - 00:24:38.680, Speaker C: Dip. Dips in the price?
00:24:39.210 - 00:24:55.610, Speaker D: Yeah, because as a result of the price going up, suddenly those tokens that have been sitting and the people that dead liquidity, so to speak, people have just been like, I got $50, suddenly I have 500. Well, I'm going to sell it. I'm going to sell some of it, right?
00:24:55.680 - 00:25:23.220, Speaker A: Maybe I'll sell it. That's the case with any token. I guess. I guess maybe the difference is that people feel that they were trapped before reaching a certain level because they couldn't just sell because of gas fees. So, yeah, that would be a difference. But you could also make the case that people will, with any token, will wait until it reaches some certain threshold to cash out.
00:25:23.910 - 00:25:46.220, Speaker D: Well, yes, but in this case, you've got like a pool of them, literally fish in a barrel, that you know are going to cash out. Now, it's different from having vested. A company that sets up a token has the team allocation that's vested. I like how they've taken that team allocation and distributed to the community. It's very interesting model, right?
00:25:47.070 - 00:26:09.330, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's interesting because it's self sustaining. It's like transactions generate this tax that goes into the liquidity pool, and then that liquidity pool gets distributed further with holders.
00:26:10.790 - 00:26:37.980, Speaker B: It all boils down to fresh capital keeps coming in. It's very similar to previous defi tokenomic designs that we've seen. So you won't get taxes. Unless people trade into the pool. Right. And why are they trading? Either they're getting in, which is good for the growth of the project, or they're getting out, which means it's like potential debt spiral. Still early days.
00:26:37.980 - 00:27:18.294, Speaker B: Yeah. I think one of the biggest things that they're looking to solve, or at least they claim to, is that one of the biggest ways you get scammed with coins is when the deployer, who generally owns most of the liquidity, pulls it and runs away like the bald deployer did on base chain. So in this case, with the deployer owning barely anything and the LP kind of spread out across, what is it, 1000 holders or so? Yeah, it's a lot more predictable. It's harder for one big whale to just drain the pool and run.
00:27:18.492 - 00:27:43.474, Speaker C: Yeah, it might be an interesting mechanism that could be part of another token. Right. To your point, why? I say, yeah, I don't know if it's just reliant on more capital to get those fees, but if this can be tacked on to a token, which is used in different ways, I mean, maybe it's an interesting mechanism, but I'm not sure about it being the end all, be all for link.
00:27:43.672 - 00:27:44.420, Speaker D: True.
00:27:45.270 - 00:27:58.020, Speaker A: What is link? I read your story, Owen, and yeah, it was interesting about the token design. But what actually does the project do?
00:27:58.950 - 00:28:11.674, Speaker C: I mean, it makes you money. What does any project in crypto do? You buy the thing and it makes you money. Cam, you don't have to.
00:28:11.712 - 00:28:16.010, Speaker A: Okay, so it's a project that's. No, it has to do something other than.
00:28:16.080 - 00:28:17.958, Speaker D: It's a liquidity protocol.
00:28:18.054 - 00:28:20.780, Speaker A: See, and you need liquidity for.
00:28:22.190 - 00:28:30.110, Speaker B: No, no, they have an ambitious roadmap. There's a social app and there's a bunch of other stuff.
00:28:30.260 - 00:28:31.390, Speaker D: A roadmap.
00:28:31.810 - 00:28:35.120, Speaker A: The roadmap. Okay, sorry.
00:28:37.650 - 00:28:39.854, Speaker D: Everyone's still in the bear market, guys.
00:28:39.972 - 00:29:04.602, Speaker C: I know. Yeah, no, it's true. I shouldn't laugh. They have it. And why would you remind me? There is a whole phase two, which is kind of touching on, at least in the documentation, like kind of amalgamating a lot of different avenues, like Twitter, etherscan, uniswap, kind of talking about how it's pretty vague in my opinion, but kind of gathering that together in one app so people don't bounce around.
00:29:04.736 - 00:29:05.786, Speaker A: And to be fair, a lot of.
00:29:05.808 - 00:29:12.074, Speaker D: These tokens launch and get Runway from this type of thing and then develop into meaningful apps with some vagueness and ambiguity.
00:29:12.122 - 00:30:18.546, Speaker A: So that's how it is. I don't know if there's any link fans or team members. Sorry for laughing. To me it is kind of a red flag when the main thing about a project is their tokenomics. My personal opinion is that a project should have some sort of value of there should be something there, some use case, some utility that they're giving to users and have that be proven out and have some product market fit, as VCs love to say. And then you can experiment with token design and make it better and so on. But if you're not delivering any value, any utility at first, and you're trying to make the token design itself be the utility or give you enough Runway, yeah, I don't know.
00:30:18.546 - 00:31:11.026, Speaker A: That doesn't sound very sustainable to me. To me, just like the utility should come first and then you can experiment with the token because as he was saying, you need liquidity for this thing to work. And the reason why a token would get liquidity is because people are using it for something. But if there's nothing to use it for, where would people buy it other than to get whatever fees they can out of this? And again, it's like the same criticism I've been saying for a while. It's just like this casino, it turns into this just like speculative game, which I'm sick of anyways, end of rant. All right, let's move on.
00:31:11.208 - 00:31:21.670, Speaker B: We have to fill the PvP narrative with something, right? People got tired of just meme coins, so now they're like meme coins with narratives and utility.
00:31:24.650 - 00:31:28.970, Speaker C: It's categorically different. It's not a meme coin, it's something else.
00:31:29.120 - 00:31:48.782, Speaker A: Yeah, it's an interesting experiment, but I guess I would just like to see some utility before. Just like the interesting tokenomics is all I'm saying. Oh, and you had another really interesting story, this telegram bots taking off. How does this.
00:31:48.836 - 00:32:44.020, Speaker C: Yeah, so kind of maybe along the same lines of why I see you saying of the PvP environment is that people are starting to use telegram bots to snipe early listings of tokens to copy trade. Other people, I think maybe even get in early on NFT mints. And those are happening all kind of within telegram and users. Typically they need to either create a new wallet and seed it with Ethereum or whatever base token, I think generally ethereum, or they need to hand over their primary private key. So it's a little dangerous. But these are getting a lot of users and we're up to like, I think 93,000 users right now. I think it was about like 88,000 when I wrote the story.
00:32:44.020 - 00:33:37.002, Speaker C: And that is where we're at, someone was saying, yeah, I talked to one guy who's at Banana Gun who I think they work on being able to snipe tokens super early when they launch. And he was saying that basically before it was like just people who really know how to write these bots themselves and they were custom. And now this project banana gun is kind of quote unquote democratizing access to sniping coins super early. I don't know, yyc might have played around with them more or maybe Jeremy or like. But yeah, it's kind of an interesting, it's definitely like the dGen traders trying to make that quick money side of the, you know, that's where we're at right now. It's a bear.
00:33:37.146 - 00:33:41.234, Speaker B: So once you use one of these things, you will never go back to the Uniswap website.
00:33:41.272 - 00:33:43.346, Speaker C: I haven't used one. Really? Okay.
00:33:43.528 - 00:34:21.326, Speaker D: I haven't used one either, but I might want to spin up a wallet, which by the way, full disclosure and disclaimer, haven't ever used one of these things. But if you will never give over your private keys, never give over your private keys, never give over your private keys from your main wallet to anyone, to anything, to any bot, to any person, to your friends, to your family, to your dog. Don't do it. Okay. Spin up a new wallet. It's very easy to do and you can fund that wallet safely from your main wallet without any type of security breach. Operational security is important and people build all sorts of great new fun tools to use.
00:34:21.326 - 00:34:23.460, Speaker D: Be safe when you use them.
00:34:24.470 - 00:34:25.220, Speaker A: Nice.
00:34:25.590 - 00:34:26.050, Speaker C: Agree?
00:34:26.120 - 00:34:30.240, Speaker A: Absolutely. So how do these bots work, by the way?
00:34:31.190 - 00:35:25.042, Speaker B: Pretty simple. Within telegram you just open up a DM with the bot and hit the start command and it gives you this menu of all you need to do is basically once you set it up with your initial settings, initial settings being what's your default purchase amount? How much are you willing to pay slippage wise? How much in gas, et cetera? Once you have that figured out, when a new contract or any new token drops, all you need to do is paste the contract address, hit send, and it does everything for you. And very few transactions fail because these things are really quick. And I mean, using the UI, all you see is that swap failed. Swap failed. I'm so tired of seeing that on the uniswap page. But once I started using one of these things, it's amazing.
00:35:25.176 - 00:35:43.318, Speaker D: I think that has to do with fees and slippage with me on swap fails. Like it has to do with the contract has fees that are set up that I need to set a slippage around. And usually when I do that, no problem. But I'm curious, what is the threshold of slippage that you would say having used it is recommended?
00:35:43.494 - 00:35:51.546, Speaker B: It depends. I mean, most of these tokens have taxes on transfer anyway, like between 5%. So your slippage has to be above that.
00:35:51.648 - 00:35:52.298, Speaker D: Okay.
00:35:52.464 - 00:35:57.040, Speaker B: In any case. And if you're trying to go early, you have to set something like 30, 35%.
00:35:57.410 - 00:36:01.550, Speaker D: Do these bots have any type of exposure to Mev?
00:36:02.710 - 00:36:55.090, Speaker B: I think they have some protection in built. The devs are pretty forward thinking when it comes to these things. And it's not just telegram now, there are bots that you can use in discord. There are bots not just for trading, for posting social media posts, for gambling, sports betting, all kinds of coingecko even has a sector dedicated to these bots now. So I think it's just people kind of leveling up their trading game, I guess. Because if you have these tools available and most of them are free to at least get started with, you have to pay for premium features, but free to get started with, and they charge like a fee out of the transaction. I think it's 1%, 2% it's worth doing if you're trading these meme coins.
00:36:55.590 - 00:37:04.446, Speaker A: And the use case is getting in early. Right? It's just like being the first to buy a coin when it launches.
00:37:04.558 - 00:37:48.914, Speaker B: Yeah, if not first, early at least, right? Because if you've seen any of these meme coin launches, like that first candle will take it from, I don't know, 50K market cap to say three hundred K. And while you're trying to buy and everyone else is trying to buy, and if you're using the uniswap front end, you're going to get fails time and again until the price kind of settles down, by which time it's too late. So this definitely helps. It's not like a magic bullet. You still can fail if there's too many people rushing for the same coin. It's like super hyped or whatever, but it definitely makes it easier to use. And a lot of them have these analytics tools built in as well.
00:37:48.914 - 00:38:18.730, Speaker B: So you can put in any contract address and it'll tell you it's got these heat maps which show you okay, off the top 50 or the first 50 holders, how many are still holding, how many have sold, how many have partially sold? So you know how many people are waiting to dump on you if you're entering at a given price. So I tend to wait until most of the early buyers have been cleared out. So the first, 2nd or third sell off, that's when I'll try and enter if I've missed the initial snipe.
00:38:19.470 - 00:38:26.014, Speaker A: And it's like you interact directly with telegram, like you give telegram commands, I guess.
00:38:26.132 - 00:39:10.140, Speaker B: Exactly. You don't even touch metamask or anything, so these things create a wallet for you. So obviously, like Jeremy said, just fund it with a tiny bit of know that you're willing to play with. And yeah, if you make profits, just keep withdrawing as you go along. Never leave like substantial amounts of ETH in these bots because to be honest, I have no idea how they work behind the scenes. I just know that it works in telegram. So I'm sure most of the users are the same because all of us are basically the people who saw hyped NfT mints get sold out or like tokens get sniped in front of our eyes and we couldn't do anything about it back then, but we can.
00:39:12.110 - 00:39:21.534, Speaker A: I guess they would be interacting directly with the smart contract. They're not going, I don't know. Yeah, I don't have no idea how it works either.
00:39:21.652 - 00:39:25.490, Speaker D: It's just a bot using a command to send a transaction.
00:39:25.830 - 00:39:34.942, Speaker A: But are they using a Dex aggregator? How are they buying?
00:39:35.006 - 00:39:43.334, Speaker D: Well, you give them the contract that you want to buy from. So you are the one who's responsible for sourcing the tokens that you want to invest in.
00:39:43.372 - 00:40:09.374, Speaker B: So most of these are directly on uniswap because all these tokens, tax tokens, aren't compatible with a lot of dexes. Uniswap V two. So most of the trades go directly to uniswap. So I'm assuming. Yeah, so you send a command on telegram, their API or whatever picks up the command and the bot triggers a transaction directly to the smart contract, I guess.
00:40:09.492 - 00:40:15.290, Speaker D: Yep. Or it uses a router to find the best price. If they wanted to really get complicated.
00:40:15.370 - 00:40:37.062, Speaker C: No, but it's a good question, Tammy. I think someone told me. It's like I didn't have a chance to interview the guy, but yeah, he said something. But they write like custom RPCs. This is coming a little out of my depth, but they achieve speed. They're not just like, yeah, because it doesn't make sense that they would just use uniswap. Like, why is it.
00:40:37.062 - 00:40:50.514, Speaker C: So they're doing something. I feel like I sound so kind of primitive, but they're doing something behind the scenes to interact with the blockchain. In a more sophisticated way than just obviously, interface.
00:40:50.662 - 00:41:17.000, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Because there are competing bots. Right. It's not just, I mean, everyone's. There's like big war in the telegram bots, too. There's like Unibot, this banana gun, new entrants coming in every day. Pretty much trying to offer one more feature or be faster at something, because that's how competitive the sniping game is.
00:41:17.000 - 00:41:22.662, Speaker B: And microseconds, milliseconds could mean the difference between a two X and a ten X.
00:41:22.796 - 00:41:23.142, Speaker D: True.
00:41:23.196 - 00:41:23.510, Speaker C: Right.
00:41:23.580 - 00:41:29.930, Speaker A: So interesting. Reminds me of like flash boys in tradfi.
00:41:30.910 - 00:41:34.650, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty much. I mean, this is the blockchain version, I'd say.
00:41:34.800 - 00:41:56.410, Speaker A: So interesting. You know how they were like the first high frequency traders were building, like putting their servers closer to the Nasdaq to be able to trade. Like, these telegram bots are the blockchain version of that. So interesting.
00:41:56.500 - 00:42:05.842, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. So these guys all run their own nodes and very low latency, et cetera. Because, yeah, there's no point having all the infra in place if you can't send the transaction quickly.
00:42:05.896 - 00:42:06.500, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:07.030 - 00:42:20.278, Speaker B: Yeah, it's crazy. Like I said to me, it's just like a black box that I know. It just works. I trust it with a little bit of ease so that I can use it. But beyond that, that's the extent for my knowledge.
00:42:20.454 - 00:43:02.870, Speaker A: It's interesting to me, like this exponential curve of growth of these bots, because the use case is pretty sophisticated. You need to be like a committed trader to be using a bot. So the spike in these bots just tells me even in the bear, there's a committed group of Djens using DeFi, which is pretty bullish. There's activity, there's people trading and using sophisticated tools to trade.
00:43:03.290 - 00:43:03.702, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:03.756 - 00:43:07.106, Speaker D: Anywhere you can get an edge on other traders, there will be D five djen.
00:43:07.138 - 00:43:24.766, Speaker C: But especially with those pepes, right? I think someone for this, they're like, you don't have to get a pepe. You can just get Yyc. You probably know you throw an ETH into something and you hit. You can just be hella early. I don't know. It doesn't even have to succeed at all.
00:43:24.948 - 00:43:58.840, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, most coins, if you see, I drop shit coins in our channel every day, right? So you see most of them, they'll rally 4510, 1520 x and then go to zero. So you just need to ride that wave and it doesn't need to be a pepe, let's say like sub one hundred k m cap. Your risk is quite low, because even if that team has the slightest shred of marketing prowess, they can pump it to 500K. So that gives you five X, and you hit enough of these, that's real money.
00:44:00.330 - 00:44:01.426, Speaker C: Amen.
00:44:01.618 - 00:44:11.680, Speaker B: And then you hope for the next pepe. So you leave, like, moon bags of all these absolute junk coins. And then one fine weekend, you look back in your wallets and say, what the hell was that?
00:44:12.850 - 00:44:15.998, Speaker C: Oh, my God. Sounds like a dream. Great life.
00:44:16.164 - 00:44:26.526, Speaker A: Oh, God. It literally is a casino, though. It's like, okay, gambling for the meme coin that'll pump, but it is what it is. It's a game.
00:44:26.628 - 00:44:29.040, Speaker C: It's a corner of the market. Yeah, it's part of that.
00:44:29.430 - 00:44:31.138, Speaker A: That's the way to look at it.
00:44:31.304 - 00:45:18.100, Speaker B: So there are bots that also help your casual traders react to news. So that's another interesting sector that I've been watching. So they basically pull news feeds from, like, tree of alpha or wobblock, et cetera. Yes, of course, we're aggregated in a lot of them, by the way, but, yeah, so you can trade through telegram using your finance or bybit account. So the news drops and it'll say, go long, ten X, short, ten X. So it's just like basically hitting buttons based on the news. So, for example, when the grayscale news dropped, a bunch of people were able to just mash the button early enough and grab onto that God candle that we had.
00:45:19.830 - 00:45:20.578, Speaker C: Crazy.
00:45:20.744 - 00:45:43.340, Speaker A: Interesting. I wonder if these bots are having an effect on crypto finally reacting to news, because for the longest time, I don't know what you guys see, but in most cases, some huge news drops and crypto doesn't do anything.
00:45:44.750 - 00:45:53.386, Speaker D: I think it's all news. Huge news might be different from one person to another. So it's all subjective.
00:45:53.418 - 00:46:09.442, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess. But from years of covering this thing versus covering traditional markets at Bloomberg, where it's like something drops and the thing moves and it's just like. So, I mean, when something comes out.
00:46:09.496 - 00:46:14.770, Speaker B: In traditional finance, like you said before, you read that news and you go and look at the stock, it's already.
00:46:14.840 - 00:46:18.066, Speaker A: Moved, the stock already priced it, it already reacted.
00:46:18.178 - 00:46:30.330, Speaker D: In traditional market, we have a ton of players that are plugged into these feeds that have already revenue streams that are built into this marketplace. Right. Whereas crypto, there aren't.
00:46:31.310 - 00:46:37.274, Speaker A: I wonder if these bots that are made to react to news will start to change that, perhaps? Yes.
00:46:37.392 - 00:46:41.710, Speaker D: I mean, they certainly will as more people use them. I think it's inevitable.
00:46:42.770 - 00:46:51.002, Speaker A: Interesting. Anyways, okay, let's move to the next headline. Jeremy?
00:46:51.146 - 00:46:51.774, Speaker C: Oh, it's me.
00:46:51.812 - 00:46:53.600, Speaker D: Am I up? All right, you're up.
00:46:55.650 - 00:46:56.122, Speaker C: Ex.
00:46:56.196 - 00:47:54.126, Speaker D: Formerly, Twitter has obtained a Rhode island money license, or, sorry, it's a Rhode island currency transmitter license. Now, this is different from a money license. It allows the company to manage, transfer and exchange digital assets on the platform, as well as hold those assets for other users. Now, X has approximately 450,000,000 users. Now it's positioned to potentially introduce cryptocurrency payment services with the auspices of regulatory approval across its platform. The move follows on a series of actions by the platform since its acquisition by billionaire Elon Musk in October of the previous year. X has a history of integrating cryptocurrencies, though we've seen bitcoin tips integrated on this platform before, in years past, and in terms of NFT engagement, you can pay a subscription service and get that little hexagon around your profile pick to indicate your ownership of that image.
00:47:54.126 - 00:48:50.150, Speaker D: So if it does happen by 2027, I think I read somewhere Twitter is expected to grow to 650,000,000 active users. This is a huge opportunity for cryptocurrency to be fed to people in a very known navigable interface, which is something that has been a pain point for the industry for years. If Elon is able to use the custody aspect of the platform, he could potentially set up a series of custody wallet services set up underneath Twitter, and then utilizing the company's traditional financial backing, he could introduce a layer of functionality to that wallet service via the Twitter interface. But that all remains to be seen. Speculatory. Still, it's pretty interesting. Elon's, in the past with his other companies, he's bought bitcoin and shown that he has an interest in digital currencies and utilizing them.
00:48:50.150 - 00:49:17.918, Speaker D: So if he's definitely interested in seeing that happen across Twitter, I wouldn't be surprised. Also, you have to take into account there are certain political leanings, wherein there are affiliations that Elon has shown a proclivity towards in the past, that also have shown an interest in digital currencies in terms of their sovereign capacity to be transmitted without government interruptions. And therefore that may in turn draw cryptocurrencies to Twitter if there's a large right wing push on the platform.
00:49:18.084 - 00:49:40.920, Speaker A: Also remember that Elon comes from, has he has payments background. It would fit really well to try to rebuild a new PayPal on top of Twitter or x whatever with crypto and make it this super app that does everything.
00:49:42.970 - 00:49:43.634, Speaker D: Indeed.
00:49:43.682 - 00:49:45.590, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not so far fetched.
00:49:46.010 - 00:49:55.850, Speaker C: Yeah, I got to go downtown and talk to the. I haven't seen the sign. I know. They took down the pretty little bird. It sucks.
00:49:56.270 - 00:49:57.558, Speaker A: It does suck.
00:49:57.734 - 00:49:59.434, Speaker D: Now there's like a rave going on.
00:49:59.472 - 00:50:06.240, Speaker C: Over there with the. Now it's a 24 hours rave downtown. True.
00:50:07.250 - 00:50:25.326, Speaker A: All right. Okay. We talked about these bots. Another kind of layer of DFI sophistication here with Uniswap v three manager 21.
00:50:25.368 - 00:51:15.490, Speaker D: When Uniswap V three was introduced, it introduced a layer of complexity to the dfI liquidity market. It allowed you to try to manage capital efficiency in a more efficient way, so to speak. Right. But the problem is that it introduced layers of complexity to it that make it difficult for unsophisticated members of the ecosystem or those who don't have large amounts of capital allocated to make the most of that protocol. Because of that, a lot of the main coins that we see actually utilize uniswap V two. But for those who want to make the most of their capital efficiency and keep that capital pegged on the right side, so to speak, we have seen a number of capital management services come up in the place. Now, one of those is Maverick protocol, and I spoke to Maverick protocols.
00:51:15.490 - 00:51:47.454, Speaker D: Sorry. I spoke to the individuals at Maverick protocol. They've launched on base, which is Coinbase's layer two network. And basically they've seen a lot of individuals take advantage of their trading patterns. They have some interesting automated trading patterns that make it easy for you to allocate capital. You can set it like mode left, where basically we don't think that the price is going to go up. Mode static, where price is going to basically be trading sideways, or mode right, where we think the price is going to go up.
00:51:47.454 - 00:52:58.070, Speaker D: And you can allocate your capital into these pools and then it automatically manages it on uniswap v three to give you the best capital efficiency without exposing you to the potential, like permanent losses that happen when you rebalance on the wrong side of the pool, et cetera, et cetera. Maverick isn't the only company that's offering these types of services. As a matter of fact, there are a great deal of these companies out there, and Maverick is just kind of eking its name out. However, chief technology officer Bob Baxley told me that he anticipates a large number of individuals onboarding into the Defi ecosystem via base. And therefore, the protocol's launch on base is pursuant to the idea that this is going to be a vector for that to take place. They do have a note that on Maverick, their Coinbase ETH base pool is achieving more than 100% capital efficiency, according to Baxley. So that's definitely something to be said for individuals that are looking to manage their capital in a capital efficient marketplace without suffering the pitfalls of lacking the sophistication or perhaps the weighted capital in order to avoid the costs of rebalancing.
00:52:59.370 - 00:53:05.650, Speaker A: And some of the other projects you mentioned in the story, gamma, and I guess the biggest one is called Arrakis.
00:53:05.810 - 00:53:32.638, Speaker D: Yes, Arrakis. And for those of you familiar with the Dune series, those who control the spice control the universe. And Arrakis is, of course, the planet from which the spice originates. And therefore, Arrakis is the most dominant protocol of all the other ones. Even though its chart is down, Arrakis still has a great deal of capital in it, and I do not see that going down anytime soon.
00:53:32.804 - 00:53:41.714, Speaker A: I could not finish Dune. Yeah, I should watch the movie. Is it good? I could not get through the book.
00:53:41.832 - 00:53:49.634, Speaker D: I think your fear of it not being good is the mind killer. And when you let your fear pass through you, only you will remain.
00:53:49.762 - 00:54:09.846, Speaker B: Okay, I guess. The sequel was supposed to come out, I believe, in November, but has been pushed to next year. My holidays now around, major movies I want to see because I can only do it when I'm back home and I can leave the kids with the grandparents.
00:54:10.038 - 00:54:13.102, Speaker A: I still haven't seen Barbie. I've been wanting to see that.
00:54:13.236 - 00:54:15.306, Speaker D: I don't know if we can compare Dune to Barbie.
00:54:15.338 - 00:54:15.694, Speaker C: Hold on.
00:54:15.732 - 00:54:17.006, Speaker A: I think so. I think so.
00:54:17.108 - 00:54:19.920, Speaker D: No, let's put a pin in that one.
00:54:20.450 - 00:54:21.070, Speaker A: All right.
00:54:21.140 - 00:54:21.760, Speaker C: Okay.
00:54:23.030 - 00:54:30.290, Speaker A: Final story to discuss. Jeremy, you had this feature on real world assets. What's going on here?
00:54:30.360 - 00:55:13.914, Speaker D: So real world asset adoption is not slowing down. It's almost like we've reached this cycle where now the crypto assets are looking towards something to keep them legitimate. So where else but real world assets? A number of protocols across the sector have kind of looked towards adopting them and integrating them. Many of these adoption strategies involve utilizing some sort of holding company that has been set up to manage these types of assets because there is a certain amount of regulatory stuff that goes along with that. So the process to do this is pretty cut and dry. We can focus on some of the major ones that I was able to speak to. I talked to CEO Brent Shu over at UMe, who was focusing mainly on bonds.
00:55:13.914 - 00:55:52.042, Speaker D: Given Shu's background in bond trading, better part of a decade that he spent doing that, optimizing their approach to build bonds and get a competitive edge in the real world asset market. For their platform participants. Also, Maple Finance is expanding its real world asset lending tools. They already actually offer an accrue lending tool, which targets businesses in the US to facilitate cash advances on existing backlog of forthcoming tax rebates, such as an employee retention program. And they want to expand it. I talked to CEO Sidney Powell. He noted that the blockchain technology offers significant advantages for cross border remittance and trade finance export deals.
00:55:52.042 - 00:56:46.090, Speaker D: So they're looking to try to, in the next six to nine months, I believe, capitalize on a trade finance product. Looking across the pond here, so to speak, not really a pond, but across to Pendle. We're looking at a yield splitting protocol where you can take your yield, take it off of the asset, and try and manage those separately from one another. They're enhancing rate swaps to include stable coins that incorporate revenue from real world assets so users can take these treasury yields, sorry, these yields. To secure fixed yields on assets through Pendle's interest rate derivative protocol. And with a focus on the rapidly growing real world asset sector, Pendle is positioning itself to cater to the potential in that marketplace. Meanwhile, Fracs, which we spoke of not long ago, has passed almost unanimously.
00:56:46.090 - 00:57:59.480, Speaker D: It's basically approval to partner with this Delaware based nonprofit C corporation, Finres PBC. It was set up to manage real world assets for the Frax protocol and then operate at cost, sending them back into the protocol for the users and to take a small amount of fees so they can manage its operational cost. The collaboration is going to give fracs the ability to hold and manage various traditional financial assets, including cash deposits, treasury bills, and it's just, again, another move by another company into the real world asset sector. Now, in terms of those types of assets, the traditional finance world, yes, we've seen a lot of adoption, but something very interesting is actually something we've also seen in terms of luxury good assets. Platforms like Arcade, XYZ and 4K are working together to create non fungible tokens that are representative of validated luxury goods that then can be applied in the DFI marketplace. Now, arcade has turned around and said we're going to facilitate lending for these types of services. And we've seen a plethora of types of deals showing up with luxury goods, such as like high end watches and what we're looking at soon, perhaps more types of activity like that in the near future.
00:58:00.570 - 00:58:23.054, Speaker A: Awesome. Very interesting stuff. I mean, this has been an ongoing theme, real world assets picking up steam and defi, and we're seeing more and more protocols integrate. This seems like all stablecoin issuers, all lenders will end up doing this. Oh, and I know you have to jump to your interview. All right, feel free to say bye bye, everyone.
00:58:23.172 - 00:58:25.260, Speaker C: Have a good week, everyone. See you guys.
