00:00:00.330 - 00:00:39.458, Speaker A: GM defiers. Today we're diving into Zksync error. Now this is a zero knowledge powered L2 scaling solution for Ethereum from Matterlabs, and it's already attracted over $120,000,000 in TVL since launching its public main net two months ago. Matterlabs managed to raise $200 million in November during the depths of the bear market, so VCs certainly think the technology holds promise. Today, we're going to use some of the applications that are live on era, and if you watch till the end, we'll walk you through the exact steps you need to qualify for the potential airdrop. So stick around. A big thank you to the stellar development foundation.
00:00:39.458 - 00:01:08.294, Speaker A: Be sure to check out the Soroban smart contract platform which hits mainnet this fall. Okay, so the first step is to add Zksync error to your metamask wallet. And the easy way of doing this is to go chainlist.org and search for zksync. Now, once our metamask wallet is connected, we can scroll down, search for ZK, and when we hit enter, we should see the Testnet and the mainnet available. Step two, we're going to bridge assets to era. And to do this, we have to go to bridge Zksync IO.
00:01:08.294 - 00:01:31.942, Speaker A: So we'll go over there and we'll start by connecting our wallet. You can see that I've already connected mine, and you can select the amount that you want to bridge. We'll hit the deposit button and using the metamask pop up, we approve the transaction. Easy enough. Now, bear in mind the process can take up to five minutes and you can see an estimate of the transaction fees before confirming. Step three. Next, we have Syncswap XYZ.
00:01:31.942 - 00:02:02.206, Speaker A: So let's go over to Syncswap's DAP and we'll start by connecting our metamask wallet. And what we're going to do here is swap some ETH for USDC. So we select the amount of ETH that we want to swap into USDC and we click approve. We interact with the metamask popups, confirm, and we're good to go. Next up is step four, minting our very own zk domain. But first, a quick word from Stella, who's today's sponsor.
00:02:02.398 - 00:02:31.420, Speaker B: The world is full of tensions, all simultaneously pulling on the fabric of our financial system. And that is exactly where we see change. Pairing through refugee smartphone. A change that enables all the financial world has to offer to anyone, anywhere. The stellar network. A universe of opportunity.
00:02:31.790 - 00:02:54.450, Speaker A: Now back to airdrop farming. So we're going to mint a ZK domain and to do so we have to go to app ZKNs domains. So I've typed in the defiant and I see that it's unavailable. We will go for I am defiant. See if that works. That's available. Okay, so then we can hard this and we're going to connect our wallet.
00:02:54.450 - 00:03:22.026, Speaker A: We connect the metamask wallet. As such, once we've checked the availability and connected our wallet we can register with ETH. You see the cost on screen as well. So this is about six and a half us dollars at the moment. And there we go. As simple as that. Step five we're going to buy and mint an NFT on Mint square.
00:03:22.026 - 00:03:50.562, Speaker A: We're almost there at this point. So we head over to Mintsquare IO and this is a very important step. Make sure you see the forward slash Zksync in the URL bar and only mint an NFT with the letters zk before the project. Otherwise you've just minted a normal NFT and you might not qualify for the airdrop. So let's say we like zk animals for the sake of this example. Once we have the collection in front of us, we choose the NFT we like, we click buy, we confirm the transaction and celebrate. You're now an NFT owner.
00:03:50.562 - 00:04:18.570, Speaker A: To get a full rundown of how to complete these steps, head over to thedefiant IO where you'll find DFI Alpha newsletter and you can join over 80,000 people who learn about the latest yield, farming and airdrop opportunities in DFI from none other than YYC trader and DFI dad. So there you have it. By following these simple steps, you're all to qualify for the Zksync error airdrop. And remember to subscribe to the defiant for more alpha news like this. Thank you for tuning in and stay defiant.
