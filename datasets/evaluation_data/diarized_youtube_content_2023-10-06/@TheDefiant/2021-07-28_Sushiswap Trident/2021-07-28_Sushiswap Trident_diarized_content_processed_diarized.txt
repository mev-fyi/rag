00:00:01.370 - 00:00:27.170, Speaker A: It's Wednesday, it's the middle of the week. It is raining cats and dogs here. But the market seems to be looking kind of positive, doesn't it? Bitcoin heading upwards. All the altcoins heading upwards. Is it a mirage? Is it real? Can we believe it? I don't actually know. But what I do know is that things are moving on a pace in the world of defi. And we are this week taking a look at a shiny new product from Sushiswap, everyone's favourite fork.
00:00:27.170 - 00:01:14.722, Speaker A: And it is crazy to think that Sushiswap is not even a year old yet. And look how quickly it has become one of the major players in the Defi space. It started with a fork and a vampire attack, but since then it has been arguably the most forward thinking, the most innovative project in Defi, consistently delivering new products seemingly every week. And at last week's ECC in Paris, they announced their latest, which is a brand new Amm called Trident. Which has to be a joke because, you know, Trident fork, when we think about where sushi came from, fork Trident CC sushi. See where they're going with this great name. So this new automated market maker introduces three prongs designed to increase capital efficiency and improve user experience.
00:01:14.722 - 00:01:53.178, Speaker A: Where have we heard that before? And we'll get into all of that properly after this message from our sponsors. Don't let high gas costs keep you out of Ethereum a balancer the gas optimized vault architecture makes trading cheaper than anywhere else. Liquidity providers can optimize their fee earnings using their dynamic fee system that automatically adjusts to market conditions. You can also use asset managers to lend out idle assets, dramatically increasing your capital efficiency. And because balancer is an open platform for flexible automated markets, you can choose from stable pools or weighted pools. And in the future, more designs will be created that we don't even know about yet. Check it out at Balancer Phi.
00:01:53.178 - 00:02:23.862, Speaker A: With the fast paced nature of the crypto industry, more and more wealth building platforms are entering the market. So it's only natural to be confused about who to trust and where to hold your assets. That's why we're introducing Nexo, the world's leading digital assets institution. Being one of the safest options out there, Nexo fully protects and ensures your assets for up to $375,000,000. You can buy crypto directly on the web platform or mobile app and start earning up to 12% interest on your idle assets. They also allow you to borrow against your crypto from 6.9% APR.
00:02:23.862 - 00:02:53.826, Speaker A: And the best thing is your credit line becomes instantly available with no credit checks. You can even buy, sell and swap 100 or so crypto and fiat pairs with zero price fluctuations. Check it out at Nexo IO. So let's dig into it. The Trident's first prong is its integration with Bentobox. Now you can allocate funds to bentobox to use as collateral or lend out to earn interest, but with single token approval for usage across all the apps, it is actually kind of awesome. Now the second prong is an expansion of pool type options.
00:02:53.826 - 00:03:39.634, Speaker A: Trident will standardize the pool interface, allowing new pool designs to be integrated seamlessly. There'll also be several new pools to allow for more flexibility when providing liquidity. There's a constant product pool made up of two assets of equal monetary value, but thanks to a zap in zap out function, you can add whatever you like in whatever ratio you like, and the protocol will automatically balance your position for you. There's also a hybrid pool which functions like a stable swap curve. You can deposit up to 32 different assets, so imagine any flavor of stablecoin you can imagine. And then there's a concentrated liquidity pool which functions much like the concentrated positions on uniswap. And finally, there's a weighted pool which will allow different weight types between tokens and up to eight tokens at the same time.
00:03:39.634 - 00:04:22.750, Speaker A: Much, much to ponder there. So many different options for LPs. The third and final prong of Trident is a new routing engine, aptly named Tynes. It's multi hop multiroot. It'll search multiple pools to perform multi route deals, searching multiple parts a token takes to exchange into another multi multi, multi multi part, but in all, in the service of minimizing price, impact and slippage. Now, the last noteworthy takeout from Sushi Swap's announcement was them standing behind the GPL three license. Now, if you remember, a certain successful AMM is now operating under a very different type of license, which protects certain parts of its protocol for a certain period of time.
00:04:22.750 - 00:04:48.790, Speaker A: But here with Sushiswap, it's all open. Now, clearly lines are being drawn around the philosophical and ideological differences, and it will be fascinating to see how this plays out when these protocols really hit scale. What a trip. That's it for this week. Do let us know in the comments if there are projects you'd like us to cover in first. Look, until next time, I will see you get some bitcoin up. Nah, who knows? I don't know.
00:04:48.790 - 00:04:49.090, Speaker A: Bye.
