00:00:25.250 - 00:00:40.200, Speaker A: Hello and welcome to the defiant open Metaverse show. I am very excited to be joined by Justin Bannon, co founder of Bosom Protocol today. Justin, welcome to the show. I think the first thing we should do is get, what is Boson protocol? What is it all about?
00:00:40.650 - 00:01:31.370, Speaker B: Sure. Well, thanks for having me, Robin. It's great to be here. So Boson protocol answers the question, is it possible in web3 to do kind of ecommerce or have physical commerce without the need for an intermediary, without the need to trust an Amazon and Alibaba without the need to trust a seller? And that's like a really important question because for all this, if we got web3 decentralized, trustless systems, if in order to do the number one economic activity, which is commerce, you still need Amazon, you still need Alibaba, you still need trusted entities, then that's a really big constraint on the size of the web3 economy.
00:01:32.590 - 00:01:37.002, Speaker A: Are we looking to disrupt Amazon or is it something more like Shopify at this?
00:01:37.056 - 00:02:37.086, Speaker B: Well, the aim of Boson protocol is to become a layer in the same way as IPFS is like a layer for file storage, is to become a layer in web3 that we just plug into to do commercial exchange. So if I need to go and transfer some data or access some data across the web, I use TCP IP. There's no need for sort of intermediaries and librarians and any of those, they've all been kind of disintermediated. And the same way with boson protocol, it's designed to be able to tokenize the world's physical things, products, services and digital things, everything, tokenize them in a standard format, a redeemable NFT format, and then make the exchange between those things as trustless and low friction and low cost as possible.
00:02:37.268 - 00:03:11.020, Speaker A: I mean, that's the hobby, isn't it? The trustless bit, I think we kind of get. But the low friction part has traditionally been horrific. Like anytime you go, oh, we're going to do it the blockchain web3 way. Everyone goes, really? And I've proposed a few different things to various VCs and they went, yeah, but why would you add all that friction? It's just a no go. So it sounds like you've got the answer, I've got the solution. And how does it work exactly? How do you enable that?
00:03:11.470 - 00:04:23.162, Speaker B: Okay, the basic sort of exchange mechanism of boson protocol, we've got V one live, which is an exchange mechanism which I design with my co founder. And we run like metaverse fashion Week and had brands like Tommy Hilfiger and stuff, doing loads of commerce on it. But we're about to launch V Two, which has been completely redesigned by some of the world's top blockchain mines. So the protocol design itself was designed by a guy called Aditya that works for Ethereum foundation, designing Ethereum too, and did a whole load of academic work on these type of exchange methods. So essentially what happens is a seller has something to sell. Let's say we've got a bicycle, that seller will place an offer, create an offer within boson protocol, and then a buyer can see that offer, can see the terms of that offer, and if they like it, the buyer can commit some funds to the smart contract. So at that point the buyer receives what we call a redeemable NFT.
00:04:23.162 - 00:05:25.490, Speaker B: So now the protocol has got some buyer funds locked up and the buyer has a redeemable NFT, which is like a futures contract. It's a claim on a physical asset. It's not actually tokenizing the physical asset, it's like an incentivized IOU, because within that smart contract you've got the payment amount for the item, but there's also optionally a buyer deposit, which is a bit like non refundable deposit for a restaurant booking, gives the seller confidence that the buyer is not going to reverse and back out. And then optionally there's also a seller deposit. So if you were buying something from Nike, you probably wouldn't need them to put a deposit you trust they're going to deliver. But if you're buying something from some random on the Internet, well the protocol is going to make sure either you get the item or your money back, but you could still have your funds locked up and kind of have time wasters. So you've got these kind of deposits and a payment amount all locked up in a smart contract, and then the buyer gets this redeemable NFT.
00:05:25.490 - 00:06:17.062, Speaker B: At this point, yeah, sure, the buyer could just redeem and we can go through that. But now you've got an NFT with a kind of credible claim on a physical asset. So actually what you can do now with that NFT is you can trade it. So you can go and trade that on opensea, you could flip it, do whatever you want with it. You could use it as collateral in sort of some nifty phi, you can transfer it. So we're doing a whole load of this huge social Christmas gifting where we've got a nephew that likes these rare sneakers this Christmas can go and buy a tokenized sneaker and send it to him. He lives in Los Angeles, you live in know, pretty cool thing.
00:06:17.062 - 00:07:01.214, Speaker B: He can then redeem it or flip it or you can hold it. So we've got quite a few of these kind of luxury wine and spirits kind of companies that are like takes twelve years for some of this rare whiskey to mature, right? Tokenize it. And these things trade like futures contracts for years. They're like commoditizing everything. So what it does is this bridge between physical and digital, but plugs into like Defi and Niftyfi. So anyway, the buyer has now this redeemable NFT and eventually when a buyer receives it and they want to redeem, they hit redeem. And then what happens is there's a period to dispute.
00:07:01.214 - 00:07:28.054, Speaker B: If nothing happens, the seller gets paid. It's an optimistic protocol, right? That's what makes it so efficient, so clean. The happy path has very very little obstruction. However, during that period, if the buyer is not happy, then they can dispute. And the dispute goes through two phases. The first phase is a piece of game theory called mutual resolution. Been designed by one of the world's top game theorists, one of the world's top behavior economists.
00:07:28.054 - 00:08:27.866, Speaker B: And it's really designed to kind of handle 80 90% of the dispute in an automated way. But if that fails, then what happens is the buyer can then further escalate to independent dispute resolvers and depending on this set up as part of the offer. But those dispute resolvers can go from being pleros and fully decentralized, which is nice, fully decentralized, very secure, but quite expensive, all the way down to just being like, I don't know, a trusted retailer or a trusted call center. But the key here is that unlike with the sort of Amazon and eBay models, these dispute resolvers play a commoditized role. They're not sitting in the middle of the platform controlling and eating the whole industry. They are literally a service provider. And so that's a sort of high level overview of the protocol.
00:08:27.866 - 00:08:32.598, Speaker B: It's also got some really other really interesting other features. But that's the core exchange mechanism.
00:08:32.794 - 00:08:49.560, Speaker A: Yeah, it all makes sense. Once a thing is turned into a digital version of itself, it's very swift and very free and very liquid. But I'm curious how expensive it is to commit it in the first place.
00:08:51.770 - 00:08:58.646, Speaker B: Really expensive. It cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars to do it on Ethereum, which is why we're launching V two on Polygon, which is.
00:08:58.668 - 00:08:59.900, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say.
00:09:01.870 - 00:09:02.186, Speaker C: How.
00:09:02.208 - 00:09:06.860, Speaker A: Much logic has to go into that smart contract because I imagine it has to be very kind of.
00:09:08.430 - 00:10:22.514, Speaker B: I mean, this is why having the world's know protocol designer like someone from Ethereum foundation and then we've, our, our tech lead is a guy called Cliff hall who's written NFT sort of ERC standards and stuff. Because, yeah, I mean, it's hard to make it game theoretically kind of incentive compatible and blockchain efficient. And that intersection is what makes the difference between a really effective protocol and something that's kind of unworkable. And we've got really clean, I mean, super happy with our. Probably the person I look up to almost most in blockchain is Trent McConaughey from ocean, founder of token Engineering, our first angel investor. And he sort of reviewed it all and it's like, wow, this will be like in textbooks moving forward as an example of protocol design. So yeah, we're super happy with, I mean, it's all about getting the best people working on a hard problem and let the magic happen.
00:10:22.514 - 00:10:39.260, Speaker B: And we're just super happy to be releasing this thing. And of course it's all fully open source, so hopefully there'll be lots of kind of learnings and components that will find themselves into other protocols as we advance this thing we build together called web3.
00:10:39.630 - 00:11:01.680, Speaker A: And of course NFTs are 100% responsible for the planet burning down. They probably started the war in Ukraine. NFTs are just completely toxic. Are you having to struggle to educate people or sell this to skeptics or people who think crypto is a scam? I'm just wondering what the kind of sentiment that's coming back to you is at this point in the.
00:11:02.610 - 00:11:19.158, Speaker B: No, I mean, not at all mean. We launched this during crypto winter where all VCs are saying, come on, Justin, you're a professional guy, you've got a family, what are you wasting your time for? I mean, web3 is dead and v one, right?
00:11:19.324 - 00:11:25.560, Speaker A: Do you mean 20, 18, 19? Yeah, that was bleak, I remember.
00:11:27.130 - 00:12:18.674, Speaker B: But I studied innovation, I knew that they said the web was dead twice, right. And I just knew we had something that was a major part of web3 if web3 happened. But. So I spent the first kind of year explained to people Web three was going to happen, the second year explained to people, if Web three is going to happen, you're going to need decentralized commerce. Otherwise it's like Web three plugged into Amazon. But over the last five or six months, it's just gone crazy because suddenly everyone gets that you need Web three commerce and we've got major brands, we've got loads of NFT projects, we've got loads of integrators, everybody gets it. And it's amazing how this thing flips.
00:12:18.674 - 00:12:55.394, Speaker B: I mean, Shopify have done a whole load of stuff on token gating and stuff, which is almost like the Facebook meta announcement. It's like suddenly everybody wants it. Of course we're fully programmable. We have full token gating. We've had that since version one with super Advanced, which it's just completely programmable, what you can enable. So it's commerce and it's loyalty. So no, I mean, in answer to your question, the market understands and wants web3 commerce now.
00:12:55.394 - 00:13:04.950, Speaker B: So we're just trying to run as fast as we can to get product into the hands of people that want it and help builders build with boson.
00:13:05.290 - 00:13:16.780, Speaker A: Yeah, and when you're talking about a cost of $100,000 to initiate a smart contract, is that per item or can you create bundles of items so you can create maybe.
00:13:17.710 - 00:14:04.140, Speaker B: Well, we did whole of metaverse fashion week and we paid for all the transactions and it went really well and it was on Ethereum and it cost us a fortune. Now it's on Polygon. A the protocol is probably 20 times more efficient and it's on Polygon, which is I don't know how many times more efficient they have told me. But basically the cost of it comes down to it's no longer a factor. We've deployed our sort of smart contracts onto like Testnet and I got a message pop up today and it was like $2. It's no longer on my radar. The cost of these, well, that's good doing it, which is amazing.
00:14:05.710 - 00:14:47.922, Speaker A: Basically what you're saying is that anything that is physical can have a digital twin, and that digital twin can go and do all the wonderful things that NFTs can do. And I think we are, thanks to things like this, hopefully going to get beyond the JPEG era, because I love JPEgs. I mean, the JPEGs are really fun, but let's be real here. What an NFT can be is so much more than that. I know you've probably got quite a lot to say about the NFT thing, but even just before we got on the stream, you were telling me NFTs are just an exciting piece of technology that we've barely scratched the surface of what they're capable of. So I'm curious if you can give me some more insight into your thinking on that.
00:14:48.076 - 00:15:26.870, Speaker B: Well, I don't think people understand. I mean, NFTs are things, right? And if you look around you, everything is a thing. And so everything you see, every unique item, every non unique collection, all of these things are things. And NFTs are the standard for representing things. So whether it's a physical thing that's going to have this kind of redeemable NFT, it might have a digital. We're doing loads with fashion brands where they're creating sneakers. Where you buy the physical, you get the digital.
00:15:26.870 - 00:16:27.042, Speaker B: And because the physical is sold as an NFT and the digital is an NFT, they can be bundled within the protocol and they're just treated exactly the same. Then you've got these financial instruments. I mean, boson is like a financial instrument that commoditizes physical products and stuff. When they're nfts, they flow around, they use all that NFT infrastructure. I think everything you see, if you think about the world, how everything's sort of represented by database transactions at the moment, right? These things are going to be represented by NFTs that are just going to flow around an open system rather than be a database transaction locked in eBay or Netflix. Or if you've got the right to watch a movie, you'll have an NFT which will just unlock it. If you've got the right to, you've just bought yourself a new bicycle, you'll have an NFT that you can redeem for the bicycle.
00:16:27.042 - 00:16:58.290, Speaker B: You won't have a database record hidden on eBay. And all of these things will be released in a common, interoperable standard. NFTs are things, smart, programmable things. And it's like, I did my fireside with Trent the other day, and he was saying that blockchain is the rails upon which we're going to be rebuilding civilization. And NFTs are like the things, the transactions, they are the primary objects of that new world. So I guess I'm pretty bullish on them.
00:16:58.360 - 00:17:42.426, Speaker A: Yeah. No, I have been since I first saw cryptokitties. And as a filmmaker, I was excited about NFTs because I thought here was a way for us to combat piracy. Here was a way to prove provenance, make something that's better than piracy. But of course, that was, again, just a very basic understanding of what they are and how they can represent value and also all the different ways that can be architected as well. And I think one of the hard things that we've seen this year is the ability to circumvent royalties, which I thought was harsh on the NFT space. But of course, if that goes away, then you have to innovate again, and you have to figure out other ways to create some kind of recurring value to the creator.
00:17:42.426 - 00:18:25.440, Speaker A: Because I think if creators are better incentivized, they're going to make better products, they'll probably be a lot more crap products. But actually, as always, the cream rises to the top. But it's so bizarre because what you're saying is effectively everything that is great already can be great in a different way and have these superpowers attached to it. And I think what's hard for people to understand is that, as you said, these are like commodities and futures contracts. That feels very out of reach and alien and very Wall street to a lot of people. So how do we market this? How do we get the communications right around this? Or do you even need to? Because actually the people who build on top of you are the ones that will do that work.
00:18:26.050 - 00:19:04.038, Speaker B: Well, we've just got a new sort of head of marketing, and so we're having lots of conversation about this. You have to have audience specific messaging. Right. So to crypto people explaining that these things are like futures contracts and stuff, and all of that's in the D five world. Wow, that's great. But when we're working with more mainstream brands or more consumer facing, then my background is I run a big kind of billion dollar rewards program with digital vouchers. So we just say that these are like redeemable vouchers.
00:19:04.038 - 00:19:08.534, Speaker B: Right. Exactly the same. Lots of loyalty programs are really complex underneath.
00:19:08.662 - 00:19:13.338, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say it was kind of like a gift card, but it's just a representative.
00:19:13.434 - 00:19:30.930, Speaker B: But it's a gift card for. It's like a voucher or a coupon redeemable for a specific thing rather than. And people get that. Or it's like a blockchain IOU. Right. And so you've got to find the appropriate language and sort of abstractions.
00:19:33.510 - 00:19:33.826, Speaker A: I.
00:19:33.848 - 00:20:10.974, Speaker B: Think, where we are in the space at the moment, those bridges to web two, which is where all the customers are at the moment. And the vast majority of people who are into crypto have never handled private keys. Right. It's got centralized exchanges. So you've got to have both the technology bridges, but also these kind of cognitive bridges where you're using words like, yeah, these are like NFT vouchers. If you've got one, you can redeem it. People get that, right? Not using language like algorithmic game theory, futures contracts and all of that.
00:20:10.974 - 00:20:15.358, Speaker B: But for crypto audiences, we obviously love all that.
00:20:15.524 - 00:20:31.238, Speaker A: Yeah, I've got a question here from powerally. So if you get an NFT after a purchase, what happens to the NFT after the thing is delivered? And I guess on top of that, is there a smart contract, enforceable proof of delivery mechanism in there?
00:20:31.324 - 00:21:12.366, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. So there's two things there then. The first thing is after the purchase, the NFT is burned. Well, it's burnt, but if you then want to resell the same item, you can create a new redeemable new offer which will then chain the id of the previous NFT so that you can see this kind of link of providence. The exception to this thing being burnt though is if I go and buy this redeemable NFT and then you robbing before it's redeemed, buy it from me. You can buy it using the protocol.
00:21:12.366 - 00:21:36.198, Speaker B: And then what that means is that your funds get locked up and we call it perpetual royalties. And it's a solution to this problem of people rooting around royalties because actually the protocol takes hold of the money and ensures it's actually custody and sent back to the seller. So there's also some great solutions.
00:21:36.374 - 00:21:41.338, Speaker A: You're going to have to explain that to me again. How is that perpetual royalties exactly?
00:21:41.504 - 00:22:37.150, Speaker B: Well, at the moment you mentioned, there's the challenge with, it's easy to get around royalties, but if you imagine that you've got an item that a seller puts on offer and the first buyer comes and says, okay, I'm going to put $500 in the smart contract and they get this redeemable NFT, right? So there's now two options of how that buyer could sell that redeemable NFT. They could kind of just put it on OpeNC and sell it, and then it might leverage the standard kind of loyalty standard, but that can be routed round, et cetera. But the other option is that they then sell it again through the protocol. We call this kind of sequential sale. And so instead of outside of the protocol exchanging this NFT for the money, you would put your money into the protocol and then receive the NFT. So now your money is locked up as well, and then you might sell it again. The next person's money is locked up.
00:22:37.150 - 00:23:40.420, Speaker B: So all the money is going into the protocol as part of this exchange, and that then ensures that the original seller gets their royalties. Now why would buyer 123456 all put their money into the protocol and not do the exchange like using something like OpenSea? Well, the answer is it prevents any rug pullsea and stuff when you've got physical items. It's possible if the original buyer buys something for $500 and then the final buyer gets it for like 1500. What happens is the seller doesn't deliver. Right. So there are incentives for these buyers to use the protocol to give them assurance that they'll either get the item or the money. Mean, the short answer is it's normally burned, but where you've got things like perpetual royalties that the NFT can live on and pass from hand to.
00:23:40.420 - 00:23:45.766, Speaker B: Was your, what was your second question?
00:23:45.948 - 00:23:53.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I was just adding on to that, is there a smart contract, enforceable proof of delivery mechanism?
00:23:56.570 - 00:24:33.106, Speaker B: This very deliberately is configurable within the protocol. So when you create an offer, you can set the evidence requirements for. If you're set, if you're sending a book, then it might be okay, we will accept the ups proof of delivery. That is like sufficient evidence of receipt. But if you were sending like a diamond ring, you might need like this pin needs to be entered into. Ups do these kind of closed loop things. And if you were sending like a gold bar or something.
00:24:33.106 - 00:25:06.590, Speaker B: Right, then you might plug into, okay, there needs to be a cryptographic proof, there would be a signature, would need to basically. And also like things like NFC taps and all of that. We've deliberately created the protocol to be unapinionated there. And as part of the offer, you prescribe and configure what is evidence of delivery. And that's one of the things that the buyer accepts as part of the offer. We agree. What is the evidence?
00:25:09.330 - 00:25:39.500, Speaker A: I guess the ideal scenario for you is that there's a vibrant marketplace of people dipping in, selling, transferring, selling, but it all happens within boson. Do you need to build a front end, like an opensea style thing specifically for this? Because I think one of the problems I've seen with Opensea is that it's impossible to find stuff on there. And if it was sort of geared much more like eBay, for instance, where you had categories and verticals that you could kind of dip your toe into, then it might be easier to get what you actually wanted.
00:25:40.350 - 00:26:30.858, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's a really big strategic question. And our answer is for V two of the protocol, which launches in about a month. We have a storefront, like a DAP, which is a free to use storefront that any seller can come and create and sell things on that storefront. However, we are a protocol and we don't want to compete with our ecosystem. So wherever possible, we're keeping the functionality of that pretty tight. And all of that code is open source for other people to use because we're getting lots of demand, particularly from these kind of mainstream brands that want to put more web 2.5 front ends on and all of this.
00:26:30.858 - 00:26:55.762, Speaker B: And so what we're doing is working with an increasing number of integrators and sort of DAP builders so that we help them plug boson in, but they build it because, yeah, I mean, if we were to use our resources to create some sort of open sea type thing, we would compete with our ecosystem and we'd end up being a vertically integrated stack, which is not what we're aiming to do.
00:26:55.896 - 00:27:05.380, Speaker A: No, not at all. And so I guess my next question is, what are these brands? Can you name any of them? Who's jumping in?
00:27:09.290 - 00:27:44.938, Speaker B: The ones that we've had previously. Basically, we've got about 30 of them. We're announcing every couple of days over the next month or so. So all of those are sort of under embargo. So there's a range from digitals, NFTs. We've also got some big brands and some really big platforms integrating as well. But previously on V One, we've had Tommy Hilfiger, Hogan, the Rebels, Fangang Aurobarus.
00:27:44.938 - 00:28:12.010, Speaker B: So lots of a range between kind of web3 and sort of digital, digital fashion, and then all the way across to sort of web two. We've also got lots of jewelry. This luxury wines and spirits is a massive one because it really fits well with financializing. So, yeah, really quite a broad range.
00:28:13.710 - 00:28:26.030, Speaker A: Let's spin out a scenario here. I'm a YouTuber, I decide I want to launch a range of comfy pants for the masses and I want to start shipping them. Is that a suitable application for boson?
00:28:26.450 - 00:29:37.080, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. You can use boson to do that. You could work with one of our partners if you wanted to have a more sort of self managed service where they might help you with the website, they might help do the fulfillment, et cetera. And then you could not just only sell things, but let's say you issued your own NFT, or let's say that you wanted to create some sort of loyalty program where your best, most loyable inner circle, maybe they got special variety of this merch, et cetera, then you could issue them with like a special NFT that would then be token gated. You could create an NFT that was wearable in Decentraland, et cetera, and then would also act as an unlock for merch, et cetera, et cetera. But literally all you would have to do once. Well, right now, if you contact us, we will help you set up a decentralized storefront for when we launch in a month.
00:29:37.080 - 00:29:52.454, Speaker B: And so, yeah, you would have your own storefront, completely free. Boson charges a 0.5% protocol fee for all transactions. And then you would be able to sell these physical things as NFTs via boson.
00:29:52.582 - 00:30:13.930, Speaker A: Well, that's a lot better than two and a half percent from Openc. So already that's very attractive. Well, listen, Justin, my next guest is ready to rock and roll with this, but thanks so much for taking the time. I think you're onto something and I think you know that already. I can see it in your eyes. You know, this is going to go big, but I think we had a.
00:30:13.940 - 00:30:15.570, Speaker B: Vision and it's coming to pass.
00:30:15.640 - 00:30:41.574, Speaker A: So we're enjoying it and it's. Literally every single item in the world could be sent through bosom. It's very exciting. Well, listen, thanks so much for joining us. We are about to be joined by Dan Sickles, the director behind Newheart XYz. But first we must hear from our sponsors.

00:31:40.928 - 00:31:41.786, Speaker C: Can you hear me now?
00:31:41.888 - 00:31:43.386, Speaker A: I can hear you now. I can hear you now.
00:31:43.408 - 00:31:53.278, Speaker C: How are you, sir? I'm bringing the streets of New York to your studio. It turns out that the office next to my office had a leak, so we're outside today.
00:31:53.444 - 00:32:00.466, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Well, that's fresh. At least you got sunshine there. It's been pissing down the rain here for the last God knows how many weeks.
00:32:00.648 - 00:32:01.762, Speaker C: It's not too bad.
00:32:01.896 - 00:32:24.234, Speaker A: Yeah, nice. Good to see you too. Listen, we must talk about the film. I mean, there's so much to dig into with this entire project. But I'll tell you what, let's go back and talk about you. Give the people at home a little sense of who you are, where you've come from, and your journey to get here because you've done some stuff, man.
00:32:24.432 - 00:32:49.490, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. I'm a nonfiction filmmaker maker by trade. I've been working in the industry, I'd say, for over a decade now, making independent film, largely in the nonfiction genre. I guess. I made my first feature film. I started production in that in about 2010. That film is called Mala Mala, and it took me about three and a half years to make.
00:32:49.490 - 00:33:02.162, Speaker C: It documents the trans liberation movement that was occurring in Puerto Rico at the time. That film premiered in theaters in 2014 after premiering at the Tribeca Film Festival.
00:33:02.306 - 00:33:11.526, Speaker A: Yes, it's the Tribeca bit that really kind of made me sit up and take notice, because not many films get into Tribeca. It's kind of like Sundance, but on the east coast.
00:33:11.718 - 00:33:47.454, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. No, it was like a huge mean. It was wild, and that was my first film and first premiere experience, and we were able to bring all of the cast from Puerto Rico to come, which was wild. We put together an incredible drag show. And, yeah, it was an experience, for sure. And I went from that then to making my second film, basically straight from Malamala into making a film called Dina, which came out in theaters in 2017 after premiering at the Sundance Film Festival. And we won the grand jury.
00:33:47.454 - 00:33:49.042, Speaker C: Sundance Tick yeah.
00:33:49.096 - 00:34:13.894, Speaker A: So if you don't know, what Dan has done here is basically, he did it. If you're a young, aspiring filmmaker and you're in the independent film business, Sundance, everybody wants to be in Sundance, and there are more films submitted to Sundance than any other film festival in the world. It's that competitive. So you get in there, you did it. You did a great job. But to win a grand jury prize, I mean, that's serious.
00:34:14.022 - 00:35:13.950, Speaker C: Yeah, no, it was ridiculous. Honestly. I think the speech is still online somewhere, and every now and then someone finds it, and then they hit me up about it, because I think I got up and I remember just making some sort of comment about peeing my pants in front of everybody, just how nervous I was to actually just be standing up there, because I remember Gael Garcia Bernal was there and Peter Dinklage was sitting in the front row, and really incredibly, incredibly talented people that I've just admired for so long, and all of a sudden, I'm just holding some award, and they're looking at me, and I'm like, what am I supposed to say? Because to be real. I mean, that film, Dina, was made entirely independently, know, put together by financing from people that, you know, we got the last money together. Basically, when that film was basically at a rough cut, it was a slog to get that film together, because it's a film that really rides on the shoulders of a middle aged woman on the spectrum in suburban Philadelphia who isn't famous. Sell it.
00:35:14.100 - 00:35:19.570, Speaker A: Just sell it, man. I can imagine the pitches for that. So it's a middle aged woman.
00:35:23.030 - 00:35:55.694, Speaker C: It was wild and whatever. I've also sort of become very comfortable in those situations, in those rooms, right, where you're like, hey, I have this idea, and you see it in their face. I understand 10% of what this guy's talking about or what this could be or whatever, and 90% of the time now, I'm realizing that it's really just my job to really throw my hat over the fence and figure out a way to just get it made, especially in situations like this. Especially with a film. Like with this one, too.
00:35:55.892 - 00:36:16.414, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think what a lot of people don't understand, because YouTubers have made it appear that filmmaking is easy. And I think you can content create at a very low cost, at a very high frequency with relative ease. But filmmaking, particularly documentary, like, I don't know what your ratio in your edits was, but usually you throw away most of what you shoot.
00:36:16.542 - 00:36:46.160, Speaker C: It doesn't even end up in the mean, like. But I think the first two trips to Puerto Rico, I feel like we spent, like, a month there filming, and I don't think any of that footage is in the final film, mostly because that was us just even figuring out what that film was. Same with Dina. I mean, Dina, if you watch that film, it's pretty seamless. It plays like a narrative film. It plays like a rom.com. But it was a very tedious process, and like, a very tedious film to make.
00:36:46.160 - 00:37:14.440, Speaker C: And I guess that there are maybe easy films. There are films that have been easy to make. For me. I think that I always want to give my film legs. I want to create media that lasts. I want to create films that are cinematic and can be looked at ten years after they come out and still have some sort of relevance to the present moment. And that, I think, is really what takes time.
00:37:14.440 - 00:37:26.426, Speaker C: It takes a lot of listening and a lot of studying and a lot of writing and rewriting and editing and reediting. So, yeah, that's largely my process for how I attack this work.
00:37:26.608 - 00:38:02.530, Speaker A: Yeah. When people hear about screenwriters, they think the screenwriter writes the script and then that gets shot, and then it gets edited according to the script, and then that's it. And what they don't realize is that there's a director that has several heart attacks because they know that the film doesn't work. And then they give it to their editor and their editor goes, I think we can fix this. And then they spend pretty much all day, every day, over caffeinated fixing stuff because you don't know what it's going to be. And also, the thing is, if you're creating a film, you rarely get enough time to really figure it out to do. Like, in the old days, they did screenshots.
00:38:02.530 - 00:38:13.318, Speaker A: You'd have people together. You figure it out on set, and the first two weeks you're terrible. And so you edit and you do reshoots and everyone's like, why are you reshooting?
00:38:13.334 - 00:38:13.626, Speaker C: It's like.
00:38:13.648 - 00:38:14.890, Speaker A: Because it sucked.
00:38:15.470 - 00:38:36.210, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. And, I mean, that's affected the way that I approach filming now, too. I think for new here, for this film that I'm working on now, I'm right now working on a sequence in Tyler Hobbes's studio. He's working on incomplete control, which is actually the drop that he had before QQL. Actually, yesterday.
00:38:36.630 - 00:38:46.534, Speaker A: Oh, my God. QQL, dude. Are you kidding me? And then that same 24 hours later, a punk sells for 3300.
00:38:46.572 - 00:38:50.150, Speaker C: Efds are dead.
00:38:53.290 - 00:38:54.150, Speaker A: Totally.
00:38:54.730 - 00:39:31.442, Speaker C: But working with Tyler, sort of attacking that scene and looking at it, I very intentionally shot it in ways that make that scene flexible. Right. There are so many different ways of doing that. But looking at where it's going to fit into the overall edit, it's like, I now know the three different ways that can play in the film. And all of that is going to be a different edit, and it's going to be braided in differently depending on where it lands. Because it's kind of like with the doc, you're just kind of putting a puzzle together and seeing what the pieces are first before you can even make them click.
00:39:31.576 - 00:39:50.438, Speaker A: I know. I think that's sort of what's so difficult for anyone who hasn't made a documentary to understand that what you're making is not the truth. It's a fiction in the same way that anything is a fiction. But it's just grounded in real people's lives and real people's stories. It's amazing you do in the edit.
00:39:50.534 - 00:40:05.420, Speaker C: Yeah, but not the truth. I like to think that I'm making very honest work, but, yeah, no, it's definitely not like any sort of objective. Yeah, I don't make that thing for sure.
00:40:07.630 - 00:40:26.680, Speaker A: Let's talk about you here. So we know now that you're a hellaciously good filmmaker, and anyone who can actually make this a career, particularly in niche indie documentaries like you have, I mean, you must be good at it. So now we find our way into the NFT space. What was your journey into this? How did you get excited about it?
00:40:27.770 - 00:41:24.834, Speaker C: To be honest, it was through being disappointed, I guess, through working in film, in the traditional landscape, the way in which films are born nowadays, it's even harder than I think it was ten years ago because everything is really geared towards streamers and sort of like, what will appear to the three or four players that still have money, basically, in the industry. So it homogenizes a lot of the ideas that are going on right now. I mean, you see it in what's being produced. I mean, there's two documentaries about the fire festival. We don't even know how many Jeffrey Dahmer films and series there are out right now. So it makes it extraordinarily difficult to pitch anything novel or new. And I did break through, actually, that, and I was working with a streamer.
00:41:24.834 - 00:41:35.340, Speaker C: I actually had pitched a series that I was directing, I had developed, I was writing and producing all of it. And it was one of the.
00:41:37.710 - 00:41:38.074, Speaker A: Most.
00:41:38.112 - 00:42:34.830, Speaker C: Empowering experiences of my entire life, to be honest. And sort of like, the work relationship just wasn't healthy at all. And that was a project that unfortunately, I had to leave. And around that time was really when I started learning about web3 and crypto art and NFTs and I mean, really crypto in general, and sort of like looking under the hood to a place that I left in 2017. I got into crypto then, but then left during the bear and didn't really sell because I was like, well, I'm down so bad, I may as well just leave it there, right? But then came back to it and started looking under the hood and it was like, whoa, there is crazy culture happening here, being created by some wild artists. I mean, you look at rare Pepe's and it's fun. And it was sort of like this rediscovery of the Internet for me and sort of reinvention of the idea of online communities for me.
00:42:34.830 - 00:43:21.258, Speaker C: And it hit me at the right time, for sure. And I saw what a lot of artists were talking about in terms of ownership and how they were feeling empowered in this space to make work, but also the way in which they could distribute it. And for me, sort of coming off the back of that, I was like, this is it. This is inevitable, for sure. And if I'm going to spend a lot of time learning more and more about it, diving deeper and deeper into it, then I may as well try and do what I know how to do better than trade NFTs, right? And that's make a film about why this is relevant, what's going on here. And that's the project that we really started about 16 months ago called New here.
00:43:21.424 - 00:43:57.960, Speaker A: So this is new here. And I totally understand what you're saying here because I did the same thing. Your instinctive kind of research brain kicks in and then it becomes a story, and you become fascinated by the story, which is why me having a chance to talk to people on these streams and hear their stories is just so edifying. But tell me about the process, because I know it hasn't been straightforward figuring out how you do a project like this, and you're not the first film that has had NFTs connected, but I think the way you're doing it and how you've got here can tell other projects that might be thinking about this a lot.
00:43:58.750 - 00:44:53.674, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. Again, we knew that we wanted to make this film about a year and a half ago. And for me, I very intentionally make every effort to make films of the subject matter that I'm working with, not just like, films that are talking at them or just like, pointing at them and saying, this is what this is. Right? So everything from putting my team together, I mean, my producers, I have an entirely crypto native team from my producers to the VFX and digital animators. But we wanted to do that for the fundraising, too. And we spent months figuring out how to actually offer true securities in fundraising for this film, and literally hours with multiple lawyers, tens of thousands of dollars. I think on the very practical level, about a $1.2
00:44:53.674 - 00:45:24.180, Speaker C: million raise would end up costing around $100,000, just in terms of logistic costs. So it became such a burden and such a heavy lift in the process of trying to get started that we ultimately had to let it lie. We know very much what the problems are. We know what the obstacles are in making something like that happen and seamless in the future. So it is something that we're looking to attack down the line.
00:45:26.310 - 00:45:33.026, Speaker A: The regulation just isn't there. There's no clarity, and there's no secondary market for any of that stuff anyway. So it's completely illiquid.
00:45:33.218 - 00:46:02.720, Speaker C: Exactly. And if you're in a situation where you can afford to hire a great team of lawyers to stand up to the SEC, then more power to you. And there are people in this space that are sort of looking to have that conversation in a very active way. And I'm talking to them for sure. But I'm trying to make a film. I'm trying to square one. Make the film that explains whatever, even SEC regulators, why this space is relevant at like that, I think happens in the form of story best.
00:46:02.720 - 00:46:14.820, Speaker C: So that's why we were like, okay, the securities thing, it can hang here for the moment. We'll get back to that. We will tackle that eventually. The tech is there, the will is there for sure.
00:46:16.230 - 00:46:19.220, Speaker A: How much time did you spend going down that dead end?
00:46:20.810 - 00:46:25.558, Speaker C: We spent the better part of, I would say ten months. 1011 months.
00:46:25.564 - 00:46:32.810, Speaker A: Oh my gosh. So you started in the middle of a bull market when everything was exciting and wow. And it took you all the way out of that bull market.
00:46:32.880 - 00:46:42.394, Speaker C: I guess, yeah, we could definitely frame it like that, but yeah, that's exactly what we were doing.
00:46:42.592 - 00:46:48.606, Speaker A: You just wanted to max paint it. That's fine, man. You're a filmmaker. It's the starving artist thing, isn't it?
00:46:48.628 - 00:46:55.354, Speaker C: Nonfiction filmmaker. Literally tried to put together this film that involves over 100 artists and thinkers.
00:46:55.402 - 00:46:56.498, Speaker A: And so much travel.
00:46:56.584 - 00:47:43.300, Speaker C: So I guess I am a bit of a masochist when it comes to it, but yeah, man, no, I guess I'm very process oriented. And I think that at the start was the novel thing I wanted to be able to say to people at the start, you can be a profit participant in this film, and even if you have $30, even if you have $10, that's all good. You can come in there, be part of the community and do this with us. Yeah, we know sort of all the obstacles that are there, and that's a whole other conversation. But in that time, then we pivoted and we came up with this dope drop that really celebrates the cast of this film and the people making it with us.
00:47:44.870 - 00:47:50.498, Speaker A: Tell me about the drop and how it's all put together. You've got some interesting things going on here.
00:47:50.664 - 00:48:36.034, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So basically we've made pixelated avatars of our entire cast, and we're taking all of their traits. There's over 1000 traits. And we're actually adding, I think about 65 more because of the orders that came in at the last minute a few days ago. But we're taking all of those traits and generating a 10,000 avatar collection using these. So basically, you can get Joy world's head with Coldy's 3d glasses and Tyler Hobbes's body with snowfrow's chromy squiggle. And we just think it's like a dope way of actually celebrating, again, the diversity, the spectrum, the vibrancy within the space.
00:48:36.232 - 00:48:49.598, Speaker A: And this is a great selection of people here as well. This is like the who's who roll call of, literally, because covers a lot of different viewpoints. I don't think all these people necessarily agree with each other as well, but this is.
00:48:49.624 - 00:48:49.986, Speaker C: They don't.
00:48:50.018 - 00:48:52.086, Speaker A: This is awesome. No, they don't.
00:48:52.108 - 00:49:05.900, Speaker C: That's actually something that lives in the film and part of putting this oral history together that I'm really excited for people to see because it isn't monolithic in here at all. And there are lots of conversations happening inside of it, for sure.
00:49:06.350 - 00:49:41.734, Speaker A: Now, the biggest problem that any documentary filmmaker has is what's my ending? And I know that you've probably sat there and thought, how the fuck do I finish the thing? Because the NFT space is always evolving. I made a film in two weeks, which was an hour and a half long, and it was just me just collecting all the stuff that I did. I was like, even during the making that I was just like, there is no way for me to finish this film unless I just finish it. I have to stop because you just keep going and keep going. So do you know what your ending is? And you can say no, but I'm curious if, you know, I have a.
00:49:41.772 - 00:50:16.914, Speaker C: Very deep sense of what the end shot is for sure. I know in terms of the thesis, I know in terms of the themes, sort of what my biggest question is right now. And it's kind of the eternal one that's being asked in this space. And it's very much related to the relationship between art and money when airdrop, how we reconcile these things. When airdrop. When Lambo. Yeah, basically everybody who buys one of these NFTs from new here will be receiving a lambo in due time.
00:50:17.112 - 00:50:23.940, Speaker A: You heard it here, folks. Folks, quote, Lambo is for everyone. Lambo is for you. Lambo is for you.
00:50:27.910 - 00:50:59.546, Speaker C: One thing, too, that I like to point out is like 15% of this drop, the gross revenue in perpetuity is actually going to the cast involved in it. So we have all of their wallets. We are automating it as we get all those wallets in because, again, managing all those conversations is a bit complicated. But that's part of the beauty of this tech, is that we can actually sort of build that into the contract. So as this project does well, the entire ecosystem of this project is lifted.
00:50:59.658 - 00:51:38.074, Speaker A: I know. And isn't it just so frustrating that as a filmmaker or a creative or an artist, or. You always have to apply for funding, and it's always this excruciatingly long winded process whereby you fall out of love with your own project because you've just had to pitch it to so many people so many times. And then we have these barriers in the way, which is, oh, no, this is a security, and therefore you cannot do it. And it's like, why are we making it so hard for people to share in the creation of things that are really kind of valuable? Because for sure, I don't think anybody knows how to value them. That's the problem. So it's always this kind of, what is the value of our.
00:51:38.074 - 00:51:56.126, Speaker A: Where do we place this value in the context of. It's a really tough question. And someone big ed fro me just literally put a question out. So this NFT drop is crowdfunding for a movie. I don't think that's entirely correct. Right. You're not just crowdfunding for a movie.
00:51:56.126 - 00:52:00.530, Speaker A: You're actually trying to reinvent movies on the blockchain.
00:52:01.270 - 00:52:31.100, Speaker C: I mean, that's actually definitely part of what we're doing. The initial drop, all of that will be going towards funding the rest of this film. So again, the priority is funding the film. Parallel to that, though, we are creating an archive that's going to store basically all of this footage. Something that we've spoken on, actually, is the work is to make a singular film right now. And we've shot over 200 hours with different people in the space. Right.
00:52:31.100 - 00:53:05.782, Speaker C: Something I like talking about is actually, I just got a cut down of just the story of rare pepes a few weeks ago. And in my mind I was like, okay, cool. This is going to be a solid 40 minutes, including everybody that I've spoken to rare pepes about. And it'll be really solid. And I get the download, and it's an hour and 40 minutes long, just with using probably two dozen voices in the space to just talk about the rare Pepe story. And that's something that I would like to live somewhere. And that, again, using this tech, we can actually make that happen.
00:53:05.782 - 00:53:50.534, Speaker C: So, parallel to the film, we are actually building an archive that is going to be interoperable within several different metaverses. And also accessible online just by virtue of a website. And you'll be able to check everything out there as things continue. Depending on how this drop goes. What we plan to do is actually directly attack, sort of how we can make crowdfunding for collaborative arts projects in that way more accessible, more seamless using this technology because it's all there. We really just actually need to power our lawyers on a bit more to figure out sort of the granular details of how we can make that happen. So there's a lot going on.
00:53:50.534 - 00:54:11.280, Speaker C: I mean, like any sort of NFT project, it's very iceberg y and sort of the tip of it is actually creating this film which again, is a film that is really working to speak to people who aren't in this space, who don't already speak this language, who don't know anything about NFTs and really work to demystify it and make it less scary for them to enter it.
00:54:11.810 - 00:54:46.440, Speaker A: Yeah, big mission. But I think there's probably something for everybody in this space if they can get past the kind of the toxic debates and the wrong turns and everything else. It's funny talking to Justin before about how any item can be given a digital twin that's an NFT and then easily sold, traded and you're just taking commerce and removing Amazon from that know, here we're taking filmmaking and culture and art and removing platforms from the equation. And who doesn't want that? Oh, yeah, the.
00:54:47.610 - 00:55:04.462, Speaker C: Exactly. Exactly. And I think that that's something that you and I, I think pretty personally are pretty excited about how we can sort of liberate the creation of culture are. And I think that we have a few ideas as to how to make that happen.
00:55:04.596 - 00:55:58.446, Speaker A: Yeah, well, people in the chat have been wondering why I've said this is my last stream ever and I'm also obsessed with the same things that you are, attacking it from a different angle, attacking the audience piece. Because I think if you get the audience bit right, then the rest of it becomes exponentially easier. But yes, this is my last stream ever for the Defiant and you were my last guest ever for the Defiant. I couldn't think of a better one. So, Dan, thanks so much. And if you haven't checked in on the new here drop, it's new here XYZ. And if you want to support a Sundance winning filmmaker making a film that will, I have no doubt, will be the textbook go to for what this space genuinely truly is about, then go help him out and help get it made because we support our own.
