00:00:00.250 - 00:00:55.882, Speaker A: There's a lot of hype around restaking, liquid restaking points and airdrops related to these systems. But just be aware that the core of all of this, there will be something built on top of Eigen layer which can generate this yield, this restaking yield that people are betting on, that people are deploying literally billions of dollars in in order to get down the line. You need something real underneath all of these incentives. All right, welcome to crypto with Cammy, where we go through all the main headlines in crypto and Defi in the past week in 30 minutes or less. This is the show for the week starting February 5. The biggest trend this week was in Ethereum restaking with Eigen layer lifting the cap on its liquid staking token pools. We also covered moves in the real world asset sector.
00:00:55.882 - 00:01:26.214, Speaker A: There's a hot new token standard in town, the ERC 404. There were a few new token launches, airdrops, and announcements. The Salana blockchain went down for a few hours at the start of the week, so there was a lot going on. But yeah. Let's start with the biggest news, restaking and Eigen layer. And I'll give you my hot take after the main headline. Eigen layer is one of the biggest developments in crypto in the past couple of months.
00:01:26.214 - 00:02:06.230, Speaker A: It introduced an entirely new primitive with restaking, and it's now become the fifth largest DeFi protocol by TBL. Unseating uniswap this week, it became even bigger by removing the caps on its liquid staking token pools for the first time on February 5. The window for uncapped pools closes today, February 9, at 08:00 p.m.. Eastern. So with the limits off, Eigen layer's Tvl more than doubled to almost 6 billion from 2.2 billion at the start of the week. Data from Dunalytics shows that Eigen layer currently holds over 10% of all LST supply.
00:02:06.230 - 00:03:20.446, Speaker A: So Eigen layer supports twelve LSTs. Lido staked ETH account for more than half of Eigen layer's liquid staking TvL followed by swells SW ETH at 12%, mantles M e with 10%, and stators ethx with 5.6%. So what this means is that anyone can deposit their liquid staking tokens on Eigen layer to start earning Ethereum staking yields plus Eigen layer staking yields, plus all the other airdrops and points that are being layered on top to incentivize these protocols. So we've just seen explosive growth of Eigen layer since it launched. And let's backtrack a little bit to understand what restaking is all about. First, let's establish this is all happening on Ethereum, which of course is now a proof of stake network. It transitioned from proof of work.
00:03:20.446 - 00:04:17.470, Speaker A: That means nodes or validators are required to make deposits in ETH, Ethereum's native currency, or to stake ETH to secure the network. So far, so good. Now, the responsibilities of running your own node and the requirement of staking 32 ETH, or multiples of 32 ETH isn't for everyone. So there are middleware services which allow users to stake any amount of ETH and delegate the operations of running a node and being a validator. These services also issue tokenized representations of users stake ETH, and these are called liquid staking tokens, or LSTs. Lido and rocket pool are the largest liquid staking providers. There is now 32 billion in lucrative staking tokens, and they represent about half of all ETH staked.
00:04:17.470 - 00:04:53.798, Speaker A: Okay, now we know staking, we know liquid staking. Now the next step is restaking. And here's where Eigen layer comes in. So, Eigen layer is the first protocol which allows stakers in the Ethereum network to use their stake ETH to secure other protocols, not just ethereum. That's why the process Eigen layer enables is called to restake or to stake. Again, it works in two ways. Users can either restake natively or stake via a liquid staking token.
00:04:53.798 - 00:05:50.906, Speaker A: So when you stake natively, you're staking ETH directly on Ethereum and then redirecting your withdrawal credentials to Eigen layer. Or you can deposit liquid staking tokens on Eigen layer. And this is what it looks like, basically. So here we're on the Eigen layer app, and you can create an Eigen pod where you redirect your credentials and deposit beacon chain ETH or stake ETH. Or you can use all of these liquid staking tokens to deposit to Eigen layer. So the idea here is that stakers can now get Ethereum staking yield and on top of that staking yield from other protocols that are using Eigen layer to subcontract Ethereum's base layer security. So we know now staking, liquid staking and restaking.
00:05:50.906 - 00:07:03.550, Speaker A: The next step is liquid restaking. So now that we have this new primitive with Eigen layer where users can restake or reuse or stake ETH on other protocols, there are new middleware protocols that become the interface for Eigen layer, allowing users to deposit ETH and liquid staking tokens to liquid restaking protocols, VSAR, Etherfi, Puffer Finance, Kelpdao, Rensto and others. So these protocols take these deposits of ETH or LSTs and deploy them on Eigen layer. In exchange, they give users a representation of their restaked ETH in a liquid restaking token. The idea is that now the trader earns Ethereum staking rewards, Eigen layer restaking rewards, and on top of that they have a liquid token that they can use elsewhere in DFI to continue generating more money on top of that. So there is about 2.7 billion in liquid restaking protocols according to DFI llama.
00:07:03.550 - 00:07:52.450, Speaker A: So we see how the sector was basically inexistent as of just last year, and now it's skyrocketed to over 2 billion. Etherfi is the largest protocol, followed by puff for kelp, Renso, Eigenpie and so on. So really a booming sector in the staking restaking liquid versions of it all. Now let's go quickly to the fundamentals. The goal of Eigen layer is to make staking more efficient. They are using staked ETH to secure more than just ethereum. So Eigen layer lets builders focus on their specific DApPs or protocols without needing to create their own validator sets, set up complex consensus mechanisms, or launch their native tokens if they don't want to.
00:07:52.450 - 00:08:40.846, Speaker A: To understand what actually happens when you deposit on Eigen layer, there are two key terms you need to know. Operators and actively validated services, or AVs. AVSs are the Dapps and protocols that use Eigen layer to bootstrap their own security. They can range from simple apps or services to complicated protocols that look kind of like independent L ones. Now, operators run software on behalf of these AVSs. Their role is pretty similar to a role of a validator on Ethereum. So you have Eigen layer operators running software and securing stake for AVSs and AVSs are these Dapps and protocols building on top of Eigen layer.
00:08:40.846 - 00:09:19.566, Speaker A: So when you restake on Eigen layer, you're delegating your ETH to these operators. And these operators will choose to secure different AVSs building on Eigen layer. And each AVs will have its own separate security and slashing rules. So this obviously introduces new risk for stakers. You know, have the risk of getting slashed on Ethereum, plus the risk of getting slashed on the AVs you're securing. Slashing happens when validators or operators misbehave. So just be sure that you know the risk that you're taking.
00:09:19.566 - 00:09:49.510, Speaker A: Here's the key. The key for this all to work, in my opinion, is in AVs. It's where the extra staking yield comes from. They need to generate enough fees to pass on to operators and restakers. That means there needs to be enough economic activity happening on top of these Dapps on protocols. So what are these abs? Let's take a look. Eigen layer's website lists them.
00:09:49.510 - 00:10:15.294, Speaker A: Let's see. I have them here. Okay, so here's eigen layer website shows their whole ecosystem. You can go through who their operators are and also what the AVSs are. So there's between 15 and 16 AVss. And you can see here. So Eigen layer has its own Abs.
00:10:15.294 - 00:10:40.630, Speaker A: Eigen da. It's the first Abs on Eigen layer. It empowers roll ups with cost efficient hyperscale throughput and data availability. So that's one avs. It's built by Eigen layer itself. Then you have others ethos alt layer. AlT layers is the only AVs so far with a token blockless drocera network.
00:10:40.630 - 00:11:46.794, Speaker A: Espresso ethos. And you look at the descriptions of all these and they're pretty kind of arcane or complicated sort of infrastructure for blockchains. They're not dapps that any kind of end user would usually interact with. So ethos is a modular and decentralized policy engine tailored for compliance. Alt layer is a decentralized interlayer for roll ups using Eigen layer for fast finality. Blockless verifiable computing engine economically incentivized via restaking espresso decentralized sequencing using restaking for ethereum hyperlane using Eigen layer to enable interchange app developers to secure messaging using restake, economic security, et cetera. These are all pretty early stage tabs, chains and protocols.
00:11:46.794 - 00:12:40.080, Speaker A: They have no at this point significant adoption or users. So there are many risks to eigen layer. But to me this is the core premise they need to fulfill in order for the system to work. Their proposition needs to be strong enough for valuable teams to decide to bootstrap their security via eigen layer. Whether this will happen is still TBD in my opinion. For now, yield for restakers is coming from points and potential airdrops that the different layers in the system are deploying everyone from restaking protocols to AVSs. I don't know if operators are deploying points, but egg and layer itself is deploying points.
00:12:40.080 - 00:13:41.620, Speaker A: This is where the yield is currently coming from. These points which down the line are expected to become airdrops. Now what happens when all of those incentives run out, something real needs to remain under all of these token airdrops, and maybe it's what's getting built out. There's no doubt that Eigen layer's innovation is huge. The promise makes a lot of sense. It makes sense to make stake more efficient and to use Ethereum's security for other chains and protocols and dapps built on Ethereum. But it's also true that you're introducing new layers of risk and you're making assumptions about adoption of this entirely new system that hasn't been proven out yet.
00:13:41.620 - 00:14:41.910, Speaker A: So there's a lot of hype around restaking liquid restaking points and airdrops related to these systems. But just be aware that the core of all of this is that there will be Dapps chains. There will be something built on top of Eigen layer which can generate this yield, this restaking yield that people are betting on, that people are deploying literally billions of dollars in in order to get down the line. I know that they're actually deploying this to get these points, but again, this will run out at some point. And then what do we have? You need something real underneath all of these incentives. So that's my take. Let's get on to other headlines.
00:14:41.910 - 00:16:04.098, Speaker A: So more SEC being bad for defi? Surprise, surprise. So the SEC expands its definition for securities dealer to include defi market makers, or better known as LPs, liquidity providers. So February 6, the SEC passed two new rules expanding the definition of a financial securities dealer, with three votes in favor, two votes against. The new rules expand the definition of regular business activities to classify all liquidity providers commanding at least $50 million worth of assets, and those are deemed to comprise securities as dealers, including entities operating on Dexes. So the SEC now defines a digital assets dealer as a person engaged in a regular pattern of buying and selling crypto asset securities that has the effect of providing liquidity to other market participants. Liquidity providers trading less than $50 million in assets are exempt from the rule. The new guidelines will take effect 60 days after being published to the federal registrar, with market participants required to comply with the rule one year after that date.
00:16:04.098 - 00:17:27.942, Speaker A: It will likely be April 2025. So the changes were opposed by Hester Pierce and Mark Uyeda, but found support from commissioners, obviously Gary Gensler and other two. What's controversial about this is that what they're saying is liquidity providers have to register as securities dealer for dealing in over 50 million of crypto. But so far, the SEC has yet to actually define what constitutes a security in crypto. So they're setting all these rules for LPs indexes without resolving the underlying issue, which of course the industry has been asking for clarity for years and years now, but still remains in a gray area. What actually constitutes a security in crypto next in the real world asset front? Super interesting. Mountain protocol is a new contender in the field that has very quickly climbed the ranks.
00:17:27.942 - 00:19:05.818, Speaker A: So just four months after its September launch, modem protocol stablecoin USDM has become the second largest asset in the US treasury backed sector and the largest treasury backed stablecoin, according to RWA XYC. So in this chart you see Franklin Templeton's on chain treasury fund, and then second to that is Mountain protocol's USDM. And this growth also made mountain protocol the third largest RWA protocol by TVL after maker and Ondo finance. So definitely something to watch. USDMs this mountain protocols stablecoin the key feature is that it currently returns 5% APY to holders from passing on yield of US treasuries. Also in RWA, Ondo Finance is now offering its stablecoin on the sui network Ondo stablecoin like mountain protocol, stablecoin also passes on treasury yield to holders. And next up is the hot new token standard, ERC 404.
00:19:05.818 - 00:20:01.802, Speaker A: Super interesting. So this token combines the liquid tradable nature of ERC twenty s and the non fungible aspect of ERC 721. So the first token, or one of the first tokens to use this standard, is Pandora, which spiked to over $100 million in market cap since its February 2 launch. The way this new token standard works is super interesting. So Pandora issued 10,000 ERC 20 tokens along with 10,000 replicant NFTs. If a user buys one full Pandora token, one replicant NFT is automatically minted to their wallet. Conversely, if that user sells their Pandora token, the linked NFT is burned.
00:20:01.802 - 00:21:19.910, Speaker A: So when you buy these ERC 404 tokens, you get two tokens, a tradable liquid ERC 20 like token and NFT. So definitely a new development to watch. Another hyped up launch was Morpheus AI. This new DAP and its token attracted over $50 million less than a day after launching. Eric Voorhees is involved in the project, and Morpheus aims to make web three more accessible by providing neutral chat GPT like chat interfaces, enabling users to easily buy, sell, trade, do different operations in Defi via a chat like interface. So to incentivize a network, Morpheus is launching its Mor token and traders can deposit stake ETH to get MoR emissions. This had tons of interest on the launch.
00:21:19.910 - 00:22:17.670, Speaker A: More token launches and announcements we have sorry Wormhole, the popular cross chain bridge unveiled its tokenomics and upcoming airdrop. The W token will have a total supply of 10 billion tokens, of which 11% will be airdropped to the community. The snapshot was already taken and a date for the airdrop wasn't disclosed. Next up is pith network, which announced the second phase of its airdrop. Pith Network is an Oracle provider. It said its pith tokens will be distributed to over 160 DFi applications that use its data. The project will distribute 100 million pith, worth nearly $50 million at the time of writing to web three applications across a broad range of use cases.
00:22:17.670 - 00:23:11.634, Speaker A: Next was dimension. Dimension also launched Mainnet with a 300 million dollar airdrop. Dimension is a cosmos based modular blockchain and launched its main net with its dym token, so eligible claimants can now access their tokens by connecting their wallets to the network. Dim started trading at around $4 and that gives the project a fully diluted valuation of 4 billion. The team allocated 70 million dim, or about 7% of the supply, to the airdrop. Okay, I'll run through the last few headlines. Frax launched a modular layer two blockchain.
00:23:11.634 - 00:24:17.178, Speaker A: Fraxtal leverages the optimism stack and will airdrop FTXL points to VeFX stakers following the Farcaster frenzy. Now obviously there are tokens involved. There are different community based tokens being launched on base. The Coinbase layer two DGen was one of the most popular ones, surging over 150,000,000 in market cap. It seems like the meme coin frenzy in Solana has now moved over to base thanks to Farcaster. Another Solana linked news is that the Solana blockchain had an outage of 5 hours early this week. Solana had almost gone a year without an outage, but this broke its streak.
00:24:17.178 - 00:25:14.370, Speaker A: Of course. As you guys probably know, Solana was famous for having degraded operations, degraded performance, I should say, and outages. It's been plagued with these issues. We had this outage once more sold price lid. I think it's pretty concerning, to be honest, that a huge layer one is still having these issues. So hopefully they're able to solve it and we get a more stable blockchain because they've made so much progress in the past few months. Next up we have a couple of big name announcements.
00:25:14.370 - 00:26:07.700, Speaker A: Metamask adds Robinhood integration US users will be able to fund their non custodial wallets through Robinhood Connect. And this is a big one as well. Ethereum name service announced a partnership with GoDaddy, one of the biggest DNS providers. So what happens with this is that Godaddy's domain name holders can now easily link their addresses to ens names without requiring technical expertise or additional fees. And finally, we have a date for Ethereum's Dencoon update, which is March 13. Denkun will reduce layer two transaction fees. So that's all for this week.
00:26:07.700 - 00:26:47.600, Speaker A: I hope you enjoyed this update. Let me know your thoughts on liquid restaking, restaking, liquid staking and eigen layer. I also want to do a quick shout out to degate, our sponsor check them out. They're having an exclusive airdrop for defiant readers. You need to qualify as an active defi trader and from then on you can get dgate tokens. So check it out, it's in our website. Look for Dgate exclusive airdrop event.
00:26:47.600 - 00:26:58.940, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely worth participating if you're an active defi trader. So thank you so much for watching and see you next week.
