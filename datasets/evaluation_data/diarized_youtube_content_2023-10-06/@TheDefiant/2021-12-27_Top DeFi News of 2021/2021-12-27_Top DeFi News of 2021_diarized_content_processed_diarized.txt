00:00:00.250 - 00:00:35.458, Speaker A: So we're almost through what will be remembered as one of the most significant years in blockchain history. We were already posting videos in 2020, but this was the year we properly began posting in volume. The Monday quick take has been one of our most popular strands, a short, opinionated stab at the stories making the headlines. And what's fascinating going back through them is to see what was hitting the headlines and how many of those stories are still relevant now. EIP 1559 EIp one I five nine uni version three, uniswap version three. But anyone remember the uranium exploit? We're going to go deeper like that reactor shit. We got to go uranium.
00:00:35.458 - 00:01:27.334, Speaker A: Yeah bro, that shit going to blow up and blow up it has not once but twice. All the arrival of some new bit part metaverse player and the name meta. Well, who on earth is this guy? A single anonymous whoa. You, the humble viewer, are the surest metric we have for what was tickling your tonsils this past year, and we'll get to all of that after these messages from our sponsors. Defi users, you no longer need to pay expensive and unpredictable interest rates on your ETH loans. Liquidity, a decentralized borrowing protocol, allows you to borrow against your ETH. Interest free loans are paid out in LUSD, a USD pegged stablecoin, and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio as low as 110%.
00:01:27.334 - 00:02:32.030, Speaker A: To learn more, head over to liquidity.org defiant to get started and get the most out of your borrowing needs today, so let's just break it down by views. The top three quick takes of the year were at number three, announcing anchor's 20% fixed rate of interest 20% anchor protocol ranks high on my shortlist of D five projects of the year, and it's no surprise that our terra content has consistently ranked highest throughout the year. Coming in at number two was our coverage of Mark Cuban's epic fail in Titan. Can you hear that? That soft whispery sound that bang? Commenters on the video couldn't believe how well I'd nailed the cuban accent. I am a small LP for quickswap, and if you enjoyed that impression, I actually doubled down as Charles Hoskinson and Mark danced the Texas two step on Twitter in this video for Cardano.
00:02:39.090 - 00:02:52.690, Speaker B: Cuban, what stops you from reviewing the King Cardano Ada take fundamentals, usage, energy consumption. It will beat everything in all dimensions.
00:02:54.230 - 00:03:08.326, Speaker C: Are you personally able to use Ada for anything? If so, what have you used it for? That's the question I ask about all crypto. Do you find yourself using it for anything that you find value in, you're.
00:03:08.358 - 00:03:15.450, Speaker D: Breaking my heart, Mark. But levity aside, come by the farm in Colorado sometime and let's chat.
00:03:19.550 - 00:03:25.182, Speaker A: But I think in this video people really mostly enjoyed the iron lion Zion pistake that concluded the video.
00:03:25.316 - 00:04:04.280, Speaker E: And here it's and then I take a stop. I had to run like a fugitive to save the life I live. I'm gonna be iron like a liar in liars I'm gonna be I.
00:04:06.010 - 00:04:39.502, Speaker A: To the top. Quick take of the year was the story of three arrows, Jusu and the handbags on Twitter with Kane. But it began like this. Ooh, let's start with some culture. The opening seconds of post Malone's new track with the weeknd one right now features moody lighting and post sitting cross legged smoking in some swanky parlour. He's chill. He's the coolest cat in the what moon pay he's using moon pay to buy a board ape now forget for a moment the shameless product placement.
00:04:39.502 - 00:05:27.622, Speaker A: Forget that this video easily costs north of 100 grand, and yet they couldn't be bothered to stump up a few dollars for someone on fiver to do the compositing properly. No, this video features two of the biggest music stars in the western world. It has eleven and a half million views. We have a board ape being bought in a music video that is exposure, but is it also a top signal? You know what though? I think it was just the impressions that did it for everybody. Kane Warwick's Aussie draw becoming a middle management middle England middle fudge we've spoken to many of the teams working on the major scaling variants, and after reviewing each of them, I believe optimistic Ethereum is the scaling solution likely to reach consensus within the community. While Zusu inexplicably became Lancastrian. Yes, I have abandoned Ethereum despite supporting it in the past.
00:05:27.622 - 00:06:08.202, Speaker A: Yes, Ethereum has abandoned its users despite supporting them in the past. The idea of sitting around jerking off, watching the burn and concocting purity tests while zero newcomers can afford the chain is gross. Users are livid that they promised a vision of the future, then told that they have to pay one hundred dollars to one thousand dollars per transaction to enjoy it, and then get told some tales about how they should have been smart enough to buy ETH at $10. No, I don't get it either. I open my mouth, stuff comes out and then that's just what you get. Quick takes are a way to capture the sense of the day's topics. Once you watch them, you're done but we also do more evergreen content, like tutorials.
00:06:08.202 - 00:06:17.650, Speaker A: And if you tune back in tomorrow, we'll count on a list of the years most popular to see what's been the most helpful for yous all y'all out there, y'all will y'all peace.
