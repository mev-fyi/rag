00:00:00.200 - 00:00:37.488, Speaker A: Putting all this airdrop drama aside, to me the main issue continues to be all these $15 billion in eigen layer are supposed to be securing actively validated services. ABS's that we mentioned before, which are pieces of ethereum infrastructure using Eigen layer. And these avss are supposed to pass on yield to restakers. That's the reason why people are restaking their staked ETH in Eigen layer. I think it will take years for these avss to actually create enough economic value to deliver these yields.
00:00:37.536 - 00:00:51.184, Speaker B: These are all untested new protocols. Most haven't even launched yet. None I think have reached product market fit or are seeing any meaningful economic.
00:00:51.344 - 00:00:56.414, Speaker A: Value or transactions going through their network.
00:00:57.194 - 00:01:10.814, Speaker B: So the only way to pass on yield to eigen layer restakers will be to issue more tokens. These ABS's will have to airdrop more tokens in order to pass on yield.
00:01:11.634 - 00:01:12.850, Speaker A: So what does this mean?
00:01:12.922 - 00:02:21.524, Speaker B: It means that all this multi billion dollar defi sector is being propped up by tokens that are being printed out of thin air, betting on the promise that someday all this infrastructure will actually provide utility. That's fair enough. People are speculating that this is a huge game changing protocol, and I agree. I think it's a big piece of innovation allowing to leverage if security and use it to provide or to outsource security for other pieces of ethereum infrastructure. So I think the idea is great and really innovative, but it isn't actually happening right now. And there is $15 billion in eigen layer alone, $10 billion in liquid restaking protocols, all these tokens flying around. So just, you know, people should be aware of the risks and of the fact that this is all extremely speculative at this point.
