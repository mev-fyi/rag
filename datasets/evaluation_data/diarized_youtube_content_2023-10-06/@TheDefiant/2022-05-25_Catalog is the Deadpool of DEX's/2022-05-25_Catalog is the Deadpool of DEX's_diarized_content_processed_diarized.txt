00:00:00.410 - 00:00:33.334, Speaker A: Yes, it's that time again. It's time for me to take some of this hot and spicy loveliness and shove it right in my. No, I'm not putting in my eyeball. There it goes. Oh, I love doing this. Now, look, as we pick up the pieces of the terra mess, I think it's fair to ask questions about the validity of other chains and whether they can fight for their place in the white heat or even the tabasco heat of crypto. To do so, we're going to need multichain protocols that make it fast, easy, and safe to float between chains and do the business of doing business.
00:00:33.334 - 00:00:35.510, Speaker A: And that's why today's hot spiciness.
00:00:35.930 - 00:00:37.234, Speaker B: Oh, it is spicy.
00:00:37.362 - 00:01:31.098, Speaker A: Is catalog, the first app built on the Ren blockchain, one of the class of 2017 chains that spoke to a very specific class of cryptism. With its sophisticated dark pools, catalog aims to become the very first metaversal exchange, allowing you to swap between chains like a kex that do it with a Dex. Over $10 billion, in fact, has already been exchanged on catalog, and I predict we will see a whole bunch more of these metaversal apps now coming up. I'll be speaking to the founders and getting a demo of the exchange itself. Multi chain interoperability without bridges. Yeah, it's very spicy, and it's coming right up. Defi Saver is an all in one dashboard for creating, managing, and tracking your DeFi positions with automatic liquidation protection and leverage management options.
00:01:31.098 - 00:02:07.030, Speaker A: Famous in the space for its automation features, Defi Saver has been the darling of many investors and degens alike during big market crashes and swings, having saved thousands of positions from liquidation when borrowing and leveraging DeFi assets. Its recently upgraded automation service now provides different automated strategies to makerdao CDP owners. The latest addition to its power suite now offers non custodial stop loss, take profit, and stables liquidation protection strategies. Automate your DeFi asset management and save yourself from liquidation with Defi Saver.
00:02:07.610 - 00:02:40.414, Speaker C: So I'm here with Jazz and Susru, the brains behind catalog, and, guys, I think it's worth taking a moment to step back and look at how our entire universe has been turned upside down by what has happened in the last few days. And I wonder how that affects you as a company that's building a cross chain multichain exchange protocol in the light of what we've seen and what most likely will happen in terms of regulation. I really just want to get a hot take from you guys on how you see it all.
00:02:40.612 - 00:02:45.840, Speaker B: Yeah, I can start. Firstly, thanks for having us on. It's great to be on the show.
00:02:48.630 - 00:02:50.018, Speaker D: There's a lot that's happened over the.
00:02:50.024 - 00:03:38.740, Speaker B: Last couple of days. Where do we begin? I think the thing that's probably most interesting to me is the second and third order effects out of all of like, obviously it's very sad what's happened to Luna and USC and everything, but especially like, the retail traders that have been burnt from this, how long it's going to take them to recover and enter the market. Investment funds, firms that have been wiped out, a lot of these guys, it's going to be harder to get investments, start new projects, get funding, attract interest, and then company treasuries that would have been in ust all of these things. And that's only the second order effects, right? There are probably third order effects that come after those. And I think it's only going to know. We're only going to find out about them over the next three to six months. So, yeah, we'll see what happens.
00:03:41.270 - 00:04:06.538, Speaker C: I guess the narrative of ETH killers or alternative layer ones was big. I used to work at Harmony and I know what it's like to be one of these challenger layer ones, but your job isn't really to challenge, it's to connect. So let's refocus on what it is that you're building and how you're building it. So can you give us an overview of catalog and why you think it's cool?
00:04:06.704 - 00:04:44.102, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So these market movements, although they affect us in the sense that retail traders might be affected, institutions, all of these things, but in terms of volume, it's actually beneficial for the platform. When we're seeing these large spikes in any direction, we're seeing a lot of people buying or selling. The protocol works the same and we see more users when there's more volatility. So in that sense, it's actually kind of beneficial for us, as bad as that might sound. But what we're building right now is maybe we can start with a bit of a background on.
00:04:44.156 - 00:04:48.120, Speaker C: Yeah, let's dig into catalog. Yeah, absolutely.
00:04:49.770 - 00:05:22.894, Speaker B: Both myself and Ciceroth, we started working at Ren maybe in 2017, I think, back when it was called Republic protocol. And our focus at the time was dark pools, decentralized dark pools. And yeah, it was just a bunch of us uni students at the time with an ambitious idea to try and solve the problem of dark pools in a decentralized space. And we were able to do that. We deployed to Mainnet, a dark pool decks, in 2018. And then I think slowly realized.
00:05:23.022 - 00:05:34.886, Speaker C: Before you go on, I think a lot of our listeners will be somewhat confused as to what a dark pool actually is. So could you just explain what they are and why they're important? Absolutely, yeah.
00:05:34.908 - 00:06:23.910, Speaker B: So I think at the time, we had a couple of connections with some people that were in the trading space, and something that they thought that would be interesting in the decentralized space. Something that didn't exist at the time, was the concept of a dark pool, which meant that people could submit orders and do trades without the order book being visible to prevent things like front running and price slippage. When someone creates an order on a blockchain that's public with all the details, and then obviously, if it's a large order, it might take some time to fill and people might front run it, causing the price to change. So we were trying to build something, an exchange that people could submit any sort of order to, but no one could see the order book, so others could just create orders. And if there's a corresponding order, then eventually it'll get matched without any sort of fund running or bid.
00:06:25.050 - 00:06:29.538, Speaker C: Cool. So that brings us to catalog.
00:06:29.714 - 00:07:36.270, Speaker B: Yeah, actually for Ren first, because we realized that at the time we deployed it on Ethereum, and there actually wasn't a lot of liquidity on Ethereum. It was pretty early stages. So we realized that in order to make this dark pool exchange actually usable, we need to bridge some of the liquidity from bitcoin, for example, these assets that had more liquidity than Ethereum, even like zcash and things. So that's sort of how the idea of Ren came about. We were trying to think how we can get these assets, or at least like a tokenized representation of these assets on Ethereum, so they could be used in these exchanges and people could use them in dapps. And then we worked on that for two or three years, the last couple of years, got that to mainet and breached ten or $11 billion to date. And towards the end of last year, myself and Cisrus started Ren Labs, which is kind of like a development studio to help leverage the tech that we've built over the last few years and build applications on top of it and really bring some of this tech to the mainstream and retail.
00:07:36.270 - 00:07:50.818, Speaker B: Yeah, so catalog is the first application, first project out of REM labs. And if you want, I can go into a bit about what catalog is and how it works. Yeah, absolutely.
00:07:50.904 - 00:08:13.180, Speaker C: Well, I've noticed definitely that my multi chain existence has become easier with the advent of wallets and cross chain. I mean, they're not fully cross chain, but anything that avoids the need for a bridge in my mind is good. So why don't you tell us what catalog is and what it is that it's doing?
00:08:15.470 - 00:09:16.186, Speaker D: I can take that catalog. The general idea with catalog was that to actually solve two problems in the space where people are trying to buy and sell stuff, even for new users. So the two biggest problems we saw in the crosschain, or even Dex space, is the concept of fragmentation. Where there are a lot of completely fragmented defi markets, like Ethereum's defi market, polygon and all these things where the liquidity just can be traded internally between dexes or between people within a single blockchain. And that is completely new, right? Like completely a foreign concept for a completely new person coming into the system. They won't understand why they cannot actually buy bitcoin with something like ETH or something on uniswap, because for them, everything is like blockchain and they are just like blockchains, and they should be able to sell and buy and sell stuff between each other, but it is completely different on how it actually works. So that was one of the biggest problems that we want to solve with catalog.
00:09:16.186 - 00:10:36.386, Speaker D: And the second one is this concept of gas, right? Even though since we have been using gas from the beginning, it is normal for us, but for someone who's completely new on getting into the space, the concept of gas, that if I have to send 100 USD to someone else, I have to actually have ETH to actually process the transaction is completely new and completely foreign. So we wanted to figure out a way where we can just solve both these problems and build almost like a user centric decks where people can actually buy or sell any asset across the multichain to any other asset without thinking about gas or any of these concepts, it's not that gas does not exist in our system. It is completely abstracted away. So it is just like built into the fees that we actually charge them when they are using our decks. And we just create this experience where someone who just has, let's say, ten bitcoin, can just deposit ten bitcoin into our system, sell it to whatever they want, let's say, ethereum, and get ethereum on their ethereum on the same account. And on top of it, the other thing that we wanted to do was that we do not, we did not want to recreate all the liquidity that already exists in the existing blockchains, such as there is a lot of liquidity in uniswap for example, and a lot of liquidity in serum. We did not want to just recreate everything in catalog.
00:10:36.386 - 00:10:58.766, Speaker D: So we wanted to build a system such a way that we just leverage the liquidity that exists on uniswap or serum or any other place, and actually create an experience that just a user comes in, can trade against any decks on any blockchain through our platform, and just get whatever asset they're looking for. That's like the general idea, I think.
00:10:58.788 - 00:11:36.246, Speaker B: Just to add to that, I think over the past couple of months, or maybe even a year or so, we've started seeing a lot of different types of cross chain solutions, and they all have their different trade offs, whether it's like, the type of assets they can support. Some of these solutions aren't able to support bitcoin, for example. They're restricted to smart contract chains. Some of them treat confirmations differently. They have different safety thresholds and requirements assumptions. All of these things, I think, even like wallets. So having to interact with different smart contract cross chain wallets, one of the problems that we were facing was to do with liquidity.
00:11:36.246 - 00:12:20.730, Speaker B: As Sus Ruth mentioned, we recently started adding support for more and more kinds of tokens. I think we've got 30 now, but every single new token that we add support for in the REN system, we need to create liquidity pools for it on like ten plus chains. And then you have to incentivize those liquidity pools and make sure that people on, for example, if we deploy Ren die or something, a wrapped asset on avalanche, polygon, Solana, et cetera, we need to create these pools and bootstrap and provide incentives, all of these things. And then part of catalog, it's a bit messy. And then part of catalog is just like, how do we consolidate all of this liquidity in one place so that people can trade with it seamlessly without having to worry about all this fragmentation.
00:12:22.030 - 00:12:37.360, Speaker C: Wow, a lot to dig into there. Let's start the beginning. So you do away with gas, so there's a price, and the trader gets quoted a price. And do they choose then which asset they pay the gas in?
00:12:38.210 - 00:13:05.014, Speaker D: So usually it's just like built into the price itself. So a user just comes to our app, they say, I want to sell bitcoin, I want to sell one bitcoin, and it might just show that you will get 14 E. And if they say, yes, everything is taken into the account, and they would just get 14 ETH. So the gas would actually built into the price itself. So the user does not even have to think about the concept of gas. That's the thing that we want to achieve with our system.
00:13:05.132 - 00:13:17.020, Speaker B: It might actually be. Sorry to interrupt to show you a demo when you're ready. We deployed an internal main net release and we can run you through it at some point. In.
00:13:19.470 - 00:13:52.040, Speaker C: Mean, I don't know if you guys participated in the Ugalabs. Other side. Drop the man. That was just one of those kind of stark reminders of just how business this whole thing is. That's one thing, the liquidity pools you're talking about. I'm really curious how you assemble all of that and what is in that liquidity pool, because it sounds difficult. It sounds really hard.
00:13:52.970 - 00:14:31.182, Speaker D: Yeah. The idea is that we actually have some liquidity pools on catalog itself that are purely crosschain in nature. For example, liquidity pool from, let's say, bitcoin to Ethereum, or like zcash to ethereum or doge to ethereum. These kinds of assets do not actually natively exist on other blockchains, right? So we have to create liquidity pools for those. And for those we actually create simple XY is equal to k pools like uniswap. And we actually built in impermanent loss protection so that people who are actually depositing funds into our pools do not actually lose money for impermanent loss and stuff. And for all these other pools.
00:14:31.182 - 00:15:34.658, Speaker D: How we actually do this? More interesting, how do we use uniswap liquidity from catalog is this concept called, we are calling like boundless liquidity. So it is a RenvM specific concept. So it is like this cross chain messaging protocol that we are building under Ren. So what it does is that it actually allows our smart contract to actually call a different blockchain and execute a function on a different blockchain. And only if that function gets executed, the initial function would actually get executed. If the second function actually fails or reverts, the initial function would also just stop, would completely revert. Using this concept, we actually implemented adapters on Ethereum blockchain such that when a user says, I want to, let's say, sell bitcoin to ape coins, then the price is calculated from BTC to ETH, and then ETH to ape trade actually happens on uniswap.
00:15:34.658 - 00:16:34.700, Speaker D: And that trade actually happens first. And if that trade actually executes on the Uniswap Uniswap or like one inch, and it is successful, the second side of the trade, which is like BDC to it, actually happens on catalog, and the user ends up with ape tokens. If any of these steps fail, the whole thing fails and the user just ends up with bitcoin. So the biggest advantage the user is getting through a system like this where they don't have to use bridges, they don't have to use multiple wallets to do this, and different accounts, different cash tokens and any of that. And they are also getting this concept, this atomicity. So, for example, if you want to go from bitcoin to ape, right, you do not want to end up with any other asset than bitcoin or ape, for example, you do not want to end up with ETH or something, right? So you want to either own bitcoin that you already have or end up with ape. So that is what we are trying to achieve with this bonded equity concept where the whole transaction gets executed when the user is trying to do something like that.
00:16:36.270 - 00:16:41.420, Speaker C: So this sounds a little bit like layer 00:00 a.m.. I kind of, right?
00:16:41.810 - 00:17:02.020, Speaker D: In that sense, I think it is somewhat similar. The biggest advantage we have against layer zero is the ability to support non smart contract blockchains like bitcoin, doge and stuff. But in a way, just like how these transactions and crosschain communication works, it is similar because we are in the same space.
00:17:02.390 - 00:17:21.418, Speaker C: Yeah, listen, bridges suck. They just suck. I've always made this comparison. Like, you would never take all the gold that you own, put it on your back and walk to another country, but that's effectively what you do with the bridge. It makes no sense to me.
00:17:21.504 - 00:17:22.140, Speaker B: But.
00:17:24.510 - 00:18:05.480, Speaker C: I think we're kind of at this weird place right now where what bitcoin is and what bitcoin is supposed to be, nobody really knows anymore. It's not a payment mechanism, it's not a unit of account, it's not really a hedge against inflation, but it's still massively valid, still massively important. But it's like this weird thing. So I seem to remember Ren was always really bitcoin friendly and always plugged into the bitcoin maxis as well. It felt like it was very complementary to that. So that's why this is interesting to see, because obviously there's more liquidity there than anywhere else. And being able to link all of that up makes a ton of sense.
00:18:05.480 - 00:18:24.490, Speaker C: This stuff fries my brain because I know how complicated it is. And I know that what you're trying to do, you can see it from the graphics, you can see it from everything else. You're trying to make it feel really friendly and really nice to use. So what have you done in terms of the UX to create that experience for users.
00:18:27.230 - 00:19:27.490, Speaker D: It's almost like a from scratch approach. With Ren and all these things, we were more focused on how can we build this very cool tech, and how can we just get the most number of features, get the most number of different things, and bells and wheels and everything. But with catalog, the only thing that we wanted to almost achieve was this user experience that we had in our minds. Like this user coming to our system, being able to just deposit bitcoin to any other address and just be able to trade and just execute trades on our system without having to think about any of these other complex crypto concepts that we invented and just made people just swallow and stuff. So the experience that we wanted to create was very clear from day one. So we wanted to almost create our whole branding and landing page and our website based on this initial experience that we had in mind. And yeah, we just used it and we just worked with some graphic designers.
00:19:28.310 - 00:20:22.370, Speaker B: I think thinking through the ideal user experience for this kind of cross chain exchange, like going through all of the ideal, what would gas look like in this ideal exchange? Or what would wallets look like or confirmation, how would they work? I think a lot of things, like as we were designing this, we realized a lot of it was essentially just like how a centralized exchange works. So ultimately catalog, when we started building it, we were thinking, how can we replicate a centralized exchange user experience, but in a completely decentralized environment? So when you see the demo and use the application, you see a lot of it is just like centralized exchange. Very similar to how a centralized exchange works. There's a reason they built it. Centralized exchanges, how they built them. Right. They don't have these restrictions around deposit times and having to deal with transactions across different blockchains and things like that.
00:20:22.370 - 00:21:02.158, Speaker B: So when you see catalog, it's very similar in the sense that you have one account, you deposit whatever kind of asset you want into it, and then once your assets are in that account, whether it's bitcoin, ethereum, whatever, you can trade those assets. And it's basically instant finality. Like when you're going from bitcoin to ETH, as soon as that transaction is submitted, and if there's a transaction, since it's an amm, essentially it'll be submitted immediately and it'll be confirmed final immediately. Balances will update automatically, and then once you're done with catalog, you want to take your funds elsewhere, you can withdraw them. Wait, the confirmation. Very similar to how that traditional exchanges work.
00:21:02.244 - 00:21:27.400, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to say, everything you've been telling me so far sounds very much like a centralized exchange, from the fees to the banner liquidity. This sense that this is just a platform, you ask people that they take one step to trust your smart contracts when they deposit with you. So I guess the question is, who does your auditing? How have you been audited? How secure is all of this? Because I think right now, people are like.
00:21:29.710 - 00:21:51.198, Speaker D: I agree. Yeah, I can take that. Sure. In general, at trend, we take security very seriously. So as a fintech company, I think it is very important for all of us to actually make sure that we put customer funds before everything else. All these new features that we can add or all these other things that we could do. Security comes first.
00:21:51.198 - 00:22:39.338, Speaker D: And if we lose even just like $10 worth of assets of a user, it is just almost like a death sentence in a normal situation. But crypto seems to be immune to that. But we just take it very seriously. We have this almost clear, a lot of security processes in place where we continuously get external and internal audits done on our code basis, like both Ren and now catalog. So with catalog right now, we have some audits done by external audit firms like Shield. And we have a lot of other internal audits planned with a lot of people that we actually know in this space who are very good security engineers. And they would be auditing our code and just giving us reports which would be more internal.
00:22:39.338 - 00:23:03.442, Speaker D: And we have more audits planned within the next six to nine months, because a lot of these top auditing firms have very long wait times. And we actually just booked those audit slots from them, but they would just come in, like, six months from now. But right now, we have done a lot of internal audits with teams that we know, and some audits with auditing firms like Quickshield.
00:23:03.586 - 00:23:41.730, Speaker B: And I think with the underlying tech, we've shown that with Ren, it's always just been security first, safety first. And it's meant that we've been slow with regards to maybe supporting new assets or decentralizing the network completely. But it's all intentional. It's all just so that we can bridge ten, $11 billion assets up until now with no hacks. Right. You see other cross chain projects trying to rush certain things, which that's their approach, but they're also more. You've seen that there have been a number of hacks over the months, large amounts, and that's just not our approach.
00:23:42.710 - 00:24:28.180, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's really important to be able to trust all that, because it's very clear that scaled up user mass adoption can't be supported on Ethereum, but everyone kind of wants to be where the liquidity is and where the volume is, and that's on Ethereum. And how do you make it more straightforward for people to kind of go and play on another chain or be present on another chain and remove that friction? One of the interesting things I see here is that you are looking to create on and off ramp experiences, which would be another way of removing friction. Can you talk about kind of some of the features that are coming up for catalog and maybe where rent labs as well might be building more functionality to plug into?
00:24:30.470 - 00:25:43.510, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think almost at launch would actually have this on and off ramp experience from fiat. We are using banks as our fiat partner, so they would actually be doing the on and off ramps and they have their own KYC systems in place to actually make it happen. That was another, as you said, very important feature that we wanted to have in our system because it just decreases, like, you know, just like things that people have to like do to actually enter our system. And like, for example, if someone wants to just like put in $100 from a credit card and just start using our system, we wanted to make it possible so that people can just play around with our system. And yeah, there are a lot of things that we have planned for catalog in the next year or so. I would say some would be like NFDs that we want to actually support NFDs where we want people to be able to buy whatever NFT on whichever blockchain, using whichever asset that is available on the whole multi chain space. And so even before we can actually build the nfts part, we wanted to solve the liquidity part, where people can turn any asset into any asset.
00:25:43.510 - 00:26:12.242, Speaker D: So that would be like our initial focus. But we want to add this crosschain, NFT platform experience into catalog, where people can actually buy us with bitcoin directly and stuff like that. So that is one thing that we are working on and we are excited about. And there is, second thing would be like Mev. We want to make sure that people cannot extract MeV out of our system.
00:26:12.376 - 00:26:17.320, Speaker B: Blatantly, Mev being minor extractable value for those that don't know.
00:26:19.610 - 00:27:06.018, Speaker D: We want to protect the users from the MeV side of things. That's like something we are working on, which is like an ongoing project. And the third thing is this concept of meta governance. So we'll have all these assets locked in our system, such as almost like bitcoin, Ethan we might also have assets like Rook, which is like a governance token that governs the Keeper Dao protocol. So what people can actually do is people can actually participate in Keeper Dao's governance through all the rook that is actually staked on the catalog system through the cat tokens. So by holding the cat tokens, they can actually vote on behalf of the rook that we actually hold in our system.
00:27:06.104 - 00:27:36.960, Speaker B: Kind of similar to what we've seen with projects like Convex, but the advantage we have is that because we have assets from all of the different chains, you can participate in governance across projects on Ethereum, avalanchalan, et cetera, just by holding this one token, which is pretty cool. And like the cat token itself, is this kind of unique, sort of Ren native asset in a way, where it's one asset, but it's accessible on any chain at the same time. So it's kind. Yeah, unique concept that we're interested.
00:27:37.490 - 00:28:15.466, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like a swiss army knife for governance. I love all these secondary benefits of being what I call a meta community. Binance is a meta community. It connects all these different communities together and reaps huge rewards because it takes the power from all of them. And this is like the decentralized version of it. And I think you guys are clearly smart enough to understand the power that you wield, actually, ultimately. And with that power, then comes a bunch of people who would like to leverage that power.
00:28:15.466 - 00:28:52.040, Speaker C: And I wonder if you ever game that side of things out, what kind of sizes of capital might come in and start kind of hoovering up cat tokens to have this one size fits all governance Thanos gauntlet. It's kind of that in a sense, but it sounds ridiculous to say it, but this is exactly what we've seen happen with convex. And if you're saying we can have that, but across every chain, I mean, that really is infinity coordinate kind of power in your. You know, I wonder if you guys ever think that far ahead and try and think about the implications of what you built here.
00:28:53.130 - 00:29:36.034, Speaker B: Yeah, I think some of it is like you are kind of figuring it out as you go along, as you deploy new features, people might do certain things with it that you might have not have expected initially. They might gain traction, certain features might gain traction over others, but at the same time, syswith as well. I think we both find the game theory aspect super interesting, just of blockchains in general. So always like to think about how any sort of feature we introduce, how it could be gamed in any way. That's how we built Ren in the first place, how you come up with these sorts of requirements for nodes and safety, threshold requirements, liveliness, all of these sorts of things. It's all game theory. And I think every new feature you introduce can be gamed in a way.
00:29:36.034 - 00:29:38.100, Speaker B: So it's definitely fun to think about.
00:29:38.890 - 00:30:30.146, Speaker D: The thing would be that even with meta governance and stuff, right, we would not actually launch it for all chains, everything at once. We want to almost definitely do this progressive overloading where we just say that let's actually just try with one asset and see how people actually try to game it, and how people actually want to use our cat tokens to actually get votes there and just do whatever they want to do there. And if there are things that they are doing that we think are malicious, then we just have to figure out how to put brakes on things like that. And since it's a decentralized, almost like system, we would actually want people to community to come in and just say that this is how we should be doing things. This is how it is fair for everyone who is actually participating in the system. And yeah, I think it would be very cool to actually slowly figure it out with the community and our users.
00:30:30.338 - 00:30:30.886, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:30.988 - 00:30:58.400, Speaker C: So I'm looking at some of the other features here. Given that you've got participants that submit assets to your exchange, they can send assets between themselves for no cost, you're just using the pool and just basically moving numbers around. That's pretty interesting. The other thing that I saw here in the presses is you're calling yourselves the first metaversal exchange. Explain, is that just spin or what's your vision for the metaverse here?
00:30:59.330 - 00:32:01.566, Speaker D: So we have this vision, right, just more for Ren and also for catalog is this interface to actually make it happen. So when we actually started Ren, the idea was to actually connect these different blockchains that exist. So that was almost like what we were doing for the last two years and two years and more. So extension to it. What we have been thinking about is how we can actually use similar tech that we actually built at Ren to actually connect these metaverse worlds, right? So everyone who wants to build a metawatt is completely trying to build their own metawars, and they not want to almost have this to do anything with the other people. So what we were trying to do with Ren is that we wanted to create this infrastructure that would allow us to communicate between two meta verses without any of them following any specific standard. We would actually adhere to their standard and we will just create a communication protocol between two different metaverses and so on and so forth.
00:32:01.566 - 00:32:44.846, Speaker D: So we wanted to almost create this cross chain network of all these meta verses with Ren, and we wanted to make catalog the place where you actually exchange stuff between metaverses almost. So where a user can come in and say that I want to, let's say, sell this game item for bitcoin or this game item for some s word on a different game or something. And we wanted all these trades to actually happen through catalog. So that's where this whole concept of this metaversal exchange came to be. Like this central marketplace where people from different metawars can just come in and just trade their assets between. Yeah, that's where it came from.
00:32:44.948 - 00:33:38.274, Speaker C: Well, no, I think it's completely correct, because the idea is that a metaverse is a game, and a game is this place, and you go there. But I think people fundamentally misunderstand the impact of metaverse piping and technology. That it's really about composability, isn't it's composability of identity, composability of finance, composability of assets, and also composability of reputation. I think that's what's going to be really interesting for people, that your wallet and its history and where you've been, what you've interacted with over time is going to become an incredibly valuable piece of your metaverse identity. And being able to travel with that wherever you go, one over chain, that's the big game. 100% interesting enough. We're trying to come up with something here, and we know that the technology we need exists already.
00:33:38.274 - 00:33:50.786, Speaker C: But it's on Kusama. It's on Kusama. Why can't it be on ETH? So we need to solve, guess Kusama.
00:33:50.818 - 00:33:52.278, Speaker B: With everything else, right?
00:33:52.444 - 00:34:34.980, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. How do we connect Kusama with an audience that we know is primarily on ETH in a way that they won't even know, that they won't even care. It's just, and this is why I want you guys to have this built and have the NFT sitting there, and I can just go, right, we're just going to plug in catalog. Question for you. How do you see this plugging into, I mean, for instance, something like the other side for Yuga, how would you see this plugging into their metaverse ecosystem? Everything else. Because I'm imagining that you could just put catalog under the hood, reskin it, and do something else with it, and then all the trades are executed with you guys. Is that kind of what we could do with it.
00:34:34.980 - 00:34:42.200, Speaker C: I've stumped you. Yeah, I think that.
00:34:45.450 - 00:35:24.820, Speaker B: I think ideally it all happens through catalog's own interface, but people are able to plug in to catalog through their own exchanges and interfaces so that they can access the liquidity that we're creating just so that they don't have to recreate that elsewhere. It would kind of suck if we had that same Kusama sort of problem where everyone was then forced to come into this isolated catalog network to then do some sort of trade and then exit out of it. It would be nicer if everyone could just kind of stay in this catalog network but also have access to every kind of network at the same time. So I think, yeah, that is the end goal, but still a lot of hurdles we need to overcome to get there.
00:35:26.730 - 00:35:41.580, Speaker C: But the fact that you're doing it this way and as what I can see, as consumer friendly as it is, is really cool. Why don't you guys show me it? We've been talking about it like it's time to see it. Give me a demo.
00:35:43.150 - 00:35:45.660, Speaker B: Cool. Do you see this?
00:35:46.030 - 00:35:47.820, Speaker C: I know I definitely see it. Yeah.
00:35:48.190 - 00:36:13.950, Speaker B: Cool. So I will start from scratch. I'll disconnect. So currently I am on the catalog exchange that's deployed to Mainnet. We have a waitlist at the moment, so if you visit catalog Phi, you can join the waitlist. You'll be given a spot in the queue. I think there's 70, 80,000 people in there, but if you refer your friends, you can climb up that order and we'll be rolling it out to people in the waitlist shortly.
00:36:13.950 - 00:36:49.294, Speaker B: I'm lucky enough to have access already, so all I have to do is connect my web three wallet. It doesn't matter what kind of wallet you have, whether it's metamask, trust, whatever. You just have to connect some sort of web three wallet to your cat account. The first time you do this, it'll ask you to create a cat name, which is essentially an Ens name for your catalog account. So it's an account. The difference between an Ens name and a catalog account is that your cat account can store any kind of asset. So it can store bitcoin, your NFTs, erc, twenty, s, the whole lot.
00:36:49.294 - 00:37:19.414, Speaker B: So I've already done this. I've created this account called testing cat, and I already have some funds in here. I've got some ETH. If I want to deposit some more, I simply specify an amount wherever that is, hit deposit, and it'll just ask me to hit submit on metamask. I can do the same thing with bitcoin, which is a bit more interesting because you can't do this with a lot of traditional dexes. But say I want to do 0.1 bitcoin.
00:37:19.414 - 00:37:59.430, Speaker B: I want to get that into my catalog account. I hit deposit, and what I'm given here is a QR code. And the way this works is if I want to send funds to this account from an existing catalog account, I can just send my friend, my username, my cat name, and they can send me bitcoin. Otherwise, I'm given this bitcoin address. That is the address tied to my catalog account for the bitcoin blockchain. So if I want to deposit funds into my cat account, similar to a centralized exchange, you give an address and you deposit funds to it. So that's pretty familiar.
00:37:59.430 - 00:38:19.820, Speaker B: And then here we have the bitcoin from fiat on ramp. So you can buy bitcoin directly with USD using banksa. And all you do here is I specify 0.1 bitcoin. So it's calculated the amount here, and I can create the order. Do I want to click that? Yes.
00:38:21.150 - 00:38:31.760, Speaker D: Then it asks you for details, and once you finish it, it will ask you for your debit card details. And once you make the payment, you get your funds deposited into your catalog account.
00:38:33.570 - 00:38:55.670, Speaker B: So I'll just go back now. And what I'll do instead is instead of depositing bitcoin into my account, I'll show how easy it is to go from the ETH that I already have in this account to bitcoin. So I'm just on the swap page now. Select ETH, and I want to go to bitcoin. Obviously, this is just a few assets that we're testing with initially.
00:38:56.410 - 00:39:07.020, Speaker C: Can I just say how nice it is to see an interface that isn't a direct copy of uniswap? Yeah, I mean, my God, how many times have you seen that? But, you know.
00:39:10.050 - 00:39:29.246, Speaker B: So what I'll do here is 0.1 E. You don't have enough. That's why I got people watching 0.2 E. So I should have zero point 52 after this trade.
00:39:29.278 - 00:39:34.530, Speaker C: Apple, big spender. So I'm looking at the fees there, and they just built into the cost.
00:39:34.600 - 00:39:54.300, Speaker B: Basically, exactly $0.20 or so. And I actually received more bitcoin. I'm doing an RBA, which is nice. And any gas gets abstracted away into the price that you're seeing. So I actually don't need to submit any ETH transactions. Any bitcoin transactions, anything like that, which is kind of cool.
00:39:54.300 - 00:39:56.822, Speaker B: So I will just hit submit swap.
00:39:56.886 - 00:39:59.306, Speaker C: Now, and all I have to do.
00:39:59.328 - 00:40:29.826, Speaker B: Is sign a message just to authorize the transaction came from my catalog account that's tied to my or controlled by my web three wallet in my metamask and successfully swapped. So that took about 30 seconds a minute. Yeah. And you see zero point 52 E. And we've received a bitcoin. And now I can withdraw that. I can send that to Cicero.
00:40:29.826 - 00:40:33.000, Speaker B: I'm going to dox him right now. His name is Tester one cat.
00:40:35.050 - 00:40:35.558, Speaker D: Or.
00:40:35.644 - 00:40:43.450, Speaker B: I can not send it to Cicero because I want to keep my bitcoin. But, yeah, that's about it, I think. Have I missed anything, sister?
00:40:44.110 - 00:40:47.980, Speaker D: I think that's about it. You can actually send it and show how easy it is.
00:40:50.030 - 00:41:15.250, Speaker C: The stupid thing is, it all looks so utterly simple and so. I know, so obvious, and if you knew what was going on underneath, it would just blow your mind. And I think that's the thing that is so kind of surprising for people from outside the space. I had a question for you about. So you said there's an Amm under the hood. Where are the price oracles coming from? How is that engineered?
00:41:17.290 - 00:41:49.386, Speaker D: We actually use XYZ equal to KmM, which is same as what uniswap uses. So the price is actually based on the people actually trading it. So when you actually trade against this pool, the new price is set. For example, if that price actually is different from the market price, someone else will add you back to the market price. So the market price is almost like established within the exchange. So we do not have to use oracles. Usually using oracles is always dangerous because there are a lot of attacks that are possible when using oracle.
00:41:49.386 - 00:42:06.114, Speaker D: So we do not want to go in that direction. We wanted to go with a simpler XYZ equal to K model. And yeah, we have other cool things that we are doing on top of it that actually helps us decrease the impermanent loss that is created in our system. But, yeah, we just use XYZ equal to k pools.
00:42:06.162 - 00:42:36.880, Speaker B: Yeah, the main idea is just to abstract the concepts of Il staking, whatever else, liquidity pools, all these things from the user so that they don't really have to think about it. They deposit money into their catalog account and they start earning yield on it immediately based on the fees that they're getting in the amm. And then under the hood, there's a liquidity manager role. All of these things part of the catalog network that are handling the rebalancing of these pools, everything for you, and then you're just getting a cut of the fees, which is nice.
00:42:38.770 - 00:42:46.130, Speaker C: Yeah. Just before you go on, when you deposit into catalog, you immediately start earning fees on those deposits.
00:42:46.550 - 00:42:47.106, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:42:47.208 - 00:43:01.586, Speaker C: So you just gone into a big liquidity pool and now you're a liquidity provider in that moment. Interesting. There's kind of tangible benefits for just using the platform even if you're not trading.
00:43:01.778 - 00:43:02.520, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:43:06.730 - 00:43:43.214, Speaker D: The idea was that we wanted to almost make catalog a system where people want to keep their funds in. So they just come in and just put their funds here, just transfer to whoever they want to transfer to within our system, and withdraw only when they have something else they want to do with it. So we wanted to almost create this nice experience where they actually deposit money and they earn this savings interest, like they would actually earn in a normal bank account. So that people just deposit one bitcoin, they might get a small fees from all these trades that are happening, and it could be small, but it's just like consistent interest they would be earning on their assets.
00:43:43.262 - 00:44:13.574, Speaker B: Similar to something like binance. You're not depositing, doing a trade, and then withdrawing a lot of the time you deposit and then your funds just stay there for however long you're trading for. And like, catalog can almost be used as a cross chain wallet in a way. So that instead of having a bitcoin wallet, like an application on your desktop, a zcash wallet in your Google Chrome browser, and then a bunch in Firefox, whatever, you just have this catalog wallet that you can deposit any kind of fund into, and then they're all just there. Right. You can withdraw them when you need them. It's just a simple wallet that holds everything.
00:44:13.574 - 00:44:16.720, Speaker B: And you also have some nice trading functionality in there as well.
00:44:17.570 - 00:44:32.754, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I was thinking about how catalog will be composable with other stuff. I kind of feel like people are going to set up little kind of shops on catalog instead. So there'll be little extended apps or things that take advantage of what's in there.
00:44:32.872 - 00:44:33.538, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:44:33.704 - 00:44:38.600, Speaker C: So last question for you. How do I earn the cat token if I'm on the platform?
00:44:39.690 - 00:45:05.230, Speaker D: So initially, almost like when we actually launch, and for the first three months, the interest is actually paid in both cat tokens and the actual BTC as well. So that's how we are doing this, yield farming, where people who actually use our system deposit funds and start trading would actually earn cat tokens consistently. So, yeah, that's how you would actually earn cat tokens. Starting on launch.
00:45:06.450 - 00:45:25.666, Speaker C: Very cool. Well, this has been great. I'm really excited to see products like this take off, and I'm stoked to see it built on Ren as well. But just one of those projects that I kept an eye on for the longest time. And, I mean, dark pools and dark nodes. Come on. It's shadowy, supercoded stuff.
00:45:25.666 - 00:45:37.894, Speaker C: It's great. It's got a kind of sexy appeal to it. So congratulations, guys. I'm stoked to see it out in the world and looking forward to see where you go next. And thanks so much for showing it to us.
00:45:38.092 - 00:45:41.058, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks so much for having us on again. It's been a pleasure.
00:45:41.154 - 00:45:43.554, Speaker C: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.
00:45:43.602 - 00:45:44.018, Speaker D: Cheers.
00:45:44.114 - 00:45:46.230, Speaker B: Cheers. See ya.
