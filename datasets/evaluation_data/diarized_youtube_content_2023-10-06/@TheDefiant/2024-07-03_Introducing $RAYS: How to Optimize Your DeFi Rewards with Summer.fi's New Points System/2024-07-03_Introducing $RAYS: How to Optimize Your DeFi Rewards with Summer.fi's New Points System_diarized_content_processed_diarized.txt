00:00:04.720 - 00:00:11.998, Speaker A: All right, here we are with Chris Bradbury, the CEO of Summerfi. Chris, it's great to have you on the Defiant again. Welcome.
00:00:12.134 - 00:00:15.290, Speaker B: Hey, thank you so much. Yeah, good to be back so soon.
00:00:16.350 - 00:00:34.954, Speaker A: Yeah. So lots going on at Summerfi, but for those who didn't listen to our previous episode, I'd just love to just start with a brief overview of Summerfi and then we can get to the latest.
00:00:35.082 - 00:01:09.070, Speaker B: Yeah, perfect. Yeah. So, yeah, some fi. We're building the best place to borrow and earn in Defi. Basically we curate some of the best protocols available on Mainnet, Ethereum, Mainnet, optimism, arbitrum and base, including kind of like maker, spark, aave, argo. Yeah. Try and add like a ten x user experience on top of all those protocols with kind of like one click transactions to help you get the job done a lot quicker, better user interface to give you more information that's useful to you and then, yeah, like state of the art automation tools as well.
00:01:09.070 - 00:01:18.566, Speaker B: So kind of take a little bit of stress and a little bit worry out of managing positions, particularly in kind of like such volatile markets and someone that we're seeing quite a lot of recently.
00:01:18.678 - 00:01:20.550, Speaker A: What's your connection to maker?
00:01:20.630 - 00:01:48.910, Speaker B: I was actually part of Makerdao. I joined them in 2018 as a product manager. So, like, kind of always been a product manager. I was in fintech kind of before crypto. And yeah, it was brought in as a product manager primarily to do the PM work on their front ends and so on. And that's how Summerfy was born ultimately. It was originally, originally branded Oasis app, originally part of the Maker foundation as the default front end when we launched multicollateral Dai back in November 2019.
00:01:48.910 - 00:02:07.518, Speaker B: And yeah, in 2021, when the foundation dissolved, we, the protocols handed fully over to governance as it continues to be today. But things like Oasis app spun out into its own company and we went from just being a maker front end to that curated Defi experience.
00:02:07.694 - 00:02:29.260, Speaker A: I very recently spoke with Roon. I moderated a fireside tech with them. So I don't know. I have the whole end game very much kind of front and center. So is Summerfi part of the Makerdao endgame? Like, are you a maker subdao? Will you have a. A subdao token in the future?
00:02:29.760 - 00:03:31.680, Speaker B: No, we're not part of the endgame stuff, so we're completely separate now. So ever since 21, we kind of went separate ways in a way. So, yeah, the endgame stuff is primarily all around the Dao aspect of Maker, although we continue to support maker as a protocol it's still probably, I think, pretty much the most popular protocol still that we have on there, just because of our such close knit connection to maker. And we support Spark as well, the full product suite on Spark, which is obviously the main subdow of maker at the moment. But as maker rolls out its new tokens and so on and different structures and so on, then, yeah, we're 100% going to support everything for it, but we are completely separated legally, community wise, token wise and everything like that. So no connection directly to maker, but we'll just continue to be supporters. A number of the people at Summerfi are still like x maker people as well.
00:03:31.680 - 00:03:39.024, Speaker B: So we obviously look and watch at Maker watchmaker very closely, but, yeah, no official connections.
00:03:39.152 - 00:03:54.850, Speaker A: Summarify is a kind of a Defi front end, right? Like it's. It's an easy to use interface into deFi, but it continues to be non custodial, is that right?
00:03:54.930 - 00:03:55.962, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally.
00:03:55.986 - 00:03:56.362, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:56.466 - 00:04:24.520, Speaker B: It's entirely non custodial. Even the automation tools. So they will work exactly how you set them up, like strict conditions and so on for that. But yeah, all the features, all the functionality, every single part of it is non custodial. There's not a single bit that, that touches any sort of custodial services and so on. So you have to have a non custodial wallet to come in and start using Summerfi. You have to have eth in your wallet, for example, to do anything.
00:04:24.520 - 00:04:32.836, Speaker B: But, yeah, it sticks to its roots of defi across the entire app.
00:04:32.908 - 00:05:31.726, Speaker A: So I'm always curious about this building space within Defi because I think it's just a very kind of a particular user. Because from my experience, people in DeFi are like full DJ's who want to be very active, just like trading directly. They're spinning up telegram sniper bots and are getting in and out of positions. I don't know. They're a bit more sophisticated than most crypto holders or participants. And then there's the kind of c five or like centralized exchange crypto holder who's pretty passive. They'll buy and hold some of major tokens they hear about, but they won't participate in DeFi directly.
00:05:31.726 - 00:06:26.340, Speaker A: But it feels like with Summerfi and other similar offerings, there's this bet of, okay, there's a user there who does want to participate in Defi and web3, but it's not like 100% degen. And it doesn't want to be like maybe less technically savvy or just doesn't want to spend so much time dealing directly with smart contracts or anything like that. Just wants an easy way into. Into Defi and web3, do you think. I mean, how do you see your user? Do you think this segment is increasing? Are they coming from centralized exchanges or is it like DJ's who just want to take a break? What's your insight into your user?
00:06:26.460 - 00:07:00.980, Speaker B: Yeah, so we describe our users as semi sophisticated crypto enthusiasts in a way. And I guess we could call that Defi enthusiasts in reality, because I think if we look at crypto enthusiasts on just centralized exchanges, they're probably not. Probably not there. But yeah, I mean, Summerfi is still like a semi sophisticated offering. You do kind of need to know what you're doing, even the fact that it's non custodial. You need to have your own wallet and whether it's private keys or kind of some of the newer wallets and so on. But yeah, it is still trading tokens in a non custodial way.
00:07:00.980 - 00:07:33.150, Speaker B: It is still trading. We have stop loss orders, automated take profit orders, trading stop losses, and these are still quite advanced terms from the majority of people. But yeah, the market is growing in that area. I don't think we attract dgens. We don't really have any Degen products. We don't really support Degen protocols. We're not in the business of supporting protocols where you could earn 1000% APY for a couple of weeks, but you've maybe got a 10% chance of being rugged, for example, in that time.
00:07:33.150 - 00:08:18.744, Speaker B: So we only curate the best protocols out there, the safe, sustainable protocols really, that can earn you a decent return. But it's very unlikely that you're going to lose money through them. But it's not a huge market. It is still a fairly pro in space. And I think even if you look at DeFi and non custodial, DeFi in particular, it's the pro version of Coinbase, like Coinbase Pro and so on, when they had that completely segregated app and so on. I think the median balance of our users is over $70,000, for example. I think the average is something crazy, like $900,000.
00:08:18.744 - 00:09:10.938, Speaker B: So we don't target. We're trying to attract users with $500 or $200 or something like that, like just the gas fees alone just eat into the return and so on. If you're on mainnet and even on l two s and so on, they will eventually kind of like eat their way into it. Even if it's a couple of cents to do a transaction if you're only starting off with like $50 it soon eats in. So, yeah, I think most of Defi is targeting like kind of not retail users, but we like when we speak to our users, a lot of them have worked in Defi, have worked in crypto, are like quite technically savvy people, and that's actually who we target this app for. We are working on a new project at the moment, which is much more retail focused, much more passive and much more set and forget and so on to open up to that much, much wider market.
00:09:11.034 - 00:09:12.986, Speaker A: Yeah, tell me more about this new product.
00:09:13.178 - 00:09:58.486, Speaker B: Yeah, well, so it's still in the fairly early days and we're probably at least six months out from it at the moment. We kind of launched it or announced it fully yesterday. But yeah, it's what we're terming the summer fire protocol and so on. And it's going to be a completely permissionless way to lend your assets and just be continuously rebalanced across Defi, ultimately. So as a user, you'll just be able to deposit your token in the same kind of like curated list of protocols. So safe, sustainable protocols that can earn you a long term sustainable yield, but it will rebalance them for you. So as a user, you don't have to keep changing or changing pools or changing protocols when the rates are changing or if the DSR is increased one week and then decreased a few weeks later.
00:09:58.486 - 00:10:13.670, Speaker B: And so when you have to move it out, it will, yeah, everything will be done for you. And the plan really there is to start integrating that into the wider kind of like web two world, Tradfi World and so on, and distribute that through like SDKs and so on.
00:10:13.750 - 00:10:18.646, Speaker A: Super interesting. And that will be completely like a separate app from current Summerfi.
00:10:18.758 - 00:10:56.870, Speaker B: No, it would be combined. But you, what you'll likely see is that become the main face of summify more than likely. And actually the current interface as it is become more of a pro interface. Again, think of like Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, where the majority of your users are using that simple passive application, but still your larger users in much smaller numbers, advanced users, sophisticated users, still have the advanced tools to be able to use and so on. And as DeFi grows and more liquidity comes in, those pro tools only become more efficient and better to use as well as more liquidity is within defi.
00:10:56.990 - 00:11:12.734, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. How, if you could estimate the market size of those two users right now, how big do you think the market is for this more sophisticated defi user who's not fully degen? And how big is the market for this more passive user?
00:11:12.822 - 00:12:01.670, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, at sophisticated level, the markets I don't think huge, maybe in the tens to hundreds of thousands maximum, maybe at the moment. I mean, just on chain at the moment there's only about 2 million addresses on chain that have like at least 0.2 ETH and have done at least a couple of transactions in their time. So if you look at kind of like active wallets in some ways, and not all of these are even still active, right, but ones of at least 0.2 ETH and thingy, the count is just over 2 million across Mainnet and the major chains. So if you think of all the users with a non custodial wallet that are potentially active and it tops out around 2 million, it actually then creates the market for them doing this fairly advanced trading on specific protocols. Quite small.
00:12:01.670 - 00:13:13.846, Speaker B: On the other hand, when you look at the passive products, we can look well beyond Defi and crypto in reality for that. And when we talk about, when we people talk about onboarding the next hundred million users or billion users or whatever, I firmly believe that you're never going to onboard those users by expecting them to fragment their existing fiat wallets into multiple different digital wallets and so on, and then fragment them further using different apps. So we're not going to onboard the next 100 million users into an array of different protocol front ends or even some of our front end as it is today. I think we're kidding ourselves if we think all these people around the world are going to onboard into protocol Uisdev. So we have to take DeFi to them if we want to onboard the next 100 million people on chain and we have to take the products that we have to the apps they're currently using today, like where their money already is stored. So if that's their savings apps, their digital wealth management apps, their current trading apps and so on. As an industry, we have to take the products that we're building, build them for the future, and get them kind of integrated in a kind of professional and scalable way into the apps that they have.
00:13:13.846 - 00:14:14.700, Speaker B: And that's what we plan to do with summify and the new passive protocol. Because, yeah, the market for that is anyone that's saving regardless of the size. So anybody that's saving $100 or $50 up to the personal company that's got tens of millions of dollars to save and so on, and would like to earn at least in a proportion of their portfolio, maybe somewhere between like eight to 12% and so on in a kind of fairly safe way, but also using crypto as crypto was designed to be used. So I think if everybody is just using crypto by using bitcoin or ETF's, we've kind of failed as an industry if that's the only way to earn into crypto or buy crypto. We spent all these years now building all this non custodial technology, all this blockchain technology, the l two s and so on. And it seems at the moment we're just trying to onboard people into centralized ETF's, which is nothing towards what we've all been working towards.
00:14:14.860 - 00:14:30.876, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you for saying that to me. It's always a bit tiresome just seeing all this hype around ETF's. I get the significance, but also, I don't know, it's a bit lame for.
00:14:30.908 - 00:15:14.760, Speaker B: The reasons you said we failed as an industry. If that's the only way people can use crypto in the maintain mainstream world, then we've kind of wasted the last ten years in some ways building all of this transparent on chain technology, because none of that stuff is transparent. None of it uses any of the benefits of crypto, none of it uses the wallets underneath. No users are depositing, using their own wallets, their own keys or anything like that. Maybe we don't see them using their own keys in the future if they're using the underlying apps and so on, but at least they're using and deploying their money straight into actual defi that's being used then by other Defi participants, and not just being held in some sort of centralized wallet locked away in probably the 40th floor of a high rise office building or something.
00:15:15.260 - 00:15:39.850, Speaker A: Absolutely. So for you, the path forward would be, say, to get this passive summer fight earned product into like a more fintech or trad five bank front end for users to access. So like say, Robinhood integrates summary earn into their app long term.
00:15:39.970 - 00:16:28.428, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that's how we have to like look at like DeFi and so on. Like, again, hundreds of millions of people are not going to be using individual protocol front ends, I think, in signing individual transactions and so on. Like, just from a UX point of view, that's not how any apps kind of work today. Even if you look at like kind of banks and branches and so on, you just do your banking online now for everything that you don't have to go and prove who you are and queue up at a kiosk and so on, and give them your paying in book or whatever it is these days, I think we have to take banking, took the bank to where the users were, and that was on their mobile phones in reality. So take it wherever you are. I think we need to do the same with Defi in the long term if we want to onboard those hundreds of millions of users. We have to put Defi into the apps that we're already using today.
00:16:28.428 - 00:17:30.020, Speaker B: Because I don't think we can expect people, ordinary people, to just start sending their money or onboarding through all these different kind of on ramps onto these different websites and apps, and potentially even having ten or eleven different wallets for different networks, for different l one s and so on, different addresses for different things, and expect people to fragment their money and fragment their savings. Because even today, people that use crypto, the majority of us, we still have to, like, withdraw back to our bank accounts to pay our bills and so on. So if we can seamlessly integrate all of that into the thing that the users are using today, that's how we on board it. And I've said that kind of since 2018, since I joined Maker, that the one way to make crypto mainstream, or defi in particular mainstream, is it has to just feel like, kind of like the apps they're using today. And obviously, using crypto doesn't feel anything like, or using Defi doesn't feel anything like using a kind of traditional savings app or anything like that. But it's going to have to in the future for mainstream adoption.
00:17:30.100 - 00:17:42.800, Speaker A: So do you think that users managing private keys and transacting in DeFi in a non custodial way, will that remain a niche market?
00:17:43.300 - 00:19:45.896, Speaker B: I think a niche relative to the full scale of the market and so on, I think that market will continue to grow. I mean, in the same way that, like, most of the people trading stocks and so on, most people that have stocks are just exposed to ETF's and so on, that have a fund manager doing it all for them? There's very few in the grand scale of things that are actually kind of picking and choosing the stocks they want to buy and invest in and managing those, or kind of like the call options and so on. If you look at the percentage of people who do that, compared to the amount of people that have pensions or just savings accounts, where it's just deposited into kind of like pre configured ETF's that are rebalanced for you on a kind of like monthly or like kind of quarterly basis and so on, I think we'll maybe start to see the same eventually. But I think the important thing is that the people that are saving without doing all of that day to day management of private keys and so on, are still depositing into the underlying kind of transparent technology and providing liquidity to these new financial products, these DeFi protocols and so on, and where everything is transparent, and you have all the benefits of blockchain technology, depositing into something that is a whole lot better. Even if they're doing it in a obfuscated way through that app, they're still depositing into this new layer of technology that we've been working really hard on over the years to create better financial systems and more transparent financial systems. As long as that money is going into there in some way, I don't think we should be too worried about the average Joe on the street, like how they're saving their $200, for example. If we're using this new technology that we're working so hard to push to allow, then the others that have got maybe the 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, if they want to do the kind of advanced trading, the advanced borrowing and so on, the yield loops that are actually paying the yield to those savers to make it incentivize them to actually deposit into DeFi, if they know they're depositing into DeFi or not, then I think that's success moving forward.
00:19:46.048 - 00:20:03.620, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that makes sense. So now moving on to specifically the latest on Summerfi. So you just launched your point system. Yeah, we'd love to learn more about that, how it works.
00:20:04.180 - 00:20:32.866, Speaker B: Yes. Basically, in preparation for that protocol that we announced yesterday, that was in combination with announcing our point system for Summerfi, which is called rays. So if you think of summer, think of the sun, catch those rays and so on. So we're kind of playing on that theme. I know technically it's only summer in the northern hemisphere at the moment, but, yeah, yesterday was solstice. It was the first day of summer. And yet, to celebrate that, we launched our point system.
00:20:32.866 - 00:21:08.164, Speaker B: Effectively, what the point system does is just heavily reward users that are active on summify. Over 2 million addresses are eligible for raise points and so on. Many of those are just any active wallet. Basically on ethereum, optimism, arbitrary base. But you only have three months to be able to turn your raise into keep your raise, basically. So at the end of three months, you have to use summify one way or another. And if you've used Summerfi in those three months, if you've opened a position, you kept it open for at least 14 days.
00:21:08.164 - 00:22:07.962, Speaker B: I think it is then your raise become permanent and yeah, like when the new protocol launches very early next year, then yeah, those raids will kind of form a part of that, basically. And you can earn a ton of raise just by using summit. If you migrate your position from another front end, another protocol front end, you can earn a huge amount of raise just in that migration step. And then you earn raise basically per dollar managed on summer, and you can boost them via a load of different features on summer. So it's just a loyalty scheme, a reward scheme for doing, the more you do, the more points you get, and the more dollars you manage, the more you get capped at 10 million. So massive whales just come in, sweep up all the points. But yeah, it's super exciting and we've seen some kind of great data from it already, just from the last 24 hours when it launched.
00:22:08.026 - 00:22:13.746, Speaker A: Did you say that you already have a list of eligible wallets and where does that come from?
00:22:13.898 - 00:22:56.570, Speaker B: Yeah, so we've basically got four categories of users that are eligible for raise. So we did a huge retroactive kind of snapshot on the 18th, and at that point we looked at any wallet that had at least 0.2 ETH in it and had done at least transactions across main net optimism arbitrary base. So if you have a wallet with at least 0.2 ETH in it, and you have, yeah, you've done five transactions, then you'll be eligible for at least 100 raise on there. If you are a defi, like a borrowing and lending defi user, you will have 200 raise for every protocol you're currently active in. The list of protocols is effectively any protocol that Monsori had a subgraph for.
00:22:56.570 - 00:23:48.924, Speaker B: We support on the snapshot. So every active position gets another 200 points and then you've got, if you've used summer at any point in the last, since June 2021, you will have 500 points, which is boosted to 1500 points if you are active on that 18th. If you had an active position currently managed on somewhere on that 18th, then there's 1500 points per protocol that we're using. So if you're using like all five protocols that we have, you'd get 1500 points for each, each protocol that you are on. And then if you've been a power user of summify since then. So if you've ever used multiply, if you've ever used a yield loop, if you've ever used a kind of automation like protection automation or an optimization or use the migrate feature, you will earn 2000 points. I think it is.
00:23:48.924 - 00:24:27.090, Speaker B: I think it's 2000 for each feature you've used. And again, if you're an active user, it's boosted by three x on there. And then from the 18th, every active user earns around 690 points for every $10,000 they're managing on Summerfi per year. And there's various ways you can boost those points and earn instant points. If you trade using multiply or yield loops, or if you migrate in for another protocol, you earn 20% of the year's points and so on. So there's lots of, lots of different ways. Like summer five raise.
00:24:27.090 - 00:25:01.446, Speaker B: You can see the leaderboard, you can search your address, you can find out how many raids you've got, you can find out how best to claim your raise if you need to do anything in order to fully make them eligible. And, yeah, that's pretty much it. It's running pretty much for the next three years on there. But the next three months are super important. If you're not an active user right now, you just need to become an active user in the next three months to turn the rays into full raise, which, yeah, then we'll maybe turn into something else one day down the road.
00:25:01.558 - 00:25:11.410, Speaker A: If it's running for three years. Is that, do you expect that, do you expect rays will turn into a potential token after three years or could it happen before then?
00:25:12.030 - 00:25:25.960, Speaker B: I mean, if there's a token, yeah, it's going to be. Yeah, I mean, the razor, effectively the precursor to the summer earn protocol launching in 2025, which is going to need to be governed and so on.
00:25:29.260 - 00:25:31.164, Speaker A: So likely next year.
00:25:31.252 - 00:26:01.618, Speaker B: Okay, so, yeah, but at least three months away to do this kind of retroactive snapshot, basically. So everyone that was in that retroactive allocation, that then keeps their race but does something to make them fully illegible. Yeah. As we get closer to the launch of summer earn protocol, there's going to be more news and so on. And that said, that's coming. Hopefully. The plan is to have that finished, the full development of finished in the next few months and then.
00:26:01.618 - 00:26:03.954, Speaker B: Yeah, perhaps for release early 25th.
00:26:04.042 - 00:26:11.190, Speaker A: So you said you already had some interesting data just from the launch yesterday. What are you already seeing?
00:26:12.050 - 00:27:24.978, Speaker B: Just really seeing what we're intending to see from the outset and that really, which is, yeah, users doing some of the tasks that they need to do in order to claim their raise, whether that's migrating positions in. So we see a number of users now migrating their positions in from the protocol front ends into summer, hopefully discovering the kind of new advanced features they can get access to, maybe for the first time. And then yeah, seeing automations being enabled and so on. But obviously you've just seen a big uptick in activity and so on, which is really awesome to see. But yeah, from our point of view, really it's all about helping discovery of the features that we have and how you can basically better manage your position within DeFi on the protocols we support because we have a ton of features that can just help you manage those a little bit easier and hopefully sleep a little bit better at night. Like we've all, like the team that we have, all the features that have been built on Sumify have basically all been things that we all want to use and do use on a daily basis. So things like stop loss so you can go to bed at night if the market has a huge drop, kind of like we saw in June 22 or whatever like that.
00:27:24.978 - 00:28:13.816, Speaker B: You know, that the automation features just close you out your position if you don't wake up in time, for example. So there's certain features on there which is kind of in my mind like a no brainer. Like the stop loss is if you have an active position, it makes sense to, of course the people have their own reasons, but from my point of view it makes no sense not to just to enable stop loss, because if the price never drops to that point, then it never fires anyway. And if it does drop, say, when you're sleeping or when you're traveling, it's just going to close you out automatically without you having to do anything. And there's no extra cost to just using a manual close, for example. So it's kind of a no brainer in that sense. It's protection if you ever need it and hopefully you will never use it in some ways.
00:28:13.816 - 00:29:01.056, Speaker B: So from our point of view it's, yeah, like I said, you don't pay a fee for enabling it or anything like that. It's there as a backup. And then some of the other features we launched more recently are like take profit, like automated take profit, a feature that we all wish I think we had in 2021 and probably took more profits out of our positions instead of being so greedy. So now you can kind of take the emotion out of selling when the price is going up, set it when you're in a kind of rational mind, maybe in a fairly flat day like today, and think, okay, if the price starts going up, maybe above, like if it goes up above 4000, I'm going to start taking profits out every hundred dollars or something like that. You can set that up. And how you can set that up is you can keep a constant multiple as well. So you can keep your position maybe at like 2.5
00:29:01.056 - 00:29:34.548, Speaker B: x, and then every time the loan to value drops by 2% as the price is going up, it can just keep withdrawing a little bit of collateral, keeping you at 2.5 x just as the market's going up all the way. You can still have then your stop loss or your trailing stop loss sat behind. In some ways you can't lose, except the boundary when you open your position and set a stop loss. They're all products that we've built to solve our own problems, and as we see from the data, solving lots of users problems for them as well.
00:29:34.724 - 00:30:23.226, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, I mean, just those two features sound extremely useful for anyone holding crypto. But as we wrap up and as you're starting your points program and seeing activity pick up, this is something I've been interested in with just like airdrops becoming so prevalent in Defi, and it's, you know, how you're thinking about retaining those users because, you know, point systems, airdrops, yes, they do incentivize a lot of people coming in liquidity, but then they immediately leave when they get the token. So, yeah, how do you think about that and plan to actually retain those users that you're seeing today?
00:30:23.298 - 00:31:24.632, Speaker B: Yeah, so, I mean, Oasis app has been around for, well, from Oasis app days, it's been around for almost five years now, coming up to like kind of four and a half years, five years in November. And this is the first time we've ever done anything kind of like rewarding for users and given them back. And so all of the user growth we've had today has been organic and we have pretty good kind of like growth and like net kind of net growth and like kind of like very, very low churn data. In reality, particularly unless the markets are obviously dropping in 22, we lost a lot throughout 22, just as almost scandal after scandal kept happening during that year. But you look at fairly standard market conditions and the churn is fairly low. So I think any product that wants to retain their users, they have to solve problems for the users. You have to say, okay, what does the user need in order to stay? And obviously there's many crypto projects out there where it's gone, okay, we need to give them free money in order for them to stay.
00:31:24.632 - 00:32:10.358, Speaker B: But we firmly believe that actually the raise and the points are a bonus. And actually a lot of the features that we have are features that solve real problems to users internally. We use a framework we call jobs to be done. Where we talk about as a user, what job is it the users want to have done? For example, some of ours want to optimize their positions while protecting themselves from losses. So you can see we've got multiply and upwards automation to help them optimize their position, and we have things like stop loss to help them protect them against their position. So first and foremost, we just have to build products that solve real problems. And those problems are not just give me free money, basically.
00:32:10.358 - 00:33:26.666, Speaker B: And I think if you can solve real problems, then you will keep the users sometimes in this space, sometimes you're fighting kind of for mind space a little bit to say, hey, try our app or see some of the features that we have, give them a go and so on. We're very confident internally that if you give the features a go on Summerfy, then you'll stick with Summerfi in reality, because, yeah, we've built them after speaking to hundreds, maybe even like a thousand users over the last almost five years and so on. And we feel very strongly that we've built products that solve real problems for users in Defi, that semi sophisticated audience in Defi. Again, we're not solving problems for retail users, we're all aware of that and so on. That's what we're trying to do with the next product and why we're moving into that space, because that's the much bigger market, that is the next big opportunity. But actually, it's taken us maybe this time and waiting for the bite moment to say, hey, that problem is actually starting to exist for that market now. And we kind of saw in 21 again and 22, it was tested for us in some ways, the likes of Celsius and so on.
00:33:26.666 - 00:34:18.750, Speaker B: They advertise these yields. They said it was from Defi, but it was like, yeah, it wasn't real. And that's what we want to do this time. We want to make a, a product that can say that and mean it and show it and be trusted, basically. And again solve the problems where users can earn five, six, 7%, maybe just on a fraction of their portfolio, like a fraction of their savings and so on, from a diversification and risk point of view, but they can go and earn that, they can see how it works, they can see the transparency, if they want to, on chain, and actually see that the yield they're making is real yield coming from real users, and it isn't inflated, it isn't faked or anything like that. That yield that you're getting is real yield, and the app's not going to blow up one day and you're going to lose access to your money.
00:34:20.250 - 00:34:48.660, Speaker A: It's all about solving, just having the ability to maintain control over your assets key. Right. It's like, okay, you, you, it's transparent. So you're seeing where your money is held. You're seeing, you know, there's nothing sketchy, shady going on. It's not being lent to somebody you're not aware of. And at the same time, if the market is crashing, you, you can withdraw at any time.
00:34:48.660 - 00:36:10.026, Speaker A: Like, there's, there's no, there's not that fear of, oh, like it's the kind of my account going to be closed or are withdrawals going to be disabled? Like it happened in c five. So, yeah, yeah, that's why, you know, we keep, we keep kind of remain so bullish in defi because it just has proven to be the way forward time and time again. But yes, super excited to hear you are expanding into this more, you know, retail market while continuing to build great products for the more sophisticated user. And yeah, I love your take on points, too. It's been like such a, I think, like overused narrative that it can be abused. But I think if your focus remains solving a problem for users, rewarding users that, like a user base that's been grown organically and like you said, also just incentivizing, just like product discovery with point system. Yeah, I think that's just a smart way to go.
00:36:10.026 - 00:36:20.670, Speaker A: So, yeah, we'll continue covering, summarizing how the point system goes and yeah, we look forward to the earn product launch next year.
00:36:21.100 - 00:36:23.540, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. It's been great.
