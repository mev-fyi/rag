00:00:00.170 - 00:00:43.142, Speaker A: AI had infiltrated everything on the Internet, and I still knew nothing about using it. So to find out just how powerful generative AI tools could really be, we ran an experiment. My job was to harness the power of AI and boost crypto adoption, and hopefully save us from the bear market blues. What was my target? 50,000 views. Now I'll share the entire journey in this video, whether or not we reached that goal, and how you can very easily create your very own YouTube channel using only AI tools. Considering I know nothing about videography or editing, I urgently needed a strategy, no technical ability. So I asked for a plan and some content ideas which were fun, engaging, and understandable by a mainstream audience to help us reach the target.
00:00:43.142 - 00:01:25.682, Speaker A: Now, it's safe to assume the AI knew a thing or two about algohacking because it decided to post a new video at 02:00 p.m. Every day for 30 days. I first asked chat GPT to brainstorm names for our educational YouTube channel and got some brilliant and not so brilliant ideas. We eventually picked Casey's coin corner because it's a cool, neutral name with alliteration, and clearly I'm by no stretch of the imagination anything close to a software engineer. So once we had this absolutely fictitious channel description in place, I asked for prompts to use in logo generation. We took the chat GPT generated prompts and used them in mid journey to create a logo and a banner for the channel. Now, just as the creative process really took off is when things started getting a bit weird.
00:01:25.682 - 00:02:09.022, Speaker A: AI would either scramble the letters or invent words during the logo creation process, which was far from ideal. So once we had some workable assets, I followed the instructions and created this YouTube channel in about five minutes. Then I had to rush back to my overly confident AI boss for more instructions because I have no idea what I'm doing. So to get my scripts, I used three different AI chat bots to brainstorm video ideas. And I have to say, between OpenAI's chat GPT, Microsoft's Bing, and Google's Bard, the most usable responses really came from chat GPT. That's probably because I got suckered into paying $20 a month for the premium version, which can now even browse the web using Bing. With a channel and scripts in place, it was time to start creating the videos.
00:02:09.022 - 00:02:21.294, Speaker A: First, I tried to emulate some successful recipes for faceless YouTube channels, but it quickly turned out to be way too much manual work. I mean, the point was to let AI do all the heavy lifting. So I asked and received.
00:02:21.362 - 00:02:25.910, Speaker B: Did you know that an estimated three to 4 million bitcoins are believed to be lost forever?
00:02:25.990 - 00:03:10.594, Speaker A: After experimenting with some mediocre text to image tools like Steve AI, we discovered Pictory, which could quickly turn a script into a video. Once I upgraded my pictory counts, I was able to create more than three videos, add voiceovers in different accents, funky background music, move the text boxes around, and even prompt my audience to like and subscribe to the videos. Now it was all looking great, and surely we were on track to hit 50K views. And then disaster struck. AI lied about a bunch of topics like cryptokitties being a sound investment and the cryptokitties app being free to download on the App Store. Now AI has very clear contextual understanding limitations. The text to image AI would take our script about the sunny island of Malta and insert images of Iceland on a map.
00:03:10.594 - 00:03:31.882, Speaker A: According to Bing, Elon Musk is the biggest crypto influencer in the world. I'm not so sure about that. And getting Bard to understand what I wanted was an uphill struggle. At one point, it started putting out scripts with Casey's crypto corner instead of Casey's coin corner. Now, we googled this and found a copycat channel with that name. Zero uploaded content. Very fishy.
00:03:31.882 - 00:04:00.102, Speaker A: And then things got even weirder. YouTube's algorithm banned us for community violations. We had no idea why this was happening. We thought the experiment was about to end. At this point, just as things were getting started, it took us a week to get our cheeky AI generated appeal to be accepted by YouTube. Shockingly, the AI which read the appeal, granted us access again. So it turned out outsmarting AI was as simple as pitting two AIs against each other.
00:04:00.156 - 00:04:01.254, Speaker C: So you are a robot?
00:04:01.302 - 00:04:03.062, Speaker B: No, my name is Cliverba.
00:04:03.126 - 00:04:28.254, Speaker A: So let's review the last 30 days. No, we did not hit our target of 50,000 views. But we successfully launched an educational YouTube channel from scratch in no time. And that's surely an achievement in and of itself. And looking back, our crypto Mythbusters series was by far the top performing content. So Casey's crypto Mythbusters could have been a much better name choice. But then again, it's not about the name, it's the value of the content.
00:04:28.254 - 00:04:32.926, Speaker A: One interesting observation was that the videos with voiceovers performed way better.
00:04:33.028 - 00:04:36.610, Speaker C: So we're not quite in a crypto world on the earth.
00:04:36.690 - 00:05:05.850, Speaker A: But here's the silver lining. Without AI, this level of output would have been impossible. The key takeaway here is that anyone can leverage AI to create educational content without a professional team or even extensive technical know how. And who knows? Maybe if more of us jump on the same bandwagon, we could see bitcoin soaring to 69K again. But here's a word of caution. While AI is a fantastic tool, always cross verify the information that's generated by AI. Misinformation can lead to some unintended consequences.
00:05:05.850 - 00:05:22.330, Speaker A: So in the end, AI has the power to democratize content creation, making it accessible for all. And two, even though AI is a potent tool, it's far from taking over our jobs or even posing a threat to the human race. Not yet, at least. As always, thank you for watching this journey unfold and stay defiant.
