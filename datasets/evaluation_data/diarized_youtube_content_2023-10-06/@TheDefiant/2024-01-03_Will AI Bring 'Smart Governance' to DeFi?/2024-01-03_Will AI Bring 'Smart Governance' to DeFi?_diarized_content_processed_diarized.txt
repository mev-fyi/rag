00:00:00.250 - 00:00:59.962, Speaker A: I'm really excited about the idea of kind of the ecosystem that's governed by AI. And this is from the, from kind of one of the core challenges we've seen. I mean, it's a challenge of our, of humanity overall. But like with DAos, we've seen that there is a principal agent problem where there's either no agent and so there's nothing gets done or there's some selected people who actually run the DAO. But then it's becoming like a regular problem that those people have a very different incentives and motivation. And so I'm really excited in a transition where an AI model that's fully auditable, decentralized, is able to actually kind of act on behalf of the DAO and actually be the representation of the stakeholders of such dao. And so kind of scaling that to the whole ecosystem, be kind of the AI governance of the ecosystem.
00:00:59.962 - 00:01:24.978, Speaker A: So this is something that we kind of outlined the vision of and we started to work on kind of across the stack because you need a decentralized inference for that. You need data, provenance. You need kind of a lot of pieces in the ecosystem to do that. So I did like a talk at Nearcon about that for people who are interested, but that's something we kind of going to continue making progress on in the ecosystem.
00:01:25.074 - 00:01:29.770, Speaker B: Wow, so you're integrating AI into near governance?
00:01:30.270 - 00:01:30.826, Speaker A: Yes.
00:01:30.928 - 00:01:44.190, Speaker B: It's so interesting. Can you just go a bit deeper into that? How will it work? What's the benefit of having an AI run governance?
00:01:45.730 - 00:02:00.180, Speaker C: Need funding for your blockchain idea? The Stellar community Fund is funding projects with up to $100,000 in XLM per project to build on the stellar network. To get started, head over to Communityfund stellar.org and make a.
00:02:02.870 - 00:02:52.946, Speaker A: Kind of, the benefit is next that right now you have a set of people who are either, like, you have a large set of people and then they don't vote. Right. Voting participation is very low. We also have a kind of challenge, like is it stake based or person based? But then there are challenges around that. And so you have a kind of, like usually you use delegation, so you delegate to a subset of kind of participants in the Dow. And most often we see kind of generally in humanity, right. Like when we elect some representatives, they don't ideally represent people who elected them, right.
00:02:52.946 - 00:03:38.930, Speaker A: They have their own kind of, their own set of things that they want to do that may or may not fully, it usually doesn't fully align and sometimes very misaligned from the people who elected them. So this is so called principal agent problem. And with AI, what we're trying to do is to address that. And so kind of AI becoming a decision maker that can perfectly represent the stakeholders in it. Now, this is like a long term goal. The shorter term goal is something that becomes more of an assistant, where it can explain the proposals. Given the context that you have, it can provide summarization for all the discussions that happened.
00:03:38.930 - 00:04:44.050, Speaker A: Right? Like, for example, Cosmos had a lot of discussion around their recent proposal. Like, if I'm new to this and I'm trying to decide what to vote, I just want like, hey, summarize me pros and cons and actually can summarize it. And if I want more information, I can see where that information is coming from and dig in deeper. So, like actually creating a set of tools that kind of allow to have do the decision making, governance, capital allocation easier for kind of existing members, but then over time, making that more and more kind of process automated with decision making by AI. So that's kind of, again, a long term vision. But there's a very specific milestones of tooling that we can deliver now that can be starting to make interesting progress. We also had at Nearcon, actually, one of the projects did build like a first prototype of this where Dow, where kind of chat GPT has been proven through SGX into a DAO.
00:04:44.050 - 00:04:53.500, Speaker A: And so DaO can actually start making decisions based on chat GPT output. So we can see this piece is coming together now to kind of start experimenting with this.
00:04:54.110 - 00:05:41.930, Speaker B: That's so interesting. I mean, definitely a tool that can summarize governance forums will be extremely useful. Just like from covering this stuff, it definitely gets tricky to follow all the comments and all the proposals and all of that. So I think that's a great start. And then by having this AI agent vote for a token holder, would the idea be, I know this is kind of long ways off, but is the idea that there would be like a robot that kind of learns from your voting history or on chain history and kind of can guess what your interests are? Is that the idea?
00:05:42.080 - 00:06:16.582, Speaker A: Well, I mean, you can have a conversation with it, right? Again, there's different parts. Right? There can be part that represents you, which builds your interests and what you believe about it. And then there can be a global model that is just trying to optimize kind of overall success of the ecosystem. Right. Which is trying to propose things that are kind of going to push toward that. So you can have different pieces kind of fitting together into an overall system. But yeah, will be working kind of sounds.
00:06:16.582 - 00:06:21.080, Speaker A: The research we're going to be putting out on this in the next, in coming months.
