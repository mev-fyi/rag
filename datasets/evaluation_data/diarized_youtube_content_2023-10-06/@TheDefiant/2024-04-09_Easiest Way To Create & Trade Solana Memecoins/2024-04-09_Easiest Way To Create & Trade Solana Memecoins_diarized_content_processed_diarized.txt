00:00:00.240 - 00:00:42.574, Speaker A: The $56 billion meme coin market cap has people frothing at the mouths, and if you thought the meme coin hype was coming to an end, you can think again. Vitaliks recent comments on seeing value in meme coins, the rapid recovery from last weeks dip, and the rising number of new tokens appearing on Dexs all suggest that meme coin momentum is far from fading. But this isnt just another video about meme coins. Today were figuring out how to use pump fun and launch our very own meme coin for under $2 in one click. So lets see if its too good to be true. Solanas largest community conference is almost sold out. Keep watching to learn more.
00:00:42.574 - 00:01:16.824, Speaker A: Just a few days ago, Pump Fun announced their Memecoin launch and trading platform made over $5 million of revenue in just over a month, with over half a million dollars of revenue coming in a single day. So what is pump fun? Where did it come from and how can we get involved right away? Pump fun lets anyone in the Solana and blast ecosystems launch a coin that is instantly tradable without having to cede liquidity. According to their twitter, anyone can deploy a coin for under $2 in one click at pump fun sounds risky, so heres an early disclaimer.
00:01:16.944 - 00:01:24.224, Speaker B: Meme coins are an incredibly risky endeavor, so please do your due diligence before aping in. And if you must only spend money.
00:01:24.264 - 00:02:24.672, Speaker A: You can afford to lose, Pomp Fun was initially launched for Solana tokens back in January, but later added support for the Ethereum L two network blast. And by the way, we have made videos on blast and solana meme coins, so if you're interested, go and check those out. To prevent rug pulls, the pump fund team ensures all created tokens are a fair launch, meaning no presale and no team allocations. And while there is still a fair discussion to be had about allowing literally anyone in the world to launch a token, Professor Skelly thinks Pomp Fun introduces an objectively better way to launch tokens. He argues that while the regular token launch method has missed aligned incentives which favour fast selling and snipers with pump fun, buyers can see the holder distribution and bonding curve progress. So in short, if you buy 40% of your own coin, nobody will buy into the project because you could dump it and rug. Alright, now that we know about pump dot fun and what it does, let's dive in.
00:02:24.672 - 00:03:32.688, Speaker A: But before we continue with our own meme coin launch, a very quick word from today's sponsor. So we're going to start by heading over to pump fun and we're going to see how it works. So to buy tokens, we're going to pick one we like and buy it while it's still on the bottom curve. A bonding curve is a mathematical curve that determines the price of the token based on the supply. The price will typically increase as more tokens are purchased. Now, if the token gets enough support and it reaches a market cap of $69,000, then twelve k of the liquidity is deposited on radium and burned. To buy a token, we'll need to connect a wallet like metamask or solflare.
00:03:32.688 - 00:04:04.994, Speaker A: So let's go ahead and do that. We're going to click on connect wallet, click on metamask, and follow the simple steps. When you're on the homepage, you can turn off these animations to avoid getting epilepsy. They are intense. Now, once we're connected, we'll need to have some sol in our solflare wallet and we can find a token we want to buy by using the search function or just scrolling. Now, bearing in mind some of these are highly inappropriately named, so feel free to skip all of those. Let's see what we can find.
00:04:04.994 - 00:04:38.334, Speaker A: We like donkeys, so assuming we found a token that we want to buy, we can scroll down and we're going to see the bonding curve progress, as in how far from the 69k are we to fill that bonding curve? You can see that only 1% of that is filled. These are all very, very new tokens. Bender. Bender tokens been around for a little while and we can see that the bonding curve progress is 89%. So this looks a little bit safer. We see a lot of buying activity, a lot of comments. So we're going to input the amount that we want to buy and we're going to click on place trade.
00:04:38.334 - 00:05:29.674, Speaker A: Now, every purchase comes with a comment, so we're going to leave a little comment saying NFA dyor, we're going to place trade, we're going to approve this inside metamask and we're good to go. While we wait for that transaction to confirm, we're going to go over to the main screen and figure out how to launch our own token. So to launch our own meme coin, we have to click on start a new coin, and at this point we can enter a cool name, the ticker symbol, upload an image, use the drop down menu to add the socials if we want, or alternatively, we can choose to remain anonymous. And then we're going to press create coin and it's done in three clicks. So let's name our token test token. The ticker symbol is going to be test and the description will be NFA. Do your own research.
00:05:29.674 - 00:05:56.514, Speaker A: Let's find an image to upload. It's a picture of a sandwich and I'm going to swipe that away. Now the show more options drop down menu will give me the option to add twitter, telegram and a website if we have one. We don't. So we're going to skip this and remain anonymous. Then I'm going to click create coin. Now here we can decide how much sol we want to add while launching.
00:05:56.514 - 00:06:26.116, Speaker A: I would recommend not adding a huge amount of money as you might lose all of it. Create token and we confirm in metamask approve. There it is. So this will take us back to the home screen where we can enter the token page. Assuming this token was the one we launched, let's click on it. We would be greeted by the price action chart. We'd be having the option to buy more, we'd have the option to sell and we could see also the holder distribution.
00:06:26.116 - 00:06:58.474, Speaker A: And on the left hand side of the page you'd see all the comments that people leave while buying your meme coin. All right, so now we know how to use pump fund to find newly launched tokens. Check the token distribution and the bonding curve. Progress. And we also know how we can launch our very own meme coins with a tiny amount of money, loads of fun, and a final disclaimer, the risk of any meme coin losing most or even all of its value is significant. Especially when absolutely anyone could have launched the token. Please never risk more money than you can afford to lose.
00:06:58.474 - 00:07:01.314, Speaker A: And with that, thank you for tuning in and stay defiant.
