00:00:00.090 - 00:00:02.254, Speaker A: How are you addressing that kind of squatter problem.
00:00:02.372 - 00:00:37.010, Speaker B: Choosing things like an annual fee rather than a one off fee? Because for me to or for you, for instance, to pay $5 a year for Tegan ETH is not a big deal. For someone who's speculating on 500 names, paying $5 per name is a bigger deal. If we had a one off fee, they could absorb that fee, and then they could sit on the name forever. They'd have no incentive to move them on to other people. They could always wait for that massive payday. And so those are examples of where we've tried to structure the system so that it makes the systems better tailored to the end users we want to attract.
