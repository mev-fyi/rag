00:00:04.570 - 00:00:26.070, Speaker A: Idan Yago is the co founder of Sovereign, a bitcoin based lending protocol. He's maybe the first bitcoin builder we have had on the show, and that's because DeFi on the first blockchain network has been a little bit slow to pick up. But Idan says that's about to change. So what exactly is sovereign and how did Idan's path lead him to become contributor?
00:00:26.490 - 00:00:30.294, Speaker B: Idan, welcome to the defined podcast. It's great to have you here.
00:00:30.412 - 00:00:32.854, Speaker C: Exciting to be here, looking forward to it.
00:00:33.052 - 00:01:30.870, Speaker B: Awesome. Great. So at the we usually, we haven't had many kind of bitcoin builders, so I'm super interested to hear from you kind of your experience and a lot more about what DeFi on bitcoin is looking like. Super interested about that. In November, there was a big upgrade on bitcoin called Taproot, which was heralded as a way to unlock smart contracts on bitcoin, which of course this is key to further developing DeFi there. So we'll get into all of that. But before, I'd love to just get a brief overview of what sovereign is and then we'll go right into just like learning more about your background and what led you to start contributing to sovereign.
00:01:30.870 - 00:01:34.794, Speaker B: So yeah, if you can just give us a brief overview of sovereign itself.
00:01:34.992 - 00:02:41.226, Speaker C: Sure. So a lot of people think that you can't build smart contracts or greater throughput or privacy on bitcoin, right? And the truth is that you can and you can do it today, but you need to put together different pieces of the bitcoin L2 technology stack. So a lot of really cool technology has been built out. And what sovereign is doing is it's bundling that together into kind of like an operating system for extending the capabilities of bitcoin and giving bitcoin even more superpowers. So sovereign is a system built on a technology called Rootstock, as well as lightning network. And Rootstock is a bitcoin side chain which has EVM compatible smart contracts. So you can think of it like all the capabilities of Ethereum, secured by bitcoin miners using bitcoin as the native asset.
00:02:41.226 - 00:03:20.498, Speaker C: And with sovereign, what we're looking to do is build a world around bitcoin, a world that looks more like bitcoin. Secure, reliable, permissionless, borderless, censorship resistant. And the first things that the community and the developers have been building out are primarily those things which are tied to economic and financial sovereignty. So decentralized trading, decentralized lending, bitcoin backed stablecoins governance, that is secured by bitcoin miners, and now also introducing things like perpetual swaps and futures markets.
00:03:20.694 - 00:03:30.030, Speaker B: Awesome. Okay, definitely. We'll dig into all of that coming up, but first, I'd love to get to know Edan.
00:03:32.050 - 00:03:32.366, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:32.388 - 00:03:45.826, Speaker B: If you can kind of tell me more about your background, where you're from, what was your pre bitcoin life? What got you interested in bitcoin? What got you interested in. Started building sovereign.
00:03:46.018 - 00:04:27.922, Speaker C: Yeah. So I grew up in apartheid South Africa. That was the South Africa that discriminated against pretty much everyone who wasn't white. And my family was jewish. One part of my family had been discriminated against by the British because they were german Jews. The other part of the family had been discriminated against by the Germans because they were polish and lithuanian Jews, and they went through the Holocaust. And in South Africa, the south african part of my family became very active in working against the apartheid government.
00:04:27.922 - 00:05:36.360, Speaker C: So much so that some of them had to flee South Africa in the middle of the night because the government had defined them as terrorists. And so when I was very young, I grew up on this tradition, know part of my family only having survived the Holocaust because they had managed to smuggle jewels. And then when I was nine, I started smuggling gold out of South Africa because my mother would sew Krugerans, gold coins into my clothes and then send me flying overseas so that I could get money to my family. I grew up in a very sort of politically aware environment. And in particular, the lessons that I learned were that the basis for freedom, right, that what gives people the ability to be free and to be sovereign is having sovereignty over their economic and financial destiny. And that's the first thing that oppressive regimes try to limit. You lived in Argentina for a while, so I'm sure you are very aware of this as well.
00:05:36.360 - 00:06:43.550, Speaker C: And so later on, when the family left South Africa, I started studying neuroscience and then started focusing on machine learning. And many years later, I had moved to the United States, and I was involved in starting a few startups. And one of the startups that I was involved in was working on diagnostic tools using machine learning. And I was reading a lot about neural networks and network science in general. And so in 2011, on a very, very cold day, I read this paper, which blew my mind, and I came across it by mistake, because I was reading papers in network science, and it was the bitcoin white paper. And by the time I had finished reading that had become convinced that this was the biggest, most important thing that I'd ever come across, I messaged everyone I knew and telling them that they need to pay attention to this because it was going to be something which would impact the rest of our lives. Most of them ignored me initially, but now have gotten excited about it as well.
00:06:43.550 - 00:07:02.850, Speaker C: And ever since then, I've been pretty much all in on bitcoin as the best way for us to build privacy and in particular property rights and sovereignty for people in a digital age. So that's how I got into bitcoin.
00:07:03.670 - 00:07:22.460, Speaker B: Awesome. This was 2011, so pretty early on in kind of crypto history, relatively speaking, from there to starting work on sovereign. How was that process?
00:07:22.830 - 00:08:21.200, Speaker C: Well, that happened many years later in the early days of bitcoin. First of all, the early days of bitcoin were very similar in some ways to today. Everyone thought that they were late. Everyone thought, oh, why didn't I get in earlier? But more fundamentally, there was a huge sense of adventure and innovation around the entire space and around what bitcoin could be. And one of the key things that was exciting to people was this idea of not just having sound money and decentralized money, but of having a sound financial system around it, decentralized exchanges, decentralized lending. And because it was very difficult to build this around bitcoin, there was this strong desire to do it. But it never quite happened.
00:08:21.200 - 00:09:29.538, Speaker C: And many years later, so Ethereum came out, and Ethereum started demonstrating various ways that people could become excited about smart contracts. And when the pandemic hit with a number of other bitcoiners, we were involved in trying to donate masks to various places, and we were taking donations in bitcoin, and we wanted to give people NFTs whenever they would donate. And so we started looking to see how we could build this on bitcoin. And several months later, a few developers who I'd been working with on this showed me that they had continued this work and taken some of those ideas and used it to build a decentralized exchange. And I got very, very excited and got involved. And so this was late 2020. And so if bitcoin was a reaction to the crisis of 2008, in many ways, sovereign is a reaction to the crisis of 2020.
00:09:29.538 - 00:09:48.538, Speaker C: And this idea that we really, really need to find ways not just of having control over our money, but also being able to interact with that money, being able to put that money to use in a decentralized way, and that finally the technologies had matured to a point that we could start doing that.
00:09:48.704 - 00:09:53.530, Speaker B: Awesome. Eden, what makes you defiant?
00:09:54.270 - 00:11:23.494, Speaker C: Well, I think my personality, on the one hand, I grew up in a family, which I think several generations of my ancestors have all been defiant people and have all, in one way or another, gotten involved and had very, very strong opinions and have been willing to be activists. My great grandfather was expelled from Soviet Russia for being too communist. He was like a communist anarchist, and he was handing out anarchist pamphlets in the Red Square, and they expelled him from Russia. And other parts of my family have been involved in the Warsaw ghetto uprising. And other parts of my family were involved in working against the apartheid regime in South Africa. So I think know a sense of history really, for me, which is that especially, I think, in the western world, you know, like in Europe or in the United States, there's one or two generations of people who have grown up in a world which seems very safe. Things are starting to change.
00:11:23.494 - 00:12:27.530, Speaker C: Now, I think the world, even there, is starting to feel less safe. But I grew up in stories and in personal experiences of how quickly things can change and how quickly things can deteriorate, and how important it is that we never give up the keys to our freedom, because once you give them up, you never get them. You know, it's not just money, it's also giving up your personal information to Facebook. It's also giving up your rights to travel to the TSA or to the health authorities around COVID. They're very, very dangerous paths that we can easily go down if we start giving up freedoms, because you never get them back without huge effort and pain. So it's that lesson, right, of how asymmetrical the problem is. Like, everything can be fine until it isn't, but by the time it isn't, it's too late.
00:12:27.530 - 00:12:43.710, Speaker C: So it's always been important to me, first for me to maintain my own sovereignty, but also to try and build a world more sovereign, where individuals don't have to give up their freedoms.
00:12:44.130 - 00:13:25.914, Speaker A: In 2021, Ethereum traders lost over $240,000,000 to malicious bots exploiting their trades. Eden Network is a next generation private transaction service for Ethereum, providing traders with MEV protection by submitting transactions directly to miners and away from the prying eyes of harmful bots. Eden Network recently launched Eden rocket RPC, which compiles some of Ethereum's fastest private transaction networks. Eden Network is backed by Multicoin Capital, Alameda Research, Jump Capital, Wintermute, among many others. Doing the best. Setting up Eden rocket RPC takes less than two minutes. Get started now at RPC.
00:13:25.914 - 00:13:54.070, Speaker A: Edennetwork IO. One of the core targets from the inception of sovereign was to create a bitcoin based NFT market. Edan explains why he decided to go to bitcoin instead of build on the already booming ethereum NFT ecosystem. He talks about how bitcoin L2s, like rootstock and the Lightning Network are providing all the programmability and scalability needed for decentralized applications.
00:13:54.490 - 00:14:55.930, Speaker C: Well, I think it's a good question first, like, why are nfts important at all? And I think the reason NFTs are important is because the big innovation that Satoshi brought to the world is the fact that we now have digital, borderless, nonviolent property rights. So bitcoin is a very specific, special kind of property, but it is protected by this massive institution, which is the bitcoin network, right? It's not just the computers, it's not just the ASICs, it's not just the nodes. It's not just the bitcoin holders. All of this together represents a totally new kind of human institution that is completely voluntary to participate in, but that creates a new kind of property, right, that has never existed before. It doesn't rely on violence, it doesn't rely on geography. This is a phenomenal idea. And I think this idea can be expanded beyond just sound money into sound, borderless property of all kinds.
00:14:55.930 - 00:15:55.470, Speaker C: But because it's such a fundamentally important thing, it needs to be built in the most fundamentally secure, reliable, and permanent system, and it needs to be built with true, principled intention, right? It needs to actually work. So, like a moment ago, you were asking me the question. You said, well, if NFTs already work well on Ethereum, and then you kind of backed away and was like, well, at least they're popular and work, right? But that's the problem. If we make sacrifices, if we take shortcuts when we're building this very, very fundamental thing, which is people's property rights. And we build not only by taking shortcuts, but also on systems which maybe aren't. We don't know what they're going to look like in six months or two years or ten years, right? So we don't know if they're permanent. We don't know if they're secure.
00:15:55.470 - 00:16:43.760, Speaker C: Then we're building something which is extremely temporary. And property rights cannot be temporary. They have to have longevity. They're the basis of how we build our economies, how we manage our lives. And I think that's the big thing that has been missed, or that, like everyone from vcs to people who are building on smart contract platforms like Solana, the big thing is not how decentralized things are. The big question is not how many nodes there are. The question is why is it decentralized? And the reason bitcoin is decentralized is because that makes it impossible to manipulate, or in another word, impossible to change.
00:16:43.760 - 00:17:19.974, Speaker C: And that is what makes it reliable. So this really isn't a technology at all. Software is something. Technology is something which is always changing. And when you look at the space through the lens of someone who's investing in technology, then you're making a category error. We're not building technology, we're building fundamental social institutions. And frankly, I don't think that any of these other systems have approached the problem the way that bitcoin has, building a fundamentally secure social institution.
00:17:19.974 - 00:17:35.002, Speaker C: They've all treated themselves as technologies, and in that respect I think they've missed the point and also have not built out the kind of permanent, reliable systems that we would want to build a new kind of economy, a new kind of world upon.
00:17:35.146 - 00:18:11.820, Speaker B: Interesting. Well, I mean, the reason I backtracked was because I didn't want to include kind of my judgment in the question. But also some people might say NFTs on Ethereum don't work very well because of the high fees you have to pay on Ethereum, and because different reasons that you could say the same thing about transactions on bitcoin. Just clarifying there why I backtracked. Not because I think NFTs on Ethereum are bad at all. I actually have my own.
00:18:13.710 - 00:19:16.366, Speaker C: I agree with you. Yeah, look, I think Ethereum has done phenomenal things, and there are extremely important innovations which we must learn from, and can learn from in the Ethereum ecosystem. And the Ethereum ecosystem has brought in a huge amount of excited, super intelligent developers who are building amazing stuff, including things like zero knowledge proof rollups, which I don't think would have happened without Ethereum, even though they're not directly an Ethereum thing. So the problem isn't when you say NFTs maybe don't work on Ethereum, or don't completely work right, there's a whole bunch of different reasons that maybe people would be upset with NFTs or criticize NFTs on Ethereum. One is high fees, another is they maybe aren't decentralized enough. Another is there's a huge amount of.
00:19:16.468 - 00:20:28.514, Speaker B: The main energy consumption, like the main reasons I see on Ethereum that people criticize. I wonder how bitcoin would do them better. And not just like for NFTs. Maybe we could broaden the question. I'd love to hear your thoughts on what ways could defi on bitcoin be better than DeFi on other smart contract platforms, including Ethereum, because for the NFT case, specifically, the criticism I hear the most about NFTs are high transaction fees and high energy consumption with proof of work. I don't think bitcoin, for either of those criticisms, bitcoin could do better, but I don't know. I'd love your thoughts on not just nfts, but in general, what do you think bitcoin can improve? In what ways does bitcoin improve? The Defi experience or DeFi applications?
00:20:28.642 - 00:21:15.220, Speaker C: Sure. First of all, let me separate between the energy consumption aspect and the high fees aspect, right? So the energy consumption aspect, I think is a poor criticism. I think same. We want to spend energy on a lot of things, right? On everything from dishwashers to electric cars. And so the question is, where do we spend the electricity? Where it provides us with benefit. And I think if we're building a system which provides for borderless, nonviolent property rights, that's a massive, massive benefit. And if the price that we need to pay for that is the consumption of electricity, most of which is green, I think that's a price well worth paying.
00:21:15.220 - 00:22:08.226, Speaker C: So that's true for Ethereum and that's true for bitcoin or any system. The other point is the high transaction fees. Now the high transaction fees. I actually think that there is something fundamentally different there between bitcoin and Ethereum. And the fundamentally different thing is that Ethereum has started, or the approach that Ethereum took to providing smart contracts. And as a result, also its ultimate scalability was by building everything onto layer one, whereas bitcoin has taken a much more conservative approach of building very, very little on layer one. And then everything else is built on additional layers built on top of bitcoin.
00:22:08.226 - 00:23:00.758, Speaker C: Now this actually means that you never get to the same kind of fees and cost, certainly not on L2 that you have today with Ethereum, layer one. And now Ethereum is also, through roll ups, attempting to utilize the strategy of scaling via L2. But I think it was fundamentally something which at least a lot of people recognized was not going to scale. I don't think any layer one system can properly scale. So both of those things, however, are sort of like features, right? Like some people will say, oh, the feature that I want is less energy consumption, or the feature that I want is greater scalability. And I actually don't think that that's where the interesting difference lies. I think the interesting difference lies somewhere else.
00:23:00.758 - 00:24:20.510, Speaker C: The interesting difference lies in the fact that bitcoin has been around now for around 13 years and is very, very similar, almost identical in a fundamental way, it works to the way it was 13 years ago, whereas every other system changes far more frequently, is far less reliable. And that's the big difference. The big difference is that when we're building finance, right, the majority of finance is not what we see today with DeFi, like yield, farming and things like that. The majority of finance is more like what we see in specific corners of defi, things like AAVE or compound or uniswap. Those are the basic functions of trading, lending, derivatives. Those are things where the people who are engaged in that, right, not in the crypto world, but in the rest of the world, the primary thing that they're focused on is wealth preservation, and then only as a secondary consideration is it growing their wealth. And when it comes to wealth preservation, the number one thing that you want is reliability.
00:24:20.510 - 00:25:01.470, Speaker C: And really only bitcoin has provided this base layer of reliability where, you know, it's not just going to be the same next year as it is today, but it will be the same in ten years, and it'll be the same for your children and for your grandchildren. And so it is something that you can have a pension on, it is something that you can build a trust fund for your children on. It's something that you can pass down from generation to generation. And so as a result, when you want to build a property rights and a financial system that the entire world can use to replace the one that we have now, you want something which is going to be on that level of reliability.
00:25:02.130 - 00:25:38.554, Speaker B: I wonder, why do you think, I understand Ethereum has changed more than bitcoin for sure, but why do you view it as unreliable? Like, Ethereum has never been down, all the transactions have always been approved. It's changed to upgrade and reflect the changing priorities of developers and users. But it's still been reliable. I think.
00:25:38.752 - 00:27:03.330, Speaker C: I think that's a great question because it illuminates in another way the distinction that I'm making between the technology and the features and the rules, right? So when I'm talking about reliability, I'm not primarily talking about the uptime or the features, because this is not AWS, it's not a technology service that I'm interested in, it's a institutional service that I'm interested in. And so what really matters is the rule set. Now, Ethereum has taken the approach of quite frequently changing the rule set in fairly dramatic ways, right? For example, when you change the entire consensus mechanism. You're changing maybe the most fundamental aspect of the rule set, whereas the rule set with bitcoin is more minimalist and hasn't changed. And the reason this is an important distinction is because when we are using a blockchain, we're not using technology, right? It's terrible technology. It's much slower, much less efficient than any database or server system or cloud system we could use. We're using it because what it actually is is a set of rules which we come to consensus around and then can't really change, and certainly it can't manipulate.
00:27:03.330 - 00:27:20.940, Speaker C: And so the focus should be on the institution, the social institution, the set of rules. And sometimes I call bitcoin permaware instead of software because it's like a set of rules that are, it's written in code, but it's like it's been etched in stone. And that is a very, very important property.
00:27:22.510 - 00:28:21.354, Speaker A: Have you heard of Oasis network? Oasis is a scalable, privacy enabled blockchain that surpassed $100 million in TVL within 12 hours from launch. They recently announced a 200 million dollar ecosystem fund dedicated to helping projects build on the network, and is supported by investors including Pantera Finance Lab, Dragonfly and Electric Capital. It's one of the two most invested in blockchains, according to Mesari, and has a partner ecosystem that includes Fortune 500 companies. Oasis aims to be a hub for DFI with its lower gas fees versus Ethereum high throughput privacy protection and defense against MEB. The wormhole bridge and the new Yuzu swap decks are both live on Oasis. Through Yusu, swap users can participate in liquidity pools, swap trade and earn rewards with high APY. Visit oasisprotocol.org
00:28:21.354 - 00:28:56.920, Speaker A: and yususwap.com to learn more. Ethereum and other smart contracts platforms have evolved over time, with use cases like tokens, Daos and NFTs flourishing. Meanwhile, bitcoin has mainly looked on from the sidelines as its use case as a safe haven and store value became stronger. Eden says there has been a gradual mentality shift as bitcoiners accept that the first cryptocurrency should be able to support a wider array of use cases to become the backbone of a more decentralized financial system.
00:28:57.470 - 00:29:52.310, Speaker C: So rootstock doesn't maintain the same set of rules that bitcoin does. It adds additional rules, but it adds those rules in a way where they are enforced and secured by the bitcoin miners and where the base asset, bitcoin, continues to maintain those rules. So earlier you mentioned it's been hard to build on bitcoin layer one. And so that's why developers have chosen to build on bitcoin L2. But I think it's actually different from that. It's impossible to build on bitcoin layer one in many ways, and that's a feature. The idea was that you don't expand the rule set of bitcoin layer one because that's the broadest set of consensus.
00:29:52.310 - 00:30:26.520, Speaker C: Right. And the more people that need to use something, the fewer rules that you want it to have. And then you basically have a hierarchy of rules. Right. This is the most basic rule, and then people can opt into additional layers of rules. And so what you're doing when you're using rootstock is you're using bitcoin and then opting into an additional set of rules which give you access to the smart contracts, the EVM compatibility, and the various defi tools that are available.
00:30:26.970 - 00:30:29.250, Speaker B: Rootstock is EVM compatible.
00:30:29.410 - 00:30:37.810, Speaker C: Yes. So you can basically port any contract that exists on another EVM chain to rootstock.
00:30:37.890 - 00:31:07.074, Speaker B: Oh, that's so funny. I didn't know that. Okay, wait, so rootstock uses Ethereum virtual machine. And what kind of L2 tech is it? Is it like an optimistic roll up, or is it like a side chain? It's a side chain, yes, it's a side chain. Does it have, like, it's a merged mine side chain? Okay.
00:31:07.112 - 00:31:40.530, Speaker C: Yes. So it's a merged mine side chain, which means that the bitcoin miners who are mining bitcoin are also mining rootstock and hashes that wouldn't find a bitcoin block might find a rootstock block. And so you basically get this very cool property where on the one hand, you can piggyback on the security of bitcoin proof of work, and on the other hand, the transactions that are occurring on rootstock are paying fees in bitcoin to the bitcoin miners and increasing the security budget of bitcoin.
00:31:40.710 - 00:31:52.138, Speaker B: Got it. Do you know how many nodes are securing that chain?
00:31:52.314 - 00:32:03.762, Speaker C: I actually don't know. I haven't checked recently, but there are quite a few. I mean, just sovereign. The sovereign community alone is running tens of nodes, so I don't know.
00:32:03.816 - 00:32:54.770, Speaker B: Okay, cool. And then lastly on rootstock, because I'm interested in kind of this base layer that you're building on, is the level of control that there might be on rootstock smart contracts, like upgradability, like in the case of Ethereum, there is kind of controversy around how centralized polygon is because the bridge is controlled by a multi Sig wallet. Which a handful of people have control over, and that obviously poses security concerns. Yeah. In the case of rootstock, do you know how those smart contracts are managed?
00:32:55.190 - 00:32:56.626, Speaker C: Which smart contracts? The bridge.
00:32:56.658 - 00:32:57.910, Speaker B: Smart contracts, yeah.
00:32:57.980 - 00:34:17.866, Speaker C: Which smart contracts are different. Oh, yes. So, the way you transfer bitcoin into the rootstock side chain is through a bitcoin peg. It's a bi directional bitcoin peg, and it uses a combination of, effectively, a multi SiG system with hardware, secure devices, and spv proofs. So SPV proofs are shared between the two chains to the peg signatories, or what are called pegnitaries, who, in addition to signing themselves, also need to have an HSM, which signs as well. So this is what I think you would call a federated peg, and it's probably the most secure way of transferring bitcoin on and off a main chain that exists anywhere. But it is also something which is one of the core things that we're constantly working to improve and with the goal of eventually getting to a cryptographic or purely trustless peg.
00:34:17.866 - 00:34:37.586, Speaker C: So the purely trustless two way Peg is something which doesn't yet exist for bitcoin, and I think is effectively like the loss. It's like the final boss. Right. Once we've done that, then it truly becomes possible to build anything in a trustless manner on bitcoin.
00:34:37.778 - 00:34:52.998, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. But right now that every DeFi protocol building on rootstock has to depend on this kind of federated bridge between rootstock and bitcoin.
00:34:53.174 - 00:35:24.974, Speaker C: Well, no, only the users of bitcoin need to do that. Right. The spark contracts themselves have nothing to do with the pegnotaries. They are purely dependent on the proof of work security. Right. So it's not like Polygon, which has its own security system, its own consensus mechanism. A root stock is sharing and piggybacking off of bitcoin proof of work.
00:35:24.974 - 00:35:36.962, Speaker C: Right. So there's a direct link there, and that's what moves the chain forward. That's what discovers and creates the blocks, and that's what secures the smart contracts.
00:35:37.026 - 00:36:04.962, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. And then on top of rootstock. So I understand, lightning network is a L2 that is mostly used to send bitcoin from one place to another. Right. It's like a payment network, and then Rootstock would be like the smart contracts layer, right?
00:36:05.016 - 00:36:05.474, Speaker C: Right. Yes.
00:36:05.512 - 00:36:15.300, Speaker B: Is that a good way to see it? Okay, cool. Yes. Is the view that the future.
00:36:17.130 - 00:36:17.638, Speaker C: Of.
00:36:17.724 - 00:36:29.030, Speaker B: DeFi on bitcoin will have to be built on rootstock, or is the idea that there will be multiple L2s coexisting?
00:36:29.530 - 00:37:11.000, Speaker C: No, I think that they're probably going to be more than one L2. And already, like we mentioned, there's lightning network, Android stock and sovereign combines both of them. And so one of the very exciting things that sovereign is doing is providing you the ability through lightning network to interact directly with smart contracts, to use smart contracts to improve lightning network and also to use those smart contracts to bring other tokens like bitcoin backed stablecoins to lightning network. So you can begin not just transacting with bitcoin, but also transacting with dollars that are backed by bitcoin. And so I think when you start to combine these different L2s, you can get very cool properties that each one in isolation wouldn't be able to provide.
00:37:11.370 - 00:37:33.034, Speaker B: Oh, very cool. Now, can you dive a bit deeper on what sovereign does? Is it kind of like in Ethereum world, kind of like a maker dow that allows you to lend and borrow crypto in a permissionless way or. Yeah, if you can kind of go.
00:37:33.072 - 00:38:09.210, Speaker C: Deeper on that, sure. So sovereign exists on three layers, right? The three parts of the sovereign stack. The base layer is the infrastructure stack. And that's sort of like an operating system for developers who want to use the different parts of bitcoin. Layer two, right. So it combines rootstock with bridges to other chains with lightning network and tooling around the EVM system which makes it truly evm compatible and allows you to port contracts. And so developers can build on that part of sovereign.
00:38:09.210 - 00:39:25.098, Speaker C: One step up on the stack is the sovereign core system, which has the governance as well as the core primitives for trading, lending, creating bitcoin backed stablecoins. One of the very cool things that is being developed now is kind of similar to liquidity. If you're familiar with liquidity, the ability to create zero interest loans against your bitcoin and hold them into perpetuity so you never need to sell your bitcoin ever again. You can just get dollars and they're backed by bitcoin. And so those core primitives are part of the core primitive set that comes with sovereign. And then the final layer is the ecosystem layer where other applications or other teams can build and plug into sovereign. And so there's a launch pad being built and there NFT projects and there's FX trading projects that are building and they all integrate into sovereign.
00:39:25.098 - 00:39:39.618, Speaker C: So sovereign is kind of got some aspects which it's like a layer one and some aspects where it's like a Dap and it combines those aspects.
00:39:39.714 - 00:39:47.522, Speaker B: Very cool. I saw on the sovereign website that you have a bit over 300 million of value locked.
00:39:47.666 - 00:40:30.760, Speaker C: Yes. So it changes from time to time. I'm not sure I need to check right now how much it is, but it's been fluctuating between 100 million and 300 million. The system launched in late April, so it's been up for around eight months and has seen 13,000 users participate in governance. It's had over $2 billion in trades that have been performed over the system. And so it's really growing much faster, I think, certainly than anyone expected. A L2 system in bitcoin to grow.
00:40:30.760 - 00:41:22.054, Speaker C: And it's been very encouraging to see when you can start providing people with the ability to use their bitcoin in a way which is secured by bitcoin and without middlemen, and start putting their bitcoin to work. There's very significant interest in doing that. And I think the things that people are when people are using bitcoin, as opposed the same people, you probably, me, a lot of people have bitcoin as well as various other tokens and assets. Right. But I think people have a slightly different mindset when they thinking about their bitcoin versus when they're thinking about some other tokens that they're holding. The other tokens are typically more of a speculative or high risk, or sometimes get rich quick thing. Right.
00:41:22.054 - 00:41:43.774, Speaker C: That's the mental mode that people are in when they're using it. And the mental mode that people have when they're using their bitcoin is different. It's usually more of a savings. Right. This is like where you put. It's like the conservative part of crypto, right. And so the types of defi products that people are interested when they're using their bitcoin are slightly different.
00:41:43.774 - 00:42:30.102, Speaker C: They're not looking for super high yield, they're looking for transparency, security, and they first want to preserve their wealth and then they want to grow it. And so the approach of the sovereign community in terms of the types of products that it's working to build out and that the devs are building, are geared towards that sort of longer term, highly transparent risk. Very clear and easy to use products that I think are based on the same mindset of, I want to hold my bitcoin and grow my bitcoin, or I don't want to ever sell my bitcoin. And those are the things that are important to me.
00:42:30.256 - 00:42:41.038, Speaker B: Got it. And so a place where you can earn interest on bitcoin would be very interesting for this group of people. Right?
00:42:41.124 - 00:43:31.198, Speaker C: Yes. Today you can earn interest on your bitcoin. Right now it's about 3% annualized, no KYC, no gateways. You can maintain your pseudonymity, and you always maintain control of your keys. And there's a number of developments being built now which I think might see the yields there grow higher than that. And people are starting to work on ways that people could adjust, like be willing to take on higher degrees of risk in order to earn more. And so there's a lot of work around creating more choices which will allow people to choose their own adventure when it comes to their financial future.
00:43:31.198 - 00:44:15.440, Speaker C: And I think the overall sense is like there's teams who are in El Salvador who are working to integrate with sovereign. A lot of the teams in Nigeria, there's a lot of effort around integrating this with the day to day lives of people, because that's important in every ecosystem. But I think in bitcoin in particular, it's been very important for this to become a fundamental money, a reserve currency that is available to all people and provide sort of financial security to everyone. And that is very much the approach that sovereign is taking.

00:45:05.490 - 00:45:26.500, Speaker B: Besides sovereign, what are the main DFI applications on bitcoin right now? What does the ecosystem look like? If you can give just an overview of main applications, TVL sovereign is 300 million. What's kind of total TVL on bitcoin right now?
00:45:30.330 - 00:46:24.550, Speaker C: Again, I'm not sure about the TVL, partly because some of these things, it's not really possible to say exactly what the TVL is. So for example, with lightning network it can be difficult to say, and partly because it's not particularly a metric that at least I'm really interested in. So I think in some ways it's the wrong metric, right? I'm much more interested in how much people are transacting because TVL is about people locking up their funds, and a lot of it is rehypothecated. So rehypothecated means that you'll lock up your funds in one place and then you'll basically lock them up in another place. And the way this works in DeFi, as opposed to the financial world, is like you put your money into curve and then you get curve tokens, and you put the curve token somewhere else, and then on the basis of that you get a different token and you put that into a different.
00:46:24.700 - 00:47:03.780, Speaker B: There's different measures of TDL that discount rehypothecation. So there's different metrics. Like some would value pure TDL without rehypothecation at around 200 billion. With that it's 250,000,000,000. So yeah, I think these sites tracking TVL are aware of that happening, but I think it's a good metric to understand how many people are trusting a system to put their money in and deposit for lending, or deposit to put in collateral to take out loans. It's basically what people are doing.
00:47:04.550 - 00:47:04.914, Speaker C: Sure.
00:47:04.952 - 00:47:35.658, Speaker B: But yeah, I wanted to have a comparison with TBL on bitcoin, and I was looking at the blog which tracks tvl on different layer, ones I just couldn't find for bitcoin. So I was wondering if maybe you knew, or if TVL isn't kind of a metric that's looked at on bitcoin, maybe what metric is? Is it like number of users or what's a good way to track this ecosystem?
00:47:35.754 - 00:48:35.630, Speaker C: It's interesting. So the whole sort of smart contract defi ecosystem in bitcoin is quite young, but it's not. I think Phantom is just as young, but I think a lot of the sites that track these things aren't tracking the bitcoin world so much, and I'm not entirely sure why that is. Besides sovereign, there's a project called Babelfish, which has several tens of millions of different stablecoins. It aggregates various stablecoins. There's a system called money on chain, which creates bitcoin backed stablecoins. There's atomic finance, which allows for betting and trading, and is built using a different technological DLCs.
00:48:35.630 - 00:49:25.154, Speaker C: There's obviously lightning network. There's liquid, which are now issuing a billion dollars worth of bonds with the government of El Salvador. There's project called stacks, which has a totally different approach. And it's sort of a bit of a hybrid between bitcoin L2 and its own layer one. And it's got things like Miami coin and city coin. So there's quite a lot of things being built in the bitcoin ecosystem, especially over the last six months, but so far I haven't found very good places to track it. Sergio Lerner, who is a really great bitcoin dev I know is working on a website to track all of these things, but I don't think anyone's built one yet.
00:49:25.272 - 00:49:50.070, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Okay, well, maybe that'll be a job for the defiant terminal. We'll definitely wonder. Yeah, that would be super interesting. Bitcoin metrics. Yeah, for sure. Okay, so there is kind of a lot of development being done on defi bitcoin, and I wanted to ask you about governance.
00:49:50.070 - 00:50:06.718, Speaker B: You mentioned a lot of kind of activity on sovereign has been around governance. Is there like a sovereign token that people are using to vote on different aspects of development or how is it used exactly?
00:50:06.884 - 00:50:33.334, Speaker C: Yes. So there's a token called the SoV token. And the SoV token is the coordination token of the ecosystem and is used to govern. And the way it works is it's designed to encourage and incentivize people to be long term thinkers. And so you can stake Sov, but the longer you stake Sov, the more voting rights you get. Right. So it's a forward looking thing.
00:50:33.334 - 00:51:10.186, Speaker C: Right. The longer you're staked for on a quadratic basis, the more voting power or voting weight you have. And also the more voting weight that you have, the more of the systems, the protocols, revenue that you earn. And so the idea is the people who are staking for the longest periods of time actually have the most or more influence. And so that aligns the incentives of the stakers with the long term benefits of everyone using the protocol, as well as protecting the protocol from short term or flash governance attacks.
00:51:10.378 - 00:51:36.006, Speaker B: That's interesting. I like that mechanism. Very cool. It seems like from a certain point of view, it seemed like in bitcoin it was a bit frowned upon for applications to have their own governance tokens. Is that changing with DeFi on bitcoin?
00:51:36.118 - 00:52:11.814, Speaker C: I think it is changing, yes. So bitcoin culture took a weird turn for a while there, and I think almost became weirdly communist. Right. It became very suspicious of the profit motive. And it's true that there have been a lot of scammy or poor quality projects created with tokens, but there have also been a very large number of extremely innovative projects that would never have existed without tokens. And more importantly, you can't build systems that are borderless. Right.
00:52:11.814 - 00:53:28.106, Speaker C: And that have no company registered in this country or that country unless you're building it in a more decentralized way with tokenized governance. So the, I think the culture is starting to change. There's anyone who's sort of been watching what's been happening in bitcoin recently. There's been a huge pushback against sort of toxic maximalism, and there's been an ongoing change and an ongoing debate where people are starting to recognize that if we want to get to a hyperbitcoinized world, and if we want to build a world of secured property rights around bitcoin, right. If we want to build an economy around bitcoin, that means having more than just bitcoin. It means having projects and companies and stablecoins and assets, and a way of representing many, many different types of property. And that introduces tokenization, as well as representing many, many different types of ways that people can collaborate, like dows, which also introduces tokens.
00:53:28.106 - 00:53:40.740, Speaker C: And so it's still very much a debate within the bitcoin community. But I'm surprised by how much the conversation has changed, especially over the last six months.
00:53:41.110 - 00:54:22.558, Speaker B: It's so interesting because all these things are so kind of like, I give in. And also there's already been many months of development of governance and token experiments and yield farming and dows and NFTs, and all these things happening on Ethereum and bitcoin has been kind of like on the sidelines looking. And it seems like now it's appearing to be more open to accepting that, oh, maybe there is innovation happening outside of bitcoin that we could use. Is that kind of what's happening at.
00:54:22.564 - 00:56:49.550, Speaker C: The, you know, Auroro who wrote know, she's one of the first ever who started working on sovereign, and she wrote a manifesto for sovereign, I think, in August of 2020. And in it, she said, in bitcoin culture, it used to be one of the most powerful memes in bitcoin up until about 2015, was anything that is valuable to bitcoin, bitcoin will adopt, and we don't hear that as often as we used to, but it's making a comeback. And I think the Ethereum and smart contract world has proven immensely valuable in terms of inspiring and creating a whole wave of innovation and doing a lot of the things that even before any of these projects existed, people wanted to build on bitcoin. And I think it's great to see that sort of innovative spirit plus the seriousness with which people treat security and reliability in the bitcoin space being merged to build layers of innovation on top of this extremely unique sort of permaware system, which is bitcoin. So different people talk about different things like, will we be in a multi chain world, or will everything be built on Ethereum? Or will everything be built on bitcoin? And I don't know the answer to that question. But what I think I can say with a great deal of certainty is that over the coming years, we will see sovereign and other projects like it effectively bring the functionality to build anything you want on bitcoin and secure it with bitcoin. And I think for a certain set of use cases, especially those like financial use cases where people have long term horizons, it's going to make a lot of sense to build those on bitcoin.
00:56:50.450 - 00:57:31.440, Speaker A: Echi is a DeFi protocol that empowers other crypto projects, like one inch uniswap, Shapeshift, Filecoin, fuse network, dodo, and others with community controlled DFI capabilities. Thanks to Echi's groundbreaking DFI 20 protocols, crypto projects can finally keep revenue from stablecoins and liquidity programs. ET enables crypto projects to create a sustainable economy that attracts users and keeps value locked in their communities. Learn more@et.org edan believes that bitcoin is the primary blockchain for preserving value. But is there a single chain of truth within this space, or is a multichain future possible?
00:57:32.290 - 00:59:04.006, Speaker C: I suspect that you will be able to build any use case on bitcoin. And one of the reasons is, if you look at ultimately, what is the big limitation? The big limitation is, can we add scalability and can we add certain features? Right? So if you think about what zero knowledge proofs can do, like, for example, with roll ups, they effectively allow you to add any type of computational activity with extreme scale to any system to which you can roll up. And you can roll up to Solana, you can roll up to Ethereum, you can roll up to BSC, you can roll up to bitcoin. And so I think the technological differences between these different systems is going to be extremely minimal. They're not going to have unique properties from a technological perspective, because ultimately, most of the computational work is going to be done off chain in these sort of roll up environments. And then the real differentiator becomes sort of accessibility, the network effect of the assets that are associated with them, and the rule set and reliability of that rule set. And so I think when you look at the space, you can call a roll up a chain.
00:59:04.006 - 00:59:25.822, Speaker C: And in that respect, we're definitely going to live in a multichain universe, right? But what those chains roll up to is you'll be able to do anything anywhere. But where you choose to do it, I think, will depend more on the secondary aspects of network effects and the security assurances you receive.
00:59:25.966 - 00:59:59.370, Speaker B: Okay. What's missing for DeFi and bitcoin to really take off is to have these scaling platforms, like zero knowledge proofs, roll ups that bitcoin or not bitcoin specific, but DeFi applications will be able to use. And then where those applications are finally kind of deployed or confirmed, you believe will ultimately most will do it on the bitcoin chain.
01:00:01.890 - 01:01:19.586, Speaker C: So I don't know if I believe that specifically. What I would say is that if I had to guess, I think it's more likely to be on the bitcoin network than any other network. And I also think that it's more likely to be one dominant network and several smaller networks rather than a very large number of networks. So I do think that there's a very high likelihood that what happens is that we see a consolidation, and that when that consolidation happens, it will happen around bitcoin. Part of the reason for this is actually because of bitcoin's use of proof of work and the fact that the bitcoin asset is not an asset which is tied to use as sort of like a utility token. Right? So if you think about ETH or Sol or Avax, these are very important utility tokens. They're essential to be able to use the chain on which you're operating for the purpose of proprocessing smart contracts.
01:01:19.586 - 01:02:29.980, Speaker C: Right. But there's a bit of a problem there, because all of these different systems right now are in a competitive race to reduce fees, and I think they will succeed. And so what will happen is that the cost of using these systems is going to drop a great deal, and that's going to impact the potential security of these systems, because proof of stake systems effectively make money on the basis of collecting the fees of these transactions. And so when you drop the fees, you're dropping the amount of fees that can be collected, and ultimately you drop the security of the system. Whereas bitcoin, because of its proof of work system based around having this sort of digital gold asset, is actually less impacted. It could continue to exist even if it didn't have these smart contracts. So I think looking five years out, we may find that proof of stake systems, especially for smart contract platforms, actually start to see diminishing security assurances, especially as they compete amongst themselves.
01:02:29.980 - 01:02:37.742, Speaker C: And that may prove to be a real problem. But I can't tell the future. This is just one potential risk that I see.
01:02:37.876 - 01:03:10.582, Speaker B: Interesting. I understand that proof of stake systems secure the network with the amount of value at stake. Like not necessarily about how high fees are, but with how much value the different validators are staking to the network. So if that's the case, maybe having lower fees doesn't compromise security. But I don't know, that's kind of my understanding of it.
01:03:10.636 - 01:03:31.994, Speaker C: Yeah, no, you're totally right. The thing is that the incentive for staking is how much fees are captured. And you can basically capture fees in one of two ways. You can either capture fees in the form of transaction fees, and if you're constantly reducing those, then you're reducing the amount of value that can be captured, and then you're reducing the incentive to stake, because when you stake, you give up liquidity.
01:03:32.042 - 01:03:32.640, Speaker B: Right.
01:03:33.010 - 01:04:20.826, Speaker C: But there's another option, and this actually might prove to be more useful, but in some ways is more dangerous. Right. The other place that you can capture fees as a staker and as a validator is through MEV, right. Minor extractable value. And I could see a future where Ethereum or Solana or any of these systems, they have a lot of activity on them, and that activity drives a lot of MeV. And then it becomes very profitable to be a validator and effectively capture that kind of mev. But we know that Mev has, if it goes down that route, basically there are three routes.
01:04:20.826 - 01:04:50.742, Speaker C: It could be that these assets, the situation that we currently have of this race to the bottom of fees doesn't continue for whatever reason, and then the proof of stake system will work. There's the situation where the transaction fees are in a race to the bottom and then the security is diminished, or there's a situation where the security isn't diminished, but it's primarily because it's being subsidized by MeV. And so I think those are the three potential outcomes.
01:04:50.886 - 01:06:06.100, Speaker B: I mean, on this subject, if you have a couple more minutes, I wanted to ask you. Yeah, sorry for running a bit long, but since we're on the subject, there's this criticism that I see related to this about bitcoin that I'd love to get your take, which is bitcoin has this famous 21 million hard cap of the amount of bitcoin that will ever be in circulation. And so when that is met, where does security come from? Does it come from very high fees that will go to miners? And if that's the case, does the network become less attractive for users? It seems like for all its emphasis on sound money. The fact that this incentive for nodes to secure the network, the fact that this ends at 21 million, doesn't seem very reassuring. So what's kind of the plan there?
01:06:06.470 - 01:07:02.020, Speaker C: Well, I think that's a very good question, and unfortunately, I don't think it's a question which receives enough debate in the bitcoin community as well. My answer to this is it's possible, again here, if I was talking about proof of stake, there are three possible outcomes here. I think that there's two possible outcomes. One outcome is that the fees that are collected actually do go down over time, and so the system becomes less secure. Right. Or at least has a less significant security budget. The other outcome is that the fees on bitcoin layer one become quite expensive, in fact, very expensive, significantly more expensive than they are today.
01:07:02.020 - 01:07:29.946, Speaker C: That would secure the network. And I think that that's a good outcome. I think that's the outcome that we want. Right. Because users will not be paying those fees. Those will be high value settlement payments, and they will effectively be an aggregation of all of the other activity that is occurring on L2. And so I suspect that we will get to a point where the fees are quite high.
01:07:29.946 - 01:08:27.770, Speaker C: Now, coming back to the first scenario, right, where the fees aren't high enough, it's not clear to me how much of a danger that is, because if the fees aren't high enough, the only reason that would be happening is because there isn't actually that much use of the bitcoin network. Right. If there isn't that much use of the bitcoin network, then we've actually failed before the security issue became a problem. Right. We failed because there wasn't enough adoption to drive the security demand. So I think the real question is, do we see bitcoin usage not so much in layer one, but really on L2 scale to the point that when you aggregate and settle those L2 transactions into layer one, it's a huge amount of activity which is able to support the high fees. That's basically the question when it comes to bitcoin.
01:08:27.930 - 01:08:52.310, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. Yeah. So it's basically kind of what I read before. The expectation is if there's usage on bitcoin, the way to continue securing the network will be with much, much higher fees than what we are seeing today. Yeah, makes sense. Okay.
01:08:52.310 - 01:09:24.798, Speaker B: And then to wrap up, just very practically, for those listening who want to start experimenting in bitcoin, DeFi, what steps do you recommend? What noncosudal wallets should people download? How to start gaining interest on bitcoin on sovereign or what other applications do you think a newbie should look at?
01:09:24.964 - 01:10:01.210, Speaker C: So with sovereign you can connect your treasure or your ledger directly to the system. And that is the most secure way to deal with a system. Right. So we strongly encourage people to use hardware wallets, but you can also use things that maybe you're more familiar with, like metamask or web3 mobile wallets. So basically any web3 wallet will work with sovereign as well. And then if you're interested in learning about it, a good place to start is the website. So sovereignsovryn app.
01:10:01.210 - 01:10:25.098, Speaker C: But the best place to get into conversations, especially technical conversations, is either the forum or the sovereign discord. So if you go to the website and you click through to the sovereign discord, it's a very active community and quite transparent. So you can see the conversations that are occurring between the developers and what they're working on and ask questions and get involved.
01:10:25.294 - 01:10:56.990, Speaker B: Very cool. Awesome. Ian, this has been such an interesting conversation. Like I said, you're probably the first bitcoin developer on the defiant podcast. So it's great to start learning more about this ecosystem. I think it's a really interesting approach. I think my take on bitcoin and Defi has been that bitcoin is great as digital gold.
01:10:56.990 - 01:11:47.678, Speaker B: Ethereum is very well suited to be a platform for more sophisticated financial applications. But if there can be smart contracts on bitcoin and that L2 ecosystem developing, I think it's really interesting to kind of track and experiment. I think you're right. A lot of people come to crypto through bitcoin and I think there should be a lot of interest to start kind of putting that bitcoin to work directly on bitcoin and not kind of having to wrap it and add kind of a bit of layers of risk to those transactions.
