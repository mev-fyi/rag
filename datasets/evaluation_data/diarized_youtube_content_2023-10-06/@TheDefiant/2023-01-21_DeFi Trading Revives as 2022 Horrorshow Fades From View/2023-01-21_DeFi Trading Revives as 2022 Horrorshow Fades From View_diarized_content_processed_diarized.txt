00:00:21.690 - 00:00:58.640, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Happy Friday. I'm Eddie Robinson, contributing editor at the Defiant. Welcome to another weekly recap of Defi News. This week I'm joined by the indomitable Alex Gilbert and the intrepid Owen Fernau, both of whom did superb work this week. We're going to be unpacking some of those stories in the next hour. It's really fascinating to see how DFI trading revived this week as the 2022 horror show kind of fades from view.
00:00:58.640 - 00:01:45.150, Speaker A: And we had all sorts of action popping with perpetual futures and LSDs picking up. We had game makers shaking up the NFT royalty space with a new smart contract offering. We had Defi and Tradfi coming together and becoming a major theme. I'll be reporting a little bit on that from a conference I covered last week in Switzerland. And we also had still some legal fallout from some of the failures last week. Specifically. We'll take a look at what the genesis bankruptcy means going forward, but I'd like to open this week, if I may, with Alex.
00:01:45.150 - 00:02:09.670, Speaker A: You did a pair of stories today on Fracs, which is a really fascinating stablecoin ecosystem that's under development, and I was really struck by a few different factors in this story, but why don't you kind of walk us through your interview with the co founder and CEO?
00:02:12.410 - 00:02:55.922, Speaker B: Sure. Well, I guess the first thing I'd say is that he might quibble with the term CEO because he's big on the fact that Frax is very much a daO. It's run by the token holders. Nevertheless, we spoke at the beginning of the month, and when we spoke, I didn't realize that Fracs would. I mean, Fracs had been doing well, right? I tried to arrange this interview when I saw that despite the wreckage from know, you're looking at the whole, like, the chart of all the DeFi protocols, and one of the only ones that was in the green was fracs. And it was slowly inching up the TVL chart. Right.
00:02:55.976 - 00:02:57.860, Speaker A: So that jumped out at.
00:02:58.950 - 00:03:37.102, Speaker B: Yeah, um, and it was just inching up the charts. Money was pouring into it because it had recently launched a whole suite of applications. Right. Fracs started out as just a stablecoin, a fractional, algorithmic stablecoin, hence frax. But now it has its own dex, its own lending arm, its own lending protocol, liquid staking protocol. So it's kind of grown into every nook and cranny of defi, and I wanted to know why. So I spoke to Sam Kazamian.
00:03:37.102 - 00:03:55.110, Speaker B: I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. And he's telling me that his obsession is stablecoins, that this is all about the stablecoin. At the end of the day, the decks, the lending, the liquid staking, it's about creating an ecosystem to support fracs. The stablecoin.
00:03:57.390 - 00:04:26.980, Speaker A: What is the ticker for the stablecoin? Just so our viewers. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And one thing that jumped out at me in your story was that it's kind of partially and, and again, this kind of know the shadow of terra and Luna. And you addressed that bit in your story. Just talk about that.
00:04:26.980 - 00:04:27.986, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:28.008 - 00:04:54.566, Speaker B: So Sam didn't shy away from talking about this. He did shy away from the term somewhat. Right, so. So it's called fract because it is, or was fractionally algorithmic. But the thing to know with stablecoins is that each token is backed by something. And now it can either be, in the case of USDC or tether, just dollars or something similar. But then there are the more decentralized alternatives, the most popular being dAi.
00:04:54.566 - 00:05:35.270, Speaker B: For Makerdao, there's LUSD. There are other stablecoins that aren't necessarily pegged to anything, and those are often backed by crypto assets. Maker is moving more and more toward a really interesting basket of real world assets. But for those where the underlying collateral is more volatile than dollars itself, they're typically over collateralized. Right. So the value of the assets that back die, for example, is worth, if I'm not mistaken, 120% of the die itself. So if the shares in Tesla, or whatever it is that partially backs dye, drop that, you'll still be able to redeem each token.
00:05:35.270 - 00:05:50.302, Speaker B: So the plan is to move fracs toward 100% collateral ratio so that the assets that back it are worth exactly the amount of the fracs in circulation right now, that's not the case.
00:05:50.356 - 00:05:50.606, Speaker C: Right now.
00:05:50.628 - 00:05:53.840, Speaker B: It's more like 92 or 93%.
00:05:54.530 - 00:05:55.280, Speaker C: Okay.
00:05:57.570 - 00:06:21.240, Speaker B: That'S where the algorithmic comes in. Right. Because the remaining percent is backed by Frac's own governance token and a mechanism there that's meant to kind of stabilize and hold a peg. Sam acknowledges that this gives people the heebie GB, hence trying slowly to move toward that 100% collateral ratio, which for some, might still be a little bit too low.
00:06:21.690 - 00:06:26.440, Speaker A: Yeah, there would be some concern there.
00:06:28.650 - 00:06:47.680, Speaker C: Sorry. Just like it is interesting. I don't 100% have a pulse on fracs by any means, but considering, I'm sure people would have taken a big, long look at whether they could break the stablecoin's peg. And given what happened with Luna and it hasn't happened yet.
00:06:49.250 - 00:06:52.000, Speaker B: They've held the peg super well.
00:06:54.390 - 00:07:02.580, Speaker A: Governance token has tripled. So you've got investors clearly have kicked the tires and, like, what they see so far. Right?
00:07:03.670 - 00:07:40.094, Speaker B: Right. So money is pouring into all of these new, I guess, subsidiary protocols. People are buying the governance token for folks who are really into crypto. Twitter influencer Adam Cochrane put out a 300 tweet thread on tokens to watch this year. Frax was one of them. It's off to a super hot start in 2023. It'll be really interesting to see how that peg continues to hold.
00:07:40.094 - 00:07:44.110, Speaker B: At the end of the day, it's all about that peg of holding.
00:07:45.030 - 00:08:13.146, Speaker A: Yeah. Now, you also wrote a news story in conjunction with this one, which was about Frax's poised to roll out a, quote, compliant stablecoin which may or may not be affected by what happens on Capitol Hill. Alex, just kind of walk us through what this means and the significance of this compliant stablecoin. Yeah.
00:08:13.168 - 00:09:37.400, Speaker B: So something that Sam has spoken about before, prior to my interview with him, is the idea that the very safest asset that you can have backing a stablecoin would be actual dollars at a Federal Reserve master account, earning yield directly from the interest rates the Federal Reserve sets. As it stands, stablecoin issuers, crypto companies can't open accounts at the Federal Reserve's regional banks, of which there are twelve. Late last year, former Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey introduced a bill that would have made that possible. Sam is really hoping that this moves forward this year so that Fracs could take advantage of that. In the event that it doesn't, he sees another path toward opening a master account, and that would be creating a compliant so one that, like USDC, is centralized, has a blacklist feature, is issued by an actual company, not a dow, not a protocol, and using that in turn to back frax, the stablecoin that exists on chain, in his words, this would be tokenizing the deposits at a FedMaster account.
00:09:38.410 - 00:10:18.340, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really interesting. I mean, when you think about how this is Defi. And yet it would kind of work in conjunction with the Federal Reserve and with utilizing a service that's been one of the pillars of the US banking system for so long, I mean, that's a development that's rather freighted with irony, but it doesn't seem like Kazemian. He really cares about any of those kinds of concerns. The takeaway I got from reading your stories was that he's all about business, this guy.
00:10:20.790 - 00:11:06.660, Speaker B: Yes and no. So something that he had mentioned when we spoke is how Frax specifically didn't go out seeking VC money. Right. That it very much operates as a DaO, that he's still wedded to the ideals of decentralization and isn't looking for kind of short term solutions that would create a kind of incentive mismatch that would kind of pull fracs away from the idea of decentralized on chain money. But I guess he's not too starry eyed about how to go about doing that. Right? He is about business.
00:11:07.430 - 00:11:07.794, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:07.832 - 00:11:09.410, Speaker A: There's a kind of pragmatism.
00:11:11.030 - 00:11:14.100, Speaker B: Exactly. Pragmatism. That's the word that I was looking for. Thank you.
00:11:18.170 - 00:11:37.020, Speaker A: Feel free to jump in here. Sure. If you had to boil down distinctions between fracs and, say, other stablecoin ecosystem buildouts, what would you highlight? What really makes fracs different from some of the other ecosystems that are trying to do the same?
00:11:42.270 - 00:11:47.600, Speaker C: Alex? Yeah, you're probably better positioned to answer than I'm not. Go ahead.
00:11:50.530 - 00:12:41.066, Speaker B: And something that I mentioned in the other story is that Kasamian is seeing a kind of vindication of his view that to create a successful stablecoin, you need this whole infrastructure around. You know, Frac started with the stablecoin and now is launching these other products. Abe started with a lending protocol, but is about to launch its own stablecoin curve. Started with a decentralized exchange, but is about to launch its own stable. He's. The term he used that I liked was financial natural selection, where they're all realizing that this is something that they should be pursuing now. I exchanged a couple of messages with Ryan Watkins.
00:12:41.066 - 00:13:17.740, Speaker B: He's a former Missari analyst, and he agrees that this is something that is happening. But whether that effort from these different protocols bears fruit remains to be seen. His point is that when you have open, permissionless technology, companies that are building everything can spread themselves too thin. And why would you go to, say, Frax's lending protocol when maybe there's one that's a little bit, you know, you're never locked in like you are in.
00:13:19.630 - 00:14:18.638, Speaker C: I mean, Alex, you had said that on a print call, and I was reading redacted, which is kind of like a meta governance project, which you covered last year, and they also had plans to release one. And I was talking to even the guys from centrifuge about both Ave's impending stablecoin and also other. The key kind of hinted that other projects were also going to be launching stablecoins backed by real world assets. So building on that point, and I've seen Sam say that, I forget what he was like. There's bitcoin, the reserve, there's like the smart contract layer, vertical, and then he thinks of stablecoins as like the third layer. So it is very interesting to see all these projects kind of, I don't know, kind of gravitate towards these stable coins. And I think there are even other projects looking to enable this.
00:14:18.638 - 00:14:51.322, Speaker C: Project reserve protocol is looking to almost enable a lot of different kind of almost stablecoin esque currencies to emerge. It's interesting, and I still don't have a great intuition about where the money is coming from. Essentially what the true business advantages of launching a stablecoin, I don't totally understand, but it's definitely a trend that people are gravitating towards.
00:14:51.456 - 00:15:57.840, Speaker A: It almost strikes me there's a few different ways to skin the cat here. And you either start with the exchange piece, or you start with the stablecoin piece, or another piece, the lending piece or whatnot, but they're all kind of headed toward the same destination. And again, if you think of these as kind of new forms of banks, really, then banks need a few different ingredients. And so what these guys are doing is putting together not necessarily a conglomerate, but they're putting together a defi version of a bank. And in that bank, though, you need to have the free flow of liquidity to actually make all of the pieces work and mesh. And so it's just fascinating that each of these project founders has begun in a different part of the ecosystem, but again, they're kind of headed toward the same. Just, I just think that in terms of pure business model formation is really.
00:15:59.730 - 00:16:04.400, Speaker C: I mean, Ondo launched a lending protocol, like two days after it launched those.
00:16:06.450 - 00:16:10.302, Speaker A: Mean securities, those tokenized versions of the ETFs that you reported.
00:16:10.366 - 00:16:25.110, Speaker C: Yeah, because they're trying to make permissioned protocols which will allow. It wasn't accredited investors, but it was a related term to borrow against those tokenized securities.
00:16:28.110 - 00:17:30.960, Speaker A: That's a nice segue to your story. Published today. Centrifuge quietly sets pace in real world assets race. This was a really nice piece, and I think one that defiers are really going to love, just like the frax pieces, because, and I really like the way you open this piece, Owen, where you put it on the blockchain. I mean, that is like the mother of all cliches in yet, you know, Lucas Vogelsong, who's the co founder of Centrifuge, is like, well, yeah, that's, that's what we're going to be doing. And he's really stolen a march on real world assets, which we know is emerging as a big defi story this year. Just kind of walk us through your interview with Lucas and why centrifuge, the action that it's doing, why that's so significant and important.
00:17:31.570 - 00:18:00.950, Speaker C: Sure. So, yeah, I met with Lucas yesterday, as well as his colleague Assad Khan, and basically they caught my eye as a project which is enabling these real world assets to come on chain. And as I said, I don't think it's quite hyped yet, but there's a lot of excitement.
00:18:01.370 - 00:18:08.454, Speaker A: Just remind our viewers what that means. What does it mean to put real world assets on chain? What is a real world asset?
00:18:08.582 - 00:18:46.478, Speaker C: Yeah, all these words, it's slippery because they kind of tend to generalize and morph about what they mean. But I would say that it's basically you're representing something which isn't natively crypto, which isn't natively on a blockchain I Ethereum or some token, and you are representing it on the blockchain as something which has real value. So that could be a mortgage, like, you could have a mortgage and tokenize that, and that's real world or car payment, or obviously, like stocks and bonds.
00:18:46.574 - 00:18:47.650, Speaker A: Stocks and bonds.
00:18:53.610 - 00:20:02.462, Speaker C: To cut to what I think centrifuge is doing, uniquely, which I realized talking to Lucas, was that centrifuge is aiming to capture all these essentially kind of debt agreements of all these small and medium sized businesses and securitize them and put them on the chain, batch them together in these pools, which then people can. From my under. I mean, it gets gnarly complicated, but then people can essentially buy that credit. So there can be a marketplace for all that credit. And his main point is that all these big companies are able to access these liquid bond markets and get financing really quickly, but all these small and medium sized businesses aren't. So they're really trying to put all this on the blockchain, put all these credit opportunities out and amalgamate them. So that will, in his mind, bring down the cost of capital to maybe levels of large.
00:20:02.516 - 00:20:49.110, Speaker A: Yeah, that's why I really found this interesting. So what he's doing is kind of applying a tried and true business, a practice on Wall street, which is asset backed securities, pooling different loans together to minimize risk and create more reward for potential investors. So Wall street has been pooling credit card debt, asset backed securities. They've been pooling car loans, they've been pooling mortgages. We know what happened when they started pooling subprime mortgages and slicing and dicing in all different ways back before the crash in 2008. But this is a tried and true practice in tradfi. And so what Lucas is doing that's quite clever, is that he's saying we can do the same thing on chain.
00:20:49.110 - 00:20:56.494, Speaker A: And by targeting SMEs, small and medium sized enterprises, he's going after an underserved market.
00:20:56.692 - 00:20:57.198, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:57.284 - 00:21:04.094, Speaker A: And of course, with small and medium sized businesses, lending risk will be far greater.
00:21:04.222 - 00:21:04.900, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:05.510 - 00:21:41.338, Speaker A: And it's harder to manage because the credits themselves are smaller, so there's more actual individual loans that have to be managed. So that's another consideration. But essentially, it seems like his theory is like, if I can pool SME credits together, put them on chain as a singular vehicle, then in some way that will create credit opportunities for borrowers and certainly investment opportunities for credit investors.
00:21:41.514 - 00:22:16.258, Speaker C: Yeah. I think the idea is that these markets are very fractured. They're private. Right. I can't buy some of these credit opportunities, but he's saying that if you're able to group them together, you'll bring down the cost of capital for all these SMEs and create new investment opportunities, and everyone wins. And they see that as a huge value add. I thought they kind of contrasted that with what Ondo did or these other ideas where you're just representing securities.
00:22:16.354 - 00:22:50.114, Speaker A: Yeah. They're playing in a different part of the market. I mean, playing with SME credit is pretty wild. Tell us about this deal that you report on in your story. You report on a $220,000,000 deal that centrifuge did with maker, which, of course, is the DFI OG that kind of sets the pace in so much of the sector. And Blocktower Capital, which is a crypto oriented hedge fund. Unpack that deal for us in this diagram, which I guess comes from the maker form.
00:22:50.312 - 00:23:23.440, Speaker C: Yeah, I was hoping you wouldn't ask me to do that. All right. Honestly, I'm going to send them a follow up email, because I think this is. I was crawling through the maker forums last night and realizing how complicated this deal is, but my high level understanding is that Blocktower credit is sourcing these.
00:23:24.530 - 00:23:25.834, Speaker A: They're bringing the loans.
00:23:25.962 - 00:23:47.510, Speaker C: Yeah, they're bringing in the loans. Exactly. And they're batching them, and then they're depositing them. And then Maker has agreed to create vaults, which are essentially what people. I don't know, the metaphor is pretty good. Which are data structures, I guess, I would say, which hold capital against which Dai can be borrowed.
00:23:48.970 - 00:23:55.730, Speaker A: So the loans are collateralizing the DAi, you're basically converting the value of the loans into Dai. And Dai is highly portable.
00:23:55.890 - 00:24:19.006, Speaker C: Yeah. And that's kind of where my understanding breaks down, because I think both maker and Blocktower are contributing capital to these vaults or to these deals. And I don't understand exactly where the money is flowing and I don't understand.
00:24:19.188 - 00:25:06.670, Speaker A: All right, now we know the first story to assign you next week when we start, is doing fault. But don't feel bad. You are now swimming in the waters of structured finance. And structured finance is one of the greatest causes of brain damage when it comes to this entire sector. So the fact that you're now compounding the complexity of structured finance with stablecoins and cryptocurrency and tokenization, well, it's a scary place. And that's why I said you were intrepid, because you have dared to delve into it and have survived to tell most of the tale. So we'll look forward to how you follow on this.
00:25:06.670 - 00:25:15.730, Speaker A: But the upshot, I mean, give us the upshot here of centrifuge and what it's why, why is this important for defiers to clock.
00:25:17.590 - 00:26:04.180, Speaker C: Mean? And Alex touched on it too, is that it seems like there's a meta theme of these people who are willing to play in permissioned finance and willing to play with regulators and powerful institutions are making inroads. And I would say that's like the highest level theme is that I don't know if it's the bear market and people are getting desperate or this was always what was going to happen, but inevitably, because centrifuge use is also, in order to invest in these credit opportunities, you have to go through KYC and AML. And so, you know, by definition that's permissioned. So I'm not sure how maker has gone through that, but I think maker has had to do something in order to expose themselves.
00:26:05.430 - 00:26:46.878, Speaker A: Your interview with Assad Khan, I mean, he highlights that and he's trying to essentially make the argument that a level of regulation in DeFi is not necessarily negative. And he makes this really interesting line, which is, look, the world is growing up a little bit. It's accepting more stuff coming on chain and in a legally regulated, compliant way. And the advantage there is, this is what institutions want. And for DeFi, protocols that need capital, that want capital, institutions are a ready source to tap. But everything's got to be cool. I mean, everything has got to be above board.
00:26:46.878 - 00:27:11.590, Speaker A: You got a Kyc, you got an AML, you got to do all that stuff. And clearly Assad and the rest of the team, Lucas and everyone as a centrifuge, have made their piece with this and said this is too big an opportunity to not pursue just because we don't want to go through the rigor morole of Kycaml, et cetera.
00:27:15.050 - 00:27:42.502, Speaker C: It's like if all these securities and trying to find. I mean, he said, he was like, yeah, he felt like some of the big shot financiers and you saw this in Switzerland, they're open to the idea that everything will be tokenized. But it's like with that is going to come regulation and things which are absolutely securities. I mean, they're things which are. We debate whether Ethereum is a security, but there are things which are certainly. And if you want that on chain.
00:27:42.666 - 00:28:18.086, Speaker A: It'Ll have to adhere to. Well, reading your story, which, again, kudos, is really well reported, reading your story reminded me of something that I heard last week at St. Maritz. So I covered the CFC St. Maritz cryptocurrency conference. It's in the Swiss Alps, really posh ski area place. The hotel actually reminded me a little of the one in the shining, which was a little eerie.
00:28:18.086 - 00:28:55.106, Speaker A: But anyways. And it was kind of odd to see all of these crypto folk in such a traditional. You're talking about Switzerland. This is the home of swiss banking and tradition, and yet they took over this hotel. But one of the things that really leapt out at me and your story reminded me of was a line that Christine Moy is a. She's the head of digital assets at Apollo Global Management. Apollo Global Management is a huge private equity firm.
00:28:55.106 - 00:29:44.230, Speaker A: I believe it has around 50 billion, excuse me, $500 billion in assets, and they run a massive yield business. They know credit like nobody's business. And when we were talking about Defi, she used the phrase tech rails to automate capital deployment. That's not a bad mean. Essentially, what she's kind of talking about is just like back office stuff, automation just, again, rails. But it dovetails with what your reporting showed, both of your reporting showed, in terms of tokenization and just getting traditional assets on chain so you can do all of these different things with it. And that's a massive infrastructure play for a lot of traditional investors.
00:29:44.230 - 00:30:45.866, Speaker A: So when you cut away the madness of FTX, the skullduggery of Celsius, the insanity of three arrows, and the utter, unhinged, almost James Bond villain like behavior that we saw in terra Luna, when you cut all of that away and you just get down to brass, tax, and deFi, software, like what the technology does, that's the investment opportunity that a lot of very sophisticated investors are looking at right now. And in a way, it's almost like what SBF did. It doesn't matter. Yeah, because they're not buying tokens and trading tokens, these investors, they're investing in rails for capital deployment. And I think that's what your guys are on to. They're kind of like, doing both. They're playing the asset side as well as the infrastructure side.
00:30:45.866 - 00:31:10.642, Speaker A: But that, to me, is going to be a very important theme in Defi going forward this year. But a lot of Defi folk are going to have to get comfortable with the suits. And that was kind of my big takeaway from this. There's the hotel. See, that kind of looks like the one in the shining, doesn't it? What was it?
00:31:10.696 - 00:31:17.030, Speaker B: The overlook, maybe a glass half full interpretation. Grand Budapest Hotel.
00:31:17.370 - 00:31:20.840, Speaker A: Grand Budapest Hotel. Yeah, I thought of that, too, a little bit.
00:31:22.970 - 00:31:26.966, Speaker B: It's the shining when it's empty. It's Grand Budapest Hotel when there are.
00:31:27.148 - 00:32:04.034, Speaker A: Some people in it. It's the shining when a guy with an axe is chasing you through a maze. Grand Budapest when you're sitting in the spa. Yeah. So, anyways, that was kind of my takeaway from this confab. I mean, there isn't too much to report from this, other than CZ was holding court there. It was kind of fun to see him mingling, and a lot of the conferees were actually wondering why CZ would deign to materialize at a conference and do this.
00:32:04.034 - 00:33:03.270, Speaker A: But I think he's probably pretty choosy about where he appears. And it didn't hurt for him to show up at such a fraught moment, for him to show up and just reassure a lot of very influential crypto folk that everything's cool, we're not going to blow up. His message was kind of like, we're going to do what we need to do on the regulatory side, but we're not going to change our structure, we're not going to change our model. We're still going to be in dozens of countries. Our headquarters doesn't really exist. I mean, all of that kind of edgy stuff. He seemed to be quite committed to maintaining his model, but at the same time, I think he definitely sounded a note of, we're not going to be reckless.
00:33:03.270 - 00:33:23.086, Speaker A: He's seen the wreckage, and he seemed to be trying to convey this message of, we're cool, we're strong, we're sound, we're doing everything right. But we'll see. I mean, the proof of reserves issue is still going to be a big one this year.
00:33:23.268 - 00:33:38.900, Speaker C: And they boned up on lawyers. I wrote an article earlier or they just like hired, I don't know. But it was a noteworthy amount of lawyers in the past like two years. They really built out a legal team. I think at least that's what they.
00:33:39.670 - 00:34:13.390, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I wasn't aware until I started digging into it. I kind of missed this. But did you guys know Binance introduced an advisory board last fall? It's not a board of directors, so it's just a sounding mean. Typically companies like to name these just to kind of show regulators that we've got some adults in the room with us. But it's led know a former Max Balkus who is a very influential senator once upon a time from Montana. He's now retired, but also David Plough is on there as well.
00:34:13.390 - 00:34:33.700, Speaker A: David Plough was the political strategist behind Obama's 2008 presidential campaign and then served in the White House as a top aide to Obama. I mean, he's a serious dude and he's on finance's advisory board. I just, parenthetically, I just thought that was kind of interesting.
00:34:34.470 - 00:34:48.860, Speaker C: Well, I think that's in line with their acquisition of lawyers or bringing a lot of lawyers on board. I mean, I think they are boning up and figuring out how to be an enduring organization that plays ball with everyone.
00:34:49.310 - 00:35:24.690, Speaker A: That's a good observation. I wanted to turn back to the markets when you did this story. LSDs gather mojo. Is Eulerless staked ETH as collateral? Sure. This is good hardcore defiant content. I really dig it because it's getting down to brass tax and I'm really delighted that you rolled up your sleeves and went in and reported this. I think it's really valuable for our readers to kind of see this, but take us through this a little bit.
00:35:24.690 - 00:35:32.386, Speaker A: First, what is Euler? And second, why is listing staked ETH as collateral? Why is that significant?
00:35:32.578 - 00:36:07.058, Speaker C: Sure. I mean this was a story that's yet another step along road of accepting liquid staking. Derivatives like Ave has accepted St E for a long time as collateral. I think maker has a vault which accepts St ETH, which for those who don't know is another form of staked. It's another token which represents staked Ethereum. So it accrues yield while you deposit it and borrow against it.
00:36:07.224 - 00:36:10.370, Speaker A: And this has become very important post merge.
00:36:10.870 - 00:37:26.906, Speaker C: Yes, it's important before, even more kind of potent afterwards. I think the biggest amount of deposited assets in Ave is a form of stake to eat another. I think the big thing is that no major staking protocol has accepted this form, or no major lending protocol has accepted this form of staked ETH. And so Euler, at a very top level, works in the same way of compound as you deposit and borrow against your assets. It's an over collateralized lending protocol. And so they made the move to accept CBE, which is Coinbase's version of liquid staked mean. I asked Seraphim, who is the head of risk at Euler, and I was like, why haven't anyone else allowed people to borrow against CBE, Coinbase's version of staked Ethereum? And honestly, he said, I don't know, because he had talked to people, crypto hedge funds and prop trading firms, and said that, yeah, there's a bunch of demand to deposit that, and then you can borrow against it.
00:37:26.906 - 00:37:51.940, Speaker C: I mean, the simplest trade, which he outlined was just like, you can deposit CBE, borrow against it, trade back into CBE. I think you can just borrow CBE against CBE, and then redeposit that. So then you're kind of just rolling your staking rewards. That's kind of the high level take.
00:37:53.910 - 00:38:35.166, Speaker A: The upshot here is that staking has become just a huge activity, a huge source of investment gains for people in DeFi. And I would dare say that it's kind of reshaping the whole defi proposition. And that's why we've seen a flurry of why. That's why the defiant has been reporting on a flurry of action in this space. Because it seems like every week now, there's just a lot more critical mass building in the staking mean here we see this story right here. Perpetuals action soars as volatility. Stokes trading.
00:38:35.166 - 00:38:46.754, Speaker A: This is kind of similar. Let's just go to this one. Owen, you were on this one too. With all the reporting you did this week, you could have started a crypto hedge fund by now.
00:38:46.872 - 00:38:49.106, Speaker C: You realize that I asked that.
00:38:49.128 - 00:38:49.266, Speaker A: Why?
00:38:49.288 - 00:38:50.550, Speaker C: I'm not doing that every day, man.
00:38:50.620 - 00:38:53.750, Speaker A: I mean, by Monday, you could have a crypto hedge fund up and running. Christ.
00:38:53.820 - 00:38:59.340, Speaker C: All right. Oh, come on. No, I'm bringing you guys on, man. I can't do it all myself.
00:39:01.390 - 00:39:28.420, Speaker A: But as you point out, I mean, perpetual futures have been with us for a long, long time. I remember when Bitmex pioneered the perpetual futures. Of course, we saw what SBF and his gang did with perpetuals at FTX. Okay, but the product still is pumping, and that's what you pointed out here. What's going on?
00:39:28.790 - 00:39:49.590, Speaker C: Yeah, again, high level synthetics operates kind of like maker, except you borrow a bunch of assets which are called synthetic. So you can borrow synthetic ETH against your SNX and trade a lot of other synthetic synthetics, bitcoin, blah, blah, blah.
00:39:50.110 - 00:40:19.202, Speaker A: All synthetic means. Sorry to interrupt you, but all synthetic means is that the product that's trading is a proxy for the underlying one. In tradfi, we see this with derivatives, so you can buy gold ETFs. There's no gold there. They don't represent actual gold. There's no gold in a vault that's like backing. It's just a synthetic version of what gold futures are actually doing.
00:40:19.202 - 00:40:21.650, Speaker A: So this is analogous to that.
00:40:21.800 - 00:40:37.810, Speaker C: Yeah, but it's all collateralized. I mean, it sounds scary, but it is collateralized. And there are pools on curve with ethereum and synthetic ethereum, which are, I think, deep enough that synthetic Ethereum holds a pretty solid peg.
00:40:37.890 - 00:40:38.566, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:38.748 - 00:40:41.480, Speaker C: So that's kind of how those things work.
00:40:43.370 - 00:40:44.120, Speaker A: Mean.
00:40:44.510 - 00:40:56.430, Speaker C: But synthetics, often people joke and say no one uses it. And then I saw on Twitter that they had hit a high of daily active users. And synthetics has been around since like 2018 or something.
00:40:56.500 - 00:41:00.922, Speaker A: Yeah, just kind of kicked into that encrypted terms. That's like ancient.
00:41:01.066 - 00:41:50.000, Speaker C: I know it's an older protocol and kind of pretty forward looking. The basic thing is, yeah, they hit a high and they launched a version two of their perpetuals product on L2. And I think a lot of what they're able to do is thanks to the scalability of L2. So, yeah, I mean, it was just interesting to see this old protocol bust something out and hit a high. And I think people are using their perpetuals, and I'm not super familiar with the whole perpetual landscape. I'm kind of surprised that synthetix was able to kind of gain so much excitement so quickly because GMX also has.
00:41:51.410 - 00:41:54.766, Speaker A: Bitmax is still massive, of course, and.
00:41:54.788 - 00:42:12.600, Speaker C: Even on chain, I think there are other perpetual products because the big thing is that this is on chain. It's not a bitmex where that's a centralized exchange. This is, of course, crypto native. But I also thought, yeah, they would have had more competition. So I was surprised to see this, and I don't quite understand.
00:42:15.610 - 00:43:01.746, Speaker A: I just want to say for all of you viewers who just want to learn about a lot of these protocols and a lot of the things that we're talking about and just want a little, we have a whole education section in the defiant defi explainers. If you just click on, check out all this stuff. Our colleague Rahul Nambiyampurath has done a wonderful job in writing up. Really. These are not snapshots. He goes deep on all of these different topics and I know because I edit them, but this is good stuff. Like, look, we even did one on what is Defi lending? What was Terra.
00:43:01.746 - 00:44:00.422, Speaker A: There's a few kind of autopsies in here. We just did one this week on what was Luna? What is bitcoin? What is bitcoin, Alex? What is cryptocurrency? So we got a bunch there and then we got a bunch in this other one, tutorials. So there's a bunch here, too. So just FYI, if you ever want to know, like, look, there's synthetics. So if you ever wanted to know what this is, it's all explained here. And speaking of questions, what is going through the mind of Barry Silbert right now as Genesis trading files for. And, you know, the drama, the legal drama continues.
00:44:00.422 - 00:44:07.580, Speaker A: Let's find Alex. You've been covering a lot of the fire and brimstone that's coming down here. We.
00:44:09.790 - 00:44:10.490, Speaker B: Story.
00:44:10.640 - 00:44:12.970, Speaker A: Walk us through the Genesis story. Right?
00:44:13.120 - 00:44:47.266, Speaker B: Yeah. So what you've got up there on the screen is going to be updated shortly because since that was written, Genesis filed for bankruptcy. It had been contemplating doing so basically, since it froze customer assets back in November, multiple news reports had come out, but it finally took this step. Right. Got something in the inbox at like 11:59 p.m. Last night. To be clear, Genesis has like a couple businesses, right? It's got like a spot trading arm and a lending arm.
00:44:47.266 - 00:45:36.034, Speaker B: It's the lending arm that's filed for bankruptcy and it's kind of the culmination of this big pressure campaign to get Genesis and its parent company, DCG, run by Barry Silbert, to put forward a plan to return creditors money. Right. So when Genesis froze, it was one of the biggest crypto lenders in the industry, if not the biggest. In the fourth quarter of 2021, before the bear market had originated. $50 billion in loans. Yeah. About a week after FTX filed for bankruptcy, Genesis lending arm froze customer assets.
00:45:36.034 - 00:46:08.450, Speaker B: It said it wouldn't honor withdrawal requests. It wouldn't take any new deposits. It had taken a big hit back when three arrows collapsed in the summer. It also had about $175,000,000 stuck on FTX that it can't get out. And so, yeah, it's kind of like the story of 2022, right? Like everybody gets worried about company X. There's a run on the deposits, it puts out a statement saying it's having liquidity issues and freezes customer withdrawals. And then some amounts of time later, it finally files for bankruptcy.
00:46:08.450 - 00:47:11.602, Speaker B: The crux here is that Genesis had an agreement with Gemini US based crypto exchange where Gemini would offer its customers an earn program. They would get really juicy annual yield on their crypto deposits, and the way they got that yield was they put the money in Gemini. Gemini handed it over to Genesis. Genesis would do its whole lending thing, and each kind of entity there would take a cut of the return before finally passing off the yield back to the customers. And the estimate is that some $900 million were stuck on Genesis that belong to Gemini earned customers. So there's a big public spat at the beginning of the year between Gemini CEO Cameron Winkleboss and Barry Silbert, who runs the parent company, Genesis TCG. And one of the interesting things that came out of the bankruptcy filing last night is Cameron Winkleboss took to Twitter.
00:47:11.602 - 00:47:48.334, Speaker B: He's been at war with Barry Silbert for the past two or three weeks, and he's not letting up. Right. He said that the bankruptcy filing was like an important step toward getting Gemini earned customers their money back. But he's been preparing legal action against Barry Silbert and DCG and actually got this right here in front of me. He doesn't love the terms of this bankruptcy. And unless Barry and DCG come to their senses, Winkleboss said, and make a fair offer to creditors, we will be filing a lawsuit against Barry.
00:47:48.382 - 00:48:34.322, Speaker A: And litigation, it's an explosion of litigation. And now you've got the SEC weighing in, too, because let's not forget that the SEC has sued both Genesis and Gemini for earn, saying that, by the way, fighting. Just FYI, you're on the hook to us because these are unregistered securities. And that is important because they're saying, like any yield bearing product, you have to interpret it this way. Any yield bearing product is considered an investment contract by the securities and Exchange Commission under the Exchange act and the securities act. And you better register, or we can come after you and sue you and get fines and everything. So they're sending a very clear message.
00:48:34.376 - 00:48:36.820, Speaker B: With that suit, right?
00:48:38.790 - 00:48:40.740, Speaker A: Yeah. So the drama will continue.
00:48:42.070 - 00:48:42.434, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:48:42.472 - 00:48:44.260, Speaker B: Christ, the drama is going to continue.
00:48:45.110 - 00:49:22.240, Speaker A: Yeah. And then we also had this really wild story that came out yesterday, which was crazy. Know, after all of the. And Drang of FTX and SBF, John Ray, who's the newly appointed CEO and workout specialist who was appointed to head FTX, now comes out and says, oh, yeah, by the way, maybe we could restart. We could restart the exchange. And what did FTT do?
00:49:23.970 - 00:49:43.750, Speaker B: FTT shot way up. I actually got a check on FTT now. I wonder if it's come back down to earth since the news came out. But it's funny, because SBF, this whole time he's been, you know, we could restart the exchange, and there's plenty there to salvage. And that's one way to.
00:49:43.820 - 00:49:58.140, Speaker A: He says the whole US unit is intact. He's been claiming that. He wrote in his substac last week, he said, by the way, the whole US unit is absolutely intact and everything is hunky dory. Not that we can believe anything he says, but it's still. That's his position.
00:49:58.510 - 00:50:29.160, Speaker B: That's his, know, the folks who are now in charge of FTX. I don't know if John Ray specifically said this, but they dispute that. They say that there's a shortfall at FTX, us as well. But Sam has been know you guys should restart the exchange. And it's funny, so this news came out yesterday. The Wall Street Journal had published the first interview with John Ray since he had taken control of the company. And he says that that's something that they will consider.
00:50:29.160 - 00:50:49.260, Speaker B: Because, know, various people, I guess not just SBF, have suggested that there is something of value there. But it's also funny, know, as SBF has kind of been beating this drum. John Ray says in the interview, we haven't spoken to him. We don't need to. He's got nothing of value to share with us.
00:50:52.990 - 00:50:53.434, Speaker C: I guess.
00:50:53.472 - 00:50:58.126, Speaker B: I wonder if there are any other suggestions from SBF that they might.
00:50:58.228 - 00:51:17.000, Speaker A: Well, FTT is up 1.4% in the last hour. It's down 4.4 in the last 24 hours. So there was clearly some profit taking. But in the last seven days, it's up 64% solid. Yeah, there you go.
00:51:19.450 - 00:51:23.400, Speaker B: Beginning of the month, it was worth less than a dollar. It's now trading at 226.
00:51:23.770 - 00:51:30.600, Speaker A: Yeah, sometimes that happens. Crazy.
00:51:31.370 - 00:51:47.278, Speaker B: Because the MTT token was used to. It was kind of like. What's the word I'm looking for? It was given to people who were trading on FTX as kind of like a way to get discounts on their trades. Right. Like it had utility, if you were.
00:51:47.364 - 00:51:50.800, Speaker A: You mean it was like ecosystem, like loyalty points.
00:51:52.390 - 00:51:56.740, Speaker C: It was like a membership. Yeah, it was more like a membership gets you some.
00:51:57.510 - 00:52:00.610, Speaker A: It's like what the supermarket gives you. It's like coupons.
00:52:01.190 - 00:52:05.906, Speaker B: Yeah, there you go.
00:52:05.928 - 00:52:07.250, Speaker A: Have some FGT.
00:52:08.090 - 00:52:41.518, Speaker B: Might actually have some value. But what's interesting is that FTX says that it's recovered some $5.5 billion, most of which is in, quote, unquote, liquid crypto assets. And it included in that category $500 million worth of FTT, which I don't think anybody believes is a liquid crypto asset. Now, were they to restart the exchange and FTT actually had some value, they might be able to sell it for a decent bit of money.
00:52:41.604 - 00:53:04.280, Speaker A: Well, look, I mean, if it's going up that much, somebody's buying it. So right now, you just wonder if John Ray and his team are actually trading. Like, if they're actually saying, look, we need to sell FTT to raise real money that we can then turn around and provide to the creditors pool going forward.
00:53:05.050 - 00:53:16.730, Speaker B: You just don't know if they're trading on that announcement, though. Wouldn't that kind of obligate them to restart the exchange? Because otherwise it's, I don't know, manipulation. Right.
00:53:16.880 - 00:53:18.330, Speaker A: Probably. I don't know.
00:53:18.480 - 00:53:26.926, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a crazy move. That would be crazy if he leaked that in order to, I mean, in some ways, it's like, oh, no, he couldn't do that. Right?
00:53:27.108 - 00:53:43.682, Speaker A: No, that's an absolute taboo. Yeah, no, you guys are right. You couldn't do that. But look, the obligation is you have to get assets back to the creditors as best you can.
00:53:43.816 - 00:53:44.500, Speaker B: Right?
00:53:44.950 - 00:53:54.422, Speaker A: So imagine all the liquid crypto assets that are being held in various accounts and so forth. Now, with the crypto market rallying over the last three weeks, that actually bodes well.
00:53:54.556 - 00:53:54.902, Speaker C: Right.
00:53:54.956 - 00:54:07.638, Speaker A: So I guess the question I would have is, does John Ray and his team, are they actively trading in cryptocurrencies right now to raise capital to give back to the creditors?
00:54:07.734 - 00:54:09.706, Speaker C: Yeah. Are they trying to time the top or something?
00:54:09.808 - 00:54:28.498, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe it would be interesting if they were, because the single largest, quote, unquote liquid crypto asset they have is the sole token, and that's been just going gangbusters this year. Right. So they'd have to be really in small increments, just like a trickle getting it out.
00:54:28.664 - 00:54:54.570, Speaker A: Right. So what would the rule be? Would the rule be like, everything's frozen, it's static. No matter what the market is doing, John Ray and FTX are just standing pad on everything. There's no selling, there's no trading, there's no nothing. Whatever the asset is is what it is. Whatever the value of that asset is, once it comes time to pay back the creditors, that's what it is. Or do they have the flexibility to actually trade to raise more money.
00:54:54.570 - 00:55:05.878, Speaker A: Of course, with the trading comes more risk too, because they could lose more money so the credit can turn around and say, hey, wait a minute, you had more last week than you screwed me.
00:55:05.904 - 00:55:07.322, Speaker B: Why did you trade on Tuesday?
00:55:07.466 - 00:55:13.854, Speaker C: Yeah. Oh my God, that would be amazing, trading with like a defunct FTX's assets.
00:55:13.982 - 00:55:35.058, Speaker A: But that's what's kind of crazy about this whole story is that I'm just trying to think like exchanges don't really go. Isn't just doesn't happen every day that you have an exchange that goes bankrupt and the assets that could be paid back to creditors are tradable. They're securities.
00:55:35.234 - 00:55:35.718, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:55:35.804 - 00:55:39.900, Speaker A: And so I don't know, it's an interesting case study.
00:55:40.830 - 00:55:54.966, Speaker C: We've got just a couple of comments from the comment section. Astro Trader just said, what if they're false pumping the market, taking the money and then crash mean, that's.
00:55:54.998 - 00:56:18.582, Speaker A: I was no evidence that that's the know. And given John Ray's reputation, I just think that's a, you know, all of these questions around trading and how an exchange restores assets back to creditors is a really interesting one.
00:56:18.716 - 00:56:19.990, Speaker C: Yeah, totally.
00:56:23.370 - 00:56:58.658, Speaker A: Okay, well, I think that. What a week. Yeah, I liked all the trading stories this week. I liked the DFI resurgent vibe that's kind of coming out as there's just a lot more action and activity in the space. It definitely kind of lends more credence to the DFI kind of humming along as the CFI titans continue to. It's more than wobble, they kind of crack up a lot, but. Yeah, very interesting.
00:56:58.824 - 00:57:02.818, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally think. Go ahead, Alex, hit it.
00:57:02.904 - 00:57:13.746, Speaker B: I was going to say the difference that like $300 makes, right. A couple of weeks ago, ether was trading at one $200 a pop. Now it's 15 and it's like future finance.
00:57:13.938 - 00:57:15.080, Speaker C: I knew it all.
00:57:18.670 - 00:57:21.770, Speaker A: Yeah. And then as soon as you start your hedge fund, it'll.
00:57:22.350 - 00:57:26.538, Speaker C: Yeah, I know what I'm doing anyway.
00:57:26.624 - 00:57:50.138, Speaker A: Excellent. Sure. Well, listen, guys, thanks again for a wonderful week. Lots of hard work, lots of good stories, and looking forward to what you come up with next week. Defiers. Have a great weekend. Look for the weekly recap tomorrow in your inboxes, as well as Defi Alpha and the inbox dump.
00:57:50.138 - 00:57:50.990, Speaker A: See ya.
00:57:51.060 - 00:57:55.810, Speaker B: See you guys later. Don't.
