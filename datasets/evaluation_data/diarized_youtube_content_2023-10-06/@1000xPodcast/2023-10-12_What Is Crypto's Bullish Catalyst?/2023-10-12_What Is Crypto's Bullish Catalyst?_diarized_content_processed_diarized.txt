00:00:00.520 - 00:00:12.550, Speaker A: We're in a very shaky place for risk overall. I think that the time to be aggressive is when everybody's talking about a recession. I think that any buy below 25k on BTC, you're gonna look like a genius in a year.
00:00:12.662 - 00:00:13.398, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:13.566 - 00:00:17.150, Speaker A: So it's just a matter of making sure that you have a good entry point.
00:00:17.262 - 00:00:19.246, Speaker B: Well, there you have it. Don't fight the flows.
00:00:19.310 - 00:00:44.114, Speaker A: Don't you just. You just don't. Don't fight the flow. Welcome back to another episode of 1000 X. It has been a extremely eventful two weeks. Joan and I are back in our homes, you know, and we've been. We've been watching this unfold over the last.
00:00:44.114 - 00:01:16.422, Speaker A: Over the last 72 hours. And I'll say that it's going to be a very interesting period for the market's crypto risk or oil just across the board. It's time to. It's time to pay attention, in my opinion. There's going to be a lot of opportunity out there over the coming weeks, but there's also going to be a lot of danger. And so, you know, I think as the biggest. Obviously, the biggest news story of the week is this conflict that's come up in Israel.
00:01:16.422 - 00:01:47.954, Speaker A: You see defense stocks up. Lockheed was up about 11% at the peak today. Palantir was up. And you're seeing oil go up as well, which I thought about for a bit. And I went back and forth as to whether oil would go up or not, just purely because the people fighting have nothing to do. I mean, there's no oil in Israel, there's no oil in Gaza. So there is a little bit of, should it go up? But, jonah, I'd be curious.
00:01:47.954 - 00:02:02.094, Speaker A: I think you come from a world where geopolitics is extremely important, and so you probably got a good knack for understanding how these things might impact the markets. So I'm curious what your gut take is after digesting the news.
00:02:02.874 - 00:02:48.604, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Let's start with oil. Oil is up because whenever there is conflict in the Middle east, it's a knee jerk reaction for oil to rally. But if you delve a little deeper, the leadership of Hamas has openly thanked Iran for helping them plan this attack. The Wall Street Journal has reported something to that effect. I obviously have no idea what Iran's involvement in this particular conflict is, but the market perceives Iran to be sort of an involved participant. Now, Iran is a huge oil producer and they are currently sanctioned by the United States, which makes it difficult for them to sell their oil on the open market.
00:02:48.604 - 00:03:34.520, Speaker B: There have been years of attempts at diplomacy between the Biden administration and even when Biden was VP during the Obama administration to lift those sanctions and allow Iran to export freely again. And those talks have been progressing recently. This conflict would be a setback to that diplomacy, which obviously, if Iran can export, that means lower oil prices. If they can't export, that means higher oil prices. So a setback to diplomacy, which would lead to higher iranian exports, means higher prices. A bit tough to follow, but not that crazy. The sort of inside baseball here is that Iran is quietly exporting all of their oil anyway, or close to it.
00:03:34.520 - 00:03:41.696, Speaker B: So even if the sanctions were to be lifted, it wouldn't actually result in much of a difference in global exports.
00:03:41.840 - 00:03:46.448, Speaker A: But it has to be at lower prices, much lower prices than what they would get otherwise.
00:03:46.576 - 00:04:15.368, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I mean, but what the price that you see on the screen is, that's just like sort of an amalgamation of all different oil prices in the world. I mean, like, you're looking at renter Ti and those benchmarks. Those benchmarks factor in global supply and demand, right? You're not looking at the price of iranian crude when you look at crude. So that's crude, right. That's why you got a knee jerk rally. Even though the balance of supply and demand doesn't really change that much one way or another.
00:04:15.368 - 00:04:31.428, Speaker B: It's just a setback. Another thing is wars consume a lot of petroleum, but Israel is a small country and this war probably wouldn't consume that much petroleum. Meanwhile, if you had, like, China mobilizing against India, that would probably be a bigger deal, but that's not happening.
00:04:31.476 - 00:05:08.914, Speaker A: We hope that's a good overview of the situation. And one thing that stands out to me is that despite crypto decorrelating from risk a ton over the last month, which is normally a bullish signal, if you look at it over the last 30 days, the S and P has traded down and bitcoin's actually traded up over that time period. I think, unfortunately, a part of that is definitely sailor buying, and I think that what you're going to get if.
00:05:09.034 - 00:05:10.134, Speaker B: How much did he buy?
00:05:10.674 - 00:05:41.594, Speaker A: 500 million. Was it BTC, sailor? Yeah, but it's one of those things that if you look at it, just zoomed out. We're in a very shaky place for risk overall because I think that flows still look bad. You have this conflict that's escalating, and higher oil is very bad for risk.
00:05:41.634 - 00:05:46.322, Speaker B: Prices, especially right now, because inflation, because.
00:05:46.378 - 00:05:53.206, Speaker A: Inflation and rates are already booming. I mean, bond market is selling off.
00:05:53.270 - 00:05:58.598, Speaker B: Massively over the last price of bonds down yields up.
00:05:58.726 - 00:06:37.036, Speaker A: Yes, price bonds down yields up. And I think that has long lasting impacts that take a while to show up in the real economy. And so what you get is you have this perfect storm. And I think one other issue was that the market was pricing in a soft landing pretty aggressively, and we're slowly starting to go the other way. I think that the time to be aggressive is when everybody's talking about a recession, when everybody and their mother is looking around and they're going, yep, there's no way that we have a soft landing on the horizon. We're going into a recession. I think that's when it's going to be a good time to start.
00:06:37.036 - 00:07:11.498, Speaker A: Start scaling in. And so all of that being said, I don't think that bitcoin has enough idiosyncratic juice to avoid a drawdown if the broader risk markets go down, which is why I'm positioned very cautiously right now. I think puts are a good idea. Both two weak and four week puts. I think volume is pretty low. ETH obviously in more trouble than BTC, but also more shorter than BTC. So you have to weigh that a little bit.
00:07:11.498 - 00:07:15.666, Speaker A: Just looking at open interest, a lot more shorts open on Ethan than there are.
00:07:15.690 - 00:07:50.294, Speaker B: Yeah, ETH is going south fast. I mean, I'm sure you know more than I do at this point, Avi, but I just look at Nft floor prices like crypto punks, down 20% the floor in the last couple weeks. Gas prices on ETH, we're looking at nine gwei neutral for the flip between inflationary and deflationary. ETH is what, 1516 Gui. And we're trading. Gas prices are well below that level. So there's just not a lot of activity.
00:07:50.334 - 00:08:00.028, Speaker A: Yeah, there's also the FTX guy that's just had 180,000 ETH. He's out. He's. As of current recording, he's out of about. Let me see half of it.
00:08:00.196 - 00:08:02.196, Speaker B: Well, there you have it. Don't fight the flows.
00:08:02.260 - 00:08:16.964, Speaker A: Don't you just. You just don't. Don't fight the flows. So I. If you're going to buy anything, you might as well just buy bitcoin at this point. There are some alts that are doing well, like link, like DydX. But overall, I mean, this is, this is a, this, this is a bad market to be.
00:08:16.964 - 00:08:42.070, Speaker A: To be. To be long in. You know, I'm waiting. Personally, I'm waiting for the flush. I think that any buy below 25K on BTC, you're going to look like a genius in a year. So it's just a matter of making sure that you have a good entry point, because, I mean, if you buy, like, right, if you're, like, buying 27, five, when you draw down 10%, then you start to feel a little bit skittish. Maybe you trade 24, and then you start to.
00:08:42.070 - 00:09:05.836, Speaker A: You start to get real worried, and then psychologically, you're, you know, you're hurt. I think that you basically just focus on getting. On getting good entries so you're not psychologically tormented. If we go down to 22 and then just. And then just wait. I mean, realistically, like, if you think about it long term, this is actually quite good for, I think conflict in the world. Well, terrible is good for bitcoin.
00:09:05.836 - 00:09:08.140, Speaker A: It's very good in any global disorder.
00:09:08.172 - 00:10:20.930, Speaker B: Is good for bitcoin because it is a. An impartial reserve asset that anyone can stash when the US starts going sanctioned crazy. And the other thing you mentioned, interest rates, Avi, when we're sitting here in a year's time and interest rates are still explosive and mortgages are still expensive, at some point, home prices are going to start to tank, and then the United States government, in an election year, is going to face a very difficult choice. It's like the choice is, do we let american homeowners, do we let the middle class take the medicine that should have been taken in 2008 and again in 2020, and just take the whole thing and cost ourselves the election? Or do we pump more stimulus in and print more money and bring yields down and do all of these things that governments do, you know, free beer for everybody, do the things that governments do to get reelected, right? I have a feeling it's going to be the latter. In fact, I'd put my money on it. And at that point, maybe you're looking at $100,000 BTC or higher, because that is what BTC is purpose built to hedge the investor against. That's the long term.
00:10:20.930 - 00:10:38.426, Speaker B: The short term, it's like, who cares about bitcoin when there's a geopolitical conflict? The only thing that's been holding stocks up is AI mania, Nvidia, whatever. Like, we, you know, things could tank pretty hard in the short term. Tread. Tread carefully. Tread lightly and. And stay nimble. I agree with you, Avi.
00:10:38.490 - 00:10:40.854, Speaker A: You picked such an interesting time to get back into that game.
00:10:41.314 - 00:10:58.176, Speaker B: It's a. It's always an interesting time to get into oil or into crypto. There's always something going on. Like, let's say that you started in. In oil with a clean slate. Right now, it could be like, well, it's in a precarious position. It could go up a lot or down a lot.
00:10:58.176 - 00:11:40.564, Speaker B: Like, if there's a recession, oil could tank 30%. If there's a massive geopolitical conflict in the Middle east, oil could rally 50%. So you sort of have to tread lightly, otherwise you get steamrolled in your new role. Equally in crypto, we both think this thing is going to ten x over on a three to five year timeline, but you might not be able to hang on to the mechanical bull. Right. You might get thrown off. So I think all markets are in very sort of tenuous position, and that's because of the ten years where they weren't in a tenuous position, which is like 2010 to 2020, when Janet Yellen kept her foot on the gas for, like, five years longer than she should have.
00:11:40.564 - 00:11:59.220, Speaker B: Right. So there was a long period of time where markets were just super boring, and then that's set up for a time basically driven by interest rates and geopolitical conflict, where all markets, including crypto and crude oil and natural gas and equities and everything else, are going to be super volatile and treacherous, but also really rewarding for people that play it right.
00:11:59.412 - 00:12:47.678, Speaker A: Yeah. That, honestly, that specific set of circumstances does make me think that the probability that we end up going sideways in bitcoin or crypto for a substantial period of time is higher than people expect. I think one thing that people forget is there doesn't have to be a cycle. There doesn't have to be another bull run in 2024, 2025, just because that's how it's worked in the past. I think it's in the back of everybody's mind that's almost taken for granted, but there are very specific circumstances that led to that, that may or may not happen again. I think, long term, my view of the world is obviously, bitcoin has a much greater place that could be in 2026 or 2027, which is why I'm spending a lot of time on the other areas. Right.
00:12:47.678 - 00:13:20.292, Speaker A: Of digital assets of crypto. It's like, okay, well, I actually had the benefit of playing around with Stars arena, which was the platform that got hacked, and kind of that. That was built. That was built on Avax. And I tweeted about this, and I said, just to be clear, I said I would not put real money on this platform. But the reality is the product itself was pretty good. It's a competitor to Friendtech, and I used it and it was, you know, it had a feed, it had a better messaging system.
00:13:20.292 - 00:14:00.506, Speaker A: Like, the product was more fun to use than friend tech. And so we actually are seeing iterations now that are making consumer products for crypto better, and we are seeing usage. And, you know, if it hadn't gotten hacked, I think that it would. It would be doing quite well, quite well today just by virtue of it being. It being a good product, you know, not advocating anybody put money on it. Obviously, it's been hacked twice, but it's one of those things that makes you realize, hey, okay, maybe there are actually some good applications slowly coming out. And so investing in the tech, investing in the infra, it's like, okay, the stuff.
00:14:00.506 - 00:14:13.334, Speaker A: This stuff can actually decorrelate over a long enough time period. You could, you. You might find that bitcoin could be down 15, 20% over the course of a year, and there could. There are going to be things that are up 100%.
00:14:14.234 - 00:14:53.280, Speaker B: Yeah. You just have to be one of the few people left paying attention. I mean, if it didn't get hacked, that's a big if, right? Like, if it had a good user experience, if it didn't get hacked, if there was no fraudulent SPF type character roles involved in all of these ifs. Crypto. It's a little bit too plagued with problems at the moment. And I feel like to have its next big summer, you need to have five to ten amazing new products and use cases come out that are secure, user friendly, and run by competent operators. And I feel like we're due for that.
00:14:53.472 - 00:14:56.124, Speaker A: Yeah, the competent operator is being key.
00:14:56.544 - 00:15:11.936, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Because, I mean, anybody can spin up a project at the. At the valuation space of 2021 and run it into the ground. I feel like you need lower prices to foster good stewardship of a project.
00:15:12.120 - 00:15:23.072, Speaker A: It does. It does make me sad just because it was a pretty solid. Like, it was a pretty solid product that got hacked. Like, okay, this thing's good.
00:15:23.128 - 00:15:41.664, Speaker B: So FTX got hacked as well. What happened there? Some guy stole how many ETH? And then, do you mind talking about. I wanted to ask you as well, Avi. So there's the FTX hacker, and then there's the FTX administrator, custodian, whatever you call it, Galaxy. So what are these two entities doing, and how much are they selling each week?
00:15:42.444 - 00:16:23.664, Speaker A: That's a really. It's a. It's a really good question. And the answer is, it's going to take a very long time to actually come up with the plan. So they're in the process right now, of actually figuring out what assets to sell, how to sell them, over what time period to sell them, and this plan has to be approved. And so this selling is going to take a while to actually occur. It's obviously going to be an overhang on the market, but it's really mostly going to be an overhang for Solana relative to everything else, because the actual supply that they have at BTC and ether, much lower in terms of circulating.
00:16:23.704 - 00:16:28.840, Speaker B: Cap than Solana, looks rich at $22. I agree with you, it does.
00:16:28.952 - 00:16:44.004, Speaker A: It's one of those things I really like over a, oh, wow, look, we're getting a nice little sell off here on BTC. I'm personally, I think ETH puts are a great idea. I think they just, I think they just make sense right now.
00:16:44.864 - 00:16:54.960, Speaker B: I would finance them by selling calls. I would just buy bear risk reversals by put sell call. I don't see ETH exploding higher in the next couple of weeks. There's too much selling.
00:16:55.112 - 00:17:45.636, Speaker A: No, there's too much. There's, the issue right now with the market is that there's no real reason for people to step in and buy. And what I mean by that is you had the grayscale lawsuit resolve itself. And so the only positive catalyst to the upside is the ETF at this point. And so the way that I always think about these types of things, or you have, you have your momentum buyers who are currently momentum sellers, and then you have your value buyers. And when I look at bitcoin, I don't see value until 25k or lower. And so there's really nobody that's going to, in my opinion, there's nobody that's going to step in aggressively until those levels.
00:17:45.636 - 00:18:44.152, Speaker A: And on ETH, it's much lower. I think one of the issues with ETH has actually been, conversely, the prevalence of l two s and the amount of activity that l two s have relative to the base layer. Because the argument was always, well, if you increase throughput by 100 x, which has happened, then you should increase transactions by 100 x, but that hasn't happened. It's not even close to happen. What you've just done is you've just moved all the transactions from ETH to arbitrum, and you've fairly increased the overall amount of transactions that are occurring. And so from my perspective, what you get is there's going to be a big lag period over the next year where ETH just looks like shit on a fee basis, and everyone was kind of expecting it to look good on a deflationary basis. But that's just not going to be the case as long as activity is mostly on base or mostly on arbitrum or mostly on optimism.
00:18:44.152 - 00:18:57.960, Speaker A: So I'm actually quite negative on ETH for the time being. It'll have its time again. But I think for right now I'm quite bearish on the ETH BTC ratio.
00:18:57.992 - 00:19:35.366, Speaker B: Yeah, I used to be bullish on ETH because all these scaling solutions were being built. Just being a California guy, growing up in the state of California, they're always adding lanes to the freeways and it never seems to ease the traffic. Right? Like every time they add a new lane, it just brings more cars onto the freeway. So basically, you know, after a while you start to wonder like, what's the point of doing this? You just, you don't ease the, the bottleneck. And I thought the same thing would happen to ETH. I thought it would be like, okay, you have this, you have this blockchain whose block space is constantly in. Like there's an excess of demand relative to supply.
00:19:35.366 - 00:20:16.426, Speaker B: Gas prices are insane. You have to spend $200 to buy an NFT that's worth $20. Like, how the fuck you know? So I just assumed that scaling solutions would, would ultimately bring more flow to ETH and make the product more scalable and make it this global world computer faster. And it would be like the California freeway instead. It's actually looking more like the way that pipelines work in the permian basin in Texas, where sometimes there's just too much oil, not enough pipelines, everything's bottlenecked. So then there's this frenzy of pipeline building, which is effectively a scaling solution for an oil field. And then suddenly there's just way too much pipeline capacity and not enough oil.
00:20:16.426 - 00:20:55.362, Speaker B: And then it goes back and forth. So I think yet another analogy between ETH and oil. I think it looks more like scaling solutions were overbuilt during a particular time in ETH's history when there was a lot of demand for it, and now there's not a lot of demand for ETH because no one cares right now and way too much capacity. And so gas prices are just forced into the toilet. And I agree with you. I think the pendulum will swing back the other way hard one day when it's like, holy shit, we have this thing that's cheaper and better than AWS for our use case and probably more permanent, but like, you know, that might be a year, year off or six months off or two years off. Who knows?
00:20:55.418 - 00:20:58.694, Speaker A: There's no OPEC for ETH it's an issue.
00:20:59.614 - 00:21:01.846, Speaker B: There's a foundation, and they're selling right?
00:21:01.910 - 00:21:37.314, Speaker A: Yeah, they're selling right now. They're increasing supply at the worst possible time. Even though they sell very small size, they've been remarkably consistent at selling tops, local tops. And I think it's very funny, because I think it's like they, I think they sold two and a half million this time, which is, dude, that's nothing. But everybody's talking about it, and everybody's like, oh, my God, what do they know? This time, it's self reinforcing is the thing, right? So they do it, they do it right once. And then people are like, oh, my God, they must know something. And then they do.
00:21:37.314 - 00:21:43.974, Speaker A: And then, you know, people, uh, you know, people start to, uh, people start to panic.
00:21:45.754 - 00:22:04.220, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean it. Look, if your entire net worth is in ETH right now, you should be panicking. But, um, if you, if ETH is part of a diversified portfolio, uh, as we've recommended, you know, maybe you shouldn't be panicking. Maybe it's more like, uh, oh, cool, this thing.
00:22:04.292 - 00:22:14.984, Speaker A: I mean, I would definitely reduce ETH exposure. I think. I think the right, the right level for ETH BTc to become a gigabool is 0.5.
00:22:16.204 - 00:22:36.066, Speaker B: Well, if you're like me and you own nfts, your ETH exposure reduces naturally for you on sell offs. It's like a gamma position, right? When during these periods of time where ETH goes down, the value of your NfT is denominated in ETH also goes down. So I have less ETH than I did when ETH was high.
00:22:36.130 - 00:22:38.226, Speaker A: It's amazing how it self corrects like that, Jenna.
00:22:38.290 - 00:22:38.934, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:40.914 - 00:22:41.666, Speaker A: That'S good.
00:22:41.770 - 00:22:53.962, Speaker B: At this point, I think. I think you're right. I think so. Also, there was that futures ETF that launched for ETH, and while in and of itself, I don't think it's that relevant, because no one cares about a future ETF anymore. People just want spot. They don't want.
00:22:54.018 - 00:22:55.906, Speaker A: It's just such a bad product.
00:22:56.090 - 00:23:27.624, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like the product itself is like, you could only imagine a world of people buying tons of it at a picotop where it's just like, oh, my God, get me the exposure somehow. Anyhow, I don't even want to read the prospectus. Like, obviously, in a bear market, something with contango roll yield isn't going to attract anybody. So I'm not, like, reading into the poor ETF launch as like, oh, wow, look at, how do crypto is I'm more looking at it as, like, you launch a crappy product in a down market and no one cares.
00:23:29.804 - 00:23:40.324, Speaker A: Yeah. I think one. One issue is that veto was live, so everybody could see just how shitty, like, how terrible that product is.
00:23:40.444 - 00:23:40.908, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:40.996 - 00:24:08.874, Speaker A: And the fact that, although one thing that's funny is you tend to people actually overestimate how bad it is, because if you look at the returns, it's underperforming bitcoin by something like 30% just from a pure price basis. But they have dividends and cash distributions, and that actually compensates for a lot of it. So I think it's actually only underperforming by 10%. But that's still bad. That's still very bad.
00:24:09.334 - 00:24:23.084, Speaker B: Only underperforming by 10%. So, you know what doesn't underperform by 10% is stable coins. Avi, what do you think about the world of stables right now and specifically the leakage in USDC?
00:24:23.204 - 00:25:06.004, Speaker A: There's a concept that good money drives out or bad money drives out good money. And I think that's what's happening right now, is you have a lot of people, people in China, people in Russia, that want dollars and they want to have real dollar. Maybe they want to buy real estate in the US, or they want to go buy other goods in the US because they want to protect their portfolio. They don't want too much exposure to the ruble or to the yuan. A lot of people are using tether to get out of this, in my opinion. And based on the flows that we're seeing and the people that we're talking to, this actually seems like a very common occurrence. People are just buying tether to get out of their base currency.
00:25:06.004 - 00:25:54.414, Speaker A: And so if you actually look a lot of at tether growth, like tether growth is almost one to one, coincided with USDC decline. And I think what's. What's happening is that people are, because you can source tether. If in China and Hong Kong and in these places, you buy the tether, you create the tether, then you take the tether, you go to binance, you go to Oak X, or you go to Huobi, you go sell it into USDC. Then you send the USDC to somebody else who has an account with Coinbase, they redeem it, and then you get, you buy something in the US, whether it's real estate or something else, and then you transfer over the deed. And so that dynamic, I think, is actually occurring not infrequently right now.
00:25:54.494 - 00:25:56.454, Speaker B: So just for the listeners, and that's.
00:25:56.494 - 00:26:09.574, Speaker A: Leading to the contraction of the USDC supply. Because if you think about it, USDC is a better product. It's just that. And the irony of the situation is it's dying because it's such a good product.
00:26:10.274 - 00:27:17.288, Speaker B: I don't know if I have the same opinion. I mean, I think that USDC is a better product. From a mint redeem perspective, it's like technically a better product, but its target demographic is the developed world where crypto is not a solution. Crypto is a solution right now for emerging markets, for underbanked markets, for people without access to stable currencies or JPMorgan checking accounts. That's where bitcoin and stablecoins are really useful. So ultimately, if USDC serves the, provides a much more optimal technical solution, but serves the developed markets where that solution is not needed, it's going to lose market share to the technically inferior asset that serves the market that actually demands it. So since the beginning of the year, since January 23, the market cap of tether has exploded from 65 billion to $85 billion, and has been very stable at 85 billion since the summer.
00:27:17.288 - 00:27:59.188, Speaker B: Meanwhile, USDC Circle has collapsed from 40 billion to 25 billion. So a $15 billion decline ultimately. I think that what this is telling you is that there is a use case for crypto right now, a very important one, and it's preserving dollarized value in the form of tether and whatever sort of developed. So I think it's emerging markets that are still using crypto for their purpose built use case. And maybe developed markets are giving up on crypto a little bit. And then there's probably some cycling, a lot of cycling. Sort of what you just described, Avi.
00:27:59.188 - 00:28:01.104, Speaker B: Probably a lot of that is going on as well.
00:28:01.804 - 00:28:10.452, Speaker A: I think so. I mean, I think that it's just at the end of the day, it's demand for dollars, and USDC is the best form of dollar right now. I also think, by the way, that's.
00:28:10.468 - 00:28:12.836, Speaker B: Why you're seeing is the best form of dollar.
00:28:12.940 - 00:28:13.764, Speaker A: USDC.
00:28:13.884 - 00:28:16.180, Speaker B: USDC. But the market cap of USDC has.
00:28:16.252 - 00:28:19.660, Speaker A: Collapsed because people know that it's backed by dollars.
00:28:19.772 - 00:28:22.830, Speaker B: Oh, right, I see. So redeeming it into. Yeah, okay, right.
00:28:22.862 - 00:28:36.794, Speaker A: So it's. If you want. If you want dollars, your best bet is to buy USDC and redeem it for dollars. So from that perspective, it's the best. It's the best product, it's the best, it's a best way to access USDT. USD.
00:28:37.134 - 00:28:46.630, Speaker B: But why not tether? Like, why can't you just redeem tether and get your dollars back. I guess it's because, yeah, the mint redeem mechanism for tether is a little bit more.
00:28:46.742 - 00:28:47.614, Speaker A: It's much harder.
00:28:47.694 - 00:28:47.998, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:48.046 - 00:29:12.182, Speaker A: You have to work with specified counterparties. I also think that there's, you know, potentially some words like, okay, well, do. Do I. Do I want to go through the process of redeeming? Redeeming with USDT have, and then have wires to the US from USDT bank accounts. You probably don't want that, actually.
00:29:12.238 - 00:29:15.554, Speaker B: Probably not. Easier to just use the Coinbase USDC channel.
00:29:16.084 - 00:29:52.260, Speaker A: Exactly. It's much easier to use a Coinbase USDC channel. There's a drain in fiat in the general ecosystem right now. And that's actually one thing that, by the way, I think is pretty useful for figuring out what your risk tolerance should be in the markets. Just one anecdote is that we use the stable coins deployed in the market. So for example, just like take all the. I take the top wallets that are active, that are active traders and just calculate what their average stablecoin balances over the last year.
00:29:52.260 - 00:30:15.246, Speaker A: And then when it goes up really high, that's actually a good buy signal. When it goes, when it goes down pretty low, that's a good sell signal because there's just not that much fiat left in the system to either buy to buy to buy or sell. But in aggregate, there's been a drain. That's not, that's not, that's not good. Which is why, again, I'm advocating for just pay. I'm advocating for patients. I'm advocating the bear view.
00:30:15.310 - 00:31:00.028, Speaker B: I don't expect ETH to test the FTX lows. Like, I don't think it's going to get that bad on apathy. I think that's a forced selling flush liquidation type price set. So I don't know. I don't know how many of you listeners out there have researched the Kelly criterion, but it's worth pulling up on Wikipedia and maybe doing a little spreadsheet and just typing in your own probabilities of where you think different. Like where, like different price points and the probability of ETH reaching them. It's amazing how, let's say that your band for ETH is sort of like, you know, let's call it two standard deviations within the next year is sort of like a $1000 ETH to $2,000.
00:31:00.028 - 00:31:32.876, Speaker B: Ethan. It's amazing how quickly the risk reward of being short gets. Like, it goes from amazing to terrible as ETH goes from like 1600 to 1400. How quickly your risk reward shifts and how scared you should be. Being short at 1400 becomes as you approach sort of the bottom of your distribution. And personally, I don't think ETH is going to go much, much below 1200. I think that would be an absolutely dire liquidation.
00:31:32.876 - 00:32:01.830, Speaker B: Flush. Like, everyone just gives up on it type level, it would be lower. But I think already half the space threw in the towel during FTX. So I think the level is higher now. Ultimately, like Avi said, tread lightly here. And I think it's more of a thing for investors to add on dips rather than traders trying to dance between the raindrops and capture $100 a token. Selling now and buying later.
00:32:01.902 - 00:32:58.686, Speaker A: You framed it well at 1400. I think you basically have a floor at 1100. And so the risk reward there just becomes very, very skewed, which is why I think that you're probably going to get a lot of chop between this 1650 area and this 1500 area just because that is the area where risk reward is the most balanced. If you're looking for, if you're looking for a move to, if you're looking for a move to two k or you're looking for a move to 1100, that's just the most balanced area for you. And so I think that's where the real battle is going to take place. And if we break down into the lower portion of that, that's a buying opportunity, which is just kind of what I've been saying, right? You're just looking for good areas to add length so that you look like a genius in a year.
00:32:58.830 - 00:33:19.558, Speaker B: This is. You're absolutely right. And you have to have that year timeframe. Also, if you read crypto Twitter frequently enough, as probably most of the people who listen to this podcast, do, you see people just throwing in the towel, like giving up on ETH? Like, this is it. I've been long ETH since a. It's over now. Like, this is a useless piece of shit asset.
00:33:19.558 - 00:34:09.086, Speaker B: Like, you read tweets where people who have been ETH bullish for five years are just like, it's over, never buying this crap again. Like, I'm selling all my ETH. And so if you're, you know, if you're just, if investing or trading isn't your profession, but you hold some ETH in your personal account and you care about your net worth, like, you, you look at your ETH and you're, and you look at these tweets and you're probably saying to yourself like, crap, I'm. I'm gonna get out. Remind yourself if that's what you're thinking. That in twelve or 18 or 24 months, when this thing is gassing higher and it's trading $5,000 a token, those very same people will be talking about how ETH is the future, how it's going to $50,000 a token, how they've been long. All the way up, you have to filter out the noise and remember that.
00:34:09.110 - 00:34:11.514, Speaker A: Dude, I love it when you go giggable.
00:34:15.094 - 00:34:27.114, Speaker B: It's a probability distribution. It's a gradient of outcomes. It's not black and white. ETH is not over. ETH is not the future. It's. It's like this constantly evolving shade of gray.
00:34:28.654 - 00:35:12.062, Speaker A: Although I will. I will say just one thing, is I am. I am worried about l one's in general, and what happens when block space becomes very cheap. I guess, you know, it remains to be seen, but we're really going to need to increase the amount of transactions that go through these networks. And so what you might find is we might just be going through a dead period for l one s. Which is why I'm so focused on applications right now. Because in order for l one s to do well over the next couple of years, you really need applications to do very well over the next couple of years, because l one s have become so much more efficient over the last 18 months.
00:35:12.062 - 00:35:26.166, Speaker A: Right. With all the launches of the l two s, and you've got ZK coming out soon. So I think that it's just going to be all about the apps, and I think we've sort of beaten that horse. I don't want to get too deep into it.
00:35:26.230 - 00:35:46.884, Speaker B: One game could bowl over. It should only take one application to generate more transaction volume than the network has ever seen in its entire history. Right? I don't know, maybe a game or a back office payments application, visa, I don't know. What do you think? What type of application would you want? Are you looking for?
00:35:49.064 - 00:36:22.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I think gaming is the most likely. Then you have the social finance as well. But realistically, I think that one thing that could really take off is if you got tokenized. Tokenized stock trading, bond trading on chain. I mean, I know Goldman's trying to come out with their money market fund in Q one of next year, and that's going to be big. And we'll see if it's composable with the rest of. I doubt it, but we'll see if it's composable with the rest of the world.
00:36:22.730 - 00:36:57.408, Speaker A: But the more products that launch like that, I think the better off. You know, the better off we get in crypto, and that's something that I could really see taken off massively. Look at Kanto. So they're doing a lot in the RWA space right now, and if they like, one of the things that they're teasing is they're teasing a launch of a treasury product. And, for example, what if they allow you to lever up treasuries? That would be a good use case for crypto.
00:36:57.526 - 00:36:57.868, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:57.916 - 00:36:59.748, Speaker A: So, you know, we'll see.
00:36:59.796 - 00:37:40.518, Speaker B: If you're in crypto, it should be for the big wins. It's not to, like, dance between the raindrops and chip around. I mean, honestly, like, I know there are a lot of market neutral funds out there, and I'm sure some of them are really successful and run by brilliant people with great investors and everything, but, like, I think that whole sector has been torched over the course of the last year and a half because they've taken so much risk. A lot of them lost assets on FTX, which was, ironically, the best place to get short crypto. Crypto. So there was probably a lot of people using FTX perps to sell this or that altcoin, and people probably lost a lot of money on that. And then now we're still in a bear market.
00:37:40.518 - 00:38:04.530, Speaker B: Let's say that you want to be short. Not my favorite dead horse to beat. Short polkadot versus long ETH. Like, where are you going to get short polkadot binance. Is there any efficient way to do that? So the market neutral strategies involve a leg where you get short something that there's no efficient way to get short. So, like, it. It doesn't work.
00:38:04.530 - 00:38:15.258, Speaker B: Right. You have to be in this for the. The asymmetric upside, and you have to find ways to survive during times like. Like these. So you need. You need investors that are. That are in it for the long haul.
00:38:15.258 - 00:38:24.014, Speaker B: You need investors who want exposure to crypto. You can't just, like, sell. Sell a market neutral strategy to an investor base that's, like, uninterested in crypto.
00:38:25.694 - 00:38:31.554, Speaker A: I agree with that. You know, I agree with that. This has been a good conversation, Jonah.
00:38:31.934 - 00:38:33.302, Speaker B: Always is, Avi. Thank you.
00:38:33.398 - 00:38:38.354, Speaker A: Always fun. This is dope. We'll do it again. We'll do it again in two weeks.
00:38:38.934 - 00:38:43.714, Speaker B: Stay safe out there, everybody. This world is looking complicated and tricky again.
00:38:44.094 - 00:38:51.286, Speaker A: Hopefully, when we talk next time, we will be out of this situation, but if not, I'll see you. See you in World War three.
00:38:51.350 - 00:38:52.860, Speaker B: Till then, Avi, talk.
00:38:52.892 - 00:38:53.404, Speaker A: Good stuff, Jonah.
