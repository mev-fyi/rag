00:00:00.200 - 00:00:41.225, Speaker A: Adi, we talked about this for like years, right? You know, range bound markets for majors are great for altcoins when the environment is right. And it almost feels like that's the setup here where everyone right now is kind of hiding out, majors being like, you know, I'm safe here, I'm safe in bitcoin. I'll make more moves around the election and I'm just going to avoid alts because, you know, if Kamala wins, the story's over. So I do think the market right now is obviously overweight majors and underweight alts, but the game with alts is just so much harder than it used to be. Right. Because there is less money in the space and so there's just more dispersion. But if you are able to actually pick the sector correctly, you know, obviously that's kind of how you produce alpha in this environment.
00:00:48.485 - 00:01:08.659, Speaker B: Welcome back to another Thousand X podcast. We've got our favorite guest chief on to talk markets. Since we last recorded a podcast about a week ago, a lot has changed. Bitcoin is now above 60k. People are no longer pre rich, they are simply rich. TAO is almost 600. Things have gone well.
00:01:08.659 - 00:01:40.717, Speaker B: But I wanted to start off with there were two major predictions that you made last time we had you on the pod. One was that AI coins would absolutely rip and you mentioned Tao and the other was ETH BTC would do well. So one of those things obviously did not work and then the other worked really well. I think Tao is almost more than 2 1/2 x since you last talked about it. I think ETH BTC is down about 10%. So that was good. But just wanted to catch up and see how you're feeling about the markets and your calls.
00:01:40.717 - 00:01:44.613, Speaker B: I mean, are you selling any Tao here? Are you buying ETH btc?
00:01:44.709 - 00:01:59.379, Speaker A: Thanks guys. Like I said, good to be back. This is, is hands down my favorite crypto podcast and I guess crypto trading podcast. Yeah. So those, those last two calls. Yeah, one worked out well. I'm sure we'll, we'll talk about t.
00:01:59.379 - 00:02:37.423, Speaker A: Kind of on the, you know, for, on the show. Not, not really doing anything with my Tao position. I think there's, yeah, there's, there's kind of a lot to discuss there, but don't, don't really feel the need to do anything now. It kind of has some remnants of some of the stronger coins that, you know, went on these big, you know, trending moves sort of last year around this time around October 2023. Obviously there, there are kind of Risks there, but still, still just as bullish. And then, yeah, EPTC is, is an interesting one. Definitely got that wrong.
00:02:37.423 - 00:03:09.423, Speaker A: I think actually I remember listening back to that podcast. Jonah said Ethan was kind of his Trump trade. And I think that's actually just played out, you know, really, really spot on. Right. Obviously, as I guess confidence in a landslide victory has waned, so has kind of eptc. And there are obviously structural things I think that happened at that time with just people obviously sitting in stale positions because of the eptf and that not really going as well as everyone planned. Again, not to sound like a breaking record at these levels.
00:03:09.423 - 00:03:39.079, Speaker A: I do think it's tough not to be somewhat constructive. Just psychological 0.04. It's kind of, you know, even the most vocal kind of EPTC Bear one of my good friends, you know, even in 2023, early 23, he sort of laid out the exact kind of eth bear thesis of everything that would unravel with the whole modular vision, how it was never supposed to be marketed as money. And we actually spoke today, funny enough, and yeah, was kind of like 0.04 was always what I was looking for. But I do think it's nuanced. The election, you know, plays a big role.
00:03:39.079 - 00:03:40.631, Speaker A: So we'll talk about that, I'm sure.
00:03:40.743 - 00:04:24.663, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean I, I definitely want to get into some of the, some of the nuances of both Tao and Eth with you and also see what else, you know, you've been looking at. But before we dive into all of those minutia of those. Those two ecosystems and more, you're at token 2049. That was the talk of the town on crypto Twitter. Neither Avi nor I made it out there. Can you kind of, can you kind of tell us what happened, what your general takeaways were and what you think it, you know, give us the pulse of the crypto market right now. This sounds like a really like people were more excited about this conference and more vocal about it than they have been about many conferences this year, if not all of them.
00:04:24.769 - 00:04:53.405, Speaker A: So yeah, I thought, I mean the energy, honestly the conference was great. Obviously timing wise, it was token 2049. You know, you had F1 which just brings general business crowd together. You had B was doing the Network State or his Network State event and obviously Salana break point. You know, so the energy kind of in Singapore was, yeah, was kind of on fire. And my general takeaway, it's funny, this actually happened markets wise last year. I think we bottom around the same time.
00:04:53.405 - 00:05:38.611, Speaker A: But I think a lot of people obviously were kind of gone for the summer, doing their travels, doing whatnot. And, you know, a friend even said they, they kind of said, you know, this is almost like crypto's Davos, where if you're in crypto, you were kind of in Singapore at this time. And so I get the sense, I think a lot of people got together and, you know, really focused for the first time, where everyone's saying it's time to kind of lock in for the fall. And you kind of got the sense that, you know, a lot of interesting things are being built. There are a lot of smart people in this space, you know, despite what you might see on CT or kind of glean from all like the meme coin discussions. And the other thing I noticed too is you just got a sense of how big the industry really is now. Right back in the day, kind of, you know, 2017, 2018, you go to conferences and it would be a lot of the same people.
00:05:38.611 - 00:05:57.039, Speaker A: You know, now there's. There's so many different side events, so many different even sectors. You just realize how big the space is and how many new entrants there are here, you know, building new cool stuff. So, yeah, I had a great time. I think I'm feeling super like, I guess, energetic after that. And I think most people that were there probably feel the same as well.
00:05:57.087 - 00:06:06.359, Speaker C: You mentioned people are building cool, interesting shit. Can you maybe touch on a couple of, couple of projects or ideas that you heard out there that, that were kind of exciting to you?
00:06:06.487 - 00:06:28.505, Speaker A: One, one event, not to sound like it's like a broken record, but one event that it definitely did stand out. There was a like a bit Tensor agent meetup, which was. I just thought it was a very high signal. No real like traders in the room. Just mainly, you know, sub developers, some. Some kind of investors like DCG had a presence and it just felt like, had a real good community feel to it. No frills, just technical discussion.
00:06:28.505 - 00:06:49.729, Speaker A: There were a lot of like decentralized AI sort of side events as well. That's kind of where I mainly focused my time. I didn't actually go to the conference itself. Just a lot of these, a lot of these side events, but some cool stuff happening in the social world. A lot of excitement like, about RWAs deep in. I did stop by Salon at Breakpoint. Honestly, the energy there was, was super strong.
00:06:49.729 - 00:07:09.791, Speaker A: You could just see like a lot of new faces. Big, big focus on consumer apps. I was kind of meaning to go through some of the talks on the, on the YouTube channel, obviously fire Dancer was presented as well. I think there's a non voting client that's live on mainnet now. Definitely a lot of excitement in the, in the Solana, you know, ecosystem as well.
00:07:09.903 - 00:07:40.655, Speaker B: Yeah, one, one thing that people were, were talking about a lot, the performance of the SUIs and SES and these all L1s of the world that are competing for Salana spot. I know. Was it Se or Su always get them confused. One of them had a big event at Token. Did you get a sense for how real that is? Because I know a lot of that is driven by Asia and their, their, their focus is there. So I don't know if that, that bled through. Like there's maybe a growing up breadth in the industry as well.
00:07:41.195 - 00:08:04.525, Speaker A: Yeah. So I actually did miss. I did miss SUI Builder day. That was an event that I wanted to go to that I wasn't able to. I can't say that I heard specific chatter about it. Obviously people kind of were talking about like, like Token price and whatnot. And funny enough, SUI did actually hold strong against what, you know, was typically a pretty, you know, good top indicator.
00:08:04.525 - 00:08:20.905, Speaker A: Right. When a project usually got Steve Aoki play at one of their events. I think there's been two historical times usually marks a local top, but it looks like. So we powered through. I think they had him playing at marquee for an event which also I was not able to make. But you know, some, some real strength there if it's able to get past the Steve Aoki curse.
00:08:22.325 - 00:08:42.465, Speaker B: That's true. A lot of people are talking about selling that as the. All right, this got to be the top. This has got to be the top. And honestly, historically it's been pretty accurate that conferences mark crypto tops. It's like you get like a small, small pump in the conference, then everyone, everyone sells off. And Token has seemed to beat that curse.
00:08:42.465 - 00:09:07.947, Speaker B: But I think it's also just because people are just. You're so mentally beaten over the last, over the summer. I think you just got smacked around so hard and everyone's been conditioned now to sell every rip. I mean, Joan and I have been talking on every podcast. All right, we're in a ranging market. We're in a ranging market, we're in a range market. And at some point you have to think to yourself, all right, are we ready to trend? So I wanted to get your take on that.
00:09:07.947 - 00:09:15.935, Speaker B: Do you think that we're. We're ready to trend? Do you think this is still a ranging market? Are we still selling rips, buying dips, or we're just holding tight.
00:09:16.635 - 00:10:11.617, Speaker A: I think we're, I think we've just kind of transitioned into a hold tight mode. I think majors can maybe chop around a little bit longer, right? You maybe have some front running of this October meme where we might need to just. I really don't see any like, big, big downside in BTC and like sustained, big downside. Obviously intraday flushes can happen and yeah, again, maybe, right, you get, you had some front running of October and maybe you get a flush into it where people are like, oh, look, it didn't really pan out, but I do think we're kind of there. I am the hard, the hard part with having confidence in this view and I actually think the alt setup is a bit more interesting. The election is sort of, we're looking at, we're pretty much a month out. You obviously have a lot of people that are using the election as kind of their selling point to decide whether or not they want to allocate.
00:10:11.617 - 00:10:50.109, Speaker A: I tend to think the market is not really going to give people that chance to say, okay, from here until election day, prices just aren't going to move and then you're going to have a really easy shot at obviously Trump winning. You know, that's good for crypto. Kamala wins. That's, that's kind of bad for crypto. What I, what I, what I do think is interesting also is, you know, obviously Alta performed pretty well into, into today for the last couple weeks. You know, the dominant theme from people is that obviously the biggest risk for crypto is Kamala winning. And combo winning would be specifically bad for all coins.
00:10:50.109 - 00:11:55.381, Speaker A: Like, that would be the worst outcome for all coins. And the way that all coins at least are moving now and obviously with polls widening in Kamala's favor, to me, I almost, I'm kind of playing around with this idea and I'm almost like 60, 40 on it from a confidence level is that I almost think the trade might be to be longer alts and especially these like utility alts. And to me, as I, I would express that just with crypto AI coins is you almost want to be long alts into the election. And then I'm kind of toying with the idea that if Trump wins, that's actually the trigger for majors to go vertical, right? Because if you think about the two camps that drive big price moves with Majors, obviously it is these ETF flows, it is these instos, it's these big pockets of money and they're just far more disciplined and they probably will actually wait until you get this election outcome. And it just takes so much more money to move majors as opposed to alts, right, where you could have crypto native capital say, hey, you know, it's decentralized AI fall, right. And I need to be allocated to the sector. And it takes so little capital to move these assets.
00:11:55.381 - 00:12:33.717, Speaker A: And they might want to, they might want to wait for the election outcome, but they're also watching this market every day. They're kind of prima bullish, this asset class. And if majors are kind of range bound and Audi, we talked about this for like years, right? You know, range bound markets for majors are great for altcoins when the environment is right. And it almost feels like that's the setup here where everyone right now is kind of hiding out, majors being like, you know, I'm safe here, I'm safe in bitcoin. I'll make more moves around the election and I'm just going to avoid alts because, you know, if Kamala wins, the story's over. It almost feels like from a positioning perspective, certain alt sectors will do well. Like, I think dispersion continues.
00:12:33.717 - 00:12:41.691, Speaker A: Like it's been all cycle and then the election might be the trigger for majors. But I still think majors can, you know, grind, chop up higher.
00:12:41.843 - 00:13:13.715, Speaker C: I mean, we, we've been talking on this podcast for nine months about keep it tight, consolidate line items, like, roll into the majors, get rid of your crappy positions. And so far we've been dead right. Like BTC dominance has just been up only like basically since December 2022. And, and it's. I think the end is near for that trade. I agree with you, Chief. I think I've sounded like a BTC maximalist for a long time, even though I'm not.
00:13:13.715 - 00:13:37.445, Speaker C: But it's been the trade and it's hard to pick tops on BTC dominance. But you have a really strong point. I mean, interestingly enough, Avi, you tweeted one of the wisest things I've read in a while this week. You wrote, a lot of people focus on finding assets that make sense in this world. The reality is a lot more simple. Find the sector. Find the best asset in that sector and wait.
00:13:37.445 - 00:14:02.415, Speaker C: And you know, it's kind of amazing that we've got the Chief on the show this week because he picked AI. He picked the best asset within AI and that asset has just gone parabolic while the rest of the space has been ranging that it does feel like we're going to see A few more of those, doesn't it?
00:14:02.835 - 00:15:12.007, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, I mean, 100 and just one, one thing on that tweet, I was stepping back and just looking at the bearishness that I had held over the last few months and over the summer where I said I was cautious, cautious, cautious going into the election and then post the 50 bit rate cut, you have to sit there and think to yourself, well, what is the market actually going to let participants do? Everyone and their mother has been saying, okay, let's wait for the election and then we can make decisions. It's kind of exactly what Chiefing was just saying, we'll wait for the election. But why would the market give you that optionality? I mean, we've sold off a reasonable amount and all coins took pretty massive drawdowns from the March highs. There's an argument to be made that if Donald Trump gets elected and altcoins are up 100, 200, 300% in that scenario versus Kamala gets elected and they're down another 30, there's a pretty massive asymmetry and nobody was allocated. So then the pain trade becomes up at that point. And that's kind of what we saw, especially post the 55th rate cut. It's like that, that sort of gave the market juice.
00:15:12.007 - 00:16:05.783, Speaker B: And the other thing is that equity markets push the highs. And the crypto market, every market is just a microcosm of another market, right? When bitcoin goes up, money flows to alts. Same's true with the crypto market as a whole. When equities push the highs, money flows to crypto, it flows down the risk risk spectrum, right? So now what I think we're looking at is we're looking at a pretty good environment for this stuff. And what your first question should be is, well, where, where are people going to allocate, right? Like what are, what are people going to push all their, push all their chips into when the question is, hey, I just want to allocate to higher risk stuff and I want to make a general bet on the general market. They're going to allocate to BTC and then to the best sectors and they're probably not even going to do that much research. They're going to just pick the best consensus, right? It's like the consensus horses are going to get the allocations in the beginning.
00:16:05.783 - 00:16:15.855, Speaker B: So that's why I tweeted that is because this is just the market environment to put your chips on the table in the areas that you think are going to get attention. If the Market goes up.
00:16:16.275 - 00:17:32.397, Speaker A: One thing I'll also add to my I guess previous idea too is so far in this, I guess cycle, if you want to call it, there's I think really only been one time where you've had maybe a couple times where you've had just like a very, very strong vacuum created by BTC and majors. Obviously like Seoul, that run was like a vacuum where just liquidity from the entire space was going into one asset. And then when BTC broke all time highs, you know, the way that thing was trading, it was just all liquidity was moving into btc. And so if this scenario plays out where you know, olds, you know, they are putting in 2, 3x moves from the bottom into the election and then all of a sudden, you know, BTC goes on the back of a Trump win. I think there's a good odds that that becomes liquidity vacuum. And then, you know Avi, we've seen this markets many times, right? Anytime alts go crazy, people are obviously sitting on crazy UPNL and you know, the thought of them missing out on like a parabolic bitcoin move is enough for them to be like, all right, I'm taking profit and you know, I want to move back into the, into the fastest horse. This would almost be the scenario I think that obviously I hate when people use like Max Payne, but I do get the sense, I do think the market right now is obviously overweight majors and underweight alts.
00:17:32.397 - 00:17:45.345, Speaker A: But the game with alts is just so much harder than it used to be, right. Because there is less money in the space and so there's just more dispersion. But if you are able to actually pick the sector correctly, obviously that's kind of how you produce alpha in this environment.
00:17:46.005 - 00:18:20.821, Speaker C: I mean you could pick a few sectors and just pick the strongest horse in the sector for each of them per obvious kind of, you know, system that he tweeted out his thought process or philosophy or whatever you want to call it. So we could say like for AI, it's probably Tao. I'll hand it to Tao. I mean I have my doubts about Tao. I own a little bit because you know, we did a show about it and I wanted to get involved but I don't know nearly enough. I still think it's the strongest horse and I in defi hard to pick anything stronger than Ave in Deepen. I don't know Helium love it, but it always kind of disappoints.
00:18:20.821 - 00:18:54.655, Speaker C: But if D pin goes helium is going to be the one that goes crazy. You Know, I know there's some hype around gaming and a few other sectors, but I think between those three, between aave, Helium and Tao, you're like, if, if that's what, if that's what's in your altcoin suitcase, you're probably okay for if the pain trade is up, right? If there's an up upwards pain trade. Now, the only pain trades I've ever seen in crypto have been down, but if there isn't, if there is an upward pain trade, I think you're okay with those three in your cycle.
00:18:55.395 - 00:19:47.575, Speaker B: There's also a little bit of, there's just a little bit more nuance to that, to that statement, which is when you're allocating to crypto, a lot of people, especially when once you get moves like this, they think to themselves, well, let me try to find the catch up trade. And the answer almost always is you don't waste your time doing that. Just buy the thing that's going up, buy the thing that's working. And that tends to outperform. I mean, I think there's just a power law here, right? If you find a specific area that you like, invest 80% in the thing that is working and 20% moonshots. But in general you end up pretty sad when you try to chase a sector like, let's say DeFi, like RIPS and AAVE is doing the best. Try to chase though, like chase other things is probably worse than just buying aave.
00:19:48.595 - 00:20:44.391, Speaker A: I think that's actually exactly. That was a thought I had when I saw Avi's tweet and I was actually going to send it to you both where a lot of times when an asset really does start to trend, or let's say it has its wi fi type moment, I do think in this market diversification becomes a meme. You know, you want to diversify for, you know, a couple reasons. Obviously you might have like concentration limits or you know, you never want to go all in. But in terms of, let's say an alt allocation, you might say, hey, I have my majors. And then you know, you can, you can have all of your allocation in one asset and that probably ends up being the right play. A lot of times in crypto I do think you can diversify also where you know, you have your, your kind of main pick of like, hey, this is the fastest horse and then maybe have some percentage in some ancillary names because I think when the ketchup trades actually start going crazy, that's actually a pretty good signal to get out.
00:20:44.391 - 00:20:58.361, Speaker A: Right. The, the word. The worst trades tend to pump the hardest at the end. And so it's, it's nice just to have a little bit of money in those just to keep you paying attention. And when they start going haywire, it's probably time to kind of ring, ring the alarms.
00:20:58.553 - 00:21:34.583, Speaker C: So let me ask you guys a question. You know, we had, we caught a little preview of things going parabolic and then right back down earlier this year with the meme coin bubble. For me, the top signal in memes was when you had people basically revising their targets much, much higher on absolute nonsense reasons. You know, we're starting to see a little bit of that. Like people were like, oh, whiff is going to, you know, $100 per token. Because after the sphere is done.
00:21:34.639 - 00:21:35.727, Speaker A: It has a hat, Jonah.
00:21:35.791 - 00:21:58.883, Speaker C: Yeah, because it has a hat. Exactly right. So I'm like, I think that's when you generally like when the greed, that's how you see the greed is on crypto Twitter and people just start revising their targets like way too high after a huge rally. I don't know, what do you guys think? How do you pick the top in one of those parabolic moves? I, I always, I suck at that. I tend to get out way too early.
00:21:58.979 - 00:22:36.075, Speaker B: I don't, I don't know if it's personally, for me it's never been about picking the, picking the pico top and I think it's very difficult to do that. It's just about making money and trying, trying your best to choose the points at which you're allowing yourself to maximize. The fact fact that crypto does tend to produce 10 x's and then the way that I do it is like whenever you get, I mean, I know, I know you chiefing, you keep a list of top indicators that you refer to and when a bunch of them hit, it's probably time to take a lot of profit. There, there's a lot, there's a lot that you can learn from the past. I mean if Katy Perry paints her nails, if it's probably a good sign to get out.
00:22:36.235 - 00:23:06.139, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I mean I'm, I'm with AMI on this generally. Like it's, I think it's a pure ego game to think you're going to call it perfectly. So I mean, I think there's a couple, there's a, there's a couple of strategies. You know, you can just slow sell slowly on the way up. You can wait for a clear blow off moment and then you know, in crypto at Least with majors, things tend to kind of distribute a little bit. Obviously Vol is a bit lower so you have time. But yeah, I like to keep a list of both like qualitative and quantitative indicators.
00:23:06.139 - 00:23:45.055, Speaker A: On the quantitative side, like looking at quarterly basis is always just a good one. Right. Because that just shows you the general financing rates in crypto. I think in March we peaked out, I want to say BTC hit 36% or like mid-30s, low-30s, which just in this environment with how, I guess how many players are now kind of plugged in or have infrastructure to take advantage of that basis. People paying 30% a year to long Bitcoin, it's kind of hard to justify that. You know, again like funding rates as well. You can look at funding rates kind of across, you know, obviously binance, bit more sophisticated players.
00:23:45.055 - 00:24:03.989, Speaker A: You look at places like Bybit, the kind of venues of more retail traders look at divergences there obviously like you know, big volume spikes, especially when calls you, goes haywire. You know, that's, that's a good, a good area. Any like big volume blow offs from the qualitative side too.
00:24:04.037 - 00:24:12.269, Speaker C: Like you know, MVRVZ without before you get to qualitative MVR vt. But that's more for like the, that's like big cycle, big cycle stuff.
00:24:12.317 - 00:24:48.089, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, well, like easy, you know, quality on the qualitative side. Honestly, without fail, you know, I don't know how social people in crypto are, but if you're, you know, a semi social person, you know, people from the outside world will be reaching out to you asking, you know, what coins to buy. Like I had, there were two notable texts that I received. I actually put them on Twitter and if you put them on a chart, they are within like I think three to five days at the top. I got one from this girl I know from New York. She said, hey, are you in crypto still in crypto? I said, yes. And she says, hey, what coins do I buy? What's hot right now? I don't respond.
00:24:48.089 - 00:25:06.947, Speaker A: I leave her unread. She follows up again asking what coins to buy with exclamation marks, obvious top signal. I get a text from a friend who I haven't spoken to in years. He says, hey, or have you been trading Solana meme coins lately? Let me know if you have any picks. And then says, hope you've been good by the way. Right. The gall of this guy that followed up, follow up.
00:25:06.947 - 00:25:23.751, Speaker A: I hate salon meme coins, but I hope you've been good. You know, celebrities coming in Obviously the celeb coin meta was, was kind of a clear picture, but anytime you start to see just these like levels of grift and greed, you know, go up, it's never a bad time just to take some profit.
00:25:23.823 - 00:25:51.585, Speaker C: Okay, so now that we have the chief things, top indicators, everybody go follow at chiefing's on Twitter to try and see when people start texting him all sorts of FOMO craziness. But now that we've covered picking tops, let's talk about election night. Are you going to be like staying up all night, chief, to like, if it looks like Trump's going to win, are you just going to be hoovering bitcoin or like, is this not something that you can actively trade? You kind of have to be in or out ahead of it.
00:25:52.365 - 00:26:45.065, Speaker A: So funny enough, this actually came from a friend. This isn't an original idea. You know, you likely see another red mirage on election night, right? Because so many of the mail in ballots, you know, that are going to go, those are going to go blue, those are going to be counted obviously during nighttime eastern time. And so you may have the big media houses kind of calling for a big Trump victory just because a lot of the early voting is going to skew in his favor. So what's interesting is if you do have this red mirage, you probably get this kind of euphoric moment in crypto where people are like, all right, we have confidence Trump is going to win. You know, slide the leverage bar to the right, you know, let's go all in. That effect might be negated actually a little bit, just because now you have poly market, such a deep market, if you have venues for smart money to place bets and they might be like, hey, we obviously know that the early indications are going to be in Trump's favor.
00:26:45.065 - 00:27:31.585, Speaker A: You know, if you got that, if you got that, I would actually say that's like a tactical, a tactical sell for, you know, your trading portfolio, not your long term positions. Yeah, I haven't really thought about it too much in terms of what I would, what I would do. It really depends kind of how we get there. So, you know, I guess in the instance that I described, let's say alts do really, really well into the election. I would probably start looking to rotate some of those over into, into majors, maybe like equal weight, you know, BTC Seoul. And then again, it really depends on what happens going in. If markets are going up and Trump wins.
00:27:31.585 - 00:28:14.075, Speaker A: I'm probably not really doing a whole lot just because the market I think probably front ran it and I do think the market is going to be horny for a Trump victory and is going to be looking for kind of any sign and I don't imagine there's going to be any new data between now and election night, I think, and I think polls probably fluctuate. I think Harris is hopefully probably topping out around here. We'll kind of see. I still think Trump wins. So yeah, it kind of depends on how we get there. Obviously if Harris does win, I think I would, I would look to hedge the portfolio with, with shorts. You know, right now, off the top of my head, I'd say probably even soul, just because you need the most liquid kind of all representations.
00:28:14.075 - 00:28:43.313, Speaker A: But I do think it's going to be a volatile time and I do, I, I do get the sense it's going to chop a lot of people up. So I'm, I'm kind of looking to see what happens as we go in and it might just make sense just to increase your, like, you know, your task position going in especially things have done well and then maybe even give it some time post election to see. But if, if things are quite muted and Trump does win, you know, I think, I think BTC does go, I think BTC goes parabolic. I think it'd be hard for it not to.
00:28:43.409 - 00:29:18.409, Speaker C: I agree with you. I think it's going to be hard for BTC to go parabolic on election night even if Trump does win. Like, I think that you could see like, let's, let's say you go into election night and it's trading, you know, kind of, I don't know where it is now, 63 and a half. Right? So let's just say it's there on election night. I could see it trading 70 or 75 on a Trump win. I think that's still like, I don't think, I don't really see it going too far above that night of. And I still think that's a screaming, screaming buy.
00:29:18.409 - 00:29:55.397, Speaker C: So coming from somebody who does not like to trade like event trade or especially preplanned event trading, like, I think it's a fool's game. I just don't think that the, the night of the election when markets are shut, like Trad 5 markets are shut, so your trad derivatives markets are closed, your trad guys who are going to be buying this the next day are going to be sitting at home watching the election with their families. Like, I think there's going to be an opportunity for us crypto natives to like lift, lift every, every token that's out there, you know, just, just, just.
00:29:55.421 - 00:30:28.315, Speaker B: Talking, just talking out loud for a second. Because you said that the markets are closed. There's an argument to be made that bitcoin will be the election trade. And so on the night of a Trump win you just get everyone slamming btc. And even if there is a, even, even if Trump does win, it just overcorrects to the upside because people, once the market opens will sell out some of their bitcoin which was the trade at the moment, the liquidity at the moment. They sell out some and then that's probably a dip to buy if you get it. Just, just talking out loud.
00:30:28.895 - 00:31:16.913, Speaker A: It does feel like crypto. I don't, I have, I haven't really been doing much of a trading for a while but it felt like at least when crypto was like, you know, when everyone was paying attention to CPI, at least like 30, 15 minutes before, like price just wouldn't really move right? Like everyone is just kind of waiting for it. So I, I, I can almost imagine on election night again assuming no new information. You know, BTC is just like, it's just not really moving much and, and people are waiting for, for any bit of news. You know, I'm not, I'm not really like a election expert so I don't know what, I don't know what, what the earliest point that we might have market moving news. But I do think at some points I think, I think BTC is just, it's just going to keep going up for a while. It'll be like when Elon, you know, announced his bitcoin buys.
00:31:16.913 - 00:31:32.185, Speaker A: Like we, that day we had so many short squeezes like per basis was roofed and you know a lot of times you'd see that, you'd be like, oh, I can't really buy here, it's too juice. But it just, it just kept going. It's just one of those moments where you're just, just get long, walk away. Like it's going higher. Like you don't need to look at your charts for a while.
00:31:32.565 - 00:31:42.665, Speaker C: Chief, what tools do you use to monitor all these indicators that keep you plugged in and with your finger on the pulse of the majors, I guess.
00:31:43.365 - 00:32:05.955, Speaker A: I mean obviously mentioned it, I mean is definitely the best one. I think that's honestly the most, most all encompassing. Obviously. Twitter is a great tool I've been using. I've been playing around with Kaido recently. It's just good, a good way to kind of get like these high level summaries on it's. Kind of sentiment reading but you're able to get information like tweets about a project pretty easily.
00:32:05.955 - 00:32:22.729, Speaker A: I think that's really it. I mean Coin Analyze has some good data. Like I know, I think today a lot of people were posting about like aggregate Altcoin. Oi, I don't think V has that yet. VO if you guys are listening, please add that. But yeah, Velo honestly has. Has the most things you need.
00:32:22.857 - 00:32:28.649, Speaker C: Okay, that's super helpful. Just, you know, here at the Thousand X podcast we're all about process.
00:32:28.777 - 00:32:38.121, Speaker B: So aggregate, aggregate. Altcoin is actually an interesting one that I haven't looked at in a while just because alts have been so dead. But how's it, how's it looking right now?
00:32:38.233 - 00:33:07.447, Speaker A: So this is reaching multi month highs. So I think we peaked this morning at around 13 billion, which was the highest, close to the high that we reached in late July and then adjusted for market cap. Yeah, I mean so we read it's not, it's not that high but it's kind of at, it's almost out of the resistance. Resistance point. If you assume that we're still range round. Which is, which is kind of a question, you know, at large here that I think everyone's trying to answer. You know, it's obviously gone up.
00:33:07.447 - 00:33:24.155, Speaker A: I think we added like actually I don't know the exact number on top of my head. We added, we added a good bit, but it's not at least for this cycle on an aggregate level, on a global level like that, that insane where it's like super frothy but you know, a good bit has been added.
00:33:24.975 - 00:34:23.497, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean look, that's, that, that's one of the things that I think is hardest about this particular moment in time is figuring out whether this is a sustainable move or not. And that if it does become a sustainable move, the psychology required to go from a raging market to a trending market is where most people just completely up. Like when you go from, okay, I'm gonna start taking my 20 wins and offloading them, it's very hard to shake that because I think probably every single person that actively trades or invests at some point has round tripped P and L and then probably even gone negative. And that's just a shit feeling. Everybody, everybody hates to feel that. So if you're, if you're listening out there, love to hear some of your tricks, if you have any just like psychological tricks. But one of mine is just to, to always sell a little bit or buy a little bit.
00:34:23.497 - 00:34:43.794, Speaker B: And I'VE talked about this, I've talked about this before. Like if you're, if your position's going up, you don't have to make binary decisions. You can sell 10%, you can sell 5%, see how, see how it feels. But you kind of have to trick your brain into adjusting to the market environment. I don't know how you do that, but be kind of, kind of interesting to hear.
00:34:45.254 - 00:35:25.471, Speaker A: Honestly. I just try to have, I just try to go top down and I try to have a view and I do, I do hold the view or at least I'm allocating capital right now on the view that we did, we did just shift environments obviously talking with, with a, you know, decent amount of margin of error. Like to me like Bitcoin at 61k is still, you know, to me that we're still in an uptrend. If you want you can, you can wait right until a clean break of 65. But it also, it really depends on your time frame actually. It really depends on how your, you know, how you're kind of viewing your portfolio. Right.
00:35:25.471 - 00:35:47.295, Speaker A: Like I like to have my long term positions that I'm not really looking to touch. Like these are more like kind of macro, three to six months maybe. Three to, yeah, three to six month holds and then a more like active, active trading bucket and then that. Active bucket. Yeah, I'm kind of the same where if, if there's profit and I'm feeling kind of nervous like I'll just, I'll just take it. Right. Because in this game you really just want to survive.
00:35:47.295 - 00:36:06.437, Speaker A: There's something new happening like every, every week, every day. Right. Sui Tao, all these things are up like they're up like three times from the loans. Right. So I think it just depends on how you're, how you're kind of allocating capital. And then if you do think you're in a range bound environment. Yeah I would just be, I would just sell rips, buy dips.
00:36:06.437 - 00:36:42.053, Speaker A: I tend to not really be active in those environments because they're just kind of boring for me and tend to like, you know, chopping, choppy environments are not really where I thrive. But I do think with the broader market I do think we turn to leave. I think you have to be a little bit patient here. And so to me like right now it just separated out into like you know, kind of conviction levels. So things I have conviction, I'm just, I'm, I'm kind of sitting, letting them ride. Things that are a bit more speculative that might be kind of More technical trades. Like I, I like took profit on, on some alt propositions this morning actually when I saw that that OI move, it could go higher.
00:36:42.053 - 00:36:52.065, Speaker A: It's fine. Like, you know, we had a big move off the bottom. I'm not, I'm not like too concerned with it, but to me having that extra cash buffer also lets me like buy the high conviction names. Should we get a dip?
00:36:53.605 - 00:37:37.995, Speaker C: Should we? Obviously your highest conviction name right now is Tao. Very few people in the market have been as long and as vocal as you on that one. Should we, you know, take where. I guess we're nearing the sort of third act of this podcast here. Should we take some time to debate that and try to understand the thesis a little bit? Because I think it's, it's an important asset for the space right now and it's also controversial and we need to like maybe try to poke some holes in it to try and understand what's going on. Because it is the first major alt, like kind of major cap alt breakout that isn't just another alt L1 trade. It's like the first real alt to do something in a while.
00:37:37.995 - 00:38:00.807, Speaker C: I guess you kind of went through your thesis in depth on the previous podcast that you were on with us. But like I guess could you recap it like the elevator pitch for it and then tell us why? Like what are the developments? What are the catalysts that you expect to keep driving this uptrend?
00:38:00.991 - 00:38:49.429, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So I mean the also within the high level thesis there's like two components. There's like a fundamental component and then there's like a more I guess like markets structural component. And I think, I think the latter is playing out and the latter is actually always going to be more important. Like this is obviously a training podcast. Like you know, price always, always drives narrative and I think there are structural forces that have always been supporting the price. Yeah, but on the fundamental side, the whole notion for this, this protocol is that it's, it's an incentive system, this incentive game to drive the kind of creation of better open source AI models that hopefully over time can obviously compete with the likes of, you know, OpenAI or ChatGPT.
00:38:49.429 - 00:39:37.869, Speaker A: Claude. I guess llama is technically open source, but you know, Llama Mistrual does and I think more recently where a lot of the excitement has been generated is that the incentive system is working. I've tweeted about it a good bit, but the quality of teams building subnets and just generally building dev tooling the ecosystem is noticeably higher. This Time last year I think there were two or four subnets. I think we're pushing into the 50s. Now not all are great, actually most are bad, but you can just see the quality increasing. And as the protocol is designed to do, the kind of shittier subnets are getting weeded out and losing incentives and the more productive subnets are gaining in kind of market share and they're getting more control of TAO itself.
00:39:37.869 - 00:40:51.379, Speaker A: And I do think where the reason sort of why this is so controversial is, you know, an incentive system on its own is like it is this meta concept, right? But I think this is actually what blockchains have always sort of been good for, right? You have, you know, what a blockchain really does is it says, you know, because of these strong cryptographic guarantees, we can guarantee you property rights. And everyone now playing in this game can have full faith that these property rights will stick and the rules of the game are going to be hard to change. And then with that belief, the way that people operate is just different, right? So when the incentive is strong, you can get people to operate in a certain way for some desired outcome. And the desired outcome of the system is just better AI models, which I think we can all agree would be better for the world if you kind of had this open source community, you know, building alternatives to the open AIs of the world. And my general take also on decentralized AI is regardless of if you think it can compete with the likes of, you know, OpenAI and Microsoft, it's going to get built regardless. Like the, what's the phrase, you know, Pandora's box is kind of already open. We're going to create the system.
00:40:51.379 - 00:41:13.313, Speaker A: It's for sure it's going to rival the centralized world in some respects, probably fail amongst a lot of vectors, but it's going to be an alternative in the same way, the same way DEFI is an alternative, traditional finance, it's obviously worse off in a lot of ways. You know, this decentralized AI ecosystem is going to exist and people will, are going to keep building there and they'll keep gravitating towards it purely because it exists.
00:41:13.409 - 00:42:01.833, Speaker C: So first of all, that's a big if, right? Like if decentralized incentives can build better models than centralized ones or even like quasi centralized open source ones like llama. That's. We don't know that. So it's kind of a VC bet that that's going to happen. But if it does happen, obviously ecosystems like Bittensor will be enormous. There's some delta you assign to that maybe it's 50, 50, maybe it's lower. But like the beauty of crypto is that unlike traditional sort of like trad VC where you can't trade in and out of your startup equity as hype ebbs and ebbs and flows, you know, crypto does give you these tremendous 10 to 100 Xers between, you know, when you put the trade on and you know, five years down the road when you know whether your thesis is right or not.
00:42:01.833 - 00:42:48.301, Speaker C: So I totally buy your idea that you know, to use commodities speak, the curve is in contango. The price of the future for Bittensor is much higher than the present because of that idea that decentralized models might matter. And in the meantime you can sort of trade that volatility and eke out a pretty substantial profit, especially if you're convicted. But one thing I wanted to bring up to you, I read a really fascinating article in the Economist yesterday. The latest one is all about AI and the microchip ecosystem behind it. I'm super interested in that and studying it. There is an article about how China can't access a lot of the GPU compute that it needs to build AI models that compete with Llama, Gemini, ChatGPT, all this other stuff.
00:42:48.301 - 00:43:59.637, Speaker C: And so they're building these sort of like skinny, you know, targeted models where you know, you ask the model one question and it'll go to a specific LLM designated for answering that type of question. Just basically like China's finding ways around the chip sanctions because they can't access Nvidia's latest and greatest. Meanwhile, I was thinking there are probably a lot of countries that have national projects like that or want national AI champions that can't access the actual silicon they need. Maybe decentralized AI will provide it for them. So I kind of thought of Bittensor in the context of geopolitical use cases similar to how bitcoin perforates these hemispheres of global trade because it's this neutral arbiter that everybody can sort of agree to use. So I could totally see, you know, maybe a third use case for Bittensor aside from it like dethroning Llama or OpenAI's latest model. It could just be like a thriving ecosystem that helps countries with difficulty accessing silicon to still get good model, well trained models into their, you know, day to day use.
00:43:59.771 - 00:44:35.741, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know if it's a way necessarily to source. I mean I guess it can be a way for these countries to source. Source compute just right. Because the miners themselves theoretically are like they're expending computing resources to run these models. So yeah, I think it plays into this any notion of kind of geographic unfettered access to AI models. Bittensor plays a role and I guess a couple is one point and I think we can move over to the more markets oriented, you know, case of the thesis. I think I forget there's one.
00:44:35.741 - 00:44:57.139, Speaker A: I think it's Wembo. I forgot what subnet they're, they're working on. I think, I think maybe it's called dippy. But you know they had, they had a miner produce LM outputs that were scoring you know, higher on this like EQ I guess standardized EQ scale. It was beating I think like llama 3.5. Right. And these are just like indie developers.
00:44:57.139 - 00:45:50.883, Speaker A: And I don't think you can, I think it'd be probably disingenuous to assume that you're going to have these, you know, random open source AI engineers in their mom's basement that are creating better models than you know, OpenAI. But again I think it's that, I think it's the fact that alternative will always exist and creating such a bounty for, I mean you can think of it too, right? Like within, within AI like startups like there's no real chance for someone to compete with, with OpenAI, right. Just because of the scale they're afforded. And so Bittensor does it is pretty much kind of funding that or covering that resource cost for a lot of developers, right. It makes it much more easier for them to, to build these models. It covers a lot of their kind of almost go to market and that's like you're seeing like startups, you know, like Inference labs, right. They like launch a subnet on Bit Tensor as a way to kind of bootstrap their companies and bootstrap their growth.
00:45:50.883 - 00:46:54.431, Speaker A: And I think I'll keep going but I guess also transitioning over to the more market side of this. And again probably what is happening now and obviously the narrative is kind of following price, right. Retail doesn't really have many ways to get exposure to AI. Like sure there are a number of stocks obviously Nvidia, Microsoft, some smaller names but you know that under 1 billion kind of valuation is really, really hard for the, the more risk on or you know, people who want to be visionary investors and crypto obviously offers, you know, offers them that path and within that if you kind of look at sort of what, what's like what's available. You know, Bittensor is really the only one that like has this big, big picture vision of building something that, you know is for the greater good and building something that can be long lasting. And it really actually is forming into kind of a true, you know, decentralized community. I don't think many projects both within that sector and within the space can sort of say that, right? So it's easy to kind of dream big about this.
00:46:54.431 - 00:47:48.485, Speaker A: And also pointing to what you said, right? Like crypto markets tend to almost like fully price, fully price in, you know, the, like the full potential of a project in a, in a really short amount of time, right? Like crypto markets, they go from like extreme like euphoria and being like, this is the future, this is going to work. You know, they tend to should be valued the same as open AI, which obviously right now it shouldn't be. And then they obviously swing back to kind of that extreme. So you're playing a bit on the inefficiency of the crypto market with this thesis. Even if you do, let's say you don't even think the fundamental case makes any sense, right? You're like, nah, this token's worthless, right? There's no incentive if there's no moneyness or value to the token. Even though that's obvious something that's gonna be worked on. But you can still be like left curve, AI, AI go up, let me long.
00:47:48.485 - 00:48:10.983, Speaker A: Kind of the best coin in the market. And there was a good, a couple others. There was some good kind of tweets. This is actually posted at like, you know, high threes. You know, the stake rate of this is obviously super high. You know, it is. You're not really locked, but you can just kind of feel with it, with, with Tao right now it's just kind of going through a bit of a supply squeeze, right.
00:48:10.983 - 00:48:50.115, Speaker A: The first run we went from like 50 to 800 and then, you know, we, we kind of ranged from 200 to 300 for, I don't know, four to five months. Right. So the cost basis of all the new people that got in is just much higher than it was before. And the levels that they're kind of looking at to take profit are obviously much higher than the previous set of holders. And from also what I understand, there was like a big fund that sold a lot down because they were raising a new fund and they want to show dpi and they're obviously kind of out of tokens at this point. There also were a couple of good tweets. I mean, I mentioned the meetup in Singapore.
00:48:50.115 - 00:49:19.665, Speaker A: I just felt like strong community feel, you know, grassroots, no Frills like that I think is shining through. And there's like a good tweet. I don't know if this is really true, but it says all my AI smartest friends at SF are working on Bittensor during the weekends, quote, Paradigm Back founder and Dai who will remain nameless. Probably nothing. There's actually truth to this. Like, I've had a number of friends in the valley who were just tinkering, running miners on Bitten. Sir.
00:49:19.665 - 00:50:14.981, Speaker A: One is actually gearing up to launch a subnet. And I think it was Chris Dixon who, like, you know, when he was saying why he got interested in crypto early, he was like, just follow, follow what these developers are doing, you know, when they're off their thing jobs and they're at home or over the weekend, like, look at what they're playing around with. Right? A lot of these things kind of start off as a, as a toy that you don't really understand. But that's kind of the beauty of like these decentralized networks is that they are networks at the end of the day, right? There is this big social layer and they can evolve based on what the community wants. To me, I think this repricing is just one obviously this market driven thing of, hey, we want to get exposure to crypto AI, but then the other part of it is this fundamental case, but also the social layer, the community that's being built around. If people are like, all right, there's some really, really smart people here tackling some very, very hard problems and you're seeing early signs of it actually working and that dealing crypto and such a dearth of innovation is obviously super exciting. And I think you're seeing that just.
00:50:15.013 - 00:50:47.655, Speaker B: To, just to add to that little bit right there in terms of fulfilling, fulfilling expectations. It's also about like, where the expectations are. I just saw the news that open leadership is kind of falling apart right now. And it's just a reminder that, yes, crypto is new, but AI is also new. And we're not exactly sure how anything is going to pan out. We don't know what the upper limit for either of these two sectors are. And so that makes it even more fun to bet on these things gone to 100 billion and WHO knows where because we don't even know what the right model is yet.
00:50:47.655 - 00:50:53.835, Speaker B: So there's no way to say, oh, Tao's the wrong model. We just don't even know.
00:50:54.615 - 00:51:29.577, Speaker A: And even OpenAI at this 150 billion round, which apparently is like, demand is through the roof, I think 250mil is like the minimum check, right? Like people on the surface might be, oh, they're making this much in monthly revenue. But you know, theoretically inference will probably replace search. Will probably replace search. You know, what's Google worth? Like 150 billion in hindsight might turn out to be, you know, really, really low. Right. And so, you know, those valuation caps go up, obviously crypto kind of will follow. I, I think honestly in crypto I think the magic number on a circulating basis is $20 billion.
00:51:29.577 - 00:51:54.667, Speaker A: On a circulating basis is usually, it's very, very hard to break. Very few projects break that. I think SWE is actually coming up on that. So I'm kind of interested to see where what happens with that. But I think Tao now is like 4 billion on a circulating basis. You can look at Tao maybe on a one year forward because I do think the inflation rate obviously is high until the having next year. So call it like 8 million.
00:51:54.667 - 00:52:02.319, Speaker A: I still think you have a safe. Not a safe, because you can never say that, but 2 and a half to 3x upside would not surprise me.
00:52:02.367 - 00:52:37.529, Speaker C: You know, before Google, there were a few different search engines out there. There was like AltaVista, Lycos, Yahoo and I remember, like Lycos was great for a while and everyone used it and then that, you know, air quotes model kind of became really bad relative to the others. And then people switched AltaVista and then eventually Google showed up and decimated all of them. Like, it doesn't take much for OpenAI to fall apart, right? Like all the big technologists have left. There's like internal strife. We're in the midst of the bubble. We're not quite at the SBF goes to prison moment.
00:52:37.529 - 00:53:22.975, Speaker C: Chief, you recommended Corel as having the best UI on BitTensor. And I tried it out and it was friggin amazing. So I could easily see a world where, you know, the chatbots of Bittensor suddenly one day become way better than centralized versions for this, you know, it's not the most probable world, but it's a world, right? It's possible. And you know, in that world like OpenAI goes to zero and all that value goes to Bittensor. It's possible, right? So it's still, basically my point is it's still very much an open season on dominating that market share, much like it was open in Search Engine in Search.
00:53:23.595 - 00:54:02.821, Speaker A: I think, I think that just the big picture, right? It's just super. It's super. Actually. I hate even saying this, but it is early, obviously in this network kind of evolution not saying from like a price perspective, but you know, from where the community is headed. And I think people also are getting excited about like some network upgrades and those are probably like catalysts that people are factoring into their investment decisions. Like the big one is dynamic tao. So like the kind of way that emissions are going to be calculated are going to be a more market based system and you will be able to use TAO to effectively speculate on which models are better.
00:54:02.821 - 00:54:30.551, Speaker A: Right. So imagine a world in the same way where you need SOL to speculate on meme coins. You will need now TAU to speculate on models, right? And it's a pretty cool world. If you're right and you identify a model early on, you know you'll benefit from, from that price appreciation. So that's a good one. They are moving towards some EVM support. I don't know what that's going to look like past just having Tau, you know, available on, on the EVM within DeFi.
00:54:30.551 - 00:55:10.539, Speaker A: I think there, there is some sort of smart contract component with building apps, but I'm not too sure. I know like dcg, I think they're going to be announcing some sort of like financing product somewhat soon also. I mean this is a bit more on like the ship post angle, right? The more djen side of me. But I mean Barry Silbert is shilling this thing like his life depends on it. Like he is. Oh my God, he is, he, he is pretty much comparing this thing to the early days of bitcoin, right? And, and that's thing with this asset too is it's the same supply schedule as bitcoin. Like I mentioned about the whole supply squeeze like this, this thing just feels hoarded right now, right? Like you kind of think these emissions are so high, yet prices keep staying up here.
00:55:10.539 - 00:55:49.165, Speaker A: Like you know the emissions are high but a lot of them are going too, you know, into Barry's hands, into polychain's hand. Like the big stakers who just really have no interest in selling. So assuming being like, oh, you know, the, the emission rate is really, really high, you need to do the work of how much of those emissions are actually going into hands that are just trying to sell. And there's definitely some, right, like the newest researchers of the world, these kind of indie subnet owners, they're for sure selling. But I think you know the realistically that is probably on the tune of like 20, 30 million a month. And if you look at volumes, I promise you much more than that was bought like in the last week. So I Don't think emissions are as scary as people make them out to be.
00:55:49.165 - 00:56:05.581, Speaker A: It's the same thing as the early days of bitcoin. Right. Like tops and bottoms were kind of dictated by miners. Right. Supply side, when it gets hoarded, you know, when they decide to unload, obviously that is kind of when it tops. But I just don't really see how the largest holders are looking to take profit anywhere near this level.
00:56:05.693 - 00:56:16.825, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, but they have a level, right? Like Silbert and paradigm have LPs. The LPs aren't just going to sit on their hands and say nothing if this thing doubles or triples from here. Right.
00:56:17.365 - 00:56:18.745, Speaker A: Barry doesn't have lps.
00:56:19.205 - 00:56:23.373, Speaker C: Really? I assumed that he was running some fund. I didn't realize this was a PA trade for him.
00:56:23.429 - 00:56:53.283, Speaker B: It's just accumulating. They actually put out a pretty good research report on. On Bittensor, which, which is solid and vc. VC funds. I think one, one thing that also drives them is that they can just accumulate for a very long time and just hold until they think that the project isn't working. I mean, you saw that, you saw that with Maker from a lot of the. A lot of the big VCs, because they literally held it for like half a decade until they decided it wasn't.
00:56:53.283 - 00:57:20.953, Speaker B: It just wasn't working anymore. And then they. And then they started offloading it. I mean, there's a. These guys can hold on and not sell for a very long time if need be. I think that, you know, if this does work or if it doesn't, just if it's not clear that it's dying, which it kind of was a little bit for Maker, that it just was being out competed by everything else. These guys just basically don't sell until they won the fun down, which is telegraphed most of the time.
00:57:20.953 - 00:57:22.545, Speaker B: That was a good shill fest.
00:57:24.445 - 00:57:25.461, Speaker A: Maybe, maybe we can hit.
00:57:25.493 - 00:57:28.425, Speaker B: Maybe we can hit a thousand now once we, once we release this.
00:57:28.845 - 00:57:38.773, Speaker C: I mean, luckily nothing we shill on here is financial advice. It's all just hypothetical, you know, theorizing.
00:57:38.909 - 00:57:47.305, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. And as we always say, if you listen to anything that is said on this podcast, you'll inevitably lose all of your money and end up on the street. So please don't.
00:57:47.985 - 00:58:04.113, Speaker C: Yeah, Tao just rallied a bunch. Don't buy it off chief. Sell it or don't. No, I think it's a really interesting thesis and decentralized AI is such a cool concept. It could totally work. And imagine if it did.
00:58:04.169 - 00:58:06.845, Speaker A: Oh my God, Jonah, you just got to believe in something.
00:58:09.865 - 00:58:12.045, Speaker C: Lion chasing the green lion.
00:58:12.795 - 00:58:15.375, Speaker B: All right, boys. This was a pleasure, as always.
00:58:16.555 - 00:58:20.379, Speaker C: Pleasure. Thanks for coming on, chief. Love having you. Great call.
00:58:20.427 - 00:58:21.035, Speaker A: Of course.
00:58:21.155 - 00:58:21.595, Speaker C: Great calls.
