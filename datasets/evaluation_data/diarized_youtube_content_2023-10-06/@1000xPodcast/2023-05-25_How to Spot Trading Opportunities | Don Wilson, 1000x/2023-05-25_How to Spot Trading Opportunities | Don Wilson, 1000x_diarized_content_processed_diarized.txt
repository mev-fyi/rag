00:00:00.240 - 00:00:26.954, Speaker A: Moved back to Chicago in 94. And I said, you know, if this stuff, if the CME hasn't completely transitioned to the screen by the year 2000, this place is going to be out of business. And I just couldn't have been more wrong. I couldn't have been more wrong about the timing. It took far longer than that. I think these transitions always do.
00:00:35.274 - 00:01:06.492, Speaker B: Thank you guys for joining in for another episode of the Thousand X podcast. We welcome you back. And this time we have a very special guest who has not done a lot of podcasting before, and we are very lucky to have him on. This time, actually, is the jefe of Jonah, my partner in crime. On this podcast, we have Don Wilson, the founder of DRW, joining us. And I'll let Jonah, who knows him much better than I do, courtesy of working together, give the intro.
00:01:06.588 - 00:01:09.452, Speaker C: Thanks, Avi. And thanks, Don, for joining us.
00:01:09.508 - 00:01:09.676, Speaker A: Sure.
00:01:09.700 - 00:01:56.068, Speaker C: We've got a lot of really interesting, interesting content to put out today. Don graduated from the University of Chicago and went straight into trading, right into the pit in Chicago, and in 1992, founded DRW, which is a global trading firm which touches pretty much every asset class, both prop trading and liquidity provision. So pretty exciting company at the intersection of trading and technology. Don, thank you very much for joining us. Without further ado, can you tell us what it was that drew you to trading straight out of college? How you just knew that you wanted to make that your career? The foundational stuff?
00:01:56.156 - 00:03:03.374, Speaker A: Yeah. So when I came to college, I had no idea what I wanted to do, but I knew that I was good at math, and I knew that I liked using math to solve problems. And my initial inclination was maybe I'd do something in science. And as I kind of experienced college and the academic setting a little bit, I was a little bit concerned about the very slow feedback loop that happens in academia. And I actually, I raced sailboats in high school and in college, and one of the guys that I raced with was working on his post doc did in physics. He actually went on to fly the space shuttle. But at the time, in addition to working on his postdoc, he was fiddling around with FX modeling.
00:03:03.374 - 00:03:34.234, Speaker A: I was like, that's really cool. You get this immediate feedback loop and you don't have to write a paper about it and present it and kind of not really know if you're right or wrong. You just figure something out and then go see if it works and you find out right away. That sounds like a lot of fun. And so that's when I decided that I wanted to go into trading. And obviously, being in Chicago, the trading pits were right there.
00:03:34.394 - 00:03:56.042, Speaker B: What, what was it like when you first, when you first stepped into the, stepped into the pit? I mean, what, what's actually the process that you went through of getting up to speed and figuring out how to trade? I mean, I can imagine you walk in there and it's hectic and it's crazy. I mean, how'd you, how'd you figure it all out? What, what you, what did you start with?
00:03:56.138 - 00:04:26.476, Speaker A: Yeah, so, so it was, um. So what I did was. And, you know, I graduated early. So I graduated when I was 20. And I was an extreme introvert, had a real hard time interacting with people. But I got a job with a small trading firm called Letco. And they said, okay, we'll have you spend a couple weeks standing next to different traders that work for us.
00:04:26.476 - 00:05:10.172, Speaker A: And then after six months, they said, okay, here's $100,000, good luck. And I became a member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, leased a seat, and decided to go in the euro dollar option pit, which is three month Libor options. At that point, you walk into the pit. The pit opens at 720 in the morning. It's open from 720 to two, and you, you know, find a spot to stand. And it's pretty intimidating because there's, I mean, it's super crowded. There are a bunch of people pushing and shoving, yelling and screaming.
00:05:10.172 - 00:06:28.564, Speaker A: It looks like total chaos, but the reality of it is, it's just math. And so I'd stand in the pit during the day and then go home and write code, build option pricing models, write risk software, fiddle around with different volatility, trying to model volatility surfaces, and then go back the next day and see if any of it worked. After a little while, I started to figure some things out. And my whole mindset was, how do I define the fair value of every single option across the whole surface? And then how do I then use that framework and the order flow coming into the pit to pick up small amounts of positive expected value? So that's how it all started.
00:06:29.304 - 00:06:36.136, Speaker C: Don, what's an example of something that you went home and coded and brought back into the pit the next day that just kind of worked?
00:06:36.200 - 00:07:17.854, Speaker A: Yeah. So there were a few iterations that were helpful. I mean, first of all, I had some stuff that was, I think, not all that innovative, but I designed my own sheets with all my own option values on them. I actually used an image writer two to print them, so they took hours to print. I lived in a studio apartments. I had to put a pillow on top the printer when I went to bed. Not sure all that stuff was that amazing, but it was nice to just be able to configure everything, have calls and puts in different colors and some kind of little incremental things.
00:07:17.854 - 00:08:30.860, Speaker A: And then the risk views that I developed were really pretty good. All the different scenarios and those formats were certainly much better than the just kind of off the shelf vendor things that you could buy. I think some of the places where I started to pickup valuation edges though, were when I started to think about how the volume surface evolves in the fixed income space. There was a couple, I dont know, not long after I started, they listed serial options, so short dated options on longer futures, and in this case it was like July and August options on September futures. So you'd have July, August, September. And in the fixed income space, generally, the front of the curve is less volatile than further out at the time. Typically it was the first red future.
00:08:30.860 - 00:09:38.974, Speaker A: So the future, that's just over a year out, that was the most volatile. Lately, of course, it's been further out the curve. Well, certainly in the period of low rates, it was much further out the curve, and then more recently, it's moved towards the front of the curve. That area of peak volatility evolves depending on the fed regime. But generally, almost always the front of the curve is less volatile, because of course, the Fed controls the overnight rate, and so that's relatively static unless the Fed changes it. There was this persistent volatility roll down where the front month was less volatile than the second month, was less volatile than the third month, was less volatile than the fourth month. When they listed these serial options, the July and August, the natural assumption was, well, obviously, if June volatility is 20 and September volatility is 30, then obviously July and August have to be kind of in between.
00:09:38.974 - 00:10:37.894, Speaker A: But that's completely wrong, because of course, July is alive when the September futures are more volatile than that forward period after July expires. If you just think about those volatility forwards, obviously July should trade at a much higher volatility than September, and August should trade somewhere in between the July and September, but certainly well above September as well. So that was our early realization that I had in modeling this stuff, and the market did not understand it that way at all. And that was definitely the kind of thing that gave me an edge, because I had a very clear idea of what the fair value of these things were. The market had a very different idea. Theyre pretty low variance trades. I traded a lot of those types of things.
00:10:38.514 - 00:11:13.650, Speaker B: Your trading style must have had to evolve over time, especially as we transitioned over from, you know, pit trading to electronic trading. And that transition was not managed well by a lot of people. Obviously, you being a major exception to this, you manage that transition exceptionally well. And I'm wondering what that was, what that was like, if there were any, you know, why? Why do you think you were able to make that transition effectively? And, you know, today, does coming from the pits give you edge?
00:11:13.742 - 00:12:17.634, Speaker A: You know, one of the things about, about the trading pits is that you do have this. You know, it's ingrained in you that you need to be able to price anything at any time, you know, at a moment's notice. And, you know, if you can do it in your head, you have that much more of an edge. And I think that that practice is actually still useful to this day. In March, when sofer futures had September, so for futures had 100 plus basis point range. Just kind of thinking about the volatility surface in that environment and having that really intuitive grasp of what's going on, I think that that gives you a perpetual advantage. Shortly after I started, they launched Globex, which was an electronic trading system.
00:12:17.634 - 00:13:11.058, Speaker A: And I had a pretty small operation at the time, but I was like, I definitely want to get a Globex machine. I definitely want to have a guy making markets overnight, because that's, of course, how this stuff should trade. And so I was excited about it when it first happened. It was funny. I still remember that the Globex was something that the software and hardware was actually developed by Reuters and CME licensed it. They handed out t shirts on the first day that Globex launched. And it said CME bidet on the front had a big sun, and on the back of the shirt it said Globax by night with a moon.
00:13:11.058 - 00:13:48.084, Speaker A: I was like, this is just an awesome lie. And obviously all designed to make the pit traders feel comfortable that they weren't, their jobs weren't at risk. And I thought it was pretty funny. In 92, I moved to London and set up the London operation. And I stood in the bundoption pit for the first year. And then I was traded from upstairs for the second year. But that was right when Urx fought really hard to get the bund futures to transition from life to Eurex.
00:13:48.084 - 00:14:34.374, Speaker A: We had a team trading the arbitrary between your ex and life. We had our own broker in the pit, in the bund futures pit. And sometimes our broker would go out for lunch and have a pint and then come back and be a little bit off. And I'm like, this pit stuff is just ridiculous. The sooner this stuff transitions to a computer, the better. Then I moved back to Chicago in 94, and I said, if this stuff, if the CME hasn't completely transitioned to the screen by the year 2000, this place is going to be out of business. And I just couldn't have been more wrong.
00:14:34.374 - 00:14:56.584, Speaker A: I couldn't have been more wrong about the timing. It took far longer than that. I think these transitions always do. But suffice it to say, I was always a big believer that, of course, this stuff could be handled more efficiently electronically, but I was definitely dead wrong about the timing.
00:14:56.664 - 00:15:17.904, Speaker C: It's interesting you bring that up. I mean, that probably meant you had more edge for longer, given that the transition took a bit longer than you might have expected. So definitely a boon in the beginning of DRW. But I guess a follow up question to something you said. You said you have to be ready to price anything at any time. There's a price for anything. You know, classic pit trader mentality.
00:15:17.904 - 00:15:36.108, Speaker C: What was it like when a whole block of this new thing called bitcoin came up for auction sometime in 2013 or 14, and you had to think through pricing it and maybe starting a company around that? How did that work?
00:15:36.236 - 00:16:41.814, Speaker A: Yeah, so we had a number of people at DRW who were interested in bitcoin, and I started thinking about it, you know, kind of read the paper, and I was super intrigued by it. I mean, this idea that you could transfer value in a trustless manner was very appealing to me. I mean, the lack of intermediaries can be, you know, can dramatically reduce friction. Of course, I had a very dim view of intermediaries because over time, I became the largest trader in the Iridoll option pit. And there were often these trades that would come through the pit, and we would take down a huge chunk of it, and then ten minutes later, the block trade would go up on the board. It's like, oh, so some big bank just ripped off their customer and then came and back to back the trade into the pit? That's not even trading. That's just ridiculous.
00:16:41.814 - 00:17:32.550, Speaker A: And these intermediaries are not providing a ton of value in the system. I'm saying this in the nicest possible way at the time. I wasn't saying it in such a nice way. This idea of a financial system that reduced the intermediaries in the system was just kind of naturally a very appealing thing to me. And so we had all these debates about, well, is this important? What is it. That's important about it? Is it bitcoin or is it blockchain? I mean, all that stuff that people eventually started having debates about. We were having debates about in 2013, and so we decided that we would do two things.
00:17:32.550 - 00:18:05.824, Speaker A: Well, a few things. We started Cumberland to provide liquidity in bitcoin. We started a company called Digital Asset holdings, which is based in New York that was more focused on the blockchain applications. And then we decided to buy some bitcoin. Yes. Then the government auctions came up and of course, a lot of those were Silk road coins that had been seized at the time. There was this misperception.
00:18:05.824 - 00:18:52.764, Speaker A: The misperception was, any criminal is going to use this stuff to do bad things. And of course, bitcoin is. I guess the advantage for criminals is that they don't have to go out and pick up a sack of. Of $100 bills or something. But the really bad thing to criminals is that every single transaction is memorialized forever. That just doesn't seem like a good characteristic to have if you're going to try to do something illegal. Of course, Silk Road found out the hard way that that was, in fact, a really dumb thing to do.
00:18:52.764 - 00:19:21.410, Speaker A: But that's actually the reason that we named Cumberland. Cumberland because we figured, well, at the time, everybody believes that this is only going to be a place for criminals. So at least let's distance the brand a little bit from the core company. Yeah. And so then the auctions started happening, and to us, it was just a matter of kind of pricing, understanding the liquidity in the market and pricing the auctions accordingly.
00:19:21.582 - 00:19:27.014, Speaker B: When you first spun out, Cumberland, I actually have a question. Where did the name come from? Cumberland.
00:19:28.874 - 00:20:10.954, Speaker A: So, one of my longtime partners at DRW, Jeff Loveoff, is a lawyer in his former life, and so he often was involved in naming new companies. And Jeff is a big grateful dead fan. And there's a mining song about the Cumberland blues. And given the mining link in cryptocurrencies, he decided to call it Cumberland.
00:20:12.174 - 00:20:43.778, Speaker B: It's a good story there, and I get why in the beginning you wanted to separate it out, but when you were first spinning it out, when you were first thinking about what it could be, what were you envisioning Cumberland doing or providing in the space? Was it always going to be somebody that provided liquidity? Were you thinking of it more as a risk taking venture? What was the thought process behind starting?
00:20:43.826 - 00:21:15.588, Speaker A: Yeah. So the idea was just, hey, at DRW, we know how to trade, we know how to take risk, we know how to provide liquidity to the market. And so let's do the same thing in bitcoin. And that was the genesis, of course, with Cumberland. It was much more kind of a counterparty facing situation, but also trading on providing liquidity in other venues.
00:21:15.676 - 00:21:31.704, Speaker C: So I guess just a follow up question on that. You've obviously been through multiple crypto cycles now, and more broadly, you've been through cycles of market maturation. You were talking about the eurox Globex, things going to the screen.
00:21:32.884 - 00:21:34.426, Speaker A: Is there a recipe for.
00:21:34.460 - 00:21:49.566, Speaker C: For cycle survival that you adhere to? Because you've managed to do this through so many different peaks and troughs of euphoria and despair, not just in crypto, but in lots of different markets. How do you think about navigating these things?
00:21:49.750 - 00:22:49.144, Speaker A: There are two different cycles that you're talking about. One is a market structure cycle, and the other is a hype cycle, I guess. Bubbles. So the way that I think about it is, I just think about risk management first and foremost. I think about, yeah, it really all comes down to basic risk management, by the way. I will say I think that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, but especially bitcoin, is really one of the hardest instruments to trade. And the only thing that is clear is that when there's.
00:22:49.144 - 00:23:58.980, Speaker A: I think of it as a negatively convex instrument in that when theres a lot of hype, then that increases adoption and that increases the probability that bitcoin becomes viewed by a majority of the world population as a superior version of a store of value. On the other hand, when the price of bitcoin declines, then people become less interested, and the perceived probability that bitcoin becomes a golden replacement declines. Both of these things are like when the price is going up, you can build a model that would argue that the fair value is higher than it is now. And conversely, when the price is going down, I think that it's actually a unique financial instruments that have that characteristic.
00:23:59.092 - 00:24:30.866, Speaker C: That's really interesting. I guess in commodities you have the opposite. When the price goes up too much, people just demand less, and then the price main reverts. That's my background, but I guess just a follow up question. A negatively convex asset, as you described it, like bitcoin, that create self fulfilling rallies and sell offs. What about that makes it harder to trade? Wouldn't you be able to just implement a momentum strategy that follows the trend of which there would theoretically be large ones?
00:24:31.050 - 00:24:53.472, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe it's a momentum strategy, but it has big troughs and valleys along the way. And so it's very easy to, if you don't have conviction to, to get washed out. If your strategy is kind of a levered long and oh, if it starts to go down, I'm going to get out, it's probably a money losing proposition.
00:24:53.568 - 00:25:04.560, Speaker B: Are there any other markets that you've seen that trade similarly to this? Or what is another way of saying what is the most similar market you've seen, if any, to crypto?
00:25:04.752 - 00:26:10.884, Speaker A: I think it's a very different market. I guess that the closest thing, I mean, you see some similar price patterns in emerging technologies and this kind of the Internet bubble and that kind of thing. But I would argue that those things are fundamentally different because still you're talking about the valuation of a company and you ultimately have to make certain assumptions about the earnings of that company and market share and total addressable market. And in bitcoin, it's not an earnings question, it's just a question of is this a superior store of value to gold? And thats really all a question of what percentage of the world population feels that way. Yeah.
00:26:12.864 - 00:26:52.044, Speaker B: It does also seem to be that the answer to that question is almost a little bit path dependent. The more people that adopted in a shorter period of time leads to crazier momentum and crazier outperformance. From mine, definitely a very interesting asset to trade. One thing that you said in there is emerging tech sometimes acts like crypto. We've been hit with this recent wave of AI applications and llms.
00:26:53.924 - 00:26:54.540, Speaker A: At least.
00:26:54.612 - 00:27:25.302, Speaker B: Even in the short term. Over the last six, seven months since chat GPT really went viral, there's been so much discussion about how it might impact our jobs as people that deal with the financial markets, and a lot more than just that. And you as somebody that has navigated a lot of change when it comes to technology and how it impacts financial markets, how do you see this recent development? And are you, are you keeping, are you keeping your eyes on it?
00:27:25.358 - 00:28:09.534, Speaker A: Yeah. So right now I'm in Woodside, California. I'm ten minutes from Stanford. I met with a bunch of AI people over the last few days, and I've been coming here regularly and doing that. So, yeah, I think that it is a consequential technology. The innovation that's taking place, even specifically in llms, is really very interesting. And so I think it will have all sorts.
00:28:09.534 - 00:28:18.184, Speaker A: I think it will impact pretty much everything aside from, you know, somebody that's living off the grid in a cabin in the woods.
00:28:18.304 - 00:28:46.554, Speaker C: So is this kind of a, is this kind of one of those moments in, let's say, financial history, where an enterprising young person can go back to their studio apartment and use some new technology to print out some sheets and then come back to the pit the next day and win. Is the LLM sort of the modern equivalent of that, in that it will give the first group of traders who figure it out an edge? And if so, how? Do you think so?
00:28:46.634 - 00:29:28.830, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's entirely possible, but it's unclear. I'm convinced that llms are going to be really useful for thinking about some aspects of markets and risk taking, but it's pretty unclear exactly what those are and how much human intervention you need in that process. So it's all I think it's like will be discovered very shortly and then the technology will continue to evolve. And so the answer to those questions will almost certainly change.
00:29:29.022 - 00:30:02.484, Speaker C: It's kind of interesting to think about like, hey, are we at this deep blue moment where technology is about to beat human traders at, you know, at their game, or are we more at the kind of CME going to screen moment where it just should have happened years ago and it still hasn't? Well, now it has, but maybe in 2000. So I guess are you, is it, has AI thus far changed the way that you run your life or your business or your approach to markets? Or are you just still in kind of information absorption mode?
00:30:03.344 - 00:30:11.728, Speaker A: Yeah, right now I'm in information absorption mode. I wouldn't say that I've changed anything meaningful other than spending time on it.
00:30:11.776 - 00:30:13.124, Speaker C: Please let me know when you do.
00:30:13.624 - 00:31:09.154, Speaker B: I think one of the great quotes that you had, I was reading some of the articles that you had been mentioned in before doing the podcast, and I found a really funny quote that I liked, which is that when the LME had their nickel incident, called it one of the most inept moves I've ever seen an exchange make. And I thought that was uniquely funny for somebody that spent so much time in crypto, because we've obviously had our fair share of dealing with venues. And one question I add is you've seen the crypto market evolve in terms of liquidity over time, and I'm curious how you've sort of how you viewed the last, you know, I guess eight years, nine years since you've been in crypto and how it's. How it's evolved and where you think it's going to go in the next five years.
00:31:09.274 - 00:32:11.236, Speaker A: Yeah, here, you know, obviously there's a lot less, at least from outside the crypto community, there's a lot less excitement about it than there was maybe pre FTX blowing up. But I still think that there's really important innovation that's taking place in the space. I think that the ability to move value instantaneously, if you want, trustlessly, is a really important innovation. I think that applying, leveraging that technology for traditional financial markets is one of the most exciting and impactful ways that this technology is going to be used. And so I'm super excited to see.
00:32:11.260 - 00:32:56.200, Speaker B: That unfold, which it will on in terms of the way that we interact with the markets. So right now, obviously, in the traditional world, there's a separation between where liquidity lives, where you custody that asset, who can provide leverage? Is it the exchange that provides leverage? Is it the brokers that provide. Right. Is it primes that provide leverage? Do you think that system is where crypto will eventually go to? Like, do you think that's the end point of financial markets? Or do you think that crypto is going to show us a different, a different way that financial markets could operate? I'm curious, your take on that.
00:32:56.272 - 00:34:00.980, Speaker A: Yeah, so, so it's, I think it's, um. Let's see. So, so, first of all, you know, in the centralized crypto exchange space, you know, these exchanges decided that they should do everything. They should be the FCM, they should be the DCM, the DCO, and then in addition to that, they should provide leverage. And of course, as I was watching this unfed, I said, this is inherently less stable. One of the nice things about traditional financial markets is that by breaking up these different, these different responsibilities, you get more transparency and you get more safety and resilience. Now, obviously, when you switch over to the DeFi world, it does enable you to open up those different responsibilities to different market participants in an even more granular way than you can do in traditional finance.
00:34:00.980 - 00:34:57.284, Speaker A: And it also opens up the ability to provide short term loans to do, you know, to move money instantaneously. It's one of the things that, you know, the LME decided to not ask for margin because it was going to blow up some of the large nickel producers. And then, of course, they decided to cancel all the trades one day because they were worried that a bunch of clearing members and customers would default. That's one way of running things. The other way of running things is to say, hey, we're going to move value in real time. When there's a margin deficit, you top it up right now. And of course, you have the ability to do that because you can move money on chain.
00:34:57.284 - 00:35:15.808, Speaker A: And my belief is that that actually leads us to a more transparent, more safe, more resilient market, financial market. And that is the promise of a lot of this technology that will, in fact, enable that to happen.
00:35:15.976 - 00:35:37.986, Speaker C: So what types of timeframes, if you had to make a sort of a prediction, would you say we're looking at when it comes to the blockchainification of certain assets, perhaps nickel, things that right now aren't necessarily associated with crypto?
00:35:38.130 - 00:36:09.782, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'm perpetually wrong in estimates like that. So I always think they're going to happen sooner than they will. So whatever I say, just take the over. So that's one thing. The other thing is, of course, there are some assets that are physical assets, like nickel. You can put nickel on a blockchain, but ultimately the nickel has to sit somewhere. And if somebody steals the nickel, then you have a blockchain that represents nickel, and the nickel is not there.
00:36:09.782 - 00:37:09.362, Speaker A: And that's a problem. That kind of stuff is something that still has this intimate link to the physical world that is super critical. Now, there are other instruments that are already virtual instruments, like equities and treasuries, and people don't usually walk around with their chair certificates. And I think that those assets probably lend themselves more to. To digitization, to blockchainization. I think that that stuff is going to happen. Right now, we're experimenting with intraday repo using blockchain technology that's on top of Canton, which is digital asset holdings blockchain.
00:37:09.362 - 00:37:49.644, Speaker A: And that's kind of powered by Broadridge. So that's an example of experimenting with the kind of the early days of using this technology to do that. And ultimately, of course, what that does is it enables value to be moved in real time and even twenty four seven. And that's the kind of thing that will make clearing houses more resilient if they want to avail themselves of that technology.
00:37:49.804 - 00:38:04.422, Speaker C: Interesting, I guess just a quick follow up question, if you could tell the listeners a bit more about digital asset holdings, the Canton blockchain, and what sort of problems it solves that perhaps ethereum. I think it'd be really useful for everyone to learn about.
00:38:04.478 - 00:39:18.254, Speaker A: Yeah, so Ethereum is obviously a very powerful network, tons of energy and participation. One of the drawbacks of ethereum is that every single transaction is public. And of course, for most people, if they buy or sell a security, they don't want the whole world to know that they bought or sold that security. Probably fine, depending on the market structure, for their counterparty to know, maybe for a regulator to know, maybe for a clearinghouse to know, maybe for a prime broker to know. But for any given instrument in any given transaction, you want to be able to really control who can see that. The advantage of Canton and then the smart contract language on top of it, which is called DAML, is that it has configurable privacy, which was built at the core of this chain. This is something that the team's been working on since 2014.
00:39:18.254 - 00:39:29.734, Speaker A: This is a very long, very long process. Time to build a blockchain that works with those characteristics.
00:39:30.514 - 00:39:45.614, Speaker B: I think it would be helpful to expand on what is the issue with the current stack that doesn't allow this to happen with the current architecture. Why can't we achieve this?
00:39:47.654 - 00:39:51.394, Speaker A: So, currently, in traditional financial markets.
00:39:52.254 - 00:40:17.350, Speaker B: Yeah. Why is what Canton enables not necessarily possible? I think for us here, we're participants in the financial markets. We understand the value that blockchain can bring to the table, but I think it'd be useful for people that are less familiar to sort of understand a lot of the current issues.
00:40:17.462 - 00:41:09.362, Speaker A: Yeah. So right now, if you want to wire money, that can take. It can take hours. And of course, you can only do it when the wire windows open. And so let's say that you have on a spread between a futures contract that's in London and a futures contract that's in the United States. And then after London hours, there's a big, a big rally, and you're long the futures in London and you're short the futures in the US. The idea that you could pull variation margin out of the London market and move it over to satisfy the negative variation that you're experiencing in the US, you're not even close, actually.
00:41:09.362 - 00:41:45.654, Speaker A: What will happen is the next day that futures contract will rally. Assuming then the next day we open up and the market's unchanged, then the London futures contract will rally. The variation margin will show up in your account. At that point, you can wire it out, maybe that day, maybe the next day, maybe now you're running into the weekend. The whole system is just very clunky. A lot of it is batch. So you have these cycles that process once a day or twice a day.
00:41:45.654 - 00:42:05.140, Speaker A: And so it just makes everything very slow to move around. It means that you need to have a lot of extra capital in the system in order to deal with that lack of. With all those delays that take place.
00:42:05.282 - 00:42:53.064, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I think that's very helpful, helpful framing for people. You know, it's just, it's something that we're, we're honestly blessed with as people that are in that are in crypto, you know, we, we use a system that is accessible twenty four seven. And, you know, every time I go back to the, you know, quote unquote traditional markets, I'm, I'm always a feel, I always leave feeling a little bit disappointed with what I can do. You know, what is, what is possible and what isn't. And then I flee back into my metamask and end up much happier. So, you know, it's good, it's good to hear these problems, these problems are being tackled and, you know, it's something that we look out as well.
00:42:53.064 - 00:43:40.866, Speaker B: Now, we had one last, one last question for you. Don't, when, when people think of, uh, you know, when people think of the Chicago, Chicago trading firms, a lot of people think of, you know, high frequency taking, taking bips, uh, here, here and there, a lot of it's, a lot of it's arbitrage. And I think a lot of your career has been, has been characterized by finding these types of arbitrage opportunities. But you also, you've, you've also, you also take, take risk, you know? And so I love to hear about your process, as I think our listeners would love to hear, too, about your process for decision making when it comes, when it, when it comes to risk taking. And you know, what, what you think has helped you the most in your, in your career when it comes to be being right.
00:43:41.010 - 00:44:38.084, Speaker A: Yeah. So, so, you know, obviously the little arbitrages are great because you can generate these very high, sharp, high return trades, but the reality is they don't persist. Markets constantly become more efficient and those things quickly get arbed out. And so building a business that just relies on capturing those little arbitrages is not sustainable. And so being comfortable moving out the risk curve is super important. Now, obviously, if you can move out the risk curve and you have access to super low latency tools and connectivity, then you're in a really strong spot, and that's where we try to be. But when I think about risk, so when I think about markets or really most things in the world, I see a series of probability distributions.
00:44:38.084 - 00:46:39.868, Speaker A: And, and so if you look at the world as a series of probability distributions, then you're kind of well set up to think about risk. And so anytime that there's some kind of a perceived dislocation in the market, because when there's a dislocation in the market, when there's a violent move, you know that there's a high probability that it's mispriced. Either it was mispriced before or it's mispriced now, or, I mean, okay, probably there's some fundamental thing that changed, but high probability that it's still mispriced because new information has come out and there's been a dramatic move. And so the way I think about it is I think about what are the drivers of this price action? What are the drivers of supply and demand if it's a commodity? Or what are the drivers of the Fed's reaction function? And then on top of that, the supply and demand for the hedging need of this part of the interest rate curve. And then I try to think about what are the things that could change going forward that will shift the Fed's reaction function one way or another? What will cause the Fed to ease after Silicon Valley bank, the interest rate market priced in an expectation that the Fed was going to ease by 100 basis points by the end of the year. And of course that's not what happened. I mean, so far the Fed has hiked 50 basis points since then.
00:46:39.868 - 00:47:17.044, Speaker A: And I expect the Fed may well hike again before the end of the year. I expect the Fed won't ease by the end of the year. And of course, those outcomes were all within the probability distribution. But my view at the time was that the probability of the Fed easing by the end of the year was massively overpriced. That part of the distribution, and the part of the distribution of the Fed continues to hike, was significantly underpriced. I start with that and then think about, okay, what's the best way of expressing that risk?
00:47:17.624 - 00:47:41.122, Speaker B: That makes a ton of sense. I always try to think similarly. I think one of the hardest parts is constructing that probability distribution is thinking about, okay, well what, what are the criteria that actually go into building this out? It's like, okay, I think this is a 60% chance of, you know, this, and then 30, and then, but then it turns out that you were just completely wrong.
00:47:41.178 - 00:47:51.464, Speaker A: No, I mean, I mean, coming up with your own subjective measures of the probability distribution is super hard and especially when the market's saying something very different. Yep.
00:47:51.504 - 00:48:13.560, Speaker B: As a closing, closing question here, are there any trades that you, you know, you really, really loved that you can talk about here? Maybe, maybe your favorite trade ever, if you're, if you're willing, if you're willing to disclose it, that you can think back on and say, hey, I really, really loved putting this one on. And, you know, I don't know if it made you the most money or was most interesting.
00:48:13.632 - 00:49:14.584, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean. I mean, here, you know, I've done lots of. Lots of trades that I really loved. I mean, this year I will say that the dislocation, what I perceived as a complete dislocation in the interest rate market after Silicon Valley bank was one of my favorite traits. I thought that there was such a gap between my perception of what the probability distribution should be and the markets implied probability distribution. I thought that was just phenomenal. But going back in time, one of the trades, and this is a different type of trade, but in 2008, when Lehman went bankrupt, we were one of a handful of firms that the CME called to, asked to price their portfolio.
00:49:14.584 - 00:50:24.194, Speaker A: We were well prepared for it. Got the whole portfolio from the CME, broke it down into different chunks of risk, had different teams, priced the risk, added it up, and then submitted the aggregate bid. It was actually by product, but we ended up being the best bid and something like three of the five buckets in the auction. And there's something. And then when we did win those buckets, we were super efficient about hedging off that risk in kind of the optimal way and all of that. That entire process obviously took a lot of confidence in how we were thinking about the risk and how we were modeling the risk and that ability to then aggregate it up in a very volatile environment. Say, here's our number.
00:50:24.274 - 00:50:26.586, Speaker B: That's an awesome story. Part of history right there.
00:50:26.650 - 00:50:28.058, Speaker A: It's pretty cool. Yeah.
00:50:28.146 - 00:50:29.658, Speaker C: I was part of the Lehman portfolio.
00:50:29.706 - 00:50:30.818, Speaker B: But I didn't get acquired.
00:50:30.906 - 00:50:31.762, Speaker A: What happened there?
00:50:31.858 - 00:50:48.114, Speaker C: I had to go find a different job after that. I had a follow up question for you. Don't. Does your. Another auction, does your bitcoin trade factor into maybe the top five trades, or did that feel like more of a venture thing than a trade?
00:50:48.774 - 00:50:50.154, Speaker A: I'm sorry, which one?
00:50:50.734 - 00:50:51.886, Speaker C: The bitcoin trade.
00:50:51.950 - 00:51:30.124, Speaker A: The Silk road auction. That was a series of auctions, and they were really relatively small in terms of risk. They were interesting. The first one, we'd never interacted with the United States marshals, but, yeah, I thought it was a fairly vanilla process. I thought they did a good job thinking about how to maximize the value, and we were very comfortable trading the asset class, so it was great.
00:51:30.244 - 00:51:35.984, Speaker C: Well, don, thank you so much. I don't want to take up too much more of your time. Have to get back to.
00:51:37.500 - 00:51:38.324, Speaker A: Oh. Oh, you.
00:51:38.784 - 00:51:39.504, Speaker C: I guess we lost.
00:51:39.544 - 00:51:43.112, Speaker B: Don, you said we don't want to take up too much.
00:51:43.128 - 00:51:43.872, Speaker A: Tomorrow, your time. It's time.
00:51:43.888 - 00:52:01.972, Speaker B: It's very valuable. Jonah. So really enjoyed this conversation. I really, you know, I think I learned a lot. Came away thinking about it. If I. Although, if I had to say, one thing that I'd really like to dive into more is I need to figure out how he constructs his probability distributions.
00:52:02.168 - 00:52:03.024, Speaker C: Me too.
00:52:03.564 - 00:52:04.548, Speaker B: What goes into that?
00:52:04.596 - 00:52:23.796, Speaker C: But, you know, I've tried a few times. He's the master at it. We're just trying to learn that up. Well, thank you all for joining us. It was a wonderful conversation. Really looking forward to the next episode. Avi, as always, absolute pleasure to co host this with you.
00:52:23.796 - 00:52:26.804, Speaker C: And again, none of this is financial advice.
