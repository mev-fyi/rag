00:00:00.360 - 00:00:38.414, Speaker A: When you get these headlines now like First Republic failing or PAC west failing or western alliance failing, and you get a move up from bitcoin, if you don't see the equity markets doing the same thing, then you might want to fade it. All right, welcome back to our third episode of Thousand X. It's kind of hilarious because I'm looking at the price of bitcoin right now, and I don't think it has changed much since the last episode, even though it's been two weeks and I feel like a lot has happened. We're basically at the same prices.
00:00:38.874 - 00:00:51.114, Speaker B: At the end of the last episode, you asked me, hey Jonah, what 1st 24k or 30k? Both said 24k. Did it touch 30k? Almost.
00:00:51.234 - 00:00:56.534, Speaker A: It was very close. So I think we were saved by $200.
00:00:57.294 - 00:01:03.726, Speaker B: The high was $29,959. So we didn't quite get there.
00:01:03.870 - 00:01:17.234, Speaker A: I would still characterize that as being wrong, but technically we're not wrong yet and we're back at the same prices. I like you.
00:01:18.094 - 00:01:19.566, Speaker B: A lot has changed.
00:01:19.750 - 00:02:46.156, Speaker A: A lot has changed. I think one of the more interesting things that happened in the last two weeks was the failure of First Republic and the aftershocks of that. You have PAC west and western alliance collapsing in on themselves. I do think bitcoin definitely got a boost from that, a short term boost. But I'm getting worried, and I don't know if you're feeling this too, where the narrative was for the longest time since SVB, bank failures, good for bitcoin, but we're kind of seeing that not play out as much anymore. And I'm starting to think back to SVB and think about, well, what was the real driver of bitcoin price action? What was the most important part? And instead of reallocation because of bank failure, I'm thinking maybe it was just the stimulus effect of the Fed saying and the FDIC saying we're basically going to backstop all banks. And so now every further bank failure that we get has less of that effect because we already know that that that's priced in.
00:02:46.156 - 00:02:54.684, Speaker A: Right? If First Republic fails and their deposits are backstopped, well, that's priced in. Cause nobody was pricing them going under in the same way. Right.
00:02:54.724 - 00:03:34.378, Speaker B: It's a good point you make, but I'm not sure how much of it is priced in. I'm not sure I agree with you in the entirety of that statement. I'm kind of leaning the opposite direction as you. I'm starting to get a little bit more confident and feeling more bullish rather than more scared of being bullish. And I think the reason is, I think since the start of this bank bailout situation occurred with the FDIC backstopping the regionals, $300 billion is what that costs. Staggering numbers. When you compare it to what happened in zero eight, they're happy to just dispense of 300 billion to backstop a couple of banks and depositors in a couple of banks.
00:03:34.378 - 00:03:48.754, Speaker B: That basically unwinds the entire deflationary effect of what was going on prior to that with the treasury letting or the Fed letting some of their holdings roll off.
00:03:49.454 - 00:03:50.238, Speaker A: Pretty remarkable.
00:03:50.286 - 00:04:13.944, Speaker B: So I think you could say what's priced in is a few more regional banks failing and maybe another bailout or two. But I think if you take the view that this cascade is just going to continue until the entire regional banking system has been subsumed by bulge brackets like JP Morgan and B of A, I don't think that amount of bailout has been priced in. So maybe we're somewhere in between.
00:04:14.024 - 00:04:28.248, Speaker A: Yeah, you're definitely right that the long term, if in the long term, what ends up happening is a lot of these regional banks, a majority of these regional banks get subsumed. I don't think that's being priced in.
00:04:28.296 - 00:04:29.048, Speaker B: That's correct.
00:04:29.176 - 00:05:17.662, Speaker A: But I do think a few more bank failures, every subsequent bank failure is less stimulus, unless it's a ton of bank failures. Right. So obviously, if you get like 50 or 60, then that's going to be more than just, you know, five or six. But what I'm saying is that every subsequent one is just less stimulus in the market. I think that it's just more, it's more priced in. And so the core, the core of the question also was like, okay, well, but why are people reallocating to bitcoin? Or why are people allocating to bitcoin with SVB? I think what was interesting is that bitcoin led the S and P, but the S and P rebounded too, which I think is important to remember. Right.
00:05:17.662 - 00:05:55.520, Speaker A: Risk markets went up after SVB. It just so happened that bitcoin went up first and went up faster. I think a lot of it was because it was a weekend, but, you know, it went up first and went up faster was the fastest horse because I think people were allocating to it based off of, okay, well, this is stimulus and this is some sort of narrative, so therefore we're going to bet. We're going to bet on this thing. Um, and so what that tells me though, is like, if I were to like, let's say we ran a regression on it, right? And we said two variables. Stimulus, equity markets going up and then narrative. I'd bet that it would be 80 20, right? It'd be 80 stimulus 20 narrative.
00:05:55.520 - 00:06:38.080, Speaker A: That would be my bet. And so the reason that that's important is that when you get these headlines now, like first Republic failing or PAC west failing or western alliance failing, and you get a move up from bitcoin, if you don't see the equity markets doing the same thing, then you might want to fade it. That's sort of the out. That's like the outcome oriented approach. Like if you see if PAC west goes down next week and bitcoin's up 4%, to me that seems like a sale as opposed to a buy because of that dynamic. I hear you.
00:06:38.112 - 00:07:44.794, Speaker B: I mean, I guess maybe one dynamic that boosted us so much in March when SVB went down was the fact that circle, circle financial, the issuer of USDC dollar coin, held 3 billion plus worth of deposits at Silicon Valley bank. So if you were holding USDC at that time, there was an actual impetus for you to rotate out of your USDC and into ETH on Uniswap or something, or off chain, because your dollars were theoretically at risk. Whereas when, if you're a crypto holder and First Republic bank goes down, or Zions Bancorp goes down, or any of these other regionals, for the most part, you're either not exposed or you don't know if you're exposed or you're just straight up in who cares territory. So maybe there's a little bit less impulse to trade as there was back then. Still, the narrative did cause a pop. And you're absolutely right, it was a fade. Meanwhile, the biggest bank of them all, the United States Treasury, Uncle Sam, that one's looking a little shaky as well.
00:07:44.794 - 00:07:55.638, Speaker B: Let's say we had a technical default where the United States just doesn't pay back bondholders for a little while. What do you think the price of bitcoin is in that scenario?
00:07:55.766 - 00:08:23.886, Speaker A: I think that depends heavily on gold. My bet is that headline sends us past 30, maybe to 35. I had this, I had this tweet. It's like, I think. I think we get to 35k if we, if, if that headline comes out. People said that I was not sufficiently bullish enough, so I, quote, tweeted it and I said, okay, fine, all time highs. But I think, like, the reaction to that tweet is telling.
00:08:23.886 - 00:09:16.914, Speaker A: So I. That, that quote tweet was definitely a joke. I think that we're probably capping out at, you know, 30 35k or 30 36k, unless you get that. And then a really quick. What I could see really propelling us, if we're hopeful to get to 40 or more, is the debt ceiling happens, people panic. You get a short term move down in risk markets, and then it's very quickly resolved and it's put behind us, and we come out with a good conclusion, and bitcoin has all this narrative behind it already, and then risk markets start ripping again, then that's, I think it's like, similar to the SBB situation, right, where you kind of need that confluence. I think qs have to go up, I think spy has to go up in order for bitcoin to get to all time highs.
00:09:16.914 - 00:09:25.334, Speaker A: But if you get that narrative juice and then you get that turnaround, I mean, buy as much upside volume as you possibly can and just kind of wait it out.
00:09:25.834 - 00:10:08.744, Speaker B: It's interesting you mentioned upside volume. I think it's very rare to talk about a mega cap asset that could double in price in the next month or two, and I'm less sanguine about it. I think we could definitely see all time highs on short order if the United States were to default. And it's crazy that we even have to talk about this. Whoever you are, wherever you live in the world, if you have a spreadsheet with money in it, you have to rewrite some cells and some formulas. If the United States defaults, the risk free rate is no longer risk free. The value of investing money or holding money now versus having money later changes drastically.
00:10:08.744 - 00:10:46.624, Speaker B: It could possibly be the most seminal event in financial history, and it could occur not because of an inability to pay, but just an unwillingness to pay back debt. I mean, there are a few scenarios we could talk through around that, but I think you'd see bitcoin test 70, $80,000. If people need to move money out of much like they moved money out of USDC and into crypto when Silicon Valley bank was under duress and eventually failed, I think you'd see people move money out of fiat and into crypto in droves if fiat suddenly became unstable. If you're holding fiat right now, you're holding t bills and earning yield, you're not holding cash and letting it burn.
00:10:47.044 - 00:10:52.404, Speaker A: I think you're insane. I don't think this is going anywhere near saying, maybe we should just fight.
00:10:52.444 - 00:10:55.324, Speaker B: Each other on twitter. Yeah, fair enough.
00:10:56.104 - 00:11:34.546, Speaker A: I mean, I would obviously love that. I think it'd make my summer a lot better. Could definitely do a lot more things, but I don't think that that's feasible to get to 70, mostly because I just don't know where that buying is coming from because even if we hit the debt ceiling and that issue comes out, okay, let's think of the, let's think of the market participants, right, who are actually going to be buying this thing. I don't think retail is not buying on it. They might buy a little bit on it. I think you need to cat like it. You might, you know, you'd probably need to get through 35, 40 to get, to get retail, to get retail back in.
00:11:34.546 - 00:11:42.490, Speaker A: And even then, retail doesn't feel as rich or as bored as they were during COVID So there's, there's hard. It's just harder to get them in.
00:11:42.562 - 00:11:50.128, Speaker B: You don't think even a few basis points of retail would say, hey, I'm just going to go buy a little bit of bitcoin on my Robinhood account.
00:11:50.256 - 00:12:09.392, Speaker A: Just because I think you got a frenzy. The high net worth guys, I think they do drive it forward and I think those guys take it to 35. So remember, I am bullish. So I do think you get some allocation from the high net worth. The institutions are going to take too long. No institution is going to say, I'm buying bitcoin now because of this.
00:12:09.528 - 00:12:13.484, Speaker B: Now you have bitcoin futures on the CME, I think, activated.
00:12:14.304 - 00:12:49.994, Speaker A: I think it would just take them time to make that decision. And then the slow allocators may or may not change their pace based on it. And I say all this because I think in order to get back to 70, you need all of those groups to be firing on all cylinders. And so if you don't have all those groups firing in all cylinders, it's just harder. It's just harder to see. But I do think, you know, 35, 40 is a, is a reason, is a reasonable target. Although, you know, I'd reassess.
00:12:49.994 - 00:13:36.016, Speaker A: I'd reassess there one thing that I was thinking about and, you know, I'd love, actually, I'm taking this a slightly, slightly different way, but I'd love to get you, I'd love to get your thoughts on this are in 2021, there was such a perfect storm of, you're locked in your house, you have stimulus checks, you can't do anything. Your entire life has just gone online. And that led to crypto going nuts. Do you think we'll ever get circumstances like that again that will lead to a crazy run like 2021? And if so, how do you think we get there?
00:13:36.080 - 00:14:21.340, Speaker B: Oh, man, it's a great question. I don't think we'll ever like. History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes, as the saying goes. So I don't think we'll get another lockdown with a bunch of stimulus checks. But I can see a different type of perfect storm. And one of the themes that we play on in 1000 x is how old I am and how young you are. I would put the question more on you and Gen Z people who, whenever I talk to them, it seems like they're less doing the sorts of things that I did when I was young and more just chasing apparitions of Pokemon around abandoned lots with their phone, or living on Fortnite watching a Travis Scott concert on the Internet.
00:14:21.340 - 00:15:09.046, Speaker B: At some point, I think enough of these people are going to grow up and have enough percentage of human productive hours spent online that crypto Internet money is going to become more of a. More of a thing than fiat for a lot of people. I think that the seamlessness of the experience of moving value around and moving digital goods and services around relative to moving actual goods and services and fiat currency, it's such a drastic improvement. As the founder of Fireblocks says, it's 30 x better. It's not 30% better. I think eventually, for certain people, you will have that perfect storm of just constant economic activity inside of some game or reality that isn't necessarily what us olds think of as normal. What do you think?
00:15:09.190 - 00:15:26.566, Speaker A: Yeah, I think all that's correct. So I think there are two things that stand out to me as major headwind or not tailwinds for crypto. Not headwinds is one that wealth transfer from boomers like you, people like me?
00:15:26.670 - 00:15:27.634, Speaker B: Come on.
00:15:29.594 - 00:16:04.104, Speaker A: It's like parents. As parents get older, I think that reallocation is going to bring a lot of money into digital assets. Great. I also do think, I tweeted this out, but I was in South America last month and one thing that struck me was just that crypto is a genuine thing there. You can actually go buy things with crypto. There are people that use crypto there. I talked to random people that would bring it up and had binance accounts.
00:16:04.104 - 00:17:10.080, Speaker A: I think what could end up happening is that as you get population growth from those areas, as those areas get wealthier, the allocation of crypto grows a little bit more as the rest of the world gets wealthier relative to places like the US and the UK, where allocations are a bit lower. And then here's my little conspiracy theory. Or not conspiracy theory, but far fetched idea I think could lead to a crazy bull run. We have inflation right now. How do you solve for inflation? Well, one way is to raise rates, another way is to increase productivity. And AI is radically increasing productivity in certain niche areas right now. It's very possible that in a year, in two years, in three years we're back infrastructural deflation because the productivity gains that AI has delivered us have just gone through the roof.
00:17:10.080 - 00:17:46.988, Speaker A: And then you get a crazy bull market from tech you probably like. Its very possible that if this thesis is true, the ten year is just ripping forever. We saw peak rates already. Thats possible. And then at some point a lot of people are going to lose their jobs and I dont know whether its three years, four years, five years, six years, eight years from now. But Ubi starts to become a very, very, very real discussion and I think that could create an environment that's very good for.
00:17:47.036 - 00:18:56.054, Speaker B: Yeah. How do you escape if you're in Ubi world? And obviously the steps it would take to get there are controversial, but if you live in Ubi world, how do you differentiate yourself from the pack? Well, you have to invest. Well, basically. Now here's the question. Speaking of old world things, things that could potentially transform themselves into explosive digital economies, digital products. Way back when I was young, you'd get in your car, drive to the gas station and buy a lottery ticket, and that was your way to potentially get rich without really trying that hard. One thing that I was thinking about recently amidst this meme coin frenzy is isn't this just a digitally native, more exciting and younger version of going and buying a lottery ticket? And what would it be like if you took the total global spend on lottery tickets and just saw that over the course of the next, I don't know how many decades just turn into global spend on meme coin lotteries.
00:18:56.054 - 00:19:09.906, Speaker B: What would the market capitalization of meme coins be if you brought that spend online? The US spent $74 billion on lottery.
00:19:09.930 - 00:19:20.514, Speaker A: Tickets last year, according to Google, in one year. In one year, $74 billion of money were used to buy lottery tickets.
00:19:20.674 - 00:19:22.094, Speaker B: That's right, yeah.
00:19:23.634 - 00:19:26.950, Speaker A: It's an absurdly high number.
00:19:27.122 - 00:19:28.514, Speaker B: That's just America.
00:19:29.854 - 00:19:35.062, Speaker A: What percent of the total crypto market cap is that? That's like a solid five.
00:19:35.118 - 00:19:35.942, Speaker B: 5%?
00:19:35.998 - 00:19:45.222, Speaker A: Yeah, 5% of total, like total crypto market cap, yeah. And this is $74 billion of buying of crypto. This stuff is up two x. Yeah.
00:19:45.238 - 00:20:17.226, Speaker B: And so $74 billion of buying does not equate to $74 billion worth of market capitalization. Maybe it's ten x that amount. So basically what I was thinking was, to your question about what causes that perfect storm, I think wealth transfer as younger people inherit cash and just a digitally native version of activity that has taken place for a very long time, but in a more, let's call it flashy and appealing way to younger generations, that could create all sorts of activity.
00:20:17.290 - 00:20:38.544, Speaker A: Yeah, that would be. Yeah, I actually didn't realize that that was the total, total amount of money spent on a lot of ticks. But that makes a ton of sense, right? I mean, crypto at the end of the day is a large portion of it is the fact that it's a massive casino. When you have things like, actually the one thing that changed dramatically from last week was the market cap of Pepe.
00:20:39.484 - 00:20:51.364, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's been for a wild ride, but that's kind of like comparable to the price of a square mile of real estate on what is now the Las Vegas Strip.
00:20:51.444 - 00:20:51.804, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:51.884 - 00:21:22.550, Speaker B: It kind of went from worthless to maybe a few hundred grand to worth billions and maybe back down and then back up again through some various recessionary scenarios. But you have to think that some of this value trickles down to the Ethereum network because lottery tickets, casinos, gambling, that's but one of the many products and services offered on this l one. And that's, I think, why gas has been so consistently high for the last few weeks is this type of activity.
00:21:22.662 - 00:22:31.608, Speaker A: There's been a crazy uptake in meme coinery and it's all retail. It's very hard for institutions to go touch this stuff. But as much as you might think that we don't pay attention to it, we very much so pay attention to it because it's a great signal for a lot of things. One thing that was very heavily debated in group chats and internally was did the pepe blow off? And the crazy amount of capital that flew into Pepe, was that a sign for the health of the market? This is a debate, and I'll give you the two sides as I see it. And then I'd love to hear, love to hear where you sort of fall out on it, is maybe you have a third or fourth or fifth side, but the two sides, as I say, this one meme coins generally mean blow off. It's when you have nothing better to do with your money, it sucks liquidity out of bitcoin and ethereum, and that causes bitcoin, ethereum to go down. And if nobody's allocating bitcoin and ethereum.
00:22:31.608 - 00:22:58.306, Speaker A: Then the meme coin can only go up for so long, and then everything starts crashing because people reallocate out of bitcoin and ethereum. Bitcoin, ethereum go down, goes in meme coin, meme coin goes down. Right? So it's like the liquidity suck bear thesis. The other side is that it's just an isolated run. Pepe was the only thing that was running. It was kind of the only meme coin that was, that was in existence. It kind of existed in its own world.
00:22:58.306 - 00:23:25.654, Speaker A: And there's not that much liquidity. There's like $50 million of liquidity backing a $1.5 billion chickcoin. I guess now it's less. But at the time I saw the analysis, that's the two approaches to it. I don't know if we've gotten an answer yet, but curious, your take.
00:23:25.734 - 00:23:55.854, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a tradfi informed take on this. Thank you for asking. I think it's a new use case emerging. And the reason why is the lottery example that I gave earlier. To me, this is a lottery. And so far, the two biggest use cases for ethereum have been, well, blockchains in general have been defined nfts in terms of computing. And obviously the OG use case is cryptocurrency.
00:23:55.854 - 00:24:53.682, Speaker B: The bitcoin l one supports a currency called bitcoin that is useful to a lot of people. Believe it or not, stable coins are another use case. But like, to me, this lottery, this online lottery accessible to the entire world, is a use case. And so many times, you know, as a commodities trader, I used to trade crude oil. Like, one thing that you learn is that as entrepreneurs in commodities markets, the biggest entrepreneurs who generate the most wealth do so by taking a waste product and turning it into a useful product. What I mean by that is like natural gas was literally burned at the wellhead until somebody thought, hey, this is a cleaner fuel that we can use to heat our homes, right? Vaseline, a lubricant that you may or may not be familiar with, used to be a waste product of the refining process. And then Exxon just started selling it for what it's currently used for and made a fortune.
00:24:53.682 - 00:25:43.650, Speaker B: So if you take a waste product and you turn it into a useful product, you make a fortune. Anyway, before these conversions occur, markets often dis. Commodities markets often dismiss this stuff as crap, as a waste of time, a problem, a waste of resources. And it's interesting, I sit here at an institutional firm servicing institutional counterparties, taking institutional risk, and listening to people dismiss this pepe shit as just some sort of waste of block space. I'm thinking, like, maybe not. Maybe the creators of these types of ERC 20 tokens, which are consuming so much gas and could theoretically be considered waste products, are actually useful products insofar as people demand lottery style upside for minimal effort in the society. It's human nature.
00:25:43.650 - 00:25:46.958, Speaker B: I don't know, that would be one kind of crazy take on it.
00:25:47.026 - 00:26:01.806, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I'm with you. And at some point, as institutions, we might have to get comfortable speculating on these things. For now, I think we. It's hard to. If we were to put 1% of our fund into Pepe and then we lost it, I don't think our LP's.
00:26:01.830 - 00:26:03.174, Speaker B: Would be particularly hard to justify.
00:26:03.294 - 00:27:04.574, Speaker A: Right? So they'd look at us and they go, why did you buy a coin based after a. That doesn't do anything. You go, well, you know, it could have gone up 100 x. It didn't, but it could have. Right? And so I'm kind of wondering if this plus doge is gonna get LP's and people more comfortable with the idea that you can have these like crazy lottery tickets and they kind of sometimes make sense in a portfolio context. There was some like, options, institutional lottery tickets, call options. Yeah, there was some, I think, to your point of, to your general point of, hey, this is a big use case in crypto, a funny statistic was that if you bought every single meme coin that was launched over the last year or something like that, you ended and you started with ten k, you ended up with something like a mil.
00:27:04.574 - 00:27:09.310, Speaker A: A lot of it coming from Pepe, but also from other coins over the.
00:27:09.342 - 00:27:12.314, Speaker B: Last year, which has been a pretty dire year for.
00:27:12.764 - 00:27:43.132, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like, over the last year, it's kind of not God crazy because you end up getting these things super early, and some of them end up with $5 million market caps or $10 million, whatever, some of them end up going to 1.5 bill, apparently. So this is. I'm not advocating for people to go put their money into meme coins, but there's some sort of strategy that could probably be developed around this. Right? Like, if I was, if, if this.
00:27:43.148 - 00:28:04.852, Speaker B: Is a question for you, before you go on, let's say that you were going to launch the golden Coin meme coin index fund that does that, actually does that. How would that be a full time job for somebody or two or three people just to accomplish that feat of getting into all of those, tracking it all, how would you set that up.
00:28:04.908 - 00:29:12.914, Speaker A: Yeah. So, I mean, I actually think it'd be like for some enterprising young guy out there, or woman, it's gonna, it's good. It's probably a good idea to think about, hey, how do I extract the most value from, like, trading? Like, what should I be, what should I be spending my time on? If you have any sort of technical ability and AI could actually chat, might actually be able to help with this, is you can start screening contracts for specific red flags. So imagine you scanned Ethereum and you looked for new smart contracts that were launched. And every single time a new smart contract came out for a token that was a simple meme coin, you'd pull in the data, and then you ask chajpt, or you'd ask yourself, hey, or what are the red flags? Do they have any specific functions that allow you, that either restrict you from selling? So there are a lot that will say, hey, you actually can't sell. There are a lot that are upgradeable contracts. Can they upgrade the contract may or may not be a red flag.
00:29:12.914 - 00:30:02.510, Speaker A: Do they have the ability to mint additional tokens? That would be a big red flag. So there are all these sorts of functions that you can go look for in these smart contracts. Like, okay, well, you compile a list of things that make you want to buy something and make you not want to buy something. So you start running a screen or to figure out, well, what are the optimal meme coins to buy, and then you probably after, like, I don't know, this is probably like a month or two of work is what I would assume. You probably have a pretty good system for picking up meme coins, and you can actually probably run that as a strategy. But that's at least my first instinct here, is that there's definitely a way to go screen these coins in a systematic and programmatic manner. Make that bet over and over and over, and then just call it a day.
00:30:02.510 - 00:30:52.820, Speaker A: Right, scale that, scale that. And there's no way. There's also no way I was the first one to think of this. I'm sure that there are people out there doing it, and I'm actually, now that I think about it more, probably a lot of volume, like initial volume on these things, comes from people doing that, is what I would assume. So, like, the other way to the other way. The other way to do it is if my theory is true and there are that many people that are running these bots, then, like, you create a meme coin specifically designed to attract bot liquidity, right? So, like, you like try to reverse engineer the bots and figure out what they look for in meme coins, and then make a meme coin with exactly those parameters, and then you launch it. It gets bought by a bunch of those bots.
00:30:52.820 - 00:30:57.060, Speaker A: Then you just sell into them and you do that over and over and over and over. Could be kind of funny.
00:30:57.212 - 00:31:05.644, Speaker B: All the smartest bot people are focused on sandwich trading and Mev. Meanwhile, when they zig, you zag.
00:31:05.764 - 00:31:10.684, Speaker A: Well, you know what they say, it's not about how good you are, it's about the table that you play at.
00:31:10.804 - 00:31:55.724, Speaker B: That's a very good point. The table that I play at is increasingly graying and aging. So I guess I use chat GPT more just to remind myself how certain financial math works, and less to, like, come up with screener schemes to, you know, identify meme coins and potentially profit from them. But you know what? This is, this is fascinating stuff. But one thing that I think we're both realizing just from digging into a topic that neither of us really took seriously even two or three weeks ago, echoes the broader theme that maybe these things aren't going away. Maybe even though 16 Guai is neutral gas levels for ETH, and we're consistently averaging 50 to 150 Gwaii, ETH is deflationary. It's crazy.
00:31:55.724 - 00:32:26.524, Speaker B: It doesn't, doesn't, you know, all of this activity, the fact that it isn't going away and the fact that there are like pearls or kernels of an investment thesis inside of it means that maybe we should just get used to this. And even if it does eventually die down, the ETH that's being burned as a result of this activity is never coming back. So it is real and does need to be taken seriously for what it is. So I guess on that note, I have a question for you, Avi. The question is, all right, we're burning a lot of ETH gas.
00:32:27.584 - 00:32:28.008, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:32:28.056 - 00:32:57.754, Speaker B: ETH is deflationary against the backdrop of this high gas environment, which is occurring because of the meme coin frenzy. Then you have bitcoin transactions which are through the roof because of ordinals, which maybe you could explain in a minute. But should we just get used to this higher blockchain activity paradigm? What does it mean for price? And what does it mean for supply and demand of block space? Is there an investment thesis there?
00:32:58.774 - 00:33:58.214, Speaker A: So all very, very good questions, and ill start by saying the best thing that Ethereum ever did was eIp 1559 for itself. It opened the door for so much institutional capital to come into space. I gave a talk last week at a conference that was filled with a lot of pension fund allocators, a lot of institutional allocators. And that was the second session in the morning, and I got an obscene amount of questions on it. And one of the things that I brought up was, hey, Ethereum is generating a substantial amount of money a year in, quote, unquote, revenue through its fee burn, right. If he annualizes out to $5 billion a year and burn fees, that's pretty substantial buyback, right? Quote unquote ETH is deflationary. And this is all during a bear market.
00:33:58.214 - 00:35:11.894, Speaker A: It's not even a bull market. Ethereum prices, it's up to start the year, sure, but it's not like we don't have a frenzy by any means. And so that really hit home for a lot of people. And so what I'm seeing is that if as activity really picks up, you're going to get a lot of people that are actually going to start buying based off of the back of that. There was a note put out by a sell side desk on ETH being deflationary. And a lot of allocators are looking at that very seriously in a way that is actually quite bearish for things like Solana. Even though my prior bullishness on Solana notwithstanding, I'm still bullish on it short term, midterm, maybe lost long term because of the fact that if these l one s don't generate fees in the same way and burn those fees and generate revenue for their shareholders in the same way that Ethereum does, allocators are just way less likely to come in and buy it.
00:35:11.894 - 00:36:22.250, Speaker A: And so you get this sort of funny. Like, let's like it honestly is a little bit funny to me because let's say you had these two, these two, these two platforms, Ethereum, and like a different version of Ethereum where the fees were 100th the size and they had the equal, equal amount of activity, you might actually end up getting a lot of allocation to the first one instead of the second one because it like looks better on a, on a basis, even though moving forward you might actually see all that activity move over because of the fees. But right now at least, because all eyes are on Ethereum, because that's where the speculative money is, because that's where the market participants are, they're able to charge those fees. I do like the New York analogy for Ethereum. It's like, yes, Manhattan's expensive, but it's expensive for a reason, because everybody's there and everybody that you want to be around is already there. So I do think that that is at least floating around the institutional circles as something that, hey, crypto now is actually revenue generating. It's now real.
00:36:22.250 - 00:37:03.768, Speaker A: It's now a thing. And the beauty of proof of stake is that all of those fees that are burned and all the fees that are generated, by the way, all the fees that are generated are now paid back to owners of the asset. In bitcoin, it's very different. Despite activity going through the roof, all of those fees are paid not to the holders of bitcoin, but to an extractive third party entity, miners. What you get is you just get a worse dynamic, because the more activity that exists on bitcoin, actually, the more supply of bitcoin is probably going to.
00:37:03.776 - 00:37:23.952, Speaker B: Hit the market, and it also deteriorates the user experience. Binance just halted withdrawals briefly over the past 48 hours because the bitcoin network was experiencing so much usage and traffic that just basic wallet transfer transactions were delayed to a point that even Binance was like, hey, we need to hit the pause button here.
00:37:24.048 - 00:37:25.444, Speaker A: It's crazy to think about.
00:37:26.044 - 00:38:09.144, Speaker B: So it is what you mentioned about how the stakeholders of ETH are aligned because they literally are staking it and earning the rewards and processing the blocks, constructing them, and the fact that in bitcoin, you don't have that. On the one hand, the security of the bitcoin network is possibly more robust, but on the other, its usability as an l one is. There's a flaw there. So, I guess, should we be worried about bitcoin? Like, bitcoin has been the trade this year, GBTC has outperformed bitcoin, but pretty much nothing else in crypto land has, with the exception of a few smaller protocols.
00:38:09.264 - 00:38:36.008, Speaker A: Should we be worried that miners. Miners have done pretty well. And actually, this is probably very bullish for miners, and I don't know if that's being reflected in price. And I also don't know if, like, the street has figured this out yet. And so you actually could see some, like, really good. Okay, I just have an alert here. Bitcoin transaction fees are exceeding 6.25
00:38:36.008 - 00:38:56.810, Speaker A: BTC block reward for the first time since 2017 just got sent out. So you might have, like, whatever has been projected for minor revenues this quarter, you might actually have that just be blown out of the water and then, like, come earnings time for these guys, you could get a pop. If the street hasn't realized, they'll figure it out.
00:38:56.842 - 00:39:41.374, Speaker B: That's a great point. I mean, marathon stock is up 173% this year. It's crazy because I was referring more tokens and token looking things, but yeah, no, you have a great point with these miners. I guess the question is, should we be worried about bitcoin dominance as a result of the fact that transactions have exploded on bitcoin, an l, one that isn't necessarily built to work like Ethereum and is deteriorating its ux? I would think. No, I think eventually these ordinals and ordinals are bitcoin nfts in the shortest possible explanation. I think this is going to die down and I think bitcoin is going to remain a usable network. But if it doesn't look out below.
00:39:42.634 - 00:39:57.650, Speaker A: I actually think the opposite. I think that what probably happens if I were to chart out a path, is that we get tech, we got a tech solution to this, we don't get a die down solution to this.
00:39:57.722 - 00:40:06.790, Speaker B: There's no community of developers that's all in agreement working on bitcoin the way that there is on ETH. Like, they're bitcoin core devs, but they're split into factions.
00:40:06.902 - 00:41:03.472, Speaker A: Yeah, but ordinals were developed. These BRC twenties were developed. I think what's happening right now is you're seeing the origin sparks of an organic development community for bitcoin. I think you're 100% right in that it doesn't exist today, but I would bet that in a month, in two months, in three months, like, the number of people that are trying to figure out how to build on bitcoin, probably two xs over the next month or two months, based on this activity, because, like, people flock to where you can make money at the end of the day. And the reality is that you can now make money building on bitcoin. So it might be very difficult, but I think people are going to try and they might not. It might not work, but there's going to be an effort made, because if you figure it out, like I'm already seeing right now, the.
00:41:03.472 - 00:41:09.632, Speaker A: So right now, when you buy these BRC twenties, it's all sorts of, like, it's kind of messed up, right.
00:41:09.688 - 00:41:18.480, Speaker B: Just for the listeners, what, what is a BRC 20? Just for the uninitiated? And I'm going to pretend that I know what I'm talking about and then just take notes on what you're saying.
00:41:18.552 - 00:41:57.710, Speaker A: So ordinals are effectively nfts on bitcoin, a BRC 20, that has nothing to do with it in ERC 20 in a technical sense. It's not like it's a token standard for building on bitcoin, this thing with it. ERC 20 is like a standard token built on Ethereum. A BRC 20 is effectively still an NFT, but it's just like a bunch of the same nfts that are all fungible. And so they're kind of quote unquote like tokens. Right? So, like when you. You can go to BRC Dash 20 IO and you can see all the top BRC twenties, it's just a play on words again.
00:41:57.710 - 00:42:22.644, Speaker A: And when you go and actually buy and sell these things, you go to a marketplace. I'm forgetting the exact name of the. Of the website. I'll pull it up in a second. But you go, you go. You go in a marketplace and it basically lists them out, like in lots of a hundred or lots of a thousand at like different prices as you would see on Opensea. Like when you go on Opensea and you see a collection of all these different nfts.
00:42:22.644 - 00:42:56.054, Speaker A: Well, it's the same thing with these BRC twenties, except that they're all the same. They're just like varying amounts of them. So it's like 101,000, 10,000, 1 million of these pepe BRC twenties. And so there's no, like, exchange for them yet. It's more of a listing of these nfts that represent different amounts of different amounts of the tokens. But someone right now is working on building an amm for them. I'm like, they're pushing commits to GitHub.
00:42:56.134 - 00:42:59.942, Speaker B: That's one work with developers working on Bear Jonah, instead of.
00:43:00.118 - 00:43:11.520, Speaker A: Exactly, if you ask me. Are they going to pull it off? I have no idea. I don't even know if it's technical. I'm not the most technical guy in the world. I have absolutely no idea if it's possible to go actually build out on bitcoin. I don't even know what it would look like if he did.
00:43:11.552 - 00:43:15.792, Speaker B: You got a whiteboard behind you, so we know you're halfway technical and serious.
00:43:15.888 - 00:43:20.800, Speaker A: Yes. As an investment professional. Yeah. Whiteboards mean you're very technically proficient.
00:43:20.872 - 00:43:25.072, Speaker B: I have an HP laser jet. That's my claim to fame here.
00:43:25.248 - 00:43:30.016, Speaker A: It's legit. I have a Cisco phone. Stratfi. Whoa. I know, right? Whoa.
00:43:30.080 - 00:43:30.684, Speaker B: Nice.
00:43:31.464 - 00:43:39.854, Speaker A: I, like, regressed. Went back in the world like 20 years, pick up this thing. It's actually super useful, by the way, but I'm. I'm so big on phone calls now.
00:43:40.914 - 00:43:42.242, Speaker B: What, landlines?
00:43:42.378 - 00:43:46.534, Speaker A: Yeah. No, just like phone calls in general. I hate zooms. I've grown to really hate them.
00:43:47.354 - 00:43:55.586, Speaker B: Well, welcome to my generation. I totally sympathize. And if you ever want to have a phone call, like, I'm right here, I have a telephone waiting for you to dial it.
00:43:55.690 - 00:44:07.104, Speaker A: It's just like. Because when you're on Zoom, then you have to, like, look them in the eye and pay attention. This is. Anyway, it's a whole thing. Like, get on the phone, you go walk around. I live on the beach. You go walk up and down the beach.
00:44:07.104 - 00:44:13.800, Speaker A: Used to get the same stuff done, but you're, like, moving so much better. Anyway, I completely lost my train of thought.
00:44:13.912 - 00:44:34.760, Speaker B: It doesn't matter. I mean, I think in every episode, we have to spend at least three minutes talking about something unrelated to crypto and trading. Last time, we talked about going outside and chilling out for a bit. Now we can just imagine Avi Feldman walking on the beach with that. That giant. That phone with the giant antenna. The 1980s cell phone from Wall Street.
00:44:34.760 - 00:44:39.004, Speaker B: Michael Douglas starred in that movie. I don't know if you know who he is, Avi, but he's an actor.
00:44:40.344 - 00:44:41.164, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:41.784 - 00:44:49.112, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, hop on the phone. Forget about Zoom for a little bit. Maybe. That's our 1000 x piece of zen for this week.
00:44:49.248 - 00:44:54.240, Speaker A: Yeah. Maybe we should start ending these podcasts with a piece of advice, like, maybe.
00:44:54.352 - 00:44:56.256, Speaker B: A piece of unsolicited props.
00:44:56.280 - 00:45:03.070, Speaker A: Like, they're completely unsolicited. We'll try our best to not make a terrible piece of advice. Yeah.
00:45:03.142 - 00:45:14.310, Speaker B: We're both wearing black t shirts today, so it probably shouldn't be fashion related. We're mourning the loss of the days when no one cared about Ethereum and bitcoin block space. Now it's a big frenzy in New York.
00:45:14.342 - 00:45:18.670, Speaker A: It'd be very fashionable. But this actually has some stuff on it.
00:45:18.782 - 00:45:21.350, Speaker B: We've got the casino symbols.
00:45:21.382 - 00:45:40.650, Speaker A: The sega to sig shirt. Actually picked it up at some. Like, they held some tournament in my college a long time ago while I was in college. At my college, when I was in college, they held some sort of tournament for trading, like, algorithmic trading, like, a bunch of the firms in Chicago.
00:45:40.842 - 00:45:44.562, Speaker B: I think, that you clearly didn't win, otherwise he'd be working there.
00:45:44.738 - 00:45:46.738, Speaker A: No, no. Didn't.
00:45:46.786 - 00:45:49.226, Speaker B: Won later. And that's what America's all about.
00:45:49.410 - 00:46:14.664, Speaker A: One later. It was also, like a really, like, it was a very silly event. It was just very unrealistic the way that it was put together. But anyway, that's what I'm gonna blame on the fact that I didn't win. Is that so? Okay, the piece of advice, if you ever fail, just make sure you blame somebody else for it. Hmm.
00:46:15.604 - 00:46:55.856, Speaker B: I would rephrase that and sort of spin it back to crypto trading as follows. I would say you're gonna fail, but just make sure that when you fail, you don't die. And that way you're still around to catch what hopefully is the next success. I think crypto involves weathering some pretty difficult periods of time financially. And so if you can stay in a trade, that staying power ultimately turns you into the contrarian who ends up reaping the asymmetric rewards after, you know, everybody else gets out of the way.
00:46:56.040 - 00:47:07.856, Speaker A: I don't understand why you do this to me. Like, I clearly. I was, like, clearly joking with my piece of advice, and you come in there with some, like, real advice to give, to give to people to make me look bad. Jonah, are you kidding?
00:47:07.920 - 00:47:17.000, Speaker B: I mean, we could go back to the automatically generated transcript here, Avi, but I needed to. I need to throw something in there. You've been doing like, 70% of the talking on this one.
00:47:17.152 - 00:47:18.712, Speaker A: We'll get you talking on the next one.
00:47:18.808 - 00:47:21.176, Speaker B: I had a lot to say. I want to hear your. I want to hear what you.
00:47:21.200 - 00:47:21.896, Speaker A: You have to say.
00:47:22.000 - 00:47:27.640, Speaker B: You have a lot more crypto experience than most, so it is ultra, ultra valuable for me. For me as well.
00:47:27.792 - 00:47:46.760, Speaker A: Well, then, the next time, we're going to have a very special guest on this podcast, and a very interesting guest, someone that you probably have never heard on podcasts before, because I don't think he's ever done a podcast before, but he's one of the most successful traders in american history, so I'll leave you with that.
00:47:46.832 - 00:47:59.784, Speaker B: Again, none of this is investment advice. Crypto is risky. But great having you on 1000 x. And thank you so much for joining. We know your time is valuable, and we really appreciate you listening in.
00:47:59.824 - 00:48:05.768, Speaker A: Very much so. And I will reiterate, none of this is investment advice. Thanks, Jonah.
00:48:05.936 - 00:48:07.144, Speaker B: Thanks, Avi. Till next week.
