00:00:00.400 - 00:00:16.385, Speaker A: Look, I'm a bull. That's why there's a bull behind me. That's why when you look screen, it's green. There's no more bear. Bear's gone. We got rid of the bear. But I do think that it's very possible that we're just entering into a new downtrend.
00:00:16.385 - 00:00:46.765, Speaker A: The people that bought below, they're probably going to sell 60k, and then 60k turns into. Turns into resistance. It'll be very hard to get people to buy an asset like crypto, which is so volatile if you can go 30% down in a week. And this is what we've learned in basically every major crash scenario, is that there's no such thing as an uncorrelated asset when things are falling apart. If the equity markets continue down, then Bitcoin's, in my personal opinion, still in big trouble.
00:00:46.885 - 00:00:57.115, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Perennial Finance, the on chain Defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the Defi native. You'll hear more about Perennial later in the show.
00:01:04.815 - 00:01:17.231, Speaker A: Welcome back to another God. You can tell. You can tell. I've been starting to charge too long. Can't even talk properly right now. Jonah, I don't know about you.
00:01:17.423 - 00:01:25.937, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty fried. Not like anything's going on in the markets or anything. Avi, I don't know. Have you seen anything happening in the charts?
00:01:26.081 - 00:01:37.233, Speaker A: No. I mean, what did I do this weekend? Went to West Virginia, saw my parents. They met my girlfriend. Nothing really else happened, you know?
00:01:37.409 - 00:01:38.665, Speaker C: Yeah, same.
00:01:38.785 - 00:01:41.933, Speaker A: No. Oh, is Bitcoin 55k right now?
00:01:42.041 - 00:01:43.559, Speaker C: Oh, did it.
00:01:43.668 - 00:01:45.783, Speaker A: Did it hit 49?
00:01:45.889 - 00:01:48.655, Speaker C: Did I miss something? That's a big move.
00:01:49.395 - 00:01:51.135, Speaker A: That's crazy. We should probably talk about.
00:01:51.835 - 00:02:07.043, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, we should probably. We should probably make this an emergency episode of the Thousand X podcast for everybody out there, including ourselves, who's just wondering, giant, WTF is going on right now? Kind of. Kind of emotions.
00:02:07.139 - 00:02:13.495, Speaker A: I mean, I'm also wondering WTF is going on One thing which was insane. Do you see the VIX chart?
00:02:13.885 - 00:02:16.705, Speaker C: Yeah. Oh, my God. That's a wild chart.
00:02:17.205 - 00:02:34.545, Speaker A: Yeah. And the craziest thing is it's the third highest peak ever, but nothing happened. Like. Like, if you really think about it. Right. Vix hit 65. Nasdaq is off 15.
00:02:36.285 - 00:02:36.925, Speaker C: Nothing crazy.
00:02:36.965 - 00:02:50.075, Speaker A: Right, Right. Like, it's a. The equity markets. Yeah, they're down. Yeah, we had a bad day, but during COVID we went down 30%. Vix didn't do that. Or Vix.
00:02:50.075 - 00:03:01.855, Speaker A: Vix did that. That. But it took you know, a 30% drop from November of 21 to the bottom went down 40%. Vix didn't do that.
00:03:02.875 - 00:03:39.549, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the last time VIX was up here, there are a couple of times. One of the times was Covid when there was like an outbreak of an unknown virus that was just like killing people. And then the other time that I remember pretty vividly was 2008 when I worked at Lehman Brothers, and The Vix hit 65. And then it was kind of like, hey, here's a cardboard box. You should put all this, all your stuff from your desk in the cardboard box because your company doesn't exist anymore. Like, this time hit 65 in the VIX, the volatility index. It's just sort of like, why? Like, what, what is going on? I have a theory.
00:03:39.549 - 00:04:44.759, Speaker C: And like, as you can tell from our relatively blase conversation here, I, I don't think either of us is particularly worried about this one. I don't think either of us is the bed. We're going to get into it, get into it deep on this podcast. But like, for me, the lower the sort of general volatility landscape gets, the calmer things are, the bigger the positions you need to run in order to make, you know, the same kind of money that you were making during what, you know, previous volatile environments. Right? So in 2022, one unit of risk will generate, you know, X return or x volatility. In 2024, volatility is so low that you knew, you know, you know, you need two, three or four units of, of risk to generate that same X level of PNL variance. And so I think what we've been seeing is just like after some really wild years of COVID and Ukraine wars and regional bank crises, people have made a lot of money.
00:04:44.759 - 00:05:20.821, Speaker C: And I think speculative participants across the board, across the investment landscape now need to deploy much more risk in order to generate commensurate returns. And when you get an unwind of a crowded trade, if everybody has a lot of risk on, you can see some pretty crazy moves. So to me, this is just like a technical unwind type trade. I don't think there's anything fundamentally flawed about the economy. I don't think there's a supply shock, a demand shock. I don't think that we're seeing some sort of like, crazy thing happening out of left field like Covid. I think this is just like classic textbook.
00:05:20.821 - 00:06:00.057, Speaker C: Everyone crowded into the same trades in size, dollar, yen, carry trade, short options, long crypto, long stocks, long AI. All of These crowded trades and then when they start to look a little bit shaky, I honestly think that maybe the election odds tipping a little bit away from Mr. Ipump Markets has been a bit of a catalyst for this. It's starting to look a little bit shaky. You see all these people with a lot of risk on and it crowded trade thinking, huh, I'm up a lot this year. I want to protect these returns. I'm, you know, time to get out, time to de risk.
00:06:00.057 - 00:06:09.233, Speaker C: And everybody from Buffett on down to, you know, your, your three figure retail trader on crypto Twitter is doing the exact same thing at the same time.
00:06:09.409 - 00:07:09.985, Speaker A: It just seems to me, as you just eloquently put that this is just one massive deleveraging event and it's a growth story as well, which is why equities, equities are puking. And I think it's just the combination of these things that is leading to the sell off. It's nothing, it's nothing that we haven't seen before. It's actually pretty in line like you would expect something like this even in, even in a bull market. So it's not as scary as previous sell offs which I think we've been, we've been going, going back and forth and saying. But that being, that being said, still went down a lot, right? I mean from peak, from recent peak to the recent low, bitcoin went down 30. That's actually, that's, that's a big, that's a big move, right? And I think a lot of people got carted out over the weekend just to help people think about how these things tend to go.
00:07:09.985 - 00:08:01.279, Speaker A: When you get sell offs into a weekend, trends tend to continue. Why? Especially selling, specifically selling. Because most people are not going to be allocating or buying heavily over the weekend. People aren't going to make decisions to initiate new positions over the weekend, especially big money. But what people can do and what they often do is they reduce existing positions or they play with existing positions positions. And when the trend is down, when it was down on Friday, down on Saturday and Sunday is an extremely illiquid day in general, you tend to want to just stay away from doing anything on a Sunday. Like you don't want to buy the dip on a Sunday, which I did a little bit but got blown out.
00:08:01.279 - 00:08:39.695, Speaker A: But that's just the lesson that I think people should take away is you almost never want to fight the trend on a Sunday. The flip side of this is sometimes you get a move on a Sunday where it's like a flash like maybe Sunday morning goes up or a weekend liquid, you know, maybe weekend buying tends to be very on, you know, on and then off. So if market moves up on a, on a Sunday, maybe you want to sell it. Market moves down a little bit on a Sunday, maybe you want to sell it. But we were, we were selling off on Friday. Saturday, Sunday you just don't fade until you get some sort of liquidation event normally.
00:08:39.735 - 00:08:47.999, Speaker C: Hey, Avi, let me interrupt you for a second. Some guy is in our stream yard saying that you tweeted the stream yard link. So you should probably untweet that.
00:08:48.167 - 00:08:52.475, Speaker A: Oops. I mean, can they see us?
00:08:53.655 - 00:08:54.135, Speaker C: No.
00:08:54.215 - 00:08:58.595, Speaker A: Oops. I took a screenshot. I said we're recording an emergency pod.
00:09:00.775 - 00:09:03.191, Speaker C: Cool. Anyway, back to what you were saying.
00:09:03.223 - 00:09:07.727, Speaker A: Sorry. I actually feel like if they can't see us recording, does it matter?
00:09:07.911 - 00:09:17.631, Speaker C: Oh, GCR just connected. Or somebody who's pretending to be GCR just connected. All right, Kick from studio. Fuck. All right, so we're just going to get all these random people in here.
00:09:17.743 - 00:09:20.595, Speaker A: If they can't see us or hear us, it's kind of fun, no?
00:09:20.895 - 00:09:28.939, Speaker C: Yeah, we're just going to have random people in here. It could be like radio where we just invite random people on to say extreme shit.
00:09:29.067 - 00:09:34.175, Speaker A: And it's kind of like, it's kind of like an Easter egg, you know, it's like if you find the link, then you get to hang out here.
00:09:34.915 - 00:10:03.679, Speaker C: Yeah, there you go. All right. Anyway, so you're saying don't buy dips on Sundays because it's extremely illiquid. And also like, what I would add to that is it's a Sunday in August, right? Like this is when the big risk takers are out on vacation. They're on their, their, their yacht in Santropay. They're not like thinking, all right, time to get go all in buying this dip. Especially since this dip isn't some like weird crypto idiosync thing that's going to mean revert on a Monday when markets open, right? Like this is.
00:10:03.679 - 00:10:07.911, Speaker C: This is being driven by bigger macro markets than crypto.
00:10:08.063 - 00:10:55.221, Speaker A: Well, that's the part that confused me is I thought that it would be reverted and it was a bit. Right, so basically throughout the entire session today, we've gone up at market open at 9:30. We are trading 50K. We're now trading 54. So we reverted. It just so happened that we died horrifically up until then. Right? So the, the real move, the real move down started Sunday at 8pm so we're trading 58k Sunday, Sunday at 8pm and then we nuked down to 9, we nuked down to 52 and then we had one more puke down to 49 and that, and then, and then we cleared out.
00:10:55.221 - 00:11:34.307, Speaker A: I think a lot, a lot of the supply, which I, you know, right now, the way that I think about this is if you want to play this from the long side, you have to understand who's selling. Most people got carted out. Most of the buyers got completely destroyed. So the only people that are selling right now are the people that bought the bottom of which there were very few. And so it might take a while to chew through supply of. But the reality of the situation is that there's not that many people left to sell unless something crazy happens. Right.
00:11:34.307 - 00:12:05.699, Speaker A: If equity markets keep nuking, that can be crazy. If, you know, we don't go up for two weeks, three weeks, then. I think people that are holding bitcoin get very nervous about holding too long because normally bitcoin tends to reverse reasonably, reasonably quickly. And I think a lot of people start de. Risking alts in that scenario. I actually think bitcoin's probably okay in that particular scenario. It's just that alts are going to get totally destroyed.
00:12:05.699 - 00:12:35.273, Speaker A: So people are going to slowly trickle out of Solana. They're going to slowly trickle out of all these random things. But bitcoin probably just, just chops around unless you get a shock. Right. And I don't know what that shock would be because I think the two, the two major shocks were just earnings that were really bad and then major cap tech selling off aggressively and then the yen trade unwinding.
00:12:35.449 - 00:12:39.065, Speaker C: There's also a bad payrolls number.
00:12:40.325 - 00:12:48.825, Speaker A: Yeah, but the services number today was okay. Yeah. So I mean I, I don't view this as a, as necessarily existential.
00:12:49.685 - 00:13:27.303, Speaker C: Yeah, me neither. I mean, I think that I like. Okay, so I've had mixed success, to put it generously to myself, like pretty actually not limited success, just like trying to step in and buy like catch the falling knife when it's falling this fast. Right. Like I, I'm, I'm so not worried about this sell off. This has none of the hallmarks of like a proper bear market that's just going to nuke the economy and nuke, nuke the middle class and nuke the average investor and business alike. This just doesn't look like that doesn't smell like it, it doesn't feel like it.
00:13:27.303 - 00:13:51.797, Speaker C: And as market participants with a little bit of, you know, you know, a little bit of experience now, we've unfortunately seen what real bear markets look like quite a few times in our short careers, and it's. It's like this just isn't one of them. Right. It has none of the hallmarks of that. However, it feels dumb to just be like, all right, thing just came off. I'm gonna. I'm just gonna go dive right in there and catch this falling knife.
00:13:51.797 - 00:13:55.745, Speaker C: Like, it feels like you get hurt pretty bad. So I don't.
00:13:56.285 - 00:14:05.693, Speaker A: You have to manage your risk effectively. Yeah. At the end of the day, I mean, you can't get. You can't get taken out of the game. The most important thing in crypto is to just never get taken out of the game.
00:14:05.749 - 00:14:08.105, Speaker C: Survive so that you catch the next upswing.
00:14:08.605 - 00:14:09.425, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:09.845 - 00:14:43.237, Speaker C: So, like, I think what would be dumb would be to suddenly add a bunch of line items here. Just start, like, going. Going shopping for random altcoins and meme coins and doing stupid. I think that. I honestly think that the smartest thing you could possibly do in this market is either hold steady or if you're gonna buy, like, buy bitcoin or cons or consolidate line items into Bitcoin. Because I do think bitcoin dominance is gonna. Con.
00:14:43.237 - 00:14:45.829, Speaker C: Is gonna, you know, rally from here.
00:14:45.997 - 00:14:51.759, Speaker A: After sell offs like this. You're 100, right? I've seen this happen over and over and over. Bitcoin dominance goes up.
00:14:51.917 - 00:14:52.275, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:52.315 - 00:14:55.855, Speaker A: Unless you get a very, very sharp reversal. Reversal.
00:14:59.235 - 00:15:00.411, Speaker C: Like you.
00:15:00.563 - 00:15:20.217, Speaker A: Sorry, Sir. Bitcoin dominance 10 tends. Tends to go up. So the way that I'm trying to play this market right now is I'm. I am buying some alts. I'm buying alts that I really think could have idiosyncratic strength or that have a narrative behind them, including things like helium. But.
00:15:20.217 - 00:15:39.545, Speaker A: And ton. But basically, other than that, I don't really like touching alts. I like touching BTC and potentially soul. And even then, I don't know if I love eth. One thing that really so many people, I don't know if I can curse on this podcast, but curse all you want.
00:15:39.705 - 00:15:40.885, Speaker C: I'm here for you.
00:15:41.745 - 00:16:10.365, Speaker A: One thing that, like, really, really, really hurt is all of the people that were long ETH and eth BTC because of the etf and then they just got. They just got taken out back. Yeah, that's. That. That. That's tough because I think a lot of people viewed that as a quote unquote safe trade, which is a reminder to everyone out there that's investing. Anytime you feel super comfortable with the trade, probably the wrong trade.
00:16:10.365 - 00:16:21.085, Speaker A: In fact, almost always the wrong trade. So what I would say is in this, in these types of environments, do the hard thing.
00:16:21.825 - 00:16:25.085, Speaker C: Yeah. And buy bitcoin.
00:16:25.985 - 00:16:30.245, Speaker A: Yeah. Jonah, is buying bitcoin hard for you right now? That's the issue.
00:16:30.825 - 00:17:11.147, Speaker C: It's a little hard for me. I mean, I'm not like fully allocated in the way that, you know, younger people without kids and families are fully allocated. Like, a lot of the guys that I talk to who are in their 20s, they have literally 100% of their net worth in crypto. Me, like, I had a career in oil before crypto. So I, you know, at this point I'm trying to defend some capital as well as grow it. So I have a sort of a maximum threshold that I allow myself to be allocated to crypto, like a maximum percentage of my portfolio. And I'm at that percentage.
00:17:11.147 - 00:17:12.735, Speaker C: So I could lose discipline.
00:17:13.035 - 00:17:17.555, Speaker A: If it keeps going down, then your percentage of portfolio will go down too, Right?
00:17:17.635 - 00:18:12.179, Speaker C: Yeah, that's true. But I mean, honestly, what's happening this time? Like, it's going down a little bit, but it's not going down by too much because again, everything's nuking right, so except bonds. So obviously, like, I'm as this, as this sell off happens. Like my crypto equity balance is like kind of still almost preserved, but now I'm getting more overweight fixed income, which probably isn't the stupidest thing in the as as we go into a rate cutting cycle. But like, you know, honestly, like, where I'm at right now mentally is I could lose discipline and just yolo more cash and rotate stuff into crypto or not. And I'm, I think where I'm personally feeling like gut feel I have some fear about adding more to crypto given that I already like, maxed out. Like, I'm so bullish.
00:18:12.179 - 00:18:16.815, Speaker C: But I need to maintain discipline because I don't want to get myself into trouble, you know?
00:18:17.555 - 00:18:27.615, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's, I think that's very fair and I think a lot of people would do well, just listen to that advice, which is that you just need to maintain discipline at the end of the day.
00:18:28.135 - 00:19:11.257, Speaker C: Also, like, what's weird, you know, it's funny, like, when I had no money whatsoever, it was very stressful to take risk because I grew up in a, you know, raised by baby boomers who said, you know, a penny saved is a penny earned and don't take risk. And, you know, I sort of came of age during the 2000s under the, you know, G.W. bush administration when the stock market literally did absolutely fucking nothing for 10 years, right? So it wasn't just like this guaranteed, oh, investing makes you returns kind of mindset. I was like, you know, mostly in cash for my early career. It was very difficult for me to get used to taking risk in my pa. Obviously at work I took a lot of risk. But then, it's funny, like now things have changed for me.
00:19:11.257 - 00:20:09.505, Speaker C: I've been a trader for 20 years, but as they say, like, mo money, mo problems. I still get that same weird stress that I used to get when I was like 20 years old, you know, buying, like buying stocks because I, you know, when markets are absolutely nuking, it's, it's hard to take hard earned money and just like throw it in front of the, throw it into the, you know, into the arena, hoping that, that you don't get it blown out. That's not to say that I don't do it on occasion, but for me, like, crypto is a momentum asset. It's reflective, as you always say, Avi. And I think that I've gotten really hurt in crypto just trying to catch the falling knife. Made a lot of money in crypto buying early on recoveries, buying that upward momentum once it seems like the shitstorm has passed. And to me, this shitstorm is just positioning.
00:20:09.505 - 00:20:43.353, Speaker C: So I'm going to wait and see just how deep and how savage this unwind truly is. I don't know how long the world is. These short ball carry trades that are unwinding right now, maybe it's over, maybe it's not going to be over for a few months. But one thing that I'm damn sure of is that, you know, in a, in an election year, you're not going to have the government hang the middle class out to dry and just like stand silently on the sidelines while the American populace gets absolutely obliterated and elects them out of office. That just, that just doesn't seem like an outcome.
00:20:43.449 - 00:21:06.111, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Perennial Finance. Perennial is quickly becoming one of the go to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of Defi. So let me tell you a little bit about them. There are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on. First one, great trade execution. Second one, low fees. And third, of course, an on chain permissionless platform.
00:21:06.111 - 00:21:45.457, Speaker B: And Perennial nails all three of those buckets with the launch of Perennial V2. They've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as Faster Oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds. Lower fees, competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers. Fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there. And fourth, cash settled, right? The trades are cash settled in USD, not in crypto. Perennial allows you, the trader to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the tvl. How it works is that Perennial enables a two sided market made up of both traders and liquidity providers.
00:21:45.457 - 00:22:13.333, Speaker B: Right. Traders deposit the assets to get levered exposure while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position. Perennial allows you to Trade crypto perps, FX and coming soon, NFTs and more. Backed by some of the best investors in the industry, Perennial is a must check out platform. If you're a crypto trader, go check them out by clicking the link in the description. Give thousand x some credit. Go check out Perennial, you're going to love them.
00:22:13.333 - 00:22:14.917, Speaker B: All right, let's get back to the show.
00:22:14.981 - 00:22:28.905, Speaker A: The thing is, do you, do you think that the Fed cares about the equity markets or normal? Yeah, hell yeah. They talk about, you know, credit spreads but you know, equity markets.
00:22:29.205 - 00:23:06.095, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they can. I mean look, the first thing that equities and credit are part of the same corporate American capital structure, right? Equities are obviously riskier and credit is secured so it's less risky. So equities go first and credit follows and they're highly correlated. So you know, when I used to trade high grade credit, the index of high grade credit insurance called IG CDX or cdx, ig, it's just correlated with the vix. Right. Like when volatility goes up, the price you pay to ensure bonds goes up, meaning bonds go down. Like bond prices go down.
00:23:06.095 - 00:23:40.283, Speaker C: So it's. Or, sorry, credit spreads widen. Excuse me, it's late, but yeah, it's just, it's literally, it's just one interrelated system. And the equity part of the capital structure moves faster and earlier than the debt part. But it's all connected. And so like I think the only thing that investors should be actually worried about, like the only way you lose your shirt is if there's a credit crisis and you and everybody you know and the company you work for and everybody else's employer are forced to do things at irrational prices when they don't want to do them. That's what credit crises are all about.
00:23:40.283 - 00:24:36.137, Speaker C: We haven't had a credit crisis since 2008 because the Fed and the treasury and basically like the bureaucracy in Washington D.C. stopped letting those credit crises happen. They basically just transferred risk from balance sheets of individuals and companies onto the balance sheet of the government. And that happened again in 2020. Happened like in many little ways in 2013, 2018, 2023 with the regional banks. Like it keeps happening. So if this thing metastasizes into a credit crisis where suddenly you can't access capital, you need to get a home or to grow your business, or if credit really dries up, which just seems like totally out of the question to me, but let's just say that it happens, right? If, if the, the bureaucracy in Washington D.C.
00:24:36.137 - 00:24:59.837, Speaker C: decides to just let that, let that go, right, and not do anything about it, not buy asset backed securities, not cut rates, not print cash. If they just let it go, they're not just going to be taking one crisis worth of medicine, they're going to be taking like 15 years, 16 years worth of post global financial crisis worth of medicine. And the stock market's going down to.
00:24:59.861 - 00:26:01.325, Speaker A: Like what if they are like that's a question that people have to answer is what if they aren't? If we don't have a reason to step in, so why did we step in last time when we had a sell off this fast, this hard? It's because it was Covid. There's a political reason to step in now because there's no political reason. It's just happening because it's happening. Is there enough backing to come in or are people going to go up in arms back? I, I, I do think the one, you know, the one bullet point that's good is that this is happening during an election cycle. And so the people that are currently in charge are very incentivized to con, to continue the bull market. And so there might be some level of political pressure on the Fed. Even though it's, you know, not, not necessarily the best thing in the world.
00:26:01.325 - 00:26:43.549, Speaker A: The qu, the question is when it does happen, how can you even tell, right? And why? I am an advocate, at least right now of look, I'm a bull. That's why there's a bull behind me. That's why when you look screen, it's green, there's no more bear. Bear's gone. We got rid of the bear. But I do think that it's very possible that we're just entering into a new downtrend. And the reason is because, I mean the people that bought below, they're probably going to sell 60k and then 60k turns into, turns into resistance and Unless the world becomes less scary.
00:26:43.549 - 00:27:00.495, Speaker A: So unless you do get intervention, then people will be very hard, it'll be very hard to get people to buy an asset like crypto, which is so volatile. If you can go 30 down in a week, right, that's, that's a pretty scary asset. I mean, so what do you think.
00:27:00.535 - 00:27:12.087, Speaker C: Happens when let's say intervention is announced in one form or another? Let's just say it's the Fed comes out with a 50 or 75 basis point cut. That's kind of interventionist. What do you think crypto does?
00:27:12.271 - 00:28:02.355, Speaker A: I think, I don't think 50 points would be construed as interventionist. I mean, it's priced at 60%. So the way that, I mean, maybe 75. Sure, we gotta, gotta take a look at the, gotta take the probability that that is being priced in right now. I mean, but I think that if the Fed does intervene in a meaningful way or the treasury intervenes in a meaningful way, then crypto is probably back at the highs. But the question is, is that, is that going to happen and can you even, can you bet on that? Right? Can the, the worst thing that would happen to this market is that people bet on it and then it doesn't materialize and then we're probably looking at 42k. I do still have trouble wrapping, wrapping my head around the probability that let's say Fed, treasury, whatever, they, they step in, they, they back, they backstop, they backstop the market.
00:28:02.355 - 00:29:02.447, Speaker A: This makes me nervous because it might provide a short term sugar rush, but the question is, once you've capitulated from backstopping the market for a financial crisis or a pandemic to we're backstopping the market solely because credit spreads blew up because earnings are bad and you know, the bank of Japan raised rates and that caused a sell off, then you're near the end. And I don't think I'm smarter than everyone else and I don't think I understand this, the macro market better than everyone else, but it's pretty obvious to me that that would signal that we're getting close to the end of the Fed's ability to actually prop up this market. Because if there's no real reason to do it other than the fact that, well, the market is weak, then that signals that it's no longer an action that you take in an emergency, but now it's regular action that's needed in order for the market to not die.
00:29:02.591 - 00:30:13.649, Speaker C: Well, the Fed has a dual mandate, right? I kind of disagree with you on this. They're basically, they're, they're supposed to pursue two goals, maximum employment and price stability. Price stability obviously refers to the price of like goods and services, not price of equities. So I like, I know that market stability technically isn't part of their dual mandate, but they always take it into account because as, as capital markets crash, companies do lay off people, right? Like they like it filters through. If they're, if the stock market is careening lower and it looks like we're headed for a real problem, like companies will batten down the hatches and they'll, they'll tighten their budgets and they'll fire people. So there's sort of like an indirect feeder effect into that, that employment part of their mandate. So that's why they pay attention to, you know, falling equities markets.
00:30:13.649 - 00:30:56.001, Speaker C: I take your point. The big difference between this and sort of like previous environments during where they did a bunch of stimulus was that in this environment rates are high. Like in previous, during the ZIRP era, the only thing the Fed could do, I guess it wasn't even the Fed, it was the treasury, which could print dollars and the government could spend those dollars on stimulus. Right. So that's sort of like modern monetary theory, quantitative easing, whatever you want to call it, tarp, like those, that's the last resort shit, this time interest rates are north of 5%. You can just cut them. And that's a much more effective tool for managing volatility.
00:30:56.001 - 00:31:39.663, Speaker C: Right. Than qe. So while I do agree with you that we're in like kind of a problem zone, that the, that governmental bodies, be it the Fed or the treasury, are going to try and manage something as stupid as a positioning driven unwind, I think what that tells you is you should be long term bullish bitcoin because that shows you that bureaucrats have lost the plot a little bit and they are starting to kind of deviate from that dual mandate and instead try to keep people high on that sugar rush that you just mentioned, which is not their job. It's bad. And bitcoin is ultimately the only thing that's going to. It's like gold. It's digital gold.
00:31:39.663 - 00:31:52.035, Speaker C: It's basically a foil to frivolous central bankers who debase dollars in an attempt to provide short term results for their own careers and political parties.
00:31:52.195 - 00:31:54.055, Speaker A: It's just never acted that way.
00:31:54.835 - 00:32:03.779, Speaker C: Bitcoin is, didn't in 2021 when there was just ludicrous stimulus for no reason, didn't bitcoin just take off?
00:32:03.947 - 00:32:49.835, Speaker A: Yes, but so did the rest of the equity markets. I don't think there's ever been a period of extended period of time where the equity markets have done poorly and bitcoin has done well. And that's sort of the issue is that, and this is what we've learned in basically every major crash scenario, is that there's no such thing as an uncorrelated asset when things are falling apart. And the reason there's no such thing as an uncorrelated asset is because there's almost nobody that singularly holds one asset. Everyone has a portfolio. And when you have a portfolio and everything else is going down, then you actually still, you rebalance, right? You sell the goods, you sell the stuff that's going up by the stuff that's going down to rebalance. And so what that leads to is that leads to just everything going down.
00:32:49.835 - 00:33:28.625, Speaker A: And even then, it might not be that you're rebalancing, it might be that you're meeting margin calls. It might be that you're getting dicked somewhere and you need to. You need to save yourself. So the issue is that if the equity markets continue down, then bitcoin's, in my personal opinion, still in big trouble. And yes, we might get to a spot in the future where you have bitcoin go up against the equity markets going down because people genuinely, genuinely are worried about the stability of the dollar, the stability of the financial system. And then people buy bitcoin. But that's a, That's a reason about.
00:33:28.625 - 00:34:08.391, Speaker A: That's a reason to own Bitcoin, 100k calls. That's a reason to own, like, Bitcoin, 200k calls. Because I guarantee you, the moment that that happens, the moment that that happens, Bitcoin's going 150k in a short period of time, not a long period of time. Because in the situation where. Can you imagine the situation where everything is down 10% and Bitcoin is up 20, that's going to create the biggest FOMO in the history of fomo. I mean, if. If I were sailor and I had gigabillions of dollars to deploy into the bitcoin market and I could move the price of bitcoin or support the price of bitcoin, that's like, I don't understand why he buys when he does.
00:34:08.391 - 00:34:30.843, Speaker A: It makes no sense. It's like he always buys at the worst possible times. It seems what I would. I would always and only buy during periods of stress so that bitcoin can always out. Like, always looks like it outperforms the downside. And then you create this image of, image of stability, sailor. If you're listening to this when it gets released, let me know.
00:34:30.843 - 00:35:02.975, Speaker A: I, I can, I can consult for you for one bitcoin an hour. You're gonna make a lot, you're gonna make a lot more money. You just listen to a few pieces of advice. Promise, you know, it's, it's just, it's just one of those things again where, you know, I am, I'm definitely nervous for the short term. Mostly, mostly for alts. Not, you know, if bitcoin trades down to 45 from here, that's got, that's got to be a low. I think that at 45, people would look at that and they would say to themselves, well, this is a great risk reward trade.
00:35:02.975 - 00:35:36.911, Speaker A: If Trump is going to get elected president and he loves bitcoin and bitcoin just sold off almost 50% from the highs, you know, maybe I should probably buy, right. I think that's what's going to go through people's heads at that point. So I think that the Trump narrative, the Trump announcement, what he was talking about, gives a bitcoin a floor in a way that you never really had a floor before. So I'm, I'm definitely, I'm, I, you know, I definitely go all in at that level. Not financial advice.
00:35:37.103 - 00:36:07.187, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, me too. But I think it's harder to do that with alts, right? Like, because alts, okay, let's say you, let's say you get to that level in bitcoin and then you look at your favorite alts and you're thinking, okay, well you know, there's two ways of looking at it. One is like, well, okay, I want some cycle bags. I'm going to add here. Another is like, okay, I think we're going to get a bounce back. Let me pick the highest beta thing. The problem with, with picking alts for a bounce back is that if you're wrong, unlike bitcoin, those alts could go down another 90%.
00:36:07.187 - 00:36:35.045, Speaker C: Right. And then when you finally do get your rebound, maybe you don't even make it back to your high water mark or your purchase price. Whereas bitcoin, it feels like, does perform to the downside. So I think alts and memes, like, that's, that's like the catch up trade when we're already in the banana zone, right? When bitcoin is sending and eth ascending and Solana is sending and alts are still like, they haven't really started to outperform yet. I think once we're in safer.
