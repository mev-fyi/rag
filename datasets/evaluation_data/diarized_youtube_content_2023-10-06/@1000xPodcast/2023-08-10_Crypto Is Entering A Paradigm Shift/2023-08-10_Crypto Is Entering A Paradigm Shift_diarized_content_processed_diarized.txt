00:00:00.800 - 00:00:40.068, Speaker A: It's very clear that the environment for crypto is shifting. Right? You have the ETF, you have the stablecoin, the ripple lawsuit. I don't know what's coming next, but it's clear that they're green shoots in a way that there weren't prior, and that makes me more bullish. And so if you were a listener on the last podcast and you heard me waxing bearish, I'm changing my tutorial. Alright, guys, welcome back to the thousand x show. Just came back from a nice vacation in Greece. Just got to disconnect for a bit.
00:00:40.068 - 00:00:46.108, Speaker A: Catch some octopi, sit. Eat feta cheese and delicious greek salad on the beach.
00:00:46.196 - 00:00:47.064, Speaker B: Octopi.
00:00:47.364 - 00:00:52.522, Speaker A: Octopi, for sure. Octopi. Have you ever watched my friend the octopus?
00:00:52.708 - 00:00:58.126, Speaker B: No, I haven't. Maybe another generational thing. Yeah, no, no, this is like.
00:00:58.150 - 00:01:07.510, Speaker A: This is like a Netflix documentary about some south african guy who made friends with an octopus. And I think the whole point of the documentary was to try to convince you not to eat them because they're really smart.
00:01:07.582 - 00:01:11.430, Speaker B: He also sounds smarter than the dude that made friends with a hippo and then got eaten by it.
00:01:11.462 - 00:01:14.462, Speaker A: No way. The dude made friends with a hippo and then got eaten by it.
00:01:14.478 - 00:01:19.450, Speaker B: Yeah, he was, like, riding it like a unicorn or a horse for a while. Then one day the hippo was just like, enough.
00:01:19.542 - 00:01:25.098, Speaker A: I don't like you anymore. Got you. Got to be. Oh, okay. No, here it is, man. Mauled to death in South Africa. Also.
00:01:25.098 - 00:01:41.242, Speaker A: South. What is it with South Africa? A lot of animals down there. Yeah. He's several times described the hippo as his son. Yeah. Six year old pet hippo. He went to swim with him when he goes in the water.
00:01:41.242 - 00:01:45.454, Speaker A: Humphrey, he named him Humphrey. Allows him to get on his back and ride him like a horse.
00:01:46.304 - 00:01:46.592, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:46.608 - 00:01:54.480, Speaker A: This guy's nuts doing swimming with a hippo. These things are, you know, more people die from hippos a year than die from lions. Where.
00:01:54.512 - 00:01:57.008, Speaker B: Where does the octopus death count factor into that?
00:01:57.136 - 00:02:03.776, Speaker A: I don't know, but there apparently is an octopus called. What is it, a blue. It's like a blue ring octopus or something like that.
00:02:03.840 - 00:02:07.904, Speaker B: Is it just ring face when you're underwater and then suffocate you or drown you or something?
00:02:07.984 - 00:02:27.030, Speaker A: They're extremely venomous. They're found in tide pools from Japan to Australia, and they are only five to eight inches long. They are extremely dangerous if provoked when handled, because their venom can kill somebody very easily. So have you ever seen octopus with blue rings on it? Just whatever you do. Don't touch it.
00:02:27.182 - 00:02:31.646, Speaker B: Sounds like certain altcoins, doesn't it, Abby? You know, just stay away.
00:02:31.750 - 00:02:33.594, Speaker A: Definitely some bit like bald.
00:02:34.334 - 00:02:36.154, Speaker B: What happened? What happened with bald?
00:02:36.574 - 00:03:11.000, Speaker A: Was it in bald? Alto? Blue? Is it the logo? Because base is all blue. Honestly, I did not pay too much attention to what was going on with bolt. All I know is that it's just a continuation of every time you get a launch of a new protocol, like a base or a sui or an aptos, there's always going to be meme coin. And 50% of the time, that meme coin is going to ruck. We're basically, you were early or you were dead. That's it. In the case of the octopus, I think you're just dead, and you got to avoid it.
00:03:11.000 - 00:03:58.734, Speaker A: I don't think there's much money to be made on picking up venomous octopi, but in terms of altcoins, you're early or you're dead. And that's the way that I think about it. Although there have been two very notable exceptions to this rule, one of which was Pepe, and the other is apparently Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic, Inu ten, which has done remarkably well, it actually seems to be holding remarkably well. So that's been kind of interesting to see, is there are some that last long enough to be able to just create a cult community around them, and then you're good.
00:03:59.724 - 00:04:28.772, Speaker B: So I kind of disagree with you on Pepe. If you were early, you obviously did quite well. If you had bought into that sort of early pump, the thing was only out for, like, three days, you could have said, all right, I'm early. It's only three days old. If you bought it, then you'd be down 80% from there. Or even if you bought it sometime in June, you'd still be down 50%. So Pepe's had its sell off.
00:04:28.772 - 00:04:53.344, Speaker B: I mean, look, Avi, just more broadly speaking, this year, if you just held BTC, or even more intelligently, if you'd held GBTC, you would have outperformed most discretionary hedge funds, right. That trade crypto and do research and actually, like, try to invest a lot of. A lot of effort and capital and time, you know, picking apart the space.
00:04:54.184 - 00:04:56.632, Speaker A: Most, but not all. I'll just leave it at that.
00:04:56.768 - 00:05:34.380, Speaker B: Yes, that is true. Only the best rise to the top, Avi, and I'm glad I'm podcasting with you, but at the same time, as somebody who's. I don't work at a hedge fund in crypto, Cumberland's a little bit different. But I guess the general approach that I've taken this year has been to sort of dismiss most of the space and focus on the coins, eats in bitcoin with an actual use case and products like Tobias and I go back and forth. Sometimes. I feel smart for doing that. And I guess this calendar year, the price action has confirmed that approach.
00:05:34.380 - 00:05:52.980, Speaker B: However, other times I wonder, like, hey, am I just being lazy here? I'm not particularly kicking myself for missing Pepe or that Obama coin, but maybe I'll miss the next big summer of some new, some new asset class within the crypto space. Just by ignoring all of this, what I perceive to be white noise.
00:05:53.012 - 00:06:27.448, Speaker A: It's a lot easier to make money on it on a bet, on an infrastructure play, because you're effectively betting on the index. So all of the money that flowed into crypto in 2021, they didn't have the chops to underwrite specific assets and specific applications. So what they would do is they would just put all of their money into index plays. And index meaning Ethereum or Solana or near or avalanche Matic. Effectively, you can say, all right, these are index plays on the applications that are on top of them. And that's why they radically outperformed. I don't think that's going to be true moving forward over the next five years.
00:06:27.448 - 00:06:53.626, Speaker A: I do think that in the short term that very likely to be still be true because we're not at the point yet where we're sophisticated enough investors to really start to parse these things out as an aggregate in the crypto market. And so I think l one still do reasonably well. I think were going to get a spike in bitcoin dominance over the next month. But I do think that then what ends up happening is that it starts to peter off. And the reason is I think that the ETF starts to get really priced in.
00:06:53.810 - 00:07:30.486, Speaker B: I dont think. Okay, so I have a slightly different view. Its similar, but a bit different. Basically, I dont think the ETF can get priced in until the ETF exists. And I mentioned this on previous podcasts and on Twitter normally markets pricing information well ahead of time. Uh, and that's because you have ample capital and dry powder in the market to price in, you know, whatever information may be available, uh, in bitcoin and east, when events are bearish, that is certainly the case. Like, plenty of length can come out of the market very quickly, as we saw last year, um, you know, ahead of, ahead of problematic events for the space.
00:07:30.486 - 00:07:59.312, Speaker B: However, length cannot be added easily at this point. Um, you know, I saw some statistics on glass node showing that the longs in bitcoin, which is just an easy asset to pay attention to because of the nature of the blockchain. You know, I think 65% of them have been held for over a year. Like the longs are quite like, like stagnant. There's not a lot of fast money coming in and out. If you're retail, um, in the United States. It's, it's kind of hard to access crypto, so you don't have this steady retail inflow.
00:07:59.312 - 00:08:07.770, Speaker B: I think an ETF, like a blackrock or an arc ETF ark. By the way, their first approval date is this Friday. We're expecting, you know, it's very, it's.
00:08:07.802 - 00:08:09.506, Speaker A: Very likely going to get delayed, would.
00:08:09.530 - 00:08:54.512, Speaker B: Be very likely to get delayed, like until you have one of those instruments, like the capital that you would need to reprice crypto to the levels where crypto is accessible via an ETF, just doesn't exist until the ETF comes in. So I think this is one of those very rare opportunities in the market where well telegraphed information just can't be priced in because the telegraph, it's reflexive, to use your word. The well telegraphed event is that a gateway of liquidity will open at some point. So you do kind of have to, you have an opportunity to get ahead of it. So I challenge your month, I take the over and then I think BTC dominance trickles down from there as interest sort of returns to the space. But just a question for you on that. Holy.
00:08:54.512 - 00:09:31.722, Speaker B: You make a very good point about how altcoins will come back in the post XRP ripple ruling world. I agree with you, but I dont think its going to be a 2021 thing where everyones euphoric about all altcoins and they go up like crazy. I think youre going to have things like arbitrum and optimism. Ethereum based altcoins rally or out form dy DX is an ETH based product. But what about Alt l one s like Solana and near and some of these other ecosystems could do very well or just die. We don't know.
00:09:31.778 - 00:10:09.742, Speaker A: What do you think? My view is that they're going to come back. I just think that this is a similar conversation that we had last time, but around the greed. I just think that that's inevitable, that there's going to be enough greed to pump these things higher. I do want to talk about the bitcoin ETF for a second. It's very possible that the initial reaction to the bitcoin ETF is outflows from GBTC. So a lot of people that have that trade on, people probably end up trying to redeem from GBTC. There are a lot of people that have been stuck in that asset for quite some time.
00:10:09.742 - 00:10:58.996, Speaker A: And so I do think that it's possible that there's some negative, there's an offset to the pure positive. And nine times out of ten, what we see is the event marks the top of the trend, right? I mean, basically every single time ive seen an event in crypto thats marked the top. People talked about the ETF in October of 2021 and when it came out, that was the literal picotop. People thought rumors sell the fact. I mean, people talked about the Coinbase IPO that was within a week of the top in April of 2021. I mean, these things tend to get front run very, very, very hard. Billions of dollars in front running.
00:10:58.996 - 00:11:36.774, Speaker A: That's why I'm not sitting here and I'm saying, hey, I think that we've topped now because I think that the front running can still occur. But what I'm saying is that by the time the event occurs, the likelihood that we're going higher post the event is pretty low, in my opinion. I think people just start to exit at that point and there will always be somebody that says this time is different. And the argument that you're going to hear over and over is, well, it's a spot ETF. It's a better product than the futures ETF. And the reality is that the futures ETF was a product that people wanted in October of 2021. And prior to that, it didn't exist.
00:11:36.774 - 00:11:46.198, Speaker A: Now, if you want access to bitcoin, you can go buy long dated futures on the CME. You can buy microstrategy, you can buy coin.
00:11:46.246 - 00:11:49.334, Speaker B: But it is terrible on those long dated futures though, right?
00:11:49.374 - 00:11:52.206, Speaker A: I mean, but you can, at an.
00:11:52.270 - 00:11:57.834, Speaker B: End market, to buy a futures ETF, you pay something like ten to 12%.
00:11:58.214 - 00:12:09.468, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that parts, obviously, that part is the reason why the spot ETF is important in the long run, because you can't hold. You just can't hold these things.
00:12:09.556 - 00:12:28.252, Speaker B: No institution is stupid enough to weather ten to 12% roll yield from contango. Like everyone's learned that lesson from the USO or commodities ETF's. It's just, it kills you. That's why I think the spot ETF is consequential. It'll allow your random hedge fund to trade bitcoin.
00:12:28.348 - 00:12:43.774, Speaker A: Jonah, one thing that I was thinking about, have you, have you been paying attention at all to the semiconductor narrative? What's going on with LK 99?
00:12:44.354 - 00:12:58.454, Speaker B: I have, I guess I listened to a couple podcasts on it, and I was struck by the fact it sounds like a 25 delta, that it's something that will be real in like three to five years.
00:12:59.954 - 00:13:15.012, Speaker A: Here's something that I've been thinking about is there seems to be other things that are interesting that are on the periphery of technological breakthroughs that aren't crypto, and that is probably harming allocation to crypto.
00:13:15.188 - 00:13:18.636, Speaker B: So, for example, I mean, AI was the first big, big sort of blow.
00:13:18.660 - 00:13:20.396, Speaker A: To crypto, where everybody in crypto is.
00:13:20.420 - 00:13:23.624, Speaker B: Like, shit, we're not the hot new technology anymore.
00:13:24.004 - 00:13:30.664, Speaker A: Like, it's possible. What do you think? If Chad CPT hadn't come out this year, do you think that crypto would be higher?
00:13:33.204 - 00:14:14.950, Speaker B: No, not at all. Ultimately, again, I have a slightly different thesis from you. I'm losing faith in the multichain world. I think that most non ethereum ecosystems will die. I agree with you that if you believe in blockchain based applications, you're effectively putting your bets on ETH. I think that chat GPT, by proving a use case for emergent technology, basically invalidates a lot of what is going on in the altcoin space. The sort of long tail of crypto that people were investing in speculatively for years.
00:14:14.950 - 00:15:22.868, Speaker B: Chat GPT just reminded people that new tech can actually be useful, whereas, like, your coin number 500 just has no use case or users whatsoever. Chat GPT is bad for that stuff. I don't think chat GPT or super, you know, superconductors or any of, you know, cold fusion or whatever's next is going to matter for bitcoin and ETH. Each of those has its own narrative. Narrative for bitcoin is, you know, it is a candidate for global reserve asset slash digital goal, peer to peer money that will supplant maybe the bottom 50 of the world's 180 recognized fiat currencies as well as it has, you know, it also has a role in challenging central banks not to debase their currencies too much. That's bitcoin off to one side. To the other side, you have ETH, a database that is owned by no one and everyone, and there is use for that because, you know, if you have something like a deed to your house or a certificate of authenticity for that piece of art that you bought, like, why should it be stored by some random startup that'll probably go bankrupt, it should be stored in incredibly neutral database.
00:15:22.868 - 00:15:50.864, Speaker B: So you have those two things and I think there's real use for both of them. And if you're ignoring it, maybe you're just focused on your little developed markets lens and you'll see what value it's providing to other people. ETH has a stablecoins base layer use case as well. We're going to talk about that in a second. But the rest of this shit, theres definitely a case to be made. As we keep going back to Mike Novogratzs comment on this podcast. Were in the show me phase for crypto chat.
00:15:50.864 - 00:16:33.414, Speaker B: GPT has done a show me. Now if you look at anything thats non bitcoin and non ETH, you look at it with a real skeptical, kind of stroke your beard type, quizzical look and say what is being shown? What use case is being shown? And to your earlier point about Pepe and Obama coin, I do think that meme coins are kind of a cooler, more fun version of the lottery. We've talked about this on the podcast as well, so that there is a use case that you can't ignore. Community is sort of a use case. But like yeah, I think chat GPT is bad for useless things or things that haven't proven a use yet. What do you think?
00:16:34.394 - 00:17:14.626, Speaker A: Yeah, I dont disagree with any of that. I actually agree with everything that you just said in the long run. I think in the short run my take would be that theres definitely been some VC capital, some Silicon Valley capital that may have gone to crypto that pivoted out and went to AI stocks, for example. Theres a lot of fast money in Nvidia. I would assume some of that fast money, if AI hadn't existed, would have found a home in crypto. There would have been some percentage of that that would have bought bitcoin as their gambling fix or bought Ethereum as their gambling fix or bought Pepe or whatever.
00:17:14.690 - 00:17:15.322, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:15.498 - 00:17:34.480, Speaker A: So I do think that there's some of that. But then the flip side becomes true, right. Which is that once you get peak saturation of these memes, then crypto can start to go Zen. Crypto can actually attract some flows again.
00:17:34.672 - 00:17:35.688, Speaker B: That's a great point.
00:17:35.776 - 00:17:36.144, Speaker A: Right.
00:17:36.224 - 00:17:47.444, Speaker B: Because the capital isn't stuck in Nvidia forever. As soon, you know, Nvidia is priced to the moon now and bitcoin hasn't yet, still kind of lows relative to potential. So could just flow right back one day.
00:17:48.184 - 00:18:16.994, Speaker A: That's a little bit of what I'm thinking is that it will actually do that, um, over the next call it, you know, two to two to three months. I'm definitely on the last podcast. I was a lot more bearish. Where were we trading? We were trading like thirty k at the time. I was, I was a lot more, I was a lot more bearish. Now I'm a lot more constructive. I think just from a technical standpoint, we retested 28 five.
00:18:16.994 - 00:18:44.528, Speaker A: You know, I think that that 27 area was the original, was the original target, but we clearly stepped into demand. You see today, Nasdaq down 1.5%, bitcoin up 1.83. Just across the board, all coins have started to do okay. A lot of them just havent come off as hard as I would have expected given the way that bitcoin is performing.
00:18:44.656 - 00:18:47.612, Speaker B: Its been a while since cryptos outperform the Nasdaq.
00:18:47.768 - 00:19:12.904, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I can't even remember last time this happened. So I think on all accounts just crypto is looking a lot healthier. It's looking better. It looks like we flushed a lot of the speculative capital. We found pockets that we found pockets of demand. So I'm definitely feeling a lot better now than I was before, Preston.
00:19:14.194 - 00:19:38.730, Speaker B: I think that's why in the absence of the Blackrock ETF filing, which triggered that massive rally in June, the space just sort of trickles a bit lower with an occasional micro pop and then trickles lower again. I think it's going to take. I think maybe you mentioned this earlier, Abhi, maybe some guidelines need to be laid down.
00:19:38.802 - 00:19:48.854, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so too. The PayPal thing was really interesting to me because it made it very clear that that's exactly what the regulators are trying to do.
00:19:49.014 - 00:19:51.474, Speaker B: What happened exactly with PayPal for the listeners?
00:19:51.894 - 00:20:46.924, Speaker A: So PayPal got their, they got their stablecoin approved and there was a lot of noise around, well, the controls around the stable coin and they could wipe your balances and they control things, but that doesn't matter. They can do that with your current money anyway. And we never really expected a centralized financial institution to lean in very heavily into the decentralized ethos. But let's put that aside for a second. What does this mean? It means that there is a regulator out there that stopped meta and stopped Facebook from issuing their stable coin, that sued Coinbase, but is okay with PayPal issuing a stablecoin. And so what is very clear to me now, more so than it was before, is that the government of the United States doesn't dislike crypto. They just want to make sure they can control.
00:20:48.744 - 00:20:50.448, Speaker B: The gateway to crypto.
00:20:50.616 - 00:20:57.312, Speaker A: Right. Control the gateways to crypto. It's not about shutting it down, it's about making sure the right people are the gateways.
00:20:57.368 - 00:21:03.052, Speaker B: But they do have a lot of scale. Like PayPal has four to 500 million users, Coinbase only has 100.
00:21:03.168 - 00:21:03.444, Speaker A: Right.
00:21:03.484 - 00:21:04.852, Speaker B: So that means that there are a.
00:21:04.868 - 00:22:03.190, Speaker A: Tremendous amount of people that could come into crypto because of what PayPal is doing, which is good, and that's bullish. Now the question is obviously, what does, what does PayPal do now? Are they going to stop with their stable coin? Right now they list four assets. They list bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin and bitcoin cash for some reason, and now theyre going to have a stable coin. Are they going to start taking on Coinbase? Are they going to start listing other assets? Are they going to win the approval to go trade different things when Coinbase is currently facing scrutiny from the SEC? I mean, thats a question that you have to ask, especially as an investor in this space, which is what, what, what is going to happen next with PayPal? What are the downstream effects from this?
00:22:03.222 - 00:22:05.526, Speaker B: I think at the margin it makes.
00:22:05.550 - 00:22:41.372, Speaker A: Me personally less likely to own Coinbase, makes it, you know, maybe more likely, we want to own some PayPal in your, in your, in your portfolio. Now all of this, all of this to say, it's very clear that the environment for crypto is shifting right now. You have the ETF, you have the stablecoin, the ripple lawsuit. I dont know whats coming next, but its clear that theyre green shoots in a way that there werent prior. And that makes me more bullish. And so if you were a listener on the last podcast and you heard me waxing bearish, im changing my tutor.
00:22:41.388 - 00:23:54.514, Speaker B: But I think the other big thing about this PayPal, stablecoin, if you zoom out, lets say that PayPal just had carte blanche to do whatever it wanted with crypto and there was no interference from any government. PayPal could issue a, PayPal could just issue their stablecoin, make an interest bearing, right, and then tell merchants, hey, if you set up a PayPal wallet, when someone swipes their PayPal card at your coffee shop or newsstand, we won't charge you credit card fees, you just get interest bearing money yielding five and a quarter percent wired within block time, 13 seconds from the user's account, your customer's account to yours. Then suddenly you've disrupted Visa, Mastercard, JPMorgan and Bank of America. No one needs a checking account or a credit card anymore. It's just ludicrous benefits there. So obviously there are a few roadblocks between that happening and where we are today, but it's a first step along that journey, and it shows you the promise of crypto for developed markets. In developing markets, PayPal, Py USD is just like a no brainer.
00:23:54.514 - 00:24:44.474, Speaker B: I think that's why you're seeing things like USDC losing market share. I think on the highs, their market cap is 55 or 60 billion, I haven't checked, but now it's only 30 billion. Tether is hovering around 80, but deep pegged by ten basis points recently on DOJ headlines. And you're going to have a world, sort of a binary world, where crypto looking things are either blessed and flourishing or just under constant attack and threat of being shut down. You're going to see continued FUD in some of those assets that aren't necessarily in the good graces of the institutions that will ultimately be dictating what crypto looks like. If that's how this ends up playing.
00:24:45.294 - 00:24:51.646, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree with all that wholeheartedly. It's going to be really interesting.
00:24:51.670 - 00:25:05.684, Speaker B: For the record, though, I still think tether is a great product. I think it offers a real solution to the developing world, and I do not think it will get interfered with nearly to the extent that crypto Twitter does. I think it's here to stay.
00:25:05.984 - 00:25:10.324, Speaker A: You think so? Why? Why? You don't think that DOJ could take it down even if they wanted to?
00:25:12.344 - 00:25:21.404, Speaker B: I mean, I wouldn't go that far. I just don't think they will. I think they have, frankly, bigger fish to fry.
00:25:22.864 - 00:25:56.046, Speaker A: I thought it was kind of interesting how. How Heather started to. As tether. As tether started to de peg around all these rumors around Huobi and the shadiness that's going on there. Just how quickly these things tend to reverse. Every time there's some amount of nervousness in the market, people just try to attack tether. And it's been through so much at this point that I view it as very unlikely that it has a hole.
00:25:56.046 - 00:26:15.328, Speaker A: The risk that I see with tether is purely that the DOJ decides to come after them and say, hey, these guys are facilitating money transfers to sanction nations, and we don't want that at all. We don't want any of that. And so we're going to shut them down. Everybody's going to get their money back, but they're going to stop operating now.
00:26:15.376 - 00:26:22.352, Speaker B: The thing is, that wouldn't result in a deep, though. That would be an orderly unwind is, has a hole, which I agree with you.
00:26:22.448 - 00:26:36.564, Speaker A: Oh, I don't think it has a hole, but I think that there's some amount of time value. For example, imagine if it takes you two months to go get your money, then tether will deep a little bit as people try to get their money, get their money sooner. Right. It's like, you know what?
00:26:36.684 - 00:26:45.964, Speaker B: Well, you're saying like if, if so much of the float tried to redeem all at once, that it may overwhelm the mint redeem mechanism that keeps it.
00:26:46.084 - 00:27:53.148, Speaker A: If I were tether, what I would do personally is I think it would be a lot better for the industry to have. If you're going to operate something like that, you probably want to break yourself up and just take the liquidity hit. You probably want to have three different stable coins, three different companies. And even if a network effect isn't there, just insulate yourself from, from risk a little bit. But yeah, I think that the risk from tether is very low relative to the risk from a huobi or an Okex or a binance going down. I think at this point, one really interesting conversation that I had with somebody that's very close to the scene in China right now. They said that the first iteration and first wave of everybody that built abroad were kind of people that were very likely from shady backgrounds to begin with.
00:27:53.148 - 00:28:35.720, Speaker A: And they just got in early to crypto because that was the type of person that got in early. They built very big companies and then they institutionalized them as time goes on. But there's a new crop of people coming in that are coming. The X Tencent ex Alibaba people that it's like the Silicon Valley wave that's coming in now, especially with the, with Hong Kong opening up a little bit, so that you're going to see better, less shady and more straightforward products offshore in the east, which I'm pretty excited to see, which is why I'm going out there next month for token 2049, which should be a pretty good conference. I'm trying to get a better read on that area of the world.
00:28:35.792 - 00:29:40.870, Speaker B: But I think what I realized is that business culture is not uniform across the globe. Right. So if youre going to trade a global fungible product, whether it be a hydrocarbon like lng or crude oil, or a dollarized form of value like tether or anything in between, bitcoin is the most salient example of this. People will, people in jurisdiction x will have vehement opinions about the asset that people in jurisdiction y adore. And vice versa. That's just how global commerce works, is it's nothing unique to crypto. And just, you know, to put a bow on that thought, the way that I'd close it out is like, I think it's a testament to the resilience and, you know, kind of staying power of bitcoin and ETH and a lot of stable coins like tether as well, that they are able to transcend those differences and offer product market fit across these vastly differing jurisdictions and opinions.
00:29:40.870 - 00:29:47.774, Speaker B: I think it's important. That's part of why I joined crypto. It started to look familiar to me when it started doing that.
00:29:47.854 - 00:29:56.342, Speaker A: Jonah, before we go, just because I'm very interested, and we've talked about crypto for 42 minutes now. Is the oil market interesting again?
00:29:56.518 - 00:30:44.588, Speaker B: Yes. What's going to happen in oil, for all of you crypto fans, is you're going to have high interest rates impact production, just like the business of digging oil out of the earth becomes so much more expensive. It's very capital intensive for all commodities. But the timing of that sort of relationship between higher interest rates and less oil coming out of the earth, there's a delay there. It's like a six to 18 month delay. So I think what's going to happen, demand is forecasted to rise over the course of the next two years, but interest rates are going to curtail production as well as other factors, geopolitical factors in particular. And then I think you're going to get one of those things that happens in the twilight of the commodities sort of reign over a particular market sector.
00:30:44.588 - 00:31:20.684, Speaker B: In oil's case, it's transportation, where the commodity rallies substantially into that consistent rising demand against the backdrop of reducing production. And then you reach a price where it eventually just squelches demand, and then you get a pretty glorious sell off for people to trade it, followed by some wild volatility. And I think bitcoin will maybe do that in 100 years. But right now, bitcoins, where oil was in the late 18 hundreds, sort of proving product market fit and starting to rally. So very interesting ends of this. Barbell, what do you.
00:31:20.724 - 00:31:27.748, Speaker A: I mean, what do you think that's. I mean, I have no idea. You're the oil trader. I just wanted to ask you to get your opinion on this.
00:31:27.876 - 00:31:28.676, Speaker B: Oh, one last.
00:31:28.780 - 00:31:29.864, Speaker A: I think it's fascinating.
00:31:31.484 - 00:31:35.664, Speaker B: A lot of countries start buying and sell of oil denominated bitcoin one day.
00:31:36.684 - 00:31:39.344, Speaker A: You think so? You think just because it's a neutral asset.
00:31:39.924 - 00:32:08.998, Speaker B: I think it's because. And again, we got a wrap soon. But let's say that you are chad. You're producing oil, you sell it, then you get dollars for that sale. The banking system that delivers you those dollars is like t plus 17 days because you're an oil company in Chad. And then what do you do with those dollars in Chad? Convert them to local currency via somebody who's going to take your pants off on that transaction and then spend it. Or how does it work?
00:32:09.046 - 00:32:12.046, Speaker A: They're going to use bitcoin or it sounds like they might use tether or tether.
00:32:12.110 - 00:32:18.422, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think commodity trade will eventually start redenominating maybe stables, maybe bitcoin, maybe.
00:32:18.438 - 00:32:31.794, Speaker A: A bit of both. Definitely, definitely, definitely the gray market trade. I would do that. Yeah, makes sense. By the way, you heard it here first. Oil for bitcoin soon. Jonah, as always, it's a pleasure.
00:32:32.094 - 00:32:35.806, Speaker B: Great seeing you Avi. It's an awesome podcast. Thanks for taking the time.
00:32:35.910 - 00:32:37.354, Speaker A: Always says take care.
