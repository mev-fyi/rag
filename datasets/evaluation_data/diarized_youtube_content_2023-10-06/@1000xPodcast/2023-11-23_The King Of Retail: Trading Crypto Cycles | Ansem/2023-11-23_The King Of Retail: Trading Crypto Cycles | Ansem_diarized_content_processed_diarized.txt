00:00:00.400 - 00:00:04.406, Speaker A: We were like, should we get a retail trader on the show? Avi was like, yes. No brainer answer.
00:00:04.470 - 00:00:15.434, Speaker B: I view he was like the William wallets of retail. I would clarify. It's like, he's not very much so not retail, but the leader of retail.
00:00:17.694 - 00:00:20.014, Speaker C: I try to help him out, bro. I try to help him out.
00:00:20.094 - 00:00:21.918, Speaker A: The quarterback of retail.
00:00:22.086 - 00:00:22.834, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:23.774 - 00:00:31.314, Speaker A: Do you ever wear Jalen hurts style eye paint when you, when you show up to trading, bro?
00:00:31.354 - 00:00:42.314, Speaker C: You know what I should do? I should, like, I should do streams and come out, like, I'm like, I'm a football player. Like, full costume. I need, like, a man. Like, costume, bro. Like, stream.
00:00:42.474 - 00:00:47.094, Speaker A: Yeah. Just show up to a Solana hackathon with, like, the super turbo.
00:00:49.674 - 00:00:51.694, Speaker C: Warlord gear. No, I need that.
00:00:59.374 - 00:01:27.774, Speaker B: All right. Welcome back to a very special episode of 1000 X. We have a wonderful new guest. We got Ansem on who's going to be bullshitting around with us for the next hour or so as we try to unpack what's happening in the market, just for a time stamp. It is 01:53 p.m., Tuesday, November 21, and we're about an hour out from the announcement where Janet Yellen is going to talk about how she took down CZ.
00:01:29.034 - 00:01:47.020, Speaker A: So headlines are just slapping the tape right now. Markets whipsawing around BnB up and down 10%. We don't know what's going to happen. I don't know. We could break it down into scenarios. Like, if she says x, then why happens? And some. What, what, what are you.
00:01:47.020 - 00:01:48.224, Speaker A: How are you trading this?
00:01:49.444 - 00:02:13.158, Speaker C: Um, honestly, I'm expecting, like, uh, bitcoin to hold strong here. That's. That's what I've been, I've been looking at. I think alts kind of had their little run. They've done like two, three, x. I think all BGC fares are kind of topping, but bitcoin has been strong. Um, and I think if, like, if this, this regulatory news, basically, if it's just a fine and binance can keep, like, operating as they were prior to.
00:02:13.158 - 00:02:30.078, Speaker C: I think we're fine. I think we just keep, like, keep going up. We might, like, chop around a bit in the, like, 33 to 37 area. But I'm expecting bitcoin to break out before in the year. I also have coinbase. I have a ton of Coinbase. So, like, all scenarios are bullish.
00:02:30.078 - 00:02:30.994, Speaker C: Coinbase?
00:02:31.934 - 00:02:37.438, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you tweeted this out, but, like, basically everything at this point since Coinbase to infinity.
00:02:37.606 - 00:02:38.354, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:38.724 - 00:02:59.724, Speaker B: Like, no matter what the outcome is, unless, I mean, unless. Unless they come out and they say, every single exchange that has ever operated, we're going to come after you next. I guess that's the one scenario. But in that case, I mean, might as well just pack up, right? We'll go back to trading pink slips or something.
00:02:59.844 - 00:03:04.684, Speaker A: We war game this a little bit in my old place. We're chatting about this a bit before the podcast.
00:03:04.804 - 00:03:05.036, Speaker C: There.
00:03:05.060 - 00:03:42.588, Speaker A: There's sort of three scenarios, right? Scenario one is like CZ and handcuffs, like international manhunt, bunch of, you know, crazy OFAC AML violations. Scenario two is just limbo. We've been in scenario two for I don't know how long. It feels like years, but probably just months. We're all getting a little tired of it. And then scenario three is, is this where there's a manageable slap on the wrist and the thing just sends after a while because binance, CZ pay their fine, and Binance is still dominating the marketplace after that. So I don't know.
00:03:42.588 - 00:04:12.174, Speaker A: I agree with you, ansem. I think you're right. I think this thing just keeps chopping, but with an upwards trend. But I wanted to ask you, against the backdrop of what you just said, how long have you, like, tell us a little bit about yourself. How long have you been in crypto? Have you seen any scenarios similar to this during, during your history trading previous exchanges under fire? Well, like, how, how are you, how are you referencing this versus the, you know, the earlier parts of your career in crypto?
00:04:12.714 - 00:04:39.364, Speaker C: Yeah, I've been in crypto since like, 2017. Um, basically, I was, I was a software engineer before, but it was just trading crypto on the side. I was basically doing both, like, at the same time they were full time crypto. And, um, like, 2021, like mid 2021. Um, see, I've seen, like, I guess, two, well, like one and a half, one full cycle. And then I came in, like, midway through 2017. So I was like, I guess half was when I didn't know what I was doing.
00:04:39.364 - 00:05:12.388, Speaker C: But, yeah, I think it's similar to, like, the Bitmex lawsuit, which was in 2020. And that, I believe it was like Q 420 20. I referenced it earlier this year when the lawsuit against finance came out. I was like, yo, last time they did this, it was like, pico bottom. We just ripped it from, like, when that news dropped. I think it's kind of similar. It's like most of these things, if they don't shut down the exchange entirely, it's like, that's the peak fear when the lawsuit and everything comes out, and it's like it kind of gets priced in from there.
00:05:12.388 - 00:05:51.142, Speaker C: Like crypto is supposed to operate in a way such that it doesn't get shut down by one exchange, going under one exchange not being like not being in control of everything. Bitcoin is like on its own, it's its own thing entirely. And we kind of see that in the reaction to these markets when people are just like, no, fuck you, we're not selling our crypto because the government's coming after us. But yeah, I think earlier this year is when we bottomed around twenty five k. That was the initial lawsuit announcement. And now we're at, we're kind of like coming to the end of it. So it seems like we're kind of getting all the bad news out of the way.
00:05:51.142 - 00:06:01.318, Speaker C: With Blackrock on kind of the side of we're going to be pushing for all these ETF's next year. It seems like we're in like the final stage of the worst part of the regulatory stuff.
00:06:01.406 - 00:06:32.984, Speaker B: To me, this kind of came at a time where I was already thinking about reducing exposure a ton. So this actually makes it, this actually makes it way harder for me. I mean, you look at, I mean you're the biggest soul bull I know, but it definitely looks the weakest like it that it's looked in a very long time here. Like all the, all the spot that all the VC's that were chasing it that didn't want to buy at 19, they don't want to buy 25. They all bought it like 45, 50 when they got there. Then they got their little pop, little pop to 60. And now there just doesn't seem to be a spot in the market for this thing anymore.
00:06:32.984 - 00:07:17.402, Speaker B: And so the whole that, that dragged up, I think honestly everything in a sense. And obviously you had the BT, the BTC run as well. But now I'm thinking that it's back to BTCD. I think people had their fun with alts and what I'm kind of looking for is maybe we chop down to 34, 33, and then you just rotate right back, right back in alts and you get to allocate to all your small caps again. But right now it just, it looks kind of tough to be long. If you're just based on the charts, then the flip side of the argument is that binance removes everything that you're worried about. Then you just have the ETF, then you have the ETH eTf, then probably a solana etf after that.
00:07:17.578 - 00:07:18.314, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:18.474 - 00:07:26.854, Speaker B: So it's kind of one of the weirdest spots I think we've been in the last two months. The last two months were just so straightforward.
00:07:28.034 - 00:07:46.418, Speaker C: Yeah, no, for sure. For sure is rip everything now. I agree, though. I think. I think alts are like near, near top. Like all BTC pairs for sure. I def can see a scenario where it's like, we get a bitcoin breakout and alts pull back and everybody's like, whoa, I don't have enough bitcoin.
00:07:46.418 - 00:08:03.234, Speaker C: And then we get to, I don't know, like mid forties maybe. And then, like, when we pull back from there, that's when alts start having their fun again. When bitcoin's chopping around higher. Because I feel like people are just ignoring knowing bitcoin. It's really not that far off at the highs.
00:08:05.414 - 00:08:11.194, Speaker A: BTC D is on the highs, right? I mean, in that, in one sense, it's, it's not being ignored.
00:08:12.174 - 00:08:22.034, Speaker C: Pull back a bit. I know, yeah, you're right. It wasn't like 54 with the, like, 52. Now it's kind of popping again.
00:08:22.994 - 00:08:27.934, Speaker B: Yeah, BTC, BTC D flip 52% into support.
00:08:28.434 - 00:08:32.482, Speaker C: I know. It's fucking chart, dude. Yeah, I know that actually.
00:08:32.618 - 00:08:43.854, Speaker B: Like, I don't know how I feel about charting this, but that is a chart that is like, look, I mean, if, if I were to draw a line there, that would be a sexy line.
00:08:44.554 - 00:08:47.970, Speaker C: Now I'm looking at it too. I'm with you, so.
00:08:48.042 - 00:08:54.224, Speaker A: Oh, okay. So can you walk us through, do you think. Do you think of Solana as an alt? Is Solana an altcoin?
00:08:54.884 - 00:09:22.094, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely not. I think, like, this, this cycle will submit it as. As third. That's how I'm kind of looking at it. Just, I think this cycle, the focus for ETH is they're kind of pivoting to the modular thesis. And in that thesis, I just am not sure how the value gets distributed across the entire stack because there's like ten different l two s. All of them are going to have tokens.
00:09:22.094 - 00:09:54.802, Speaker C: Some of them are going to be doing off chain da versus using ETH for da. Some of them may use celestia for da. Some of them may use near for da, like eigen da. It's looking like ETH is going to be more of a settlement layer. And that transition from everything happening on Ethereum to Ethereum being more of a settlement layer and then the execution having happening on other blockchains is just. I'm not clear on how the value accrues across the stack, but I think it's pretty clear that Solana is on the complete opposite of that thesis. So it's like the integrated l one.
00:09:54.802 - 00:10:21.594, Speaker C: Do everything on the l one. You don't need to scale via l two s yet. And it's like the monolithic opposite of Ethereum. So you have the settlement layer, then you have bitcoin, and then you have one integrated l one. And I think they're, like, by far in the lead against the other l ones right now just because of everything that they've gone through and how strong the community is. Like, developer community. And the teams there now are, like, much stronger than they were a couple of years ago.
00:10:21.594 - 00:10:23.914, Speaker C: So I think they'll be like a solid three.
00:10:24.254 - 00:10:41.574, Speaker A: So you're an engineer, you said, can you tell us why so many engineers just love Solana? Is it an amazing engineering experience versus evm, something computer sciencey that us, like, finance guys can't understand? Help me. Help me get it.
00:10:44.354 - 00:11:29.696, Speaker C: I think they're just more, they're more practical on the scaling arguments, like of Ethereum versus Solana. Solana guys are not as focused on the fully decentralized. Like, everybody can run a node, everybody needs to be able to validate the chain. The Solana guys are like, no, if you're going to make us globally decentralized system that can operate at the same speed as Nasdaq, you're going to need some high powered machines that are the nodes operating this network. Then they focus on that as the practical way of how this is going to work long term. There's no really way of getting around there. It doesn't really make sense to do it any other way.
00:11:29.696 - 00:12:07.956, Speaker C: And I think, like, I don't know about the rust versus, like, solidity. How many engineers, like, prefer that? I know everybody in crypto is, like, very cool, like, very secure with the EVM. And I think that's why a lot of the crypto guys are so big on Ethereum and even the l two s who focus on the EBM. Barcelona attracts a lot of developer talent that don't really that experience in crypto already. So there's a ton of rust engineers outside of crypto don't know anything about crypto, but they know Rust and know how to, like, program a rust also. Solana gets a lot of those, a lot of that attention as well. But I, like, was a developer, but I have not been a developer in crypto.
00:12:07.956 - 00:12:14.024, Speaker C: I'm not going to claim to be like, I built things on ETH, built things on Solana. I don't have that frame of reference.
00:12:14.524 - 00:12:54.614, Speaker B: I think ETH just benefited in the last run from the majority of people that were getting in that were. That were getting into crypto or like, actually just general retail. You didn't get as many builders that were coming in, in my opinion, as you actually got on the tail end of the cycle. So on the tail end of the cycle is when people, okay, I made money, I quit my job, so I can start coming in, I can start developing. And so I think what you just saw, and especially in 2021, is across, across the board. You also just saw a lot of the people that were coming in were just building copycats. They were building all these useless applications, just a bunch of casinos.
00:12:54.614 - 00:13:30.914, Speaker B: And now I think we're finally getting away from that in some capacity, which has made me pretty bullish on just individual assets now. So there are a bunch of things that I look at that I couldn't really do this in 2019 and 2020, just stuff that I wanted to buy that I would feel comfortable holding for a year and just not thinking about it other than. Other than BTC and ETH. Bt and ETH were kind of it. And then everything else was just a straight rotation trade. And now I feel like there's stuff that I'm willing to hold for a long time. So, for example, I played prime.
00:13:30.914 - 00:13:42.728, Speaker B: It's a dope game. Like, it's actually, it's actually. It's like, okay, this is. This is like, this is usable. This is, I mean, like, fine. You know, it's valued.
00:13:42.736 - 00:13:42.880, Speaker C: I.
00:13:42.912 - 00:13:50.696, Speaker B: But I think, you know, you. I can hold that for the next six months and feel pretty confident there. But anyway, I mean, I just think that there's actually a ton of really.
00:13:50.720 - 00:13:51.448, Speaker A: Good stuff out there.
00:13:51.496 - 00:13:56.296, Speaker B: And I know you keep tweeting about the cycle bags, just like, yo, there are bags.
00:13:56.400 - 00:13:56.784, Speaker C: You just.
00:13:56.824 - 00:13:59.632, Speaker B: You just these, you hold on to them. You forget about it.
00:13:59.768 - 00:14:01.044, Speaker C: Yes. Write it.
00:14:01.504 - 00:14:06.364, Speaker B: What are your cycle bags? Show us so that we could buy them for you.
00:14:07.854 - 00:14:38.080, Speaker C: Oh, man, one of my cycle bags. Well, you just call one out, dude. But yeah, my mains are, like, this cycle, I think Coinbase, I like a lot. I think they're in a really good position with, like, the spot ETF's coming. They're going to be basically the custodian for all of those. And then also them expanding internationally with their perps and Coinbase cloud, like, for staking. They're working with a ton of other chains outside of just ethereum, too.
00:14:38.080 - 00:15:31.838, Speaker C: And I think they've actually pivoted really well to be more like crypto centric, crypto native with how they're operating. I know Coinbase got a lot of flack the past few years for not being in touch with what crypto people were looking for. And I think in the past few months they've done a really, really good job of that. I think the base l two is also super, super strong from a like retail onboarding perspective because they have so many KYC people on Coinbase. If they're able to get them onto actual like on chain, we have like 100 million people on the coinbase, like centralized exchange, but on chain, it's like me, Avi, like everybody on Twitter, like it's just like, you know, it's just like us. We need like retail onto on chain still. We haven't really accomplished that yet in crypto and I think base is one of the best chances of doing that.
00:15:31.838 - 00:16:02.330, Speaker C: So I like Coinbase. I love salon, as you guys know, for many reasons. I don't really need to go into detail there. I feel like parallel is actually one of my. I didn't expect it to be like a long term play, but I started looking more into it and the game is actually really complex and fleshed out as a trading card game. There's layers to it. Like you have to play it for a while to get good at it and really understand like how to be good at the game, which I think is really dope.
00:16:02.330 - 00:16:43.252, Speaker C: And you've seen them kind of pierce into the web two segment of gaming. Like people who play what's other card game, is it magic? Magic. The gathering I think is the other one. Yeah. So you people who play that and they like like parallel and what you tap that market of gamers who don't care about crypto but the game is good enough for them to play it and you have an option to onboard them without needing to buy an NFT or like whatever, know what crypto is. And then you have the crypto native people who also are going to be the first ones using all these applications. Prime is at a really cool intersection there where they can tap multiple different markets.
00:16:43.252 - 00:17:19.204, Speaker C: And then like I said the other day, I was like, this cycle is the one where we're going to see a lot more actual strong businesses come out other than just these exchanges which print money off fees. Because a game that people really enjoy and are willing to spend money in game to be better than other people and upgrade through the ranks, that's going to be a successful business if they can onboard a good amount of consumers that are willing to spend regardless of the market's up or down. I think you're going to see some businesses emerge this cycle and that could be one of them. So I, like, prime a lot.
00:17:20.464 - 00:17:42.748, Speaker A: Just looking at parallel alpha here, just on Opensea, looking at these trading cards. I mean, some of them are worthless. Some of them are trading for like one or two ETH. It looks kind of like magic. Is that what the experience is, like, magic the gathering? But because I always thought of magic as this amazing game, but, like, the exchange for cards is super shitty and you deal with these bit old men and they take you out here. It's just.
00:17:42.836 - 00:17:46.664, Speaker B: Wait, wait, back up, back up. Jonah, how do you know anything about magic?
00:17:47.924 - 00:17:51.868, Speaker A: How do you know anything about magic? Like, it came out during my high school years.
00:17:51.916 - 00:17:52.504, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:52.844 - 00:17:54.372, Speaker B: Did you actually play this game?
00:17:54.428 - 00:17:54.804, Speaker C: Yeah, of course.
00:17:54.844 - 00:17:56.940, Speaker B: Did you play magic? You played magic?
00:17:57.092 - 00:17:57.332, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:57.348 - 00:17:58.340, Speaker A: I mean, not like a lot.
00:17:58.412 - 00:17:58.940, Speaker B: I got.
00:17:59.052 - 00:18:00.012, Speaker C: That's funny. Not an.
00:18:00.028 - 00:18:01.996, Speaker B: Actually, it seems like. It seems like a reasonable amount.
00:18:02.100 - 00:18:03.624, Speaker A: It's an IRL game.
00:18:05.404 - 00:18:07.068, Speaker B: You ever played any tournaments?
00:18:07.236 - 00:18:08.676, Speaker A: No, no, I didn't make that far.
00:18:08.700 - 00:18:08.964, Speaker B: It was.
00:18:09.004 - 00:18:12.236, Speaker A: It was more just like with kids, uh, kids that I knew from school.
00:18:12.420 - 00:18:16.144, Speaker B: Oh, man, that's. I. I did not peg you for magic. The gag.
00:18:17.204 - 00:18:28.184, Speaker A: So is. Is that what this is, like, parallel is like a crypto, like a. Where the. The cards are nfts and you play the game and the cards, like, enable you in the same way that they would enable you in magic.
00:18:28.524 - 00:18:37.004, Speaker C: Yeah. So there's like four different. I think there's. I want to say there's four factions. Let me not mess it up. I think there's four different factions. Um, and each faction has their own, like, special abilities.
00:18:37.004 - 00:18:56.516, Speaker C: Um, your deck of cards. I want to say it's 20 cards. You get a deck of cards. Um, and then you play against somebody else. And each card has its own, like, attack, defense, whatever special, like, ability. And you try and basically just take the other person's health points down to zero before they kill you. Um, I played, like, yu gi oh.
00:18:56.516 - 00:19:10.732, Speaker C: So that's my. My comparison. I played yu gi oh when I was younger. It's my closest comparison for me. But they also have other games outside of just the trading card game. So that's the first one. And then they plan on making other games.
00:19:10.732 - 00:19:30.900, Speaker C: Also, their newest one that they're working on is like an AI first person based on the parallel avatars. And basically your AI does like, like, goes out on quests and stuff, and you like, update your character as it goes. So that's their next. Their next game coming up. It's gonna be a whole, like, franchise of things.
00:19:30.972 - 00:19:51.540, Speaker A: This is bananas. I was just, like. I just ran the numbers on Opensea after you brought it up. I mean, we're looking at $161 million worth of volume that's printed on just these trading cards since it. Since the project kicked off. Like, there's real stuff happening here kind of under our noses. And, you know, part of why we wanted to have you on so badly was because, you know, you're paying attention to it.
00:19:51.540 - 00:20:08.624, Speaker A: Like, for me, I'm just too fucking old. Avi's too busy slinging institutional volume and the tokens that can handle it. Like, we need people who are in the weeds looking at interesting stuff. Thank you for telling me about this. Try to. Try to buy some cards.
00:20:09.484 - 00:20:17.220, Speaker C: Yeah, man. So you can start playing. I can get you the betas. You can get access to the beta. The open beta comes at end of the year, but I can get you cool.
00:20:17.292 - 00:20:17.700, Speaker A: Yes, please.
00:20:17.732 - 00:20:17.828, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:17.836 - 00:20:18.700, Speaker A: I mean, the trend.
00:20:18.732 - 00:20:35.776, Speaker B: The trenches have been so profitable. I mean, not that. Not that I can. Not that I can, like, plane them in any size, because it's just. It's not. It's not really my game. But as an outside observer who pays attention to the people that pay attention to the trenches, I mean, it's kind of nuts.
00:20:35.776 - 00:20:39.324, Speaker B: Just all the on chain stuff that's been popping off left and right.
00:20:42.144 - 00:21:11.236, Speaker A: We've had some polished billionaires on the show who come from interest rate trading. We've talked to Anatoly from Solana, who was a dev and super genius. We haven't talked to any people, like, retail type people in the trenches. So how did you, like, can you tell us what it is that attracted you to crypto? And then tell us, like, how you managed to survive these cycles and develop your process without a formal trading background. How'd you do it?
00:21:11.420 - 00:21:31.554, Speaker C: So I went to Georgia Tech. I studied computer science there, and my minor was in business. So one of my classes for my minor was this emerging technologies class. And my professor was a huge bitcoin guy. He was like, I was one of the focuses in that class is bitcoin. So that's what I first learned about bitcoin. And I've always kind of been at the intersection of, like, finance and tech.
00:21:31.554 - 00:22:00.580, Speaker C: That's why I minor in business. My major was cs. So I've kind of always been, like, in that. That area. And then when I graduated in 2017, I had a mentor at the job I was working at, and he was a huge crypto guy, and he was, like, dude, I'm, like, making a ton of money trading on Bittrex, Bitmex, like, all these sites. He starts telling me about altcoins, and I was like, okay, let me look into this and figure this out and start learning how to do this. That's when I started trading 2017.
00:22:00.580 - 00:22:14.828, Speaker C: I mean, I was always. I've always been on Twitter, so, like, when I. When I was. Been on Twitter has just, like, been online. So I've been online forever. Like, I was Tumblr guy, played, like, World of Warcraft, played League of Legends, always been on. On the Internet.
00:22:14.828 - 00:22:54.676, Speaker C: So I was active on Twitter before I even knew about crypto. And when I started looking into crypto, I was like, well, let me figure out on Twitter who the crypto people are. And that's what I started figuring, like, found Kobe, found, like, trader main, like, woundart, all those guys. Um, and when I was learning how to trade 2017, I started posting charts, like, everybody else's posting charts. I didn't have any followers, but I posted a ton of charts, and I was learning ta from those guys. They're talking about, like, how cycles work, how all coins versus bitcoin work, how, like, money flows down the ecosystems and all that. I saw it in 2017, didn't trade the cycle well at all.
00:22:54.676 - 00:23:27.596, Speaker C: I was like, all in all, bitcoin was ripping. Just, like, was down a ton against bitcoin. It didn't do a great job of selling the top either, but I saw the cycle and knew what it looked like and how to play it when it came back again the second time. So in 2020, when defy summer happened, it started popping off. I was actually playing poker with a lot of crypto people and wasn't really that active in markets, but then people were like, yo, started talking about shit coins on uniswap. I was like, okay, let me figure out what this is and get back into this. That's actually my boy Jeremy.
00:23:27.596 - 00:23:41.224, Speaker C: We started. We made, like, a group chat on Telegram. That's when everybody was trading against each other, trading micro caps, and we, like, went from poker straight into, like, trading, like, uniswap. It was funny.
00:23:41.864 - 00:23:50.744, Speaker A: You didn't leave the market, right? Like, you were in it. You had your finger on the pulse the whole time. You didn't, like, take a breather in 2019 and look at other stuff, right?
00:23:50.904 - 00:24:19.852, Speaker C: No, I took a breather. I was, like, more focused on my actual day job in, like, 2019. I traded 2018 2019. Actually, my daughter was born late 2019, so that was also right around when COVID happened. So that whole time period, I was, like, not looking at markets. And then the COVID crash happened. Watching what happened was, I remember bit Lord was on Twitter talking about COVID in China, and I've been in China, and he's walking around Shanghai or wherever he was in Beijing.
00:24:19.852 - 00:24:46.624, Speaker C: Shanghai, I think was Shanghai or Beijing, and there's nobody on the streets. So I was like, that is completely wrong for China because I've been there, and I know what those streets look like. So something is up. And I started looking at markets, us markets. And in my head, I'm like, as soon as COVID gets to New York, we're like, we're fucked. Because the distance between everybody on the subway is like, we're face to face. I'm like, if it spreads that fast, people are like, it doubles every day.
00:24:46.624 - 00:25:17.080, Speaker C: I'm like, as soon as the first case gets into New York, it's like, it's raps for here. And people were not really worried about it. So I was short Boeing. I, like, bought puts on Boeing, thinking like, okay, well, whenever people do figure out this is, like, an actual thing, airlines are going to get crushed. So I was short Boeing, and I was short, like, right before that crazy crash happened in March. That printed pretty well on that. But I closed it too early.
00:25:17.080 - 00:25:31.164, Speaker C: I didn't expect it to go, like -70% a couple weeks. But, yeah, after that, I started paying attention more to market. I was okay. Everything crashed. I was playing poker with crypto people. Then people started talking about Defi summer. Everything ripped.
00:25:31.164 - 00:26:00.424, Speaker C: I look at the aavehr. I'm like, how the fuck did I miss this hundred x? And then I saw bitcoin was trading at ten k. So I'm like, well, bitcoin is 100% at least, going back to all time high. I know that for a fact. I'm trying to tell everybody, like, yo, bitcoin's gonna rip soon because all these alts have done all this, all these multiples. Bitcoin hasn't moved yet, so that money's gonna start flowing down into bitcoin. And they didn't even know bitcoin was like, dude, where's bitcoin? We know Ethereum, and we know uniswap.
00:26:00.424 - 00:26:31.124, Speaker C: We don't care about bitcoin because they were. That their intro to crypto was just trading on Uniswap. So that's how I got, like, active again that cycle. Bitcoin was, like, my first big trade, and I was like, okay, what else should I look at? Gas use fighting on Ethereum. Then I started looking at Solana. Like, that was probably my best trade that cycle, but I just had that, like, framework for how to rotate capital between bitcoin, all coins that I knew a little bit of ta. It's always been easy for me to pick up new stuff, just like.
00:26:31.124 - 00:26:33.620, Speaker C: So trading was really not. Not hard for me to pick up.
00:26:33.652 - 00:27:08.068, Speaker B: But that was one of the weirdest periods, I think, when people were getting into crypto through Uniswap and ETH, and they weren't such a. Because I remember, I mean, back in, back in 2016, 2017, everybody, everybody's first stop, bitcoin. So I was kind of used to, I was used to the opposite happening, right, where you get the wealth effect from BTC into alts. And that was sort of the mentality. And then people just started onboarding because of all these crazy, crazy yields that existed in Defi. They were like, whoa, I can make 100%. I can make 1000%.
00:27:08.068 - 00:27:33.196, Speaker B: I can just literally five x my money in a month if I go into defi first and people are just going straight to it. Eight big and, you know, small caps on unit on uniswap. So that, that was, that was a, that was a wild, that was a wild period. But it just shows you how, how much the crypto market changes, honestly. Yeah, a year, but also how much it, like, the. The say the same things will happen over again. You just have to pattern match sort of differently.
00:27:33.196 - 00:27:46.138, Speaker B: It's like when your teacher gave you a problem set and then the test was a different version of that problem set. Just have to figure out how, like, super superimpose it onto the. Onto the new problem.
00:27:46.266 - 00:28:01.042, Speaker A: Anson was saying that the money back then was in the Defi summer was trickling from alts into bitcoin. Why is it that this cycle, it should be the opposite and money will trickle from bitcoin into alts?
00:28:01.218 - 00:28:34.902, Speaker C: I mean, I don't think it was directly just like all coins into bitcoin. I think there was also a ton of tradfi flows that were like, that pushed bitcoin up that around that time period. Um, but just generally, the. The people who are really good at trading crypto cycles, their core base is always bitcoin. And some of them now it's bitcoin and eat. So it's like if you have these people, the people who are buying all coins when they're, like floored, -90% um, usually know what they're doing and they're going to protect their gains by going back into bitcoin. So whenever those people print off alts.
00:28:34.902 - 00:29:10.608, Speaker C: They're like, oh, let me take profit into bitcoin. Take profit into either. So I think you have the crypto natives who a lot of times are the same size as these funds, and they just know what they're doing. So they control a lot of how the market flows happens. That's generally why I don't think it's directly like, bitcoin alts, alts bitcoin. I think this cycle, there's a lot of, well, I don't know if this is true or not, but I think there's going to be a lot of institutional focus on bitcoin just because of how the spot ETF is coming. And, like, think his connections with people in finance are massive.
00:29:10.608 - 00:29:48.460, Speaker C: So in my head, I'm like, okay, bitcoin is going to be the first thing that all these people who are like, have gold allocations, have stock allocations, whatever, have real estate. Like, oh, let me get one, 2% of bitcoin. Let me add that to my, my portfolio now that Blackrock is stamping it as safe for people. So that's what I'm thinking there is going to happen. And then that also legitimizes the crypto space further across the board. So bitcoin is stamped, then ETH is next, and it's like, okay, what are people building in crypto that makes sense outside of traditional, like, tech and finance? And once that happens, that's when, like, the massive. Everybody's like, okay, crypto is cool.
00:29:48.460 - 00:30:11.114, Speaker C: Like, crypto is here to stay. I think this is that cycle where that happens. People argued it was, it was last cycle. I think you could, could make the argument, but just because of how new defied everything was, I think it's a lot easier to make that argument this cycle once it's been through the wringer and, like, survived. That's how I'm thinking about it.
00:30:11.234 - 00:30:20.610, Speaker A: So in your poker circles in the retail community, that you are clearly what we just look at your Twitter.
00:30:20.762 - 00:30:28.154, Speaker B: I think, like a leader in the, like, the, like, I view you as, like, the, like, the William wallets of retail.
00:30:30.334 - 00:30:32.954, Speaker C: You're like, elite Andy gin, bro.
00:30:34.094 - 00:30:41.994, Speaker A: Love your twitter. We were like, should we get a retail trader on the show? Avi was like, yes, no brainer.
00:30:44.014 - 00:30:50.004, Speaker B: I would clarify. It's like, he's not very much so not retail, but the leader of retail, the.
00:30:51.704 - 00:30:54.048, Speaker C: I try to help him out, bro. I try to help him out.
00:30:54.136 - 00:30:55.944, Speaker A: The quarterback of retail.
00:30:56.104 - 00:30:56.844, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:57.824 - 00:31:05.344, Speaker A: Do you ever wear Jalen hurt style eye paint when you, when you show up to your training, bro.
00:31:05.384 - 00:31:16.364, Speaker C: You know what I should do? I should, like, I should do streams and come out. Like, I'm like, I'm a football player. Like, full costume. I need, like, a man. Like, costume, bro. Like, stream.
00:31:17.124 - 00:31:21.784, Speaker A: Yeah, the show, actually. Solana hackathon with the super turbo.
00:31:24.364 - 00:31:26.692, Speaker C: Warlord gear. No, I need that. That's it.
00:31:26.828 - 00:31:31.104, Speaker A: Amongst the circles that you lead. Sorry, not run in that you lead.
00:31:32.244 - 00:31:32.860, Speaker C: What's the mood?
00:31:32.892 - 00:31:46.004, Speaker A: Like? Can you give us a sense of what just people who are passionate about crypto and this market and this technology, what they're saying after they've just been beaten up throughout 2022?
00:31:46.744 - 00:32:28.094, Speaker C: Well, I think there's. There's two outsiders, two main groups. You have the developers and the builders. I'm closest with the Solana, like, Solana community of builders. Not as much with the ETH guys, but know some of them, too. And during, even when I was at breakpoint in 2022, they're super excited about the future of crypto and everything that they're building from, like, defi stuff, consumer stuff, like decentralized physical infrastructure stuff, everything across the board. They're just super excited about the future and what they're building and that energy that I felt there and breakpoint made it a lot easier to be bullish on Salada this year.
00:32:28.094 - 00:32:52.754, Speaker C: Even when the entire time I was like, dude, you're a fucking idiot. What are you talking about? I'm like, I've talked to these people. I understand this tech, like, the advantages it has versus ETH and other, other chains. This thing is going to turn around eventually. So that was like an easy. It made that easier for me to make that bet, having those relationships with them and talking to them. And then on the other side, it's like the retail degenerates.
00:32:52.754 - 00:33:29.472, Speaker C: It's like everybody is trying 100 x, whatever they have. Whatever, like, spare funds that they have. It's like that everybody's shy 100 x. You have, like, right now. I've talked about it a little bit on Twitter, but you have a ton of people who are working their day job, but they're not making enough, like, substantially to be able to afford, like, a really nice house or anything. Like, in a short amount of time, they're going to be working. They know if they, like, calculate how much I'm saving year over year, I'm probably going to be working whatever for a long ass time.
00:33:29.472 - 00:33:53.048, Speaker C: They see crypto and they're like, okay, I can shave a few years off the back of that by making some extra money in markets and so everybody's like, z answer, what should I buy? What should I buy? Like, what are we looking at this cycle? Like, how do I. Whatever. Ten x. So I get a ton of questions like that. It's just like the energy of people in markets. They see kind of a way to get some extra cash, honestly. And, like, a lot of people were.
00:33:53.048 - 00:34:05.480, Speaker C: Retail trading side of crypto is focused on that. And then you have the builders who are more focused on, dude, no, we're building real things here for the future of finance, future of tech. It's a dichotomy there.
00:34:05.592 - 00:34:43.536, Speaker A: It's nice to hear it from you. I mean, we've had this thesis sitting in our financialized ivory tower here, Abhi and I have, about why it is that there is an interesting casino type element to crypto. But you bring up a really good point. Just life in America and in many, many other places has kind of gotten ways away from, you know, normal people. And that's not fair, right? So you have to invest well in order to achieve financial outcomes that are, you know, used to be part of the, like, standard package that you get. Just work in a government job. Like, my mom worked for the postal service and bought a house in the hills in California.
00:34:43.536 - 00:35:03.458, Speaker A: Like, on a government. That's not happening anymore. So, you know. So in terms of crypto, like, I see the appeal, and it is cool that people can get out there and actually trade some tech that has a future, but obviously, there's a lot of risk involved. So, yeah, it's tough to navigate, isn't it?
00:35:03.626 - 00:35:36.684, Speaker C: I see a lot of comparisons. Well, I wasn't around in early two thousands, but from looking at it, it seems similar to me that.com era where a ton of companies popped out and they were the giants of this, these past two decades. But there also were a ton of companies that went to zero. It's like all the altcoins that we've had since 20, 2013. If you look at the fucking. The top 100 in 2013, like, 90 of those coins are not even around now you go to 2015, you do it again, it's like most of them are not even around to go to 2017.
00:35:36.684 - 00:36:03.398, Speaker C: You do it again, it's like some of them are still here. But that's like the risk of, like you said, trading crypto. It's like some of this stuff is going to fail. I don't think that's necessarily bad, but it's also why when you are right on certain things is where you can hit 100 x because the market is still small. Enough that these big guys can't just shove size into it. So you're front running all those guys. That's the way I look at it.
00:36:03.398 - 00:36:07.374, Speaker C: It's similar to that.com era, this crypto explosion.
00:36:07.454 - 00:36:26.380, Speaker B: And that's, I think, why you see so much community in crypto. Anybody that knows crypto, like, seriously knows that you have to pay attention to make money. Like, it's actually. It's actually kind of tough. Especially if you're playing the gambling game, right? If you're playing the small cap game, you know that you have to look at that position every, you know, like, every week at least.
00:36:26.572 - 00:36:28.572, Speaker C: Yeah, dude. Yeah.
00:36:28.588 - 00:36:31.904, Speaker B: If you're playing on chain, you just have to be looking at it. You can't just not.
00:36:32.204 - 00:36:32.540, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:32.572 - 00:36:35.864, Speaker B: Because for at any moment, the founders are going to mint, you know?
00:36:36.364 - 00:36:37.104, Speaker C: Right.
00:36:39.444 - 00:36:40.738, Speaker B: You're just out of luck.
00:36:40.916 - 00:36:56.766, Speaker C: Yeah, you're right, dude. It's like, if you. You just look at the. Look at theorem and how many, like, how strong that community is. That's a fucking cult community of ETH people. They've been holding e for years. They just never sell it.
00:36:56.766 - 00:37:19.168, Speaker C: Like, literally just, like, hold a fuck ton of their net worth in ethereum. And that's why you see these shit coins pop up. Like, who are. Who are these guys throwing, like, 200 fucking five mil, ten mil market cap points, because people are literally storing all their wealth, like, one chain. So you have a ton of people like that. It's just like, that's how the, like.
00:37:19.256 - 00:37:46.424, Speaker B: That'S like, I got to ask a question about that because this is a game that I used to play and I used to be in on in 2020, I was big on the on. Like, I was flipping stuff, like, based yams, all this random stuff into 2020. I actually have no idea what's going on on chain right now. Like, I don't know how people are. How people are finding these small caps. Like, I only see them when they're, like 15 to 20 mil at this point. But sometimes I see posting and chats are buying, like, 500 cake.
00:37:46.424 - 00:37:50.384, Speaker B: How are you fought? Like, do you play this and how do you find these things?
00:37:51.204 - 00:38:12.246, Speaker C: I played a little bit. I'm honestly, like, I always say I'm second. Like, I'll see. I'm in so many chats, dude. Like, people are literally sending me stuff launches at. I'm like, how are you even, like, they track a lot of the new launches, and they have lists of, like, deployers that they know are good. Some deployers are bad, and they've run, like, the rug check on all this stuff.
00:38:12.246 - 00:38:37.864, Speaker C: Like, oh, this, this is safe. Lick is locked. Who, who launched this? Like, what's, what's the guy behind this? They play a lot of the games. I know a lot of people that do that. So I'm there watching it. What I'm usually at is like, once something is kind of like a little bit of exit velocity, that's when I start paying attention to stuff. I'm like, okay, let me figure out in the five mil to ten mil, what, has it gone to zero yet? New launch is there.
00:38:37.864 - 00:39:04.508, Speaker C: That's kind of, that's how I found unibot early this year. I didn't, I missed it. I was like, people bought it at like thirty k, forty k, fifty k market cap. I don't know how in all these chats, but they saw it, it was like, oh, Telegram bought for trading shit coins. I'm like, tell it where box trading shit goes. That makes a fuck ton of sense. I'm watching you guys do this every day and I know people are using maestro which didn't have a coin associated.
00:39:04.508 - 00:39:38.754, Speaker C: I'm like, oh, this is maestro with a coin. It's one of the easiest thesis I've seen. And I was just looking at the metrics on it and saw how much money they were making off fees and user activity was starting to turn up being consistent. I think I bought it around, I think I bought it around five mil the first time and then I like started talking about it more like around 2020 mil or something like that. And then told people about it closer, like 30, 40 or somewhere around there. But I was like, yeah, this makes sense. And this is not like this is something that will, if they do well, it won't go to zero.
00:39:38.754 - 00:40:25.504, Speaker C: So there's like a few things that pop up like that. The new kind of like free launches. And it's cool because then VC's will pick it up like they got, they ended up getting VC investment once they like showed their, their market fit and that was a whole, I like turned into a whole section on like Coingecko. There was like other people launching, trading like telegram, buy coins. All these devs hopped on like, oh, this is the new meta. It's kind of cool how that stuff, literally these metas, like, they come to fruition in the trenches and then it's like then they hit the timeline and then the VC guys get it and it's like now to think. But a lot of that stuff happens in like with these dj's on chain that's kind of how defy summer happened to, like, everybody's like, yield farming, then it turned into a real thing.
00:40:25.504 - 00:40:41.188, Speaker C: But as obvious that is because people are storing their money in these coins, and, like, they're. They're really bought into the future of finance being in crypto. So it's like you have people ready to test out all these things, and if you didn't have them, then none of the stuff will be around.
00:40:41.296 - 00:41:29.204, Speaker A: Okay, follow up question. So people, we know that people store their wealth in ETH, and then when they feel rich in ETH, they start lifting crypto punks and ERC 20 tokens. Yeah, I guess maybe this is kind of an interesting trade idea that we could chop through here on the podcast. Solana. If it is a token of this next cycle and people are storing their wealth in it, which I think, based on what I've seen on Twitter, it sounds like people are indeed storing a significant percentage of their wealth in Solana. If Solana starts to roof more, or even the roofing that it's done so far, what sort of trickle down effects are we going to get? What are some interesting projects on Solana or NFT things that you think will get picked up by the new Solana rich people?
00:41:29.904 - 00:41:47.078, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's going to happen in the same way. Dude, I've been saying for a while, people wrote off Solana Alts because last cycle they were basically all scams. Like, literally, it was like, oxy maps. What are some of the other ones? There's a few other ones that were just really, really bad.
00:41:47.206 - 00:42:06.274, Speaker B: Oxym apps are wild to me, actually. One thing that people aren't paying attention to. This is a complete total tangent. Then I want to get back to the point, but Oxy and maps actually make up something like 800 million of the claims on FTX. There's a massive oxy maps position. Those tokens are basic. They're worth zero.
00:42:06.354 - 00:42:07.226, Speaker C: They're zero. Yeah.
00:42:07.290 - 00:42:30.834, Speaker B: And so the whole. The hole is actually smaller than people expect because of that. It's this massive, just, like, fake amount of money that people are ascribing to the hole. But it was, like, crazy. I remember when Oxy raised, they were like, raising a 400 million back in, I think, 2021, maybe it was end of 2020. And the current consensus at the time was just like, yeah, I mean, eight bit. Because it's.
00:42:30.834 - 00:42:38.706, Speaker B: Because it's on Solana, but I mean, it's probably not going to ever. Not not gonna knock an ever amount too much. I mean, what, like, what's out there that's better now then?
00:42:38.810 - 00:43:10.278, Speaker C: Yeah. So see, I think, I think you're gonna see that wealth effect happen. Like, if Solana gets repriced up like over a hundred and has like that second cycle that at the, you had its second time where it rips. You're gonna have these teams on Solana when they launch tokens, people are gonna be ap them, same way they're gonna be aping nfts on salad where some of the good teams, I think there are a few really strong teams. The Jito guys, I like a lot. So Jito labs is like a mev mev team. They also run validators.
00:43:10.278 - 00:43:34.234, Speaker C: So they also have a liquid staking version of Solana, which is like gto soul. So they're a combination of like flashbots and lido on ETH, but they're on Solana. They don't have a token yet. They're doing like a points program right now. But if they do launch a token, I think that'll probably be one of the strongest ones on Solana. So I'm then margin fi. They're similar to Abe.
00:43:34.234 - 00:44:15.184, Speaker C: They're like a lending borrowing protocol. They're doing some pretty cool stuff. One of the issues last cycle happened with the risk limits on, I think it was, I want to say it was Solen. I don't want to throw them under the bus. But there was like a huge position on, like one of the big lending borrowing protocols on Solana, and the risk parameters were just not great. So it was like, how did somebody build this position? And it ended up fucking up a lot of Solana Defi when unwinded. So margin, five guys have been really, really hip, hammering the nail on being safe with how they operate, how they scale up, how they are building from ground up.
00:44:15.184 - 00:44:23.008, Speaker C: I like them a lot. Marginfire, they're like Aave Solana. What other teams are good? Oh, like Jupiter.
00:44:23.056 - 00:44:24.944, Speaker A: Jupiter against a lot of good reviews.
00:44:25.024 - 00:44:47.080, Speaker C: That was the one. Yeah. Jupiter is going to be a beast. I think they're like an aggregator, kind of similar to one inch, but literally everybody on salon is trading, trading through Jupiter. And the experience, like, when everybody starts using, like, dude, it's so much faster. It's so, it's so easy. It's so, like, fluid to use compared to these dexes on Ethan.
00:44:47.080 - 00:44:52.176, Speaker C: That's just because of, like, the underlying Solana, like, the tech infrastructure.
00:44:52.240 - 00:45:18.950, Speaker A: I used mango back in the day before Solana souped itself up. And I thought it was slick looking and cool, but at the end of the day, you need real use cases on these chains in order for a Dex aggregator to be relevant. And so what do you think? Are there any exciting games on Solana? What are the big applications that are going to bring in people over from web two? They're going to hit Solana, or do you think we're not there yet in the cycle?
00:45:19.142 - 00:46:16.374, Speaker C: No, I think we're there. Which games? Aria is probably the biggest game right now on Solana, but there's a lot of new ones that I think we'll see coming out, like, more recent this year. I think what I'm really trying to figure out for Solana, what I think is going to be the best play, is figuring out, which depends Solana are on going to work. Like, if I can hit those really well, that's one application that is, like, very, very well suited to only be able to do on Solana versus, like, ether, other chains because of how much more efficient it is, how much you can do. Yeah, it's like if you're going to scale something globally, you need to be doing it, like, on soul. So stuff like helium, like Hivemapper, that render is big already. They're like over a billion.
00:46:16.374 - 00:46:31.282, Speaker C: But applications like those, that are only possible in Solana apps, I think those are going to be the best place. I just got to figure out which ones I want to hit. Obviously don't have a good list for that yet, but tokens wise, so much.
00:46:31.298 - 00:46:36.256, Speaker B: Of crypto is just trying to predict what people are going to do next. So it's like where, where, where have you.
00:46:36.280 - 00:46:37.016, Speaker C: Where people. Right?
00:46:37.040 - 00:47:01.762, Speaker B: So for example, like two months, three months, five months ago, six months ago, whatever. So you can sit, there you go. I know at some point in the future, I'm 100% confident at some point in the future that AI will be talked about by everybody. And therefore you just want to put AI coins. I don't, and I don't know how, like, I don't know what the catalyst is. I just know that at some point people are talking about this, so I'm going to buy it.
00:47:01.778 - 00:47:02.842, Speaker C: Yeah. Right.
00:47:02.938 - 00:47:24.610, Speaker B: That's sometimes when. When prices are. When prices are low, when you've, you know, I think anytime bitcoin's below, you know, 70% of its all time highs, that's like kind of your mentality when you, when you approach the market is, I'm just going to buy certain things because I know at some point people are going to talk about them, whether it's like a real bull market or a fake bull market or an echo bubble or, like, I don't care.
00:47:24.642 - 00:47:25.066, Speaker C: Yep.
00:47:25.170 - 00:47:25.458, Speaker B: I know.
00:47:25.466 - 00:47:45.710, Speaker C: It's good. It's like front running. It's front running. The attention, dude, that's literally attention. It's like, those are why, like, the euphoria peaks happen. Euphoria peaks happen when they're like, you've no, like, there's no other attention left to be spit on this thing. Like, if everybody's talking about this thing, everybody's all in.
00:47:45.710 - 00:48:03.662, Speaker C: There's nobody left to buy. That's when euphoria is like, these peaks happen. If you front run that, that's how you make a lot of money in crypto. But I think what's, what's interesting from the culture side is, like, nfTs. So you have crypto punks on ETH, actually. What are, what are they at right now?
00:48:03.838 - 00:48:06.174, Speaker A: 60 ETH floor, something like that.
00:48:06.334 - 00:48:09.326, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. So they're still like over 100k, but.
00:48:09.350 - 00:48:14.766, Speaker A: I think they went as low as 40. They're up 50% off the lows.
00:48:14.950 - 00:48:17.114, Speaker B: I see 55.3.
00:48:17.634 - 00:48:42.858, Speaker C: Pretty good. Yeah. Good. I think a good bet to make if you're betting on the future of crypto, if you think salad is going to be like, that third chain to ETH is trying to figure out what the crypto punks equipment is going to be. So I've been trying to think through that also. I think mad lads are, like, possibly a good candidate there because the team is doing a lot of different things for the solid ecosystem. Like, they have the wallet, backpack wallet.
00:48:42.858 - 00:48:59.956, Speaker C: Then they're also building the exchange, and they also have the X NFT infrastructure, which is like executable NFTs that kind of have all these other different features that you can do with them. And madlad is like, they're basically their NFT, but I don't know if they're going to be the one or another one.
00:48:59.980 - 00:49:35.000, Speaker A: But one thing I like about the way that your thought process has been explained over the course of the podcast here is that you don't get too married to stuff. And when shit's about to fall out of bed, like in COVID, you didn't look to crypto to save you. You went and bought some Boeing puts, right. So maybe can you talk a little bit? It's exciting to be like, hey, I think this is going to ten x. This is going 100 x, or this crazy ass project. No inherent value is about to go into hype mode. You can see these casino style tulip tulip price bubbles occurring before they do.
00:49:35.000 - 00:49:40.426, Speaker A: But how do you risk manage stuff? How do you know when you're in peak euphoria and it's time to unload.
00:49:40.520 - 00:50:18.294, Speaker C: I don't have rules around how, like, big portions of my portfolio. Honestly, I trade more off the individual, individual chart, individual coins. Like, I did pretty well with Pepe earlier this year was probably my best trade this year, but I saw it. It was one of those situations where everybody was piling in short, and you're piling in short on a meme that has no inherent value. It's only people buying and selling. It's literally just retail versus all the other traders in the market. So you have all these traders going short, and it got listed on what I think was by bit or wherever it was.
00:50:18.294 - 00:50:33.042, Speaker C: I was like, oh, this is definitely going to squeeze. I already had, like, I was lucky enough to buy it early, like, bought it on chain, and it was like, pop. A popular meme in crypto. The fucking frog is everywhere. I'm okay. This makes sense to capture some attention in crypto. Then it got listed.
00:50:33.042 - 00:51:09.914, Speaker C: Everybody's shorting it. I'm like, dude, they're going to get steamrolled trying to go against this thing. But the way I look, for tops, ta wise, I think volume is actually really, really good. When the volume spikes are like two, three x the previous dailies, and they're larger than the, like, total market cap of the coin, you're usually pretty close to a top, like on shit on sheep. Like when ship top, it was doing something crazy, like multiple billions of dollars. When Pepe top this year, when it got listed on binance, I think the volume that day was like 2.4 billion.
00:51:09.914 - 00:51:16.438, Speaker C: Meme was at a bike. It was. It topped like 1 billion or 1.6.
00:51:16.486 - 00:51:23.214, Speaker A: And you're looking at it. You're looking at Pepe versus USDT, right? You're not looking at, like, pair. Pair charts for the volumes.
00:51:23.254 - 00:51:23.758, Speaker C: You're looking.
00:51:23.846 - 00:51:25.262, Speaker A: You're looking at the straight up.
00:51:25.398 - 00:51:47.980, Speaker C: Yeah, USD. I mean, I was, I was like, I was. Had a position on chain and I had it along on this shady ass exchange, like, the only way I could get long on it. And I was, like, closing both at the same time. But yeah, I was really on, like, the low timeframe, like five minute chart, just. Just trading off ta. But yeah, it's like those volume spikes are usually pretty, pretty good indicators.
00:51:47.980 - 00:51:56.864, Speaker C: Trying to think of what else. I don't know. It's really off, ta. Just like once shit starts going parabolic, like, they know it's gonna top out, top out soon, shit's doubling, like every other day.
00:51:57.764 - 00:52:25.128, Speaker A: That's the hardest part, but also the most lucrative part, is just staying sober about this stuff. When you look at your Coinbase account or your wallet, your on chain wallet, your metamask, whatever, and it's just exploded. It's easy to be like, all right, cool, I'm good. Now we're three xing from here. It's very hard to stay calm and think, like, all right, what's an objective framework that I can ingest now that will help me lock this in and not get too greedy?
00:52:25.316 - 00:52:39.404, Speaker B: Jonah, one rule that's been really helpful is actually to track emotional response to things. So if I ever find myself, if I've refreshed my portfolio five times that day, I got to think about selling.
00:52:40.024 - 00:52:46.920, Speaker C: Yeah, what's that like, what's up in my boys? Like, a screenshot of my. You feel like, let me. Let me take some off.
00:52:46.952 - 00:53:05.256, Speaker B: It's like, without fail, I'm like. I'm like, on my. I'm on my exchange. I'm like, oh, what are we at now? How much money did I make today? Yeah, you know, I'm serious. But, like, it's because I think you, like, people are a lot more similar than we give them credit for. And so it's all the most. A lot of other people are doing that as well.
00:53:05.256 - 00:53:10.608, Speaker B: And then at some point, people start to wait. They're like, okay, wait a second. Just not like, this is a lot.
00:53:10.696 - 00:53:11.168, Speaker C: I gotta.
00:53:11.216 - 00:53:12.524, Speaker B: I gotta start getting out.
00:53:12.984 - 00:53:44.000, Speaker C: I've been saying this year, like, a good, um, portfolio allocation to have. So separate your core portfolio from your degen portfolio. Do, like, I'll say, like, 70%. Like, 70%. Uh, whatever bitcoin eats a lot of whatever your highest conviction alts are, put that in that bucket. Don't really try and trade that all that much. Then you, the other 30%, do whatever it is on chain, whatever on perps, on, like, yield farming, some random new launches.
00:53:44.000 - 00:54:15.090, Speaker C: Do that with the smaller portion of your portion of your portfolio, and then, like, redistribute that to your higher conviction bags. Because I think the way you make the most money in crypto is you stay in the trenches and you're most active with all the new rotations that are happening, but you also have your core portfolio that. So you. When crypto is like, as crypto is going. Going back up, you have that. You're already long. Like, you're consistently long.
00:54:15.090 - 00:54:30.494, Speaker C: So even if you get messed up trying to trade whatever low timeframe stuff or, like, you're wrong on some rotation, you buy some altcoin and it goes down like 50% overnight because whatever, some random shit happened on chain, you still have your core portfolio. You're not, like, messed up on.
00:54:31.234 - 00:54:58.374, Speaker A: Yeah, trade with the cool head. That's really interesting. I think the million dollar question here is, are you in your core portfolio for another sort of picotop parabolic event, or do you believe, like, are you here because you think that you're preempting another giant bubble? Or do you believe that we're in this, like, 20 year mega trend where crypto slowly starts to eat value transfer as software is eating the world in other areas?
00:54:59.034 - 00:55:57.762, Speaker C: I think because of how small crypto is now, even if we assume on a longer timeframe that we're in a slow uptrend, the repricing is going to happen quickly right now because of how small stuff is. Like, it's going to be a parabolic bubble just because of how tidy the market is and how, how, like, how easy it is for people to get access to it. So I'm still trading it in that way. I still think you're going to have a cycle top, and then stuff's going to go down, like 70% or so after, after that top happens. But I do think if we get to, like I've been saying, like 6 trillion, if we get over, like 6 trillion as a top for whatever this cycle, and then we stay in multi trillion, like, total market cap as all of crypto, I think you're going to see the volatility dip in just because we're going to be a bigger market. And I think this is one of the last ones where we're still tidy. The Berniske has been saying 10 trillion.
00:55:57.762 - 00:56:01.834, Speaker C: I'm like, dude, if we get 10 trillion, well, there's your.
00:56:01.994 - 00:56:27.274, Speaker B: I don't think it's none of the realm of possibility. I mean, the next, the next bubble is going to. The thing is that people have now missed two cycles. If they haven't gotten a crypto, then there are, there are a lot of people with a lot of money that if this thing starts ripping again, there's. There's going to be a tremendous amount of fomo. But it remains to be seen when that top is. I feel like a good way to.
00:56:27.274 - 00:56:34.114, Speaker B: We get. We can, we can send this off. Everybody goes around and gives the exact date of the next top.
00:56:35.014 - 00:56:37.674, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm down.
00:56:38.814 - 00:56:47.594, Speaker B: All right, I'll go. I'll go first. I think the exact top is going to be January 21, 2025.
00:56:51.794 - 00:56:57.930, Speaker C: I'm going to say March 27, 2025.
00:56:58.122 - 00:57:13.838, Speaker A: All right, I'm going to go a year later than you guys. I think it's coming in 26, let's say. I think it's March 2. So March 15, 2026. Odds of March. You heard it here first. And the reason why is by then the.
00:57:13.838 - 00:57:32.774, Speaker A: The United States government has just thrown in the fucking towel on even pretending that they've got an inflation anchor and some way to pay back the debt. They're just gonna start printing their way out of this. If there's one thing crypto does right for your portfolio, it's that scenario, dude, that's.
00:57:32.814 - 00:57:36.670, Speaker B: You're literally giving us two full years of bull market. I don't know if my body can handle that.
00:57:36.702 - 00:57:42.774, Speaker C: Yeah, I can't. I was about to say I can't. Like, I got actually three years of. Oh, bro, I remember, I remember.
00:57:43.154 - 00:57:48.266, Speaker A: Or the bull market just starts later. A year of another year of hell. And then in the off only.
00:57:48.370 - 00:57:48.722, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:57:48.738 - 00:58:08.610, Speaker A: I honestly like you guys are. You guys have been in crypto way longer than me. So you probably have this. This, like, perception of crypto being this thing that just ramps or dies or chops around violently and murders people. But, like, I don't know, having traded, like, pretty big asset classes, like, things don't always work like that. Like, you can have.
00:58:08.642 - 00:58:08.882, Speaker C: Period.
00:58:08.938 - 00:58:25.586, Speaker A: You can have, like. Like, fucking crude oil from 2020 to 2022. Just ground up from negative thirty seven dollars to one hundred and twenty dollars a barrel. Like, in a straight line. That can happen. We might be in the middle of one of these long ass grinds and who knows?
00:58:25.730 - 00:58:34.970, Speaker C: So that would be so frightening. If bitcoin just steadily goes up to, like, 250k. Can you imagine how many alt seasons we would have?
00:58:35.162 - 00:58:36.666, Speaker B: Dude, they'll be showing.
00:58:36.810 - 00:58:45.790, Speaker C: My God. No, I would print, bro, that would be crazy. At new rotation every three months. And big one just keeps going up. No, that's. That's not even.
00:58:45.942 - 00:59:02.022, Speaker B: That's what I actually think. I actually think people would lose their minds. That would be Max. That would be max pain. Because every three weeks, people would be calling top selling everything and then lose all their money. Like, every. Everybody would be so down in terms of bitcoin.
00:59:02.078 - 00:59:06.114, Speaker A: Well, if that's what. If that's Max Payne, then that's what's going to happen.
00:59:07.214 - 00:59:25.486, Speaker C: Yeah. Like, even people are doing it now. Like, the bitcoin chart is just like, the daily is just up, but it's not like ripping up. It's just like, higher low, higher low, higher low, higher low, higher level, higher low. And everybody's like, shaking, like, panicking, like, what's. Wow, why is it. Why isn't I responding to stuff like, going up?
00:59:25.550 - 00:59:44.718, Speaker A: Bitcoin adds the product market fit. Bitcoin is real. Like, every day more money goes into that thing. And the ETF is about to debottleneck some of those pipelines of money. I think you see sovereigns ape in, like, El Salvador, Central African Republic. Just keeps happening. And then that, that's a real use case.
00:59:44.718 - 01:00:06.720, Speaker A: ETH has real use cases. Solana will probably, you know, I wasn't, I wasn't really a believer in Solana until I got talked out of my stupor. And now it does seem like l, one will probably, will probably start chewing up some, some cool games and d pad and all that stuff. And who knows? Maybe we end up with this just sort of vortex of inflows.
01:00:06.792 - 01:00:09.936, Speaker C: 2026. 2026 would be crazy.
01:00:10.040 - 01:00:16.804, Speaker B: I'm all for linear, linear growth for the next three years. Jonah, Jonah, Jonah. Now.
01:00:17.224 - 01:00:18.584, Speaker C: Yeah, I didn't call that.
01:00:18.624 - 01:00:25.952, Speaker A: I said the top is in. Then maybe we have a nasty path to that point. But I think we get, I think we get a steady grind.
01:00:26.008 - 01:00:26.368, Speaker C: I do.
01:00:26.416 - 01:00:27.280, Speaker A: I believe it.
01:00:27.432 - 01:00:55.574, Speaker C: The reason I think, like, the reason crypto goes parabolic in the way that it does is because this market is full of degenerates, dude. Like, the people who trade these markets are willing to all in their net worth on these coins. That's why you have these parabolas. Because he's like, I feel like in other markets, I don't know if this is true or not, but I feel like in other markets, you don't have people yoloing, like, a very, very large percent of their net worth into, like, random. Maybe you do. Maybe retail is starting to do that now.
01:00:55.744 - 01:00:59.706, Speaker B: Just Tesla, GMe back in the day.
01:00:59.890 - 01:01:00.666, Speaker C: Right.
01:01:00.850 - 01:01:06.666, Speaker B: But as an asset class, for sure. I mean, I don't know. Jonah, he's just all inning their net worth into oil at any given moment.
01:01:06.730 - 01:01:36.410, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I mean, like, the market for NASA or gasoline is just not something that your average retail person can trade or would care to trade. Meanwhile, crypto, like, all my trad five friends keep telling me, like, crypt, they're mostly no coiners. They're like, oh, crypto is going to die after it saps all the money out of everybody's pockets. And it's like, you mean the entire world and their desire to gamble on a technological future? Like, I know, sorry. No, it's not going to happen. And if it does, like, probably buy.
01:01:36.442 - 01:01:37.214, Speaker B: Bitcoin.
01:01:39.514 - 01:01:58.808, Speaker A: That dystopian future is probably bullish bitcoin, but I don't want to ramble here. This is about you. Anselm, kind of want to ask you maybe for the screenshot of this podcast. Can you just move your head to be in the image underneath the crown behind you, the Basquiat crown, so we can get, like, a snapshot of you as the king?
01:01:58.936 - 01:01:59.568, Speaker C: This way.
01:01:59.656 - 01:02:00.936, Speaker B: Yeah, there we go.
01:02:01.000 - 01:02:04.664, Speaker A: All right, that's it. Boom. Okay, we're good.
01:02:04.744 - 01:02:30.004, Speaker C: Let me clarify. I've said people are like, all in, don't all in, don't all in one. Please do not do that. That's why I said have your core, your core positions and have your djinn. But, yeah, all inning stuff. Like, I know people who have done it and, like, spun up, whatever, 100 x, 200 x. But when you don't have risk parameters like that and you continue to trade, like, oh, I'm all in this, I'm all in this, I'm all in this somewhere.
01:02:30.004 - 01:02:53.106, Speaker C: Like, somewhere along that, that pathing is gonna wreck you eventually. It's gonna wreck you. And the thing is with crypto is like, these markets are up only four months at a time sometimes. And when you're long into those up, only your confidence only continuously goes up. It's like, oh, I'm a genius. I'm super smart. I made this much money in two months.
01:02:53.106 - 01:03:38.232, Speaker C: I've never made this much money in my life. I'm a genius. And that confidence will trick you into making trades with no considerations of risk at all. So that tricks a lot of people towards the end of bull markets is like, I made this much, I all in this, and I all in this, and I all in this. And then it's like you trip yourself up somewhere because you forgot at the beginning, you said I was going to, like, take profit back into this, I was going to sell at these levels, I was going to tp at this time. And you just forget and convect yourself up. So that's why I say, like, journal a ton when you're trading, because it's very easy to get lost on a daily basis of what you're thinking was a few weeks prior or a few months prior.
01:03:38.232 - 01:03:59.694, Speaker C: But if you journal, just open your book, turn a couple pages back, oh, on March and what, November 21, I said this. I said I was going to sell when it's five x. Why am I not trying to sell that now? And at five x, like, what happened between that period and now? Like, why is my mindset different? And it's usually because you're wrapped up in the market.
01:04:01.034 - 01:04:15.570, Speaker A: This is why you're good. You have discipline. Discipline is the number one characteristic of traders who make money consistently over time. And then I would say characteristic number two is people who can manage their emotions properly. Um, but discipline, definitely number one. Journaling. Great point.
01:04:15.570 - 01:04:19.454, Speaker A: Great way to maintain discipline. Even the craziness, dipto.
01:04:20.274 - 01:04:20.850, Speaker B: And it helps.
01:04:20.882 - 01:04:21.210, Speaker C: It helps.
01:04:21.242 - 01:04:31.654, Speaker B: It helps with both, you know, discipline and emotional management, for sure. Because I've always found the half of emotional management is just reminding yourself that you're feeling something at any given moment.
01:04:31.994 - 01:04:32.774, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:04:33.274 - 01:04:39.564, Speaker B: When you're in. When you're in the moment and things seem very easy, it's just having that reminder to stop and think and that.
01:04:39.604 - 01:04:41.104, Speaker A: That's half the battle right there.
01:04:41.404 - 01:04:43.100, Speaker B: It's just stopping and thinking.
01:04:43.292 - 01:04:46.524, Speaker C: Yep. So, not for sure. No. Solid.
01:04:46.564 - 01:04:51.564, Speaker B: Maybe we should get a. Maybe we should get a reunion of the. What was the other part? The untitled Crypto podcast.
01:04:51.604 - 01:04:57.692, Speaker C: Together we get, yo, yeah, we do need Kobe back.
01:04:57.828 - 01:05:01.384, Speaker B: Yeah, dude, where is we? Like, wrote us off in a van somewhere.
01:05:02.244 - 01:05:09.664, Speaker C: He's probably, like, traveling the world, dude. I have no idea. He said he was like, crypto Twitter is too negative. I'm going to do fun things. I'm sure that's what he's doing.
01:05:10.284 - 01:05:13.504, Speaker A: He's still on crypto Twitter. Probably checking it every day.
01:05:14.044 - 01:05:16.476, Speaker B: Dude, honestly, I don't know how you do it.
01:05:16.500 - 01:05:17.204, Speaker C: I get, I get.
01:05:17.244 - 01:05:23.100, Speaker B: I gave up on crypto Twitter, like, a year ago at this point, dude, it's.
01:05:23.132 - 01:05:36.574, Speaker C: Honestly, it's pretty bad. This year has been pretty bad. Like, the amount of negativity just online this year has been nuts. Um, and I get. I get both sides of it because I get people dm me all the time. Like, bro, don't pay attention to those guys. Like, you've helped me do this, this, and this.
01:05:36.574 - 01:05:57.970, Speaker C: Like, you made me this much or whatever. Like, you helped me think through this. Um, but, yeah, the timeline is just hella aggressive when you have a lot of followers on Twitter. Um, this, it is a. It's a different, different experience. It's funny because, like, I tweet the same way I did when I had a thousand followers. Like, I literally tweet.
01:05:57.970 - 01:06:19.906, Speaker C: I still. I go out and I tweet, like, oh, z's junk again. I was doing that when I had no followers on Twitter. My boy, my boys would be like, yo, dude, are you good? Like, what's up? And I tweet about crypto. So, like, oh, z's tweet about crypto shit. Now but yeah, dude, it's like when you have a hundred k followers, somebody's like, I don't know as out as it out for you. For some reason, nobody cares.
01:06:19.906 - 01:06:21.966, Speaker C: In your italian account, there's somebody that's.
01:06:21.990 - 01:06:27.278, Speaker B: Always gonna get mad at you no matter what you. Yeah, like some numbers, we will take it the wrong way.
01:06:27.446 - 01:06:48.256, Speaker C: It's a numbers game. Honestly, that's how I think about it. It's a numbers game. Like, if you, if you, like, tell some, you tell five people something, by a low chance that one of those people gonna get angry at you. You tell a hundred thousand people something, it's a pretty high possibility somebody's gonna have a problem with what you said, especially if it's not like consensus. Everybody thinks I just don't put your.
01:06:48.280 - 01:06:50.284, Speaker A: Address on your Twitter profile and you're good.
01:06:51.264 - 01:06:57.640, Speaker C: Facts. The thing is, people recognize me now. I walk outside, they're like, yo, ansem, are you serious? What the fuck?
01:06:57.712 - 01:06:58.288, Speaker A: Whoa.
01:06:58.416 - 01:07:02.064, Speaker C: No, seriously, New York, do they call.
01:07:02.104 - 01:07:04.368, Speaker A: You, is it like, hey, you're the godfather.
01:07:04.536 - 01:07:05.056, Speaker C: What's up?
01:07:05.080 - 01:07:11.656, Speaker A: What's up, king? Or is it. Or is it more like, hey, what's, what's Shiba Obama shitcoin gonna do this week?
01:07:11.720 - 01:07:32.062, Speaker C: So the dude, the first thing, what they usually do is they pull up my profile picture and they come out to me and they show it to me like, yo, are you doing from Twitter? I'm like, yes, yes, me. And then they just like, start talking to me. And then of course at the end they're like, okay, what's next? Coin I should buy? What should you buy next?
01:07:32.118 - 01:07:33.034, Speaker B: Without fail.
01:07:33.654 - 01:07:40.158, Speaker C: Without fail. But yes, it's been happening pretty consistently lately, like just in random spots in New York.
01:07:40.246 - 01:07:43.888, Speaker B: I think people in finance, gatekeep trading.
01:07:43.976 - 01:07:45.080, Speaker A: A lot like this.
01:07:45.112 - 01:07:55.720, Speaker B: Oh, you have to, like, the only, only successful trader, you have to go to Morgan Stanley and sit on a desk for two years, or that's how you learn how to really trade it. I don't think that's true at all in any way, shape or form.
01:07:55.872 - 01:08:42.487, Speaker A: This is what I respect about you guys, both of you. Like, I played the game and I went and wore the tie and sat at the desk and did that. It didn't like all it, all it did was just pre screen me to join what was ultimately the most ridiculous shitcoin casino of all time. Right? One thing that's great about crypto is it democratizes those markets. And then when there's a crypto crash, unlike in crude oil, you don't literally ruin entire economies, right? It's gated. Like, the impact is limited, but there's also a positive to it too, which is that it can create wealth and it can also create an alternative to some of these rigged tradfi systems that are controlled by suspicious people. So I like that.
01:08:42.487 - 01:08:43.151, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:08:43.247 - 01:09:09.544, Speaker B: And my cope is that it's actually taught a generation of individuals the power of second order thinking because you actually have to if you want to be successful. I mean, there's so many people now that, like, okay, how do I play this game? How do I think about this? How do I get better at this? What's the monetary incentive to get better at this? I mean, people are, you know, people are, I think, actually having to put some brain power into this, which is, which is probably a good thing.
01:09:10.164 - 01:10:00.892, Speaker C: It's important. I think it's also like teaching, like, finance wise. It's not like in crypto, obviously, the risks are much higher. But, like, once you have that, like, I think the process of managing your own money is gonna shift way, way, way more back to the individual than away from, like, pushing that on other people to do it for you in like, these next few years, like this next decade, one is because people are going to be forced to. It's like, okay, how do I be more efficient with, like, scaling up my savings? And then the other reason is I just think we're kind of shifting away from the trust in these, like, big corporate institutions back to, like, the individual. Just like, in a way, I think that's happening across different markets in different ways. If you can see it a little bit with, like, how marketing works now.
01:10:00.892 - 01:10:17.744, Speaker C: There's a ton of marketing directly to these content creators. These people who have a ton of followers online do much, much better with marketing than these big companies do with their regular advertisements. It's like, individual, I think, is a big, big narrative shift that's kind of happening.
01:10:18.284 - 01:11:01.058, Speaker A: I couldn't agree with you more. And I think that, I think you're right. Managing your own money teaches you risk management techniques much more than just like, offloading your dough to some robo manager will ever do. So, yeah, I think cryptos financially educating a generation. And it's impressive for me having, you know, having the opportunity to talk to you ansem about what you're doing. When I was your age, I had, you know, years of white shoe banking experience, but I was a fucking horrendous trader in hindsight, because manage my own money, meanwhile, like, you're miles ahead, you're disciplined, you're journaling. Like, these are things I learned to do in my thirties.
01:11:01.058 - 01:11:02.374, Speaker A: It's well done.
01:11:03.794 - 01:11:05.226, Speaker C: Thank you, man. I appreciate.
01:11:05.410 - 01:11:10.154, Speaker B: Crypto forces you to grow up fast because basically what happens is you just lose all your money, and then either.
01:11:10.194 - 01:11:18.926, Speaker C: You learn facts, you get wrecked, you get wrecked a few times, you're like, fuck, how do I keep. How do I stop getting wrecked? How do I stop this from happening?
01:11:19.070 - 01:11:20.554, Speaker B: Dude, thanks for coming on.
01:11:21.134 - 01:11:21.654, Speaker A: Thank you.
01:11:21.694 - 01:11:22.566, Speaker C: Thanks for having me, man.
01:11:22.630 - 01:11:23.246, Speaker B: I appreciate it.
01:11:23.270 - 01:11:25.594, Speaker C: It's fun. Gotta get Kobe on next, dude.
01:11:26.094 - 01:11:32.634, Speaker B: Yeah, that would. That would be an interesting one. You like calling in? Calling in using Starlink.
01:11:34.654 - 01:11:38.874, Speaker C: Like, oh, no. He's like. He's like, actually in space.
01:11:40.814 - 01:11:55.032, Speaker B: Are you in the is? Why are you floating? All right, dude. Well, we got. We got an hour to prep. We'll get back to the markets. Thank you all, you know, for listening. This is one of the longer thousand x podcasts. So it was action packed, though.
01:11:55.032 - 01:11:56.644, Speaker B: So I'll be long for a reason.
01:11:56.944 - 01:11:58.804, Speaker C: Yeah. Not more.
01:11:59.344 - 01:12:03.984, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Ansel. See, abhi, great talking to you, as always. Go.
