00:00:00.160 - 00:00:11.390, Speaker A: Take July off. Just look for Alpha. Stop worrying about trying to pick the bottom. Unless we trade 55, maybe 52. Like, don't. Don't worry about going all in. Don't worry about lever long and BTC.
00:00:11.390 - 00:00:25.850, Speaker A: And then depending on where we are, August, mid August. All right, this shit's going higher, so make your shopping. Make it. Make your shopping list of coins now, and I'll see you at end of the year.
00:00:26.220 - 00:00:26.908, Speaker B: See you then.
00:00:26.964 - 00:00:37.160, Speaker C: This episode is brought to you by perennial finance, the on chain Defi Primitive, redesigning derivatives for the Defi native. You'll hear more about perennial later in the show.
00:00:44.580 - 00:01:05.702, Speaker A: All right, welcome back to another episode of 1000 X. Now we're actually going to be talking about markets. I know you guys missed us last week. We went deep on. We went deep on Arweave. But enough has happened in the markets that I think it's worthwhile talking about. So we sold off pretty aggressively tagged that 58 five level, bounced really hard.
00:01:05.702 - 00:01:45.580, Speaker A: And now we're sort of just meandering around. I mean, that this has been like. I actually think that the market was reasonably easy to trade up until the last week or up until that sell off. So I don't know about you, Jonah, but I bid a lot on that day that we collapsed, and then we bounced, and I wasn't really sure if that was the full bottom or not. So I ended up taking off a lot of profit on that initial bounce. And then what ends up happening is that we're hitting 62. 62 kind of hard to get through.
00:01:45.580 - 00:02:30.806, Speaker A: But I made a bet around 61.5 that we were going higher. So I ended up buying just a lot of length, end up lifting all the Solana meme coins. I grew a rally stash hoping that we'd get to 64. And then the us government starts moving BTC. We sell off, we get down to that 6800 level, and I just go, oh, fuck. Did I make a mistake adding a ton of length, end up basically cutting all my positions, getting to flat selling BTC against some of the alts.
00:02:30.806 - 00:03:09.302, Speaker A: I ended up getting out of all the soul and all the whiff and bonk. And then I wake up today and an hour later, you get this crazy salon ETF news, and everything that I sold is up fucking 20%. And that's just the life of a trader, Jonah. That's the life of a trader. You're never, always going to be perfect. We can pat ourselves on the back for missing the drawdown, but the reality is that this has been a tough market, I think, for a lot of people. It's hard to maintain conviction because the camps are so divided right now.
00:03:09.302 - 00:03:43.170, Speaker A: Okay, well, there's one that says we're at the bottom of the range. We defended it, now we go to the top of the range. Now the real rally starts. Bad news isn't sending us lower, but the reality is that we're still not getting a ton in ETF inflows. Bitcoin is still trading a bit weak. It's hard for it to get through significant levels, but alts are down 80% across the board. You have some dispersion that's come back in the market, which is really good to see.
00:03:43.170 - 00:04:19.910, Speaker A: And ETH and Sol have been trading really well. And we're in this weird spot here where I think bitcoin has become the weak asset. Everything else is trading a lot better. And the question is, well, how do you trade that market environment, right? If you want to trade it, how do you trade it? Because one of the things that's scary, right, is whenever you get this dispersion in the market, alts are doing well. Bitcoin's not. If bitcoin pukes down to 55, these alts are. You're dead.
00:04:19.910 - 00:04:38.928, Speaker A: They're probably down 30, 40% on you. Then you're in the hole. So it's like this weird dynamic where it's very easy to get chopped up, it's very easy to. To make mistakes, and it's also hard to build conviction. So when you're in this type of market environment, what do you do, Joe?
00:04:39.104 - 00:05:27.080, Speaker B: Well, first of all, I just want to say I appreciate you being a little bit vulnerable on the podcast and saying, hey, you know, I added length, I sold it a bit lower, and then I watched the coins that I sold rally, and I wasn't participating. Like, I really admire that you're willing to do that, because, you know, even. Even me on, you know, just when I talk about my positions, often I'm inclined to talk about my wins and pretend I never lose. So I think it's important for everybody to just be honest with themselves. And, you know, it's nice to hear that, you know, even. Even crypto traders who have made it like you in a major institutional way, can still have these feelings that, like, even the very beginners have, you know, it's nice to hear you talk about it.
00:05:27.380 - 00:06:02.102, Speaker A: What I do in these markets, what's kind of funny is that I've traded a lot this month. I've put on probably more than $100 million worth of volume through on trades this month. Alone. And I'm flat because of, I avoided the drawdown. Right. I'm still basically flat on the month, even with all this effort that I put in, which is kind of funny sometimes. That's just how trading, that's just how trading works.
00:06:02.102 - 00:06:08.530, Speaker A: I mean, I'll pat, like, I give myself a little pat on the back just because I didn't take a loss.
00:06:09.350 - 00:06:51.152, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, if you're trading that much volume, transaction costs are negative and guaranteed. So if you're trading that much volume in and out, like, you know, basically your process made money and you bled it back on, transaction costs is basically what happened. It's hard to trade that much volume and not lose money. That's a lot of volume to be in and out of. But, yeah, I appreciate that you're telling the truth and being honest, because it gives all of us license to be honest, too. What I do in these markets is nothing like, I look at the chart and I just see something that's been ranging since February, since late February.
00:06:51.152 - 00:07:36.766, Speaker B: I see the more I zoom out, the more I just see this, like, flat line, like realized 60 day realized volatility in bitcoin Avi is 35%. Okay. Like, this is, this asset looks like a tradfi asset in terms of how little it's doing. So, like, it's very easy to get hyper involved when it's rallying and then hyper bearish when it's selling off. I try to remind myself that this thing is going sideways, it is boring. And not to touch the screen, I have a yellow sticky note on my monitor saying, don't over trade. That's basically how I deal with these types of ranging sideways markets.
00:07:36.766 - 00:07:57.478, Speaker B: I'm a momentum trader by persuasion. I just love momentum trading in commodities, especially in the refined product space. You find mean reversion traders who just love selling highs and buying lows. And if you're a mean reversion trader, this is a great market. Every time it goes up to 68k, you sell. Every time it goes down to 63k, you buy. And you just round trip that again and again.
00:07:57.478 - 00:08:53.036, Speaker B: You would have had a really awesome few months. But how many of those traders exist in crypto? Really? People who tried to fade moves in crypto all died of $50,000 ago in bitcoin. They got fired or stopped out or rage quit because they lost so much money. So what youre left with is this group of momentum traders like you and me, and we struggle during these times when its ranging. So basically, the only way to make money in a market thats ranging this tightly is to have a process, something you can cling to when the markets going down, and something you can use as a framework to decide if you should be adding or selling on rallies. If you don't have a process and the market sells off, you start to doubt yourself because you're obviously long. Then if something comes up like the US is moving tokens to coinbase kind of thing, then you can panic and sell, which is the right thing to do.
00:08:53.036 - 00:09:19.512, Speaker B: You get out of the way of flows. But then when deciding whether or not to rebuy, that's where your process kicks in, because you're scared. You've just avoided a steamroller. You don't know what to do next. You have to have some framework. And for me, I don't really have a good systematic framework. Frameworks that I learned at Cumberland are all mid frequency things that like basically with an outlook of minutes or hours that I can't really replicate in my PA because I don't care enough and I don't have time.
00:09:19.512 - 00:09:52.132, Speaker B: But like, you know, in terms of this type of like longer frequency trades with the horizon of days or weeks, I got nothing systematically. So really the only framework that I cling to right now, Avi, is the idea that I'm like ludicrously bullish for Q four. Like, I think by then we'll be like really rallying. So all that's the only thing that allows me to psychologically hang on. And if we go, you know, I kind of have this $55,000 level in mind. If we go down there, I'll probably buy more. In the meantime, all I'm doing is fucking around at the meme coin casino, which I don't really consider investment.
00:09:52.132 - 00:09:59.860, Speaker B: I like. You're probably trading it as levered crypto, right? For me, it's more just like something to have fun with. While I'm bored with the benchmarks, this.
00:09:59.900 - 00:10:41.214, Speaker C: Episode is brought to you by perennial finance. Perennial is quickly becoming one of the go to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of Defi. So let me tell you a little bit about them. There are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on. First one, great trade execution. Second one, low fees, and third, of course, an on chain permissionless platform, and perennial nails all three of those buckets. With the launch of perennial v two, they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles, which reduce trade execution execution to seconds, lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers.
00:10:41.214 - 00:11:01.678, Speaker C: Fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there. And fourth, cash settled, right? The trades are cash settled in USD, not in crypto. Perennial allows you, the trader, to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the TVL. How it works is that perennial enables a two sided market made up of both traders and liquidity providers.
00:11:01.734 - 00:11:01.974, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:02.022 - 00:11:29.568, Speaker C: Traders deposit the assets to get levered exposure, while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position. Perennial allows you to trade crypto, herps, FX and coming soon, nfts and more. Backed by some of the best investors in the industry, perennial is a must checkout platform. If you're a crypto trader, go check them out by clicking the the link in the description. Give thousand x some credit. Go check out perennial. You're going to love them.
00:11:29.568 - 00:11:31.368, Speaker C: All right, let's get back to the show.
00:11:31.504 - 00:11:52.578, Speaker A: I think that's a very key point, which is don't over trade. Don't try to do too much in this market environment. Focus on the alpha. Focus on what actually matters. Directionally. Punting is tough. I mean, you can have your core allocation if you're bullish on crypto, but then with your trading it's about.
00:11:52.578 - 00:12:22.830, Speaker A: Okay, well, instead of trying, okay, I'm going to buy a ton here. I think that bitcoin's going up. Let me try to bet on that. It's just so easy to get shaken out, speaking from experience, that it just doesn't make sense in this particular environment to be very aggressive now. Like what, what do I mean by alpha? Right. It's things that you genuinely have an edge on. Things that you think are going to work regardless of if bitcoins at 65, if bitcoins at 55.
00:12:22.830 - 00:12:57.916, Speaker A: This is a lot of pair trading. One trade that ive had on for a while is just short. All of these coins that have massive unlocks coming that are super high ftv, you hold it against ETH and bitcoin and Sol, like maybe you have $5 million of that long, you have $5 million of those coins short. And then over the next month, two months can be pretty confident that that outperforms. You obviously have to be worried about squeezes and whatnot, but most of these things have actually a positive funding, which is wild because I just think there's so much spot selling involved.
00:12:57.948 - 00:13:00.560, Speaker B: I think that's wild too. I still can't believe it.
00:13:00.900 - 00:13:01.492, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:01.596 - 00:13:54.016, Speaker B: Why? Who's paying funding. Oh, actually, I know exactly who's doing that. It's the people who, every time it starts to rally, they, they get their gambling addiction starts to tickle them, and then they go in on Bybit and OKX and get long with leverage on these sort of altcoins or shitcoins, depending on the token du jour. And then as soon as the market sells off, they all get liquidated. This week, during that big puke, down to 58,500, we had the biggest long liquidations since April. So clearly there are still people out there who just can't resist getting levered long. Guys, if gals, if you're out there getting levered long altcoins right now, paying funding away every day, bleeding, just hoping to catch this next up, move in a range.
00:13:54.016 - 00:14:06.580, Speaker B: Like the market can stay rangy longer than you can stay solvent. And if it goes down, which is kind of a coin toss in a ranging market, you get liquidated. Don't do it. Please stop with the leverage. It makes no sense.
00:14:07.540 - 00:15:14.620, Speaker A: It's really, it's insane to me that people still do that, like, just taking a step back, looking at the market, where do we think things are going to go? What do we think is going to happen? My personal view is in line with yours, but maybe a little bit earlier. So I think that Q three can be very good. I think that Q three, basically what's going to happen is over the summer, you don't have a lot of decision makers in the market that are actually making big decisions. Everybody that's allocating real capital is probably fucking off in Europe, somewhere there in the hamptons, or God knows, God knows where these people are. And so all the institutions, the people that are buying BTC, even retail, they're less engaged during the summer, they're just less engaged. So what tends to happen is that come September, these people come back in the market, and now that we have the ETF vehicles that are going to be live, you're going to probably, I'm 80, 90% sure that the ETHF will be live by September 1. After Labor Day, these people are going to come back and they're going to start buying.
00:15:14.620 - 00:15:48.150, Speaker A: I think they're going to start. They've made their decisions. They're going to come back in the market. So what does this mean for us? It means that July is probably going to be tough, but you're probably going to see some front running mid August into Labor Day, and then we can really start to get that up move. It's possible that we trade 52 in July at some point because there's a lack of inflows, because there's a lack of interest. And that's why I'm nervous, and that's why I'm trying to take a step back. Don't over trade.
00:15:48.150 - 00:16:07.024, Speaker A: Don't get chopped up when you get crazy, really, in crypto, when it comes to trading, directionally, you kind of only want to trade at the extremes when something nuts is happening. So, for example, or you want to.
00:16:07.112 - 00:16:19.590, Speaker B: You have to trade when you need to get out of the way of something, like a big us marshals sale or an FTX like event. Sometimes you just have to pull your chips off the table before the table immolates itself. Right.
00:16:19.670 - 00:16:56.986, Speaker A: But, you know, sometimes that, that's, that's exactly what went through my mind when I cut all my positions, when the us government started moving their coins, and then everything went up 20. I mean, I couldn't have known that Vanak was gonna come out with this fake ETF listing, this fake ETF product. I say fake because I don't think it's gonna get approved. There are no CME futures on this thing. Vanek is, I think, running a marketing campaign off of it. If Blackrock files, it's very, very, very different story. But I don't believe that Vanek even believes internally that it's going to get improved.
00:16:56.986 - 00:17:32.080, Speaker A: I think that they're just doing it to generate some hype, because it'd be very, really, if Biden is reelected, zero chance. If Trump is reelected, which Nate Silver puts at 65%, then I think there's probably a 20% chance that maybe 30% chance that during, at some point during his administration, the Solana ETF gets approved. But as of right now, as it stands today, I think very unlikely that that happens. That doesn't mean I'm short soul. It just means that I'm not. I wouldn't put all my chips on the table. I'm not gigalong.
00:17:32.080 - 00:17:45.666, Speaker A: Hard for me to have known that a priori, that selling with athlete, you know, 195 or whatever I stopped out at, would it would have been, would have been a bad, bad idea.
00:17:45.698 - 00:18:29.368, Speaker B: No, you did the right thing. You got out of the way of the steamroller, which our listeners should always do. Like, if something, you know, there's obviously a balance here. Like, if you hear something that's, like, marginally bearish, you're not supposed to take all your chips off the table, but if there's, like, a massive amount of government flow about to smack the market, and, you know, nine or ten figure size imminently, which is what happens when tokens get sent to a major exchange. You get out of the way. Now, something that im horrendous at in my oil trading career is, im very good at getting out of the way of those things or getting in as just before theyre happening and profiting. But then what Im terrible at is taking my position off afterwards or if ive taken it off, re adding it.
00:18:29.368 - 00:19:06.876, Speaker B: Im very bad at resetting to the state that preceded my drastic action. And I've lost so many millions of dollars in my oil career over the years. Like, for example, getting long for all the right reasons ahead of a very bullish summer in 2018. But then when Trump wavered Iran sanctions and oil started to puke, I was in denial. I'd gotten in for the right reasons. But then I didn't realize that the world had changed equally. You know, in this example, like, you get out of the way of a big steamroller, out of, out of a big selling flow, you and I both know that selling flow doesn't last for months or years.
00:19:06.876 - 00:19:13.700, Speaker B: Or if it does, it doesn't have an impact on the market. Like, you have to get back in quick, right? And I'm terrible at that. I'm terrible at resetting it.
00:19:13.740 - 00:19:53.686, Speaker A: I actually have a psychological trick for you because I also was horrendous at this. I've gotten a lot better by doing this. I mean, let's say, let's say you, I'll give you the example, start with $100. You're long, $100 and you get this news of the government selling and you get out, you sell, right? And then it bounces back and nothing happens. And you're like, wait a second. Well, the way that most people's, their brain works is because they sold and it didn't work. They get anchored to the idea that it's bearish.
00:19:53.686 - 00:20:26.540, Speaker A: And you start, you start looking for reasons why the market is bearish and then you convince yourself that it's bearish and then you never get back in position. And if it rips in your face, you're fucked. And sometimes, by the way, by the way, sometimes that's the right thing to do. Sometimes it actually is bearish. But you in that moment are not looking at it. Clearly, you're not looking at it. So what do you do? How do you reset your brain? You buy $5 worth, you buy tiny size, you get back in to your original position a little bit, not a huge amount.
00:20:26.540 - 00:20:43.684, Speaker A: Not the, not what. And then your brain starts to go, well, maybe if bitcoin is up, at least I'm up now. So you start to look for the bullish reasons, and that actually resets your brain a little bit. And you're not risking a ton, you're not getting chopped up a huge amount. But what it does is it helps.
00:20:43.692 - 00:20:45.252, Speaker B: You, but you have skin in the game again.
00:20:45.316 - 00:20:47.970, Speaker A: You have skin in the game again, and it helps you think more clearly.
00:20:48.060 - 00:21:15.478, Speaker B: It's amazing how difficult it is to understand a market without skin in the game. And you have a very solid point. It's like it's tempting to just be on the sidelines after something's just happened, anchored to that thing, even if it's gone and dissipated. But then you should have skin in the game, because then you feel the market a little bit more without the 100% risk that you were running previously. That's really smart. I like that. I've done that inadvertently without realizing I was doing it a couple of times.
00:21:15.478 - 00:21:25.598, Speaker B: And now that I reflect on it, that was a successful way to maneuver myself back into things. I should just write that down in my trading journal and do that more often. Thank you, Avi. That's really helpful.
00:21:25.774 - 00:22:11.340, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm happy you found some value in it. It's amazing how many things about trading are psychological, because even if you're extremely data driven, which I know we both are, if you're a discretionary trader, at the end of the day, even if you're using a lot of quantitative metrics, you still have to make that decision. And what ends up happening in these moments is you end up introducing inertia. So when you get on the sidelines, and then that decision to get on the sidelines doesn't seem like it's playing out. Your instinct as a human is to just stay there because you don't want to deal with the idea that you were wrong. So the buying it, what buying a tiny bit, what it does is it helps you accept that you might have been wrong, and then you look at it clearly, and then you make a decision.
00:22:11.340 - 00:22:14.344, Speaker A: This is the right way to do it.
00:22:14.432 - 00:22:32.240, Speaker B: This is so smart. And also, what's so beautiful about this idea is it dovetails absolutely perfectly with our earlier conversation. And something that I really. A point I really wanted to make, which is that you said all the big hitters are off to wherever hitters go for the summer. I don't know. Stad. St.
00:22:32.240 - 00:22:36.886, Speaker B: Moritz. No, that's the winter, anyway. I don't know. Yeah, that's a winter.
00:22:36.918 - 00:22:38.290, Speaker A: Are you even a socialite?
00:22:38.830 - 00:22:47.006, Speaker B: Obviously not. People go to Mykonos, whatever. The point is, the hitters are. The hitters are hitting. They're not. They're not. Or, sorry, they're not hitting.
00:22:47.006 - 00:23:21.168, Speaker B: They're at the, they're, they're at the, the beach club. But you know who else is not playing right now? All the people who just got burned on this chop, all the momentum traders in crypto who have been momentum trading for years and is now we're in a range. They've gotten chopped up, pissed off, they've taken their chips off the table, and they're not doing an Avi. There's not like 5% of the chips back on. They're just out, out. And what happens in those markets is, like, this happens in oil, too, especially during the summer. Like you said, if it's a summer where everybody's super dialed in, like the summer of Ukraine, then whatever.
00:23:21.168 - 00:23:52.486, Speaker B: But this summer, people are going to dial out. The crowd that's gotten chopped up and lost a bunch of money is out. So who's providing liquidity? Moves get gappy in these environments, like sell offs. They go lower than they would have otherwise. If there are a bunch of people aggressively clicking and buying because of whatever reason, rallies tend to get extended to the upside, and you end up with these kind of random noise, brownian motion, high amplitude, hard to analyze markets. So not over trading. This is key.
00:23:52.486 - 00:24:38.720, Speaker B: Things can get violent. And a lot of people, from the institutional players to the day to day traders who would be trading but are sidelined right now for the reasons we just discussed, all that liquidity is out. So who's left? Who's left? It feels like the initial spat of institutions coming in to get structurally long via the ETF. It feels like that flow's died off, but the ETF inflows and outflows are massive. Avi, I think there was a streak of $1.2 billion worth of outflows that just got broken this week. And what's happening there is, I think there are institutions that are playing basis, so not all of it is like, directional flow.
00:24:38.720 - 00:25:14.682, Speaker B: It's just people getting in and out of the ETF against CME futures. But that also drives sentiment. So people see ETF outflows and they freak out and sell. So ultimately what you're left with is these, like CTA like, kind of momentum players in a ranging market. It's a real recipe for losses. So what I'm doing is maybe I should be, I'm long, but I'm not trying to trade this range. I'm long with a plan to add if it really shanks, because, like you, I think we're going to be in for quite a rally later this year.
00:25:14.682 - 00:25:18.230, Speaker B: Every having in the past has preceded one. I don't think this time's any different.
00:25:18.730 - 00:26:23.932, Speaker A: Maybe it's as simple as selling short dated volume, buying long dated volume. You know, just trying to find places where the view that you express, you actually have high conviction in. Like, if you decide to go buy a ton of alts right now, or you decide to go long BTC, or you decide to go long ETH, what's your actual conviction level on that? Right, like, first it's like, it's one thing if, I mean, I'll give you an example, right? You're super bullish on Ethan. You think that ETH is going up, but if ETH trades 3300, then you stop out of the position. How convicted are you actually? What is the actual trade that you're putting on? This is really important to recognize, to stop yourself from getting chopped up. The way that you can think about it is I buy here, I wake up tomorrow, bitcoin is at 60K. What am I doing? Do I have more money to buy? Am I stopping out of my position? If you're stopping out, you're probably not supposed to be buying, Preston.
00:26:23.956 - 00:26:50.202, Speaker B: Yeah. You get in thinking you're an eight out of ten convicted, and then you get out two days later with, you're like, you're basically a two out of ten convicted. So you're not understanding your own psychology. One way to play this really well, though, is with options. Like, I do this in oil all the time in ranging markets because commodities range. When the price goes too high, people just stop buying it and the price goes back down. It's not quite like bitcoin, where there's an everyday physical consumption component to it.
00:26:50.202 - 00:27:27.386, Speaker B: So anyway, like, when we're in a ranging market and I'm in low conviction mode, but I have like a structural long term, let's say long position that I think will matter in two to eight months. I don't know when. So let's say the market rallies a little bit. I'll sell some live calls. Why? Because if the market suddenly proves me right way earlier than expected, I'm still happy if the market. And then when the market inevitably pukes back down, I sell some live puts at a strike where I'm happy to be adding to my position. If the market were to puke through my strike, that's like strikes where I'm willing to get longer.
00:27:27.386 - 00:28:01.008, Speaker B: So the equivalent of bitcoin would be, hey, we just traded up to 68k. I'm huddling, I'm bullish bitcoin for a decade. So I'm happy to sell some $73,000 short dated calls. Then we trade back down to 62,000, sell some $60,000 calls, and if it trades through my level, I just got longer at $60,000. Great, I'm happy. Then it goes back up, sell some more calls. You leg into a strangle that way by selling live calls in either direction, obviously in sizes that you can tolerate to the downside, getting longer, to the upside, getting taken out of your position.
00:28:01.008 - 00:28:13.180, Speaker B: And I think that's a really elegant way to sell volume as opposed to just trying to trade live or sorry, hedge strangles and Delta hedge. To me, it's simpler just to sell the live options as the market ranges.
00:28:14.120 - 00:29:07.260, Speaker A: I actually, I really like that. What I would probably do in this particular scenario, because I'm very bullish on ETH BTC is I'd express the, you know, I'd basically express the upside with ETH and downside with, with BTC. I mean if there's, if there's a, if there's a. I think one way to do this is basically you could sell BTC calls to buy ETH calls. Even though the fall on ETH is obviously elevated, I think that the spread is still underpriced based on the way that people are pricing in this ETF. I think on every one of our markets podcasts, I've been super bearish on the ETH ETF. And now that we've sold out a lot bearish higher and now that were lower, my view is that a lot of the ETF is basically being priced as that nothing is going to happen.
00:29:07.260 - 00:29:09.760, Speaker A: It might actually be negative at this point.
00:29:10.220 - 00:29:20.836, Speaker B: So now that were on the lows of the range, you could sell ETH puts. And then when we go back to the highs of the range, at some point you sell bitcoin calls. Thats one way to do it. Yeah.
00:29:20.948 - 00:29:42.640, Speaker A: Right. And thats effectively what Im thinking about right here is that I think that the ETH ETF is now we're probably fairly priced. If ETH trades 3100, then you're probably supposed to be buying as much eth as you could possibly get your hands on. Yeah, because I think that at 3100 it's priced to say ETF is going to hurt ETh.
00:29:43.460 - 00:30:03.210, Speaker B: Yeah, that has the same, like that $3,100 ETH in this environment has the same feel as like sub thousand dollar ethnic did in 2022 where you're just like, I know things are not the greatest they could be, but fuck, like this is. It's time. Got to get in.
00:30:03.250 - 00:30:36.718, Speaker A: Yes 100% agree with that. What's been really interesting to me is that even as bitcoin has sold off, alts have done okay ever since bitcoin. Basically ever since 64k bitcoin. Obviously Alts had a massive drawdown. I think they've just washed out a lot of the sellers. And so what I see is even if bitcoin goes sideways, there might be some opportunities for alts to outperform. And if bitcoin trades lower, thats probably an opportunity for you to buy alts.
00:30:36.718 - 00:31:04.528, Speaker A: I mean one thing that ive learned is sell the weak asset, right. You want to sell whatever is actually weak at the time. So what I noticed, and I've made this mistake, I'll probably continue to make this mistake. I see a lot of people make this mistake. Okay. Bitcoin is there's a lot of movement from the government or from German Germany or whatever right. A lot of supply of bitcoin hitting the market.
00:31:04.528 - 00:31:43.040, Speaker A: And people go, well if I short bitcoin then maybe it only goes down 5% but I can short a bunch of alts and if bitcoin's down 5% then it'll go down 15 20%. Thats only true if theres no catalyst for bitcoin going down or if theres exuberance in the alt market. Alts are high relative to BTC at any given moment. If the reason that the market is going down is bitcoin supply, sell bitcoin, dont try to short. If you try to short avax, youd be down. If you try to short eth, youre down. You short bitcoin, you're basically flat from when that news came out.
00:31:43.040 - 00:32:03.424, Speaker A: Right. So sell the asset that's actually being impacted by the news. There's a lot of what I. There's a lot of beta chasing in crypto. There's a lot of. Okay well if eth gets an eTf then I'm going to go buy all of the eth beta. And I generally think that's a losing trade generally.
00:32:03.424 - 00:32:20.246, Speaker A: I think that it's almost always better to just buy the thing that's actually getting the flows of because everything else is just being bid by traders. Which means that you need to get in and get out and you need to be better than everyone else trading that asset.
00:32:20.358 - 00:32:23.734, Speaker B: Yeah. Like meme coin style, in, out.
00:32:23.902 - 00:32:24.902, Speaker A: It's tough.
00:32:25.086 - 00:32:47.126, Speaker B: It's very difficult. I mean, I have a slightly. I don't know if I disagree with what you just said. I agree with some of it, but not all of it. Basically, the way that I think about alts in this market, you are right. For the past week, alts have been rallying versus bitcoin. And it hasn't been like they stopped selling off and moved up in a little bit rally.
00:32:47.126 - 00:33:41.666, Speaker B: It's been kind of sharp. But I still think if you zoom out and look at the broader altcoin charts versus bitcoin, it's been pretty much down only for the entire year, and only in the last week have they perked up meaningfully. So I don't know whether this altcoin strength that you referred to is part of the downtrend, just like a little bit of one of those rallies that's part of a much bigger downtrend or whether it's a turn. And I think I'm much more bearish altcoins than you. I think that this time is, in fact, different. I do not think that the alts, like, in a proper bitcoin and eth rally, that the altcoin space as a whole, not saying that, like, there will always be certain alts that just gas higher and you know, you know how to find those alts. You do your, you do your research, you can pick them.
00:33:41.666 - 00:35:08.378, Speaker B: But, like, the altcoin space as a whole, I think is going to underperform a rally this time for a very specific reason, which is that I think retail has been too burned on alts. And I think after two cycles, 2017 and 2021, of everybody and their grandmother and their dentist talking about tezos or some random altcoin. Now, at this point, crypto is mature enough that the participant base has dissociated itself from the idea that an altcoin associated with an interesting computational product, but with actually no underlying value transfer mechanism is going to moon anymore. I think Luna was the end of that perception. And so I think this will be a very institutional, benchmark led rally this year. I think that, especially if Trump wins, the market is not pricing the ten out of ten bearish to eight out of ten bullish flip flop that the SEC is going to do after he installs his people in there. And I think that will, I think that you basically see that translate to l one s and bitcoin first, and then you'll get an altcoin rally later when there's a securities framework for those things to actually, like, pass through genuine economic activity to token holders.
00:35:08.378 - 00:35:26.050, Speaker B: But until then, if you're buying, like, even our favorite one, if you're buying ondo, like, what are you hoping for? Like, oh, people will bid governance tokens? Like, no, I think the retail community is just done getting burned on those things. Maybe. Maybe this is a mid curve take, but I don't know.
00:35:27.270 - 00:35:44.062, Speaker A: I think it's a mid curve for one reason. No offense, jonah, bring it on. But it's. I don't know if these things are going up. Well, first of all, everybody's still bidding meme coins. Meme coins are the best performers off the bottom. People are still bidding with.
00:35:44.062 - 00:35:45.302, Speaker A: They're still bidding bonk.
00:35:45.406 - 00:35:54.660, Speaker B: Oh, I'm not talking about memes, by the way. When I say alts, I'm not referring to memes. I'm referring to tokens associated with projects that are actually trying to do something.
00:35:55.000 - 00:36:22.400, Speaker A: Yeah, I think governance tokens in general, agreed. Like the Lidos of the world that don't pass back cash. I will say that maker and Aave have been doing very well over the last week. Unfortunately, maker going up is normally a sign of impending doom. Maybe that's different. Maybe that's different this time. But I do generally agree that that sector of the market will underperform until there's a framework to pass back cash to holders.
00:36:23.060 - 00:36:28.720, Speaker B: Yeah, like the, oh, let me buy the curve, curve token, because curve is a cool product. Era is over. That's all I'm saying.
00:36:29.220 - 00:37:09.276, Speaker A: 100%. And that's kind of two reasons. One is that retail this time genuinely feels less sophisticated. Like, the market participants that are coming in this cycle seem stupider and less sophisticated than the market participants that came in in 2021. I know that sounds crazy, but you can just see it by where they put their money and what they talk about and what they do. If you remember the CT timeline in 2021, everybody was talking about the crazy new DeFi, primitive new products, like weird ways of structuring things. Everybody was talking about complicated stuff.
00:37:09.276 - 00:37:24.070, Speaker A: There were all these long tweet threads explaining how, you know, bribes on butterfly work. I mean, how can you redirect yield to certain pools, you know, how, how to play the game of defi.
00:37:24.410 - 00:37:27.402, Speaker B: Yeah. How balancer is better for this or that than curve.
00:37:27.466 - 00:37:27.714, Speaker A: Right?
00:37:27.762 - 00:37:29.642, Speaker B: I remember it all like it was.
00:37:29.826 - 00:37:38.362, Speaker A: It was more sophisticated. And today all you have is, you have people that are like, I'm going to, for the next ten days, tweet out the ten meme coins that I'm going to buy.
00:37:38.506 - 00:38:01.962, Speaker B: Well, let me debate you on this. I don't think it's that crypto participants are less sophisticated than they were last time. I think it's that none of that sophistication made anybody any money. Everybody bought all the sophisticated stuff, and it went down 99%. Like, I'll tell you, at Goldman Sachs, when I was an oil trader, my business was market making. I was screaming all day. I had two phones standing up.
00:38:01.962 - 00:38:26.506, Speaker B: I was the loudest guy on the, you know, fifth floor of Goldman Sachs because oil was so busy. And I remember during that time, fine, I was in my mid twenties, first, making money. And there was a little bit of a testosterone and ego high associated with that. But, like, I thought that fundamentals didn't matter. I thought that fundamentals didn't drive the price of oil. And I was pretty arrogant about that, right? And I was like, fundamentals don't matter. What matters is the flows.
00:38:26.506 - 00:39:15.712, Speaker B: Cause that's how I made my money. Every time I tried to learn about west african differentials or some storage tank in Rotterdam, it didn't impact my p and l, so I ignored it, because the money came from people trading with me. And I think the same thing is going on right now in crypto, where people are like, you know what? No matter how deep I dive into the, you know, into this, into the microeconomics of Nir's AI ecosystem, like, none of it. Like we just said, the regulatory framework isn't there. None of that computational genius creates value that passes through to token holders. All they're getting is a governance token that's adjacent, but not connected to the actual tech that they're going to try and analyze. So much like me thinking fundamentals didn't matter, the current market, like, kind of accepts.
00:39:15.712 - 00:39:45.740, Speaker B: Like, hey, that's not what's driving the size of the wad in my wallet right now. What's driving the size of my wallet is like, are other people other are greater fools going to lift my bunk at a higher price than I paid for my bunk up? And that's fine. I think that's economically rational behavior. When securities legislation arrives such that we can connect the complex tech and the fundamentals to the token price, I think all that sophistication will make people money, and it'll come right back onto the timeline. What do you think?
00:39:45.820 - 00:40:25.220, Speaker A: So, basically, what I'm hearing from you, I mean, I agree with you, actually, 100%. It didn't make anybody money. All of this sophistication took a lot more brainpower, it took a lot more effort, and at the end of the day, you actually got similar returns to meme coins, both to the upside and the downside. So all of the fundamentals behind these things didnt make sense anyway. Why would you spend time trying to figure out what the fundamentals of an asset are if it doesnt matter? So thats fair. What ill say is that I think were closer to that securities regulation than people think. I mean, if Trump gets elected, then we're there.
00:40:25.220 - 00:40:41.920, Speaker A: I'm going to make a bet that if we get to October and it looks like Trump is about to win, then you probably want to buy a lot of AAve, a lot of maker a lot of the fundamental assets because I think that it's going to be easier for, it's going to be a much better regulatory environment.
00:40:42.080 - 00:40:49.248, Speaker B: Yeah, you're frontrunning the projects that will rally when the eventual regulatory pass through stuff happens.
00:40:49.424 - 00:41:24.402, Speaker A: Correct. And just lift all the ondos and pendles of the world if that looks like it's going to be the case, because there could be a return to fundamentals. I mean, the way that you described it, you talked a lot about retail. Retail, you're right, they aren't buying that because it doesn't matter. But then also the institutions aren't buying it because when they look at it, there's no real reason to buy these things. And so the things that tend to perform the best are general narrative plays. So, for example, AI probably going to have another echo bubble or have another bubble for that at some point.
00:41:24.402 - 00:41:56.456, Speaker A: You probably want some exposure there. Like if things start to sell off, you want to lift AI. I'm definitely going to be lifting RWA because I'm making that bet as like a Trump bet that's going to do well. But I mean, in the meantime, really, the only great trade that I see is just shorting the high FTV alts against the majors. And it's been a great trade. I think it will continue to be a great trade. I mean, some of these things, like world coin have $19 million a day on the horizon coming out.
00:41:56.456 - 00:42:28.858, Speaker A: I don't know who's buying that. I think alt layer has unlocked. That's 123 million on a market cap of 2 billion, which is nuts. So that's alpha. But yeah, I mean, directionally punting BTC and ETH, not so much. And so talking to you for these last 40 minutes, what's kind of interesting to me is that we have a lot of ideas that are far out. We have a lot of ideas for how to make money in like three months, but not too many ideas for right now.
00:42:29.034 - 00:42:45.196, Speaker B: I mean, selling alts versus the majors is an idea that we've talked about on this podcast for months now. And that is, with the exception of the last week, it's been quite a smooth trend. So maybe this little pop is a chance to get into that trade or add to that trade.
00:42:45.388 - 00:42:48.652, Speaker A: I'll clarify. I don't know if it's selling. It's not just selling alts, it's selling.
00:42:48.676 - 00:42:54.076, Speaker B: The things that are high FTV alts that unlocks. And no roadmap. Yeah, exactly.
00:42:54.268 - 00:43:14.034, Speaker A: Right. I mean, there are pockets that are showing strength. I mean, for some reason, Avax refuses to sell off. I don't know what's going on there. Kind of an interesting one. Another one that's been amazing, which is actually core holding of mine, is Taun, because Taun has. I mean, I think people are sleeping on it, especially in the west.
00:43:14.162 - 00:43:15.370, Speaker B: 800 million users.
00:43:15.410 - 00:43:57.000, Speaker A: Yeah, 800 million users. The games on Taun, if you've played hamster or going nuts, I mean, it's getting real usage. And I genuinely think that in a year, in two years, this is going to be one of the major blockchains that people use. And if you look at Solana, I mean, like, Solana is great, love Solana, but Tan has the users. Tan has all the users, which is why bitcoins down 10% and Tan's up, because I think people are starting to catch on to this. A lot of people are starting to reposition because they're like, oh, wow, this thing could easily. This thing could easily trade 100 billion in the right market environment.
00:43:57.300 - 00:44:08.818, Speaker B: Let me just quickly check the market cap. I mean, tan is the. It is in the top ten. It is the 9th largest coin sandwiched between dogecoin, which is number ten, and XRP, which is number eight.
00:44:08.954 - 00:44:16.150, Speaker A: I'm actually pretty high confidence it goes to 100 at some point. So if you want to just own that for the next year.
00:44:16.730 - 00:44:19.042, Speaker B: Yeah, I like that trade. I like that.
00:44:19.146 - 00:44:50.758, Speaker A: It's actually, the thing is, it's never had an ecosystem before. It's been around for a while. Over the last three to six months, there's been a lot of building on time. There have been a lot of new projects that are coming out. Actual defi that's being built. It's going to take some time to mature, but the reality is it's being used and it will continue to be used. And unless telegram dies as an application, I think over time, you just chip away.
00:44:50.758 - 00:45:03.234, Speaker A: And a lot of these people on Telegram, they just end up using. This is how they're going to onboard onto crypto, easily turn into the vendor Venmo. Right. Paypal. You're just sending USDT on ton.
00:45:03.362 - 00:45:07.698, Speaker B: Yeah, they're going to make their wallet opt out instead of opt in. Unless you're in the US, of course.
00:45:07.754 - 00:45:10.466, Speaker A: But it's a good, you know, what's this hamster game?
00:45:10.538 - 00:45:20.882, Speaker B: Describe it. Is it like, is it. Is it fun? Is it like a super high fidelity, like, halo like game? Do you turn your phone sideways for it?
00:45:21.066 - 00:45:26.950, Speaker A: No, no, it's a. It's a game. It's a game within the. Within the Telegram app. It's like a click to play.
00:45:27.600 - 00:45:49.248, Speaker B: So it's a shitty game. All right, all right. So this fits perfectly with my thesis. Like, everybody said that web3 gaming, the AAA games, everyone was talking about that in 2022, they're like, that's what's going to save crypto. Like Axie Infinity, but Call of Duty fun, fun levels and like graphics and stuff. And what's funny is they were right. Gaming kind of did save crypto.
00:45:49.248 - 00:46:28.720, Speaker B: But the game was a meme coin casino on Solana where you buy, like, mother and I whiff and Ansem puts it on the sphere. A very different kind of game. More like for people that are as old as I am. Like the kinds of games that you would have played in Microsoft DOS rather than something that you would play on the late, like a PS five. Right. So I think that may be the kind of like weird gambling addict type crypto game that attracts users and, you know, not surprised it's happening on Telegram. Those guys are doing everything they can to bridge web two users into web3.
00:46:28.720 - 00:46:48.500, Speaker B: And by the way, they have the slickest user experience of any app on my phone. Like, Telegram is awesome. I love the little dopamine kick you get when you can, like, put an emoji on a message and like, little things fly around and, you know, it's cool. I. Telegram might actually be the channel to onboard more users. I love it.
00:46:50.860 - 00:46:57.920, Speaker A: You literally just click the hamster, buddy. It's not that complicated. It kind of sucks.
00:46:59.700 - 00:47:06.240, Speaker B: Somebody should make a meme of this. Avi, all that stuff that I just spewed about telegram is the mid curve take.
00:47:07.180 - 00:47:08.480, Speaker A: Click the hamster.
00:47:08.780 - 00:47:14.744, Speaker B: The 60 IQ take is just click the hamster. And the 150 IQ take is just click the hamster.
00:47:14.852 - 00:47:32.780, Speaker A: You know, just fucking click the hamster, bro. Stop. Stop it. All this. I mean, it's shit. I mean, yes, fucking hamster combat. But I mean, look, the bottom line is that there is this thing that exists on telegram that you can play.
00:47:32.780 - 00:47:42.450, Speaker A: Play is kind of a, you know, what if clicking. If you consider that playing, it's no whatever, but it's like the beginnings of something, you know, it's the beginning.
00:47:43.270 - 00:48:26.690, Speaker B: Just because it's dumb doesn't mean that it's not going to turn into, you know, billions of dollars of FTV. Like, my friggin 13 year old cousin. When Pokemon go came out, he was like, he became real life pac man and spent his days chasing, like, weird little apparitions around abandoned lots. Like, people spend their time on, like, low fidelity games as well as high fidelity games. So why. Why not hamster and why not the meme coin casino? But, yeah, I think you're right. I think you got to dismiss some of these governance tokens and altcoins like Lido and Aave, but those are the ones you want an ondo until Trump's about to get an SEC in there that links these things through to the real businesses underneath.
00:48:26.690 - 00:48:32.630, Speaker B: And then they're going to literally just gallop upwards. It feels like.
00:48:34.700 - 00:48:48.380, Speaker A: I'm here for Jono. So just to recap, take July off. Just look for Alpha. Stop worrying about trying to pick the bottom. Unless we trade 55, maybe 52. Like, don't, don't worry about going all in. Don't worry about lever long and BTC.
00:48:48.380 - 00:49:10.216, Speaker A: Just look for Alpha. Take a little bit of, you know, take a little bit of a break. And then depending on where we are, August, mid August. All right, this shit, this shit's going higher. So make your shopping. Make your shopping list of coins. Now, all the alts that we've talked about, all the things that we've gone back and forth on.
00:49:10.216 - 00:49:19.980, Speaker A: Write down some of the lessons that you've learned how to psychologically prepare yourself to trade this type of market. And I'll see you at end of the year.
00:49:20.360 - 00:49:36.240, Speaker B: See you then. Obviously, none of this is financial advice. We don't know anything, especially me. I couldn't even read the fully diluted valuation of telegram coin off of Coingecko. Don't listen to anything we say. Just click the hamster and work on your process. Like Avi said.
00:49:36.360 - 00:49:37.344, Speaker A: Just click the hamster.
00:49:37.392 - 00:49:40.416, Speaker B: Well, you keep racking up hamster coin right there.
00:49:40.448 - 00:49:42.616, Speaker A: Look at that. Look at that.
00:49:42.768 - 00:49:44.900, Speaker B: Every time you click, it goes up by one.
00:49:45.760 - 00:49:51.520, Speaker A: Just think, I need to employ somebody to click this for me. My hands getting kind of getting tired.
00:49:51.600 - 00:50:04.974, Speaker B: I think it's useful activity. Like, you could be spending that time doing something useless like reading the news or studying crypto. Imagine instead you're getting hamster coin by clicking it. Like, what? You're actually getting value out of this. Literally.
00:50:05.022 - 00:50:15.782, Speaker A: Could not imagine reading the news when I could be clicking a hamster. The crazy thing is, it doesn't even have a coin. So I'm not really sure. Like, there's kind of nothing to do with it other than click the hamster. Cause it doesn't have a coin.
00:50:15.966 - 00:50:19.590, Speaker B: So while Avi's clicking the hamster, one thing I did want to say about.
00:50:19.670 - 00:50:21.370, Speaker A: It sounds like a sexual euphemism.
00:50:22.310 - 00:50:23.930, Speaker B: Just click the hamster, bro.
00:50:24.590 - 00:50:26.234, Speaker A: You're not clicking the hamster right.
00:50:26.342 - 00:51:08.588, Speaker B: I feel disgusting. One of the things that I did want to say, like, yeah, okay, fine. So there's a lot of crazy, complex tech out there in crypto, and I don't want to be dismissive of it. I just think that those conversations about mev extraction and the benefits of this club versus that Dex have kind of gone off of crypto Twitter and into private circles, like my boys at Ergonia or some of the on chain trading shops. Like, they're busy making money off of Jupiter and all these other on chain exchanges. There's money in there, and the technical stuff does translate to value for some people. But it's a very quanti dark world.
00:51:08.588 - 00:51:29.024, Speaker B: It's not going to be consumable by most of the retail users on crypto Twitter anymore. Most of the retail users on crypto Twitter, I agree with you. I think the sophisticated ones are watching and waiting. But, like, most of the money right now is made by clicking the hamster, not by spinning up Mev bots.
00:51:29.192 - 00:51:47.028, Speaker A: Look, you have to be really goddamn good to make money on Mev at this point. Like, you have to be really, really, really good. And, I mean, I would wager that all those threads about Mev people. Yeah, you can. Nobody actually did it except for 0.1% of the people, because it's hard.
00:51:47.164 - 00:52:05.604, Speaker B: But those people crushed it. And maybe it's not Mev right now. I think it's like, there's basically. There's latency arbitrage between on chain activity and centralized exchanges that you can scoop up. There are pennies there to be vacuumed.
00:52:05.772 - 00:52:09.412, Speaker A: That's fair. I'll let you vacuum the pennies. I will stick to my.
00:52:09.556 - 00:52:10.720, Speaker B: I'm not smart enough.
00:52:12.030 - 00:52:15.730, Speaker A: If anybody out there on the thousand x podcast is smart enough, give me a shout.
00:52:16.550 - 00:52:25.650, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll be with you, Avi. Trying to spend some time away from the screen and waiting to buy a dip and if it doesn't happen, happy days.
00:52:26.110 - 00:52:29.770, Speaker A: I'll enjoy the summer, everybody. We'll catch you on the next thousand x.
00:52:30.430 - 00:52:31.830, Speaker B: Great. Great talking to you, Avi.
00:52:31.870 - 00:52:34.390, Speaker A: Thanks a lot as always, Jonah. That was a good one.
