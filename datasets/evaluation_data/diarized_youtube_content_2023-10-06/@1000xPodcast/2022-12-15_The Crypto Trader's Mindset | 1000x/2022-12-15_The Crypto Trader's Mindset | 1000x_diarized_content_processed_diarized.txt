00:00:00.360 - 00:00:37.918, Speaker A: Instead of looking at all the same stuff that other people are looking at, try to go find the new stuff that's out there, the stuff that's overlooked. Right. And put in the work. The thing that's beautiful about this market environment, absolutely beautiful, is that we currently have, in my opinion, a lazy trader problem where people aren't putting in the work. Hey, guys. Welcome to the Thousand X podcast with you've got me, Avi, and Jonah Van Berg, here. It's funny, normally I'm a guest on podcasts, and this is actually the first time that I've led a podcast or started a podcast.
00:00:37.918 - 00:01:17.568, Speaker A: And I'm happy to have Jonah here as my partner in this. I think it's been a fun ride. Met Jonah almost a year ago now and consider him one of the. One of the smartest guys in the space. And we chat pretty regularly about what's going on in the markets. And we realized that it'd be fun to do this in a public format where we go around, we hash our ideas, we talk about what we're seeing in the markets, and we discuss what we're seeing day to day. As two professional traders, I love consuming content on podcasts.
00:01:17.568 - 00:01:56.460, Speaker A: I love listening to smart people talk about smart things. I don't know if that's going to be this podcast, but I guess we'll find out. One of the things that I felt I was missing was a perspective from people that are in the markets day to day. I'm the head of digital assets trading at Goldentree, which is a $50 billion asset manager. We just recently spun out a crypto desk, and we've got a team of ten people working on digital assets right now trading. We have a liquid, you know, we participate in liquids, we participate in venture. We sort of do everything under the sun, which I guess is a little bit unexpected for a traditional fund.
00:01:56.460 - 00:02:42.910, Speaker A: But I'm in the markets every day. One trading view with you guys every day. I'm checking Nansen with you guys every day. And so we're in the markets looking at the data, and Jonah does the same. That's he's ahead of trading over at Cumberland right now, and I don't want to speak too much for him, but the bottom line is we wanted to start something where two practitioners could get together every couple weeks and just talk about what they're seeing in the markets and hopefully generate some interesting content for you guys. The listeners out there from people that are doing this professionally, not that many professional crypto investors, crypto traders out there. So hopefully we'll have some great discussions, and we're happy to have you along for the ride.
00:02:43.062 - 00:03:05.838, Speaker B: Definitely. I mean, couldn't be more thrilled to be doing this with you, Avi. You're obviously well known in crypto circles. I'm more of a newcomer, but I appreciate you welcoming me into the fold here. I got to say, as head of trading at Cumberland, it's been a pretty wild ride. Over the last year. Crypto has gone from, let's call it euphoria at the beginning of the year to now.
00:03:05.838 - 00:04:11.958, Speaker B: I don't know whether you want to call it despair or, you know, absolute panic, but this is a wild asset class, but it's an important one. The geopolitical relevance of crypto is on the rise. And one of the theses that Avi and I had when we were talking about starting this thing was like, hey, Internet money, web3, bitcoin, all of this stuff, like it's never before in history has early stage technology been so liquid and transparent. And so if you're going to spin up a web3 company, if you're going to trade bitcoin, if you're going to just get involved in the digital world and its native assets, you got to understand these markets. And so, normally, tech people and market practitioners aren't really on the same page, and we're trying to bring everybody to the table to talk about this stuff. It's more important than ever. Trillions of dollars of value are getting kind of washed around in these markets, and we think that crypto podcasting, it's a great way to learn about the space.
00:04:11.958 - 00:04:42.400, Speaker B: But in general, what we've heard so far is mostly crypto. Podcasters tend to be journalists and nothing against them. They do great journalism, but there aren't really a lot of traders out there podcasting and talking to other traders and giving listeners the flavor of what goes on on trading floors. You know, Avi's a young thundercat superstar in the crypto space. I'm more of an older guy. I'm about ten years older than him. Before this, I was an oil trader, come from a tradfi background.
00:04:42.400 - 00:05:23.534, Speaker B: I was a partner at VTOL. It's a big fossil fuel trading company, the biggest. And I guess I joined crypto because I found it so fascinating. And it started to look familiar, a bit like a commodity would for a number of reasons that we can get into on the podcast, but I have more of a trad five background. So ultimately, hopefully, Avi and I can kind of unpack this really confusing world with a balanced perspective, where we're not going to come in and have this. I guess you get a pretty binary perspective in the space. You get people who say crypto is a scam, it's all bullshit.
00:05:23.534 - 00:05:50.402, Speaker B: It's going to zero. There's a lot of that out there. And then on the other end of the spectrum, you have these sort of crypto euphoric people who interpret everything that hits the space is giga bullish. And we want to provide you guys with a balanced perspective, try to interpret things in a reasonable way and help educate people about what we believe to be a pretty important movement. So, yeah, looking forward to it.
00:05:50.418 - 00:06:04.842, Speaker A: Avi, you really aged yourself there with the Thundercats reference. I had no idea what that was, so I looked it up. For those of you that don't know, Thundercats was apparently a show that aired from 1985 to 1989.
00:06:05.018 - 00:06:08.906, Speaker B: It was in 2d. Millennial stuff.
00:06:09.050 - 00:06:16.242, Speaker A: It was in 2d. Wow. I can't imagine watching a 2d show about thundercats. Well, I'll take it as a compliment, Jonah.
00:06:16.338 - 00:06:17.974, Speaker B: You should, man. You're a thundercat.
00:06:18.054 - 00:06:26.634, Speaker A: So with all the intro out of the way, how are you feeling about the markets today?
00:06:27.334 - 00:07:02.988, Speaker B: Well, all right, so it's a good question. I think we're in for a lot of volatility. Volumes are in the toilet right now. If you look at March as a reference point for just crypt, the number of dollars of crypto that were traded every day, you were in the kind of ten to $15 billion range if you include altcoins. Let's take volumes that we think are legitimate, that are published in a sensible kind of way. Derivatives plus spot. I think you're down 60% to 70% from those volumes on average.
00:07:02.988 - 00:07:38.462, Speaker B: And so it could be a holiday liquidity vacuum. It could be like, no one's ever going to care about this space again type thing is the most bearish interpretation possible. My personal view is that we're in for a bit of volatility, and then we're going to start to grind higher. Like, this is bad. The second biggest exchange just exploded and turned out to be an insolvent, like, pick your flowery word to describe what FTX was. So I don't see much fallout from here. If anything, there's more of a deficit of crypto than a surplus at this point.
00:07:38.462 - 00:07:39.734, Speaker B: What do you think, avi?
00:07:39.894 - 00:08:19.454, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. I tweeted out a chart the other day that basically, it's like that famous Wall street chart where it shows you the path of a bubble and it basically ends with depression. And apathy, and we're getting close. It's actually reminding me very much so of what happened in 2018, where in 2018 you had that break of six k. You sell off to three k. A lot of that was around minor death spirals. It was around balance sheet offloading.
00:08:19.454 - 00:08:32.698, Speaker A: There's even a rumor at the bottom that was circulating that freaked out a ton of people that Satoshi's coins were on the move. And obviously, none of that. None of that.
00:08:32.746 - 00:08:45.292, Speaker B: What did that feel like? You were in the markets then. What did that feel like to you as a trader? For me, I'm new in this. It obviously feels pretty miserable right now. What did it feel like to you back then when it went to three k?
00:08:45.388 - 00:09:20.324, Speaker A: Well, you have to remember that back in 2018, there were no real use cases for crypto. It was all speculation. Today, it's a lot less of that. You have Defi, you've got a lot of games that have integrated tokens. You actually got a lot of usage of ETH. You see bitcoin actually being used in a couple of different areas. The store of value narrative has really taken hold.
00:09:20.324 - 00:10:09.516, Speaker A: You can point to a bunch of different things about crypto and say, hey, yeah, FTX collapsed. Yeah, all these horrible things have happened. Yes, there was a lot of leverage on the system, but there's fundamental usage for these applications. And I think that in five years that that's going to be taken up and that real world assets are going to come to chain or metaverse economies are going to take off or whatever narrative floats your boat at the time. Today, it's a lot easier than it was in 2018. And it's for that reason, because in 2018, you're sort of sitting there and you're thinking to yourself, okay, so bitcoin just went to, it went down to three. We had a tremendous amount of people come in and just get burned.
00:10:09.516 - 00:11:00.634, Speaker A: What's going to bring people back? Is crypto just dead? Because there were a bunch of icos that all went under. Bitcoin bubble popped, ethereum bubble popped, and there wasn't that much, much that was happening on the building side that was visible to many people. So if you were really, really in it, you started to see the inklings of Defi. The first iterations of Defi, and the people that really saw the future looked at things like uniswap. It was launched in 2018, and they said, okay, this could be something. But the majority of people, they weren't looking at things like that at the time. So what you got was you just got this overwhelming sense of depression that it just wasn't coming back.
00:11:00.634 - 00:11:22.980, Speaker A: And that meant that 90% of the people that I knew that were involved in crypto in the beginning of 2017, sorry, at the end of 2017, were no longer there. At the end of 2018, I'd say probably more than 90%. So many people I knew just left. They just didn't come back. And this time, it's a lot different.
00:11:23.092 - 00:11:27.540, Speaker B: Was crypto, twitter a thing back then? Was there. Was there publicly available?
00:11:27.612 - 00:11:35.924, Speaker A: It was, yeah. Yeah, it was a thing. Yes. Totally a thing. It's just a little bit stupider than it is today, but more fun.
00:11:36.004 - 00:11:37.144, Speaker B: Hard to imagine.
00:11:37.644 - 00:12:11.544, Speaker A: And, oh, it was. It was a complete cesspool, but it was a lot of fun. And I was a really tiny account back then, just following all the big guys, but I was there and trying to keep up. But you fast forward to 2018, and so many people just left. They just got out. And when I compare that to today, most people I know are sticking around. And that actually makes me pretty bullish.
00:12:11.544 - 00:13:18.242, Speaker A: And it also makes me think that the hallmarks of a cycle are going to look a little bit different moving forward than they have in the past, because we've reached a critical point where there are enough people in this world that really believe that crypto is going to change things and can look at history and say, well, this is what happens in a boom bust cycle. Things go down 90%, and then they go back up. The useful stuff today, it's a little bit less depressing than it was in 2018 because you have that sort of foundation, but it's still apathetic. I think people are scared. I think that there are a lot of headwinds from both regulation, market structure. There are all sorts of things that are headwinds for the asset class, but I'll flip this on its head a bit, and I'll say, look at all of the horrible, terrible things that have just happened, and look at where bitcoin is trading, and look at where ethereum is trading. Yeah.
00:13:18.258 - 00:14:25.034, Speaker B: I mean, in any asset class, when the price action looks kind of like it's outperforming the most horrendous set of news events, normally you're supposed to interpret that as a sign of strength. And I agree with you to the extent that every time you're talking about use cases, for example, like, this isn't a 2018 scenario where people have totally justifiable means to say, like, hey, what is this stuff used for? Let's just start with the very basics. Bitcoin is probably a better store of value and means of exchange than the world's bottom hundred fiat currencies. If I lived in Chad, I would rather own, at worst a stable coin, at best bitcoin, rather than whatever the local currency is. In my environment, for various reasons, stablecoins, real innovation. You can move value on Christmas at 03:00 a.m. You can keep money, effectively have a dollar bank account that you can't get from JPMorgan if you don't live in a developed economy and then do digital ownership.
00:14:25.034 - 00:14:54.374, Speaker B: Plenty of people I know laugh at nfts. Plenty of older people who know what thundercats are laugh at nfts. But if you deny the ownership of digital goods and services, kind of grandpa Simpson at this stage. So just right there, you have the basis for something valuable. So I take your point about how this isn't 2018 anymore and the point you made about how people aren't leaving the space. That's true too.
00:14:54.714 - 00:15:03.514, Speaker A: Just look at this from like a practical investment perspective right now. Right? You've got, okay, so you had one of the largest exchanges in the world blow up.
00:15:03.634 - 00:15:04.122, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:04.218 - 00:15:30.006, Speaker A: You had it be a complete fraud. You had them apparently just basically selling BTC and ETH to go buy their shit. Coins of choice. Sorry, you know, bad coins of choice. And then you have ethereum trading at 1330 and bitcoin trading at that. To me, what that signals is that people, people really want these things. People want bitcoin, people want ethereum.
00:15:30.006 - 00:15:51.144, Speaker A: And if you're bearish right now, I think you're just coping. I think you're coping with the fact that you probably got hit on the way down and you're coping with the fact that you didn't buy 1515 five and you're coping with the fact that you didn't buy 1100 ethanol, right? And you're sitting there and you're going, well, it has to go down. Okay, why? Why exactly, why does it have to go down?
00:15:51.224 - 00:16:17.304, Speaker B: Similarly, people were coping on the highs when bitcoin was trading sixty nine k and things were getting more bullish and bitcoin wasn't going up bullish. From a macro perspective, I think you had weakness in crypto against the backdrop of signs of macro strength. That should have been a signal that things were headed lower. And now you have the opposite situation. So it's a good point you make there 100%.
00:16:17.464 - 00:17:13.358, Speaker A: You have a situation now. And this is, I think, a useful, generalizable framework for how to think about trading the markets. Okay, who are the buyers and who are the sellers in every scenario? Whenever I wake up in the morning and I assess the market, I look at a bunch of different data points, right? You look at your funding rates, you look at your open interest, you look at on chain metrics, you look at flows, order books, whatever you want to look at. One thing that I try to do every morning is I'll sit there and I'll think about who's a buyer today and who's a seller today of these asset class, of these assets. So in bitcoin, let's walk through that here. Who's a seller? Who is selling 18K BTC that is new to the market, right? Or that want, that wants to get out of their position, forget whether they're new.
00:17:13.406 - 00:17:32.158, Speaker B: Let's just talk about who would sell it. Ordinarily, the listeners probably want to know who are the natural sellers of bitcoin? You've got miners, they mine bitcoin. They sell it to fund their operations. Some miners. Some miners hold on to bitcoin and raise funds via debt or equity to fund their operations. But some miners just go and sell it. So you have constant miner selling.
00:17:32.158 - 00:18:08.956, Speaker B: That's one source. Another source would be, let's say, whales, early bitcoin people who bought bitcoin on Craigslist with some QR codes and now are worth hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, and they just say, hey, I want to launch some to buy another house. There's probably a bit of that. Or maybe some retail investors who got in at higher levels and now need to sell to fund lifestyle type things or a tax, tax event. Those are the types of sellers that you would normally see throughout the course of an ordinary business day in bitcoin and in ETH. It used to be miners, but they.
00:18:09.020 - 00:18:39.768, Speaker A: Stopped after the merge, which is a beautiful thing. And one thing that is important is contextualizing when those people are in the market and when they're not. So let's use bitcoin, 18K as an example. Miners, when you actually, if you look at public, you know, public miners and their balance sheets, they don't really have much bitcoin left. And I think that's actually a reasonable comp for looking at how much bitcoin just miners in general have to sell. It's just not that much. Right.
00:18:39.768 - 00:19:20.004, Speaker A: And so 18k BTC is publicly available. Who's going to sell? Well, it's people. Yeah, it's people that, you know, are okay. Maybe they're underwater and they want to exit their positions, or maybe they bought lower and they want to, they want, they want to exit their positions, the people that are underwater. I think basically everybody has sold post FTX. If you were worried about losing on your bitcoin position, or you were worried your stop loss got hit or your stop loss got triggered, or you're panicked about crypto, or you just want to pull cash out and you want to raise your cash balances because the world looks really scary. All that selling has actually already happened.
00:19:20.004 - 00:19:50.096, Speaker A: Who's going to be the new person to panic here or the new person to say, I'm going to get out of this? The marginal seller in my perspective right now are the people that bought lower and are just looking to trade, or it's shorts, right? Because the people that lost faith in crypto, or the people that wanted to raise cash, or the people that panicked out because of FTX, or the people that got their stop losses triggered, or the levered longs, all those guys just got washed out over the last month.
00:19:50.240 - 00:19:50.908, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:51.056 - 00:20:34.656, Speaker A: And so what you need in order to, I think, send bitcoin lower is you need to entice new sellers into the market. And new sellers into the market would come either a, via a black swan event, like a binance or tether going down, or b, because macro goes down in correlation, traders come into the market and push this thing lower. So right now, the only person that I fear are the people that bought fifteen, sixteen k, and they want to take profit. I don't think that that type of buyer bought 15 and sell 18k. They probably bought 15 and sell 21 or 23 or 25 or to hold it for the next cycle. Right? They're not buying substantial amounts of bitcoin to flip from sixteen k to eighteen k. No.
00:20:34.840 - 00:21:27.964, Speaker B: And that universe of people, even if they did decide to buy at, flip at 18k, like they're just not holding that much bitcoin. That group, like in commodities markets, in tradfi, you call them weak hands. They're day traders. They're not holding huge amounts of volume that move the market. But like, you know, the group of people that I was scared of, that I was, I was thinking, gosh, you know, now that we've had this fallout from FTX, what's the next big wall of selling to hit the market? I was worried that bankrupt lenders holding portfolios of coin would just be lambasting bids across the entire market. And, you know, the whole, like FTX, Alameda, and, you know, name your list of bankrupt lenders selling billions of dollars worth of bitcoin. Even what little liquidity is left in the benchmark assets sitting on those balance sheets.
00:21:27.964 - 00:21:43.172, Speaker B: It might not get liquidated for years. They still haven't sold the Mount Gox tokens or unencumbered those. It's just less of a concern than it was. That was the big fear for a lot of people was the bankruptcy proceedings.
00:21:43.288 - 00:21:43.628, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:21:43.636 - 00:21:44.384, Speaker B: What do you think?
00:21:44.964 - 00:22:38.834, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's a big fear for us too, and that's why when you look at, I mean, I don't know what exactly is going on with some of these bankruptcy proceedings, but I know from our internal expertise that they take a long time to play out. It's not an overnight. It's not an overnight liquidation. And also, by the way, a lot of these people, actually, there's just not that much on the balance sheets anymore. You would have great insight into this. I want to hop into it because I know you guys do a lot of OTC, but selling a billion dollars of bitcoin, while it sounds like a lot, isn't that much anymore in the grand scheme of things, because this thing trades a lot. Bitcoin trades a ton.
00:22:38.834 - 00:23:08.390, Speaker A: And so I'm curious, what have you got? I mean, as a firm that does a lot of trading with a lot of different counterparties, what have you seen post FTX in terms of change of market structure or change of the type of person that you're trading with or the behavior of the people that you're trading with? I'm curious what you've seen internally that has changed.
00:23:08.462 - 00:23:35.412, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, thanks for asking. I think it's a super relevant question. I mean, prior to FTX, and we can get into what happened later with FTX, I think a marketplace is comprised of a number of different essential services. Liquidity is a very important service. Custody is another one. Settlement, perhaps the most important service. If you send your yen or your euros off to some entity, you're really hoping to receive your dollars back.
00:23:35.508 - 00:23:35.884, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:35.964 - 00:24:07.060, Speaker B: So whoever you're doing that transaction with, your settlement agent, is very important, then there are all sorts of ancillary services, like providers of leverage, et cetera. Anyway, all of those services were kind of getting consolidated under a very limited number of roofs. You had FTX basically doing all of that. You have binance doing all of that. And at the time, it seemed to run. You can probably provide more insight into this than anybody. You're crypto native, tried and true.
00:24:07.060 - 00:24:45.238, Speaker B: That's against the ethos of crypto and decentralization. Anyway, it was happening. As an OTC liquidity provider, you adapt you go where the volumes are, you start providing liquidity on exchanges, you optimize your latency, you go high tech science it, figure it out as best you can. But then post FTX blowing up, everything changed. We were seeing sort of a decline in the number of counterparties that were interested in self custodying and trading OTC, or using a famous custodian. There are a couple out there, Zappo, Coinbase, and then trading OTC. Most people were just sort of like banking with FTX and doing everything with FTX.
00:24:45.238 - 00:25:11.904, Speaker B: Now the market, instead of going that ultra centralized direction, which is kind of like call it commodity derivatives or equities, it's kind of done a handbrake turn. Now things are starting to look a little bit more like FX, where you have silos of capital, in this case, digital asset capital, all around the world. You have nodes of settlement agents. We're one of them. For example. In the future, there will be more. Perhaps banks will get involved.
00:25:11.904 - 00:26:05.344, Speaker B: And then those other market services, like provision of liquidity, provision of leverage, those are all kind of being provided by leverage. Now, you can get good leverage from Aave, for example, or you can get good liquidity from us. And the providers of settlement in the future will aggregate all of those different market services, white label them and offer them to customers the way that Morgan Stanley offers g ten fx liquidity to people without necessarily providing it themselves. So ultimately, what we've seen on the OTC side, as a liquidity provider, we provide liquidity on exchange and OTC. We've seen a record number of onboardings and counterparty interest in the month of November. As people are looking for new avenues to trade in the wake of FTX, we're seeing basically all of these market services decentralized. We're seeing a big focus on ETH and bitcoin.
00:26:05.344 - 00:26:58.108, Speaker B: After an initial flurry of altcoin liquidation, people just seeking liquidity and bids and solvency in any way they can, and the nature of the counterparties that are onboarding. Surprisingly, institutional FTX really had deep inroads into the institutional space. It wasn't just retail investors who were on that platform, it was big companies. And those companies are now rethinking the way that they trade. FTX was a compelling story, but I think now people really want to diversify their options for crypto liquidity. And the odd thing about all this, just to put a finishing touch on the comment, is the volumes haven't really like crypto market volumes are down, but OTC volumes are up. So OTC at least for now, is a larger slice of a smaller pie.
00:26:58.108 - 00:27:14.592, Speaker B: And let me turn that around to you, Avi. What have you on your side as a proper investor in this space who understands altcoins better than pretty much anybody? Where are you focused on deploying risk now versus before that blow up?
00:27:14.788 - 00:27:47.890, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good question. And the tough part about post FTX is that you have to reevaluate every single counterparty, every single person you trade with, rigorously. You really have to dive into it. Basically, everybody that we trade with now, it's like, okay, let me see your audited financials. Who are you audited by? Are you audited by a. A big four, or are you audited by some random three person company in Idaho? Right. It's like, show me.
00:27:47.890 - 00:28:31.092, Speaker A: Like, show me who's actually looking through books, right? And you ask for their risk parameters, and then you just have discussions about how they manage risk in general, because having those discussions, a lot of the times gives you insight into how seriously people are taking it. If you sit down with somebody and you ask them, hey, what do you think about exchange risk versus protocol risk versus just general market risk? And they have approximately two minutes of content for you. What that tells you is that they haven't thought about it that much.
00:28:31.268 - 00:28:40.254, Speaker B: Help us think about it. What is protocol risk? What is exchange risk? What is counterparty risk in, like, sound bites? Like, how should we be thinking about this?
00:28:40.794 - 00:29:39.978, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's really a holistic thing. I mean, for each. And I won't bore everybody with the details, but for each silo of risk, we have an extensive amount of metrics that we track to make sure that we're not taking too much risk. Right? So, with protocol risk, we have engineers on our team that look at every single protocol, underwrite the code, and basically answer a three page template on everything that we want to know about this protocol and everything that we know we're taking a risk about and grading it on a scale of one to five. And then we set our risk parameters from there. On the counterparty risk side, it's looking at financial statements. We also have a big checklist of all the things that we run through, and we actually have a committee of people, both from tradfi and from crypto, that, now, go sit down.
00:29:39.978 - 00:31:05.324, Speaker A: And every single counterparty that we use as the past, the test of this committee trying to poke holes is, hey, is this going to be an issue? Is that going to be an issue? Is this going to be an issue? Is that going to be an issue. One example of this was we were looking at a trade on compound, deploying some capital onto compound. And one question that came up was, in the event of a collapse of tether or a collapse of binance, I'm not saying these things are going to happen. These are black swan events, super low probability, but let's say that happens. Or in a collapse of maybe even USDC, or a crazy event that none of us have foreseen, how might that impact either pricing on compound? Could crazy liquidations occur? How does oracle interpret smooth out price? If it does, will reserves be there? For example, if we borrow a bunch of assets against USDC, and then we pay back those assets, is there a scenario that has caused a bunch of people to go borrow USDC? So that utilization is super high, and that 40% rate that compound caps out at isn't enough to attract new USDC into the system. And so we can't actually withdraw our USDC because there's none left in the protocol. So it's like, okay, so you start to think through all the different.
00:31:05.324 - 00:31:59.046, Speaker A: All the different parameters and what you need to be thinking about at any given time. We group these things into their own buckets, and we have large checklists and discussions about each type of risk that we're taking. And that's, in hindsight, obviously very important given what happened with FTX, but ongoing, that's still going to be a huge thing, and people need to start paying attention to that. I think it was a very rude awakening for a lot of people to realize that no matter how good of a trader you are, if you're not conscious of these exogenous risks outside of market risk, you can still lose a lot of money in this space. That's it. Because it's pretty. Now that also presents opportunity, right? Yeah, like, it presents opportunity.
00:31:59.046 - 00:32:04.074, Speaker A: And that's why we're here, because there's a tremendous amount of opportunity for people to understand how to navigate.
00:32:04.654 - 00:33:28.214, Speaker B: I mean, you hit the nail on the head, right? Like, risk can sound boring to people who are just sort of dabbling in markets, because it does involve homework and confusion and math and a lot of stuff that's not necessarily categorizable as fun. But at the same time, once you get it out of the way and once you integrate it into your process, like you said, when you're dealing with the exposed wiring of a brand new asset class, tradable in a way, no new asset class has ever been tradable before. There are assets that will 1000 x within that asset class and you can see during bull markets like 2021 how that can change people's entire lives. In terms of just trying to contextualize what that opportunity might look like in the future. I think it'd be pretty important to dig into in the wake of this post FTX hangover. The price action is sort of telling you that you need to differentiate between one centralized crypto company called FTX happening to be something other than what we thought it was, and bitcoin or ethereum processing blocks. Those blockchains work just fine, and they did throughout the entire collapse of that centralized ecosystem.
00:33:28.214 - 00:34:22.194, Speaker B: So I think the point you made earlier about how buoyant prices are against the backdrop of all this misery and bearishness tells you that the kernel of something very important is going on here. And hopefully what we can pick apart on this podcast is what do you buy, what do you invest in, and what do you look for to capture what I assume, both of us probably assume is going to be a the upswing in the coming cycle. And we do believe this is a cycle. We don't think this is a secular decline here on the Cumberland side. One thing that we're looking at is defi primitives. Even though they had their summer in 2020, they're starting to look pretty interesting again, if you're just going to ask yourself, what is a blockchain good for? The entire centralized lending industry just disappeared as a trading house. You need to borrow lots of capital and coin to fill, facilitate the up liquidity that it people need.
00:34:22.194 - 00:35:01.804, Speaker B: And again, even though volumes are down, tens of billions of dollars worth of this stuff are trading all the time. And so this isn't, this isn't a market that telegraph signs of apathy, right? So if we're going to provide that liquidity to the market, we have to figure out where we can go and borrow stuff. And increasingly it's on chain. Back in the day, way back six months ago, it was pretty easy to just go get bitcoin or ETH loan to you stupidly low interest rates from companies that are now bankrupt. That's over. Now you look on chain, you get fantastic liquidity on things like Aave and a couple of other protocols, and it's like, wait a second, this is real. Like, this is real amounts of capital.
00:35:01.804 - 00:35:20.364, Speaker B: Perhaps if, like you said, Avi, if the protocol risk is justifiable and you can analyze it all in the white paper, it's clear as day. You can see it on chain like, if it makes sense, perhaps that's like the next leg of something worthwhile is just defi primitives.
00:35:21.344 - 00:36:16.894, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. And I want to talk a little bit about how I've started thinking about investing, especially post FTX. I think it was Warren Buffett who had that I buy great, great companies at great prices. That's a little bit how I'm thinking about the market right now, which is that you have, finally, a separation between the good and the bad. In crypto in 2021, there was this concept of the hot ball of money. You'd get speculation, move from one protocol to another protocol to another protocol to another protocol, and price would follow where these narratives and where these people were going. But the narratives were, they weren't real.
00:36:16.894 - 00:37:02.006, Speaker A: They were transparent. They were fake, and they were manufactured in many ways because people wanted them to be true, because if it was true, then they could make a lot of money. And you fast forward to today where their l one square and their Defi protocols and their metaverse and gaming companies that are all proving that they're more valuable than others, either through better bd or continued dev adoption or better tech progress. You're actually seeing differentiation in a lot of these. In a lot of these companies. And valuations actually haven't caught up in many cases. So the way that I think about this is really, is really twofold.
00:37:02.006 - 00:38:50.924, Speaker A: What is one? How good, just on an absolute basis, are these companies? What's the addressable market? How big can it get? How valuable is it really? Is it better than the current state of things? Then the other angle is, well, how much is that appreciated right now? Right? And you start to realize that because of the recent collapse in crypto, a lot of valuations have come back down to earth. Right? There are protocols with working products in DeFi at $30 to $60 million valuations, and their venture deal is getting funded at $30 million pre product right now. And you got to scratch your head and say, wait a second, that doesn't. One of these things is wrong. Now, it might be that the venture stuff is just way overvalued, or it might be that there are these liquid products out there that are actually useful, that are just beaten down because the market's beaten down, and because nobody's actually doing the real work to come in and figure out what the real value of these things are. You have this really nice market environment right now where you can be both a long term investor and get in at reasonable valuations for some, there are obviously still a bunch of very overvalued things in crypto, and I think that will persist a lot of them will fail and a lot of them will blow up. But there's also a lot of undervalued stuff in crypto right now and my goal as an investor is to come up with ways to screen and assess that undervaluation.
00:38:50.924 - 00:40:01.060, Speaker A: One of the things that our analysts, our analysts did over the last week which I thought was really useful was going through, they went through the top 300 projects on Coingecko and they basically gave an explanation of what it was. Let me tell you, there are a lot of random projects out there that you've never heard of that are in the top 300 on Coingecko. And out of it came a couple of interesting gems and we were like, oh, we didn't know about this thing before but it actually looks kind of interesting and it actually looks reasonably fairly valued. And so going through this process of especially now instead of looking at all the same stuff that other people are looking at, try to go find the new stuff that's out there, the stuff that's overlooked and put in the work. The thing that's beautiful about this market environment, absolutely beautiful, is that we currently have, in my opinion a lazy trader problem where people aren't putting in the work. Everybody's going on, Christmas is coming up, holidays, end of year, market's depressed. This is the best time to be working 14 hours days looking at random stuff because this is actually great trading.
00:40:01.060 - 00:40:14.292, Speaker A: It's a great trading environment, it's a great investing environment. And I'm not fighting anybody else. Guess what? Nobody's fighting me on this because they're off on vacation right now. Yeah, that's great for me.
00:40:14.468 - 00:41:07.714, Speaker B: Or just sitting on the sidelines. From the liquidity provision perspective, you see in terms of counterparties that we trade with, if you're an allocator and you're in charge of deploying capital into crypto, crude oil, stocks, bonds, everything else, you're kind of going to get fired if you go and launch a bunch of your investors money into crypto right now and lose 40% of it. Meanwhile, you're not going to get fired if the thing three X is from here and you pile in at the same time as all your peers do, because then it's kind of justifiable. That's the game theory of passive investment management in many cases. And so nobody's proactively knife catching at this point. There have been several knife catch acts of heroism by various people and institutions over the course of this year. And I think at these lows a lot of them have been burned.
00:41:07.714 - 00:42:05.950, Speaker B: So I think they're on the sidelines. And like you said, avi, there are some real gems. I mean, we do a version of what you were talking about. We haven't gone through the coins on Coingecko that we aren't invested in, but sometimes we just review the ones that we are invested in. We look at them and review and say, why did we do this? Why are we invested? What are the sort of key performance indicators, the KPI's, that we're looking for in terms of metrics of success that we expect to drive the appreciation of this token according to tokenomics that we've theoretically looked through. And if you do that review, which is a version of what you were specifically describing, avi, like on your portfolio, you can do this as a retail investor, even if the only thing you hold is bitcoin, you should just think this through. Like if you do it once a month, often, it's, it's kind of evident that you should either be adding a whole lot of risk to your, your crypto position or perhaps reducing or cutting it entirely.
00:42:05.950 - 00:42:17.286, Speaker B: And, you know, I really like that framework. I think I might have picked it up from one of your podcasts a long time ago. But it works. It works just like, what is this coin? Why do I want to own it?
00:42:17.350 - 00:42:59.388, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think the mistake that a lot of people make is they, they associate KPI with fundamentals, and this is just something that you should do with any trade. A lot of the times we'll be trading off of just data. Let's say we find a coin trading at 200% annualized, negative funding rate, open interest has gone forex. People are shorting it and they're just aggressively offsides. We look at this and we go, okay, this is a candidate for a short squeeze. Okay, let me pull up my parameters for what makes, what makes a good short squeeze, right? Are they shorting because of an event? Are they shorting because they're just shorting? Are they, you know, where.
00:42:59.388 - 00:43:58.794, Speaker A: Where are the shorts? Where are the shorts coming in? What's the average entry price? What's the average entry price of the shorts? And then, you know, you start to, you start to construct a plan, right? You start to say, okay, so if I know that the let's asset a, the average entry price of a short is $10, it's trading at eight right? Now, I know that it's 200% annualized, but it normally trades at, let's say, negative 10% annualized, because that's just how things have been trading recently. And I know that this much open interest is added, then I can start to construct a plan, a trade plan. I say once it hits ten, there's probably going to be a little bit of a squeeze and the shorts are going to exit. Once funding rate comes in. Let's say I'm being conservative. If it goes in below 50%, 40% annualized to short, I'm going to take off some of the trade, I'm going to take off 25, 30%. If it goes below 25% annualized, I'll take off 75%.
00:43:58.794 - 00:44:22.702, Speaker A: If open interest decreases by 50%, I'll take off 50%. Now you start to have almost a system for trading these things. Yeah. So when you hear the word KPI, because I know a lot of, a lot of people, a lot of people will hear that and they'll go, okay, well, what does that mean? I say, well, it just means a plan. Just have a plan. Like, take your. Take whatever data you're using, take whatever information.
00:44:22.702 - 00:44:51.384, Speaker A: And you apply this to the fundamentals too, right? Maybe you're betting on Matic and you're saying, I think that Starbucks is going to drive a ton of usage to matic. Okay, monitoring. Yeah. Take a look. Set up a system to actually make sure that your thesis is playing. I think one of the funniest things about crypto, and this happens to me all the time, jonah, you'll have a thesis, you'll establish a position. It'll work fantastically.
00:44:51.384 - 00:44:54.364, Speaker A: And it'll have been absolutely not because of your thesis at all.
00:44:55.904 - 00:45:04.844, Speaker B: It's nice to hear that those things work out for you. Usually on our side, they don't, but nice to hear that you're hitting that single.
00:45:06.624 - 00:45:07.720, Speaker A: Sometimes they do, sometimes.
00:45:07.752 - 00:45:40.172, Speaker B: I mean, one thing you mentioned just now that's super interesting, though, is like, the process is so important. And like, one thing you mentioned as part of this, like, kind of mock process, is the funding rate to getting short crypto. Like, you were talking about a short squeeze scenario. Shorting crypto, especially shorting altcoins, has never been more expensive than it is today. There are no lenders left except the ones on chain, for all intents and purposes, with maybe one or two exceptions, if you're very institutional. So, like Matic, you brought it up. You want to get short that thing.
00:45:40.172 - 00:46:21.382, Speaker B: You are paying through the ears to bet that that's going down. And do you really want to do that with crypto? You know, 60, 70, 80, 90% off the all time highs, with the fed about to pivot, with narratives starting to. To pop up that are looking a little bit bullish. And one particularly interesting thing is, in the wake of this binance scare, assets are getting yanked off exchanges like crazy. Nobody wants to leave their money on an exchange anymore. Even the slightest bit of crypto, Twitter fear, people just pull hundreds of millions, billions of dollars off these exchanges. What does that mean? That means there's less crypto available for sale at any given time.
00:46:21.382 - 00:46:26.118, Speaker B: So it's almost a bullish technical that really contradicts the bearish narrative.
00:46:26.166 - 00:46:26.398, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:26.446 - 00:46:47.806, Speaker B: So if you've identified, like Avi said, like one of these candidates for a short squeeze and all this is playing, playing out in the backdrop, probably a pretty good time to get. To get long and play for Avi, I think you tweeted the God candle. That's, you know, certainly it's not something.
00:46:47.990 - 00:47:05.810, Speaker A: It'S a bit of. A. Bit of a, bit of a meme from the past. But basically, I just. I just keep seeing all these people shorting the market and I keep seeing all these people being bearish in the market, and price isn't going down, and you just have to take your ego and throw it out the window. Just listen to what the market's telling you.
00:47:06.002 - 00:47:52.824, Speaker B: When I was an oil trader in 2020, people were saying, in 2020, no one's ever going to use crude oil again. Sure, it went negative. That's really scary. It's really just one little benchmark at one particular place in Cushing, Oklahoma, that went negative. The rest of the world's crude oil was pretty positive at the time, but you heard these narratives like, it's over, no one's going to burn petroleum anymore. Obviously, bitcoin now and crypto at large is where crude oil was 100 years ago. But I think it's an important lateral to make because if there's any other asset class that represents liquid, tradable, early stage technology, it's commodities.
00:47:52.824 - 00:48:39.440, Speaker B: And I think the fear and euphoria cycles there kind of mimic those in crypto. And we're certainly at a point where people are once again calling it crypto, kind of a useless asset class scam. No use case. But avi, as you said, like Matic, Starbucks, what's going to make you believe in crypto if not Polygon raking companies with billions of users into this space? Metamask has 30 million users. That's got to be the biggest app in crypto right now. And then Polygon suddenly just lands. Instagram, Reddit, Starbucks, Nike, what's going on there? Should we be focused on FTX being a big deal or that being a big deal.
00:48:39.440 - 00:48:40.324, Speaker B: What do you think?
00:48:41.584 - 00:49:12.564, Speaker A: I'm with you. I think this has been sort of sad ad nauseam at this point, but FTX is not crypto. FTX was just a player in crypto, and crypto is here to stay. And that's almost like it's a cop out for people to get out of the space. It just doesn't make any sense. When Lehman went down, yeah, sure, there were people calling for the end of the, the whole banking system, but was that true? No.
00:49:13.824 - 00:49:18.888, Speaker B: I worked there again as the old man in the room, having been everywhere. Got to get to claim that one.
00:49:18.936 - 00:49:19.136, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:19.160 - 00:49:21.640, Speaker B: People were talking about a resource war back then.
00:49:21.832 - 00:49:22.696, Speaker A: You worked at Lehman?
00:49:22.760 - 00:49:24.168, Speaker B: I did, I did.
00:49:24.296 - 00:49:25.576, Speaker A: Were you there when it collapsed?
00:49:25.680 - 00:49:37.984, Speaker B: That's right, I was. I started as a first year analyst in the credit default swaps trading department at Lehman Brothers in 2007. And, you know, that was like, considered a good job at the time.
00:49:38.024 - 00:49:46.640, Speaker A: Are you kidding? No, I'm not. That was my, you were in CDs in 2000. You joined Lehman and did CDs in 2007. Yeah.
00:49:46.672 - 00:50:04.910, Speaker B: My mom is super disappointed in me. Everything, it gets worse from there. Then crude oil and now this. Like, you know, that was crazy. I mean, the thing literally blew up. You know, we, the CEO said, everybody's fine, like, the company's liquid. I sat on the credit desk.
00:50:04.910 - 00:51:06.334, Speaker B: So obviously, the guy who traded corporate financial bonds like JP Morgan and Lehman, of course, and Morgan Stanley and Goldman, he was down the road, busy bidding Lehman debt to try and support the price of it, to make the company seem more credit worthy to external investors who the CEO and his cronies were hoping would bail it out. And then Lehman ran out of cash, the bonds tanked and then spiraled into bankruptcy pretty quickly. And then shortly thereafter, I got, like, an email from Barclays Capital which bought Lehman's businesses out of bankruptcy, sort of like CZ almost did with FTX before he backed out, where it's like, you get an email that says, dear Lehman employee, if you would like a 90 day conditional employment offer that can be terminated at will at any time from Barclays Capital, please reply with accept in the subject line. Otherwise, please reply with reject or deny. I forget. And, yeah, that was my career at that point. That stunk.
00:51:06.334 - 00:51:34.726, Speaker B: But, yeah, people were talking about a resource war. They were like, okay, well, the banking system's gone, so you're going to hoard physical gold, buy some land with fresh water. The distressed credit guys were all over that stuff. Golden tree was probably crushing it. And honestly, it was a weird time. But usually when something like that plays out in any given market or oil going negative in 2020, you're thrilled. Three to six, maybe nine months from the dead ball lows at worst.
00:51:34.726 - 00:52:05.374, Speaker B: Or you've already seen them. Like, how, you know it can always get worse, of course. But like you said at the beginning of this podcast, Avi, like, prices are holding in right now, and the bottom just fell out there. Like, if you're a tradfi participant in crypto, if you just joined crypto, like I did at the euphoric highs in Q 421, and you're looking at this like, how do I justify this career to my family? I think the takeaway here is.
00:52:07.474 - 00:52:07.922, Speaker A: It'S.
00:52:07.978 - 00:52:36.352, Speaker B: Scary, but it's just another market. This is not some new thing that's going to zero. It's just another market cycle. And we've seen so many of these before, it almost feels benign compared to the Lehman one, where the whole financial system was about to collapse. Except this time in crypto, you don't have a digital Tim Geithner to bail everybody out. You don't have, in 2020, a digital OPEC to cut supply and pump prices back up. Econ 101 is just going to play out like it did in your college textbook.
00:52:36.352 - 00:52:58.664, Speaker B: And like you said, if you do the analysis, you understand the white papers, the protocols and the credit risk, and the counterparty risk involves, it starts to become predictable. And if you and I are both bullish, and we both do our homework independently, you know, perhaps there's a threat of bullishness out there with a bit of, you know, basis in reality, I would hope.
00:52:59.004 - 00:53:16.268, Speaker A: You know, I think. I think that's a. That's a beautiful way to end this, which is that everything old is new and everything new is old. And Jonah, as the old man in the room, has seen it all. So I think that was, you know, really, really, really had a good time. What do they say, avi?
00:53:16.316 - 00:53:20.222, Speaker B: Five years in crypto is one year in normal life. And you've been in crypto how long?
00:53:20.308 - 00:53:24.414, Speaker A: No, it's one year in crypto is five years of normal life. It's dog years.
00:53:24.754 - 00:53:27.690, Speaker B: Ah, shit. It's my old brain. Just, you know.
00:53:27.722 - 00:53:33.274, Speaker A: Anyway, I've been in crypto for, I guess, six years now. Wow. It's been a while.
00:53:33.354 - 00:53:36.554, Speaker B: So that's 30 years. You're a 30 year veteran of this stuff.
00:53:36.674 - 00:53:55.334, Speaker A: But anyway, this is a great, a great, great time chatting with you, Jonah. I think we covered. We covered most of the topics on the next. On the next podcast. We're going to have a. We're going to have a pretty special guest, but I'm super excited for you guys to meet. He hasn't done many media appearances, but he runs one of the most successful trading firms in the world.
00:53:55.334 - 00:54:04.194, Speaker A: And I think if you think hard enough, you might be able to guess who it is. I'll give you a hint. One of the trading firms is where we work.
00:54:04.574 - 00:54:13.174, Speaker B: Great talking to everybody. And as always, none of this is investment advice. Crypto is risky. Be careful out there. Great talking to you, Avi.
