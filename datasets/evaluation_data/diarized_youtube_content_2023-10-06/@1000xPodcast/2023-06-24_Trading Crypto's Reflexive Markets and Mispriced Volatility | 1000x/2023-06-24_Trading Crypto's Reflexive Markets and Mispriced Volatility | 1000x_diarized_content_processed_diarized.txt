00:00:00.160 - 00:00:09.230, Speaker A: There's a book behind me right now called the Alchemy of Finance by George Soros. And basically, I can sum up the book in one word, which is everything is reflexive.
00:00:09.342 - 00:00:11.310, Speaker B: It didn't sound like one word, Avi.
00:00:11.502 - 00:00:36.828, Speaker A: Two words. Everything. Reflexivity, one word. Welcome back to another episode of the Thousand X podcast. We are excited to have you. We are recording this at the exact same moment that bitcoin has decided to send. We are trading 29 eight.
00:00:36.828 - 00:01:09.902, Speaker A: And both Jonah and I are extremely happy right now, and I hope you guys are, too. There's a lot to talk about on today's podcast. A lot has happened in the markets, and there are a lot of opportunities that have presented themselves. And I think the last two weeks since our Novogratz podcast, we've done a pretty good job at navigating the turn, and so happy to talk to you about what's happened and what we think is going to happen over the next few weeks. So, without further ado, let's dive in. Jonah, how's it been? Where are you right now?
00:01:10.078 - 00:01:11.766, Speaker B: I'm in France. Hello from France.
00:01:11.830 - 00:01:13.974, Speaker A: Bonjour. Sorry to hear.
00:01:14.014 - 00:01:33.770, Speaker B: Broadcasting live from a crappy laptop with some trees in the background. The price of bitcoin is the same here in France. Almost 30,000, but a little farther away in euros. I hope we hit 30k in the middle of the podcast, which seems possible. We're flirting with it.
00:01:33.842 - 00:01:40.874, Speaker A: If we had 30k in the middle of the podcast, I think we should do just a little toast, and then we should sell everything that we own.
00:01:41.034 - 00:01:44.570, Speaker B: Yeah, this has been the moment.
00:01:44.602 - 00:01:47.934, Speaker A: You toast a price, I think you just got to get out.
00:01:48.334 - 00:01:48.966, Speaker B: It's over.
00:01:49.030 - 00:01:49.230, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:49.262 - 00:02:21.440, Speaker B: I mean, this is an emotional rollercoaster. Two weeks ago, we were talking to Novogratz. We asked him, hey, why did you start a company instead of just holding length in your pa? And he was like, oh, great question. It's stressful times for people who run crypto businesses right now, but the sentiment can shift quickly. Two weeks ago, it was all about the sec dropping lawsuits on Coinbase and Binance. It looked like we were primed for a washout. Lower.
00:02:21.440 - 00:02:28.560, Speaker B: Avi, what did the short interest look like at that time?
00:02:28.712 - 00:02:35.248, Speaker A: At the lows, before we squeezed higher, we were looking at more than a billion dollars of shorts that had opened.
00:02:35.296 - 00:02:35.936, Speaker B: Billion?
00:02:36.120 - 00:03:35.450, Speaker A: Yeah, a billion of shorts that opened on the USDT contracts. And that's actually what, if you remember, on the last podcast with Novo, we were both talking about lifting August and September calls on BTC. When you evolve below 40 and you have a billion dollars of shorts that have entered the market. That is recipe for disaster for those shorts and recipe for volatility. I think that volume is actually still really low. One of the things that I like to remind people is that volume is often the most mispriced post a large move. So you can make an argument that volume is more mispriced now at 50 than it was at 40 when we were at the lows, because we've already seen such a large move in 30k is very likely to be, is much more likely than twenty five k to be an unstable price.
00:03:35.450 - 00:04:01.594, Speaker A: Right. Much more common for bitcoin to oscillate wildly after it's already oscillated wildly than for it to begin to oscillate wildly. And so you can make a case that volume here actually makes sense. I mean, one thing that I was looking at is if you want to take off some length, you could sell deltas, but you can also start buying some puts because puts are still pretty cheap. I mean, if you want to bet.
00:04:01.634 - 00:04:04.494, Speaker B: Could sell call spreads too. Roll your strikes up.
00:04:05.434 - 00:04:21.854, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. Could sell call spreads. Although actually, I hadn't looked at that, but that actually looks really nice because it looks like we've got some points on the spread now, whereas before, the surface is pretty flat.
00:04:22.394 - 00:05:17.008, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think what's interesting here, you brought up a really good point about options, and I was an options specialist for over a decade. That's, that was the, the primary way that I expressed views, and I really dug deep into it. You, you made a very insightful point, which I agree with, which is options are often the most mispriced after large moves. And the way that they get mispriced is something that's kind of worth delving into, because what you just described, where volume still seems a bit too low, um, often it's the other way you get a big move and volume explodes and then it's just a screaming sale. Right? Uh, like for example, the big trade in commodities this year has been to sell overpriced options, which exploded after last year's craziness across gas, oil, a bunch of other markets. So volume remained overvalued for far too long. And that's usually what happens after there's excitement in a market, after, in a paradigm of, oh my God, it's a super cycle.
00:05:17.008 - 00:05:35.324, Speaker B: Wait, no it's not. Or, wow, this thing's going to zero. Oh, wait, no it's not. It's just going to mean revert again, that's. Those are, those are when, you know, when you have eyeballs on an asset class, volume remains too high for too long after a big move. Meanwhile, in crypto, I think people just threw in the towel. The market stopped moving.
00:05:35.324 - 00:06:16.514, Speaker B: And I think a lot of institutional players who are more savvy at valuing options than perhaps your average retail investor, because options are complicated, and it's not math they teach you in high school, the opposite happened. You had some huge opportunities, some huge moves, some. Lots of coiled springs in the market, and yet the cheapest volatility ever implied volatility ever, which you could go and buy. As a wise trader once told me, you never buy options unless you expect the market to move fast. Sounds so obvious, but a lot of people miss it. And markets move fast when you get a short squeeze. Seems like that's what happened.
00:06:16.674 - 00:06:51.298, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%. I think that's really what you're looking for when. I mean, really, there are two things that I look for when I'm buying, when I'm buying these types of buying, these types of calls. One is I'm just looking for why I think, well, you have to always frame with every trade, but it's. It's sometimes very, very straightforward with options as why I think it's mispriced. Like, why do I think I have. Why do I think I have edge here? And specifically with this most recent boutique, it was because there's a natural supply of sellers in the options market.
00:06:51.298 - 00:07:44.464, Speaker A: And who's selling? Right, the miners. It's people looking for yield on their bitcoin, people that run. There are these billion dollar structured products out there, and we've talked about all this, so I don't necessarily need to rehash it in depth, but there's a natural supply. And so when the bid side dries up, when there are no institutional funds in, and when there are no. When there's no retail coming in to cross across the spread, you just get this volume depression, and then when you see just an insane amount of shorts in the market, you kind of, you kind of have to start lifting. I mean, it is funny, I think that six out of six times, and I can, I might tweet out a graph with this, one of my analysts put it together within 48 to 72 hours of FUD. We've generally seen the bottom in terms of actual price on bitcoin and ethereum.
00:07:44.464 - 00:08:37.156, Speaker A: And I think what's been happening is that there seems to be some leakage of news and you get this weird movement in the markets prior to the actual headlines dropping, where stuff just starts to trade really weirdly. And I think five or six times this year, I've turned to Joe, my partner, and I've said, the market's trading like there's news coming out. And then within two days, news has come out. It's very odd trading dynamic. And then, so what ends up happening is then very quickly, a lot of it gets priced in, because the only people left in this market that are actually trading are people that pay attention to these types of headlines, and that generally provides a good opportunity to come in and actually buy. And so it's, it's been a pretty high hit rate.
00:08:37.220 - 00:09:23.208, Speaker B: I had kind of a different take on that from you. Um, I, I came to the same conclusion, but a very different way. I mean, I do not, unlike you, I do not have a good track record of buying FuD. Um, because often Fud, at least, you know, again, I'm, I'm newer to this market, so the definition of FuD is weird for me. Um, no one uses that term in other markets. And furthermore, what constitutes fud? What constitutes fear, uncertainty, and doubt? Like, I don't have a historical reference point in my mind from having traded this asset class for so long. Like, you have to know whether something's, like, officially the point where most people are throwing in the towel, or whether it's the beginning of this cascade of negative headlines and sentiment, us souring, that's just going to continue and send the price lower and lower.
00:09:23.208 - 00:10:23.274, Speaker B: Um, for me, what signaled some confidence while we were trading on the lows, and I'm not going to go and pretend that I did anything particularly heroic, but what signaled confidence is that when the SEC dropped these final two lawsuits against Coinbase and finance, two very well resourced institutions that can afford to fight, they're not just going to fold their hands. Just having had a little bit of legal experience in my own past from having been involved in a lawsuit or two, usually when the plaintiff files a lawsuit, this has nothing to do with the SEC. When the plaintiff files a lawsuit, that's their moment of maximum momentum. They've gone and stated all of their claims. They've laid their case out the way that they want it to be viewed. No defense has been formed. The defendant is often caught off guard, and it's really just from a textbook law school theoretical perspective, that is max momentum.
00:10:23.274 - 00:10:31.918, Speaker B: It couldn't get any, the momentum couldn't have been further against crypto than it was at that particular point.
00:10:32.046 - 00:11:12.082, Speaker A: Preston, I think that's a really solid way of framing it, and I think that's accurate. I think the way that I would add on to that to frame it for myself is when you have an action that is somewhat that effectively. So with Operation Chokepoint, let me walk this back. With Operation Chokepoint, which was the SEC coming after altcoins, there was no event as much as there was this ongoing drip of attack. It's like, okay, we might just continue to see actions by the SEC against a variety of null coins. We don't know when that's going to end. It might last for a year, it might last for six months.
00:11:12.082 - 00:11:49.590, Speaker A: It might last for three months. With the SEC lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase, that was very much so. An event, right? It was very much so. Hey, here is this thing, this very concrete lawsuit that, I mean, if they've sued binance and they've sued Coinbase, it doesn't really matter who they sue next. Those are the two largest exchanges in existence right now. I mean, maybe they can sue a Huobi or OKX, but that's going to be baked into price, right? Less to your point is every action beyond that is less meaningful because they've sort of played their hand. Okay, we're going after the largest exchange offshore.
00:11:49.590 - 00:12:27.132, Speaker A: We're going after the largest exchange on short. So then you start to think, okay, well, how could it get worse? There are a few things that could have made it worse. For example, the DOJ could still come out against binance, but I actually think that at this point, thats almost baked into price. If I see some actionable, something actionable. Now, im not saying necessarily do this, but this is how I would think about it, is if a headline comes out that CZ is being perp walked, that probably is a three to 6% sell off. And I actually think that thats almost baked in. People know that that is a potential.
00:12:27.188 - 00:13:11.704, Speaker B: I think the worry, like if you read Twitter, the worry about the DOJ is that, let's say they come after binance and say you have done something wrong. They, in theory, have the power to freeze omnibus wallets. They can say, this binance wallet has conducted activity that we don't like. We're going to freeze it while we do our investigation. Again, this is not my view. It's just, you read Twitter, you get these sorts of ideas in your head. If customer assets were to be frozen temporarily, this wouldn't be an SBF situation where assets are gone.
00:13:11.704 - 00:14:06.616, Speaker B: This is more like, hey, a government agency has temporarily halted activity in a certain wallet and customers can't access their funds or their frozen firm a day or a week, then liquidity in the system gets gunked up. Its very difficult for institutional trading to take place and you could see some pretty terrifying price movements. So I think that the prospect of that is maybe a reason why if youre long gamma and youve just ridden it up to 30k from 25k bitcoin and youre feeling pretty good about yourself, maybe thats the a reason to lighten up on some deltas. But I mean, who knows? This is just pure idea generation trader talk. What could go wrong? Avi and I are just sitting here for the listeners, just sort of wargaming ideas about what could go wrong, what could go right. We have no idea. So these probability analyses are pretty.
00:14:06.680 - 00:14:07.724, Speaker A: Speak for yourself.
00:14:10.564 - 00:14:11.464, Speaker B: Yeah, fair.
00:14:12.244 - 00:14:17.836, Speaker A: My whole job is to have an idea, Jonah. I never said it's a good idea, but I do have some ideas.
00:14:18.020 - 00:14:22.692, Speaker B: Maybe we should do what Don Wilson said and model out the probability distributions of worst case.
00:14:22.748 - 00:14:49.310, Speaker A: Let me say you're supposed to do everything in trading, everything's a probability at the end of the day, and then you start to calculate the ev from the probability and then you make decisions and your best outcome. That's one of the reasons why I think we were both so heavily involved in this recent GBTC run up is because it was the most post blackrock filing. It just made the most sense.
00:14:49.422 - 00:14:49.670, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:49.702 - 00:15:53.394, Speaker A: I mean, if you're going to bet, one of the most important things that you can do when you have a trade in your mind, or when you have an idea in your mind, is how do you best construct that trade. So you might say that oil is going up, or you might think that copper is going up, or you might think that bitcoins going up, and then you think of the reasons why it might be going up, and then you think of the best way to construct that trade. So, with the grayscale. Sorry, with the blackrock filing, the bet was that bitcoin has probably reached a point where its out of sellers in the short term because of the. Everybody that's exited on binance and Coinbase has probably exited by now, and that a lot of buyers might come in because of this prospect of a ETF filing. And so what do you think is going to benefit the most from that? Well, there's this great instrument, GBTC, that, if turned into an ETF, was currently trading at a 40% discount, which I think is.
00:15:55.134 - 00:15:56.554, Speaker B: 3% discount.
00:15:57.074 - 00:16:01.682, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a. Yeah, I see 30, 32, 33%, 33% yeah.
00:16:01.698 - 00:16:21.818, Speaker B: And a seven. If the price of bitcoin doesn't move, a 7% rally in the discount from 40% to 33% is the equivalent of. What is it? I can't do this math, but, like, 18% rally in the underlying asset like it's meaningful. You get this. This is a positively convex asset. It's an option. It's just like an option.
00:16:21.818 - 00:16:31.832, Speaker B: You pay a premium, which is that 2% management fee, and then in return for that, you get something that sort of. Yeah, and the discount was at a.
00:16:31.848 - 00:17:05.074, Speaker A: 40% discount, just going to par with no price. Movement from bitcoin means you get a 60, I think, 65, 66% return. So it was just such a great. It was just such a great trade because you know why people are buying. And so when you construct the trade, you think to yourself, all right, I want to be bullish on bitcoin. I think the crypto market's going up. What is my highest conviction trade here? Well, GBTC seemed like a great one, because after we did talk about this.
00:17:05.114 - 00:17:13.774, Speaker B: By the way, we did talk about it on the podcast. This isn't us just looking back and saying, we bought this one after it rallied. We actually.
00:17:14.594 - 00:18:18.146, Speaker A: I think I've talked about GBT on every single podcast that I'm on because I just think it's such an obvious trade at some point, especially when it got to 40, 45, 50. It was just such an interesting thing to have in the book. I think ethy is at a 46% discount right now. That one's a lot tougher for me, mainly because the bet is effectively on the SEC approving ETF. I just think that there's a much lower probability of it getting approved as an ETF than bitcoin because of all the concerns around it being a security and whatnot. And realistically, I'm no legal expert, but I can read body language, and the body language of the SEC is that they don't really believe that anything is. Is other than BTC is safe, you know, and I think they pretty much explicitly, explicitly said that.
00:18:18.146 - 00:18:38.840, Speaker A: And Gensler has said that multiple times. Obviously, there's going to be a jurisdictional battle over this because the CFTC has said some things and the SEC has said some things. But anyway, all of that to say GBTC was more attractive than Ethi because of those. Because of those reasons. And the move, I think, has reflected that.
00:18:38.962 - 00:19:45.764, Speaker B: I think in GBTC, you will get the discount selling off again at some point. And the reason why is DCG, we don't know if the managers of DCG are economically rational, and that's the only thing that they care about, or whether they also have reputational things they want to uphold, or other sort of incentives in there. Other stakeholders, if theyre purely economically rational in theory, the textbook says they should just do nothing, because basically the net asset value of that fund is determined by the number of bitcoins that are held inside of it. All of that was created when GBTC traded at a premium back in 2021 and before now, whatever the price of GBTC does, it doesnt change the amount of fees that that grayscale collects. It's really just the price of bitcoin going up and down that alters their fee. They collect 2% of the bitcoin held in the fund every year from their perspective. Okay, Blackrock's filing for an ETF.
00:19:45.764 - 00:20:37.146, Speaker B: Maybe they should feel like they're supposed to compete, but they don't really have to. Even if the price of GBTC gets fire sold down to a discount of -90% technically they're still collecting those same fees. And then if that happens, because everybody's sick of waiting for grayscale to apply for an ETF, and they just sell all their GBTC into a vacuum and rotate into the BlackRock instrument, which is much better. Theoretically, if it gets approved, then Grayscale could go and buy their own shares back at a massive discount and then convert to an ETF or redeem or offer redemptions and earn 20 years worth of. 20 years worth of fees in one fell swoop. I mean, that would be a scummy thing to do to your investors. But if you're just purely economically rational, that might actually make sense to do that.
00:20:37.146 - 00:20:39.414, Speaker B: So I think there is some risk to the downside there.
00:20:39.834 - 00:20:48.354, Speaker A: Yeah. Yes, I think you'd have to. I think they'd open themselves up to a tremendous amount of class action lawsuits. Yeah, I think so. I don't know.
00:20:48.394 - 00:20:51.082, Speaker B: But I'm not a lawyer. I don't know whether maybe this is watertight.
00:20:51.138 - 00:21:13.210, Speaker A: Who knows, by the way, I mean, you're right. That's 100% correct. That would be if there were no legal risk or reputational risk. My bet is that that probability is extremely low because they're trying, they're trying to build a business and have a long term business as opposed to a short term, you know, as opposed to generating a lot of cash in the, in the short term.
00:21:13.322 - 00:21:18.614, Speaker B: Nobody's doubting that. If they care about their reputation and they want to build a business, they shouldn't do that.
00:21:18.954 - 00:21:38.120, Speaker A: It's an interesting thought experiment. I just think it's highly unlikely, and especially because they've come out there and said so many times that they're attempting to get. They're attempting to transform this into an ETF. That being said, a lot of people have done a lot of worse things in crypto also.
00:21:38.232 - 00:22:04.670, Speaker B: Agreed. Let's look at the flip side. Let's say you're managing GBTC and Blackrock comes out with a product that's infinitely superior. No matter how hard you try to please your investors, they're still going to sell GBTC and rotate into the Blackrock one. Let's say they offer redemptions. The golden goose is dead. GBTC is going to get redeemed and the assets are going to get rotated into something more.
00:22:04.822 - 00:23:04.786, Speaker A: Well, I think we're also underestimating the laziness of your average investor in this product. I think that there's probably a substantial amount of money that stays in that ETF. And because it's the largest and because it's the oldest, it might actually end up. And because it already has a ton of volume associated with it, it may actually just end up being the main ETF. And then that opens up maybe the assets actually ten x. I mean, one of the nice things about the Blackrock filing is that it gives an air of legitimacy to the asset class and to bitcoin and to bitcoin specifically. And the other thing is that if Blackrock is filing for foreign ETF, they probably have a reasonable understanding of the probability that that ETF is going to get approved, which I would place at fairly high considering that there's a decent economic cost to going after and producing the CTF.
00:23:04.786 - 00:23:48.418, Speaker A: And then once it's approved, the way that Blackrock works is that they incentivize their advisors to go sell their products. And so we're going to have a lot of people trying to sell a bitcoin ETF for BlackRock from a top line cost, from a monetary cost. I don't think it's particularly expensive. I think it's more from the why would they go through all the effort to go out there and try to get this thing approved? I think from a reputational standpoint, they've got a pretty good track record at getting ETF's, ETF's approved. I don't think it looks particularly great. If they try to get a bitcoin ETF approved, the SEC comes out and says, well, actually the bitcoin markets are manipulated. And then people look at BlackRock and they were, you trying to get us into a product that's manipulated.
00:23:48.418 - 00:23:49.210, Speaker A: It just doesn't.
00:23:49.242 - 00:23:49.658, Speaker B: Yeah, I see.
00:23:49.706 - 00:24:43.952, Speaker A: You know, it just doesn't. More, more expensive from a reputational standpoint than from a monetary standpoint. I also think that's a good point. I also think that it's highly likely that a lot of these problems have been, are in the process of being so a portion of the filing had an entire, there was an entire section dedicated to market surveillance. And every time that the SEC has rejected a bitcoin ETF, it has been because they have claimed that the markets are manipulated. I think that the SEC coming after Coinbase and Binance is going to help out tremendously on this point of getting an ETF passed because there's going to be more regulatory oversight around exchanges. And second, BlackRock is introducing some market surveillance for bitcoin, and that should help with respect to perceived manipulation in the markets.
00:24:43.952 - 00:24:52.512, Speaker A: I think the last point can't be understated. People are, once this thing is approved, there are going to be a lot of people out there whose job it.
00:24:52.528 - 00:24:53.084, Speaker B: Is.
00:24:55.224 - 00:25:55.574, Speaker A: Now to sell bitcoin, a bitcoin ETF who probably historically have not really cared that much about bitcoin. It's just access to a lot of capital. Which is why I think that if you're here, I look at long dated wingy options as a very, very good trade right now because it's possible that, it's possible that what ends up happening is that once it gets approved, you get a stampede into the aztec class. Now, I think that from a trader's perspective, I'm a seller of ETH BTC up until the moment the ETF is approved. And then I'm probably lifting as much ETH BTC as I possibly can in the book. I think that ETH is under a lot of pressure right now because it's lost the narrative, but that'll shift at some point. I'm looking at 0.5
00:25:55.574 - 00:25:58.994, Speaker A: to 0.55 as a level to start scooping up ETH for the long term.
00:25:59.554 - 00:26:33.684, Speaker B: Interesting. That's a good way of thinking about it. I think obviously it's exciting, the prospect of having registered investment advisors and institutional Blackrock people going and selling the idea of bitcoin as a portfolio hedge and a diversification holding. To me, I think what's more interesting about it, the most interesting from the long side is let's say you're an institution right now. What are your options to get long bitcoin? Lets say that youre listening to 1000 x podcast. Youre bullish crypto youre bullish.
00:26:33.724 - 00:26:34.084, Speaker A: Bitcoin?
00:26:34.124 - 00:27:02.984, Speaker B: Really? You dont care about alts. What do you buy? You can buy spot. Thats not capital efficient. If you want to buy a million dollars worth of bitcoin you have to spend a million dollars and park it somewhere. Commodity futures, interest rate futures dont work like that. Its much more capital efficient. You go and buy some bitcoin futures, they trade 50 to 100 basis points over spot during rallies and then they just converge back down.
00:27:02.984 - 00:27:49.938, Speaker B: So you just keep having this negative roll down that eats up all of your capital efficiency and then some in certain circumstances. If you're a us domestic finance company or a London finance company, maybe you aren't necessarily comfortable trading perps on binance. Theres GBTC which is this weird thing that is a little bit hard to understand. The discount is super volatile and youre not exactly sure what grayscale like, how much they care about their stakeholders and how much they care about fee collection. You dont know whether theyll convert to an ETF and do good faith efforts or not. Even if you assume the best, you have to prepare for the worst or bake in a probability of the worst. Theres just not a lot of good ways to get long bitcoin in 2023, which is crazy.
00:27:49.938 - 00:28:02.278, Speaker B: A blackrock ETF would be like the gold standard of getting long bitcoin. And you could do it in a very capital efficient portfolio margin way with the rest of your ETF's.
00:28:02.406 - 00:28:18.474, Speaker A: Well, you know what we haven't been talking about at all on this podcast? We haven't been talking about alts. Zero zero talk about. Because I'm still under the impression that it's just going to be such a dead period for alts.
00:28:18.874 - 00:28:28.546, Speaker B: How many, how many, how many apps supposed to buy? Fud. It's just been if you chart any major alt like Polkadot, Algorand, Cardano, all.
00:28:28.570 - 00:28:35.454, Speaker A: These major did you genuinely just lead off with Polkadot? Any mate? Did you actually just do that, jonah?
00:28:36.154 - 00:28:49.534, Speaker B: Polkadot is I have looked at the charts and yes I did. Polkadot is a particularly smooth downtrend versus ETH. So that's why I started with that one. Solana is a little choppier. You'd have a harder time hanging on to a short in that one.
00:28:50.474 - 00:28:55.114, Speaker A: Polkadot is I haven't heard a single thing out of Polkadot.
00:28:55.274 - 00:29:03.814, Speaker B: Well, that's just it, right? Look at the chart. Polkadot versus ETH on coingecko or tradingview or something. And yes, I just said coinkecko too.
00:29:04.634 - 00:29:07.218, Speaker A: No, coingecko is good. You didn't say coinmarketcap.
00:29:07.266 - 00:29:33.124, Speaker B: Smoothest downtrend I've ever seen. So at what point, at what point in alt space do you say, all right, we're at peak fud, maybe it's time to buy. Could it be going back to regulation and lawsuits and stuff? Could it be there is a scenario in the distribution where the SeC just straight up loses to ripple and the judge says XRP is not a security. Then what do alts do?
00:29:34.624 - 00:29:45.816, Speaker A: Then alts probably rip, but I don't think they rip until that happens, because you need retail to come back in and retail is nowhere to be found and institutions are not going to be buying any of this stuff.
00:29:45.920 - 00:29:47.920, Speaker B: And the reality is most of these.
00:29:47.952 - 00:30:30.494, Speaker A: Things aren't that useful. And we've talked about this before on the previous podcast with, with Novo. It's like we're in the show me, we're in the show me phase. Most of these things are not. There are a couple of things that are obviously useful and then most of them are just trash. And so you get, you get to this point where who is going to be buying them and for what reasons? I think a lot of people in 2021 tried to make arguments for, I'm buying these for fundamental reasons, but the fundamentals have died on a lot of alts right now and probably aren't coming back. And so I think that we're just in a situation where until you get some sort of positive news about altcoins, you're going to have pockets about outperformance.
00:30:30.494 - 00:31:27.720, Speaker A: I think you're going to have specific alts that do well. I think you're going to have, for example, something like a stacks which is tied to bitcoin and regulatory compliant is actually seems to be right now how people are choosing to voice alt beta, which is kind of interesting. It's like people that would probably normally buy a large swath of alts are kind of sticking to a smaller universe, which makes sense to me, and they're going to be things that are going to be useful. So, for example, you look at arbitrum or you look at optimism with 4484 coming up, and that those alts probably, those alts probably do well. But, and maybe, maybe even something like a matic. I don't know if you guys saw recently, but their NFT drop with Nike is now integrated into Fortnite and that seemed to fly under, fly under the radar a bit. And Matic has been performing, performing pretty badly.
00:31:27.720 - 00:32:27.574, Speaker A: But it seems like there's at least some traction that's organically coming up again. Uh, and so I think that they're going to be select outperformers, but in aggregate, the complex probably doesn't do particularly well. And you probably just, you probably don't do well, uh, buying alts, for example, as a BTC rotation play until either a BTC is at 35 to 40, in which case retail comes back in, or you get that, uh, you know, XRP headline that comes out that says, hey, XRP is not a security. And so that sort of game of all hot potato, that game that you would play in 21 is probably just going to be very hard to come by right now. And you probably need to actually go do some work and then not rely on the work of others because it's very easy to get dumped on by crypto Twitter. I think a lot of the times I see alts that are talked about on crypto Twitter super actively end up being the worst performers.
00:32:28.874 - 00:33:02.890, Speaker B: Altcoins. I mean, I missed the altcoin season. I joined this market too late. Its been bitcoin season since I joined. And honestly, I think youre right. You cant just buy a basket like a market cap weighted basket of altcoins and then hope that works as sort of a BTC rotation trade because then literally you are buying things like Polkadot, which are still up there in market cap. These aren't small ecosystems from a market cap perspective, but from a relevance and potential perspective, they're utterly irrelevant.
00:33:02.962 - 00:33:43.492, Speaker A: When you're dealing with custody, there's this concept of a qualified custodian. You want to keep your assets with a qualified custodian. You want to make sure you're adhering to the rules as best as you possibly can. Lets say you have a token in a metamask or in fireblocks or in another custodian that isnt technically deemed a qualified custodian currently. And you compare that to a secondary transaction in PE. So you go out there, you buy stock of company A from an investor who invested in the series A. They havent raised their series B yet.
00:33:43.492 - 00:34:23.985, Speaker A: You go buy that from the investor. How do you actually own that? What do you actually own? You basically have a bunch of contracts that are signed that may hopefully hold up and hopefully are totally fine, and most cases do hold up perfectly fine, but you basically just have an email chain and you have a bunch of documents with no version control and then maybe a ledger. Maybe they use, what is it called? Carta. Maybe they have that. Right. And so how do you know that you actually own this thing. And the answer is, it's a little tough.
00:34:23.985 - 00:35:00.501, Speaker A: Well, if you own a token in your metamask, you verifiably own that thing. You know that you own it. You are the holder of that token. And so there are a lot of things about crypto that just makes sense. Like, I can very easily foresee a future where all private transactions, all public securities transactions, all of it is represented on the Ethereum blockchain, because it just is a better overall system. What that doesn't mean is that the SEC coming after crypto is killing crypto. It just changes crypto.
00:35:00.501 - 00:35:33.386, Speaker A: And so what you end up with is you end up with probably something like an Aave or a Solana or name insert alt that the SEC has said is a security. Just having their token trade publicly as a security, and they just register as a security. Security doesn't mean illegal, it doesn't mean fraud. Right. It just literally means, okay, go register. Go register as a security. Now, there may or may not be some tokens that work as a security, and there may or may not be some tokens that don't work as a security.
00:35:33.386 - 00:36:11.524, Speaker A: And, well, there are, there are definitely tokens that work as a security. They're definitely tokens that don't. And so some business models will die, some business models will adapt, some will change. It's by no means the end of crypto. Uh, and that this is also something, by the way, that we've been discussing for a long time, is the bifurcation of crypto into the regulated KYC institutional type crypto, and then the offshore kind of crazy underground market of crypto that's probably going to still exist. And both of those things are going to exist in parallel. And there's kind of no way to stop that.
00:36:11.524 - 00:36:15.324, Speaker A: That's probably a good thing. Yeah, I agree.
00:36:15.624 - 00:37:00.916, Speaker B: You'll end up with, there will be bridges between the two, but those bridges will be heavily regulated, and perhaps those bridges will have lower take rates than the bridges that act between developing and developed markets. Right. Now, again, I'm just going to go back to commodities because that's my comfort zone. Trading houses like Trafigura and Vitol act as an intermediary between places where there's a surplus of commodities, which is often places where JP Morgan won't do business. Iraqi Kurdistan, Chad. Right. And then places where there's a deficit, like China, again, where JP Morgan won't do business, or France, where they will.
00:37:00.916 - 00:37:42.022, Speaker B: Right. And frankly, those intermediaries get paid spectacularly to intermediate. And because they're sort of regulated and legally compliant. I think blockchains sort of fulfill similar functions where you can have, you know, you can have certain chains that. That are popular in markets that are less sort of friendly to american regulatory oversight and other markets which are very compliant, and you'll have very regulated bridges in between the two with lower take rates. Also, I think that what you mentioned about how some tokens will just be securities, and that's fine.
00:37:42.118 - 00:37:42.766, Speaker A: Couldn't agree more.
00:37:42.790 - 00:38:30.742, Speaker B: I mean, you have exchanges like Nasdaq that can list both securities and non securities, like commodities. So there are already venues that exist that are able to sort of list both types of products. You could have bitcoin and some token that's a security on the same exchange, same liquidity. So maybe in terms of the business models, to your point about certain business models changing or getting disrupted, maybe the exchange landscape looks a lot different in ten years as a result of this sort of regulatory picture. Maybe you end up with, I don't know if we. I don't know if it's Nasdaq or EDX, the new Citadel and fidelity thing, or one of these other new venues that really comes and competes with Coinbase and Binance, but it feels like there's room for a new player or two.
00:38:30.878 - 00:38:45.564, Speaker A: Yeah, there's definitely room for a new player. And I don't think, by the way, I don't think it's a coincidence that all this regulatory action is coming out now. Oh, look, we just tagged 30k just as a. Let's celebrate and sell everything. Now.
00:38:46.544 - 00:38:50.284, Speaker B: I'm going to drink this glass of water. Maybe something else later.
00:38:50.824 - 00:39:04.536, Speaker A: I'll finish my coffee. It's funny, there's a book behind me right now called the Alchemy of Finance by George Soros. And basically, I can sum up the book in one word, which is everything is reflexive.
00:39:04.720 - 00:39:09.312, Speaker B: It didn't sound like one word. Avi, which two words?
00:39:09.408 - 00:39:49.894, Speaker A: Everything. Reflexivity. One word. And I think that that's very true right now. The more the bitcoin goes up, the more that people believe the ETF is going to go through, and the more people are going to buy bitcoin, and the more people are going to believe the ETF goes through, and then the more pressure Blackrock is probably going to put on the SEC, get this thing through. And so it's, you know, it's sort of a virtuous, virtuous cycle right now. I think the only thing that has made me a little bit nervous about this rally is just that the equity markets have gone the opposite way.
00:39:49.894 - 00:40:01.874, Speaker A: So Nasdaq is down a percent, you know, s and S and P is down 50 bps. And so I'm keeping a close eye on that. I will say that bitcoin's got a.
00:40:01.914 - 00:40:11.946, Speaker B: Lot of catching up to do with the Nasdaq, which just took off and left bitcoin in the dust. So maybe not, which is why this is baked in, which is why I'm.
00:40:11.970 - 00:41:17.824, Speaker A: Not as worried, but I am keeping an eye on it. With that being said, there are a couple of interesting bullish data points out there that we have a macro team that we pay attention to. This happened on the last inflation print in May. If you look out one year from when the Fed funds rate crossed over the last inflation print, the one year return from the s and P was 13% and the two year return is 31%. And on the two year thats 31% versus an average of, I think 15% over the time period that the study was tracked. And so there is some evidence that theres just general bullishness in the market to come, that we have inflation under control and that this actually sets up for a very nice environment for bitcoin to tag 40k. That being said, Im still a seller on the headline that ETF has approved, Im definitely a seller.
00:41:17.824 - 00:41:24.844, Speaker A: Try to buy back in a little bit lower. Me too, on that headline. So all that with a grain of salt.
00:41:25.434 - 00:42:22.744, Speaker B: Yeah. Pretty cool that it just tagged 30k though, in the middle of the podcast. That settles our bet from the previous podcast, several podcasts ago where we said, hey, is it going to hit 24 31st? We both said 24 and here we are trading thirty k. I think you're supposed to sell a BlackRock ETF approval headline as well, to be covered a bit lower, like a tactical type trademark. I think over time in general, in thinking about pre positioning for fairly well telegraphed headlines and events, I have a fairly bad track record of it in tradfi, but in crypto it seems to work. And I think the reason why is everybody and their mother knows the halving is coming next year. Everybody's probably right that Blackrock will get their ETF approval eventually at some point.
00:42:22.744 - 00:43:21.354, Speaker B: Sure, you can get long ahead of those things and in tradfi you would, and the markets would price it in almost immediately. And then when the event occurs, it's kind of a nothing burger, but there's just not enough capital in crypto to pre hedge a halving event, right? Think of the amount of dollars it would take to buy bitcoin up to the net present value of bitcoin where the amount of miner selling is halved into perpetuity. It's just that amount of capital doesn't exist. The amount of capital that could flow into bitcoin seamlessly with a Blackrock ETF, like there isn't that amount of capital in bitcoin right now. So you, you can't, like the market, can't trade to where it should go after all of that buying has taken place. So I think crypto being a small market, relatively speaking, of course, still a mega cap asset, but a small market makes it easier to trade ahead of these events that would normally chop you up in tradfi.
00:43:22.214 - 00:43:45.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd agree with that. This is just reflected across the spectrum in crypto. There are a couple of things that happened in the last week that just reminded me how slow the market is to react to things in crypto. One is that GBTC didn't have its crazy move until the Monday after the blackrock filing was announced, even though it was, I think.
00:43:45.862 - 00:44:10.934, Speaker B: Well, there was a reason for that. There was a big reason for that. Basically you could make the argument that I made earlier about how GBTC could trade down quite a lot if they act in their own best interest. But what really sent GBTC soaring was the rumor, unsubstantiated thus far, but on crypto news sites and crypto Twitter, that fidelity was going to buy grayscale or looking to buy grayscale.
00:44:11.594 - 00:44:13.786, Speaker A: You think that was a reason? I think it was just that hit.
00:44:13.810 - 00:44:15.694, Speaker B: The tape and it just ripped.
00:44:16.714 - 00:44:47.284, Speaker A: I think it was a little bit of both. I think it was people reacting slow and then coming in over the, learning about it over the weekend and then coming in on Monday and making their bets. The other thing that's interesting is that the miners have been. So I talked about this, I think two podcasts ago at this point of how bullish I was on miners for two reasons. One was the transaction fees. Two were the pivots to AI that were coming. By the way, like every miner is now pivoting to AI and people just didn't seem to appreciate this.
00:44:47.284 - 00:45:02.324, Speaker A: Hut eight was a great example. They signed a contract to provide HBC on June 14 and then two days later proceeded to rocket. This was actually pre bitcoin rocketing. So it's like people just aren't paying attention to the sector at all.
00:45:03.224 - 00:45:11.040, Speaker B: Miners are pivoting to AI. They just have a lot of chips and they're going to rent them out to people who want to train models with them or well, yes, but it's.
00:45:11.072 - 00:45:36.016, Speaker A: Not about the chips because it's a completely different business. You need a specific type of chip and it's more about the facilities and the access to people that know how to. For example, cooling is important in both bitcoin mining and HPC. They have all of that set up. They have the people that know how to build out those services. They have the warehouses and the facilities. They have the power contracts.
00:45:36.016 - 00:46:20.248, Speaker A: And so the actual product is radically different and requires a decent amount of upfront investment. But the overall operations are very similar. And so a lot of these miners, like HUD eight, like Iren, like Cypher are going out there and they're saying, hey, guys, well, we're just going to repurpose some of our facilities to go provide HPC because it seems like there's a tremendous amount of demand, diversifying the business, generating more revenue and hut, I mean, since I mentioned it is up a ton, right. And it's like, okay, well, that's kind of interesting because people reacted very slowly even though all the information was public. All of it was out there. All of it was for the taking. It's just that nobody, nobody from tradfi was really looking at the sector.
00:46:20.366 - 00:46:38.988, Speaker B: Let's work through the mechanics of this a little bit more for the listeners. And I'm going to pretend it's just for the listeners and not for me, even though I'm curious, too. Okay, so a miner pivots to AI. What does that mean exactly? Let's walk through the sequence of events. They start using some of their people and facilities and hardware to solve.
00:46:39.036 - 00:46:48.100, Speaker A: Not hardware. That's the key. Not hardware because the hardware doesn't transfer. Asics don't like. You can't provide HPC with ASICs because ASIcs, again, application specific.
00:46:48.252 - 00:46:50.044, Speaker B: Okay, so no hardware, people.
00:46:50.164 - 00:46:51.004, Speaker A: It's in the name.
00:46:51.124 - 00:46:54.084, Speaker B: What does that do for hashrate? What does that do for miner selling?
00:46:54.164 - 00:46:54.380, Speaker A: Why?
00:46:54.412 - 00:46:56.476, Speaker B: Why would that mean less miner selling?
00:46:56.620 - 00:47:01.024, Speaker A: It doesn't mean less miner selling. I just think that it's good for the miners.
00:47:01.404 - 00:47:11.292, Speaker B: Okay, I see. So you're talking about a trade for miner stocks. You're not saying, hey, resources are going to get diverted away from core activity and there's a stock and flow.
00:47:11.348 - 00:47:45.128, Speaker A: I just think bitcoin, I don't think it has any, any impact on bitcoin price other than it actually. Well, it's an equities. It may, it may have an impact on bitcoin price and that it makes mining companies healthier. Right. If you have diverse, you, you have less of this potential forced selling on the way down in the future. That's actually, I hadn't actually considered this until you asked this question, but it's possible that miners just don't like moving forward. Miners will get liquidated less often as they become better and more robust businesses.
00:47:45.286 - 00:48:29.764, Speaker B: It would make the market healthier for sure. And it would also tell the world, like, hey, look, crypto has provided a series of infrastructure plays that are relevant outside of just crypto to me. I think there are a few examples of that in crypto, and miners being a new one would be good for the space, frankly, as opposed to just this energy. It basically says there is a market for energy consuming, purpose specific computation facilities outside of just one application, and that one application sort of laid the rails for other applications. I think that that would be a healthy narrative, frankly.
00:48:30.104 - 00:48:56.584, Speaker A: I think so, yeah. I think that's a reasonable outtake. Yeah. But it's just these types of things seem to just take a while. I think the main point is that especially these tradfi based narratives seem to take a while to really percolate in a way that crypto seems to move very quickly because there are a lot of people watching crypto, but in tradfi it takes a while to percolate.
00:48:59.724 - 00:49:15.754, Speaker B: Jonah, sounds like there are good opportunities for crypto focused investors to trade the tradfi linked assets like these trusts, grayscale, maybe blackrock mining stocks, Coinbase stock, all sorts of opportunity out there.
00:49:17.454 - 00:49:31.754, Speaker A: I think you need some tradfi expertise in order to get it right, but I think that is a pretty substantial source of alpha. Yeah, I think weve had a really good discussion today.
00:49:32.394 - 00:49:34.970, Speaker B: Likewise. Always great to catch up with you.
00:49:35.082 - 00:49:38.934, Speaker A: I appreciate bitcoin deciding to rip through 30 on the.
00:49:39.514 - 00:49:40.974, Speaker B: It's still ascending.
00:49:41.354 - 00:49:43.538, Speaker A: I know. It's still, it's still, it's still sending.
00:49:43.666 - 00:49:44.614, Speaker B: What a move.
00:49:45.274 - 00:49:47.578, Speaker A: What a good day. What a good day.
00:49:47.666 - 00:49:52.974, Speaker B: I mean, we were all pretty, feeling pretty dejected a couple weeks ago. Now everybody's euphoric again.
00:49:53.594 - 00:50:04.704, Speaker A: I know, I hate it. I like feeling happy when everybody else is dejected and I can start buying and then I get really nervous and everybody gets euphoric. So anyway, we'll see how this goes.
00:50:06.004 - 00:50:18.604, Speaker B: Good luck out there, everybody. This is not investment advice. Crypto is risky. Tokens are risky. Crypto linked securities are risky. So be careful, do your own research, and we'll see you again in two weeks.
