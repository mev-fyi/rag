00:00:00.200 - 00:00:24.606, Speaker A: Not to make this comparison, but I'm going to make the comparison because why not? It was consensus that Ripple sucked four years ago and five years ago and six years ago, and then it was true. It just sucked. It just never got adoption. It never got picked up. It never. It never worked. And so it's not improbable that ETH becomes the ripple of this cycle where everybody thinks it's going to pump because it pumped really hard last cycle.
00:00:24.606 - 00:00:39.470, Speaker A: I mean, ripple pump so, so hard in 2017, it ripped everybody's face off. And then in 2021, it literally did nothing. When you have all these people that have made, that have made money on Solana, I don't know why they would come back to eat.
00:00:39.622 - 00:00:49.914, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by perennial finance, the on chain defi primitive redesigning derivatives for the Defi native. You'll hear more about perennial later in the show.
00:00:57.304 - 00:01:16.044, Speaker A: Welcome back to another episode of 1000 X. We are back online after our in person discussion at gas, which was really fun. Honestly, John, I really enjoyed speaking with you in front of that audience. That was a good test of our ability to perform in front of a couple hundred people.
00:01:17.344 - 00:01:18.096, Speaker C: It was awesome.
00:01:18.160 - 00:01:18.840, Speaker A: It was.
00:01:18.992 - 00:01:38.334, Speaker C: Thank you, everybody who came the room kind of filled up early into our conversation and we had some good vibes in there. It was good to see people actually showing up for a crypto conference, feeling bullish, feeling excited to be in the space for a change after a very painful bear market.
00:01:38.494 - 00:02:18.636, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought that was a really nice indication of where we're at. It was also very institutional. Just in general, the quality of the people that I talked to, the quality of the builders, the quality of the investors, everybody seemed to really understand and know what's going on in the space more than they have in the past. The market is definitely getting a little bit smarter, which is either a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it. It's always nice to be trading against a stupid market. So I think it's a little bit of a double edged sword. But it was good to see at least the industry itself seems to have grown up a non trivial amount over the last two years.
00:02:18.636 - 00:02:24.664, Speaker A: I think we've learned a lot of lessons. I didn't see too many shorts in the audience or on stage. Always good.
00:02:25.604 - 00:03:33.936, Speaker C: One thing that struck me about the conference, Avi, was that you had people in there who were, you know, it feels like the last couple of bear markets have filtered out, grifters filtered out, you know, the get rich quick scammer type. And this crew seemed like a genuinely curious, more institutional crowd, because that's the nature of this conference. It's for, I think, Tradfi. It's like the bridge between Tradfi and crypto. But the people there were not like hardcore anarchist bitcoin class of 2011 crypto enthusiasts, but more like maybe they got their feet wet in 2021 and stuck with it kind of enthusiasts and a mixture of tech people and also finance guys who are trying to basically bridge capital from Tradfi into crypto, which I thought was pretty interesting. We were talking about this just before the podcast. After the conference was over, we went to the ethereum dinner.
00:03:33.936 - 00:03:47.424, Speaker C: There was an Ethereum dinner and a Solana dinner. And, you know, maybe it's because I fudded Solana $180 ago, but we didn't get the look on the Solana dinner. I'm sorry about that, Avi. I'm sorry you got dragged into my shit show there.
00:03:48.604 - 00:03:50.516, Speaker A: You fixed it. You got in at 30.
00:03:50.660 - 00:04:18.876, Speaker C: I did. I did. Not enough. Never enough, unfortunately. But I think the ethereum dinner was interesting because, correct me if I'm wrong here, but it feels like there's a lot going on on that chain and a lot of hatred and fud and fear going on inside of crypto about ETH. Like ETH should be performing right now, and it's not. We got a little look behind the scenes at what's coming at the dinner.
00:04:18.876 - 00:04:20.144, Speaker C: It's pretty interesting.
00:04:21.244 - 00:04:45.244, Speaker A: Yeah. I do think that ETH has been really destroyed. I mean, it's not a think. I know, I can see it on the chart. You can just see it from the community. You can see it across the board when you have all these l two s that are struggling really hard to get, to get any uptick. Obviously, you have arbitrum, optimism, ZK sync, but people have really just forgotten about ETH, I think, in a big way.
00:04:45.244 - 00:05:30.056, Speaker A: And my personal view on this is that it's really hard for that to change unless you get an ETH ETF approved. I was unfortunately incorrect on my last calls. I thought that post bitcoin ETF, the narrative would switch very quickly to the ETH ETF, which it did for about six days. And then everybody decided that the ETH ETF wasn't going to get approved. And so ETH just started trading really poorly again. I think the issue is right now, ETH has always been the chain where the real projects build and the real projects go. The DeFi projects of the world, the RWA projects of the world, they all like Ethereum because Ethereum signals a little bit of institutional bent.
00:05:30.056 - 00:06:20.374, Speaker A: It has a little bit of an institutional bent to it. It has a little bit more of a grounded, less pie in the sky because it's been around so long and it's the number two. And the reality is that that's just not what's interesting to people right now. That's not what's interesting to investors. There's just nobody putting their money on things that are being built on ETH, and that's making it really hard for ETH to succeed. Also, one of those things where the risk profile of ETH is way too similar to bitcoin right now. It's you're looking, if you can imagine bitcoin at ETH at ten k, the difference in return isn't that big between those two, in the eyes of crypto people, the difference between a two x and a three x, kind of.
00:06:20.374 - 00:06:50.786, Speaker A: Well, you know, how much does this really matter now? When you have meme coins popping off 100 x everywhere, that's going to dampen your interest in a coin like ETH. And so I'm getting increasingly nervous about ETH. I was bullish for a bit in the beginning there. As the ETH ETF narrative went away, I stepped away. And now I'm thinking, I don't even know when I would step back in at this point. I don't know if you have a different take.
00:06:50.970 - 00:07:31.160, Speaker C: Yeah, I have a slightly different take. I mean, I'm a long term ETH bag holder. I got in at a good price, and I just haven't really sold. It's pretty much the only token I've done right for the long haul, I would say I've had some short term wins and other things, and bitcoin I've done right as well. But ETH, I did really right. And I think the reason why I've held ETH through this cycle, there's a bit of laziness attached to just holding something and never selling it, but also because I believed it was good diversification from bitcoin. I'm bullish as ever, bitcoin, for all the reasons we've hammered ad nauseam in this podcast.
00:07:31.160 - 00:08:13.464, Speaker C: But ETH, I thought it's sort of like the de facto l one, where serious people build serious projects, just like you said, Solana has really shown up and become a performant player to deploy a decentralized application, and serious people are building there for sure. I guess it's kind of scary for ETH, but at the same time, I think maximalism is stupid. When I bull post ETH on Twitter, the Solana people, they say really nasty things. But I think it's possible to envision a scenario where both tokens drastically outperform bitcoin. Both of them are not. They haven't breached their all time highs from the previous cycle yet. Bitcoin has.
00:08:13.464 - 00:08:38.402, Speaker C: Both of these Alt L1 s can definitely go up quite a lot from here. I think there's a scenario where bitcoin rallies. Bitcoin does a two x and ETH does a five x. And here's that scenario for you, Avi. The scenario is you develop a meme coin ecosystem on base that attracts people. It's already kind of happening. So you have two casinos now.
00:08:38.402 - 00:09:18.064, Speaker C: The win isn't the only show in Vegas, right? There's a couple of places where you can go gamble. It doesn't have to all be on Solana forever, right? So you get your meme coin casino. Then something that nobody's talking about right now is games. And you get like, Ansem shilled us the parallel trading card game back in November. What if one of those things just lands on Ethan? All those projects are kind of distributed across different l one s, but I think ETH has a couple interesting ones, including that one that could pop off. Those are kind of call options. Ultimately, I think the big one is tradfi settling stuff on chain tokenized funds.
00:09:18.064 - 00:09:50.110, Speaker C: You and I both agree that crypto is a better way to move value and spend value than tradfi rails. And I think that tokenized funds are a massive use case that nobody's really paying attention to. Blackrock's biddle fund, I think it's at 300 million in assets now. And then the final thing is the ETH ETF, Blackrock filed an application for an ETH eTF. The final approval is due from the SEC this May. Their record for ETF approvals is like 800. Yes.
00:09:50.110 - 00:10:13.444, Speaker C: One. No. They know what they're fucking doing. And you make the biggest returns when you buy stuff that everyone hates. And you're right, you don't make the biggest returns when you lift hyped, amazing narratives after they've just ten x'd. I don't know. So I think this might be a good contrarian opportunity.
00:10:15.264 - 00:10:50.476, Speaker A: Yeah. Look, at the end of the day, the issue is that there's just no narrative for ethereum. And so you have all these potential narratives that you just outlined, I think very well that could materialize. So you could have the RWA narrative come up, which is very reasonable because I do think that if institutions are going to work with a chain, it's very likely going to be ETH first and then everything else second. But that's just not what people are interested in right now, and it's not driving any, any real value to the chain. So I think this is more of a slow burn. And then again, when you step back, it just goes back to the risk reward.
00:10:50.476 - 00:11:00.740, Speaker A: At the end of the day, everything in trading is risk reward. What's the upside versus what's the downside? And the issue is that there's no pie in the sky case for ETH. So the way that I think about.
00:11:00.772 - 00:11:05.652, Speaker C: This is, I thought I just named a couple pie in the sky cases, but I don't.
00:11:05.788 - 00:11:40.200, Speaker A: In terms of price, I think 10,000, 15,000. That's not enough people interested. So the way that I view this is, if you want ETH exposure, the best way to do it is two things. One, you either buy really high end nfts that are doing well, or two, you're buying the l two s on top of ETH that you think are going to benefit. So, for example, base could be a catalyst for ETH. If base really picks up, then it could be a catalyst. But what we're seeing is that Solana is doing such a good job at recapturing flows.
00:11:40.200 - 00:12:18.378, Speaker A: So over the last two weeks, there were a lot of flows that went out to base. But then over the last five days, a lot of those flows left base and went right back to Solana. So there's no stickiness right now among the ETH l two s. And the concept of decentralization just doesn't seem to be entering into people's minds in the same way that it did in 2021, there's a lot less idealism this time around in this market than there was four years ago. I think four years ago, you still had a little bit. I mean, not a little bit. Four years ago, you had a much larger libertarian bent to crypto.
00:12:18.378 - 00:12:50.108, Speaker A: Now you don't really have anything. So if I'm thinking about constructing a portfolio, if you are bullish on ETH, I still don't think you buy ETH outright. You buy ETH beta. That can do well in a couple of different scenarios. And you just have to avoid the trap of getting stuck in ETH, because what's possible is that all of this stuff comes together in two years. But if bitcoin is going down when rwas are taking off on ETH, I don't think that's enough to keep ETH high. That's the issue.
00:12:50.236 - 00:14:17.404, Speaker C: Totally agree. You touched on something in the middle of that, though, that I think is valuable to dissect, which is that the ETH bag holders, the ETH ecosystem people, it's not just that they aren't in the right nightclub, at the right party right now, which is Solana, right? It's more that that's happening and they're getting decimated on their nfts. Their bored apes are going to zero, their pudgy penguins, their squiggles, all of this, like the meme coins, the moon shots of the previous cycle, the moon birds, as it were, right? They're all just either getting rugged or getting blurred down to zero. And I think the only reason why the ether rocks and the crypto punks have survived this onslaught is because the token standard for those projects predates ERC 721, which is what blur effectively prices. Right? So you have this engine for effectively flooring NFTs that's just destroying value across the ETH ecosystem at the very same time as like, people are 1000 xing their cash on shark cat cat face, handsome cat, moondog dog moon on Solana. And that's great. But again, I feel like the best time to get into these narratives is on the lows, not on the highs.
00:14:17.404 - 00:14:35.220, Speaker C: And beath is hated. Maybe this is the time where you should be looking to add equally all of this meme money that's theoretically getting made on Solana. You know, I'm. I'm. I'm heavily invested now in Joe Bowden and I am.
00:14:35.292 - 00:14:37.700, Speaker A: I am over invested and I need.
00:14:37.732 - 00:15:11.142, Speaker C: To get out over, over invested in Joe Bowden. And I have this little, little allocation to some monkey haircuts from shark cat and a few others. It's kind of like it's cool to watch those coins go up, but I haven't sold anything and I. If everybody went to go take profit, we'd see very quickly that these hundred x's or thousand x's on paper are actually more like two to three x's for the early people and negative 50% for the late people. So it's a. We're in a tricky part of the cycle here. The volatility is picking up.
00:15:11.142 - 00:15:28.066, Speaker C: It's unclear what the next narrative is going to be. And if you're right, Avi, if all of these big ETH wins land in the middle of, like, after another bear market, then who cares? But if they land in the next year while we're still pumping, then it could be ridiculous. Just don't know this episode is brought.
00:15:28.090 - 00:15:49.834, Speaker B: To you by perennial finance. Perennial is quickly becoming one of the go to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of Defi. So let me tell you a little bit about them. There are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on. First one, great trade execution. Second one, low fees. And third, of course, an on chain permissionless platform.
00:15:49.834 - 00:16:29.202, Speaker B: And perennial nails all three of those buckets. With the launch of perennial v two, they've made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles, which reduce trade execution to seconds lower fees, competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers. Fully modular markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there. And fourth, cash settled, right? The trades are cash settled in USD, not in crypto. Perennial allows you, the trader, to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the TVL. How it works is that perennial enables a two sided market made up of both traders and liquidity providers.
00:16:29.258 - 00:16:29.498, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:29.546 - 00:16:57.062, Speaker B: Traders deposit the assets to get levered exposure, while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position. Perennial allows you to trade crypto, perps, FX and coming soon, nfts and more. Backed by some of the best investors in the industry, perennial is a must check out platform. If you're a crypto trader, go check them out by clicking the link in the description. Give thousand x some credit. Go check out perennial. You're gonna love them.
00:16:57.062 - 00:16:58.718, Speaker B: All right, let's get back to the show.
00:16:58.806 - 00:17:14.553, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think it's, I think it's hard, hard to say, because the reality is that now when you have all these people that have made, that have made money on Solana, I don't know why they would come back to eat.
00:17:14.853 - 00:17:16.557, Speaker C: Have they crystallized it, though?
00:17:16.725 - 00:17:37.754, Speaker A: But even if they crystallize it, maybe they just take it out or they wait for something else. There's no reason, especially now, because it's not like you're stuck on Solana in the same way that you were back in the day. I mean, there's so many off ramps. You just go straight to any exchange and you can deposit your Solana USDC that you, that you've minted.
00:17:38.414 - 00:17:47.754, Speaker C: That value will leave Solana. If there's something to buy on ETH, there just isn't right now. Like, half of the value in Solana is probably wealth that came in from ETH and bitcoin. You know.
00:17:49.734 - 00:18:18.436, Speaker A: That. Yeah. That for sure. The question is, has it been lost? Has it been lost forever? And my bet is that a non trivial percentage of it is, yes. We just really, we just need Blackrock to file the CTF method and I mean improve the CTF. That did it. At the end of the day, that's the only thing that's going to save the BTC ratio right now, unfortunately, because what you have, what you just have is you just have no meaningful adoption of anything that's being built, that's being.
00:18:18.460 - 00:18:49.714, Speaker C: Built on ETH, except for all the shit going on base. But I take your point, right? Like, I'm not going to. For the, for everyone listening. I'm not denying that it's bad right now on ETH, the ETH dinner was a little bit gloomy, um, even at an otherwise very happy conference. But, like, I'm just going to say here, uh, let's say that, like, it's consensus that eats sucks. It's consensus that the ETF is going to get denied. It's consensus that Solana is the, the new layer, one where you build, where serious people build serious stuff and serious people build fun stuff.
00:18:49.714 - 00:19:15.270, Speaker C: Like, what if, what if the SEC just gets daddied by Larry Fink again and an ETF for ETH gets approved while no one expects it or is paying attention? Like, and then a bunch of retail that, that isn't on crypto Twitter that doesn't know any of this stuff or care about crypto natives, like, native narratives is just like, oh, let's buy some ETH. That's. You don't want to be short ahead of that. Like, it's, it's a contrarian.
00:19:15.302 - 00:19:45.978, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I agree. You don't, you don't want to be short. You probably don't want to. Don't want to short Ethan. I also think that spread trades are really mid curve in this market right now just because I think there's a lot of alpha in picking a direction and sticking with it. My hesitation with it just comes from the fact that even if we do get a pop from the ETF, it's probably going to be a short lived one because there's only so much allocation.
00:19:45.978 - 00:20:25.966, Speaker A: I also do think that there's, you know, a lot of people in the trad five world are very comfortable with BTC, and they're still less, just less comfortable with the idea, with, with the idea of ETH still to this day. And not to make a bad, I mean, not, not, not to make this comparison, but I'm going to make the comparison, because why not? It was consensus that Ripple sucked four years ago and five years ago and six years ago, and then it was true. It just sucked. It just never got adoption. It never got picked up. It never, it never worked. And so it's not improbable that ETH becomes the ripple of this cycle where everybody thinks it's going to pump because it pumped really hard last cycle.
00:20:25.966 - 00:20:32.914, Speaker A: I mean, ripple pumped so hard in 2017, it ripped everybody's face off. And then in 2021, it literally did nothing.
00:20:33.214 - 00:20:35.710, Speaker C: Yeah, it went to like $3, didn't it?
00:20:35.902 - 00:21:08.720, Speaker A: Yeah, but it went from, I mean, it basically ten x and that's it, which is nothing. And I just personally think that you have a scenario where ETH is caught between this rock and a hard place. The only thing that can save it, I think, is a really, really, really phenomenal user experience. On ML two. You need arbitrum optimism, ZK, to just have the best user experience by far. You have to have it beat Solana. You have to have people come back over.
00:21:08.720 - 00:21:45.776, Speaker A: And the other thing is that Solana has now proven that you, it's one of the biggest moats. Just to take a step back, what was one of the biggest moats for ETH? It was the fact that you had to program in solidity, and the vast majority of people in crypto knew how to program in solidity, and they weren't programming and move, and they weren't programming in other languages. Now, that doesn't matter. So many people know how to program on Solana. So many people know how to program with different languages that are in crypto. There are a lot of people coming into this space that are developers that never need, you never need to learn solidity anymore. You don't need to learn it anymore.
00:21:45.776 - 00:22:17.780, Speaker A: If you want to launch a project, you can just stick with a language that's more common. Right. And so that moat has been eroded, and then also the moat for the EVM has been eroded because so much volume is happening off of, off of ethereum. So no longer has the moats that it used to have, which makes me think that it's now just a trading asset. I mean, you can long it when you're bullish on ETH for the next two weeks, for the next four weeks. But I'm just long term more bearish on Ethereum than I am on Solana. And this is what I actually said.
00:22:17.780 - 00:22:45.514, Speaker A: I said this on the panel, and that was maybe the most talked about statement. I mean, everybody else came up to me after and said, why are you so bullish on Solana? And you're not so bullish on Ethan. This is coming from somebody. I mean, I was never a Solana guy. I was not somebody out there from the beginning that said, oh, Solana, Solana, Solana, Solana. But what I've just seen is that ETH has had an inability to execute. And the l two s that are building on ETH also haven't been executing particularly well, no matter what they say.
00:22:45.514 - 00:23:12.010, Speaker A: And so you kind of have to re evaluate your opinion at a certain point and realize, look, these guys haven't been able to bring over real volumes and real people to their platforms. Solana seems to be doing a better job at this, and it's captured the zeitgeist of retail. And the reality is, at the end of the day, institutions go where retail is because that's where the money's made.
00:23:12.202 - 00:24:12.822, Speaker C: Do you really think Solana is definitely doing an amazing job right now? Not going to debate that. Do you really think ETH isn't bringing over real volumes and real people? I think if you look at DeFi volumes. Let's talk DeFi for a second. Here's another way, just very quickly, how, you know, some of my friends are on chain traders, like serious professional robot on chain traders. Here's some anecdotes from the on chain world of providing liquidity and defi. Apparently, the whole mev sandwich party on Ethereum ended when a major, let's call it a major on and off chain market maker decided to just lay off their risk on chain at mids, right? They're just sort of like showing up at every market that used to be super wide, and they've tightened it up. They're just like, well, we're long doge from this centralized trade we did.
00:24:12.822 - 00:24:44.670, Speaker C: So we're just going to offer doge and mids on chain. And apparently that's just killing a lot of the fat and the edge on Ethereum. Meanwhile, Solana is just this, like, crazy money party right now if you're there to make whiff and bowdoin and all this fun stuff. So part of me thinks that, but that says nothing about the volumes or the people. Volumes on uniswap are enormous. I don't have this committed to memory, but I think they're outpacing any other Dex.
00:24:44.742 - 00:25:51.790, Speaker A: I'm not saying there's no volume, but if you look, for example, if you look at the TVL of Ethereum, and then you look at the volume on Ethereum, it still pales in comparison to 21. Despite the fact that bitcoins passed, you know, bitcoin past all time highs, you're just not seeing the activity that you would expect. And things like Solana are seeing much higher volumes and activities than you saw in 21. Not much higher, but it's trending up, trending up nicely. And I think that what you're left with today is you're left with this bad taste in your mouth of, okay, well, ETH just is not doing as well as it was doing three, four years ago in terms of projects, in terms of volume, in terms of activity. When you would think that in a crazy market like today, in an insane market like today, you would think that it would have spread more. Now maybe take a step back, maybe I'm wrong about why, and it's just that we still haven't seen retail come in in full force.
00:25:51.790 - 00:26:52.508, Speaker A: So it's just that crypto people aren't interested in using Ethereum. But once retail starts to come back in, which I think probably you would need bitcoin closer to 100k, they're flirting with one hundred k to bring people back in, then maybe you see volume come back to ETH. But what's interesting to me is that even today, with prices at all time highs and people really excited and things happening in the crypto world, your average market participant that was around in 2021 isn't here right now. They're still not here. And I can't really put a finger on why. And I don't really know if they're going to come back. But I do think it boils down to, if I had to take a guess, the fact that it's very, very, very difficult to replicate the COVID effect.
00:26:52.508 - 00:27:33.434, Speaker A: It's just super difficult to replicate that effect where everybody's inside, nobody has anything to do, everybody's online 24/7 it's going to be hard to get back to where we were, where we were in 2021. So you have to at least think about the idea that there might not actually be retail coming back this cycle. And so if that's the case, then what do you want to, what do you want to focus on, at least until we get to 100k or things get absolutely, absolutely nuts, is you're just, you're focusing on the crypto native stuff and you're focusing on bitcoin. And I think this has been said ad nauseam, but I still think that this is true because you actually, at this point, you can't really make a strong bet on when retailers and when retail is going to come back in?
00:27:33.844 - 00:28:00.284, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, you can front run meme coins and that's just on chain degeneracy, but you can't make a bet on. It's harder to make a bet on NFTS games. Some of the more serious stuff. I mean, to your point about bitcoin, though, I am hearing some interesting anecdotes from the oil market. They're not going away. These anecdotes, the recent one, and I heard this from a very credible source, is that Pettivesa, which is the.
00:28:02.624 - 00:28:02.936, Speaker A: Let'S.
00:28:02.960 - 00:28:21.964, Speaker C: Just call it, a major venezuelan state owned oil entity, is offering and refining as well, offering discounts on export cargoes if the buyer pays in bitcoin instead of in dollars.
00:28:22.424 - 00:28:26.336, Speaker A: Seriously? Yeah. I mean, they're sanctioned, right? That's why.
00:28:26.360 - 00:28:49.338, Speaker C: Yeah, that's right. They're sanctioned. But like, they can't, they basically can't get banked with dollars anymore. The sanctioned oil trade, like half of the fucking oil. That's an exaggeration. At least 20% of the world's oil comes from sanctioned countries. So that's more than 20 million barrels a day.
00:28:49.338 - 00:29:14.162, Speaker C: Barrels, 42 gallons. Like, it's a, it's a, it's an ocean of oil. Every day comes from sanctioned entities. They have no dollar banking. The US has just sanctioned up the wazoo. So if you want to have, if you're Venezuela and you want to sell your oil and you want to receive dollars, you have to wait 17 business days for those dollars to hit a shell company owned by a shell company owned by a shell company. Or you can get your bitcoin 15 minutes.
00:29:14.162 - 00:29:29.414, Speaker C: Right. So, okay, maybe retail is not coming back to fuck around on aptos or play games on avalanche, but, you know, there is money coming into this. It's just different money, you know, but.
00:29:29.454 - 00:29:31.590, Speaker A: I mean, that sounds like it's just all bitcoin money. No?
00:29:31.742 - 00:29:34.074, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Bitcoin money.
00:29:34.454 - 00:29:43.646, Speaker A: Okay. So I think that that's, that's probably, that's probably the main difference, right. Is that this, this money is very unlikely to go travel to other sectors.
00:29:43.710 - 00:30:13.606, Speaker C: Correct. And the Blackrock ETF, the bitcoin ETF money isn't going to go travel to ETH either. But then, you know, you were the one shouting at me saying that eventually it does move over. So I don't know, I think maybe the ETH community is just too wounded from the NFT carnage and the lack of sandwich fun and all this other stuff to really get excited about degeneracy and the Solana mafia is on a high. You know, for obvious reasons, I was.
00:30:13.630 - 00:30:54.996, Speaker A: Sort of screaming that it was going to rotate over to altcoins in general from the people that already hold BTC. But what's clear to me is that it's, it just rotates. Crypto natives are just going to rotate to me points, right? I mean, our crypto natives going to buy defi. Now, the one thing that is maybe changing my mind a little bit kind of happened today. I mean, we'll see what happens with the airdrop from wormhole. And the airdrop from Athena was really good. And so you are going to have these large events where real products that are building real stuff, actually, it's generating interest now.
00:30:54.996 - 00:31:46.768, Speaker A: And so I am watching this closely, because if Athena really takes off, a formal really takes off, and it does well and it's sustained, then it might catalyze and move towards real projects. You look at Maker, Maker's done very well. So what could happen, and what we could see, just as a play devils advocate against myself, is that people take profits in meme coins into these more interesting assets, and then that catalyzes a run on meme coins and a booming of capital in projects that actually might do well, might do good for crypto, potentially. One thing that could happen is dog with hat sells off by 80%, but it sells off by 80% because all of that capital is moving into, quote, unquote, safer assets, which you would probably.
00:31:46.816 - 00:31:56.484, Speaker C: Expect at some point. Also, question for you, Avi, doesn't airdrop actually kickstart an ecosystem? Will wormhole take off because of the airdrop?
00:31:59.144 - 00:32:42.026, Speaker A: Yeah, it's possible. I think more importantly for wormhole is that if you're not allocated to SolaNa right now, you probably should be allocated to SolaNa right now, because it's going to create lot of wealth for people, and everybody's going to take that wormhole money, and they're going to buy monkey getting haircut or whatever. And that's probably going to be a very big boon for the Solana ecosystem. It's kind of the same way that when Avax announced that they were going to have a fund dedicated to buying meme coins on Avax, everybody wrote it off, and then all the meme coins on Avax did really well. That's how I feel about wormhole. It's telegraphed. Everybody sort of knows this, but I genuinely don't think people are, because there hasn't been enough front running flows yet.
00:32:42.170 - 00:32:44.574, Speaker C: Hmm. When's the wormhole airdrop?
00:32:45.594 - 00:32:47.054, Speaker A: That's a good question.
00:32:47.474 - 00:33:19.228, Speaker C: While we're talking about Solana. One of my favorite analysts on the Solana sort of ecosystem is this guy, zero X gumshoe. You should go check out zero X Gumshoe's Twitter account. He or she or whoever did an interesting analysis of airdrop price action. Basically, what you're supposed to do is farm those airdrops that you know are coming, slosh a bunch of money around in those systems. Wormhole, whatever, get your airdrop, sell it immediately, and then rebuy down like 80%. That's a good trade.
00:33:19.228 - 00:33:29.624, Speaker C: So don't. Don't hang on and get caught holding the bag. Go to zero x gumshoes account and learn how to trade an airdrop. I wish I had that last cycle.
00:33:30.314 - 00:33:38.934, Speaker A: Okay, that's. Yeah, it's interesting and fair. I'll go, go check that out. Xerox gumshoot. What a good shout out, Jonah.
00:33:39.594 - 00:34:21.990, Speaker C: See, I follow Solana Twitter. I like it. I got some Solana. It's fun. The one thing that I was kind of curious about, though, is in this environment where you talked about the barbell strategy, Avi, where you just hold bitcoin for obvious reasons, and then you play the meme coin casino for obvious reasons. Like, do you, are you starting to lose hope that any of the stuff in between those two extremes is going to start to emerge and generate value? And if it seems to, are we going to be too late? Like, is it, is it going to be the 2028 cycle where real shit starts to take off? I'm kind of getting worried.
00:34:22.142 - 00:34:58.156, Speaker A: I don't necessarily think that it's going to be that long. I think that we are going to see real things take off. I just don't know if you're going to be able to make money on them. That's why people are so interested in meme coins, because that's where the money's made. For example, an RWA platform that tokenizes a bunch of assets and that enables the trading of all these assets. How much does a platform that issues tokenized products, how much is that actually going to be worth? Is a question. Just the platform for facilitating, because it's.
00:34:58.180 - 00:35:10.716, Speaker C: Going to be very, very little. But the. Sorry, by platform you mean the. The application or the l two? I think l one is what benefits. I think the. Like, I believe in the fat protocol thesis. I don't think it's been disproven.
00:35:10.716 - 00:35:27.444, Speaker C: If anything, I think it's been proven. And if you have. If you have these tokenization rails getting built, then that just means millions of new ETH wallets getting lit up and funded with ETH and millions of institutions having to buy ETH to support all of this pay gas.
00:35:28.664 - 00:36:21.786, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I disagree, just because I think that a lot of these applications are going to happen on l two s and there's just not going to be that much demand for ETH that's generated, because these l two s are going to have very low fees. Then I go one step further and I think about the applications themselves. Are the applications going to generate any value? I mean, how much is aave supposed to be worth? How much is compound supposed to be worth? How much are these platforms supposed to be worth? And the answer is, when you can value it like a real business, not very much. So, look, I'm still stuck on the idea that you can make a lot of money investing in good products, in crypto, if you invest at good valuations. Obviously, this is super obvious. If you can do pre seed, if you can do angel, if you can get your money in or get into a fair launch early, early product with a great team, then you can make a lot of money if it's a good product and it's probably, it's a safer bet. Right.
00:36:21.786 - 00:37:11.304, Speaker A: So the way that I think about is if you can invest at a cutting edge lending protocol at a 25 million valuation or, you know, 50 million valuation as it comes out, then, yeah, maybe it'll get to 500 million, maybe it'll get to 600 million. And you're probably not going to lose that much money on it if it's run by a good team, in the same way that it doesn't matter how good a team is for meme coin, you can easily lose money on it if there's just no appetite for it. The upside just isn't there the same way. And so that's why the crypto native people aren't going for it. But I still think it's slow and steady wins the race. If you want to build wealth over time, you're supposed to invest in good products and crypto and just sit on them and not think about them, and then you can have some sort of meme allocation. But I think, in aggregate, what's happening right now is that there's just, the interest just isn't there.
00:37:11.304 - 00:38:11.420, Speaker A: But look, at the end of the day, we'll see. Right now we're talking about this as bitcoin sold off 5% today, which is a pretty good move for BTC. We tried to get through that 73k level, then we tried to get through the 72k level. And now we're back at 66, and I think we've both been bullish, but a little bit more cautious around these levels in the short term, just because I think things did get very overheated and there is a lot of open interest in the market. However, at this point, I'm seeing so many indications that are bullish for BTC. I mean, just the geopolitics in general is phenomenal for bitcoin. The world is becoming a much more dangerous place today, and so, more than ever, I want to hold on to BTC for the long run.
00:38:11.572 - 00:38:39.764, Speaker C: I agree. We were chatting about this offline. Everybody who's holding BTC on a cold wallet should educate themselves on downloading the private key and spending it. If ledger disappears or Trezor disappears, you should really learn the mechanics of what you're holding, because increasingly it looks like we live in a world where you may just need to pack up stuff in your little go bag and move.
00:38:44.064 - 00:38:48.684, Speaker A: How Iran is looking at potentially launching rockets at Israel.
00:38:49.664 - 00:39:17.618, Speaker C: Yeah, nobody wants that, even if you don't care about the Middle east at all. And it's just not part of your reality. That's just. That's just going to draw in a lot of problems. So, yeah, I think it's like, the geopolitical aspect of bitcoin, it has never been more relevant, especially in. Especially in the developing world. The meme coin thing, it's the best casino in the history of the world.
00:39:17.618 - 00:39:47.090, Speaker C: Your odds are better than betting it all on double zero. Like, I get that. And, yeah, you know, we don't need to beat a dead horse, but everything else in between is a bit of a head scratcher, maybe. Avi, you know, both of us tweeted out. Both of us tweeted out, like, what should we talk about this week? Should we do a lightning round where, like, I ask you questions that people replied to yours, and you asked me questions that people replied to mine, and we try to answer in, like, short, short little sound bites.
00:39:47.242 - 00:39:52.414, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it. Okay. So, jonah, what do you think about the death of nfts? Why aren't nfts doing well?
00:39:52.574 - 00:40:07.614, Speaker C: I think that blur just brought in. You know how, like, Cardano doesn't go to zero. Right. I think blur made the bad NFT project go to zero. The fads go to zero. Like, they brought some liquidity in there, some selling. They made it possible.
00:40:07.614 - 00:40:28.954, Speaker C: Right. And so anything that's blurable got blurred, you know, that obviously didn't hurt the best projects or the grails. Like, fucking crypto punk traded for $16,000,000.02 weeks ago. But I think that's why they're getting torched, because finally somebody figured out a way to devalue worthless things. I don't know. What do you think?
00:40:30.534 - 00:41:08.454, Speaker A: Yeah, I also think that meme coins just took the wind out of the sales. I think the meme coins are the nfts of this cycle. Right? They offer you community, they offer you outsized returns. They are highly correlated to the performance of the base asset. All these things are reasons why people bought nfts in the first place and people were using nfts to just massively speculate on them. And then I think what ended up happening is that meme coins just took the wind out of the sales for these guys. Even the NFT projects that are doing really good work, pudgy Penguins is actually building a real brand.
00:41:09.210 - 00:41:14.038, Speaker C: Yeah, new. I saw them in a, like a department store for sale.
00:41:14.206 - 00:41:34.904, Speaker A: They're building. They're building a real brand. And I think that they're going to be around for a very long time. But the issue is that the crypto native people just aren't, aren't buying them. And those are the only people that are, that are interested right now. So I do think that there's probably going to be a renaissance at some point in the next six months. That would be my, at least that would be my guess.
00:41:34.904 - 00:42:01.946, Speaker A: And so I like holding onto large, good nfts. Squiggles, budgies, obviously I love my rock. I think crypto punks are going to do well. I think that we are going to capture the culture again at some point in the future. It's just a matter of time. But for now, they're not going to give you crazy returns. I really don't think blur hurt nfts as much as the market says that they did.
00:42:01.946 - 00:42:10.090, Speaker A: I think they did at the margin by providing liquidity, as you said. But I think the prices would have been reached anyway. People would have sold anyway.
00:42:10.242 - 00:42:27.774, Speaker C: Yeah, it just would have taken a, it would have been like a slow bleed instead of like a quick price discovery followed by equilibrium type thing. Here, I got one for you. Price targets for potential dips to buy and levels for take profit.
00:42:28.924 - 00:43:46.126, Speaker A: Well, these people, they just want to plan, huh? So one thing, I mean, I actually think this is the 66k level is a good level to play for a bounce. I think that it's very likely that we range between 60 and 70k for a bit. And so my view here is you probably, I hope you de risked a little bit around 70k because what you see in the chart right now and what you see in the market is that when we first hit 73, we sold off really hard back down to 60, we came back up and now we've rejected again at that 70k level. Normally what you want to do is if you go to the daily chart, look at starting on Monday, March 25, you see a green candle and there's a wick and the next day there's a wicked, and then the next day there's a wick and then the next day there's a wick. So you get four different days in a row where you can't break through a certain supply level. And that should tell you, okay, maybe there isn't enough buying pressure to get through this particular level and that the crazy bid that occurred before isn't here anymore. And so you should start to think about de risking in those types of situations.
00:43:46.126 - 00:44:24.012, Speaker A: And so now you have an even greater reason to de risk. So the reason that I think that it's possible we could, you know, trade down to 52k from here and that would be my, you know, if we trade 52k, that's my, I'm fucking buying the shit and I'm going, I'm going in, I'm going ham going shopping. I'm going, I'm going shopping. At 52k is we have a few things happening. One is we finally have our first lower lower high. So if you just look at the, if you just look at the chart youll see that pretty simply. The second thing is were in the process of breaking the trend line thats been active since 40k.
00:44:24.012 - 00:45:01.824, Speaker A: So youve just been steadily climbing. And what these two things are telling me is that weve finally reached a point where people are willing to offload enough supply to counteract the inflows. And that bitcoin can get very reflexive on the way down. There are a lot of people sitting on unrealized profits right now. When you look at a market like this and you think to yourself, well, it's going to be pretty hard to get over 73k. That makes the risk reward really bad for holding. And so you generally tend to drift towards places where it's difficult to figure out a risk reward.
00:45:01.824 - 00:45:45.564, Speaker A: And right now it's easy because look, you have really, the next support level is at 50, as at 53k you kind of have one at 62. But it's been tested too many times and I think a lot of people bought those levels already. And so the area that makes the most sense that is quote unquote tough to determine what. Tough to determine whether it's good or bad. Risk reward is just smack dab in the middle at that 61k level, you know, then you have that 73k top and the 52k bottom. And so I think that's probably where we just end up for a bit. We probably get stuck there for a while.
00:45:46.064 - 00:46:12.468, Speaker C: I have a slightly different take than you. I think that's super interesting. You were the voice of reason when we hit all time highs. You were like, it probably makes sense to take a little off trade around the position. I was just euphorically bullish. I didn't expect this. But what I would say is, I think to the downside, yeah, if we trade down to 50k, it's time to go shopping.
00:46:12.468 - 00:46:34.056, Speaker C: You close your eyes and you buy with both hands. Around here, I think you're supposed to look for. Also, if we're down at 50k, maybe you try to buy some Solana, if it's around 150 or something. I don't know about ETH. Bitcoin and Solana are probably what you buy. To the upside.
00:46:34.160 - 00:46:38.856, Speaker A: I thought we were Mister ETH bull. What happened? Don't want to buy any ETH.
00:46:39.000 - 00:46:41.888, Speaker C: I'm Jonah. I don't know.
00:46:42.056 - 00:46:43.896, Speaker A: Did I dare fudge you too hard?
00:46:44.080 - 00:46:53.440, Speaker C: You may have. Dude, I'm long enough. Like, I'm. You've scared me. I don't want to buy more at this point. Definitely not selling any eat, though. Just hanging on to that one, I think.
00:46:53.440 - 00:47:26.724, Speaker C: Solana, I'm under allocated. So how about this? You buy bitcoin and you buy things that you're under allocated to. Like, in my case, Solana, if you're like, long to your ears in Solana and you don't have any ETH, maybe you buy some ETH on a pullback to 50k as well as bitcoin to the upside. I just think it's insane to sell before the having. And like, I think we've, you know, you're talking about these wicks, the gut. Like, we got our answer on why it's. Why it's wicking.
00:47:26.724 - 00:47:59.034, Speaker C: Like, the government has shown up with their Silk road bitcoin and they're just, you know, funding America's operations, paying for bridges that fell into the water and government salaries and stuff. Like the Silk Road bitcoin is hitting the market here, it seems, so they're sending it to Coinbase. So ultimately you've got a big seller. You've also got lots of buying the market's kind of between a rock and a hard place. And then the halving's coming up and the miners are going to have literally half as much selling to do. So stock and flow dynamics, I think should bring us to higher levels. I don't really see.
00:47:59.034 - 00:48:31.870, Speaker C: I don't have a take profit level in price space. I have it in Mvrvz space. Mvrvz, for those of you who aren't aware, is a Z scored. That is like number of standard, like standard deviation striated like metric where you look at the market cap of bitcoin divided by the realized cap, which is defined as like the price at which all the Utxos were spent. Volume weighted realized price. Go look up the blog post. I don't really know how to articulate it.
00:48:31.870 - 00:48:54.514, Speaker C: This is like a mathematical equation. It's a really good predictor of cycle lows and cycle highs. When Mbrvz gets to seven, that's when I'm going to be selling ass loads of bitcoin. I see no reason to pick a price ahead of that. You have to watch where the transactions get spent so you can determine that realized value. So that's kind of how I'm thinking about it.
00:48:55.374 - 00:49:09.718, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Definitely a good long term approach. I think these metrics are good, are good for trying to time cycle tops. And I'm by no means calling the top of the cycle, but I am saying that the next three weeks are going to be pretty shitty.
00:49:09.806 - 00:49:10.414, Speaker C: Dicey.
00:49:10.494 - 00:49:16.924, Speaker A: Yeah, they're not going to be good. So if I'm you, I'm consolidating my gains.
00:49:17.094 - 00:49:25.124, Speaker C: So that brings me to a great lightning round question. Some guy tweeted at you, where are we in the cycle?
00:49:25.704 - 00:49:43.684, Speaker A: We are inning seven. That's my guess. I think, you know, we're sorry. Inning. Inning six. What I would say is that we probably don't get. We probably don't get past 100k until the end of the year.
00:49:43.684 - 00:50:12.706, Speaker A: So I think what ends up happening is that we have the sell off. This probably lasts for a month or two. Then we make a run up to 80 to don't think that we break one hundred k the first time that we get close. I think that too many people come in sell off. Then we get another few months of, then we get another few months of sideways. And then some point next year we break through that 100k level, we have a crazy run, maybe up to 100, 2131, hundred and 40. And then that's it.
00:50:12.706 - 00:50:14.894, Speaker A: And then we're done. That's my bet.
00:50:15.714 - 00:50:21.378, Speaker C: Do the memes participate. Once we break through eighty k, I.
00:50:21.386 - 00:50:44.334, Speaker A: Think memes just continue to run for the next six months, but with multiple 80% drawdowns in between. Right. So, for example, if bitcoin trades 52k, which I think there's a reasonable chance it does, in the next two months, every meme is going to be absolutely destroyed, and that's actually probably a really good time to start buying them.
00:50:45.114 - 00:50:49.922, Speaker C: Interesting. And where. Where does all the money get made? Which innings does all the money get made? Like, let's.
00:50:49.938 - 00:50:54.354, Speaker A: Let's say, dude, a lot of the money was made already, I think.
00:50:54.474 - 00:50:59.474, Speaker C: I don't think it's crystallized. I think it's. It's still sitting in there, but we still need.
00:50:59.514 - 00:51:18.684, Speaker A: We still need our. We still need our crazy AI bubble. Like, we need our first AI coin to hit 50 billion, as people think it's, you know, as people think it's a future. And I think we need doge to probably hit 50 to 75 billion. We need doge to test all time highs. And then I'll start to think about taking off a lot.
00:51:19.464 - 00:52:10.734, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm just. I'm, like, heavily fixated on Mbrvz, but I'm sure there are better ways to do this, and you probably know what they are. I mean, this has been a weird cycle. Like, the sell off was so ferocious and all encompassing and terrifying and, like, sprinkled with regulatory jalapenos that fucking burn your face off if you try to take a bite. And then it just came roaring the fuck back, like, so quickly. I can't help but wonder if this isn't going to conform to the normal psychologic of havings and four years, two of which are bear, two of which are bullshit. This one feels like it could be a little runt cycle characterized by crazy meme coins, then another sell off of apathy, followed by a plateau of enlightenment where real world use cases start to tick off.
00:52:12.874 - 00:52:31.194, Speaker A: I think that's probably right, actually, I tend to agree with you that we're probably past the idea of cycles. We've graduated from this, and what we're going to see is we're just going to see a slow, consistent growth from bitcoin over the next five years, with a lot of -40% drawdowns in between.
00:52:33.454 - 00:52:35.794, Speaker C: Long and strong. It's the way to play it.
00:52:36.214 - 00:52:38.674, Speaker A: Long and strong. Buy 52k with me, boys.
00:52:40.854 - 00:53:03.586, Speaker C: Maybe we could close on a brief anecdote. My one artwork splurge. There's this guy, Bran Simonson. He's an example british marine guy. Who got shot with an AK 47 in Afghanistan, and now he's an artist. He covers weapons and butterflies, and they're pretty awesome. Check them out.
00:53:03.586 - 00:53:53.184, Speaker C: Bran Simonson. Anyway, he was asking me for crypto trading advice, and my advice to him was, stick to what, you know, like, don't try to develop a side hustle, like day trading meme coins or. Or attempting to hop onto this or that technology narrative. And if it got me thinking, like, how do we develop an edge as traders of this market? And ultimately, what I got him onto was memes, because that's something that, as an artist, he can understand. And he can also sell his artwork for ETH or bitcoin or whatever, and just, like, stay long. Cause he understands price appreciation from developing artwork. All of the software, heavy stuff in the middle, l two s, like arbitrum, optimism, polygon.
00:53:53.184 - 00:54:25.480, Speaker C: Like, he's not. I advised him away from that, and I was just thinking, like, maybe as crypto traders, we should all try to find, like, something we can relate to, to trade, because it's often, there's so many little pockets of this space that are just a bit spooky and hard to understand. My brain starts to melt with the AI and the software stuff. I don't get it. But holding on for dear life and the commodities angles, like, I can totally get that. And memes, like, you know, as a podcaster, learning from you, Avi, like, we are starting to understand viral a bit. So meme coins make sense.
00:54:25.480 - 00:54:26.120, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:54:26.192 - 00:54:43.872, Speaker A: What's your area ever. Ever. I don't. I don't know if I can follow it up, followed up with much. But, I mean, for me, look at the. At the end of the day, I got into this because I think that crypto has the opportunity to change the world. And so I do spend a lot of time thinking about the actual real applications of this space.
00:54:43.872 - 00:54:59.294, Speaker A: I'm just a trader, and I'm cognizant that my job is to make money, and I need to go where the money is. So I pay attention. I research, I look, I invest. But at the end of the day, right now, I'm a trainer. And so that's why I'm not super invested.
00:55:00.234 - 00:55:09.682, Speaker C: Well, stay safe out there, everybody. It's getting choppy. None of this is investment advice. Be careful. Do your own research. And, Avi, great talking to you, man.
00:55:09.858 - 00:55:11.594, Speaker A: Pleasure talking to you, too, Jenna. Take care.
