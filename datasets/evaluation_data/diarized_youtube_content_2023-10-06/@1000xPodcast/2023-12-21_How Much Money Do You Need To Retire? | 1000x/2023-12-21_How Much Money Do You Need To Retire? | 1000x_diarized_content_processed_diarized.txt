00:00:00.200 - 00:00:10.886, Speaker A: So I put out a joke tweet about how you need $20 million to retire, and a non trivial amount of people responded to that, and they go, yeah, I agree with you. And that's just completely insane, isn't it?
00:00:10.910 - 00:00:11.534, Speaker B: Bananas.
00:00:11.614 - 00:00:25.846, Speaker A: I think a little bit of crypto is escapism to people. It's. This is. This is my lottery ticket to financial success. But that is a very dangerous mindset, because you're going to do risky things to get to that number that you think you really need.
00:00:25.950 - 00:00:45.594, Speaker B: The lesson there is, if you. If you target a certain p and l and trade to make a certain amount of money, you're going to lose. Trade what the market gives you. So you have to take what the market gives you, keep your eye on the ball, and not be so afraid of losses that that's what you focus on. It really involves a lot of discipline.
00:00:53.614 - 00:01:17.770, Speaker A: All right, welcome back to another episode of Thousand X. We are filming this at the top of the market at 42K. It is the top for many reasons, but one of them is my engagement on my tweets this week. It's just been ridiculous. Jonah. I tweeted, like, most of my tweets are kind of tongue in cheek. I mean, I really hope nobody takes them as gospel or very, very seriously.
00:01:17.770 - 00:01:32.008, Speaker A: I kind of just try to have fun on Twitter. You know, my real thoughts are here. Every now and then, I'll post real thoughts to Twitter. But sometimes I just like watching what people do with, you know, statements. And so I tweeted out, I mean.
00:01:32.056 - 00:01:33.952, Speaker B: Like, it's true, but, like, not, you.
00:01:33.968 - 00:01:56.504, Speaker A: Know, it's true, but I tweeted out dog coin. Like, animal coins right now. Like, dog with hat. Cat with hat. I wish, I wish. I wish my mom could see me now. I mean, ironically, she can.
00:01:56.504 - 00:02:14.824, Speaker A: I'll send her the link. But I tweeted out that it's like being in a casino where the slot machine is 55% to win. You just abuse that button until it stops working or until you get kicked out of the casino. I tweeted that basically at what I thought would be the dog top.
00:02:19.254 - 00:02:36.366, Speaker B: You know. You know what's crazy about this market? Like, everybody's a fucking genius now. Everybody knew that Solana was gonna rip to the seventies. Everybody knew that dog Wi Fi, hat Sonic the hedgehog was gonna fucking make them rich, right? And when I look at.
00:02:36.430 - 00:02:41.062, Speaker A: Can you. Can you, like, put some respect on the name? Sorry. Dog with hat.
00:02:41.238 - 00:02:42.798, Speaker B: Dog with hat.
00:02:42.846 - 00:02:49.938, Speaker A: No whiff with dog with hat. There's no dog whiff. Hat it's with a hat, you know?
00:02:50.026 - 00:02:50.506, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:50.610 - 00:03:03.474, Speaker A: You don't have a hat? I don't have a hat. Actually, I do have a hat. Not a hat. I guess cover out. Spotify. Can't see this, but cover. That's a good hat I got.
00:03:03.474 - 00:03:14.522, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a. It's a great hat. I got it. There's this restaurant at the top of a mountain in Puerto Rico called Aventura. Four x four. You can only get there if you have a four by four. Name speaks for itself.
00:03:14.698 - 00:03:17.954, Speaker B: Do you have a four by four? Is the. Is the million dollar question.
00:03:18.074 - 00:03:29.306, Speaker A: Of course I have a four by four. Are you kidding? I drive. I drive. I drive a Ford Bronco SAS Wildtrak package. Why. Why would I drive anything differently? I mean, that thing is a beast. Comes with 32 in stock tires.
00:03:29.490 - 00:03:39.934, Speaker B: Avi, it's starting. I don't want it to feel frothy. I want this to be a nice, sustainable rally that gets us all rich for another four x or five x or. But, man, it is.
00:03:40.434 - 00:03:41.250, Speaker A: This is.
00:03:41.362 - 00:03:42.586, Speaker B: This is frothy to me.
00:03:42.610 - 00:04:09.964, Speaker A: There's like, no way this continues, jonah. I mean, there's no way this is. I'm just sitting calling it. I'm calling it now. You know, one of the top signals is when you're sitting here with your buddies and you're giggling about the names of the coins that have just hundred x in a week. Not, not, not two x, not five x, not ten x, not 50 x, you're giggling at the name of a coin that is 100 x in a week.
00:04:10.464 - 00:04:16.696, Speaker B: There was 1000 x. I think it was the dog whiff hat one that 1000 X. Oh, did it?
00:04:16.800 - 00:04:25.952, Speaker A: I mean, I know, like, it had to have thousand x because it came out small, but I think it did. How long did it take? 1000 X? I thought it's been around for like ten days or something like that.
00:04:26.048 - 00:04:54.750, Speaker B: Yes. I mean, at this point, you know, if you're. If you're trying to pay attention to crypto, crypto and you have been asleep or just uninterested during the whole bear cycle, and now you're kind of waking up and getting back in and you're looking at crypto Twitter and you're like, oh, wow, Jupiter's going to do an airdrop. Oh, wow. I should be buying a saga phone to try and get some airdrop tokens. Oh, wow. All these people who claim to be rich are talking about all this airdrop money that just landed in their account that they're not liquidating.
00:04:54.750 - 00:05:14.424, Speaker B: I think in the absence of an actual use case. This just feels like froth to me, and like, sorry, not an actual use case, a new use case. Something that some, some tech unlock that's occurred in crypto. And to me, it's. It's getting frothy. I'm nervous.
00:05:14.544 - 00:05:41.484, Speaker A: Here's my bear argument, jonah. This is, this is my, this is my, you know, as they say, dumb bear argument. Well, what drove this rally? It was speculation on the ETF. All right, so now I'm pulling up data on the CME, and what you can see is that on October 11, there was 1.89 billion in open interest on the CME. We actually had a peak of open interest on December 7. We got to 5.11,
00:05:41.484 - 00:06:07.620, Speaker A: and now we're down to 4.71. We've hit a plateau of trad five front running the ETF. So I think the people that are ready to buy on the news are basically just the algo traders and the actual inflows. But you have at least 3 billion just looking at CME. I don't. You. Let's discount it by half.
00:06:07.620 - 00:06:29.320, Speaker A: Let's say 1.5 billion is front running flows, all from traffic that are looking to exit on the launch of an ETF. Okay, so now you have 1.5 billion you're selling. That's probably going to happen in the course of a week, if not sooner. And then you have a bunch of people outside that, that are looking at this and going, well, I'm going to sell once they start selling, and you're actually already seeing it. I mean, the open interest is down 400 million on the CME over the last.
00:06:29.320 - 00:06:41.644, Speaker A: Over the last ten days. You have a ridiculous amount of froth in the market. You know, bitcoin has gone sideways for the first time, consolidating for the first time since 25k. Really?
00:06:42.424 - 00:06:43.052, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:43.168 - 00:06:48.164, Speaker A: And you have. Funding rates are not crazy. Elevated, but they're elevated.
00:06:48.324 - 00:07:02.876, Speaker B: Those CME futures you're talking about, you can clip 15% to 20% annualized percentage yield, no problem in this market. It's pretty crazy to me. That just shows you that there's not enough crypto native shops out there to do spot versus futures.
00:07:02.980 - 00:07:18.660, Speaker A: I think you have to start getting on the sidelines now. If you're not on the sidelines, you're going to be in some. I think you could be in for some pain. I think a very easy way to get back in is just to start buying above 44. If.
00:07:18.692 - 00:07:44.102, Speaker B: If you're wrong, I'm not doing anything right now. I'm just holding on to my core longs. I did not participate in a lot of this. Like, I almost, I almost clicked on bonk. I really liked bonk. I didn't, though. And if, if I had, and if I were holding a bunch of shit dog coins or frog coins or bitcoin ordinals that are like BRC versions of ERC, 20 tokens, like, I would be selling those.
00:07:44.102 - 00:07:46.350, Speaker B: But I'm not that kind of trader.
00:07:46.542 - 00:07:59.074, Speaker A: I think it's tough to buy those with any, with any real size, anyway. You can make 100k. You can make a mil. You can't put 5 million of these things turn into 50. I guess bonks. You kind of could. But anyway, that's besides the point.
00:07:59.074 - 00:08:34.082, Speaker A: It's not, but sadly it's not. And I didn't do it. But, I mean, now is, there are people out there that have very sophisticated models for tracking these meme coins, okay? You have to understand them. I'm only, you know, I'm not kidding. There are people that scan the mempool for new contracts, see if liquidity is locked in, whatever pools are published. Compare against a database of all of the contracts that they know to be rugs. Compare against a bunch of phrases that they know to be thing.
00:08:34.082 - 00:08:54.770, Speaker A: It'll be rugs. And then immediately, immediately snipe if it, if it looks good. Um, you know, you can ingest Reddit data. You can ingest Twitter data to, to basically track the activity of these coins. There's, there's sophisticated operations out there that are pumping these things. Um, and then every now and then, you get a coin that breaks over into the mainstream. Like tech Bros.
00:08:54.770 - 00:09:06.756, Speaker A: Silicon Valley bros, for some reason. Um, they really like dog with hat. Like, I saw a few people tweeting about it. They're like, this is really funny. Which I guess, you know, makes sense. Their sense of humor isn't great.
00:09:06.900 - 00:09:10.268, Speaker B: So why is it always a dog?
00:09:10.316 - 00:09:10.732, Speaker A: Can you.
00:09:10.788 - 00:09:11.812, Speaker B: You're a crypto native.
00:09:11.908 - 00:09:16.164, Speaker A: Why? No, no, they're their cat. They're cats now, too, I think. You know, it's cat. Cat.
00:09:16.204 - 00:09:44.948, Speaker B: Yeah, but the big ones are always dogs. Listen, avi, like, here's what's amazing to me about crypto. When I was professionally, you know, trading crypto every day, you know, I would interview a lot of candidates for crypto jobs. Crypto trading jobs. And you talk to these people. Some of them are absolutely brilliant. And they've been doing some pretty advanced sort of systematic trading type research from their dorm rooms or just wherever the heck they were hiding out.
00:09:44.948 - 00:10:12.884, Speaker B: They'd have a day job. Then they'd spend all night doing the sort of, like, mempool scanning type systematic analysis of meme coins that you talked about, uh, back in the, you know, two years ago. It was like people just building mev bots and side projects that were, like, generating sustainable income for these kids. I was blown away when I was going into crypto from commodities. I'm like, this market is frontier. Everybody's going to be absolutely idiotic. Like, there's not going to be much systematic stuff going on.
00:10:12.884 - 00:11:03.030, Speaker B: And in reality, like, when I got there, I was blown away by the sophistication of some of these young tech nerds who are building, you know, systematic and quantitative strategies to trade crypto. It was actually competitive. Meanwhile, you look at the institutional side of things in assets like commodities or, frankly, CME futures. In bitcoin, you can clip an easy 15% to 20% just buying spot versus selling futures. And coming back to the commodities market right now, what I'm realizing is there's a pretty low hanging fruit here, because none of those kids care about jet fuel or gasoline, right? They all want to trade frog coins. So I think just to wrap up this thought, what I'm realizing is, like this, you know, two things. Thing number one, in crypto, if you're going to day trade, you've got to be sophisticated.
00:11:03.030 - 00:11:41.730, Speaker B: It's not a market for idiots anymore and hasn't been for a long time. And thing number two, if this world of futurized, you know, institutional grade products like CME, bitcoin futures, and literally anything related to commodities has still has so much low hanging fruit, I think what it tells you is that the walled garden of the CME and many of these other big exchanges just isn't inclusive enough. And maybe that speaks to Crypto's mission of sort of democratizing finance. I think it's kind of unfair that only a few people can touch some of these commodities and touch bitcoin futures. Otherwise there wouldn't be this yawning basis. Arp, it's literally arbitrage. It's risk free.
00:11:41.802 - 00:12:18.006, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, basically, anybody that wants. Anybody that wants to touch it, or anybody that can touch it right now, they're trading other things, they're in other places, which I think that what that tells you is just how much froth, how much perceived froth there is and how much actual fraud there is. Because what you have to do as a participant, you have to. Where should I put my capital? What is the best use for my capital? And when you have something like basis trade at 25%. And there are a lot of people voting with their feet and they're saying, not good enough. Sorry, I'm not, I'm not going to close it.
00:12:18.006 - 00:12:38.994, Speaker A: I'm not bringing that to 20. That tells you the mindset that bringing it to zero, it tells you how allocated people are. And, yeah, it's just a, it's, it's a very, it's a very disconcerting thing. I mean, you know, my, my view, bitcoin always tends to top, by the way, in December or January.
00:12:40.234 - 00:12:43.494, Speaker B: Except for this January. This January, it just ripped.
00:12:45.514 - 00:13:03.986, Speaker A: Yes, this January. But that was, you know, after. Right. Like after, after a really bad year. I'm saying, you know, if you rally until the end of the year, I do think that over the next two weeks, people are going to take some time off. Liquidity is going to dry up. Everybody that's allocated for the ETF is probably already allocated for the ETF at this point.
00:13:03.986 - 00:13:39.358, Speaker A: If the ETF gets approved before January, I don't think people are making new allocations to the ETF until after January. That makes me think that Blackrock probably wants this thing to go live in January anyway. Fidelity probably wants this thing to go live. So my view here is pullback, reset, wash people out. And then you start to Giga rally. Because I've been thinking about this a lot recently. What does a post ETF world look like? It's very rare that you get the opportunity to launch an ETF like this with such a large consumer base.
00:13:39.358 - 00:13:57.598, Speaker A: It's so rare. And so there are a lot of people that are fighting for it. You have fidelity fighting for it. Blackrock's fighting for it. Vanguard. Right. And so what you probably are going to get, or you're going to get a lot of resources dedicated to winning the first month.
00:13:57.598 - 00:14:34.290, Speaker A: To winning the first two months. Because whats well known is that its an 80 20 rule with ETF's even more. Really, the biggest ETF will generally have 80 90% of the market shares. As liquidity begets liquidity, winning quickly is so important to everybody on this product because its going to be a money driver for them. Theyre probably going to market very hard in the beginning. Theyre going to be very, very, because if they dont, then they run the risk of losing and they run the risk of their product just never taking off, ever. So my view is that you're just cautious until you get a sell off.
00:14:34.290 - 00:15:14.134, Speaker A: And then whatever sell off, you get bitcoins at 37k, maybe 38. You start chipping in at 40, you know, like 39, you get to 35. Any, you know, every. Every step down, you just want to be loading the boat on your cycle bags and then post ETF, we should run pretty hard, because I think maybe we pop it into the ETF and then come off. But I think inflows are actually going to come in. I'm going to put my reputation on the line, risk it all, and say that there are going to be some pretty substantial inflows, more than we expect.
00:15:16.154 - 00:16:04.932, Speaker B: I think when we talk about those inflows, I hope that people out there go and listen to the previous episode of the Thousand X podcast. How much crypto should you own? I mean, I saw something recently in the news saying that 50 million Americans own crypto. That's a pretty pathetic percentage of Americans owning crypto. I think a lot of people are going to go look at what 2023 was like in markets, and they're going to say, wow, you know, the s and P did well, but bitcoin, wow, what is this? Best performing asset on the board by an order of magnitude? Maybe I should have one or 2% of my portfolio and that just in case. Oh, and there's this super easy way to do it. And I see a Blackrock commercial three times every football game. Like, maybe I should buy some.
00:16:04.932 - 00:16:23.734, Speaker B: So ultimately, I think you're right. I think the ETF will. You know, we've been saying this on this podcast for a long time. It's going to debottleneck a lot of. A lot of interest in bitcoin that can finally flow in. I don't think there's enough capital sloshing around in the little crypto space right now to front run that. So I do think it'll cause a run.
00:16:23.734 - 00:16:40.466, Speaker B: I'm just worried about the volatility of all this, because there is. Other than this ETF, there is nothing. Society is not using crypto in new ways. I think it will soon, maybe even next year. But until that happens, we're not. Like, it kind of is.
00:16:40.490 - 00:16:43.854, Speaker A: I mean, Solana is really picking up on the.
00:16:44.444 - 00:16:51.164, Speaker B: It's picking up on a narrative, right? Like, it's not picking up on a bunch of merchants all over the country adopting it for pay.
00:16:51.204 - 00:17:26.056, Speaker A: I think. I think that. I think that comes with time. I also know that what you're probably going to see in the beginning of 2024 is a lot of new applications are very likely to come out, just because I know Goldman's talked about launching. We've talked about this on previous podcasts, but there are a lot of people that are talking about launching tokenized products right now, and I think that's going to be a driver. They're probably going to use public infrastructure. They're probably not going to use their own internal infrastructure for now, or at least a fork of public infrastructure.
00:17:26.056 - 00:17:47.854, Speaker A: And so I think that's coming. And also just the user experience of Solana has gotten so much better. Swapping tokens, navigating, storing your wealth. It's coming. It's coming. And I think because it's actually quite nice and easy to use, mer, you know, merchant acceptances is also, is also probably likely coming soon.
00:17:48.014 - 00:17:50.958, Speaker B: David Saga phone Avi I don't, I don't.
00:17:51.006 - 00:17:52.822, Speaker A: Did you, did you, did you pick one up?
00:17:52.958 - 00:18:03.014, Speaker B: No, man, I'm married. I don't need to impress anybody with this crypto shit. I'm good. Got an iPhone, but like an iPhone mini, actually. Check it out. It's tiny, it's really light.
00:18:03.054 - 00:18:03.998, Speaker A: The Midi.
00:18:04.166 - 00:18:05.674, Speaker B: Yeah, it's.
00:18:06.254 - 00:18:06.830, Speaker A: But okay.
00:18:06.862 - 00:18:21.114, Speaker B: But yeah, yeah, I mean, at this point, like, I guess I'm kind of wondering, like, do we need a new use case spreading its tentacles into traditional worlds in order to sustain a crypto rally?
00:18:21.154 - 00:18:36.024, Speaker A: Because. No, I mean, I mean all we need for bitcoin. What? Like over here? Let me, let me, let me pose a question to you. Let's say in mid 2025, federal funds rate is one. Yeah, bitcoin seller down.
00:18:37.084 - 00:19:01.822, Speaker B: Look, you don't need to pitch me on big bullish bitcoin. I'm literally so bullish bitcoin, I can't see straight. However, watching what ETH did during the course of this huge rally and how fucking spectacularly it underperformed has made me wonder, like, hey, could we end up in a world where bitcoin just gasses higher because it has a true use case and a lot of these other things?
00:19:01.918 - 00:19:48.914, Speaker A: It's like, yeah, that's a fair point. On Ethereum. I think Ethereum is really in a really tough spot right now. I think that it will get a rally just out of. Because I think the narrative, again, will be the ETH ETF that comes out and that will happen. And you basically probably want to buy ETH BTC for a month or two months post that. But I think they're in just such a bad position because all these meme coins popping off on Solana have made people realize they have made people go to other chains, and it's made people realize just how much better the user experiences on basically every other chain that exists, including all the l two s on Ethereum.
00:19:48.914 - 00:20:04.284, Speaker A: And so I just think the propensity to launch products, the types of people that are going to go over and build on Ethereum, I think the world is a lot less ideological. The crypto world is just so much less ideological.
00:20:05.064 - 00:20:54.228, Speaker B: I think it's a very crypto native take. I think going back to the 80 20 rule you mentioned earlier, I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying, okay, so if the ETF's that garner most of the attention in the beginning wind up dominating, why wouldn't it be that the chains that have garnered most of the attention in the beginning of crypto gain long term adoption over the long run? Like, yeah, sure, using Solana is great. I'm sure Solana will be thriving for years, but Ethereum might too. The NFT ecosystem is built entirely on top of Ethereum base, the l two. There's tons of money getting pumped into that. That's on top of ethereum. Ethereum is like the security layer for information, decentralized information.
00:20:54.228 - 00:21:07.544, Speaker B: Just because it's getting left behind right now by one particular narrative, which is meme coins and degeneracy on Solana, just because that's going on right now doesn't necessarily mean that it's like the new state of crypto.
00:21:09.244 - 00:21:18.744, Speaker A: I just think that argument's tough when you're just not seeing a ton of innovation happening on heath, on ETH right now. And that fundamentally, if that's true, you're, maybe you're right.
00:21:18.784 - 00:21:20.112, Speaker B: I just thought you are fun.
00:21:20.168 - 00:22:12.306, Speaker A: Fundamentally, they've, fundamentally, introducing l two s weakens the value proposition for ethereum because unless, unless they really, really, really explode in the short term, the, you know, without l two s, ETH would have seen a much higher burn. With l two s, it's just going to see, it's just going to see a lower burn. And so basically what ends up happening is that it's a long path for transaction counts and user activity to catch up with throughput, throughput has been jumping. And then it's like a slow grind for transactions to catch up. It's not an instant fill. And so because it's not an instant fill, what you do is you just drive fees lower and lower and lower and lower and lower. Um, and a big part of the Ethereum narrative is people go and they watch the burn.
00:22:12.306 - 00:22:14.346, Speaker A: And so that has just been taken.
00:22:14.410 - 00:22:18.834, Speaker B: Out of, why should Solana rally? Solana fees are tiny, I think because.
00:22:18.874 - 00:22:21.570, Speaker A: Solana is deeply under allocated relative to Ethereum.
00:22:21.722 - 00:22:28.802, Speaker B: Okay, um, you're making me want to sell ETH BTC. You're making me want to rotate a lot of my ETH into just bitcoin. I mean, looking.
00:22:28.858 - 00:22:32.274, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, dude, I'd short this thing.
00:22:32.394 - 00:22:54.296, Speaker B: The lows are 0.02, and that was the local lows. And that was like the depths of COVID And then prior to that, prior to the sort of like, 2017 cycle, it was 0.02. And then. Yeah, just, man, if I'm looking at.
00:22:54.320 - 00:23:14.824, Speaker A: ETH right now, what I see is, I see a very easy, structured short, where you can short here, stop out above 0.056, and you're probably looking for 0.04 to 0.045. And that seems like a really good trade.
00:23:14.984 - 00:23:17.728, Speaker B: It's trending lower, too. It's smooth.
00:23:17.816 - 00:23:33.000, Speaker A: Yeah, it's trending lower. It's a time based trade. I would close it on the bitcoin ETF announcement. So, I mean, I think it's a good. It's a reasonably. It's a reasonably good trade. I mean, there's just not much interest right now in Ethereum.
00:23:33.000 - 00:23:42.680, Speaker A: And I think it's going to be very hard to get that interest back until people are willing to look at the next catalyst and people start filing for the ETF.
00:23:42.792 - 00:24:07.884, Speaker B: More seriously, here's a contrarian scenario for you. Let's say that ETH is just chopping around, going sideways, or doing a litecoin, like, becoming something forgotten, while bitcoin is just ripping. Will anyone care if an ETF launches? Will they want to buy into it? An ETF isn't necessarily a bully bullish catalyst. It's a bullish catalyst for something that people want but can't easily get.
00:24:08.704 - 00:24:12.016, Speaker A: I think it's a short term bullish catalyst. Okay.
00:24:12.120 - 00:24:16.992, Speaker B: You know, the futures ETF was a catastrophe. For what it's worth, I think the.
00:24:17.008 - 00:24:19.208, Speaker A: Futures ETF is just a bad product. Right?
00:24:19.376 - 00:24:20.392, Speaker B: Yeah, we agree.
00:24:20.568 - 00:24:58.024, Speaker A: So, I mean, it's hard to extrapolate from that. I mean, I think the likelihood that, the likelihood that ETH radically underperforms BTC over the next year is pretty substantial in my mind at this point. I think you could probably see. My best guess is that it bottoms around the ETF announcement. You see a 30% to 40% rally against bitcoin, and then it starts to peter out. If we haven't seen increased activity on Ethereum. Okay.
00:24:58.024 - 00:25:42.054, Speaker A: Realistically, the meme coin media and the NFT media on Solana is very different than what happened in 2021, where it was just all copycats kind of moving over from ETH, and then there would be the rotation play, and then Solana would pop and Avax would pump, and all these other things would pump. Avax hasn't. Avax is pumped, but it hasn't seen the same organic trading community and attention that Solana has seen over the last. Even though Avax has actually outperformed Solana, it just hasn't seen that organic community. And so it's not about the price action, it's about that organic community. That kind of worries me because that was always eat smoke is. They had such a strong community behind it.
00:25:42.054 - 00:26:07.774, Speaker A: The memes would launch, the NFTs would launch, they would attract. When new retail would come in, they were flipping. They were flipping stuff on uniswap. Now they're on radium. So there's just been this huge cultural shift away. And I think that moat is, you know, that that couldn't be understated for how important it was for Ethereum. And so now I look at Ethan, I go, man, they've kind of just got the ETF.
00:26:07.774 - 00:26:46.028, Speaker A: What you could see happen, because it always feels darkest, you know, before dawn is the ETF recatalyzes everything. And by the time ETH is up 30%, we're like, oh, why did we ever hate ETH? I mean, everybody's come back. Nobody's trading anywhere else. Again, meme coins are popping off because ETH is popping off, right? And so that's a reasonable potential outcome, but it has been degraded. Avax is a weird one. I do think that there's been a lack of meme coinery and there's been a lack of interesting projects on Avax. I think it just kind of pumped because people miss Solana.
00:26:46.196 - 00:27:00.344, Speaker B: I hate Avax. I always have. I don't get it. It doesn't make sense to me. It's kind of like the third best solution for literally any of crypto's use cases. At best or at worst, it's just useless. And here's what I don't understand about Avax.
00:27:00.344 - 00:27:28.008, Speaker B: They went all in on gaming. What the fuck is going on with that? Like, it feels like all the big games that are going to drop in crypto over the course of the next couple of years are going to happen on other chains. Like, I hear a lot about Ethel twos. I've heard about a couple on Solana. Where's this? Like, they made this big bet. Where's the payoff at this point?
00:27:28.056 - 00:27:53.460, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a very, very, very good question. I think the answer is that, um, yeah, they, they definitely, they definitely made a bet there. I think that they're pivoting a bit. They're trying to be the RWA chain now as far as I can see it. Of course they are, as everything else, you know, like obviously they're trying, they're trying to do that. You know, I like the Avax team. I think that they're, you know, I think that they're good.
00:27:53.460 - 00:28:17.792, Speaker A: I think that they're competent. I think that it's just a very crowded area. You know, I think that the l, the l one space is just very, just very very very crowded. And the reality is there's just not that many product developers. There's just not many that many project developers. So, you know, I view, I view Avax Matic. You know, all these, all these other, all these other l one s outside, outside Salana.
00:28:17.792 - 00:28:35.332, Speaker A: Solanath is, they're going to be good trades at some point. You can always trade them, right. Just look for, look for when they're, look for when they're under allocated, look for when they shorted. Look for what's correlated to the main, to the main runner, look for where transaction counts are trending up. But yeah, long term, I'm just not super constructive on them.
00:28:35.468 - 00:29:05.610, Speaker B: Me neither. I mean I'm trying to think long term as well. I agree you might get some volatility if you're paying close attention. You could probably clip a few nice trades out of it. But I'm kind of, in terms of long, long term, like two to five years, I'm pretty much ready to give up on, on Avax, on Nier, and I wouldn't give up on matic. To me that's more of an l two. But at this point I think the big alt l one s are probably not that necessary anymore.
00:29:05.610 - 00:29:22.384, Speaker B: You have the monolithic solution, which is Solana. You have the slightly more decentralized bit clunkier, but possibly more secure solution called ETH. And I think ETH will be the RWA chain, frankly. Like why would a vaccine be the RWA chain? Doesn't make any sense.
00:29:23.124 - 00:30:26.344, Speaker A: One reason specifically is for rwas. They just need, they need a lot more handholding, right? So if you want a lot more security, too lot security, hand holding. So if you, if you can introduce subnets on Avax, then it's, it'll be easier to onboard people from RWA perspective if you give them full control over that. Near is kind of a funny one. They've shorted for rebranded to AI and they've been pumping off that narrative because everybody loves crypto x AI. Yeah, it's the new big thing. I don't know, jonah, I'm curious, as somebody that used to run trading over at Cumberland, like what trading strategies? Cause you also, you're a programmer, you're a developer, like, what trading strategies would you be thinking about developing right now? Like what? You know, is there anything that you saw that worked last bull market or work work when things are ripping?
00:30:27.044 - 00:31:46.294, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, basically I would try to bucket things into similar categories, bucket tokens into similar categories, and then just play the catch up. So you could just basically take all of the l one s and when a certain percentage of the market cap of your basket has rallied a certain amount, then you can just place long bets on the rest of it. That might have worked in Avax and near doing these huge rallies on basically nothing, just following up on Solana. You know, that alt l one category, you know, compound Aave, those two tend to trade in step with each other over the long run, but not in the short run. So, you know, we've talked about these sorts of strategies on the podcast before where you just play for mean reversion in the pair in terms of like, broader trading strategies basis. Like, you know, obviously if you're retail and you're sitting at home, maybe you can't even touch futures, but even if you can, it's hard to really scale that trade. But at the institutional level, I don't know why there aren't 150 new companies coming in buying spot and selling futures with institutional capital.
00:31:46.834 - 00:31:48.614, Speaker A: Can you lever up that trade easily?
00:31:49.234 - 00:32:28.050, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, you can. And it's just arbitrage. It's a little bit harder when basis is negative because then you have to borrow coin to short. But right now, it's literally like you buy the coin, you sell the future, and selling the future, they make it easy for you. That's what the CME is there for. So that's not a very systematic trade, although there's some math and more involved thinking and when and where to scale into it other than just like, oh, the basis is high. I'm going to sell you leg into it with some discipline and some models and some systematic rigor.
00:32:28.172 - 00:32:31.590, Speaker A: What are, what are the models? What are you looking for?
00:32:31.782 - 00:33:34.374, Speaker B: You're looking at historical intraday ranges, intra week ranges, intra month ranges, and then you're sort of trying to say like, hey, if we're at one of these, define your extreme. This is where we've pre decided to add a certain amount of dry powder and deploy it into basis. And obviously, I'm not allowed to disclose anything about DRW's trading strategies, but this is just how anyone should think about a risk free cash and carry trade. You don't want to blow your entire wad when basis is widened out from 0% to 1%. So you kind of want to think about, hey, how wide a range has this thing traded in in the past? And maybe let me set some rules for myself, maybe even back test them. The back test is going to look great, obviously, because it's risk free arbitrage. So that's a trade that I'm surprised more institutions aren't doing right now.
00:33:35.314 - 00:34:33.396, Speaker A: One thing I always think about when I'm running these types of trades is when you go on the short leg on CME, or, let's say your short leg on binance or OKX, or anywhere else where you're trading a future, you're always going to be constrained by the fact that you, you're always going to be constrained by the fact that you might get blown out on the leg that you have leverage with, right? So, for example, you know, I have, let's say I have, I have $10 of BTC. I post $5 of collateral to go short that short that short that BTC, or I use that BTC as collateral, and I'm, you know, short short against it. You can't. You sometimes can do that, depending on the exchange. Sometimes you can't. You have to manage that leverage really effectively. But if you, if you have a no liquidation account, like what Alameda had, in theory, you can just print infinite money, right? Because, like.
00:34:33.396 - 00:34:40.348, Speaker A: Because, because they're there coins out there that. I mean, there are coins out there that would have 200.
00:34:40.396 - 00:34:45.452, Speaker B: They literally did print infinite money. They printed FTT yards and yards of it.
00:34:45.508 - 00:35:09.886, Speaker A: But, like, I like that. Losing money is. Should be a completely foreign con. If. If you have a no liquidation account in crypto, losing money should be a foreign concept to you, because all you do is you just buy the underlying scam asset. You know, you short the future against it, and sometimes you see blowouts of 100%, right, and then it'll come in and you'll make 100% a month. You're like, wow, that was simple and easy.
00:35:09.886 - 00:35:10.222, Speaker A: Wow.
00:35:10.278 - 00:35:11.678, Speaker B: Collected some nice funding there.
00:35:11.726 - 00:35:11.910, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:11.942 - 00:35:55.554, Speaker B: I mean, a no liquidation futures account. It's amazing, avi, just how much of trading boils down to having a lot of VAR and not getting stopped out, like some of the air quotes. Best traders I've ever met in my entire career. And these are guys with hundreds of millions of dollars in their bank accounts, or in a couple of cases, billions. They're not really doing anything that much more complicated than hanging on while everyone else can't. Right? And how did they get there? Maybe some political savvy. Maybe they were actually doing something smart in the beginning of their careers and their investors back them, uh, with, you know, no stop out type type funding.
00:35:55.554 - 00:36:05.298, Speaker B: Or maybe that's Sam Bankman fried and his Alameda crew of, uh, misfit clowns for a little while until they. They fucked even. Even that up. Um, you know, I don't know, man.
00:36:05.346 - 00:36:06.026, Speaker A: It's.
00:36:06.210 - 00:36:18.364, Speaker B: VAR is so important. VAR is so important. Just so you know, to anyone who's listening right now, uh, stay in the trade. Don't. Don't get thrown off the mechanical bull.
00:36:19.344 - 00:36:48.058, Speaker A: The one tweet that I sent out this week, that kind of. It made me laugh, but it was almost. It was almost concerning to see. So I think I'm going to write a tweet thread about this just because of how concerning it was to me. So I put out a joke tweet about how you need $20 million to retire. And a non trivial amount of people responded to that, and they go, yeah, I agree with you. And that's just completely insane, isn't it? In my, you know, you don't.
00:36:48.058 - 00:37:19.772, Speaker A: It's really about your lifestyle. And there are so many people that live happy, good, successful, productive lives, never making more than one hundred k a year, never making more than even, like, seventy five k a year. And that's, you know, I think a little bit of crypto is escapism to people. It's. This is. This is my lottery ticket to financial success. But that is a very dangerous mindset, because if you sit there like, let's say you have two hundred fifty k, and you sit there and you go, I need 20 million.
00:37:19.772 - 00:37:56.124, Speaker A: I need 20 million. That you're going to make bad decisions. You're just naturally going to make very bad decisions because you're going to do risky things to get to that number that you think you really need. What you should really. I think people just have to really understand, look, it's not, at the end of the day, it's not about the money. Not to get philosophical, but I've made many decisions in my life that optimized away from money, actually optimized for learning, optimized for happiness, optimized for health, and if I had three times as much money as it did right now, if I had chosen a different path I don't think I would be happier.
00:37:56.744 - 00:38:38.830, Speaker B: That's really important thing to mention. And also just taking it back to market theory for a second, pretty much the seminal book of finance that most people read, I guess you could say there are a few. There's liars, poker by Michael Lewis. But one of the big ones is reminiscences of a stock operator. Everybody reads that book, and it was written by a stock trader back 100 years ago on whatever the stock trading pit or floor in New York was called back then. I forget. Anyway, he shares this anecdote where he says, I saw this really nice fur coat and I wanted it, and I looked at the price and I said, okay, I'm going to go to work the next day and put on trades that'll make me enough money to buy this coat.
00:38:38.830 - 00:39:45.530, Speaker B: And then what happens is just a series of just one horrendous trade after another, and he loses pretty much all of his money. And the lesson there is, if you target a certain p and L and trade to make a certain amount of money, if you're trading to make a coat or buy something, a house, an island, whatever it is that you think you need, a lifestyle, you're going to lose. Trade what the market gives you don't trade like some aspirational, like, capitalistic outcome in your personal life. And equally, what I would add sort of a corollary to that theorem that somebody taught me earlier in my career and has made me a much better trader as a result of it, is if you trade to not lose money, you'll just lose money so much like you can't focus on trying to make a certain amount of money to buy something. With your day to day trades, you focus on the market, not on what you want to buy equally. You can't be so scared of losing money that you focus on trading to avoid losses. You're trading to make money, not to lose money.
00:39:45.530 - 00:39:55.982, Speaker B: So you have to take what the market gives you, keep your eye on the ball and not be so afraid of losses that that's what you focus on. So it's really, it really involves a lot of discipline.
00:39:56.078 - 00:40:13.630, Speaker A: And I think. I think once, once a month in this market, there's, there comes a trade where you look at it and you go, this is so obvious. And then you take it and you size, you size it correctly. You, you never want to. You never want to size it where you can, where you can blow yourself up. And the reality is that a lot of people want those quick hits. They want those quick wins.
00:40:13.630 - 00:40:31.904, Speaker A: Because they see everybody else getting them. And sometimes you can. Right. Sometimes you find a dog with hat and you put in $1,000 and it turns into 200,000. But those opportunities don't come along very often. You can't force those opportunities. A lot of people see that and they go, I really want to find the next one.
00:40:31.904 - 00:40:33.976, Speaker A: Sometimes. There is no next one. Yeah.
00:40:34.000 - 00:40:36.764, Speaker B: And if you'd go try the 100 x, your.
00:40:37.064 - 00:40:37.310, Speaker A: Your.
00:40:37.312 - 00:40:58.404, Speaker B: Your 200k that you just made on dog with hat on, the next thing, you'll probably fail. Right. Like, like you said, you can't make money out of thin air. So I guess. One other thing. Warren Buffett had this great quote. He said, most people want to get rich quick, and people just can't get their heads around getting rich slow.
00:40:58.564 - 00:40:59.108, Speaker A: He's really.
00:40:59.156 - 00:41:43.444, Speaker B: Right. Right. You kind of have to be comfortable making incremental gains sometimes if there's not a huge swing to take, and you can't always just get rich quick. But to your point about what it takes to live and to retire, if your goal is to trade crypto until you can have 2030, $40 million, and then retire with one to $2 million a year of expenses living La dolce vita in New York or Paris or something. Yeah, maybe that's how much it takes. But I don't think crypto should be anybody's ticket to that. Or certainly not anybody who's trying to actually get it right as opposed to people who are just playing the lottery.
00:41:43.834 - 00:42:12.646, Speaker A: Yeah. I also think that you just need to understand what actually makes you happy. Right. What makes you happy? Is it playing the game? Is it winning the game? Is it the money? Is it what it affords you? And then at a certain point, just recognize that everybody is on a hedonistic treadmill. But it's actually quite easy to step off. You just have to have perspective on it. So I know for myself, for example, could keep going until I can buy 747.
00:42:12.646 - 00:42:17.678, Speaker A: Do I want to? I mean, honestly, no. I'd rather wake up in the morning.
00:42:17.846 - 00:42:21.558, Speaker B: You know, 747s are pretty cheap now. I saw when it burning man, you.
00:42:21.566 - 00:42:23.062, Speaker A: Know how much they go for.
00:42:23.158 - 00:42:24.102, Speaker B: 787.
00:42:24.158 - 00:42:24.526, Speaker A: That's what.
00:42:24.550 - 00:42:25.110, Speaker B: That's what you want?
00:42:25.142 - 00:42:26.390, Speaker A: Said the dreamliner.
00:42:26.542 - 00:42:27.526, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:42:27.630 - 00:42:28.598, Speaker A: It's such a nice blind.
00:42:28.646 - 00:42:31.554, Speaker B: The dredral windows, you know, that they.
00:42:32.494 - 00:42:35.386, Speaker A: You know, I was going to say something really profound, jonah, until you cut me off.
00:42:35.550 - 00:42:36.826, Speaker B: Sorry. Keep going.
00:42:36.930 - 00:43:12.066, Speaker A: 900 million private Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Yeah, that's maybe. Maybe too expensive, but I was going to say I prefer to have my health I prefer to have my happiness because I think that some levels of success, they require sacrifice. I mean, that level of success requires a tremendous amount of sacrifice. You basically need to make your life entirely about your work. You need to be obsessively focused, and these are all admirable qualities, but they come with drawbacks. And I think you need, you need to get older, you need to be around these people, which I have been.
00:43:12.066 - 00:43:53.698, Speaker A: And that teaches you a lot about what you want your life to look like and what you can be happy with. There are people out there that can be happy with 5 million, there are people out there that can be happy with one. There are people out there that won't be happy with 20. But you have to make sure it's really you. It's not, you know, what your society is telling you or what people around you are telling you, or, you know, what you were, you know, what your original, what your original dream was versus what reality is. And so I guess, you know, I see this over and over and over and over. There are people out there that spend like 14 hours a day in front of their computer, like digging for things, digging for things in crypto at the expense of their health, at the expense of their relationships, at the expense of their life.
00:43:53.698 - 00:44:24.242, Speaker A: And I don't necessarily think that's a great, wonderful trade off. It can be if that's really, really, really what you want. But I think it's worthwhile having that perspective that it doesn't have to be that way. And by the way, I also think you can be successful in crypto working if you do this three to 4 hours a day. But you just actually focus. You just do what you need to do instead of spending 8 hours talking to people on telegram about the nonsense.
00:44:24.418 - 00:44:26.234, Speaker B: Or you build a process.
00:44:26.354 - 00:44:44.378, Speaker A: Or you build a process. I mean, like, come on. Like, I think. I think you could be ridiculously successful with the right. With the right, with the right alerts, with the right watch lists, with the right analytics tools, you probably can spend three or 4 hours a day on this and be in the top 1% of traders. I genuinely think that. I agree.
00:44:44.426 - 00:45:14.124, Speaker B: I mean, I think ultimately, if your passion is trading crypto because you're interested in the market and it gives you that little intellectual tingle, then it's definitely worth spending a lot of time on. If you're like, well, this is the amount of money I want to have. It's more than I have now. And crypto seems to be the thing that could go up the most. So it's probably my ticket. You know, I wouldn't necessarily recommend aping too much of your net worth into crypto, other than maybe bitcoin and just having it in the background.
00:45:14.704 - 00:45:25.170, Speaker A: I mean, bitcoin, it depends on your size. All right. Bitcoin is probably not going to get you anywhere. If you really want to make it big, like, if you want to take.
00:45:25.202 - 00:45:31.934, Speaker B: Yourself into a new category, maybe. But, like, I do think that in the next five years, bitcoin will. Five x from here.
00:45:32.434 - 00:45:49.966, Speaker A: Probably not going to change that. You know, I think people, you know, let's say you have five grand, right? What are you going to, what are you going to put your money in? Probably. Probably going to put your money in. You're probably just going to bet on a bull market and you're probably just going to put your money on things like, you know, the AI coins or bitcoin beta or Ord's.
00:45:50.150 - 00:45:52.062, Speaker B: Better odds than double zero.
00:45:52.238 - 00:45:59.606, Speaker A: Way better. Way, way better odds and double zero. I mean, that, that's a beauty. That's a beauty. This, this crypto. This crypto thing.
00:45:59.670 - 00:46:01.286, Speaker B: I take your point. I take your point.
00:46:01.390 - 00:46:32.344, Speaker A: It's a really good. By the way, I really like that analogy with the, for the fur coat. That's short, the story with the fur coat. It's so true. Like, anytime you have a goal in mind for your trading, what it forces you to do is it forces you to create opportunities where there might not be. Because in your mind, you're thinking to yourself, well, I want to hit this target. What is there that can help me get to this target? And the right answer might be, there's nothing right now.
00:46:32.344 - 00:46:52.910, Speaker A: But when you're in the mindset of looking for what will get me to that target, you find things, right? It's like when, you know, humans look around and they see faces and things, right? So if you're a trader, you will find a trade if you're looking for it. Yes. Right? Like, so what happens, here's a little.
00:46:52.982 - 00:47:39.944, Speaker B: Here'S a little systematic pearl of wisdom, like a nice rule of thumb to follow. So the one instance, the one exception to the fur coat rule where you can actually target a certain amount of p and l, is when you have a back tested strategy, right? You can say, like, all right, well, this thing seems to consistently work over time. Let me dial up the risk to try and make x in a year. And so here's the type of drawdown, this is the rule of thumb. Here's the type of drawdown you should expect if you're doing that sort of trading, that sort of systematic trading. So let's say that you're trying to make $1 million in a year with your systematic strategy, and it has a back tested sharp of 2.0. So your target, p and l, is 1 million.
00:47:39.944 - 00:48:18.520, Speaker B: You geared your risk until your target, p and l, is 1 million, and your back tested sharp is 2.0. So let's say your sharpe continues to be two as you trade. Let's just say that that's the sharp of your systematic portfolio. A one standard deviation peak to trough drawdown in your year to come is going to be your target, p and l divided by your sharp. So in this case, 1 million divided by 2.0. So you should expect sometime over the year to draw down from whatever p and l number you're at down 500 grand. That's like a one standard deviation p and l drawdown.
00:48:18.520 - 00:48:49.208, Speaker B: And so I sort of think, like, if you're actually going to try to go for the fur coat, which you probably shouldn't do anyway, you had better have rigorously back tested your trading process, adhere to it, and be super stone cold sober and mathematical about how much money you might see yourself losing at any. At any given point during the year. So, again, for a million, you know, to target p and l divided by sharp. And to me, that's like a really helpful way to kind of keep your head screwed on right when you're losing money and not do stupid shit.
00:48:49.296 - 00:48:55.536, Speaker A: Wow. What a. What a sober and thoughtful note to end on. Jonah. What we.
00:48:55.560 - 00:48:58.324, Speaker B: We started with the froth, so we got it.
00:48:59.494 - 00:49:13.394, Speaker A: We got to reel it in, you know. As always, it was a pleasure. A pleasure chatting. We went in some good circles this time. Yes, we did. So we'll. We'll see you next time, hopefully.
00:49:13.394 - 00:49:29.474, Speaker A: Actually, I guess that's going to be New Year's, so we might. We might push it until the new year. So this might be the last podcast for the new year. But, you know, we'll. We'll see. We'll see you guys soon, and we'll keep. We'll keep bothering everybody on Twitter, keep.
00:49:29.514 - 00:49:40.042, Speaker B: Pissing people off, and if you're upset or angry or you're feeling kind of bummed out this holiday season, just tweet some angry shit at avi. He takes it really well. Just troll him.
00:49:40.178 - 00:49:43.090, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm better at handling trolls than Jonah.
00:49:43.242 - 00:49:46.378, Speaker B: Yeah, I can't take it. I suck.
00:49:46.546 - 00:49:53.246, Speaker A: None of this is investment advice. It will never be investment advice. I'm bad at investing. Nobody should listen. Thank you.
00:49:53.270 - 00:49:54.718, Speaker B: Same ditto love you guys.
00:49:54.766 - 00:49:55.934, Speaker A: See you next time. Take care. Happy New Year.
