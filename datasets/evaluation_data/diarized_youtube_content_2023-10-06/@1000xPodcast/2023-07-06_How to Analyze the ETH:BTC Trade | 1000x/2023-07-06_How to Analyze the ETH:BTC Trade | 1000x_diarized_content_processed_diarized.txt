00:00:00.200 - 00:00:13.154, Speaker A: It's really as simple as when everybody's panicking, you buy. When everybody's euphoric, you sell. And I can guarantee you with 100% certainty that on ETF approval, everybody is going to be absolutely euphoric.
00:00:21.494 - 00:00:33.960, Speaker B: Hello, everybody. Jonah Nabi here. Welcome back to another episode of 1000 X. Thank you very much for. For tuning in with us today. I'm broadcasting to you live from London, England. Hello, Avi.
00:00:33.960 - 00:00:35.244, Speaker B: How are you, mate?
00:00:35.744 - 00:00:39.112, Speaker A: Doing all right? Jonah, is the price of bitcoin the same in London as it is here?
00:00:39.288 - 00:00:45.312, Speaker B: Weirdly, it is, but not at pounds. Pounds is a little bit lower. Below 30k, still low from the past.
00:00:45.488 - 00:00:57.384, Speaker A: Do you remember? Do you remember what? When was it? Was it last year? At this point, it feels like it was. It was recently, but it's. I know it's not. When the pound almost hit parity with the dollar.
00:00:57.964 - 00:00:59.420, Speaker B: Yeah, there was that.
00:00:59.492 - 00:01:02.804, Speaker A: There was that massive sell off because of the guilt. That was earlier this year.
00:01:02.884 - 00:01:22.534, Speaker B: No, that was 2022. The government did something stupid with pension and fund regulation. I forget what. The pound tanked and I had this rah rah, America. I'm american. Living in London mentality. Like, pounds just going to keep dropping and then it just ripped right back.
00:01:23.114 - 00:01:37.826, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember when it hit parity. It's funny how these things tend to work. It's like it's true in every single market. It's peak hysteria, peak panic, peak. Oh, my God. New paradigm. This time is different.
00:01:37.826 - 00:01:50.944, Speaker A: It's all over. That's always the bottom. It's insane. I remember. I do remember at a dollar, I was browsing real estate to buy you into everybody else.
00:01:50.984 - 00:01:52.272, Speaker B: That's why I bounced back.
00:01:52.408 - 00:01:52.656, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:52.680 - 00:01:59.164, Speaker B: I mean, London's an amazing, like, fiscal quasi haven for a lot of people around. Around the globe.
00:01:59.704 - 00:02:29.436, Speaker A: Not, not to. Not to talk about London real estate. Oh, yeah. That was September 30, 2022. My times are way off. But I remember back then as we were browsing real estate, everything ripped back and never ended up pulling it. But I was hearing, and maybe when I come join you in London next week, we'll go do some sniffing around that a lot of people in the UK have ten year mortgages as opposed to 30 year mortgages.
00:02:29.436 - 00:02:47.896, Speaker A: The rate is ten year fixed, not 30 year fixed. And so as rates go up, it's going to put a lot more pressure on the UK housing market than it does on the US housing market. And that they're already talking to some dealers. A lot of supply coming on. So maybe we should go house shopping together.
00:02:48.080 - 00:02:53.024, Speaker B: Yeah, we could be roommates. Sherman, my wife would be super happy about that.
00:02:53.184 - 00:02:55.272, Speaker A: Hey, honey. I'm sure she would love it.
00:02:55.368 - 00:03:24.718, Speaker B: Moving in with Avi last week, we spent a lot of time feeling pretty good, right? The price of bitcoin hit $30,000 token in the middle of our podcast for the first time in months. You know, we're both long. It was a, you know, it felt good. This time, why don't we take a moment to explore and learn from some of the worst traits we've ever done? So just to kick this off, Avi, what's, you know, or I can start if you want. What's, what's one of the stupidest, worst, or most costly traits you've ever done in your career? And what, how has it helped you become a better trader since then?
00:03:24.806 - 00:04:09.304, Speaker A: Every bad trade that you take is a tremendous learning opportunity. You know, sometimes, in my opinion, actually you learn the most from the trades that you messed up. I learned almost nothing from the trades that I won big on. Sometimes a little bit, but realistically, I just feel good. This was probably the biggest learning opportunity for me was back in 2019 when bitcoin ripped from three k. From three k to had done a very, very good job riding that wave. I was one of the larger participants on deribit at the time.
00:04:09.304 - 00:04:42.624, Speaker A: There wasnt a lot of options. Volume going through. Volume was tremendously mispriced. After bitcoin ripped from three k to just started buying upside, buying upside, buying upside. And I just ran up my account super hard. And then at 1314K, it was a little bit of recency bias. It was, hey, Ive made so much money buying these options and Ive made so much money exploiting this inefficiency that even though the inefficiency had completely gone at that point, I mean, Vol was trading plus 100.
00:04:42.624 - 00:05:41.984, Speaker A: In my mind, I was like, well, im really good at this and this has been a really good instrument and I think I can make a lot of money if I keep going. And so I just really took an absolute beating at the top in 14K because I was so exposed to upside calls. And I actually remember this one moment where I could have gotten out and I just thought about it in the wrong way. So I remember on the sell off from 14 to twelve, it was a pretty rapid sell off and fall. This was it on 2019. 2019 and fall on options in the sell off went up so much that despite going down 1015 percent in price, the value of my options only went down like five 6%, which is insane. Like, that was.
00:05:41.984 - 00:06:20.744, Speaker A: It was like a. Yeah, my calls, my calls, despite being going the wrong way with price, they stay the same price. And I looked at that and I thought, okay, that's a great opportunity to stay long because I haven't lost any money, so there's no reason to sell. And one thing that I've learned from that, and that's actually been a pretty phenomenal trade, um, over the last. Over the last few years, is anytime you get a massive short term spike in volume in the crypto markets, that is a 99% hit rate. Sell. Like.
00:06:20.744 - 00:06:35.412, Speaker A: And you say you can build those markets? Yeah, you can build. Well, you can build, like, you can build a model on it, right? Just look at the one day. What's a two three standard deviation move involved? If that happens, you're probably selling. You should probably sell.
00:06:35.548 - 00:06:36.156, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:36.300 - 00:06:42.540, Speaker A: It makes it even better when it's close to end of month. But it did teach me that trade.
00:06:42.612 - 00:07:16.884, Speaker B: That's a good example. Avi, thank you for sharing. For me, I think it's a bit of a. Well, put it this way. Earlier in my career, I was fresh out the gates, scared to lose money, and somebody finally gave me the advice, like, hey, Jonah, if you trade to not lose money, you'll just lose money. So trade to make money involves taking some risk and put yourself out there. So I was still a little nervous, and I spent a lot of time trying to really think things through before I dip my toes in, because, you know, I was.
00:07:16.884 - 00:07:47.880, Speaker B: Once you dip your toes in, you got. You got to be prepared to get wet. So I ended up getting a couple of things pretty right, namely Facebook stock and bitcoin and to some extent, crude oil. But I think I was a little bit. I would make 1020, 30, 50% on a little bit of money in my pa, and I would just take profit. I was like, wow, this is great. Then those things went up another hundred x or ten x in the case of Facebook, and I missed all of it.
00:07:47.880 - 00:08:33.218, Speaker B: So I thought, dang, I need to learn to ride a trend. And then that led to 2018, the worst trade of my career, which was conviction long crude oil dead right. The market was tightening, supply was dropping off a cliff. Everything was just going right for me. I was Max long at being a company with a lot of capital, a lot of risk tolerance, having the best year of my career very quickly. Then things just got better and better. Then Trump came in and basically got a little nervous about the price of oil because high gasoline prices nuke presidencies in election years.
00:08:33.218 - 00:09:12.572, Speaker B: And he went a little soft on Iran. He waved the sanctions for a bit, and I didn't adapt to that information. I stayed drum banging long crude oil because of all I'd learned about missing out on big trends. And I thought this was going to be a big trend. And I lost so much money, took me a year and a half to get back to my high water mark. And what I've learned from that and supplies that bitcoin and crypto traders all over the world should hopefully take a little bit of notice is like, you can kick yourself when you miss a big trend. You can kick yourself when you think there's going to be a big trend, and it snaps back in your face.
00:09:12.572 - 00:09:42.258, Speaker B: So the critical piece of analysis to do this is what I've learned ever since that 2018 implosion. My P and L is ask yourself whether you're on the break of some new technological or markets based unlock, or whether you're at the peak of a hype cycle that's going to revert because participants now perceive the asset that you've ridden to this point to be unattractive.
00:09:42.306 - 00:09:43.170, Speaker A: From a price perspective.
00:09:43.202 - 00:09:53.308, Speaker B: So bitcoin miners are saying, man, 30k, this looks like a level where we should really try to finance our business for years after what we've just been through. Let's sell everything, right?
00:09:53.476 - 00:09:55.588, Speaker A: Crypto could go straight back down equally.
00:09:55.676 - 00:10:11.464, Speaker B: If we're at 30k, because a Blackrock ETF is about to get approved and 20 times more capital is about to enter this market. Don't sell whatever you do. So I think that's what we got to debate for this podcast.
00:10:11.764 - 00:11:36.844, Speaker A: I think that you're going to learn a lot from studying previous bubbles, and you can learn a lot from studying previous trends. And one of the most important things that you can do, and probably the thing that's made me the single most money in my entire career, is being a student of history. Every single time I talk to an older trader or every single time I have conversations with people in this business who have been very successful, there are really two things that stand out to me. One is that theyve built themselves a tremendous intuition through many hours of just studying charts, information, balance sheets, data, theyve just built themselves tremendous intuition to the point where a lot of people look at, you know, a Druckenmiller or a Soros and they'll say, oh, man, how do they make that decision? How do they make that decision so quickly? How do they make the right decision? Why do they make that decision? And the reality is, a lot of it is just prior study. It's like, it's like when you're to bring it back to a previous podcast with Noah, it's like when you're wrestling, you just build muscle memory for yourself. Like you just do certain things in certain situations and you just know to do those things. And that just comes from practice and studying.
00:11:36.844 - 00:12:26.284, Speaker A: And then the second thing is that the things that they study the most is often history. It's often understanding what has happened in the past and how do I apply that to the future. I think just I'll drop some of my favorite books and then we'll put them in the link below. But I would probably read three. I would read the great game by John Steele Gordon, which is a history of Wall street, which takes you through every single, you know, every single scam that anybody on Wall street has ever pulled. No. They have anecdotes about how in the railroad boom, people would rename their companies to be the Long Island Railroad company and it would go up.
00:12:26.284 - 00:13:26.084, Speaker A: They have stories, they have stories about Jay Gould and his cornering of markets. They have stories about, there's one famous story where a guy who's known to have a hot hand on the street in the 1920s goes to a club, writes down a list of stocks to buy. He's at a club where a bunch of Wall street people go. He's there with his broker, he writes down a bunch of stocks to buy, hands it to his broker and tells the broker to accidentally drop it on the way out of the club. The broker accidentally drops it on the way out of the club and a bunch of people pick it up and they go, oh, this guy's had a really hot hand, let me go buy these stocks. And then he proceeds to sell it to them, right? So there are all these different anecdotes and funny things that happen. So the great game by John Steele Gordon, the Alchemy of Finance by George Soros, which I think is the best book in the world at teaching somebody how to play a bubble.
00:13:26.084 - 00:14:16.552, Speaker A: If youre in crypto, you need to read this book. Its like a seminal text of crypto. Despite being written many years before crypto is invented, it deals with the concept of reflexivity. And then the autobiography of Bernard Baruch, which is a phenomenal book that follows Bernard Baruch, who was one of the greatest traders of all time and was one of the people that successfully made a pivotal pivot into politics from trading and ended up being an advisor to FDR, just lived a fascinating life. So I think those books have really built a strong foundation for me in terms of developing my own personal trading style, which, just for the record, is generally waiting for big opportunities. And then when I find those big opportunities, pressing them hard and riding that trend.
00:14:16.648 - 00:14:25.840, Speaker B: Patience is hard. I think patience and discipline are too. Most important characteristics of any good trader, then they're related. But kind of book to your list, Avi.
00:14:25.872 - 00:14:27.244, Speaker A: Just one? Sure.
00:14:28.024 - 00:14:54.602, Speaker B: I would add the prize by Daniel Jorgen. It is the. Since you mentioned history, and these are history books, this is the thousand page, 150 year history of crude oil. And the reason why it's so important for crypto and, you know, traders in most markets, is that a commodity is tradable technology. Right. And crypto is also tradable technology, which is why I think that crypto is a commodity. Yeah.
00:14:54.602 - 00:15:29.264, Speaker B: There are many similarities between ETH and crude oil. Oil is deflationary. You can occasionally mine more, but every time you put a little bit of it in your airplane to go fly somewhere or bus to go travel somewhere, the global supply decreases. Gas is burned. Sure, there are scaling solutions that's the equivalent of know finding lore. But ultimately, it's a deflationary asset that you use to unlock value in some product or service, just like oil and oil in its early days. What you learn in this crude oil book, the prize is that it's got a Pulitzer Prize, by the way.
00:15:29.264 - 00:15:30.044, Speaker B: Very good.
00:15:30.424 - 00:15:31.192, Speaker A: Nice.
00:15:31.368 - 00:16:18.670, Speaker B: Is that back then, there was the barbell debate that we have in crypto today. Is it useful or is it a scam? Is it garbage? Same thing happened with crude oil back in the day when a bunch of Yale scientists were messing around with it. It was like, wow, is this the future? Are we going to be able to replace, place whale oil or kerosene, create kerosene and make light out of it? Or is it just a bunch of tar that bubbles out of the ground? Because there's literally that much of it, useless waste product. You look at the inflation adjusted price chart of crude oil in this book, and there's a wild swing. On an inflation adjusted basis, one of the highest, I think, if not the highest, the second or third highest price point ever reached was in the late 18 hundreds, and then it went down like 99% from there. And then, you know, so that's.
00:16:18.702 - 00:16:22.110, Speaker A: That's because. That's because they didn't hard cap at Jonah. They should have hard cap.
00:16:22.262 - 00:16:22.942, Speaker B: They should have.
00:16:22.998 - 00:16:41.702, Speaker A: No, they should have been like, oh, whoops. That. That's actually really fascinating that it was deemed. There were people that wrote it off as oh, maybe it's just black tar bubbling out. Might not actually be useful, that technology. Yeah, you never really, you never really think about things like that. But that's, that's fascinating.
00:16:41.702 - 00:16:42.598, Speaker A: That's great.
00:16:42.726 - 00:17:18.646, Speaker B: I liken the builders in the crypto space to the Yale scientists who are just sort of like, slaving away in their chemistry lab trying to refine it, basically. And it's not that hard. You boil it, take the steam, cool the steam back off, and you have kerosene, which flies jets and creates light. It's just distillation in crypto. It's like, does the world need a publicly owned spreadsheet? Yeah, probably it does. To me, this seems obvious, but to all the naysayers out there, it's kind of a. Well, why Amazon Web services do the same thing, you know? I don't know.
00:17:18.646 - 00:17:20.714, Speaker B: We should get a naysayer on the podcast.
00:17:21.014 - 00:18:07.824, Speaker A: I think at this point, the naysay, the people that hate this stuff just don't understand it. So it'd be like debating a flat earther. It's like, why, why, why even, why even debate? The thing is, all of the points, all of the, I guess this is like circular reasoning, because I was going to say all of the ballot points that they bring up, I agree with. But, like, okay, then obviously I'm dating the ballot, but I do think that a lot of the, a lot of the points. Okay, I'll give you an example. A lot of the points brought up around are utility tokens useful. It's like, well, the majority of them are.
00:18:07.824 - 00:18:27.718, Speaker A: Okay, but that's well understood by every professional participant in the asset class. It's like the majority. What gives bitcoin value? Nothing. It's the belief that it has value. That gives it value. And the fact that it's a better money on a variety of different metrics, that gives it value. But it's just, you know, there's, there's.
00:18:27.718 - 00:18:49.004, Speaker A: Yeah, you're right. There's nothing backing it. Okay, fine. Right. What is. Is crypto or is Defi better or worse than the traditional financial system? The people that say that the underlying tech of the traditional financial system is better than the underlying tech of Defi are delusional. There's no argument.
00:18:49.004 - 00:19:29.806, Speaker A: It's just not true. And the arguments that they might bring up are, okay, well, you can't Kyc, you can't aml, you can't have private. Well, you can build that on top of Defi. It just won't be the Defi that we see today. It'll be a very different version of it, but you can still build that and that can still exist and it will still be better built on the crypto stack. So, I mean, there are all these arguments that I think are just incorrect. Now, speaking of Defi, have you been paying attention to these defi 1.0
00:19:29.806 - 00:19:30.366, Speaker A: pumps?
00:19:30.470 - 00:19:40.034, Speaker B: Scratching my head a little bit. Even BCh ripped like 150% in the last few few days. What is going on here?
00:19:41.734 - 00:20:15.342, Speaker A: I do genuinely think that a lot of these things were just horrifically under owned. I don't think any. They were like, there's no speculative money in them. The only people that held them were the people that were holding, holding them for the long term. The only sellers were the people that were already holding, that were getting inflation, that were selling. And so I think that this is really less of a fundamental move. I dont think anything has changed fundamentally for DeFi.
00:20:15.342 - 00:20:46.682, Speaker A: I just think that it was this massive, effectively short squeeze and people woke up and they realized that they had zero defi exposure and that it's possible. I think one downstream, one downstream effect of the ETF getting approved is that some people are speculating that this is happening because the SEC is being told, hey, loosen up on crypto. I have no insight into that.
00:20:46.738 - 00:20:48.174, Speaker B: I don't hold bias, sir.
00:20:48.614 - 00:20:54.854, Speaker A: You know, the Biden administration, hey, loosen up on crypto. I have no insight into this.
00:20:55.014 - 00:21:46.496, Speaker B: But that similar thesis actually to yours, which I assumed was just me being lazy and not doing the research. I just assumed like, hey, something that's been fire sold for over a year now at the Defi asset class FTX, not helping all this stuff, right? Things just go down, only for a while, then they go up a little bit. You have a bear market rally from the low point. You can say, wow, this is a big rally. But in reality it's just after another year goes by, we'll zoom out and look at this price action as a blip in a downtrend. I just assumed it was just that fractal volatility in the midst of a bear market for a particular asset class class. I didn't think there was anything more to this, but worth talking about in case we're missing something obvious here.
00:21:46.600 - 00:22:37.514, Speaker A: I don't think we're missing anything obvious. I do especially think in terms of BCh and LPC. Well, BCH is a very tightly controlled. I don't want to necessarily make any accusations, but it is a very tightly controlled asset, which means that it is very easy to move the price. And so it's very easy to manufacture these types of moves, I think LTC tends to follow because what ends up happening in these situations is that you see a leader and then everybody piles on the secondary. One thing that ive learned time and time again, time and time again trading crypto is that its super reflexive. And so you almost never make as much money buying the laggard as you do the leader.
00:22:37.514 - 00:23:08.838, Speaker A: Yeah, almost never the of. So if you buy the laggard, it's like a one to three day trade, maybe. And you're looking for like some level of convergence of like ten to 15, 20%, especially in this environment. But you're just, you're not looking for the same returns as a leader. And more likely than not, the leader is going to outperform your lagger. Because people trend, tend to crowd to the winner. They don't, they don't tend to, they don't tend to buy the loser in hopes of catch up as much.
00:23:08.838 - 00:23:51.774, Speaker A: Unless you're talking about bull market like crazy, full on. Like things are pumping 100% left and right. But even then. So, for example, in this case, looking at DeFi, I do think that a lot of it is. So if I'm looking at the top performers today on my defi list, I've got GRT, which I don't know why, is up 14%. I've got Bitdao, which is going through a rebranding to Mantle Dao, which is probably going to be beneficial for it. One thing that's interesting is that Bybit has just been such a winner out of all these binance issues.
00:23:51.774 - 00:24:00.926, Speaker A: Then you've got blur as well up there, which actually quite bullish on as well, just because I'm bullish on nfts and I think nfts.
00:24:00.950 - 00:24:04.194, Speaker B: So you didn't call that Defi Avi or is that just nfts?
00:24:05.014 - 00:24:18.942, Speaker A: It's like sort of be NFT defi. It's like. It's like a mix between the two. You've got fracs, you've got maker. A lot of these things, I think were just super tightly held assets.
00:24:19.078 - 00:24:25.670, Speaker B: Yeah. You brought up something interesting in there that I want to, like, kind of double click on.
00:24:25.782 - 00:24:32.534, Speaker A: Um, double what are we consultants? Are we going to boil the ocean.
00:24:32.574 - 00:24:38.726, Speaker B: Next, Jonah, from 30,000ft? We could, uh. I'm so sorry.
00:24:38.790 - 00:24:44.194, Speaker A: I. I tried. Corporate. Corporate life has killed you, man. What is real? Let's. Let's try that again.
00:24:45.574 - 00:24:56.064, Speaker B: All right. Something I wanted to think through a little bit more with you together. Kumbaya. Let's talk together about nfts.
00:24:56.404 - 00:24:58.460, Speaker A: You wanna hold my hand next? Yeah.
00:24:58.572 - 00:24:59.156, Speaker B: I miss you, man.
00:24:59.180 - 00:25:03.624, Speaker A: Okay. I'm seeing you next week. Yeah, it's gonna be.
00:25:04.244 - 00:25:46.000, Speaker B: It's been a while. Yeah, it has. So anyway, you mentioned blur the intersection of Defi to have tease. And you also mentioned something about how buying the laggard is a terrible strategy and earns you a tiny fraction of the return with an explosive multiple of the risk. It's funny you mentioned those two things, because the closest market to crypto, when it comes to leaders and laggards, is the art market. When you buy art, all of the people who are good at it, and there are very few, say, buy the best artists and buy the best pieces. Buy the best artists.
00:25:46.000 - 00:26:27.692, Speaker B: Do not. Do not mess with anything other than the best of the best. Everything else is garbage. And that's a, you know, obviously it's hard to pick the best artists before they become too expensive, and it's hard to pick their best pieces until their styles become known. But that is indeed the best way to invest in art. And for NFTs, NFTs being art, like, is there any other trade besides zombie punks, apes, ape punks, aliens punks? I know Izuki just did something kind of crazy, but is this just totally to be ignored? Is the bored ape yacht club dead? Does this lead lag relationship that you mentioned in crypto apply to NFTs?
00:26:27.828 - 00:27:10.596, Speaker A: I don't think so. As much in the form of. I don't necessarily think that it's true for something like a bored ape or for an izuki or for things that were hot at a given time in the crypto sphere. Because I think what ends up happening is that you can think of a lot of the profile picture NFT projects as effectively brands that come in and out of style. So you can think of them as like a Gucci or a prada or a Versace. And whoever has the best designer at any given moment, whoever is producing the best stuff, like an american eagle, comes in into fashion, out of fashion.
00:27:10.700 - 00:27:14.996, Speaker B: So it's like a rotation. It's not like Picasso and Damien Hurst.
00:27:15.180 - 00:27:33.440, Speaker A: And it's because the team behind them are constantly doing things with the project. Right? So a lot of the, like, bored ape and uzuki and like Milady's and all these things are not where they are by virtue of what they are visually.
00:27:33.612 - 00:27:34.288, Speaker B: Certainly not.
00:27:34.336 - 00:27:41.664, Speaker A: They're right. They're there because of the community. And the community can wax and wane in potency and effectiveness.
00:27:41.704 - 00:27:46.328, Speaker B: Now, fidenzas adverse, though different story that.
00:27:46.376 - 00:27:53.844, Speaker A: You read my mind, that's exactly what I was about to say. Fidenzas, squiggles, punks, rocks. Different story.
00:27:54.384 - 00:27:57.760, Speaker B: Who's your favorite trad artist, if you had to pick one? Mine's Francis.
00:27:57.792 - 00:28:25.944, Speaker A: Okay. I don't know that much about the traditional, traditional art world. I have gotten some exposure to it recently. I think that it's a fascinating space. I know a lot more about the gem and jewelry market than I do about the art. Like the art market. As a half indian, half jew, I guess I kind of had to gem.
00:28:25.944 - 00:28:32.432, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. I know a lot. I know a lot about a lot more about that. And I'm actually quite. I find it really fascinating.
00:28:32.528 - 00:28:36.456, Speaker B: Why you bullish nfts, though? Why you bullish nfts? Teach me that first.
00:28:36.640 - 00:29:13.316, Speaker A: So there are really two things. I don't think my thinking is that differentiated. One is that I think as a crypto market goes up, the wealth effect, people will want to display their wealth and they're going to not display it in the form of gaudy purchases. In reality, they're going to buy gaudy things in the digital world. And those are that. That is going to be nfts. People are going to take their money that they make in ETH and they're going to go flex their rocks and fidenzas and squiggles and all sorts of other expensive things, and it will become more accepted.
00:29:13.316 - 00:30:01.280, Speaker A: The other thing is that, and this stays in our little crew of me and you and everybody listening to this podcast and everybody on my twitter. So I've made a couple, I've made a few friends in the traditional art world in the New York space, and they have mentioned to me that nfts are something that they pay attention to now. Like, it's not going away in the way that I thought it might. There's actually a gallery down the street from our London office called Pace in Mayfair and sort of bought my first piece. Really? Yeah. And we have a lot to talk about. So they were showing nfts at that gallery.
00:30:01.280 - 00:30:55.320, Speaker A: And I do think that what's happening right now is that there's some semblance of acceptance from the traditional art world of nfts, way, way, way more than there was a year and a half ago in that, because these things have stuck around. People are like, oh, okay, they're not going anywhere. Got it understood. It's just more of like this immersion into culture. And then there's actually, there's actually a third point here, which is that nfts are expanding rapidly outside of just art. So you have people like Nike introducing the Nike Swoosh, you have Starbucks introducing their nfts, you have artists. We actually invested in one platform called Fan three, which is helping artists issue nfts at a greater scale.
00:30:55.320 - 00:31:34.852, Speaker A: I can't give away anything too much, but they have a lot of really great dj's lined up to go issue nfts to give exclusive access to conferences to music. They've got some athletes as well lined up. And so people are now thinking about nfts in a much broader context than they were previously. And I think that there's some pretty negative sentiment with respect to nfts right now and that most people are ignoring them. I think the percentage of people in crypto that pay attention to nfts have dropped off a cliff precipitously. But activity is picking up and acceptance is picking up. So I'm bullish.
00:31:34.988 - 00:32:02.264, Speaker B: Me too. I'm bullish because I think we've come out of the technology hype cycle. Technology has innovated. Then you have the peak of euphoria, then you have the trough of disillusionment, and then it plateaus out into the enlightenment phase. I think we're past the trough of disillusionment with nfts. Maybe not with crypto more broadly, but with nfts for sure. I agree with you that they're percolating into the trad art world.
00:32:02.264 - 00:32:45.602, Speaker B: My big art guru advisor is, his name's Nathan, he runs the freeze festival. And I was having a conversation with him in Venice last year where we talked about what NFTs could be in terms of traditional art. And frankly, the most interesting thing to me is if anybody who owns art has to own a certificate of authenticity to effectively authenticate their piece, and that document is just printed on a piece of paper, it could be forged. It's effectively a piece of garbage. Right. It wouldn't be better if all art were an NFT effectively with a physical print. And so, by the way, that's how.
00:32:45.618 - 00:32:47.174, Speaker A: I feel about so many things.
00:32:47.674 - 00:32:52.930, Speaker B: Yeah, the deep house. Like, what the heck is going on?
00:32:53.002 - 00:32:53.618, Speaker A: Why?
00:32:53.786 - 00:32:55.584, Speaker B: Yeah, why the heck what?
00:32:55.624 - 00:32:57.360, Speaker A: I. Yeah, why are you gonna.
00:32:57.392 - 00:32:57.960, Speaker B: In Trison.
00:32:58.032 - 00:33:11.488, Speaker A: Why? Why do I have a deed? A paper that says that I own this thing? Yes. It's in a registry as well. Yeah, but if I lose a deed, it's still a headache. Exactly. Why is it a safety deposit box somewhere?
00:33:11.536 - 00:33:53.344, Speaker B: These deeds don't last. Like, oh, this is actually a da Vinci, that no one really. Or is it a da Vinci? You know, this. This like, thing that this Salvatore Mundi that Prince Salman brought bought for $500 million. Like what if there had been an NFT that was associated with that certificate of authenticity rather than being registered with the bank of northern Italy five or 600 years ago when it was created, it was just put on some chain and lasted forever. That's how art ownership and ownership of anything should be stored. Is there a company you would trust with the certificate of authenticity of your art or the deed to your house? I wouldnt want to trust some startup or even Microsoft with that.
00:33:53.344 - 00:34:27.814, Speaker B: Id prefer to just have it on chain. Frankly a business idea for any of you entrepreneurial crypto people out there. If anyone wants to create this startup, please give Avi and or myself a call. Goes two ways. First of all, NFT on chain certificates of authenticity for trad art and also the opposite of that, which is a service for wealthy trad art collectors who buy from galleries. They don't want to go into a metamask and deal with anything. They just want to sign.
00:34:27.814 - 00:34:45.079, Speaker B: They want to docusign something and then own their art. So basically secure storage for nfts that are owned by, that are bought at trad art galleries. That sort of dual service I think is a real crypto business that needs to exist. And if anyone's creating it, hit us.
00:34:45.151 - 00:34:50.323, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree all hardly. But I don't know how he got stuck on this topic of talking about art. I don't.
00:34:50.863 - 00:34:52.239, Speaker B: I find it because it's crypto.
00:34:52.271 - 00:34:53.823, Speaker A: It's for crypto.
00:34:53.983 - 00:35:01.723, Speaker B: It is. Put it this way, if that hit it big, I think. I think ETH goes up because again, it's a use case for the chain.
00:35:03.063 - 00:35:08.591, Speaker A: Speaking of ETH BTC, where is it going right now? Let's timestamp it. It's zero six four.
00:35:08.727 - 00:35:09.208, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:09.296 - 00:36:09.844, Speaker A: And so let me preface this with on the last podcast, we talked about being bearish BTC up until the ETF launch. We talked about being bearish alts up until the ETF launch. Since then, alts have actually done okay, BTCD I do think is up since the podcast, but there are some select alts that have done that. I've done all right. And I'm personally, I personally over the last two weeks have changed my opinion and got longer ETH BTC and have bought full disclosure and ive also bought other alts. My favorite trades in the world are still GBTC ETH stacks, which I think is just going up and then BTC upside. But we did buy other alts over the last two weeks because I do think that especially if BTC gets stuck in this range, we're going to see some outperformance.
00:36:09.844 - 00:36:15.528, Speaker A: The main question is, can ETH BTC keep up if BTC keeps going up?
00:36:15.616 - 00:37:21.722, Speaker B: I think no, it absolutely can. So here's the thing. I think the best trade in crypto is long GBTC, and the reason why is, unlike trading, we talked a little bit about this last week, unlike trad markets, where there's just more than enough capital to prevent pre hedge pretty much any type of announcement or anticipated information that's widely known, there isn't like, there just isn't enough money that can get into crypto to pre position for what a Blackrock ETF approval would, would bring in. Right. So because of that, there is a fundamental mispricing in the crypto market. Anybody who can buy bitcoin right now, spot or GBTC absolutely has that had, you know, has the ability to get ahead of a potential Blackrock ETF approval, which I think would set the price up. And the reason why the price isn't up in a probabilistically weighted way already is, like I said, because it's hard for capital to get into crypto right now, either because the pathways, the gateways, or the will, or the risk appetite is just lacking.
00:37:21.722 - 00:37:45.174, Speaker B: So I think GBTC is the best trade. Just to respond to your question about where does BTC go, where do you think? I don't know where it goes from here, but what I'm confident in is that if you wait for an ETF approval and the ETF, the Blackrock ETF gets approved, that's when you buy, right? I think it said dip buy. I don't think it's a buy right now.
00:37:45.334 - 00:38:03.498, Speaker A: Here's my cynical take on the matter, Jonah. I don't think the ETF drives truly meaningful flows. I'm not. I think. I think. I think that it drives semi meaningful flows. I mean, maybe, maybe a few billion, maybe like three, 4 billion in flows.
00:38:03.498 - 00:38:35.044, Speaker A: I think a significant amount of that, unfortunately, is offset by people that own GBTC and would redeem and then get out of the trade. Because there are funds right now that own GBTC outright and will, when approved, just drain GBTC of their bitcoin and just get out of the trade. Yes, there are a lot that own GBDC in a market neutral fashion, but there are a lot that just own it outright, basically willing to take the price risk of bitcoin. And when that gap closes, theyre just out. And I do think there are going.
00:38:35.044 - 00:38:42.824, Speaker B: To be some time that goes by in between a potential blackrock ETF approval and when you can redeem your GDTC.
00:38:43.564 - 00:39:27.346, Speaker A: Probably, but probably no, but I dont think it would be very long. Yeah, and so I do think that those lows, I do think that those flows somewhat offset, and I do think that there are a lot of flows are front run too. And so net, I don't know how many flows come in. I think it's net positive for BTC over a long period of time. But my bet is that. Here's my take on the matter. If an ETF is approved, it looks very, very, very similar to the futures ETF approval, where it tops effectively on the day of the ETF approval, ETH runs after and catches up really hard.
00:39:27.346 - 00:40:03.534, Speaker A: And then both top together for a foreseeable time period. Then we go sideways, and then in Q 124 having, we start going up again. That is my view on the market, is that ETF is a sale. ETH goes up, then you sell ETH, you pivot, and then you sell. Well, I think you buy a little bit of ETH now, but then you pivot really hard in ETH, and then you sell everything like a week later, and then you just wait for the having to get closer, and then you walk away a much wealthier man or woman. That's my view.
00:40:03.954 - 00:40:28.248, Speaker B: I like that view because I think it's one of those times. And, you know, my style obvious, a little different than yours. I think it's one of those times where your style works better, where you really have to trade actively. You can't just sit on your hands, right? You have to be, you have to be nimble, and you have to be willing to commit size, and you have to be willing to act when everybody is either fearful or euphoric.
00:40:28.376 - 00:40:45.094, Speaker A: And yeah, I think, I think it's as simple, it's really as simple as when everybody's panicking, you buy, when everybody's euphoric, you sell. And I can guarantee you with 100% certainty that on ETF approval, everybody is going to be absolutely euphoric, euphoric, BTC.
00:40:45.514 - 00:40:48.770, Speaker B: Panicking ETH BTC, and then you buy.
00:40:48.802 - 00:40:50.514, Speaker A: ETH BTC, then you go, and then.
00:40:50.554 - 00:40:51.610, Speaker B: That'S when you buy, then you dip.
00:40:51.642 - 00:41:28.160, Speaker A: Buy it after an approval, and then you pivot. Although right now. But that's also why, by the way, I bought ETH BTC at like 61662 area, because I noticed that the price of ETH, and this is where I trade somewhat lower timeframe, but the price of ETH was not correlating with the sentiment. And one of my favorite trades to take is, and this is harder to quantify, but there are a couple of good services that you can use to quantify. I like the tie a lot, actually. Me too.
00:41:28.192 - 00:41:30.340, Speaker B: So shout out to Josh Frank. Great product.
00:41:30.432 - 00:41:59.026, Speaker A: Great shout out to Josh Frank. Yeah, great guy, great product. I think I have to disclose that we are investors, but I actually do like the product. So what I did notice is that there is a divergence. So on Wednesday, from Wednesday, June 28 to Friday, June 30, eats sentiment just kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse. And everybody hated it. But price was flat.
00:41:59.026 - 00:42:31.604, Speaker A: It was not going down anymore. And when I see that, I like to start nibbling. I like to start buying. The same reason I bought a little bit of blur post, post nuke is because I see blur capturing a larger portion of NFT volumes every day. They have a lot of volumes that are running through them. They're doing well. NFT volumes are doing great.
00:42:31.604 - 00:42:53.504, Speaker A: New products, new projects are coming out. But the sentiment on our NFT is like, where'd everybody go? Nobody care about these things anymore. So I see a sentiment, sentiment divergence there. I think DeFi was probably similar. It's like post the SEC coming after Coinbase. Everybody thought that DeFi would just get absolutely nuked. And since nothing has happened, it's just going up again.
00:42:53.504 - 00:43:22.104, Speaker A: That actually, now that I'm thinking about it more, might be one of the reasons for up. But yeah, I want to wrap up the podcast with some just general views and general thoughts around the market. You know, just, just high level. Where do you think we're going over the next, over the next six months? Over the next twelve months?
00:43:22.184 - 00:44:24.258, Speaker B: Okay, so great question. I think that parts, little parcels of the crypto market are looking more like, like to your point, that you just made rational sort of trad markets, uh, where, you know, best to be greedy when others are fearful, best to be fearful when others are greedy. Mean, reverting, you know, buy dips, sell pops, like really, uh, but really kind of sensible markets. The two megatrend assets that I think it would be dangerous to make, the Jonah circa ten years ago mistake selling bitcoin, selling Facebook stock equivalent would be selling bitcoin or selling ETH. Right now, I think we are in the midst of a multi decade uptrend in those two assets. And so I think if you invest in a way that allows you to remain on the mechanical bulk and not get thrown off, I think that's the trait. I think other things like NFTs, DeFi, they've been fire sold.
00:44:24.258 - 00:44:32.090, Speaker B: Probably time to buy other things that are looking a little frothy, a little hot. Maybe meme coins, why not?
00:44:32.162 - 00:45:13.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's in line. I do think that we're at an inflection, inflection point for bitcoin where and were talking as if the ETF is definitely going to get approved. I put it at 75% chance that it gets approved. But I think were at an inflection point where it just becomes an institutionalized asset class and it becomes something thats just not going away. That solidifies in my mind the incoming bubble because theres still a lot of people that dont have exposure, theres still a lot of people that have written it off. It hasn't gone away and it's not going away. And ETH continues to pick up traction.
00:45:13.420 - 00:45:26.948, Speaker A: And so the way that I view this is I view the next few months as solidifying the base for crypto to allow for a crazy run in 24 and 25. I agree with you.
00:45:27.116 - 00:45:39.724, Speaker B: Of course, this is investment advice. Tokens are risky. Do your own research. You know, really, really appreciate you listening in to our views, but they are just our opinions. Not again.
00:45:40.544 - 00:46:01.100, Speaker A: Never financial advice, because I would never do that. I appreciate talking with you, as always. I'm super excited to see you in London. Maybe we'll even do a podcast in person. Maybe we'll do an impromptu sit across the table, drop a special, a special episode. You can get your kids involved. I actually think that would be great.
00:46:01.100 - 00:46:02.892, Speaker A: You know, we'll ask the listeners if.
00:46:02.908 - 00:46:05.516, Speaker B: They want it, get some new odds takes there.
00:46:05.660 - 00:46:06.172, Speaker A: Yep.
00:46:06.268 - 00:46:07.964, Speaker B: One syllable, two syllable taken.
00:46:08.084 - 00:46:09.284, Speaker A: All right, Jonah, catch up soon.
