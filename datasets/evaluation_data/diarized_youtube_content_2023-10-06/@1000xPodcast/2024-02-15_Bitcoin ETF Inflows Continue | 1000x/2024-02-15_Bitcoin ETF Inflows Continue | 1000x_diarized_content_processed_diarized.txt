00:00:00.280 - 00:00:23.074, Speaker A: This is now the fourth or fifth time that bitcoin is having this just like, rip roaring rally and you just can't fucking write it off anymore. It survived low interest rates, it survived the period of apathy, it survived the sec onslaught, survived all these things. Like, it's just. It's becoming obvious to the world looking at these ETF flows. Like how you're literally just hoping they stop in order to. If you want to buy a dip.
00:00:30.554 - 00:00:39.530, Speaker B: Okay. Welcome back to the much delayed 2nd, 3rd, 2nd episode of the year of a thousand.
00:00:39.562 - 00:00:45.454, Speaker A: I think it's the second episode. We were supposed to record a record an episode, but then instead we went out and got drunk.
00:00:45.834 - 00:00:50.066, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, yeah, we did do that. Which, by the way, that was a hell of a. That was a hell of a night.
00:00:50.210 - 00:00:51.026, Speaker A: It's awesome.
00:00:51.130 - 00:00:54.494, Speaker B: It was just rocked back. Whiskeys at Chiltern.
00:00:54.994 - 00:00:55.490, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:55.562 - 00:01:10.666, Speaker B: I don't know how for. I don't know how long. We basically had a pod. I wish we could have recorded that podcast. I think you guys would have really appreciated it, but I don't think it would have gotten past our sensors, unfortunately. It was great. Next time, next time we're both in London, maybe we'll invite a few people out, you know, we'll post a picture.
00:01:10.666 - 00:01:12.834, Speaker B: If you can find us, you can come hang out with us.
00:01:12.874 - 00:01:30.118, Speaker A: We should start having, like, community thousand x get togethers, where we repeat our unwaveringly bullish thesis. Like, you didn't miss much. The Thousand X podcast that happened at the bar was basically us talking about how we were bullish, which we talk about on Twitter and every podcast.
00:01:30.246 - 00:02:22.830, Speaker B: Because the reality is, how could you not be bullish at this moment in time? It's just right. So let's go through what happened. So post approval of the ETF, this is something that we've been talking about for a long time, is that GBTC held a ton of stale capital and that there was very likely a lot of directional capital held within that product that was not able to exit for many years. Because you remember from the time, if I'm getting my dates right, February 2021, the discount on the product went negative. So a bunch of people just started buying it to replicate their bitcoin exposure. And so at some point, a bunch of people just end up directionally along this thing, and so they're going to start redeeming. Because one of the biggest reasons that they were directionally long is, well, there was a massive discount, right? At a 50% discount, you're making 100% return.
00:02:22.830 - 00:02:42.466, Speaker B: Once that discount goes back to flat. Everybody knows the story. I don't need to rehash it. But there was, there were going to be outflows. People saw the outflows and took that to mean that there would not be any inflows, which is the opposite. There are. We are currently experiencing some pretty insane inflows.
00:02:42.466 - 00:02:53.866, Speaker B: I mean, this ETF is breaking a lot of records right now, and we knew it would because you have people like Larry Fink getting on tv telling everybody that it's time to actually make room for digital assets in your portfolio.
00:02:54.010 - 00:03:49.178, Speaker A: I was blown away by the fud when the ETF's first launched. I mean, GPTC is not a hard product to understand. Before it became an ETF, it was a trust that held bitcoin, and you couldnt redeem the trust and take your bitcoin out until it eventually, one day, hopefully became an ETF. When that happened, trust shares, or I guess subsequently ETF shares were redeemed and bitcoin was pulled out. So in the day or three after the ETF approvals first were processed by the market, everybody looked at those outflows, panicked, and looked at the inflows in the other ETF's and panicked. Oh my God. They said that there are going to be billions and billions and billions of dollars worth of inflows, and it's only a few hundred million going into Ibit and a few others and larger than that coming out of GBTC.
00:03:49.178 - 00:04:12.472, Speaker A: And you look at the panic merchants on crypto Twitter, everybody's like, everybody takes, markets move based on the second derivative of the news, not what's actually happening at the time. So if you see outflows, that is not necessarily in and of itself bearish, you have to ask yourself, are those outflows going to accelerate or decelerate in reverse? That's what moves the market.
00:04:12.528 - 00:04:52.864, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, 100% agree with that statement. It's always the issue that people make is they do the first order deductive. They say, okay, well, outflows bearish, but it's already priced, by the way. That's true. Point in time. Obviously, if you know that they're outflows, the question is, over a period of time, are those outflows larger or smaller than expected? And then how is that expectation shifting over time? I'll sort of give you an example of this. When bitcoin's trading 48k, my initial estimation of the outflows were 2 billion.
00:04:52.864 - 00:05:18.240, Speaker B: Now, the pace of outflows changed on GBTC. They changed from if they would be on track for 2 billion. Actually, looking at the pace, you're actually on track for three, 3.54. So, moment in time, you have to realize, okay, my priors are incorrect. Let me shift my opinion. This is actually bearish. But then you constantly have to be taking in new data.
00:05:18.240 - 00:05:52.700, Speaker B: So what are you doing? You're surveying and you're saying, well, what do people think the outflows are going to be tomorrow, day after day after day after? At some point, what ended up happening in this market was the outflows got priced to 5 billion, 6 billion, 7 billion, when in reality they were still on track for three to four because people were putting it into an exponential curve instead of what should have been a log. More logarithmic. Okay, now it's priced the other way, 40K BTC, very good level for people to come back in. Outflows are happening. But this is all. Look, at the end of the day, this is all hindsight talk. Yep.
00:05:52.700 - 00:06:31.938, Speaker B: So what's useful today is that the second part of the thesis, which is that post this particular ETF, there's going to be tremendous speculation on every other ETF down the line that should be coming into play. So at the moment, the ratio ETH BTC is trading at 0.05,275. That is a very good level, in my opinion. You start scaling it, because the reality is ETH is the next product. That is the next thing that's going to get productized in ETF form. You might see out, you might continue to see inflows into the spot BTC product. Maybe the ratio goes to 0.4
00:06:31.938 - 00:06:38.522, Speaker B: 810 percent. But I think some point in the next two to four months, you're going to see this ratio at six six five.
00:06:38.658 - 00:06:39.414, Speaker A: I agree.
00:06:40.314 - 00:06:43.106, Speaker B: Now, it's a really interesting time to.
00:06:43.130 - 00:07:19.414, Speaker A: Start coming in personally and what everybody out there should be doing. Agree. Like hindsight is hindsight, we can do our victory lap, we can talk about GBTC all we want, but what matters is the future now, not the past. Go on to Google, Google, Farside investors, bitcoin, ETF flow, farside co dot uK. It's just like one of 60 different dashboards out there that show you the inflows and outflows that basically the net flows into every single ETF. Just bookmark it, look at it every day. You can see last Friday there were $542 million worth of inflows.
00:07:19.414 - 00:07:47.650, Speaker A: The Thursday before that, 405 million. Just keep your finger on the pulse of what's going on in terms of these flows. And to me, this year is going to be the story of flow. You have miner selling getting cut in half pretty soon in April, you have this bitcoin ETF flow that everybody was panicking because it wasn't big enough. Supposedly everyone was expecting billions on day one. That's not how Etf's work. It's just going to be this steady tailwind throughout the year.
00:07:47.650 - 00:08:35.744, Speaker A: And if your ETF dashboard shows that the inflows are slowing down, maybe if you're a little bit levered or you're holding more bitcoin than you're comfortable with, maybe you should lighten up. But for the most part, I expect this to be steady inflows and a reduction of outflows, mainly because of reduced miner selling. Other etf's like an ETH etf. Now that's on the table. Does that open the door for non bitcoin tokens to be put into ETF form across the board? Is that going to telegraph sort of securities or legislation and intentions of the SEC? Like, all these things are going to become narratives over the course of the next nine months. But one thing that, again, just to close the thought out flows are the story. I'm still.
00:08:35.744 - 00:09:05.684, Speaker A: There's one thing that's bothering me about crypto right now, and one reason why, you know, I would be longer if I. If it weren't for this particular discomfort. Flows are a great story, but you also need fundamentals to make a market really go into a super cycle. And aside from the already proven use cases, I'm perhaps disenchanted with the lack of new ones. Maybe farcaster is going to blow up, but I just. I don't know. I'm not feeling the fundamentals as much.
00:09:07.864 - 00:09:38.976, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the reality of the situation is twofold. One, you have the S and P above five k, you have Nasdaq, you have Nasdaq ripping. You have what seems to be a very robust economy in the United States, the rest of the world. I'm not waiting with bated breath. I think China's under a lot of pressure right now. I think Europe's stagnating a bit. But the US is going, and the US is what matters, because that's where all the money is.
00:09:38.976 - 00:10:21.936, Speaker B: That's flowing into the space. And so as long as you have strong fundamentals from the equity side and from the tech side, then inflows into BTC keep going. And I think we all know that at some point, people get greedy. That's the reality of this market. And there are a lot of people that I think the balance of holders, people that own bitcoin. It used to be a lot less crypto native, actually, but I think because of the ETF speculation, you've seen a reallocation to bitcoin. And so people's portfolios are more comprised of BTC now than they have been in the past.
00:10:21.936 - 00:10:45.944, Speaker B: Past. And so you still are going to get that wealth effect and it's going to flow down to different assets and then the fundamentals just follow. Right. So we'll take nfts, for example, pudgy penguins, doing very well. What a ridiculous name. I can't believe I have to say that out loud. But they're not trading at $40,000 because they've managed to actually transform themselves into a tv show.
00:10:45.944 - 00:10:48.666, Speaker B: They managed to transform themselves.
00:10:48.860 - 00:10:50.514, Speaker A: Tv show for adults.
00:10:51.334 - 00:11:44.562, Speaker B: I actually don't know the detail, but, you know, they're actually putting out products. Right. My view on this is that as wealth grows, what you're going to see is you're still going to, you are going to see the redistribution, and that's going to cause certain sectors to do extremely well, and then that's going to cause fundamentals to actually improve in those sectors. I mean, blur, for example, right? If NFT volumes go up because people are respeculating on nfts, then the value of blur is going to go up. I think that right now, Tau is another example of this. In the AI space, Tao has managed to start raising for sub. Basically, they've started raising for products.
00:11:44.562 - 00:12:05.998, Speaker B: Building on top of Tao, they're becoming a platform. And that wasn't true six months ago, it wasn't true eight months ago, but it's true today purely because there's more money in the space and people are willing, you know, you're willing to go out and do this. I mean, going back to blur for a second is the same with blast, right? They've introduced a new l. Two people are willing to deploy capital into building products on these. On these.
00:12:06.126 - 00:12:16.480, Speaker A: You're saying that the fundamentals will follow the flows. And I have this sort of antiquated, um, commodities mindset that fundamentals lead the flows and create them.
00:12:16.512 - 00:12:16.696, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:12:16.720 - 00:12:20.280, Speaker A: Maybe in crypto it's different. You might be right. I haven't thought about it that way.
00:12:20.432 - 00:12:32.080, Speaker B: I think. I think that's. I think that's what we're going to see happening. And so what I'm focused on right now is figuring out where exactly the flows are going to go in the beginning, you know, so things like is.
00:12:32.112 - 00:12:39.204, Speaker A: My no brainer, like how is that so far behind. I couldn't agree with you more on ETH BTC. That is a crazy one.
00:12:40.904 - 00:12:46.304, Speaker B: I think the only issue with ETH is have you used, say, or have you used any of these other platforms?
00:12:46.424 - 00:12:52.616, Speaker A: No, I've written them off entirely, which is easy. But I mean, they're very easy to.
00:12:52.640 - 00:13:18.524, Speaker B: Use and they're very consumer friendly and the applications are smooth and the applications are easy. And when you go back to ETH, what you realize is that it's just not a great user experience. I think that doesn't matter as much because the thesis around ETH is more concentrated around institutional flows than anything else. In the same way that you can't really use stuff on bitcoin. It doesn't matter.
00:13:18.644 - 00:14:02.116, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think it doesn't. I mean, just to interject quickly, like, well, I'm not going to digress too far. I want you to continue on this point. But let me just say that let's not forget that centralized databases, centralized infrastructure, Amazon Web services, and all of the things that crypto stands in the face of have a much better user experience than even, say, or aptos. At the end of the day, it's about a decentralized settlement layer that has a network effect and has economies of scale and has a first mover advantage. That's why I'm bullish, Ethan.
00:14:02.116 - 00:14:16.844, Speaker A: I don't think anyone's going to flock to near or maybe Solana because they've done something special. But any of these other Alt l ones further out the risk spectrum just because of a user experience. What matters is the security and the decentralization. Otherwise you just go centralized.
00:14:16.924 - 00:14:46.348, Speaker B: I think I'd agree with that. Just talking about price action for a second here. Where do you, if you're trading this market, right, if you're thinking about, okay, let's say you're 50% deployed, you're 40% deployed, you want to get more deployed. Are you buying here? Are you buying 50k? Or is this short term, long term, in your view, extended?
00:14:46.516 - 00:15:25.934, Speaker A: Okay, so let me just preface this by saying that with the way that I form a view. In my trading kind of mindset, I start by testing the absolute extremes. And so it's like, what do I want to have on this second? What do I want to have on for ten years? I don't usually have much conviction in the super short term, so I like to start at the other end of the spectrum in terms of what do I want to have on for ten years? I have never had more conviction in my life. Over any ten year period in any asset class beyond the conviction that I currently have in bitcoin.
00:15:26.834 - 00:15:28.894, Speaker B: You can't give people ten year advice.
00:15:29.234 - 00:15:59.986, Speaker A: No, but hear me out. I'm working my way backwards. So if you're creating, like, if you're trying to not chop yourself up, okay, all right, you're not. You're trying to not buy high and sell low, not, like, sell $38,000 bitcoin after the ETF comes out because some crypto Twitter bears. It looks bearish, right. And then buy it back at 45k if you're trying to not chop yourself up, it starts like. It helps to have a very long term thesis that you can cling to when you're losing money.
00:15:59.986 - 00:16:58.550, Speaker A: Right. So with my very long term thesis, I think that bitcoin is a no brainer that most of crypto probably is going to zero, but some of crypto will probably take over large swaths of technology and finance. So coming back to your question, in terms of what I would be doing now, if I were 50% allocated, I would be allocating myself probably 80 to 90. I would take, what, the 50% that was sort of allocated for crypto but undeployed, and I would put maybe 70 or 80% of that into bitcoin, which is sort of the most secure crypto asset that has the lowest volatility. And then what I would do is I would save the remainder of that dry powder to either add bitcoin on dips or to selectively bet on alts with no leverage that I saw kind of emerging in various ecosystems with some sort of potential. Right. Maybe I would be paying close attention.
00:16:58.550 - 00:17:01.914, Speaker A: I know. Same question back at you. What would you be doing?
00:17:02.414 - 00:17:20.284, Speaker B: Oh, wow. Great question. I'm glad you asked it. My spicy. My view on this, just as, you know, as somebody that trades a little bit more short term than ten year. Look, I'm in Monaco right now. I'm feeling a little bit spicy.
00:17:20.284 - 00:17:25.944, Speaker B: I'm a gambler at heart. I've seen this price action play out a lot.
00:17:25.984 - 00:17:28.912, Speaker A: You're wearing a black turtleneck like all the french people there.
00:17:29.088 - 00:17:32.256, Speaker B: Is that. What do you mean? Do french people wear black turtlenecks? Is that a thing?
00:17:32.360 - 00:17:35.312, Speaker A: Of course it is. Watch every french movie. They're all wearing black turtlenecks.
00:17:35.328 - 00:17:37.934, Speaker B: What do you mean? Name Jonah. Name one french movie.
00:17:38.064 - 00:17:44.174, Speaker A: Leon. That guy that took child Natalie Portman and turned her into a killer.
00:17:45.074 - 00:17:49.202, Speaker B: Okay, name another french movie. That one's easy. Name another french movie.
00:17:49.338 - 00:17:54.546, Speaker A: Amelie. There's definitely a guy with a fixed gear, bicycle and a black turtleneck in there.
00:17:54.690 - 00:18:00.498, Speaker B: Okay, I'll go watch Amelie. I'll go see if I can find any turtlenecks. I forgot you married a french woman.
00:18:00.586 - 00:18:04.390, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, dude, I'm up to my. Up to my turtleneck in french frenchness.
00:18:04.562 - 00:18:07.054, Speaker B: We were talking about something serious before you distracted me with this.
00:18:07.094 - 00:18:09.594, Speaker A: We were talking about, like, let's say that you're under.
00:18:10.214 - 00:18:47.814, Speaker B: Here's the thing. Here's the thing. When you're looking at this type of price action, so this reminds me a lot of the 20k, any round number breaks you tend on the 30k break, you tend to get this type of, type of price action where you have to test the liquidity first. Right. So at any, at any moment, there are a ton of people, for psychological reasons, that will sell round numbers. Now, it doesn't. There's no actual expected value to selling around number forty k, thirty k, whatever.
00:18:47.814 - 00:19:31.624, Speaker B: There's no reason to do it other than people are psychologically wired to go sell round numbers because they like to say, I sold 50k. Right. When that happens, the first time you hit that number, you tend to get a lot of people that will come in and just sell. Almost always, the prudent move is to not buy the first time. That number, almost always. Now, when do you know if that's different? You generally tend to know if that's different. If you get a large liquidation through that number, it comes back down and then it stays above that number for more than 24 to 48 hours.
00:19:31.624 - 00:20:02.920, Speaker B: So basically, the way that I would think about trading this is all my longs. I'm on the sidelines now. I'm waiting because I think there's better ev to wait to see that break, to try to catch it, to buy 5152. And then what you're doing is you're actually betting for all time highs. You're betting for the 70k that to try to buy here in the 50k, when you know that there's a ton of sales, there are a ton of people that have been underwater for an extremely long time that have been waiting for a while to sell 50k. So you've taken your crypto off the.
00:20:02.952 - 00:20:14.728, Speaker A: Table waiting to, sorry, I know you haven't done this, but just to clarify for the listeners, you're saying if you're under allocated, you're going to wait to buy a break. You're not going to buy right now.
00:20:14.776 - 00:20:29.916, Speaker B: Because it might go down. I'm taking the midwit take, which is that I'm buying. And oftentimes a midwit take when it comes to round numbers is right, because that's what makes round numbers important.
00:20:30.100 - 00:20:34.036, Speaker A: Why wouldn't you just buy here? Expecting a break in the future? I don't understand.
00:20:34.140 - 00:20:42.972, Speaker B: Maybe I'm stupid, but because generally what you tend to do is you get to get those 1015 percent sell offs once it doesn't break a round number.
00:20:43.068 - 00:20:46.180, Speaker A: You're not saying to buy the dip, you're saying to buy the break.
00:20:46.372 - 00:21:25.894, Speaker B: No, no. You can buy, buy the dip or buy the break. So this is, the first part of the statement is you buy the brick. The second part is I don't think the inflows are stopping anytime soon. And so I think any amount of selling by the people that already own this asset, whether they're miners in China, whether they're people in the US, have been holding for a long time, there's no other. There's not going to be enough supply to take this thing lower to overwhelm the inflows because you have to remember, we're just getting started.
00:21:26.354 - 00:21:48.842, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's why I'm not trying to buy a dip. Like the price of ibit. The ETF that most normies are buying is $28.46 a share. There's no round number there, and those inflows are unstoppable. Like, to me, the idea of trying to get cute with it and dance between the raindrops like you might, you're probably right. And it is probably a great way to extract extra alpha out of this market.
00:21:48.842 - 00:21:50.730, Speaker A: But I'm not good enough to do that, so I don't even.
00:21:50.762 - 00:22:01.786, Speaker B: Yeah, look, we're traders. At the end of the day, you can talk long term, I'll talk short term. But when I, when I see situations like this, what I see is I see opportunity, and my job is to exploit that opportunity.
00:22:01.930 - 00:22:02.338, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:02.386 - 00:23:00.024, Speaker B: Now that, that being said, I think Q one is going to be. Q one is an interesting one because the only people that are buying now are the people that actually decided. A lot of the bigger players that are willing to get into this market, they either decided in Q four of last year or they expedited some processes to buy. I think the most amount of people that are going to come into this market are going to come in Q two because the ETF got approved in Q one, and that's galvanized a lot of people to take this more seriously. And so starting in Q two, you're finally going to get those people to get their boards to sign off on it and you're going to get a lot right and the having happens. So I've been talking to a lot of exchanges. I think that the best way to evaluate this market is to see who new is coming into this market.
00:23:00.024 - 00:23:08.788, Speaker B: And as far as I can tell, there are tremendous, tremendous amount of new people that are coming in, both from the retail side and from the institutional side.
00:23:08.836 - 00:23:09.844, Speaker A: I'm seeing the same.
00:23:10.004 - 00:24:03.654, Speaker B: A lot of the investment banks, I mean, a lot of the hedge funds that stepped away post FTX are not coming back in full force because they've realized that this isn't, you know, that this isn't going away now. That's going to make life a little bit harder to trade, especially the large caps, which I think you're seeing this in the market, whether it's conscious or not. A lot of the natives have moved away from levered trading large caps. Anything in the top 30 people, just the amount and the preponderance of people that are trading on leverage in those large caps. As far as I see on Twitter are moving away. They're moving towards on chain metrics, shitcoins, all this other stuff. Because I think that area has and will continue to get more competitive over time as these new people come in.
00:24:03.654 - 00:24:41.090, Speaker B: But it's going to provide a boost in liquidity, it's going to provide a boost in inflows, it's going to provide a boost in value to a lot of these, the top ten, top 20. So one thing I'm looking for is that there are a lot of mid caps and large caps that have actually underperformed. I mean, if you look at Solana relative to BTC, you look at Matic in a huge way versus BTC maybe around q two. I have this half formed thesis that the new allocators that are coming in are going to pump some of these assets.
00:24:41.202 - 00:25:29.910, Speaker A: And even if they don't, the rising tide that you described will lift all ships. And that's no excuse for bad investing. But what it does do is it allows you to be wrong for a little bit longer when you're trying to time some really difficult, kind of like speculative theses on alts. Interestingly enough, it's funny you mentioned that you're talking to new people, getting into the space. I am too, actually. I spend most of my days now sort of dancing between the raindrops, actively trading and systematically trading things like gasoline, naphtha, other random parts of crude oil that most people don't like, the altcoins of crude oil. But in my world of commodities, traders pretty much everybody's now asked me, they're all coming in and saying like, hey, is this a good time to buy crypto?
00:25:29.982 - 00:25:33.674, Speaker B: And so in your commodities world, people are coming back.
00:25:34.494 - 00:25:38.926, Speaker A: I mean, coming for the first, coming to me to talk about crypto for the first time.
00:25:39.030 - 00:25:41.438, Speaker B: For the first time. So this didn't even happen in 21?
00:25:41.566 - 00:25:48.014, Speaker A: No, it didn't. It didn't. I mean, in 21 I was like absolutely laughed out of the room for pursuing a career in crypto.
00:25:48.174 - 00:25:55.274, Speaker B: And now, what do you think changed in these people's minds? I mean, these are obviously very commodity focused, oil focused traders.
00:25:55.854 - 00:27:00.666, Speaker A: I think it just, I mean, it's not like I'm some visionary. Like I kind of, the light bulb sort of went off for me toward the highs, but, you know, similarly, this is now the fourth or fifth time that bitcoin is having this just like rip roaring rally and you just can't fucking write it off anymore. It survived low interest rates, it survived the period of apathy, it survived the SEC onslaught, survived all these things. And I think the light bulb that's going off for the commodities community is the same light bulb that went off for me. Like this is a digital commodity. It is something that governments, citizens, non state actors and all sorts of other types of entities will need and want to hold on balance sheet in order to facilitate the very important functions of wealth preservation, value transfer, and occasionally like a medium of exchange for hard goods, it's becoming obvious to the world. Also, ETH is a settlement layer, I think is a topic that a lot of people in commodities are focused on because settlement layers and commodities are notoriously tricky and problematic.
00:27:00.666 - 00:27:39.508, Speaker A: So they're asking like, hey, is now a good time? It's funny that you sort of asked the same question, you know, maybe, maybe rhetorically. I was saying like, if you're 0% allocated to crypto, which, you know, still a lot of people are, now's as good a time as ever. Uh, the ten year thesis is so bullish that you should allocate something and if you're 50% allocated or, or more looking to add, um, I, even if I were still actively trading bitcoin, I don't know if I would wait because I just don't like looking at these ETF flows like how youre literally just hoping they stop in order to, if you want to buy a dip, I.
00:27:39.516 - 00:28:05.400, Speaker B: Just want to go back to the commodities point for a second. So youre inside, youre trading oil all day, every day. What do you see? I know a year ago you talked to me a little bit about the overlap between the two industries. Not just that bitcoin is a digital commodity, but also that there might be some overlap that you've seen some exploration and actually settling deals.
00:28:05.552 - 00:28:05.976, Speaker A: Yes.
00:28:06.040 - 00:28:10.912, Speaker B: Using tether or using bitcoin. Right. Whatever it is, has that progressed in.
00:28:10.928 - 00:28:18.444, Speaker A: Any meaningful way, like, functionally? No. Other than you could say that.
00:28:20.664 - 00:28:21.404, Speaker B: The.
00:28:21.904 - 00:29:18.550, Speaker A: Redenomination of hydrocarbon trade, certain trade lanes, China, China and Russia trade crude oil denominated in remnant b. Now, some of it, India trades some crude oil. India buys from crude oil denominated in non us dollar terms. Like, aside from that little baby step towards a world where there's a new global reserve currency that everyone, even if they hate each other, can kind of get. Get their heads around, like bitcoin, like that little baby step has taken place. But I think what's like, where crypto and commodities will eventually merge, there are a few different strands of that rope, and I could describe them to you now if you're interested. But I think the baby step that needs to be taken, other than redenominating global trade away from the dollar, which is already taking place, is just commodities traders getting their heads around a digital asset, which is belatedly starting to happen in a big way.
00:29:18.550 - 00:29:50.384, Speaker A: And then what will follow is crypto will replace commodities back office, which is a way bigger than trad five back office commodities back office is like settling an oil transaction between Nigeria and China. You wouldn't even believe how many nodes and pieces of paper and faxes and whatever that needs a decentralized database. Then it needs a decentralized denominator, or some of it does. Not all of it. The dollar is great, but it's not perfect for everybody.
00:29:50.724 - 00:30:20.916, Speaker B: Well, it's definitely not now. I mean, you're seeing it. You saw it two years ago when we first froze the asset reserves of Russia and that 800 billion got locked up. Now it's getting worse, if you've seen the recent headlines, but they're actually thinking of, there's agitation because of the aid slowdown to Ukraine, to actually take those reserves and give them to Ukraine. And that would be. That would be a death blow. No, it wouldn't be instantaneous.
00:30:20.916 - 00:30:27.584, Speaker B: Obviously, it would never be instantaneous. But in my opinion, that would be the, you know, the crossing of the Danube, that would be the point of no return.
00:30:28.204 - 00:30:37.972, Speaker A: I thought the crossing of the Danube, that was the point of no return. Or maybe the Rubicon was. Yeah, the Danube's a nice river, too. I like it. But you know what?
00:30:37.988 - 00:30:41.598, Speaker B: It's just, I was just in Serbia. Yeah, it was, it was stuck in my head.
00:30:41.716 - 00:31:18.206, Speaker A: You're a bohemian guy. So basically, what can I say? The, I thought the crossing of the Rubicon is when they took the assets in the first place. But yeah, if they just fucking fork them over to Ukraine to buy weapons. Oh my God. Yeah, it's crazy. I mean, the final thing that I think crypto could be useful for in the world of commodities, and we're getting there fast, is like most commodities that are relevant to most of the world are not just opaque, they're impossible to trade. Like the types of oil and corn and wheat and things that like you can sort of see on screen if you're an institution, they constitute like a couple basis points worth of global consumption.
00:31:18.206 - 00:32:01.524, Speaker A: Like if you imagine, imagine there's a market for west coast, you know, jet fuel or indonesian rice, right? But the exchanges don't have time to spin these up for institutional counterparties. Meanwhile, like one thing FTX actually did a good job of was just like tokenizing new markets and throwing them out there. Sure, half of it was probably illegal, but like at some point in the future, I think the nature of tokenized assets will make it such that most commodities trading will be tokenized and take place either on or off chain, but in tokenized form. And I think that's a real innovation for value transfer and basically hedging speculation. All the things that make commodities markets tick.
00:32:03.224 - 00:32:36.136, Speaker B: Yeah, somebody needs to start to take that step. I mean, I think that's been prognosticated for a long time across all markets, and it is slowly happening in the traditional markets. I mean, you're seeing tokenized money market funds pop up left and right. Franklin Templeton was leading. I mean, I don't know, they picked stellar for God knows what reason, but they did attempt to tokenize their money market fund. And so this is coming at a certain point. And then once it's tokenized, I think a lot of people make the argument, well, well, you know, that's not really good for crypto.
00:32:36.136 - 00:33:09.334, Speaker B: No, it's amazing. It's amazing because it's now interoperable with all the networks, right? So whether that specific asset or that specific product actually delivers any bottom line to any network, it doesn't really matter because it's now part and parcel of being able to interact with that world. And so now when you're able to interact with a whole new world that's going to bring value to that world, it's going to drag it away from your traditional architecture lecture. So I can see that. I can see that happening with, with commodities in the long run.
00:33:09.494 - 00:33:15.398, Speaker A: Dude, even dog whiz has good for crypto. Like, any use is good for crypto, even if it's.
00:33:15.486 - 00:33:17.454, Speaker B: You said it wrong. It's. It's whiff. It's whiff.
00:33:17.574 - 00:33:53.386, Speaker A: Sorry. Even dog whiff. Hat is good for crypto. Even the casino stuff is good. It's just, you use cases are good, even if they're not necessarily the most, like, uh, let's call them blue label use cases. You know what I think is interesting? Like, something that's cooking in crypto, aside from just a broader resurgence of interests and the ETF's bringing inflows and all that good stuff, is the regulators have gone kind of quiet, haven't they? Like, this is an election year, and I was expecting them to start banging the. The friggin drum.
00:33:53.386 - 00:34:02.426, Speaker A: But they. I think they're just like, kind of hoping that people will forget the war they just lost with taxpayer money against crypto. I don't know.
00:34:02.530 - 00:34:29.970, Speaker B: Well, I mean, it's. I mean, look, I mean, it's a political issue. At the end of the day, it's such a bad look for them. They spent so many resources and so much time coming after this space, and they have absolutely nothing to show for it. In fact, they only have taken massive ls. One of the best trades that we've done was we bought Ripple equity because Ripple equity was trading at a 99.55% discount to the actual balance sheet of the company.
00:34:29.970 - 00:35:17.668, Speaker B: Now, why was it trading at such a massive discount? Because they were in an embroiled battle with the regulators. And it was entirely possible that these guys actually ended up losing their battle. But after we saw the SEC lose and lose and lose and lose and lose and lose and lose, it starts to make you pretty bullish. And so, actually, before that arrangement or the decision the SEC came to with XRP, that they absolved them of a lot of the different issues. Obviously, there's an appeal, whatnot. We started buying a lot because you could buy the equity for one to 1.5 billion, and they had about $25 to $30 billion worth of a variety of different things on their balance sheet, mostly in ripple, token, but also cash, also their venture investments.
00:35:17.668 - 00:35:57.984, Speaker B: A lot of different things. I'm telling you this anecdote now because there are a lot of other opportunities like that that exist today because the regulators are taking their foot off the pedal, in my opinion. That's really, if you look at what historically in this industry has been priced poorly because regulators have been so aggressive with these types of assets and these types of products. Products. Now, you know that the regulators are not going to be as aggressive, especially in election year. It's not going to happen. So what do you do? You start to identify those pockets of opportunity and you start to bid them up.
00:35:57.984 - 00:36:13.616, Speaker B: And let me tell you, if Trump gets elected, you're going to make a lot of money. Even if Biden gets elected again or, you know, come on, status quo, they have lost the political will to come after this industry in a big way.
00:36:13.720 - 00:36:22.832, Speaker A: Like, what's your worst case scenario politically for crypto? Is it like Biden steps, steps out because he's too older and firm or something and like. Elizabeth?
00:36:22.888 - 00:36:32.324, Speaker B: No. Are you kidding? If. Oh, well, yeah. Okay. I was going to, like, I'm trying to construct a, for a second. If Biden. If Biden stepped down, it would probably be a good thing for crypto.
00:36:32.324 - 00:36:39.176, Speaker B: I mean, obviously, yeah. If Elizabeth Warren comes up and that's basically, that's it.
00:36:39.200 - 00:36:42.214, Speaker A: It's just Elizabeth Warren, she's the only one I'd under.
00:36:43.114 - 00:36:46.274, Speaker B: Nobody else cares about this industry. Like, nobody else cares.
00:36:46.354 - 00:36:56.290, Speaker A: And Biden probably care, or Biden's lackeys probably cared more than anybody about trying to kill crypto. And they just got ironed out. They're done. Like, they can't anymore.
00:36:56.442 - 00:36:58.898, Speaker B: So they got completely nuked. Basically.
00:36:58.946 - 00:37:21.090, Speaker A: They hollowed out the american trading industry. They definitely made it harder for some american firms to trade crypto. They spent a ton of money, like, slowing down progression in the space and probably sent a lot of talent offshore, probably bankrupted a lot of startups who ran out of Runway. A lot of projects didn't get traction, by the way, prolonged the winter. But it's over now. Like, it's over.
00:37:21.162 - 00:37:25.258, Speaker B: Everybody ended up moving to London because of this. So many people. So many people. London, Dubai.
00:37:25.306 - 00:37:26.434, Speaker A: Dubai, yeah.
00:37:26.594 - 00:38:01.474, Speaker B: And it would be an amazing thing if, you know, look, politics aside, if a reasonable person got elected on this issue, or let's say somebody on the right got elected, I think it would be a wonderful thing to see all those people come back because I think they would. Yeah. And it would be. The american invention historically has been the ability to pursue success. That's always been the case. We've done such a poor job with it in this particular industry. It would be an amazing thing to get it back.
00:38:01.474 - 00:38:28.886, Speaker B: And I think we can, and I think we have the opportunity to. I think that we're getting. I think I will say, jonah, I am so proud of the american court system. I am so proud of the american court system that when you have government overreach, you have the checks and balances. They worked. They genuinely worked. You had bad arguments by bad people, and those arguments got refuted and the industry won't.
00:38:28.886 - 00:39:00.194, Speaker B: That is what we need. We need more of this. And again, I think I've outlined a little bit of how to make money on it. One thing that I'd love to hear from anybody that's listening is, what do you think that most targeted sectors have been? My mind is around things like Dydx, SNX, a lot of DeFi products, but I think that there are a lot of opportunities out there to start picking up things that the regulators tried to stomp on, and they haven't necessarily been repriced yet.
00:39:01.014 - 00:39:56.180, Speaker A: I think that's really good advice. And one thing I'd like to add onto it for the listeners, just anecdotally, what I'm doing in my career right now is I'm drilling in really deep into a sector that I know really well, which is petroleum and refined products and building trading strategies, and day trading my way around that market and then taking the gains and sort of investing them into bitcoin on a more passive basis. Avi, you're trading crypto a little bit or maybe a lot more actively than I am. But I think the broader lesson for the listeners from what the two of us are doing is, like, pick your. Pick your niche, dive into it, learn it really well. Get in the Telegram channels, read the publications that matter, get on Twitter and follow the accounts that tweet important shit and philosophy about your. Your narrow niche.
00:39:56.180 - 00:40:23.244, Speaker A: Trade that niche. But don't spread yourself too thin trying to, like, day trade 100 things or 50 things. So day trade your niche. Get good at it, and then take your profits and sort of defeat them back into. Into your broader, like, more passive longs that you have, like, a ten year thesis on that you don't need to trade actively. And I think that could be something that could be something that turns into a real lucrative process for people, hopefully.
00:40:24.384 - 00:40:45.880, Speaker B: Well, I think that's great advice, Jonah, as always. Look, you know, at the. At the. At the end of the day, it's always a good time talking to you. I think, you know, this was, this was. This was a fun one. You know, I apologize, because I've been in Monaco trying to learn roulette for the last week.
00:40:45.912 - 00:40:47.366, Speaker A: Trying to learn roulette?
00:40:47.480 - 00:40:48.134, Speaker B: Yes.
00:40:48.434 - 00:40:50.554, Speaker A: You say black or red?
00:40:50.594 - 00:40:51.666, Speaker B: No, no, no, listen, listen.
00:40:51.690 - 00:40:55.786, Speaker A: I guess in French and rouge, but no, no, no.
00:40:55.850 - 00:41:04.394, Speaker B: Listen, listen, listen, listen. You know, there's many things to learn, apparently. Look, I don't know. I'm. I'm being told that there are many things to learn. I'm gonna. I'm probably gonna stick to blackjack and poker, though.
00:41:04.394 - 00:41:04.946, Speaker B: But.
00:41:05.090 - 00:41:14.188, Speaker A: Well, I stayed up all night watching the 49 ers lose. That. That was what I did with my life. So. Yeah, I'd rather be in Monaco gambling with you.
00:41:14.386 - 00:41:39.724, Speaker B: You really think that they were going to let the four. You really think they were going to let the 49 ers win? You realize it was scripted, right? They had. They had to do it for, you know, my favorite, by the way, just my last point. That has nothing to do with crypto, nothing with anything else. Completely out of left field. But my favorite argument that I now see is that it was scripted specifically because they're trying to encourage neonatalism.
00:41:41.574 - 00:41:43.678, Speaker A: Who's that? Which is the lizard people.
00:41:43.766 - 00:42:02.126, Speaker B: Exactly. Like the, you know, the power, Jonah. The powers to be Illuminati. And they're trying to showcase, you know, a powerful couple together and that encourage people to, you know, get together babies. It's like the most, like, people writing, like, pages about this.
00:42:02.230 - 00:42:03.110, Speaker A: See, I had a different.
00:42:03.222 - 00:42:05.154, Speaker B: How do you. How do you have the time?
00:42:05.634 - 00:42:36.766, Speaker A: I had a different thesis. I thought that, like, basically my working hypothesis is that Joe Biden died in 2021 and that the deep state reanimated his corpse with alien technology from area 51. And I figured that whoever reanimated him would probably want to promote the city that, like, will reelect him with a 90% margin. It's called San Francisco. I grew up there. They fucking love him or love whatever he's found.
00:42:36.870 - 00:42:41.314, Speaker B: How did you grow up in San Francisco and end up a well adjusted human?
00:42:42.254 - 00:43:07.038, Speaker A: Back then, it was a really interesting, well adjusted place. There are artists, musicians, counterculture, like, good writing, like, all kinds of. It was like a really multifaceted place with the whole spectrum of professions, and my parents, on government salaries, could afford a house and a nice life there in the american dream. Now it's. It's turned into something pretty ridiculous and sinister. I wouldn't go back. It's not.
00:43:07.038 - 00:43:29.926, Speaker A: It's not my kind of place, but it used to be friggin awesome. Used to be absolutely incredible. It's. I mean, like, physically take, you know, the problems that it has, like, with urban blight right now aside. Like, just in terms of, like, layout. It's the most. I think it's the most beautiful city in America with the hills and the skyline.
00:43:29.926 - 00:43:33.604, Speaker A: Kind of rolling around. Coit tower and the Golden Gate bridge.
00:43:34.424 - 00:43:39.712, Speaker B: When BTC hits 100k, I'm expecting you to try to take over SF and turn it. Make SF great again.
00:43:39.768 - 00:43:52.524, Speaker A: Well, that's the problem. When BTC hits 100k, that'll get me into lower middle class in San Francisco. Right? You need to be a motherfucking plutocrat to own a single family home there. It's crazy.
00:43:53.024 - 00:44:07.448, Speaker B: Yeah, that's nuts, man. Well, maybe one of our listeners will get there eventually. They'll invest it. You know, maybe. Maybe somebody put some money in tab at $1. It's now 586 San Francisco back. One last thing.
00:44:07.448 - 00:44:12.564, Speaker B: If you know any good french movies, let me know, because Jonah didn't know a single one despite being married to a french woman.
00:44:12.904 - 00:44:15.080, Speaker A: Robbie, Jacob, watch that one.
00:44:15.232 - 00:44:18.592, Speaker B: Okay? Thank you. All right, guys, we'll see you soon.
00:44:18.648 - 00:44:22.760, Speaker A: Talking to you, Avi. Not investment advice. Love you all doing research.
00:44:22.952 - 00:44:26.044, Speaker B: And if you lose your money, it's not my fault if you.
00:44:26.394 - 00:44:28.914, Speaker A: No, please. Good talking to you, Avi. See you next time.
