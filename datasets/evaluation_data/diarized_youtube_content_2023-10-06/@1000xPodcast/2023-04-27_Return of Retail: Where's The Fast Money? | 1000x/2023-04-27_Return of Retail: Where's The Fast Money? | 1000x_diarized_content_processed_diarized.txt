00:00:00.240 - 00:00:23.774, Speaker A: The fact is with Solana, that at this point, it's so tightly controlled by people that really deeply believe in it that it is kind of priced for failure. What I'm saying is there's zero fast money on this thing right now. And so I think any hint of rejuvenation from Solana probably skyrockets this thing. I think it would if one big.
00:00:23.814 - 00:00:25.682, Speaker B: Game drops, or one.
00:00:25.878 - 00:00:50.858, Speaker A: Yeah, there's no fast money in it. Hello, hello. Hello. You've got Avi and Joni here. I want to welcome you guys back to the now real inaugural first episode, second episode of Thousand X podcast. We took a bit of a hiatus for a few months there for a variety of reasons, but, you know, we.
00:00:50.866 - 00:00:51.762, Speaker B: Just wanted to make sure that we.
00:00:51.778 - 00:01:35.546, Speaker A: Could bring you this content consistently and via a consistent platform that you guys can come to and expect that we're going to be regular with our talks and appearances. So that took a few months to just figure out what that would look like. So we'll be coming to you for about 45 minutes to an hour every two weeks talking about our takes on the market, and I'm super excited about it. I think most of the people that pull up this podcast, at least for the first one, probably know us from either Twitter or from our previous podcast or other, other podcast experiences. So I won't waste too much time on introductions. And, you know, your time is valuable, so we can, we can. We can hop right in.
00:01:35.610 - 00:01:48.494, Speaker B: I'm excited, too, Avi. Glad to be doing this. I mean, episode Zero was. Was a good chance to workshop how we're going to. How we're going to do this podcast. And since then, it's been a pretty busy market. I mean, we were bullish.
00:01:48.494 - 00:02:38.894, Speaker B: We were right. The price of crypto doubled pretty much over the course of our little hiatus. But now it's off 1012 percent in what looks like kind of a scary retracement. And a lot of people in the market are asking themselves, hey, is this just a return to 27, 28k, that range that we had since the banking crisis, or is this the beginning of a fresh downtrend that's going to wipe out a lot of wealth? I tend to think the former. I think that people often get pretty worked up about regulatory headwinds or this or that fire sale going on as a result of perceived liquidations, Mount Gox, others, what have you. I think most of that is, frankly, priced in. I think people often ignore the second derivative of the information like Hayes.
00:02:38.894 - 00:03:15.076, Speaker B: Is the regulatory climate going to get worse or less bad than from here. From here. Can it even get any worse than this? I tend to be more of an optimist, that's my bias. I think the regulatory climate will become less restrictive rather than more. And I think the market is more than robust enough to absorb the upcoming spat of liquidations. So short term chop, possibly a bit of amplitude, not much to do in the near term, but medium to long term remain pretty bullish. What do you think?
00:03:15.220 - 00:04:08.034, Speaker A: Yeah, it's tough. And I'll give you the three things I'm thinking about right now. The first is on the way up. It was very hard for me, maybe less hard for you, to identify the type of buyer that was buying post 28k. Post 29K, who are the guys that are coming in and really, really hammering it? I think from twenty k to twenty five to twenty six, a lot of the buyers, based on the way that the market was trading, based on your average order sizes that you were seeing go through, based on the way that seemy open interest was trading versus open interest on binance and all these other platforms, you could make the argument that it was high net worth individuals, it was large macro funds, it was potentially people out of Hong Kong and Dubai really coming into this market. And then also people that were betting on the digital gold narrative. Gold 2.0,
00:04:08.034 - 00:04:54.002, Speaker A: gold is ripping as well. Gold went up 10%, 15% from the bottom of the banking crisis. And I think a lot of those buyers, what I'd say is that they dissipated around 28k. You just didn't see that type of activity in the market. And what we were betting on at that point was retail coming in and pushing it higher, maybe pushing it to 33, 35. You get above 30 and maybe retail mania comes back in. And so what actually ended up happening is, I think a lot of people, including ourselves, are positioned a little early for maybe a rotation from bitcoin to all coins, expecting that retail would come in.
00:04:54.002 - 00:05:19.864, Speaker A: And effectively what happened is that didn't materialize. So the question that I have. So the first part is, okay, well, who are the buyers on the way up? We knew until 28k, you bet on retail coming in post 28k, pushing it, pushing it to 30. They managed to do a little bit, didn't manage to go further. It didn't extend to altcoins. There wasn't retail in there for all coins. So now we're coming back on the way down.
00:05:19.864 - 00:05:31.434, Speaker A: And the second part of this is, okay, well, we know who the first set of buyers were, and we know that retail didn't really appear the second.
00:05:31.474 - 00:05:39.334, Speaker B: How do you know that? How do you know that? What do you look at? What should listeners look at to see, hey, is retail starting to FoMO into this asset class?
00:05:42.514 - 00:06:19.344, Speaker A: For me, a lot of that is a little bit hindsight. It's saying, okay, well, if I look back on it, the biggest alt moves from the large caps are 15 20%. There wasn't a ton of rotation out of bitcoin into altcoins. There didn't seem to be a massive or a large increase in volumes on derivatives products, on binance or OKX or Huobi. And so in hindsight, what I'm saying is that I didn't see retail come in in a large way. And so now we have a situation. Bitcoin's trading at 27 five at this current, at the, at this current, at this current level.
00:06:19.344 - 00:07:09.486, Speaker A: And my question is, okay, if retail is probably not going to buy the dip because they didn't buy the breakout, and retail tends to buy breakouts more than they buy dips, then you have to bet that the first set of buyers are going to come back in the market and drive this up. So your high net worth individuals, your people betting on gold, but gold is now trading poorly and equities are trading okay. And actually there's been a decoupling of bitcoin from equities in the wrong direction, whereas before there was a decoupling in the right direction. And so my view is that the type of buyer that propelled us up is likely no longer present. And bitcoin has been trading very, it trades in a very trend heavy fashion. Right? We trended all the way from twenty k to thirty k. We've seemingly broke the trend now.
00:07:09.486 - 00:07:52.430, Speaker A: And so if I were to gun to my head, hey, where's bitcoin going to be in a month? Probably 24k in my opinion, because of it. Now, that's not a massive move for bitcoin. I mean, okay, I'm sitting here saying, hey, put a gun in my head, that's a 60% chance you get twenty four k, forty percent chance you get 30. But what that means to me is that, hey, I probably don't want to be in all coins. Yeah, I probably want to hold a reasonable, a reasonable amount of cash. And I want to be cautious with my buying because I think that these guys that allocated originally the high net worth side is going to look for value levels. And I don't necessarily think that 27 five or 27k is that value level.
00:07:52.462 - 00:08:13.950, Speaker B: Yeah, it's kind of just that post banking crisis range. It's not really something where you say, wow, this is, this is a real generational buying opportunity. Twenty four k. I think you'd attract some people, certainly the people who are saying, hey, maybe I'm a little bit too late. Should I buy when it was trading thirty k. At this point, though, you know, I have a bit of a tinfoil hat thesis about who the mystery crypto buyer was. Bitcoin buyer.
00:08:13.950 - 00:09:33.282, Speaker B: Really? My sort of conspiracy theory here is that as part of the de dollarization narrative, de dollarization is a cool word, but just abstracting it away for a second, what's really going on that you have governments like China that hold $10 trillion worth of us dollar denominated securities and cash, and cash equivalents, and they're looking at what happened last year with the Ukraine war and what the US did to the treasury effectively did to Russia's US dollar denominated assets, which is, drum roll. They took them and thinking to themselves, hey, maybe we should let a little bit of this US dollar denominated exposure roll off and reinvest it into other things. You can see that happening in gold gold markets. The chinese central bank will publish on a delayed basis. You don't know if the data is spot on or not, but they publish their holdings and those holdings are going to up. They're not staying static. So I think that if central banks are accumulating non dollar denominated bearer assets like gold and reducing their US dollar denominated holdings, they're probably doing something similar with crypto, a bearer asset, an alternative investment.
00:09:33.282 - 00:10:23.826, Speaker B: And that was sort of my hunch, especially when bitcoin would start to outperform during the Asia session, not during know, north american stock exchange hours over the course of this sort of last leg, up from 28 to 30k. Now, like you said, it's absent. And usually what happens when you have a big buyer in the market, an elephant in the room. And prices don't seem to reflect fundamental reality because the flows are what drive the prices. Usually one of two things happens. What definitely doesn't happen is equilibrium. What can happen is that elephant in the room is just bigger than everybody expects and the market takes off, or the elephant just kind of gets sleepy and walks back out in the jungle and falls asleep, and then prices kind of come back off.
00:10:23.826 - 00:10:30.722, Speaker B: And I think the latter of those two is what just happened? I don't know. Is that crazy?
00:10:30.898 - 00:11:21.274, Speaker A: No, I don't think it's crazy. I remember us talking about this offline where we were looking at the balance sheets, we looked at China and India, and there's been a lot of gold accumulation. I don't think it's insane to think that. I don't necessarily know if I'd go so far as to say that governments themselves are buying, but it's possible that government funded vehicles are buying, right? Yeah, maybe through a couple of layers they might be allocating. But what I think is absolutely true is that the banking crisis caused a lot of people in Silicon Valley to buy bitcoin. It caused a lot of high net worth individuals to buy. I think that it also reinvigorated the narrative for people overseas.
00:11:21.274 - 00:12:17.104, Speaker A: And I also think that. Not necessarily overlooked because I think it was reported on enough, but the opening of Hong Kong to crypto is very. Is very important. In June, they're going to be allowing retail trading in Hong Kong, and this is anecdotal, which probably led to reasonable amounts of buying from Hong Kong, because as people see, hey, I can go access crypto again. I can go buy crypto again, and maybe I can actually go front run the smaller tickets, the retail, once it's opened up to them. And then you look at what was happening in Russia with the foreign reserves being frozen, that's always in the back of your mind, especially as things heat up between the US and China. So I think there's just a little bit of confluence for why you might get allocation allocation to crypto, and it did have to come from somewhere.
00:12:17.104 - 00:12:20.624, Speaker A: I do also think that CZ buying probably helped a bit.
00:12:22.634 - 00:13:10.754, Speaker B: I don't know anything about that, but that's an interesting theory. At this point, I agree with you that Hong Kong is super relevant. I think that it's a good reminder to all of us in just any market that you can't, unless the G 20 nations get together and just ban this stuff, it's a global market. One government, even one as powerful as the United States government, can't necessarily control this market effectively, unilaterally. When China banned crypto, it was obviously negative for crypto a few years ago, but the US really stepped up and things took off from there. Now you see the pendulum swinging back the other way. So it is interesting that Hong Kong is deregulating as the US is bolstering its regulatory efforts.
00:13:11.814 - 00:14:09.926, Speaker A: In my opinion. I don't want to speak too strongly in case people are listening too closely to us. We get too big. But I think it's a massive strategic mistake for the US to make right now. And I think everybody else is actually very excited about it, even the UK is excited about it. And there's a lot of, one thing that's going to be very interesting is that our internal opinion is that there's probably some resolution, either positive or negative, to the ripple lawsuit in the next two to three months where there's some decision point that's going to occur that's going to give the market a lot of information about how the case is going to go. And what that means is that on that headline, if it's positive, you probably want to buy as much, not just ripple, but you probably want to buy as many altcoins as you possibly can, especially the ones that have been deemed high risk securities.
00:14:09.926 - 00:14:19.794, Speaker A: DeFi probably does very well on that day. If it's negative, continue holding no altcoins because right now you probably shouldn't be holding that many anyway.
00:14:20.254 - 00:15:06.384, Speaker B: That is actually an interesting point you bring up. Crypto is one of those markets that's nascent enough where you still have a bit of time to react to news. In tradfi. If OPEC comes out with a decision to cut, if you're trying to click buy on the Nymex, youre just too late. Meanwhile, you seem to have an amazing track record of reacting to these things. And usually what sort of timeframes do you see them play out over? For example, if there were a decision in that lawsuit or if there were perhaps some sort of guidance that came out of Washington, maybe it would be too late to trade XRP. But how would you think about rolling risk into, out the curve into alts?
00:15:06.884 - 00:15:37.008, Speaker A: Yeah, I think about it really is. It's just two axes. And time, by the way, is not really one of them. It's price movement and relevance of news. And price movement is generally correlated with time, but not always. Sometimes you get some pretty simply slow reactions. I think generally, the more complicated the news, the more like, the more complicated the news, the more edge there is.
00:15:37.008 - 00:16:18.750, Speaker A: So, for example, with a ripple lawsuit, if the lawsuit is a ripple, has settled for a fine, and that's a headline that comes out that actually doesn't really tell you that much. You need to figure out, well, what exactly happened? Did they say, did they not admit guilt and they just settled? Did they say, hey, it was a security at the time of issuance and now it's not a security. Did they say, hey, it's a security at the time of issuance, it's now security, we're going to pay this fine and then we're going to shut down, shut down exit. Right. So it's like you kind of have to understand, you know, like what is good for the market and what is. And what, and what is bad for the market. Obviously, that comes out in the docket.
00:16:18.750 - 00:16:57.112, Speaker A: It might not appear directly in the blue in the Bloomberg headline. You might actually have to open the PDF and go and go and go read through it. But I've noticed a lot in crypto, this has generally become better and better over time, just as any market would. Things take a while to be digested by the market. And it also, some things tend to happen that are inefficient. So one example of this is the doge moves. Basically every single doge move that has happened because of an Elon Musk tweet has reverted in 48 hours to 72.
00:16:57.112 - 00:17:48.292, Speaker A: The hit rate on that trade is so insanely high that if you short, if you like, sell doge 45 minutes to an hour after an Elon tweet about doge, like your hit rate on that is like 90%. Right. And so you still, you can actually, you can actually play it, play it, play it, play it from both, from both sides. I mean, I remember one example of this was, if I remember correctly, a few months ago when the market was ripping, sand had announced a partnership with Saudi Arabia to invest in them or in one of the games. I'm forgetting the exact details of the news here. On the news, it went up like six or 7%. But it was on a day where bitcoin and ETH were ripping.
00:17:48.292 - 00:18:13.328, Speaker A: And so when we saw that, we were actually late to the news, it was up six, 7%. But on a day when the market is ripping that aggressively. And the theme of the moment and the animal spares of the moment were all centered around Dubai. It was centered around Middle eastern money. Its like, okay, well, thats actually probably still a good trade because we were within like 5%, 6% splitting benchmarks. Yeah, it's spitting distance of the benchmarks. It's not that much.
00:18:13.328 - 00:18:44.412, Speaker A: So you buy ended up today 20%. Right. And then you clip that. So if that had happened in a market where bitcoin was up or bitcoin was down a percent, I'm probably not taking that trade. So you also have to contextualize it within. Okay, well, what's happening in the rest of the market? How many people are there staring at this stuff? How much money is there to move around? I'd say that now, this market is a market where you need to be very careful with those types of trades. Just because of what we were talking about earlier.
00:18:44.412 - 00:18:47.664, Speaker A: There doesn't seem to be a lot of trading interest.
00:18:48.164 - 00:19:31.804, Speaker B: Yeah, retail interest is what you have to monitor. Back in the day, there was the Coinbase premium. If Coinbase traded over a bunch of other exchanges, you knew that it was retail buying. Maybe one day we'll get the Hong Kong premium, but maybe listeners should just try and develop some metric for retail driven strength to use as kind of a barometer for, hey, should I be trying to do these riskier. Should I dip my toes into riskier altcoin trades, or should I just stick to bitcoin and ETH? Stay disciplined, stay patient. Interestingly, to your point, abhi, I guess we had, in retrospect, the best opportunity of the year would have been one that I was a little bit too scared to capitalize on in any form of reasonable size, which was the. The dip buy.
00:19:31.804 - 00:20:33.924, Speaker B: During the banking crisis, when on chain activity was going crazy, people were swapping stables into bitcoin and ETH because bitcoin and ETH seemed stabler than the stablecoins. And there was clearly this shift in the paradigm from, hey, this is a correlated macro asset, to, hey, this crypto asset thing might actually be fulfilling its promise as a banking system alternative. On that note, people who saw that coming would have had a real opportunity in the benchmarks that didn't play out too quickly to actually react to. And so I think we might have another one of these types of opportunities coming down the pike, possibly as the debt ceiling approaches. I know crypto people aren't necessarily as focused on this as if you're a treasuries trader or just more of a trad five participant, but this one seems kind of real.
00:20:34.624 - 00:20:39.684, Speaker A: What are you seeing on that side, jonah? What are you seeing with the debt sailing that worries you?
00:20:39.984 - 00:21:12.476, Speaker B: Well, okay, so, in 2011, the United States of America got downgraded from AAA, not because of an inability to pay, but because of a potential unwillingness to pay. That was a big deal. I mean, gold, that was the beginning of a 20 or 30% gold rally. I forget exactly how much, but it was a big one. And a lot of markets tanked, a lot of risk markets. Gold went up. Now, I guess the government technically shut down in December of 2019, I want to say, for 25 or 30 days.
00:21:12.476 - 00:21:29.324, Speaker B: And they kept paying back on their. They kept paying back their debt. They were servicing their coupon payments, they were repaying principal of t bills. They just shut down government services. And basically they subordinated employees of the government and their salaries to servicing their debt.
00:21:29.364 - 00:21:29.660, Speaker A: Debt.
00:21:29.732 - 00:22:04.320, Speaker B: They put the debt holders first. Now, we've got a situation where the political this was over the Donald Trump wall thing. Now, I think the vitriol is just as high, if not higher, than then. And unlike then, interest rates aren't zero anymore. So you have mom and pop holding money market funds trying to earn four or 5%. You have people holding t bills, billions and billions of dollars worth of short term securities roll off every month. So if the government were actually to default, if there were.
00:22:04.320 - 00:22:45.120, Speaker B: If there were to be a standoff in Congress, that results in no resolution whatsoever. And the government. Yellen is already using extraordinary measures to quote her, to just pay back what the government owes right now. If that ends during what's called the x date, sometime in the next month or two with no resolution, then you end up with an unprecedented event in financial history whereby the supposed risk free rate is no longer risk free. The United States government will say, hey, we owe you. Hey, mister Dentist, we owe you 100 grand. Sorry, we don't have that for you right now.
00:22:45.120 - 00:22:52.734, Speaker B: We got you, though. Wait a week or two until we figure this out in Congress. Then I think, what do you think gold could do or bitcoin could do in a scenario like that?
00:22:53.994 - 00:23:05.454, Speaker A: It doesn't seem like that many. I mean, maybe I'm just not paying attention to the right place, but it doesn't seem like that many people are worried about this. Do you have the timelines mapped out in your head as to when you think this would become a real issue?
00:23:06.914 - 00:23:44.152, Speaker B: Basically, what's going on right now is a t bill expiring in May yields three and change percent, 3.33.4. A T bill expiring in June yields 4.5 to 4.8%. So you've got 150 basis points of differential in just yield for government securities with a one month differential. So that tells you pretty much all you need to know about trepidation around the date where the United States might potentially default. It was supposed to be late June, early July. Now, they've rolled that forward because supposedly tax receipts were underwhelming.
00:23:44.152 - 00:23:58.174, Speaker B: But I can't even believe that they're discussing this, and it's in every major newspaper on the front page. But markets aren't necessarily getting roiled yet because I think we've been through a few of these that have resolved in an okay fashion.
00:23:58.994 - 00:24:08.146, Speaker A: Yeah, I think in that scenario, it'd be interesting to get an exact look at the historical analogue of what gold did during that time. But I.
00:24:08.170 - 00:24:10.174, Speaker B: 30% both times it was real.
00:24:11.174 - 00:24:20.886, Speaker A: That's big for gold. Okay, you confirm that. Okay, nice. Yeah. I bet that bitcoin would do quite well in that scenario.
00:24:21.070 - 00:24:21.558, Speaker B: Me too.
00:24:21.606 - 00:25:08.484, Speaker A: Yeah. And if you look at that, if you look at the correlations between BTC and gold and then BTC and equities, it basically flipped over the last, over the last month. I mean, a lot more correlated with gold than it was with equity. So I think if that causes gold trip, then bitcoin rips, I think it would probably catalyze a decent amount of high net worth buying. Although I do think that the one thing that I do worry about with bitcoin is just, and this has been talked about a decent amount. But I think it's important to talk about a little bit more is the supply side story is still quite large. You have the government sales of bitcoin and you have the Mount gox sales of bitcoin that are coming through.
00:25:08.484 - 00:26:21.496, Speaker A: So my take on that is that it would be a similar to what happened before the banking crisis, where I think what ended up happening is it's pushed up the low of bitcoin. So I think a lot of new holders came in because they were worried about the banking crisis. And those holders, some percentage of them, are going to be converted to long term holders of this asset and are going to stick in this asset for a while. But that doesn't necessarily mean this thing goes up in a straight line. So I would bet that something similar happens, like you probably get a plus 15 plus 20% move from bitcoin and then a retracement to higher than where it was before, maybe, maybe a 20% to 30% move, depending on how serious it is and how much gold moves, and then you get some sort of retracement. I think the story of bitcoin has always been, it really rockets hard when retail gets involved. And so my view is that for the next month or two, potentially three to four months, we're probably just going to be trading sideways to lower unless we get a massive catalyst like this.
00:26:21.496 - 00:26:42.592, Speaker A: So I guess what I'm trying to say is, I wouldn't view this as a long term catalyst to buoy the price of bitcoin to, would view it as an opportunity to trade it to what the banking crisis was, with an additional benefit of it making bitcoin better long term, because it just converts more holders.
00:26:42.648 - 00:27:28.788, Speaker B: I think you have a really good perspective on that, too. I think you've made a career for yourself, not just being long for the big upswings, but also being nimble and getting in and out as appropriate. I tend to. I know that my bias is a little bit more to try and just focus on the long term, because that's a framework that you can cling to when things are going badly and you're staring at a bunch of red numbers. But it is important for everyone, listeners, us included, to just think a little bit more critically about how to lighten up ahead of potential problems and re add when things look scary. But actually they're, you know, constructive. So I guess to that point, our podcast is called 1000 x.
00:27:28.788 - 00:27:39.068, Speaker B: There is some alt buying out there, Pepe, just thousand x'ed. What the heck happened there? That's a. That's a wild one, dude.
00:27:39.156 - 00:27:46.452, Speaker A: I mean, if I. If I knew. If I knew what was happening there, I've been all on Pepe. Did you. Did you. Did you buy any?
00:27:46.588 - 00:27:59.122, Speaker B: No. I mean, I just saw it and I was like, this thing. What? It was too late. It was alive for like three days. And then Pepe the frog was worth $125 million.
00:27:59.258 - 00:28:36.328, Speaker A: Yeah, dude. I mean, I feel like these things. I actually think so. If I were to make a bet, jonah, I would bet, and this is not financial advice by any means, so please, nobody take this as financial advice, but I would bet that Pepe becomes the sheba of next cycle. Like, it just. It probably just does something so absurd that you hate yourself for not owning any, would be my guess. But I do think that crypto just tends to do this from time to time, where it'll find one asset, it'll just absolutely pile in that asset, and then people probably forget about it for like twelve months.
00:28:36.328 - 00:29:00.912, Speaker A: And then suddenly, like, mid bull cycle when. When retail interest comes back, pulls, like another, like 50 x would be my guess as to what it does. Maybe it's down like 90% first, and then it goes up 100 x. But it's. It's funny. Like, there is. I think when we talk about retail, it's really about new money.
00:29:00.912 - 00:29:14.874, Speaker A: Like, there's no new money in. Like, I would bet if we ran the numbers on the owners of Pepe, the vast majority of them would be people that were pretty deep into crypto already.
00:29:15.174 - 00:29:15.910, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:16.062 - 00:29:49.000, Speaker A: Whereas when you look at something like Shiba, a lot of people that were buying Shiba during the crazy bull run, that was like, the first token that they bought. That was that, like, they'd. Only. They'd, like, been on TikTok and they'd heard about Shiba and they watched a tutorial to get on Uniswap, and then they bought some ETH and then they sent it over. And then they bought Shiba. And the whole reason for buying ETH was to buy Shiba, and there was this non trivial amount of new money in the door that got us that. And I think Pepe is just an extension of people and crypto getting bored, I would bet.
00:29:49.000 - 00:30:05.792, Speaker A: And maybe we can run the numbers and I'll tweet something out about this once we take a look at it and release the cast as to whether I confirmed my theory or not. But my bet would, it's just a bunch of defi insiders that are.
00:30:05.848 - 00:30:18.924, Speaker B: So basically, you think people are getting into these meme coins. The gateway is bitcoin and ETH. They're not just lifting Pepe with fiat, they're just washing value around. That was already in the ecosystem.
00:30:19.264 - 00:30:27.060, Speaker A: That would be my guess for now. With that being said, I just think the branding is so hilarious that it probably does pull a crazy move in the bull run. I think so.
00:30:27.132 - 00:31:08.274, Speaker B: I mean, again, not investment advice. None of this is investment advice, but you're not wrong. And it's crazy. Like, what it highlights is that actual wealth got created on that somehow. And I think what this highlights is that in crypto, you have this fantastic dichotomy between bitcoin geopolitically relevant, keeping central banks honest, like not even a dark horse for next global reserve currency type arguments flying around ETH world computer, fantastic technology scaling solutions of remarkable complexity. And then on the other end of the spectrum, you have this. And you could say, this is bad, or less worthwhile, or whatever, air quotes.
00:31:08.274 - 00:31:32.106, Speaker B: But you could also say, hey, maybe there is a casino element to certain pockets of crypto, or an identity element or a community element that actually has value that traditional finance just completely ignores. Penny stocks don't take into account. I don't know. I think it's an interesting phenomenon to keep tabs on, even if you're trying to pretend to be a serious professional, or are one.
00:31:32.130 - 00:32:25.894, Speaker A: Yeah, you can. You need to, because I think also like that, I mean, for better, for worse, a big portion of the product experience of crypto is the ability to gamble and the ability to bet, to bet, to bet on these things. So, I mean, if Pepe does, if, like, a bunch of meme coins rip really hard, then that's actually good for ETH if they're built on ETH, right. A bunch of coins on Solana rip really hard. That's good for Solana. One thing that has been, I think, pretty striking over the last six months, especially post FTX, is that effectively every other l one has just died. In terms of activity and in terms of interest relative to ETH and l two s built on top of ethanol, really feels like you have to be a pretty massive contrarian at this point to bet on the app chain thesis.
00:32:25.894 - 00:32:30.674, Speaker A: Like to bet on a thing like Polkadot or to bet on a thing like cosmos.
00:32:32.734 - 00:32:38.350, Speaker B: How would you elevator pitch the app chain thesis? What is it for people who don't know?
00:32:38.502 - 00:33:18.614, Speaker A: Yeah. The way that it's really about native interoperability and customizable blockchains. If you have an l two on ETH, the l two on ETH is effectively just another layer to build a bunch of applications. But a bunch of applications still have to share that block space. And there's generally a set format to the data that exists on that l two. Every app has to interact with the same programming layer of that l two, whereas an app chain, it's a little bit more customizable. So you're going to just have one chain per app customize that chain.
00:33:18.614 - 00:34:20.634, Speaker A: So, for example, if you have a trading platform like a GMX that exists on an app chain, then maybe what you want to do is you want to make sure that when you order transactions that go through on that chain, you get preference for liquidation transactions so that you have a lesser chance of getting bankrupt on that chain. Then if your exchange without that isn't like a GMX here, like a uniswap, then you're built on a chain that doesn't have that built in, because there's no reason for that to be built in. So it introduces a little bit more customizability, and then you have native interoperability between the two. I think a main issue with app change is, one, the UI Ux really sucks right now. It's just impossible to use. Interoperability doesn't really exist on a great level. And also, it's a lot, it's more complicated, obviously, to build out your own custom chains, and the dev community just like hasn't really, hasn't really gravitated there.
00:34:20.634 - 00:34:49.189, Speaker A: And obviously you get a lot more security with l two s and with Heath right now. But I mean, I remember even two years ago, people were really, really bullish on the app chain thesis. And maybe my information is outdated here, but at least at a high level, it just seems like people aren't really interested in that anymore. So that's an area that maybe we have to spend some more. I always like being contrarian. And yeah, I mean, it is definitely.
00:34:49.221 - 00:35:47.454, Speaker B: The contrarian moment to bet on Alt L1 S app chains, basically scaling solutions or scaled l one s that aren't really in vogue right now. And I think, I guess what happened during this most recent consolidation cycle slash bear market is that I guess the market just asked, who cares? You guys have built all these really fast chains, but is there even demand for ETH right now? Do we need all this block space? Do we need to invest time and effort building applications on top of these alternative blockchains when ETH works just fine for the rudimentary things that we want to put on there? Maybe that was a valid thesis, but maybe the pendulum will swing the other way in the next six months. Hard to bet on though. Very hard to bet on, especially given the decimation in alts.
00:35:48.114 - 00:35:48.530, Speaker A: I guess.
00:35:48.562 - 00:35:55.042, Speaker B: What would you look for as a leading indicator if you wanted to start buying near Polkadot Solana? One of those?
00:35:55.178 - 00:36:34.476, Speaker A: I think I'd look for just real activity starting up, although Solana is kind of an interesting one because I think Solana is priced for, I don't want to say it's like priced as a dead asset because it still is valuable. But the fact is with Solana that at this point it's like so tightly controlled by people that really deeply believe in it that it is kind of priced for failure. What I'm saying is like there's like zero, there's zero fast money in this thing right now. Yeah. And so any, I think any hint of rejuvenation from Solana probably skyrockets this thing. I think it would.
00:36:34.540 - 00:36:36.824, Speaker B: One big game drops or one.
00:36:37.124 - 00:37:02.790, Speaker A: Yeah, there's no fast money in it. There's no fast money. There are people like Chris Berniske who sit around on Twitter and say, hey, Solana is actually pretty good, pretty great asset if you like multicoin. I think the only thing that you'd have to really worry about with Solana is the, for selling from FTX. That's actually kind of an interesting.
00:37:02.822 - 00:37:04.114, Speaker B: And BC unlocks.
00:37:05.054 - 00:37:39.074, Speaker A: Yeah, well, Solana is mostly unlocked so it's maybe like redemptions for multicoin. But you have. Yeah, but with FTX it's probably going to take a year or so to actually start selling as far as we understand it. Ill go double check with my lawyers and follow that up with a correction if Im wrong. But thats the latest information that we have. Its going to take a while to actually start selling these assets. So I think for at least a short term, not particularly worried about that.
00:37:39.074 - 00:37:52.894, Speaker A: So yeah, its definitely interesting. Nier is like, I have no idea whats going on with that thing, man. Hard to follow these. Sort of died like a terrible death, in my opinion.
00:37:53.634 - 00:38:41.284, Speaker B: I don't understand. This was the greatest thing since sliced bread for a while, and then it just kind of faded into the backdrop fairly quickly. I go back and forth on alt l one s. On the one hand I think, hey, like Abhi says, time to be a contrarian. They've been beaten up to a degree that ETH just hasn't, and I am bullish for I do think there will be another bull cycle. So put on a survivable amount of this stuff and just hold on and put your eggs in a few different baskets. The other side of me just wonders, have the existing offerings of l one s have their reasons to exist been completely disproven? Have they fallen flat on their promises? Solana got taken out by a walking app.
00:38:41.284 - 00:39:08.484, Speaker B: That was too much for Solana. This performant vertically integrated chain to handle ear is supposed to be this unbelievable user experience and then no one just showed up to the party at all. I don't understand. So again, it's kind of like $30,000 bitcoin didn't understand that. Doesn't feel like a stable equilibrium. These things are either going to go up a lot or down a lot, but they're certainly not just going to kind of float around in a correlated way with ETH and trade one to one.
00:39:09.504 - 00:39:46.814, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think the issue is that all activity has just migrated away. And so these things are floating around with these pretty inflated valuations and are trying to, I think, work hard on the bd standpoint. I think what it takes for these things to really take off at this point is it seems like they've lost the organic war. What do I mean by that? It seems like they've lost the ability to organically attract developers in crypto to go build on their platforms and go organically attract retail. So it's like these guys are going to have to just win big accounts. For example, Amazon NFT platform.
00:39:46.814 - 00:40:25.110, Speaker A: I don't know who they're built on, but whoever they're built on, unless it's on a custom chain, probably does very well, right? So I think it's things like that. Like what if Snapchat decides to go launch a chain and they go partner with one of the top l ones? That isn't ethereum. Well, that probably brings a lot of users to that chain. So what I'm saying is that the winners of the l one are probably not going to be from massive organic growth at this point. As far as I see it, it's probably going to be from a top down, heavy approach just because the organized dev growth. Yeah, it's just going to be biz dev because the organic growth is just totally all on ETH and L two.
00:40:25.142 - 00:40:37.532, Speaker B: S. And Biz Dev is harder when there is a massive regulatory headwind that targets your gateways. Your on ramps and off ramps between fiat and crypto definitely makes it scarier for web two companies to dabble.
00:40:37.628 - 00:40:39.144, Speaker A: So how was your day?
00:40:39.724 - 00:40:44.224, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been nice. Traded some crypto.
00:40:45.284 - 00:40:45.844, Speaker A: That's good.
00:40:45.884 - 00:40:47.140, Speaker B: Here, let me ask you a question.
00:40:47.252 - 00:41:02.014, Speaker A: Actually, I didn't look at the markets a lot today. I mean, I always look at the markets like two to 3 hours a day. That was today. But I actually did manage to take some time off this weekend, a little bit this evening.
00:41:02.634 - 00:41:03.894, Speaker B: Avi's birthday.
00:41:05.434 - 00:41:06.934, Speaker A: I'm an old man now.
00:41:07.714 - 00:41:09.774, Speaker B: A few more of those and you'll catch up with me.
00:41:10.074 - 00:41:12.690, Speaker A: It's pretty exciting. I hope I never catch up with you. Jonah.
00:41:12.762 - 00:41:32.614, Speaker B: I'm joking. Basically, I think it's good to take a little break from market sometimes. Crypto is just too much. At least oil would give me my weekends. This is nonstop, so you kind of have to self impose a little bit of. A little bit of a break. Otherwise, you know, lose your mind.
00:41:34.434 - 00:42:14.782, Speaker A: I agree. I think crypto is also one of those things that just totally trashes your dopamine. Right. Because you're elaborate. Well, you're just constantly getting dopamine from something. You're either getting dopamine from prices, doing what you want them to do, or you're feeling pain from them not doing it you want them to do, and then you're also constantly getting pinged or you're constantly on Twitter, or you're constantly talking to somebody about it. It's just like this overwhelming presence in your life that I think it can make it hard to step back out and look at the big picture unless you force yourself to go take those breaks.
00:42:14.958 - 00:42:16.234, Speaker B: Yeah, totally.
00:42:16.574 - 00:42:40.808, Speaker A: Even 24 hours is enough, in my experience. Just sit there with your own thoughts for 1015 minutes, take a walk and that size. You know how many people I know that just don't do that? That just don't give themselves any silence at all? Like at any point during the day, they're listening to music, or they're looking at trading view, or they're on telegram or they're on Twitter. It's like, you know.
00:42:40.896 - 00:42:43.552, Speaker B: Anyway, I agree. I mean, like I said, this is.
00:42:43.568 - 00:42:47.784, Speaker A: Not a self help podcast, so maybe it should be.
00:42:47.864 - 00:43:27.584, Speaker B: I mean, the thing about it is, like in traditional finance, 1516 years ago, cell phones were not a constant interruption. There was no slack. Bloomberg messaging was pretty much the most real time form of markets. Communication markets had hours. Things were kind of old fashioned in a way. And now there is this non stop barrage of information, dopamine, or lack thereof. And I don't know, I guess in the times where it's tempting to click around and do stuff, buy some meme coin because you're bored.
00:43:27.584 - 00:43:45.804, Speaker B: Ultimately, if I find myself getting too caught up in that little vortex of discord, I feel like it's time to step back and just cling to a medium or long term thesis and try to do less. At least that's how I end up avoiding problems.
00:43:46.224 - 00:43:56.016, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's. I think that's actually a very, very fair approach. I also know you've been every now and then, you do keep Shabbat.
00:43:56.200 - 00:43:58.284, Speaker B: Yep, that's right.
00:43:58.664 - 00:44:01.840, Speaker A: Or heard you do the same every now and then. Every now.
00:44:01.872 - 00:44:02.884, Speaker B: Birdie told me.
00:44:04.624 - 00:44:09.044, Speaker A: Man. So what else. What else is going on in the markets today?
00:44:09.884 - 00:44:45.084, Speaker B: I think you've got a little bit of. If you're in crypto, your long term thesis has to be that there's some kind of financial relevance to this asset that's going to exceed just gambling. Right. And I think that when you see things like the 10.2% or 10.1% inflation print in the UK, you see what's going on in Argentina or Lebanon. Those are little tidbits from macro reminding you why you're bought into this or why you might consider buying in.
00:44:45.424 - 00:45:23.884, Speaker A: I think there are two things that have really. The second one is a little bit more new, but the first part is on the monetary side. There's been just a tremendous amount of strife over the last year or two in the macro world, in places that you mentioned. And that really brings to light why bitcoin is so valuable. I think on the second point, there's the rise of AI and all these deepfakes, these like crazy. I don't know if you saw the song that was produced by AI, that was a Drake. A Drake copy sounded exactly like him.
00:45:23.884 - 00:45:52.066, Speaker A: There's going to be so much insane content out there that you're just not going to know if it's real or not. And that verification, that, like, true verification of, you know, are you a real human or not? Is this the content that is produced by real human? Is that. Is Ron DeSantis actually saying that, or did he was it was. He faked. It was true. Anyway, not getting politics, but you get. You get.
00:45:52.066 - 00:46:10.350, Speaker A: You get what I'm saying, right? It's that I actually think can be solved for in some ways. In some ways by. By crypto. Right. Just anytime you, hey, prove that you produce this video, do it the same way that you prove that you own an address with a digital signature.
00:46:10.542 - 00:46:30.482, Speaker B: That's a fantastic point. There is an immutability. I mean, obviously, I'm sure we'll find a day when auto GPT starts launching random blockchains, thousands per hour. But, I mean, in terms of the chains that have relevance today, they are immutable. You can prove that something happened with a timestamp and a settlement. That's a great point, Abhi.
00:46:30.658 - 00:46:54.136, Speaker A: So I think those are the overarching themes to maybe wrap up with. Those are the two most interesting things that I'm seeing right now in the crypto world. To recap on markets. Just things haven't really changed in the last 45 minutes since. Since recorded. But I do. You know, if you.
00:46:54.136 - 00:47:01.644, Speaker A: You put it. You put a gun to my head. I think bitcoins. I think bitcoin's 24k in the next month. Gun to your head, Jonah. 24 or 30?
00:47:01.944 - 00:47:02.976, Speaker B: 24.
00:47:03.160 - 00:47:04.924, Speaker A: Okay. We're on the same page.
00:47:05.304 - 00:47:21.842, Speaker B: Not investment advice, of course. None of this is crypto's risky, but what a, you know, what a sobering thought from a long term crypto bull, you know, just another reminder to sort of stay safe out there and be disciplined, not go crazy with risk.
00:47:21.898 - 00:47:29.746, Speaker A: All our listeners, stay safe and have a good day. Evening, night. Enjoy yourself wherever you are out there.
00:47:29.810 - 00:47:30.354, Speaker B: Thanks for listening.
