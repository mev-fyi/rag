00:00:00.120 - 00:00:05.374, Speaker A: People have to buy their sports cars or, you know, whatever. Whatever, you know, chalets or whatever the hell you want to, you want to spend your money on.
00:00:05.414 - 00:00:08.398, Speaker B: Looks like Dan's rocking a peloton back there, or.
00:00:08.526 - 00:00:11.646, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, is that where the money went? The peloton?
00:00:11.790 - 00:00:15.714, Speaker C: Yeah. And then, then actually, I have a dinosaur in a crate.
00:00:19.174 - 00:00:21.966, Speaker A: Is it that like a real, like a bones or, like, what are we talking about?
00:00:21.990 - 00:00:24.566, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, it's a fossil. It's like a fish.
00:00:24.670 - 00:00:35.074, Speaker B: We were debating before the show. We were like, dan's a real og. Like, does he have a tungsten cube? Does he have a lambo? But you have fucking dinosaur fossil. That's pretty dope.
00:00:43.134 - 00:01:12.982, Speaker A: All right, sweet. Welcome back, everyone, to the first thousand x podcast of the new year. We have a great guest, Dan Matuszewski, one of the longest tenured crypto traders around, someone who's managed to weather the highs and the lows and stick around despite all of the ridiculous fatigue and silly things that happen in this space. We're recording right after the SEC, about a day after the SEC's Twitter got hacked and we had some crazy moves in the market. Dan, is that, like, top five stupidest.
00:01:12.998 - 00:01:13.918, Speaker C: Thing you've seen in crypto?
00:01:13.966 - 00:01:17.278, Speaker A: Top ten, top 20? Like, I think it's top five.
00:01:17.326 - 00:01:42.702, Speaker C: I mean, it's top five because, I mean, we're finally on the big stage, right? Like, every news, or at least every financial news organization on the planet. Like, the headlines were just about it, right? Like, I don't know, you got senators tweeting at them and, like, I don't think that any of that stuff will matter. But we just, as an industry, look like clowns for basically 4 hours. I mean, the SEC looks bad, too, but, like, also, like, of course we would not be able to, like, go.
00:01:42.718 - 00:02:10.664, Speaker B: Through this like adults as an industry. Like, I would argue we've looked like clowns for some time now with, you know, FTX turning into, you know, just like the greatest scam since Bernie Madoff and all the other horrible things that have happened. How have you managed to weather these crazy cycles and keep your head screwed on right? I think all the traders out there want to learn how you don't burn out, basically, amidst all this craziness.
00:02:10.964 - 00:02:46.676, Speaker C: Yeah. So the FTX one in particular, that one, I think was just, we had learned a lot of lessons a lot of years ago. So nowadays, people don't think about exchange exposure as much as on the back of FTX. They do. But really, you got into a lull probably. I don't know, starting like 2020 on where people kind of stopped worrying about the venue risk, there was that little brief period where OKX froze withdrawals and people got a little spooked again, but that didn't really affect us people as much. So anyway, there hadn't been a big exchange failure in a while and people got complacent, really.
00:02:46.676 - 00:03:30.390, Speaker C: Like, back in the day when we first started doing this, when I first started trading this thing, exchanges would go down every six months. They weren't really sticking around. So you definitely didn't keep more on there than you had to. So one of the things that we just, as a best practices thing over the years is we try to diversify exchange venues as much as possible that you can and really just keep an amount of money there that you won't get obliterated if you lose. So, like, we had money on FTX, we got popped. Like, we more likely than not, like, any major venue would ever go down. Like, we would have some exposure to it, but it was all, like, an amount of money we were able to lose and, like, continue to, like, operate, right? And, like, it actually ended up, I mean, dollar trends end up being fine, like, whatever.
00:03:30.390 - 00:04:15.754, Speaker C: Like, the risk sort of angle that people are complaining about now. Like, I mean, everything went up and, like, you sort of got blown out at the lows. But anyway, like, the long story, the short is, like, we picked up habits just sort of from, like, doing this for so long that, like, we're able to sort of keep going even when stuff gets pretty dark. And so do you have exposure to it? So the counter to that is if you diversify your exchanges a lot, you always take a hit sort of when one goes down, right? So you do sort of have this, like, tail risk of you're always getting clipped a little bit, sort of whenever these things blow up, like, we even, we use some, like, mid tier exchanges sometimes and, like, they go down more. Like, we've lost a couple of those probably since we started CMS. And, like, they were just like a figure that we, like, were always willing to sort of lose. Like, it sucks.
00:04:15.754 - 00:04:50.992, Speaker C: I didn't want it to happen, but, like, it is what it is. There's like a cost of doing business with the counterparty exposure in this. I think that, like, makes the returns on the liquid side sometimes, like, look rosier than they are because, like, people don't price that risk sort of in it. And I think, like, a lot of people learn that who are LP's and funds that were liquid, like, so this less, like, oh, when, like, funds just got toasted because, like, their exposures were so high on some of the venues and whatnot. So anyway, like, that, that in particular is sort of help. It's one of these things where, like, you just do this long enough. Like, you start running up against, like, all these scenarios and, like, hopefully you survive them and then you sort of keep going through it.
00:04:50.992 - 00:05:02.960, Speaker C: Also, I think I had the fortune of starting when the money didn't matter as much and the numbers were small. So, like, there was nothing, like, really, like, you couldn't really hurt yourself enough to, like, be out of the game.
00:05:02.992 - 00:05:04.496, Speaker B: And, like, when did you start?
00:05:04.680 - 00:05:27.016, Speaker C: I started, like, trading this thing professionally, like, 2013. I was, like, messing around with it in late 2012. And then I. That first run in, I don't know if it was, like, q one but, or into Q two where it ran up to, like, 1000 in 2013, I was like, all right, I'm gonna. I'm gonna give this a go. And I went to work at Kraken. Actually, even way back then, they'd, like, just gone, like, live on the whole thing.
00:05:27.016 - 00:05:32.536, Speaker C: Jesse started that in 2011, but it took him a bit to, like, get it going. And that was, like, my first foray, sort of taking a job in crypto.
00:05:32.560 - 00:05:34.984, Speaker B: Did you have a finance background before that or.
00:05:35.144 - 00:05:55.594, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I was working. I was actually working at a hedge fund. I was training. I was doing more of the programming side of some of the automated training to hedge the deltas for, like, an option book that I was attached to. Anyway, it was mostly a ball fund that was a little, like, south of Boston. But, I mean, I was pretty junior there, so I didn't have, like, a ton of responsibility on it. But I had learned enough from, like, the guys being there.
00:05:55.594 - 00:06:06.724, Speaker C: I was there for probably three years. So I knew enough about, like, markets to, like, understand that aspect of it. And I had a technical background, which helped a little bit, but not a ton.
00:06:07.864 - 00:06:15.848, Speaker A: Back then, there was basically, you were going into a market that had negative infrastructure. There was nothing right in terms of actually accessing the market.
00:06:15.976 - 00:06:36.652, Speaker C: It would just not be there in three months or, like, it would just. I mean, the methods for, like, transferring money were weird. Slightly gray area if they were even, like, allowed to be operating. There was, like, all these, like, odd payment processors that would, like, take the action, like, skrill and, like, local till and, like, I don't know. Like, it was definitely. It was a weird. It was a weird market.
00:06:36.652 - 00:06:53.156, Speaker C: It was. And, like, I. It was a little more nefarious. Probably at that time. I mean, Silk Road was big and it was like, definitely huge as a function of, like, the aggregate sort of volume going on and stuff. So it was a little seedier than it obviously is now. And like, as the industry's gotten bigger, like, that's like sort of changed.
00:06:53.156 - 00:07:12.894, Speaker C: But, yeah, it was. And the characters were way more colorful back then because, like, people, people were like, if you were really into it, you were definitely a little more, like, further on, like the belief spectrum in like a lot of different ways. So those people have like, kind of gotten like washed in sort of like the whole crowd as, like time's gone on.
00:07:13.634 - 00:07:37.792, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we've definitely professionalized the industry a lot over the last six, seven years, but it's still, I think, suspicious. Had a hilarious tweet. Like, this is still not a serious industry in many meaningful ways. Just like the people, the characters, what we do. I mean, you look at half the things that people get up to in this market. It's what shitcoin is going to pump. I'm going to buy it before everybody else and then sell it back to them.
00:07:37.792 - 00:07:40.284, Speaker A: And this thing's probably not going to exist in two years anyway.
00:07:40.784 - 00:08:09.894, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, but part of that is like value, right? Like, I think people knock it, but I think a lot of the look, this industry is like, does have some entertainment value and I think it has like a way of sucking you in and you don't leave because it is like a little addicting. Just like the information flow, like the community, it is fun. And I think that that matters a lot. It's like, that's some of the value it has is that it maintains and keeps like a pretty wide, large group of people involved in it at all times.
00:08:10.194 - 00:08:40.622, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Crypto is like the best video game that's ever existed in the history of video games. I mean, it's amazing. And now you have all these tools to play the video game. I mean, you spend all your time in deck, screener, poke, poking around or you're looking at order books, you're looking at flows and it's just, yeah, there's, there's a huge addictive, addictive quality to it. And at the same time, we're in an industry that we think is going to change the world over the next 1010 to 15 years, which is, which is super nice. But yeah, I mean, being on CT is just like watching a movie day, day in and day out.
00:08:40.622 - 00:08:41.270, Speaker A: Right?
00:08:41.382 - 00:08:43.894, Speaker B: It's just a really neurotic movie and.
00:08:43.894 - 00:08:58.484, Speaker C: It'S bottom like you, you can, like, you can start poking on different, like, you can like, go look at like one like, aspect of it and just be down the hole for days and then just like pop. Like, you can never consume the entire, like, universe of information at this point.
00:08:58.984 - 00:09:26.382, Speaker A: That was actually, that was actually the thing that was kind of a hard transition for me. I mean, I felt back in 2017, 2018, I could cover basically the whole industry myself. I mean, there were obviously, like, there were a ton of things that were going on, but you could sort of get a handle on most things. And now when I'm on CTE or I'm looking at new stuff or my analysts are bringing me things like, I've never seen this before in my life. I have no idea what this is. I don't even understand it at all. And then you have to really spend time to time to get in.
00:09:26.382 - 00:09:37.918, Speaker A: I mean, the industry has definitely grown in terms of width, like the ability to, for one person to manage and trade effectively. I mean, you kind of need a team now in many ways if you want to cover the whole breadth of it.
00:09:38.006 - 00:09:49.294, Speaker C: Yeah, you can't, you can't possibly like, absorb all that's going on. Like, it's just, there's too many aspects. Like maybe in like the depths of the bear market when it's like slow, like, you can grasp it, but definitely not now when stuff's flying around.
00:09:50.234 - 00:10:01.730, Speaker B: How active are you, Dan? Do you have a whole team? Are you just constantly actively trading every single crypto sector or you running it lean and more, trying to time things and get in and out more slowly?
00:10:01.922 - 00:10:49.470, Speaker C: I think we'll probably skew towards the more active side of the house, like me personally, but then also our firm compared to others. How many are we now total? I think we're eleven total, spread between a couple of different cities, mostly New York and Boston, and a bunch of guys remote. We definitely do a fair bit of stuff in the defi angle of things too, whatever you want to call it. We're always banging around on new stuff and trying to get yield for assets we have, but we're pretty active on the liquid side. We're less active than when we started, but we trade every day for sure. And we pump out a lot of liquidity into some of these newer, specifically the Defi Dex deriv protocols. We try to do a lot there where we can.
00:10:49.470 - 00:11:11.478, Speaker C: We run a fair bit of automated trading. We keep a lot of in house programming and tech talent, and we have guys who just do dedicated DevOps, running nodes and keeping on all that stuff. So, I don't know. We're pretty active on that front, and then we have a co guys that just do the venture, so we run the gamut of it. But I tend to focus purely just on the liquid side of things.
00:11:11.606 - 00:11:45.432, Speaker B: I mean, this is the first time I've ever met you. I've heard about you ever since I got into professional crypto trading. You guys, you and Bobby Cho, you have a reputation for having started a spray and pray fund at basically the best possible time, and then basically rode that massive 2021 wave and somehow didn't get blown out by the sell off. Uh, probably just by active, actively trading risk management using some of the techniques you just mentioned. Um, you know, we got lucky, too.
00:11:45.488 - 00:11:58.536, Speaker C: I want to be completely fine there. Like, I mean, like, the. This. The history is always told by the survivors, but, like, it was. We zigged and zagged in a couple of the right spots in 2022, which, like, very much helped tell us some stories.
00:11:58.600 - 00:12:01.272, Speaker B: Like, that is you guys threaded the fucking needle that was.
00:12:01.368 - 00:12:01.768, Speaker C: Almost.
00:12:01.856 - 00:12:17.236, Speaker B: Nobody managed to do that all. You know, you were in that sort of top five, top three fund category in 21, and literally everybody in the top 20, I think, except you, got immolated spectacularly. Like, what were you doing? Tell us some stories.
00:12:17.380 - 00:12:42.954, Speaker C: Yeah, so we got a little lucky first off, because the way we're structured, we, like, have, like, a pretty gross, like, tax burden because, like, it's all pass through income, and we all, like, live in places that are, like, very high tax. I mean, most of our stuff is short term cap gains. So, like, we. We basically have to sell half our p and l in any given year just to let cover the tax in a good year. Right. And, like, that changes depending on, like, the breakdown. But that's, like, sort of the rough math.
00:12:42.954 - 00:13:08.646, Speaker C: 21 was such a, like, phenomenal sort of run that we started prepping for the 2022 tax hit because, like, we would make estimated payments, but not, like, huge. And, like, you don't know what your PNO's gonna be. So, like, it's pretty much all going out Q 122. So we started, like, basically de risking and taking a bunch of money off the table at the end of 2020 just because we had to. Right. Like, because we gotta have to pay that money, which we did end. So that was lucky, really, because we.
00:13:08.646 - 00:13:56.474, Speaker C: We just, like, knew. I had seen enough people get obliterated in 28, 2018 from, like, not having their tax money together in 2017 to know that, like, look, if Q one is bad in the following, like, a good year, like you have like a real problem because your fire selling assets like maybe at sort of the level that you can just like make your tax but not. So anyway that was like the first lucky thing that we had. So we just like had the cash on hand and we had sold the money for bonuses too just to get that ahead. So we were, we could make our payments that we needed to make like in the Q and so like that was all right. And then like that didn't force us to do like a ton of stuff in the beginning. We also just like we had taken some risk off the table from some like larger positions via using the borrow lend desks.
00:13:56.474 - 00:14:29.974, Speaker C: That was just like lucky that we structured them as term so that they didn't get called in open. So like we just, like, we just were kind of lucky in some of like the structuring that we had with some of this stuff that we were like able to, we didn't do well. Like we took a lot of deltas down and like a lot of our book just got smushed. But we had taken enough risk off the table that we had bullets on the way down and we were also able to just like keep paying and operating everything. Like there was no disruption of payroll. Like we let a couple people go that, I mean look, you, you get aggressive like hiring in the bull and like you gotta like clean it up in the bear. But for the most part, like we kept the majority of the team through.
00:14:29.974 - 00:15:19.932, Speaker C: I will say the one thing like I didn't anticipate, which I learned, was that like we were very active with most of the bilateral lending desks, so celsius, grayscale, blockfi, like we've done an equity investment in blockfi. Even like we, we were big players with all these guys. I didn't really think about it, which I should have, is that if one lender dies, they all die. I knew it was very daisy chained and I knew there was really only ten people maybe that were 90% of the borrow, but I guess I just didn't factor in how bad that would be unwinding. So part of the problem we ran into in 2022 was a lender would blow up. We would have to close all of our open term loans with them. But by the time we were done with that, like the next peg was falling and like that was getting called it.
00:15:19.932 - 00:15:48.052, Speaker C: So like we were just constantly paying back borrow and like having to close things. So like that sucked. And like in retrospect like that was like the biggest thing that we could have thought a little bit more about that. We just didn't at the time. I mean, like, in the bull market, like, you get sloppy and lazy. You don't, like, think about, like, if it goes bad. But that was, like, a real headache that was going on behind the scenes that I don't think people really understood was that everything was like, at some, you had, like, a four month window where, like, every dollar of, like, open term borrow got called.
00:15:48.052 - 00:16:06.356, Speaker C: And it was hard. It was hard for people to get all that together. A lot of that money had been fired out into venture, and people just kind of assumed they'd always be able to borrow it from somewhere, and you just couldn't. The market went to zero. The credit crunch that happened was wild. It just went to nothing overnight. And by overnight, I mean three or four months, but it just happened.
00:16:06.356 - 00:16:12.824, Speaker C: And it never came back. It still really hasn't come back. So that was a big boat that we didn't really think about on the way down.
00:16:13.864 - 00:16:36.336, Speaker A: Yeah. The thing you said at the beginning, I think, is actually a huge source of. Huge source of alpha, you said. I mean, a lot of people are in that position where when they make a ton of money in a given year, they have to cover their. They have to cover their taxes, which I think is why you see crypto so often. Top, in January and February, as people. As people are paying out their taxes, everybody sort of calls out a meme.
00:16:36.336 - 00:16:41.232, Speaker A: But after the cycles, I mean, that's just what we see. I know that in 2021, you had.
00:16:41.288 - 00:16:43.296, Speaker C: I mean, that money's gotta go, but.
00:16:43.320 - 00:16:53.304, Speaker A: Like, it's gotta go, like, it's got, it's got. It's gotta, it's gotta exit. And people, people, people have to buy, people have to buy their sports cars or, you know, whatever, whatever, you know, chalets or whatever the hell you want to. You want to spend your money on.
00:16:53.344 - 00:16:56.328, Speaker B: Looks like Dan's rocking a peloton back there, or.
00:16:56.456 - 00:16:58.760, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Is that where the money went?
00:16:58.792 - 00:17:00.284, Speaker B: The peloton cycle?
00:17:00.624 - 00:17:04.684, Speaker C: Yeah. And then. Then actually, I have a dinosaur in a crate.
00:17:08.134 - 00:17:10.926, Speaker A: Is it that like a real, like a bones or like, what are we talking about?
00:17:10.950 - 00:17:15.006, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, it's a fossil. It's like a fish. Yeah. Oh, wow.
00:17:15.070 - 00:17:24.334, Speaker B: See, we were debating before the show. We were like, dan's a real og. Like, does he have a tungsten cube? Does he have a lambo? But you have fucking dinosaur fossil.
00:17:24.414 - 00:17:39.702, Speaker C: I know. I gotta do. I have a big tusk in the basement. The guys are downstairs on that day where on the mate in the main floor. Like we have like everybody, like in a ring. This is like we, we took an old townhouse and we like, turned it into like an office. So like, I'm in the upstairs room, but so this.
00:17:39.702 - 00:18:04.876, Speaker C: Remember, remember, do you remember this? We went to like go buy that dinosaur in France. No, I. This was like, do you not remember this at all? This is the peak of 2021. This was like November. Like you could mark the calendar high to like be like with a pen to like the exact top we sent. So there anyway, like that's to get to in the weeds. But we, a bunch of people got together, like, and we sort of organized it, try to buy this dinosaur, but we ended up getting smoked on it.
00:18:04.876 - 00:18:26.316, Speaker C: It ended up going like way higher than we thought it was. But we sent a guy to France and we had to pay a deposit in euro to be able to bid. So we had to send, I forget what it was. It was like a couple hundred thousand euro to be able to actually participate. That was how you could prove your real. And then the guy we sent, Jack, was our CFO to do it. Was there.
00:18:26.316 - 00:18:49.176, Speaker C: And he gets smoked, right? Auction goes way higher than we thought it was going to go. Like, we don't have a standard chance. But at the time I was like, look like you're there. Like, I don't even want to like, figure out how to get this money back. Just burn the deposit because like they have other stuff they're selling. So he got like a bunch of like random fossils that we like. But this, this thing is like 10ft long, which we didn't realize and it's like 800 pounds.
00:18:49.176 - 00:18:57.186, Speaker C: So, like, we have nowhere to put it. We're like, oh, we'll put it on the wall. And it's so fucking. It's rock. Like, it's a big rock. Like, it's in the rocks, though. It's so.
00:18:57.186 - 00:19:00.882, Speaker C: It's way too. So it's just been sitting in the crates here for like, this is.
00:19:00.978 - 00:19:03.394, Speaker A: What is it? This is like a, this is a fish. You said what?
00:19:03.474 - 00:19:07.786, Speaker C: It's a. It's a ten foot, like, prehistoric fish. That's, that's it.
00:19:07.810 - 00:19:11.810, Speaker A: That's incredible. We gotta, we got to get a picture of this thing once you actually put it together.
00:19:12.002 - 00:19:27.404, Speaker C: To be fair, I haven't opened it, so, like, I don't even know if it's in there, but, like, it should be. Yeah, but I don't have anywhere. I don't have a single piece of like, wall that's like, will hold it or even like I don't know if I could even, like, structurally hold it. Anyway, that's, like, sitting in the case.
00:19:28.104 - 00:19:40.484, Speaker A: And this is why crypto sells off. Crypto sells off because people take their money to buy prehistoric fish and sell and pay taxes. And so I think. I think maybe we can. Maybe we can build an index for this. Yeah. And credit, credit crises.
00:19:40.484 - 00:19:56.084, Speaker A: I mean, we should be able to build in. I mean, I see this happen over and over in crypto. There's so when you have just, like, a complete amount of froth in the market and people are just doing absurd things with their money that they never thought that they would do otherwise, that's probably. That's always such a good signal.
00:19:56.464 - 00:20:04.512, Speaker B: Well, Dan's on cycle number four now, so I think by then he's earned the license to do some. To buy some prehistoric dinosaur fish.
00:20:04.648 - 00:20:09.688, Speaker A: I mean, I guess Dan's a fossil himself in the crypto industry, so might as well have some fossils.
00:20:09.776 - 00:20:15.964, Speaker B: Well, do you think we're in froth mode right now, Dan? Or do you think that this thing is just going to send after the ETF launches?
00:20:16.504 - 00:20:32.364, Speaker C: This one's hard because. So I'm gonna say this. I don't. I don't have a great insight of what's gonna happen, like, the next couple weeks. Look, I'll say this. If they reject it, it's going down. But, like, assuming that, like, it's going through, right? And, like, everything that seems to be the consensus, like, people smarter than me in that world, like, think that.
00:20:32.364 - 00:20:57.060, Speaker C: I think it's gonna be kind of noisy for a bit. Like a. Like, just because this thing exists doesn't mean, like, people are gonna be, like, immediately, like, oh, now I can, like, find it, but, you know, like, treadfight moves at, like, a speed that's a little bit slower. So I do think, like, even if people want to put that position on, like, it's not just like, oh, day one, boom, get me. There'll be some of that, and, like, that will matter. And, like, retail is, like, like a force. So, like, they can, like, come in, like, rip this thing.
00:20:57.060 - 00:21:23.320, Speaker C: But I think you're going to need a couple weeks to a month, so you, like, get a good idea of what, like, baseline flows are going to be. But, like, the. The back of that is, like, there's going to be sustained inflow, and it's going to matter, and it's going to be good, and it's going to be, like, net, like, sort of, like cash, sort of, like, moving into the industry as a whole. So I think it's going to be a big tailwind, and you also have a having which matters. So I think both those things are going to be, like, I think it's going to get wilder the end of the year, but, like, in the next couple weeks. Like, I don't know. I don't have a bet.
00:21:23.320 - 00:21:44.452, Speaker C: Like, I don't really, like, have, like, if anything, like, we'll probably just, like, if it gets, like, smushed, like, we'll try to grab some, but, like, I don't have, like, a good plan other than that. So that's, like, kind of it just. It's, like, way out of my wheelhouse of how this stuff's going to move. I don't have, like, real conversations with people that would be, like, putting money in this thing. I just, like, I. I'm guessing, but do.
00:21:44.468 - 00:22:05.940, Speaker A: Do you think so? I mean, one thing. One thing that the market was talking about a ton is just right after the fake tweet from Mister Gary ETH BTC just ripped it, ripped it ripped super hard. And it seems like people are just very, very under positioned for that in general. Are you. Are you thinking of getting along long Ethan, after the ETF or what do you think in terms of rotation plays?
00:22:05.972 - 00:22:31.544, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there should be some, like, reversion there, right? Like, ethical just gotten social act. Um, so, like, I think it's a pretty easy one to be also. Do you remember when the CME futures launched and then, like, the next month, like, ETH, bitcoin, like, tripled it? Like, that was, like, the bottom to the second. So I think a little people are looking at it, like, sort of the same way. I think that's probably, like, if you put a gun to my head, like, ETH, bitcoin trades higher, like, on the back of this thing and just, like, sort of, like, drips up. That'd be my guess.
00:22:32.634 - 00:22:35.054, Speaker B: Why do you think ETH is so cursed?
00:22:35.634 - 00:22:57.844, Speaker C: I think it's the easiest, most liquid thing that you've been able to sell against bitcoin for a while. So people that want to get longer it have probably done. So I think that's just the simple on it. It's harder to sell the other basket of vaults and you also would have gotten carried out in it. Just stuff bounce. I just think if you were like, I want to get longer. Bitcoin, selling ETH against it was probably the trade for the last six months, month.
00:22:58.624 - 00:23:42.966, Speaker A: I think we're seeing that market dynamic shift a bit. I mean, if you remember back in the last three four months, every time ETH BTC would rip, the entire alt complex would sell off because it was super clear that everyone was long the alts against short ETH. And this is actually the first time that I'm seeing, look, ETH BTC is up two and a half percent and alts are actually doing okay relative. And so I think people are, it seems like people are starting to work out of that position and that should, in theory, be helpful, helpful for ETH BTC. So, like, load up on your lidos, your arbs, your, your optimisms of the world, and just sort of close your eyes and wait. But I don't know. The, the, the tough part is that if, if this is quote unquote priced in and BTC tops out, I mean, how, how long do we get? Do we get a rally? Right? I think that that's sort of, that's sort of the tough part.
00:23:43.150 - 00:23:56.774, Speaker C: Yeah. I don't know. I probably guess it's like a couple months. I don't know. I don't think it's going to be like the whole year unless there's like some like, real change. Like, unless like activity on ETH just like, goes through a roof and like, your burn just gets so high and the thing just starts to feed on itself.
00:23:58.074 - 00:24:06.734, Speaker A: Are you, is that something that you act, you actively trade? So are you, are you, are you put, putting on, putting on these positions to try to, try to capture these moves?
00:24:07.074 - 00:24:36.756, Speaker C: We, I mean, we'll trade, like, ETH out, right? We don't trade the, like, spreads of like, stuff, like, like Sol ETH or like Avax solo. Like they. I, we just don't do a lot of like, the para trading like I do. I said it's a bunch, like, I wish there was like a real index product for like the top 50. That was, I don't know, I don't know how you'd like, do the weighting. So it wasn't just like bitcoin, but like that you could use as just like a generic, like, hedge of like, exposure, but like, absent that. Like, I mean, sometimes we'll go long alts and we'll like, sell bitcoin and ETH against it.
00:24:36.756 - 00:24:54.114, Speaker C: Sort of like, basically 50 50 is like, most of the times, like, or whatever we got, like, lying around that doesn't have like, great yield. Um, but for the most part, like, we're not like, sort of taking exotic paratrade feds. So as ETH bitcoin is across itself, we don't really trade. Yeah, what's up?
00:24:54.734 - 00:25:30.324, Speaker B: You mentioned earlier that just the combination of the tailwind from ETF inflows plus the halving is just absolutely massive. And you're expecting a bullish second half of the year. Q four. So am I. I'm so ludicrously bullish that I can't see straight. What I can't figure out against that backdrop is that if you have this steadily rallying benchmark asset, what are you supposed to rotate into for the beta plays? I'm so bad at this. And you guys with more experience than me who are more plugged into the market than I am.
00:25:30.324 - 00:25:45.164, Speaker B: Dan, I want to ask you, what sectors are you looking to play for the bull market that you see coming? What are you rotating risk into? Or are you just waiting for now you're going to try to get into that higher beta stuff later?
00:25:46.204 - 00:26:15.346, Speaker C: Yeah, so, like, I mean, the way we generally try to play this stuff is like, it used to be just like you own bitcoin and ETH. When they rip and then flatline, things spray out sort of into, like, the most liquid sort of alts. I mean, that's mostly the other l one s. Like, that's kind of been. Or now, like, the l two s you definitely put in that bucket. So, like, I don't know, call the top five other l one s and, like, arvn op and, I don't know, pick a couple others if you want, but, like, basically stuff that's pretty liquid, but, like, is definitely, like, higher beta. The thing was, like, this time, like, ETH just didn't do that right.
00:26:15.346 - 00:26:40.134, Speaker C: Like, really just, like, bitcoin just, like, ripped out would flatline and then the rest of the alts would rally. But that's generally how we look at it, is like, you see the cash move in and, like, real money come through in the majors, which has just been bitcoin ETH. And then you wait to the stuff that's going to spread. Like, the longer, longer tail of stuff will rip, too. But, like, there's capacity issues. Like, once you start getting outside the other l one s depending on, like, how far you, like, want to go out.
00:26:40.904 - 00:26:58.884, Speaker B: Also, weirdly, like, the inflows that are about to come in are going to come in on tradfi rails. And you can't, like, take your blackrock bitcoin ETF and diversify it into bunk, right? Like, there's no mechanism to do that. So maybe bitcoin will just outperform everything else this cycle. I don't know how to think about it.
00:26:59.344 - 00:27:14.300, Speaker C: Yeah, but if you think about it like that. Bitcoin is getting bought on a cash exchange somewhere from a crypto native person who's now getting cash. Right. And then they're going to take those bullets and do something with them. I think that's the way I generally try to think of how it moves through the system. Yeah.
00:27:14.332 - 00:27:34.512, Speaker B: Maybe at least some percentage of the bitcoin that's getting bought will indeed go rotate into something else. That's a good way of thinking about it. I was assuming that in the past, when there were big bitcoin inflows, they were going on to just random exchanges. And then eventually the holders of those bitcoins get bored and rotated out the risk curve. But no, you're right. You're absolutely right.
00:27:34.708 - 00:27:57.136, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, what is actually going to be super useful is the ETF becomes, like, a marginal asset inside, like, brokerages, as opposed to GBTC, which is a little, like, I think there's only a couple of people that lend against it. That's actually super useful for people that can actually use their bitcoin as a lending product again. Right. You can borrow against that pretty easily. Yeah.
00:27:57.240 - 00:28:13.320, Speaker A: It becomes a much more useful asset. Just like overnight, bitcoin becomes a, you know, becomes so much better to buy because you're not tying up, tying up capital that you can't do anything else with. So, I mean, that could actually lead to another. Yeah, could lead to just another credit.
00:28:13.352 - 00:28:28.484, Speaker B: Boom cycle, like Schwab or Fidelity will give grandma leverage to buy the blackrock bitcoin ETF, too. So you don't. You don't need to try too hard to imagine some scenarios where people get pretty levered long.
00:28:28.884 - 00:28:42.864, Speaker C: Or you could just, like, you could have 100 bitcoin worth of shares of the ETF, and now you can, like, use that to get a margin loan to buy, like, a house. Like, you could think the. It's so useful having that thing, like, not like, as Grayscale's version of it.
00:28:45.244 - 00:28:50.064, Speaker B: Yeah, Grayscale's version. Absolutely. Carted out some of your competitors.
00:28:51.084 - 00:29:14.300, Speaker C: I can't believe the wrecking ball that thing cost. I mean, we got hurt with it too, right? Like, when that bar was getting called in, like, we had, like, some of that spread on and it, like, just torched us. Like, there was nothing you could do about it too. Like, that's what I was saying. Like, that stuff like that. Like, there wasn't a ton you could do to avoid it because the thought was always like, all right, like, if blockfi falls down, I'll just go, like, borrow it from Celsius or go borrow it from Genesis. The problem was, like, everybody was dead.
00:29:14.300 - 00:29:23.984, Speaker C: So you're like, fuck, like, there's nothing. Like, there's nobody to go to anymore. Like, unless you could go find something bilateral, but then nobody wanted to face anybody anyway, so it didn't matter. I don't know.
00:29:24.064 - 00:29:51.382, Speaker A: After, honestly, after that, like, after hearing that, how do you, how do you keep your head in the game? I mean, this, this is something that I work, I work on a ton with myself, and I don't, I don't really have a great, a great answer, but this market just sometimes just takes, takes you out and just slaps you around and just being able to keep your head in the game. I mean, so many people, they, you know, they make, they make a few million bucks. They check out. It's like, how do you keep your head in the game? You're like, all right, I'm going to get back on. I'm going to keep. Keep attacking this bull markets around the corner. Like, let me stay on top of it.
00:29:51.382 - 00:29:54.510, Speaker A: I mean, you do take vacations.
00:29:54.702 - 00:30:18.034, Speaker C: I got nothing else to do, so that helps. No, I mean, I say this, I say this a lot. I say definitely to, like, guys were younger. It's like, there's going to be periods where it's, like, terrible. Just, like, take that time and do something, like, else. Like, because there's, there is 100% in the bull market, you just start letting other aspects of your life, like, fall to shit, right? Like, you, like, don't keep up with friends. Like, you're, like, not talking to your family.
00:30:18.034 - 00:30:49.080, Speaker C: Like, your health is like, like, use the down periods where, like, there's nothing going on and, like, the charts terrible. Like, everything's just getting carted and, like, you have a position and you just, like, don't, like, use that time and be like, get your life in order because, like, you know, you're not. You're not gonna get it when it turns. So you have to, like, be really good about your time management. I think, like, that's something you, like, take a couple cycles to, like, figure out. It's like, when it's slow and bad and, like, all 22, you could basically, like, have gone away and, like, fucked off and it wouldn't have mattered. Like, you would have come back and everything was the same price it was when you were there and you didn't miss a damn thing.
00:30:49.080 - 00:31:11.824, Speaker C: So use that sort of period when you can. And if you have the resources, obviously, to, like, get the other aspects of your life, like, squared away. That's like, I think a big takeaway that I've, like, gotten over time otherwise, though. But you gotta remember, like, when it's the worst, it's when everybody's getting blown out. Like, that's when the opportunity isn't just chill. Like, you don't have to do anything. Well, this is also, like, why we don't use a lot leverage.
00:31:11.824 - 00:31:35.748, Speaker C: Like, even though we were very active with the borrow and, like, we do, I say that, like, we try to avoid leverage, but, like, we obviously have used it. We try to do it more, like, not just like outright loan, but you gotta, like, leverage causes, like, an issue of, like, time. So, like, you suddenly have to, like, have things happen in a re. Like, or at least like, it adds a clock aspect to it. If you could just, like, not do anything, like, it's great, then just, like, don't fret. Just, like, chill. I don't know, people.
00:31:35.748 - 00:31:41.126, Speaker C: People get overworked. I think it's because, like, the industry is moving so fast, everyone feels they need to be doing something at any given time.
00:31:41.300 - 00:31:59.490, Speaker B: Do you still believe in the industry as much as you did on day one? Like, are you. Are you mentioned earlier in the podcast that you were back in the day in 2013? It was real crazies, real believers. Are you still a real believer? And if so, what do you see this transforming in general? I want to hear your philosophy.
00:31:59.682 - 00:32:26.120, Speaker C: I still buy the idea that stateless money is a very big, important thing. And I think the ability to just send value to whoever you want is, like, super useful. I think also stable coins are like a massive, just like, leap. And I think they're a huge tool. That being said, I think the industry is getting. It's become more of a casino as time has gone on. Not that it wasn't in the past, it was just a smaller aspect of the flows.
00:32:26.120 - 00:32:33.714, Speaker C: I think it's just dominates now. And people don't even try to hide it. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. I just think it's is what it is.
00:32:34.334 - 00:32:45.982, Speaker B: I agree. Like, I mean, casinos in real life kind of suck, but I mean, look at bonk. Your odds are way better than double zero. Right. And it's probably more fun. And you get to tweet about it.
00:32:46.118 - 00:32:46.342, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:46.358 - 00:32:49.354, Speaker A: And you get to be part. You get to be part of a community, which I think is missing.
00:32:50.054 - 00:33:07.390, Speaker C: Yeah. People want to be part of me. I, like I said, like, I don't feel strongly either way about it. I just, like it has definitely become a bigger portion of, like, the ecosystem. Like, as basically every year since 2017, once ico started to kind of, like, just never came back. Do you.
00:33:07.422 - 00:33:21.526, Speaker B: Do you think, you know, to the serious people out there building on crypto, do you think there's anything that's, you know, valuable that's going to get built that we're not paying attention to, be it games or real world assets or DPin or any of the shit that people are talking about these days? Are you focused on?
00:33:21.590 - 00:33:41.916, Speaker C: I don't know. I tend to, like, not give it a ton of thought until it's too late, and that's fine, because, like, most of the time, it's just been a fade. Like, I was even, like, skeptical of stable coins for a really long time. Like, when tether came out, I was like, this is stupid. I was like, why would you use dollars? And then, like, as time went on, I was like, oh. Like, this is why. So, like, I don't know.
00:33:41.916 - 00:33:59.554, Speaker C: I'm probably just, like, irrationally pessimistic about, like, things initially, but, like, you gotta remember there's been so many cycles of this stuff, right? Like, it was stos, and then it was, like, remittances, and then it was, like, every two years, there's, like, a new thing that, like, I don't know. So those have generally just been a fade?
00:34:00.174 - 00:34:37.856, Speaker A: Yeah, I honestly, I like that. I like that approach because I think that's how you see the market with clear eyes, is when you recognize that there are tailwinds to this of useful things that are probably going to work. But at the end of the day, we're traders, and we're here to make money, and we're here to focus on that. And that we just know that this is the most inefficient market we've seen in our lifetime, and let's just figure out how to take advantage of that in the biggest way possible. I actually think that if you focus too much on the fundamentals, you just get lost in the weeds on it. And so it's just about, okay, well, what are the good trades? How do we make money? And so, I mean, it's. I know, I know.
00:34:37.856 - 00:34:46.684, Speaker A: I know. It sounds. Sounds kind of silly to be like, all right, we'll throw out the fundamentals, but it's true. I've just seen so many people in crypto get sidetracked by that.
00:34:47.984 - 00:35:05.674, Speaker C: Yeah. And maybe I'm just not smart enough to, like, be in the weeds, like, thinking about, like, the ramifications of all this stuff. So I like, here's the example, like, real world assets. I cannot square in my head how that's going to work in crypto, but maybe I'm wrong and people just figure it out, but in my mind, I'm like, I don't understand how these two are going to jive.
00:35:06.694 - 00:35:25.944, Speaker B: Would you buy it on a narrative? Like, oh, real world assets seem to be gaining traction amongst the community of short term investors. I would like to get ahead of that before it migrates from telegram to Twitter, and then I'll pitch it back out when, when the thing goes parabolic. Like, do you do. Do those short term types of meme or narrative trades or. Not really.
00:35:26.644 - 00:35:43.064, Speaker C: It's more like we'll be like, all right, this worldwide asset thing's flying three names of, like, tripled. Like, what are the other names that haven't? And, like, why should we own those? And, like, not give. Like, that would be more like what we do then, like, smart. Like, we're just, like, not early enough to, like, be, like, catching the whole thing. Like, we're just, like, reactive.
00:35:44.464 - 00:35:54.444, Speaker B: But you did do a ton of vc, and I guess it was 1819 and 20 during the doldrums of that bear market, right? And then you thousand xed a bunch of shit.
00:35:55.304 - 00:36:12.128, Speaker C: Yeah. I think a lot of that logic was just like, tokens had become very out of vogue. There was a period in 2019, 2020 where it had been like, tokens are worthless. Equity is the thing. This was all like a joke. And we were like, I don't know, I think people still like tokens. I think they're going to.
00:36:12.128 - 00:36:45.234, Speaker C: So we were just kind of doing it also. We, we got, like, we did, like, very well out of the gate and we were just, like, financing everything we were getting a look at for a period because, like, we just had so much money coming in from the trading side that, like, we just, like, kept cutting sort of checks. Um, so, like, that was like, also just like, it was just like, luck that we were, like, it was all happening sort of at the same time. So, like, that was also, like, part of the thesis was just like, we have, like, a lot of excess capacity. Like, we're not, we haven't, like, we're new, we haven't done a lot in venture anyway. Like, let's just see where this stuff, like, goes. And then we just sort of had caught, like, a period where there had been massive underinvestment on the token side of things.
00:36:46.614 - 00:37:13.294, Speaker A: I honestly think we're sort of in that period right now. I wonder how you're thinking about venture right now, but it seems like prices haven't necessarily caught up with what tokens are actually doing. Right now I'm still seeing deals for 15 2025 mil of things that probably can come out at 50 to 100 if the market stays hot. So like, I actually think that seems like it's a good time to start the spray and pray again from my perspective.
00:37:14.274 - 00:37:45.974, Speaker C: I'll tell you what's something that's been interesting and I didn't even really understand that. I didn't understand it was just how much of the building of other primitives on bitcoin is and how hot that is in Asia. A whole market that's big and relatively cheap. Cheap on the venture side that we're just ignoring here. That's just everything they're talking about. And you saw this happen. A couple of these tokens roofed and went to billion dollar valuations and nobody had even heard of them here.
00:37:47.754 - 00:37:49.534, Speaker A: This is really all coming out of Asia.
00:37:50.354 - 00:38:03.944, Speaker C: That's as far as I see it. One of our guys was over in Hong Kong for a month and he was like, this is the only thing people are talking about over here is like ordinals and stuff like that. And like building Defi on bitcoin. He's like, but nobody talks about it here.
00:38:06.284 - 00:38:14.784, Speaker A: That's kind of interesting. I mean, should be very good for bitcoin miners, that's for sure. Let's get, get the, get to get the fees up.
00:38:15.404 - 00:38:19.064, Speaker C: As a business I perennially hate, like, it should be very good for them.
00:38:19.964 - 00:38:31.278, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's funny, it's like, it's such a terrible business because you know, you know that you're income is basically going to zero over time. But at the same time these things ten x in the last bull cycle.
00:38:31.446 - 00:38:50.998, Speaker C: So I just, I've seen, I've just seen. So I've like. Of all of the like bad investment I've ever seen like in this industry over my time, like 90% of it was like minors. Like it's just like always, like every time, terrible, terrible outcomes for everybody except for like the handful in Asia that you don't have access to that like.
00:38:51.086 - 00:38:53.340, Speaker B: Crush it marathon's done.
00:38:53.372 - 00:39:02.304, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah, I think that you're right though. That has changed a lot now that a lot of them are public. But that's just scarred into my brain so I think I can't shake it.
00:39:02.604 - 00:39:06.264, Speaker A: Well speaking of that, what's the worst investment you've ever made in crypto?
00:39:06.844 - 00:39:39.740, Speaker C: I mean we had a lot of rugs so there's a lot of zeros. There's a lot of just smoldering craters in the book. Those are probably some. I think the biggest ones that I, like, fucked up were when I was at circle, we were trading OTC and we had just started trading ETH OTC. It was the second asset we had gotten. And we had a New York tech fund that was coming in, buying 100,000 lots of ETH, like, units every day. And I remember just like, thinking about it being like, these guys don't know what they're doing.
00:39:39.740 - 00:40:04.494, Speaker C: These guys are clowns. Like, instead of just like, looking, being like, oh, like, this is like a thing. And like, people are like, throwing real money into it. At the time, it wasn't a ton of and like, basically just money, like, not getting balls long. ETH then was like a huge mistake, especially because I had, I was seeing it, like, I was like, watching the flows and like, I was impacting the market and I was just like, fading myself and I was like, I don't know, looking back on, I was like, that was like the easiest layup that I just didn't take.
00:40:06.194 - 00:40:28.714, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, this market, this market, it'll teach you a lot of lessons, that's for sure. There, there are, there are always going to be things that, you know, you, you sold out before that, before the thousand x or that, you know, you know, you hit, you held for too long and then you just get like, rugged on completely. Like Luna. Um, that's, I mean, that, that's just part of that. Part of the addictive. Addictive part of it.
00:40:29.254 - 00:40:33.974, Speaker C: We did that round that they did in like January and like, the money was gone in like February.
00:40:34.054 - 00:40:34.590, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:40:34.662 - 00:40:42.854, Speaker C: Like we. Oh, yeah, yeah, that was a, that was a huge one that we just like, got obliterated on. Yeah, we like punched that ticket and then it was like dead.
00:40:43.154 - 00:41:26.478, Speaker B: Remember, remember when Doe, Kwan and some trading company executives who shall go unnamed, went around and tried to raise money at the last minute from everybody in the market to try and prop up the price of Luna? That was the craziest pitch I have ever heard in the history of my business endeavors. That was insane. I couldn't even believe it. They're like, yeah, yeah, we want to raise a billion dollars. Well, how do you know a billion dollars is the right amount and do Kwan's like, yeah, well, you know, it's, we looked at all the exchanges and that's how much is on the offer in the stack and we just want to take it out. I remember saying like, well, what if there's more in the stack, like an iceberg, you know, extra volume that's there that you can't see. He's like, oh, well, we just think that the news from the raise will, you know, scare off the offers.
00:41:26.478 - 00:41:32.394, Speaker B: So you just, like, give us $100 million. And I just remember thinking through this, I was like, is this a real industry?
00:41:32.514 - 00:41:34.010, Speaker C: Like, I mean, no, it's like, like.
00:41:34.042 - 00:41:35.890, Speaker A: You said, not a serious industry. Not.
00:41:36.002 - 00:41:36.442, Speaker C: I remember.
00:41:36.498 - 00:41:49.618, Speaker A: I remember. I remember that pitch super well. So we called it. I remember asking, hey, I'm on the phone with Doe. Hey, how big is the hole? Well, you know, it's, you know, two. Two to 3 billion. And you want to raise a billion to cover a two to $3 billion hole?
00:41:49.746 - 00:41:50.194, Speaker C: Take out.
00:41:50.234 - 00:41:58.920, Speaker B: Take out the offers. You know, take out the offer. It'll scare the market higher. Yeah, it's just. It was crazy. Anyway, I'm sure you've seen a bunch of those. Dan, what's the worst pitch you've ever seen in crypto?
00:41:59.112 - 00:42:23.346, Speaker C: Oh, God. I mean, some of the original pitches in the IcO boom were just like, they were existing, like, venture backed companies that were just like, we're going to do a token. And that was it. Like, they'd be like, they'd take their existing pitch deck that they just used for whatever their, like, series B was or whatever, and then, like, the end, they would just be like, we're going to launch a token. There was a ton of those. This went on for, like, months when, like, the Ico boom was going, and people were like, this is just free money. I'm going to, like, a bunch of tokens.
00:42:23.346 - 00:42:47.122, Speaker C: So we saw I at least a dozen of those where I was like, there's nothing here besides, like, your existing equity pitch. And then, like, now it has a token, and you can only invest in a token. So there was some funny ones. There was like, I mean, there's, like, other ones. It was like, what was the one? It was like, it was for, like, chefs. I feel like it was like ambrosia or something like that. I remember that one being like, this is the 2017 ICO pitches were the best.
00:42:47.122 - 00:42:49.684, Speaker C: Those were, like, the, like, most half baked by far.
00:42:50.104 - 00:43:10.884, Speaker A: I know. It was just nice because they were also just so clear what was happening that you understood that you were basically investing into this thing that just had nothing, absolutely nothing behind it. Whereas as we've progressed, things have been dressed up a little bit. People put little flares on it. Oh, no, no. We're actually solving this issue. I'm like, guys, just tell me how the token's going up.
00:43:10.884 - 00:43:15.068, Speaker A: That's what really matters at the end of the day.
00:43:15.176 - 00:43:28.864, Speaker C: It's funny, man. Yeah. God, that was. That was a special time in crypto. I still stand by 2017 with the wildest period I've ever traded through. I, like, 2021 was a mania, but, like, doesn't hold the candle to 2017.
00:43:30.164 - 00:43:53.834, Speaker A: I mean, it was just so much, so much fun. Honestly, back then, also, I was. I was bright eyed and bushy tailed. So maybe I have just a little bit of nostalgia, nostalgia for those days. I mean, by the time 2021 came around, it was definitely a little bit more jaded. But, you know, in 2017, I was sitting there clicking, spamming my ETH to get into these icos, hoping that I paid enough gas to fucking, fucking get in. You remember those?
00:43:54.614 - 00:44:00.438, Speaker C: What is it? Like, the. Was it the SmT ico where, like, eats just stopped working for, like, two days?
00:44:00.526 - 00:44:01.194, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:03.854 - 00:44:08.406, Speaker C: I was like, how is this okay? Like, everybody's just, like, accepting this. Yeah.
00:44:08.590 - 00:44:10.234, Speaker A: Future of finance, baby.
00:44:11.044 - 00:44:32.180, Speaker C: Yeah, I remember. I remember the BCH fork happening, and there was, like, a very sharp guy that we had on the desk who was, like, convinced that, like, oh, like, the fork value will come out and, like, bitcoin will go down by whatever it is. And, like, instead, they both just, like, rallied after, like, bitcoin. Price never even went down. And he's like, I don't understand. People aren't, like, pricing the fork. I was like, dude, it doesn't fucking matter.
00:44:32.180 - 00:44:35.304, Speaker C: Like, nobody cares. I was like, they're just gonna buy both now?
00:44:35.944 - 00:44:48.164, Speaker A: Yeah. At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is how many eyeballs are on an asset. And so if there's. If there's a fork happening, more people are looking at it. I guess it's going up. No, it's just funny how that works.
00:44:48.544 - 00:45:13.118, Speaker C: We made a fortune on that trade because OKX was still crediting you the fork, even though. So the way. Because they have coin margin futures, like, they still do. But, like, that was the dominant one they had then, and that was, like, really the most liquid future because Bitmex wasn't as high as it was. So we were massively short the back of the curve. And you post spot as collateral, but they credit you the fork, right? So you get the fork for free. And the curve collapsed, like, into sort of the event.
00:45:13.118 - 00:45:37.914, Speaker C: And we made a fortune on this trade because we just, like, kept putting more and more of it on and, like, just the market just, like, didn't care. And I remember, like, talking to Jeremy and Sean at circle about it, and they were, like, explaining it, and they, like, they kept, like, trying to find, like, the loophole. And I was like, no, the only loophole here is, like, okay, x, like, just takes our money, but, like, they always have that risk, but, like, really, we're always wearing the same prize we have. Anyway, I was like, this is free. I was like, it's free money. Just people just, like, choose not to, like, want it.
00:45:39.374 - 00:46:02.202, Speaker B: Interesting. The only free money I've ever been given in crypto is when the ETH work versus ETH fork happened, and we FTx undercredited us ETH work versus our ETH. So we complained over the customer service channel, and then SBF replied with, oh, sorry, guys, just. Just take. Take some more eats work, and, like, just, you know, magically airdropped us.
00:46:02.258 - 00:46:41.256, Speaker C: Looking back on, it didn't matter, right? Why not give them free shit anyway? Yeah, have some fun. Yeah, my DevOps guys did a cool trade with that one where they. Because, like, so, like, I forget how exactly they did it, but they. Because, like, all the assets, like, became worthless on the e three of work. Like, right? Like, because you didn't have to, like, deliver them. Like, all the pools got super imbalanced, like, immediately, and you had, like, a couple blocks to do it. But our guy who runs DevOps was able to have, like, an ETH node running the first day, like, on the first block, and they were, like, he was able to, like, drain all of it and, like, take, like, he got, like, a ton of free ETH group of work on the other side.
00:46:41.256 - 00:46:50.704, Speaker C: It was, like, a really complicated trade that he, like, put off, but, like, it ended up making, like, a ton of money. And I was like, this is just the dumbest sort of reason, but, like, why not? That's a sick trade.
00:46:51.324 - 00:47:27.336, Speaker A: We ran something similar, but way less sophisticated, which is that we actually came in after the chain and everything was priced ridiculously low, and we thought there was a reasonable chance that some of these things could turn into meme coins. So we just bought all of the meme coins that were on ETH that were priced at effectively zero for the USDC that we had on there. It didn't end up working. I think maybe at some point during the bull market it might. Yeah, I still have them, but I basically, like, own a bunch of these meme coins on ETH that I bought for literally, like, $5, and I own 10% of the supply. Just, like, maybe one day.
00:47:27.360 - 00:47:33.364, Speaker C: You gotta go lobby. You gotta lobby. Okay. Start listing them, and that's how you get it.
00:47:33.744 - 00:47:37.736, Speaker B: Dan, I'm late for a date with my wife. I gotta jump, but you guys keep going.
00:47:37.800 - 00:47:41.718, Speaker C: Yeah, do what you gotta do. I got jet, too, actually. Yeah. Okay.
00:47:41.846 - 00:47:42.726, Speaker A: Well, dude, this was.
00:47:42.750 - 00:47:43.390, Speaker C: This. This was.
00:47:43.422 - 00:47:52.022, Speaker A: This was an awesome, awesome, uh, awesome, awesome conversation. Ton of. Ton of content. Super packed. Thanks for coming on. You got to come on again once you get the fish put together.
00:47:52.198 - 00:47:57.394, Speaker C: Yeah, seriously, this fish is never getting put together. This doesn't box forever.
00:48:00.894 - 00:48:02.118, Speaker A: Or taskrabbit.
00:48:02.206 - 00:48:12.884, Speaker C: Just to put it together. It's fucking heavy. We had to carry it up here for the next one. I'll see, but it wouldn't fit here. It's too big.
00:48:13.304 - 00:48:14.144, Speaker A: That's so funny.
00:48:14.184 - 00:48:22.416, Speaker B: Maybe you should make a Game of Thrones style boss chair for yourself. Made out of ancient. Oh, whale bones. Yeah, that would.
00:48:22.440 - 00:48:25.840, Speaker C: Pretty sick. Yeah. Like, have the intern do that.
00:48:26.032 - 00:48:31.124, Speaker B: There's a CMS intern on Twitter. Just hit them up and get that thing assembled.
00:48:31.804 - 00:48:36.900, Speaker C: Be like, listen, you're hired. You just gotta make me a chair. All right, dude.
00:48:36.932 - 00:48:40.324, Speaker B: Great to meet you, Dan. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it.
