00:00:00.240 - 00:00:16.974, Speaker A: When I think about, like, you know, what a future for crypto looks like, I think we're moving in the right direction a lot of different ways. Right? We're seeing lower latency blockchains, we're seeing higher TPS, better proving systems. But really, at the end of the day, we can build the best infrastructure possible. But if people aren't building applications on top of it, then it doesn't fucking matter.
00:00:17.062 - 00:00:27.290, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by perennial finance, the on chain defi primitive, redesigning derivatives for the Defi native. You'll hear more about perennial later in the show.
00:00:34.670 - 00:01:12.576, Speaker C: Welcome back through another 1000 x. We have a very special guest here, who I'll introduce in a second, but just to take a step back, Jonah and I have been talking about making real investments and doing real things and finding things with real product fit and real value in crypto and how difficult that is. So, with all that in mind, we've brought on Smokey from Barachain today, which, when I first found out about it, I legitimately thought this thing was a complete meme. I think this was two years ago. I just thought it was a joke. And then it actually turned into something very real. And Smokey is here to explain to us how it is both real and not real at the same time.
00:01:12.576 - 00:01:14.820, Speaker C: Welcome, Smokey. Glad to have you.
00:01:15.280 - 00:01:34.396, Speaker A: Thank you for having me, guys. Yeah. Truly, the duality of man or bear, if you will. Yeah, that was actually really funny. I don't know if you still remember, Avi, but back in the day, when you slow into my DM's, it was because there was a pasta going around on Twitter, and it was like, bear chain does not exist. And, like, a few more lines, and you just hit my DM's with that. And then I responded with the exact same thing.
00:01:34.396 - 00:01:48.788, Speaker A: And I think we repeated that for, like, four or five iterations, and then you're like, anyway, what the fuck is this thing? And, like, should I be investing? I was like, yeah, totally. And then that somehow devolved into us making fun of you and Steve Tannenbaum and a number of other things.
00:01:48.964 - 00:01:54.880, Speaker C: Yeah, that was a hilarious, hilarious introduction because I genuinely thought this was just a meme coin launch.
00:01:55.400 - 00:01:56.672, Speaker A: Yeah, me too. I didn't.
00:01:56.696 - 00:02:06.168, Speaker C: I didn't. Yeah, I didn't. I didn't really know. I didn't really know what it was. I just thought the content was really funny. Every time I saw it, I would crack that on. I looked at the bomb bears, like, dude, this stuff is great.
00:02:06.168 - 00:02:51.824, Speaker C: But when I originally was talking to you, guys, I mean, I couldn't, I couldn't really wrap my head around what the hell you guys were actually trying to do, other than just be hilarious and fast forward two years. You've actually, you've done a lot of, you seem to have accomplished a lot. I see, like, some pretty insane headlines in the news, like Vera chain raises from insert all top vc's that have ever existed. And what's kind of fascinating to me is that you've managed to combine this sort of weird, whimsical nature with what seems to be real tech. Dude, how did veriching even start? Like, what did, how did you come up with the idea?
00:02:51.992 - 00:03:41.300, Speaker A: The backstory is honestly like a series of unfortunate, unfortunate events, if I think about it. I'll give you, like, quick background on myself, my co founders, you know, without doing too doxy, you know, myself, my co founder, Papa, have been in the space for like, the better part of a decade. Definitely not like OG Eth Ico, but, you know, a couple years after we're both originally founders in the healthcare space, you know, raised and scaled companies, raised venture capital, blah, blah, blah, did the whole shebang in the valley, all your classic meme bullshit, and of course, had fun along the way buying shitcoins. One of my first investors in my first company was pretty senior at the Eats foundation back in the day. So when you're living in the Bay Area and seeing a whole bunch of people running in a given direction, you either think everyone else is stupid or you're stupid. And I know for a fact I'm very stupid. So I decided to at least take a shot and follow the crowd a little bit and fuck around the space.
00:03:41.300 - 00:04:24.752, Speaker A: And then I think watching the market evolve over the 2017 to 2018 absolute meme ICO cycle and then more interesting, unique things popping up in terms of union curve and aave and compensated and urine and everything else in between. And Defi Summer was always keeping a pretty steady pulse on things while, you know, effectively in my day job as a founder than a VC. And I think that at some point, it was probably, it was early, it was late 2020 slash early summer 21 when pop and I had been messing around with a whole bunch of these, like, defi 2.0. You know, I say ecosystems and discords. So, like, fracs, alchemics, like all that kind of stuff. Olympus, of course, can't forget the boys. And we found that, like, NFts were starting to take an interesting turn.
00:04:24.752 - 00:04:53.480, Speaker A: On one hand, they were starting to become a little bit more financialized and, like, beyond your ten k profile picture collections. And on the other hand, you're starting to see things that might have interesting utility, as much of a meme as that's become three years in the future. In that I think it was parallel. That actually was a little bit of an aha moment for us. And they were like, oh, cool. These high quality matches, the gathering hearthstone on chain type cards, and they're going to have revenue accrual potential. They're going to turn into something that's more than just like, look at my eight, bro.
00:04:53.480 - 00:05:29.982, Speaker A: And we thought that was interesting. So of course we chose to launch an NFT collection of 100 completely useless bears smoking weed because we thought it was funny having been inspired by the greats. And it honestly just started like, hey, let's see what we could do with the NFT project and see where we could take it. It was like, it was very much make it up as you go. And we actually decided to raffle these off at like 0.069 Ethan in a whole bunch of different like heavily defi oriented discords. So we ended up doing by accident, was cultivating this like initial community of like, of bong bear holders that were highly left curve because they were willing to buy a Jpeg of a bear smoking weed for no apparent reason.
00:05:29.982 - 00:06:35.152, Speaker A: But like, you know, pretty defi native and tuned in and sharp as well from the communities that they came from. And I think after enough times where the group was like, when marketing, you know, what happens next? Like when roadmap Dev, we were like, huh, maybe we should do something like kind of spicy with this and see we can where we can take it. So we decided to make those NFTs like, you know, effectively rebase. Definitely not, you know, 8000% APY good old days rebase, but expand over time such that if you hold one of the first NFT collections, then you would automatically be entitled to claim one of the one, the NFTs from the second collection for free, with a small amount being minted as like inflation every time, so that new people can enter and like buy into it. And what we ended up doing over the course of like four or five collections was effectively bootstrapping a community of a couple thousand like real users, which feels like an oddity nowadays in terms of people who are like, on one hand, like, hey, these are kind of fun, like Picardy game theory mechanics with these multiplying bears. And on the other hand, maybe there's an actual interesting, like end game or community there. And at some point we'd actually talked to, like, the Olympus guys about what it would look like to build ohm chain, just because we thought that was a funny and interesting concept.
00:06:35.152 - 00:07:24.014, Speaker A: There was, you know, whole thoughts about what a reserve currency could actually look like. And despite, you know, perhaps falls from grace or a number of, you know, reductions in sentiment over the past few years, I think there were a lot of cool ideas that came out of the Olympus DeFi 2.0 ecosystem, like protocol and liquidity. And a lot of that stuff really did sort of like, find its existence there. And at some point, after talking to those guys for long enough, along with the own community that we had developed, who was largely like traders, developers, retail users, we just tried to better understand, like, the problems that they were facing in their day to day user environments. And one thing that came up a ton that was just, you know, kind of silly at first thought was just the trade off that was experienced between liquidity and security when someone's actually allocating capital on network. And that nine out of ten times, it's, okay, I have 32 eth.
00:07:24.014 - 00:08:35.580, Speaker A: Do I run a node, or do I toss this in? Do I toss this in? Your dexs, your uniswaps, your aaves, what have you, and stuff like Lido and Nigen Layer has very much started to move this in the right direction in terms of allowing one to use lsts to go a lot further. But nonetheless, that isn't actually a native out the gates thing. It's something that you opt into. It's something that's very much an option. It's not a default, if you will. We thought to ourselves, it was really illogical, especially after viewing so many ghost chains in that 2021 2022 cycle with hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars securing the chain, but absolutely zero capital or activity actually active on the network, that this had become the metagame. We thought to ourselves, what if it was possible to effectively build an ecosystem that allow you to effectively align incentives between liquidity and security at the protocol level? I think more importantly, along that timeframe as well, we were in the peak of this bullshit zero interest rates phenomenon, like drug rants at everything meta, where the only differential between a builder going to chain a or chain b was how much money are you going to throw at them? Which I think is incredibly cursed, completely stupid, and just generally a waste of time and funds, and attracts the wrong type of builders.
00:08:35.580 - 00:09:32.950, Speaker A: I guess the secondary point in the back of our heads was, is there a way that we can actually build a system from a mechanism, design incentives, design point of view, if you will, at that protocol level that's meant to drive value to the application layer. Because when I think about what a future for crypto looks like, I think we're moving in the right direction a lot of different ways. We're seeing lower latency blockchains, we're seeing higher TPS, we're seeing effectively better proving systems, so on and so forth. But really, at the end of the day, we can build the best infrastructure possible. But if people aren't building applications on top of it, then it doesn't fucking matter. And I think there are some very like clear use cases that are quite basic in terms of stable coins, payments, etcetera. But I think my strong belief is that if you don't have applications that are uniquely built or existing in an on chain environment, then there's very little impetus for someone to actually go from a web two world to a web3 world and start actually using them, right? And we see bear chain as more than anything a bet on the application layer powered by the chain itself.
00:09:32.950 - 00:09:57.150, Speaker A: So if I sum this all up and put these rambles into a nutshell, we thought that it made a lot of sense to build bear chain because it's the first l one that allows users to effectively turn their liquidity into security without adding leverage, risk, etcetera, and actually use that liquidity to help power the protocols that are building on the chain itself. Hopefully that gives a little bit of context on the story, how we got here, all that kind of good stuff.
00:09:59.100 - 00:10:01.920, Speaker C: That is a deeply articulate take for a bear.
00:10:03.940 - 00:10:05.520, Speaker A: Yours in the forest, man.
00:10:05.820 - 00:10:56.782, Speaker C: You know what's kind of interesting is that we've been talking for a while about how it's sometimes hard to see how you derive value for the base layer from the application layer, right? In theory, the application layer at some point in the future should be worth a lot more than the baseline, because the applications are what's actually driving people to use the platform. It's what people are actually engaging with. In theory, they should be able to generate some economic value because of that. Now, in the cases of chains like Solana, or really, really high throughput, high scalable chains having that value accrue back to the chain, it's a little bit tough. The chain is effectively just a place for you to run code. That's it. And you get some security for that, but it's just a place for you to run code.
00:10:56.782 - 00:11:22.478, Speaker C: You've brought this idea about the application and the base layer a little bit closer together. That's what you're tying it together. But one question for you is, does that improve stability of the platform, or are there risks to embedding applications so closely with the base layer in terms of security, like what you're describing?
00:11:22.614 - 00:12:28.170, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's all a matter of, like, nuance in the process. Right? So the way the bear chain works, like, at a fundamental level, is that while the network itself is still secured, like from a, you know, a stake perspective, by the bear token, which is like the gas token of the network, is like, you know, relatively generic in that sense, used to pay fees, etcetera. Where it actually does become interested is like the flow of value and the flow of emissions across the network. So like a typical proof of stake chain, right? The vast majority of those, of those emissions and block rewards as the chain inflates or as more blocks are produced, end up going to validators and their delegates. And in most cases, in a lot of cases, in proof of stake chains, they just sort of end up going to the validators. And while they play a very important role in maintaining the security of the network and keeping it up and running, they aren't necessarily the groups that are actually driving new value or bringing new applications, like we talked about, into that network itself. I think that in a world where the biggest meme is like, cool, we've got all this infrastructure and all these layers for people to build stuff on, but no one building things on it, or users to actually, actually use the apps, that seemed really counterintuitive to us as well.
00:12:28.170 - 00:13:24.680, Speaker A: So the way that baritone actually works is that validators have to post a standard bond with Bera to effectively come online or turn on their validator, but then they're also able to get BGT delegated to them. BGT is the illiquid, soul bound reward emissions token of bearachain, which is what block rewards are actually given out in. Now, the thing is, the only way to earn VGT is via providing liquidity on the network in a set of different venues when the chain goes live. This is a pretty vanilla, pretty basic set of defi primitives. So a Dex, a perps vault, and a stablecoin lending market. But over time, and this is where, you know, things might get spicier from a security, et cetera point of view, is that it can extend to really any application on the network as voted in via governance. So you could think of it as like curvification of the chain from an emissions perspective at the network level, right? And instead of those emissions only being able to go to pools and decks actually able to go to any smart contract on the chain.
00:13:24.680 - 00:13:58.906, Speaker A: Now the thing is, a given validator always has the same likelihood of proposing a block. However, a validator with more BGT delegated towards it. That is, more people who have provided liquidity choosing to delegate towards it will produce a larger block reward when it actually produces a block. So in this way, the security of the network is not actually threatened in any manner because there's always bearer at stake, secure in the network. But the validators that have effectively worked with the people who have provided the most liquidity to the network stand to gain the most from producing larger block rewards when they actually hit a block.
00:13:58.978 - 00:14:21.646, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by perennial finance. Perennial is quickly becoming one of the go to derivatives platforms and liquidity layers for all of DeFi. So let me tell you a little bit about them. There are kind of three things you need right when you're thinking about a place and a platform to trade on. First one, great trade execution. Second one, low fees. And third of course, an on chain permissionless platform.
00:14:21.646 - 00:15:01.304, Speaker B: And perennial nails all three of those buckets. With the launch of Perennial V two, theyve made all of that possible by introducing a ton of new features such as faster oracles which reduce trade execution to seconds, lower fees competing with major centralized exchanges and minimizing fees for both takers and makers. Markets which allow the protocol to support any price feed out there. And fourth, cash settled, right? The trades are cash settled in USD, not in crypto. Perennial allows you, the trader, to gain access to deeper liquidity with only a fraction of the TVL. How it works is that perennial enables a two sided market made up of both traders and liquidity providers. Right.
00:15:01.304 - 00:15:30.516, Speaker B: Traders deposit the assets to get levered exposure, while liquidity providers provide these pools of capital to earn fees for taking the other side of the trader position. Perennial allows you to trade crypto, herps, FX and coming soon, nfts and more. Backed by some of the best investors in the industry, perennial is a must checkout platform. If you're a crypto trader, go check them out by clicking the link in the description. Give thousand x some credit. Go check out perennial, you're gonna love them. All right, let's get back to the show.
00:15:30.588 - 00:16:15.176, Speaker D: Okay, so just zooming back out a bit, but I have this sort of theory about crypto right now that I've taken a lot of heat for and I wanted to run it by you because it ties into that specific point you just made. Basically, I'm worried that just like you just said there aren't enough apps showing up. There aren't enough people building applications that users want to use. There's a lot of infrastructure getting built everywhere. But like you said, applications need to show up and attract users. Otherwise, what the hell are we doing here? So my thesis has been that we don't need more infrastructure, we need people to build killer apps. The pushback I've gotten, which I would assume you probably agree with, is like, hey, infrastructure has been built and there's a lot of it around, but there isn't the right infrastructure.
00:16:15.176 - 00:16:48.350, Speaker D: And so, to your point about incentivizing a certain type of activity on your network that's conducive to a certain type of app building, I guess. Here's my question for you. Bit of a long winning question, but bear with me. Back in the day, near did something very interesting, which is that they rewarded economic activity on their network by basically paying developers in near proportionate to the amount of smart contract activity that a given app would generate. And I thought that was really brilliant. That's like what the dollar does. You participate in the system, you get rewarded in dollars.
00:16:48.350 - 00:17:12.190, Speaker D: That's how petrodollar economies work, et cetera. They built this empire, this sharded, amazing technological empire with that premise, and nobody showed up to the party to build apps. Can you maybe touch on why it is that your liquidity based reward system, which is similar but actually very different as well, will reward a certain type of builder to show up and build what type of app?
00:17:12.490 - 00:17:59.802, Speaker A: Yeah, no, great question, man. I think that it bears resemblance. Some CSR type stuff we've seen, even the last cycle or two. I do think that, unfortunately, a lot of those metrics end up being gameable, which is why I think both the mid curve take and the correct take is that social consensus and capital consensus is actually what should drive incentive distribution. And I do think that that's very much what, what the bear chain system sort of enables. Right? And just to go to double click on that a little bit more, each validator effectively has a gauge, and they can choose how they would like to, you know, direct the emissions when they win a block, right? So they could say, hey, I've got a bunch of capital in this pool, as, like myself as a validator, I'm going to put all my emissions there. Or they could say, I'm going to put 20% on this pool, 20% on that pool, 20% on that one, and this options protocol, whatever it might be, right where I think that gets more interesting.
00:17:59.802 - 00:19:09.120, Speaker A: Is when you add or you explore the incentive marketplace that's built on top of it. This is probably what one would think of most conventionally in DeFi as bribes. So you can actually have an application go and say I'm going to give you as a validator, or I'm going to post a bribe, or an incentive that anyone can pick up and say in exchange for x amount of missions, I'll give you y amount of my token to be distributed amongst myself as a validator. I'll take some commission on it and my delegates who've chosen to actually provide to delegate BGT to me and give me voting power. And with that you actually cause I'd say a new layer of that market to emerge in which people can basically decide their own risk preferences and what they want to get more exposure to. Now that doesn't answer your core question, it just more answers the idea of what is it that actually makes this more interesting? Perhaps for a protocol in the first place, it's that they can decrease their cost of capital. Instead of just doing a classic pool to sort of liquidity mining type program where they're pairing a token against their own token and then emitting a whole bunch of their own token, they're actually able to actually effectively pay a small amount in their token and ideally based on an effective market, receive a number of emissions in the form of that chains token itself BGT, which one would hope is value accruing and useful over time.
00:19:09.120 - 00:20:01.756, Speaker A: But I also think the answer is, and this has been the biggest efficiency as I see it in most ecosystems, is this laissez faire attitude that if you build it, they will come? I think that's retarded. I think that if you build it, no one will give a shit. And I think that you have to go out there and aggressively tell people what solutions you have, why they need it, and why it's a good fit. And I think that we've seen so many people pontificate and build castles in the sky about things that have ultimately yielded very little to nothing. And maybe they do in the five to ten year time horizon, but I very much believe in power law distributions. And I think that if you go and hit up 100 different teams and ten of them are half decent, then again, out of those, maybe there's a chance that one of them turns into a unicorn app. So if you're not going out there and chatting with hundreds, if not thousands of builders, then the chance of finding the next milestone just Lodestone crazy app.
00:20:01.756 - 00:20:24.100, Speaker A: The next uniswap, the next GMX, whatever you want to call it, on your chain is near zero. I think my broad answer to that is I think that you can have all the right base plates from an incentive design or from a builder point of view, but if you don't go out there and do the work, then it's ultimately useless. Having the right design just sort of helps remove friction, as I see it, but by no means guarantees outcomes.
00:20:24.480 - 00:20:27.660, Speaker D: Wow, that's a. That's a fantastic answer.
00:20:28.080 - 00:21:00.936, Speaker C: I will say that you have. You guys have definitely figured out how to go out there, the community and the memes and, I mean, it's just. It's just absurd, honestly, what you've been able to, like the cult that you've been able to assemble, and I think that had to have been somewhat intentional to build what is effectively a meme coin cult around real product in a way that I haven't really seen since kind of since link. You guys remind me a lot of link, I'll be honest.
00:21:01.128 - 00:21:02.648, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. I love that.
00:21:02.824 - 00:21:24.780, Speaker C: Pretty, like deep, hardcore in terms of community at least. And then also, you know, backed up with some. Some. At least on the side of link, you know, some somewhat real tech. And I think that it's kind of interesting to see that combined because it's really. It's really hard to do that. It's hard to thread that needle to be both.
00:21:24.780 - 00:21:29.964, Speaker C: To be both a serious, you know, serious builders. But then have fun while you're doing it.
00:21:29.972 - 00:21:30.948, Speaker D: Yeah, it's like. It's whimsical.
00:21:30.964 - 00:21:32.692, Speaker C: I think a lot of people take themselves very seriously.
00:21:32.756 - 00:21:44.048, Speaker D: What's crazy about it is, like, you're okay, so let's take a tradfi lateral, right? If you were gonna start a hedge fund, you wouldn't name it like, pissant Capital, LLC. Everybody's afraid to wait.
00:21:44.064 - 00:21:45.420, Speaker C: Jonah, that's a great idea.
00:21:45.760 - 00:21:46.160, Speaker A: Yes.
00:21:46.200 - 00:22:08.712, Speaker D: Let's start this. Avi, let's go. Found it. The thing is, because that doesn't attract LLP. LLP because investors don't want to put their money in something with a name like that. And so what you get is just this, like, the opposite end of the spectrum. Everything is named like Bridgewater, Bridgestone, Stone Bridge, Citadel, castle, and it's all boring.
00:22:08.712 - 00:22:28.710, Speaker D: You kind of hit that middle of the gradient, which is perfect. Like, your background is like, jesus Christ is a bear with a bunch of bear apostles. It's friggin hilarious. Like, it's whimsical. But it doesn't sacrifice the sense of, like, you're safe on this chain. You know, it's you. You struck a very, very difficult balance.
00:22:28.710 - 00:22:29.810, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:22:29.970 - 00:22:34.470, Speaker C: Like, why bears make price go down.
00:22:34.890 - 00:22:55.090, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, we're. Bro. You know what? I. So I don't know if you guys saw, but for our April fools, like, gag this year, we, like, rebranded to bullet chain for a day, and we, like, dropped this video that showed, like, the running, the running of the bulls and stuff, and, like, how we were going to build a perpendicular evm l four to Cardano. And I think that's. That's exactly it.
00:22:55.090 - 00:23:29.758, Speaker A: Right. Which is to say that I also believe in. I don't know if you call it horseshoe theory or, you know, a barbell distribution, if you will, but I really do believe that the left and the right curve or even out at some point. And that to win, you need to be both highly retarded and highly competent, at least in a space like crypto, where the industry is so new, but it also very much caters to, like, a younger demographic as well. Right. While we are seeing the fidelities and, like, you know, the Franklin templetas and so on and so forth, like, starting to actually plow in here and get involved, in many cases, they're involved by. They're being advised or, you know, they're taking a good look from someone who is more likely closer to our ages.
00:23:29.758 - 00:24:10.206, Speaker A: Right. And I think you have to be able to appeal to that population, too. I think I also realized a while back that between, like, our founding team and, like, just the guys we have on board and what we've seen of the space over time, we. We weren't going to win by being fed chain. There's no world in which we, you know, try to come off as, I think, polished as sweet or, like, mister and or, like, you know, polygon, depending on whether they're making polygon jokes or not or whatever, right? And ended up in a position of power. I think we realized that we very much had to carve our own path and carve our own brand, right? And the bears, it just felt fitting because it's like, okay, this whole thing is going to evolve. That event, an NFT project of bear smoking weed, then we might as well just, like, run with it.
00:24:10.206 - 00:24:22.478, Speaker A: So we didn't even actually, we call them the bong bears. And then someone came into the discord being like, ooh, bonga beara. And then we're like, hey, that's pretty funny. And then we just kind of ran with it. And I think that's been a lot.
00:24:22.494 - 00:24:24.526, Speaker C: Of, like, this is a random guy. This is a random guy?
00:24:24.558 - 00:24:26.126, Speaker A: Yeah. Random motherfucker.
00:24:26.238 - 00:24:27.814, Speaker C: Is he a court team member now?
00:24:27.942 - 00:24:53.976, Speaker A: Bro, I think this man, like, dropped off the face of the earth, like, a couple of years ago, but, like, you know, his impact is felt and lasted. And I think for us, what we realized at some point is that leaning into that whimsical nature, if you will, and being able to execute while also being kind of silly was a space that had not really been fully explored or done right at the protocol level either. And it also just sort of felt like, correct for us.
00:24:54.168 - 00:25:21.622, Speaker D: To your point, the virality is so critical because you can't just build it and expect people to show up and build amazing apps. So here we go, Smokey. Get ready for the best transition ever. You built the bear chain during build a bear during the bear market of 2022. Tell us what that was like. Very few products launched or got conceived of and worked on back then. Most people were just busy throwing in the towel.
00:25:21.622 - 00:25:24.210, Speaker D: Was it like building in the bear?
00:25:25.830 - 00:25:26.830, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:25:26.950 - 00:25:28.966, Speaker C: There isn't really a thing.
00:25:29.158 - 00:26:04.790, Speaker A: There's a hell the amount of rope around the office. But I think that we managed to grind through it for the most part. I guess when I think about that, I probably attribute to a couple different things. One is that the community sentiment has always been pretty meaningful. I think that on our side, I think we've typically seen chains built by someone being like, okay, I've got a profit x or Y university, or someone out of X or Y research institution. I'm a spin this shit out, raise a bunch of capital, and try to make people care. I think we took a very opposite approach, which meant that we effectively had a bunch of people who kind of cared from the beginning.
00:26:04.790 - 00:27:04.258, Speaker A: And then as more and more stuff came together, they still kind of cared. And as we worked our way along and sort of iterated on the idea, we saw more people popping up and saying, hey, I want to build this. Hey, I want to build that. And I also think that having seen somebody just grows their business development relationships mature over the last couple of years, I think that period of trauma bonding was also kind of important. It's like when you get hazed in a frat, right? Like, you go through some shitty times together, but then you end up being closer over a longer period of time, right? So I think that with that, you know, building through the bear was a pain in the ass, but it wasn't the worst thing. I think that if we had a live product at the time, I probably would not have enjoyed it quite as much, because I'm sure it would have just been doom and gloom and people being like, when will devs fix price? Etcetera? Which I truly feel for all of our comrades who had to go through that. But I also think it provided massive turnaround opportunities or massive hero moments for some groups that we're big fans of.
00:27:04.258 - 00:28:03.640, Speaker A: I remember talking to the Pendle guys in late summer, early fall of 22, and at the time, they were figuring out end of v one, early v two, and what that was going to look like, and completely rebuilding their internal pricing models, and the market had absolutely destroyed them. They're like a four or five mill market cap. And I talked to them, and I'm just like, yo, these guys are cracked. And I'm pretty bullish on interest rate derivatives, so I feel like I should pay attention to this, and I wish I bought a bigger bag. But then I saw them, like, absolutely kill it for the next couple of years and kill the points meta, kill the LST, meta everything alongside it. So I guess I find that the whole building of the bear thing is just more of a barometer of, like, griftiness and or, like, mental fortitude, which is to say that if you're a grifter, decent chance you tap out there, and if you're mentally weak, decent chance you tap out there as well. I think that we are fortunate to not be in either of those scenarios, and it gave us a bunch of good time to go heads down and figure some shit out.
00:28:03.640 - 00:28:22.832, Speaker A: That being said, like, raising towards the end of that was a pain in the ass. We were, I remember we were closing up our series A, like a week before FTX blew up, and then FTX blew up as we were still, like, taking wires and stuff, and it was like, ah, this is, this is less fun than it was a couple weeks ago. So that was definitely an experience.
00:28:22.976 - 00:28:25.896, Speaker C: Wait, wait, was FTX committed to being an investor at that point?
00:28:25.928 - 00:28:34.860, Speaker A: No, no, no. Fuck that. We were not taking money from ftxpr. We had a conversation with some of the members on their team, and they were really unimpressive.
00:28:36.160 - 00:28:51.056, Speaker C: That's, that's really, that's really funny. I mean, I remember at that point, they were basically just throwing money at everything that they could, but then the way that, the way that they would do it is they would come up to you and they would say, we are the best thing that's ever happened to you. Take our money and give us the best terms ever.
00:28:51.248 - 00:28:57.420, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. We, we do not negotiate with terrorists. So it did not, you know, no such luck over here.
00:28:58.600 - 00:29:25.306, Speaker C: Yeah, that was a different time. That was good. It's good you guys persevered through. That was a, I mean, I don't think I've ever wanted to rope myself that hard after FTX. Like, I remember I was sitting there in, in the tradfi world and it's always, it's always both the best feeling and the worst feeling in the world when tradfi looks down at you with disdain and disgust. Because on one hand, you have to deal with all of them, but on the other hand, you know how good it's gonna feel when it starts going back up.
00:29:25.338 - 00:29:29.670, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. You know that. You know that comeback arc is gonna be crazy.
00:29:30.260 - 00:29:54.680, Speaker C: Yeah, it hits different. And everyone told you three months ago that it was going to die. Shit's alive. And also, I mean, what really hits different is when you try to explain to somebody that you invested in something called barachain. It's like return to you meaningful capital. And they look at you and they're like, I invested in Walgreens and it's down 25% today.
00:29:56.550 - 00:30:06.690, Speaker A: Dude. Anyone who invested, like, biotech during the 2021, like, COVID vaccine boom and whatnot. Oh my God. I had a lot of fundamentals. Homies being like, what the fuck are you doing in these, these Internet coins, sir?
00:30:07.230 - 00:30:16.730, Speaker C: Yeah. This is honestly, honestly hilarious, but I mean, somehow through all of this, you managed to get some tried by money. I think I saw the latest headline.
00:30:18.310 - 00:30:20.662, Speaker A: Yeah, it's Brevin Howard. Who's on the coin?
00:30:20.686 - 00:30:21.430, Speaker C: Howard? Yeah.
00:30:21.550 - 00:30:22.250, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:22.910 - 00:30:40.966, Speaker C: I mean, I know they have a crypto business, but they're pretty trad by. What is it like? What is it. What is it like sitting in front of somebody and trying to pitch them something serious while also needing them to understand that it's like, supposed to be a joke because that's good for it, right?
00:30:41.158 - 00:31:02.714, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, like, compliance definitely didn't get it too easily, but, like, you know, they figured it out at some point after a lot of. A lot of leg pulling. I think that the good thing is, you know, like, the partners at Brevin have become increasingly crypto native over time. You know, they picked the guys from the dragonfly liquid desk, et cetera, who were good friends and early investors of ours. So it made that transition a lot smoother.
00:31:02.714 - 00:31:38.060, Speaker A: And then I think there's also the fact, like, in a past life, like myself and papa and a lot of our team members, we were suits, right? We've had to be serious on an extreme occasion. It's something I really do try to avoid doing, but when necessary, you got to do what you got to do. And I think that we were capable of cleaning up. And more than that, I think just, like, allowing people to take a peek under the hood and get past first impressions. And I find that that really does tend to be an interesting cognitive dissonance activity for us. I think there were a lot of people who at some point, you know, wrote us off and were like, this is retarded. Like, what the fuck is Barachain, man? Like, you know, this can't be serious.
00:31:38.060 - 00:32:24.172, Speaker A: And, and, you know, just sort of formed a very strong opinion based on that. But then it's sort of the same thing as you mentioned earlier with the markets, right, when we actually chatted with them and they got a chance to, like, you know, look under the hood a little bit, like, oh, wait, maybe these guys are actually, like, you know, onto something here. And then that reversal of, like, you know, someone who's highly against you to extreme zealot tends to be a pretty powerful one if you pull it off properly. So I think that definitely also leans in our favor. But I think you're totally right, man. Like, there was a number of times, I remember around the time that we were finishing up that race, our series a, like, kanto was live, evmos was live, and everyone was, like, trying to compare us to that, and we were just like, okay, cool guys. Like, you know, not, you know, lots of respect for those teams in some cases, but I just think that that's inaccurate and we'll let the market decide.
00:32:24.172 - 00:32:29.280, Speaker A: And I think the market has made, made some noise since then, perhaps in one direction.
00:32:30.940 - 00:32:34.400, Speaker C: I think those two names I have not heard in a long time.
00:32:35.340 - 00:32:58.490, Speaker A: Yeah, right? I think a lot of them aren't too cool. Interesting ideas, just like. And I don't think by any means that we've found ourselves in a position of success yet. We still have so much to prove, and we can so fuck up so many different things. But I just think that, like, it was very easy for people to mid curve and also for institutions especially to be like, oh, but isn't it just this? It's like, no, not really.
00:32:58.650 - 00:33:44.384, Speaker D: Well, hang on. So on that note, what does success look like? I mean, obviously, there was a period of time during the post 2021 euphoria when every new l one was, it's like, all right, get a couple dexs on there. Something that looks like a club, something that looks like Uniswap v three, and a few, like, basic infrastructure plays. Maybe an l two, depending on the chain, blah, blah, blah. But I get the feeling that your chain, I think it has one of the highest throughputs TPS in the entire crypto space. It's capable of processing immense amounts of computation. Surely talk to us about your ecosystem and what success looks like and what types of apps you want to see just crushing it on your chain.
00:33:44.384 - 00:33:55.220, Speaker D: And I'm sure the answer isn't, oh, just like something that looks like Uniswap, but on Barachain or, oh, just another club, like, yeah, what is it? What does it look like?
00:33:55.380 - 00:34:16.700, Speaker A: For sure, man. So, you know, one thing is I always try to be super, you know, direct and honest about where we are, like, where we do win massively and where we don't. Right. I think that I'd love to see us and we have, you know, thoughts on how the few in the future we can be incredibly scalable. Right now, I think we see ourselves as like one of the fastest slash most efficient, if not the fastest slash most efficient l one designs. I do expect groups. Sorry, EVM compatible l one designs.
00:34:16.700 - 00:35:06.914, Speaker A: Cause like, you know, I'm sure that's a lot fast. And lessons we had mistin have their own timeframes as well. I think that what we have that's pretty interesting from a tech point of view really quickly, is that bare chain is actually the first completely EVM identical l one. I think you've heard a lot of people say EVM compatible, polygon, Avax, et cetera. And that means the vast majority of things are compatible, but it's still, in many cases, maintaining some degree of a guesswork. What baritune actually has is an identical execution environment to Mainnet in that you can run bear chain, run the eth environment using Nethermind Aragon ref, what have you any of these different execution clients? And for that, that means that we don't need a team of 20 researchers trying to figure out how to maintain a geth fork. It actually means that if there's an EIP or if there's something that actually goes into place on Mainnet or it's upstreamed, we can make that change very easily as well.
00:35:06.914 - 00:35:47.990, Speaker A: So that compatibility saves us a ton of trouble and also makes it super easy for people to build scaling solutions, roll ups, everything in between on bear chain, which we're actually already seeing prior to launch, which is pretty exciting for me. And then the other thing is that we use comet BFT consensus under the hood so that we still get that single slot finality. That's really nice. To have. And it's one of those things that's on the Ethereum roadmap definitely. I don't expect Ethereum to implement in the same manner as comet to effectively caveat that. But I think we really do end up with the best of both worlds in terms of a super evm identical environment where if you could deploy something on Mainnet, you could deploy it on bear chain without having to reinvent the wheel or do extra legwork which tends to be a point of friction and you get that single slot finality which is super nice for a transaction execution ordering point of view.
00:35:47.990 - 00:36:41.320, Speaker A: You more importantly though, like I think that success looks like Bear chain being the ecosystem where people go to see cool new things being built. And I don't know if I necessarily subscribe to the concept of an east killer. I think it's possible in some senses, but I don't necessarily know if that's like, I don't think that's the game I want to play. The game I'd much rather see us play is one where if you were looking to find the most interesting new applications that actually do have a shot of product market Fitzhen, they're coming to life on Bear chain from a cultural and liquidity point of view. And this sort of goes back to what I was talking about earlier in terms of shots on that portfolio construction, power laws, whatever you want to call it. The structure of bear chain is meant such that validators drive incentives and drive rewards towards the application layer. And I see that as effectively an enabling factor to give the most number of applications the best amount of shots on net and opportunities to reach escape velocity, to break out and actually get real adoption.
00:36:41.320 - 00:37:11.918, Speaker A: So you know what I would love to see is like those next groundbreaking apps end up defining the crypto space as a whole. Like living on bear chain and then find their home there before going multi chain, or fact that we haven't. That is their home based settlement layer, whatever you want to call it. And there are a ton. So I'll think about ones that come to mind off right off the top as cool ones to start. But like one of them that I've been yapping about a bunch recently and I bet you guys would probably think is cool as traders is called exponents. It's effectively a pretty new take on derivatives.
00:37:11.918 - 00:37:57.906, Speaker A: And that on one hand it's something that we've seen a little bit more recently in terms of allowing you to take leverage on long term asset or on long tail assets. So perks on shitcoins but the part that gets really cool, if you ask me, is that they've actually added a different incentive layer on top of that, in that it's not just long you're shorting, here's your funding rate, etcetera. They've actually added a separate incentive layer such that one can actually speculate on trading direction and say, hey, I'm going to bribe someone. Or incentivize longs, or incentivize shorts specifically. So you can actually have coins pvping each other in a more explicit manner than ever before, if you ask me. And that if you're like tremp versus bowdoin, for example, you can be bribing people to short one coin while longing another, which I think is very cool. Beyond just incentivizing LP, which has been the metagame to date, I think that's really cool.
00:37:57.906 - 00:38:26.900, Speaker A: I think it's something that relies on effectively the velocity of capital and something that turns into a pretty crazy yield sandwich. When you think about that in the bear chain environment, you could have a given pair there. They use sort of uniswap spot arbitrage style pricing. Both leverage to actually determine like the fees that are generated by the protocol. And then you add that bribe layer and long and shorting on top of it. And then you add proof of liquidity admissions on top of that. Like that in itself becomes a really cool set of applications for someone to build around.
00:38:26.900 - 00:39:05.490, Speaker A: You know, there's groups that are building, you know, funkier stuff in the consumer space. I was telling you guys a little bit prior to the call, there's one that I've been calling a vape to earn on Vericain, it's actually quit smoking to earn, but it's called puffpaw. It's super cool. And in a bunch of really sharp guys who've shipped 75 million vapes to some of the leading tobacco manufacturers, vape manufacturers in the world, and are partnered with some of the largest quit smoking applications in the world. And it's actually a custom made deep in vape that incentivizes you to decrease your nicotine usage over time. And you get more tokens for using less nicotine until you get down to, effectively a green tea extract. That one's an absolute truth.
00:39:06.550 - 00:39:15.010, Speaker C: That's actually really cool. I've heard of an application in crypto that actually helps people with their health. Everything else destroys your health.
00:39:15.430 - 00:39:42.158, Speaker A: I think it's really cool because my thesis on a lot of these, I think the tokens are incentivization tools. In many cases what they do is they actually take a behavior that people are already accustomed to doing and allow them to potentially financially. That's, that's broadly how I think about crypto gaming as well. In cases where it might work. Right. It's like if you could play Runescape versus playing Runescape, that's like 75% as good, but maybe you could make a few bucks. I feel like you play the second one as long as the quality like drop off isn't massive.
00:39:42.158 - 00:40:13.240, Speaker A: Right. So I think stuff like that is really cool. I'm all like, I've always been a defi guy, so I think that like, you know, I'm super excited about the defi ecosystem there. There's a group called Shogun that's incubated by us, as was puffpaw, the vape turn one. That's really exciting. And those guys are effectively building what's the best way of putting it? They're building a platform that allows you to trade any asset from any chain without any difficulty there. As in if you want to go from Saiyan on say, to bowdoin or DJT on Sol, they make that trade route possible.
00:40:13.240 - 00:40:56.120, Speaker A: And they have some very interesting just in time liquidity vaults that allow you to turn Mev effectively into trader extracted value and put that back in the hands of the user. So basically an intense layer intents solver system combined those just in time liquidity vaults that allows you to get the best execution possible without ever leaving your home network. I think that kind of stuff is really cool. There's zero day to expiry options with the guys from IVX. There's credit default swaps and distressed debt on chain from the guys at concrete finance. Dude, that's one of my favorite ones. More recently founders a prolific on chain Degen, but trained as a surgeon at Oxford, then was a vp for years at 72, then was absolutely in the trenches buying and selling JPEG tokens with me.
00:40:56.120 - 00:41:06.706, Speaker A: Little did I know. And has now built one of the most interesting on chain derivative systems I've seen. So all that kind of stuff is coming to the eco pretty sweet.
00:41:06.738 - 00:41:10.810, Speaker C: So you guys aren't on main net though right now, right? You just launched that. No.
00:41:10.930 - 00:41:11.630, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:12.570 - 00:41:31.108, Speaker C: So how did you get all these people to start building on? Just testing. Yeah, that's been, I think that's been very difficult in general for people to get any activity prior to mainnet launch. I mean, youre talking about all these projects. It seems like you have a lot of projects even though youre still on Tusken, right?
00:41:31.244 - 00:42:23.400, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. I think that for us man, it was seeing that if we actually took a very proactive approach to this, its very possible to get people to build, especially if they understand that, they understand that they really have an opportunity to do more with their applications on Vera chain than anywhere else. I think the fact is, proof of liquidity feels tangible. It feels like something where it's not just like, hey, we're going to give you this grant and please stay with us for a few months. It's, hey, there's a way that you guys can actually be effectively enshrined into the block creation, block rewards process on a chain. And I think that that is kind of special for applications in terms of a, just thinking about their own roadmaps and capital efficiency and b, I think tapping into the culture that's been built as well. I think there's a very collegial feel of camaraderie and we've gotten teams together in the past for dinners and events and token in Denver stuff and it's crazy to see them come together.
00:42:23.400 - 00:43:30.966, Speaker A: The other thing that we've done that I think helps supplement that is we also have sort of an incubator program that's run at arm's length from the foundation called build a bear. And that basically helps incubate work closely with five teams every six months that are just meant to be cool, new exciting things that are there to set a bar for quality in the ecosystem. And the goal there is really to help teams that go to market, help them figure out fundraising, all the stuff that actually is required to build a lasting company, figuring out their tokenomics and management structure and what it takes to scale an organizational internationally, how they have to figure out their taxes and like legals and all that kind of stuff and use that to like, you know, give those guys a leg up. So I think we've really, we really do view the foundation slash labs, whatever you want to call it, as an extension of the ecosystem and it's very much there to empower people. And I think that by combining that with, you know, proof liquidity as a fundamental with the culture that's being built of like, you know, fuck around, find out, but do it in a really effective way, you end up with, with a pretty magnetic group for builders. So I think that that's been our greatest edge, honestly. And also making sure that we don't like take our feet off the gas, right.
00:43:30.966 - 00:43:42.170, Speaker A: Like the team has been incredibly, incredibly competent when it comes to going out there and tongue builders, how they have an opportunity to win on ver chain and how we're there to help make that a reality.
00:43:42.470 - 00:44:37.510, Speaker D: Well, I mean, I love that you obviously need community. I experienced this the hard way where, you know, back when Solana was trading $20, I fudded Solana and the community just came out and took me out. And basically, I think that was an early sign that the token was going to eight x from there. Right. If you've got a strong community of people fighting to create valuable products and build things that people want, even in bear markets and fight back against FuD, you have something lasting. So if you're seeing that community inside of your ecosystem already, that's like a phenomenal sign, even if you haven't made it to mainnet. But one thing I heard you say that really I found inspiring, I think our listeners would appreciate, is that you talk about the gamification of activities that haven't been gamified yet, but should be like vaping, for example, or quitting smoking.
00:44:37.510 - 00:45:25.400, Speaker D: Also, x to earn, play to earn, or quit vaping to earn. It's obviously a massive use case for crypto, but I honestly think that one of the reasons why, with a few notable exceptions like Axie infinity, it hasn't really caught on in a sustainable way, is because in order for your earnings to, you're earning tokens, you're not earning greenbacks. In order for your earnings to be sustainable and for them to hold their value, there needs to be, like you said, liquidity. And so there hasn't really been a chain until now that's kind of guaranteeing pools of liquidity for all these different types of applications, or at least building it in at the l one level, the way that yours does. So I think that's super important in order to unlock that massive potential in crypto for x to earn applications to go live and scale.
00:45:26.100 - 00:45:59.242, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you, man. And we very much do see liquidity as a lifeblood of DeFi, and DeFi to be fundamental in crypto nowadays. I think everything you see, whether that's the fantasy top bonding curves or pump fund stuff for, like, everything is in some manner downstream of or tapping into a defi ecosystem. Right. I just think that some things are more obvious than others. And I think that, like, you know, a lot of people think, oh, can proof of liquidity only be useful for Defi apps? I don't think so, actually. I think it could actually play a role in a whole bunch of different things, because almost everything has some element of liquidity centricism.
00:45:59.242 - 00:47:13.468, Speaker A: Right? So I think that's also where I'm very excited in the long term, you know, we're starting to see plans right now that are at very early stages for proof liquidity being used outside of the baritone ecosystem, if you will, for extensions. I'll leave that one a little bit more amorphous. But I think we'll see those assets doing a lot more than just providing liquidity on barachain over time, which I think will be really exciting. I think we're seeing more like nfts, games, social apps, all the stuff that is an extension of the culture, if you will. And then these l two s, which present their own interesting world, because the bearish chain has its own brand, it has its own selection of life, if you will. But I think we're seeing highly competent groups from consumer gaming, media, et cetera, go and build l two s that are going to roll up to bear chain and sort of take advantage of and draw on that native community, but also help to onboard like tens of millions of new folks in a completely sort of like in a same, same, but different manner, if that makes sense, in that they'll very much be an extension or an arm of the brand, but they'll have their own ecosystem, their own lifestyle, their own culture that can go back and forth here. And I think that that's part of what also becomes very interesting about building this anonymously, and that we end up being a little bit amorphous in terms of what the identity of bear chain is.
00:47:13.468 - 00:47:58.484, Speaker A: On one hand, people could view it as a defi chain, other hand, people can view it as a meme chain. On the other hand, people can view it as an application acceleration layer. People can say, oh, it's something between EVM and cosmos. There's a hundred different ways to view it. And I think that where things get really interesting is by having a number of different extensions of that brand that allow it to tap into all the different demographics. Like, not, it's not us trying to boil the ocean, it's can we, in a b, two b, two c manner, find enough ways to spread the good word in enough places where it actually makes sense, such that everyone has a reason to care about bear chain? And I think that that's one thing that, going back to that Solana example, I think they've been doing a really good job of that at different points in their life cycle. And I think that it's exactly what you mentioned.
00:47:58.484 - 00:48:36.730, Speaker A: Having the community beat down or the ability for someone to get absolutely wrecked by a community is one of the most bullish things as possible. Saw that a ton back in the day with link and at some point ohm and stuff, and I think we're seeing that too. But that only comes when you have people who care about all these different aspects of it, whether it was like, you know, the magic Eden ecosystem and the fucking like, oh my God, I feel those robots are called, and then the tensorians and all that, or the deep end ecosystem there, or like pump fun and defi stuff. I think, I honestly do think that they're one of the best to have done it so far, and I have a lot of respect for what those guys have put together as well. From a yemenite, I'd say a longevity point of view, and also just a scope and performance point of view.
00:48:37.510 - 00:49:35.850, Speaker D: Interesting. Yeah, I couldn't agree with what you just said more. And in terms of what our listeners care about, people that listen to a trading podcast hosted by traders tend to want to know, where's the money? How am I going to make money off of this? Somehow, just in thinking about how to bridge the gap between your community and the trading community, one thing that just immediately pops into my mind is if you're building a liquidity focused l one, the money is where there's going to be liquidity for your tokens, for your earnings. And so I can kind of see, if I were to try and brand barachain, it would be the chain where you don't basically get rugged by disappearing pools. I don't know if you want to brand it that way, but because it like, because you can't validate without basically staking liquidity into the network, applications that touch Barachain are ultimately going to be more stable for people who earn tokens.
00:49:35.890 - 00:50:21.054, Speaker A: On those applications, I think that's part of it. And I think what I'd even sort of double click on even more is it's a chain that's built to provide the majority of its value that's being generated towards applications and users. Ultimately, it's validators to apps and apps to users in terms of that flow of incentives, if you will. I think there's a way that you could position it that's probably a little bit more bastardized, but in a sense, the chain rewards you to use it. The term that we've been playing around with internally is like this whole idea of have your steak and eat it too, and that the whole idea is on bear chain. You go and you lp in whatever you want, use whatever protocol you want. And if that protocol happens to be one of the ones that is whitelisted or that is receiving emissions from the protocol chain itself, then you're getting whatever rewards that you normally would get.
00:50:21.054 - 00:50:55.120, Speaker A: But you're also getting this additional upside in the governance token emissions token of the chain. And then you can choose to use that to compound in whatever manner you like. You can go stake that with a validator that is incentivizing the pool that you're already taking part in, and effectively use that to compound your own rewards. You can use that to stake with a validator that is effectively receiving incentives or bribes from another protocol that you want exposure to. That's like a long tail call option. Effectively. There's, I think, a lot of game theory and a lot of different choices that the user has, all without sacrificing the basic behavior that they'd want to take either way.
00:50:55.120 - 00:51:18.420, Speaker A: So I guess when I think about it, it's like you're getting to do what you want, or you're getting to pursue your average user behavior, ideally with a whole bunch of fun, cool new applications if you choose to use them. And you're just reaping the benefits of actually having exposure to a new ecosystem. So I don't think any system is truly perfect, but I do think that there's a lot more thought put into the incentive alignment across all parties here.
00:51:18.960 - 00:51:33.390, Speaker C: You know, that's actually really exciting, because this reminds me, this particular conversation, the last 50 minutes of us talking reminds me a lot of the conversations that I used to have in 2021 or 2020 when people were actually building new and innovative defi applications.
00:51:33.550 - 00:51:34.622, Speaker D: I feel like I haven't had a.
00:51:34.646 - 00:51:43.270, Speaker C: Conversation like this in a very long time. Everybody's so. Everybody's just so focused on, like, dogs with hats, which I love. I love a dog with a hat. Like, I love.
00:51:43.350 - 00:51:44.670, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. Good tech.
00:51:44.750 - 00:52:05.280, Speaker C: I love them. It's good tech, it's good tech, it's good community, it's good cult. However, sometimes, you know, it's nice to, you know, get. Get in the weeds of something, something new and innovative. And the other thing is, you know, not to, not. Not to talk bad about other projects. A lot of the latest projects that release airdrops, a lot of the l two s, they're sort of effectively the same.
00:52:05.280 - 00:52:06.680, Speaker C: They're all the same across the board.
00:52:06.720 - 00:52:07.096, Speaker A: Totally.
00:52:07.168 - 00:52:30.860, Speaker C: Right. It's just. Okay, yeah, maybe this uses a slightly different version of ZK tech, you know, but it's all basically the same. Yeah. And I think there's been. I think in the market, there's just been a lot of fatigue from this because people are really tired. And the reason that they keep chasing meme coins are, one, because of the returns, but two, because there aren't people working on or releasing interesting things.
00:52:30.860 - 00:53:03.334, Speaker C: And it's just very. It gets very repetitive over and over and over. So I think a lot of people in crypto, the way that I would phrase it, have gone back from being users. Like, I was a power user of crypto for two years, three years. I have. I probably have used crypto less in the last, you know, actually messed around on chain less in the last 18 months than I did in, like, one month in 2021 because, you know, there were just so many things to do back then. Right.
00:53:03.334 - 00:53:15.464, Speaker C: And there's just. It almost seems like there's less to do today, which, I mean, I think there is in terms of, you know, at least. At least what I'm. What I'm doing, what I'm doing day to day. So this is kind of. It's kind of fun to listen to. We're gonna have to.
00:53:15.464 - 00:53:19.016, Speaker C: Everybody should go check it out. Can we use the testnet? Is it public?
00:53:19.128 - 00:53:36.288, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, dude, 100% it's usable. It's pretty, pretty snappy. I enjoy it. And we're seeing a bunch of applications starting to go live on it. We basically moved over from our old testnet to a new one, like about two and a half, three weeks ago. And with that, we're gonna see a lot of the old guard redeploying. But there's already some pretty fun dapps on there to play around with.
00:53:36.288 - 00:54:09.296, Speaker A: So I think that's exactly it, Avi. It's like, I want, like, we want to make crypto fun, right? I think that if there's any brand or any community that probably has a good chance of making that happen from a vibe point of view and also from an application point of view, I think we've got a lot of shots on net over here. And I think that, like, what I care about is what I mentioned and what you just touched on, which is, like, net new things that you haven't seen somewhere else. And I think we've seen, like, a couple, like, flashes in the pan over the last, you know, six to twelve months. Months. But there's definitely been four or five times. I'm like, hey, that's something cool and new.
00:54:09.296 - 00:54:57.542, Speaker A: But I don't think it's as usual, by any means. And our goal is to keep a steady stream of interesting things on bear chain, because my high level thesis is that I think that most alt l one s or most chains that are not mainnet and maybe Solana, but I think mostly just not. Mainnet can really only sustain, like, ten to 15 if you're really optimistic, maybe 20 applications and actually get a bunch of use without a ton of liquidity, fragmentation, and lack of real usability. And I think that that's ideally some degree of, like, a rotating set, right? I think there's always a few that will remain in that. It's like fucking English Premier League teams or something, right? There's always a few that stay up at the top of that league, but there's a few that swap out, but there's, like, a very solid cohort that ends up being at the front of that cambrian explosion. And I want to make sure that Barachian always has, like, the coolest ones at the front of that pack. And there's some.
00:54:57.542 - 00:55:35.436, Speaker A: They're, like, really fucking fried, but there's some that are, like, just things that then could completely reinvent the way that we think about the industry, right? So on one hand, we have Bera tv, which is literally like, AI Bear reporters that will talk about shit and eventually is going to turn into, like, a maplestory megaphone kind of thing where you can use that for distribution of content and bidding over slots where you can actually talk to people and whatnot. And it's effectively a content slash distribution engine. Or you have, like, you know, gummy fi, which maybe you met those guys at one point. I'll be like, you know, allowing you to basically borrow slash lend against any asset, like an order book style under the hood of. With shared liquidity profiles as desired. So, like, you know what I mean? You get the duality. And I think that's.
00:55:35.436 - 00:55:42.840, Speaker A: That's really important. Like, you got to have your stuff that's just good fucking bant, and you got to have your stuff that's like future of finance. And sometimes they're one the same.
00:55:43.980 - 00:56:00.538, Speaker D: Like, I love it. I'm so on board with this, and I want to. I want to mess around on chain again just. Just talking to you about this. Like, Avi, when are we going to. When are we going to start tokenizing random people who are trying to quit smoking and, like, bribe them to fall off the wagon and play against each other?
00:56:00.634 - 00:56:04.190, Speaker A: You know, whole new level of the game, bro.
00:56:05.530 - 00:56:06.790, Speaker D: Avi, you're on mute.
00:56:08.130 - 00:56:10.750, Speaker C: Are you saying incentivizing people to relapse, Jonah?
00:56:11.370 - 00:56:14.546, Speaker D: Yeah, that is what I said, but now I feel bad for saying it.
00:56:14.618 - 00:56:21.190, Speaker C: No, I think it's. If you can go one way you can go the other way. We're all capitalists here.
00:56:21.810 - 00:56:36.176, Speaker A: My favorite was, like, we were trying to figure out a, like, you know what that flywheel looks like? We're like, okay, so there's vape to earn. There's, like, zin to win. But, like, do you. Do you eventually go back to, like, straight sigs? Like, how do you. How do you continue this loop? It's like, hmm, maybe we shouldn't continue this loop, dude.
00:56:36.208 - 00:56:39.220, Speaker C: Honestly, I've actually. Sinks are making a comeback.
00:56:39.760 - 00:56:42.100, Speaker A: I think sigs are Lindy now. I think.
00:56:42.400 - 00:56:50.146, Speaker C: I think people are getting tired of, you know, the. The blueberry ice vapes and, like, the strawberry raspberry sorbet, like, inhaling up.
00:56:50.328 - 00:57:00.810, Speaker D: I can verify that in the. In the commodities industry, there's, like, for every one gen z with, like, the banana ice vape, there's, like, three guys outside at any given time smoking them.
00:57:01.830 - 00:57:03.330, Speaker C: Really? Yeah.
00:57:04.350 - 00:57:05.530, Speaker A: That is edge.
00:57:06.470 - 00:57:12.246, Speaker C: Remember, return to tradition. Return to tradition. This is all about at the end of the day.
00:57:12.438 - 00:57:14.130, Speaker A: So remember, this is how we win.
00:57:16.070 - 00:57:19.588, Speaker C: The future of finance is good vibes. I like this. This is good.
00:57:19.764 - 00:57:21.052, Speaker A: I was talking, Tommy.
00:57:21.116 - 00:57:25.084, Speaker C: If I were to put the future of finance in anyone's hands, I'm happy to give him to you, Smokey.
00:57:25.252 - 00:57:27.800, Speaker A: You're. You're too kind of. You're too. Likewise.
00:57:28.420 - 00:57:33.460, Speaker D: You just gotta get the air conditioned bear suits for the future conference. Things get.
00:57:33.580 - 00:57:36.020, Speaker C: Look, I don't want any sweaty bears in charge of finance.
00:57:36.060 - 00:57:46.240, Speaker A: Yeah, no, no, it's. Honestly need the marshmallow style with the big fans. Like a light, nice, nice, large headset. All the good stuff. Real decked out bear suits. Putting. Putting the fundraiser to good use.
00:57:48.410 - 00:57:55.794, Speaker C: Amazing, dude. We appreciate, you know, we appreciate you coming on, Smokey. This is definitely one of the most fun podcasts we've done.
00:57:55.922 - 00:57:59.130, Speaker A: Definitely. Cheers, man. I'm always happy to entertain.
00:57:59.290 - 00:58:09.830, Speaker C: We'll have to have you back on once you guys launch mainnet. And then you can meticulously walk all of our listeners through exactly how to make money on bear chain. And if they lose any money on bear chain, you can guarantee their funds, right?
00:58:10.130 - 00:58:15.270, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, totally. That sounds exactly like some of my legal compliance department would love.
00:58:20.580 - 00:58:37.920, Speaker C: Nothing. Nothing on this podcast has been financial advice. Please don't listen to us about anything. We are literally interviewing a bear. None of us appreciate it, but, yeah. Well, we'll catch you soon, buddy. To our audience.
00:58:38.940 - 00:59:31.590, Speaker A: Yeah, man. I guess I just say, like, you know, would love to see you guys fucking around and testing out the barrier chain testnet and playing in the community a little bit and keeping an eye on things when we go live. I think the goal for us is to when we think about what we care about and achieving going live, it's on one hand helping to reach new users and making sure that lots of people have an opportunity to get involved in ver chain. On the other hand, if the chain is called proof of liquidity, there better be a bunch of liquidity on it. So making sure we bring a whole bunch of capital into the ecosystem and then doing right by all the application builders, community members, folks that have been riding with us for the past couple years. So I just say keep your eyes peeled and if there's an opportunity to get involved, please take it. And if you happen to be like a retail trader, investor, builder kind of guy or girl who wants to get involved and start messing around on the most fun chain there ever was, then please hit us up and we'd love to find a way to help seamless show, you know.
00:59:33.460 - 00:59:36.880, Speaker D: Thank you so much for talking to us, Smokey.
00:59:37.260 - 00:59:38.820, Speaker A: Thanks for having me, guys. Much appreciated.
