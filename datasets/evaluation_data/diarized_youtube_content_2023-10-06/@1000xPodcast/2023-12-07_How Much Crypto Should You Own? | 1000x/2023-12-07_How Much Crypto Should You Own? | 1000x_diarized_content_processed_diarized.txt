00:00:00.200 - 00:00:02.294, Speaker A: Jonah, you. You pissed off everyone again.
00:00:02.414 - 00:00:10.638, Speaker B: I did it. I did it again. I literally set everyone's hair on fire on Twitter.
00:00:10.766 - 00:00:12.414, Speaker A: Dude, dude, Ansem.
00:00:12.454 - 00:00:30.390, Speaker B: Ansem ratioed you so hard, everybody ratios me, man. I just. I put my thoughts out there. I'm like, hey, this is what I think. And people are like, fuck you. So, on the one hand, I'm, you know, I'm getting good engagement for the thousand X podcast. On the other hand, I'm like, jesus, people are ruthless out there, dude.
00:00:30.422 - 00:00:33.944, Speaker A: People. People just love to hate you.
00:00:34.764 - 00:00:39.780, Speaker B: This isn't a new thing, Avi. This precedes crypto. But, you know, they love to hate me, so they keep me around.
00:00:39.892 - 00:01:18.800, Speaker A: The more that I watch you interact on Twitter, as I've seen your account grow, it just gets better and better and better. All right, guys, welcome back to another episode of Thousand X. We are at 42k on bitcoin, which was everybody's price target a month ago. And so now that we're here, what do you do? Well, stay tuned. We will not be answering that question for you, because that is financial advice. But hopefully, by the end of the conversation, you'll know even less than what you knew at the beginning. So should we jump into it?
00:01:18.872 - 00:01:47.428, Speaker B: Yeah, let's jump into it. Here's what happened with my tweet. I was talking to some friends just from outside the crypto world. Yes, those people exist. And I was talking about how crypto is sending, and they're like, huh, isn't it dead? I thought crypto was, like, 2021, and then it just kind of ended. Like, what are you talking about? Like, the price of bitcoin just hit 40k. It's going bananas.
00:01:47.428 - 00:02:46.274, Speaker B: And, you know, do you own any crypto? No. And, you know, it sort of brought me back to this institutional kind of saying that a good percentage of your portfolio to hold in crypto is 2%. That's what, like, responsible financial advisors recommend to responsible clients who are looking to preserve wealth and take, like, a little bit of risk. But if you go out on the street, Avi, and you ask ten people, do you own any crypto? You know, I think you're going to get five to seven nos. So I was thinking, hey, let me just send out something like, if you're not uncomfortable, long five, kind of targeted at those no coiner people. If you're not starting to put a decent chunk of your portfolio into this, meaning, like, five to 10%, and you're just going to feel stupid again, like you probably did the last two bull cycles in crypto, but then I obviously posted that in the wrong place. I posted it on crypto Twitter.
00:02:46.404 - 00:02:56.350, Speaker A: Yeah, I was. I was gonna. I was gonna say like, that. That was. That was the main issue. Is your. Your audience just a bunch of degenerates? So, you know, when.
00:02:56.350 - 00:03:06.126, Speaker A: When you. When you post something like that, I mean, look, I think if I had 10% of my net worth in crypto, I would feel horrendous because I did.
00:03:06.150 - 00:03:14.154, Speaker B: At one point, and I felt horrendous, and then I dove into it full time and I still felt horrendous because then it fucking went to zero. But, like, it's. Yeah, it's. It's not enough.
00:03:15.334 - 00:03:33.274, Speaker A: If you really believe in this stuff. I mean, yeah, dude, have 80% of your net worth in crypto. Fine, rip it. I mean, I have had. I don't think at any point in my life I've ever had. Since I discovered crypto, I've had less than 50%. Except for in 2022.
00:03:33.274 - 00:03:48.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. I think that was basically it. And even then, I still had. When I say crypto exposure, I still had just a bunch of USDC at all moments in my life. I've had more than 50% of my net worth in crypto on, like, crypto rails.
00:03:48.472 - 00:03:49.444, Speaker B: That's interesting.
00:03:50.104 - 00:03:58.160, Speaker A: It just. It's like everything's so much easier. I mean, like, for example, I'm going to Miami this weekend. It's like, I needed. I needed to rent a. Rent a place. And guess.
00:03:58.160 - 00:04:18.444, Speaker A: Guess what? I paid for it in USDC. And the best part about it was the guy sent me a wallet with a linked ens. I won't dox it, but it had Shiba in it and apecoin. And I almost felt like I should reach out to this guy and be like, dude, let me help you buy some bus.
00:04:18.904 - 00:04:22.872, Speaker B: You know, subscribe on the thousand X podcast YouTube page.
00:04:22.928 - 00:04:28.792, Speaker A: Buy some Harry Potter Obama Sonic. You know, come on. Like, you're. You're in last year's. You're in last year's shit coins.
00:04:28.888 - 00:04:35.624, Speaker B: I saw a new one. It's. It's. It's spelled frosh, but it's. It's probably pronounced like frog froze.
00:04:35.664 - 00:04:55.604, Speaker A: Froze is accurate. Do they. Meme coins are. Meme coins are popping off. I mean, you have big time ripping already is such a good rip fest because it's the meme. It's like the bitcoin meme coin. And so many things are happening on bitcoin right now, and people are actually trying to build and bitcoin NFTs are popping off and meme coins on bitcoin are popping off.
00:04:55.604 - 00:05:27.756, Speaker A: I really do think that, you know, people thought that that move was priced in. I really don't think it's priced in. I think if you spend the next two weeks of your life looking at three different areas, I mean, we've covered AI a lot, and I'm still very bullish on AI, but I think you cover AI, you cover things that are happening on bitcoin, and then you just dive into NFTs on both Solana and Ethereum. You're going to have a really good time in the next six to six to twelve months because we're at the point of the cycle.
00:05:27.780 - 00:05:30.572, Speaker B: I think NFTs on Ethereum are going to. Are going to pop.
00:05:30.748 - 00:06:24.424, Speaker A: We're at the point of the cycle, Jonah, where bitcoin needs to fall apart for alts not to run. Like you need bitcoin at bitcoin at 35. The weeks after that, if bitcoin stabilizes, is actually when alts tend to run the hardest. So, yeah, you might get caught on a leverage drawdown, right? If you're over levered, if you're one of the djens who got really mad at your tweet because you were 300% levered, and then you get taken out on a 10% move, right, you eviscerate your portfolio. But if you just survive and you find the right areas to allocate to right now, I mean, this is the freest money you're going to see in a long time. Not financial advice, but this market dynamic. This is where you three x in two weeks, and then you look across the board.
00:06:24.424 - 00:06:50.818, Speaker A: Jonah, you've always been ridiculously bullish. I think I've been much more cautiously bullish than you. But inflows into ETP products are picking up. CME futures are still buying. Crypto native leverage is basically non existent. You have altcoins doing well, but not crazy well. So the froth, I wouldn't point at the market and say there's immense froth.
00:06:50.818 - 00:06:58.494, Speaker A: I'd say that there's like, you know, it's like a poorly done cappuccino. A little bit. A little bit of fraud.
00:06:58.614 - 00:07:16.654, Speaker B: I mean, look like I've been bullied. I've been ridiculously bullish, but I haven't been ridiculously bullish. The things that have gone parabolic, like, I wasn't ridiculously bullish, Solana, I wasn't ridiculously bullish. You know, stacks or the puzzy pudding. Hey, we were. We were post Anatoly, we got.
00:07:16.694 - 00:07:18.586, Speaker A: Post Anatoly we got super bullish.
00:07:18.710 - 00:07:45.146, Speaker B: Yeah, um, that is true. But, like, I wasn't bullish at, at eight or ten or 15 back then. I was like, man, Solana is just reeling right now. Like, is it even going to participate in this next upswing or is it going to be like, you know, Polkadot or near actually near just ripped. Everything's fucking ripping. But the point is, like, I was bullish, the slow stuff, and now I feel out of my element. Cause, like, my old trad five brain, like, I can understand bitcoin and ETH and now I can understand Solana because anatoly held my hand through it.
00:07:45.146 - 00:07:51.538, Speaker B: But I just can't get my head around some of these altcoins and believe in them enough to, like, you know, throw serious money at them.
00:07:51.586 - 00:08:04.746, Speaker A: You don't need to believe in them, Jonah. You just need to know that people are going to gamble on them. I mean, think about, think about this argument for, for AI, for example. Nobody knows how to value anything related to AI. Nobody. Like, nobody OpenAI valued at what, 80.
00:08:04.850 - 00:08:08.130, Speaker B: Billion, I mean, 90 before they lost their CEO.
00:08:08.202 - 00:08:46.934, Speaker A: The thing could have maybe. Nobody knows how that was actually going to make real money. At the, at the end of the day, they just believe that you have a technology powerful, strong enough, you have a dream big enough, and you'll make a ton of money. And crypto is the epitome of you have a dream big enough, you make money. So not only do you have real AI products and crypto, like a cosh network that are actually solving a problem, the upper bound is, I dare say it, unlimited. Right? Like, like the, like the. And then combine that with the fact that it's the only way for your average person to bet on AI.
00:08:47.714 - 00:08:50.234, Speaker B: I mean, there's Nvidia, but I guess that's priced to the moon.
00:08:50.314 - 00:08:52.354, Speaker A: Dude. How big is Nvidia?
00:08:52.514 - 00:09:00.050, Speaker B: I think it's a trillion, trillion one. It's huge. It's like a fourth or fifth biggest market cap thing.
00:09:00.202 - 00:09:15.430, Speaker A: I'm not talking about betting on AI derivatives. There are a lot of ways to bet on AI derivatives. But how do you bet on AI products? You can buy Microsoft, right? But that's, again, like a derivative. And it's.
00:09:15.462 - 00:09:20.366, Speaker B: You could be an accredited investor and invest in, like, a silicon Valley style startup fund.
00:09:20.430 - 00:09:38.754, Speaker A: What's. What's a pure play? I want to only invest in an AI product other than, like, cow, Akash, I mean, live peer. I mean, right? I mean, you have these things in crypto near maybe to some extent, although that's more of a derivative play.
00:09:39.814 - 00:10:10.972, Speaker B: But unlike the GameStop Reddit situation, and yes, GameStop is running again, and the Reddit crowd is back. Unlike that, these tokens are actually attached to projects that could, in theory, deliver value one day. It's not just a bunch of random dudes in their basements or their mom's basements deciding to squeeze some hedge fund out of a short like these, you know, these, these projects in crypto, like, they, they could have utility. I look, I think, wow, that was.
00:10:11.028 - 00:10:25.268, Speaker A: Such a good sign, in hindsight, for crypto, I'm looking at the GME chart. It ripped from twelve to 17, and then bitcoin broke up. I mean, I think. I think, you know, we were betting on bitcoin breaking up regardless, you know.
00:10:25.276 - 00:10:45.804, Speaker B: What I like about this rally, Avi, is that I. I feel kind of smart again. I don't feel stupid anymore. Um, I feel a bit vindicated. Like, I'm not, you know, obviously, you know, from the Internet that, that I'm not, like, I haven't just, like, five x'ed my net worth on this, so not much has changed. But at the same time, like, I feel. I feel vindicated.
00:10:45.804 - 00:10:57.204, Speaker B: And I think a lot of people do. And I think that, you know, you can see in the responses to this tweet that everybody pissed off. Like, that pissed everybody off. Like, suddenly everyone's got their, their sort of their confidence back. They got their swagger back.
00:10:57.244 - 00:10:57.572, Speaker A: It is.
00:10:57.628 - 00:11:19.134, Speaker B: We're not just like this ragtag group of people that get made fun of by our friends and relatives anymore. Like this. This shit is sending, and it shows no signs of slowing down because we still haven't de bottlenecked the institutions who ultimately will be more interested at these prices than they would if we were just sort of, like, festering sideways on the lows or near the lows.
00:11:20.474 - 00:11:46.706, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, that, to me, makes me want to sell. But, you know, I get it, because the moment you start to feel like, okay, I was right, it's working. It's easy. But, I mean, I think the, you know, the sort of memeing aside, it's a little hard to fight the flows at this point. I mean, I don't know. I think, like, gun in my head, I don't know where bitcoin is going to go.
00:11:46.706 - 00:12:28.332, Speaker A: It could range between 38 and 42. It could sell off down to 35. It could go to 48. I'm just not, I'm not in the habit of selling bitcoin during parabola during during parabolic advances, until you get a crazy move, like, you get a nuts move. And then what you do is you just barbell it into alts. So then you hold some cash to buy stuff for the inevitable drawdown, and then you rotate to stuff that just hasn't really moved aggressively. I'm waiting patiently, but I have started buying the most hated coin in crypto, which is Ethereum.
00:12:28.332 - 00:12:30.104, Speaker A: People really hate it.
00:12:31.044 - 00:12:32.972, Speaker B: I can tell. I love it.
00:12:33.028 - 00:13:20.192, Speaker A: But, you know, I I do think that the, the mentality and the narrative around Ethereum right now is just so, so, so downtrodden. I mean, ETH maxis are just, they're just nowhere to be found. Everybody's rotated to Solano, or you're buying bitcoin just across the board. Everybody's focus has shifted off of ETH. But it will seem obvious in hindsight when once the bitcoin ETF comes out, once bitcoin's priced in, maybe we trade 44 before the ETF, and that's the price in. And then this starts to happen. People are just going to talk about the ETH ETF that's next, and it's so.
00:13:20.192 - 00:13:26.044, Speaker A: And by the way, if the ETH ETF allows for you to stake ETH, it becomes like this insane product.
00:13:26.784 - 00:13:27.400, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:27.512 - 00:13:52.198, Speaker A: Right. Where it's just, it's, it's. It's an ETF that gives you upside to crypto that you're getting yield on. Dude, this thing is going to go parabolic. And I, for some reason, people aren't talking about, and I'm probably early. That's why I'm happy to. I'll be buying over the next two weeks, three weeks, maybe month could go sooner, depending on price action.
00:13:52.198 - 00:14:25.522, Speaker A: But at some point, that narrative shifts. I think that some point is at some point in the next six weeks, that narrative shifts, and then ETH is at three k before you blink. And everybody that you know was trashing ETH was on Team BTC, that was on Team Solana, is gonna flip over. And by the way, I hold no ill will to people that flip like that. I flip like that, right? But you, you buy, you buy it. You buy a position, you get. You're like, ah, you know, a lot of these people are, like, meming around, right? They don't.
00:14:25.522 - 00:14:53.884, Speaker A: You know, a lot of these people don't actually believe it anyway. And. But in order, one thing that I've seen is, like, in order, in order to. To hold a position for a two x to three x, you sort of need to convince yourself that you do like it long term. Like, a lot of Solana bulls that I know, like, they would look me in the eye two months ago and they would say, solana is the best thing that has ever been built ever. I can't imagine owning another l one. I can't imagine ETH ever doing well again.
00:14:53.884 - 00:15:10.224, Speaker A: Solana's and then Solana, three x's. And the good. The good ones are looking at me and they're going to. I don't know, really not that much on Solana guys. And I appreciate it. Right? Because in order to hold for that three X, you got to convince yourself.
00:15:10.884 - 00:15:36.596, Speaker B: Yeah, you do. And, I mean, Solana is one of those coins that you can actually believe in. And even on the lows, however, I don't know. I built my tradfi career by trading around my position. It's not black or white. You don't have to be all in or flat or short, right? Like, you. You could love something and it could rip, and you don't really see why it ripped so much, and then you don't.
00:15:36.596 - 00:15:38.780, Speaker B: You're like, ah, should I sell? Should I not sell?
00:15:38.892 - 00:15:39.236, Speaker A: It's not.
00:15:39.260 - 00:16:08.064, Speaker B: It shouldn't be a debate. Like, you can peel off 10% of your position or 15% of your position and take a little bit of profit, and if it keeps going, you're still long, and if it goes back down, then you just buy it right back, you know? Like, it's. It's a good way to generate some returns around things that. That go up and down. Apparently, crypto Twitter now thinks that crypto can only go up. But the memories of the collapse are still fresh for a lot of us. So if you're undecided about your position, you can always just tailor the size of it.
00:16:08.064 - 00:16:37.550, Speaker B: There's no shame in that. You don't have to. If you're out, you can tweet again. You can tweet like, I'm 150% all in and beat your chest all you want, but you could quietly do some smart stuff, sell a little high, buy a little back low, and keep going. Now, I wouldn't be selling big bitcoin or ETH right now. Uh, you know, Solana, I'm mulling, peeling a little bit off my position because I just, like you said, you know, it. This is a narrative driven rally.
00:16:37.550 - 00:17:04.074, Speaker B: It fucking eight x from the lows, and there's still not a ton going on. I believe in the promise of it, but I'm debating, like, whether this is the right price to. To remain as long as I am so, you know, maybe, maybe time to take a little bit of profit and trade these things around. Like you said, if people rotate into ethics, then maybe Solana will come off a bit. I don't know. Don't kill me, Solana fans. Like, ultimately, though, when you evaluate the reward, you also have to think about the risk.
00:17:04.074 - 00:17:37.731, Speaker B: Like the risk. If you're thinking, if you're going for a two xer on something and you're looking at Ethan Solana, Solana in the sixties and ETH around 2000, your risk with Solana is way fucking higher, right? There's no doubt about that. In the short run, it's just a more volatile token. Like, there are metrics of realized volatility. And Solana, I haven't run it today or recently on Solana, but Solana involves just through the roof. ETH is a lot more stable, so your risk is lower if you go into ETH at this point. I agree with what you're saying.
00:17:37.731 - 00:17:54.104, Speaker B: Also, I think that some of the ways that you know that people are emboldened right now besides just reading crypto Twitter, NFT prices like pudgy penguins fucking ten x. This is what people do when they start to feel like they have a little bit of extra cash and they're ready to gamble.
00:17:55.004 - 00:18:37.034, Speaker A: I agree with you. And nfts are kind of interesting because the. Okay, so just some numbers. The ETH market cap is about nine times, or I think eight and a half times bigger than the Solana fully diluted value. But the ETH NFT market cap is about 20 x as large as Solana NFT market cap. And I think that the crossover between the people that are likely to pour a lot of money into NFTs and Solana is much higher than the people that are likely to buy a bunch of NFTs and own ETH, other than the whales that I think are going to rotate some of their profits into ETH NFT, I think a lot of the new money that's coming in. So Solana nfts.
00:18:37.034 - 00:18:44.234, Speaker A: Just to recap, what was I bullish on? I was bullish on AI. Now bullish on Solana nfts.
00:18:44.694 - 00:18:48.314, Speaker B: Which ones? The chads, the seagull, the mad lads.
00:18:51.144 - 00:18:54.816, Speaker A: You know, I think that for a.
00:18:54.840 - 00:18:56.560, Speaker B: Trade or for like a long term.
00:18:56.632 - 00:18:57.632, Speaker A: No, for like the next six to.
00:18:57.648 - 00:18:59.856, Speaker B: Twelve months, cycle bags, you just hold them.
00:18:59.880 - 00:19:29.556, Speaker A: And then when things are like, when you wake up and the first thing you do is you refresh your portfolio and it's up 20% and it's the 8th day in a row that it's up 20% and you're dreaming of buying a private island. That's when I. That's when you sell. That's like that. That. That's my mentality for this market right now is that this is. This rally is so powerful, very strong.
00:19:29.556 - 00:20:20.694, Speaker A: Reminds me a lot of 2020, 2021. It just pattern matches kind of nicely that the way that this ends is in a bang, you know? And then what probably ends up happening is it probably looks a little bit like 2021, where it's. It's more of a rounded top than a complete blow off and then collapse. Because I think that the reason that you don't get those complete blow offs anymore in a market like this is just because there are too many larger institutional guys that do move a little bit more slowly than there were in 2017. So that's when you get the more rounded tops. Like in 2021, where you blow off, you come down, but then you come back up a bit and then sort of meander sideways. So I think it took, you know, it basically, basically took a full month to top.
00:20:20.694 - 00:20:24.150, Speaker A: In 2021, I think you'll see something. You'll see something similar here.
00:20:24.262 - 00:20:34.926, Speaker B: I disagree. I kind of disagree. I think that. I think that you would. There's obviously a lot of buying going on right now. People are emboldened. You can't fight the flows.
00:20:34.926 - 00:21:22.932, Speaker B: That's what we always say on this podcast. But right now, there aren't a lot of sellers. And I think the music is going to stop when the institutions finally have this gateway via the ETF. I think the ETF is going to bring in a ton of capital. I think it's all going to go parabolic very quickly. When that happens, in the absence of a major use case that's bringing in tens or hundreds of millions of actual end users to use products that are built on top of crypto, I don't think you're going to have this steady buying going on. I think what you're going to see is another casino style speculative frenzy like we've seen without any fundamental kind of sustenance to it, any follow through.
00:21:22.932 - 00:21:54.572, Speaker B: So I think it's going to go parabolic, and then I think at some point, the price is going to be quite high, the music's going to stop, and then I think it's going to collapse back down, kind of like spring 2021 style, until it finds buyers again. I think in order for you to level. I'm almost done. Sorry, I'm just rambling. But I think for you to level off at fresh highs. You need a use case. And right now, the only use case that major use case that crypto is serving is this speculative mechanism.
00:21:54.572 - 00:21:55.700, Speaker B: Except bitcoin.
00:21:55.852 - 00:22:23.408, Speaker A: I think. I think we're talking past each other. I'm not saying that it's going to level off. There's definitely going to be a crash. The question is how quickly does it, does it all fall apart? You know, in 2021, it fell apart in like a week. Okay, like, bitcoin was down 70%, like a week and like, literally, right, it hit twenty k and then it completely collapsed. I just think that it's going to be less violent, mostly because I think the run ups less violent and the type of participant is less violent, you know, less.
00:22:23.408 - 00:22:46.668, Speaker A: Less emotional, still very emotional. I do think that there's going to be a tremendous amount of allocation post, post ETF, given the way that this market has traded and a lot of people are going to, you know, one thing that's kind of interesting about the ETF is it's going to make, it's going to open capital flows for bitcoin because of the ability to borrow again.
00:22:46.756 - 00:22:52.892, Speaker B: You know, in your brokerage portfolio, margining for institutions. It'll get cheaper to buy bitcoin.
00:22:52.948 - 00:23:45.426, Speaker A: It's going to get so much cheaper to buy bitcoin. I mean, right now, like, one of the, one of the ways that people are buying bitcoin and why microstrategy always rips and why. So here's actually an interesting thought, is that the microstrategy premium to BTC, once that really converges, then you start to. Then we're going to start to level off because sailor is incentivized to keep ramming as much capital into the market as possible by selling these super overpriced converts and buying, and buying BTC. And that trade gets a lot worse for him once the premium comes in. And so, like, basically, as long as that premium remains high, you can just go out there and sell. You can, you can sell expensive and buy and buy cheap.
00:23:45.426 - 00:23:49.840, Speaker A: And he's just going to keep doing that day, day after day. Yeah.
00:23:49.992 - 00:23:51.924, Speaker B: Another wheel, that basis trade.
00:23:52.264 - 00:23:54.840, Speaker A: Yeah, until, I mean, but it's just for sale.
00:23:54.992 - 00:24:27.174, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I get it. I mean, look, like, I think the big narrative shift between this budding bull cycle and the previous budding bull cycle, like, you know, the fiscal and monetary situations are about to become more accommodative again, that's kind of the same in 2020 and 2023 24. Right. So that hasn't changed. What's really changed is that unlike the previous cycle. The infrastructure layer is really robust now, like distributed computing, decentralized trust. Like, it's a really.
00:24:27.174 - 00:25:04.158, Speaker B: It's like a robust, well built product this time. Whereas in the past it had the prospect of being a robust, well built product, but people were still paying like $300 in gas to buy an NFT. Right now there's block space available. Like, the infrastructure works, Solana's worked through its kinks, Bitcoin's established itself, and we're sort of like, we're there. The infrastructure works this time now. Like, I think we really, you know, I think bitcoin's going above 100k in the next three years. But I think in order for us to get there, it's not just going to be an ETF.
00:25:04.158 - 00:25:40.778, Speaker B: Like, an ETF is not a use case. You need somebody to use this infrastructure in a really brilliant way that just sucks in tons of tons of people, tens of millions or hundreds of millions of people, without realizing they're using it. Is it decentralized compute for these AI engines that are. I've chat GPT on my screen all day asking it questions like that. Compute's not free. Is it going to be decentralized compute? Is it going to be helium, Hivemapper? Any of the stuff we talked to Tolly about, all it's going to take is one of these things and then crypto is going to, I think, be very sustainable at a higher price. I just, I want to maintain sobriety around this ETF.
00:25:40.778 - 00:25:49.498, Speaker B: I think it's, it's not a sell all of your bags on the news thing, but it's like, take some profit on the news when it, when the institutions can come in. That's what I think.
00:25:49.626 - 00:25:57.866, Speaker A: Yeah, but do you, do you think. Okay, so here's the thing. Ever. Everybody thinks that, do they?
00:25:57.970 - 00:26:03.594, Speaker B: Are you kidding me? I don't know. I pissed off like a million people on Twitter by, you know, but I.
00:26:03.754 - 00:26:41.864, Speaker A: Think the whole world thinks that the, you know, sell the news. Okay, for the ETF. So the question is, my, my gut feeling around this is that it either rips for like a month like you, it either rips for two weeks to a month after, and then falls apart completely once people are convinced of the new paradigm, or it takes people out before. Right? So we top in the next two weeks and then the ETF gets approved on the 11th, but by then it's too late. Momentum is shifted. I don't know. I put probability of both at 50 50.
00:26:41.864 - 00:26:56.008, Speaker A: I put probability that it tops on the day of the ETF. Okay. I'd say my probability distribution is like 40% it dies early, 40% it rips after 20% it dies. Dies on the day. To make that a more useful, concrete.
00:26:56.056 - 00:26:56.644, Speaker B: Thing.
00:26:59.744 - 00:27:32.014, Speaker A: I would basically just be chipping away at exposure as things get out of hand in the next one to two weeks. And then I think what kicks off the crazy rally, Jonah, is a really, really, really good first day inflow into the ETF. If you get that, then you can make the case that there's going to be a lot of inflows coming. And I think that really high inflows on day one actually is probably reasonably indicative of how. How it's going to go over the next week or so.
00:27:32.634 - 00:27:37.330, Speaker B: What about lackluster inflows? Like, let's say it turns out, like the eats futures ETF, then.
00:27:37.362 - 00:27:40.374, Speaker A: Then it just falls apart, in my opinion.
00:27:40.874 - 00:27:45.454, Speaker B: Fucking impossible timing. Like, I don't know, I feel like I'm going to have to.
00:27:46.954 - 00:28:03.454, Speaker A: Well, I know. I know one thing. We are. We are all going to be staring at the screens very intently on the, you know, on the second week of January. I think January 5 to January 10 is when you're supposed to be stuck in front of your screen and you're just staring at it, waiting for it, waiting for that headline to hit.
00:28:04.154 - 00:28:16.690, Speaker B: And between now and then, to heck with Christmas Hanukkah, just pick that low hanging fruit in these rotation trades, just pay attention on crypto Twitter and rotate into stuff that hasn't quite popped yet. But will.
00:28:16.802 - 00:28:49.384, Speaker A: I mean, STX is. STX has been so annoying because we've held that for a while. And I'm actually. I'm very bullish on STX, just as a concept. They have their Nakamoto upgrade coming in Q one, which is going to make it the entire layer very fast. And they're going to open up SBTC. So synthetic BTC that will derive security from the main bitcoin chain.
00:28:49.384 - 00:29:19.764, Speaker A: That's. You're going to be able to mint hundreds of millions of dollars worth of that. Exchanges are, you know, signed up to go, go work with. Go work with STX on this. And I think that it's just a great derivative play on BTC, but it had just gone sideways for so long, people are finally starting to wake up to it. I think Hal put out a nice thesis on this if you want to go read it. It's on his Twitter page.
00:29:19.764 - 00:29:25.804, Speaker A: But I'm pretty bullish on just general BTC beta. Still.
00:29:26.224 - 00:29:51.138, Speaker B: Speaking of BTC beta, Roon went bananas, went from one to seven roon is this weird binary thing where it's either worthless or just parabolically rallying when the rest of crypto is parabolically rallying. Like it went to eleven in 2022 when bitcoin briefly breached forty k, and then it just like, gapped down to basically zero when it went below.
00:29:51.226 - 00:30:09.258, Speaker A: So, yeah, runes, a weird one. The. The claim is that they're the fifth largest BTC exchange. I believe it. They do. They do swap a lot. They have a reasonable amount of TF, TVL, and I mean, the product.
00:30:09.258 - 00:30:34.836, Speaker A: The product actually works now. Yeah, now, you know, but they got, they obviously got. They obviously got attacked a bunch. And I think it just has a very scammy reputation that, that surrounds it. But those tend to be the coins that run the hardest are the things that have some semblance of real product around them, but are still viewed as very scammy. Because what that. What that creates is it creates a.
00:30:34.836 - 00:31:07.794, Speaker A: It creates a cult of behavior around that particular coin. And though it creates very strong hands, and what it does is at a certain point, everybody's sort of avoided it because they thought it was scammy. And now that it's proven itself to at least work on some level, people start rushing in, rushing. Rushing through the gates, and it becomes a frenzy as opposed to a slow buildup. So, I mean, runes, honestly, I don't know much about it. I feel like we could. We could pick it or pick.
00:31:07.794 - 00:31:16.254, Speaker A: Pick a few. Pick a few coins for the next. The next podcast and just deep dive on them. You know, we can host a segment that's scam or no scam.
00:31:16.594 - 00:31:50.184, Speaker B: So I love that. Just like lightning round scam or no scam near. So basically, why don't we talk about how much crypto should you own at these levels? Like, should we. Should we try to think through for different types of people and different lifestyles what a good crypto holding would be? You said you rarely own less than 50% unless crypto is on its knees. I own significantly less than 50%.
00:31:52.324 - 00:31:52.636, Speaker A: When.
00:31:52.660 - 00:32:12.864, Speaker B: Crypto was getting smoked. Call it end of 2022, early 2023. Obviously. Now my holdings have rallied quite a lot, but, like. And I bought more, but we're weirdos, right? Like, we're not like normal people. So let's say that you're just a. Let's say that you're a no coiner.
00:32:12.864 - 00:32:31.376, Speaker B: Let's say that you completely don't get it. You think it's all just a big casino, and unlike us, we're like, yes, exactly. It's a casino. Casinos are valuable. Like, let's say that you kind of find stigma in it. Do you think that the average person on the street should hold a portion of their life savings on crypt, in crypto, even if they don't believe.
00:32:31.560 - 00:32:33.296, Speaker A: 100%. 100%.
00:32:33.360 - 00:32:36.004, Speaker B: You think it's part of a well rounded portfolio?
00:32:36.384 - 00:32:38.120, Speaker A: Well, at the end, yeah, I mean.
00:32:38.232 - 00:32:40.344, Speaker B: I do, obviously, but curious about you.
00:32:40.504 - 00:33:27.954, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's just different. Right. Because at the end of the day, the way that I view it is I don't, I don't view it as some people make the argument, hey, you want to hold an uncorrelated asset. You want to hold an asset, and the diversification helps you, it helps grow your portfolio. You can reallocate during times of stress in one asset from an asset that's doing well, assuming that the asset that's in stress is undervalued, and the rebalancing will work itself out, and you just end up with better result over time. Some people try to make that argument for bitcoin. The way that I think about it is this is a genuinely undervalued asset class that you look at everything, everything in crypto, and I think on a five to ten year horizon, it's just undervalued.
00:33:27.954 - 00:33:41.904, Speaker A: And so I don't think I can actually make a strong or significant argument from a overall portfolio construction standpoint, why you should hold it. I just think you should hold it because I think it's a, it's a good investment.
00:33:42.884 - 00:34:29.024, Speaker B: I can make a portfolio construction argument. And so I think the minimum amount of crypto that every single person in, you know, in the world should hold, with the exception of the baby boomers and older. And I'm not talking about crypto boomers, I'm talking about like, the baby boomer generation, because they're retiring and they're not like, trying to build wealth at this point. They're more trying to take stuff out, spend it, give it to their children. I think that if you're younger than that generation, you should hold a minimum of five to 10% of your portfolio in crypto. Not investment advice, just this. And here's why I think so, no matter how discomforting that is for you, I think the reason why is that bitcoin, the benchmark crypto asset, is a proven debasement hedge.
00:34:29.024 - 00:35:27.640, Speaker B: And I see nothing but debasement in the future of g ten economies. So I think that every portfolio deserves a hedge against that. Furthermore, I think that it is important for everybody to have some exposure to emerging technology. And unfortunately, the venture capital asset class isn't really tradable or accessible to most people. And I think that crypto is kind of, you know, if you were to do your research and pick decent coins like you could, you could thousand x some stuff, but even if you just buy a broader basket of things and dip your toes in on coinbase and own a lot of different tokens in small size, you're gaining exposure to distributed computing technology as an asset class that you wouldn't otherwise have in your portfolio. Basically, if you buy the S and P 500, you're holding a few mega cap stocks, and then you're holding a bunch of stuff that basically doesn't rally, like old industrials.
00:35:27.752 - 00:35:58.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so. The second part of your argument is sort of what I was trying to, trying to articulate, which is why I don't think it's a portfolio construction argument. It's just this is a good asset class to invest in because we both think it's undervalued. The first part is, I think, correct. And that is a good argument from a portfolio construction standpoint, that you will likely own other things in your portfolio that will be affected by debasement. And if you have bitcoin, then you very likely outperform. But again, that's still a bit of a market call.
00:35:58.654 - 00:36:53.484, Speaker A: And that's what I'm trying to articulate is that's a lot of what it comes down to at the end of the day is some of it is, it's a market call in a way that I think the market call is as defendable, if not more defendable, than the idea that the US economy will grow over the next 20 years, and that will be reflected in stock market valuations, and that company valuations relative to inflation will go up over time with certainty over the next ten to 15 years. And that is what current portfolio construction basically bases entirely around. That. That's an underlying assumption that we are going to grow as a country and our economy is going to grow relative to inflation. If that's not true, then basically it all falls apart.
00:36:54.104 - 00:37:16.164, Speaker B: It all falls apart, except maybe if it falls apart, because g ten economies have overspent their GDP growth, they've mortgaged ten or 20 or 50 years worth of growth to do the sort of profligate spending that went on during COVID and shortly thereafter, then I think bitcoin will protect you and stocks might not. Right. So that's why.
00:37:17.144 - 00:37:39.530, Speaker A: That's the part that I agree with. I think that you can make an argument from that perspective, and you can make an argument that today it is not only a possible outcome, but it is becoming a likely outcome, that bitcoin will do well in the face of the actions that the g ten economies will have to take over the next ten to 15 years. Yeah.
00:37:39.562 - 00:38:06.272, Speaker B: Because the people who have taken these steps, and I'm not going to go on too much of a rant here. They're the baby boomers, they're the octogenarians who run our economies. They don't care. They're going to hand it off the baton pretty soon. So they can, they can go nuts and party right now and the rest of us are left holding the bag. So I think it is important to have a debasement hedge in there. And I think that debasement hedge is linked to the rest of this, all these other tokens like we talked about, all this other emerging technology.
00:38:06.272 - 00:38:35.094, Speaker B: So I think there will be a buoy effect. I really do. But ultimately, on the other side of that spectrum, if you're a working parent and you've got two young kids and you're working a government job and you're in debt and you have a mortgage and you're 100 and 5200 percent long crypto, if you include your debt equally, I think that's pretty bananas. People need to tone it down.
00:38:35.434 - 00:39:23.362, Speaker A: I think time horizon is super important here. It also scales with relative. It's funny, like with everything in life, it's an iq meme, but with net worth meme, it's like, right? If you have a ton of money, then it makes sense to, I think, allocate a little bit more to crypto, especially if you allocate 20%, you'll lose that 20%. But your day to day life won't be impacted greatly. I think that's if you have zero money, pick your moment to, pick your, pick your time. But a lot of people go 100% long because they don't have that much money, because they have, you know, a job that doesn't pay much and they don't have much in their bank account and they view it as a lottery ticket. Like maybe, maybe if I invest in this thing, I'll make 510 grand and that'll change my whole life.
00:39:23.362 - 00:40:00.968, Speaker A: Right. And that's, that's a huge mentality of, of why, of why people get into us. And then sort of the mid, the mid curve is, you know, you make a hunt, you make, you know, 80 to year, you put 1% into crypto, right? I mean, that's sort of the types, I think of people. I mean, I would also advocate that if you have a long enough time horizon, so if you can invest over a five year period and that money will not impact you to put into crypto, then I would, you know, basically max out that allocation based on what you think you can live on.
00:40:01.096 - 00:40:02.176, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:40:02.360 - 00:40:05.136, Speaker A: I could agree. That's really. That's really the way that I think about it.
00:40:05.160 - 00:40:35.474, Speaker B: And the key word that you use there, Avi, is investing. I know some people, some good friends of mine, during the 2017 ICO boom, made a ton of money trading in and out of stuff on Poloniex and random shitcoin exchanges, and then they kept going and bled out. It's important to keep a steady hand in this stuff, and just because you do well during one of these crazy bull markets doesn't make you a genius. So you shouldn't over trade and piss away dough once you've made it, you should try to protect some of it.
00:40:36.614 - 00:41:11.174, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with you. I agree with you wholeheartedly. I mean, what's kind of interesting is going to be people. People talked about this a lot at the top of the last bull, so I hesitated to bring it up. But you even see it reflected in what people spend their money on today. And one thing that always interests me is because you have such a large class of people now. I mean, hundreds of thousands of people have made a lot of money on crypto, and they all spend it in really interesting ways.
00:41:11.174 - 00:41:38.674, Speaker A: Like, I. You know, one. One thing that's. One thing that's kind of interesting is that, you know, luxury spending obviously went way up alongside crypto. And I think those. Those two things are 90% just because the overall market went up. But I know a lot of people that buy crypto tend to spend their money on things like Miami real estate, fancy supercars.
00:41:38.674 - 00:42:06.682, Speaker A: There's a lot of consumption that comes out of crypto. In a world where, let's say, bitcoin hits one hundred k, I actually think that impacts the real world economy a ton like that. That actually, like, it actually directs money flows because that's hundred. That's like. That's like hundreds of billions of dollars that are going to be basically whisked out of thin air.
00:42:06.778 - 00:42:29.398, Speaker B: It would. It would shift the power dynamics of society. Like, people would be, you know, the. Like people. It's just human nature. When. When your buddy who used to have not that much money is suddenly, you know, 50 times richer than you and splashing out, you know, there can be some jealousy, some animosity some, you know, and I think, I think it might impact voting.
00:42:29.398 - 00:42:51.270, Speaker B: It might impact, you know, local politics. There's a lot of, lot of passion and fervor around crypto, both positive and negative. I think if bitcoin went to 100k, it would be pretty insane to see how society changes. Any predictions? It wouldn't just be like, oh, the Lambo dealership sold out. I think other stuff would happen. Secondary and tertiary effects.
00:42:51.342 - 00:42:57.966, Speaker A: I do, I do think one positive externality is that you probably get a lot of wild ideas funded.
00:42:58.110 - 00:42:58.766, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:58.910 - 00:43:26.776, Speaker A: So, you know, you, you probably have a lot of money going into long longevity tech. You probably have a lot of, just a lot more money put into, like small angels will put, put in, put in more money to sort to tech moonshots. I do, I do think you'll see, you'll see a lot more of that in a world where crypto grants people all the money. I think onlyfans is probably like the best investment you could possibly make in that scenario.
00:43:26.920 - 00:43:30.648, Speaker B: Yeah, that's kind of a crypto adjacent platform, isn't it?
00:43:30.776 - 00:43:33.080, Speaker A: I just think it's going to be really funny to see how that plays out.
00:43:33.232 - 00:44:41.494, Speaker B: Me too. I mean, I think one of the crazy things that would happen if crypto just sent and people had all this money, I see crypto as this community of misfits, true believers, craziest, and also people who are just like extremely pragmatic and practical about ways that this peer to peer value transfer technology can improve their lives in the developing world and the developed world. And I think that if crypto goes up, it will, like crypto. Is this group trying to make crypto happen? Right. You have all these people busting their fucking asses through every bear and bull just to build products that, that people want to use as a solution. And it hasn't really, except for bitcoin, it hasn't really found its killer app quite yet, aside from maybe nfts. But I think that the richer the crypto community becomes, the more empowered and able they will become to enact their cryptographic visions of the economy of the future.
00:44:41.494 - 00:44:50.792, Speaker B: Real world assets. Take real world assets, for example, like a, an NFT deed to your house or a, you know, a token.
00:44:50.848 - 00:44:55.024, Speaker A: Actually, all of that. All of that becomes way more likely the richer crypto people get.
00:44:55.064 - 00:44:59.904, Speaker B: Yeah, because they'll all be out there like spending on lobbying and just like, like making crypto.
00:44:59.984 - 00:45:13.862, Speaker A: Or they'll just go, or they'll just go to their pride. Like they'll, you make, you make a hundred million dollars you go to your private bank or a JP and you go, I don't want to buy your nonsense through a brokerage, like, sell it to me and sell it to me in token form.
00:45:13.998 - 00:45:48.248, Speaker B: I feel like the crypto community will be more empowered to make crypto fulfill its promise, which is replace this entrenched, shitty technology. That's software, as Anatoly said, is eating the world. And this is the financial software that suddenly it started to ruffle feathers. And that's why there's regulatory blowback and all these other problems that it's facing as it tries to eat stuff. And I think that the richer crypto people become, the more they'll be empowered to help crypto eat financial software and economies.
00:45:48.336 - 00:45:58.964, Speaker A: It's a good argument for RWAs is that they're going to be forced into existence by crypto people anyway. Jonah, how has crypto changed your life?
00:46:00.224 - 00:46:00.824, Speaker B: I was.
00:46:00.904 - 00:46:06.064, Speaker A: Besides making you, you know, unhappier because of your lack of sleep, moving your family around three times?
00:46:06.524 - 00:46:30.752, Speaker B: No, I've been. I've been moving around long before crypto. I think. I think crypto is fascinating because it was my best pa. Solana, ironically, was my best PA trade. Not this time in 2021 when it really ripped. That was, that was the first time I'd ever, like, done a, a proper job in my pa of anything.
00:46:30.752 - 00:46:51.384, Speaker B: So it gave me some self confidence. But also I turned down 100 million XRP when ripple Labs offered it to me in 2013. And that would have been worth $320,000,000.04 years later. Could have started a trading company off of that. Yeah. So basically.
00:46:51.384 - 00:47:17.494, Speaker B: And that was just their opening offer. Like, I probably could have haggled it higher. The guys who took it, they started GSR. They ended up getting seeded with 150 million. I worked for the r when we were both at Goldman and GSR. Yeah, basically crypto. I bought a bunch of bitcoin in 2013, paying $700 and then sold it all at dollar 400.
00:47:17.494 - 00:47:40.694, Speaker B: It's made me a better trader just from stumbling and failing and then succeeding and missing things. It's made me a better business person and a better trader. And it's also introduced me to some phenomenal people like you, because it is a community of traders that cares. Again, in oil, there are a few traders that care, but in crypto there are a lot of traders that care. And that's exciting. It's a better community.
00:47:41.914 - 00:47:50.710, Speaker A: It is a phenomenal community and I'm very happy to be a part of it. Likewise, as always, it's awesome chatting with you.
00:47:50.822 - 00:47:58.294, Speaker B: Yeah, great, great. Talking again. Again. None of this is financial advice or more just spitballing. But, you know, thank you for joining.
00:47:58.414 - 00:48:08.214, Speaker A: Please, please do not take this as financial advice ever. We're both idiots. We have no idea what we're doing. We consistently lose money and we just do this podcast to pay our bills.
00:48:08.334 - 00:48:12.634, Speaker B: Fun. If only it paid any bills. Yeah.
00:48:13.174 - 00:48:15.004, Speaker A: Do you get paid for this? Because I don't get paid for that.
00:48:15.054 - 00:48:21.032, Speaker B: Maybe blockworks is keeping it all they are. We don't have any sponsors though. Maybe that's why we're not getting paid.
00:48:21.088 - 00:48:29.840, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. It's a good point. Well, if you want to sponsor the podcast, don't reach out to us because I don't think.
00:48:29.992 - 00:48:31.640, Speaker B: Yeah, we're anonymous.
00:48:31.752 - 00:48:34.404, Speaker A: Talk to block work, I guess. Let them manage that.
00:48:36.304 - 00:48:39.024, Speaker B: All right, good times, everybody. See you in two weeks. Adios.
