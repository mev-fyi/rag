00:00:00.250 - 00:00:18.720, Speaker A: And for this new panel, we have GM from Dragonfly as the moderator, and we have Brandon from AI Arena, IDA from Curio, david from Blockworks, and Majo from Matrix as the panelists. So it's time to hear more about gaming. Let's give a warm welcome to them.
00:00:35.140 - 00:00:43.680, Speaker B: Six people, right? What are we missing? Treasure dove?
00:00:47.160 - 00:01:20.042, Speaker C: Let's just wait for a second. All right, cool. Let's get started. So thanks, everyone. This is the second gaming panel, and we have this great opportunity to have with us a couple of really talented builders, really building, kind of defining the next generation of web3 games. So before you get started, very brief self intro. My name is GM.
00:01:20.042 - 00:01:31.060, Speaker C: I'm a partner at Dragonfly Dragonfly. We are a global crypto venture fund. And I would like to go around the table and ask everyone to introduce who you are and what you're building.
00:01:32.070 - 00:01:32.818, Speaker D: Hi, everyone.
00:01:32.904 - 00:01:53.900, Speaker B: My name is EJA. I'm one of the co founders for Curio Research. We are a on chain game company, hybrid game and infrastructure company pioneering the space of on chain games. So hopefully we'll get a lot of questions there. Yeah, our first commercial game will come live early next year. It's a social diplomacy strategy game.
00:02:01.510 - 00:02:15.240, Speaker E: Hello. Hi, everyone. My name is Brandon. I'm the CEO and CTO of AI Arena. We're making a PvP platform fighting game where the core loop is actually to train an AI to fight on behalf of you.
00:02:17.450 - 00:02:55.620, Speaker F: Hello, everyone. This is Madeira, co founder of our Matrix, and we are striving to deliver a trilogy game, or Martin's episode games with Unified Worldview Story essentially focused on hundreds of years of a war between centralized data Cartil and decentralized resident chips. And we want to use this kind of a trilogy game to prove the transferability and interoperability of Mt technologies at the same time. Meantime, we will encourage the creator economy based on the community governance and to share the revenue stream with the content co creators. Thank you.
00:02:56.470 - 00:03:22.550, Speaker D: Hi, everyone. I'm David Johansson. I'm co founder and CEO of Medaking Studios. We're working on a game called Block Lords. Block Lords is a medieval MMO grant strategy game designed essentially around creating a medieval life for any user. You start off as a farmer, you gather resources, you grow in power, you build armies, you attack each other. At the top of the funnel, you have lords.
00:03:22.550 - 00:03:36.480, Speaker D: The lords collect taxes from players who farm on their lands and go to war against each other. And then it's all tied around the Dynasty system where heroes actually die, and you need to get married and have children to keep your legacy going.
00:03:37.810 - 00:04:04.010, Speaker C: So before we kick start with the conversation, I'd like to really kind of hear, how would you define the term web3 gaming, like, in your own opinion? Because I feel like it's oftentimes very overloaded term, especially for Yija. We've heard there's a lot of discussions for fully on chain games. So I would also for you to take the chance to make the case for fully on chain games which I believe might be how you would define web3 games.
00:04:04.990 - 00:04:58.746, Speaker B: Sure, yeah, I think generally my take is that there are different levels in which a game can use web3 and crypto, I think the lowest or using in the least sense would be having assets on chain, which is the majority of crypto games that we've seen. I think one level above that you can have some part of the logic on chain. A lot of games have some of part of their logic on chain whereas the quest system or some other peripheral system is off chain. And then one level above that you can have all of the logic that is using the blockchain as the server. So all the logic and state happens on chain. And I can talk briefly about the benefits. So the benefits that we recognize are two.
00:04:58.746 - 00:05:55.630, Speaker B: The first one is really the security and trust for players, right? So if you have a game world that contains a lot of value, let's say players have staked in tens of thousands or millions of dollars worth of asset. If you have a game mechanism where PvP happens, or even PvE happens, I would argue where the probability actually can affect the end result, then having logic on chain is a great way to convince players to participate. Right, so that's the first I can elaborate and then the second big use case that we've discovered, or observed and discovered is the ability to use smart contracts to express social relations and interactions in especially MMO type of worlds. And yeah, I'll elaborate on those later, but those are the two things that we're most bullish in when it comes to fully on chain logic on chain games.
00:05:56.770 - 00:06:20.440, Speaker E: So I think that's the pinnacle of web3 gaming, we don't do it to that extent. Our main focus is on using web3 as a structure for aligning incentives better, specifically on distributing rewards globally on a larger scale as well as value accrual in certain assets, which I can talk about how we do later.
00:06:22.650 - 00:08:01.938, Speaker F: To us, creator economy is the most essential part and also the community governance because in order for a game to be sustainable and for the next ten to 20 years, we should not depend only on the developers themselves, but also on the efforts of the community. So we have to try all of our best efforts to incentivize the creator economy. Of course, the web two gaming community and developers talked a lot about the creator economy too, but lacks of such tool undesigned to really develop our creator economy. So blockchain as well alongside with the crypto economy I think is one of the best incentives really to incentivize the creative economy so that from the very beginning you could use kind of a centralized way in order to lay down the very groundwork, the framework for the whole community system. And later on you could just make the whole system, little by little, more decentralized and ultimately to hand over all of the governance and decision making of the new contents, including the new maps, dungeons and avatars and gameplays and also worldview stories. You could hand over those decision making rights back to the gamers, to the creators, to the community. And in order to achieve these, you could just create this kind of ecosystem involving all of the community members to try to make all of these Afloats.
00:08:01.938 - 00:08:26.240, Speaker F: And this is a failed game. And I think maybe in five to ten years, maybe we should not still talk about the web3 game because this is the future of the game. So we should not differentiate anymore between web two games and web3 games because all of the games should have these kind of features. Thank you.
00:08:27.730 - 00:09:12.650, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with a lot of what's been said. I think definitely there are some obvious reasons to like web Three. One is asset ownership. Your wallet, your assets, you control them, you can sell them, you can transfer them, you can burn them. Whatever you want to do, you can do it as long as it's on chain. And then definitely, as much as we like to hide it, the access to liquidity is important. It is important that you as a player, your experience, your assets, your tokens, whatever you do inside of game, if that asset has access to a liquidity pool or to a market of some sort, that is going to create an additional layer of incentives for users.
00:09:12.650 - 00:10:08.240, Speaker D: That said, while we do think those two parts are extremely important, we also think that the actual protocol or the back end or the solution that you're building the web Three elements of your game on are not that important for most users. Most gamers just want to play a game. They want to be entertained, they want to stay in the game and become part of the community as long as possible. So as we were building our infrastructure, our portal, as we call it, we wanted to make sure that users could play the game as frictionless as possible, and then when they were ready, they could then mint their assets on the chain of their choice. So currently we support immutable, we support Polygon, but the idea is to not lock in the user into one specific protocol. It's really to give them access to wherever they want to go, wherever there are users, wherever there are liquidity. The game is just a tool to get their asset where they want it.
00:10:09.490 - 00:10:40.200, Speaker C: So I've had a couple of conversations and I realized there are a lot of folks, obviously, who's kind of on the fence on observing web3 gaming and would love to hear all of you guys'story, what drew you into web3 gaming and is there a particular moment? Is there a particular game that really clicked for you and solidified your conviction? Here's what I want to build. Is there any stories I believe the audience would love to share? Hear the stories for each one of you.
00:10:41.850 - 00:11:15.470, Speaker D: I can start. I got into crypto in 2017 as a retail investor. I bought some bitcoin, fell in love with it, got some ethereum, started understanding smart contracts. When I got into, I knew I was already a game developer, so I knew gaming and crypto would be the perfect match. Gamers love managing their resources, finding the optimal yield. I came from strategy games as well, so just this idea of okay, tokenized assets and gamers made perfect sense. So for me, when it clicked was really when Dnft was invented.
00:11:15.470 - 00:11:21.640, Speaker D: I played CryptoKitties, made some cats, and I was like, okay, I'm going all in. And I started my studio a few months later.
00:11:24.170 - 00:12:17.682, Speaker F: Thank you. Yeah. I also entered into this sector since 2017, and especially when listening to your speech of industry. OG, very famous in Shanghai in January 2017 and also participating several very high profile ICO got very good financial return. But I think cryptocurrency really opens the way for us to realize that there's not just the financial speculation in this sector, but also you could just create some kind of an open end economy like CryptoKitties and crypto hats, especially in that. When we look through the success of CryptoKitties, you will see another company called crypto hats to create those hats for those kitties. And this really forms a very complete ecosystem.
00:12:17.682 - 00:13:12.422, Speaker F: And this is just the first try. The second try is of course, the rise, the stellar rise of the Axon Infinity One. Our strategic investor, our seed run investor, Hannah, just told me to draft a strategy for them to be fully invested in metaverse. And I said at that time, two years ago, to invest heavily in IPS and arbitrary technologies. However, we found that gaming was very important in monetizing these heavy assets and also producing recurring cash flows. But if you want to dive into, deeply into the web two gaming economy, we will find it very difficult for a startup to succeed. However, we found that web3 investors or web3 traders users are extremely high net worth individuals compared to those web two users.
00:13:12.422 - 00:15:11.034, Speaker F: So for gaming studio, even though you don't believe ultimately in decentralization, there are a lot of people in this industry, we have to admit that they don't believe in the ultimate decentralization. But still it is a better market, much better market compared to web two markets to start in terms of a startup studio, so much higher chance to succeed. And that's why we choose to start from the web3 gaming industry, especially in that we really want to promote the very native industry values such as data integrity, decentralization and privacy protection. However, not through those kind of words and mouths propaganda, but from the distribution of our gamings and accountants and movies, et cetera in this way we think it's much more likely to promote this kind of industry native of value and content to the people in the worldwide. And also I think the most exciting moment for me in this sector is in January 2022, one extremely high network archer, high net worth individual asking me for the progress of the blockchain industry because he remains always skeptical since years about the progress of this industry because he only believed in those killer apps. When I told him about the latest progress of Steppen, he becomes so excited about that and three days later he told me that he thought there is really high chance that this industry could succeed. And also last summer when I had the chance to dinner together with Vitalika Butter in the Chinese restaurants in Mountain View, we asked him what exactly could blockchain do other than just facilitating financial transactions and financial speculation.
00:15:11.034 - 00:15:21.700, Speaker F: And he said at first moment he did not know, he did not have any idea. But he added that the next thing could probably be gaming. Thank you.
00:15:24.870 - 00:16:08.446, Speaker E: For me it wasn't necessarily looking at another game, it was just understanding what NFTs were that really made it click. Bit of background, I used to be a quant. I used to lead machine learning at a fund and when I really dug into NFTs, I realized they're just these digital containers for anything that's unique and has value. And it kind of clicked. I was like oh, the thing that I make that's unique and has value is these machine learning models. So let me try and tokenize AI. And I thought an excellent use case because on my spare time I used to build machine learning algorithms for games was to basically create a game for AIS to compete against each other.
00:16:08.446 - 00:16:42.620, Speaker E: And it had to be PvP because I think I mentioned before, web3 is great for creating these things for value accrual, right? And if you want to prove the value of this thing, this machine learning algorithm versus another one, let's have them compete against each other and you can see which one's the better one, you know what I mean? So that's kind of how it started. And games have the added benefit of abstracting away complexity. So if we wanted a lot of people to use this, we needed a way for not everyone to kind of be intimidated by a lot of the machine learning like lingo and stuff like that.
00:16:45.090 - 00:17:25.770, Speaker B: So in April 2022, I left my previous company where I was leading the tech back end and I was pretty lost honestly about life. And I went to a Buddhist monastery for a week and learned my like wrote my first lines with solidity and read proof of stake papers and there was not one moment there's several moments. So first was seeing things like Axi get a lot of usage and hype back in July 2022. And then it was Dark Forest. Dark Forest was a huge one. So I believe the Round Six started in September. October.
00:17:25.770 - 00:18:29.710, Speaker B: There was a huge amount of plugins compared to the actual active players of Dark Force. So Dark Force was like the first fully on chain game MMORTS, where players basically conquered planets and hold an empire. And the game is super interesting, right? Nobody thought that Ethereum or EVM can support such a complex game. It's not that complex, but still a fairly complex game and that many people will contribute code and plugins to it. This ratio is the highest I've seen, even compared to some of the mod heavy games in traditional games. Now, there were also issues, right? There were so many people that were talking about Dark Force, but the daily active players were never exceeding a thousand, if I believe correctly. And lots of people were just saying, god, I can't play this game even though I want to, right? The command line interface, the non intuitive, just like game rules, a lot of the UX issues.
00:18:29.710 - 00:19:28.500, Speaker B: And then also actually if you dig deep into the plugins, the game plugins, most of them are on the front end level, they're on the client level. And if you think about it, that's not really unique to Web Three, right? Like if a Web Two game, there are plenty of good Web Two games that are open source. I can't remember there's like the game that's anyways, that are open source and players can write plugins on the front end. The real interesting thing should be allowing players to change or build to extend the rules on the contract side. But very few people were doing that. So me and my co founders start asking why, right? Or how can we improve Web Three on chain games so that it makes it easier for people to extend the game logic in interesting ways that enhance players experience. And how do we actually lower the barrier for more people to come in, right? I think a lot of people think of onchain games as like a very niche thing, right? We have those questions and we thought we are pretty good engineers, so let's give it a try.
00:19:28.500 - 00:19:43.190, Speaker B: Everything I talked about, 22, it's actually 2021 starting in January 2022. We started to build demos of onchain games and then full games afterwards.
00:19:44.330 - 00:20:54.480, Speaker C: It does sound like a lot of us got really inspired by Axie Stephan a lot of the prior the games that launched earlier. And I feel like also chatting with a lot of audiences back in the day when there's market euphoria, right? People always cheered and almost everyone thought, hey, Web Three, gaming is the future of gaming. But I do think right now in this environment, people are starting to question themselves and having second guesses. So I do want to for every panelist to share kind of and kind of make the case for yourself what kind of crypto primitives you're using in your game that you're uniquely leveraging that crypto primitive to give and provide a user experience that's truly unique to crypto that otherwise you wouldn't have achieved that if you were to build your game on a web two stack. So I think that would help the audience better understand truly the value of what we're all trying to build here.
00:20:56.370 - 00:21:59.694, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll go. For us, it's really the Hero Dynasty system in Block Lords, every hero is an NFT, can be minted as an NFT. That hero will have their own stats, it'll have its own look. They're all AA 3D models, fully animated, they all have a family banner which is like their family symbol. They're really beautiful pieces of artwork and because they have a limited lifespan, it becomes very important that you get married inside the Ganmen, have children, right? So this dynasty building element is really enhanced by Web Three because you do have games like Crusader Kings and a few more strategy games where your heroes do die, but it's very easy to recreate a save or to kind of take that character, put them into another game. But with the Web Three element, what we have is really the memory of your hero still solidified in the NFT. So even when your hero die, you do have the dead NFT that's going to be usable inside of the game.
00:21:59.694 - 00:22:18.600, Speaker D: You're going to be able to stake it inside of the game. And our goal is actually in five to ten years is you're going to be able to take all your dead NFTs from the Block Lords universe and actually use them to play a new game where the dead heroes are all revived. So that's definitely one of our elements. We call it hero perma death. That makes our game pretty unique in the Web Three front.
00:22:21.530 - 00:23:53.270, Speaker F: Well in our gaming ecosystem. And NFT are one of the essential parts in that all of the NFTs, especially those Genesis Avatars and all of the weapon skins, they could be carried forward and backwards across the three axis of our game, sharing the same word V stories because users gamers would like to really to play across those games and maybe more likely in the future, some partners, some content providers could just ask us to distribute the content for them and we would ask them to also to share their gameplay with our NFT holders too. So that is to prove the transferability and interoperability of the NFT and also in order to activate our creator economy system and especially this community governance in the decision making process of the new contents. Our governance token system is also essential part in deciding which kind of a map, which kind of a dungeon and what ends, what outcomes of our heroes graph could become in the future. And that is totally in the hands. The decision making is totally in the hands of the community members, but not in the hands of developers. Personally, I love a lot the Marvel movie series.
00:23:53.270 - 00:24:06.700, Speaker F: I don't like the end that the Iron Man is already dead. So I think for a thousand times that if this is really in the hands of the community, iron man should never be dead. Thank you.
00:24:09.150 - 00:24:43.620, Speaker E: So I think the biggest thing is allowing gamers to monetize in a very different way. I've mentioned a lot of times this value accrual in the NFT concept. But really what we're doing is so we're using machine learning so that the NFT acquires the skills of the user. And you can do some really cool stuff like that. For one, is it's a competitive game. So if it truly is really good at competing, the gamer can actually monetize by selling this thing because it battles autonomously. But you can do a lot of other stuff too.
00:24:43.620 - 00:25:14.750, Speaker E: You can actually license out the ability to use it as a training partner. The analogies, like, imagine LeBron James was able to get a bunch of robots, teach it how to play ball, and then he can send those out to various people that they can use to then coach and get better at playing basketball. So by basically allowing us to capture their skill set on chain and this thing can act autonomously. They can monetize in a lot of really cool ways that they couldn't in Web two because the financial rails are awful.
00:25:16.290 - 00:26:06.538, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm going to elaborate on the two points I mentioned earlier, which are the two biggest reasons why I think players will be attracted to onchain games. Specifically, the first is high stake competition. So I believe onchain games provide the best type of arena for players who are looking to compete with other players fairly and verifiably with a lot of stake. If you, let's say, play StarCraft or if you play Dota today in real life, you either kind of compete, you kind of start a pool with friends and compete there like under the shadow, or you participate in esports and compete for millions of dollars. There's really nothing in between. And really game companies, it kind of hurts for both gamers and game companies because companies don't benefit from the takeaway from the players competition.
00:26:06.538 - 00:26:59.234, Speaker B: And obviously players derive much less fun from playing these games. Think of fun playing poker without money, for example. Right? And I think on chain games is a way to bootstrap new types of games that are suitable to these high stake competition environment and genre, right? Like we won't be limited to just poker and Majang and Wolf game and these very limited genre of games. We can have games that actually feel like games, RTS, FPS, whatever you name it, in a very fair and highly competitive environment with a lot of stake. So that's something that on chain. And why does it have to be logic on chain? Because logic on chain really means the assets are governed not only held on chain, right? The rules around changing metadata, changing hands of the assets are all on chain, which means they're verifiable. That's the first and the second is a bit down the line.
00:26:59.234 - 00:27:55.534, Speaker B: But also, I think, maybe potentially more important is the ability to craft arbitrary social interactions in a way that the game engine understands. So I analogize this as kind of to the real world law enforcement layer, right? We already have digital assets which are comparable to real world assets. They're very valuable. People care about them. They don't want to lose their NFTs. So now if we look at traditional multiplayer games, how do players interact with each other? They're often limited to the game company's social model, the social model that the game company forced them to participate in, right? Whether it's like pure competition in StarCraft or pure alliances in things like games like Rise of Kingdoms or World of Warcraft, these type of games, there's nothing between collaboration and cooperation. Typically there's very few exceptions.
00:27:55.534 - 00:28:49.110, Speaker B: Evolve online is like kind of an exception, though not really in web3 games. And eventually, like on chain MMOs, what we'll see are emergent social organizations in the form of smart contracts acting as social contracts. This we've already validated with our game that launched this January called Treaty, which allowed it's a forex game that allowed people to essentially draft of social contracts like non aggression pact, embargo pact, and that goes into effect the game engine. Right? Because smart contracts automatically get executed and they tied to your NFTs, to your tokens. When the virtual world becomes more complex, this piece gets infinitely more important and interesting. Think of the real world without the corporate laws, for example, we wouldn't be here, right? We wouldn't be doing so many interesting things. And that's, I think, one of the biggest unlocks of fully on chain games.
00:28:51.930 - 00:29:35.730, Speaker C: So we've all kind of discussed the promised land, the bright side of hey. Using and building web3 games really enables in each of your cases like a unique experience for your users. And what about the downsides? So I think because the reason I want to ask that is because there's also a lot of infrastructure builders today with us and I think they would take a lot of inspirations hearing from hey during your development the process of building a web3 game. Which part of the tech stack you are most frustrated with and are there anything that you wish you could see improvements on that would make your lives easier?
00:29:37.190 - 00:30:37.670, Speaker B: Everything I can start. There are a lot of pieces, a lot of components of the tech that we're dissatisfied with. Number one is just as fully on chain games probably unique to us, the back end engine or the engine as people call it in onchain game space. Really the key problem is that the most popular VMs, like EVMs, Darknet, Solana these VMs are not made for games, right? They don't have built in parallelization, they don't have gametic. There's a lack of game libraries and typically have very bad performance if you want to build relatively fast games, multiplayer games. So that's why we built Keystone. It's really a piece of infrastructure that allows us to patch the problem there and to build actually fast games while maintaining the composability and the verifiability.
00:30:37.670 - 00:30:51.420, Speaker B: And then a problem that probably is shared among a lot of our projects is like the onboarding user experience, the wallets, the cross chain, all that kind of stuff. So I'll leave you guys to it because a lot of you have launched already.
00:30:52.910 - 00:31:31.334, Speaker E: Yeah, I can add to that. So one thing about the tech that's really frustrating, still very frustrating, is initially I wanted to store the neural networks on chain. It was feasible when the game was a lot simpler and you had small neural networks. Obviously as we started making the game more complex, that's not feasible. It took like 20 transactions to push one neural network on chain and if users are constantly updating it, it's just not feasible. So then we put it on IPFS. That's also not great because when we just push it to IPFS, it takes like 15 minutes to retrieve and users can't actually use the model.
00:31:31.334 - 00:31:54.030, Speaker E: So we're forced to have redundancies and just basically pull the model from our own centralized databases. So those are some of the annoying things like you said, onboarding, in addition to just the tech for Onboarding, just a lot of web two gamers, as soon as they hear web3 they just run away, even if they like the game. So that's a big difficulty.
00:31:55.410 - 00:32:59.422, Speaker F: Well, there are a lot of difficulties in developing and especially in promoting a very successful web3 games because you have to attract not only those web3 users, but also those web two gamers. But most important issue I think is still the issue of the gas fees. Because this is really counterintuitive to convince a gamer to play your game, but before playing your game, or before transferring his NFTs, before accessing your game, he still has to pay some kind of a gas fees. It's not about the cost of the gas fee, whether it's high or low, even it is extremely low, it is still counterintuitive that he has to pay something upfront. So it is really counter natural. But we understand that gat fee is also very important in making the whole network efficient and also making that safe. But we are looking for ways really to solve this issue with all potential partners.
00:32:59.422 - 00:34:03.306, Speaker F: Especially in that we know that there are a lot of side chain solutions and also layer two solutions. But the thing, the issue is that more than 80% of total transaction volumes of the whole Ft markets are generated by VIP clients and institutional players, not by retail. So. Retail's constitute represent around 95% of the total transaction number of the Ft market, but less than 20% of the total transaction volumes. That is to say, in order to make your gaming economy sustainable, you have to really identify and attract those VIPs, those high Nets worth individuals and institution players to come to access your game and to trade your NFTs. But these kind of people, I think most of them are still in the main nets, not in layer two, not in side chains. So if some chain solution providers could really attract these kind of towards individuals, I think they were attracting most of the users and most popular games too.
00:34:03.306 - 00:34:14.380, Speaker F: And also if someone could really provide a solution to decrease significantly those gas fees in the main net, I think there's a great solution too. Thank you.
00:34:15.550 - 00:35:02.186, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with everything that's been said. There are a lot of challenges on the technical side on making sure everything's synced. On the community side, there are a lot of issues as well. You end up with a player base whose main purpose with playing your game is profits rather than just having fun, which does also create issues when you're trying to build a healthy, thriving community. But on top of it, I think at the end of the day, the biggest problem is distribution. When you look at platforms like Steam being completely turned off for games, that does become a problem because that's where most of the PC market is, right? Same with Apple, Google. But the good part is we're starting to see that shift, right.
00:35:02.186 - 00:35:37.746, Speaker D: For our self block lords. We're on Epic Game Store. We're actually going live with our open beta in the coming week. Please wish list, please play it. But I think this is what we're also going to see in the next few years is we're going to see way more games trying or maybe even succeeding in going on Steam. We're going to see more users being drawn into those via those mainstream platform, into trying Web Three elements of games, whether it's NFTs, whether it's tokens, whether it's just the back end. And hopefully within a few years we can start moving towards a world where people aren't scared of the word Web Three or NFT like they were with Creator League.
00:35:37.778 - 00:35:37.974, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:38.012 - 00:35:51.900, Speaker D: And there are going to be some projects where it literally doesn't matter. And yeah, in the future, as it's been said before, it's not going to matter if it's Web Two or Web Three, it's just going to be a game and there's going to be liquidity and it's whether you want to access it or not.
00:35:52.590 - 00:36:24.390, Speaker B: I want to add a small piece to the distribution point you brought up, which is like where you put the first paywall to players, right? It's actually a very tough decision for web3, typically, because if you put it before all the players, all the experience, then you risk losing a lot of players before they even try your game, where if you put them after some experience, then you fear that they won't buy your NFTs because they already kind of try out the game. So yeah, that's also a challenge I think faced by a lot of games.
00:36:24.730 - 00:36:38.460, Speaker C: So one last thing before we wrap it up. Unfortunately we're running out of time, but what's new in your guys'pipeline? Where can people find you? Are there any exciting updates that people should be looking forward to?
00:36:41.670 - 00:37:06.970, Speaker B: Sure, I can start. So yeah, we're building our first game, as I mentioned earlier, it won't be just the proof of concept like before, which we've done twice. The game is in alpha development and we will launch the game beginning of next year. And the best way to follow us would be on Twitter. It's zero xql. For those of you game developers. We're also building Keystone, which is very specific.
00:37:06.970 - 00:37:30.386, Speaker B: It's basically an infrastack for building on chain games. Basically helps you connect the logic to the blockchain or build the logic in an interoperable way with the EVM, and also to have the infrastructure where players can verify the game progression. So if you're interested in using or contributing, definitely check it out or talk.
00:37:30.408 - 00:38:05.760, Speaker E: To me as well in terms of updates. Yeah, we're actively doing play tests, so if you're interested in testing out the game, you can follow us on Twitter and join our discord. As soon as you join our discord, you can just hit up one of the mods, say I want to try it out, and then they'll pipe you into a funnel that we have for people that want to try out the game. And eventually you can enter our competitions. We have competitions on a frequent basis where if you place in the top 10%, we actually just give out our NFTs. So yeah, check us out.
00:38:07.330 - 00:39:01.200, Speaker F: Well, as one of the most popular games in this universe, our first episode of Matrix File is essentially mobile apps game CS go style. And we just finished the second large scale online test, the alpha test, and got tremendous results, tremendous success, with more than 200,000 registered users and more than 100,000 downloads. And we will probably launch the beta test, the loss test, before the official launch during Q Four this year and the official launch is due around the end of this year or the debut of next year. And also the Battle Royal parts of our game, that is to say the PUBG Star game is also already under developments and probably before the end of next year you will see the PUBG Star game of Matrix File. Thank you.
00:39:01.890 - 00:39:23.182, Speaker D: And as mentioned, Lock Lords is going on the Epic Game store this week. So please wish list download. The game will be free. There's dozens of resources to know, dozens of squad to choose from. We're going to have Bears attack you, so you can go and truly live out your fantasies of killing a bear. That's the reason I made the game. And a free NFT hero to anybody who plays.
00:39:23.182 - 00:39:25.966, Speaker D: So please come join the Block Lords universe.
00:39:26.158 - 00:39:29.980, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you so much. A round of applause for our panelists. Thank you.
