00:00:00.250 - 00:00:30.120, Speaker A: Panel is about DeFi. And we have Joy from ABCDE as the moderator, and Daida from Dodo, and Ken from Pando, rick from Games, jasper from Panoptic, and Marat from GSR as the panelists. Yeah, it's our final panelists. Also, thank you again for staying so long. Also, I would like to remind the people in the back to keep your voice low, to be polite, and also so get ready for our final panel right now.
00:00:41.930 - 00:01:49.360, Speaker B: Moderator thank you. No, still missing one. All right. Hey everyone. I know this is a super long day, but I hope you enjoy all the panels here today. We have a lot of panelists here. How about before we start a session, please give a little bit of short introduction of yourself as well as your project.
00:01:51.410 - 00:02:15.560, Speaker C: Hi everyone, I'm Yeo Yeo, the research lead at Dodo. Dodo is a Dex based PMM algorithm, and we are trying to provide the best on chain liquidity with market make strategy. Excited to be here and discuss with all your guys about the new DeFi trends. Yeah.
00:02:17.290 - 00:02:17.654, Speaker D: Hi.
00:02:17.692 - 00:02:34.730, Speaker E: I'm Ken. I lead the institutional business at Pendle. We provide a market for fixed rates and yield trading in DeFi. We support different types of underlying assets, including East LSDs perp decks protocols, as well as real world assets.
00:02:35.870 - 00:02:58.820, Speaker F: I'm Rick, I'm a core contributor at Gains Network, which is an onchain perpetual futures exchange. We allow you to trade crypto, forex, and commodities crypto up to 150 X leverage and forex and commodities forex up to 1500 X leverage. And yeah, we have the most capital efficient system, I would say.
00:03:00.710 - 00:03:17.420, Speaker D: Hi, my name is Morad, I work at GSR. I've been there since 2014. GSR is a crypto market maker liquidity provider, initially on centralized exchanges, but more and more on decentralized exchanges, and that's where my focus is.
00:03:18.830 - 00:03:41.200, Speaker G: Hi, I'm Jesper. I'm very excited to be here. I'm co founder of Panoptic. We're creating perpetual options that are oracle free as well and can run on ethereum mainnet. So we've invented a new way to bring basically options to decentralized ecosystems that are entirely permissionless as well. Very excited to be here. Thank you.
00:03:41.730 - 00:04:04.540, Speaker B: Yeah, great. It looks like everyone is in this space for a long time, and we know in 2020 we have DFI Summer, and after DFI Summer, we see an explosive growth of DFI protocols. Just wanted to know, how do you foresee the future of DFI? Do you think there is going to be another DeFi Summer later in this one or two years? What's your opinion on that?
00:04:06.350 - 00:05:25.630, Speaker C: Yeah, as you can see, since Defy Summer, many DeFi developers actively exploring and building more services for the ecosystem. So now Defy World has gotten way bigger in terms of TVL number of users and other protocols out there. In my view. In the short term, with more and more essays remain unused in the industry and people are finding ways to earn a steady income. So DeFi has gradually shifted in two directions, like inward development, like LS DeFi, and outward development like RWA. If there will be a DeFi summer, I guess I believe we'll get there. And if we talk about the future of DeFi, maybe I hope Monday DeFi can achieve the thing described by the intent narratives.
00:05:25.630 - 00:05:42.520, Speaker C: Basically, like users no longer need to switch chains, frequently jump different platforms, or send multiple approvals in a row. We know how frustrating it can be.
00:05:44.250 - 00:06:39.462, Speaker E: So I think we've come a long way from DFI summer a lot of unsustainable sources of yields in 2020. Today, obviously a lot of that has changed. We have real infrastructure that we can use with money markets, with Perdexes, which also leads to real sources of yields. Post Ethereum Chappelle upgrade, you get ETH Staking yield that's becoming more and more ubiquitous and then you get GMX and Gains network providing LPs with real sources of yields. So I think where we are today is that we're seeing more and more financialization of those yields. And that's one of the use cases that we do at Pendle. In terms of the future of DeFi, I think we'll probably see more integration of DeFi into mainstream centralized platforms, especially post Luna, post FTX.
00:06:39.462 - 00:06:48.010, Speaker E: I think there's more and more need for noncustodial services that basically serve as the plumbing into most of crypto.
00:06:48.910 - 00:07:44.394, Speaker F: Yeah, so I think since the DFI summary in 2020, we've definitely came a long way. I would say it was a time when money was cheap and when the new asset class and it's exciting, you can kind of go into this rampant speculation mode. But yeah, as Ken mentioned, a lot of it is based on hype and no real yield. So for example, at Gains we basically found real product market fit where people are actually willing to pay a price for the product that they're using without incentivization of tokens. And I think this is a very powerful thing because we finally see the real strength of DeFi here. There are innovations that you can build on blockchain tech that haven't been possible before. Like for example, we recently pushed the Lookbex update which allows you to have guaranteed order execution on chain.
00:07:44.394 - 00:08:20.602, Speaker F: And this would only be possible in a deterministic settlement layer like a blockchain. So that is like an innovation that you will not see in web two. Not even finance can do that. Only we can as of now. But we'll likely see copycat soon, maybe we don't know. And for the future growth of DFI, I think there's like a fast way and a slow way. The fast way is probably like, okay, we're in a higher interest rate environment, something breaks down, people feel unsatisfied and they just all go through DeFi because it's the only option.
00:08:20.602 - 00:08:34.320, Speaker F: And the slow pace is okay, we just keep on iterating until the efficiency of the system that we're building outpaces, whatever efficiency the legacy system is lacking and then people would just slowly move over.
00:08:37.010 - 00:09:36.740, Speaker D: I do think that DFI is the cat is out the bag and it's here to stay. I don't think it's going away anywhere in terms of like actual TVL. I think during 20, 21, 22 it may have been a bit too inflated with the tokens and the food coins having extreme values and stuff like that. But I think the building blocks, most of them came early on in DFI, some newer ones came a little bit later. Specifically I'm thinking of like protocol owned liquidity and stuff like this which is something new that you probably aren't seeing in TradFi and I think it especially serves a purpose for long tail assets and stuff like this where you probably won't have as developed markets for them. So I think it's got its place.
00:09:38.950 - 00:10:31.058, Speaker G: Yeah, a lot of the stuff has already been said but I personally take a very long term view on the ecosystem and the industry and when you kind of zoom out I just think it's super apparent, at least that's my perspective, that kind of paraphrasing murad but the genie is out of the bottle. I mean we're not going to go back on this. The technology is there. I think we're just experiencing kind of a natural evolution of just exploring what's possible and unfortunately that has led to some scammy things. It kind of always has in history when a new technology has come around. But I do think what we're seeing is an underlying trend that is up to the right which is things are actually being built on the back end. It's just not going as fast as the hype cycles because at the end of the day we can't build as fast as our imagination can take us.
00:10:31.058 - 00:11:18.210, Speaker G: So the hype cycle kind of follows the imagination and gets a little bit depressed when it doesn't quite come to fruition yet. But we're going in that direction and the future will run entirely on blockchain in like 99% of the cases. That's my perspective, I have no doubt about that. We do need to do a lot of evolution with the technology but we'll get there over time and anything health, tech, supply chains, finance, of course everything will run on blockchain, I have just no doubt about it. So I'm very bullish long term on everything but there is some noise and there are some cycles we got to go through but I think we'll have a few more cycles too with like CK technology and know things like RWA, who knows? But there are going to be other hype cycles.
00:11:18.630 - 00:11:36.220, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you have a strong belief in DeFi. So the answer to the question of do you think DeFi will eventually replace the bank system? So your answer is jasper's answer is definitely yes, I guess. What about the others?
00:11:40.590 - 00:12:23.190, Speaker D: I think there's challenges the further out you look the more and more likely it is, but I think in the short term there's definitely challenges. The one that comes to mind is most on chain DeFi. Financial products that are out there are usually over collateralized rather than under collateralized, which is the very common thing in TradFi. So there's ways to get there maybe proof of personhood and KYC and stuff like this or credit risk and credit scores, but I think it's moving in that direction.
00:12:25.370 - 00:13:09.862, Speaker F: I have my own yeah, I definitely agree on the credit stuff. I know that we hate under collateralized lending in DeFi, but no ecosystem can grow without undercollateralized lending. You just need good credit markets. So I think that will be once we figure that out, I think that will be like a major push for growth as well. And yeah, we don't have all the infrastructure yet, but I think I know the smartest people that I know are basically working on building out the infrastructure that we need to have. For example, governments be comfortable running their rails on a blockchain back end. And I mean the internet has been around for like 35 years, okay.
00:13:09.862 - 00:13:36.094, Speaker F: As we know it a little bit longer maybe or whatever, like 35, 40 years and we're just at the start basically. It's going to integrate into our lives so much more. And it just seems insane to me that in 20 or 30 years we'll still be running the world's financial system on legacy banking tech. Like, no, that's not going to happen. It needs to be something else and I think it's going to be for sure. For sure.
00:13:36.132 - 00:13:36.720, Speaker G: Yes.
00:13:37.730 - 00:13:55.810, Speaker B: Got it. Then I have another question regarding one of the challenges in DeFi is the mass adoption, right? So I wanted to know, maybe from Ken, from your perspective, how do you onboard more institution users or like retail users to use your protocols?
00:13:55.970 - 00:14:56.540, Speaker E: I think for retail it's quite straightforward in the sense that a lot of the DeFi mechanics is quite cumbersome still. So getting into DeFi, getting assets onboarded, figuring out what the basic OpSec looks like, I think that's all quite an obstacle and it needs to be abstracted away with regards to institutional clients. There's an element of operational hurdles as well, but I think more importantly, availability of risk reporting tools. So how do you manage risk? How do you measure? And I think a lot of the risk in DeFi is still quite hard to measure, especially when it comes to smart contract risk. When it comes to risks that are basically binary in nature, you kind of sign a haircut to that. So that's going to be quite challenging for the time being. Although I think in this bare period there's a lot of infrastructure projects have been built to solve all these problems.
00:14:56.540 - 00:15:10.806, Speaker E: But for now what we are doubling down on is at least on the education side, not only on our product and how our markets work, but also just best practices that we've seen from other institutional clients.
00:15:10.998 - 00:15:18.426, Speaker B: Yeah, I like pendo. You have different version, right? You have the concise version for retailers and you have a little bit more complicated version for institutions.
00:15:18.538 - 00:15:32.718, Speaker E: Yes, we do have two front ends Pendle earn that is more geared towards retail users, a simple way to long fixed rates, and we have trade where the market is a bit more sophisticated and you have the ability to go both sides.
00:15:32.814 - 00:15:37.670, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense. How about Jasper, what's your idea in terms of the mass adoption?
00:15:39.050 - 00:16:26.840, Speaker G: I think a few things have to happen. So one is really we got to overcome this regulatory kind of monster, if you will, which is just really hindering a lot of growth in the space and obviously there's some shadiness going on there. But once that clarity comes around, then I think we'll see a lot more kind of inflow of capital and interest in the space. That's one thing. The other thing is also security. We really got to step up in general the security of these smart contracts because the hacks are just too much right now. We really do need to figure out a better way and that comes through just better tooling, better education of our engineers and so on.
00:16:26.840 - 00:17:11.442, Speaker G: And then I think also just we got to make it more user friendly for retail as well. It's still a little too advanced to use for many folks. So to really get that broad adoption, I think we got to make it at least as easy and simple as kind of like where Fintech so Fintech has made the UI experience of very, very simple. But where Fintech is not going to be able to keep innovating and iterating is, they have the fundamental limitation of the rails they're running on is this old, old financial system that still codes and cobalt and like there's only two engineers at a bank that's allowed to touch the code, right. Because everything breaks. This is not the future, obviously. Right.
00:17:11.442 - 00:17:37.020, Speaker G: So what blockchain brings is kind of what Fintech wanted to do essentially. Right. So maybe we even need to rebrand to Fintech because that's kind of what we are. But if you can kind of take the UI of Fintech and keep iterating on that and put it on the rails of Blockchain, I think that's going to be important too because that's what the users are used to. So when you start having this lock in and the hex address and all this stuff, they're kind of like what am I doing? So I think those are kind of some broad things that need to happen.
00:17:37.490 - 00:17:37.902, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:37.956 - 00:17:52.530, Speaker B: I think all of you touch base on from the regulatory perspective. But do you think the DeFi protocol can be regulated by the government or by someone else? Maybe this question goes to moret.
00:17:54.630 - 00:18:28.686, Speaker D: Yeah, this is a difficult one. I think there's a lot that we can do and that many projects in the space are doing to be like self regulatory. But I mean, ultimately regulation means that it's an authority, it's usually a government and it does seem like some games or something are going on. It's very difficult. I know that a lot of people that we deal with are on the sidelines. Until there's some clarity around that, it's a difficult one.
00:18:28.788 - 00:18:31.070, Speaker B: Yeah, got it. How about Yao? Yao.
00:18:33.890 - 00:19:22.720, Speaker C: Personally, I would say regulating a decentralized system is inherently challenging, but it's not impossible. Regulators can focus on the on wraps and off wraps where the fair to mali enters and exits the DeFi ecosystems. Additionally, developers and project leaders, they can make sure that their platforms adhere to the local regulations. But generally speaking, it's a complex issue and the approach will likely vary by.
00:19:27.410 - 00:19:29.360, Speaker B: Yeah. Nick, how do you think?
00:19:30.530 - 00:20:39.654, Speaker F: I think it can be regulated, it's just that in my view, a lot of people that work at government are pretty a little bit mid and I think if you have like the government has no way to attest whether or not civilization can rely upon ZK proof. So for example, with DeFi problem is no counterparty risk is great unless the counterparty is a sanctioned entity. So how do we know that the counterparty is not a sanctioned entity? Well, we can use ZK proofs but nobody at government will, at least that I know of, is actively pushing for this type of technology because they know it works. So it's kind of like a chicken and egg problem where government doesn't know if we can rely on it and we can't prove that we can rely on it without the regulation. So I think the way forward is like maybe some type of special economic zone where D five people can just mess around and figure it out. But I do think that is what it requires. Like it needs some type of break in in a positive way else it's going to take a very long time.
00:20:39.654 - 00:20:41.366, Speaker F: But we'll be here.
00:20:41.548 - 00:20:59.614, Speaker B: Yeah. Sometimes black swan events actually push the industry forward to some extent. Yeah. I'd also love to know more about the real world assets and how DeFi is utilized under the scenario of real world assets. RWA anyone has an opinion regarding that? Maybe?
00:20:59.652 - 00:21:56.302, Speaker F: Nick? I do have an opinion. I think real world assets are going to play a very important role. However, the domain model of a blockchain that we're working with is pretty so like how do you express a complicated legal contract on chain? Right now it's pretty much impossible. So you would need to have some natural semantic language and data at a station that you can prove that this contract is legally binding and there's some type of way of enforcing this. And I think there are definitely technologies being built that allows us to have more of these capabilities like account abstraction where you can build permissioned wallet, like some permissioned wallet where you can enforce more complicated contracts than we can now. But yeah, the real world needs to go on chain 100% that will happen but we just need better infrastructure for it I would say.
00:21:56.436 - 00:22:22.802, Speaker B: Yeah that makes sense. I think a lot of banks actually wanted to enter this sector because they already have the evaluation of the collaterals as well. So I talked to one of the banks from Standard charities and then they wanted to see more about the best practices of RWA and how know how things could work maybe. How about Ken, can you give us some examples?
00:22:22.946 - 00:23:16.890, Speaker E: I think RWAs has a very strong PMF in the sense that there are a lot of assets on chain managed by let's say large entities like DAOs or even some centralized entities that would like the ability to go risk on and risk off easily, especially now with rates coming up. It's a very strong use case and I think what is interesting about the prospects of RWE and DeFi is the fact that there will be more different types of primitives built on top of that as a base layer. So once you have for example T bill's rates available on chain in size you can enable a lot of other things. For example on Pendle obviously we have the ability to speculate on the direction of RWAs on chain and I think there'll be so much more use case in terms of using them as collateral, using them as different services in DeFi.
00:23:18.030 - 00:23:24.694, Speaker B: Jasper? Yeah. Do you have any practices on your protocol regarding RWA perpetual?
00:23:24.822 - 00:24:11.340, Speaker G: Yeah so for example Panoptic is purely on chain, it's permissionless, it's oracle free as well. So the point is that we're very bullish on a future where everything lives on chain and in kind of a self contained ecosystem as well. And yeah, having that bridge to the real world, I think is important. But once it lives on chain I'm also very excited about this kind of opening up to all these new things you can do now, like building. New primitives on top of that, building derivatives on top of that, having options on top of that, all kinds of stuff you can do. And you can even do things that TradFi of course can't do. And I'm actually very excited to see those kind of solutions come up as well in the future.
00:24:11.340 - 00:25:30.340, Speaker G: So I think we can really also expand the economy quite a lot more in general because things can get a lot more kind of fluid and can integrate much better and much more easily and also become ideally in my own hope less siloed. So for example the openness of web three I think is going to help us really work towards growing everything the economy better. So, for example, if you look at TradFi, you have all these financial engineers sitting in one institution in a siloed, closed source environment, and then they go to another financial institution and they just implement the same thing and then the same thing, and it all's just a waste of time and energy because how about we just implement it once or whatever, like a few times? And then we have that as a base layer, and then we kind of keep building on top, like money legos on top of all this, so that we keep moving things forward and come up with new, innovative, interesting solutions for everybody, and hopefully can provide more financial means and better. Primitives to more people in general, not just the elites and everything, but we can really bring more people into a better financial environment in general. So I'm very bullish on bringing the existing world on chain. And then once on chain, I think it's a whole new universe that you open up.
00:25:31.110 - 00:25:56.170, Speaker B: Yeah, you're bullish in every sector, basically. That's great. That's great. Very optimistic. And also I wanted to know, what do you think are the challenges for RWA? Do you think it's lack of standards or there's something else, or a regulatory perspective? What do you think are the challenges here? It's at a very early stage, by the way. Maybe murad.
00:25:58.610 - 00:26:51.760, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll say definitely it needs to be more expressive. As you were talking about, I don't think we're going to expect lawyers to write solidity code very well. So there probably needs to be some layer above that and basically that's translating into security problems. If you want something to be quasilegal or enforceable in a legal way, then it sort of breaks the bearer asset thing. I do think there's a lot of synergy between NFTs and DeFi, even though they're sometimes seen as separate, but stuff like soul bound tokens and stuff like this or whitelists on who can interact with a certain asset on chain. So I think security is the big one.
00:26:52.690 - 00:26:56.446, Speaker B: Got it. Nick, how about you?
00:26:56.628 - 00:28:14.940, Speaker F: I would say there's also I think a challenge is the interoperability with legacy systems in a sense. So right now, there's not that many ways for a legacy system to talk to a blockchain system. And I know the guys at Chainlink are doing their best to bring this all on chain, but that would be like an infrastructure need that is very much needed for real world assets to become a real thing. Like, okay, we have the custodian of the bank who's holding all these bonds, and then there we know the bank has the bonds and then they can interact with the blockchain system and basically open this up to this global financial ecosystem that we're building. I also think for now, because we are still kind of like a small ecosystem, us as a consumer, as the DeFi is not big enough for people to actively push from the legacy side things on chain. So it really needs to be a clear efficiency gain on their end for them to do that. Or we just need to bring so many people in with like a hook of some sorts that the consumer side grows and then they will want to be on chain because that's where the consumer is.
00:28:16.110 - 00:28:52.306, Speaker B: That makes sense. There is kind of like an investment cycle where it's kind of like you have the application and then infrastructure grows and then it's application and then pushes to the infrastructure. So it's kind of like that. Right? So right now we still need more applications on chain and doing DeFi and then maybe when the user space become larger and larger and then we will push back the regulatory perspective as well as the infrastructure as well. Yeah. So how about Ken, how do you think about the future of RWA as well as its integration with the TFI?
00:28:52.498 - 00:29:35.890, Speaker E: I think RWAs the current biggest challenge is probably on composability because a lot of products like Tbills on chain are very permissioned, they're very behind KYC walls for example. But I think the industry has been innovating on that front to come up with say, money markets that leverage on T bill tokens as collateral and then using those tokens that you borrow to be more fungible across DeFi. So I think seeing some trends there and I think as we see more developments not just in RWS but even other spaces like E Three Staking and whatnot, I think those concepts potentially could apply us also to Tbills.
00:29:37.110 - 00:29:38.690, Speaker B: How about Yao? Yao.
00:29:41.610 - 00:30:52.380, Speaker C: Yeah. RWA is a promising frontier and right now many old defy protocols they have started to target RWA track. I know that maker JOWS their RWA accolation exceeds to $2 billion and generating like $1 million in revenue. I don't remember the specific number, but pretty much like this. The true potential of RWA use cases is yet to be fully unlocked right now, but they are print on the market. So I guess maybe other DeFi protocols, maybe they can figure out how do they improve their protocols with RWA expect like you told the yeah, and I think that's important.
00:30:54.190 - 00:31:22.040, Speaker B: Yeah, great. One final question. I think this goes to you all. We're talking about a lot of challenges in DeFi, but I also wanted to know, do you guys see any opportunities and in which direction do you think it will grow massive, like maybe in the next one or two years and maybe talking about your project a little bit like which direction you wanted to go. I want to hear some secrets. All right, let's go with Jasper first.
00:31:23.770 - 00:32:19.506, Speaker G: Yeah, that's an easy one for me. I'm very bullish bullish on everything. I personally think that talking about the project a little bit at Panoptic we really want to see the options side of DeFi grow quite a lot more than it has. It's still pretty quite suppressed. So we want decentralized permissionless fully on chain options to really become a thing because any financial ecosystem that's healthy has the four pillars, including futures. But then importantly also options and so on. That's what I would love to see, really kind of just also get more just comfortability about stable yields, I think is very important because the capital, I think, is just a little bit scared and uneasy because they're entering.
00:32:19.506 - 00:33:10.200, Speaker G: Into this system where everything is much more turbulent, but having some sort of stability, which then RWAs can help with. And other protocols, of course. Also on this panel we'll hear about, but just like creating just a healthy ecosystem as a baseline so we get that capital on chain and into the industry and then they can always kind of go from there and do more risky things as they like. But the fact that they're not even want to go on chain yet, right, because it's like all just unfortunately a lot of hacks and not predictable yields and stuff I think is hindering the space. What we hope to do at Panoptic is really to bring options on chain and grow that and make that work in a fully decentralized permissionless manner. So yeah, that's what I'm hoping to see.
00:33:13.520 - 00:33:35.540, Speaker D: Yeah, on my side as a trading firm and a regulated trading firm at that, we would like to see more institutions get comfortable and whatever they need around that. So any innovation in that direction is sort of where we're keeping our eyes focused.
00:33:36.600 - 00:34:24.230, Speaker F: Well, for Gains, I think where it's going to go is that like a couple of years ago everybody was trading at centralized exchanges. Right now it's more like 40 60 on chain volume, spot volume versus 60% centralized spot volume. And a lot of that is also like HFT arbitrage opportunities. But if you look at the perp space of the perpetual futures volume, only 1.2% is happening on chain. And we think, or at least I believe that we're going to follow trend with Spot and it's such a massive, massive, massive opportunity. And I really think at Gains we're basically just at the start of where we're going to be.
00:34:24.230 - 00:35:14.180, Speaker F: I mean, we already showed with our recent updates that we can do things that nobody else can because we are on chain and that is where the power of blockchain really shines. Like doing these things that only are capable, that you're only capable of doing them on chain. So I think Gains is basically our architecture is the best when it comes to capital efficiency. So with the lowest TVL you could trade the largest position sizes and that is the powerful part of our protocol basically. And at some point in time I believe that we're going to be everywhere, basically. And I know that our team is the one who's going to clear it. We are the team that's going to do it.
00:35:14.180 - 00:35:24.330, Speaker F: I think we iterate faster than anybody else and yeah, we're going to see massive growth on the onchain perps and we are going to be number one.
00:35:27.340 - 00:36:39.010, Speaker C: Yeah, for Dodo, we are still focused on the. Liquidity efficiency and that's what Dodo V Three is building to. And we are focused on market making strategies, especially for those more market makers. We are trying to provide these flexible tools for those market makers to help them to earn the best benefits. On our dodo. For other aspects, I would like to say I really like the RWA, just like I told, I think it has a huge potential and will release some huge potential in the future. No one can say when Defy reach the next trillion dollar milestone, but I believe those of us we have reason to believe that we will get there sooner or later.
00:36:41.620 - 00:37:23.500, Speaker E: Just echoing what Rick just mentioned, I think we're starting to see more and more things that used to be only able to be done on CIFI like exchanges and lenders like BlockFi for example. A lot of that can now be done directly on DeFi. You see like GMX and gainstrade very seamless experience, very similar experience. And I think I would like to see more centralized platforms utilize DeFi as the back end. So a simple example would be for Pendle. We have Pendleearn, which is a modular way to plug in our service into exchanges. Most recently we've seen adoption from exchanges like Okx who's adopted Pendleearn as a way to get fixed rates on their platform.
00:37:23.500 - 00:37:25.070, Speaker E: So we'd like to see more of that.
00:37:29.630 - 00:37:59.090, Speaker B: Hi. Totally agreed. And I also think the smooth seamless user experience of trade on different platforms is important for DeFi protocols as well. Great. I think we have a great panel. Do you have any last questions or last words to the future of DeFi? Maybe just say one person, shout out one sentence to the future of DeFi and then we're going to end today's session. Okay, Jasper, don't say you're bullish on everything.
00:37:59.090 - 00:38:04.690, Speaker B: Okay? Yeah, let's go with the Yao yao.
00:38:06.150 - 00:38:08.430, Speaker C: Very simple, long DeFi.
00:38:08.590 - 00:38:09.300, Speaker B: Okay.
00:38:12.070 - 00:38:20.570, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it's going to be quite invisible. I think in terms of the developments, DeFi will be basically the plumbing of CFI.
00:38:23.480 - 00:38:25.700, Speaker F: Trygains trade.
00:38:26.120 - 00:38:26.870, Speaker B: Nice.
00:38:27.720 - 00:38:29.620, Speaker D: Let's bring everything on chain.
00:38:31.400 - 00:38:33.220, Speaker G: I am not bearish.
00:38:34.680 - 00:38:44.730, Speaker B: Great. Thank you all. Thank you all. I hope you enjoyed the panel and thanks everyone for attending this panel. Thank you all. It.
