00:00:00.320 - 00:00:36.980, Speaker A: All right, trying to catch up on lost time, I guess. I think we will start by a show of hands, which is, of the people in this room, how many are convinced that Defi is the future of finance? Let's say awesome. Pretty much everyone. We're not going to be that adversarial here. Let's say we're going to introduce a complimentary vision to that. My name is Ola. I'm the founder and CEO of Delta.
00:00:36.980 - 00:01:14.990, Speaker A: This talk is going to be a little bit of a, you can call it a taste of what we're up to. We're not really going to go public for another few months. This will be fairly high level. You will hear more about us in the future. But the goal of this talk is really just to give you, like a little tidbits here and there about what's going on. The talk is structured as follows. We'll go into the, you know, the architecture, again, staying at a fairly high level, getting to the properties that are enabled by this, the kind of overall overarching vision.
00:01:14.990 - 00:01:55.218, Speaker A: And then we will touch on two financial applications. All right, so sorry. Getting into the architecture, everyone here is probably like a lowercase, our researcher blockchain nerd. It looks a lot like a modular blockchain where. Okay, we have this stacking of the two dimensional layers visualization. The base layer is populated or run by this distributed validator set. They are passing data around.
00:01:55.218 - 00:02:34.190, Speaker A: They're also verifying snarks. Where do the snarks come from? They come from, again, with this visualization, the layer above which this execution layer, this consists of all these little colored dots. The different colors are there to symbolize how heterogeneous this is, how distinctive they can be. So basically what happens is the user submits a transaction to one of these little dots. We call them domains. There, the transactions are ordered into these ordered lists that some would call blocks. They're executed.
00:02:34.190 - 00:03:43.420, Speaker A: The result of these execution is sent down to the base layer, as is approved for valid execution a bit later on because, you know, sb one and the like, there's a bit of latency there still. So where this really differs from, you know, I mean, if you look at this, it kind of looks like we're ripping off like celestia or ethereum or something. The main distinction is there's a single global state. So the little dots, what we call domains, are not actually roll ups. They're not independent blockchains. They're more like, you know, states in a federation or something like that, where they do have they enjoy like a large degree of sovereignty, but they're still tied to this, you know, single global state machine. As mentioned, we have a standardized messaging format where, you know, these stated lists are used to just compute the changes or apply the changes to states.
00:03:43.420 - 00:04:25.126, Speaker A: So they're like the output of the local execution. And then on the settlement layer, they apply upon settlement via snarks. Yes, settlement via snark verification. There is also recursion here. UMA was touching on fry based recursion, which we will also have here. And what that makes is for this nice little single state proof. This is sort of like what Mina has, where you can run a full node and independently verify the entirety of state by just doing a bit of verbal proofs and a bit of verifying what's single smart.
00:04:25.126 - 00:05:07.480, Speaker A: Quite nice. So what are the properties that are enabled by this? One important one is that there is no bridging within the system. So as mentioned, we have these roll up light things that we call domains, which are these execution environments. You can move between them very frictionlessly. I mean, there's this word seamless, which I feel it's just been used and infused in this space. So I feel a bit bad about, again, bringing it up, but really you aren't just like moving within a single state machine. So it's very nice and secure.
00:05:07.480 - 00:05:54.970, Speaker A: This also means that you have censorship resistance. So one of the main concepts that we introduce and which I will touch upon later is the distinction between local and global properties. Um, locally you can have a centralized domain run by, you would call it a centralized sequencer. We call them domain operators. They can run them, you know, as tyrannically as they want to. And the thing is, locally you would not be sensory persistent, right? Like you're submitting your transaction to this single guy, he doesn't like you, you're in trouble. But because we're within this big old global state machine, spinning up new domains, by the way, is permissionless.
00:05:54.970 - 00:06:49.204, Speaker A: So the censorship model is really a censorship resistance model is really that you can just like, you can move between the domains. You don't have to go through your own, like home domain or the current domain. You can talk to the destination. They can themselves verify this transaction because again, they read from this global state bridgeless. It's not like the role of escape hatch thing where you go via the l one, cumbersome. So quite nice. And then we introduce sort of new trust assumptions where the idea is you want it to be possible to have sort of, to have minimal trust assumptions, like only relying on public key and hash based cryptography or something like that, which is the case here as well.
00:06:49.204 - 00:07:31.630, Speaker A: And then on top of that, we allow for domains to these execution environments to live with a variety of different trust models. They can choose to prove the entirety of their computation, but they can also choose to just adhere to very few global laws. So I will get back to this idea of the federation. You have basically certain laws, certain rules, things like signature verification, which, you know, need to be valid everywhere. Every, every domain you can, no domain can spend from anyone's account without receiving a valid signature. And you can steal all your money. It would be kind of, you know, bad.
00:07:31.630 - 00:08:28.828, Speaker A: But then beyond that, they can choose sort of, to what extent do they want to provide their users with the maximally trustless, like we're just going to prove everything approach or, you know, we are coinbase or fidelity or something. You know, you're already trusting us with like doing the stuff that you want us to do without providing a cryptographic proof. So we're just going to continue doing that. And then the thing that we get from all this is we get super hetero, heterogeneous domains because again, we're allowing them to compete across many, many different axes. We keep this very minimal set of global rules and standards that everyone has to adhere to. That's things like, you know, at least originally we're just going to start with a single proof scheme. So like you need to adhere to that.
00:08:28.828 - 00:09:29.306, Speaker A: You need to adhere to the messaging format that is the state of list. But execution, which takes place locally because of graphic proofs, you know, you can kind of do how you want to. All right, what's the ground vision? We're going to present this from like the inside perspective and the call it external, internal and externally. So internally, what this looks like is what I would call the minimal viable federation where you have this federated state, maybe like the US. I live in Switzerland. People like Switzerland where, you know, you have something like membership states or cantons which have a large degree of sovereignty, they can, you know, largely define and determine what their own execution arms are going to look like and how they're going to behave. But this exists within, you know, a greater state which does have some general laws and rules.
00:09:29.306 - 00:11:19.140, Speaker A: The idea is to make the ladder minimal to the point where, you know, we want to ensure interoperability, we want to ensure certain security properties, and then beyond that we get super super opinionated, distinct heterogeneous domains. So what this leads to from the outside looking in is what we call the opt in empires where each domain can have an emperor can be run centrally without harming any of the security properties of the individual user. So again, what the minimal viable federation enables is this set of super opinionated membership states, if you will, which can rule as they like within the bounds which are defined by just quite a minimal set of goals. That brings us to the two example applications that I was going to mention. Generally, I can imagine that what I presented so far, it does imply this sort of, okay, you can run these centralized financial applications or service providers on a domain, you can do it centrally, you run your own execution node, and at the same time all the users have their self custodying, they have ownership of their assets and they're kind of part of this distributed, this network of search applications that can move around really. So the first example is a censorship resistance centralized exchange. This is run essentially exactly like a, you know, call it current coinbase or cracking or whatever.
00:11:19.140 - 00:12:13.690, Speaker A: Any given off chain centralized exchange could be run like this. They just need to provide, you know, a little bit of extra data. They need to, you know, assuming that the users are custodying the assets themselves, the exchange needs to provide, you know, proof of things like signature verification and loss verification and things like that. But yeah, running adults domain, but basically the UX, onboarding everything should feel like onboarding to a centralized exchange. Then additionally you're on it. It's this centralized entry point, you're automatically part of this whole thing. With all the other applications like this, you can move around, you cannot get fucked over, you cannot get SPF'd.
00:12:13.690 - 00:13:32.660, Speaker A: And yeah, you're kind of like, you have the freedom to choose to stay here, but this is really like a market driven decision, right? And then from the exchanges point of view this is also nice because again there are these general standards and rules that all that apply to all the different domains and therefore the interoperability properties are very good. And the exchange can, you know, we don't really care about atomic interoperability, but we will enable it across domains so they can do that if they want to. We suspect that there will be much more like async, non atomic composability, but also, you know, the market will decide the other. The last application that we will go through is a payments network. So here we think of Delta as kind of a, you know, a network of networks of sorts. One of these domains would run a payments network. It can now very easily comply with regulations which are typically a pain in the ass for payments, you know, AML and you know, they can say no, we're only going to do KYC users or whatever.
00:13:32.660 - 00:14:26.670, Speaker A: So that suddenly trivialized. The nice thing here as well is that even though you are, you know, transferring money through a single, you know, centralized entry point, single domain, because of the global state, there's no bridging, again, there's no bridging within Delta. So you can just. You can. You can send your money to anyone, anywhere, just as, you know, frictionlessly, as easily as you could within your own domain. And then again, you have the same benefits of both on the side of the user and on the outside of the network, the application itself. You have access to all these other applications that you can integrate with and will as a user, you can jump around and everything is nice.
00:14:26.670 - 00:14:53.606, Speaker A: Yeah, that's pretty much it. I didn't want to give a super deep dive. I hope everyone has gotten a little taste of what it is that we're doing. You can find us here that Twitter does not have anything happening yet. A month or two. Thank you. Thank you.
00:14:53.638 - 00:15:06.566, Speaker B: Any questions from the audience? Do users need to have a direct, I'm assuming in your case, like, every domain could be except for sex, right? Is that a good way of.
00:15:06.598 - 00:15:07.030, Speaker A: Yes.
00:15:07.150 - 00:15:21.066, Speaker B: So would I have to first sign up with the sex directly and then integrate that into delta? Like, you know, it seems like don't sex is really have to retool to support this because it sounds like.
00:15:21.138 - 00:15:43.800, Speaker A: Yeah, probably a little bit. Okay, probably a little bit. I mean, you, for this example, you would need a sort of launching account, right? So that in and of itself, there's a little bit. But the point is, for example, the matching engine does not have to be proven. There's a lot of computation that doesn't have to be proven. So, you know, I'm not gonna say that it's like a zero lift, but should be pretty feasible.
00:15:44.340 - 00:15:49.280, Speaker B: What is the incentive for sex to join the delta network?
00:15:49.780 - 00:16:15.024, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry. We can think of this from like a single player multiplayer, you know, single player, only the sex is there. Ah, maybe it's not super useful. Assuming a world in which there are a bunch of different domains and a bunch of different users around. I mean, you. You have this, like, you're automatically part of a much bigger ecosystem. So there's kind of this, you know, there's like the character of the stick.
00:16:15.024 - 00:16:30.800, Speaker A: Like, you don't opt in, someone else does, and they get the users because the users can suddenly now, like, use their same account for, like their, you know, uber or whatever. Right. Because it's part of the whole thing. So that would be because I almost.
00:16:30.840 - 00:16:38.778, Speaker B: Feel like, you know, if I'm a sex operator, I'm a big sex operator. I kind of want that Cody locked up within my garden.
00:16:38.834 - 00:16:39.522, Speaker A: Right. Yeah.
00:16:39.626 - 00:16:49.330, Speaker B: Under your model it kind of resolves to this like self custodial ish type of layer. So is the pitch there for like tier two and tier three sexes?
00:16:49.410 - 00:17:19.260, Speaker A: Probably, actually. I mean, this is, this is interesting. Everyone should look into, you know, the rise of credit cards in the US. Wherever I I'll be brief. It started out with like every department store and every little business had their own, like, and it was basically like a loyalty card. And then some of the big like general ones came out. But the big department stores and big ones that had their own, they didn't want to opt in for a long time because of the reason that you're, you know, bringing up.
00:17:19.260 - 00:17:21.360, Speaker A: I suspect we'll see similar things.
