00:00:00.170 - 00:00:55.914, Speaker A: Today I'm counting. I'm a co founder of Aura. So Aura is a protocol that will enable any size of AI model on any blockchain. So today I'm going to mainly talk about how on chain AI, oracle oao functions and how you can build an AI powered Dapp today with on chain AI Oracle. So AI have increased exponentially since the chapter moment that we have and back to 2013. You can only use some really simple CNN neural network to do some object classification, but now you can generate an image that human cannot identify, even it's real or not. And even after Sora, you can generate a video that human cannot tell it's real or not, right? So AI have become so powerful today and in aura, we want to bring this power into the blockchain, not just one, but all the blockchain.
00:00:55.914 - 00:02:00.786, Speaker A: So people have the freedom to choose whatever trend they want. But the question is how, right? Because we know that running the inference or training on blockchain is so expensive because the architecture of blockchain is like you have the same computation happen on multiple different computer in the same time, and then everybody put down the stem of approval say hey, this transaction is correct and this transaction is not. And by this mechanism it means that if you just want to do a one inference on any blockchain, it will be executed by thousands computer. The cost for that will be pretty much too high to be used by any dapp. So we propose a solution on chain AI Oracle. We can use the oracle to delegate this computation to some of Chenno to let them do the computation so it will become affordable and we need to decide a mechanism to make it become decentralized and also permissionless and censorship resist. And the most important part is like you can use the onchain AI oracle for any size AI model.
00:02:00.786 - 00:03:05.330, Speaker A: Currently we already have the stable diffusion and llama seven B on ethereum main net and here is the smart contract address. And you can go to Ora IO to check out the detail. The workflow for on chain AI Oracle is really easy and simple to be used. You don't need any SDK, you just need to initial a smart contract call from your smart contract, send a transaction with the prom and the model nomination which model you want to run this prom with into the oao smart contract. It's like how you use channeling, it's like pretty much the similar workflow. And then you send the transaction, the prom model nomination into the oil smart contract and then oil smart contract will delegate this transaction into OPML node that's pretty much Oranov Orano is built on OPML. So the workflow will be like Orano will execute the inference and then transfer the inference into a Merkle tree and then do the binary search in the Merkle tree to perform the fraud proof and then submit the verifier to the smart contract.
00:03:05.330 - 00:03:46.290, Speaker A: And then smart contract can verify the fraud proof and verify the decay proof in some system and then send the result back to the transaction initiator. And the whole workflow is really easy and string straight line, everybody can build on it today on Ethereum mainnet and so OAO is aligned. Now you can just simply build it any product with that. And the backbone technology for the OAO is called OPN. Now we have co authored with Conway and Cafe since like a year ago. And this pretty much used the optimistic way to run the machine learning. And then the most important part is the verification happened on chain.
00:03:46.290 - 00:04:27.182, Speaker A: But because doing the OP way is kind of like the most practical way, it's pretty much the best practice to bring AI model into Ethereum. But decay doesn't matter anymore. But actually it's not. We still need to use DK proof on a lot of stuff. The first thing is that once you execute the OPML for the no for the smart contract, you still want to delegate the resell in the future or delegate the resell into different L2. So ZKP will perform really important role here. So you can use the ZK oracle for aura to generate the storage proof for the OPML.
00:04:27.182 - 00:05:03.022, Speaker A: So when the inference need to be performed again, you no longer need to perform OPML because OPML is way cheaper than zkml but still pricey. It's about five to $10 the benchmark now, but the DKP for that is cheaper. So you can use DKP to delegate the resell. That's the first thing. And this is the performance essential reason why we want to dive into the OPML instead of a ZKML. Because back to like a year and 18 months ago it was like try to do research on ZKML. What we find out actually is that ZKML do not scale with the model.
00:05:03.022 - 00:06:01.680, Speaker A: So the require of the proving cost will grow exponentially according to the model size increase. So for example, if you need to prove like 1000 parameter model and the cost is like $10 unit ten, and then when you prove like 2000 parameter, the cost of that won't be 20, it will be 40 because it grow exponentially. So that's why we need some linear growth cost mechanism to do that. That's the initiation for us to open source the library and let everybody to realize this thing so that when the model size go to billion level of parameter, OPM is the only option. And in Opie, we just released the second paper yesterday. The Opie I think is the best practice for the on chain AI mechanism. So it's like Opie stands for optimistic priority preserve AI on blockchain.
00:06:01.680 - 00:06:39.644, Speaker A: So it's like performatic, practical and privacy preserve. Because in OPML the biggest problem is that first the input is not private, so everybody can send a higher transaction fee, a higher gas fee to front run your transaction. So in some defi application you don't want that happen. And the second part is like instant finalization. The zkml model normally can instant finalize the resell on blockchain, although this model are super small, like most people won't even use that. But it's still important. So the mechanism for Opie is that you want to do the ZK proof in the input layer for the neural network.
00:06:39.644 - 00:07:31.920, Speaker A: Because neural network is huge. You have multilayer for the neural network normally. So you can do the decay proof on the input layer and zk proof on the output layer and the middle part, do the op and then send the verifier to the aura no and they will know your inference is correct in your own privacy trusted no and then continue the Op inference and then submit the result back to the blockchain. So by this mechanism you'll be able to have the privacy preserve and also instant finalization for the OPML. This library, we are planning to open it open source that in the Q three this year. So because we have done so many work in the past two years, so it's the time to build the application because OL is alive on Ethereum mainet, you can do a lot of stuff with that. The first thing is the AI managed.
00:07:31.920 - 00:08:12.052, Speaker A: So pretty much like human is not incentivized enough to manage the DAO today. It's really low efficient and if you use AI to do that, it will be way higher efficient. Imagine that, right? Use AI to manage a compound so we can assess more different assets on chain to do the pounding. And then if you have the AI to do manage the Dow for makerdao, you can asset more asset to meet it as stablecoin. And that's the first usage. Have an AI driven dow can increase the capital efficiency on the current DeFi protocol drastically. And then the second usage will be the AigCft.
00:08:12.052 - 00:09:05.680, Speaker A: I think the EIP 77 is like embedding a model into an NFT so that every time you do an inference, the inference resell itself is the asset on chain so people can trade it and also sell the NFT and sell the model token. And that comes to one of the major usage for why you want on chain Oracle is that you will be able to perform the model ownership on blockchain today. And that is like everybody want a piece of OpenAI, obviously, but you cannot really buy on chain, right? So owning the model is another provide liquidity to open source model also is another important thing. Please check out aura IO and be with us. It's alive now, you can use it today. Thanks. Sir, what's the question?
00:09:05.830 - 00:09:11.052, Speaker B: I'm a little curious how you deal with sometimes generative models are non deterministic.
00:09:11.196 - 00:09:44.460, Speaker A: Yeah, good question. In OPML library, currently the one we open source, it is used based on CPU because any AI model run on CPU is deterministic. And we also have like in house version OPML, we will open source soon. That is like quantifies the model. First we utilize the library called MLGO to quantify the AI model so that any model that roll by Golang will be able to quantify immediately. And then we set up the C, and then if the C is fixed, the motorway is fixed, and then your output is deterministic.
00:09:48.160 - 00:09:55.248, Speaker B: For the OPML algorithm, can you describe more just about the mechanics at a high level, does the user have seven day?
00:09:55.414 - 00:10:35.532, Speaker A: No. Yeah, good question. And actually opnl right now do not require seven day just to block because the mechanism essentially what OPRL does because OPR is so successful, right? So the mechanism is pretty much you made a transaction into a merkle tree and then do the binary research in the merkle tree and then find out what's the difference. Right. It's the same thing, but replace the transaction into model inference trace and then you just take the model inference and cut into multiple pieces and deploy that in different level of the merkle tree and then perform the binary research in it. And then once we find out some difference in the BICO, verify it on blockchain. And that's how it works.
00:10:35.666 - 00:10:40.092, Speaker B: Thank you. Are you guys only live on Ethereum main. Net right now?
00:10:40.146 - 00:10:46.192, Speaker A: Yeah, currently. And we have planned to deploy on L2 probably in few months from now.
00:10:46.246 - 00:10:52.572, Speaker B: I'm curious why you guys chose to start with Ethereum mainet. Why not hire liquid chain?
00:10:52.716 - 00:11:16.396, Speaker A: Because I don't think it does really matter. What really does matter for a chain is the liquidity why people want to use it, right. Everybody is playing on Ethereum still most transaction. So we want to have that supported first. And also this L2, although they are van compatible, but in the upcode level they're still kind of different. For example, ZK sync. Right.
00:11:16.396 - 00:11:38.396, Speaker A: You will need to modify some mechanism there and you want to have enough tests before you deploy that. So different L2 have slightly different change and we don't want that change become a bad door bucky way for people's DF. Good everybody good? Yeah, thanks.
00:11:38.498 - 00:11:38.890, Speaker B: Thank you.
