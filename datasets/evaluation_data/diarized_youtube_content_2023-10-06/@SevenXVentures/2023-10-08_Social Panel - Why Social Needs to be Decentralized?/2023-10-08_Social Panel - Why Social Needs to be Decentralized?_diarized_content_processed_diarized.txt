00:00:00.170 - 00:00:22.872, Speaker A: And our next panel is about social. So the moderator is from seven. X is Love venture. And we have five social panelists. Suji from Mask, wilson from Cyber Connect, troy from Radon, kevin from Lifeform, and Jaden from Click. So if you're interested in social now, it's go time. Yeah.
00:00:22.872 - 00:00:26.316, Speaker A: Let's give a warm welcome to our panelists to come on the stage.
00:00:26.388 - 00:01:48.308, Speaker B: They're hi everyone. My name is Levenger, investment director of seven extensions. Today we have like five very cherished and expert in the Web Three social space. Very honored that we can invite them to attend this speech and share the insights. Social has been a very interesting topic most recently due to what has happened to friend tech and the transaction volume has been amazing. And these are all the pioneers, entrepreneurs and insiders in the space. So that's why we try to get them together and share more insights with all of us.
00:01:48.308 - 00:01:55.900, Speaker B: So we welcome them and I will let them introduce themselves from Wilson.
00:01:57.120 - 00:02:15.730, Speaker C: Hello everyone, glad to be here. I'm Wilson Wei. I'm the co founder of Cyber Connect. We're building a decentralized social network starting from providing the first ever aggregated account abstractions for login sign up. Yeah.
00:02:18.430 - 00:02:34.100, Speaker D: Everyone, my name is Troy, the co founder, Redone. We're building the infrastructure for the content layer of Web Three. And people probably know us more as a mobile app. We were building a Web Three con aggregator, mobile app. That's what we are.
00:02:41.360 - 00:03:14.884, Speaker E: Hello, Suji from Math Network. We've been doing decentralized social network since 2017. It's like a long journal. Six years. And in 2021 we launched our token and start to systematically helping funding granting the more decentralized social landscape. I think the future will be like 100 different social protocol. It will be boring if there's only like five social protocol, but it's also going to be like a compatible inter exchangeable future that everyone can talk through different protocols.
00:03:14.884 - 00:03:20.410, Speaker E: So we are kind of like building a bridge between the Web Three protocols and the Web Two. To web3.
00:03:23.440 - 00:03:34.270, Speaker F: Hello everyone. This is Kevin from lifeform. We are aiming to bring next billion users onboarding Web Three. Really thrilling to meet all your guys here. Hope you enjoy your time.
00:03:35.940 - 00:04:00.600, Speaker G: Hi guys, my name is Jaden. At Clique we built these new primitives we call Identity Oracles. And the idea is you're able to seamlessly pull web Two user behavior data in a privacy preserving way. So for example, I could prove you have at least 1000 followers on Twitter. You generate this many impressions, we push that data on chain and then you can create that value or use your existing social graph in your new Web Three social apps.
00:04:01.500 - 00:04:34.544, Speaker B: Great. Thanks for all the introductions. And I would love to start with Jaden probably because the Maya there. So today we will be discussing about why social need to be decentralized. And I will start with the first question which is what the key problems that you see in the traditional web two space, social can be solved by using blockchain technology. And what benefit that decentralization brings to social?
00:04:34.742 - 00:05:23.068, Speaker G: Yeah, that's a great question. So I think from our perspective, one of the largest problems in web two is you have a lot of these different data silos right across different social platforms. Facebook owns your data with Facebook platforms, Google with Google platforms, so on and so forth. And you're not able to interoperably and composably share and use that data, which is the main problem we actually aim to solve, right, which is as a user now you can claim your YouTube data, Twitter data, Google analytics data, chachi, PT data, you can store that with you as a value store in your wallet. From there you're able to push it onto any blockchain. Any protocol can then take that data and do compute on top of it. Which means that in the future what you're going to see is you're going to be able to build significantly more sophisticated business use cases.
00:05:23.068 - 00:05:38.310, Speaker G: Today Facebook owns your data, they use it for Facebook ads, but actually a ton more can be done with that data. Right, but those use cases are not possible because you don't have a privacy preserving composable and interoperable design, which blockchains great.
00:05:39.000 - 00:05:43.590, Speaker B: Probably like, you know, Kevin from.
00:05:49.320 - 00:06:47.550, Speaker F: Oh yeah, I agree with Jaden's idea besides about this also, I think that privacy and security also is a very big issue and also maybe a very huge improvement, which can web3 be done and do the web two data? From my side, I used to work in tensor boards. We have faced a problem like when you do some discussion on the centralized platform, when you have some debate or you have some pros and cons, you have the power to shut down all the debate and say, okay, we shut down this and we give you a lose to some part. But actually in the web3 part, I think it's a value network. So if you have them debate or you have some social issue, you can use some web3 power to leverage it and make it maybe more privacy and more security. It'd be great.
00:06:48.720 - 00:06:50.204, Speaker B: Okay, got it.
00:06:50.402 - 00:07:44.988, Speaker E: I think if decentralized social network is working, I mean, people don't really want to switch to decentralized one. But the problem is the centralized social network is not working. The people's interaction activity is not bounded by nation border. You can have foreign friends, you can have many friends, you have friends from even like alien friend, like boss friend, AI friend, right. But right now the centralized social network basically limited the every social network, have a base, have a home base like rooted in a nation, state, country, and eventually it will intervene in the social network, stop people forming different kind of groups, political party, and use other means to prevent them to grow naturally. I think that's the time those platforms will eventually trade off. They say oh we have to go IPO, we have to earn money.
00:07:44.988 - 00:08:41.920, Speaker E: So we do listen to the nation state government and we do close some functionalities. For example you cannot really even Twitter have the tip functionality. You cannot really tip any user from any other country. You have to go through the KYC process and even most of the social network they do have the capability to have anonymous users but you have to have your cell phone to log in that's enforced some kind of KYC. I think that's a problem. It's not because of the technology need to be 100% decentralized, it's just saying that the regulator and nation state government is chasing relentlessly that we have run away from them into a shelter using a decentralized technology they cannot infiltrate. That's a place that eventually we can have our own unique innovation and the innovations like those blueprint already out there.
00:08:41.920 - 00:08:53.988, Speaker E: We already have the idea of how Twitter can be decentralized, how WeChat can be decentralized just within the old boundary you cannot do that. So I think that's why we need decentralized it got it.
00:08:54.074 - 00:09:38.850, Speaker B: I completely agree. I'm a firm believer of food decentralization, but there is still a little bit debate of whether because you just mentioned like KYC kind of stuff which also is going on to be a big hurdle for decentralized social network. Then how you see probably the growth pass or the legislation attitude towards those decentralized social apps. Or you think it's not there yet. It's probably maybe like three years later or five years later that we talk about it.
00:09:40.600 - 00:10:40.256, Speaker E: I think it's going to be very tough question. Honestly, the whole industry, the whole Crypto Westri whatever industry we refer the Cyberspace as a new continent. We always say that oh we took the mayflower we sell to the new continent. Well that's always but if you really look into the historical comparison here the American funding father don't really have the freedom by granted it's tough revolution involving many different parties involving them in different powers for example we always think like oh there's several really great privacy preserving centralized social network based in the US. For example like signal but again signal have to use your mobile phone it's Siami KYC. There's more active user from Asia. There's more active user from Asia.
00:10:40.256 - 00:11:20.180, Speaker E: They're using all different kind of telegram these kind of cool social networks. It feels like when the Americans get independent the royal France is fighting with the British empire and they don't like each other and what happened is the royal friends send money and troops to help the American get independence. I think that's what happened in Hong Kong and Singapore. I think a lot of people here not really say hey we're for the freedom. They say hey we're for the money. We just hate the other part. Then we send more engineers basically troops in this field and we start to build a thing and eventually get independence.
00:11:20.180 - 00:12:04.364, Speaker E: I think one core factor, one core parameter is the percentage of the GDP that's happened in the cyberspace or percentage of conversation happened in the cyberspace. Even I have friends all over the country right now. I think my personal favorite social network is Telegram and then Twitter. I think eventually you're going to change into a more decentralized one. I have no idea which one I'm going to win, but I'm probably going to be multiple winner. And that time all the transactions will be likely be done on that separate space, that social network, and then the capability of taxing people will be basically given out by the nation state government. That time we can start to bargain.
00:12:04.364 - 00:12:08.960, Speaker E: Right now, there's nothing to bargain because like, oh, we're going to tax you, we're going to just pass a law.
00:12:09.030 - 00:12:09.360, Speaker B: Okay.
00:12:09.430 - 00:12:24.372, Speaker E: Yeah. You have to make them feel painful. Say, hey, we lose huge tax ourselves, we lose a huge amount of billionaires. They went to the new cyberspace. That's the time you can start to bargain and say, oh, okay, what if you guys have a new law? We move back a little bit.
00:12:24.426 - 00:12:27.610, Speaker B: Yeah. By the time it's going to be a happy problem, right?
00:12:28.380 - 00:12:35.052, Speaker E: Yeah. It can take many years, but this industry is only ten year old.
00:12:35.186 - 00:12:36.540, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, agree.
00:12:36.610 - 00:12:37.656, Speaker E: Quite optimistic.
00:12:37.768 - 00:12:39.230, Speaker B: Okay, got it.
00:12:41.440 - 00:13:21.736, Speaker D: Yeah. I want to add up on a little bit nude perspective. I think content consumption or content delivery process or content curation process is a big problem in traditional social platforms. So traditional social network like Facebook or Twitter, they under the spotlight of manipulating fake news or manipulating how people seeing everything. I read the article the other day, like, Elon Musk was thinking about open source, the ranking algorithm on Twitter to explain to people why you're seeing this, and they were trying to make different versions of that. People can choose and tweak around that. So there were some initiative from him to doing that, but it doesn't actually work out.
00:13:21.736 - 00:13:40.416, Speaker D: And I think that is probably he also think this is a big problem for Twitter as well. Try to solve why you're seeing this, but it's very difficult because the algorithm itself is a black box. It's a core problem. And I think in web3, we can probably build something better here. There are two directions here I can think of.
00:13:40.518 - 00:13:40.832, Speaker E: First.
00:13:40.886 - 00:14:17.756, Speaker D: One, we can build something like a ZK ranking, like a layer on that, and we can open source using smart contract or zkn computation nodes into that, so you can explain why you're seeing that. All the computation can be explained, can be verified. And a different solution is like, we don't use machine learning or this kind of black box solutions. We use our community to curate and pick the article you're seeing. So we test it out on Readon. We're building a stake to vote, like a tokenomics protocol allow users to vote on content they like. And I think our community like that.
00:14:17.756 - 00:14:27.436, Speaker D: Right now, on a daily basis, thousands of users are voting on content they like and picking the list you should read on a daily basis on different topics.
00:14:27.548 - 00:14:28.400, Speaker B: Got it.
00:14:28.550 - 00:14:30.032, Speaker D: Maybe we can try it out.
00:14:30.086 - 00:14:53.770, Speaker B: Okay, got it. So it's basically increase the user interaction. Okay, got it. What key problems that you see in the traditional web? Two social can be solved by using blockchain technology.
00:14:55.100 - 00:16:51.020, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they cover up pretty much everything interoperability composability a little bit about regulation and how potentially a decentralized structure for collaboration could help to increase the overall efficiency of, for example, curating content or in another sense creating content. Right, so I think other than that, maybe from another two different angles. One, it's like how fundamentally it could be different when you have a distributed system essentially owned by a large group of users or creators or contributors to the platform instead of a platform that is owned by a small group of people or corporation. And I think Elon Musk is a very special case in a way that he's not trying to make money out of Twitter, which is not normal for any kind of business to run. And therefore we see a whole lot different policy and things that he did it in the way that it could be never imagined by any public or profit driven companies. But we couldn't use that one specific case to say okay, we solved the problem of monopoly or things. As long as we still have this long term conflict of interest between platform and users because of the platform have control over all those data and other users on it and they have a conflict interest again, the user and the creators, they are trying to maximize their own profits.
00:16:51.020 - 00:16:59.436, Speaker C: Ultimately the best thing to happen unless all the company, all the platforms are running nonprofit.
00:16:59.628 - 00:17:50.210, Speaker B: Got it. Thanks. You actually bring that up. It comes down to my next question because you bring up like interoperability and composability is so important and people love saying about it in DeFi we can see that level of interoperability happens on the asset interoperability on different protocols, on different chains. While in gaming we probably may foresee one game items in one game and that can be used as item B in the other game. From your perspective, what kind of interoperability that you see in social, decentralized social and at what level?
00:17:51.140 - 00:19:07.530, Speaker C: Well, a lot. And that's exactly why Cyber Connect came up with the first concept of decentralized social grab protocol. Yeah, I'll give you a couple of example. For example, if anyone here is familiar with login with WeChat nowadays or login with Facebook like a decade ago, users are actually able to log in into different games or other social use cases using their existing established social graph like friends, the people they follow, and also some of the status that they establish. So bringing your friends to other use cases could be one very solid use case of interoperability and also that could help the third party app to bootstrap so much better. And therefore it could provide the hope to break through this whole update that monopoly thing to actually create a much better environment for startups. And some other example would be like reputation for example, nowadays we saw a lot of fake profiles on Twitter, LinkedIn and people claiming who they're not and trying to scam people around.
00:19:07.530 - 00:19:41.110, Speaker C: So if we have this on chain reputation system that people can actually track and verify everything they claim to be that status since it's on chain and it's living within your Cyber account, when the next time you use your Cyber account to log in into other apps you don't have to somehow verify again and again. You don't have to explain yourself for a thousand times and say okay, I'm the co founder of Cyber Connect, things like that. So those are the two. Very quick example, monetization would be number three, but I'll live it.
00:19:41.560 - 00:19:46.336, Speaker B: Okay. Probably give to Troy.
00:19:46.528 - 00:19:47.270, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:19:49.640 - 00:20:31.520, Speaker D: So the question was yeah, the interpretability yeah. So I think content is actually one good example. For example, right now the norm is we post a tweet on Twitter, I post a photo on Instagram and so the content actually lived on this traditional platforms. It's more like appendix or something like connected to my actions on this specific social networks. But I think probably a better norm is I post or create a content to a protocol. Then I give accessibility control to different channels and they can choose to help me to promote to different channels. In that case, there are only one piece of content.
00:20:31.520 - 00:21:07.440, Speaker D: I fully own a content. The content doesn't belong to certain platforms. I think if we kind of have that norm, it's probably more fair to the content creator and there are a lot of things can happen, for example copyright or accessibility control or revenue models on accountant. This can be implemented based on the shared component of the content protocol. Then different channels can use this kind of the shared component of that. So I think that is some kind of composability on the content layer that Redone would try to build.
00:21:07.590 - 00:21:30.144, Speaker B: Got it. But do you find the ownership of certain contents? Users might think it quite important, like the owning a piece of content that I have on a social decentralized social network. Do you think it's really important for the users?
00:21:30.272 - 00:22:06.524, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the ownership of account is very different with ownership of assets. For example, accountant is only a piece of information. Once account is public, it's already there, everybody knows it. You actually lose the ownership because content is not kind of a fixed or finite assets. Actually there's no ownership of the content. We only have copyright something along that with the content. Yesterday I was talking with Tom from team, they were building like what they call UDL, a universal data license protocol.
00:22:06.524 - 00:22:28.520, Speaker D: So I think it's a super cool idea. And then we share some vision here and I think it will fit what we try to build as giving accessibility control to a unique unit. So you have to specify the different terms you kind of apply to the use case of the content. So it's very different, like NFT or other thing like just owning.
00:22:29.100 - 00:22:30.232, Speaker B: Got it, got it.
00:22:30.286 - 00:23:28.472, Speaker E: So to suji, I mean, if we look top down, the largest social network out there is like Facebook and Twitter. And if you count the Im Ying, it will be like Telegram, WeChat line Cacao WhatsApp? It's like another Facebook family thing. So that's going to be the web, two big ones. Right, then from that perspective, we look top down. The largest one is probably Madstown have like few million mau, then Blue Sky support by Jet Dossi have around 800K user but a lot of more potential. And Master once reached like few million user and few million mau. But now it's like a little bit in a problem with more trade off with centralization or user, better UIUX, then it comes to the more decentralized one, like cyber connections for caster, et cetera, et cetera.
00:23:28.472 - 00:24:17.796, Speaker E: That's all about like several hundred K user, right? The funny thing is if you look or these relatively decentralized solution, they're not even compatible to each other. Like, okay, just tell a newbie, tell a non crypto newbie, hey, get a wallet and this guy get a wallet. Then just say, hey, tweet something, post something. Yeah, I post something on Oster. Can you use Lance to reply me? No, because it's different key, but honestly, it's the same key, it's the same curve. Even the VIP standard for memory words, 24 word system, the user gets like, oh, what is the same 24 word? But you can't reply me what happened? I think the problem is there's so many different internal fighting within the industry. Everyone try to be, hey, I'm the decentralized trader, I'm the Facebook killer.
00:24:17.796 - 00:24:38.108, Speaker E: Just like I remember 2018 and there's like 20 ECM killer now. They all switch to layer two, layer three. I think the same thing can happen. No one really wants to kill Twitter as a public square. Maybe we want to kill Twitter as a private company that's doing some evil thing. Maybe we want to kill Facebook. There's many censorship.
00:24:38.284 - 00:24:39.250, Speaker B: I love you.
00:24:39.940 - 00:25:07.564, Speaker E: Yeah, we should preserve the square, public square, then somehow connect everything on top of it. So that's what we're doing. I think in the next five years, let's say maybe in the next bull run, when seven X doing another panel. Here we are, a Facebook Twitter layer three. I think that's better. Honestly better. Like all the ethereum killers switch to the EVM compatible layer two, layer three, and they become a family I think that's better.
00:25:07.564 - 00:25:19.484, Speaker E: Now it's like people don't talk to each other. That's the best thing. I think if that problem didn't solve, users just getting confused, okay, ten decentralized social network out there, I better just use Twitter.
00:25:19.532 - 00:25:36.500, Speaker B: Okay, but do you find like, because social apps can build on different blockchains, right? And do you find it's still going to be a siloed environment? Even they come to the blockchain.
00:25:38.200 - 00:26:12.976, Speaker E: The human nature is like sometimes people love each other, sometimes people hate each other. You can't force those people who hate each other to stay in the same room. They're just going to fight. And you either just admit there's fight or you say, oh, I charge you $5 for fight inside my room. You just don't pretend the fight doesn't exist. So the problem we see the centralized social network after the Donald Trump ban is like, sometimes they pretend there's no fight and they cannot monetize the fight. Okay, so that's a problem.
00:26:12.976 - 00:26:33.837, Speaker E: And I think if we able to connect all the decentralized social network together and just say, hey, we preserve the culture and preserve the Twitter public square, we can say, hey, we are the Twitter. There three there too. We're the Twitter app. Okay. I think that's going to be much more fun. I think in next five years we're going to just all switch it.
00:26:33.837 - 00:26:34.490, Speaker B: Got it?
00:26:37.260 - 00:26:41.316, Speaker F: Yeah. As for the interoperability, actually we have the implement.
00:26:41.428 - 00:26:44.410, Speaker B: Yeah, you are doing the interoperability stuff, right?
00:26:45.260 - 00:27:23.732, Speaker F: Yeah, talk a little bit. Actually, we have implemented our own kind of the stuff. Like we develop kind of a paradigm for the unified paradigm for the identity, data, asset resource, also for the status we build for games. But actually we have an interesting finding. Actually, it occurs because of a bug all faulty due to the developers. One day the front end developer just mislink a token URL from one NFT to another. It's a very interesting finding because our users have web two users and web3 users.
00:27:23.732 - 00:27:47.260, Speaker F: The web two users are really sensitive about the appearance. Actually. One NFT is like a blue coat, the other one is like space uniform. So once the link is mistake, the web two are very and they are very annoying. That saying like, okay, you mistake my appearance, actually. But if you look at the token URL, it's the same NFT. They only messed up with the front end.
00:27:47.260 - 00:28:15.668, Speaker F: But when you log into games, actually they will come back the same. So webs users, they don't complain, they know what happens. So they just say, okay, my asset is safe, so my interoperability is safe. All my record, all my price, they will not go down. But web two users, they say, okay, give my money back as one of my space uniform, why give me a blue code? So actually after that, we have two solutions. One is that we change the URL back because it's a mistake. So we just change URL, everything will be fine.
00:28:15.668 - 00:28:39.388, Speaker F: But the web to user don't satisfy. So the best solution is that we build an NFT decks. So let them to swap their own NFTs using the decks. But you still see it's very interesting because the web user, they are more focusing on what they contribute to their own games. They contribute their money, contribute their emotion. They want to inherit. Like, okay, I spend $7,000 in one game.
00:28:39.388 - 00:29:06.072, Speaker F: I'm the leader of the community, so everyone call me the boss. When I move to a new game, I don't want to start from the zero, from the ground. I just want to say, okay, I inherit all my asset, all my reputation and start from that. I think that's a kind of a use case of the interoperability. I won't inherit my reputation and from one I want to still be the boss, not from the zero. I'm a working BYC, so I'm the boss. So that's what we want, I think.
00:29:06.072 - 00:29:09.176, Speaker F: Yeah, that's what we found from a it.
00:29:09.198 - 00:29:10.010, Speaker B: Got it.
00:29:11.580 - 00:29:11.992, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:29:12.046 - 00:29:30.050, Speaker G: So we're running out of time. I think everyone covered most of it. But I just want to bring up a very interesting example for interoperability that I've always thought of wilson mentioned reputation, right? Reputation being interoperable. We're not going to build this, but know, Suji or Wilson could incubate someone that will.
00:29:30.580 - 00:29:30.992, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:29:31.046 - 00:30:02.296, Speaker G: So the idea here is dating apps, right. Today when we use dating apps, you swipe someone. He says, I work in finance. That could mean he's an investment banker at Morgan, or it could mean he's a Djen in his mom's basement trading shitcoins every day. Right. If you build a protocol, if there is a social protocol that is meant to verify the provenance of somebody's job, right? For example, a web3 LinkedIn that actually has provenance proofs you actually work at this place, someone else could take that social profile and build a dating app on top of that.
00:30:02.318 - 00:30:02.456, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:02.478 - 00:30:15.180, Speaker G: That's an incredibly powerful use case that is not possible today. One, because you can't prove providence in social apps in web two and two, because even if you could, the integration there is permissioned, right? It's permissioned by, let's say, LinkedIn, if they were able to do that.
00:30:15.250 - 00:30:49.030, Speaker B: Correct? Yeah, very true. Very true. I do have probably a few questions that I really want to discuss with you guys, but we have really limited amount of time. So thanks today, really, thank you for attending our conference and share all the insights with all of the people who are interested in decentralized social network and so hope that we can really do something big to evolve the industry. Thank you very.
