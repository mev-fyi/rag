00:00:00.160 - 00:00:00.536, Speaker A: More fox.
00:00:00.550 - 00:00:04.850, Speaker B: Thank you. Thanks.
00:00:05.310 - 00:00:09.330, Speaker A: So, yeah, how about I start with intro to yourselves and also.
00:00:10.230 - 00:00:42.150, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I'm Eugene. I'm one of the co founders at Eclipsis Labs. We built a bunch of different things in defi companies in Iran for almost two years now. But our flagship product is Phoenix, which is a limit order book spot decks on Solana. Whole exchange is fully on chain, depending on the day, usually between number three and number ten in terms of daily spot volume, across all dexs, across all chains. And we're the only ones with profitable market makers and no incentives.
00:00:42.150 - 00:00:54.110, Speaker B: My background is originally in math, and I spent about four years in solidified product engineering. Been in crypto for three years now.
00:00:54.690 - 00:01:20.246, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. Because, like, parks in the morning, they mentioned, like, monetize their kind of new ecosystem, and they're pretty fast, so even like faster than Solana someday. So they try to say that there will be some new type of projects coming up, like on chain, fully on chain, EVM, multiple bags. Just curious, your thoughts on, like, are there possibilities of different types of XDev?
00:01:20.428 - 00:02:53.040, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the kind of thing that I'm really excited about for DeFi generally. So Phoenix today, or certainly when we were building it a year and a half ago, the only place we could put it was Solana, because it's the only place where the throughput is high enough to drive the fees, low enough to make it viable for active market makers to place and cancel quotes in the same way that they do in the traditional HFT world. And then as the supply of block space increases through more layer ones or L2s that are focused on performance, we really should see more applications show up that actually take advantage of this. So it's taken a long while for this to actually happen on Solana, where if you look at the Solana ecosystem from 2021, the vast majority of the applications that got any sort of usage there were pretty much like copy paste drops from Ethereum. And it doesn't actually make a ton of sense because, yes, the fees are a lot lower, but also you can do so much more on a less constrained compute environment, and so you don't need to copy over AavE. Maybe there's like a better, more efficient borrowing mechanism or a mechanism that the users will prefer that's only possible to build when you have the throughput and the low latency, low jitter of a high performance blockchain. And I think Monad's ecosystem development, I don't know too much about it, but they seem to be targeting some of these new use cases.
00:02:53.040 - 00:02:55.360, Speaker B: So I'm pretty excited about that.
00:02:56.700 - 00:03:14.510, Speaker A: Yeah, because you mentioned we can make some improvements based on current developer goals. Can you elaborate more on that? What kind of improvement? Because we have more speakers later about the DAX. But just curious, what do you think is the most important feature to be improved in terms of tax design right now?
00:03:15.450 - 00:04:21.916, Speaker B: Well, there's a lot of dimensions on which you can measure decentralized exchange or defi in general. One that we are really focused on is efficiency, which goes back to quality and liquidity. So when someone comes to the Dex and wants to make a trade, how much slippage are they taking? What sort of spread are they crossing? How do we enable market makers to give as tight of a spread as possible? Because their job in a world where there's multiple market makers is to compete with the other market makers to provide the best possible price or take the lowest possible edge. And that's sort of what the limit worker book model gives you, comparing to like an Amm, where it's very difficult for the LP's to compete with each other, it mostly acts together. It's not exactly true. It was true in the xy world, not quite true in concentrated liquidity world. I think in general, ways to facilitate competition between different actors is almost always good for finance.
00:04:21.916 - 00:05:22.340, Speaker B: We see this in on chain markets like on Phoenix. We also see this in off chain markets like the blockbuster market, for example, where it's relatively opaque. But the existence of a market and multiple, at least somewhat competent players means that the outcomes are relatively good, or at least they're relatively efficient. So to actually answer your question in Defi, I think there's a lot more exploration that can be done on the protocol design side, I think maybe Phoenix is a good example here where Phoenix is, I would say like not innovative in any way whatsoever. It's like a contrabase job, essentially this limited order book, which has existed in traditional finance basically since the advent of electronic markets decades ago. We added zero new features. All we did was implement it in the salon environment and put it on chain, just sort of see what happens.
00:05:22.340 - 00:05:48.860, Speaker B: There's a lot of work to be done experimenting with things like programmable liquidity. Liquidity hooks any ways, basically that we can give advantages to the market makers and disadvantage the toxic flow. If you can do that, then the market maker is going to be providing tighter spreads and it's going to be better for the retail user, which I think should be the user to be optimizing for.
00:05:49.480 - 00:06:12.150, Speaker A: Awesome. And Phoenix is already quite successful. Recently there were many improvements on the Solana ecosystem level, like, some more scaling solutions, like we have talked in the morning, like magic block, and also biodancer, et cetera. Just curious, like, what's the biggest change to things happening on Solana? And, like, how would it impact the Solana, like, for example, defi ecosystem, et cetera?
00:06:12.310 - 00:06:56.532, Speaker B: Yeah, everything is kind of in flux on Solana right now. There's a bunch of things that are happening at the same time. One of them is there's this company called Jido, which is effectively flashbots for Solana, and they build partial blocks for around 80% of the blocks. So they basically control, like, top block for about 80% of the stake. And so they have a lot of control over how this Meb game develops, basically, depending on how they decide to shape their auction. And it's kind of changing every day. And these are things that can make or break a protocol like ours.
00:06:56.532 - 00:07:39.886, Speaker B: They can make or break the profitability of a market maker depending on how the auction design ends up moving. Jump trading has been working on this thing called fire Dancer for a very long time, which is essentially a new Solana client, written from the ground up in sea. They've been working on it for quite a while now. I think this was announced at breakpoint two years ago. So they've been working on it for probably about two full years now. They seem to have most of the components kind of working. So it's like a new salon client that's highly, highly optimized, pretty much at every step.
00:07:39.886 - 00:08:34.700, Speaker B: That might be the bottleneck. They've done a lot of stuff at the networking layer, all the way down to actual execution. And if it works, and if a large enough portion of the state decides to run fire dancer, then you can imagine Solana's throughput increasing and the fees decreasing by, like, another order of magnitude, or, like, possibly more. And so the lower the fees are, the better it is for defi, the more efficient the Defi markets are going to be. And I really view the competition not as DeFi on Solana versus defi on Ethereum or versus defi on arbitram. It's more like DeFi versus finance and Defi versus Coinbase. And so anything we can do to get the infra to be as performance as possible and lower the cost is going to move us in that direction.
00:08:44.449 - 00:09:02.269, Speaker A: Yeah, just. Sorry, my mic is out of battery. Yeah, just curious, because you mentioned DeFi was finance and Coinbase, a lot of people, like, debating about SX versus DeFi. Where do you see we can achieve that future. And what's the main bottleneck here?
00:09:04.089 - 00:09:53.814, Speaker B: I think what we're already starting to see is the lines between a centralized exchange and a decentralized exchange are getting blurred. And I think this is a good thing. We're just sort of converging on this on a very similar architecture from two different sides. I think like for example, L2 s today have centralized sequencers, and they will very likely continue to have things that look like centralized sequencers, even if there's some obfuscation around that. And that's basically like a centralized exchange, except with some verifiability component on top. So there's a couple of centralized, there's a couple of exchanges that brand themselves as verifiable centralized exchanges like cube and backpack. And I don't know if they've quite gotten to the point where it's actually verifiable and trustless.
00:09:53.814 - 00:10:37.780, Speaker B: And, you know, if they really wanted to, they can't steal your money, but that's like the path that they're going towards. And I think that's also where the DeFi exchanges that are really trying to be efficient have to move in that direction as well, where instead of maximizing for decentralization, you maximize for efficiency and then pick like the little pieces of decentralization that are super crucial. Like, oh, we need to be censorship resistant, so we need to have some censorship resistance gadget in there somewhere. It doesn't mean we need to have, we need to be able to support, like, everyone around the world can have a chance to run the matching engine for 12 seconds. I just don't see where that's particularly important.
00:10:38.760 - 00:11:07.934, Speaker A: Yeah, cool. And also as our topic is the thought of on chain financial, how do you think we can bring more lucrative robotchain to on chain or like bootstrap more users? Because currently, to be honest, there are too many infrastructure projects. But pretty much everyone's trying to bring more users of chain. Just curious, your thought on the, what types of apps or what types of DeFi protocols you think will come up in the future that can attract more users from off chain world?
00:11:08.022 - 00:11:51.458, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say. I mean, there's multiple ways to look at this. So I think the least ambitious way to look at this is even within crypto, the vast majority of the trading volume happens on finance and Coinbase and OKX, all these centralized exchanges, and they dominate on chain trading by like a factor of 10%. So I think like everyone who works in DeFi should probably be embarrassed by the state of things. Like these are the users who should be the most willing to try these products, and they still just don't do it. And this is not just in terms of volume, but also number of users. And now it's a little bit unfair because centralized exchanges are the on ramp today for the vast majority of retail users.
00:11:51.458 - 00:12:24.700, Speaker B: So they're going to get the first look. But to me, what this points to is the Defi products that we have are not good enough. So we need to keep building better products on the defi side. Separately, there's this asset problem where most of the crypto assets are dogshit, and we need to either create more digital value that can get tokenized or find ways to bring meet space value on chain in some way that actually works. And I think those are both pretty difficult problems.
00:12:25.120 - 00:12:41.888, Speaker A: Yeah, pretty spicy to say we're embarrassed, but, yeah, we would love to see more progress in the future. And, yeah, I have one last question. Just curious, like, what's it just labs currently focused on and what can we expect in the future? What kind of products are coming up?
00:12:42.024 - 00:13:11.660, Speaker B: Yeah, you can expect a couple announcements from us in the not too distant future. I don't want to spoil all of them today, but of course we're working on the next version of Phoenix, which will no longer be like a copy paste job from Coinbase. Oh, and we actually have something coming out in the next couple of weeks where we've taken a detour towards the amm land and solved, I think, an old problem over there.
00:13:12.480 - 00:13:15.980, Speaker A: Got it. Can we have more details in terms of the amm?
00:13:16.520 - 00:13:17.754, Speaker B: Very soon. Very soon.
00:13:17.872 - 00:13:36.470, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Yeah, I will leave some questions to the audience. Yeah, cool. Thanks for your time. And next I will have speakers talking about Amm too, and also other. Yes, thank you.
