00:00:00.650 - 00:00:31.670, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Our panel for the gaming is going to begin. So people in the backend, please stay silent and find your seat. And for this panel, we have Xiao from HashKey Capital as the moderator and Gabby from YGG, peter from Particle Network, michael from Exterior, karaoke from Bigcraft, and Jason from IMU X. So please welcome all the guests and our panelists to come to the stage.
00:00:53.490 - 00:00:54.720, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
00:01:06.940 - 00:01:08.010, Speaker C: So we're okay.
00:01:12.000 - 00:01:52.440, Speaker D: Well, hello everyone. I'm Xiao, Xiao from Hashki Capital. And yeah, let me do some self intro first. So, we are like one of the top blockchain VC from Asia and we started to invest in crypto and blockchain space since 2015. And now we've been managing three independent funds and we've already got more than 300 portfolios. Basically, we can invest it in everything related to blockchain and apparently gaming is one of our focus. So, yeah, let's welcome our panelists here.
00:01:52.440 - 00:01:57.880, Speaker D: So would you like to do self intro first, maybe starting with Gabby.
00:01:58.300 - 00:02:16.530, Speaker C: Hi everyone. Good afternoon. My name is Gabby Dizon, co founder of Yield Guild Games, or YGG. We are a web3 gaming guild. That means we bring our Web Three game community into different blockchain games. We've also been recently developing Quest platform so that we can connect games and communities better.
00:02:18.820 - 00:02:48.508, Speaker E: Hello everyone. This is Peter from particle network. I'm the CTO and co founder. In general. What we are building is to simplify the developer experience and the user experience of Web Three. Not specifically games, but you know that the Web Three game has a very large potential. We have two products and one is we call it ZK Wallet as service.
00:02:48.508 - 00:03:13.090, Speaker E: That means we can help user on board seamlessly seamlessly with their social accounts, but also protect users privacy. And we are also building Intent Fusion protocol to transfer currently the transaction centric interaction to the Intent centric interaction. Thank you.
00:03:13.860 - 00:03:28.730, Speaker F: Hi everyone. I'm Carlos from Bicraft. We're a legacy Web two games investment platform. Began investing in gaming in 2016 and then crypto gaming in 2021. Currently deploying about $300 million of capital in the space.
00:03:31.830 - 00:04:00.730, Speaker B: Hey folks, Jason Swen here from Immutable. We are a set of platform tools for game builders and also for gamers, all towards the mission of mainstream adoption for games built on Web Three tech. So we started off at Starkware. Now we are off with Polygon as well. So multi roll up support writing back to Ethereum and mission aligned with a lot of folks here up on stage.
00:04:02.450 - 00:04:26.660, Speaker G: Hi everyone. I'm Michael, CEO of Exterior. Exterior is platform and a publisher for games. It's a platform for players and publisher for content partners. We also incubate our own first party games. We have several first party games, including first person shooters, strategy games, RPG games and so on.
00:04:28.250 - 00:04:56.238, Speaker D: Thank you everyone. So now I will go with our first topic. So apparently gaming is a very booming sector in Web Three, and especially from the application layer. So I would ask everyone here, how would you define a good game? So what's your expectation from a good game? Maybe start with Gabby as well.
00:04:56.404 - 00:05:32.854, Speaker C: Sure. I'll take this from a community centric perspective since this is a lot of what our work does. So we want to have our community discover many different types of games. And I think what makes Web Three games different is that they have some form of economic aspect around them powered by blockchain. So this doesn't mean it's straight play to earn like you do with a couple of clicks and you earn money immediately. There's actually different mechanics that we do. So, for example, we publish people's soul bound token achievements for stuff that they've done in game and we put it on their wallet.
00:05:32.854 - 00:06:06.820, Speaker C: That's building their web. Three reputation. We go on different questing programs with different games so that there's different things for people to do. Earn achievements, have the ability to own assets. And we also like to see games that have different coats of quote unquote jobs or roles within their game economy. So you may be a player, you may be in high end esports, you may be a content creator, you may be a moderator, you may be someone who's just like helping out with content. So we like to facilitate and enable a lot of these different roles around a game.
00:06:07.670 - 00:06:08.660, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:06:09.670 - 00:06:57.314, Speaker E: Yeah, I think this cross chain Maybe is not only related to Web Three. From my point of view, that good game. Everyone has played some game. I think maybe we don't have single way to say what is a good game because everyone have their different taste. For me, I like FPS games, but other kind of games maybe is not my favorite. But I think there are some essential parts of a good game. I think the first day is that the gameplay is very important.
00:06:57.314 - 00:07:33.834, Speaker E: It should be fun. I play game high fun. This is super important. It should have the ability to engage the user, to attract new users. And I think the second very important part is the economics in our games, not only Web Three games. The design of the economics is super important. Like we have played a lot of games, they have versions every year maybe.
00:07:33.834 - 00:08:20.174, Speaker E: And the lifecycle depends a lot on the economics design. And the third thing, I think for a good game, it should be easier for user to play. It shouldn't have a lot of barrier for users. And I think this is the key challenges for Webstery games. Right now we can have very good Web Three games with the good gameplay. But we all know that currently the Web Three games, they have the technical barriers for Web Two users. Yeah, they say.
00:08:20.174 - 00:08:22.880, Speaker E: My thoughts on the good games. Yeah.
00:08:23.250 - 00:08:28.350, Speaker D: Thank you. Carlos, maybe you share some opinion as an investor.
00:08:31.030 - 00:09:12.222, Speaker F: Let me split this in two parts so the first is what is a good game, right? And just talking about a game and not a business, I think simplistically it's a piece of entertainment that captures a user in a state of flow for an extended period of time. Usually good games transport you to a place where you forget that time is going by and you're just immersed in an activity and next thing you know, you spent a bunch of money and had some fun. Different people will have fun with different games. And maybe you'll enter that state of flow with Candy Crush. Maybe you'll enter that state of flow in Diablo. Maybe you'll enter that state of flow in Eve. Maybe the way that you enter Flow state isn't even fun as we would think of fun.
00:09:12.222 - 00:09:49.370, Speaker F: Like if you look a game like Eve, eve is not particularly fun. It's stressful and it's political and it's economic. But for those people, for those gamers, they lose track of time and they find passion and belonging in that narrative. And so a good game is a piece of entertainment that holds a user in a state of flow for an extended period of time as they engage with that world. In terms of what makes it a good investment it's a game that holds a user in a state of flow and then gets a portion of those users to part away with enough money to make it into a good business and make it profitable.
00:09:51.550 - 00:10:34.518, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely like that breakdown. Maybe I'll take a different stab at it for a good game. When I think about flow and passing time, we tend to think of it as like a core loop and it's a lot like tension relief or a dopamine release, right? Whether you're thinking about Tears of the Kingdom, for example, it's exploratory. But this idea of landing at these many puzzles you solve. You get that dopamine hit of feeling like you've cracked something or even go back to the Tetris era of building something up and having that line drop and it clears and you get that moment where it's this AHA moment. I think that's at a micro level, we try to look for those loops. We try to look for things that will capture the gamer's attention.
00:10:34.518 - 00:11:11.954, Speaker B: And loops can take on different forms, but I think depending on your niche, depending on your personality, the loop can come with like an auto battler. It could come from a dota or a league, like defeating your enemy. It could come from very small things at a micro level that require fast movements or grand strategy. It's just that loop that keeps people coming back, right? It's almost like you leave the game and you're thinking about that loop and that dopamine hit. That's what I think. Ultimately, if you break down what makes folks want to spend a lot of time in a place, it's that piece. And so when we think about good games, and good entertainment.
00:11:11.954 - 00:11:40.830, Speaker B: We're looking for that hook and we're looking for that loop. And then from a business perspective, I don't think I have anything to add in addition to what everybody's already said except that it used to be that games were one and done. And I think increasingly a good game from a business perspective is increasingly a live service that has perpetual revenue models. So that's really interesting, right? They don't really have an end date anymore like they used to and you can ship and you can iterate and iterate and iterate. So that's the two angles.
00:11:41.890 - 00:12:21.642, Speaker G: Yeah, I think everyone has said enough. So I make a conclusion very simple. A good games is a game that makes money and it's addictive. So I would say that games, some games cannot make money, can still be good games. Like Tetris is a very good game, right? But I don't think they make a lot of money. But then addictive is very important to put it in a more elegant way, is that the player will come and come again to play the game. And that is very important because this is how we measure what is a good game.
00:12:21.642 - 00:13:14.960, Speaker G: And of course, we also measure the profitability of a game. But I think more importantly is the retention of the game. Or if there is a second episode, third episode, that your players will continue to come back for more of this content or the gameplay. And I think that's really it. And obviously we are also talking about product, market fit that we have all talked about. So there are different tastes for players, different needs. Some want games to be very actionable, very exciting, some want games to be like going into a meditation and it's just like movies, someone's romantic movies, someone's action movies and then as long as it fits a particular type of people, then it's a good game.
00:13:16.290 - 00:14:07.310, Speaker D: Thanks everyone. So apparently everyone think a good game should be at least well worth you spending time on. So most people think for next generation of web Three game it should be like a precondition to have a good product or the product is also a good one in traditional world. So as a result, maybe the next generation of game should be something like web 2.5 but on top of the Web Two product. What do you think web Three can bring to the traditional world? Is it as a liquidity or is it faster to bootstrap community at the very early stage?
00:14:08.050 - 00:15:09.380, Speaker C: Yeah, so our opinion is that you use web Three not as an acquisition tool, but to deepen the engagement with your existing community. So if web Three gives you engagement and ownership of assets and for someone who want to own your assets, they should really be interested in the environment that you're building, right? Whether it's a game, virtual world, metaverse, whatever you call it, and when they start caring about that, when they want to engage further when they want to spend into the virtual economy. I think that's where ownership plays a big part. Myself, I've paid a lot of money for different games that I cared about, but I think it would have unlocked more if I had ownership of the assets. And so I don't think that blockchain really brings that much to the actual core loop of the gameplay. But when you're ready to engage further and deeper into the economy, that's when web3 plays a big part.
00:15:11.830 - 00:16:25.206, Speaker E: Yeah, I fully agree. Actually, the previous question we talked about, what is a good game? Actually, I think for web3, yeah, it should be a good game first and then it's good web3 game. So what a web3 can bring to good web two game? I want to say it's some phi or pounds. Right. But I think everyone knows that. I think behind this, it tells us the power of the web3 community and also the power of the tokenomics to traditional web two games. So I think for the next week right, every high quality games, I know that a lot of game studios, they are building really good games and they are utilizing the web3 tokenomics and also the power of the community to help to separate their games.
00:16:25.206 - 00:17:01.160, Speaker E: Because in traditional web two games, it's really hard to get acquire new users because the market is too crowded. But in web3, yeah, I think there are some new users different from web two games. So if we can utilize web3's benefits, combine this with high quality web two games, maybe you can get both uses. And this is more than what we can get from traditional web two business model of a game.
00:17:02.250 - 00:17:03.240, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:17:03.610 - 00:18:08.694, Speaker F: So when we think about great games, we think that they tend to resemble a great digital world or a digital nation. I think it's easier to imagine that framework. For example, if you have complex games like world of warcraft be even simpler games, it is a digital world that you come to care about. I think that as we reflect on the history of humans and society for thousands and thousands of years, what we have seen in the physical world is that when people have property rights and commerce rights, economies grow, people are entrepreneurial, they find things to do, they build things on top. A lot of the history of economic opening from basically the 1990s forward, if you think about the former Soviet Union was going to people and saying, hey, now you can be an entrepreneur, now you can own property. And you see a radical transformation of how people engage in the physical world and grow the physical world through property rights and through commerce rights. So for us, what crypto brings to gaming is digitally native property rights and digitally native commerce rights to digital worlds.
00:18:08.694 - 00:18:09.980, Speaker F: It's that simple.
00:18:12.030 - 00:19:10.170, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the value of web3 right now in crypto or in gaming, there's just so many really cool things it could unlock, right? We talk a lot about interoperability or we talk about bootstrapping, the cold start problem and user acquisition. We talk about better tolls so you don't have to pay distribution via centralized bodies like iOS or Android. It's all true. Many folks in the space, probably many in this room, I think we all believe it my view. I think since working at Immutable this past 18 months, I've come to really reduce my expectations on what I think will be that value for gamers. Practically, I think most gamers don't care, they just want to play a good game. And I think that AHA moment could be as simple as you playing a game and instead of that being locked behind, that's money sunk forever.
00:19:10.170 - 00:19:51.434, Speaker B: It's like there's some way, very simply for me to turn my love for a game and then when I move on to a new title to buy a case of beer or really easily get a pizza. Just like that idea of on and off ramps, like real worlds, digital worlds combining with such a frictionless way. What we're really talking about is open versus closed there. But I wonder if that might just be the first thing that captures people's imaginations is oh, I don't know, I can do that before without violating the terms of service and had to sell it on Craigslist or Ebay. I actually just press this button and odly, I can buy a pizza with it. It's those little things. I think the future is really bright because there's so much possibility baked into the technology.
00:19:51.434 - 00:20:18.600, Speaker B: But I think the path to get there is going to be these small little Eureka moments that we can provide to the end user. We are often right now for game developers gated by the practical bear market realities of surviving to a game launch and the technical hurdles required to get that game on chain. That tends to be the thing that most of games struggle behind right now and hopefully we can get over that and get those small Eureka moments along the way.
00:20:21.290 - 00:21:48.814, Speaker G: Adding to that, of course, I agree with many of the viewpoints of our guests here. Adding to that also in a summary way is that I think games that digital ownership is important can be made into web free game. But what kind of game that digital ownership is important? I think there are at least two or three ways to look at it. One is that games that are high stake, for example, a competitive game, that I might lose my weapons, I might lose my army or things like that, those are high stakes games, right? And then digital ownership becomes important and at the same time games that is multiplayer with a digital economy, that when I own a property that is important, that can be rented, that can be used for other purposes, for other players, then that is important. Then digital ownership becomes important and blockchain or web3 becomes important. And of course there are other games extending to that. There are also other games that for example, like the multiplayer game that we do in web two, there are players who want to become kings, there are players who want to just to build armies and also there are players who organize the alliances and so on and so forth.
00:21:48.814 - 00:22:01.240, Speaker G: And that all makes digital ownership becomes more important and some of them might still want to earn some money, which makes sense if there is a whole economy there.
00:22:02.490 - 00:22:39.520, Speaker D: Thank you. Well, the next question would be some individual questions because everyone sits in a unique position of the whole industry. So first I want to start with Gabby so we can see that we may in a gap of two generation of games. So most of the sophisticated products are still in development, but existing games are not active as before. So what can guild do at this moment and what kind of value you can bring to your members?
00:22:39.890 - 00:23:36.238, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think guilds have had to pivot a lot in the last year and a half. And if you look at guilds, what are they? They're like the small to medium enterprises of web3. They're groups of people that want to do stuff in web3, whether it's playing a game, being involved in a dow, playing around in DFI, and the business model of axio infinity kind of made it easy for people. To basically make money two years ago, especially in an environment where there was a lot of new money coming in and a lot of other games actually copied that model as well. And now most of the games that we talk to under development have different economic systems that don't make it easy for players to earn. You have to prove that you have contribution into the economy and there's other ways that you can reward people. It could be via recognition, via status.
00:23:36.238 - 00:24:20.274, Speaker C: So our guild is still around, we still have a core community that is very interested in exploring the concepts within web Three games. They know that there's not a lot of money to be earned now, but they're actually stacking reputation, especially within the questing program. We have a community questing program called Gap or guild advancement program that works with different games, issues their own quests. And our community actually controls which games to partner with what the quests are. And for those that finish with quest, we give them soul mount token achievements for their reputation. So we've seen a lot of engagement in that. There's almost 3000 players in the current season doing that and now we're recruiting guilds from other games to take part of that as well.
00:24:20.274 - 00:24:36.200, Speaker C: So I would say that guilds are alive and well. Those players that were there mostly to make money in the short term have left or doing other things. But I think the guild as a concept is here to stay because it's basically a collection of people that want to do something together.
00:24:36.650 - 00:25:00.960, Speaker D: Yeah. Thank you. And next question for Peter. So, could you share some insights from a user side? Because you're building a tooling layer. So what kind of pain points do you see from users? And I know you just launched your V Two last night. So how will you solve this problem with your V Two products?
00:25:01.570 - 00:26:06.954, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. Actually, before we start Particle Network, we are a game studio. We have successfully launched several games across the world in the world market. And definitely we know the challenges not only for a Web Three game, but also for a Web Two game to be successful, to get new users and finally to get profit. I think every game developer, if they have the experience, they know the importance of the tools to support the life circle of their game. Right? They have to do a lot of testing, some A B testing. They have to use a lot of data and also a lot of analysis tools.
00:26:06.954 - 00:27:54.280, Speaker E: From my experience, we pay a lot of attention on the funeral side, right? We need to know the overall conversion rate of the registration, some levels, how user play your game or some features. Do we like it or not like it? We rely on data and then we start to want to bring these kind of things, the tools to Web Three. Because we found that in Webstery area such intelligence tools of some necessary common functionalities haven't been provided to the developers. And we all know that if we have the modular SDKs for developers, this will definitely give the market more good Webstery games. So we started from solving the login issue because in Webstery, every time the new user without a Webster wallet, when he wants to play the game, he has to download unseparated Webster wallet application in the browser. He has to download extension, right? The experience is quite strange for the user because when he plays any Web Two games, no such precise. This is very weird for them and also the sighting precise is quite complex for them to understand.
00:27:54.280 - 00:28:55.962, Speaker E: We provide the social logging feature plus our MPC TSS technology to provide the seedless onboarding experience, just like any Web Two games and also the sector scene for the user, the whole app circle, the conversion rate. The second thing is about the unramp, right? You just need to get the crypto tokens to do the interactions with your game. So we provide the unramp features and yeah, we are also trying to solve some the underlying barriers for users. So this is the virtue of Particle Network we are building. So we want to solve the privacy issues, we want to improve the efficiency of user interacting with the blockchain. So we have the ZK Walletized service product. And we also have General Intent Fusion protocol to help user only.
00:28:55.962 - 00:29:03.520, Speaker E: They need to express the intent and also for developers, they also don't have a better use experience.
00:29:05.170 - 00:29:34.950, Speaker D: Thank you and congratulations on the V Two launching and for Carlos, I know Bigcroft has a very diversified gaming portfolio. So would you like to share your investment thesis towards content provider and gaming platform? Maybe the timing and when to invest in content and when to invest it in gaming platforms?
00:29:35.290 - 00:30:30.370, Speaker F: Sure. We've been investing in games since 2016 and the way that we approach web3 gaming is strongly rooted in our experience in Web Two gaming. We're primarily looking for developers that have shipped games zero to one because we think that making games is very hard. We are also prepared to fund games that will take four years to come out. The best demo that I got recently, or not the best one, but certainly like one of the best demos that we got recently was a demo for a game that will still take two years to get finished. And just yesterday I got another great demo from a portfolio company and that's going to take one year to get finished. For us, taking time to make a great game is perfectly acceptable, especially if you're trying to make the games that, as Michael says, digital ownership are important.
00:30:30.370 - 00:31:40.238, Speaker F: Usually casual games can be a lot quicker to make, but usually casual games are casual and the casual consumer is less likely to be looking for digital ownership. In terms of the timing of when to invest in platforms or say, when to invest in infrastructure versus when to invest in content, we today are skewed 70% towards content, 30% towards infrastructure. The reason for that is, in our opinion, a lot of people are trying to invest in infrastructure because they want diversification. But when it comes to diversification, when there are not a lot of games getting funded and you think about how many great games will exist with Web Three components in one or two years, there's just not going to be a lot of them. And usually infrastructure companies needs dozens or hundreds of clients to make sense. And so in our view, a lot of the people that think that they'll be diversified won't be diversified because they'll be competing for a small number of games between a bunch of business models that need a lot of numbers to begin with. Where we do choose to invest in infrastructure, we focus on problems that our portfolio has today.
00:31:40.238 - 00:32:19.340, Speaker F: And so, for example, user acquisition. A lot of our portfolio wants to know how to acquire users better in Web Two or Web Three. So we focus on that digital identity, anti, civil protection, we guide our infrastructure investments around current problems of a portfolio so that we can immediately help both our portfolio solve the problems, but also the infrastructure companies that we invest in go to market faster. We would expect that maybe over time we'll skew closer to 50 50 infrastructure and content, which is what our web Two funds split at. But for right now, we're excited to just keep backing content or not just content, but more content.
00:32:20.190 - 00:32:51.270, Speaker D: Yeah. Thank you. Very impressive. Well, for Jason, I would ask a little bit challenging question to you. So we can see that a lot of layer one or layer two ecosystem, they all collaborate with top gaming studios. So I know you are also doing that. So what kind of value add you can provide or what's your advantage in terms of attracting studios?
00:32:51.850 - 00:33:36.498, Speaker B: Yeah, lovely question. Straight on the think, you know, we have a joke admutable. It's like friends don't let friends build blockchains. That's not a knock on blockchains, by the way, because I think there's just some wonderful set of work that's being done there. But I think if you're talking about games, right, carlos was just saying it's hard to build a game. It's like really hard to build a game and the path to get there and the developer friction that exists today in trying to interact with some of the technology we're trying to bring to mass market, it's really high. And so what we try to do at Immutable is just make that as dead simple as possible in a way that developers can understand.
00:33:36.498 - 00:34:02.614, Speaker B: So it's like, yeah, don't interact with a smart contract. We'll deal with that for you. Just call these rest APIs if you want to mint something. Like all the features that people think about, inventory management, trading, primitives, like all the stuff that comprises the mechanics of a game's design, that difficulty gets abstracted away. And that's what we're on that mission on. And we think of the same thing for gamers, by the way, right. It's this two sides of the equation.
00:34:02.614 - 00:34:47.820, Speaker B: You have to help the games get to market and survive and make sure they don't Outburn themselves into oblivion. And then on the gamer side, you have to make sure once that game is out to market that it gets found. So there's a discoverability problem that they onboard. I mean, your bar right now is a search term in the iOS store and a double right click of your thumb and it's like 63 seconds from wanting to play something to downloading it and being in the game. That's a really high threshold. And so we've got a lot of work to do and in my opinion, humble. We got a lot which even for us at Immutable, we just got a road that I want to challenge us to make sure that we keep that goal in mind because we got to get as close to that as possible to get mainstream adoption of games with Web three tech.
00:34:48.590 - 00:35:25.400, Speaker D: Thank you. Yeah. And for Michael, I know you've been working in traditional gaming industry for very long time, so yeah, we observe. That in Web Two industry, most of the gaming studio or content provider, they tend to publish their products by themselves. So as a gaming publisher, do you foresee the similar situation in Web Three or what's the best way to publish a game in Web Three?
00:35:26.490 - 00:36:48.066, Speaker G: Actually, even in the Web Two traditional gaming world, there are a lot of games being published by third party companies as well. So I think the question you have is for Web Three a lot of the games started out in building a communities and if the game is good then there will be a good communities and the producer know how to manage the communities. But I think what is important even for Web Two or Web Three world there is the publisher that is really really focused on three things. One is finding the users, understanding the users and surfacing the users. Especially nowadays a lot of games are like game as a surface, so surfacing the users is very important as well. So with this it's just a division of work. The producers and the execution team will focus very much on building the games and at the same time the publisher will be very focused on understanding the users and reflect whatever they found out to the producers and also to the execution team.
00:36:48.066 - 00:37:44.180, Speaker G: And then finding the users and then also servicing the users so that the production team can be very focused on what they want to do. Is it better to have two work as one team or is it better to have third party publishers? I think both ways can be fine, but it's two very different business. So I think there are a lot of people or a lot of producers, they are very focused in the game itself and it would be better for those to find third party publisher to help them. Of course there are people who are able to do everything right, but there aren't that many people who can do that, right? I think it's actually better to focus in what they are good at.
00:37:45.030 - 00:37:58.120, Speaker D: Maybe a follow up question here. So what skill set do you think web Three gaming team should have? Maybe both product side and publishing side.
00:37:59.370 - 00:39:04.718, Speaker G: On the publishing side it's like this because for example, building a community for some producers it seems to be easy, right? But managing the community becomes more hard. I mean, in the first place, you have a good game, good idea, good graphics, good concepts. And then you have a small community, but expanding it, managing it. And the community will ask a lot of questions like, I want the game to do this and that. And it will be very difficult for some producers to manage them because some of the producer will think, oh, this is a stupid question, right? How do I answer this? Right? There will be some skill sets here and further along when the communities become more bigger or more engaged, then it's very important to find out the ways to amplify the good things and then deemplify the bad things. Right. There will always be bad words and then always be good things.
00:39:04.718 - 00:39:37.720, Speaker G: Like, for example, in World of Warcraft. Right. So it is a very old trick. You might find an Annie like a granny playing a game, 65 year old, 70 year old, and then she might have some mental problem. But then after she played a game, it fixed her mental problem. Right. It's a good story, but if it is just a normal publisher or a normal producer, he don't know how to explain the story in a good way and it might turn some good things into bad.
00:39:37.720 - 00:39:59.440, Speaker G: But a very experienced publisher will know how to make it into a good story and amplify something good. Right. So I think it's really a publisher work. I don't think it's like a normal producer can do exactly how to make it into something good. And unfortunately, some people can make it into something bad, actually.
00:40:00.530 - 00:40:25.430, Speaker D: Yeah. Thank you for sharing. All yeah. My last question would be about onchain gaming. So we can see on chain gaming is getting more and more hot. Well, getting more and more popular, and a lot of people are talking about that. So what do you think of onchain gaming? Does it have a huge potential or it has a very limited ceiling.
00:40:26.010 - 00:41:17.910, Speaker C: Okay, so I have a very specific take on this. I think that on chain gaming is where the future primitives of play will be invented. It reminds me of what CryptoKitties did in 2017, which was quite new and really exciting at that time, which really led to a lot of the development in NFTs. I don't think it's anywhere near ready for a mass market right now. And I do think that the games that are doing, call it Web 2.5 or Free to Play plus Web Three, have the job of bringing a lot of players into Web Three and discovering what the unique aspects of Web Three that are bringing to gaming. But I do think that in the future, and who knows when that might be? Five years, ten years, three years? I do think a lot of the new forms of play will be discovered via onchain gaming.
00:41:18.910 - 00:41:19.820, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:41:20.350 - 00:42:21.340, Speaker E: Yeah, I think Webstery game definitely have very high potential. And we have saw in the last circle, we have Infinity, right? It's a Web three game, but the profit is more than any Web Two game. Yeah, we are facing some challenges. Also, because I infrastructure builder, I think we can work together to solve all the challenges of the Web Three games. And I think the key point here is Web Three game, the user hides the ownership. I think this is something very important. I think this is the key for the potential of web3 games because it's totally different from any Web Two game.
00:42:22.430 - 00:42:23.014, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:42:23.072 - 00:43:03.002, Speaker F: So if we split up innovation between continuous innovation and discontinuous innovation, continuous innovation is innovation that sort of makes sense. And if you think about we have a game like World of Warcraft, we'll now have that game, have ownership and property rights, the black market will become a white market, that economy will grow. It's kind of easy to see where it goes on. Chain gaming is about discontinuous innovation. It's about something very new and fresh. And so, for example, when the iPhone comes out and it has GPS, I think we look at it and we say, hey, I don't need maps anymore. I can just turn on GPS and it'll take me wherever we have to go.
00:43:03.002 - 00:43:36.994, Speaker F: And then someone makes Uber and sends a car to your house. Right? And that's like the super shocking thing that no one expected to come after. The continuous innovation of putting GPS in phones. I don't think that today we have seen what the discontinuous innovation of onchain gaming exactly looks like. But there are two things that are important in Web, two gaming or in gaming history that I think might point us to the direction of it. One is what Jason was talking earlier about forever games. And so games have gone from being one hit.
00:43:36.994 - 00:44:23.634, Speaker F: You pay $50, you play that game, you play the next game into being live services games that last for a very long time. Anything that's built on chain by definition, should be able to last forever. And so it is infrastructure for forever games. And then the second part is a lot of the best games that we've seen have come from mods. And so Dota was a mod of World of Warcraft and League was a mod of Dota, basically. And so if you think about putting games on chain and allowing users to interact with those contracts and mod them and grow them, which is what we've seen in Dark Forest, and then having the infrastructure to have forever games, it seems like there's enough precedent with the history of gaming to tell us that there's something there. We just don't know what it looks like yet.
00:44:23.634 - 00:44:35.320, Speaker F: But I think we'll see the Uber to maps, we will have something to Eve with crypto, right? Or the World of Warcraft with crypto, which is more where Web 2.5 gaming sits today.
00:44:37.610 - 00:45:03.870, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll try to keep brief. I think on chain gaming is intellectually super interesting, but I think practically it's far away. It's hard to say what that will materialize in. I think that's sort of what you're getting across the panel. But I'm here for it. I love the idea of it, I just don't know. I think we have a lot of steps before we start to break.
00:45:03.870 - 00:45:27.400, Speaker B: We're already breaking gamers brains in many ways by being like, hey, sign up for this wallet and you actually really own this thing and you don't have to sell it in a closed marketplace. I think it's going to take a minute, and so I'm really keen to see how that materializes, but I really couldn't tell you. I think it's a lot of just like we could sit in here and have a really wonderful conversation over drinks, but practically speaking, I'm not sure what to do with it.
00:45:29.130 - 00:45:31.830, Speaker G: I actually don't know much about fuliyanching.
00:45:32.510 - 00:45:33.194, Speaker B: There you go.
00:45:33.232 - 00:45:51.306, Speaker G: I just learned it from one of the panelists in another session this lunch just now, who is working very hard on fully on chain game. I think it's the next session, right? So he's right here. So I think you can answer. He will answer better than I do. I just learning from him.
00:45:51.488 - 00:46:05.780, Speaker D: Cure all right. All right. That will be all of the topics for today and thanks every guest and hope the audience enjoying. And also thanks seven X for making putting us together.
00:46:06.870 - 00:46:07.470, Speaker B: Thanks, folks.
