00:00:00.240 - 00:00:00.780, Speaker A: First.
00:00:05.534 - 00:00:18.582, Speaker B: Okay. Hi everyone. Nice to meet everyone. So, yeah, maybe we'll just kick start the event now. A brief introduction. I'm Kirk, I'm an ecosystem manager at Particle network. And then particle will provide social login as well, as well as a service.
00:00:18.582 - 00:00:51.674, Speaker B: Mister Lee exploring into the indian space as well. So, yeah, a bit of background about the event as well. So intense. Being a very new space, I think we just decided to put together some of the leaders, founders that have been building in this space for very long. We really kind of share their knowledge and expertise. In this year, I've met a number of you guys and you're asking what is intense? So yeah, I hope that today, through the sessions today, you'll learn a bit more about intense and see maybe you'll find useful. And with that, I would like to introduce our first income to meet.
00:00:57.574 - 00:01:44.394, Speaker A: Hope everyone's well rested from last night. So today's topic is the future of defi intent from fisolver. If I can go back. Okay, it's a bit laggy. Does it want to work? So a bit background on Enso. Enso is a solver and cow swap. We also offer one unified DPi to interact with DeFi, ranging from lending, borrowing, vaults, LP's, swapping warrants, whatever it may be.
00:01:44.394 - 00:02:24.822, Speaker A: I'm Conan Houd, one of the co founders of opening. So, topics that we're going to discuss today are what intents currently look like. Intent layers, the different types of intents, and what the future of defined tents could look like. What are intents? We all ask the same question. It's a very new part of the industry, and I don't think we've really swept branch to surface of what intents could be. For me, generally speaking, on the defi aspect, intents are more going from this to this, and I don't care how to get to that end position. All of the logic is abstracted away for solvers like ourselves.
00:02:24.822 - 00:03:24.334, Speaker A: Being able to get that end result for you currently, what the intent flow looks like. If I'm a user and I have ten ETH, and I want to go into balancing position, I will submit this order onto an intent interface such as cow Uniswap X, or also one inch. Then this gets broadcasted to solvers. Solvers will then use their own solutions, whether this is arbitrage trading, dex routing, defi routing, or also using their own flow or whatever it means, as a user ultimately doesn't care. All they care about is getting to their end destination. Once this order can submitted, solvers will find their path, submit their pathing, algo their call data into the option, whoever has the most surplus and also an out for the user, then they will be selected to run on behalf of the user. Count does this validation through transaction simulations on Hinderly and also our open source simulator that you can also use.
00:03:24.334 - 00:04:11.854, Speaker A: Abby dialed in a similar trait a couple of months ago. Try to enter a balanced position better protected through cow. And this was successful. The current benefit of, let's say, where tents are if I'm a user and I want to enter into this mill on beefy before intense, I need to go to Uniswap or another swapping platform, buy my tokens, go to balancer position, deposit my tokens, take my lp, go to aura, take my LP from Aura, and then finally get to my investigation. Even though my investigation I knew what I wanted to do. I had to go to four different interfaces and do eight different transactions with intents. You don't need to do this now.
00:04:11.854 - 00:04:45.700, Speaker A: You can just specify your. The future of intents can be very broad. You can do programmable, programmable intents, you can do dial heroes, you can do claiming rewards, you can have conditional ordering and so forth. That's on the executional side. And the other side of intents is also how the interface presents and does the execution. So this could be text to text to speech dropdowns, speech to text, and so forth. Different intent types that may come.
00:04:45.700 - 00:05:34.944, Speaker A: You can have explicit tense, say from token a to token b. You can also say exit by possession on this protocol. If APY drops this percentage, move to protocol X, semi explicit exit by position under particular APY, and then creating characteristics of a protocol you want to enter. So this protocol could be accessing for more than six months as three audits, and can also generate this MPY. So it's not as explicit, but it's got characters related to what your intent should be executing. The one that I find the most interesting is not explicit. So based upon your prior interactions on chain, you can create characteristics and behavioral analysis of every single user and create autonomous agents using intents.
00:05:34.944 - 00:06:26.022, Speaker A: So everyone talks about execution. Not many people can upload the top part of intents, which is how you present it to the user. So what actions they can do, how this information is shown to the user, and then last but not least, the metadata. If a user is making a decision to be able to declare an intent, the information needs to be shown correctly, especially if you have autonomous agents executing on the individual's half based upon criteria. So for example, if I say my APY drops to 5%, then exit the possession. If you use using a centralized service and they get hijacked, the APY is shown as 20, but it's only two, then the intent will not be executed. I don't know if anyone's building this.
00:06:26.022 - 00:07:04.062, Speaker A: You just came up with this. We're not building it, but if somebody is, please reach out. You see, there needs to be a, let's say a decentralized metadata service if we're building these autonomous agents, an intense based on metadata, so that if somebody says it's 5% APY, then it gets validated across all these networks. So the user's intent does get executed properly. The other part of intents where I personally see this going is not only just tokenized position. So let's say, for example, I have USDC and I enter into three curve on curve. That's called tokenized.
00:07:04.062 - 00:07:43.146, Speaker A: I can transfer that token to my mom, my grandmother, whatever it may be. If I take that three curve token and put it into curve gauge, that's called staking, and this is associated with the address. So this is state. Right now, most intent protocols are only focused on tokenization, whereas DeFi has a lot of state transitions, such as borrowing and protocols. Staking gauges perks, leverage and so forth. State transitions are not possible keyways. You would need to hand over your private key for a solver or a solver network to act upon your behalf to be able to do this.
00:07:43.146 - 00:08:29.476, Speaker A: Which is why we need to bring a lot more smart accounts into the intended space. With smart accounts you can have executable roles to be able to execute potential particular call data to then get that in state for you. I don't believe we should be having this validation on chain. I think it should be an off chain validation, but a validator network using simulation tools, and the simulation tools you can use are tenderly and also our open source simulator. This is built in rust on top of foundry. So if anyone is building in the intense ecosystem, feel free to just use this before it has a docker image and you can run it next to explode your archive node and super perform it. We already do stick transition.
00:08:29.476 - 00:09:10.890, Speaker A: We saw this coming. So anyone who's building on smart accounts, you can actually use our API off the bat to be able to offer your users more complex defi interactions, such as lighting on liquidate. That doesn't give you a token representing your interaction borrowing, which doesn't do delegation. Some protocols do staking gauges, claiming rewards, and so forth. This is already in production team at ivborn they've done this. They combined many different actions into one transaction, and their intent was to generate as much yield for their users on the platform. This was always variable based upon them.
00:09:10.890 - 00:09:23.114, Speaker A: And third APY and let's say the infrastructure would find the most optimal route for them for this. Yeah, thank you. Very quick. But if there's any questions, let me know.
00:09:29.214 - 00:09:30.434, Speaker B: Any questions?
00:09:36.404 - 00:10:02.072, Speaker A: Basically, intent is creating like a type of a new supply chain between the wallets, the different apps, the solvers and all this thing. Where do you think the value will improve? A very good question. Not sure what you're saying to be a solver. Some solvers are profitable, especially last year. This year some aren't. The competition will push. The competition is designed in a way.
00:10:02.072 - 00:10:18.124, Speaker A: The solvers will go to the bare minimum. And maybe some solvers are already losing money on trades just to get the optics of volume. So yeah, not too sure just yet, but I know within the solver game, it's very challenging to make money.
00:10:26.664 - 00:10:30.454, Speaker B: Yeah. If no other questions, take your corner and we'll move over to our next it.
