00:00:05.120 - 00:00:07.114, Speaker A: Shimao, welcome. How are you doing, man?
00:00:07.894 - 00:00:09.834, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty good. How are you?
00:00:10.694 - 00:00:31.844, Speaker A: Good as well. Shimao is a co founder from CyberConnect and he's joining us to talk about everything web3 social and I hope also a bit of account abstraction. So, yeah, first thing, first things first, what can you tell us about your own project? What is Cyberconnect?
00:00:33.144 - 00:01:09.664, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Thank you. So Cyberconnect is a web3 social protocol. And basically it's a set of smart contract or a set of infrastructures for developers to build up their next generation of web3 production, especially social products. And meanwhile, we are building our own social products like Ling three and our unique social wallet or like cyber wallet cards. So yeah, that's what it consists of. Cyber connect right now.
00:01:10.764 - 00:01:48.204, Speaker A: Right. And well, in this podcast, like, our primary goal is to dissect what it takes to build a great web3 product. And admittedly, you guys are the first developer facing product that we've had in the podcast yet. So I think we're in for a cool conversation. In your mind, what do you think it makes you guys a great product for, obviously for developers and for the other audiences that pertain to your different projects within your product line, but yeah, what needs do you see your product solving? What do you think makes them good?
00:01:49.324 - 00:02:42.674, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I will talk this problem from two perspective. So why on the link three side and otherwise on the server wallet or like AA wallet site? So first of all, Linq three link three is tried to build a trusted web3 professional network. It uses web3 native ways, for example like attendance, batch verifiable credentials, SBTs and EAs to provide web3 organizations and person easy ways to build up their on chain presence. And all of these attestations and credentials are super interoperable and can be integrated into other projects. So that's one thing. And another thing we are actively building is like several wallets.
00:02:42.674 - 00:03:49.094, Speaker B: So cyber wallet itself is a product and also it provides aa infrastructures for other projects to use. It tries to offer a super new wallet UI experience for users. It tries to solve lots of web3 user onboarding issues that UA have, for example like transaction complexity and gas fee complexity. And we are trying to solve it using lots of very new technologies and new things. For example like intent based product design with batch transactions and ERCA 4337 paymasters to solve the gas free problems. And finally, I think cyberware itself tried to solve the hard part of key management for lots of web3 users. Yeah, I think these are two main products or main problem sets we are actively looking to or try to solve.
00:03:50.514 - 00:04:09.764, Speaker A: And, well, for the listener that may have not done too much research on cyber connect yet, that might seem like a wide array of things that you're trying to tackle all at once. So do you want to go a bit deeper into the rationale of why you're selecting these particular things? Connect the dots a little bit?
00:04:10.704 - 00:05:08.764, Speaker B: Oh yeah, sure, sure. So basically, as far as we say, the reasons, like why currently web3 social product is not so widely adopt or not like very accessible from web two years perspective. One major problems is the blockchain systems intrinsic complexity. And also like the current web3 infrastructures have its own limitations to support, for example like massive adoptions, or to support easy access from web two users perspective. So that's what we try to solve, or why we try to utilize different technologies to solve this problem. Yeah.
00:05:10.544 - 00:05:57.504, Speaker A: Okay. And well, now we're getting to the very core of the matter here, web3 social media. And obviously there are a great number of qualities that social media can bring to the table done in a web3 way, such as better payments for creators, obviously decentralized sensorless infrastructure, better in general moderation, or better incentives for users to participate and own these platforms. So I think it's very hard to contest that social media being in web3 would make it better. What else do you think has not really made it possible?
00:05:59.504 - 00:06:06.768, Speaker B: So you mean what, like unique part, web3 compared social product compared to web two?
00:06:06.896 - 00:06:18.484, Speaker A: Or I guess the question could be boiled down to why do you think we have never managed to have a web3 platform for social media actually stick?
00:06:23.464 - 00:06:54.964, Speaker B: So, so I think for web3 social products, the unique part is M said it's long term sustainable tokenomic designs. I think that's a major differentiator between web3 and web3 products. And it can be a good supporting point to build up a brand new web3 social systems for attracting new users from the web two world.
00:06:56.984 - 00:07:41.994, Speaker A: And I think in general, I feel like it's really hard to expect web3 social platforms to gather that many users when there's not really that many new people hoping onto crypto all the time. So you do need to, to address that mass market first, because before you actually attract the type of people that are interested in building sustainable social media for web3. So how do you think we can attract that kind of user? What do you think is currently missing so that those users would care to join a web3 based social platform?
00:07:42.994 - 00:08:28.554, Speaker B: Yeah, sure, sure. That's a great question. I can see different aspects to answer these questions. I think for example, number one, I would think of data privacy and ownership. So for example, web3 social platforms can give users more control over their personal data with decentralized identity systems and blockchain based data storage. Like user can decide who have access to their data, how they use like reducing the power of centralized identities to monetize your data without consent. I think that's one perspective why it can track some more users, why people care.
00:08:28.554 - 00:09:01.803, Speaker B: And the second one is about, as you mentioned before, the content monetization. So basically, web3 social platforms enable content creators to be directly rewarded for their contributions without relying on for example, advertising revenues. So cryptocurrency and blockchain based tokens can facilitate for example like micro payments, crowdfundings and other innovative monetization models. I think that is super important. Also.
00:09:03.764 - 00:10:12.924, Speaker A: Monetization is a huge one, I think, and that's even what you would often see in normal social media platforms that are just launching. They usually, what they try to do is they try to pay up creators to abandon the platform that they're currently on and just go exclusive on there so that they can bring along their audience. I think that happens a lot when there's like a new twitch competitor, you just have that kind of attraction. And I think a web3 social platform would make it more attractive or more accessible by not saying hey, come and see your favorite creator, but like we're going to pay you better as a creator no matter what because we're not the ultimate owners of the platform. And so yeah, obviously your, you have both sides, you have your own platform and you have the social graph on which other people can buy, can build their own platforms. What kind of like product trends have you embraced when it comes to building your own.
00:10:16.824 - 00:10:56.924, Speaker B: The product trends, I would say like it's more, more towards like tokenomics enable social product, especially this kind of product with tokenomics building and with decentralization concept building things, for example, like recently very popular fintech one is a very good example. Like that's kind of a trend on the web service social site, more towards this kind of, yeah, social product.
00:10:57.304 - 00:11:08.124, Speaker A: Can you tell us a bit more about how you, what did you see in frontech that you tried to sort of try to do similarly or what you, and how you went about that?
00:11:09.304 - 00:12:24.736, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think there are several good things about different tech and we are, which are like some similar thoughts or we're building towards a similar experience, I would say. So I think one thing, one like very important sense is about the first sense about the economic design, so that it kind of have a way to do the reward distribution, to reward the community members, to reward the contributors. That's one thing. And that creates a very unique and a very interesting mechanism for people to participate into normal social activities like chatting with each other, messaging or buying other people's profile or they call it keys. I think that's in general one direction to go like the economics economic side. And the second thing is I think one very important thing is to have frictionless onboarding experience for users.
00:12:24.736 - 00:13:19.904, Speaker B: For example, a friend tech tried to use social login for users to manage their cryptographic keys. I think that is one importance. So we are trying to improve all our products, Ui, Ux and also onboarding experience so that user don't have to care about too much about for example key management, about the transaction systems, about the Gatsby systems coming from blockchain system itself larger they are just more focusing on product itself and focusing on what it can provide to the web3 users compared to a normal web two products. I think these are two unique side and very interesting part.
00:13:22.004 - 00:14:23.524, Speaker A: I think one thing that friendtech did really well and that not that many people paid attention to, but I think the right people paid attention to this was the ecosystem that immediately emerged around it. So immediately you had people like opening secondary market for users keys doing all kinds of things. And in my opinion that's part of what made friendtech feel very fresh, that it was not just trying to do Reddit with money as upvotes like steam did or not really trying to do like a web3 Twitter like someone else tried to do. It really felt fresh. What kind of features do you think web3 social media platforms need to have to get popular or to actually drive more interest or to harness the capabilities of web3 a bit better.
00:14:27.284 - 00:15:15.452, Speaker B: I think one key feature is, as I mentioned before, is to have very frictionless logging method or onboarding experience. So that's maybe sounds very minor but actually not because the consistent web3 word is super different from like web two's word. So that's I think one key feature is to provide very easy logging mechanism or like onboarding experience for users to onboard to your social product first. I think that's very crucial for sure.
00:15:15.548 - 00:16:01.194, Speaker A: And I mean at particle network we would know one thing or two about that being like wallet as a service providers and social logins providers and so on. But I was referring to mostly as what makes products unique because I mean social logins are cool but no one goes to an app just because they're able to log in with their socials. Right. You need something that attracts people and it's been hard to see social platforms grow as much lately. It looks like we're stuck with the same ones plus TikTok and also everyone's trying to sort of copycat TikTok. But what do you think? Yeah, a social, a web3 social platform would need to do to actually get popular.
00:16:02.374 - 00:17:07.144, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I think one, one direction could go is to, from the content monetization channel. So probably develop a more, more ways for content creators to monetize their content easily and in various ways and. Yeah, yeah, I think because lots of users coming along with their big, they are kind of like a big fans for their, for some sort of creators or content creators. So I think it's important to attract these kind of content creators to join this community first. So that I think why like offering a better, or like different sorts of monetization channel is important.
00:17:09.184 - 00:17:43.434, Speaker A: Agree. And well before you mentioned infrastructure, and I think that's an interesting component of this, everyone sees account abstraction as being a big step forward in user experience and what we can enable for users. But what other infrastructure points do you think web3 socials need to address or has addressed that allows us to move further?
00:17:47.414 - 00:19:31.554, Speaker B: I think there are, from three perspectives in terms of these questions. There are three, I think difficulties like current infrastructures cannot support very well, so that we have to develop new set of infrastructures or protocols to better support web3 social products. So one thing is about the key management itself. We need to have better infrastructures to support users to manage their keys in safe and non custodial way. And the second is try to reduce the blockchain systems intrinsic complexity, for example like the transaction complexity and the gas fee complexity because for most of times for people to enter the web3 social products, like if like they need to care, the transaction waiting time, the gas fee payments, then it was very frustrating for first time users to use this product. And finally, I think there's current, in current landscape, there's lots of l two s, l one s and lots of isolate blockchain systems. So we need have a better infrastructures to do, for example, multi chain content management or cross chain communication so that people can do like their transactions or their interaction with products without the knowledge of underlying blockchain or underlying networks.
00:19:31.554 - 00:19:46.350, Speaker B: Yeah, I think these are three different problems or different things. The infrastructure side should have a better support to build up more accessible web.
00:19:46.382 - 00:19:52.494, Speaker A: Three social products and you're directly trying to address a bunch of these. Right?
00:19:53.994 - 00:20:12.814, Speaker B: Yeah. So we try to solve some of these problems, but I think for some difficult problems we need the corporations and efforts from the hue crypto community to build up it together.
00:20:14.174 - 00:20:15.474, Speaker A: Sorry, a few what?
00:20:17.094 - 00:20:22.074, Speaker B: To build up it together with other crypto communities.
00:20:22.734 - 00:21:06.584, Speaker A: Right. Yeah. And I think that's very critical. There's always this feeling that when you have a market search like we're experiencing right now, that that might bring new people to web3. And that's always seen as largely positive because we do need new developers, we do need new ideas in the space. We do need it to slowly creep into the mainstream. So I guess another question would be what do you think should happen this cycle in web3? What would you like to see more of?
00:21:09.844 - 00:22:28.544, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So one thing I think I feel like very interesting and a lot to say is RWA, the real world assets can be binding into cryptocurrency and can be binding utilized in the web3 world. I think that's one side. Another thing I would like to say is to say, for example, more network level abstraction in general, I'm feeling like there's too many overwhelming concepts for users to learn, like different blockchain systems, why it exists and why there's so many isolated existence there. So that I would love to say more like unique entrance for people to interact with the products instead of caring too much about different blockchains and different ecosystems and love to say more unified experience for people to interact with these systems.
00:22:29.924 - 00:23:50.474, Speaker A: And in that regard, I think we're creating something pretty similar. Particle is currently working on our omni chain account abstraction stack. And one thing that we're really interested in seeing is users being able to manage accounts in multiple chains by paying their fees with owners only one token because, yeah, currently the l two panorama is very exciting for ethereum scalability. But there comes a point where managing assets across all these chains becomes too much and where for you as a user to keep track of which assets you left in one chain, what your private keys are for that chain, what, like what tokens you need to hold to pay for gas fees, it becomes too much. And there's no, there's no universe in which web3 is a single thing in which we haven't figured out the cross chain and multi chain flows that need to be figured for that to happen. So at a product level, what else do you think needs to happen when it comes to cross chain, open chain, multi chain? I know that that's a problem. You guys are also very interested in.
00:23:53.614 - 00:24:45.088, Speaker B: Yeah, at product level. I think the recent very popular idea of intents is very interesting and I would love to say on product level. So that's. I think the interaction between people and the blockchain system may change in the future. So for now everyone knows, like open up your crypto wallet and sign some message or send out some transactions to some, somewhere like. Or like interact with some product by clicking your metamask or send out transactions. But in the future I think it could be a totally different experience on the user side when they interacting with web3 product.
00:24:45.088 - 00:25:17.364, Speaker B: For example, in more like could be interactive chat, like chatted GPT I can just enter what I need and what do I want so that there are intermediate solvers agents to help me figure out what kind of transactions I need to do and what of transactions need to what kind of different results so I can choose different routes to finish my original needs.
00:25:20.304 - 00:25:59.944, Speaker A: That's actually also pretty similar to something we've been thinking about, the intent fusion protocol. I think in general there are two ways that intents are represented in the industry. People talk about them either like as if they are basically limit or theirs in uniswap, or if they're like a more general purpose language, like I guess what we're describing here and what we both see it as. How far away do you think we are from a web3 paradigm where intents are actually at the center of everything we do?
00:26:03.844 - 00:26:39.484, Speaker B: I would say it's not that easy and it definitely takes some time to build. But one thing I want to say is it's not actually very far away from our current systems. So I'll give you an example. The intent concept is not pretty new. So in web two worlds, like the intent is everywhere. From like Google's internal systems to some open source products, the intent concept is everywhere already.
00:26:39.784 - 00:26:40.120, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:40.152 - 00:27:39.414, Speaker B: And in web3 worlds, for example, like people can argue, like ERC 437 itself is some kind of intent framework because they try to obstruct away the account logic and lots of gas payment logic so that you can build up your own account specific intent. So, and I think for the next step there could be, there will be lots of new infrastructures to support like independent loan pool or independent architectures so that they obstruct away the complexity of a transaction itself and emerge a new intent focus or purely intent based paradigm. I would say, yeah, it will take months for people to build, but it's not that far away from our current landscape.
00:27:40.474 - 00:28:32.504, Speaker A: And actually, yeah, you're right, in a big way. ERc four 3037 is getting us closer to intense in a big way. And I think like, there's always going to be something that gets you closer to intense, right? It's not like it's not yes or no, it's not black and white. You can get closer to the overall concept until at some point you do have something like a chat GPT interface that executes everything for you upon your command. Although that's even something that sounds pretty new in web two. That's like, I think if we could get to the point where the developments in web3 get close, that close to developments in web two, it means that we're doing pretty good. It means that we're actually catching up instead of so far behind.
00:28:32.504 - 00:28:42.944, Speaker A: I'm curious about what your process of developing these intent network is like. Do you want to share a bit more about that?
00:28:45.244 - 00:28:50.332, Speaker B: What's the pros to develop this intent basic framework process?
00:28:50.508 - 00:28:51.304, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:28:51.764 - 00:29:47.984, Speaker B: Okay. Okay. Yeah, I think there are different stages to develop such Internet based assistance. On the one side, we need to have so called DSL, like a domain specific language, so we can obstruct away the current transaction systems. So we have a higher obstruction to describe a problem. So instead of like say, okay, this is address, this is, I want to interact with this smart contract. We need to have a structured way to describe the problem itself so that we can have a proper scope or proper tools to intersect the problem itself.
00:29:47.984 - 00:31:08.482, Speaker B: So I think that's one thing to have abstract way to describe a problem or abstract away from the transaction system itself. And secondly, I would say we need to have a clever solver system to try to understand the problem and try to come up with a solution to execute this kind of problems. So the solver probably plays the second important part developing this kind of infrastructures. And lastly, I would say an execution platform, execution architecture is super important. For example, when you define or created a set of problems and the solver find a path to execute these problems, we need to have a very high performance and a very fair platforms like flashbauds swap. So it's independent architectures connecting to different blockchain systems. And it can guarantee privacy and fairness, because privacy is important because people cannot say what you are doing or what are you trying to achieve.
00:31:08.482 - 00:31:38.264, Speaker B: And fairness is also important, so that when the solver finds a path to solve some certain problems, everyone should have a chance to execute this kind of path or try to execute some transactions on different blockchains. And this is a critical part of building towards intense centric architecture or intensive centric systems, I would say.
00:31:39.324 - 00:32:16.804, Speaker A: Do you think when it comes to solvers, that's one area where I personally I'm not too sure how that would work because it seems like you would need to have a lot of different types of solvers, especially one solver for basically any transaction that's possible in web3. How do you see the ability to bootstrap such a large, well, such a varied type of market for solvers? Do you? Yeah, I guess. How do you think about this problem in general?
00:32:17.704 - 00:33:12.088, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. To be honest, I think it's hard as you described, especially in terms of like efficiency. And I think one thing is like as long as you have a very clear problem that defines and solver just trying to find out the routes. But it sounds like easy, but it's actually very hard. Just imagine in current defi worlds there's a lot of so called defi aggregators. What are they trying to do is kind of like a solver. They try to, when you do a swap from token a on blockchain a to token b on blockchain b, the aggregator tried to find an underlying bridge, find the underlying liquidity provider and find the underlying gas efficient way to do the token swap.
00:33:12.088 - 00:34:16.578, Speaker B: But most of these servers currently are centralized. So like you send out like API requests to decentralized servers. They tell you the decentralized routes you can execute. I think in the future it's relatively easy to bootstrap it from a centralized server first and then they offer optimized routes you can use to compare the results with other centralized servers and find and utilize the best routes you want. Instead of like from the beginning you have a fairness or you have a very open source solver marketplace. I would say issue like begin from a more efficient or more centralized way and gradually with the maturity of the whole marketplace, people can come up with the incentives to incentivize different solvers to propose their solutions to the intent.
00:34:16.706 - 00:35:20.054, Speaker A: In the case of the intent fusion protocol, yeah. Our version of tackling this problem, what we see the solution of, well, the building of the DSL itself, it's basically by expressing constraints as outputs and output and inputs. Right, input and output constraints. So one thing that I like that you mentioned that it's also true and that fits within this framework is the existence of aggregators, which are, I think aggregators are a good example of intent centric products that also are in some way solvers of problems because they, well yeah, they aggregate a bunch of solutions under this. What other types of existing products do you think can help people get closer to the idea of intent or that are already somewhat a role model for intent centric design that we can find around?
00:35:22.194 - 00:36:04.292, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. One thing I would mention is about the flashbots new, new architecture called swap. I saw people try to build cross chain orders by using swap so that they can just basically submit so called intent. And then there are different servers try to beat. Try to beat like, the transactions and try to get the rights to execute it. And it's on the Devnet or testnet. I think that's very new and very interesting.
00:36:04.292 - 00:36:14.844, Speaker B: Interesting to. To dig more. And that's probably one very good example towards Internet centric paradigm in the future.
00:36:16.704 - 00:36:51.184, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And even flashbots, you could say that it was pretty intense centric. I mean, if you try to dig into the meaning of the word, right. Like, it was definitely solving a user need in a very straightforward way. I think we're just around the time to start wrapping up. Is there anything that we missed that you wish to tell people listening this about cyber connect or about what you're building? I know that since you're building a lot of things simultaneously, there might be something that I missed.
00:36:52.124 - 00:37:43.524, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. One thing I would say is like, maybe missing is like. Although like, we are building link three, as like for example, web3, social product or social platform. And the wallet itself, it's kind of like AA wallet. But I will say we also spend a lot of time on the AA wallet itself, like obstruction design and research itself. We actually have a lot of new ideas around how to combine like cutting edge technologies with account obstruction. For example like ZK co processors to read the data online on chain, so that you can use it as a way to do social recovery on AI wallet.
00:37:43.524 - 00:38:14.344, Speaker B: And also we are exploring things like modular account design, so that people can have their embedded wallets as a sub account of their master a account. So I would just express like, separate wallet is actually very actively to pushing the boundary of ERC 437 wallets and AA wallet in general.
00:38:18.004 - 00:38:54.502, Speaker A: That's, I think the way to go around these things. In general, ERC 3037 is pretty funny, because it looks at the same time very inflexible, but it does a lot. It does give you a framework to work with to achieve this kind of thing and. Yeah, but I mean, at particle as well, we are thinking seriously and tackling the problem of getting did this gets me back at account omnichannel count abstract action. Just getting an EOA on one chain as a signer for so many chains and.
00:38:54.638 - 00:38:55.214, Speaker B: Well, yeah.
00:38:55.254 - 00:39:09.994, Speaker A: Back to the same problems we were thinking, we were talking about in the beginning. Really. Thank you very much for your time. Where can the audience find you? Where can they find your project and learn more about it?
00:39:10.614 - 00:39:16.654, Speaker B: Yeah. Just find us. Tweet her or would be great.
00:39:17.874 - 00:39:26.534, Speaker A: All right. Cyber connect on Twitter and telegram. You heard it, people. And. Well, thank you very much for, for the time and for the conversation. It's been a pleasure.
00:39:27.074 - 00:39:31.214, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you so much. Thank you for inviting me for this.
00:39:32.874 - 00:39:37.994, Speaker A: Thank you. And we'll, we'll see you next time. Keep tuning in for more episodes. Bye bye.
00:39:38.034 - 00:39:38.674, Speaker B: Sure. Thank you.
