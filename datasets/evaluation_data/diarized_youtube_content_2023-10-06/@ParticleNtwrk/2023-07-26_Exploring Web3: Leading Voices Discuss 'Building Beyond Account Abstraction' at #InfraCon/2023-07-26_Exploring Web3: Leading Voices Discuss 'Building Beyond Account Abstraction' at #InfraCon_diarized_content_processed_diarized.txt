00:00:00.400 - 00:00:05.222, Speaker A: Within account destruction. Today they're actually building something around this couple of people.
00:00:05.318 - 00:00:07.474, Speaker B: How many people have heard about account destruction?
00:00:08.094 - 00:00:24.678, Speaker A: Cool, cool. Hopefully like after like so many panels around those, those conferences. Let's start quickly so we are not going through like, what AA is or any very specific technical deep dive. I just want to like, ask our panelists a quick round of intros and.
00:00:24.686 - 00:00:25.628, Speaker B: Then we can start.
00:00:25.806 - 00:00:27.164, Speaker A: Ahmed, you can start.
00:00:28.024 - 00:00:44.524, Speaker C: Hey everyone, my name is Ahmed. I'm one of the co founders at Bioeconomy. We're here to really help developers enable them to deliver effortless experiences to their users. And essentially what we're providing is a full stack solution to account instruction. Yeah, that's a bit of us.
00:00:45.104 - 00:00:46.440, Speaker B: My name is Clem.
00:00:46.632 - 00:01:07.284, Speaker D: I'm working at safe as product lead for Safecoar. We are building tools, infrastructure and smart accounts. We are also a self custodial protocol, securing funds for daos, organizations, individuals and beyond. And we're very much looking into the AAA topic.
00:01:07.664 - 00:01:31.244, Speaker E: Hey, I'm Mirko, I'm a debra for Metamask, which you might have heard of crypto wallet. I also do a lot of community education side I really like the contraception topic and space with this Telegram channel, which I'm part of in 337 mafia. If you are not there, feel free to join. Thanks for having me.
00:01:32.824 - 00:01:46.724, Speaker B: Hey everyone, my name is Tom. I'm a product manager at the Ethereum foundation focusing on ERC 4337. And before that I co founded and was CEO of Fortis, which was a web3 provider SDK.
00:01:47.424 - 00:01:47.952, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:01:48.008 - 00:02:01.834, Speaker A: Thanks for the quick intros. Tom, let's start with you obviously see all the ecosystem flourishing around 4.27 since specific from like March 2023. What are the exciting moments that you saw around AA?
00:02:03.854 - 00:02:51.952, Speaker B: I guess it's hard to pick just one. I think like in general, when you see how much different, how many different projects you're seeing getting built around this, it's a constant feel like I have a hockey stick, that my telegram is just blowing up all the time and it's just like, it's hard to keep track. So I think that by itself is exciting. And we did see some more. I could call them like, very useful events that happened. For instance, a couple of like after March, I think it was around May or June that visa released the fact that they built their own paymasters and are researching into how they can be a part of that ecosystem. So I feel like that's pretty exciting because it shows the possibility of mainstream adoption.
00:02:51.952 - 00:03:07.568, Speaker B: And besides that, we just recently finished around, we're still waiting for the final dots to be signed and everything. But in general, there are around 18 projects that received a grant from the Ethereum foundation to build an account abstraction.
00:03:07.616 - 00:03:09.524, Speaker E: So that's also pretty exciting.
00:03:10.784 - 00:03:11.564, Speaker B: Cool.
00:03:12.004 - 00:03:44.304, Speaker E: Yeah, I've seen pretty good stuff. I was talking about the telegram, my channel before when I joined. I think we were like 80 people, probably I was number 80 or something. Now we're more than 1200 since January. So you can see really that kind of, there is a lot of people that are interested in this space that want to build cool stuff. Obviously Dom was mentioned some cool project following through a few. Alcanin recently launched something really cool with the dashboard.
00:03:44.304 - 00:04:05.588, Speaker E: Yeah, a bunch of wallets trying to do stuff with a construction metamask itself. We're doing things in the space, especially with snaps, which is like an ecosystem program can run on top of metamask with the user and build a snap that can destruction economy, of course.
00:04:05.716 - 00:04:05.980, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:06.012 - 00:04:31.694, Speaker A: Shout out to the SDK of economy. It looks like I'm moderating a panel of politician here. Anyway, everybody. No, kind of already benefits of a. I want to actually go on the other side. Like, what are the misunderstandings? Or what are the things that people don't get directly when they're thinking about AA, or the things that you think that are just misunderstandings around this space?
00:04:33.034 - 00:05:36.776, Speaker D: I mean, I actually wrote a tweet thread that was quite controversial, maybe like some time ago, about the misconceptions between AA and 4337. The DIC 4337 standard is a standard that's pushed to unify and standardize the way accounts can relay transaction onto the blockchain. And so its primary value proposition is to decentralize the relayer. And for those who don't know, the relayer allows end users to effectively have sponsored and meta transactions moving away from the gas system that EVM chains typically impose on users. So it's a very interesting value proposition. But account abstraction as a topic is exceeding, I believe, the standard. And it's much more of an industry wide kind of effort that we're currently looking into to try and improve the overall user experience and usability of web3 products.
00:05:36.776 - 00:06:05.144, Speaker D: And so behind it, you can think of network abstraction, chain abstraction, working on new authentication methods that allow those technologies to be more easily used by all sorts of parties, not just new joiners, but also existing users. Yeah, I guess that's, for me, one of the biggest misconceptions. And yeah, also AA is just not about authentication and social logins.
00:06:06.454 - 00:06:21.154, Speaker A: Ahmed, within biconomy, you guys have always been very focused on developer onboarding. What are the barriers that you see today within a writing specific SDK to this developer audience that are popping up? You want to share with the audience.
00:06:22.894 - 00:06:29.094, Speaker C: For sure. So one thing that we realized quite a lot was the fact that there.
00:06:29.134 - 00:06:29.942, Speaker D: Still needs to be a lot of.
00:06:29.958 - 00:07:03.396, Speaker C: User education or developer education on account abstraction. So maybe like collectively, right. You could just do better to make it easier for developers to understand what this is about because this is, you know, a new rc which they need to be familiar with a new transaction type as well. And just abstracting as much as that away from developers themselves make it very easy. I remember we had one, you know, one application, right. And it's fine to share, but, you know, the way they integrated the SDK was just completely wrong. It was just really funny.
00:07:03.396 - 00:07:19.932, Speaker C: It was like, you know, they, they basically enabled an NFT mint. It wasn't too many transactions, but they did an NFT mint. The transaction went into the contract, but like smart account and then they just like moved it to the end users EOA.
00:07:20.068 - 00:07:20.340, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:20.372 - 00:07:40.130, Speaker C: So it's like, what's the point of doing that? You know, it's just, you know, so they kind of just like burn extra gas for this use case. So that's something, you know, we're also, you know, trying to ensure that we just make it easier for developers to just understand how, you know, this will eventually look like.
00:07:40.162 - 00:07:40.330, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:40.362 - 00:08:22.612, Speaker C: And then the second thing is this, you know, industry wide issue that we have with eoas and so moving folks from, you know, using eoas to smart accounts, right. I think everyone, you know, predominantly maybe using safe in one way or another. And that's probably the most, that is definitely the most used smart account, but that's about it. We don't use it in our daily lives. And so if you're an existing application users who are using like, which is using EOS, for example, for them it's harder, right. Because they, for them it's easy to onboard new users, but for the existing users, how does that, how that ux look like?
00:08:22.668 - 00:08:23.124, Speaker D: Right.
00:08:23.244 - 00:08:32.052, Speaker C: But for newer applications, you know, newer consumer apps, for them it's, it's easier because there's no legacy EOS that they.
00:08:32.068 - 00:08:32.620, Speaker E: Need to think about.
00:08:32.652 - 00:08:38.464, Speaker C: So these are like initial, you know, I'd say challenges that we've seen.
00:08:39.004 - 00:08:58.354, Speaker A: Sounds good. And then this is for Tom, but for everybody that want to answer, but like, trends wise, right. This panel is all about like beyond 437, like what do you see? Like what excites you? What are the next steps and where do you see the ecosystem growing from all these next steps and ecosystem achievement that we see?
00:08:59.334 - 00:10:18.652, Speaker B: Sure. So we're back to the exciting stuff. And I will go back to Paymasters because I think part of what that enables is a really powerful user experience in addition to everything around key management, which is what we have with wallets, which is obviously very important. The abstraction of gas fees themselves opens up so many possibilities because gas fees are a huge barrier to adoption. And this, in addition to being a very powerful UX like offering, powerful UX capabilities, it's also something which is very interesting to other players in the ecosystem because in terms of the, let's say, monetization capabilities that it offers, opens up a lot of interesting possibilities because you're basically, there's some sort of relationship where the user, someone needs to pay for their gas fees. Now how is that some, like, what are they giving, you know, in response to getting those gas fees? So it could be ads, it could be someone saying, look, you pay the USDC, I'll pay the ETH, but I'll take a little bit off the top. So there's a lot of monetization capabilities there, which is very good if you want to have a robust system.
00:10:18.652 - 00:11:13.476, Speaker B: So I'm very excited about pay masters by themselves, giving a lot of financial incentives into making sure account abstraction is something that gets mainstream adoption. And in addition to that, we're just seeing so many creative uses of account abstraction. For instance, a great project that came out of East Tokyo. So it turns out that I don't know how many people know this, but in Japan around 70% of the people have an id, a government issued id that has an NFC inside that allows you to sign stuff, sign digitally. So they basically hook it up to a wallet where your government issued id is your hardware. Wallet recovery becomes a lot easier. Right now if you lose your key, they can give you, it's not going to be the same private key, but there's a way to map old keys to new keys.
00:11:13.476 - 00:11:44.790, Speaker B: So it allows you to actually have some sort of account recovery that you set up in advance. Yes, you have to trust the government in that regard. But decentralization in my eyes is not about. You don't trust anyone. No, it's, you can always choose to opt out of trusting someone so you can use that system. But if you decide it doesn't work for you, you can always say, you know what the Ramadan, I'm revoking that, you know, government id. I now want to use whatever my twelve words on a piece of paper, whatever you want.
00:11:44.790 - 00:12:20.394, Speaker B: It's all about choice. So we're seeing a lot of very creative use cases for wallets. And I can go on on different other kind of recovery mechanisms that we're seeing or other, you know, key signatures, secure enclaves. Everybody's working on making, you know, SCCP 256 R1, which is, you know, this, the fingerprint face id you have in your phone, allowing that to be your private key. And that is something that I think if we're talking about mainstream adoption, that's what people are used to. So we need to give them what they're used to and, you know, work from there and then start adding more security capabilities on top of that.
00:12:20.854 - 00:12:22.022, Speaker A: How many of you guys know what.
00:12:22.038 - 00:12:23.234, Speaker D: A P master is?
00:12:24.714 - 00:12:25.274, Speaker C: Cool.
00:12:25.354 - 00:12:49.278, Speaker A: Already debriefed audience in terms of use case. Obviously in snaps we see a lot, but for the general audience you're like, what are the use cases you want to see more? I don't know. I saw so many snaps on cloud management, guardian recoveries. But what are the use case around? Whatever you do in this ecosystem, you want to see more being developed.
00:12:49.466 - 00:13:31.562, Speaker E: Like the game space. I think there's some use case that you can kind of come up with. I've seen recently some one click minting, which I think was pretty cool, that there's so much stuff that can be done in there in addition to what Tom said. What I want to do is like what I see, it's a lot of people that focus on the client part, a lot of UI stuff. Everyone wants to build a wallet, everyone wants to be the new metamask, which more power to you if you manage to do it. But there is also so much stuff around infrastructure. Like we were missing many things and I don't see as many projects as there should be, like in this space as well.
00:13:31.562 - 00:13:35.254, Speaker E: Infrastructure, that's something that we need more of.
00:13:38.154 - 00:13:50.848, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I guess that's partly due to the fact that there's high switching costs for those teams to move away from the EOA set up and. Yeah. Any additional question? We only have two minutes left.
00:13:51.016 - 00:14:01.008, Speaker A: Okay, two minutes left. Any question from the audience while we're waiting? Like, do you see any, like, enough standardization around this ecosystem?
00:14:01.096 - 00:15:01.554, Speaker D: No, and I would have loved to have the question of what do I think about, you know, what's going to happen for the space for this year, the coming one? I think there's going to be a lot of pushes towards the standardization of modules and plugins around smart accounts. With smart accounts being like, you know, the enabler for AA. I think we're gonna see more and more initiatives to try and streamline the development of functionalities that can be directly connected to the contract, as in the account at the account level. And so, you know, at safe, obviously, we're gonna drive a few of these initiatives, but I think many projects, interestingly, are doing a lot of work right now on this topic. And so literally trying to expand the functionalities of accounts directly through other contracts that we can connect to smart accounts. So, yeah, I guess, like, the modernization of the system and of smart accounts for me is that, yeah, among the most interesting elements.
00:15:03.574 - 00:15:59.126, Speaker C: One thing that is on top of our minds is, right, so once users have, you know, a small account, maybe one chain and another chain, and you might have account recovery or some form of state. Right, like already attributed. But what if the user, of course, one of the features of account extraction, and so this whole movement is that you could easily just, you know, remove a plugin, add a plugin, right. And that could, of course, alter these smart accounts, but it won't sync very easily across chains. And so that's something that, you know, would also sort of need to, need a question at least the next six to twelve months, because at least with the different wallets, we're speaking to different clients. You know, the biggest issue is, okay, if a user has to, like, if they're, you know, changing something. Right, how would it be changed across all other chains as well? So, yeah, it's definitely like something that is top of the.
00:15:59.200 - 00:16:21.106, Speaker B: So if I can just add one more thing about monetization, which Glenn mentioned, which I think is, you're right, it's one of the more powerful things to come out of account abstraction. I see this the same way we have this interoperability between smart contracts. So you're just kind of making this more of a micro version where you're going to have this interoperability between all the different models that are going to be out there, and nobody will have.
00:16:21.130 - 00:16:22.378, Speaker C: To kind of reinvent the wheel.
00:16:22.426 - 00:16:40.502, Speaker B: Right. If you have a powerful way of social recovery and everybody's kind of using this model works, it's safe. We've been using it for two years, and it can be a snap. It could be, you know, used in different ways across the ecosystem, then, you know, we're having this effect where we're building on top of things that already exist so we can move a lot faster.
00:16:40.598 - 00:16:40.974, Speaker A: So.
00:16:41.054 - 00:16:41.574, Speaker B: Yes.
00:16:41.694 - 00:16:54.014, Speaker F: Thank you so much, everybody. I guess the mic right now is mine. If I can have you guys to stand up and take a photo, so we're kind of short on time. But thank you so much for such a.
