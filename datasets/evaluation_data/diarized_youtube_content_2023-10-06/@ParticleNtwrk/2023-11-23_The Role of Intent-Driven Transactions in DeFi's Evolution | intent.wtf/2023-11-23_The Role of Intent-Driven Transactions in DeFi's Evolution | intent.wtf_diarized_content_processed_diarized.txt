00:00:00.160 - 00:00:22.754, Speaker A: Okay, so for our next panel, we have five speakers in my seat today, so let me introduce them. So for our moderator to area Marcus, the CEO of competitive hits. Yes, you can just find one. And for next, bigger atom of one inch, as well as NR from Cardstock, corner of Enzo, as well as graph from Picasso.
00:01:08.654 - 00:01:52.394, Speaker B: Well, thanks everyone for coming on another panel this week on intents, this time about the future of intense and where things are headed. And we have great panelists from all sides of the intent ecosystem. And I'm super excited to ask questions about what the future of intents will look like and what they think. And if you want to interrupt, please feel free to do so. If you have questions or you want to follow up on something, just jump in and discussion in small room. We don't need to keep your schedule or anything. Don't be shy and let's get started.
00:01:52.394 - 00:02:22.354, Speaker B: So I don't think we need to go over the what is intense and what is an so what is essential. I think many of us probably know and if you don't, you will hear a little bit more in a second real time. I wanted to ask like each of you, what do you feel is your responsibility in the ecosystem today and going forward and how do you measure your success for yourself and for the users that you're building for.
00:02:24.254 - 00:03:15.142, Speaker C: Thanks. So just anyone don't know about the nietzsche, just want to see if there is verification. So we are top tech segregator in ecosystem different um, chains, about eight. Uh, so we got these intents. Uh, we also have linked order protocol which is quite flexible and like my opinion is kind of implementation of intents already just it's called linked orders and it's the main use case for this. So I guess talk here more regarding the measure of success, right? Uh, yes, we are best, like most of the traffic goes through our aggregator. We try to protect our users from all these challenges that goes now with NEF attacks sandwiches through protections.
00:03:15.142 - 00:03:29.374, Speaker C: So we have very similar things to our other speaker posthold for the confusion also is doing the net protection and implementation. So it looks like my opinion we do our best and now we want.
00:03:29.454 - 00:03:30.154, Speaker D: Smart.
00:03:33.144 - 00:03:42.844, Speaker C: And limit orders execution. We need some words for this. Thank you.
00:03:43.864 - 00:04:36.994, Speaker A: Hey, I'm Hannah from Casa and you are definitely the number one Dex aggregator, but not in the intense space, just to clarify. And at Kalisv, it has always been kind of at the forefront of our mission to really put the user interest first. So that's kind of how we initially came up with the design because even initially we looked in 2017 already into fragmented liquidity. And the problem of MeV already was mentioned. I think initially in 2014 for the first time, and we started to look into batch auctions as a way of how you can actually counter me. Surface reduces significantly. And that was kind of like our motivation behind building fossil.
00:04:36.994 - 00:05:36.464, Speaker A: We felt like, okay, let's create a system that allows us to protect users in the most practical and best possible way. Because navigating blockchain is already incredibly difficult. And it also offers a lot of dangers that normal users that are not deep into crypto don't know how to navigate. And the tens allow you to essentially abstract a lot of complexity away, let users just really express what they want as an outcome, and then that more professional parties take care of this and offer them the best possible execution. And it was kind of always like our motivation. And with any new feature that we are adding, we are always having in mind how can we, like, oops, the user experience for the user, how can we protect them? How can we make sure that we can offer them the best possible prices?
00:05:39.324 - 00:06:38.938, Speaker E: Hey, I'm grant, I'm the head of growth for essential, and I'd also just like to say anytime someone says essentially, mother speaking, essential is achieving pmF. So. So I think ultimately what we're trying to do is act as to some degree a unifying force in the intent space. And not just for the intent space, but just for the broader, like Defi and Dapp space in general. We're working on a bunch of infrastructure and tooling that allows applications to more seamlessly like integrate intents or better serve their users with more like simple tooling and everything to make the experience better for everyone. We're working on a bunch of different things right now. We've started to build out and actually launched at this point an ERC, ERC 7521, which we've now sort of handed off to the community to work on and share.
00:06:38.938 - 00:06:54.624, Speaker E: And so that ERC is designed with intent execution in mind. We're working on a language specific for solvers as well, called Yuri, which will make it way easier for solvers to sort of pick up and aggregate these intents. Yeah.
00:06:56.764 - 00:07:42.724, Speaker D: Hey, I'm Connor, one of the co founders of EnSo, for definition of success for us, one, offering most optimal routes as a solver of cowswap. But number two is kind of expanding this intent space. So we have a lot of smart accounts integrating our API natively to do more complex defi interactions. This API and infrastructure was created from our own problem of building one UI to interact with DeFi. So we actually realized to integrate with DeFi is incredibly complex. Thus this API was born. So for us, it's enabling other dapps cross chain bridges, let's say some intent protocols, treasury managers to integrate holistically with DeFi.
00:07:47.304 - 00:07:49.484, Speaker B: Awesome, thanks. Any follow up questions?
00:07:52.024 - 00:07:59.204, Speaker E: Yurt. Yurt. Like a yurt that you would live in. No relation.
00:08:01.264 - 00:08:02.844, Speaker B: You were living in some room.
00:08:05.304 - 00:08:06.320, Speaker C: No relation.
00:08:06.472 - 00:08:08.284, Speaker B: Well, I mean, it's hatred.
00:08:10.314 - 00:08:11.394, Speaker C: I'm living in New York.
00:08:11.474 - 00:08:16.574, Speaker E: All the solvers have to go and live in the yurt if they want to use it. So it's in the woods somewhere.
00:08:18.954 - 00:08:21.054, Speaker D: I'm not sure if solvers will do that.
00:08:21.594 - 00:08:23.214, Speaker E: That's what I'm here to find out.
00:08:25.514 - 00:08:26.290, Speaker D: For a year.
00:08:26.402 - 00:08:27.494, Speaker E: It's a nice year.
00:08:36.814 - 00:09:24.014, Speaker B: Well, what we often see is like finished solutions, like releases, new products coming up and then the relative merits systems. What I wanted to ask is like what's the recent? And these systems always change, right? I think all the solutions behind that you represent, they constantly change. Every month, every two months changes coming out. What is a recent change that you made or one that you're making right now? And what motivated that change? And what were the trade offs that you considered when you made that change? And maybe walk us through the thought process how that came about and specifically on the intent solving.
00:09:26.234 - 00:09:49.686, Speaker C: Thanks very much. Basically we now work in production. We have our EBITda per code three. Now we have to work one EBItda next version before. Here we again like we see the crucial thing is the gas efficiency. Again much more gas efficient. We say combine special smaller key orders with a general execution.
00:09:49.686 - 00:11:05.356, Speaker C: Plus we do some more advanced arbitrary execution of anything our already allows. You build intent so you have pre interaction cost interaction, so you can do a stop loss order or take profit order or tracking order. We don't actively promote it on our UI stack products, so it's available for most engineers for the end user. So now we are also thinking how to build a new version. Plus I guess we're going to promote this end product someday so that more retail users would have availability for this. That's why actually maybe we know the top first in the integration. But if you see the volumes, we'll see that like the bigger swaps go through one each, like less might be golden to the other protocols, but in our protocols we have like settlement layer with not a straight fixed price or fixed line where on our back end we can customize this quite a lot for different parts of the conditions to provide.
00:11:05.356 - 00:11:26.024, Speaker C: Really you have different price curve like price decay over the same situation. And now you can also attach chaining oracle for this. So to stop training, water behavior always blows the market or hides the market trying to find a spike on this. So it's quite the one thing that we work on.
00:11:28.004 - 00:11:35.924, Speaker B: How did you design that, for example, how did you design that curve? Like, what was the motivation? How did you go about finding what it looks like?
00:11:36.004 - 00:12:05.164, Speaker C: Yeah, basically when you try to search for something, this is a current spot price, right. And it might happen that market goes up. So you start to limit orders, highs on market, then you, okay, wait for some time. Okay, let's pipe block past. Is the thing like market movement up? No. Okay, we remember what was the market. Let's try to go about the same price as the market.
00:12:05.164 - 00:12:32.472, Speaker C: And then, okay, looks like markets go down. Let's go down to try to find execution. And this, let's say points curve is adjusted by your amount about the gas price on your chain. Sorry. Adjusted by the volatility of the payer and gas price. A lot of things that we try to do. This combined statistics, but you can build this your own through the API or through the smart contract.
00:12:32.472 - 00:13:22.914, Speaker C: You can do art three, whatever you want. Just crazy ideas. This kind of what we would say has and close to release and for the future with this intense, we think of even to build a generic DSL to cover not only like DSL, which point ends that would cover not only the limit order with all this predicates post interaction stuff, but let's say I want to do a transfer, I want to do it cross chain stuff. But it's also very hard story. But it might be not even just intel protocol, it might be even the same like protocol, not as sets of smart contracts, but a compiler for this. So this guy just says like, what is like an order there? Yeah, I think that's about now. Thank you.
00:13:22.994 - 00:13:23.654, Speaker B: Thanks.
00:13:25.854 - 00:14:18.132, Speaker A: Multiple things come to mind, but I guess what is maybe most interesting here for the audience and in terms of the intent landscape is we launched both what we call programmatic orders. It's actually very similar to what you were describing before. Basically the ability to place any order type for the future upfront with one single signing of a transaction of a message. And yeah, basically also allows DCA orders. TWAP orders are already live today. And it also allows you significantly more complex ideas such as rebalancing of your portfolios. It allows you to also come up with a very nice strategy for collaterals.
00:14:18.132 - 00:14:57.404, Speaker A: So if you, for example, have a CDP setup and you are at the verge of being under collateralized, you can automatically trigger a transaction that will rebuild. Like that will buy more collateral to ensure your position. Also the other way around, imagine your collateral ease. Ease is going up currently, so you could actually think about either reducing your collateral or taking a bigger loan out of it. So there's a bunch of options, and we also have bounties for this, for the, for this weekend, for the hackathon. So we are really excited. There's a few teams already that approached us, but they want to build on top of this.
00:14:57.404 - 00:15:48.286, Speaker A: And then something else is also that we launched cow hooks. And I think this is super relevant because it allows you to now not only have one single intent where you do a swap, but you can combine a bunch of intentions that you want to combine with each other. Right? Like if, for example, you first want to withdraw from one of your, whatever, AP positions, and then you want to do a swap, and then you want to put the token somewhere else that you want to transfer them first training. So you have a lot more composability now of what you can do. Because I think the intent space is really growing from the sense of initially it started with doing simple swaps, and now you as a user have much more flexibility in combining a bunch of different actions into one single signature.
00:15:48.470 - 00:16:05.222, Speaker B: One question on that, between programmatic. Between programmatic and orders and books. When you launched that, what surprised you? Was there some surprising use case that you didn't expect that the community came up with, or the users came up.
00:16:05.238 - 00:16:06.766, Speaker C: With or the developers came up with?
00:16:06.910 - 00:16:08.874, Speaker B: That's quite interesting, maybe to you.
00:16:11.434 - 00:17:17.920, Speaker A: I think. Let me think about it. So I wouldn't say super surprising. And we are also like, at the beginning of seeing the different use cases that are built on top one where we definitely found more so on the programmatic audits, like, actually now we are launching this advanced programmatic order framework where we had a more basic version of that already, like beginning of the year, and that fit in really, really well with Dow use cases. So essentially we had a huge trade by UNS, I think it was in February, where they were like transacted $60 million. And it kind of was like we had already like big players like whales more in mind, because it's like, of course, with intent, it allows you to, even if you have large volume trades, to have like a more secure way of doing transactions on large amounts than normal transaction signing allows you to do. But kind of just like seeing this, like quick adoption was very, was very positive surprise.
00:17:17.920 - 00:17:32.614, Speaker A: And then we had AbBA following up, doing trades across as well and some of the other bigger known dows as well. And I think there was like partially anticipated the focus to be more Wales, but then the quick adoption by major daos was like really positive.
00:17:34.714 - 00:18:01.848, Speaker C: Just add some helps. I'm not excited. The things that I mentioned post interactions basically is kind of the same. It's basically the same thing, the hook post interaction. So similar ability to cheating wonders to execute this and stuff, but also do a very good job. Thank for them for making available this for the users on the UI. So yeah, the hooks is directional.
00:18:01.848 - 00:18:04.164, Speaker C: So not to be confused consultation.
00:18:07.864 - 00:18:08.200, Speaker F: These.
00:18:08.232 - 00:19:21.624, Speaker E: Chemicals will get spicy. So one of the things that we've really been working on a lot recently is ERC 7521, introducing that to the community as like a general standard 410 xk. And so our vision is that currently the way intents are sort of all broadcast, and so it's not necessarily one singular, like cohesive ecosystem. And so there's like complications around, like if you're a solver, you need to be running like various software to like pick up each of these individual intents depending on where it's coming from, and then activating those is also fragmented as well. So with 7521, and we're doing a lot of research right now into sort of a dedicated mempool for 7521 and also just a dedicated mempool in general, but to be able to aggregate all of these transactions or, excuse me, intents, that can achieve like significantly more efficient order flow. And the more efficient order flow is, the more like these intents you can bundle, which means like better outcomes for all of the users, which ultimately just satisfies everyone's intents. And I think ultimately intents just should be satisfied, of course.
00:19:21.624 - 00:19:44.744, Speaker E: And for a user, like, if they can get their intent satisfied in a very seamless, quick way without any issues or frustrations, or having to be hyper specific about what parameters they're submitting or how exactly they want that intent executed, and they could just have it done. That will just lead to a better outcome, not only for application developers, but for users as well.
00:19:50.324 - 00:20:30.540, Speaker D: One very easy one, we improved our graphing algorithm. Some Dex aggregators were beaten between 0.7 and 1.5% now, which is great as a solver, so we get more orderful. The second one is open sourcing, a transaction simulation tool that anyone building the intents ecosystem can simulate all the intents, all the call data. And we've also layered on top kind of a DSL, so we're able to specify what state transitions, what tokens should be validated with an off chain, let's say simulator, before then it gets put on chain. This is a very different approach than having on chain validation intent.
00:20:30.540 - 00:21:20.764, Speaker D: This creates more flexibility in that regard. The last but definitely not least one is a lot of state transitions. I said it in my talk earlier, I think a lot of intents are more focused on token a to token b. Our vision is intent to a lot greater in this regard. So maybe entering 50 pools, lending, borrowing, hedging your position on ipor in one transaction. So recently we within our infrastructure supported think about we support a safe zero dev dichotomy, all four, three, seven compatible smart wallets. And we also made the compatibility with Zeo dev relayers, biconomy relayers, so you can express your intent of all your defi actions, get the call data, and then also relay it.
00:21:24.844 - 00:22:05.444, Speaker B: Thanks, we covered a lot already. Any questions? Maybe to dig a bit more deeper where because we see different approaches, and we just heard some overlapping and some differences in the approaches of how the future contains might look like what is something that is perhaps, in your opinion, missing from the discussion or misunderstood, like what is something that is not spoken about now and where maybe you think you have a different opinion to the general discourse of nonintense.
00:22:07.344 - 00:22:54.174, Speaker C: I think we cover quite a lot, just maybe some. And while we do all this overcomplication on top of limit orders, I think limit orders is the main use case. That's the one really we need to see the unique for the user. I don't know transfers from intents or whatever, but a lot of hype around this three seven. But just finding out that once we build this intense system, it becomes so complicated. It's also so application can include immediate fees, like for the execution for the relays. So all these things, it's very nice to say you have paid the guests, but then with over the complexity, you get some hidden commissions that users.
00:22:54.174 - 00:23:21.264, Speaker C: So it's still a kind of solid grain finding that still what is the heating commissions? I mean like now you need to relay to execute your intent and how much you need to pay how this price is built, right? Because now you need to see a laser scan that explains that there was a batch transaction, that was your fee, how much it was eventually charged through the protocol. It's like we need very great ux to explain users what's really going on here.
00:23:21.344 - 00:23:27.376, Speaker B: So what is something that users are not seeing that might be hidden, hidden permission events? Like what's an example of a hidden.
00:23:27.400 - 00:23:35.204, Speaker C: Permission I mean, the relay execution, right? So he like, when you execute that transaction. So it's a user don't pay for the guest.
00:23:35.244 - 00:23:35.684, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:35.804 - 00:24:05.678, Speaker C: You charge some token. Yes, you charge with a source token of destination. Token was from RXWap, so you see the different rates. So you need to see how much your gas fees in the, compared to native currency. And if you do it cross chain, intense, it's even more complicated system. So it was locked, unlocked, it was network of relays. So I would say it's really nice.
00:24:05.678 - 00:24:11.794, Speaker C: I mean, good ux challenge would be very transparent here for everyone, for the existing players. Yeah.
00:24:16.614 - 00:24:44.024, Speaker A: We go, all right. Might be a little controversial at the intent. What the fuck sounds. But I would say that intents are currently also a little bit overhyped. Like just suddenly everybody's starting to talk about intent. It's become very, very popular. And then I would say ultimately what really matters about intent is like, let's take it a little bit back to the basics, like it needs to be.
00:24:44.024 - 00:25:18.794, Speaker A: And that's where I would agree with you, like really like a more simple ux. This is ultimately where at least we were coming from, right? We want to improve the experience for users. We want to make it easier for them to do transaction management. We want this difficult, complicated part taken away from them. So now if we start building on top, like additional use cases with events, we need to make sure that we still maintain that same UX experience and don't suddenly add complexity that we were trying to remove in the first place.
00:25:21.214 - 00:26:31.424, Speaker E: I really agree with that, and I think us is definitely something that is broadly like. We as an industry continue to make more and more complex systems that allow you to take more and more complex actions, which is a good thing. However, that tends to leave a percentage of users in the dust where they just aren't necessarily able to understand or actually continue operating on chain. And I think that's a result of just this massive machine we've all created to just consume, create knowledge, and just constantly be researching cool shit. But one of the things that obviously we would think about as well is ux. And specifically, if you think of it a graph, you have a desired execution and a desired outcome. If you go into a very specific desired execution, that becomes potentially more difficult for a solver to fulfill because they have more variables to actually pick up and include and say, okay, yes, if we think of a swap, for example, if you're just swapping for 100 ETH people, please buy ETH, we need 2100.
00:26:31.424 - 00:27:20.260, Speaker E: But if you and 50 think of that five in terms of desired execution. The more variables you put in, the more complex it is for a solver. And that also requires a more sophisticated user. And so if we're always thinking about having to put in these very complicated intents, then it's not necessarily good ux. Whereas if you think of the ultimate desired outcome would be swap 100 to 100 USDC, whatever, 102,000 SDC, that becomes significantly easier for a solver to fill. But it also leaves a lot of room for a solver to just very quickly pick that up and do it. And maybe it doesn't actually lead to the best outcome for the user.
00:27:20.260 - 00:28:03.534, Speaker E: So there's an inflection or sort of a middle ground where the intent is complex enough to give a solver specific enough instructions to say, like, okay, we're going to solve this. To get exactly what you want, you need to give us just enough information, but not too much information. And determining that point along that chart is something that I think needs to be sort of like, figured out exactly what users want, what the threshold for how complex users want their interfaces to be, versus these interfaces, that would just be like, far too simple. And at that point, they just would like, go to uniswap or Dex or something and just say, just do it.
00:28:06.994 - 00:28:54.616, Speaker D: Semi related to UX as well. More about the information shown on the interface. There's a lot of trust assumptions of constructing an intent. The user trusts the information shown on the information on the interface to submit their intent. So if they say APY is 5% or the price is x and so forth, and that's what they're shown, and then you submit an order, then they're actually being forced into submitting an incorrect intent because they've been shown incorrect information. So I think one layer that we need to look at a lot more as an industry is the metadata layer. What does that look like? Who are we trusting to present this to the users to construct their intents? I think the other point for me is also smart accounts.
00:28:54.616 - 00:29:38.144, Speaker D: I think we need to start transitioning a lot more to smart accounts to open up more complex defi actions, state transitions, and so forth. That injures tokens. Yeah, we're just talking about tokens nowadays, but the chain is a lot more than just tokens. Hopefully we, the third one is about solver distribution. So for an intent protocol, what do we suffice as, quote unquote decentralized? That is it okay to have one solver? Is it okay to have ten? Is it okay to have 50 what's kind of the balance of narrative versus reality?
00:29:42.444 - 00:29:48.492, Speaker B: Maybe on that, because you both already have solvers. What's your answer to the last question?
00:29:48.628 - 00:29:50.704, Speaker C: You mean to the transparency of data?
00:29:53.244 - 00:30:07.444, Speaker B: How do you balance between functioning solvers, as many solvers as there are, what are the trade offs that you need to navigate when letting solvers onboard into your system?
00:30:08.384 - 00:30:35.470, Speaker C: Yeah, like the trade offs is obvious. If we give ability to everyone to solve, we have traffic from the users they take to execution and do not execute it or execute it at a very bad rate. So first you need fair competition. All of the in our model, the best price you execute, right. So they are equal. But so it's like in the game theory. So the one to take should provide the better worker.
00:30:35.470 - 00:31:08.694, Speaker C: So one they compete to be the first to execute. That is the point. So in that sense we can allow to everyone. But how to say it's like. I would say it's very good things to be open, but at the same time we need to kind of trust not to spot, let's say our APIs not to try to take this transaction. And then I'll say fail to execute this one. Like we also the other topics are the guns, wars between resolvers.
00:31:08.694 - 00:31:10.690, Speaker C: Let's say other things to cover.
00:31:10.762 - 00:31:33.270, Speaker B: Okay. If builders, I mean how I understand fusion builders are basically taking care of the auction, right? The builder auction that takes care of navigating. Who is going to settle this? The user's order. So how does it increase the likelihood of settlement failing when you have more slows? That's what you mentioned, right? Yes.
00:31:33.302 - 00:31:59.258, Speaker C: I mean, if we have a lot, it's like let's see from one side it's always good. Let's see, there's. We like from what we see some reservoirs has like they have dedicated train repairs. So they kind of do arbitrage with techs. So actually through this they have a liquidity. So diversity is good. But the same time we'll say tech challenges.
00:31:59.258 - 00:32:28.124, Speaker C: So they try to execute and then it fails. So we hope we have eventually user wait more. Because resolvers spend gas and try to execute this one. It's like any effect. No one can feel disorder anymore. We get this also the other thing because we have partial feel for the intel orders. So we might see the situation when someone always feel like only half on the best price.
00:32:28.124 - 00:32:42.004, Speaker C: And then we have problem of distribution of the lower ends with the resolvers. So in general, my answer would be diversity, right. Especially if resolvers has different access to the different protocols. But it's also nice I would say.
00:32:42.704 - 00:32:53.164, Speaker D: Why would it fail more if you have more resolvers, if you're simulating the transactions, if you have four, you have 1520. I would have failed more with the more resolvers.
00:32:53.864 - 00:33:25.132, Speaker C: I mean, they can take some developers. Again, it's about also the API issues about the distribution. So some of them say might be not available. Okay, like we need, I would say few but very good. Like a lot that constantly take and might try to execute, but they might, you know, they try to execute and the transaction got rejected because they know they thought they would fuel order. But eventually it was a transaction injection.
00:33:25.228 - 00:33:25.864, Speaker D: Before.
00:33:28.164 - 00:33:40.128, Speaker C: Also I would say fewer good with a good convention for BF players. So the transaction goes through the private pool and not be front round those kinds of things.
00:33:40.256 - 00:33:41.244, Speaker B: What's your expected?
00:33:43.104 - 00:35:09.000, Speaker A: Maybe to clarify a few points because it almost sounded like the entire user money is at rust and of course it's only the limit. Price of the user, order is secure and I think, I assume it's the same. So what would be at risk is the slippage tolerance, right, that the user is allowing for and that I'm not sure how to sum one in, but on password it's also secured in the sense that each solver is required to participate in a bonding quote. So if they were to maliciously provide a quote, a prize quote, and they wouldn't actually adhere to it, they would be slashed and we would make sure that the user is being paid back. So why do you need the competition is if you only have one single server in the system, then they could basically quote at a very low price and wouldn't necessarily have the necessity to provide the user a better price. The whole idea behind the intent based system was let's try to have a competition where the user gets the maximum possible rate that is benefiting them. And so the stronger the competition, the more you have advanced competing mechanisms that are checking different on chain price pools.
00:35:09.000 - 00:36:31.550, Speaker A: Some of them also have their own private liquidity, and the more liquidity sources you're checking, the more likely you can actually provide a better price to. So you need this competition to push servers also to innovate and like to make sure that they continue adding on new existing infinity pools, because it's also somewhat of a complex task, right, like a curve pool looks very different to uniswap pool, so it is quite involved to actually make sure that your solver is able, the solver algorithm is able to tap into that liquidity and then also calculate what's like the right balance of like 60% submitted by one pool, 20% by another, another 20% by another pool. So you need competition, and then you probably also need specialized solvers, because there might be certain training types that are rarely being used. So it might not necessarily play out for every server. If there's a, I think, cost of, you have like 17 servers or so at the moment running like. And so it is quite important that those education sales being covered because of 17 servers are competing, but it's something that is only traded maybe once or twice per week. Is it really worthwhile on a development effort to incorporate a specific route? It wouldn't be, but if you're the only server who does that, maybe it is.
00:36:31.550 - 00:36:48.094, Speaker A: But so this is why it's important to have like a variety of servers with different skills, with different private liquidity, with different skills of adding new liquidity faster, like different specializations, and like, this pressure to innovate and continue developing.
00:36:52.154 - 00:38:08.026, Speaker E: To add on to that, I think very often times capitalism is thought in like a negative context, in that it doesn't necessarily benefit the, the people within the system. However, a system where you have a large number of solvers competing to fulfill users and satisfy them is a different way of looking at capitalism, where you have this competing system where everyone is just trying to give the best outcome and the best result to a user to make them happy. That's objectively a good thing. As you were saying, a good number of solvers that also do fulfill specialized. Like, if you have a group of solvers who are completely focused on swaps and like completing limit orders and whatnot, like, that's great. But those solvers are, I would say, like, less likely to be able to fill like lending intents. If you wanted to like take out a loan on AAve or any, anywhere, really, that fills like a specific criteria, like, let's say you want like a certain LTV or CR or something, and you were then to submit that intent to, I'll just say swap solvers, it would potentially take them longer to figure out exactly what they're going to do, and thus lead to a longer wait time for the user.
00:38:08.026 - 00:38:13.814, Speaker E: So having a wide number of solvers that can fulfill a different range of actions is a very good thing.
00:38:16.594 - 00:38:56.554, Speaker D: Yeah, we're one of these solvers. We're more specialized in Defi. Yeah, we like these edge cases. We also do the base tokens, but we also see that kind of expanding, that's our niche. If you say, I think it's good to have a whitelist of solvers to join the network as a start, since it's a fresh industry that fully open at the beginning. I think the lower amount of solvers or resolvers fillers I don't think is beneficial to the protocol nor the adoption of intents. It's more centralizing the flow and it may even be centralizing it more to market makers.
00:38:56.554 - 00:39:09.394, Speaker D: And yeah, I think it just limits our ecosystem. So I think having different specialties of solvers, similar to what you're saying, part of the network with more amount of solvers benefits us all in the long term.
00:39:12.654 - 00:39:55.516, Speaker C: I just want to clarify things, give such good clarification on how resolver works. So I also want to clarify how the works here. So actually resolving is part of one inch system tokenomics now. So we have resolvers on board and resolvers should stay one inch. So lock them and then they can resolve the traffic of the intent orders. It's one thing also once one quarter is orders, we ensure that, like they have QSeQAb things because we don't know, we don't want our users to get money from northern Korea to their pockets through the one inch resolver. So that's never happened here.
00:39:55.516 - 00:40:37.584, Speaker C: So also at least it's important for the security concerns, different countries, regulations, etcetera. And initially I would say the question was very good, why we need to have more good resolvers. It's very true. We have limit amounts because initially we thought, hey, it would be very nice economics if based on amount of stake, the resolver take possibility to fill first, then second, etcetera. After we put the greenhouse goals in our governance, all the things resolved. So now resolver can fill in the same time. In this sense, if they are whitelisted, they are translated, they don't try to spam again our back end, not try to check users.
00:40:37.584 - 00:40:50.104, Speaker C: We'll be happy to have many good resolvers. At the same time you have bad resolvers on words problems for the users community in general. Just mind finding communication here.
00:40:50.564 - 00:40:58.876, Speaker D: I think your older model was similar to like ABAC staking and this is how a lot of math was done with ABAC. The more you stake, you saw the block as fast.
00:40:59.060 - 00:41:14.904, Speaker C: Unfortunately it's not aware of Abex. But yes, it's like this time based things, but we do these experiments and promote voting and then we change the model. So maybe there also changes after the governance protocol and after the governance.
00:41:17.284 - 00:42:17.524, Speaker B: Awesome, thanks. That was luminating. So there's many trainers that need to navigate these mechanisms. On a more on a lighter note, we've talked a bit about what the users want the users want or what do you think the users want? Better your exercise. Maybe you have something to add to that. Like what is your view of what your clients, the traders and the different traders, what they really, I mean we see things like the telegram bots taking off very quickly and gaining lots of users and also some people in Defi are confused about that success and maybe you have something to add on. How do you think about the needs of users? How do you prioritize them and make out? Are they different between different groups? This is something that.
00:42:19.844 - 00:42:53.512, Speaker C: Like from what we see, like in Malaysia, we have a lot of traffic from professional traders. So the main reason is the gas price. So they go to the low gas fees, to the best roads, the best execution. It's number one, I just think is what is always matter is the gas efficiency. There is rates, the best rates, that is mostly keyers. So again, if we talk about 33 37 users, there is a lot of smart wallets in the space. We already integrate Pok two I think recently.
00:42:53.512 - 00:43:32.890, Speaker C: So we do this adoption, but like whenever someone has this extra 40k, yes, for 43, seven intent based wallet, like it's not that like professional traders don't go there, there's now few adoption here, but as in we here on our dark, if there is more smart contract based wallet counts. So we like we see and going to, I would say anticipate this Google account stuff if we have worldwide adoption. So that's what we need to build some more. Again, rewrite with the best efficiency stuff. Let's just come to my mind right.
00:43:32.922 - 00:43:35.494, Speaker E: Right now, one thing you would add is guest list.
00:43:38.214 - 00:43:46.674, Speaker C: Yes, like definitely we just already worked on this, that we need to do it always more efficiently because the professional players want to be more and more efficient.
00:43:49.414 - 00:44:57.614, Speaker A: That's good because we launch gases or others. I think our users mostly want a moo sound and we have quite a way of feedback collection from our users. And I think honestly, rather than adding more and more query use cases that are actually really interesting that we are working on as well as I think users just want also a simple and also fast execution speed. And I think that's definitely something that we will be tackling for next year or so. So that execution, while it's simple, users usually are very impatient and sometimes don't even want to wait as long as like a minute or so. So speed is definitely something that we can improve and it's kind of a train of us like to provide the best execution incentives and at the same time speedy executions. Of course if you would just forward it to one execution parties, like, if you forward to the one inch iPad faster, but it's not necessarily the best execution you can get.
00:44:57.614 - 00:45:07.294, Speaker A: But we have already looked into this and there's ways that we can also improve significantly the speed and powers of intent system. And that's something that we would check next year.
00:45:08.714 - 00:46:22.004, Speaker E: So I have like a slightly unconventional example. Someone tweeted at us yesterday or today, they were like having an issue getting a task around Istanbul and they were like, can someone, is there like a solver that can figure this out? And to a degree, that's kind of what you would want. You want to be able to submit an attempt to say, like, I want to go x to y. And obviously, like, the meme of Uber on chain is like, it's a meme, however, but this ideally a sovereign network, being able to pick up a user's intent to go from a to b and provide them a solution to that is not a bad use case for what intent could be. This is obviously very far from the more financial systems that we're talking about here. But I think intents, it can be broader than just swaps and specifically on chain financial interactions, because ultimately it is just a matching network for figuring out what a user wants and how to get it to them in the most efficient way possible. Our focus is still very much on providing like solid uX, solid tooling, solid infrastructure for applications and wallets to be able to more efficiently interact and provide intents for their users.
00:46:22.004 - 00:46:26.284, Speaker E: But these things, we're just, you know, we're not on the back end.
00:46:27.544 - 00:46:28.832, Speaker D: What was the question again?
00:46:28.968 - 00:46:31.192, Speaker B: The question is, what do users want?
00:46:31.288 - 00:46:32.844, Speaker F: What do your users want?
00:46:33.624 - 00:47:09.264, Speaker D: More defi. Every day we get requests and you integrate this protocol, this action, this protocol, we only build from user requesting. That's kind of how we manage it. The way that we prioritize it is to TBL, the volumetric to user base of people that would integrate us. Who wants to go to cowswap to then do these traits as well. So for us, it's just purely user based development before there's a lot more theoretical to get the launch. Then once you launch it, it's all user feedback.
00:47:09.264 - 00:47:19.664, Speaker D: We don't have, let's say, don't have enough time to sit back and build for one year. Right now, everyone just wants to integrate.
00:47:19.704 - 00:47:20.964, Speaker E: And have more than five.
00:47:25.824 - 00:47:26.624, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:47:26.784 - 00:47:32.504, Speaker B: So guestless, faster, more reusable infrastructure and more coverage.
00:47:34.324 - 00:47:36.864, Speaker C: Like cheap gas, because gasoline.
00:47:39.044 - 00:48:08.320, Speaker B: So that is price, effective price. Effective price. So price net gas. Great. Then moving a little bit more to the future. Ultimately, we will have to expand beyond our little defi model to grow. So we will have to compare ourselves to the traditional alternatives that any person has.
00:48:08.320 - 00:48:38.584, Speaker B: And those are the banking apps, trading apps, and what other alternatives they have to invest. Where do you think is the biggest delta in both directions? Like, where do we have in the execution part, the biggest advantage of a traditional finance and where to be left behind the most? And then perhaps on those parts that we left behind the most, how? What's the best solution to fix that?
00:48:41.004 - 00:48:53.724, Speaker C: Yeah, nice question. Because I think I already have some bias in ethereum. So, like, crypto looks much better than traditional finance, but definitely there's a bias. Not everybody understands all this.
00:48:54.224 - 00:48:54.696, Speaker E: Yes.
00:48:54.760 - 00:49:26.774, Speaker C: Try to like thinking outside. It's still like all these 43 seven smart wallets where you just. Your Gmail account or something. This is like, definitely actually we go to this direction. One thing the benefits for me is like the cross border 84 by seven work is just amazing. I can never see in the banking space, like, we unlocked your transfer stock. Cross border is like, still sometimes very challenging.
00:49:26.774 - 00:50:08.994, Speaker C: Plus accessibility is also like defines open market. So I can go to the landing protocol, I can buy this token mechanics. So also the options, like the insurance for the prices is like a lot of things accessible. Just with my metamask wallet, I don't need something else. No need to go to some exchanges, say that I'm a certified investor, whatever. So stability is. Yeah.
00:50:08.994 - 00:50:18.454, Speaker C: But for us more general public on board with 4337, I think that is the way to move. Yeah, thanks.
00:50:19.594 - 00:51:26.680, Speaker A: For me, one big promise of DeFi is improving accessibility. And the other one is probably also removing not. Yeah, not an interest, but also fees. And like, if you think about one huge financial topic and remittances, like, generally exchanging currency, like international currency, like ridiculously type of fees that are being extracted just from having this market of, like, needing to exchange one asset for another one. And the fees taken there and even sending money, sometimes it's like 10% fee or whatever. And the thing is, there are solutions for this that could be developed in CIFA, but I think the CFA system is already so advanced and there's so many strong players that are benefiting from, like, those fees that they're not really incentivized, they're in power and they're not incentivized to remove it. But with blockchain, we now have the ability to kind of revolutionize the system.
00:51:26.680 - 00:52:28.244, Speaker A: System and come up with a better system and try it out. And so just thinking about the whole forex exchange examples, like think about instead of everyone individually swapping one asset for another one, like you have, like if I want to exchange my us dollar into euros and someone wants to exchange their euros into us dollars, and this happens on the scale of thousands and tens, 10,000 of 10,0000 people on a daily basis. So this fee market is huge, it's ginormous. And ultimately it's like the normal retail user who's suffering from this, and you can solve this with batching. If you were able to just put everyone who's in Europe who wants to exchange for us dollars and everyone who's in the US and other countries where they use us dollars and want to buy euro, which is all, match those together, you could set it and you wouldn't have to pay any fees. And this is something that blockchain is able to enable. And this is huge.
00:52:28.244 - 00:53:05.384, Speaker A: Yeah. And this is something where we can really have innovation. But I think there's also risks right now at achieving this goal because you have other issues. You have issues such as Mev, then other ways of extracting away from users who have very high gas costs. And these are UX issues that are kind of circumventing this adoption that would enable us to bring this innovation. And so we need to make sure that we kind of find a way to not hinder ourselves from gay adoption by solving those other issues first.
00:53:08.444 - 00:54:29.062, Speaker E: I think one of the things that obviously we can move forward on, and that definitely just benefits the world as a whole is, well, to run this, we're moving towards like a scarce society in a way where we kind of just are hitting this point of the world where just resources are less abundant, it's more competitive, people are having a harder time achieving independent wealth, and it becomes like a more frantic search for people to be able to sustain themselves. This is something that I think anyone disagrees is happening. And in a way I don't want to say, yes, blockchain solves this because it doesn't immediately solve it by itself. But the tools that blockchain can buy, such as DeFi, better access to remittance, cross chain payments, everything like that, it improves the status of these people and enables them to just, like, not necessarily have to deal with predatory, centralized institutions like western union who charges 15% or so. It's ridiculous. And that exists like exclusively to prey upon people. Whereas with DeFi, incredibly, if not microscopic fees to do the exact same actions that actually happen faster.
00:54:29.062 - 00:54:38.314, Speaker E: It's just a better, a better way of doing things. I don't know. I don't want to get too doomer on this. I'm sorry.
00:54:40.534 - 00:54:58.604, Speaker D: So I used to work for a swiss institution. It was a bank. So trackfi crypto. All I can say is this industry is a lot better. I don't think we should be really catering to that to a certain degree. If we do want, let's say, more tradfi. To use DeFi is going to take years.
00:54:58.604 - 00:55:28.604, Speaker D: I tried pushing it three years ago. And the crypto bank, the regulation and so forth need to have KYC pools, KYC counterparties. It's not really decentralized finance. It's going to be maybe a different ecosystem of Kyc defi. The one improvement we can definitely make on the solver side is speeds. Solvers can respond within let's say eight, 9 seconds. I think we should be responding within 200 milliseconds.
00:55:28.604 - 00:56:14.514, Speaker D: So that's an improvement. We can definitely make extraction for the retail users, definitely as well for the gas abstraction, I think holistically, just having more use cases for the real world person to interact with this ecosystem. So showing the benefits and abstracting the logic of blockchain away for them. I've got a spicy comment also to say. I think ironically with intents over the years we are going to some degree recreate the traditional finance infrastructure with many different middlemen. The eleven protocols who have solvers, who have solvers of solvers, everyone specializing in different parts. And we will create many different men to win within the season.
00:56:14.514 - 00:56:15.654, Speaker D: The system as well.
00:56:20.794 - 00:56:43.834, Speaker B: Interpreting the mood quite conservatively. Okay, up it again. So we heard we need to be easier to onboard, we need to be faster and we need to be very conscientious of not repeating the mistakes of radfi and enabling better qualitation.
00:56:46.014 - 00:57:05.886, Speaker C: With a kind of protection not only ease on board, but. Right. Similar same experience as the initial with accessible level with abstractions. I just got a few talks very quick here that it takes guys to do arbitrage. They need this with access levels of banking accounts and also so that it's.
00:57:05.910 - 00:57:07.434, Speaker B: Not hard to onboard any.
00:57:08.204 - 00:57:25.944, Speaker C: Yeah, just once you're bored. It's not only for the retail user on board, it's more for more professional players. Again, traders, they need the speaker they used to see. Sex world wiser, let's say explanation of certain kinds.
00:57:26.324 - 00:57:28.264, Speaker B: Okay, great.
00:57:29.764 - 00:57:32.852, Speaker A: In the more utopian discussions, intents are.
00:57:32.868 - 00:58:17.474, Speaker B: Often spoken of as a paradigm, a new way of altogether, and as much more than just a limit order. It will actually perhaps have a societal change and I wonder if there's something, if you think there's something to this, like do intense and solving this intent solving separation, do they enable new forms of social coordination? Are they an important part of blockchain? How we can bring blockchains to a wider audience? Like, will this improve and will this perhaps change how we think about coordinating exchanges amongst each other? Oh, yeah, we can change the audio.
00:58:18.814 - 00:59:22.594, Speaker D: I'd love to take the older knowledge doing something at the end, but I'll start this thing. Social coordination within intents. I think, let's say autonomous attend agents. So being able to define your parameters and like saying have a bot act on your behalf for financial transactions is very interesting. Maybe not within social coordination. However, to bring the good down again, it's quite dangerous with intents as you are declaring what you would like to do, and this information can be used against you. So my recommendation is do not scan your eyeballs, even if you get $50 paid to scan your eyeball, as certain information of your previous intents and previous transactions on chain can be used to create a behavioral analysis and characteristics of you, which maybe in the future there could be some gatekeeping of attempt protocols to stop you from interacting based upon your prior transactions.
00:59:22.594 - 00:59:42.274, Speaker D: Social coordination, maybe you could even have payroll every single month, just transferring the funds. You could also have an intention of splitting a bill, for example, at a restaurant that automatically, once you've given the approvals, all four parties will split it. So in that area, I think it could be quite interesting.
00:59:43.834 - 01:00:33.494, Speaker E: I would love to see the last one because the whole credit card shuffle, it's just, no one ever enjoys it. I think, yeah, intent's going to be applied to a lot more than just on chain, financially oriented transactions. Because ultimately, I think I mentioned earlier, it's like you're putting something out there and you're just asking someone to figure it out for you. That is something that we do every day with, literally, like, everything we do, be it interacting with, like calling it a cab or whatever. But like, let's say you wanted to get concert tickets and you're just like, I want Taylor Swift tickets, please. And this is the price I'm willing to pay. And instead of like, going through Ticketmaster, who's going to charge you, like, everything? No, too much.
01:00:33.494 - 01:01:27.364, Speaker E: You said how to solve can identify a counterparty that has put up their tickets on some third party site with an incredibly low fee, identify that, grab it for you, and send it to you. And you can just do all of this, of course, theoretically from a wallet which already has your funds your key or not your keys, but your permissions are signed over and it's just executed on your behalf. So anything that allows people to just more easily do what they want to do that they would be doing every day is a huge improvement. On the social coordination side, I'm not really sure. I think there's definitely realms of research that need to be done to delve into. I think also what people want to figure out, how exactly we want to move forward in that area. I do like the idea of an autonomous agent that can execute things on your behalf.
01:01:27.364 - 01:01:39.804, Speaker E: Thinking on how all of these AI wearables are starting to pop up, not to be like, yo AI curriculum, let's go. But I think there's something to be said for that. It's an interesting area that should be explored.
01:01:41.664 - 01:02:35.918, Speaker A: I think it's a very popular question these days of what are future use cases of intensive can we take it? What would it enable? But I also think that by answering that, like, spinning some different fantasies around, I'm also contradicting my previous response of, like, I think intents are currently a bit overhyped and we should, at least for now, think back at the basics and, like, getting the basics right. So I'm kind of like, I don't want to like. Yes, I think that, yeah, for things like better coordination for symphonies, even as ticketing, et cetera, you can also take it like, more like you can enable ring trades. Maybe you have a Taylor Swift ticket. Someone else doesn't like Taylor Swift. Once you go to Britney Spears, whatever, you can have a circuitry of those. But, like, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
01:02:35.918 - 01:02:43.634, Speaker A: Like, let's get the basics right. Let's build where we are here right now with good ux, and then take it from there.
01:02:45.434 - 01:03:24.630, Speaker C: Definitely agree here that the question is philosophical. What is the future for the farming shift? Would we have decentralized Uber? For me, it's kind of more simplified view. Like whatever will be economically efficient, let's say if we achieve better price, better efficiency with swaps with the result. So whatever is economic efficient also, right? So we want to see this. Just waiting to see how it's changed. So there's plenty of idea in space. And the one which efficient was the answer.
01:03:24.630 - 01:03:27.834, Speaker C: So now we focus on the good effects, the efficiency.
01:03:32.014 - 01:03:39.974, Speaker B: Awesome. And so I think that concludes the stratosphere. If anybody has some closing questions at the moment.
01:03:41.674 - 01:04:17.674, Speaker F: I have a question, kind of back to the solver competition discussion. I think Connie mentioned earlier that the solver profitability is kind of an issue. And many of these solvers are subsidized by free infrastructure. And so maybe this question is mostly applicable to building order system. But how are you guys thinking about this problem that, you know, if these solvers are more profitable and they wind up disappearing and you're relying on solar competition, how are you dealing with that potential problem?
01:04:18.214 - 01:04:57.984, Speaker A: I mean, I guess it's actually a very interesting question for the solvers because they have really the perspective from like the solvers at water and Santosula. And I think it's actually really interesting to compare the incentive mechanisms also, not only between fusion and causal, but also units of x. So particularly right now, we do it. When we initially started, there was no further ecosystem around where it just didn't exist. So we needed to bootstrap it. How did we bootstrap it? Is by paying out incentives. And so currently incentives are given out like rewards, as on a weekly basis, split across three categories.
01:04:57.984 - 01:05:47.976, Speaker A: It's essentially for continuity, it's for how much better is your solution compared to the second best solution? Because obviously, like it's important. Like if you are only providing a solution that's one step better than the other solution, then it's not adding that much value. And then lastly, also like basically ensuring that price feed is being given to answers. And yeah, this is being paid out on a weekly basis. It looks like our servers are happy with that. As for Kelly pad and cow, I think also the current upswing of cow chicken prices sorcery, probably helping them to be more happy about it. But yeah, so basically we are also thinking about moving away.
01:05:47.976 - 01:06:32.944, Speaker A: Like let's see. But we have recently talked about starting to potentially take small fees and especially on other types where we offer value that no other orders in the ecosystem do. For example, limit orders is something where everybody else is sitting at a limited price. And in castle you can get a better price than a limit price. And this is where we would start charting some peace from, because it would still be better off than trading anywhere else. And there's definitely a possibility when servers start charging the piece for car protocol. And they could also consider how does I think currently the case on fusion and non uniswap x to essentially take some fees from user audience directly.
01:06:34.324 - 01:06:54.728, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks. Yeah, just. Okay. It starts from the beginning, from the resolvers. We also have similar journey as boots hope so with initial incentive program for resolvers for the bootstrap. So incentives, not weekly, maybe monthly or something. So then we finished this incentivized program.
01:06:54.728 - 01:07:37.128, Speaker C: So we, as I remember, some result was dropped off. I mean, so they get out from this party because the efficient result has stayed. So our results is the result who take profit out of this, let's say efficient resolving. Do some like combining the world coincidence of once here, this is the name of cosal here. So the yes, the efficient one stays and we finish this. Our insight from regarding cities, we don't include any fees from the user profit here. So the resolution should cover the gas expenses.
01:07:37.128 - 01:08:11.004, Speaker C: They pay for the execution of gas order. So they submit transaction, they have efficiency if they combine, let's say big orders. So if they combine ten orders in one transaction, so they pay gas once, it's like still like not the same price, but it's cheaper if they send transaction one by one. So here's the efficiency plus they might have access to the tax liquidity, I don't know, some advanced training algorithms. So short answer. The one who make profit out of this stay in this resolving and serve our users.
01:08:14.024 - 01:08:38.503, Speaker D: I don't think it's just making profit. I think some solvers are trying to capture more of the market as well. So I know some solvers are losing money everywhere months just to be part of the ecosystem. Regardless of the token rewards and the percentages that you're generating fees, people have big teams to be solvers, resolvers to propose this infrastructure.
01:08:39.243 - 01:08:59.644, Speaker A: I have a follow up question because we do have two solvers here. And then you mentioned also the servers that are making money, they're staying. So how about Enzo and propeller heads? Propeller heads and Enzo, like what is IU currently on Fusion? What are you talking about? Economics.
01:09:00.304 - 01:09:01.484, Speaker D: You can go first.
01:09:03.424 - 01:10:04.564, Speaker B: Now ask your questions first on the question of how do solvers make revenue? I think we covered the basics once downs between Anand Archim, but I also think that the future of solver business model is still being worked out. As Connor mentioned, many solvers are now increasing their bids to win flow and not necessarily focusing on short term profits because it is a long term game. Now, I think Connor and I were both very good solvers, but we're currently not on one fusion because the hurdle is a bit too much to buy $1 million of one inch tokens. But I do see that this model is continuously being developed and that there are changes made right recently made a change. So perhaps in the future it will be easier to enter that set of resolvers.
01:10:08.204 - 01:10:25.664, Speaker D: Yes, too expensive. The rewards to the cost of decaying the one inch token, the exposure is too much. We would love to do it, but there's not enough incentive, consent of the line or solvers.
01:10:28.244 - 01:11:02.234, Speaker C: Here gives the answer from the solver itself. Why is it good or why they don't? So some of them can take profits, some of them see the levels are high, some has algorithms, some other liquidity, et cetera. And yeah, just also the rules can be changed. Government like Dao can provoke and also it might be different incentives as resolves to be a part of solving systems or not. This is like also not the one answer. It depends on the protocol, on the DaO, on the rules, etcetera.
01:11:03.734 - 01:11:06.914, Speaker D: Are you looking to sanctify spatial isos?
01:11:09.974 - 01:11:15.974, Speaker B: I think the answer to the question is it's still being worked out and we're still looking for the ideal mechanism.
01:11:16.054 - 01:11:17.434, Speaker C: Ok the fleeting scene.
01:11:18.614 - 01:11:30.134, Speaker B: We'll look forward to the next iterations on all the mechanism designs, what we will be building and with that closing this panel. Thanks everyone for inviting.
01:12:45.024 - 01:12:45.804, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:13:10.704 - 01:13:11.560, Speaker E: Was intense.
01:13:11.632 - 01:13:12.364, Speaker A: Intense.
01:13:15.654 - 01:13:24.934, Speaker E: I'm the head of growth for essential and I am going to talk to you today about not getting cucked by on chain complications and what.
