00:00:06.000 - 00:00:49.140, Speaker A: This is a seminal moment in the worldcoin ecosystem because this is the first ever hackathon for mini apps. So to kick things off though, I basically just wanted to answer three things or I wanted to say three things. One is I wanted to talk a little bit about World as a crypto project and World for crypto skeptics. I think most people here today are probably not too skeptical of World, but generally speaking, World has been a controversial project in the space that people have been skeptical about. And obviously people can be skeptical about whatever they want. So we, we encourage skepticism. But I actually think it's one of the most exciting, if not the most exciting project in the crypto space.
00:00:49.140 - 00:01:16.930, Speaker A: And I wanted to sort of share a couple of things. I think people get surprised by when they learn about how, what World is from the sort of, from the, from the crypto perspective. So a few fast facts about World's crypto story. World is the largest user of Zero knowledge Proofs. We are the largest user of Gnosis Safes, the largest sponsor of end user gas fees. I somewhat decided to make that up. I'm not, well, I'm not 100% sure where you validate that, but we definitely.
00:01:16.930 - 00:01:44.572, Speaker A: People don't know that. What I mean by that is like I don't know how to necessarily 100% validate that, but what I want to get across is if you use the World app, all your gas fees are covered. And that's always been the case. And I think based on everything I know, that's the largest that's ever happened. It's also an ongoing airdrop, the largest airdrop in human history. I'm a huge fan of airdrops. I remember when I first claimed my uni tokens and changed my life.
00:01:44.572 - 00:02:12.710, Speaker A: 305 million tokens distributed. Another way to think about this, 305 million world tokens. Today, world is like $2. So that's like $600 million basically of money that's been spent onboarding people to the World ecosystem that now you developers can leverage for free. And I would say it's the most widely distributed ERC20 token. Again I put a question mark because I'm not 100% sure if that's true. But there's about 6 million unique wallets holding the World token.
00:02:12.710 - 00:02:30.222, Speaker A: So I think this is where World's at from like a network perspective. We have like 15.4 total network users. Of those, 7.2 million have been verified by the orb which you see over there. So if you're not verified today, is your day 4.4 or sorry, nope, not 4.4.
00:02:30.222 - 00:02:58.858, Speaker A: That's the growth rate. But the remainder, which I think is about 8 million, then are app users but are not yet verified. Which is another interesting actually narrative point. Like, technically speaking, there's more users in the World Network that are not verified than are verified. So the World network, I think of it broadly, it's like both the verified users and the unverified. It's anyone who's using the app. And yeah, this is just like a couple examples of countries where World currently has high levels of penetration.
00:02:58.858 - 00:04:12.070, Speaker A: So if you're building a mini app or you're building for this audience, John will probably talk about this, but his team, they've done a good job of like Oro, which is gold in Spanish, like building for the Spanish speaking language audience. Okay, so that's like just high level. Why I'm excited about World from a crypto perspective. What the scale of World is the reason that we are here in this moment and the reason that this is an exciting moment and the people in this room are actually pioneers in this very special time. The zero to one moment that's happening right now is miniapps, and Andy's going to go into miniapps more. So I'm not going to belabor the point, but I do want to make get it across of like you might be thinking, okay, if World's so big, why have I not really heard of it before? Why has no one built anything on it before? And the reason is because up until two weeks ago, there was no way for developers to access the distribution of the World ecosystem. And that changed two weeks ago with the launch of MiniAPPS, which is an open framework for developers to put their apps into the World app and, and reach this audience that we have spent $600 million attaining.
00:04:12.070 - 00:04:44.650, Speaker A: So that's what I want you to know is like, we've done the go to market for you. We can give you hundreds of thousands of users in a day. All these users, these are not just like users, these are users that are fully onboarded to crypto, that have tokens in their wallet that don't need to pay gas fees. Also, it's a network that's growing by literally 50. Yesterday it was like 67,000, around 50,000 per day. And so all you need to do now is build something that is valuable to these people. You don't need to worry about any of these other problems that you've always had to worry about in crypto.
00:04:44.650 - 00:05:13.540, Speaker A: And so just as an example of this growth. Shout out to John and his team. This is an oro growth chart. They've gone from 0 users of their mini app to 3, 313,000 daily users in 13 days. So applause for the builders. We'll have John talk more about that. But that's like, you know, that's basically what you can get when you leverage the world as a distribution network.
00:05:13.540 - 00:05:53.848, Speaker A: So that's what I wanted to make clear is like we are in a special moment, something new has happened. That's why this is actually a unique opportunity that was not available last month, last year, et cetera. I wanted to also, just very quick, this is the last thing I'm going to do. Give me like one more minute. Debunk a couple common misconceptions or myths about World. While I have you here, first is that I think a lot of people, when they think of World, they think that it's basically just the orb. But the reality is world is a chain, it's an app, it's the world chain, it's the world app, it's a token, it's world coin and it's this anonymous proof of humanity protocol which orb is an input into.
00:05:53.848 - 00:06:24.584, Speaker A: But the orb is obviously a very important critical piece and differentiators of this whole network. But there's this network that you can use whether or not you are orb verified. And so this is kind of related here, right? You need to scan your eyes to use a World app. The reality is you can get a wallet and world ID by downloading the app. You verify your world ID by scanning your eyes, but you don't get a world ID by scanning your eyes, you just get it by using the app. So you can just download the app, start using it today using the chain. Your wallet or identity is associated with your eye scan.
00:06:24.584 - 00:07:01.804, Speaker A: This is something that I used to think, but like, I think a lot of people, yeah, a lot of people I think believe that, oh, if I scan my eyes like now, you know, like this wallet is tied to like this user. That is actually not true at all because what we do is it's all using zero knowledge proof. So basically when you go to an app and attest that you're a human, you're not saying like, I'm a specific human, you're saying I. You're signing a zero knowledge proof saying that I have a hash in the data set. So it's very, very, very privacy conscious. So that's all I wanted to do. An intro of why this is a really exciting moment for the world ecosystem.
00:07:01.804 - 00:07:08.220, Speaker A: And the opportunity we have. And with that, if you need a cheerleader for your app, I'm going to be your cheerle.
