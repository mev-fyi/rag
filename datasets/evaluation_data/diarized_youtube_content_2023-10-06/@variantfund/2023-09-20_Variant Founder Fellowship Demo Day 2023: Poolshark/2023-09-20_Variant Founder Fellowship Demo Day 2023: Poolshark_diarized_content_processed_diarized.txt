00:00:08.090 - 00:00:34.230, Speaker A: Thanks everybody for joining us today. For VFF demo today. My name is Alpha Key. I'm presenting Fullshark which is a directional AMM for pro traders. A bit of background about myself. So I'm a software infrastructure engineer by trade. I've worked a handful of fintech companies about eight years of doing that and kind of always had this interest in trading.
00:00:34.230 - 00:01:48.798, Speaker A: So early 2021 when Bitcoin started hitting these critical levels again, I was starting to look at glass and analytics thinking like okay, I can predict general momentum of the market by tracking large BTC activity. And I was also using three commas to be able to open and close all these small positions and sort of manage my trades on centralized exchanges. So coming on chain I started playing around with yield farms and realizing like, hey, there's kind of like a void or a white space for sort of advanced tooling. I didn't really feel like the tooling that was present really fit the user base. So what we're building is a directional AMM that allows for users to place one way liquidity positions where they can buy or sell and to kind of offset that against what's offered today on AMMS is that users can create a position, an LP position, but that LP position only can buy and sell. Centralized exchanges today have a split buy and sell side. And I'll use these two terms throughout the presentation inside the book.
00:01:48.798 - 00:02:37.530, Speaker A: So inside the book refers to the buyer sell order being listed in the actual order book so it's like ready to be executed. And then also outside the book which refers to the buy or sell order not being actually listed in the order book or in this case the liquidity pool. So today in a lot of cases we're doing off chain execution which kind of results in this conditional market order. I'm still going to take the price that's there when I actually reach the AMM and my transactions being executed. This results in slow execution. You're reliant on an off chain actor, perhaps this is going to result in slow execution which leads to a worse price. And with polishark solution we have one way execution.
00:02:37.530 - 00:03:32.046, Speaker A: So that's why we refer to it as directional LP. And this is faster because this trade is filled inside the pool along with all the other trades. So on the left in the case of the price being 2000 USD, that trade is going to execute when the price actually hits there and on the right it's ready to be executed. So just to give a simple rundown of what exchanges offer versus what's offered on the other AMMS, other centralized exchanges offer a market order. So you can buy or sell at the current price, but you're not guaranteed execution limit order, you buy or sell at a specific price and therefore you are guaranteed a specific price execution and then stop orders are used to prevent losses. So if EOS 1500. Hey, I want to exit my position.
00:03:32.046 - 00:04:09.094, Speaker A: And so today's AMMS they natively offer the market order. You can buy or sell at whatever the current price is there when I get there. But with poolsharp, we're offering both limit orders and stop orders. And this allows users to kind of set one transaction. This is a problem specifically with token launches where there's a lot of volatility and you still want to get your transaction in by just sending a single transaction. You don't want to have to wait for multiple transactions that perhaps could fail. So moving on to target users.
00:04:09.094 - 00:05:18.590, Speaker A: So I think primarily we're focused on pro traders that really want to trade volatility, especially in these low cap tokens. And also protocols like liquidity managers and yield protocols that can benefit from these advanced LP types. Also Ammlps that want access to hedging tools where they can work with the naked asset instead of a derivative like an option or something like that. Our tools also allow them to dynamically rebalance their position and take profit on fee revenue when the price reaches a certain point. And we'll also be looking to target market makers and see if we can kind of get them to come and capture spreads and sort of trade their portfolio in this way. And so why is this an important problem? Our overall team thesis is that the decentralized markets will look much like the traditional markets with the little caveat twist of things working technically different. And to us, this means relentlessly pursuing a limit order model that can scale to millions of users.
00:05:18.590 - 00:05:22.900, Speaker A: So that day one when somebody launches their token, they have these features available.
00:05:23.430 - 00:05:32.390, Speaker B: Great, thanks so much. Alpha key. So, first question, could you talk more about why pool shark is needed as a separate protocol versus just as a univ four hook?
00:05:33.850 - 00:06:03.860, Speaker A: Yeah, so essentially these are two different tools for two different jobs. So I like to think of the liquidity that's provided on today's MMS, including uniswap as sort of like think of it as a screwdriver. You can twist it both ways. So you could buy and sell when you put up the assets. And here we're offering allowing users to only buy or only sell such that it locks in their execution and it requires less hands on maintenance from them.
00:06:06.310 - 00:06:10.050, Speaker B: Pranit asks, how can you guarantee execution of stop orders?
00:06:11.670 - 00:06:51.310, Speaker A: Yeah, so essentially we use a Dutch auction mechanism to do this. So this is a problem that I've thought about very extensively and basically that Dutch auction must play out faster than what the volatility is actually occurring. So MakerDAO, for example, their Oracle can update as fast as 1%/minute. So we sort of have the same sort of problems to solve there around making sure that we're improving the price such that someone wants to come in and scoop that liquidity.
00:06:53.810 - 00:07:00.690, Speaker B: Can you say more about how poolshark can take advantage of composability? Is this an important part of your value proposition?
00:07:02.150 - 00:07:32.510, Speaker A: Definitely, yes. So thinking about, like I said, liquidity managers, maybe Dow, Treasuries, they can have a very transparent view into how things are exactly going to execute. Certainly a lot of DAOs today are doing that off chain with maybe something like Uniswap X or cowswap. But we want to bring more of those participants on chain and allow them to more easily take advantage of the features that we're offering.
00:07:33.810 - 00:07:40.030, Speaker B: We have time for maybe two more questions. Will Price asks, are you planning to incorporate a loss versus rebalancing solution?
00:07:41.570 - 00:08:10.860, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's something that we'd look into sort of I would kick that can further down the line. I definitely just want to make users felt like we hear what their troubles are and we're addressing them. And so I think as part of the first iteration of this, we want to have a solution that appeals to those users such that we're able to pull them in and get that feedback about how we should develop a solution like that.
00:08:12.190 - 00:08:21.230, Speaker B: Last question Benjamin Funk asks. We're seeing a lot of trade execution move upchain with current exchange designs such as Unib Four. What do you make of this shift?
00:08:22.850 - 00:08:59.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I think ultimately this kind of circles back to the whole decentralized exchange stack in that if I can have some market makers offer better price before we get to the AMM, which may have a stale price, I think that's sort of the biggest challenge there is, being able to keep the price real time. There's been studies done that basically say Uniswap is 12 seconds behind finance. So I think this is sort of resolved a bit with faster block times and sort of scalability issues. But yeah. Does that answer your question?
00:09:00.730 - 00:09:04.600, Speaker B: Yes, that's all the time that we have. Thank you so much. Alpha key.
