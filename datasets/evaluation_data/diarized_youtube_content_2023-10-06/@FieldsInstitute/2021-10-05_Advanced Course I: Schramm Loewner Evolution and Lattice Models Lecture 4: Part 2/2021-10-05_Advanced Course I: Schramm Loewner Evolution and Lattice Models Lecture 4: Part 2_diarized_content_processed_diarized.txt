00:00:03.560 - 00:00:32.414, Speaker A: Welcome back everybody. So now we will apply the theorems from the previous hour to the discussion of prime ends. And to simplify the discussion, let me consider bounded domains. But exactly the same will work for unbounded domains. We just consider the spherical message. Details are exactly the same, until. Skip them.
00:00:32.414 - 00:01:29.214, Speaker A: Okay, so the idea is we now trying to do seemingly impossible. We are trying to extend conformal map of the disk to the unit circle. So let's see what would happen. And we start with the lemma, which is due to Kobe, as we discussed or hinted before, if you have a crosscut in the disk, its image might not be a crosscut, because you can start oscillating. And you will see quite a few examples of this later. But if you have a crosscut in the domain in the image, its inverse is a crosscut indeed. And, well, that essentially easily follows from what we discussed about crossed arithmetic.
00:01:29.214 - 00:02:10.274, Speaker A: Let's prove it rigorously, of course. Let's take the spray image and we need to show that the limit when t goes to zero and one exists. That's all we need to show. Remember, crosscut is some arc now in the disk which needs to land at points of the disk. Suppose that, for example, this limit of pre image of gamma t, when t goes to zero, does not exist. So you start oscillating near the boundary of the disk. Well, select two sequences which converge to two different points of the boundary.
00:02:10.274 - 00:02:57.654, Speaker A: They need to go to the boundary. But again, we cannot select near the boundary by lavrientia. For us, extended version of it, diameter of this curve from t to tn prime is at least the one minus z two squared in the limit, because this curve in the limit separates the one and z two. But of course, this diameter tends to zero. So because this was cross cut. So there was a limit when both, uh, tn and tn prime went to zero. So diameter of this tension.
00:02:57.654 - 00:04:12.394, Speaker A: And speaking of technical difficulties, I just got disconnected. So let me see. Okay, we are back. Sorry about this technical difficulty. I promised you in the beginning, remember, that there would be some that was relatively mild. Even recording didn't stop. So some, something I guess happened with my home.
00:04:12.394 - 00:05:16.354, Speaker A: But anyway, we just proved lemma of Kirby, which says that pre image of a crosscut is always a crosscut. This leads us to definition of a chain. So in the beginning, chain just exists in the domain. So, chain is a collection of cross cuts, gamma n's and one of the components of omega minus gamma n, which satisfies the following properties. First, diameter of gamma n tends to zero, and second, is that the domains actually gets, are getting smaller. Dn plus one is subset of Dn. And finally, the third condition is the distance between gamma n and gamma n plus one is positive.
00:05:16.354 - 00:06:07.354, Speaker A: Not only they don't intersect, but the distance is positive. So this collection, for example, this constitutes family of cross cast perimeter. This does not because they land at the same point. Okay, so what is very important here is that we assume that just the diameter of gamma n tends to zero. Diameter of Dn can be huge. And actually in all the non trivial examples that we would consider, it will be huge. Now, we need a notion of equivalence of chains.
00:06:07.354 - 00:07:26.606, Speaker A: So we say the two chains are equivalent if for every n, dn contains all but finitely many Dm primes, and for also for every n, dn prime contains all but finitely many Dm's. So essentially, if you look at every domain defining the crosscut the same, they are essentially the same. And now prime ends would be this equivalency classes of crosscuts. Okay, so first let us try to see why this notion is conformally invariant. And this would be given by this lemma set pre image of a chain. And a conformal map is back is again a chain. And then we'll study pragmatism.
00:07:26.606 - 00:08:17.774, Speaker A: The unit disc, and surprise, surprise, they will be essentially just points on the unit stock. Okay, so proof is the following. We know that f inverse of this gamma n is cross cut by Lavrientev. The diameter of this is bounded by square root of diameter of gamma n. And by Wolf theorem, distance between gamma n and gamma n plus one is positive. Again, y is the case. So here's a little description.
00:08:17.774 - 00:09:02.024, Speaker A: So these are gamma and say gamma n plus one. And suppose that they approach each other. Then there is a small crosscut which would cut them both. So there are two points which are very close. So there will be a crosscut which would separate these points and would have very small length. But then this cross cut intersects both of these curves. And that, that means that the distance between them would go to zero, which is a contradiction.
00:09:02.024 - 00:10:23.104, Speaker A: So by Wolf Lemmer, the distance between them is, okay, and then, now of course inclusion relation is preserved, just like pre image of smaller domains. And of course equivalency relation which as described here is also preserved. So pre image of a primant is also a prime end. Again, in a moment we'll see what are the prime ends in the unit test. Okay, so now the definition, what is the support of primate? If p, a primate support of p is just intersection of the closures of the domain DNS defining the primary. And of course this does not depend on chain because of this inclusion relations closures eventually one would be inside the other and that's where we use the fact that the distance between cross cuts is positive. So not only domains are included but they are closer.
00:10:23.104 - 00:11:37.864, Speaker A: And of course this is a compact connected set but it's not always a point. And now let me finally do some examples. First example is a mega example. That's actually would be the heart of Crassador extension theorem that we will prove that we consider d is our domain and let us consider any prime end. Then I claim that support of this prime end is one point in the desk indeed, because we know that diameter of gamma n tends to zero, distance between endpoints of gamma n tends to zero. So the arc that they bound gets smaller and smaller and its length tends to zero. Let me actually separate this picture from this.
00:11:37.864 - 00:13:20.544, Speaker A: Okay, so for each prime end there is a point on the support. More than that, every such prime end is equivalent to natural prime end that you can take. You can just consider the boundary, consider the point z and consider circles of radius one over n. So if you have a prime end whose a chain rather whose support is z, then this chain is equivalent to the standard chain where gamma n is simply a crosscut which is part of the circle of radius one over n center 30 again because if this, because this domain contains a small neighborhood so and then contains all the small ones and vice versa. If eventually, if your cross cuts would coincide this. Okay, so prime ends. So the whole point of this meta example, probably I should emphasize it, let me highlight it.
00:13:20.544 - 00:14:15.944, Speaker A: This is very important. Also easy example which shows that on the unit disk all the prime ends are naturally associated to the points in the unit circle. But of course in the domains it could be more interesting. For example, let us start with very simple domain. Let us take unidisk and remove this radius zero one. Then the same, exactly the same reasoning as what I just stated would tell us that over each point on the interval you have two prime ends, one at the top. So change approach from the top, another at the bottom.
00:14:15.944 - 00:15:08.914, Speaker A: So this is very natural. Yes, you have two prime ends here. Okay, finally an example where I of p is non trivial. So let us consider domain omega which just would be first quadrant minus all these intervals of length, one at one over j, false j's. And now your gamma ends would be joining n of these intervals somewhere here. Then diameter of this is essentially one over j. So it tends to zero diameter of dn here is at least one.
00:15:08.914 - 00:16:19.854, Speaker A: So that's what our first example of how prime end can be non trivial. Again, so this will be your whole, this whole thing is your gn. And again, diameters not equal to, not tending to zero. And then it's very easy to see that this intersection is just this whole thing. So this prime end corresponds to the interval zero to I. Now let us consider a new, an example which is, I would say on mod rustic. Let's take a quadrant and remove from it first this line of radius one half in the 45 degree direction.
00:16:19.854 - 00:17:15.310, Speaker A: Then cut it by half and remove lines of length one half and so on. If argument is odd number over two to then you remove interval of the length one over two to then over zero. You have uncountably many crosscuts, because to define a crosscut, what you need to do you at each moment you select is a left or right crosscut to go further. And so it's the same as selection from zeros. As usual, over zero there are uncountably many crosscuts. And this is another drastic example. So here, remember the spiral for Wolf's theorem.
00:17:15.310 - 00:18:03.794, Speaker A: So this is unid disk. And then you remove a spiral which spirals to t. Again, simply connect the domain. But then there exists one prime end who supports the whole unit disk. So what you do, you simply consider cross cuts which are smaller and smaller. Because you approach unit discount the domains DNS would be smaller and smaller neighborhoods of the unit circle, more than that. Similar way you can draw a second spiral here.
00:18:03.794 - 00:18:40.664, Speaker A: And then you would have two cross cuts which are supported by the whole unit circle. So such things also can happen. Another classical example. Well, let me not write the formula simply. You have this comp, so you have the things which go closer and closer to each other. Then support of this crosscut is zero one with the whole interval. And here's another way to get the same thing.
00:18:40.664 - 00:20:07.276, Speaker A: Support of this prime end is against this whole zero one because again we take smaller and smaller distances between the lines constitute of the cop. And now we are ready to state what I promised you, this first crossadori extension theorem. So suppose that f is a conformal map from the tormeka than the correspondence between p and intersection of closures of pre images of Dn. It's a bijection between prime ends and the unit circle. So this is in what sense you have this extension. And then of course we'll define the matrix. Well, first, of course we know that f inverse of p is a prime end.
00:20:07.276 - 00:21:11.904, Speaker A: So for every p, there exists unique point which is in this intersection. Now, injectivity, suppose that you have two prime ends which correspond to the same point. What does it mean that their preimages are equivalent. Remember we discussed that if any two prime ends corresponding to the same point of the unit circle like unit, because again, they're both equivalent to the standard circular primate. So preimages are equivalent. Take f, they are the same, they use themselves equivalent. So we are done, the map is injected.
00:21:11.904 - 00:22:46.282, Speaker A: So the most interesting part is subjectivity. Why would you have, for any point, why would you have a crosscut? Take a point psi, and let's find the sequence which converge to this point. Okay, so now there exists a cross cut gamma n such that f inverse of gamma n separates psi and z one from zero. So remember by wolf, we always have a short crosscut, even an image of a circle, a circle, circle arc centered at xi, and the diameter is bounded by constant overlock plus of z one minus xi. So, and again, this is the circular arc. Now by Lavrentiye, this goes to zero, because diameter goes to zero. So rn goes to zero.
00:22:46.282 - 00:23:44.694, Speaker A: Now we select sequence rnk which goes to zero. Then what do we have? We have that this gamma and k with f of this is a primate. So again, that's where I use the fact that I can select circle arcs. So I select circle arcs, they go to zero. I select monoton decreasing subsequence. And then you just got this, gamma and k, the diameter tends to zero, and they are far away from each other because of the construction. And then they are done.
00:23:44.694 - 00:24:19.804, Speaker A: Okay, so that's crossed theorem. Let us play with it. There is a rather embarrassing corollary of this. Remember that prime ants are defined purely geometrical. There is nothing conformal about them. Yet there is the statement for which I don't know, geometrical topological proof. Suppose that you have two non equivalent chains.
00:24:19.804 - 00:25:14.032, Speaker A: Then at some moment they would become disjoint. So if two chains are non equivalent, then starting from some n, dn and dn prime, a disjoint. Okay, so again, I don't know how to prove it directly, but in the clear, direct proof is trivial. Just pull it back to the unit disk. They are not equivalent. So the pullbacks converge to different points. So of course for the pullbacks, eventually pullbacks of DN and DN prime would become disjoint because they converge to different points.
00:25:14.032 - 00:25:48.188, Speaker A: That's it. But I don't know how to do it without cross head or saying, okay, and now more about this extension. Let's do now metric extension. You consider the set of all prime ends. This is called Carthage boundary of the mynomic. And you take omega hat. This is cretaceous compactification of domain omega.
00:25:48.188 - 00:27:12.684, Speaker A: So you just add boundary and you define cursor dorimetric on omega hat to make the compactification. So this is for dumb points in d omega and the two in Omega bar. You can see the shortest cross cut separating the one, the two from double in and exactly as before by Wolf and by Lavrentiev. This map also becomes mapped with bounded below and above models of material. So what Carusadore theorem says is that essentially this map f hat is gameomorphism with control norm between closed unit disk and cross header extension. Okay, so now we'll need, when we talk about Levner chains, next we'll need to talk about very specific type of extension. And that comes from Jordan curves.
00:27:12.684 - 00:28:26.590, Speaker A: So the next area would say that if Omega is a Jordan domain, meaning that joining is a Jordan Kof. Let me actually write it here. Boundary of Omega Jordan. Then there is actually home amorphism between closed disk to close row Omega, which is just an extension of the conformal map between the unit disk and Tomeka. So in a sense, what I am saying that I was just trying to convince you that Euclidean is not good, but Euclidean is not good for general domains. This theorem tells us that even in euclidean metric everything is good. But of course there is no controlled model I of continuity.
00:28:26.590 - 00:29:25.720, Speaker A: That's why even in Jordan domain, for Jordan domains, I would prefer to consider crosshair metric. But again, this continuity up to the boundary would be very important because that would allow us to define f or f inverse at the points of the boundary, which is by itself as great. Okay, so of course we have crescendo theorem. So first thing that we need to check to apply crossado rytherium and get this, the second crossed ethereum. First we need to check that support of every prime end is a single point. So let us check this. So we have this gamma n, it's a crosscut.
00:29:25.720 - 00:30:34.116, Speaker A: It joins alpha t with alpha tn prime. And of course we know that diameter of gamma n times to zero. That means that alpha t and minus alpha tn prime tends to zero. Because now alpha is a parameterization of our boundary, which is homo morphism. So tn minus tn prime also tends to zero and limit of alpha and tn and alpha and tan prime should be the same because the distance stands to zero. It's I of p. Can we use the fact that there is a parameterization of average Jordan curve, which is now we need to show that every point is of the boundary is I of p for some point, for some primary.
00:30:34.116 - 00:31:49.640, Speaker A: That's also very easy. We take Psi in the boundary, we look at the disk of radius 100 and centered at Xi intersected with omega. And you look at the component which contains Xi on the boundary. Of course, intersection of the enclosures is psi. Now where was the crosscut? The crosscut was exactly the part of the boundary of this which contained, which again was boundary of the n. So let me write it here that gamma n would be boundary of dn minus command of the boundary of DNA minus boundary of work. Okay, so that's also easy.
00:31:49.640 - 00:33:04.324, Speaker A: And so now we get carrot area simply by applying previous Caricido Ethereum. Now amazingly enough, this same proof works in slightly more general situation, but the result is weaker. So let me be very precise here. Suppose that omega, it says that boundary is locally connected. So locally connected means that for every epsilon there exists delta such that if we have two points on the boundary and there are delta clause, then there exists a crosscut. Well sorry, not crosscut. Here, a connected subset of the boundary such that z one and z two are at this connect subset and diameter is the napsing.
00:33:04.324 - 00:34:30.304, Speaker A: So it says that any two points which are close enough in euclidean metric can be made close enough in intrinsic distance of the boundary. By the way, by this statement, any Jordan curve is locally connected just by this discussion, because again, you have homomorphism. Now what the theorem is that every conformal map extends to the boundary. More than that, it extends to the boundary if and only if boundary is locally connected. So continuous image of the circle, it's really easy to see that it is locally connected. So one direction is clear and then the other direction is again the same application of Caracador ethereum is exactly the same. And by the way, it shows that why for such domains, caracado arithmetic and Euclidean metric are comparable, maybe with huge concepts.
00:34:30.304 - 00:35:11.154, Speaker A: And again wasn't huge constants, they're not lipsticks to each other. The gauge function between them would be horrible. We just know that if one tends to zero, then the other tends to zero. But that's all we know for locally connected. Okay, so this is actually what we will use when we study the leo chains. We will use this remark. Okay, and now we are ready to move finally closer to what we really need.
00:35:11.154 - 00:36:04.688, Speaker A: We are ready to move to the orgner values. And of course I tried to collect all the results that we would need in geometric functions theory in the previous lecture and the previous part of today's lecture. But of course it's impossible to do everything. So here a few more things that we would need, but they are rather easy. First is the notion of subordination that would be crucial to our understanding of climate change. So suppose that you have two functions which are analytic in the unity. I'm not saying that f is conformal, I just know that g is conformal.
00:36:04.688 - 00:36:57.994, Speaker A: F is just analytic. We say that f is subordinated to g. If you can find fi, which maps unit disk to itself, such that essentially f is the restriction of j, so g composed with phi. So phi is analytic. Map from the unit disk somewhere to a smaller part of it, not necessarily conformal, just analytic. Okay, then equivalently from geometric point of view, it just means that image of f is subset of image of g and they have at zero, they are the same. And the proof is just you consider phi to be g inverse composite f.
00:36:57.994 - 00:38:24.672, Speaker A: So if they are both conformal, as we would have later, then it just means that f maps to smaller domain. That's all. Okay, so some consequences of subordination, which are really easy since phi of z is less than z and fi image of every disk of radius r is subset of image of every disk of radius r and j, because again your every point. So to define a map here, you apply to some point from the disk here because five decreases the size. Second is that because phi prime at zero is less or equal than one f prime is less equal than three prime. Of course. Now by Schwarz Lemma, we know that this is true, that phi prime divided by one minus phi squared is bounded by one minus one over z squared.
00:38:24.672 - 00:39:15.928, Speaker A: And the quality is reached only when you have near bismuth. Remember, that was one of the statements conforming rather invariant statements of floors. And so this means that maximum of one minus z squared f prime of z is bounded by maximum one minus z squared g prime of z. So if either of them is bounded, then the other. So if this is bounded, then this one should be bounded too. And you can also do it inside of this, because one is mapped to the other. Second object that we would need is a class of analytic functions.
00:39:15.928 - 00:40:14.494, Speaker A: Now, so we used to talk, that's why this is a separate discussion. We now talk about analytic functions, not necessarily conformal. And we say that analytic function belongs to class p if it's subordinated to one plus z over one minus z. One plus z over one minus z is a map from the unit disk to the right half plane, which maps zero to one. So this statement is that it just means that p is a function with positive real part and which maps zero to one. That's all the conditions about. Okay, so let's see what our subordination results give us.
00:40:14.494 - 00:41:07.794, Speaker A: Well, first is that we have this, that p of z is bounded above and below by one minus z. One plus z. One plus z over one minus z. Again, this is just because of subordination and the fact that one over p of z is also in p, of course. Second is that p prime of z, again by this discussion, is bounded by two over one minus z squared. So p is locally bounded. So it is normal.
00:41:07.794 - 00:42:02.728, Speaker A: Again, very important observation for us that functions with fixed image of zero and positive real part actually form a normal family. Now, very important property, her gloss representation of function p. So every function in p can be represented as this hair glot integral for some probability measure on the unit circle, and vice versa. Of course, if you have such representation, it's very easy to see that you are in class p. And another very important property. What is the support of p? Support of mirrors. Support of this measurement would be closure of the set on the unit circle where a real part doesn't tend to zero.
00:42:02.728 - 00:42:54.210, Speaker A: So this is, again, if a student of mine, calculus, course, for the right, that I would take off many points, but they're not in calculus. So this means that maybe the limit doesn't exist, but it surely does not equal to zero. So, okay, so rigorous way to write it down, since it's positive. So this is supported on the set where the real part does not converge to zero. The proof is trivial. We just write Poisson representation for real part of p. It's harmonic, positive harmonic function.
00:42:54.210 - 00:44:00.334, Speaker A: So it has Poisson representation. And then take imaginary part, take conjugate, and we just know that the conjugate at zero is zero because p of zero is very much real and equal to one. And then to see that the measure mu is probability, again, real part p of zero, it's still equal to one, and this is the total mass of the measure. So this is just this hair gloss representation is consequence of Poisson representation. Finally, this is also consequence of Poisson representation, because if you have an open interval where real part of p tends to zero, of course, Poisson measure doesn't see this set. Okay, so now, great moment. I can start rigorously define not yet stochastic deterministic Leonard chains.
00:44:00.334 - 00:44:43.134, Speaker A: And so let me start with radial Leonard chains. I call them classical. Well, they're not quite classical, unfortunately. So what Ljovnir considered was slightly different way to state it, but it's one can be easily obtained from the other. So Ljovnir, he worked with class s, so he considered Joe's chains from functions and classes, essentially. So you needed some growing family of domains. Here I will adapt to what we will need for Sramja revolution.
00:44:43.134 - 00:45:33.244, Speaker A: And so this is a radial version of this. And so this is definition of non normalized Leonard chain. First. So this would be a collection of conformal matrix of the unit disk, such that when you are bigger, when t two is bigger than t one f of t two is subordinate to f of t one. Then second is that ft of z is continuous on t, uniformly on compact for everything. So for every t, for every fixed t, you have a conformal map. They are mapping to smaller and smaller domains.
00:45:33.244 - 00:46:19.594, Speaker A: And then the first map should be just identity. And then, so, which means that in particular, that have zero of zero is equal to zero. That means that all of them have zero to zero because of the subordination. But what I also want, I want that at the end, when t goes to infinity, they collapse to zero. So this is called non normalized. So don't normalize it. Now, of course, we can define it in terms of the image of omega, t and f t.
00:46:19.594 - 00:47:08.160, Speaker A: Well, they should all contain zero because zero is mapped to zero. Now, if t two is bigger than t one, da minus smaller, this is equivalent to. So these two things are equivalent to one. Now, you start with d. This is equivalent to this and zero. Well, so here, actually, I made a mistake. Zero does not belong to the interior of the intersection of, which means that eventually they squeeze out zero.
00:47:08.160 - 00:48:01.328, Speaker A: That's why we have. So with respect to zero increased or descent, they would converge to just zero. And then this is this continuity statement that the map t two omega t is carthadori continuous with respect to t. Remember we had, last week, we had geometric characterization of exactly this uniform and compact convergence of conformal maps. This all comes together now. Okay, so this is non normalized flavor chain, two definitions. In terms of conformal map, in terms of squeezing sequence of domains, what would be very important is to look at the complement of omega t.
00:48:01.328 - 00:48:57.764, Speaker A: This would be growing subsets of the unit disk, which we call halves. When we consider chordal cases, they will be even more important than this. Okay, so now let us look at the main example of such non normalized lenor chain slit domain. We consider continuous map from zero infinity to the unit disk such that gamma at infinity is zero. So it's supposed to land at zero. Gamma of zero is on the disk and outside on the circle rather, and OUTside of zero, you Are in the disk. So this is the curve going from boundary to zero.
00:48:57.764 - 00:49:45.166, Speaker A: Now, omega t would be just complement of the curve run up to time t. It satisfies all the conditions here. Zero belongs to omega t. They are getting smaller. Omega zero is d and zero is not in the interior of the intersection, because the intersection again would be just, this intersection of omega t would be just complement of alcal, gamma and zero. But zero is not in this interior. So this, this is satisfied and finally crossed.
00:49:45.166 - 00:50:29.328, Speaker A: Or continuity is easy. Here, you, every time you add a small. So every time you go further, you add a small interval, a small arc. And when you go back, it's very easy to see that what you had Again is just convergence in crypto. So what we can pick is interior approximation or kernel convergence, whatever you prefer. It's very easy to check. Now, kt.
00:50:29.328 - 00:50:52.744, Speaker A: Of course, this growing family of hulls would be just the curve itself. Okay, so this is, it's time for another break. Let's take a break for now. And let's, after the break, I will continue discussing lemur chains and we'll finally normalize them. Now, let me stop the recording.
