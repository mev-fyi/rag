00:00:01.600 - 00:00:04.034, Speaker A: Okay, you can go ahead and.
00:00:07.214 - 00:00:41.624, Speaker B: Good morning or good afternoon for everyone. Today we're going to talk about local resolution of singularities. So the plan is to. Well, we're going to start right away stating what is the theorem that we're going to prove. And then today the plan is to go over maybe 75% of the proof, like the main tools that we are going to use and to finish on Monday. That's the plan. A couple of things about the proof that I have chosen.
00:00:41.624 - 00:00:57.554, Speaker B: It's not the, there's another microphone on. Maybe we can, we could. So the, the proof that I'm going to.
00:00:59.614 - 00:01:00.278, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:01:00.406 - 00:01:25.494, Speaker B: If there's any question, please interrupt any time. So indeed. So the proof that I'm going to do is a little bit of paradox. It's not the usual one that is done for local resolution singularities. And the reason for it is that I'm actually going to take the proof that we do in our monomialization result, which is the next technique that I'm going to talk about. And I'm going to do it sort of like the zero case, which is for functions.
00:01:26.034 - 00:01:27.322, Speaker A: There's no morph in here.
00:01:27.378 - 00:01:59.488, Speaker B: The morph is going to be just a constant morphism. And I'm going to reproduce the exact same, like the same ideas of that proof, but in this context here, in a more simple context of resolution of an ideal. Okay, so that's the plan. So I'll start by saying here, what is the pure. So let q be a quasinality class. And we start in the same way.
00:01:59.656 - 00:02:05.004, Speaker A: M via q manifold.
00:02:08.664 - 00:02:16.064, Speaker B: E containing mix is a simple normal crossing divider.
00:02:18.564 - 00:02:33.964, Speaker A: And we take an idea and privileged. Right.
00:02:34.004 - 00:03:00.634, Speaker B: Our objective is to make this idea of polynomial by bones up. So in this case we are going to do local blue. So the way that I'm going to state it is going to be local in the, in the, in m. So for every point b in m, there exists a neighborhood u of p and a finite family of qomorphism.
00:03:16.834 - 00:03:17.986, Speaker A: Which I'm.
00:03:18.010 - 00:03:39.924, Speaker B: Going to give here, the sort of name that I'm going to use throughout elamina, e lambda, which will go to, um. E restricted to u, which is container E. Touch that.
00:03:44.464 - 00:03:45.964, Speaker A: Maybe right here.
00:03:46.584 - 00:03:49.684, Speaker B: Lambda thumb index set.
00:03:50.464 - 00:03:52.364, Speaker A: I just said it is finite. But.
00:03:54.104 - 00:04:12.874, Speaker B: Let'S put it on the board anyway, such that in three conditions that I'm also going to use from time to time with their numbers. So it's three conditions that I'm going to hold kind of everything everywhere. The first thing is we're going to tell what sigma lambda are. So sigma lambda are composition.
00:04:14.894 - 00:04:15.534, Speaker A: No, sorry.
00:04:15.574 - 00:04:28.414, Speaker B: Is a finite frequency, is the composition sequence.
00:04:34.754 - 00:04:36.214, Speaker A: Of local blowing up.
00:04:41.234 - 00:04:53.932, Speaker B: We recall that local blowing up for us just means metabolism and an open immersion, for example, to restrict ourselves to one of the charts. Actually, this is the main case of a local blowing up. Make a blowing up, restrict to a.
00:04:53.948 - 00:04:54.584, Speaker A: Chart.
00:04:56.404 - 00:05:24.684, Speaker B: Or to a very small set, open set of one of the points on the chart. These are the two main examples that we're going to follow. Two, we want this to be a resolution of singularities, not only avoidance of singularity. So we do need some extra property, some global property of it. And the one that we have is. And it's semi proper. So sigma lambda is a semi proper covering.
00:05:24.684 - 00:05:43.496, Speaker B: So just to point out, it means that if we define the morphine sigma, which goes from the disjoint union of.
00:05:43.520 - 00:05:48.264, Speaker A: The vlombidus to u, where the sigma.
00:05:48.304 - 00:05:57.804, Speaker B: Restricted to v, lambda is equal to sigma lambda. It's not supposed to be here. Then sigma is semi proper, as.
00:06:03.624 - 00:06:03.936, Speaker A: We.
00:06:03.960 - 00:06:11.504, Speaker B: Define the last lecture. And third, and what we want from.
00:06:11.544 - 00:06:19.384, Speaker A: Here, that for every lambda, the pullback of I is one.
00:06:21.764 - 00:06:55.224, Speaker B: So we have indeed one. So one and two are the conditions on the, on the sequence. And three is just going to be that the result that we want to get, after all that this guy is going to be monitoring. I will enjoy here to provide a definition of something that I'm using here. And it's not a problem when I'm talking about a finite sequence of local blinds. Let me add. Compatible with e.
00:06:55.224 - 00:07:20.514, Speaker B: Not a problem when you use local bonus. Compatible with e. That's when the situation that we defined that dysmorphia has had some property over the. Over the. Over the divisors, we were able to write like pairs like this. But in a more general setting, we can also write this for arbitrary morpheus, if the exceptional divisors do satisfy an extra property.
00:07:20.554 - 00:07:24.442, Speaker A: So let me just write this, or we're going to.
00:07:24.578 - 00:07:26.338, Speaker B: We are going to establish this notation.
00:07:26.506 - 00:07:31.994, Speaker A: So if we take DNM, and in.
00:07:33.654 - 00:07:35.634, Speaker B: Normal crossings, dividers.
00:07:38.734 - 00:07:39.634, Speaker A: We say.
00:07:41.374 - 00:07:47.234, Speaker B: That phi from m to n is compatible.
00:07:51.654 - 00:07:51.966, Speaker A: With.
00:07:51.990 - 00:08:02.762, Speaker B: DNE, is the pre image of the divisor in the target is itself a.
00:08:02.778 - 00:08:07.094, Speaker A: Simple normal crossing divisor, contained.
00:08:08.074 - 00:08:10.130, Speaker B: Indeed. So the case of going out is exactly that.
00:08:10.162 - 00:08:10.330, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:10.362 - 00:08:13.050, Speaker B: We take the privacy, such as divisor, we pull it back.
00:08:13.202 - 00:08:14.074, Speaker A: It's a strict transform.
00:08:14.114 - 00:08:35.434, Speaker B: It's still going to be a simple nomicrox device. Of course, we needed a condition that the blowing up was compatible with the divisor, right. That there was no tangency point, otherwise this property is going to be lost. And in this case, in this case we know with a note.
00:08:38.614 - 00:08:39.354, Speaker A: I.
00:08:41.214 - 00:08:42.314, Speaker B: From MD.
00:08:44.294 - 00:08:45.274, Speaker A: To any.
00:08:47.114 - 00:09:15.444, Speaker B: So this is, I guess, enjoy to give this as a more general definition of what this morph is always there supposed to be. So this is the result that we want to improve and maybe just a drawing to have an understanding why it's so important for it to be semi proper. Right. The idea is that we are going to start in our m.
00:09:17.264 - 00:09:17.688, Speaker A: We'Re going.
00:09:17.696 - 00:09:19.552, Speaker B: To have our point b, and then.
00:09:19.568 - 00:09:23.924, Speaker A: We imagine that we have made a local blowing up.
00:09:25.504 - 00:09:30.280, Speaker B: We made a blowing up and we restrict it to a chart. Then what happens is that if you.
00:09:30.312 - 00:09:33.524, Speaker A: Consider a little box here.
00:09:36.064 - 00:09:58.828, Speaker B: Then the concept set, then the projection through this local going up is going to be like a section like this. So it won't cover everything. So the idea is that we need to take enough charts, I do not know how many, but enough charts such that if we cover by more, more.
00:09:58.876 - 00:09:59.464, Speaker A: Terms.
00:10:05.604 - 00:10:07.944, Speaker B: Then we will eventually.
00:10:11.364 - 00:10:11.980, Speaker A: Over an.
00:10:12.012 - 00:10:26.444, Speaker B: Entire neighborhood of that point. So this is why I said that semi proper is the difference between resolving the singularities. So covering everything and just avoiding the singularity.
00:10:26.484 - 00:10:26.684, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:26.724 - 00:10:35.594, Speaker B: Covering. If the problem was in the direction that is not containing this wedge, then we would just be avoiding that point, not what we want to do. We want to recover everything.
00:10:35.894 - 00:10:53.238, Speaker C: Sorry, Andre. In the definition of compatible, compatibleness. Compatibility, you don't require the image of d to be a subset of e because the notation. No, just me to believe in. Okay, so you don't require this.
00:10:53.406 - 00:11:03.414, Speaker B: No, no. Like you can imagine that this could have been empty and I just made a blowing up. And I want to do know the exceptional divisor there.
00:11:05.834 - 00:11:07.254, Speaker C: What could have been empty.
00:11:08.674 - 00:11:12.814, Speaker B: Okay, so I want to include that, that case.
00:11:13.514 - 00:11:14.574, Speaker A: Okay, thanks.
00:11:17.954 - 00:11:50.074, Speaker B: Okay, so now the proof of the result of the local resolution. I'm going to do it kind of in three steps. Like there's going to be three parts that are all of them related. The first one, I'm going to introduce combinatorial techniques. Then we will provide inductive statements.
00:11:57.674 - 00:11:57.986, Speaker A: And.
00:11:58.010 - 00:12:50.330, Speaker B: Then we're going to make a little bit of log caucus. And with all of these three, once we have all of these three things together, then it's going to be, we're going to see, it's not going to be difficult to finish the proof. So the plan for today is actually to introduce these three techniques. Let's see, of like at least the first shoe, possibly the third plan, and then, and then in the next time put everything together to prove the result. So let me start with the one. And here I will consider like the topic, right. So it's going to be very important to consider the exceptional divisor e.
00:12:50.330 - 00:12:55.414, Speaker B: It's going to be all based on this exceptional divisor e. So let's take once and for all a coordinate system.
00:12:55.794 - 00:12:59.454, Speaker A: So let a be a pointing e.
00:13:00.154 - 00:13:17.272, Speaker B: And consider an e adapter. What do we call e adapter? Coordinate theta. So what did that mean?
00:13:17.328 - 00:13:28.376, Speaker A: We wrote it as uv u one ur v one versus such that at.
00:13:28.400 - 00:13:33.488, Speaker B: Least locally, these are the problems of the product of the u equals.
00:13:33.536 - 00:13:34.794, Speaker A: Um.
00:13:36.084 - 00:14:01.508, Speaker B: So the use are the exceptional variables. These are variables that are not exceptional. We see the notation once in parallel. And now the object that we're going to look at. And to make things simpler, I decided to give them a name. It's normally in the literature, it doesn't have a name particularly. But just to make things simpler today I'm going to give it a name.
00:14:01.508 - 00:14:10.524, Speaker B: I'm going to call it a combinatorial ideal. So we say that a privilege ideal.
00:14:17.384 - 00:14:18.764, Speaker A: Is combinatorial.
00:14:23.704 - 00:14:32.504, Speaker B: If for every point a destock, the generators at a point a.
00:14:33.124 - 00:14:41.144, Speaker A: Are actually given by monogamy md where.
00:14:43.644 - 00:14:52.668, Speaker B: Mk is u to the power alpha k where here we are using the multi index notation. So here u one alpha k one.
00:14:52.836 - 00:14:59.754, Speaker A: Product ur alpha kr alpha belongs to NR.
00:15:01.494 - 00:15:08.274, Speaker B: I'm going to establish this, and this is kind of my first goal is to look at this ideal here and to provide a local resolution of singularities for them.
00:15:09.174 - 00:15:12.126, Speaker A: And this we're going to do via.
00:15:12.150 - 00:15:40.954, Speaker B: Combinatorial methods that is going to depend on e. But before entering on what are going to be the blowing up that we're going to do, I just want to introduce a little bit more notation that anticipates this law calculus and which is related to the combinatorial part. Okay, so I'm going to consider. Right, I just wanted to do this little remark before I introduce something else. So being combinatorial.
00:15:48.414 - 00:15:49.954, Speaker A: Is a local property.
00:15:58.534 - 00:16:12.194, Speaker B: If you are combinatorial at a point, then there certainly exists some open set u where you're going to be combinatorial at every other point. A prime.
00:16:25.674 - 00:16:26.946, Speaker A: May be generated by another.
00:16:27.010 - 00:16:55.234, Speaker B: Number, but also by monomials too. The first little remark, it's an open property. And now let's look at the, this is the object that we're going to look. But let's use another rule. It's going to be the differentials that are tangent to the exceptional divisor. So we denote.
00:16:58.974 - 00:17:02.350, Speaker A: By d. The extension.
00:17:02.382 - 00:17:04.994, Speaker B: Of it would be derivations over m.
00:17:06.174 - 00:17:16.364, Speaker A: Minus log v. So the sheath of.
00:17:16.404 - 00:17:33.504, Speaker B: K models of logarithmic franchise differentials, derivatives, derivations.
00:17:36.124 - 00:17:37.664, Speaker A: Yes, that was correct.
00:17:38.204 - 00:17:43.508, Speaker B: So locally, this is maybe the point here.
00:17:43.556 - 00:17:46.532, Speaker A: If you look at the stalk at.
00:17:46.548 - 00:17:47.544, Speaker B: A point a.
00:17:50.004 - 00:17:50.796, Speaker A: This is going to.
00:17:50.820 - 00:17:54.772, Speaker B: Be generated by this pen of derivatives.
00:17:54.788 - 00:18:05.804, Speaker A: Of this one u, one u, one ur, dur, dv, one dv.
00:18:06.784 - 00:18:13.804, Speaker B: So it's logarithmic in respect to e. We call it logarithmic. Right. The reason why it's called logarithmic is that if you do this.
00:18:17.424 - 00:18:17.856, Speaker A: We can.
00:18:17.880 - 00:18:32.694, Speaker B: See that it is equal to u over u and which is equal to one. Just a little remark. That's why we call it logarithmic. And so it means that exceptional variables here are going to always be the derivations which come with the u in front of them.
00:18:34.754 - 00:18:41.882, Speaker A: Okay. And yeah, before even, I'm going to.
00:18:41.898 - 00:19:09.994, Speaker B: Give examples of how this is going to interact with the ideal. But I want to define right away an operation that we can do with this. With an ideal. So we denote by de of I. So we are going to act, make an action of the, of the derivations that we have in this sheave over an ideal sheet.
00:19:10.854 - 00:19:12.354, Speaker A: So the ideal sheath.
00:19:17.094 - 00:19:33.922, Speaker B: Locally generated by. So the, again, space, I think I.
00:19:33.938 - 00:19:40.274, Speaker A: Needed d of e at a point a.
00:19:40.314 - 00:19:46.106, Speaker B: So in here, I'm just going to use this notation. This is a notation to say I'm restricting to the germs that a, instead.
00:19:46.130 - 00:19:49.008, Speaker A: Of like taking here a point a.
00:19:49.056 - 00:20:17.464, Speaker B: To talk about this. Talk, I'm just saying this for stalker a. This is going to be, again the ideal. Even not. Oh, now it doesn't work anymore. Sorry. It's going to have a little, I cannot make mistakes anymore.
00:20:17.464 - 00:20:21.508, Speaker B: For some reason I blocked from time to time my eraser.
00:20:21.676 - 00:20:22.196, Speaker A: Okay.
00:20:22.260 - 00:20:23.524, Speaker B: I won't make mistakes anymore.
00:20:23.604 - 00:20:25.612, Speaker A: That sounds high standard now.
00:20:25.748 - 00:20:26.964, Speaker B: So it's going to be the span.
00:20:27.004 - 00:20:31.984, Speaker A: Of xf, where x is the derivation.
00:20:34.444 - 00:20:58.834, Speaker B: And f is in the stock of the ideal array. So I'm going to take, and this is going to denote this idea generated by everything. Okay, so now that we have these two things, let's see a couple of examples of what is going on here and why we are choosing these derivations in particular. So one of the things that is of interest here is that if we take I a monomial radio.
00:21:08.594 - 00:21:13.162, Speaker A: Then this derivation of e is again going to be.
00:21:13.298 - 00:21:23.134, Speaker B: Maybe I'm going to do a small thing and I'm going to add I, this is going to be equal to m, and I'm going to see why I'm adding I a little bit later on.
00:21:24.034 - 00:21:26.570, Speaker A: But the idea here is just that.
00:21:26.642 - 00:21:37.634, Speaker B: All of the derivation that we have, they are, they are taken in such a way that it's going to leave the, the monomial invariant, right. If we take u k du k.
00:21:38.174 - 00:21:41.510, Speaker A: Of m, this is nothing but alpha.
00:21:41.542 - 00:22:22.320, Speaker B: K, the k entry of alpha times u alpha. And if we take dv dvkl of m, then this is equal to zero. So from these two observations, we see that of course the is contained in the idea y. So I started with y just in case we needed to, just in case. It's just one little difference from the, from the usual case. If, like just to take away a pathological case, if m was equal to.
00:22:22.352 - 00:22:27.564, Speaker A: One and r or s equals zero.
00:22:27.644 - 00:22:53.292, Speaker B: So if there was no derivative in respect to v, then de of I is going to be different than one. It's not going to be equal to one. So this is a little detail that can happen. And if you take all of the derivatives, it never happens. You can just use all of the derivatives and the derivation, not the, only with logarithmic respect to you take all of them, then the derivation of I.
00:22:53.308 - 00:22:55.596, Speaker A: Is always containing I.
00:22:55.700 - 00:24:16.716, Speaker B: But in the case of logarithmic differentials, you can imagine situation where this is not true. Here is one case. And of course, the second situation that is kind of follows in an easy way from this example is if I is combinatorial, then d over I is again equals to y. We have left everything invariant. So if you want to see something which is not invariant, then we are going to use the variables v. So for example, if a actually, if I is generated, say, by v one square plus u one squared, what did I do? For now, u also, then we can compute this, we can compute these derivations, right? We can compute all of them. And in here, the derivative in respect to v, I'm definitely going to include v one.
00:24:16.716 - 00:24:21.260, Speaker B: So let me just note this, easier.
00:24:21.292 - 00:24:30.784, Speaker A: To just note, note that dv one.
00:24:32.484 - 00:24:40.124, Speaker B: V one squared plus u alpha is equal to two times u one. And if we take any.
00:24:42.384 - 00:24:42.880, Speaker A: Of the.
00:24:42.912 - 00:24:45.124, Speaker B: Derivatives with u.
00:24:47.464 - 00:24:52.924, Speaker A: Then we're going to appear here u one u alpha.
00:24:53.864 - 00:24:59.884, Speaker B: So it's not difficult to convince oneself after looking at these two computations that.
00:25:00.664 - 00:25:06.352, Speaker A: Deep plus I in this case is.
00:25:06.368 - 00:25:25.952, Speaker B: Equal to v one u alpha. And if we repeated the process, then we're going to get a unit here. So we're going to finish with this one. Nothing else. But one of the interesting things about this is that we are not changing the order of the monomial. The monomial in u does not change the order. It's preserved.
00:25:25.952 - 00:25:29.552, Speaker B: It's the order of the other variables that is going to change. And this is going to play a.
00:25:29.568 - 00:25:32.374, Speaker A: Role later on, truly.
00:25:46.794 - 00:26:17.414, Speaker B: Now, another definition. So we talked about combinatorial ideals. Just a name, it's not in the literature, but it's a name that I'm giving to this idea as we talk it, about the sheet of derivations. That is something, I have a name, very sheet of derivations. And now we also talk about what are the blowing ups, which are interesting to us, which we're going to call combinatorial. So we say that a blowing up.
00:26:26.374 - 00:26:38.234, Speaker A: From M Tilde into the, to me is combinatorial.
00:26:40.934 - 00:26:42.874, Speaker B: If its center, if the center.
00:26:47.254 - 00:26:53.338, Speaker A: Circumflex of e is equal, even.
00:26:53.386 - 00:27:08.010, Speaker B: Intersection e j, which is in a.
00:27:08.082 - 00:27:19.474, Speaker A: In a index at j, where I recall that Eric was another collection year of irreducible components.
00:27:22.294 - 00:27:30.074, Speaker B: What was the letter that we used the other time? I think it was d. E j.
00:27:31.614 - 00:27:54.834, Speaker A: Is an irreducible as minus component. And this index j is simply a subindex of 1d. Right.
00:27:54.954 - 00:28:00.334, Speaker B: We're taking bowing ups where the center is just intersections of this guy. So locally.
00:28:03.234 - 00:28:06.204, Speaker A: The center tub.
00:28:10.494 - 00:28:22.434, Speaker B: Given by, well, a part of our change of coordinates here, apart from reordering.
00:28:27.174 - 00:28:36.520, Speaker A: You, you are given by the zero locus of.
00:28:36.552 - 00:28:56.584, Speaker B: U one u t, where t is molar equal to r. So of course it doesn't have to be u one u two, u three u three u four up into ut. Could be, for example, u one u three. So that's why I'm saying that apart from reordering, apart from changing the order of them, we can always suppose that it's just the first t entries.
00:28:56.624 - 00:29:00.516, Speaker A: For example, it is just some of.
00:29:00.540 - 00:29:13.428, Speaker B: The intersections of these exceptional devices, nothing else. So this is what we're going to call combinatorial. You know, maybe I'll leave you here.
00:29:13.516 - 00:29:16.532, Speaker A: As an observation, as it can be.
00:29:16.548 - 00:29:31.944, Speaker B: Done as an exercise. If I is combinatorial and the blowing.
00:29:31.984 - 00:29:36.120, Speaker A: Up sequence is also combinatorial, not sequence.
00:29:36.152 - 00:29:53.024, Speaker B: Just out blowing up, then.
00:29:57.244 - 00:29:57.764, Speaker A: The pre.
00:29:57.804 - 00:30:24.402, Speaker B: Image of I is combinator. So it's again generated by some finite number of monomers. You can just verify an easy way that the pullback of, by a combinatorial blowing up of a monomial is again a monomial. And this is going to give you the result. Ah, at every point.
00:30:24.458 - 00:30:24.650, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:24.682 - 00:30:30.854, Speaker B: So you have to make translations so you have to join with the fact that it's open. The property is open.
00:30:32.634 - 00:30:33.534, Speaker A: Okay.
00:30:35.594 - 00:30:37.650, Speaker B: I'll try to keep it here for a while.
00:30:37.802 - 00:30:40.908, Speaker A: And I'm going to state somehow I.
00:30:40.916 - 00:30:47.092, Speaker B: Want to, and I want to state it in this way, I'm going to call it key lemma, although if it's not going to appear in the.
00:30:47.148 - 00:30:49.132, Speaker A: So there's going to be two results.
00:30:49.188 - 00:31:00.144, Speaker B: Now that we're going to prove. There's one that I'm going to call key lemma and a proposition. The proposition is that if I take a combinatorial ideal, I can resolve it by combinatorial blind.
00:31:00.524 - 00:31:01.692, Speaker A: There's going to be a resolution of.
00:31:01.708 - 00:31:24.544, Speaker B: Singularities of it by combinatorial. But before that I want to make some sort of a key lemma which identify the property, that useful property of the relation between the derivations and this combinatorial bones up, which later on we want to generalize two more general sequences bones up which are not necessarily combinatorial. So this key lemma that I'm going to call here key lemma.
00:31:29.924 - 00:31:30.700, Speaker A: Say that.
00:31:30.772 - 00:31:37.884, Speaker B: If sigma is a combinatorial, let me write everything, although.
00:31:49.304 - 00:32:06.140, Speaker A: Is a combinator going up, then I can put down everyone copied already.
00:32:06.252 - 00:32:11.036, Speaker B: If you want to copy, the pullback.
00:32:11.180 - 00:32:20.664, Speaker A: Of the sheath de is now going to be the new sheath of derivation e tilde.
00:32:23.864 - 00:32:34.456, Speaker B: This is going to be a key level later on. So I want to start with a before proving it, I want to start by defining what is the pullback of a derivation.
00:32:34.640 - 00:32:35.272, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:35.408 - 00:32:47.200, Speaker B: And we're going to see like I'm going to only sketch the proof, but I'm going to call here preliminaries. So the first thing is how to like.
00:32:47.232 - 00:32:51.948, Speaker A: So let's b be a point in.
00:32:51.956 - 00:33:20.764, Speaker B: The center of just a point in m and a pointing sigma minus one of b. So we can, maybe there's a whole fiber, we take one of the points, right, and let x be a derivation, any, any derivation actually at the point b. So what we want to define as the pullback. So the pullback.
00:33:27.744 - 00:33:30.924, Speaker A: Of x at a.
00:33:31.904 - 00:34:17.308, Speaker B: Is the derivation, is that derivation? What is the derivation? Sigma star x, which, such as five the following property, sigma star of x applied to the pullback of a function has to be the pullback of x.
00:34:17.396 - 00:34:23.104, Speaker A: Applied to this function for all functions at b.
00:34:26.964 - 00:34:39.763, Speaker B: This is the definition that I'm going to take and I want to look at it at a blowing up which is not in a derivation, which is not going to be tangent to the exceptional divisors to see that there's something to prove and see that this definition.
00:34:39.803 - 00:34:42.587, Speaker A: Is actually what can go wrong.
00:34:42.675 - 00:34:58.103, Speaker B: And I'm going to do this in a very simple, in a very simple case, typical case, which is let's take m equals to r two. Let's take e. Empty. So just two reals, coordinate systems.
00:35:03.904 - 00:35:13.884, Speaker A: Numbers like x and y. We blow up the origin.
00:35:16.504 - 00:35:17.444, Speaker B: And consider.
00:35:21.224 - 00:35:22.484, Speaker A: The x chart.
00:35:24.584 - 00:35:35.504, Speaker B: X equals to u, y equals to uv, right? And let's pull back the derivation given by dx.
00:35:36.404 - 00:35:42.584, Speaker A: We pull back dx.
00:35:43.564 - 00:35:50.580, Speaker B: So the derivation we pull back is going to have entries in the derivation in u and entries in the derivation.
00:35:50.612 - 00:35:54.784, Speaker A: In v. So it's enough for us to compute.
00:35:57.864 - 00:36:22.504, Speaker B: First of all, let me do this matter to compute it over u. So doing this is the same as computing dx over the pullback u is just equal to x. And I will use this formula. It's going to be the pullback of the derivation of x in x. This is one, so this is equal to one.
00:36:24.044 - 00:36:30.012, Speaker A: On the other hand, if we try to do this for v, then what.
00:36:30.028 - 00:36:30.984, Speaker B: We'Re going to get.
00:36:32.884 - 00:36:36.916, Speaker A: Is to pull back not of x and not of.
00:36:36.940 - 00:37:02.174, Speaker B: Y, but of y over x. And when you do this all together, what you're going to obtain is minus y divided by y x square, which is equal to minus v divided by u. So the actual derivation, the pullback of the derivation is not actually a well defined is going to have a pole.
00:37:02.214 - 00:37:06.334, Speaker A: It's going to be du minus v.
00:37:06.414 - 00:37:17.698, Speaker B: Divided by u dv the pole. Here, this gives us an example of a case and we see that something can go wrong.
00:37:17.746 - 00:37:20.186, Speaker A: It's not true that in general the.
00:37:20.210 - 00:37:47.446, Speaker B: Pullback for any blowing up, we're going to have this equality. But for combinatorial blowing up, the claim is that there's not going to be any pull. And better than that, everything is going to stay tungent to the derivations, to the exceptional devices. Okay, so I'm just going to sketch it. So I'll give the main idea. So after these two observations, the sketch.
00:37:47.510 - 00:37:51.874, Speaker A: Is going to be less simple.
00:38:01.294 - 00:38:16.574, Speaker B: Right? So yeah, I'm just going to tell you what is going to happen. Right, so suppose that the center, we could always suppose, right, that this was the zeros of, say, u one uk.
00:38:17.354 - 00:38:25.134, Speaker A: And consider one of the charts, the u one chart.
00:38:26.674 - 00:38:50.360, Speaker B: So the u one chart, we're going to write u one equals to u one tilde. And then we're gonna have ui equals to u one tilde, ui tilde for y, for I equals to two up until t u j equals to uj tilde. For j equals to t plus one.
00:38:50.512 - 00:38:55.084, Speaker A: Up until r and oops, not you.
00:38:58.184 - 00:39:04.668, Speaker B: V jk equals to vdk or k.
00:39:04.716 - 00:39:07.624, Speaker A: Equals to one, two x.
00:39:09.404 - 00:39:11.124, Speaker B: And now the claim that I make.
00:39:11.204 - 00:39:14.556, Speaker A: Claim is that if you do this.
00:39:14.580 - 00:39:45.684, Speaker B: Exact same thing that we did here, if you do this as an exercise like you compute, what is going to be over u one tilde, u two tilde, just write what it is in the transform y divided by x and everything. What we're going to get is that the pullback of u is going to be u one tilde, du one tilde minus I should not have used it. I'm gonna use equals to one to two.
00:39:48.224 - 00:40:06.618, Speaker A: To t, u naught, allq the ul tilde, the pullback of ui, not.
00:40:06.666 - 00:40:17.114, Speaker B: Perfect annotation ui, tilde, dui tilde or I equals to true up until r.
00:40:17.154 - 00:40:18.774, Speaker A: And not only tilde.
00:40:18.964 - 00:40:29.914, Speaker B: That's why I'm saying that's not perfect notation. And the pullback of the dvk is just going to be dvk 4k equals.
00:40:29.954 - 00:40:34.906, Speaker A: To one up to s. So we.
00:40:34.930 - 00:41:12.276, Speaker B: See now that if we take the span of these vector fields, it's going to generate, definitely going to generate ui qiq for every point, DVD k for every one of the directions, but also u one tilde, u one tilde, because I have a linear combination between this, these terms here, which is going to give us u one tilde, u one tilde, and this is going to prove the lemma. Now, an immediate consequence of this lemma, which is actually what is going to be important for us, is that if.
00:41:12.300 - 00:41:17.302, Speaker A: We take the pullback of the derivation.
00:41:17.358 - 00:41:18.154, Speaker B: At I.
00:41:20.214 - 00:41:21.574, Speaker A: Then this is so if.
00:41:21.694 - 00:41:28.726, Speaker B: Let me write it. If sigma is combinatorial, then this is.
00:41:28.750 - 00:41:31.694, Speaker A: Going to be the same as taking.
00:41:31.734 - 00:42:06.724, Speaker B: The derivation of the pullback idea. I'm going to be the same thing as doing that. This is going to be an important consequence for later on and on. The second result that I want to talk, which finishes this part of combinatorics is the proposition here, the first resolution of similarities result, which is.
00:42:10.904 - 00:42:15.004, Speaker A: And I'm going to say like this local resolution.
00:42:15.504 - 00:42:23.684, Speaker B: Of singularities holds for a combinatorial ideal.
00:42:32.204 - 00:42:33.184, Speaker A: If I.
00:42:36.004 - 00:43:05.204, Speaker B: Under the extra condition one prime, which is at the sigma laminar, is a finite composition of combinatorial, local combinatorial, local combinatorial.
00:43:35.084 - 00:43:36.464, Speaker A: Let's catch the proof.
00:43:41.484 - 00:43:52.844, Speaker C: So just before we start, so this one prime is an extra conclusion, right? Not an extra assumption.
00:43:53.144 - 00:43:53.760, Speaker A: Yes.
00:43:53.872 - 00:44:12.524, Speaker B: Let's go back to the theorem, because I'm doing this so that I don't have to write the entire thing. So it means that theorem here holds, but instead of one I'm going to. So here was just a composition of local blowing up and there's going to be extra things, local combinatorial blowing up. So there's something.
00:44:14.224 - 00:44:16.708, Speaker C: So that's, that's a stronger conclusion.
00:44:16.896 - 00:44:17.396, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:44:17.420 - 00:44:18.116, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:44:18.140 - 00:44:20.188, Speaker C: Not a stronger hypothesis.
00:44:20.236 - 00:44:21.500, Speaker B: Ah. Oh, you're right.
00:44:21.532 - 00:44:22.224, Speaker A: I see.
00:44:22.924 - 00:44:25.444, Speaker C: Because you see. Okay, you see what I mean?
00:44:25.484 - 00:44:25.996, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:26.100 - 00:44:28.184, Speaker B: Yeah, I see what you mean. Thanks.
00:44:28.804 - 00:44:32.424, Speaker A: Thanks. Let's.
00:44:45.504 - 00:45:35.804, Speaker B: We'Re going to fetch the proof. So in here, like there are many ways to, so let's just say if we, if we follow the usual way in resolution of singularities, which is viewed up from a global resolution of similarities, we use what is called, we show a simple result about the coefficient ideals of the combinatorial ideals and we argue by induction. But I'm not going to define coefficient ideals. The idea of this local resolution, we're not going to define all of the techniques that are used in global resolution. So I'm just going to give a different proof which is going to look, which is going to use in a strong way the fact that we can be local. So the proof that I'm going to give is not global at all, it's just going to be a local result. But this is what we need for now.
00:45:35.804 - 00:45:47.884, Speaker B: It's going to be more explicit and very elementary. So the first thing is that, where do I start here? So first thing is that we may write.
00:45:50.784 - 00:45:53.924, Speaker A: May find.
00:45:55.944 - 00:45:57.084, Speaker B: A monomial.
00:46:01.344 - 00:46:04.688, Speaker A: Mix such.
00:46:04.736 - 00:46:08.312, Speaker B: That the ideal I is given by.
00:46:08.408 - 00:46:11.864, Speaker A: M and then we have the generators.
00:46:11.944 - 00:46:15.924, Speaker B: Mi md, but with the extra condition.
00:46:17.104 - 00:46:22.816, Speaker A: And there is no common term between.
00:46:22.880 - 00:47:01.384, Speaker B: Them, we factor out the biggest possible monomial that we had from all of these mis. Now I'm going to argue that the essential case for us is d equals two. And this can be done by induction on the number of the, of generators.
00:47:02.004 - 00:47:12.144, Speaker A: So induction in the number of generators.
00:47:19.204 - 00:47:28.674, Speaker B: Of course, if d is equal to one, we're done. So we're going to make the introduction in the number of generations generators. So it's, it's enough.
00:47:34.734 - 00:47:38.806, Speaker A: To consider the.
00:47:38.830 - 00:48:10.244, Speaker B: Case d equal to two, because if we consider the case d equals to two and here we use strongly that we can be local and not global. We may choose two of these monomials and apply our induction for d equals to two. And in the end the pullback of the idea will have d minus one generators. So we may apply induction again. So in here we are using the fact that it's local, so that we can choose normally in global resolution we cannot choose anything. Everything has to be intrinsic. But for local we can, we can do this.
00:48:10.244 - 00:48:29.450, Speaker B: All right, it's not going to pose any problem. So you may choose an issue, make the sequence of lines up that we're going to find here, and then we're going to have t minus one generators and follow up by induction in the number of generators. So this is the essential case. And now we may write in this.
00:48:29.482 - 00:48:30.054, Speaker A: Case.
00:48:35.834 - 00:48:41.094, Speaker B: We may separate u, the u variable in two parts, x and y.
00:48:42.074 - 00:48:43.054, Speaker A: Such that.
00:48:45.734 - 00:49:30.912, Speaker B: M one is equal to x y alpha and m two equals to y beta. Right. We factor out any term that could be common between all of them. And since we only have two, then for sure we can just separate, there's no common term in between them. So we can separate the u coordinate in two parts and write m one equals to x to the power alpha and y equals to the power bet. Now for a pointer b, then we consider, which depends on this, on this way of writing. But it is an invariant after all.
00:49:30.912 - 00:49:32.072, Speaker B: It can be shown that it's an.
00:49:32.088 - 00:49:35.640, Speaker A: Invariant after all, and this is going.
00:49:35.672 - 00:49:39.774, Speaker B: To be for us. I'm going to write like this, p.
00:49:40.714 - 00:49:42.174, Speaker A: Of a of b.
00:49:42.674 - 00:49:47.334, Speaker B: So this is nothing but the number of exceptional components.
00:49:54.234 - 00:49:54.962, Speaker A: At b.
00:49:55.058 - 00:50:02.482, Speaker B: So it's the number r, right? This is also like when we, when we are doing things that is equal to r. Then the second one I'm.
00:50:02.498 - 00:50:05.834, Speaker A: Going to take gamma.
00:50:07.854 - 00:50:13.554, Speaker B: Of b. This is nothing but the max, not the maximum, the minimum.
00:50:16.054 - 00:50:24.774, Speaker A: The minimum between the alpha and the beta and then delta b.
00:50:24.814 - 00:50:38.764, Speaker B: And this one is going to be the maximum, it's the maximum. And then my claim, the claim here.
00:50:38.804 - 00:50:39.384, Speaker A: Is.
00:50:42.564 - 00:50:44.544, Speaker B: If we choose the center.
00:50:59.224 - 00:50:59.964, Speaker A: Well.
00:51:02.984 - 00:51:03.924, Speaker B: This environment.
00:51:10.224 - 00:51:17.124, Speaker A: Decreases at every point a.
00:51:17.704 - 00:51:57.724, Speaker B: In the prey image of b. So choosing the environment well is just because I want to leave the general claim as an exercise and then choosing the center depends on the entries of alpha and beta in some way, which I'm going to leave as an exercise and I'm going to just prove the claim. But there's no choice of center. That is, there's no reason to choose a center differently. But just to see the computation that appears, I'm going to do indicator I equals to two. So x and y are just one variable. We treat the k z true.
00:51:59.384 - 00:52:16.680, Speaker A: So x y, our distinct variables are right, like this should be a non.
00:52:16.712 - 00:52:28.814, Speaker B: Multivariable, and now there's no choice. We just blow up this center. There's only one combinatorial center that is not an anisomorphism, it's the center given by x and y.
00:52:29.314 - 00:52:42.134, Speaker A: So we blow up with center d of xy.
00:52:44.854 - 00:52:59.874, Speaker B: Consider the u chart, the x chart, x equals u, y equals uv.
00:53:01.014 - 00:53:03.950, Speaker A: Then we have that the pullback of.
00:53:03.982 - 00:53:04.754, Speaker B: M one.
00:53:06.454 - 00:53:08.790, Speaker A: Is going to be u.
00:53:08.822 - 00:53:24.334, Speaker B: To the power alpha, which is also u gamma, where this gamma. And let us know, gamma b equals gamma, u gamma times u alpha minus gamma.
00:53:24.754 - 00:53:27.914, Speaker A: And the pullback of m two, this.
00:53:27.954 - 00:53:41.434, Speaker B: One is going to give us u beta v beta, which is u gamma. U beta minus gamma.
00:53:45.774 - 00:53:48.274, Speaker A: E beta. Right.
00:53:49.254 - 00:53:50.478, Speaker B: So now it should tell you that.
00:53:50.566 - 00:53:57.750, Speaker A: If the minimum between the two of them was alpha, if gamma equals to.
00:53:57.782 - 00:54:04.284, Speaker B: Alpha, then we're done, right? This is alpha minus gamma. So we are factoring off u gamma from both.
00:54:05.384 - 00:54:07.368, Speaker A: We're going to get, we're done.
00:54:07.416 - 00:54:09.524, Speaker B: So if gamma is equal to alpha.
00:54:09.944 - 00:54:10.684, Speaker A: Then.
00:54:13.504 - 00:54:22.284, Speaker B: I didn't say what the point is, right? Sorry about this. Uv is centered.
00:54:24.184 - 00:54:25.272, Speaker A: At a point a.
00:54:25.368 - 00:54:26.604, Speaker B: After the blowing up.
00:54:26.904 - 00:54:27.576, Speaker A: Sorry about this.
00:54:27.600 - 00:54:36.354, Speaker B: Then the, the environment here, the gamma a is certainly going to be zero. So we're done.
00:54:40.654 - 00:55:08.994, Speaker A: Otherwise, oops. If gamma was equal to beta then in this case here we, well this.
00:55:09.034 - 00:55:17.854, Speaker B: One became alpha minus gamma. So then we get that m one, we have u gamma.
00:55:19.794 - 00:55:37.762, Speaker A: U alpha minus gamma and the m two is going to be u gamma e beta. So in this case, and we might not be able to conclude that gamma.
00:55:37.938 - 00:56:07.486, Speaker B: A is strictly smaller, but it is certainly smaller or equal because beta was the minimum between the two. And it's appearing here too, but the maximum has decreased. Finally, like that's the thing that I didn't say. So we made this blowing up. I look at one of the charts, I look at, at the center of.
00:56:07.510 - 00:56:10.854, Speaker A: This chart and we made this computation.
00:56:10.894 - 00:56:25.934, Speaker B: We said, okay, the environment has dropped. Now if we consider any other point of the chart. So that's the drawing that I should have made. We made the extra blowing up with the center.
00:56:26.274 - 00:56:33.494, Speaker A: So here was u, here's v, right.
00:56:34.114 - 00:56:38.234, Speaker B: And we fixed our point here. But if we take any other, a.
00:56:38.274 - 00:56:43.670, Speaker A: Prime in the exceptional divisor, for a.
00:56:43.702 - 00:57:24.154, Speaker B: Prime, the number of terms of the exceptional divisor has dropped. The invariant has also dropped. So that's why if you take any other point besides the origin of that blowing up, the environment has gone down. Otherwise the environment is still the same. The first part of the invariant is still the same, the same number of exceptional components at that point, but one of the other two has dropped. So infinite number of steps we're going to get that. This environment has to, has to draw, has to go down and of course, if it is, if the number of spectrum components is one, we're done.
00:57:24.154 - 00:57:31.294, Speaker B: It's a monomial. And if this guy is zero, we're also done. So eventually are going to be done with this method.
00:57:37.414 - 00:57:38.314, Speaker A: Okay.
00:57:40.894 - 00:57:42.514, Speaker B: Could I do a little pause?
00:57:45.894 - 00:57:49.634, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
00:57:51.054 - 00:57:52.434, Speaker C: Did you say.
00:57:52.774 - 00:58:21.534, Speaker B: Yeah, you, you people want a little pause? Maybe. Maybe we can do a. So afterwards I'm going to start by doing the active statement. Like this finishes the part of combinatorics. So maybe let's give five minutes pause. So to restart at 415 so that we have time to. You said briefly that the case in two variables.
00:58:21.534 - 00:58:23.946, Speaker B: If we understand the case in two variables, it's okay.
00:58:24.010 - 00:58:24.474, Speaker A: Right?
00:58:24.594 - 00:58:34.096, Speaker B: You said something like that briefly, but you can do the other by exercise. Yes. Okay. So. But it's not direct, it's not complicated. That's what I mean. Okay.
00:58:34.240 - 00:58:35.004, Speaker A: Okay.
00:58:36.744 - 00:58:37.664, Speaker B: That's what I mean.
00:58:37.784 - 00:58:39.164, Speaker A: Okay, thank you.
00:58:39.504 - 00:58:47.176, Speaker B: You know, there is something to do. Okay. Right. Yes, that was my point. Yeah. Not totally immediate. Immediate.
00:58:47.176 - 00:58:56.044, Speaker B: No, no. I thought that it was a good idea. Like when I was a student. I like it when I, when I had exercise.
00:58:56.504 - 00:58:58.268, Speaker A: Right. No, you're right. Yeah.
00:58:58.396 - 00:59:14.824, Speaker B: To give some exercise. So I know that there's PhD students and product that maybe not would be shy in asking questions, and then they can ask.
00:59:18.044 - 00:59:18.860, Speaker A: Okay, maybe.
00:59:18.892 - 00:59:19.444, Speaker B: Let's restart.
00:59:19.484 - 00:59:23.344, Speaker A: Amana, it's okay, I've started recording it.
00:59:27.624 - 00:59:28.728, Speaker B: Okay, it started.
00:59:28.896 - 00:59:31.296, Speaker A: Yeah, you can go ahead. Thank you.
00:59:31.440 - 00:59:55.936, Speaker B: Okay, so let me continue. So now I'm going to talk. We finished this combinatorial part. We proved these two results, this key of Emma and the proposition. And now I want to make the inductive steps of what we're going to, what we're going to prove. And with this inductive steps, we're going to motivate the use of the, the log calculus. So let's start here.
00:59:55.936 - 01:00:04.444, Speaker B: And I'm actually going to prove the result. I know that this seems like a big simplification, but we prove.
01:00:06.544 - 01:00:07.404, Speaker A: The result.
01:00:09.944 - 01:00:18.284, Speaker B: For the ideal generated by one function, the general case. I'm going to actually write this.
01:00:18.634 - 01:00:22.082, Speaker A: So the general case is not actually.
01:00:22.218 - 01:01:02.724, Speaker B: Harder, but it's harder notation wise. And I feel that the idea that the ideas are going to be completely more transparent if we focus on this case and then it becomes, well, an exercise of generalizing it to the case of. But there's many, many functions, but it's going to be very, very similar in any case. Okay, so we're going to focus on this and we're going to step some notation so I'm going to start so that we can use in a constant way. So I'm going to make here a little.
01:01:07.104 - 01:01:12.232, Speaker A: Actually. Yeah, I wanted to have that.
01:01:12.328 - 01:01:13.804, Speaker B: So let's do like this.
01:01:17.224 - 01:01:21.592, Speaker A: Let's fix, m is going to be.
01:01:21.608 - 01:01:59.864, Speaker B: The dimension of our variety and we fix a zero in m. Now come back to this notation in a bit, just fixing the point more. So let's write here what is going to be your first step. So this is going to have three inductive steps. And I'm putting m is a dimension, right? So apart from a family.
01:02:09.424 - 01:02:10.416, Speaker A: Sigma lambda.
01:02:10.480 - 01:02:11.444, Speaker B: Satisfying.
01:02:15.904 - 01:02:18.792, Speaker A: One prime and two.
01:02:18.848 - 01:02:27.324, Speaker B: So I recall two was that it was semi proper, one prime was that was composition of local combinatorial is up for every point.
01:02:30.264 - 01:02:59.330, Speaker A: Which belongs the prime image like this for now of a zero. Either we are done, nothing else to do, or there is a nice normal.
01:02:59.362 - 01:03:04.174, Speaker B: Form, there is e adopted.
01:03:07.754 - 01:03:13.194, Speaker A: Adapted coordinate.
01:03:13.234 - 01:03:25.054, Speaker B: System u v. And I'm going to distinguish one variable, w.
01:03:26.974 - 01:03:30.874, Speaker A: Which is not exceptional, such that.
01:03:33.334 - 01:03:37.150, Speaker B: The pullback of f is now going to be given by.
01:03:37.182 - 01:03:56.166, Speaker A: U, some gamma, some monomial which multiplies w to the power d f tilde vw plus e equals zero to d.
01:03:56.190 - 01:04:02.830, Speaker B: Minus one AI uv, which is independent.
01:04:02.862 - 01:04:07.630, Speaker A: Of w w. This is the first.
01:04:07.662 - 01:04:09.634, Speaker B: Thing I want to first step.
01:04:11.494 - 01:04:15.834, Speaker A: Where of course, this f.
01:04:17.554 - 01:04:18.934, Speaker B: At a one.
01:04:19.434 - 01:04:20.894, Speaker A: Is different from zero.
01:04:21.274 - 01:04:25.170, Speaker B: These AI's at a one are equal.
01:04:25.202 - 01:04:27.330, Speaker A: To zero and f two.
01:04:27.362 - 01:04:49.954, Speaker B: The nai are in the quad analytic class. We want that. So this is some sort of weak Weiss transform. It's not a viceroy form, because it's not a polynomial. It's not a unit times a polynomial. The unit is here multiplying w to the some big term here d.
01:04:51.734 - 01:04:51.998, Speaker A: And.
01:04:52.006 - 01:05:16.590, Speaker B: I want to come back to the notation, and just so that we can use in a little bit more free way this, I want to use this in the notation wise. I want to consider the union of this vlog that we had constructed, right. The family Sigma lambda was morphine from.
01:05:16.622 - 01:05:20.294, Speaker A: V lambda to m. So let's just.
01:05:20.334 - 01:05:29.434, Speaker B: Call this one v one, the union of this a lambda e one.
01:05:30.094 - 01:05:34.046, Speaker A: And let's consider sigma one as the.
01:05:34.070 - 01:05:37.524, Speaker B: Morph is given by, well, v one.
01:05:38.544 - 01:05:43.536, Speaker A: To m such that sigma one restricted.
01:05:43.560 - 01:05:49.644, Speaker B: To v lambda was a sigma lambda. And finally, we also take e one.
01:05:51.384 - 01:06:00.204, Speaker A: Not going to be a problem later on with the first pullback of I.
01:06:00.904 - 01:06:07.634, Speaker B: Okay, so if with this notation it becomes a little bit easier to write, because now we can just write here.
01:06:08.334 - 01:06:09.914, Speaker A: Sigma one.
01:06:14.134 - 01:06:16.702, Speaker B: As monomania, or there exists.
01:06:16.758 - 01:06:23.942, Speaker A: A one adapter coordinate system such that this happens.
01:06:24.078 - 01:06:57.710, Speaker B: Okay, so it's just a way to write it that's going to be a little bit easier, and I'm going to use this notation in the same way for the next step. So now I'm going to fix a one and I'm going to go over it with a point a two, and with a morph, Sigma morphin, sigma two doing the exact same things, it's just going to be easier to restate. But before doing that, I want to just set some sort of claim that this number D here is going to play an important role for us.
01:06:57.742 - 01:07:01.056, Speaker A: So I want to set it in a special way.
01:07:01.080 - 01:07:08.624, Speaker B: I want to set the following. We set me at this point a.
01:07:08.664 - 01:07:15.364, Speaker A: One of e, one of I, one.
01:07:15.944 - 01:07:26.754, Speaker B: Equals to d. Now, this setting here is a little bit has to be said. It will be an invariant.
01:07:33.214 - 01:07:33.894, Speaker A: Because in.
01:07:33.934 - 01:07:44.554, Speaker B: Here, I'm not using any dependence on the coordinate systems if we consider.
01:07:46.854 - 01:07:51.574, Speaker A: The minimalist in respect.
01:07:54.434 - 01:07:57.294, Speaker B: To all coordinate adaptive coordinate systems.
01:08:15.314 - 01:08:16.578, Speaker A: But as we're going to see later.
01:08:16.626 - 01:08:48.785, Speaker B: There'S going to be a better way to define this invariant just in terms of the log differentials. And we're going to get that it's in a VAR, like it's going to be an environment in a very direct way. We don't, we don't have this kind, we don't have to use actually this kind of kind of thing. I just want to give it a name for now, using inductive steps and afterwards, actually going to be a precise environment that we're going to, we're going to keep tracking this induction step, but for now, it's already enough just to look at this d here. Invariant.
01:08:48.969 - 01:08:49.809, Speaker A: Sorry, Andre.
01:08:49.921 - 01:08:54.729, Speaker B: So invariant means independence of the coordinate system, right? Yes, that's what it means.
01:08:54.761 - 01:08:55.025, Speaker A: Yes.
01:08:55.089 - 01:08:55.417, Speaker B: Okay.
01:08:55.465 - 01:08:56.945, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Yeah.
01:08:56.969 - 01:09:18.064, Speaker B: So in here, I can do it artificially by taking all possible coordinates, change and fixing it. But we're actually going to see that there is going to be an intrinsic way that only depends on the derivations. So the step two is the following. So apart from a family.
01:09:20.804 - 01:09:21.212, Speaker A: And now.
01:09:21.228 - 01:09:23.344, Speaker B: I'm simply going to call sigma two.
01:09:25.004 - 01:09:26.104, Speaker A: Satisfying.
01:09:28.684 - 01:09:32.944, Speaker B: One and two. So in here, we are not only doing combinatorial bizarre.
01:09:34.644 - 01:09:35.524, Speaker A: I didn't say that.
01:09:35.564 - 01:09:36.212, Speaker B: Fix.
01:09:36.388 - 01:09:50.204, Speaker A: Sorry, fix a one in maybe one. Again, recognize.
01:09:53.304 - 01:09:54.724, Speaker B: For every a two.
01:09:57.184 - 01:09:57.472, Speaker A: In.
01:09:57.488 - 01:10:07.864, Speaker B: The pre image of a one, we may suppose. Enough, you know, we may suppose.
01:10:10.964 - 01:10:11.300, Speaker A: This.
01:10:11.332 - 01:10:16.244, Speaker B: Normal form is actually better. It's going to be given by some.
01:10:16.284 - 01:10:19.664, Speaker A: U to the power gamma monomial.
01:10:19.964 - 01:10:21.664, Speaker B: It starts the same way.
01:10:29.164 - 01:10:33.244, Speaker A: And now it's going to be a new alpha I.
01:10:33.284 - 01:10:46.596, Speaker B: So some monomial multiplying bi uv wi from zero to d minus two. So there are two differences.
01:10:46.660 - 01:10:47.264, Speaker A: Here.
01:10:52.204 - 01:10:52.644, Speaker B: You go.
01:10:52.684 - 01:10:53.304, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:10:54.004 - 01:11:02.632, Speaker B: The d minus two before it was d minus one. And now we have these terms here instead of the AI's. So I need to precise what are.
01:11:02.648 - 01:11:06.204, Speaker A: The difference here and.
01:11:12.064 - 01:11:20.404, Speaker B: Where again, f circumflex of a two is different from zero, it's a unit. And either.
01:11:22.224 - 01:11:30.552, Speaker A: Bi of a two is different from zero, or there's nothing there.
01:11:30.608 - 01:11:48.680, Speaker B: Actually, or bi was equivalent of zero. And of course we have the, we have the last coordinates, the last PI's, f cubed and vi are in the set c. So we're going to have.
01:11:48.712 - 01:11:54.854, Speaker A: This form of preparing the normal form.
01:11:54.894 - 01:12:03.474, Speaker B: That we have here. So we obtain some viceroy's form and then we prepare it, it becomes like this, Monono times wy. And finally, so fix.
01:12:07.174 - 01:12:10.334, Speaker A: A two in v two.
01:12:10.454 - 01:12:19.494, Speaker B: And the last induction statement that we're going to make, and I'm going to make the next page, although it's quite nowadays. Yeah, we're gonna do in the next.
01:12:20.834 - 01:12:21.614, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:12:27.834 - 01:12:29.134, Speaker B: So again, a far.
01:12:32.034 - 01:12:33.134, Speaker A: From a family.
01:12:35.314 - 01:12:36.974, Speaker B: Let'S call it sigma three.
01:12:39.354 - 01:12:39.906, Speaker A: Such as.
01:12:39.930 - 01:12:40.614, Speaker B: Fine.
01:12:42.394 - 01:12:44.654, Speaker A: One and two.
01:12:45.034 - 01:13:04.946, Speaker B: It's going to be very close to being combinatorial, but not really. There's going to be a, it would be combinatorial if w equals zero was an exceptional divisor. So we're going to actually enforce this as we're going to see almost combinatorial, but not exactly. So, apart from a family, which is a local sequence of lines up, which.
01:13:04.970 - 01:13:08.494, Speaker A: Is any proper for every.
01:13:14.834 - 01:13:39.438, Speaker B: A three in the prime image of a two. Now, this environment that we just defined is d that we just defined. So here is going to be e three. E three is going to be strictly.
01:13:39.486 - 01:13:45.594, Speaker A: Smaller than the invariant at h o.
01:13:47.894 - 01:13:54.234, Speaker B: So let's try to understand what this means, the consequence of that. We're saying that after.
01:13:54.974 - 01:13:55.766, Speaker A: So let's go back.
01:13:55.790 - 01:14:23.934, Speaker B: So we started with a sequence of lines up that gave us a d here, a d that appeared here, and we said, well, apart from making change of coordinates, we can assume that it's minimum respect to exchange of coordinates. It's going to be an invariant we call by this name now in the step two, and I can say this, we are not going to change this d. So, and maybe this is going to be helpful. I didn't write in my notes, but I now realize that it could be helpful.
01:14:24.414 - 01:14:29.714, Speaker A: This is equal to a one e one.
01:14:30.774 - 01:14:53.814, Speaker B: We didn't change the d is going to be the same. We just keep this d the same. And now by using the step three, we get that, it decreases. So now the d decreases. If it goes to zero, then we are done. Because if d is equal to zero, it means that this function is just u gamma times the unit. So it's a monomial.
01:14:53.814 - 01:15:30.262, Speaker B: Otherwise, with this positive, we can just apply step two and step three once after the other up until we're at most d times step two and step three up until this environment has to be equal to zero. So this shows that if we do this, if we prove these three steps inductively, we are going to be able to finish the proof. The proof is going to follow. By first applying this, we get our normal form. We prepare the normal form, we decrease the environment. We prepared a new normal form. We decrease again the invariant at most D times.
01:15:30.262 - 01:15:52.154, Speaker B: We're going to get to zero. If we get to zero, this is the momentum. Okay, so this is the plan. Andre? Yes. Sorry. Isn't this a three in sigma three minus one of a two? Thank you.
01:15:54.854 - 01:16:00.554, Speaker A: What's not so?
01:16:01.094 - 01:16:07.022, Speaker B: My bar here doesn't like when I make, make mistakes and wants to show to the world that I made a.
01:16:07.038 - 01:16:11.460, Speaker A: Mistake, it doesn't allow me to, to.
01:16:11.492 - 01:16:15.784, Speaker B: Change from time to time to the eraser for some reason that I don't get it.
01:16:23.204 - 01:16:24.444, Speaker A: Yeah, but you're right.
01:16:24.524 - 01:16:25.464, Speaker B: Sigma two.
01:16:31.324 - 01:16:41.096, Speaker A: Oh, now I got a more serious problem. Right.
01:16:41.280 - 01:16:42.488, Speaker B: Yes. Thanks.
01:16:42.576 - 01:16:48.844, Speaker A: Thanks. Now it works.
01:16:50.744 - 01:16:52.644, Speaker B: I probably touched something in there.
01:16:53.584 - 01:16:54.444, Speaker A: Anyway.
01:16:57.224 - 01:17:05.324, Speaker B: I just want to, before turning to the last point, I just want to make a little comment about the logic and about what we can do and what we don't do here.
01:17:05.364 - 01:17:07.144, Speaker A: Right. So.
01:17:10.084 - 01:17:33.124, Speaker B: How much space do I need for this drawing? Maybe we can do it here so that it's thick. So we are starting with a point b in the beginning. And I just want to make a comment about this whole step process. Right. And we applied one of these steps. We apply the step one. So we got some covering here.
01:17:33.124 - 01:17:38.804, Speaker B: And we have the fiber of b.
01:17:39.584 - 01:17:40.724, Speaker A: The fiber.
01:17:46.304 - 01:18:21.356, Speaker B: Now, the logic that we are using is the following. For each point a one, we are saying we are going to find a finite family of local points up, which is semi proper. And that if we compose all of this, like, the logic that I'm going to use here is the composition of the same logic. But let's say that after this composition of this local point z for every a one, I am able to get. So I'm able to get ammon harmonization of I. So after this sequence, I'm able to.
01:18:21.380 - 01:18:23.744, Speaker A: Get homomization of.
01:18:27.364 - 01:18:31.584, Speaker B: Power and.
01:18:36.564 - 01:18:37.308, Speaker A: Sigma two.
01:18:37.356 - 01:19:04.604, Speaker B: Composed with sigma one star, sorry, the opposite sigma one composed of sigma three star y is one. Now, the comment that I want to make is that we did this for every a one and recovered. But now being monomial over, the exceptional divisor over the fiber is a local property. So this is actually true for opensets. And we do know that.
01:19:06.744 - 01:19:07.256, Speaker A: If we.
01:19:07.280 - 01:19:26.316, Speaker B: Take here, did you check it? If we take here a sufficiently small, relatively compact open neighborhood, then it can clover by relatively compact open neighbors here, because it's semi proper, whose image is.
01:19:26.340 - 01:19:29.064, Speaker A: Going to be this set.
01:19:29.564 - 01:19:43.584, Speaker B: So what we are saying is that the pullback of this entire set over here is going to be monomial. So actually, when we say that we fix a point and we have resolved the singularity, we obtain that this monomial, I didn't say completely.
01:19:46.684 - 01:19:48.916, Speaker A: In sigma two.
01:19:48.940 - 01:20:06.228, Speaker B: Minus one over a one local property, we actually get that it's going to be monomial over an open set of this a one. And now we can do the same, the same, the same trick, like the same logic again.
01:20:06.356 - 01:20:09.202, Speaker A: And we say, okay, so there is.
01:20:09.218 - 01:20:30.162, Speaker B: A way to cover here with some open sets where this property is still valid, where we still enable that over this U set, over this red set, I'm still able to resolve, and which is sent to a relatively compact open.
01:20:30.218 - 01:20:33.658, Speaker A: Neighborhood of b, and I can cover.
01:20:33.706 - 01:21:06.094, Speaker B: By a finite number of these little balls. So it's because of that, that the composition of this argument is enough. So that's why I'm not saying the size of the open sets in each one of the steps, I'm just saying I will fix a point and I will continue, because in the end, I can always use this semi properties at the end, and the fact that the beam monomer is a local property in order to get the open set that we wanted in the beginning.
01:21:08.154 - 01:21:08.770, Speaker A: This was.
01:21:08.842 - 01:21:38.990, Speaker B: A comment that I wanted to make about the induction strategy and why we are able to always fix a point after the sequence lines up, but we have to prove for all points after it. So that's why it's for all points. Okay, now that I talk about this logic, I want to talk a little bit about log differential calculus, and in particular to define this invariant here, but.
01:21:39.022 - 01:21:42.326, Speaker A: In a, in an intrinsic way, so.
01:21:42.350 - 01:22:17.174, Speaker B: That we see what is going to play a role for part three. So the center of here is some sort of analogous of the order of an ideal when we consider all of the derivations. So we're going to do the analogous of it.
01:22:33.094 - 01:22:39.782, Speaker A: And you see, now the notation is.
01:22:39.798 - 01:22:46.474, Speaker B: Going to be a little bit heavy, but I wanted to do it, there's ways to do it less heavy, but I wanted to keep it.
01:22:48.244 - 01:22:48.788, Speaker A: So that.
01:22:48.836 - 01:22:51.204, Speaker B: The exceptional divisor does appear here.
01:22:51.244 - 01:22:53.372, Speaker A: We know that this will depend on.
01:22:53.388 - 01:23:13.184, Speaker B: An exceptional divisor where ek plus one or either is equal to the previous.
01:23:13.264 - 01:23:19.564, Speaker A: One plus those derivatives apply to it.
01:23:22.464 - 01:23:51.310, Speaker B: So it's, if we know if you're used with the usual differentials like this is the way to define the order of an ideal. You just derive sometimes, and at some point it becomes a unit, the point that becomes a unit. This is the order of the idea. So in here we're going to do the same, but we are going to only take the derivatives which are tangent to the exceptional divide. We're going to keep track of these exceptional divides. And since we are quad analytic and there's no nonspherianity, we're also going to.
01:23:51.342 - 01:23:56.874, Speaker A: Consider that u infinity of e b.
01:23:58.254 - 01:24:31.084, Speaker B: The sum of u k v pertain the naught. We define this idea here. And now that we are in this situation, we are ready to define what is the environment we're talking about. We say that so to use space. So the environment we're going to define like a given a.
01:24:41.564 - 01:24:45.188, Speaker A: E of PI.
01:24:45.316 - 01:25:04.222, Speaker B: So that's why the e was appearing there, because it's going to do the depend on the derivatives here depend on e is going to be the mean alpha kick, the natural positive infinity, such.
01:25:04.278 - 01:25:04.874, Speaker A: That.
01:25:19.054 - 01:25:22.062, Speaker B: We have stabilized. So if we take the germ at.
01:25:22.078 - 01:25:24.670, Speaker A: That point, this is going to be.
01:25:24.782 - 01:26:01.234, Speaker B: Equal to the germ of the infinity one. So if remark if q is material, if qa is a little theorem, local ring, for example, if qe is an analytic, the class of analytic functions, then mi of e is always smaller than.
01:26:01.894 - 01:26:04.950, Speaker A: Infinity, it's always finite.
01:26:05.142 - 01:26:30.408, Speaker B: In the quasi analytic case, we don't know, right? We don't know if it's no theorem. So we don't know if the sequence of ideals is going to stabilize or not. So we might have to admit the case that this invariant here is going to be infinite. And part of the proof of the things that we're going to do, maybe not today, we'll see how far we're going to get, is that this environment that we're defining here is the same.
01:26:30.456 - 01:26:32.680, Speaker A: One as the one that is appearing.
01:26:32.712 - 01:26:35.004, Speaker B: Here with this d, with this viceroy's form.
01:26:36.824 - 01:26:37.964, Speaker A: Let's get there.
01:26:41.464 - 01:26:44.604, Speaker B: So let's start by some examples.
01:26:47.804 - 01:26:48.140, Speaker A: Of.
01:26:48.172 - 01:27:07.172, Speaker B: What is going on. So I wanted to do, right. So the first thing is that why does this invariance is not. Why did I say that we need to make changes of coordinates, right? Because we might have chosen them. So take I equals to the function.
01:27:07.228 - 01:27:10.824, Speaker A: F, where f is going to be.
01:27:11.184 - 01:27:13.216, Speaker B: W to the power d as before.
01:27:13.320 - 01:27:17.164, Speaker A: But plus v one.
01:27:18.184 - 01:27:36.924, Speaker B: So in this case, if we just derive once, we're going to obtain one, right, because no effect dv one of f, this is equal to one. So when we sum, when we take.
01:27:37.544 - 01:27:47.536, Speaker A: I plus d, sorry, of I, this.
01:27:47.560 - 01:27:49.364, Speaker B: Is for sure just going to be.
01:27:50.184 - 01:27:55.904, Speaker A: Del one, which implies that this invariant.
01:27:55.944 - 01:27:57.528, Speaker B: That we, that we are looking at.
01:27:57.616 - 01:28:02.456, Speaker A: The me at the point a of this idea.
01:28:02.480 - 01:28:31.374, Speaker B: Yeah. Is just equal to one, right. After one derivation, we stabilized one, was not in the original idea, but one is afterwards. So after one derivation, we stabilized. This is the first easy example. Back to the second one. Now, the second one, I wanted to take the case of the, of the normal form and to see what, what is going to happen.
01:28:31.374 - 01:29:17.886, Speaker B: So I'm going to take it I equals to f, where f is going to be exactly as in the normal form that we were considering before. You know, my claim, claim is that this invariant, whatever this invariant is going.
01:29:17.910 - 01:29:18.634, Speaker A: To be.
01:29:22.404 - 01:29:41.252, Speaker B: Is going to be smaller or equal to d. It's going to be, well, we're going to see it's actually, we can choose coordinates so that it's going to be equal. But for now, let's just prove that for whatever coordinate that we have, if we obtain this coordinates in this normal form, then this is more equal to.
01:29:41.268 - 01:29:43.344, Speaker A: T. So the proof.
01:29:45.524 - 01:29:57.480, Speaker B: Of this is simple. Note that the d derivative in respect to w of f is simply u.
01:29:57.512 - 01:30:01.640, Speaker A: To the power lambda times, well, f.
01:30:01.672 - 01:30:08.168, Speaker B: Two, the plus some term which is of order one in W. Right.
01:30:08.296 - 01:30:11.760, Speaker A: So it means that u lambda times.
01:30:11.832 - 01:30:59.118, Speaker B: This is a unit, right, because this part here is zero at a and this part here is non zero. Sorry, here there is a d factorial, doesn't change much. Okay, so it's u lambda times this. And from here we conclude that u lambda belongs to the ideal u e. So that we know, moreover, uh, u lambda needs to be contained in the like we know that it is, um, true. Related remarks. Remark.
01:30:59.166 - 01:31:02.474, Speaker A: One, you lambda divides.
01:31:04.654 - 01:31:08.716, Speaker C: Andre, I'm sorry, I'm a little lost now.
01:31:08.740 - 01:31:10.304, Speaker B: You're lost. What we are going to do?
01:31:11.004 - 01:31:23.344, Speaker C: No, but I'm also like, I don't understand why any element from the sum would survive the derivation. The sum completely vanishes in the derivation.
01:31:24.244 - 01:31:34.680, Speaker B: Ah, because they only depend on order I in w. Yeah. If d times in w, these terms here are all zero. Is that the question?
01:31:34.872 - 01:31:41.424, Speaker C: Yeah, but why? Yes. So the question is why there would be anything else then just factor times f tilde.
01:31:41.544 - 01:31:43.844, Speaker B: W appears in f tilde two.
01:31:44.784 - 01:31:45.152, Speaker A: Okay.
01:31:45.168 - 01:31:45.440, Speaker B: Okay.
01:31:45.472 - 01:31:48.920, Speaker C: Sure. Oh, w appears in f tilde. Ok. That's, that's the answer.
01:31:48.952 - 01:31:50.720, Speaker A: Okay. Okay, thanks. Okay.
01:31:50.752 - 01:31:53.096, Speaker B: Ah, why this? Yes, because it depends on w. So.
01:31:53.120 - 01:31:53.724, Speaker A: Yes.
01:31:59.084 - 01:32:04.584, Speaker B: Again the same problem. Let's continue. Ulamma divide divides x.
01:32:06.284 - 01:32:14.984, Speaker A: So we note that u zero is contained in u lambda and true.
01:32:16.844 - 01:32:20.344, Speaker B: Ultimate is invariant. It's a monomial, so it's invariant by.
01:32:27.344 - 01:32:28.484, Speaker A: The derivations.
01:32:29.584 - 01:32:38.484, Speaker B: So if you look at the chain that we had there, so this one is.
01:32:40.984 - 01:32:41.844, Speaker A: Contained.
01:32:48.784 - 01:32:55.984, Speaker B: The next one, since this is containing it, like when we derive, it's going to be containing itself. We know that this one is also containing u lambda.
01:32:58.244 - 01:32:59.516, Speaker A: And therefore id is.
01:32:59.540 - 01:33:10.664, Speaker B: Also containing u lambda, but it also contains u lambda. So we conclude that id is equal to u to the power lambda.
01:33:13.644 - 01:33:14.504, Speaker A: Therefore.
01:33:15.644 - 01:33:17.904, Speaker B: Which is, which is invariant by n.
01:33:23.024 - 01:33:24.404, Speaker A: Which is invariant.
01:33:26.864 - 01:33:35.724, Speaker B: By these derivations. So we have concluded that this is smaller or equal to d.
01:33:41.664 - 01:33:42.160, Speaker A: So this.
01:33:42.192 - 01:33:44.164, Speaker B: Proves the claim that we said.
01:33:47.684 - 01:33:48.584, Speaker A: Okay.
01:33:50.404 - 01:34:09.716, Speaker B: So now with these two examples in mind, I just want to finish with some key properties that we are going to use in the next, in the next time I'm going to call property.
01:34:09.780 - 01:34:11.554, Speaker A: A the form.
01:34:13.614 - 01:34:18.074, Speaker B: Let sigma of m.
01:34:18.894 - 01:34:19.794, Speaker A: E t.
01:34:23.054 - 01:34:26.934, Speaker B: Me be a combinatorial going.
01:34:26.974 - 01:34:40.374, Speaker A: Up and let.
01:34:47.834 - 01:35:00.214, Speaker B: G be the prime image of I. Then the claim is that gk.
01:35:02.574 - 01:35:02.886, Speaker A: E.
01:35:02.910 - 01:35:13.514, Speaker B: Cubed is going to be equal to the pullback of ik for ok.
01:35:18.374 - 01:35:18.662, Speaker A: And.
01:35:18.678 - 01:35:19.394, Speaker B: In particular.
01:35:21.974 - 01:35:29.906, Speaker A: For ok. No, I can see like this.
01:35:29.930 - 01:35:35.934, Speaker B: For all b in m for a.
01:35:37.194 - 01:35:42.386, Speaker A: In the pre image of b, the.
01:35:42.410 - 01:35:50.974, Speaker B: Invariant can only draw drop a.
01:35:53.854 - 01:35:54.190, Speaker A: Small.
01:35:54.222 - 01:35:57.194, Speaker B: Or equal to the invariant of b.
01:35:58.974 - 01:35:59.954, Speaker A: Of I.
01:36:02.054 - 01:36:11.034, Speaker B: And the proof of this key property is the key lemma, because the key lemma told us that combinatorial blinds up is going to keep the derivations, right.
01:36:13.214 - 01:36:15.554, Speaker A: So the proof.
01:36:18.594 - 01:36:19.574, Speaker B: Is direct.
01:36:22.194 - 01:36:22.786, Speaker A: From the.
01:36:22.810 - 01:36:49.406, Speaker B: Key lemon combinatorials, right? Because we just said that I'm going back so that I can show in definition, so that the pullback by combinatorials blows up of the derivation is going to be the new derivations, right, which are tangent to e tilde. So this definition is going to just pass one, one term at a time.
01:36:49.510 - 01:36:52.294, Speaker A: And we're going to obtain that the.
01:36:52.334 - 01:37:01.954, Speaker B: New sequence is just going to be the pullback of the old one. So this is the first of the properties.
01:37:03.694 - 01:37:05.354, Speaker A: That I wanted to talk about.
01:37:06.534 - 01:37:39.968, Speaker B: Combinatorials is going to preserve this environment and also preserve the sequence itself. There's something important here also. Now the second part here. Oh, wait, we finished at 450, right? And not at an output five. They made this mistake, so. Right. Okay, so maybe let's stop here so that we don't pass much time.
01:37:39.968 - 01:37:41.962, Speaker B: And in the next time I'm going.
01:37:41.978 - 01:37:44.986, Speaker A: To talk about what are the key.
01:37:45.010 - 01:37:47.334, Speaker B: Properties, and then I'm going to.
01:37:50.634 - 01:37:51.018, Speaker A: State.
01:37:51.066 - 01:38:00.882, Speaker B: All of them without proof. Can I pass two more minutes so that I can state all of them, and then next time I prove them?
01:38:00.938 - 01:38:18.514, Speaker A: Sure, let's do that. Suppose that I infinity in this monomial.
01:38:22.694 - 01:38:27.430, Speaker B: First thing, first remark, an obvious remark here.
01:38:27.622 - 01:38:32.994, Speaker A: If the invariant is zero, then I is monomial.
01:38:37.094 - 01:38:53.286, Speaker B: Second one for oa, the invariant is actually going to be finite by saying that if we get that this last one is monomial, then all of them are going to have finite invariant, not.
01:38:53.350 - 01:38:59.314, Speaker A: Infinite, unless, which is the property that.
01:39:00.184 - 01:39:18.432, Speaker B: And to finish it, if m a e is equal to d bigger than zero. And our idea was. So there's a, there's another version for a general idea, but just because of.
01:39:18.448 - 01:39:23.008, Speaker A: The hyper surfaces, then there exists the.
01:39:23.056 - 01:39:41.624, Speaker B: Adapter coordinate systems such that u lambda wd f tilde.
01:39:43.404 - 01:39:52.640, Speaker A: AI uv wi f.
01:39:52.672 - 01:40:19.628, Speaker B: Two at a different from zero AI at a equal to zero f tilde nai minus two. So the next time I'm going to. So these three properties are going to be simple to prove, and they capture more or less everything that we need in order to prove then the, all of the statements without not that much.
01:40:19.676 - 01:40:23.384, Speaker A: Computation as we're going to see.
01:40:23.764 - 01:40:33.504, Speaker B: Not much computation. So these are the properties that we're going to use and we're going to restart next morning. So thanks a lot, everyone. I'll stop here.
01:40:34.284 - 01:40:37.644, Speaker A: Thank you, Andre. Thanks. Thanks.
