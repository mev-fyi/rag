00:00:00.880 - 00:00:02.725, Speaker A: Okay, so.
00:00:25.395 - 00:00:26.135, Speaker B: Monday.
00:01:43.415 - 00:01:44.755, Speaker A: Non constant.
00:01:46.735 - 00:01:47.119, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:47.167 - 00:02:13.925, Speaker A: Because a constant curve is a constant. So generality, we will almost consider.
00:02:17.945 - 00:02:43.859, Speaker C: Non constant geodesics. We'll parameterize them by unibly only makes.
00:02:43.907 - 00:03:51.925, Speaker A: Sense when so we. And when you think of Mark.
00:03:55.745 - 00:03:56.485, Speaker B: Given.
00:03:58.945 - 00:04:19.235, Speaker A: P M I contain the origin on.
00:04:19.275 - 00:04:24.495, Speaker B: Which gamma VP is defined.
00:04:28.155 - 00:05:20.755, Speaker C: This is a near message. So we can always take the domain to be maximum. But this maximal domain need not be.
00:05:30.255 - 00:05:31.555, Speaker B: On the metric.
00:05:37.505 - 00:05:42.325, Speaker A: So you might have at some point.
00:05:50.985 - 00:06:54.775, Speaker B: Some metric with a given set of initial data for which everything changes county is called geodesically complete. Now that we can define.
00:07:24.005 - 00:07:25.705, Speaker C: So basically we're going to show.
00:07:40.175 - 00:08:02.431, Speaker B: The same as the original metrics items each one of them makes into metric spaces. And then when you have a metric space, you can ask metric space is.
00:08:02.463 - 00:08:04.915, Speaker C: The same as geodesic completeness.
00:08:32.025 - 00:08:38.685, Speaker A: You can show that any metric G.
00:08:39.985 - 00:08:51.245, Speaker C: On N is geodesically complete. So given what I just said.
00:12:05.345 - 00:12:06.605, Speaker B: So in other words.
00:12:10.705 - 00:12:12.845, Speaker C: Not a CVP is defined for.
00:12:21.875 - 00:12:26.575, Speaker B: Precisely. Somewhat more precisely.
00:12:29.035 - 00:12:33.179, Speaker A: If gamma BT can.
00:12:33.227 - 00:16:15.735, Speaker B: Define if we write gamma bp Sorry, let's do it this way.
00:16:16.235 - 00:16:19.219, Speaker C: This is a Judas equation 10d squared.
00:16:19.267 - 00:16:38.705, Speaker A: Alpha j squared plus zero genetics.
00:16:46.845 - 00:18:23.145, Speaker B: That's why it takes. That's why rescaling the time parameterization, which is.
00:18:35.125 - 00:18:41.265, Speaker A: A procedure to develop preferred local coordinates.
00:18:54.015 - 00:18:57.595, Speaker C: So before we get to the definition of the exponential math.
00:20:27.845 - 00:20:38.789, Speaker B: Very important property of theorem that made system express enough. The OD theorem tells you if you prescribe initial data, you have existence at least for a short time, but in.
00:20:38.797 - 00:20:40.105, Speaker A: Fact tell you more.
00:20:47.485 - 00:20:51.585, Speaker B: Such that the same time interval existence.
00:20:54.735 - 00:20:55.875, Speaker C: This is because.
00:21:19.145 - 00:21:20.045, Speaker A: Interval.
00:21:25.945 - 00:23:26.543, Speaker B: Time interval of existence. So usually. Okay, so this is a crucial a crucial point that not only do we know. Okay, so that's important points.
00:23:26.729 - 00:23:29.095, Speaker A: And now we can apply the rescaling number.
00:23:40.195 - 00:23:54.627, Speaker C: So by the rescaling lemma, if I then take this tangent vector VQ and.
00:23:54.651 - 00:23:57.075, Speaker A: Multiplied by delta over 2, this is.
00:23:57.115 - 00:24:04.095, Speaker B: Defined at least minus.
00:24:21.565 - 00:24:22.825, Speaker A: Gamma VQ.
00:24:25.445 - 00:24:27.425, Speaker C: So if I multiply this by C.
00:25:36.465 - 00:25:50.165, Speaker B: At least some open minds.
00:25:59.985 - 00:26:07.055, Speaker A: Therefore, by shrinking the size of the vectors possibly further to not just being.
00:26:26.075 - 00:26:28.305, Speaker C: Generality, take a small enough place.
00:26:54.115 - 00:26:54.835, Speaker B: U.
00:26:54.995 - 00:27:17.335, Speaker A: Epsilon V as above. And let's.
00:27:32.525 - 00:27:35.185, Speaker C: And we've chosen this.
00:27:37.205 - 00:28:13.205, Speaker A: So that gamma BQ is defined.
00:28:26.905 - 00:28:28.445, Speaker C: And again the Q is.
00:29:26.815 - 00:29:27.623, Speaker A: The ODE.
00:29:27.679 - 00:29:28.395, Speaker B: Theorem.
00:29:30.255 - 00:29:31.155, Speaker A: Gives.
00:29:32.935 - 00:29:43.143, Speaker C: Smooth dependence on the initial conditions. So the solution to your ode of.
00:29:43.159 - 00:29:51.527, Speaker A: Course depends on the initial conditions. So in some sense it's a function of the initial if you then the.
00:29:51.551 - 00:29:52.155, Speaker B: Solution.
00:30:20.565 - 00:30:22.265, Speaker A: To only those tangents.
00:30:43.485 - 00:30:44.117, Speaker B: Into the.
00:30:44.141 - 00:30:47.395, Speaker A: Air which have length.
00:30:57.375 - 00:30:58.515, Speaker B: Of P.
00:43:31.735 - 00:43:32.047, Speaker A: So.
00:43:32.071 - 00:44:08.913, Speaker B: This is exactly why the way it is. So let's Let be in tm, which.
00:44:08.929 - 00:44:10.045, Speaker C: Is the tangent.
00:44:22.955 - 00:44:24.335, Speaker A: Of that vector.
00:44:28.795 - 00:44:30.215, Speaker C: Under the exponential.
00:45:12.455 - 00:45:23.223, Speaker B: P02 initial velocity at that.
00:45:23.663 - 00:45:30.155, Speaker A: Time 0 is the vector we want to push forward.
00:46:03.675 - 00:48:37.915, Speaker B: This is vp, this is alpha. I can make this so X P star at the origin of vp is v by dp x equals to 0 of x p. So which is X.
00:48:39.575 - 00:48:48.475, Speaker A: Restricted to W Inverse goes from XP and W which is an open neighborhood.
00:49:03.985 - 00:49:07.765, Speaker B: Of zero ATP.
00:49:09.505 - 00:49:10.645, Speaker A: So if they.
00:49:28.755 - 00:49:31.455, Speaker B: In other words, a choice of basis.
00:49:36.835 - 00:49:48.091, Speaker C: Then we have a smooth coordinate chart for M centered at.
00:49:48.123 - 00:49:48.695, Speaker B: P.
00:49:51.035 - 00:49:54.055, Speaker C: Because the statement P to the origin here.
00:51:11.525 - 00:51:15.865, Speaker A: Of EPM with respect to.
00:51:16.485 - 00:51:17.385, Speaker B: Metric.
00:51:30.165 - 00:51:35.265, Speaker A: L from CPM to RN.
00:51:54.455 - 00:52:05.565, Speaker C: Standard inner products. And I'm just going to come out.
00:52:07.745 - 00:52:09.445, Speaker B: Properties of these four.
00:52:12.505 - 00:52:15.617, Speaker A: So we're going to do that and.
00:52:15.641 - 00:52:16.205, Speaker B: Then.
00:52:18.345 - 00:52:26.485, Speaker C: Define phi to be L equals XP restricted to W.
00:52:28.305 - 00:52:29.965, Speaker A: And this is going from.
00:52:33.745 - 00:52:49.725, Speaker B: Let's call this a different neighborhood.
00:52:55.155 - 00:53:01.255, Speaker A: And this is an open neighborhood of zero.
00:53:19.015 - 00:55:06.935, Speaker B: Normal coordinates. And then so you want to show.
00:55:13.395 - 00:56:45.495, Speaker A: It's often very easy to show, but if it holds. Okay, so properties coordinate representation.
00:56:53.595 - 00:56:56.035, Speaker B: I just take the curve and I.
00:56:56.075 - 00:57:10.905, Speaker A: Compose it with the chart. So for all be small enough.
00:57:13.925 - 00:57:35.555, Speaker B: Such that otherwise we can't. We can't write. If you look.
00:57:49.615 - 00:57:51.315, Speaker C: Straight line through the origin.
00:58:26.105 - 00:58:32.765, Speaker B: Of the coordinate chart is making us do rn.
00:59:56.615 - 00:59:58.395, Speaker C: Before I write down part B.
01:00:10.305 - 01:02:43.235, Speaker B: In normal coordinates normal coordinate at the point P you can look at what you want the metric in these coordinates at this point. This is just. You can look at the crystal symbols in these coordinates at this point in their zero and you can look at the derivative. This one is.
01:02:54.495 - 01:02:56.915, Speaker A: Why trying to establish.
01:02:57.215 - 01:03:00.595, Speaker C: Certain identities in Riemannian geometry is much.
01:03:34.955 - 01:07:02.847, Speaker A: Well, therefore phi inverse is going to be.
01:07:02.871 - 01:07:06.475, Speaker B: I'm going to stop writing the. There's too much notation.
01:07:09.735 - 01:07:13.247, Speaker A: Consider what it makes sense. So if I did the inverse of.
01:07:13.271 - 01:07:22.035, Speaker B: A composition of the inverses in the opposite order and now I take that.
01:07:27.325 - 01:07:33.705, Speaker A: So this takes 0 to p.
01:07:37.165 - 01:07:38.065, Speaker C: Inverse.
01:07:48.175 - 01:07:48.915, Speaker B: Position.
01:10:21.635 - 01:10:22.775, Speaker C: We've shown.
01:10:25.635 - 01:10:26.843, Speaker A: Not surprisingly.
01:10:26.939 - 01:10:28.323, Speaker B: What else could it have been?
01:10:28.459 - 01:10:31.535, Speaker A: D by DX KP is equal to E chain.
01:10:35.075 - 01:10:36.255, Speaker B: From one of the.
01:10:44.355 - 01:10:45.295, Speaker A: Property.
01:11:01.605 - 01:11:02.785, Speaker C: So in particular.
01:11:06.405 - 01:11:19.195, Speaker A: GI j is G which is gp.
01:11:27.255 - 01:11:37.935, Speaker B: So we've shown. We've shown this first part of my.
01:11:37.975 - 01:12:34.205, Speaker A: VP of XP inverse.
01:12:39.665 - 01:12:40.805, Speaker B: What is this?
01:12:41.265 - 01:12:45.953, Speaker A: I move the T down here by the rescaling lemma and then that's the.
01:12:45.969 - 01:12:46.977, Speaker C: Depth and then this will be a.
01:12:47.001 - 01:12:48.885, Speaker B: 1 and that's example.
01:14:13.845 - 01:14:15.093, Speaker C: My vp half.
01:14:15.149 - 01:14:17.905, Speaker A: Of t is tv one.
01:14:23.405 - 01:14:24.345, Speaker B: Of t.
01:14:27.925 - 01:14:29.065, Speaker C: Representation.
01:14:32.165 - 01:14:36.145, Speaker A: Of a geometric.
01:15:04.625 - 01:15:07.965, Speaker B: Dxj dt zero.
01:15:09.185 - 01:15:10.737, Speaker A: We know this will be satisfied for.
01:15:10.761 - 01:15:11.325, Speaker B: This.
01:15:15.705 - 01:15:21.045, Speaker C: T times vi. That means dxi VT is just vi.
01:15:21.345 - 01:15:26.165, Speaker A: And v squared Xi dt squared is zero. For this curve.
01:15:57.045 - 01:16:09.405, Speaker C: Xi is zero is zero, which corresponds to the point gamma.
01:16:09.445 - 01:16:11.665, Speaker B: Vp passes through the points p.
01:16:21.655 - 01:16:22.087, Speaker A: Something.
01:16:22.151 - 01:16:32.315, Speaker C: Like gi and p is Delta IJ and Gamma Kij0. This was a little bit sloppy, right?
01:17:37.365 - 01:17:47.037, Speaker A: So that they're all zeros and ones. And then the last step is to show that the partial derivatives of the.
01:17:47.061 - 01:17:48.905, Speaker C: Metric radish IP.
01:18:00.885 - 01:18:02.025, Speaker B: Is equal to.
01:18:59.985 - 01:19:07.585, Speaker A: You can express the gamut in terms of the partial ribbon. So if you have a coordinate system.
