00:00:05.280 - 00:00:05.940, Speaker A: Okay.
00:00:09.334 - 00:00:55.978, Speaker B: So, good morning or afternoon for everyone. So, today I'm going to speak a little bit about an application of resolution of singularities, which is the uniformization theorem for q sets and for subclass analytic sets. So, just want to recall what we did last course, which is the theorem that we're going to use today. So, last course we just stated. So we gave all of the necessary definitions and discussed a little bit about the hypothesis to state the theorem of resolution of similarities. So in particular, we, which is this theorem here. So we fixed it, as I repeated here, the, the statement that we saw last time.
00:00:55.978 - 00:01:17.842, Speaker B: So, we consider a quasi analytic class m, a quasi analytic manifolds, a simple normal crossing divisor and a privileged ideal sheet. So particularly was, we discussed a lot, the word privileged the last time. And then we said that for every relatively compact open set, we give an example, just to show that not globally in general, by a finite number of.
00:01:17.858 - 00:01:18.694, Speaker A: Loans up.
00:01:20.414 - 00:01:59.734, Speaker B: But in any case, for every relatively compact open set, we are able to find a resolution of similarity. That is, we restrict everything to this open set. And then there exists a finite sequence of blows up like this one, where the sigma is, are all compatible with the previous exceptional divisor. And the pullback of the ideal by all of the composition of the blows up is now monomial, which was our objective after all. So this was the result, the result that we're going to use today. Then afterwards, we, we provided, we recall the definition of what proper is. So, proper means that for every compact set of m, the prey whoops.
00:01:59.734 - 00:02:03.050, Speaker B: Even when I'm preparing, I sometimes make.
00:02:03.082 - 00:02:06.174, Speaker A: Mistakes, and then I have time.
00:02:06.514 - 00:02:41.804, Speaker B: The prey image of the compact set is compact. And we talked about Phi being semipropper. There is, we said that for every compact set of n, there would exist. So this is actually a semi proper covering, as we're going to see. There exists an l such that the Fl is equal to k. And then we provided a lemma that missed an important point. It was like in the end of the course, and I wanted to finish with the proof of this result, and I forgot to add a very important point, so that the lemma is not empty.
00:02:41.804 - 00:03:30.282, Speaker B: And the lemma says that if we take a semi proper q morpheus, cosine morphes, then there exists a generically local isomorphism, which is a q morphism q n, such that the composition is proper. And of course, we want the image of n tilde to be equal to the image of n. So in the previous, in the previous version, we did not add this property. And then you could always take n tilde equals to a point and tau being just the immersion of a point into n. And the final morphine would be proper. But of course we want to be some sort of covering in some sense, right? And the idea of the proof was simply to consider the local, as local models, the projection of the, of the sphere into rn. And this you would use to cover.
00:03:30.378 - 00:03:33.162, Speaker A: Compact set l that would be sent.
00:03:33.218 - 00:04:24.884, Speaker B: To complex sets k, where this k, you would take it some k alpha, where the k alpha would be locally finite, local finite covering by complex sets of your manifold m that is in here. So that's what was the idea of the lemma. And today I want to do a second lemma, very short one, before stating the main result of today, and the main result that we're going to actually talk about the proof, which is the uniformization theorem. And we're going to start with the uniformization theorem, which is a parameterization theorem for sets. This was kind of the recalling of last time. So just what is the lemma that we want to say here? It's a very simple lemma. It's we take a connected open set of rn and we take a function defined over this open set which is not identically zero.
00:04:24.884 - 00:05:06.694, Speaker B: Then the set of non zero points of this to the, you take U minus z of f is open and density u is actually something, we can actually show that it's actually something of household dimension is smaller, strictly smaller than n, strictly smaller or equal, and n minus one. You could follow by the same proof. And the proof is quite simple. It's just a consequence of longer preparation theorem. So let a be a point in c of f, which I recall, these are the points in U such that f of x is equal to zero.
00:05:07.754 - 00:05:10.814, Speaker A: And since f is not triplet zero.
00:05:11.434 - 00:05:13.254, Speaker B: We will say that we know.
00:05:16.674 - 00:05:16.986, Speaker A: That.
00:05:17.010 - 00:05:23.880, Speaker B: The Taylor expansion at a is not zero. Here I don't need equivalent, it's not.
00:05:23.912 - 00:05:24.484, Speaker A: Zero.
00:05:26.464 - 00:06:36.006, Speaker B: By quasi analyticity. Otherwise the axiom would tell us that f would be equivalent to zero. So apart from the linear change of coordinates, we may apply more grown per page. And with the Mongrange preparation theorem, it just becomes evident that this is the case that is open is trivial, because it's just going to be the pre image of the set of non zero values of f. So it's open. But the fact that it sense is going to come from the long range preparation. We know that going to be as a polynomial, given f is going to be written locally as a polynomial with coefficients that are sensitive function.
00:06:36.006 - 00:07:11.254, Speaker B: So even better than just open dense. We know that z of f has a house of dimension smaller or equal to d minus one. And in particular, note that I didn't talk too much yet about the dimension of a quasi analytic set. So set given by the zeros, for example, of f, one could attach the house or dimension to it. But there is another way which is compatible with the household dimension, which is more explicit, and it's going to be via the next theorem, which is a parameterization of this set, a good parameterization of this sense.
00:07:11.374 - 00:07:14.102, Speaker A: So the main theorem of today, in.
00:07:14.118 - 00:07:20.514, Speaker B: The first version of it at least, is going to be the let.
00:07:24.814 - 00:07:25.102, Speaker A: Be.
00:07:25.118 - 00:07:28.994, Speaker B: A closed queue set.
00:07:31.414 - 00:07:39.014, Speaker A: There exists appropriate.
00:07:42.234 - 00:07:43.174, Speaker B: Generically.
00:07:46.114 - 00:07:47.094, Speaker A: Immersive.
00:07:48.834 - 00:07:50.054, Speaker B: Two morphes.
00:07:52.914 - 00:07:58.094, Speaker A: C, sub n to m, such that.
00:08:02.774 - 00:08:14.670, Speaker B: T of n is equal to x. And when m here is the ambient variety, as usual. So this is the result that I want to prove in the, in the.
00:08:14.702 - 00:08:15.274, Speaker A: Next.
00:08:17.854 - 00:08:20.954, Speaker B: Ten to 15 more, even 20 minutes.
00:08:22.454 - 00:08:23.758, Speaker A: And it's the result that I want.
00:08:23.846 - 00:08:28.290, Speaker B: To prove in a way that is sufficiently which is complete.
00:08:28.322 - 00:08:28.894, Speaker A: Right?
00:08:29.314 - 00:08:56.354, Speaker B: So the first idea here is that by using the first of these lemmas, the result becomes local. So we just need to prove the existence of phi, which is not necessarily proper, but just semi proper. So by lemma one, it is enough to show the existence.
00:09:03.974 - 00:09:05.714, Speaker A: Of a semi proper margin.
00:09:16.254 - 00:09:50.258, Speaker B: The order functions. Now that we have this, we actually have a local problem, because now we can just compose it with local immersions of sufficiently small open sets, cover the entire manifold by some covering by open sets, some locally finite covering by open sites, and then argue for each one of them of the existence of this file. So not a problem.
00:09:50.426 - 00:09:54.534, Speaker A: So we may argue, we may now argue.
00:09:57.714 - 00:10:03.654, Speaker B: Locally. And in particular, since we can restrict to open sets, we can actually suppose.
00:10:05.074 - 00:10:06.414, Speaker A: So we may suppose.
00:10:09.674 - 00:10:19.634, Speaker B: Two things. First, that x is given there exists a privilege ideal.
00:10:25.454 - 00:10:26.194, Speaker A: I.
00:10:28.734 - 00:10:42.122, Speaker B: Judge that z of I is equal to x. So that's the first thing, because we know, we recall that for every q set locally we did have a privilege idoi.
00:10:42.178 - 00:10:44.114, Speaker A: Actually, even as we're going to see.
00:10:44.154 - 00:11:05.614, Speaker B: Finite type idoi such that the zero locus is going to be equal to x, but for now just privileged. And the second thing, there exists a resolution of singularities.
00:11:19.614 - 00:11:31.514, Speaker A: Mister signal r, no necessary m one u one.
00:11:36.254 - 00:11:39.486, Speaker B: M zero is zero. And in this case here we can.
00:11:39.510 - 00:11:46.494, Speaker A: Even take it equal to m, because.
00:11:46.654 - 00:12:03.174, Speaker B: We are able to argue locally. So we can always suppose that m is local on open set. It's very small open set. And here we are going to take in our case, we didn't start with any exceptional divider, so we can take it empty. The easier would be empty. Just a little comment.
00:12:03.834 - 00:12:04.978, Speaker A: In the theorem.
00:12:05.106 - 00:12:40.814, Speaker B: We have to take some relatively complex open set and then there is existence. But of course, since the result is now local, it's enough to take some local covering. We can take a local covering by relatively compact open sites of m and then argue in each one of them. So we can assume, as written here, there exists a global resolution of singularity. With this m equals to the empty set. With this m equal to m zero and zero equal to the empty set. Now, although the result that we want to use in the end is going to be in terms of m and the empty set here, we're actually going to prove the result as an induction.
00:12:40.814 - 00:13:05.522, Speaker B: So it's going to be convenient to do it via e zero two, just a simple normal crossing divisor that we start with. I'm actually not going to use the proof that we start with something that where the exceptional divisor is empty. And now the idea of the proof is going to be an induction. So in particular, let me just note.
00:13:05.538 - 00:13:11.298, Speaker A: This, which is important.
00:13:11.466 - 00:13:13.906, Speaker B: The prey image via the entire blow.
00:13:13.930 - 00:13:20.954, Speaker A: Up sequence of x is going to be contained in the end, in Er.
00:13:21.934 - 00:13:27.030, Speaker B: And the reason for this is simply because the ideal sheath, the end up.
00:13:27.062 - 00:13:30.198, Speaker A: Ideal sheath is going to be, after.
00:13:30.246 - 00:13:32.950, Speaker B: All of these blends up, so going to be a principal ideal, which is.
00:13:32.982 - 00:13:35.526, Speaker A: Monomial over the exceptional divisor.
00:13:35.550 - 00:13:44.354, Speaker B: So local is going to be just given by the product of terms of the exceptional divisor. So the zero set of the total transform of I.
00:13:45.164 - 00:13:48.460, Speaker A: This guy here is going to have.
00:13:48.492 - 00:13:59.692, Speaker B: Zero locals inside of VR. So this is the first remark that we make that the prey image of x is contained in the exceptional divisor, the last one. And this is something we are going.
00:13:59.708 - 00:14:02.944, Speaker A: To use in a strong way afterwards.
00:14:03.244 - 00:14:22.352, Speaker B: Right, so now the proof is going to be by induction on the lexicographic order, and on the couple on Mister, where this is the dimension of m.
00:14:22.448 - 00:14:26.884, Speaker A: N r is the number of blowing up.
00:14:29.544 - 00:15:24.916, Speaker B: That we use in this sequence here. And yeah, induction on mister. And what was the comment that I wanted to make in respect to the lexicographic order? First, that kind of trivial remark here, but which is going to be useful just to simplify things later on. Suppose that you start with x, which is contained. Suppose that x is contained into the exception advisor is zero. Then in this case there's actually nothing to do. In some sense, we can use the induction in a very simple way.
00:15:24.916 - 00:15:28.772, Speaker B: So, in the case that it's going to be contained in the exceptional divisor.
00:15:28.908 - 00:15:35.264, Speaker A: Recall that e zero is some union.
00:15:37.924 - 00:15:41.224, Speaker B: J j from one to some s.
00:15:42.764 - 00:15:49.064, Speaker A: Where e zero j are q hypersurfaces.
00:15:53.324 - 00:15:57.916, Speaker B: So now the result will follow in a simple way, by the induction. So in particular, the dimension is smaller.
00:15:57.940 - 00:16:00.162, Speaker A: Than the dimension of n. So it.
00:16:00.178 - 00:16:06.494, Speaker B: Is enough to apply induction.
00:16:12.514 - 00:16:14.650, Speaker A: To e.
00:16:14.682 - 00:16:30.424, Speaker B: Zero j x intersected with zero j for all j. So this is going to give us Morpheus, let's call it f n j.
00:16:31.004 - 00:16:45.964, Speaker A: From n j to m, such that cj of nj is equal to x intersected with this guy.
00:16:46.004 - 00:17:12.924, Speaker B: And this is enough. And we conclude, we conclude easily, because we can take as the manifold n the union, the disjointed union of all of the njs. And then the morph is phi, just as the morph is given by the restriction to each n and j the f g. So this is what the conclude easily means here.
00:17:13.424 - 00:17:15.096, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm going to use this.
00:17:15.120 - 00:17:20.684, Speaker B: Remark from time to time. Okay, so now the induction will start. The other trivial case of the induction.
00:17:20.724 - 00:17:26.384, Speaker A: Is if m equals to zero, there's nothing to do.
00:17:29.644 - 00:17:36.388, Speaker B: You just take the immersion going to be given by the set x into itself. X has to be either a point or empty.
00:17:36.436 - 00:17:39.612, Speaker A: So it's not that there's nothing to.
00:17:39.628 - 00:18:11.944, Speaker B: Do, it's just trivial. The second thing is, we have m zero. Then x must be contained already in the exceptional divisor. So this is because we are making no blowing up. So, since we know that the pre image by the entire sequence of blowing up is containing VR, so the only chance that we have is that it's already containing e zero.
00:18:13.884 - 00:18:15.184, Speaker A: And we conclude.
00:18:19.484 - 00:18:36.212, Speaker B: By the remark. So now we can treat, and we need to treat separately the case mister and m one separately. Sorry. We can just treat not the case.
00:18:36.268 - 00:18:45.564, Speaker A: Mister, directly, since we started here for.
00:18:45.604 - 00:19:20.614, Speaker B: R bigger than zero, right? I think because I had prepared with m one, but probably I don't need it. Yeah, I don't need it right now. So if we now have some r which is bigger than zero. So now we have some extra points in the induction. So the first thing that we do is that we consider, again, just as in the remark, the terms that are given here by the induction, given by e zero j e zero j that are provided here, we consider.
00:19:30.894 - 00:19:32.274, Speaker A: The morphisms.
00:19:36.854 - 00:19:37.754, Speaker B: Cj.
00:19:39.894 - 00:20:01.694, Speaker A: Mj to m such that dj of mj is equal to x intersected v e zero j, as done.
00:20:04.274 - 00:20:22.654, Speaker B: In the remark. Moreover, there's another one that I want to use, which is the one given by the first blowing up. So we have a sequence of r blowing up. And I'm going to name the first one of them. Sigma one will have center c one.
00:20:23.354 - 00:20:29.374, Speaker A: So let c one be the center.
00:20:32.434 - 00:20:37.774, Speaker B: Of sigma one. And we were going to also apply the induction argument for this guy.
00:20:38.794 - 00:20:39.534, Speaker A: Consider.
00:20:42.914 - 00:20:45.970, Speaker B: C one, c one inter x.
00:20:46.162 - 00:21:05.470, Speaker A: So c one must be, note that the dimension of C one is smaller than n and apply induction in order.
00:21:05.502 - 00:21:14.626, Speaker B: To get, in order to obtain amorphous.
00:21:14.690 - 00:21:18.450, Speaker A: V one from n one, which satisfies.
00:21:18.482 - 00:21:56.032, Speaker B: All the properties that we want. It's semi proper, it's generically immersive all the properties that we want into n. And moreover, this guy is equal to c one inter x, which is again connected. And now we have to cover the other part of x. So we make the first point up after the first, let I one be.
00:21:56.048 - 00:21:59.564, Speaker A: The pullback of I zero.
00:22:00.224 - 00:22:01.324, Speaker B: The first I.
00:22:08.844 - 00:22:14.864, Speaker A: And x one will be equal to the zero locus of I one.
00:22:15.884 - 00:22:19.224, Speaker B: And now we're going to apply induction. We apply induction.
00:22:26.484 - 00:22:31.292, Speaker A: To the couple m one, x one.
00:22:31.468 - 00:22:57.574, Speaker B: So in this case we do know, therefore m one, x one. So we made the first blowing up. And now here we're going to have the same dimension. M one is going to have the same dimension of n because we just made a blowing up. And x one will have a sequence of blowing up. The principalized it, the idea associated to it by r minus one blowing up. So we can apply induction to it.
00:22:57.734 - 00:22:58.634, Speaker A: And obtain.
00:23:07.554 - 00:23:14.214, Speaker B: E tudor from n tudor to m one. So I recall.
00:23:16.314 - 00:23:22.414, Speaker A: Semicropper, semi proper.
00:23:24.614 - 00:23:25.594, Speaker B: Generically.
00:23:28.414 - 00:23:32.794, Speaker A: Immersive tumor is.
00:23:34.974 - 00:23:40.806, Speaker B: All of the conditions that we wanted such that phi of.
00:23:40.830 - 00:23:44.994, Speaker A: N tuga is equal to x bar.
00:23:53.194 - 00:24:39.754, Speaker B: Now this morph is here. It might not be good enough because we are going to outside of the exceptional divisor e one, this is okay because there was no change in the set x, but x one inside of the exceptional divisor might, might be, might have components which are much bigger than the ones which are coming from x. Particularly, for example, you might contain a whole thing of the exceptional divisor. And then when we consider this phi, oops, phi tilde, when we consider the composition of phi tilde with the sigma one, we're going to have something which is not in x, something which is too big. So we need to change a little bit these morphins. We need to choose a little bit these morphins pituita in such a way that we're going to find the correct one, the one that is going to give us exactly x.
00:24:40.934 - 00:24:42.944, Speaker A: Thanks. This.
00:24:44.564 - 00:24:48.704, Speaker B: And now there is another remark that we may use here, the default. So we consider.
00:24:51.764 - 00:24:54.892, Speaker A: Until the equals to.
00:24:54.908 - 00:25:01.824, Speaker B: The union, this is always possible where this alpha belongs to some index set.
00:25:02.604 - 00:25:08.714, Speaker A: Where an alpha tilde is connected.
00:25:12.134 - 00:26:01.904, Speaker B: Okay, now by default, by lemma two, we are going to have two options either. So I actually want to name it so that I can use it easier afterwards. C t of n. The alpha is contained in the exceptional divisor e one. And here I'm using that e one is locally given by a hyper surface. So there is a function there which defines the e one. So either this function, when I pull back by phi, is going to be constant equals to zero in a connected open side by lemma two, or it's not constant equal to zero.
00:26:01.904 - 00:26:07.532, Speaker B: And therefore, by dilemma, there exists u.
00:26:07.628 - 00:26:13.916, Speaker A: Alpha contained in an alpha open and.
00:26:13.940 - 00:26:14.584, Speaker B: Dense.
00:26:18.444 - 00:26:24.824, Speaker A: Such that v tilde of u alpha.
00:26:26.784 - 00:26:32.004, Speaker B: How did I write? Is contained in.
00:26:34.824 - 00:26:38.444, Speaker A: X one minus e one.
00:26:39.664 - 00:27:17.104, Speaker B: It's a set where does e one is the function that locally defines e one is not equals to zero. So we're going to have this open then set. And what we're going to do is simply take the indexes alpha, where the second condition is satisfied, because the first one might create problems. And we had already covered everything that goes to v one by the two morphes that are here, this ones, and the one that we did with the intersection of c one. So let's just choose a better index set.
00:27:20.914 - 00:27:25.266, Speaker A: Let a be the alpha zoom alpha.
00:27:25.290 - 00:27:27.414, Speaker B: Tilde such that.
00:27:30.714 - 00:27:33.174, Speaker A: True volts.
00:27:35.474 - 00:27:37.654, Speaker B: And now we consider, we just need to consider.
00:27:39.634 - 00:27:40.614, Speaker A: And let.
00:27:42.694 - 00:27:47.434, Speaker B: V two, oh, sorry. Let me define everything that we need. N two.
00:27:49.134 - 00:28:05.794, Speaker A: With the union by all alphas in a now of this n alpha tilde and c two from n two to m decomposition.
00:28:10.034 - 00:28:11.974, Speaker B: Sigma one composed.
00:28:12.674 - 00:28:17.494, Speaker A: With fecal restricted to angel.
00:28:19.074 - 00:28:27.094, Speaker B: And I claim that this is the, now one needs to claim, one just needs to verify. It's enough to, we just need to verify.
00:28:31.074 - 00:28:38.754, Speaker A: To verify that in this case.
00:28:42.774 - 00:28:47.006, Speaker B: C two of m two is equal.
00:28:47.030 - 00:29:00.074, Speaker A: To x minus e zero union with c c one or bar.
00:29:01.104 - 00:29:36.234, Speaker B: Right. So if you verify this, then all of the other parts are going to follow almost immediately. Why? Because a blowing up is proper. So if we're composing a semipropper, we've got proper amorphous. It's still going to be semipropper. The blowing up is a local isol morphism outside of the singular locus, outside of the center of blowing up. So in here we have that, this is going to be generically, locally local immersion in particular, it's going to be, you can even suppose that it's going to be a local immersion over the entire open density alpha.
00:29:36.234 - 00:29:55.834, Speaker B: And this part goes to something that it's not in the exceptional divisor. And therefore the composition with sigma one is again going to be a local immersion. So it's enough to verify here. And this kind of follows in a not too difficult way because, so just.
00:29:56.294 - 00:29:57.354, Speaker A: Little remark.
00:30:00.254 - 00:30:39.932, Speaker B: That we know that, Andre, was it a part of your statement of the uniformization theorem that the morphism is generically immersive? Yes. Oh, sorry, I missed that. Yes, yes, yes. Because I want to define the dimension afterwards. Yes, yes. Okay, so phi and tilde equals to x one, right? Which implies that phi rather than two must be given by x one minus e 1 bar. And then we obtain this.
00:30:39.932 - 00:30:54.364, Speaker B: And why is that? Because all of the other components are sent to e one. And of course we are covering phi Tilde of N. Tilde was equal to the entire x one. So this is why this one is true. And from there, if we compose.
00:30:58.464 - 00:31:12.060, Speaker A: N two, this is going to be two. X can be verified. And that it happens, which is closed.
00:31:12.092 - 00:31:14.904, Speaker B: And here remark, which is closed.
00:31:15.644 - 00:31:18.804, Speaker A: We are using that X is closed.
00:31:18.844 - 00:32:13.324, Speaker B: Here to say that, well, we're not covering too much, this is what we needed to cover anyways. So this gives us the proof of the, of this result. And now I wanted to say a couple of consequences of it which are somehow useful to keep in mind. So the first one is that we may define all the dimension, we may define a dimension of x as a dimension of n. So that's why I asked the Morpheus to be a locally immersion, generically an immersion. So that because we haven't talked about the dimension of X yet, and with this we can actually talk about the dimension of like dimension of n is going to be of a manifold. So it's well defined.
00:32:13.324 - 00:32:57.046, Speaker B: And since it's a local immersion, it's going to make sense to call the dimension of x and the dimension of n. This is going to be compatible with the Hauser dimension of X. In the analytic case, just to make the remark, in the analytic case, we don't need the uniformization theorem to define this. The typical way, or the way that I learned from an article of Millman in the Ashes is FM 88 is by using what is called separating families. But separating families do need Viceroy's preparation. The existence of what is called separating families depend on the viceroy's preparation. So here I followed a different path, which is the one that is indicated.
00:32:57.046 - 00:33:42.040, Speaker B: And also the paper, Bierson Millman from classical quadrant classes, where they do say that the result will follow, that the dimension can be defined via the formulation theorem. Indeed, we can do this. The other comment is that the proof that I have here is slightly different from the proof from where I learned from Bjrst Newman's paper about uniformization of analytic. But the idea is exactly the same. The idea is exactly the same. The only difference is that Bierstein and Millman use local resolution of similarities instead of global resolution of singularity. So they don't have this nice sequence of lines up, has just local sequence of lines up.
00:33:42.040 - 00:34:20.222, Speaker B: And this means that the combinatorics is more complicated. But they do that because at least at the time, resolution of singularities was considered a difficult problem, a difficult technique, and by now the situation has quite radically changed. So I feel like we understand resolution singularities very well. Burst and human help it a lot in this understanding. We have books about it. So I feel like we can use the result itself and have a less combinatorial, like a less hard, from combinatorial perspective proof. Another thing is that in their proof, it's used the dimension of x.
00:34:20.222 - 00:34:28.202, Speaker B: Induction is in the dimension of x two. And here I had to modify it in order to have this dimension of m of the ambient space. So it's a slight difference, but the.
00:34:28.218 - 00:34:30.202, Speaker A: Idea of the proof is going to.
00:34:30.218 - 00:34:45.130, Speaker B: Be exactly the same. The second consequence that I want to talk about is for what is called the topological notoriety. So there's a theorem here, maybe I'm going to put in the next part.
00:34:45.162 - 00:34:47.774, Speaker A: So that the theorem is in.
00:34:52.754 - 00:35:01.570, Speaker B: So the true is a theorem, which is called topological materiality. Quite a useful theorem.
00:35:01.762 - 00:35:04.534, Speaker A: So let's take exon.
00:35:09.914 - 00:35:17.314, Speaker B: A sequence, and I'm going to use here the expression privileged.
00:35:20.574 - 00:35:24.454, Speaker A: Qset of m and a q.
00:35:24.494 - 00:35:55.284, Speaker B: Set of m just means that there exists a privileged ideal sheet with zero locals is equal to it. I'm just given here, I'm using this kind of in abuse because I didn't define it before. But that's what it means. It just means that there exists an ideal shift, a privileged ideal shift with zero locals to the set. Then for every k there exists k zero.
00:35:58.504 - 00:36:02.104, Speaker A: Such that x k zero.
00:36:02.264 - 00:36:17.804, Speaker B: Enter k is equal to xn interk for all n big or equal to k zero. So at some moment, even if the ideals are non autherian, at least from the point of view of set, we know that we stopped at some point.
00:36:18.104 - 00:36:19.616, Speaker A: And just to give the sketch of.
00:36:19.640 - 00:36:21.564, Speaker B: The proof before doing the details.
00:36:25.104 - 00:36:25.416, Speaker A: It'S.
00:36:25.440 - 00:36:36.460, Speaker B: Going to be an induction. So we may as well, by lemma, true, again, we know that, well, not.
00:36:36.492 - 00:36:37.824, Speaker A: Actually by language, yet.
00:36:39.924 - 00:36:51.044, Speaker B: Use this correctly. We may suppose that x one is.
00:36:51.084 - 00:37:00.216, Speaker A: Not m. And by le matching, we.
00:37:00.240 - 00:37:02.004, Speaker B: Know that the dimension on x one.
00:37:02.824 - 00:37:06.736, Speaker A: Has to be smaller than m. Right?
00:37:06.800 - 00:37:31.690, Speaker B: By Lema two and the uniformization theorem, we know that it has a well defined dimension and it has to be smaller than m just by the result that we just seen. Right. The household dimension has to be at most the dimension of m minus one. And Leman two says that essentially it has to have then dimension d minus.
00:37:31.722 - 00:37:33.454, Speaker A: One at more.
00:37:36.114 - 00:37:46.294, Speaker B: Or dimension d, right? If there was a part of dimension d, this would contradict them. That's the point. And then we just use inforization theorem.
00:37:53.974 - 00:38:03.470, Speaker A: Phi from n to m. Let me even call such that phi of n.
00:38:03.502 - 00:38:32.024, Speaker B: One is equal to m pullback. So we take l equal to phi minus one. Okay, it's compact because phi is proper. And we consider yk equals to phi minus one of xk for all k. It's again privileged because we can just pull back the ideal sheath, applying the.
00:38:35.644 - 00:38:38.984, Speaker A: Induction on the dimension.
00:38:43.224 - 00:38:44.920, Speaker B: Since the dimension.
00:38:44.952 - 00:38:50.204, Speaker A: Of m is smaller than the dimension of M.
00:38:57.784 - 00:38:59.800, Speaker B: And somehow as a consequence of this.
00:38:59.832 - 00:39:08.380, Speaker A: True, we even have something nice, at least for presentation, that q, oh, that's.
00:39:08.412 - 00:39:09.424, Speaker B: Z x.
00:39:12.964 - 00:39:21.464, Speaker A: Be a q set a in x.
00:39:22.324 - 00:39:32.572, Speaker B: Then there exists an open neighborhood u of a, and a function in Cuba.
00:39:32.588 - 00:39:33.144, Speaker A: View.
00:39:35.404 - 00:40:12.274, Speaker B: Such that x interview is simply the zero locals of it. And here I'm going to leave it on exercise. It's really not complicated, but there's something to prove, because the index, the generators of the ideal that is going to give us x locally, doesn't have to. Well, at least we don't know if it's countable. So there's something to adjust. But, but it's really very complicated. Oh, and the fact that there's only.
00:40:12.314 - 00:40:14.522, Speaker A: One function is simply because if you.
00:40:14.538 - 00:40:22.482, Speaker B: Are real and you find a number, find a number of functions, you just take the square and you sum all of them and you just get one function, and zero lock is going to give you the set.
00:40:22.538 - 00:40:23.134, Speaker A: Right?
00:40:38.174 - 00:41:06.246, Speaker B: There's nothing tired. And now in the last ten minutes, the only thing that I want, I don't want to show to prove anything. I just want to state the result for the more general case. So this result that we did forum, oops, okay, we thought and was foreclosed q sets. So that's something that we had already seen. And I just want to state it.
00:41:06.270 - 00:41:11.350, Speaker A: For the more general case of soup que sets.
00:41:11.462 - 00:41:16.766, Speaker B: So I need to give you the definition of it, and then maybe say.
00:41:16.790 - 00:41:20.044, Speaker A: A couple of words about how to prove it.
00:41:21.264 - 00:41:27.664, Speaker B: What is necessary for you to prove it? Okay, so let's start with a couple of definitions.
00:41:27.744 - 00:41:33.136, Speaker A: The first one, x in M is.
00:41:33.160 - 00:41:33.844, Speaker B: A q.
00:41:36.504 - 00:42:07.052, Speaker A: Same analytic set e. For every point a in x, there exists a neighborhood u of a and f I interview gij interview one small or.
00:42:07.068 - 00:42:09.984, Speaker B: Equal to I and j small or equal to some d.
00:42:12.294 - 00:42:14.806, Speaker A: Such that x.
00:42:14.910 - 00:42:22.354, Speaker B: Interview is nothing but the union from one e equals to one to d of the set fi equals to zero.
00:42:22.934 - 00:42:25.834, Speaker A: And gi bigger than zero.
00:42:26.614 - 00:42:35.398, Speaker B: This is going to be too semi analytic, exactly like the case of analytic. Now, we even have an explanation of why we just need one function, right?
00:42:35.446 - 00:42:40.266, Speaker A: Which tell us, and we don't have time.
00:42:40.290 - 00:42:53.054, Speaker B: I'm gonna, I'm not gonna give any example. I'm just gonna pass directly to the case of what is subclause analytic. We keep this definition in mind.
00:42:57.314 - 00:42:57.602, Speaker A: And.
00:42:57.618 - 00:42:58.970, Speaker B: Then we're gonna say that it contains.
00:42:59.002 - 00:43:02.134, Speaker A: In m is q.
00:43:03.894 - 00:43:05.394, Speaker B: So quad analytic.
00:43:10.174 - 00:43:16.954, Speaker A: If for every a there exists a neighborhood u of a.
00:43:26.974 - 00:43:28.272, Speaker B: Representing this one.
00:43:28.358 - 00:43:41.184, Speaker A: And y containing u prime bar k or some k aq.
00:43:43.524 - 00:43:44.904, Speaker B: Seminalytic set.
00:43:53.644 - 00:43:54.624, Speaker A: Look that.
00:43:56.534 - 00:43:57.834, Speaker B: If we denote.
00:44:01.334 - 00:44:02.394, Speaker A: Y PI.
00:44:02.974 - 00:44:04.234, Speaker B: The projection.
00:44:15.774 - 00:44:23.442, Speaker A: Then p of y is.
00:44:23.458 - 00:44:44.014, Speaker B: Equal to x and p restricted to y is proper. And then in this context, it is too possible to prove the uniformization theorem. So the uniformization theorem here reads.
00:44:46.454 - 00:44:47.030, Speaker A: Let.
00:44:47.142 - 00:44:50.314, Speaker B: X be a.
00:44:52.694 - 00:45:03.474, Speaker A: Closed use of analytic that there exists a proper.
00:45:08.054 - 00:45:09.074, Speaker B: Generically.
00:45:11.714 - 00:45:16.414, Speaker A: Immersive q map.
00:45:17.954 - 00:45:19.334, Speaker B: Do not understand when.
00:45:21.994 - 00:45:22.814, Speaker A: Map.
00:45:25.314 - 00:45:27.094, Speaker B: By roman.
00:45:27.474 - 00:45:43.542, Speaker A: Num such that v of n is equal to x. So this is the strongest version of.
00:45:43.558 - 00:46:06.954, Speaker B: The uniformization theorem that talks about causing an underneath. Now, in the last part, the last thing that I want to comment about is, first, one comment about the proof. The proof goes by basically three kinds of, of arguments. The first is the uniformization for.
00:46:14.134 - 00:46:15.154, Speaker A: Qset.
00:46:16.654 - 00:46:20.514, Speaker B: I remark on semi analytic.
00:46:20.854 - 00:46:25.022, Speaker A: So the following remark is the set.
00:46:25.078 - 00:46:37.250, Speaker B: Sorry, let me write like this. F of x big or equal to.
00:46:37.282 - 00:46:42.254, Speaker A: Zero, containing rn is the projection.
00:46:46.034 - 00:46:46.774, Speaker B: Of.
00:46:47.154 - 00:46:57.034, Speaker A: Y. F of x minus y squared equals to zero in rn plus one.
00:46:57.494 - 00:47:51.154, Speaker B: So for a semi analytic, you're going to be able to pass, apart from making a projection, at least if it's closed, to an analytic, to a q set. And the third thing, the first point is what is called the fiber cutting. Now, my point my wanted, since I don't have time, I'm not going to state it. I wanted to state it, but I was actually not going to use it at any point in the rest of the course. I just wanted to say that it's a useful result and why it is a useful result. And the idea here is that if we look at the definition, we're not saying anything about the dimension of Y compared about the dimension of X. And the fiber cutting lemma is what is going to allow us to have a relationship between this.
00:47:51.154 - 00:48:05.794, Speaker B: It is essentially going to say that we are able to given some projection from a y to an x y q, semi.
00:48:12.314 - 00:48:13.574, Speaker A: Quasi analytic.
00:48:14.634 - 00:48:20.414, Speaker B: Then for each one of the points, the dimension of the fiber might be big, right?
00:48:21.194 - 00:48:22.490, Speaker A: So you might, for example in here.
00:48:22.522 - 00:48:40.774, Speaker B: Have something of dimension one, which is the projection, but the y itself had dimension two. So there's nothing about the dimensions comparing y with x here. So the fiber cutting lemma essentially is going to be the technical result that says that you are allowed to choose.
00:48:40.814 - 00:48:45.078, Speaker A: In a nice way, some other q.
00:48:45.126 - 00:49:40.384, Speaker B: Set here, or semi cue set b to seminolytic, but of the right dimension. Of the right dimension. If you look like we haven't proved yet, the information theorem to define the dimension of s. But there's a way to, just as I did with the information theorem, there's a way to talk about it without actually defining the dimension. This is just a heuristic about it, right? Just a technical result about this. And this is a very, it's a quite useful result in combination of resolution of singularities. I'm going to talk a little bit more about it the next time when I make a little comment about Holon's biased weekly proof.
00:49:40.384 - 00:49:46.716, Speaker B: But really just a comment. I just want to make a comment about it and just, I want to.
00:49:46.740 - 00:49:50.984, Speaker A: Finish with some sort of exercise example.
00:49:51.644 - 00:50:00.344, Speaker B: Which is a classic example of a sub analytic set, which is not analytic, which comes from Osgoode. So let me just write.
00:50:06.284 - 00:50:07.024, Speaker A: Consider.
00:50:09.684 - 00:50:10.424, Speaker B: Phi.
00:50:11.924 - 00:50:13.904, Speaker A: R two in r three.
00:50:16.324 - 00:50:23.672, Speaker B: Given by Phi of uv equals to uv uv.
00:50:23.728 - 00:50:29.720, Speaker A: Exponential of v. Show that I of.
00:50:29.752 - 00:50:31.404, Speaker B: The unit ball.
00:50:33.584 - 00:50:44.524, Speaker A: Is supernalyric but not seminal.
00:50:48.104 - 00:50:53.494, Speaker B: This is the classical example of asking. So I'm finishing now. So thanks a lot for everyone.
00:50:53.794 - 00:50:54.974, Speaker A: I'll stop now.
00:50:56.314 - 00:50:58.574, Speaker B: We can close the recording.
00:51:00.114 - 00:51:03.794, Speaker A: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
