00:00:00.480 - 00:00:45.338, Speaker A: So, yeah, originally I was going to, of course, talk about something I've been working on, problems I think about. But then when I saw the title of this workshop, and especially that I was on computational day, I was like, oh, there is this other project that I did that would be such a good fit, except that it's just really not my area. But it's Frank's birthday and it's closer to his area, so it felt like the polite thing to do. I am going to talk about a problem that I worked on with Paul Bryden, Gabrielle Ong and Linus Sommer. When I first got to MPI as a postdoc, it was an oauth. And so Gabriel and Linus were undergraduates at the time. And I want you to think of this talk as like a very big, a glorified open problem presentation.
00:00:45.338 - 00:01:22.372, Speaker A: So, I didn't submit a problem to you, Taylor, because I'm just going to use my time slot to present. And the other good news is, it probably won't take me all 40 minutes or whatever to get through this. And so if you give, there'll be extra time at the end that you all can, you know, there's like 40 of you, you can like, you know, take the extra ten minutes, times 40, that's 400 minutes. You could probably, probably solve, solve this problem before the coffee break. Okay, so this problem is a variance of a very classical problem. So there's this problem called Steinler's conic problem. And what it asked was how many conics tangent to five generic conics in the plane.
00:01:22.372 - 00:01:49.892, Speaker A: Okay, so I just kind of put, you know, randomly think five conics in the plane, and I can ask how many conants are tangent to these. So originally, sin of the conjecture that the answer was six to the five. And you can phrase this problem actually as a system of polynomial equations. And the six to the five would actually be the bazoo bound of that system of equations. Now, the issue is that this isn't a generic system of polynomial equations. It's very structured. And so this is an overcount.
00:01:49.892 - 00:02:28.182, Speaker A: So the true answer is 3264. And part of the reason of this overcount is, in the space of all conics, there's a surface that consists of these double lines, right? And so really, you don't want to consider this problem in the space of all conics. You want to consider it what's called the space of complete conics. It doesn't matter, but we don't want to have these double lines. And so this is part of the reason that there was this, this overcount. Um, I just want to say there's, there's a couple very nice references on this kind of classical version of the problem and how you can count out this 3264. And so here's two.
00:02:28.182 - 00:02:52.180, Speaker A: But um, kind of largely speaking the complex version of this problem has, has had an answer for, you know, over 100 years now. Okay, 100. Over 160 years. Yes. So, um, fine. But there's actually maybe a more interesting variant of this problem which is the real version. So what the real version would say is suppose I give you five real conic.
00:02:52.180 - 00:02:58.620, Speaker A: So just five conics in the plane. What is the maximum number of real conics tangent to c one through c?
00:02:58.652 - 00:02:59.252, Speaker B: Five.
00:02:59.428 - 00:03:18.714, Speaker A: Of course, 3264 is going to be an upper bound because that's the complex bound. But it's not clear that this is achievable, right. That there exists a configuration of five conics such that all 3264 tangent conics.
00:03:22.134 - 00:03:23.862, Speaker B: Didn'T bother intersection theory.
00:03:23.958 - 00:03:32.446, Speaker A: Ah, okay. Yeah. So perfect. Thank you, Frank. See, this is great. This was the one. I was like, oh, I'm nervous about talking about this because I don't really know the area that well.
00:03:32.446 - 00:04:07.974, Speaker A: But I'm like, well, Frank will know the answer to every question. So I'm actually. Am I in the clue here? But, okay. The answer is that there does exist, that this does exist. And so there's this theorem. And it's what they do. The argument is that they argue that if I degenerate my conics, my five conics into double lines that in a neighborhood of this non generic, kind of special degenerated configuration there exists 3264 real conics.
00:04:07.974 - 00:05:01.804, Speaker A: And you can count this by doing kind of classical geometry and counting conics tangent to lines that pass through points. And so Frank has a nice whole webpage as well as a chapter in his book that goes through this. And then Berlin has a really nice paper with Paul Breiting and Sasha Timm where they go through this as well and kind of consider a more constructive version of the question, namely, you know, can I give you an explicit configuration of five conics that, that achieves this? Okay, so this is kind of the context for the problem we consider. Uh, and we want to consider a variant of this. So instead of considering conics tangent to conics, we want to consider circles tangent to conics. And again, we want to consider both volusion. So now, you know, a circle is defined by, by itself its center and its radius.
00:05:01.804 - 00:05:41.154, Speaker A: So there's no circles tangent to five generic conics. So the right number of conics to consider now is three. And so we want to ask both versions of sinus problem for circle. So I want to say, suppose I give you three general conics in c two, how many circles are tangent to all three conics? And then we want to also consider the real region. So suppose I give you three general real conics. How many real circles are tangent to all three conics? And kind of more importantly, what's the maximum number of real circles that I could find? Okay, so this is good. Okay, so I want to go through with both of these questions.
00:05:41.154 - 00:06:04.896, Speaker A: And so, kind of as before, it makes sense usually, you know, real geometry is harder than complex a lot of times. And so it makes sense to start with the complex version. So, let's kind of write this out. And so the first thing is, I'm going to define my conics just. Okay. It makes more sense actually to define this in projective five space. But just kind of for ease of everything, I'm going to just kind of define everything finely.
00:06:04.896 - 00:06:51.102, Speaker A: And so I'm going to suppose that you give me six complex parameters and those are going to define my conic. And then the conic is the set of x y, that's a zero of this polynomial equation. In addition, a circle is going to be defined by its center and radius, and it also is the set of points that satisfy this equation. And so I'm going to consider three polynomials of the form q. So I'm going to assume, you know, that a through f are given and then I want to find equations of this form of the circle form that are tangent to the conics. Now, a circle and an a conic of course, will generically intersect four times in the complex plane. And what a tangent intersection means is that it has multiplicity two.
00:06:51.102 - 00:07:44.676, Speaker A: And so this can also be phrased as a polynomial condition, namely that the gradients of each are linearly dependent. Okay, so, putting this together, I'm going to assume I fix my three conics in the plane and I'm also going to introduce new variables, which will be my points of tangency on these conics. So, the conditions of a circle being tangent to the conic need to satisfy the following three constraints. So first, of course, these points of tangency need to be on the conic for each conic. In addition, the points of tangency need to be on the circle for each circle. And then finally, we need to have this multiplicity two intersection, which are these determinantal constraints. And so, kind of putting everything all together, what I'm really interested in studying is the following parameterized polynomial system, which consists of nine equations and nine unknowns.
00:07:44.676 - 00:08:09.002, Speaker A: So my unknowns are the U's and V's and the ST and U. So the points of tangency and the center and radius of the circle. And my parameters are that a's, B's and C's are the coefficients defining each of the comics. Okay, good. So this is our setup. And now let's go back to our first problem. So suppose I give you three general conics in the complex plane.
00:08:09.002 - 00:08:37.274, Speaker A: How many circles are tangent to all three conics? Well, one. Ooh, sorry. One thing is we can just look at this polynomial system. See, I've got nine equations of degree two. And so I can use Bazoo's bound and say that there's at most 512 complex circles tangent. Okay. But this actually is an overcount because again, we have this issue with these double lines, right? That's going to throw this off.
00:08:37.274 - 00:09:12.746, Speaker A: And so, in some work of Emilis and Salmis, they show that actually there's at most 184 such circles. Now, they show this. They specifically consider the cases of all of iconic ellipses, but the set of ellipses is open in the space of volcanic. So this still applies to us as well. And they show this using kind of a mixed volume computation and a resultant computation. And when I was looking at the paper going through it, they also cited just the upper bound is 184 citation. And I looked and it just said, personal communication with Frank.
00:09:12.746 - 00:09:29.290, Speaker A: So t lay around 2005. So that's. That's great. Yes, yes, exactly. And so, okay, so the answer is that most 184. And the first thing is. Well, okay, genetically it's 184, right? This isn't.
00:09:29.290 - 00:09:29.610, Speaker A: So.
00:09:29.682 - 00:09:31.554, Speaker B: It's actually, when I said the post.
00:09:31.594 - 00:09:57.294, Speaker A: 184 reaction, it is 184, right? They didn't phrase it like that. Yes, well, yeah, exactly. Yes, exactly. Exactly. And so we actually voted off, though. So, okay. But, yeah, okay, so that's the answer to the complex solution.
00:09:57.294 - 00:10:21.472, Speaker A: But like Frank said, not a terribly challenging argument, really. Analogous to the. To the Steiner's problem argument as well. So, okay, 184 complex circles tangent to three conics. Great. But of course, you know, from the get go, we were really just interested in the real version of this question. And so, again, this question is.
00:10:21.472 - 00:11:10.794, Speaker A: Now, suppose I give you three general real conics. How many real circles are tangent to all three of them? And specifically, what is the maximum number of real circles I can have? So kind of, for any configuration of three real conics, what's the maximum number of circles? That can be tangent to all three. Well, I'm talking generically. I don't want, you know, don't do something where there's like infinitely many solutions or anything like this. Okay? So of course we have one upper bound, which is 184, right? So those are most 184 real circles because there's most 184 complex ones. But the question is, is that exact? And that's really what this open problem is, is, is this exact? And, uh, we were specifically interested in, in finding Conex with the maximum number of real tangent circles. So kind of explicit instances if we can.
00:11:10.794 - 00:11:55.038, Speaker A: Okay. And so we tried three things, and I will walk you through each of the, the ideas that we tried so that when you solve this problem, you know, not to, you know, you know what's already been attempted. And so the first idea, the most natural one of course, is to apply that same degeneration arguments as in Steiner's problem. So now in this case, instead of degenerating to five double lines, I have three conic. So I'm going to degenerate to three double lines. So that is a triangle. And what I want to do is I want to use the same kind of counting argument to say, okay, in a neighborhood of this degeneration, what's the maximum number of real circles I can have? And unfortunately, the answer is not 184.
00:11:55.038 - 00:12:30.264, Speaker A: The answer is 136. And I can walk you through at a high level overview why that is. But you know, at this point, the main takeaway is we can't just do what's already been done, unfortunately. Okay, so why does this fail? Right? Well, it fails because of some kind of classical geometry reason. So the proof idea here is, as I said, I'm going to take my three conics, I'm going to generate it to three double lines. So I have a triangle. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to consider each of my three lines, and then I'm going to consider a point in the interior of each of the lines.
00:12:30.264 - 00:12:50.350, Speaker A: And then what I do is I can consider every subset of lines and points. And so maybe I can just draw this so it's a little more clear. So I've got here my double conic. So let's say this is line one. And then on line one I've got 0.1, this is line two. On line two I've got 0.2,
00:12:50.350 - 00:13:11.970, Speaker A: and then this is line three. And on line three I have 0.3 at the origin. And then what I want to do is in my set of three lines, I want to consider every possible subset of lines and then union with the points not on that line. So, for instance, one subset, I would consider, say, lines one and line two. And then. .3.
00:13:11.970 - 00:13:30.554, Speaker A: Yeah, no, on the boundary. So on the boundary of the triangle. So this is on the lines. These are points exactly on the lines. Okay. Okay. And then for.
00:13:30.554 - 00:13:44.942, Speaker A: Okay, you can. In this case, you can actually just verify this directly. But apparently all of my co authors actually knew that this was a classical geometry result. They're like, oh, yeah, we learned this in high school. And, okay, I. I don't think I did. But, um, they.
00:13:44.942 - 00:14:16.134, Speaker A: It's not so hard to verify directly that, uh, there's two to this number of complex circles tangent to the given lines in s. That pants through the points, uh, on the line, not an s. Okay, so. So what does that do? Well, of course, then we have to use the binomial coefficients, because I have to consider every choice, right, of. Of, you know, one line, two lines, three lines, zero lines. And I get this many complex circles that are tangents, uh, to. To my.
00:14:16.134 - 00:14:49.026, Speaker A: My con x here. And then what I do is, is I would want to do at least, is say, okay, if all 23 are real, then what I can do is I can replace these double conics by a hyperbola that's kind of asymptotically close to these double lines. So just think like really skinny, um, really skinny hyperbolas. And then for each pill, PI li, I would get two, uh, two additional circles. And so in total, that would give me two to the three times 23, which is 184 real circles. Okay. This is what we wanted to do.
00:14:49.026 - 00:14:57.134, Speaker A: And this was essentially what was done in Steiner's problem. But you have to consider the other cases because it's a. It's a pentagon. So it's. It's just. So this. This counting bit is different.
00:14:57.134 - 00:15:16.404, Speaker A: Yeah. No, so I'm considering points on the interior, like on the triangle. Yeah. Okay. And so, um, what I need to do is I need to figure out. So this is the complex number, right. And I need to figure out if this is, in fact, the real number.
00:15:16.404 - 00:15:31.770, Speaker A: And the answer is, it's not in one of the cases. So I don't even know if you can see these pictures, but. Okay, you know, the. The main takeaway here is if I want to say how many circles go through three points, the answer is one. And so here would be my three red points. And this is my circle. Okay.
00:15:31.770 - 00:16:11.904, Speaker A: How many circles go through two points in the line? There's two real ones, two complex ones. That can be achieved with real ones, as seen here. Now, the situation of how many circles go through one point and a tangent to two lines? There's four complex circles, but only two of them can be real. Okay, this is the issue. And so this is where we lose this case is where we lose our count, essentially. And so then when we do this count instead, what we get is 136 real silicones, which is, of course, not 184. And so that's why this degeneration argument, unfortunately, did not work out.
00:16:11.904 - 00:16:48.058, Speaker A: And so when I. So Paul Breiting was the one who suggested this problem for the Liu. And when I knew a bit about Steinu's problem, and I kind of just assumed, you know, it's an alu, it's a couple weeks that this, you know, it would just be 184, and we'd all call it a day, and we'd be good to go. And then at this point, when we realized it wasn't, it's like, oh, man, this problem just got a lot ugly. Right? This might not be an ugly you problem anymore. Okay, so we wanted to try something else at this point. And our second idea was, okay, um, maybe.
00:16:48.058 - 00:17:26.096, Speaker A: Oh, sorry, this cut off a bit. So, uh, maybe this, this kind of direct geometrical union isn't going to work. But at the end of the day, I still have this parameterized polynomial system that I can play with. And there's this family of algorithms called hill climbing algorithms, which allow you to move around in parameter space to try to find instances, uh, where you have more real solutions. And so, recall, this is our parameterized polynomial system that. That we're talking about. So, so the idea here is that I would start with some instances of my a's, b's, and C's, and then I have, you know, my certain solutions.
00:17:26.096 - 00:18:24.144, Speaker A: And then I want to move around in the space, the 18 dimensional space of the a, B's, and C's to hopefully find instances with mole wheel solutions. And so the key idea here is that I can linearize my parameterized polynomial system. And so here, this jack, sub x, this is the jacobian of my polynomial system with respect to x. And the jacks of p is the jacobian with respect to the parameters p. And what you see here is I've got this nice linear relationship that expresses the change in one of my solutions as a function of the change in my parameters. And so what I want to do is I want to consider some solution that is not real, and I want to minimize the one norm of the imaginary parts of this solution. And using this relationship above, I can express this as a linear function in the change of parameters.
00:18:24.144 - 00:19:20.788, Speaker A: And so, what I want to consider is the following optimization problem. So, I want to minimize over my change in parameters, and I want to minimize, yes, the one norm of the change in the imaginary part of one of my solutions. And then my constraints here are, I think, kind of natural constraints. So, the first one says that this linearization is only accurate in a neighborhood, of course, of my point, right? So I don't want to go too far, because then this approximation, this linear approximation is no good. The second one says that as I move in my parameter space and I try to drive this one complex conjugate pair together, I want to make sure any existing real solutions I have still, I don't want to simultaneously drive one complex conjugate pair together and two real solutions together, so that my number of real solutions doesn't actually change. And then the final one says, I don't want any of my other solutions. I don't want them to go off to infinity.
00:19:20.788 - 00:19:58.598, Speaker A: I'm kind of trying to get myself through my real discriminants and get a point with multiplicity and then push it into two distinct real points. And the key here is, this is actually a linear, I mean, I wrote it a little vaguely because the notation does get, you know, not, you know, super pleasant, but this is a linear program, so it can be solved efficiently. And we outlined it in our paper. And it's also outlined, let me see in this citation, this, this paper of deep myelin. Okay. Okay. So that is step one.
00:19:58.598 - 00:20:46.526, Speaker A: So, I took a complex conjugate paper and I drove it together really good. But now what I have is I've got, essentially, instead of having two distinct solutions, a complex conjugate pill, I've got r1 solution with multiplicity two, and I'm looking for generic instances. So I want these, I don't want multiplicity. I want two distinct solutions. And so in this case, what I want to do now is I want to maximize the two norm, the distance between my two now real solutions. And again, I can, uh, express, I can use the same linear relationship above and express the, the change in the distance of these two solutions as a fun, a linear function in the change of parameters. And so I get a very similar optimization problem to the one we just considered, except for now my objective function has changed.
00:20:46.526 - 00:21:40.560, Speaker A: Instead of minimizing the one norm of the imaginary part, I'm trying to maximize, um, the, essentially the change in the distance between these two solutions. But that's still a linear function, and then I still subject it to the same constraints, because as before, I still don't want any other two real solutions to come together, nor any other solutions to go off to infinity. Okay, so this is the main idea. And, um, well, it, it worked a little bit. I mean, it worked to the extent that using this, we were able to find an explicit instance of three conics with n real tritangent circles for each n between zero and 136. And so here's just a little cartoon drawing of, you know, for instance, when there's two real circles, here's your configuration of Conex, right? So just, we're able to kind of be really explicit, and then we can certify each solution. And so it's, we can be concrete.
00:21:40.560 - 00:22:18.274, Speaker A: Um, and maybe specifically, most interesting, we can get, you know, the following. Condenses a really explicit instance where this is the maximum number of wheel circles, but it's only 136. Oh, and I should say we used our previous result to get to this 136. Namely, we looked in a neighborhood of two double lines and then ran hill climbing from there. And. Okay, we got to this. But, okay, yeah, it's still not 184, right? So we still have not found an instance of more than 136 real tritangent circles using either the deformation argument or this hill climbing algorithm.
00:22:18.274 - 00:23:33.204, Speaker A: Okay, so then this brings us to our final attempt, which is like the most vague, and we don't know the most, which was, okay, essentially what I have in my parameter space. So I've got this 18 dimensional parameter space, and there's some hyper surface that, that goes through this space that divides the space into cells. And in each cell, my number of real solutions to this parameterized polynomial system is constant. So in other words, it divides my space of conics into cells, where the number of circles, real circles, tangent to all three conics, is constant. So we thought, well, maybe if we understand this real discriminant, you know, enough, whatever that means, if we could get a handle on this, maybe we could say something and understand the nature of these cells a bit more. So, um, okay, just, just to be clear, when I say real discriminate hue, what I mean is, is a hyposurface in my space of parameters, where a point is on the discriminant if and only if the number of solutions to this parameterized polynomial system is not locally constant. So it's, it's the, the points where my number of real solutions, uh, changes and any configuration of conex on the discriminant, what we call degenerate.
00:23:33.204 - 00:24:08.270, Speaker A: Okay, so what we were able to show is the following. Here is a classification of the conics that are on our discriminant. Okay? So let's go through these. So, I say that an arrangement of three real conics is degenerate if and only if one of the following happens. So, the first one is that there's a real line of tangent to my three conics. So I can make me draw these out. So, think of something like this, where I have, um, a line like this, and then maybe Hughes conic one, Hughes conic two, and Hughes conic three.
00:24:08.270 - 00:24:27.938, Speaker A: So that's situation one. So just a line is tangent to all three conics. A real line. Okay. The next one is that the three conics intersect in a real point. So this is something like. Something like this, maybe.
00:24:27.938 - 00:24:43.730, Speaker A: And I realize I'm drawing ellipses for all of them, but that's just because I think it's easier. But these could be hyperbolas, too. So this is something as follows. So this is, you know, these are. Both of. These are kind of clearly non generic situations. Um, the next is that one of the conics is.
00:24:43.730 - 00:24:58.154, Speaker A: Is singular, essentially. So this is. One of them is a double line. So, uh, let me see. Just anything that looks like a double line and then use a hyperbola.
00:24:59.494 - 00:25:02.274, Speaker B: How about just a line? Two lines.
00:25:05.254 - 00:25:21.090, Speaker A: That's true, too. Instead of a double line, this could also have been one line like this. And then this could also be. Yeah, exactly. Tangent. Okay. Um, let's see.
00:25:21.090 - 00:25:38.066, Speaker A: What is number four? So, this is that, uh, two of the conics intersect tangentially. So, of course, two conics can intersect non tangentially. But what. At a real point. But what I mean is, I have something like this. So. So, um, there's an intersection like this, and then the fifth one.
00:25:38.066 - 00:26:14.718, Speaker A: Um, let me see if I. So, this one, it sounds a little weird, but it just kind of came out of the door looking at the jacobian dropping rank and solutions at infinity. And what this one says is, okay, essentially, I can't have one of my. I can't have a situation where one of my circles is two. Let's see. Okay, maybe that's plausible enough. So I can't have a point of tangency where the normal vector for both the conic and the circle are in the same direction.
00:26:14.718 - 00:26:37.654, Speaker A: And also the curvature at both is the same. So I can't have this, like, nicely nested situation like this. This one maybe is, like, the least clue why that couldn't hold. But like I said, it just kind of comes out very naturally from looking at the jacobian dropping. Yes. Because the hedge didn't do. Absolutely.
00:26:37.654 - 00:26:40.344, Speaker A: Yes. Yes. Okay. That's true.
00:26:46.124 - 00:26:47.464, Speaker B: Given that configuration.
00:26:54.964 - 00:27:00.624, Speaker A: Right? Yes, yes. Yeah.
00:27:03.504 - 00:27:04.484, Speaker B: Irreducible.
00:27:08.864 - 00:27:30.304, Speaker A: Yeah. So genetically it would be. Right. If I had a generic polynomial system, it would be irreducible in the space of coefficients. But my polynomial system isn't generic. It's kind of even, like, parameters. Yeah, last one.
00:27:30.304 - 00:27:36.828, Speaker A: You mean, like, is the last one a hyper?
00:27:36.996 - 00:27:41.784, Speaker B: Each of these define a variety in these basic triple.
00:27:49.324 - 00:27:55.732, Speaker A: Hyperservice. Yeah. I'm not sure. I guess we didn't look to, but. Yeah, of course. Because some of these might be. Yeah.
00:27:55.732 - 00:28:03.764, Speaker A: Not. Yes, that's possible.
00:28:06.904 - 00:28:19.560, Speaker B: The other ones are also special. One and two is a resultant, four is attacked in variant. But five is what it means. Do you know the degree of this?
00:28:19.752 - 00:28:33.124, Speaker A: Assuming five is a hypothesis, so, no, we couldn't, I mean, this is hq two. We couldn't actually compute these things. Right. So this is some 18. You know, I'm looking for some polynomial and 18 variables, that's my guess, would be high degree. Right. And we couldn't compute it.
00:28:33.124 - 00:28:37.836, Speaker A: You know, that was. Okay. But even if you could, I mean, I'm, you know, not sure if it.
00:28:37.860 - 00:28:50.164, Speaker B: Helps you take two conics. Just take a one family of other connectors to be tangent to the line. You want those tangent lines.
00:28:54.224 - 00:28:55.084, Speaker C: I understand.
00:28:55.664 - 00:29:00.204, Speaker B: These are at least the first one. I don't know if this hyperscript is tangent.
00:29:00.824 - 00:29:25.070, Speaker A: Yeah, we didn't look, I mean, that's, that would probably be the natural. That would be the first thing probably, to look at. Okay. Like, one of these components actually matter is another way of saying this. Yeah. To be honest, I think at this point, we just, there was not a lot of direction of like, okay, even, like, how does this help? Because, okay, even if you knew the dimension, I think that's step one. But we care about the cells.
00:29:25.070 - 00:29:36.238, Speaker A: We care. Right. And so the bout, you know, what, of these components around the boundaries of different cells too. I mean, this is. Yeah. It just wasn't clear. It wasn't clear.
00:29:36.238 - 00:30:45.080, Speaker A: How this could help is really the main story. And to Bailen's point, we couldn't compute it. But, okay, even if we could, I'm not sure that that would help with a, without, I'm not sure how, having an explicit polynomial in these 18 variables, which I'm saying, this is my discriminant, I'm not sure how that would help me still say that there's at most 136 real solutions, because this polynomial is probably quite nasty to deal with. Right. Okay, but let me just sum up and say, yeah, okay, we did it. And that's very nice, but it's still not at all clear how this helps us answer this main open question. So this is really the main point of this shorter talk, but longer open problem presentation is to say, does there exist a configuration of three real conics with 184 tritangent circles? Or also, can you prove that no such configuration exists? Can you prove that 136 is the maximum, or can you prove that they just has to be less than 182? I think I, you know, I think that would still be just as interesting in some sense.
00:30:45.080 - 00:31:30.450, Speaker A: And part of the issue is, when we were looking, you know, through literature, of course, of these numerative problems is, it really seemed like most of those problems, the real. The maximum number of real solutions was the complex bound. So there was a, you know, an instance of whatever objects you were considering were, you know, the maximum number of the number of, you know, whatever other object you were considering that's tangent to passes through whatever is all real. Right. And so we didn't really have a lot of other things to work with here. And so with that, I said I would end ten minutes early and so that you all can spend the next ten minutes solving this. And I'll just end with, happy birthday, fuangai.
00:31:30.450 - 00:31:48.936, Speaker A: Yes. I'm sorry we couldn't solve this for you birthday, but, you know, we did the best we could. Yes. Question. So often when the real count is below the complex count, then the Galois group is smaller than expected.
00:31:49.040 - 00:31:50.128, Speaker D: What about the Galois group?
00:31:50.176 - 00:32:05.344, Speaker A: I think it's a full symmetric group, if I remember. Almost the full symmetric group. Yeah. But is that. Is that, um. Is there a result that says that if it's. It's okay? Okay.
00:32:06.004 - 00:32:08.132, Speaker C: I mean, I mean, so, so what?
00:32:08.188 - 00:32:24.264, Speaker B: What? Okay, if you have some structure in the possible number of real solutions, like gaps or. Or other things, then this could come about because the galvan is smaller than expected.
00:32:33.544 - 00:32:40.624, Speaker A: Oh, and Gabriel. Oh, Gabriel. Hey, Gabriel. He confirms. Okay. It is the full symmetrical. Great.
00:32:40.624 - 00:32:41.964, Speaker A: Okay, perfect. Yeah.
00:32:48.584 - 00:33:24.334, Speaker E: So I just wanted to make a comment on a lead in case anybody is interested in solving this today for Frank's birthday. If you only degenerate two of the conics to double lines, but you keep the third conic, just a conic, then you decompose into, like, tangent to a conic, tangent to a line, or tangent to a point. Those sub problems, and individually, those problems do have enough real solutions where, when you do the count you get above 134, but I don't know if all those sub problems can be totally real.
00:33:24.754 - 00:33:26.694, Speaker A: I see. Okay. Yeah.
00:33:27.994 - 00:33:41.334, Speaker E: Even individually, I don't know if they can all be totally real. But we could find instances where you got enough real solutions to get higher than 134. Not to 180 or 136, but not to the 180.
00:33:42.034 - 00:33:50.194, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. We can. Yeah. That's probably the next natural thing to try in some senses. Is there a different degeneration that we could.
00:33:50.354 - 00:33:53.534, Speaker E: Yeah, it's a little less special.
00:33:54.194 - 00:34:15.254, Speaker B: There's a good chance you're not going to see a hundred. So these are, it's known that if you're, if you have lines and real points in convex position as well, then you'll always find the correct number of conjuncts that are tangent lines or passive points. And that's actually how. One way of proving this pentagon. I'm sorry. Because.
00:34:17.054 - 00:34:32.582, Speaker C: It'S known that everything's a real and convex position, then you find the expected number of conics tangent to the lines and through the points. But because the two circular points in infinity are not real, and I don't know what convexity means there, that's an obstruction to finding them.
00:34:32.758 - 00:34:33.302, Speaker A: Yes.
00:34:33.398 - 00:34:38.314, Speaker C: That's probably why you. That's one reason. You find out why, but it suggests why you can't do that.
00:34:38.734 - 00:34:39.474, Speaker A: Right.
00:34:40.254 - 00:34:53.904, Speaker C: But there are other examples. I mean, I mean, I one time wrote a silly little paper where looked at four triangles in space and looked at lines that simultaneously meet one edge for each of the triangles. And you can show that not all are, not all can be real.
00:34:54.604 - 00:34:55.372, Speaker A: Okay.
00:34:55.508 - 00:34:57.252, Speaker C: Which is a different sort of a question.
00:34:57.348 - 00:34:57.984, Speaker A: Right.
00:35:10.324 - 00:35:54.432, Speaker F: Two things. The first thing is, am I coming through the speaker? Is this working? Okay, good. The first thing is, you talked about starting with double lines and then seeing that you couldn't get them all of the circles to be real when you had double lines because of this one case. And so my first question would be, do you know if the kinds of techniques involved in hill climbing would make it possible to take a more generic configuration and then to try to move it into this special configuration to see if you could do that without reducing the number of real solutions?
00:35:54.568 - 00:36:01.448, Speaker A: You mean don't initialize my hill climbing in a neighborhood of double lines, initialize it someplace else and then try to.
00:36:01.456 - 00:36:02.472, Speaker F: Go to double lines and then try.
00:36:02.488 - 00:36:03.144, Speaker A: To go to double lines.
00:36:03.184 - 00:36:09.334, Speaker F: And if you could do that in a hill climbing way, then that would mean that you'd started with fewer than 136.
00:36:09.914 - 00:36:38.574, Speaker A: So the 136 is very real, let me say. I don't think we found that. Oh, Gabriel, maybe you can say yes or no. I don't know if we found that. Naturally, by randomly initializing. I think we had to initialize in a neighborhood of this special configuration to get there. But if I do just randomly initialize, say, the hill climbing will take you from, I don't know, maybe an instance where you have 80 wheel solutions to 110 wheel solutions, something like this.
00:36:38.574 - 00:36:50.382, Speaker A: It's effective to a point. It can bump you up by a non trivial margin. But I think, if I remember right, it wouldn't get you just all the way to the 136th. Maybe we would have had.
00:36:50.518 - 00:37:01.114, Speaker F: I'm not trying to get to the 136. I'm wondering if you could try to make your system less generic, make it more special by trying to deform two, where you have only double lines.
00:37:01.704 - 00:37:05.624, Speaker A: Oh, you mean, like, guide the hill climbing algorithms in such a way that.
00:37:05.664 - 00:37:29.924, Speaker F: You know you're not losing solutions. And then you would. You would have already known from your previous analysis that your. Your total of the end would. Would be at most 136. So if something like that were possible, then it would maybe give you a bound. The second question that I had was, could you show us the definitions of the cases you put on the board one more time? Yeah, I just wanted to read five a little more carefully.
00:37:29.924 - 00:37:30.708, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:37:30.836 - 00:37:42.024, Speaker A: Yes. Oops. Yes. And this is actually in a paper that's published called real Circles, tangent to three. Oh, the name of the talk. Real circles, tangent to three conics. Yeah.
00:37:43.924 - 00:37:52.904, Speaker B: These are triple quadrants that have a. One of the convex tangents to iron.
00:38:02.624 - 00:38:10.208, Speaker G: So I have a comment that might help. Frank mentioned that the circle points at infinity might have something to do with it.
00:38:10.256 - 00:38:10.696, Speaker A: Yes.
00:38:10.800 - 00:38:41.402, Speaker G: If you switch to an isotropic coordinates and work in a two homogeneous space, then the circle points at infinity aren't there anymore. So when you look at it that way, if you don't know what isotropic is, it's basically, instead of x squared plus y squared equals r squared, you do x times x conjugate. And then your notion of real is that the conjugate really is the conjugate.
00:38:41.578 - 00:38:48.842, Speaker A: Right. We didn't try that, but that would be nice to look at as well.
00:38:48.938 - 00:38:50.098, Speaker B: Non standard real spark.
00:38:50.186 - 00:38:53.174, Speaker A: Right. That. Yes. That's great. Yes.
00:39:02.194 - 00:39:03.042, Speaker D: Can you also.
00:39:03.138 - 00:39:03.774, Speaker A: Hi.
00:39:06.634 - 00:39:15.694, Speaker D: Can you please, like, see the result on 136, this thing, Conex? Because what was this thing about at most 136 solutions?
00:39:16.524 - 00:39:17.852, Speaker A: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
00:39:17.868 - 00:39:20.948, Speaker D: There was a theorem about at most 136 solutions. Right.
00:39:21.076 - 00:39:22.012, Speaker A: Real solutions. Yes.
00:39:22.068 - 00:39:29.304, Speaker D: So why is it so if it is already mentioned at most. How. Why are we trying to, like, find more 184?
00:39:29.684 - 00:39:32.052, Speaker A: Oh, we just wanted an explicit instance.
00:39:32.228 - 00:39:33.676, Speaker D: Can you show that slide again?
00:39:33.860 - 00:39:51.174, Speaker A: Maybe I'm not understanding, but, you know, there's kind of two, like, does. It's, like, constructive, right. It's kind of nice to be constructive in a sense. So, okay, this argument, we kind of use a really analogous thing to what's done in Steiner's problem. Say, okay, that exists 136. But sometimes it's nice to just have the object. Right.
00:39:51.174 - 00:39:55.798, Speaker A: And so we just wanted an act, you know, just interested in getting the actual.
00:39:55.886 - 00:40:04.114, Speaker D: So I thought there was a previous slide where it was mentioned as a theorem where there were at most 136 solution. Or did I misunderstand?
00:40:06.774 - 00:40:26.988, Speaker A: Yes. Just in a neighborhood. So that's the issue, right? If. If we could show. If we would have shown that in any neighborhood of the discriminant, you know, okay, we would have won, but we could only show in a neighborhood of the special configuration. And the reason why, you know, we would consider that in the first place is because of this classical result of Stein.
00:40:27.116 - 00:40:28.424, Speaker D: Okay, thank you.
00:40:30.804 - 00:40:43.982, Speaker A: But yes. Yes, it would be. Yes, you could show in any neighborhood, you know, of. You know, maybe this was. Maybe, you know, if you could show in any neighborhood of. Of this. Of one of these cases, you get at most 136.
00:40:43.982 - 00:40:46.114, Speaker A: Okay, then we win.
00:40:47.654 - 00:40:48.794, Speaker D: Other questions?
00:40:51.494 - 00:40:52.214, Speaker A: Thank Julia. Again.
