00:00:02.320 - 00:01:07.954, Speaker A: Before going to further representation theorem, let's answer a question which was posed right before the break. Is u unique? It is interesting indeed, because I choose the sequence one minus one over n to go toward the boundary. And even from that sequence, I took some subsequences. Somebody might take other subsequences, or even from the very beginning, it starts from another sequence. So at the end of the day, do we arrive at the same function? The answer is yes. And there are two ways to answer this question. One, which was the uniqueness theorem that we saw yesterday, if u is represented by one over two PI integral of pr.
00:01:07.954 - 00:02:29.450, Speaker A: I don't write that the arguments, I mean, just to explain what happens, but by the integral of p one, and at the same time by the integral of u two, then we see that integral of pr u one minus u two is equal to zero. And yesterday we saw two uniqueness theorem, and one of them was precisely this one, even in more general format. So the uniqueness theorem says that the u one minus u two is identically zero. I remind you, the theorem, recall, the theorems said that if integral of pr d mu is zero, then mu is identically zero. Even for a measure, this is an absolutely continuous measure. But even in the general case, if we consider a measure which might have the singular parts, but its integral with respect to p is zero, then mu has to be zero. That's the uniqueness theorem we saw yesterday.
00:02:29.450 - 00:03:48.340, Speaker A: That's one way to do it. There is another way, which still, it's an interesting result and lies deeper. It says that if you have such a representation, I mean, I write this in detail because I mean potent trm of fatuum, if u is given by a Poisson integral t dt. And even. Let me to give you the most general setting, not just the way I wrote here, is a measure which is absolutely continuous. The general case, they put two PI with t here. That's good.
00:03:48.340 - 00:04:53.944, Speaker A: This is the absolute part that we have, but it might also have a singular part. So I add here, plus the sigma e to the it. You know that any measure can be decomposed in this way. So in other words, I put a measured d mu here. But instead of writing d mu, I did it more explicitly. I did the decomposition with respect to lobec measure, the singular part and the absolutely continuous part. And then fatu says that lim r goes to one ur e to the I theta exists and is equal to the little one almost every valentine.
00:04:53.944 - 00:05:48.254, Speaker A: And we cannot do better than that. The limit exists, is equal to the absolutely continuous part of the measure. It answers over previous questions, because here, if u is represented by a Poisson integral of u one and also poisson integral of u two, when we go to boundary with capital u, the limit is equal to u one and also is equal to u two almost everywhere. So u one has to be equal to u two. That is why we recover uniqueness from this theorem. This theorem is more important than what we used here. But still, it answers the question you wanted.
00:05:48.254 - 00:06:59.834, Speaker A: Now I share another file because time is running out. I explained on the file, share this one and we go. This is the PDF file that I shared with you. And what we covered in the first part today was this one we started with. It's better to. I will not be able to write on this PDF file, but I can explain on the screen. Let me see.
00:06:59.834 - 00:07:56.770, Speaker A: Maybe I can stop sharing. I can open it with another surface so that I can write on it open with Microsoft Edge. Okay, now I can write that. That's good. So what we did today, construction was yesterday. Still convergence. Convergence.
00:07:56.770 - 00:08:47.309, Speaker A: And yeah, Poisson representation. This is what we did today. We started with h of D bar and then h infinity. The main ingredient l infinity is the dual of l one and l one is separable. You saw this rather long proof, and now pretty much we copy paste the same thing for hp. And this time we use the fact that Lp is the dual of LQ and Lp is separable, precisely the same. And there is a reason I didn't write a piece bigger than or equal to one less than infinity.
00:08:47.309 - 00:09:38.984, Speaker A: I separated the case one from this one, which is strictly bigger than one. And that is lies on the very, very deep result of ris brothers. So, but this proof is precisely the same proof as we saw before, except that we work with lp and Lq. Nothing more special about this. So, given a function in Hp, then there is again something exists. And this gives us, by Risc theorem, by duality, a u in lp, such that we have the Poisson representation and the norms coincide. The same strategy as before.
00:09:38.984 - 00:10:33.776, Speaker A: And why the same technique does not work in Lidl H one. The reason is that l one is not dual of something. It's not something trivial, it's a trm. And even there is a research paper on this. But at the end of the day, l one is not a dual space. That is why this technique is not working. If we copy paste for l one, what is the remedy? The remedy I explained on the first day, instead of considering l one by itself, we put it in m in the space of measures.
00:10:33.776 - 00:11:11.304, Speaker A: And the good thing about m is that m is the dual of c. So this is a dual space, but l one is not. And now everything works. The only shortcoming is that in the previous case, when we are in hp, the function we obtain is in lp. The theorem before u was in h one. Little one, sorry, u was in h infinity. Little u was in l infinity.
00:11:11.304 - 00:11:55.948, Speaker A: Here, if we do the same and apply the contour diagonalization, the limiting object that we obtain is not necessarily a function in l one. It can be a measure. In other words, we can have a sequence here, but it converges in our topology to something which is a measure. The picture doesn't say it the way I draw the picture. It suggests that l one is closed in m with respect to that topology. But that is not the case. We can have a sequence in l one, but the limit be a measure outside the set of.
00:11:55.948 - 00:12:51.214, Speaker A: And the consequence of this is here we have a u which is in h one. When we do the limiting process, what we obtain at the end of the day is a measure. So u is given by the Poisson integral of a measure. And well, we have the norm identity too. It is interesting to know that we cannot do better than this. And the best example is indeed the Poisson integral itself. If you consider u to be one minus r two, one plus r two minus two, r cos theta, it satisfies this property.
00:12:51.214 - 00:13:44.152, Speaker A: And when you take the limit when it goes to the boundary, what happens when r goes to one? Something very interesting happens here is the .1 at all these points, except one. When you go to the boundary lidl, u is equal to zero, and at the, .1 little u is equal to plus infinity. So at just one point, the limit is plus infinity. At all other points is equal to zero. So if we apply the Lubeck integration theory and try to recover capital u from a small u, it doesn't work.
00:13:44.152 - 00:14:33.698, Speaker A: Any integral with a small u would be zero. So the previous representation with little u doesn't work. And we see here precisely the measure mu, which represents this capital, is the trac measure anchored at 0.1. So the result is optimal. We cannot do better than that. Another thing which comes from this theorem is that if we consider positive harmonic function, when we do the subsequence and the limiting process, everything is positive. So the measure we obtain at the end of the day is also positive too.
00:14:33.698 - 00:15:21.894, Speaker A: And this is a special case of the previous result. But by itself it is important. It is called Herculaat's representation theorem. We have a positive harmonic function which automatically satisfies the restriction we are looking for. So positive already means that this is in h one, there is a measure, but more than that, the measure is positive and u is represented by a Poisson integral of a positive measure. A little bit of work with the Poisson integral, we obtain a very important theorem in potential theory and harmonic analysis. It's called Harnax inequality.
00:15:21.894 - 00:17:05.986, Speaker A: If u is positive harmonic function on d, u at every point is controlled by u at the .0 with some coefficients, which depends on the location of the location of ur e to the I theta. And this is very easy to prove, because the Poisson kernel is positive and upper bounded by one plus r, one minus r, and lower bounded by this, and we immediately obtain the result. What is important in Harnack's inequality is that if you have any other connected domain, for example, something like did, I mean you, it cannot be, it's not necessarily the unit circle, and you have a positive, I cannot change the color, and you have a positive harmonic function on, on this. Then pick a point here, put it z and another point, I mean, in other part of the domain, for example, w. Here, what Harnack inequality says is that u at point z over u at point w is upper bounded and lower bounded by a constant c. And the important thing is that c does not depend on u.
00:17:05.986 - 00:18:01.492, Speaker A: Of course, c depends on z and w, and also the shape of our domain omega. This is okay, but it doesn't depend on you. Uniformly, the word I emphasize and uniform uniformly. For any positive harmonic function u of z is controlled by u of w and versa. That's the essence of her necks inequality, which has many, many interesting applications. And the proof is precisely based on this corollary, because you can connect your z to w by a piecewise linear curve like this, which is away from the frontier. And then this is a standard in complex analysis.
00:18:01.492 - 00:19:01.960, Speaker A: And then cover this by a finite number of disks, and on each disk you apply this inequality. And then you go from beginning to the end. You obtain what you want with some c, which I mean, would depend on z, but not the representation. To finish this section, the representation we mentioned here were for harmonic functions, either real or complex. So they work for capital h two, because capital h, I mean, being holomorph, is also harmonic. So all the representation before also works for Hardy spaces, the analytic one. We can say a little bit more.
00:19:01.960 - 00:19:34.808, Speaker A: Yes. For example here, if f is in Hp, there is a function in Lp such that this representation work. We saw it before that's good. Or we have this representation. But now consider the fact that f has to be analytic, and being analytic. When we calculate the Fourier coefficient, half of the spectrum is zero. This is the meaning of being analytic.
00:19:34.808 - 00:20:53.024, Speaker A: So we have the same representation, but n, instead of starting from minus infinity to infinity, starts from zero to infinity. So the function which is here, it is true that it lives in Lp, but it's a special subclass of Lp, the subclass whose negative spectrum is zero. And that is why in pretty much all books about hardy spaces, they call this subspace hp of t. Hp means a subclass of Lp, but half of the spectrum is equal to zero. So all the theorems we mentioned can be summarized here. And still, you see, I didn't write p equal to one, even though it's true, but without any effort, all the previous theorem putting together implies this one, and also for the same one, for h infinity. So even for p equal to infinity, no extra effort is needed.
00:20:53.024 - 00:21:51.780, Speaker A: What is very fundamental, and I didn't go through the detail in the proof here in the PDF file, but it's available in the book, is that if you modify the representation we have for little h one, you obtain representation for capital h one as this. This is correct. There is no mistake in it. But that's not the whole truth. The whole truth is obtained by theorem of risk brothers. If you have a measure such that half of the spectrum is zero, here is the negative part. Because we are working with analytic functions, then the measure has to be absolutely continuous.
00:21:51.780 - 00:23:03.964, Speaker A: It's really, really beautiful theorem. And that is why, instead of mu, we can write here f star dt, the sum starts from zero. We notice that the the real difference is here compared to this one. So from here to there is the theorem of Rees brothers. And that is why in this theorem, which is a summarize of all of the previous result for little h one, but written for hardy spaces, even we can put less than or equal here and less than or equal here, as long as this representation is concerned. So the analytic part brings us a very solid representation theorem for all cases. Of course, we do not expect to have such a representation for p less than one, because even the lobe integral is not well defined.
00:23:03.964 - 00:24:01.388, Speaker A: So that finishes our studies of representation theorems. As long as Poisson integral is concerned. There are some other representations which are mentioned, and there is a section here which I have provided a list of all of them for further reference. In the 30 minutes remaining, I go to something which I promised on Monday. Equivalent definition of hardy spaces on d for the spatial case p equal to two. But when we want to generalize, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. So here it is h two, yeah.
00:24:01.388 - 00:24:34.790, Speaker A: Four different ways to define h two. Harder space, h infinity. The definition is easy. You say that the norm infinity is the supremum and here is the hardest. So it's the simplest way of defining a norm. But many difficulties are ahead. And indeed, h infinity proved to be a challenging space.
00:24:34.790 - 00:25:25.234, Speaker A: And there were some problems like corona problem, which were opened for, for many, many years and finally was settled by Carlson. And still in the several valuable cases, an open question. I mean, we have session, if I'm not mistaken, week 13 or week 14 on corona problem. So it's a corona problem on h infinity of D. And there are many, many progress on this topic. So I mentioned this just to say that even though the definition of norm is easy, but many challenging problems are about bounded analytic functions. Even in the open unit disk, in the several variable, it's still open.
00:25:25.234 - 00:26:10.422, Speaker A: The next step is to go into h two. Why h two is interesting because at the same time it's also in Hilbert's space. And we can use the techniques of Hilbert spaces to get use result about h two. Here I mentioned four definitions and we see what are the consequences of each one of these. The first one is by Taylor or Fourier coefficients. You consider analytic functions for which Taylor coefficients are square sumable. Naively speaking, we say here, we say that h two is equal to little l two.
00:26:10.422 - 00:27:01.860, Speaker A: That's what we say. So that's a norm. It's very easy because it's a normal l two. And one thing which is essential here is that even though this is one way to define the norm on h two. But if you want to generalize, that is not a good formula. If you put here, I mean, space is such that the sum a np one over p is finite. And say that I want to consider these spaces.
00:27:01.860 - 00:27:42.360, Speaker A: This is not hp. It's a space which is called lp of a. So generalization is possible, but it does, it does not give us the hardest space, it gives us something else. If p is not equal to two. That is why we forget about Taylor definition by Taylor coefficients. We use another way and the second way. These are some explanation about what's going on and even LPA mentioned here.
00:27:42.360 - 00:28:45.474, Speaker A: There is a book on this subject, very recent one. So that is why we forget about the previous definition. We go to another one by integral means open unit. This we consider circular radius r between one and zero. And then we calculate the average of f on this circuit and by parcel identity, this integral is exactly equal to this one, because the Fourier coefficient of Fran times r to the n. And so here you obtain this formula. And if we take the supremum on even the limit with respect to r as r goes to one, we obtain the same combination that we had before.
00:28:45.474 - 00:30:03.502, Speaker A: So this suggests that another way to define the hardest space, h two. By this formula, we calculate the averages on the circles, and then we take supreme r between zero and one. And in this case, if you replace two by p, we obtain Hardy classes hp. So that is a good way to define Hardy spaces. Okay, got more definitions? Another definition, which is very useful in the application, in particular when we consider composition operators, is by the harmonic measurement, an observation, if there is a harmonic function u such that absolute value of f squared is controlled by u, is less than or equal to u. And then, now we fix radius r and we integrate. This is the integral that we want to show.
00:30:03.502 - 00:30:36.614, Speaker A: It's bounded. And the good thing about harmonic function is that the average on the circular radius r is equal to the value on the center. Very good. Doesn't depend on r, and therefore it's in hardy spaces. Conclusion is that f is in the hardest spaces, and even we have an upper bound based on that harmonic function. So the norm is bounded by the root of u at. .0
00:30:36.614 - 00:31:10.424, Speaker A: now we go the other way around. If f is in h two is given, then we have the Poisson integral. We saw this before. We have this. And now you apply either the holder inequality or the Jensen inequality with phi of t is equal to t two, which is a convex function. You obtain this inequality. That's a consequence of either Cauchy, Schwarz or Jenson inequality.
00:31:10.424 - 00:31:57.514, Speaker A: And this part gives you a function u. So we obtain, this is the u I mentioned, and u at the .0 is precisely the norm of f star on the boundary squared. And we know that that is equal to the norm of f in h two. In other words, if you put the first and the second part together, the normal f is given by this formula. We consider all the harmonic measurements, evaluate them at zero, and then take the infemum. The infemum is precisely equal to the norm of f squared.
00:31:57.514 - 00:32:47.156, Speaker A: So that's another way. As I said, it is a good way to look at h two two and use the harmonic measurements. For example, for composition operators, it works also for p. That's a good way. So here, if we replace two by p, it works. That's so as long as definition two and definition three, which is this one, as long as generalization are concerned, both of them are good. We can replace two by p and obtain something.
00:32:47.156 - 00:33:18.874, Speaker A: There is something in the chat. No, the majorant. Someone asked, is this majorant is unique? Of course not. For example, if u is a major and u plus one is also a major, so the majorant is not unique. And. But you can ask, is the best majorant, the least one is unique. Now, the answer is yes, the least harmonic majorant is unique.
00:33:18.874 - 00:34:03.378, Speaker A: There is a little bit of work to show that. And so as long as we want to go from two to p, that's okay. One comment about definition two and definition three. When we go to the upper half plane. Well, here, choices of circles of radius r is very natural to do. I mean, to do it and obtain our other definition. What about the upper half plane or right half plane that the engineers like? The right half plane.
00:34:03.378 - 00:34:35.518, Speaker A: Another question. Yes. I mean, I answered the. When we go to the upper half plane. Well, if we consider circles, it's not clear where the center should be. And also, if the center is big, we go outside the boundary. So circles are not natural for the upper half plane.
00:34:35.518 - 00:35:15.374, Speaker A: For the upper half plane, since r is the boundary, it is natural to consider lines like this and take the means on these lines. And if the mean are uniformly bounded, we define hp of c to be those functions. This is good. That's the way we define hardy spaces in the upper half plane, either hp or h two. Keep this in mind. Come to the definition three. So, that's another way.
00:35:15.374 - 00:35:58.634, Speaker A: So we say, okay, let's go to the upper half plane. And here, well, we consider all functions such that normal f is less than or equal u, and then we define the norm by the same remedy we have here. That's good. It gives us a harder space, hp of c plus. It is interesting to know that this hardy space is not the same as this one. And that is why in some books, they write it this way, to show that this is not the same hardy space. So we obtain a hard disk space, but not the same as before.
00:35:58.634 - 00:36:37.884, Speaker A: Be careful. Going from disk to upper half plane, it works. It is, I mean, gives the answer in many cases, but there are at least. At least two classes of hearty spaces in the upper half plane and which are not the same. What makes us more confusing is that the Poisson integral works here. The Poisson integral also works here, but they show different things. So be careful which hardy spaces you use in the upper half plane and which definitions you use.
00:36:37.884 - 00:37:31.454, Speaker A: Finally, the last one, which finishes our courses. It's an interesting formula indeed. This is the formula that yesterday Jose asked about it by a private message. And it's generalization to the case p. If for the case p equal to two is the simplest one. Just consider this integral in which da of z is simply dx. Dy is the area integral, f is given, you have f prime, you have log, and simply plug in the formula and use parcel from here to here is the parcel identity.
00:37:31.454 - 00:38:13.906, Speaker A: And then everything is positive. You can change the order of summation and integral, because everything is positive. And if you do this, you obtain the sum from n equal to one, not zero, from n equal to one up to infinity a n. And this is precisely f minus zero. It's norm in h two two. And that is why we have this very beautiful formula for the, for the norm. But note that in definition two, we had just line integral.
00:38:13.906 - 00:38:42.706, Speaker A: And here we have a double integral. Even though I wrote integral over d, it's indeed integral. It's a double integral. Sometimes people write it this way. If you put two integrals, it's more honest. That is an area integral. So that's one way to give the formula in h two by an area integral.
00:38:42.706 - 00:39:23.034, Speaker A: And this can be generalized. The formula is a bit more complicated. To. To obtain a formula for f minus f zero in hp squared, there is a formula. And I mean even, I mean, let me write the formula. Oops. Is p two, p two integral over d f z.
00:39:23.034 - 00:40:23.874, Speaker A: Don't know what, something is wrong. Exponent p minus two, f prime z exponent two unlock a one minus z. Daz, I remember this because Joe asked me yesterday, and I went and look at the literature and find the formula. So here it is here, because of the presence of f of z, the exponent pull p minus two, which might be a negative exponent. For example, consider a p one. And that's the case which is needed. Indeed, in the proof of corona theorem, we obtain f prime squared divided by f.
00:40:23.874 - 00:41:07.842, Speaker A: And if f has zeros v, there are some difficulties. That's why in this formula, there are some more restrictions. Here, there is no more restriction, I mean, just f in h two. Here f is in hp, but tumor restriction f has a simple zero at the origin at most, in which case this becomes zero and f has no other zero. There is a comment. Let me see. David Bletcher.
00:41:07.842 - 00:41:31.312, Speaker A: Oh, hello David. I didn't know you are here. Jeva, can you post the link to the game please? Sure. Okay, sure, David. So we need to assume that f has no other zero, because there is a problem here. It will not work. But having a simple zero at the origin is okay.
00:41:31.312 - 00:42:20.212, Speaker A: We can. We can compare with that. And the last thing. Sometimes working with log of one over z is a bit difficult. But as z goes to the boundary log of one over mod z is pretty much the same as one minus absolute value of z. And so we ask, what happens if you replace log of one over mod z by one minus absolute value of z, or absolute value of z square square is not really important, because we can write one plus one minus and one plus doesn't do anything. It's a good substitution.
00:42:20.212 - 00:42:54.170, Speaker A: Here it does doesn't give us precisely the formula we wanted, but it gives almost the same thing, the same technique mean. We write f prime. That's the definition. From here to there, it's parcel identity. And then, everything positive, we change the order of summation and integral. You see, it doesn't completely simplifies. We have a factor of n over n plus one here, if we use one minus mod z two.
00:42:54.170 - 00:43:37.704, Speaker A: The good thing about logarithm was that when we evaluate this integral, everything simplifies. And what remains is just mod a n squared with one minus z two, even though it's nicer. But the penalty is paid. At the end, we have n over n plus one. Not that bad, because when n goes to infinity, n over n plus one goes to one. And that is why we can obtain an upper. Lower bound to upper bound is one, lower bound is a half.
00:43:37.704 - 00:44:21.814, Speaker A: So this quantity, which is the same as this one, is controlled from above and from below both sides by normal f minus f zero. It's. It's not a complete identity. But still, this formula is very useful. Well, I explained, when I talk about h two, how it goes even. We go to hp, briefly speaking, for case definitions two, three and four, it works. If we replace two by p in the first definition, it gives us something else.
00:44:21.814 - 00:44:57.534, Speaker A: And even if we go to upper half plane and we replace two by p, we obtain different spaces. And we need to be careful. Well, that's it. It finishes 6 hours of lectures about just representation theorems. Ryan asks, are the definition of complex artists? Yes, yes, yes. You said it. Based on definition, based on this.
00:44:57.534 - 00:45:50.150, Speaker A: It's not that honest to say a definition. These are deep theorems, which says that, yes, something is in the Hardy space. If we consider the maximal function on the boundary, which I didn't give even the definition, and this function is in l one. It's a deep theorem. But that theorem can be used and has been used by experts to define hardy spaces of in RN. So in a sense, the answer to your question is yes and no. Yes, because we have a kind of if and only if and when.
00:45:50.150 - 00:47:12.604, Speaker A: We have if and only if we can adopt as a definition. No, because in no books about the classical setting, this is given as the definition force for d is a theorem for both cases. David asked me to share the PDF file again. Now I have to find the chat. Okay, I go main chapter hard dispasses. Here is the PDF file, but I mean it will be modified further and I mean reorganized and the final version will be available too. Shapnam asks how these multiple definitions are these pieces came to existence.
00:47:12.604 - 00:48:36.514, Speaker A: Well, how they came into existence, I do not know really how to answer this question, but at least it's in line with what Ryan asked. And my answer to Ryan when we want to generalize, when we want to go either from two to p or from disk to upper half plane, or even to rn and Cn, which definition do we use? And this is precisely the point we have. If we add the two also that mentioned by Orion, we have six or seven equivalent definition for the hardest spaces on the open unit disk. And when we generalize, each one of them gives us spaces which do not necessarily coincide. That is why we have multiple definitions in the open unit disk. But I need to think more about this question, how they came into existence. I need to think more about it.
