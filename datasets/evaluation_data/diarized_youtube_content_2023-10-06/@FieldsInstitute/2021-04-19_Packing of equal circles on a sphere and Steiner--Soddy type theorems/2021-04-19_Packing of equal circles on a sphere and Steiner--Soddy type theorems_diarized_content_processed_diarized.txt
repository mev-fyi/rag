00:00:00.360 - 00:00:40.994, Speaker A: Let me start from the very classical, very classical object that already I don't appear maybe, I don't know, 100 and 5170 years ago. It is called Steiner. Steinerism. I will discuss what does it mean? Actually, roughly speaking, polism means just proposition, but archaic word for propaganda. But I know only, only two serums that using this Steiner and pencileb also pencil. But in both case. In both case, we.
00:00:40.994 - 00:01:23.950, Speaker A: It is actually. It is a statement about that there are infinitely many different positions. What is a sinopathy? Suppose we have. Suppose we have a. Suppose we have two circles like here that you have on the left and you consider any circle and continue to subscribe circles that touch, say, left one and both given circles. Yeah. Suppose it happened that we start from this circle.
00:01:23.950 - 00:01:56.786, Speaker A: Say, suppose it happened that the last one also touch tangent to the first circle. The Steiner's chain is. It is called Steiner chain says that we can start from any sock. It doesn't matter for each circle and we start and we have the same effect. Look at that. It is sent me by hungarian mathematician Gabor Damasdi. Look at this.
00:01:56.786 - 00:02:09.110, Speaker A: Nice picture. I like this one. Look at this. Yeah, we have. It's a very good idea. I mean like you can subscribe more and more and more. Yeah.
00:02:09.110 - 00:03:17.654, Speaker A: Okay, so it is a theorem. Oh, by the way, there's a few words about the purism that says that the definition from Wikipedia said that Steiner. Steiner says that purism is exactly like nothing more than only just some proposition. Okay, another interesting appearance, similar. This type theorem appeared in 1937. And Frederick Sodi considered three mutually tangent spheres. And he proved that in this case there exists six spheres which is tangent to neighbors, its neighbors and also three mutually tangent given spheres.
00:03:17.654 - 00:03:54.478, Speaker A: Here we have a picture, the red one. Actually it is a sphere that substitute two spheres because we have one sphere outer and there are two inside and we see this three six tangent spheres. Yeah, that looks like more complicated. But both results are very, very simple. Very simple. I will just explain. I will explain how to prove that a few words about Sodi.
00:03:54.478 - 00:04:31.374, Speaker A: Frederick Sodi is interesting personality because he is actually, he is a Nobel Prize. To win his Nobel Prize laureate, he got Nobel Prize in chemistry. And he published several, several geometric, several geometric papers. And moreover, one of the. When he. I will discuss it later, his extension of this card theorem. And he wrote even a poem called the Kiss precise.
00:04:31.374 - 00:04:54.342, Speaker A: Yeah, I even look at this. Oh, by the way, he published this paper about hex created nature. We can see that it is precautionary nature. The ball of integers and hex length. Okay, just a second. Let me show to the paper. This is my paper where.
00:04:54.342 - 00:05:40.858, Speaker A: But let me, let me explain how to prove it. Actually it is a simple exercise for high school students. Exercise how to prove both results. I mean like about science, Buddhism as well as well as like. Sorry, sketch. We know that from geometry fact it is not complicated that if you have the inversion, if you have two circles, non overlapping, non intersection circles, then they exist. Inversion such that the inversion sends these two circles into concentric circles.
00:05:40.858 - 00:06:29.374, Speaker A: So we have a concentric circles, right? And we have inversion. So if you have what does standard chain, that means we have two radii sides that we can subscribe and circles inside. And since position doesn't matter, you can rotate, right. That means if you return back, you will obtain. This is the proof of theory. The main lemma is in this case is the following. That we have any non overlapping circles can be existing reversions are the same to the two concentric circles.
00:06:29.374 - 00:07:15.268, Speaker A: What is how to prove the sodium hex layer? It is another. It's again inertia. If we have two spheres in any dimensions, say s one, s two that are tangent, then we can use this tangent point as center of the inversion. In this case, it sends these two spheres into the two parallel plane. So we have a plane and if you have a short one, say this one, the central, right, we have a.
00:07:15.316 - 00:07:16.104, Speaker B: Center.
00:07:19.484 - 00:08:05.626, Speaker A: We have this sphere, the third sphere, right? And other spheres, they touch, they touch this plane as well, these two planes as well, like the center sphere. That means, you know, they touch the equator of this sphere. This is what we have. We have actually we have a kissing arrangement because we have exactly of the same. We have a center sphere, equator of the sphere, right? And equator of other spheres touch this sphere. In our case, it will be circle. Because in this three dimensions we have two parameters, equator, circle.
00:08:05.626 - 00:09:00.896, Speaker A: And we have exactly six circle of the same radius that touch our central circle. So the proof also even, almost direct. So what I'm going to do right now, I'm going to consider just a second. Yeah, I'm going to extend this too simple fact and this proof to consider generalization. Generalization. Both, both results, we can reconsider exactly two cases. Namely, we have a family of series.
00:09:00.896 - 00:09:41.534, Speaker A: And suppose that first one, the first two, one are, they are tangent or s one and s two do not have any common points. That is, then we have inversion such that in the first case it will be. We consider the center of attention point. And the second case we consider when we do not have a common point. Then we have the center, the inversion. It is inversion such that they to be s one and s two to be two concentric. Concentric spheres.
00:09:41.534 - 00:10:25.178, Speaker A: Yeah. So we know that this exists. And we obtain the following question. If we have this to spheres, then we have a touching. Then we have our other touch spheres becomes of the same radius. So it will reduce like above, we reduce our problem to the problem about. We have a sphere and other spheres that touch the center sphere.
00:10:25.178 - 00:10:33.874, Speaker A: We have three of them. Yeah. If you have two or the team say we have two spheres in r.
00:10:33.914 - 00:10:34.494, Speaker C: Three.
00:10:38.354 - 00:11:08.340, Speaker A: Non intersecting spheres. In this case we have two concentric spheres. So we have. In other words, we have a sphere of the same radii, the same radius that touch the center of the center of center sphere. Because all of them have the same radius. So we have a situation that we can reduce our problem to the spherical codes. Theoretical codes.
00:11:08.340 - 00:11:51.020, Speaker A: It is another word. You can use several definitions, but atmospherical codes. The simple one, it is I mean too close to this workshop. We have a sphere and we consider unit sphere, right? And we consider spheres of the same radii that touches this center sphere that touches the center sphere. The main thing is that they have the same radii. So it is the touching sphere that actually gives spherical cycle. In other words, there is three divisions.
00:11:51.020 - 00:12:24.320, Speaker A: In other words, it is. That means, you know, we have a pecking bio spherical caps. And the third definition, what we actually. This is a simple one. Let us consider a spherical spherical code, spherical cycle. That means, you know, all points. We consider a set of points on the sphere such that on the distance at least, at least, at least psi.
00:12:24.320 - 00:12:47.630, Speaker A: The geographic distance or angle of distance is at least psi. So we have how it is related to taking by spherical caps. Adjust to it is. It will be diameter, right. If you put. If you consider this half of pSi, it will be radio spherical gaps. It will be taken the same thing.
00:12:47.630 - 00:13:09.032, Speaker A: It is same definition, but it is obviously the same. Some of them is known, well known. Namely when we have a size five or 360 degrees radius is. Sorry. Yeah, it is a distance is 60 degrees. It is a kissing numbers. In other words, we have a center sphere.
00:13:09.032 - 00:13:49.122, Speaker A: It's to consider the maximal size of this coated maximum arrangement is called the kissing arrangement. And the maximum number is nonverbal weapon unit spheres in there. It is attached central unit sphere. It's called the kissing number. Okay, now we can consider. Now we can consider name theorem about that. Okay, I called it f ksynch arrangement of f k.
00:13:49.122 - 00:14:40.568, Speaker A: Synchronize suppose we have, suppose we have any family of spheres m spheres. I told you that first and first two are on non intersecting called tangent spheres. Then the theorem said that another and we are looking for spheres that touch all of us, all spheres in this family. And theorem. The main theorem says the following. Let me just put it to it. For a given, for a given family f.
00:14:40.568 - 00:15:30.150, Speaker A: The inversion t that defines, defines a one to one correspondence between f kissing arrangements and spherical psi sub f code. Psi sub f code. Because I already discussed when you sent this, when the, when the Catherine inversion, they send this our family of kissing tears to their into some spherical culture. Of course there is some distance. We will consider later examples. So there's a main theory, main object, our main object that can give us extensions of both, uh, both serums. I mean like Steiner and uh, Steiner.
00:15:30.302 - 00:15:31.182, Speaker B: I have a question.
00:15:31.318 - 00:15:32.034, Speaker A: Yep.
00:15:32.374 - 00:15:51.674, Speaker B: So. So this kind of f kissing arrangement could be really loose, right? Like the two, the two main spheres could be like very, very like very close to the same size, right? And then you'd have a bunch of little, the rest of them could be like very little spheres sort of scattered in between, right?
00:15:53.624 - 00:15:56.016, Speaker A: Can you, can you, can you repeat?
00:15:56.200 - 00:16:13.776, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this kind of arrangement could be very loose. Like imagine your two spheres which touch everything else are almost the same size and concentric. Then you could have a bunch of little spheres kind of rolling around in between the shells. Is that right?
00:16:13.840 - 00:16:45.712, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah it is. Yeah. Let me, let me give you example, right enough that maybe it will be more clear because I give examples that exactly our goal. Of course there is different situation. It's sometimes it is not clear because of course it not always exists. Even for in two dimensional case, when we have two circles, right. It is actually there is some constraints for fraction, I mean this fraction of to radiate.
00:16:45.712 - 00:17:23.893, Speaker A: Because as you get to this, it has to satisfy certain, certain constraints, right? Certain question. Yeah. So that of course it is not like if you little bit change radiois. It is not clear, it will not exist. But okay, let me first try to extend. Try to find an Alexa analysis of standard polarism to all dimensions. Let me just to.
00:17:23.893 - 00:18:28.668, Speaker A: The theorem is the following. Suppose we have a family of M spheres such that. Such that first two spheres are non intersection spheres. They have no recommend components. If a standard packing is formed from the, from one starting sphere, then a standard packing is formed from any other starting packing. Then that is also built by Steiner packing format from any other starting point. I mean, okay, in this case, you can imagine like two spheres like in 3d, for instance, in three dimensions in the space, right? And suppose we have one of them, right? And like something like we touch all neighbors, right? And in this case we can, we can actually.
00:18:28.668 - 00:19:04.264, Speaker A: We can start from any other point. Actually there is some, there is actually this family Stanley packing. Actually you can use, so three on the group of action over group. So three action can be rotated in different, different cases, of course, on the change radius. But this also interesting problem. I tried to describe all cases. When you have.
00:19:04.264 - 00:19:32.242, Speaker A: When the. When we have. When we have sort of Steiner extension. Look, what, what we do, what we do. What we can do in this, in this case, for instance, in two dimensions, we take any one, any circle and we, and we touch another circle. Or we have two neighbors, right? We can select two neighbors. And in one moment, this chain, this chain will be quote, right.
00:19:32.242 - 00:20:15.646, Speaker A: What you can do in three dimensions, in three dimension, actually the greedy, we have a choice because if we start from one sphere attached to both, right? It is not there. You can start from any two. You can start from any two spheres, right? And after that you can add third one and from both sides. And sometimes it will be. It can be caused a standard pattern. But look what happened. If you have two and the third one attaching.
00:20:15.646 - 00:20:52.892, Speaker A: Then the center of this, we have a triangle. Actually they form. If you think about that, the stain form simplicial. In general case. In this case and the triangulation, I mean this, it is a triangulation. The center of these spheres form a triangulation. So we have a very special, very special configuration.
00:20:52.892 - 00:21:39.698, Speaker A: I mean like that. When we can use any greedy, greedy algorithm, how to build this Steiner packing. And that is everything known in this, in this case, if you consider image on the image at the. So we are looking for spherical codes such that, such that the contact graph form triangulation. There are only five cases. Here we have a list of all five cases. Number one, of course, is the Steiner case.
00:21:39.698 - 00:22:19.324, Speaker A: It's only for dimension d. It works for any regular polygon because it is a polygon. Another family is also considered before, I mean like classical episodic. Consider that for instance, it is a regular D simplex for Nad. Yeah. And I mean, this centers form a tetrahedron in three dimensions. And the third case, it is a regular cross polytope.
00:22:19.324 - 00:22:57.194, Speaker A: This family exists for all of them. And two special cases, namely icosahedron, because it is triangulated, right? And 600 cell. It is also regular polytope and 600 cell because it also will be. This also form a regular, regular, simplex I mean, consists of regular simplexes. Yeah. So I just. We have only five cases.
00:22:57.194 - 00:23:23.934, Speaker A: And interesting question related to this. Five cases. It is their extension. It's not a very, very classical question. It's called a very old classical. It is called Descartes theorem. Descartes considered, you know, for.
00:23:23.934 - 00:24:00.406, Speaker A: It's even known here. When he obtained the theorem, he considered three circles. And question is what the relation to have three circles mutually touching circles. The question is how to find for the fourth one. There are two cases, internal and external, that touch all of these three cases. How to find the radii. He considered what he considered.
00:24:00.406 - 00:24:19.184, Speaker A: Now considered only k. That means the curvature. That means, you know, one divided by radius. And this nice formula. There is several. Several different form of this formula. But this show how to find.
00:24:19.184 - 00:24:49.364, Speaker A: How to find radius of the fourth. Of the fourth circle. Right. And the sign depends on the touch external, externally or internally. Yeah. Actually, this theorem was extended by Gocet, maybe 19th century and. Sorry.
00:24:49.364 - 00:25:38.512, Speaker A: He wrote about this poem about exactly about this case. And so it is actually known for. We have five cases, right? And for first case, when we have four cases solved found by desk card and many, many years ago. Right? And almost 400 years ago. And therefore, for the case two for simplex, it was solved by Sodi and gossip. It may be someone else. There are some other.
00:25:38.512 - 00:26:04.292, Speaker A: Actually, I don't remember some details about this solution, but. And it remained only three cases from our list. Three cases. Cross polytope for on icosahedron. And this is question is how to find. Definitely there exists some formulas for that. And I believe it's some polynomial formula.
00:26:04.292 - 00:26:33.314, Speaker A: And to find. To find this extension of the discard method. Okay, now let me tell a few words about how to. What does it mean? So the hex label. In this case, we have. Let us consider the. Let us consider the same case, what considered by Sodi.
00:26:33.314 - 00:27:01.494, Speaker A: He considered in the dimension m three spheres. And looking for position. Of course, you can consider it any mix, right. Let m will be between in n dimensions, when m be between three and n plus two spheres. And to do that, all of them. Let us consider. Let us consider the case, his case.
00:27:01.494 - 00:27:25.054, Speaker A: Namely, that it will be exactly. Exactly. All of them will be. Not any can be. They can be. Because actually it's not assumed. The theory not assumes that say, third one mutually touch first two.
00:27:25.054 - 00:27:49.290, Speaker A: Right? But let us consider his case. In this case, we can compute psi as I do. It is cosine of one over m minus one. Yeah. And the theorem said that in this case, we obtain the exist. The existence will be spherical code. With this side this theorem set.
00:27:49.290 - 00:28:09.084, Speaker A: It is just again like nothing, nothing. Because I just compute what I did. I just compute this site. There is interesting cases. The first interesting case. Suppose we have Microsoft equals three. The case three spheres.
00:28:09.084 - 00:28:43.740, Speaker A: In this case, as we saw, we have a two parallel planes right at the sphere inside. And all other spheres that have to have to the same radius. Suppose this distance between these two parallel planes is two, right? Then we have a unit spheres. And all other unit spheres also have to be unit spheres that touches. We have a key synchrony. So we have a teacher kissing Karen. And we can ask many questions, several.
00:28:43.740 - 00:29:26.484, Speaker A: We can ask some, some question about this. How many? For instance, like for the soda case, what's the maximum number? What is the maximum number of candy of this. Of this sphere? Right. This f kissing family contains the answer is known. It also known for only for a few cases. Namely for. We know for n equals three to six, right? It's obvious because we have a circle and six circles around that the king number is known in dimension.
00:29:26.484 - 00:29:55.382, Speaker A: For n equals four. It is kissing number in dimension three and cases number known in dimension five and eight. I mean, in dimension four, that means no, n equals five. And also cases eight, eight and 24. It is all complete list of kiss characters. By dimension four. Actually, it is still not proven that it's.
00:29:55.382 - 00:30:32.818, Speaker A: It is unique. It's a big open problem that the kissing arrangement is unique. So we can say something about extension of the hex led in dimension four or in dimension five, when we have a three mutually tangent spheres. But however, this arrangement is not. It is very interesting to prove that it's unique. So we have the same situation as before, but it is still not known. But in dimensions, dimensions eight and 24, kiss encouragement, unique.
00:30:32.818 - 00:31:00.274, Speaker A: I mean, the maximum encouragement. We can say that it's also unique. It's e eight and leach lattice gives us this uniqueness. And so we can have interesting extension of sodi x length. Okay, let me, let me finish this part. I will be exactly 30 minutes, right? Almost exactly 30 minutes. I'm going to consider the second part, namely.
00:31:00.274 - 00:31:33.044, Speaker A: Okay, just let us fix, let us fix. When we have. When we have our question about this f kissing family that extend Steiner chain and 30 hex layer, right. We reduced to the spherical code. And now let us. We can ask many problems. One problem.
00:31:33.044 - 00:32:06.044, Speaker A: One problem is. A simple problem is. Okay, what can be the maximum number? What kind? What kind? Contact graph. What we can say about contact graph. What you can say is actually we can find all answers when we consider spherical code. Let me look on the change to the second part. And now we consider packing of equal circles.
00:32:06.044 - 00:32:48.432, Speaker A: And here we have several papers, our papers with Alexey Tarasov. And also we consider periodic packing, when we found some strange situations that exist. Maximum that maximum for seven circle periodic right. We have the maximum packing is not unique. I just still surprised how it can happen, because in spherical case for some it is. We cannot such a case. Okay, let me.
00:32:48.432 - 00:33:58.516, Speaker A: It's already defined several times in this workshop. And Carol Basdeka had a talk about that contact graph. But let me define it a little bit different from different way, actually it can be defined for any, for any metric space. Let us, let us. For any finite subset of metric space, we can define psi effect, that is the minimum distance between points in this subset as a contact graph. The contact graph is a graph with vertices in x such and such, that edges are such that this distance, distance between these points are exactly side effects, exactly the minimum distance. So this guarantee that we have at least one, one edge, but no more, right? But however, of course we are interested when we have as many edges as possible.
00:33:58.516 - 00:34:55.026, Speaker A: This is a point. Now let me just. A lot of many definitions we defined actually for simplicity, you can imagine like sphere, right? Sphere, and the point in the sphere and all distances is just. You can calculate as you want. It can be just euclidean or geodesic distance between points, angle distances between points. Okay, and first question, what we are going to do? Actually, they are looking for packing by circles of the same radius, right? Of the same radius. And so we have, we can imagine circles on the sphere, right? And the first we have to consider, we can consider all of them.
00:34:55.026 - 00:36:01.804, Speaker A: It is, it is not interesting, right? We consider such locally rigid configurations. What does it mean locally rigid configuration? In this case, that means, you know, when they consider, when they consider the point, the set of center of the circles, right? Because there are the points, then there are no shift of a single vertex. What does Munster develop? We can achieve a point such that to increase, to increase distances. So we consider it only such configuration. It is a call, it's old from german mathematician from end of 40. It's considered that, namely shoot in Wonderwarden published several papers about that. And the first book that, by the way, it's already translated into English, his beautiful book in 1953.
00:36:01.804 - 00:36:23.404, Speaker A: Yeah, it's now available. And the Gabba festoot and. Yeah, and the Kuperberg translated translation of the book. Yeah. He has a special chapter, I don't remember chapter nine. Maybe chapter eight, when he considered this irreducible contact graph. I know that.
00:36:23.404 - 00:37:06.140, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. Well, probably he does like, I remember we discussed it. He doesn't like this name irreducible. But this classic, I can do nothing for this, because it is already considered. Yeah. And so, irreducible contact graph means configuration such that we cannot shift any circle. Because that means in a sphere in three dimension, at the circle, at least, there are at least three touches of circles.
00:37:06.140 - 00:37:25.988, Speaker A: They cannot give a possibility the local region. If you, if you prefer this, this one. Yeah. Okay. There is some, some interesting properties. Properties. Properties are the following, actually.
00:37:25.988 - 00:38:04.266, Speaker A: First of all, if you can consider contact graph, at the first of all, it is a planar graph because it's on the sphere, right? Any vertex has degree, degree zero. Zero means, you know, it is. We have a circles, right? Some, we have a circle and we can put circle inside. There are also such configurations, such that, you know, it cannot be touched. It has to be in accordance with this definition. Has to be as far as possible from the other circles, other points. That is isolated vertex three, four and five.
00:38:04.266 - 00:38:22.794, Speaker A: Or five. We have only five. Six cannot be because some of angles. The regular triangle, equilateral triangle in a spherical case has more than six. Yeah. It has more than 60 degrees. So it cannot be, cannot be.
00:38:22.794 - 00:38:42.556, Speaker A: Cannot be. Cannot be. Six. Yeah. And there are some other for n greater than ten. Actually, there are cases that contains isolated curves. Maybe I have some example.
00:38:42.556 - 00:39:21.764, Speaker A: Yeah. It also some other geometric properties. But for when n is big enough, actually it is considered first, of course, students wonder wall. And when they prove the key think number problem in three dimensions, consider it. And before they consider it, Thomas problem, it is another paper in 1951. They consider this as graphs, but fewers who try to classify not only, not only the main optimal case. Yeah.
00:39:21.764 - 00:39:54.760, Speaker A: Maximum case, maximum arrangement. It was ludicrous in his. I mean, this habitation means second degree, that not exist here, but in Germany, in Germany and other european countries exist a second degree, doctoral degree. And he was translated, it was 1963. In end of. In eighties, it was translated into English. Oh, you had to watch paper like 100 page, but written.
00:39:54.760 - 00:40:25.120, Speaker A: By the way, I spent one summer to understand all details of this proof. I cannot say that it was useful, but anyway, I just feel, I just try to understand the technique. Maybe it helped me. It helped me a little bit. Okay. He considered not any irreducible. He added also one more, one more constraint.
00:40:25.120 - 00:40:53.060, Speaker A: Namely, he also gives this. He calls this d flip. I call this d flip dunce. That means, you know, suppose we have. Oops. Yeah. Suppose we have our graph, right? And we have contact graph on the sphere, right? And suppose we have some.
00:40:53.060 - 00:41:22.530, Speaker A: We take a vertex and look at this diagonal. And we can flip it x to x prime. He also allow it. If only in the case, then the distance from x prime is greater than our given distance. We have already a distance. You know what the point is? It is a graph such that all edges have the same length. That is the main point, because we have all of them in this packing band.
00:41:22.530 - 00:41:45.966, Speaker A: This is content graph, right? And so in this case, Hela, it also can be. Can be rigid from dancer point of view. It also does not allow this operation. It is that, of course, it will be much less. I will show numbers a little bit later. We will see how. What do we have here? Yeah.
00:41:45.966 - 00:42:13.160, Speaker A: It is his habilitation by dancer in 1963. And he gave a conclusification of all dereducible graphs between six and ten. And his PhD. See his family. The first is the first case, we can set six. We have the maximum. It's crew.
00:42:13.160 - 00:42:27.484, Speaker A: Yeah. We have this triangular, right. We have two triangles. This configuration, optimal triangulation. And this triangulation is a maximum maximum distance. A maximum. This minimum distance.
00:42:27.484 - 00:42:37.798, Speaker A: But this one is a family. It is a family. One. Parametric family. Yeah. This led just. Okay.
00:42:37.798 - 00:42:56.674, Speaker A: For one side of this family, we have a triangle prism. It is with a minimum minimum length. And on the other side we have a maximum. It will be this one. I mean the left one. Yeah. We have also two families.
00:42:56.674 - 00:43:20.090, Speaker A: For seven points and one family, it is parametric. And for eight points, he found three cases. Yeah. And moreover, look, eight points, we have the optimum. It is called screw coupe. Cube, right. Screw cube.
00:43:20.090 - 00:43:42.560, Speaker A: When we have four squares, like rotate, like this one. Right. In this case, but also. Okay. The maximum is for eight points is a square. This one, the minimum is the cube. The cube is the worst case, because in this case, it will be minimum distances.
00:43:42.560 - 00:44:00.268, Speaker A: But look at this. This is a two parametric family. Actually, not only one parametric, but two parameters. Just. Can you imagine that? Let me just explain what this picture. Suppose we have. Let us consider two spheres like the situation we have as stania, right.
00:44:00.268 - 00:44:34.806, Speaker A: And try to find. Try to find some arrangement of spheres, right? Such that. Such that. I mean, rigid situation. I mean, this kissing between them, right? But suppose we have a balloon that can be increased or decreased radii, right. In this case, this family. This family, actually not long lonely.
00:44:34.806 - 00:45:29.856, Speaker A: Of course, it can be rotated as a solid, right? But however, it also can be increased or decreased simultaneously. Radii. It will be interesting family, right? In this case, eight spheres between two that touch two of them. You know, we have even two parametric here. Actually, here we have a three cases dancer or dancer cases for nine points and ten, right? If I remember, ten, right. What they are, what we did, what we did, what we did with Alexey Tarasov, we actually decided to consider a general case, just irreducible graphs. It's also interesting from practical point of view, because we discussed with material scientists.
00:45:29.856 - 00:45:59.580, Speaker A: They say, oh, it is interesting case because when we have dancer, actually, it is a little bit artificial, because they have not in nature. But if you have some molecular. Right. We have one sphere and around other of the same radius. It's interesting to consider configurations. So we continue that in the first case, instead of three, we added this one. We have the three dancer found by dancer.
00:45:59.580 - 00:46:23.144, Speaker A: And we found third one. Right here we have, in radians, we have actually the family at the minimum and maximum d. Actually, we not consider it like it is. Just to consider. We found minimum, maximum. You can see, you can see here. So what is interesting here we have a pentagon.
00:46:23.144 - 00:46:46.764, Speaker A: So it is that of y. So it is not allowed by dancer. Because there is some clip fribs that give. I mean, like. So it is one more for nine. For nine, we have already ten. Three times more than dancer has.
00:46:46.764 - 00:47:03.272, Speaker A: Right here we have all of them. And for ten, we have 30. Right? We have 30. Yeah, we have 30. Dancer has dancer. Sorry. Yeah.
00:47:03.272 - 00:47:22.856, Speaker A: And dancer has, uh, uh, ten, as I remember, three times more, actually. And for eleven, dancer not considered as a case of eleven. Uh, we have, I don't remember how many. 30 something. 39. Yeah. Uh, so if we can.
00:47:22.856 - 00:47:47.816, Speaker A: It is very complicated to continue this search because it took maybe one year, I mean, like, even for eleven. And I have a little bit doubt about last one, because I checked very carefully first. I mean, up to ten. And for eleven was so many. It is. It took so many ten decades. Okay, one, one interest.
00:47:47.816 - 00:48:39.402, Speaker A: I said, okay, let's stop, because we couldn't find any other family. But for ten, it's one interesting conjecture. I discuss this also with Bob, with Conley and with many other. If you look at this conjecture, we call this to n minus two conjecture. If you look at the maximum, with the maximum age graphs, I mean, with the maximum, uh, distance graph length graph, we have always. They have two n minus this inverter, you have at least two n minus two. There are some cases like seven, probably, I remember for 13, they have exactly two.
00:48:39.402 - 00:48:59.932, Speaker A: N minus two. But we cannot prove it. The conjecture is. This falls from dimensions. Also, if you look at the dimensional equation, that it has to be like two, n minus two. But we cannot prove it. It is very interesting to prove this conjecture, because otherwise maybe, I don't know.
00:48:59.932 - 00:49:36.144, Speaker A: It is can be actually maybe to exist such configuration. I forgot how Bob calls that. So can you? Can you suppose we have a. Suppose you have this point of the same distance, right? And we can move it such that this graph. Such that simultaneously, such that we preserve the distances. He has some special flex or something special. He's here.
00:49:36.144 - 00:49:46.946, Speaker A: I cannot see him. Right. But it is a conjecture. Particular. This conjecture actually contradicts this existence. This case. Okay.
00:49:46.946 - 00:50:39.424, Speaker A: Anyway, it is a well known, well known, well known problem. It's called the Thomas problem. The Thomas problem asks actually for exactly what you consider for a given. Nice to find such a configuration such that it has a maximum minimum distance. Here we can see another rotation. How must n congruent normal grappling spherical caps be packed on the surface of a unisphere such so that the angular diameter of spherical capsule will be as great as possible, as I say. But we consider that we have like two staffs means exactly the solution of Thomas problem.
00:50:39.424 - 00:51:06.324, Speaker A: Actually, Thomas problem is now solved only for several cases. Namely phase stop Lastworth phase thought in 1943. He has a phase bound, so called and gives solution for 3.612 should have underward and consider it 5789. By the way, five. In the case five, it is also for high schools. Even one.
00:51:06.324 - 00:51:45.334, Speaker A: I saw that in some german Olympiad. Mathematical Olympiad for high schoolers to solve case five. Case 1011. It is a dancer in his work in 1963, what I mentioned already, very interesting. Case 1111 is of course for twelve it is twelve it is a cathahedron. Regular cathahedron. But eleven, nothing better than we can remove one of vertices and we obtain the optimal configuration for n equals eleven.
00:51:45.334 - 00:52:12.724, Speaker A: Yeah. And there was separate case. It was even before, because it is a very symmetric configuration, proved by. Actually he extended. Proved by Robinson. And he extended some method by facehold method. So it is this method dancer and should have underwent all of them based on contact graph.
00:52:12.724 - 00:52:41.756, Speaker A: This main technique is irreducible contact graphs. Nothing more, more or less simple geometry. But FerC, he considered some. He has some actually inequality that works for when actually it is for triangular. When we have a triangulation, they form triangulation. I mean, this vertices of this optimal. And for height it is.
00:52:41.756 - 00:53:18.864, Speaker A: And Robinson also consider triangular and squares. And we actually solved the problem the same this problem for Thomas problem for 13 and 14. But we enumerate by enumerating different graphs, for instance. So the status of this conjecture and the 15 is the first open question. Actually, let me just almost finish, just to show examples. This is example. This is a solution of the Thomas problem for certain points.
00:53:18.864 - 00:53:47.094, Speaker A: To prove that we consider it. We consider it about 100 million graphs. I remember, actually, I remember my first. I said when we discussed with Alex, it was many, I don't know, ten years ago, more than ten years ago. Yeah. We sit here in Texas and I told him, you know, let us use. I'm familiar with this technique.
00:53:47.094 - 00:54:20.640, Speaker A: I mean, this del sat method and linear programming. Let us use this one. It may be and also appeared already that time, already simidefin programming. I mean, let us use this. But for that he has to spend, I don't know, maybe several weeks or several months, I don't know, to study, to understand what does it mean, this math? And he said, okay. And he started to let us enumerate all cases. I said, okay, why not? Maybe we'll have with this.
00:54:20.640 - 00:54:44.876, Speaker A: I show you this constraints for graphs, right? Okay, maybe there is. Maybe there are a few. Few hundred. We look at them, you know, we print, we look at these cases and prove that almost by hand. But when. When our. When they received 100,100,000,000 cases, it was upset.
00:54:44.876 - 00:55:13.916, Speaker A: But however, 99% after it is generated, there is some generating these graphs. But I remember that it will be eliminated. All cases. 99% of cases limited during next 2 hours. And other also. But we spent about one week computations for 13. When to eliminate.
00:55:13.916 - 00:55:38.946, Speaker A: Like some bad cases, bad cases. For other it depends on method. Because like especially when we have a pentagon, it will take a lot of time. Because with some derision it depends on the method. Because we use a method, use only linear programming for. Okay, this is a case 13. And for case 14 is already.
00:55:38.946 - 00:56:01.774, Speaker A: We consider it one 1 billion. It's about 1 billion cases. Graphs. We consider it. And to prove that this configuration is optimal. And also. But no way, I mean to go for 15 using that we need something smart, something new, some new ideas.
00:56:01.774 - 00:56:30.210, Speaker A: Because in this case, and one of them at least if you have sort of this conjecture, two n two conjecture. Because to show that we have at least two n minus two edges, it helps a lot. Otherwise it will be. I don't know. It is possible. I expect for the 15, like 10 billion it was already impossible. It took for 14, it took a little bit less than one year.
00:56:30.210 - 00:56:54.214, Speaker A: Of course, you know, not all computations, but we some improve, some can try to reduce some cases. Eliminate some cases before. Yeah, okay. Probably. Let me. Let me stop in this case. Oh, by the way, have two minutes.
00:56:54.214 - 00:57:08.664, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, thank you. It's one more problem. One more problem. Also about that one. It was also. I mean, you also. You can see if you want, you can consider it like the case optospheres, right? And the spheres.
00:57:08.664 - 00:57:46.810, Speaker A: One of the interesting question related to contacts. It's already basically already presented something. But not for spherical case. It is actually this question very old. And there are several. Several papers that one of interesting paper is published by faith stood. He considered the real spherical contact number.
00:57:46.810 - 00:58:17.794, Speaker A: Because we have what we have. We have a spherical caps, right? The question is in my language. We have to find. We have to find maximum ages, right? But he defined also for a given n. We can define for a given distance. We can define k, sub n of t. It is a contact number.
00:58:17.794 - 00:58:48.670, Speaker A: Maximum kissing contact number on n spherical caps with diameter D. Yeah, and that is interesting. Robinson. I already mentioned his name in 1969. And the first thought solves the problem for cases. We can see here cases to find the maximum two, three, six and so on. And 60 is 120.
00:58:48.670 - 00:59:11.014, Speaker A: The reason is because in this case we have a. It depends on diameter. Depends on diameter d. But we have a kissing number, depends on diameter d. It can be. The first case is three, right? Between three, four and five. It cannot be greater than five, actually.
00:59:11.014 - 00:59:31.394, Speaker A: And they consider it all cases. Then, when all this. The maximum configuration always has a maximum number of kissing number. I mean local. In this case, the county, the remain case. You can see here there's a remain case. We solved with Taraso.
00:59:31.394 - 01:00:02.278, Speaker A: Just how solved because we have already classification. So we found all other cases. For 5710 and 1111 we know maximum configuration. Surprisingly, in case ten. In case ten, this number is 21. But the time resolution of Thomas problem gives only 20 more. These graphs that give you maximum contact right.
01:00:02.278 - 01:00:37.178, Speaker A: Is not irreducible. I explained how it looks like. Take icosahedron and remove two neighbors, two vertices and vertices, obtain ten vertices, give us best solution. So that are two different problems. I mean the Thomas problem and the maximum contact. I mean like contact number for a given number of or purchase on a sphere, right. Circles on a sphere to find the contact number.
01:00:37.178 - 01:01:07.734, Speaker A: So that is interesting. And I believe you notice the most simple problem. If you compare with the thumbnails problem. Because also we can enumerate. But in this case we actually not much geometry because we are looking only for contact. Yeah, several also interesting, some asymptotic for this maximum context. But I believe it is interesting problem and can be considered.
01:01:07.734 - 01:01:14.730, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Thank you for that very interesting talk. Let's thank our speaker and I think.
01:01:14.762 - 01:01:45.594, Speaker C: We have time for a couple of questions. All right. This is Caro speaking. Can you hear me? Yes, yeah, I just have, you know, you had a lot of open questions in your talk. I just want to add an additional one. If it is open, and this is about the first topic on steinerporism. So if it appears that it characterizes euclidean norm.
01:01:45.594 - 01:02:27.754, Speaker C: And so the question is, what happens if you replace the Euclidean norm by some other norm? One could think of a norm very close to the Euclidean one. And you could, you know, ask for existence of Steiner sequence for a given norm. So what I'm trying to ask. I mean, it appears that that first topic falls in the closed neighborhood of Schramm's theorem about generalizing cob under a certain theorem. And so it feels like, you know, a problem that could be considered. Have you considered that? Or has anyone worked on this?
01:02:30.614 - 01:02:52.054, Speaker A: You know what? Maybe. Maybe you're familiar. Do you remember like Conrad. Conrad, you remember him, right? So. And pool? Yeah, he considers some. I'm not sure, but he considers something like that. Not look at his.
01:02:52.054 - 01:02:57.574, Speaker A: Look at his papers. Right.
01:02:58.634 - 01:03:05.254, Speaker C: But your feeling is what so do you think steinerporism characterizes Euclidean.
01:03:09.774 - 01:03:31.834, Speaker A: Stein and prism characterize conformal map. Actually it is a hyperbolic. It is a fact for hyperbolic geometry, by the way, not Euclidean. Yeah, yeah. It is for intelligence. Because if you. What about this Steiner? Because if you have.
01:03:31.834 - 01:03:55.162, Speaker A: Since it is invariant of the inversion, right? Conformal maps. So we have that exactly what we have it also the same. The same for high dimensions. If you look in the other. So it is hyperbolic geometry. Not Euclidean. For Euclidean.
01:03:55.162 - 01:04:10.524, Speaker A: Actually it is not clear what does it. Ah. It is only. Only particular case we have when we have two concentric spheres, right? It's only one case. You need it because it's preserved for preserve. Preserve for distances. Yeah.
01:04:12.744 - 01:04:22.720, Speaker C: Yeah. The other question is about the last topic. Have you tried to extend your investigations to higher dimensional spherical spaces about the maximum content?
01:04:22.792 - 01:04:56.182, Speaker A: Yeah, it is interesting question. It is very hard. Actually. It is very hard. I almost said something about that not graph super complex, right? To consider complex. You know, even still up to I don't know how many years attempts and the casing arrangement in four dimensions still open. That means we have a three dimensional case because we have three dimensional sphere, right? And spherical three dimensional sphere in four dimensional case, four dimensional space.
01:04:56.182 - 01:05:24.984, Speaker A: Right. And in this case it will be. We have some poly, it will be complex, not graph. I mean, different also faces. I remember that I tried to do that. But even for the case nine points, the problem is still open in four dimensions to find the optimal configuration solution of the Thomas problem with nine points. The answer is known.
01:05:24.984 - 01:05:46.604, Speaker A: The conjecture is known. And Henry Cohen has a conjecture many years ago. It is more or less obvious. Look, one point, we have one point on the north Pole. After that we have a tetrahedron, regal tetrahedron. And we have another regular tetrahedron. And the last parallel.
01:05:46.604 - 01:06:07.412, Speaker A: And so it is. You can compute all, everything geometry. Not. It is not open. Very natural. What you to use this approach to extend this contact graph into this contact complex. I don't know how to call that contact complex.
01:06:07.412 - 01:06:40.548, Speaker A: Right. And in this case is known. I describe it actually it is if you consider like as a convex, how of this, we have a point on the sphere, right? We have a convex hub. You have a polytope actually for dimension polytope, right? Yeah. It is extremely interesting. Even if you can say something about this, I mean, like about this technique. Try to choose to solve this problem.
01:06:40.548 - 01:07:01.968, Speaker A: Nine, nine point. Recently I received like some received some submitted paper, but it is, there are gaps of that. Several people also claim that they solve the problem nine point problem. But however, it is still open. Yeah.
01:07:02.136 - 01:07:03.044, Speaker C: Thank you.
01:07:06.444 - 01:07:12.108, Speaker A: Yeah. So, Richard, are you here?
01:07:12.276 - 01:07:33.044, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So I want to say something about that. So the poncelet porism and the Steiner porism are actually pretty different because the Ponce les porism is quite harder to prove. You know, it doesn't follow from just the symmetries of the group. Have you thought about like, you know, and projected analogs of these higher dimensional configurations?
01:07:33.864 - 01:07:58.264, Speaker A: I know, and I never can. I never think about that. And I never thought about that because I know that was poncere, but I never thought about that. Oh, by the way, this actually what is interesting, we can consider projected also projected version of this, everything there. I skip this part. I mean, it does not related to Poncelli conjecture. It's not really.
01:07:58.264 - 01:08:17.224, Speaker A: I just put poncelerism, what is it? Also we can put together, we can assume also that we have some on the projected space, the same thing in the projected space, but not much known about that.
01:08:20.084 - 01:08:29.640, Speaker B: You could have ellipsoids rather than spheres, for example. And you could ask, I mean, I mean, there's some theory about.
01:08:29.752 - 01:08:31.488, Speaker A: I knew nothing about that.
01:08:31.576 - 01:08:33.416, Speaker B: Okay. Anyway. All right, never mind.
01:08:33.600 - 01:08:36.192, Speaker A: No, I know that it is interesting.
01:08:36.328 - 01:08:40.832, Speaker B: There's like a theory of billiards on like quadrant surfaces and things like that.
01:08:40.968 - 01:08:57.484, Speaker A: It is, yeah. I believe it is some heavy algebraic, real algebraic geometry like. Yeah, because it is, yeah, it is interesting, of course, but it is not much known about that different subject.
