00:00:00.160 - 00:00:19.654, Speaker A: Or mark. Okay, started recording. Hello everybody. Welcome to the week 13 of our focus program. It's my great pleasure to introduce you Alex, Bonnie. And he's going to talk about a fascinating topic, chrono problem, please, Alex.
00:00:19.814 - 00:01:17.934, Speaker B: Okay, thank you very much. I'm really sorry that I was unable to be on some of many courses which were interested for me in the past, because at the time I have exactly my lectures. And so it's unfortunate that I was unable to do that. Now we have a break and therefore it's much easier. So this is kind of mini course on the corona problem, and therefore it will be just somehow basic. And moreover, mostly I will talk about the Unidisk and everything will be just related to the unid disk. So at the end, or just in between, you can ask me some questions, and if I will know the answer, I will be happy to answer it.
00:01:17.934 - 00:03:17.346, Speaker B: So, first of all, the general definitions that we require here. So, we are working with a unital community of complex Banach algebra and the maximal ideal space of this algebra, say a capital denoted by Ma, is a set of non zero amorphism from a to the complex field. So then the general theory says that each of these homomorphism is a continuous linear functional on a. So this means that it is an element of the dual space a with a star, and moreover the set of homorphism Ma capital will be a subset of the closed unit ball of the dual space. So if we'll just consider in the close unit bull the weak star topology of a star, then together with this topology, the maximal ideal space will be compact and Hausdorff. And this topology usually is called the Gelfand topology. Now if I'll denote by CMA capital the Banach space of complex continuous functions on the maximal allele space a, then the Gillfan transform will be just simply the method of presenting an element of algebra, a k of algebra, a capital by means of continuous function on the maximal real space.
00:03:17.346 - 00:04:28.108, Speaker B: Here, just a formula. So actually this Gillfan transform, it is also a non increasing morphism of Banachel Shibas. The kernel in general may be non trivial, and usually the kernel will be the Jacobsen radical free capital. So one of the ways, just to say that this is just all elements, such that all homophism on this subset will be zeros. These are just Jacobson radical of a capital, and the algebra is called semi simple. If the Jacobson radical is zero, in this case we obtain just an inclusion, not embedding, but inclusion. Therefore, we can just consider elements of a capital for semi simple algebra as continuous function on the maximal dual space, but unfortunately just with some different norm.
00:04:28.108 - 00:06:00.766, Speaker B: However, if we'll assume also that the Glfand transform preserve norm of element square. So this means that Glfand transform of normal square will be just the same in the image and in here. Then in this case we obtained that it is just an isometric embedding of a capital inside of the Banach algebra continuous function on the maximal ideal space. Okay, now let us consider now some specific case where our unital subalgebra, a unit of close algebraic capital, is already sub algebra of the space of bounded continuous functions on a house door space x capital equity, supreme norm, and separating points of x. Then in this case definitely semi simple, and the Gelfand transformer in this case will be an isometric embedding. Moreover, we can embed also the space x capital inside of the maximal ideal space. Namely, each point of x capital, say point x, can be embedded as evaluation homomorphism of functions from the algebra at the point x.
00:06:00.766 - 00:07:02.844, Speaker B: So f maps to f. So we'll consider the inside of the maximal dual space of a using this embedding, and then take the closure of the image of x inside of the maximal gal space of a in the Gilfan topology. Of course, then the rest, the complement to this closure is called the corona. So usually for many different algebras, the corona problem is given as the SpaceX capital and algebra subalgebra of bounded complex functions, continuous complex functions on x capital to determine whether the correspondent corona is empty. So this means that in this case, the image of x capital inside of max inside of the maximal space is a dense subset. Yeah. So the question is to determine when it is true.
00:07:02.844 - 00:08:18.664, Speaker B: And this problem was studied for many different function algebras, but we will just concentrate only on the classical results about h infinity here. So now the problem, it's easy to see that the problem can be equivalently reformulated at the corona problem as follows. So everywhere Ga means the book of garnet bounded analytic functions. This is just the main, what does mean complement of corona? No, I told corona is called maximal ideal space minus the closure of x capital inside of the maximum ideal space. This is the corona, and we need just to prove that corona is empty. So ga means that this is just the book of garnets. All basic knowledge about the corona theorem and about bounded analytic functions on the disk can be found there.
00:08:18.664 - 00:09:24.204, Speaker B: But this result, actually the equivalently reformulated result can be easily obtained using some algebraic technique. So this is the result. We say that the collection of functions of one fn in a capital satisfy the trauma condition if you have the following inequality. So it is just strictly separated from zero by some delta more than zero. All these functions together. Now, we say that corona problem is solvable, meaning the same as corona is empty, if the following bezel equation can be solved inside algebra. So this means that if we have f one fn satisfying the corona condition one, then there are some other g, one gn in a capital, for which we have f one g, one plus one plus fn gn equals one.
00:09:24.204 - 00:10:19.258, Speaker B: So n here can be any number, any natural number. So if you know this, for all such entuples, then in this case the corona will be empty. So therefore the corona problem will be just zero. Now some history. So actually, if you consider the algebra h infinity, this means that the algebra of bounded holomorphic functions on the unidisc, on the open unidisk. Then, first, corona was posed by Caputani in 1941. This was just the time when the serial kill fund of normal, so called normal, was just developed.
00:10:19.258 - 00:11:34.934, Speaker B: And therefore it was kind of natural to ask some questions for basic algebras in the framework of this new theory. Okay, so it was posed by Kakutani in 1941. Now, Newman was working a lot on this subject in the 1950s. And this is the Newman who named the complement of the image, the complement of the closure of the image of the unit disk in the maximal ideal space, called it corona, because in case it is non empty, that would have been a set of maximal ideals suggestive of the sun's corona. And this is just why he named it like that. Now, Newman contribution was kind of just very important. Namely, this was, as it is known.
00:11:34.934 - 00:12:37.444, Speaker B: Now, this was the Newman who first introduced the notion of the garrison contour. And this is a basic actually concept of the whole serum. And moreover, Newman just reformulated peronicerium to some equivalent interpolation problem in the unit D squared infinity. Then this interpolation problem was solved in the famous paper of Carlson in 1962. So in particular, this means that now for h infinity, in 1962, the problem became a serum. So it is called Kermisson serum. So indeed, the unit disk is dense in the maximal ideal space of h infinity.
00:12:37.444 - 00:14:33.164, Speaker B: Now, some simplifications of the original correspond proof were made by Hermander, who used some algebraic technique, namely technique of causal complex, to reduce the coronal serum to the solution of some debar problem with uniform estimates. And along this line, the simplest proof of the corona theorem was obtained by Thomas Wolf in 1980. So, Thomas Wolf proof is really very powerful because it gives also some uniform estimates for on the boundary for a class of some specific debar equations with unbounded behavior near the boundary. Unfortunately the method can be just go further to some other more complicated domains and so forth. Still it's not enough just to prove corona serum and multi dimensional situation now. So I'll just briefly mention some other results related to one dimensional case. So for Iman's surfaces, corona was proved in several papers and in particular you know from the sixties that the corona is valid for finite border treatment surfaces.
00:14:33.164 - 00:15:40.138, Speaker B: Also I believe for connected domains. The most interesting results were approved by barents and then extended for some class of finitely sheeted covering Riemann surfaces later by Nakai. Also there are several examples of non planar Riemann surfaces for which the corona is non trivial. So especially I like one due to Fenor Laroson. It is about the covering and branch covering of some compact remains surface. But in fact still for more than 60 years now, the general problem for planar domains is still open. So the conjecture is that for all planar domains the corona problem is solvable.
00:15:40.138 - 00:17:04.284, Speaker B: So this means that corona is empty there and for functions and several variables, even for the Boolean poly disk, I guess still there is no results, positive results in this direction. If I'm wrong, sir, you can just correct me. So for planar domains, Demelin showed the corona problem is of local nature. This means that it is now just to prove the corona near the boundary points locally. And if you'll do this for each boundary point, then corona theory for planar domains is true. So just some of my information just is that the most the strongest corona theorem for planar domains was proved by Moore. And it states that the corona is empty for any domain with boundary contained in the graph of c one plus epsilon epsilon has any positive number function.
00:17:04.284 - 00:18:34.106, Speaker B: Okay, so this means that we are taking graph and just take part of the graph compact part and then just try to inscribe the open domain such that part of the boundary of the domain will be on this graph and then coronal theorem will be drew there. So this result was just obtained as an extension of early result of 1985 of Johnson Garnet for Tanzua domain. So Tanzua domain is a domain whose boundary is entailed in the real axis. Okay, so some other results. So handy established corona serum for complements of certain square counter sets and new del mon approved corona serum for complement of subset of Ellipse's graph of homogeneous type. Okay, so this result of new Dellman are just a generalization of the result of Jones and Jones and Marshall about homogeneous domains in the plane. So that's it for the history.
00:18:34.106 - 00:19:31.428, Speaker B: And now let us start just go further to some techniques used in the corona problem for the unit disk. So my goal is just to describe some kind of method of solving corona theorem for Banach valued all mortal function on the unidisc and then to go just to some operator corona problem. Okay, so we need some basic definitions. So, first of all, interpolating sequences for h infinity. So the Unidisc will be considered with symmetric row defined by this formula. It is called pseudo hyperbolic metric. So, sequence z and the Unidisc open.
00:19:31.428 - 00:20:32.472, Speaker B: Of course, unidisc is said to be interpolating for h infinity. If every interpolation problem of the ten equals a n and belongs to n capital. Natural numbers with bounded data has a solution in h infinity. So one easily checks that by the Banach open map and theorem, there is some constant and capital such that such solutions can be found, so that they satisfy the full and manipulative. The smallest possible m capital is said to be the constant of interpolation of this sequence z. So you can see that m capital here just necessarily more than equal one. So now the major contribution was given by Carla.
00:20:32.472 - 00:21:54.674, Speaker B: So on theorem. So, who proves the following result about the characterization of interpolation sequences in the union disk? So if you have zeta is an interpolating sequence, then actually the sequence zeta is interpolating for h infinity if and only if we have the following. First of all, so we have this condition actually. Okay. And moreover, he proved also that the constant of interpolation and capital of zeta satisfies of one inequalities can be more equal than it is more than equal to one over delta, and lesser equals than c over delta plus one plus one, one over delta, we see some absolute constant. So together with the interpolating sequence for h infinity, we can consider the Blaschki product having simple zero set points of zeta. So it is written just in the following form.
00:21:54.674 - 00:22:39.146, Speaker B: So m zeta is a function just minus z divided by modulus that. Yeah, and at zero, it is one. So the such Blaschki product, which has simply zeros at points of z is called the interpolating Blaschki product. And one easily checked that actually in this formula. So you can just, oops, sorry. Formula four can be written also in terms of the interpolating Blarsky product. So it will be this formula.
00:22:39.146 - 00:23:29.350, Speaker B: So we're taking the derivative computed z k t x modulus and then one minus model z k square. Okay, and therefore this is just the connection between Blaschki products and sequences. And using this connection one can prove also some results on the solution of the bar equations. So I will formulate the full length result and then we will discuss the proof of this result. We will start it today and probably finish next time. I don't know. Probably so, main result so suppose that we have a subset of matrix space m with metric m capital with metric d.
00:23:29.350 - 00:24:46.314, Speaker B: We say that this subset is epsilon separated. If all points xy distinct points xy in the set x, the distance between these two points Moser equals epsilon. The maximal epsilon separated subset of n capital is said to be an epsilon chain. In particular, if S capital is an epsilon chain, then s is epsilon separated. And for every z which is outside of this chain, there is a point of the chain such that the distance between z and this point will be less than epsilon. So in general existence of website chains follows easily from the Zorant lemma. So next, a close subset with an anomaly intrigue k capital in the unit disk such that epsilon chain of k some epsilon chain with respect to the upset pseudo hyperbolic metric rho is an interpolating sequence which infinity will be called the Carlos onset.
00:24:46.314 - 00:25:56.352, Speaker B: Okay, so this means that inside of k we will find some interpolation sequence which is also some epsilon chain of k. Okay, now if we have this fact for some specific epsilon, say epsilon one over two, then using some theory, one can prove actually Hoffman's result. In particular, one can prove that this is true for every epsilon. So if k has some specific epsilon chain satisfying this properties, and any other epsilon chain of k capital will satisfy the same property. Okay, so next, the full length. We need some full length notations. So I will present here some simplest form of the result and therefore I will just assume smoothness in all the spaces.
00:25:56.352 - 00:26:59.166, Speaker B: But actually it is not necessary. So given a complex Banach space x capital by zero infinity, kx will denote the space of x value c infinity functions on the unit disk whose support is inside of this closed k and which are uniformly continuous with respect to the pseudo hyperbolic metric row and norm will be just the l infinity norm. Sorry, not l infinity norm. So just l infinity x norm. So you'll just take him at each point, z will take norm and x and then take supreme over z and open disk. So, okay, so the general result is the full n one. Given after this onset there is a continuous linear operator.
00:26:59.166 - 00:28:48.364, Speaker B: I will denote it as lkx from zero infinity kx into zero infinity dx is norm bounded by a constant depending on k only such that for every function from zero infinity kx, if I just apply first to this function, this linear operator, and then take the derivative with respect to z barrier, then we obtain one divided by one minus modulus z squared. Moreover, if original function was such that its image was relatively compact in x capital, then the same will be true for the image of lkxf. Okay, so the operator preserves relatively compact images. Okay, this is the main result. And this result actually will be used in general to prove the generalization of the corona serum. Now, the result actually is just the generalization of the approach of Carlisle, because in the original proof of the perlison, he used some kind of elements such that the gradient of function has support in some correspond sets. Okay, but it will be later.
00:28:48.364 - 00:30:04.804, Speaker B: Next. Actually, you see here just some constant dependent on k capital. But in fact, one can prove more a strong result. So, first of all, if I just fix some epsilon one or two chain and k such that this characteristic of this chain just more than equals delta, which is more than zero, then actually one can prove that the operator in this cilium has the following bond norm of the operator, lesser equivalent c delta. And what is c delta. So c delta is a function in delta, and it can be bonded by actually, all right, here. So actually it is just one can take, for instance, oops, c times lan, one divided by delta.
00:30:04.804 - 00:31:13.044, Speaker B: Okay, c is an absolute constant. So one can prove this result even, but it requires actually more complicated technique. And therefore, I cannot just prove this result. Actually, it will be just a sketch of the proof. Okay, so, some preliminary version of this theorem was appeared on my paper, I believe, eight years ago, but I proved it only for functions with compact support, sorry, for functions with relatively compact images. The second part. But in fact, the method of the proof works also in this general situation as well.
00:31:13.044 - 00:32:14.724, Speaker B: And therefore. So, in my paper, it was just formulated in the way that it was difficult to read for some, for some specialist in the function theory, because I used some special topology on the maximal ideal space. So here in this talk, I will just do the same without any topologies. So it will be just straightforward. So the main just result which can be used in the proof of theorem is the following particular case. So in this particular case, we use the following technical lemma. I believe it belongs to Hoffman, but actually I'll consider, I will require only part of it, and this will just very simple, so you don't need it Hoffman is not required here.
00:32:14.724 - 00:33:47.050, Speaker B: So this lemma is just presented in the book of Garnet, chapter ten. Lemma 1.4 so suppose we have an interpolating blaschki product b capital with 00:10 and assume that the characteristic of this interpolation problem is bounded from below by delta. Then there exists the following two functions dependent on delta lambda and r lambda between zero one, r between zero and one. Actually, r always will be less than lambda, such that limit delta tends to one lambda delta equals one, limit r delta equals one and the set, the pre image of the disk of radius r centered at zero with respect to b will be the union of pairwise de joined domains vm satisfying the following properties. Each vn will be just a subset of the pseudo hyperbolic disk centered at zn and radius lambda of open pseudo hyperbolic disk. Okay? Moreover, every vn b maps every vn bothalamorphic one.
00:33:47.050 - 00:35:16.082, Speaker B: Here we need just to put point, because the next we need to put period here. So, because the next part actually is not important in the proof, but nevertheless, I will just formulate it, and for all w of modulus less than r, the following function, so just again will be just inner function. But in fact there is a product of interpolating Blaschki product with 10 in each vn and a constant, some constant number of modulus one. So actually this will just also interpolate in Plaschky product. So in the future, by b we will denote the holomorphic map which is in reverse to the restriction of the Blaschke product to the set v. Okay, so what we need here, actually we need just first part, this part we need for the proof without actually, without these asymptotics when delta tends to one, so only this one, but more explicit, which is given still in Garnet's book. And we need also the fact that for all such w, the preimages will be also interpolated in sequences.
00:35:16.082 - 00:37:00.210, Speaker B: And also we can estimate the characteristic of interpolating sequence in this case. Okay, so using this technical lemma, first of all, we'll prove the following proposition. There exists some positive epsilon, which is less ripple than r from the previous lemma, and functions of bounded complex, bounded holomorphic functions of two variables defined on the product of the unidisc and the disk of radius epsilon centered at zero such that the following is true, fgbg equals one. So this means that at the point, roughly speaking, on the graph of b capital b one, and if k is distant from g, then the same will be zero. And moreover, we have the sum overall g of module f g z w less represent two m, where m is under plating sequence for the original sequence j. Okay, the j was just the set of zeros of this blasphemy problem. Okay, so, but remember that when I have started, actually we have just the bound for m capital with respect to delta, the characteristic of the interpolation sequence.
00:37:00.210 - 00:38:22.644, Speaker B: And therefore, using this we can obtain some effective estimates. Okay, so first of all, we'll prove, we will use another classical result, which is presented in the book of Garnet, namely that the interpolation problem can be solved in a linear way. In a linear way. This means that for this interpolating sequence z k, we can find bounded on a holomorphic function gga such that at one point the g will be one and all other points will be zero. Moreover, there are good functions that if I'll just take some overall j of modulo g jz, then it will be less ripple than m capital. So this is just the interpolating constant, and z belongs to d. So the proof is just, it is kind of a solution of some external proof problem from the theory of bounded calligraphy functions on the disk.
00:38:22.644 - 00:39:43.160, Speaker B: But actually, if instead of m capital you write here m square, a weaker, weaker inequality, then a nice proof was obtained in the more general situation by Varopoulos. And still it is just inside of the garnet book somewhere, so you can find it there. So, but just to get a better estimate of the solutions which I will not present in this mini course, it's better just to have m capital here, but not m squared. Okay, so now we will consider the following bounded linear operator from l infinity on the natural numbers to h infinity of norman capital, namely. So it will be just if I have a sequence in l infinity and capital, then it will be just operator access some aggjz. So operator to each sequence will give you some function from h infinity. So norm of the operator will be exactly m according to these properties.
00:39:43.160 - 00:40:25.462, Speaker B: Yeah, this property, this, the last inequality here will be just norm, because the last inequality will be just kind of norm of l one. And this is just duality. This sum will give you the duality. Now let us consider also the restriction operator from back from h infinity to l infinity. Natural. How? Simply. Yeah, so it depends on w, and it will be as follows.
00:40:25.462 - 00:41:01.434, Speaker B: I'll just take w from the unit disk, then consider digits and worst maps to b capital. So BJW will be just inside of v capital j. So it will inverse map. So it will be just point there. So roughly speaking, it is pre images of w in doctor, with respect to Blaschki product b capital. Okay. And so we'll consider restriction of h infinity back to these sequences.
00:41:01.434 - 00:42:10.594, Speaker B: The difference is that in here we started gg will just relate it to sequence, fixed sequence z k. But here we'll consider just some perturbation. Now consider decomposition of these two operators l and then r. Yeah. Then the formula gives us this just expression. Okay, this expression, and you can just see that if here I will take w equals zero, then bk of zero will be exactly z k. So, yeah, so, and therefore, actually that k and g at that k will be either zero or one.
00:42:10.594 - 00:42:46.434, Speaker B: So in particular, we obtain the full operator of the composition. So it will be over the, .0 it will be the identity operator. So at zero, it will be identity operator. And moreover, so just from this formula obtained, that the operator depends holomorphic on w and this disk tr. Okay, so then we'll just take the cache estimates for derivatives, bounded holomorphic functions, which is simple in the unit disk. Yeah.
00:42:46.434 - 00:43:23.856, Speaker B: So it will be the full length estimate. And then take sufficiently small w here. So the term minus w is just sufficiently large. For instance, take epsilon equals r divided by three divided by m. The interpolation constant here of the sequence. Then the difference between norm of w, p w and one, it is the same as here. And here we use just kind of estimate for the derivative.
00:43:23.856 - 00:44:03.310, Speaker B: So it will be w times m over r minus modulus w. And because of the choice of epsilon, so it will be less or equal than one over two. For w less or equal than epsilon. So it is less than equals over one over two. This means that the operator pw is invertible. And moreover, using the inversion, just straightforward inversion, as a series, we obtain that the inverse operator has normal as equal to. Okay, and therefore, let us just slightly correct our operator l.
00:44:03.310 - 00:44:49.616, Speaker B: I remember that l was just, we started with it. We started with, it was just like that. So it's slightly correct. Using the inverse of pw for w sufficiently small, and for this operator, we obtain that l with the head w is continuous, depends collomorphically on point. From the disk of radius epsilon, and norm of it will be less or equal than two m, right? Because norm of the original operator l was less or equal than m and normal is less than equal to, so less than equals two m. And moreover. So we just corrected it.
00:44:49.616 - 00:45:40.628, Speaker B: And therefore, now ll with the head in composition, with restriction to the sequence being viewers of w will be just the identity operator. Okay? So therefore it will be just writing words. Lw will be writing words to the restriction operator. So and finally, let us define the following function v j dependent on w. So the function will be from h infinity. Of course it will be l with w applied to the standard basis in l infinity. This means that delta j will be of the following form.
00:45:40.628 - 00:46:30.984, Speaker B: It will be one if I equal j and zero otherwise. So we'll apply it to this and this will be our functions. Then for these functions, I just remind you what we need to obtain here. We obtain for this function the following, not this, sorry, the following. So why do we need these functions? Actually? So these functions will require to do the full on procedure. So I will explain it now, and then probably I will stop here and we'll go for the next time. So let us consider the graph.
00:46:30.984 - 00:47:43.544, Speaker B: Let us consider the graph of the Blaschke function b. So this will be w equals. So this axis will be w, and this axis will be z. So the previous operator will allow us to do the full end. So suppose that I have some function in the disk with some support near the set of zeros of the Blaschki product b. We can just transfer this function actually on the ground, because graph in this part of the disk here, still the same. So our function will be in here.
00:47:43.544 - 00:48:38.544, Speaker B: So suppose this will be just function. Yeah, and then it has some values at this point. So then what I'll do, I will just take these directions. Oops. Notice I'll take these directions. And so here over these points we obtain close to the set where we have set of zeros of daschy product, which is interpolating sequence here. So all these sequences just closed, it still will be interpolating.
00:48:38.544 - 00:50:02.440, Speaker B: And therefore the previous linear operator allows us to extend simultaneously the value of function f at all these interpolating functions, interpolating sequences to the whole function on this horizontal line parallel to z axis, as in this way, if we have function here which is very close to support, very close to the set of the Blaschki product, then we can linearly extend it to the function on the cylinder. So cylinder means that it will be just part in here and then it will be on the disk everywhere there. But the main property of this function will be that this function adjust over the coordinate z. It will be a bounded holomorphic function over the coordinate w will be whatever it was. Yeah. And therefore, if we have, say debar equation for such function, then if we use this method of extension, then we translate our debar equation on the dz to the Debar equation on the poly disc. Yeah, poly disk.
00:50:02.440 - 00:50:34.454, Speaker B: So part by z and part by w on these polydisc. Actually this function, not just any function, but this function which is galamorphic over the horizontal lines. And therefore it allows us very simple formula for the solution of the equation. This is the main actually method of the proof. Okay. Geometrically and probably I will stop here now, if you have any questions I will be happy to answer it and then we'll continue next time.
00:50:36.394 - 00:50:44.694, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, Alex. Let's thank the speaker first. Wonderful talk. Any question or comments for Alex?
00:50:49.694 - 00:51:12.554, Speaker B: Yeah, I see. Is there a domain and the plane for which the corona is not empty. Now this is just I mentioned at the beginning, this suggests an unsolved open problem. So for planner domains, still the conjecture is that the corona CRM is valid for any planner domain, but unfortunately it is still open.
00:51:18.954 - 00:51:40.854, Speaker A: There was something which brought to my attention by Bill Ross and also a few weeks earlier by Paul Guti, also the new paper by two polish mathematician. I think the name, if I remember correctly was. You want to add something about it?
00:51:43.884 - 00:51:48.292, Speaker B: Yeah. So I have some, I don't know.
00:51:48.308 - 00:51:50.356, Speaker A: The complete news, but apparently there is.
00:51:50.380 - 00:52:19.864, Speaker B: Something actually I even saw, at least I did not read it just carefully, but I saw some ideas. I think the ideas are very interesting. So maybe at the end, at least one of the idea. I'm ready just to present at the end of my, my last lecture. I don't know. So no. So still there is no any information about whether it is true or wrong.
00:52:19.864 - 00:52:37.752, Speaker B: Nothing else is known yet. So what I believe maybe are they here? I don't know. Are there this mathematician are between our participants? Not. I don't know.
00:52:37.848 - 00:52:43.600, Speaker A: No, I don't think so. But our friend Marek Ptak is from.
00:52:43.672 - 00:52:53.244, Speaker B: Poland, maybe he knows just some latest news. I don't know because I don't have any information about.
00:52:53.784 - 00:53:01.484, Speaker A: Neither do I. The only thing I heard is that the paper is now submitted because before it was just an archive.
00:53:02.224 - 00:53:27.064, Speaker B: Oh yeah, I know that it is submitted, but still there is no information about whether it is true or not. But idea is interesting and actually I believe that idea is okay. I don't know whether it is possible to go through all these steps that are in the paper because it's quite technical idea I can present later.
00:53:27.684 - 00:53:32.676, Speaker A: Sure. Any further comment or question for.
00:53:32.780 - 00:53:49.044, Speaker B: Yeah, by the way, so. And I don't believe that it is possible to prove Peru serum for multidimensional domains using the deeper method because it becomes too complicated. So therefore it should be some other method.
00:53:54.944 - 00:54:02.084, Speaker A: Thank you. If there is no further comment or question, let's thank Alex again.
00:54:02.904 - 00:54:05.504, Speaker B: So then we'll continue tomorrow probably.
