00:00:01.680 - 00:01:15.964, Speaker A: Welcome back, everybody. So, we are continuing our proof of the theorem that is indeed almost surely generated by Levner curves. And what we just did, we just reduced the whole proof to the proof that the diameter of the image of some fixed rectangle s, of some fixed rectangle s, is bounded by certain constant. So, or more specifically, the probability that this image is bigger than minus two minus j, sigma is small. So, well, the probabilities of all such events are sample. Now, let's carefully look at this guy. So let me actually try to draw a picture here.
00:01:15.964 - 00:02:14.934, Speaker A: So this is x, y. So x goes between two to the minus j plus three, two minus j plus three. So minus, plus, and y goes between two to the minus j, minus one, two to the minus j. So it's a rectangle around zero, like this. Notice that it has fixed hyperbolic size. By this, I mean that when we rescale it by factor two to the minus j, this is one to one new obvious map of the unit of the, sorry, of the upper half plane. So it preserves hyperbolic metric.
00:02:14.934 - 00:02:50.034, Speaker A: And so, from the hyperbolic point of view, this is the same. So just multiply by two to the minus j to this exciting rectangle. So one, one, two here, and here it's minus eight. Well, definitely not to scale eight. So this guy has fixed hyperbolic size independent on j. And now I will use it. And Bloch estimate.
00:02:50.034 - 00:03:54.044, Speaker A: Remember that Bloch estimate says that conformal maps, even near the boundary, they still leap shots, but not as a map from euclidean distance, from lipsticks, from hyperbolic metric to euclidean metric, or again, more specifically, by block estimate, for every Zns derivative of our conformal map. And at this point, it's ft prime hat of the is not, should not be different from the derivative at the center of this rectangle. Well, it's not quite the center at this picture. It's this point. But again, that fixed hyperbolic distance. So this is bounded by some fixed constant a, which does not depend on j. This is all I'm using.
00:03:54.044 - 00:05:25.544, Speaker A: So, diameter of s is bounded by some constant times the diameter of s, well, which is approximately two to the minus j. Again, we are discarding constants here by incorporating them here, multiplied by the derivative at this one fixed point I two to the minus j. So, as we discussed before, we can bound djk this is diameter of. So, let me return to the very top. Dgk is the diameter of this image of rgk under this ft of iy map. And that's what we want to estimate. So this is bounded by the sum from n equal to zero to n capital diameters of ft heads of this capital s.
00:05:25.544 - 00:06:31.984, Speaker A: So this is capital s. And now we can estimate diameter of each of them by two to the minus j times the derivative. Here it should be with a constant. And so this is bounded by constants times two to the minus j times n times maximum of the derivatives at each point t n hat from big or equal. Okay, so by using simultaneously probabilistic manipulation and distortion estimates from complex analysis, we can now estimate the probability that this is big or equal than two to the minus j sigma. We estimate it by the following. First, we'll look at the event when n is bigger than j squared.
00:06:31.984 - 00:07:14.306, Speaker A: That's very bad. And when this factor is way too large. But this is a very rare event, because remember, probability, the ten is bigger than something is rho to this power. So this is rho to the square power. So, probability of this event is bounded by rho to the j squared. That's really rare. On the other hand, then this would be j squared probability that this holds for some n, right? So this is, since this is maximum.
00:07:14.306 - 00:08:18.654, Speaker A: So this is j squared probability that this holds for some n. And now by our estimate star, where is our estimate star where we estimated everything by, well, where we first estimated probabilities that fs is large. And then we said, okay, probability that for some n, Ftn is large is bounded by constant times the probability that fs large for sum s. And since there we had uniform estimate, this is two minus two plus epsilon j. So this is bounded by c, one to the power minus two plus epsilon j. And this is enough, because now we can just plug in this bound. So let's look at our claim.
00:08:18.654 - 00:09:12.618, Speaker A: Claim, come on. So this is, we now know is bounded by two minus epsilon. Oh, sorry. Actually. So let's, so I wanted to be, well, when you look at it later, so that you don't see that I'm claiming this here, so this probability is bounded by two to the minus two plus epsilon j. Now let's remember that there are two to the two j case. So this would be two minus epsilon j.
00:09:12.618 - 00:10:04.204, Speaker A: That's why we needed this little epsilon. That's why we needed sigma to be strictly less than kappa minus eight squared. And then you sum up to minus epsilon j and everything works out. And with this, we finish the proof of theorem modulo, of course, one extremely important estimate. I still owe you the derivative estimate. So let me again show you this very technical estimate. So this is the derivative estimate that I'm in this one.
00:10:04.204 - 00:10:46.094, Speaker A: And now let us prove it. And then actually it will imply something else. Okay. And the proof itself is actually quite cute and interesting. So. And it talks about yet another aspect of evolution which actually has nothing to do with stochasticity, but actually would be very useful here. So what I want to do here is to consider what is called reverse slow.
00:10:46.094 - 00:11:28.174, Speaker A: So, for this, we extend the definition of gt and ft for negative t. So, well, nothing exciting happens here. We just solve corresponding equation for negative time t. So we just reverse time. Or if you want, you just solve it for driving function run in opposite direction. Okay, so what would happen? Amazing thing would happen. This function z to g minus t of z.
00:11:28.174 - 00:12:24.814, Speaker A: So in negative time. So remember Gt was unwriping map, but for negative time, roles of g and f would switch. So what I claim is that g minus t has the same law as ft hat minus b of kappa t. Okay, so g minus t actually stops being unwrapping map. And instead it starts mapping to a domain to upper half plane with some curve removed. Okay, so that's the statement. And as you will see from the proof, the statement actually has nothing to do with probability.
00:12:24.814 - 00:13:08.214, Speaker A: Just if you consider reverse flow of any lieutenant revolution, it is the same as inverse of direct flow driven by slightly different functions. So you'll see in a moment what it is. So, to prove this exciting statement, we just fix reality one and let psi of t. Just to simplify notation, be bit of k t and psi delta of t would be psi of t one plus t minus psi of t. But for brownian motion, we know that in law, it's the same as xi f t. And here is a misprint. So this should be xi f t.
00:13:08.214 - 00:13:51.724, Speaker A: Otherwise it's not much of a process. So we just Markov property. Let us now define gt tilde the following way. We take ft one. We take it at the point z plus xi t one. We take now, so we map from the upper half plane to this curve. Now we take back gt one plus t, and we subtract xi of t one.
00:13:51.724 - 00:14:23.894, Speaker A: New function. Okay, well defined. Now let's take t equal to zero. Then what it is, it's gt one of f t one of z plus xi t one minus xi t one. So this is exactly z. Now let's plug in minus t one here. That's also interesting, because this thing is now dead.
00:14:23.894 - 00:15:01.174, Speaker A: Just identity. And this would be f t one of z plus xi f t one. Let's remember that this is what we call ft one. Hat of z minus xi of t one. So dt of g t tilde of z would be two over. Well, let's do the derivatives of everything. The only thing which we differentiate is this.
00:15:01.174 - 00:15:50.924, Speaker A: So this would be two gt tilde of z minus image of the tip, right? And the image of the tip is xi of t plus t one, minus xi of t one. So again, if you want to determine next statement, g t tilde is driven by xi of t plus t one, minus xi of t one. But now we know. Let's return to Stockholm stack case. This is the same as psi of t. So this is driven by psi delta psi tilde rise of t. So this satisfies two over g t tilde of z minus psi tilde of t, which is sli kappa, again, because this has the law of barrier of capital.
00:15:50.924 - 00:16:39.004, Speaker A: Ok, and now let's take t is equal to t one. So g t one of z would be. So gt one or tilde. So this would be, oh, I'm sorry. Take t is equal to minus t one. Again. And we see exactly this.
00:16:39.004 - 00:17:10.464, Speaker A: So if you take again t is equal to minus t one, we see that g of g tilde of minus t one is just f t one hat minus xi f t one. That's exactly this. So this has the same law as this. Okay, let's be very careful. I'm not saying that it's the same thing. It has the same law. When you change t this, and this evolves totally different.
00:17:10.464 - 00:18:10.334, Speaker A: This actually satisfies Pde. This satisfies ode. But by this calculation, which we just did, we see that at fixed time, they have the same law, but they describe very different values. Okay, so this is what reverse flow is. Why is it good? Essentially, if you're interested, say in derivative of ft, at some moment, t is the same map as g minus t and one. So if you are not interested in evolution in t, but you are interested in some estimates for fixed t, of course it's easier to deal with equation for g minus t, which is od, because here you have Pde, right? That's complicated. OD are easier.
00:18:10.334 - 00:19:03.864, Speaker A: So that's what we will deal with. Instead of taking derivatives of this and all this will take derivatives of this. And then we look at the inverse flow, reverse flow evolution. That's actually a huge tool in this study of schrammle of revolution. Okay, now let's look carefully at GT. We know by this discussion that is defined for negativity, because it's simply a map from the upper half plane to somewhere. And then it will be defined up to some time tz where z is.
00:19:03.864 - 00:19:50.664, Speaker A: This is the last time when you are still in your domain ft of H. And then your point is kind of swallowed, as we will see later. For couple less equals than four, this moment probably would never come. You are always defined. But what I claim here is that this guy is actually decreasing. Again, you look at the equation for GT and you see that derivative of imaginary part, which is the imaginary part of the derivative, is actually negative because you divide by something from the upper half plan. And here comes very important time change.
00:19:50.664 - 00:20:37.094, Speaker A: So, remember when we studied martingales, it was very important to change time to make it equal to quadratic variation. Then you become brownian motion. This is natural time for Sle. But unfortunately, well, there are many unfortunate things here. First of all, it's very much d dependent. So tu, by definition, would be the moment when this imaginary part of gtu of z is equal to. Uh, okay, I want to make sure that it's well defined.
00:20:37.094 - 00:21:26.374, Speaker A: So we need to check that tu is less than infinity, almost surely. So what does it mean? It means that logarithm in infinite, when you go to minus infinity, it goes to infinity. When you go to zero, imaginary part should go to zero. So logarithm goes to minus infinity. So this is a well defined time for all uf and infinity. Let's prove that it's well defined. Well, let's use ljovnar.
00:21:26.374 - 00:22:44.124, Speaker A: Absolute value of derivative is twice gt minus xi of t inverse. And let's. This would be the supreme of brownian motion until the time t. So observe that if j's was bigger than psi of t, then we simply say that this derivative, well, this is bounded by this at this point. So if at some point s absolute value of j's is bigger than this, then we can estimate the derivative at this point. Ok, let's look at the set u of all times which are less than t, such that absolute value of j's is bigger than this maximum of granular motion up to time. And let s would be this j's minus psi.
00:22:44.124 - 00:23:24.944, Speaker A: Okay, now let's differentiate. So this s prime squared derivative is two s s prime. Let's look what is s prime? Okay, you plug this in. So this is bounded by four. So the square of this doesn't change by four. So if you look over each component of u, we get that gt of z is equal to. Well, if it's less than psi of t is.
00:23:24.944 - 00:24:15.104, Speaker A: But if it's more than psi of t, it should be a of t plus this maximum. And then you integrate. So a of t is bounded by two square root of t. And you started at z absolute value of z, remember? So gt of z is bounded by this maximum. Brown in motion plus two square root of t plus absolute value of the. By the way, this is a cool estimate anyway. And now if y of t would be our imaginary part, and let's estimate the derivative of the logarithm of Y of t.
00:24:15.104 - 00:25:11.454, Speaker A: And this would be, of course, remember, it's decreasing, so it's negative. So let's take minus it. So again, we just differentiate. We get that imaginary part of two gt minus psi over imaginary part of gt. And now we know that this is simply bounded by this. So this is bounded by two over z bar absolute value of z plus psi of t plus two over square root of t. And okay, so this is now just a reminder what xi biotech.
00:25:11.454 - 00:25:58.462, Speaker A: And now, by hinging low of iterated logarithms, this is actually a small square root of t. Because remember, we had this, we know the distribution of the maximum after time t. So it's like the distribution of absolute value of brownian motion, essentially. So it's a small square root of t. So this derivative after the subtle, it's like one over square root of t. When you go to t plus minus infinity, it's not integrable. That's the main thing, it's not integrable.
00:25:58.462 - 00:26:56.482, Speaker A: So this log of y of t goes to infinity and minus infinity wherever you go. And that's it. Okay, so this is a well defined time change. Okay? So the inverse time change, of course, would be that u of t is log of imaginary part of GTF. And again, let me emphasize that all of these things, all of these computations, there is a reason why they called one point computations. These are done at one point z and at one time t, eventually. So we would estimate derivative at one time t.
00:26:56.482 - 00:28:15.174, Speaker A: So that's why you would be able to do the reverse flow. Okay? And now if you take the derivative, well, this is log of imaginary part of GT. So this is exactly this. And by the calculations that we did here, this is minus two over gt of z, minus psi of t squared. Okay, so now we fix some point z hat energy. And now for all unr, let's look at what happens with our point after we apply our map g. So this is, we take out the head, we start flowing this under g, and we flow it up to the time when imaginary part of z is exponential.
00:28:15.174 - 00:28:55.758, Speaker A: And then we normalize. So that again, if we started flowing at the tip, then we get to zero. So x of u would be real part of this guy, so real part of this minus brownian motion. And the imaginary part is by definition exponent of u. And then we'll need another auxiliary annotations. So psi of u would be the following. Remember, we are estimating the derivatives, so this would be the derivative.
00:28:55.758 - 00:29:57.274, Speaker A: But let's normalize, let's normalize by y hat divided by y of u. So this is y. So this is the same as y hat e to the u g t u prime of z hat. So this is just very specific function of derivative at fixed time t. Um, and the estimate that we will prove actually rest on the following observation. Let nu would be minus sine of log of y hat. Basically nu is equal to one if and only if y hat is less than one.
00:29:57.274 - 00:30:30.064, Speaker A: Why am I writing absolute value ends up a half plant. So I had is less than one. So new would be equal to one. If we start below level log of y hat equal to zero. So we need to do inverse flow to get to one. And this is equal to minus one if you have to start above zero. And we use direct flow to go down to one.
00:30:30.064 - 00:31:10.336, Speaker A: Okay, so b is our real parameter. And let a and lambda be related to b by very familiar formulas. Now, so this is the same as we saw before. So a is to b plus nu kappa b one minus b over two. Lambda is four, b plus nu kappa b one minus two, b over two. And now let us set up an interesting function. So f of z hat would be expectation of this construct.
00:31:10.336 - 00:31:54.464, Speaker A: So we'll look at how exciting Gt. But we look at derivative for Gt at the moment when imaginary part of g is equal to zero. So this is, you flow from point z head and you reach the point where imaginary part of zero or j is equal to zero. And here you take the derivative at the power I. You multiply it by this normalization, one plus x of zero. So real part of this Gt squared. So this is all squared.
00:31:54.464 - 00:32:36.654, Speaker A: And then you also multiply by Y hat to the power. And the claim is that this all exciting thing, f of z hat. So essentially it's expectation of 8th power of g, t prime. Well normalized a little bit. You can compute it. Here's the value. Okay, so that's the statement of the main estimate.
00:32:36.654 - 00:33:16.834, Speaker A: Every time you see that actually something is equal to expectation of something, you can bet that there will be a Martin girl somewhere and I will be martingale somewhere. So let me prove this theorem as I promised. It's not too difficult. Okay, so let us return to our exciting computation of Du. So, we already had this. DTu is minus two dt minus xi t squared. So du is minus two dt.
00:33:16.834 - 00:33:58.874, Speaker A: And so remember that this is just by definition z of u. So du is minus dt. Aha. So this would be a new time change. So let's define a brownian motion with respect to this times change. So this simply would be b hat of u minus tau over kappa integral from zero to t z of u t d psi of t. Then, quadratic variation.
00:33:58.874 - 00:34:44.954, Speaker A: We use this fact that quadratic variation of this is the integral of zu squared times this and, okay, z u squared. So this is z u inverse. Sorry. So this is minus two z inverse dt. This is just du. So this is standard brownian motion. So b hat is a brownian motion with respect to time.
00:34:44.954 - 00:35:44.194, Speaker A: Uh, but it's also this integral stochastic integral. Okay? And now this whole thing tells us. So this formula tells us what would be our martingale. Namely, we define the function f hat to be one plus x over y squared result to the power b to the power multiplied by y to the power lambda, and apply all this to z of u, and also multiply, aha. Here, psi of u. And by now, everybody forgot what it is. But remember, this is just gtu prime of z.
00:35:44.194 - 00:36:53.694, Speaker A: So this is our exciting guide. Okay, so now this all, of course, looks like rabid pulled from the head, because now I use it to just see that this is minus two m b x over x squared plus y squared dxi. And now remember that psi and b hat are different. Well, square root of copper first, but then also this factor, which is square root of x squared plus y squared. So you get that this satisfies this equation and, okay, so you can make these computations, and you do this. And then you wonder, well, how did they arrive to this is geniuses. And just decided to take this? Well, of course they will.
00:36:53.694 - 00:38:03.784, Speaker A: They are pretty smart guys and probably geniuses. But the reason why they arrived to this is not some divine intervention. The reason is that, let me remind you what we did when we studied Basel processes, how we wanted to come up with some function phi, which described certain probabilities. And we said, okay, assume that it's a solution. Then it should satisfy this OD. Exactly the same trick actually happens here. You look at this expectation, you say, okay, I want it to be a local Martingale first drift term should disappear in ethical collation, I write differential equation, I solve it, and that would be my solution.
00:38:03.784 - 00:39:15.750, Speaker A: So you write differential equation, you solve this zero solution, and now you go opposite way, exactly like we did with Bessel processes. Okay, I should say that this, well, this is not quite a trick, but again, this took apparently the author some time to invent it, that first you found this function f head from solving differential equation. But now you are proving that this is indeed what you want. So for this, you consider this local martingale, again from meta calculus. This is a local martingale. Let's look at its quadratic variation. And this is, again, you just pay the formula for the quadratic variation of e t integral.
00:39:15.750 - 00:40:30.774, Speaker A: This is just two Kappa multiplied by square of this ds. And this is bounded by some constant, which depends only on t capital. Remember, we are ranking up to t capital integral from zero to, uh, m squared plus one, as long as, of course, u is bounded. Okay, so now you look at it and use ik. There was this lemma, which probably seemed obscure at this time when we were talking about it, and this was the lemma. Suppose that we have just a local martingale, and you know that its quadratic variation satisfies exactly this condition. Okay, so let's return to our discussion now.
00:40:30.774 - 00:41:47.864, Speaker A: So this is exactly the condition we described. So this is a martingale. So this m of u is a martingale. So if you take expectation of this guy, so expectation of this guy for u equal to zero, you should have the same as expectation of this guy. So let me write what this is. So this is also expectation of phi, of psi, of your head, f hat of the head, because at the moment, so your starting position here is your hat. So, because again, you start a deterministic start by this.
00:41:47.864 - 00:42:32.144, Speaker A: That's, by the way, the reason why you needed this new here. So that the computations actually go through here. Okay. And so now we have that this expectation of right hand side is exactly equal to this. Well, so this is not f of the hat. This is y hat. F of the hat.
00:42:32.144 - 00:42:55.516, Speaker A: Right hat, maybe. Very careful here. This is, yeah, white hat. F of the hat. Yes. So that's exactly what is claimed. Okay, so we are done with probably the main estimate of the derivative.
00:42:55.516 - 00:44:00.144, Speaker A: Now, we still a bit away from our key estimate, which was used in the previous part. And so let me remind you what it was. If b is between zero and one plus four over kappa, and a is a specific function of b, and lambda is also this very specific function of b, then you can find some constant such that probability that the derivative of ft prime is bigger than delta over y would be bounded by this construct where this is your function. Okay, so let's prove it. First of all, of course, I assume that delta is bigger than y. Otherwise right hand side is simply bigger equals than some constant. And just remember, this is probability.
00:44:00.144 - 00:44:52.076, Speaker A: So probability is bounded. So we can just take c of k, beta, anything which is bigger than zero, bigger than one, and it would work. And now let's see that the derivative of this again becomes shifting. It has the same distribution. That's why we use it as gt g minus t prime. And remember that um, that would be log of g minus t of x plus y. So this denote by u one.
00:44:52.076 - 00:45:42.984, Speaker A: So this is again t is fixed. This would be log of this. This is the time change. Okay, now let's write the derivative of log of gt prime in u coordinates. And again, this is an easy computation, again, that this is just real part of gt minus psi t squared divided by absolute value of the same thing. So it's less or equal than one. So the derivative doesn't change much when you change.
00:45:42.984 - 00:47:01.894, Speaker A: Well, so the derivative is now bigger than one of the logarithm. So if you take any um, derivative here, divided by derivative here, well you take logarithm and you know that derivative with respect to u is at least one, at most one. So you have this bound that when the time changes, when the u changes. So at the time t u was u one. So it's bounded by exponent of u minus u one. So what do we know? Probability that u are bigger than delta over y is bounded by the sum of probabilities where g at some integer times bigger than delta over y. Because again, you have this bound.
00:47:01.894 - 00:48:46.154, Speaker A: And let me just note that here I added up to a constant, but they absolutely independent on y and t. So because you won, which is episode five, it's bounded by some c one for some universal c one. And this means that you can estimate hyperbolic rather half plane capacity of g t. Okay, so again, to estimate this probability, I would instead estimate the probabilities, the sum of probabilities that these guys are at least delta over y. Again, because I don't want to deal with fixed t here, I want to deal with the time when u is equal to some value of j. Now notice that simply by Schwarz lemma, since g is the map from h to h y, g prime of z is bounded by imaginary part of geology. This is gesture's lemma.
00:48:46.154 - 00:50:48.044, Speaker A: So probability that u are bigger than delta y. Again, let's continue. This is bounded as the sum of probabilities that they bigger than Delphi y. And here you again, for when your imaginary part is very small, you just well, this is already smaller. So you can start not at log of absolute value of phi, but at much smaller value of log of delta, because otherwise, just by this estimate, this wouldn't happen. Now, we can just use scale invariance to show that if j is between log y and zero, then expectation of this is bounded by this f from the theorem at the point e to the minus e to the minus jz. Okay, so, okay, I am running out of time, but, okay, let me finish this calculation when we reconvene in nine minutes.
00:50:48.044 - 00:50:51.064, Speaker A: Okay, so let me stop recording for now.
