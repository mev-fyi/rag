00:00:00.560 - 00:00:01.140, Speaker A: Begin.
00:00:03.334 - 00:00:25.378, Speaker B: So today, this week is BMO week. So we're going to have, we're going to start our lecture series on BMO with a mini course offered by Danielle Guerrella from Spain. Anyway, so Danielle, okay, thank you very much.
00:00:25.526 - 00:01:17.584, Speaker A: Well, let me start thanking Javada or in general, the organizer of this program for organizing this so nice program and for giving me the opportunity to participate in it. Well, I'm going to speak on BMO, but essentially, since we are in this program, it's analytic functional space. I'm going to speak about analytic VMO, BMO. So, well, Vm module, know what a VMO function is? VMO functions actually have its origin in the setting of rn. If we have a. What was the problem here? It's not moving now. It was moving before.
00:01:20.244 - 00:01:22.486, Speaker B: It's not moving now.
00:01:22.550 - 00:01:24.794, Speaker A: So, no, it's not moving now.
00:01:29.054 - 00:01:29.542, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:01:29.558 - 00:02:25.954, Speaker A: As you know, if we have a function in l, one log of rn and we have a q in rn, then we can take the mean of f over q. So we take the integral of f and we divide by the measure of the q and this is the mean of f over the cube q. And then we can consider the mean over q of the difference between f and the mean of f of f with absolute value. So this quantity that we have over here is the mean oscillation or the function f over the cube cube. Then we are going to, we say that f is a bmo of rn. Say that BMO transform boundary mean oscillation, this oscillation are bounded, are uniformly bounded. So f is in BMO.
00:02:25.954 - 00:03:23.824, Speaker A: If the supreme of these quantities over all cubes is fine. Well, if we start with the definition, then we can think that there is no relation at all between these analytic functions. Let's say in the disk, which is what we have been working over the weeks since this program start. But anyway, we are going to see that VMO are very, very closely related to analytic function in the disk. And so we are, of course, we will work in one dimension. Let's see, one of the first concepts that was given in this program, program was on hard spaces. And let's say that probably two of the most important results in the theory of hardy space are the Henry's conjugation theorems and the duality theory.
00:03:23.824 - 00:04:30.414, Speaker A: Well, the, you all know what the conjugation theorem says. That is that if we have an index between one and infinity extremely bigger than one and extremely smaller than infinity, then the conjugation operator f into f tilde, f tilde is the conjugate function of f is bounded on lp of tt denotes the the unit circle. The unit circle. Well, I have written this in terms of function defined in the circle, but we can also write it in terms of harmonic function in the, in the list, little hp is the hardest space of harmonic function. So is the space of harmonic function in the disk, so that the integrals mean of order p over this circle of radius r as boundary. So the enriched conjugation theorem can be written in terms of harmonic function. So it says that the conjugation operator that sends a function u into its conjugate is bounded on hp for p between one and infinity.
00:04:30.414 - 00:05:03.514, Speaker A: Well, as I have said, this result is true between one and infinity. It is well known that this is of truth for p one. For p one we have some weak type inequality. But anyway, I'm not going to speak about p one. I'm going to be interested in p equal infinity. The result is not true for p equal infinity. In fact, we have that if a function is in h infinity, it may not, the conjugate function may not belong to h infinity.
00:05:03.514 - 00:06:02.306, Speaker A: There are functions which are analytic in the list, so that the real part of f is bounded, but the imaginary part is unbounded. I guess that the most important example is I times log of one plus z over one minus z. The function these functions sends the unit disk into a vertical, into a vertical strip. So we have the unit disk, and if we apply this function on f, this goes to a vertical strip. So, so we have that the real of f is bounded by the imaginary part. So the end risk conjugation theorem is not true for p equal infinity. Of course, since h infinity, the boundary harmonic function adding a in little hp.
00:06:02.306 - 00:06:57.956, Speaker A: If we use the risk conjugation theorem, the risk theorem, what we have is that, is that if f is in h infinity, well, here I should say l infinity. This is in a rata. If f is in l infinity, then f Tilde is in lp for all, p for all finite. But actually it's a classical result. Actually, I, I don't know exactly to whom it is due for study. It appears in Sigmund's book on trigonometric series that if f is in L infinity, then we have the conjugate function satisfies exponential integrability. If we have a function in l infinity, then there is a constant alpha, but actually depends only on the l infinity norm of l f positive constant, so that the integral of exponential alpha tilde is fine.
00:06:57.956 - 00:08:12.102, Speaker A: So this is of course the result which is stronger than this one that if f is in L infinity, then f Tilde. So this is what is known a classical result that are known for the conjugation operator acting on l infinity. The other result that I said that was quite important in the theory of Hardy spaces was the duality theory that you all know. The duality theorem for harder space. Also when p is between one and infinity, it says that if p is with one and infinity, then the dual of hp is isomorphic to sq, where q is the conjugate exponent to actually the the isometric isomer phase is given in this way. If we have g and h cubes, so d is phi, sub g of f defines it this way. The integral of f times dt g in g bar defines a bounded linear operators in hp, which has the same note at the front.
00:08:12.102 - 00:08:59.993, Speaker A: So this is the classical duality theorem in Sp, which is the analog to the one for lp spaces. Actually, one uses the duality theorem for lp spaces. One uses the Hambana theory and Cesar data one gastro. So these are two very important results that are true for p between one and infinity. And as I say, the first result is not the first result regarding the conjugate function cannot be extended to p. And about this is also true that the dual of h one cannot be identified with h infinity. And we will try to solve to obtain the substitute of these two theorems for p equal infinity.
00:08:59.993 - 00:10:18.732, Speaker A: Bmo shows up in solving these two questions as science. This is what just was BMO function show up in the theory of analytic function showing in connection with the substitute of the above two theorems, the risk conjugation theorem at the theory about the duality of hp when we go to people infinity. Actually, as I said before, BMO functions show up in the context of function defined in rn. L1 lock function in rn. They were introduced by Johanna Niremberg in 1961 and they applied results that they obtained to a smoothness problem in partial differential equations. So actually, to start with this, modifying the setting of rn and to start with this has no relation at all with analytic function spaces, even in the one dimensional case. However, in the middle of the 1960s, Spang and Stein independently proved that there is a close connection between BMO function and the conjugation apparatus working in one dimension.
00:10:18.732 - 00:11:04.424, Speaker A: I will define this properly in a minute. If we have a function in l infinity of this the circle, then the conjugate function f tilde is is going to have boundary. Meanwhile, so regarding the duality of hp, sometimes later, Pfefferman showed that the dual of h. One can be identified with what we are going to call BMOA, analytic BMO. So this is. We are going to try to see this two things in some details. But just to start, I just mentioned these two results, which are the basic of the, of the connection of VMO function and analytic function.
00:11:04.424 - 00:12:00.198, Speaker A: Well then, well, before we get into, let us give some general reference about the BMO function. The first one is a paper by Alvestein. Alvestein was my advisor, my thesis advisor, and I'm very much indebted to him. I led a lot from him, and he wrote a very nice paper on analytic function on both the mean constellation, which was published in 1980. Then, of course, Garnet pool compounded analytic function is a very good reference for a lot of facts having to do with analytic function, and in particular having to do with PMF function. Of course, we have this very nice book by Sarasohn. Function theory on the unit circle was published in 1978.
00:12:00.198 - 00:12:49.282, Speaker A: And then some like 20 years ago, I wrote a. I participate in, I think it was a summer school in, in Finland. And then I gave a course on boundary mean oscillation. And then I wrote a long paper, more than 100 pages, on analytic function on bundle minus. So these are, let's say four general reference on bmo, a essentially analytic bmo. Of course, I know in this course I'm going to give some result, I'm going to give some proofs, but of course, I cannot prove everything. But most of the things can be found in this paper.
00:12:49.282 - 00:13:22.950, Speaker A: In particular, I guess that maybe I can upload this paper later on, so that everybody can have. Many of the things that I'm going to talk about are included in here, and some of the proofs can be found there, even if I know. So I will upload this maybe in the chat. So these are reference. And then let's see. Let's start a little bit. So, we are going to work, actually, in function defining the unit set.
00:13:22.950 - 00:13:49.470, Speaker A: So the definition is just the one, similar to the one that I gave before. For a function defined in l one of I, we have a function which is in l, one of t. Here we. We don't have to say l one log, because we are working in the compact case. So you have a function in l, one of the circle, and I is an interval. We consider n I of f, the mean of f over the interval I. So.
00:13:49.470 - 00:14:52.494, Speaker A: So this I bar I. This means that the length of the integral, so n I of f is the mean of f of the integral. Then we consider the mean oscillation of f over the interval I, which is the mean of the difference of the difference or the absolute value of the difference between f and the mean of f of x. So this is the mean oscillation of f over I say, then we say that f is a function of bounded mean oscillation in the circle, or that f is in bmo of the circle. If the supreme of these quantities is fine, if the supreme as I ranges over all or intellij. So we are going to call d supreme is going to call, we are going to call it f double star norm of a one over the length of I integral of I of the absolute value of f minus the mean of f of. Okay, this is the definition that we have of Bmo.
00:14:52.494 - 00:15:34.276, Speaker A: As I said, we are going to work in the, in the unit circle. Of course, this is a semi norm, actually a constant function or constant function for all constant function. This is zero. If we want. Sometimes this is defined in the setting of rn then actually. But since here we are working in the compact case, so we can define quickly and order. So if we add the integral over the whole interval, over the whole circle of f, then in this way we get a real north on f.
00:15:34.276 - 00:16:26.604, Speaker A: So what we are going to call the Bmo north of s is going to be the f star, which is the supreme oscillation plus the absolute value of the mean of f over the four interval. Well, it is not difficult to see that actually this is a nor and that BMo with this is a vana space. And also it is completely clear that l infinity is contained in BMO. And we have this. Actually, it's important to know that the inclusion, that the inclusion, this inclusion is the typical example of a function which is in Bmo, but it's not in l infinity, it's the log. We have the log of absolute value of t when t is between zero and PI. In absolute value, this function is in the.
00:16:26.604 - 00:17:50.406, Speaker A: This is an easy calculation, taking the oscillation and so on. So this is the typical example of vm function, which is not. Well, probably the most important result that Jon Nierenberg proved when they introduced bmo is what is usually called the John Niremberg. The John Nierenberg theorem establish exponential inequality on the distribution function of f of actually of f minus of the oscillation of f. So the Johnny Reinvest theorem said that there exists two positive constant k and beta such that if we have a bmo function and we have an interval, then if we take the set of the interval where the difference between f and the mean of f over I in absolute value is bigger than lambda and we divide by the length of I, then, since it's bounded by this constant ke to the minus beta lambda over f star, and this is for every lambda positive. This is, as I said, I'm not going to get into the proof of the result. This is, let's say the classical, what is usually called the John Nielenberg theorem.
00:17:50.406 - 00:19:03.144, Speaker A: I guess it was the main theorem that they proved in the paper where they introduced Bmo. But let's see, this implies that the function in BMo satisfies an integrability condition. And in particular, if we use the John Niremberg theorem and the expression on the lp zero in terms of the distribution function, the well known, this is the usual well known expression of del p naught of a function in terms of the distribution function. And this is true in any measured space. You would take the integral of absolute value of h to the p is p times the integral of lambda p minus one times. Here we have the distribution function of the absolute value of h. Then if one uses the John Niremberg theorem and uses this one only sort, then one of them redeled that if we have a function which is in Bmo, then actually we can obtain an expression which is equivalent.
00:19:03.144 - 00:19:39.328, Speaker A: Which is equivalent, which I guess, which I guess that there is some problem. The problem is that I guess that I miss things. A transparency. The transparency is that we can put here instead of the l one, we can put here supremo over p. I guess there was some. Then we define this, instead of taking the one norm, we take the lp norm of f minus the n I of f. And then we take this, and then this is what we are going to call f star p of f.
00:19:39.328 - 00:20:44.404, Speaker A: And actually, as I said, using the John Niremberg theorem and this expression of the lp naught in terms of the distribution function, what we get is that this is equivalent to what we call f star. F star was taking here p equal to. So this is in particular, in particular distillers that actually BMO function are in all Elp spaces, are in all p spaces, and all these norms are equivalent. This is the norm with p equal to one. And then this is when we take lp. So actually this, well, I have written here for p bigger than one, but actually we can write this even for p bigger than six. But anyway, since we want to work with not let us restrict to p bigger.
00:20:44.404 - 00:21:40.934, Speaker A: Okay, so the thing is, this is the main consequence of the that we can take not only l one north, but we can take lp north for NEp possibly. And then we have an equivalent definition for Nep bigger. Okay, so this, but so far, so far we, we see no relation of this with, with analytic function space. Let's see that there is some and relation. And actually, to start with, let's see what I going to say that we can see Bmo as a conformal invariant. What we do is the following. When we took the f star norm, what we did here was we took the f and here we subtracted the mean of f over the interval I and then we divided by that.
00:21:40.934 - 00:22:17.736, Speaker A: But then we are going to change this again. We are going to define a new quantity which is going to be f two star. And what we do is the following. We take f, we take u, the Poisson integral of f, and then we evaluate that Poisson integral in a point a of the disc. And then we take the Poisson integral of this different center. And then we define. We can do this for p one, and we can do this also for any value of p, we take f.
00:22:17.736 - 00:23:12.876, Speaker A: We take the Poisson integral at a point a, and when we take, and then it turns out that this quantity is equivalent to f star. Let's see, more or less, what is the idea? The idea, I'm not going, of course, to prove this, to prove this one using some Calderon Simon ideas. But let me see, more or less, what is the idea I took? I have here some small things. So we have here the unit circle. Here we have an interval I. Then let's take here this point a is going to to be a point which is in the radius which ends in the center of the interval I. And so that the distance from a to this point is equivalent to the length of I, then this is going to be the point a.
00:23:12.876 - 00:24:38.560, Speaker A: So more or less, what happens is that the mean of I, the mean of f, sorry, the mean of f over the interval I, more or less can be thought equivalent to the u of a, where u is the Poisson integral of. And also, if we take f minus the, that means we are saying that more or less we substitute, we can substitute this means by u of a. And then the other thing is that if we take the, the mean of f minus u of a over the interval, more or less can be substituted by the integral in t. Instead of taking here the mean of this, what we take is the Poisson integral. You recall that the Poisson integral is an approximation or the identity that if we take the Poisson, the Poisson kernel here is essentially concentrated here at this point. So the idea is that we can substitute this like this. But of course, I, I'm not going to give the details of the proof, but let's, okay, but this is the, I guess this is the key fact that relates bmo function with harmonic or analytic function that we can define Bmo in an equivalent way, saying that a function f is in bmo.
00:24:38.560 - 00:25:15.432, Speaker A: If the supreme of these quantities as a ranges over the unit. This is fine. Here. As I recall, u is the Poisson integral of f. And here what we take is the Poisson integral of this evaluator. So what, what we have is that, that the f star north of f is equivalent to the f two star, which is taking this for p equal one. But since we said that this was equivalent to the f star p, so in a similar way this is equivalent to, so all these, actually these are states.
00:25:15.432 - 00:26:03.032, Speaker A: I might not because I have not added the mean effect. So these quantities are equivalent for any p between one and actually even for p between zero and one. But I'm always writing this for p bigger. So this is the way that harmonic function, or of course analytic functions show up in connection with p. We take the Poisson integral of f and then we have this. And I said here that we can see Bmo as a conformal invariant space. Let's see, what do I mean by that? Well, let us consider the group of four conformal mappings of the unit dis into itself.
00:26:03.032 - 00:27:17.146, Speaker A: Well, you will know that this group is the set of Mavis transformation of the distinct set. And this may transformation are all of the four lambda times phi of a, where lambda has absolute value of one and a is a point in the distance. The phi a of c is this maybe transformation which sends zero to a maybe transformation or the d s in. If we just write a user make a change of variables, then it is immediate that if we have a function in l one and we take a formal mapping of the disk into itself, then the composition s composed with f is also in l one and using a change of variable one of tens, very easily using the Poisson and variable, or thinking of what this is, this is a harmonic function. We have these boundary values and this is the same harmonic values, they will say. So we don't need to use ms change of value. Just look at this, that this is a harmonic and these are two harmonic functions with the same boundary value.
00:27:17.146 - 00:28:22.864, Speaker A: So they should be the same. But anyway, so we have this and also it can be proved, and it's just a simple calculus that if we have any point in the list s of cosine automorphic and we take b, the inverse image of a, then if we take one over two PI, the integral of f minus, the Poisson integral of f evaluated a, and we take here the Poisson integral, this is the same as this. So this is just a matter of making a calculation. So if we take here the supreme in this quantity, in this first integral, the supreme overall a's in the, in the, this is the second of the supremo here over all b's in the this. So in this way, what we get is that the seminar is conformally invariant. If we take, if I take the double star pin norm of f is the same as the double star p north of s composite proof. So, all right.
00:28:22.864 - 00:29:30.560, Speaker A: And so what we have at the end is that this double star p, the norm of f, is the supreme of the hp. This is the nor in the harmonic hp space of u composed with f minus u of f. But we can forget about the lambda in the rotation. We can forget about that rotation. And usually the way that this is written is that the supremum over all points a and d of the phi a of composite minus the value of v of a, where u is the Poisson integral. So we have, at the end, we have this expression for the bm owner of a function f, and we can take this for any p between. So a function f in l, one of t is in Bmo, even only for any piece positive, the supreme of this hp norm of the composition of u with all the phi's.
00:29:30.560 - 00:30:49.198, Speaker A: And we subtract the value of u of a is finite, where u is equals integral. So in this way we see is the, this way we see, we can see the BMO space as a conformal invariant space. So with this, you see that the analytic function harmonic function show up clearly in the context in relation with vm. Let's see how this result, this characterization in this conformally invariant way, give us quickly the first result that I mentioned, that if f is a function in L infinity, then the conjugate function is in beta. Well, this is nothing more or less. We take a function f in L infinity, we take real and we take the Poisson integral of f. Of course, if we use the, since we know that this theorem, if you was in L infinity, you using all lp spaces for p less than infinity, and so the conjugate function is in lp, then since the conjugate is in lp, then the conjugate function of u.
00:30:49.198 - 00:31:42.694, Speaker A: The u tilde is the Poisson integral of f Tilde. And now the only thing that we have to do is to use the conformally invariant characterization of vmo. Of course, if I take u, which is harmonia, I compose this with s and I take the conjugate. This is the same as the composition of s with the conjugate of. Since the conjugate function at zero zero, then I have to subtract here. So we have this and then using, then the only thing we have to do is to use Horden inequality and use the parser theorem that the conjugation operator is one, that the owner two. So then we deduce easily that, well, this f double star, we use the characterization which is the supreme of this h one norm of this.
00:31:42.694 - 00:32:36.004, Speaker A: But since this is zero, we can forget this. So this is the supreme of this, because this is zero. And then here I simply use that the h one naught is smaller than the h two naught. And here I use the, and here I use the Parseval theory that the conjugation operator is an isometry in h two. And of course, the h two node is smaller than the h infinity node. So we go from this to this and, but the supreme, the h infinity nord of u of this composition is just a h in del infinity norm of u, which is del infinite nord. So in this way we get quickly that if f is a function in an infinity, then the conjugate function is in Bmo.
00:32:36.004 - 00:33:34.912, Speaker A: And of course, we get this inequality with the f two star, the f two star north of f tilde is bounded by the l infinity naught. Well, this is, this was, so this give answer to the first of the two theorems that I said that were known for p less than infinity, but didn't remain true for p. Well, anyway, let's see that if we essentially use the same argument. But here we, here I started with f two with h one. Here, if we start here with h two with a similar argument, then we can prove that if f actually is in Bmo, then also is true that f tilde is in Bmo. And we have this in a problem. Actually, it's an argument similar to the one that I have used before for h infinity.
00:33:34.912 - 00:34:25.060, Speaker A: But the only difference is that here we start with h two directly and then we come. So we have that the conjugation operator is one from l infinity into Bmo, and even if from BMO into bmo. So this gives, this solves more or less the first of the two questions that I said that were left open for l infinity. Well, but before we get into that, the second part. Well, I said that the second, the second question had to do with, with the dual of h one. So I guess that we need to get into analytic bmo. So we are going to consider now the space that we are going to call BMoA.
00:34:25.060 - 00:35:03.363, Speaker A: So, analytic BMO, analytic boundary being oscillation. So BMOA is going to be the space of the function f, which are analytics. So we want them to be analytic. And in this, and are the person integral of a function which is in BMO. Well, of course, this is equivalent to say that BMoA is the space of those functions which belong to the hardest space h one. And so the boundary value function, the function which to every a theta changes to the boundary value. I said that this is an almost everywhere defined function, so that this function is in the.
00:35:03.363 - 00:35:45.372, Speaker A: So vmoa, analytic vmoa is a subspace of h. And of course we have the, having in mind the norm that we defined before for vmo. Actually, I'm going to work with the conformal invariant characterization if we take a function in Bmoa. So, the nord that we defined before was the mean of, of the function f over the circle. But the mean of the function of this function of the boundary values is the value of f of c. So, and then here we take, we take this. So this is the definition of the p bmo, not of.
00:35:45.372 - 00:36:44.124, Speaker A: So bmo is the spiral, the function f in h one, so that the boundary values are in bmo and these are not for p bigger than than one are not which are equivalent notes in the space b and o. Let me see here we have, looking at this. Since this is true for any, this has to be the supreme is finite for nep bigger than zero. So in particular, we have that Bmo is contained in hp for all p for all finite p, and of course h infinity. Since we said in the beginning that l infinity was contained in Bmo. Of course h infinity is contained in Bmo. And of course the inclusion is strict.
00:36:44.124 - 00:37:31.558, Speaker A: The example that we had before was the function log of absolute value of t. So we have this example. So, the function f equals log of one omega over one minus z is a function which is in bmo minus infinity. This can be seen well, taking into account that the log of t. Well, the boundary values are essentially, these are like log of t. But if you prefer, you can see that this function has the imaginary part of this function is founded. So if we use the result that we have the previous result, then we immediately get that dysfunction is in bmo because the imaginary part is founded, then the function has to be in.
00:37:31.558 - 00:38:19.986, Speaker A: So this is a typical example of Bmo, or a Bmo function which is not linear. So we have a space which is between h infinity and all hp spaces for p smaller. But there is some space which show up, which is a quite important space. I guess the block space, I think it was. No, I think it was considered, for instance, in the course of Birmingham spaces. You recall that, for instance, it was proved that the dual of the a one, both the block space and so on. So the block function show what in many contexts in analytic functional space.
00:38:19.986 - 00:38:59.534, Speaker A: And you know that well, you know the definition of a block function. An analytic function in the this is a block function is the supreme of this of f prime of z absolute value times the distance from set to the boundary is bound. The special orbital function is called the block space. If we add f of zero, then we have actually a model. This is of course a Banach space. And I said this space was considered in the course in Berman spaces. And it was proved that it is the dual of the Berman space, a one.
00:38:59.534 - 00:39:59.018, Speaker A: Well, let me see something very simple. If we use the Cochise formula for the derivative we obtain, we have that if we have any function f in h one, then we simply use cosis formula for derivative. We have this equality, and then this is. Then you write this in terms of parameterization, and so on, that you immediately get that this is smaller than the h one naught of n. So for any function f in h one, we have that f prime of zero absolute value is bounded by the h one null of fucking. If we take a function f which is in Bmo, and we apply this not to f, but to this function phi a composed with f minus f of a. So, we take a function f in Bmoa and we apply this inequality, this inequality just to this function.
00:39:59.018 - 00:40:34.720, Speaker A: Then we immediately get this. So what do we have here? So what have we obtained? We have obtained that we have a function f in Bmoa. Then the supreme of these quantities is bounded as a ranges over the disk. So what we get is that if f is in Bmoa, then f is a blockface. So what we guess is Bmoa is contained in the block in the block space. And actually we have this inequality of the naught. The supreme of these quantities is bounded by this.
00:40:34.720 - 00:41:26.036, Speaker A: So the block north or the block north of f is bounded by the bm a one north of. So we have when of course for, for block function, this, this, this inequality is trivial because f prime of z is big o of one over one minus z. Then from that integrating, we get this inequality. This inequality is true for block function. And then of course it's true for vm offense. Of course this estimate is sharp because we have seen that the function log of one over one minus z is a BMF. So this estimate that we obtain simply because a BMO function, sorry, is a block function.
00:41:26.036 - 00:42:20.794, Speaker A: Actually, this inequality is just taking that function log of one over one minus. Okay, well, the inclusion, we have said that BMo is contained in the block space. The inclusion is a strict problem. For instance, you all know well that this function, this function, the sum of c to the two to the k, is a block function. In general, this is function which is given by Haram Mercedes. And for block function, it is quite easy to prove that the Taylor coefficient of a block function rb one. But if you consider a power series of calamar with halamar gaps, then a power series with halamar gaps is a block function if and only if the these Taylor coefficients are rounded.
00:42:20.794 - 00:43:03.206, Speaker A: So in particular, this function, this function given by this power cider with Hanamari gaps, is a block function. But of course this is not this function. This cannot belong to BMO. Why? Why? Well, we can see this in many ways. One way is that what you know, that this function is not does not have radial finite radial limit at any point of the wonder if you are familiar with the theory of power stereo with Halamar gap. So this function is not in any of the hardest pages. And since we know that BMO is containing in all the hardest spaces, php for p is more than one that we have.
00:43:03.206 - 00:43:51.408, Speaker A: But anyway, we can see if you are not so familiar with the theory of mercedes, then this dysfunction is not in h two, because the sum of the absolute value of the coefficient squared is infinity. It's not in h two, but Bmo is containing in h two. So it's trivial that this function is a block function, but it's not in the. So something which is not so simple is this is the following, that actually there is a block function. There is a block function f, which lies in all the hardest spaces hp with p, but is not in Bm. This is not so easy to prove. I'm not going to give the detail.
00:43:51.408 - 00:44:53.966, Speaker A: Let me see that. I think that it was first proved by Campbell, Zima and Stevenson in 1980. And to prove this result they used a system of a certain universal cover in math and a property with an stability property of BMo. This stability property of BMo says that if we have a non constant inner function I then, and the function I composed with h is in vm, then h is in vm. Then using this result and any universal covering math can be were able to prove that. Then excise a block function with adding all the hardest places, hp with p less and an infinitive and not infinity. This, as I said, this was proved by canvas similar, but later on Holland Antoinette gave another proof and they use a result of fermat on the tailored coefficient of innovation.
00:44:53.966 - 00:45:48.988, Speaker A: I will speak about this result of fever later on, but let me see that there is another proof of the result which is using Taylor coefficient and a theory of Taylor coefficient. I would say that probably is a more explicit example because this was given, it gives you a certain coefficient and so on. But I will speak a little bit about this theorem that I mentioned here later, but actually even stronger than this. And this was proved by one. And actually the result is the following. There is a block expansion which is not in vmo and so that f prime is in hp for all p smaller than one. This is always stronger than this, because if f prime is in hp for all p smaller than one, then f is in hp for all p smaller than infinity.
00:45:48.988 - 00:46:50.706, Speaker A: So this is what actually is two stronger than this than the one that I have written. But anyway, I'm not going to give details of this. They can found in this in the paper that I mentioned before. And anyway I will try, if I will write a manuscript for the proceedings and then I will try to give some ideas on some of the result that I. Okay, and the second, the second, the second main result on Hardy spaces that I mentioned, what was true for p less than infinity, but was not true for people infinity was the duality. The duality says that the duality theorem for Hardy spaces that the dual of phase p is h p prime hq where p prime of q is the conjugate exponential p. And this is true for p between one and infinity.
00:46:50.706 - 00:47:37.322, Speaker A: And as I said, the result does not remain true for p equal to one. The substitute was proved by Fefferman. This is what we call the Fefferman duality theorem essentially says that the dual of h one is bmoa, so it can be identified with BmoA and it's not going to be an isometric identification in the same. In the dual of Hp is Hq and we have an isometric identification this is not. But, but let me see this. This is a precise statement. If we have a function in bmo, then we take a function g in h one.
00:47:37.322 - 00:48:07.106, Speaker A: Then this limit, we integrate fei theta times g of rei theta, and we take the limit as r tends to one. This limit exists. This is the fact. And then also, if we have a function f in h one, and we define t sub f in this way. For any function g in h one, we define t sub f of g equal to this limit that I have said in one that x is. So we define this as a limit. This, the.
00:48:07.106 - 00:48:45.222, Speaker A: Then this t sub f is a bounded linear functional in h one. And actually, the note of tf, we cannot say that is the same as the beam or not of f. But we can say that there are two constants that the norm of tf is bigger than c one times the bm of f and smaller than the other constant. Then they be more normal. And the garbage is true. If we have any t, any t in the dual of h one, then this t is one of these. Then I guess it's time.
00:48:45.222 - 00:49:02.974, Speaker A: No, it's time to stop. So I will stop here. This is the statement, the precise statement of the Fefferman's validity theorem. And then we will try to get tomorrow into some idea of how we get. So I guess that I will stop now.
00:49:06.354 - 00:49:06.946, Speaker B: Okay.
00:49:07.010 - 00:49:07.614, Speaker A: So.
00:49:10.114 - 00:49:54.824, Speaker B: All right, so I'll manage questions here. So either shout them out or post them in the chat. And I guess, Danielle, you'll with me, keep an eye on the chat. All right, Danielle, you know, there are these theorems by piccurides that talk about the best constants and things. So you had a lot of equivalent norms on BMO. Are there theorems like that which give you the best constant?
00:49:56.604 - 00:50:08.180, Speaker A: The best constant on. The best constant on what? On the. On the conjugate.
00:50:08.212 - 00:50:13.660, Speaker B: Well, you have like f star and f double star and then f. Well.
00:50:13.692 - 00:50:31.944, Speaker A: Yeah, there are some resolve like this. There are a lot of. Of result about computing the VM monitor or distinct function and so on. And that sounds a result of this kind.
00:50:32.324 - 00:50:40.744, Speaker B: Okay. And let's see a comment here. I guess you're going to post the slides in the chat and.
00:50:41.764 - 00:50:49.174, Speaker A: Well, I guess that I found some erratas, then I will correct them and posting maybe tomorrow. Okay.
00:50:49.594 - 00:50:50.290, Speaker B: Okay.
00:50:50.402 - 00:51:05.410, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, I guess maybe I will post. I'm not sure how to do it. I was trying to post the paper that I, that I mentioned, but I'm not sure if I will do tomorrow. Okay.
00:51:05.522 - 00:51:06.654, Speaker B: Okay. And that.
00:51:07.874 - 00:51:09.650, Speaker A: And then I will post it tomorrow.
00:51:09.722 - 00:51:15.854, Speaker B: And I guess the person to get with is Javad, who. Who's the master of all this.
00:51:16.994 - 00:51:22.374, Speaker A: Otherwise, I will send it to him, and then he will post it. Okay. Thank you.
00:51:23.194 - 00:51:29.694, Speaker B: All right, any other comments? Just shout them out. I can't keep track of any raised hands or anything.
00:51:31.634 - 00:52:11.636, Speaker C: Just a question, Daniel, about the duo allow HP, which is HQ, and a couple of times you mentioned it's isometric isomorphism between the two. I recall in Durin's book, he emphasizes that. Well, it is true that the dual is HQ, but it's not isometric, because just for p equal to two, but for other values, we have constant, which appears in Marcel Reese theorem. It's not isometric, but we have the constant. The same as the constant you mentioned in your last slide.
00:52:11.820 - 00:52:19.068, Speaker A: Yes, sure. Maybe. Maybe you are. Maybe I'm. I'm not sure. I guess. I guess you are right.
00:52:19.068 - 00:52:19.876, Speaker A: Okay.
00:52:20.060 - 00:52:26.144, Speaker C: I mean, this is. I mean, I have to double check with Durin's book, but this is something I vaguely remember.
00:52:26.884 - 00:52:53.420, Speaker A: No, but I was. I thought, yeah, I have Durin's book here. HP studies isometrical isomorphic. No, no, no, you are right. Isometrically isomorphic to the ecosystem space. And then if we go to HP, then we have a cost. So you are completely fine.
00:52:53.420 - 00:52:54.332, Speaker A: Okay.
00:52:54.468 - 00:52:55.252, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:52:55.388 - 00:53:01.084, Speaker B: So, Sandra, you look like you're trying to jump in with a question. Maybe not.
00:53:01.244 - 00:53:02.372, Speaker A: No, it's okay.
00:53:02.508 - 00:53:21.314, Speaker B: It has solved. All right, so last call for questions. Otherwise, let's thank Danielle again for a wonderful talk, and we look forward to tomorrow. Let's take a quick break.
