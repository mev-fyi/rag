00:00:00.400 - 00:00:03.606, Speaker A: Okay. Okay.
00:00:03.630 - 00:01:21.974, Speaker B: So, good morning for everyone. So today I'm going to continue this discussion about the problem of elimination of nil potent points for vector fields in dimension three. But before discussing the result, I would like to comment on some new example, which I find quite interesting, which shows us that, let's say this procedure has a lot of potential applications, even if you're only interested in dimension two problems. Yeah, so I recall to you that last time I commented on this example of vector fields in dimension three which don't have c infinity infinite center manifolds. So this is, let's say, some new phenomena that doesn't show up in dimension two. Well, there is a general result which shows that center manifolds are always ck for all k, finite k. Right? So, in fact, the phenomena here is that when you reduce the neighborhood of the origin, you increase more and more the degree of differentiability that you can attain.
00:01:21.974 - 00:02:20.720, Speaker B: But in some sense, it's always fine as long as you stay in some neighborhood of zero. Okay, so I'm not going to comment on this example anymore, but, so, I'd like to tell you about some new, let's say, application of this resolution of civil rights, which I found quite interesting. And it indeed has a lot of people which working on this right now, which is the so called geometric singular perturbation theory. So, I'm going to illustrate this by the case of the so called van DER Pohl's equation. So what's the phenomena? You consider this family of planar vector fields. So it depends on x and y variables, but the expression changes as we change these two parameters, epsilon and a. Right, sorry, there's, yeah, so there's a two parameter family of planar vector fields.
00:02:20.792 - 00:02:21.000, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:21.032 - 00:03:10.462, Speaker B: So it shows up, let's say it's a very classical model, which appears, for instance, in the modeling of the transistor, which is given by Paul and. Well, the novelty here is the appearance of this epsilon in front of the second equation, which has the following effect. So on the left hand side I've drawn, let's say the phase portrait for epsilon equals to zero. So for epsilon equals to zero, the second equation vanishes completely. So you only have this line of singularities, which is a cubic, which corresponds to the equation y equals to x squared over two plus x to the three over three.
00:03:10.518 - 00:03:10.686, Speaker A: Right?
00:03:10.710 - 00:03:29.550, Speaker B: So this is this cubic here and outside. So the cubic is completely formed by equilibrium points or similar points of the vector field. And outside you have this horizontal foliation, which is given simply by d over dx. So it's oriented on this way. So the foliation, let's say you go.
00:03:29.582 - 00:03:32.638, Speaker A: To the right when you are below.
00:03:32.686 - 00:03:45.020, Speaker B: The cubic, because d over dx is negative. And you go to the left when you are above the cubicle because y minus the equation of the cubic is positive.
00:03:45.092 - 00:03:45.300, Speaker A: Right?
00:03:45.332 - 00:04:51.934, Speaker B: So the interesting thing is that when you perturb the situation by making epsilon different from zero, then this equilibrium curve disappears. And in fact, there is only one single, one singular point which remains, which is situated at. Let's say you just take now the second equation and you put x equals two a, and then you represent the equation, there is this similar point which lies on the cubic. Right? And while it has been observed a long time ago that there is this, in general, there's a limit cycle. So it's an isolated periodic, periodic orbit which persists by this perturbation of hepcida, or more precisely, it appears by this perturbation. And then what is interesting is that the shape of this limit cycle, it depends very, very, in a very, very dedicated fashion on the parameter a, right? So there is two parameters, epsilon and a. And you can show that when you make epsilon goes to zero.
00:04:51.934 - 00:05:54.454, Speaker B: Depending on the choice of a, this limit cycle, it converts to different forms. So here I've drawn three different forms, and in fact, all of these forms, let's say the limit, the limit form of the limit cycle. More technically, it's called the limit periodic set. It can decide, let's say everything is decided in a very, very small, exponentially flat tongue. So this is the region of the form a equals to some, let's say some central curves, c zero, of epsilon plus some exponentially fret term here. So it's a very, very subtle phenomenon, which is, in fact, numerically it's quite difficult to detect. I make a different drawing here, where you see all possible shapes of the limit cycle when epsilon goes to zero, depending on the value of a.
00:05:54.454 - 00:06:53.864, Speaker B: So these are the so called canard limit cycles. So there is a very nice paper of Dumortier and roussary where they studied this phenomenon using the singularization in dimension three, or more precisely, in dimension four, because you have two parameters. So what do you do here? So, let's suppose that a equals to zero, just to simplify the computations. So you have this family, which I've written before with a equals zero. Now, and I want you to singularize this family. Why? Because, let just go back in this leftmost drawing here. Every point which appears on the cubic, every equilibrium point which appears on the cubic is an elementary point, because you have a no zero eigenvalue in the horizontal direction, except for these two red colored points here, which are nil potent.
00:06:53.864 - 00:07:46.544, Speaker B: So the idea, as you can see, is that there is some interesting phenomena which appears in the vicinity of this red points. And the idea is precise to dissimilarize this point by a weighted blow up. So I'm going to explain how to dissimilarize the point at the origin, let's say the rightmost tangency point. So, so, okay, so again, you force the expression, the periods of this logarithmic base here. And now you have to recall that you have an additional structure on the, on the, on the ambient space, which is the so called family structure, which says simply that your vector field is tangent to the vibration given by epsilon equals to constant, right? Because epsilon is just a parameter here.
00:07:48.594 - 00:07:49.614, Speaker A: Okay, so.
00:07:51.394 - 00:09:15.770, Speaker B: Now what you do is that you, in order to choose the weights you have to make, well, it's the same thing as drawing the Newton polyhedron in this case. But you can also look at this choice of weight as a sort of equilibrium equations, right? So you look at this first equation here, and you say that the weight of minus the weight of x plus the weight of y should be equal to the weight of x, right? So you want to calibrate these first two terms which appear here. I cannot, the third term you cannot put in equilibrium. And at the same time, the choice of the weight that you're going to choose for making an equilibrium between these two terms should also be the weight of this rightmost term which appears here. So the second equilibrium equation is this one, okay? So this is one of the choice, let's say, which don't have any common factor, weight of x equals to one is a linear system, right? So weight of y equals to two and weight of epsilon equals to two also. And now when I'm going to make the blow up with this weight, one, two and two. And now you have to think of this as the following thing.
00:09:15.770 - 00:10:23.936, Speaker B: Now you have an object in three dimensions which is tangent to the vibration epsilon equals to zero, right? And now I'm going to replace the point which is at the origin by a sphere, right? Because let's say, let's talk about the real blow up. So once we replace the point on the origin by a sphere, okay, you obtain this, right, this rightmost drawing here. And now what happens is that this cubic, the singular cubic, which, let's say, which appeared in the, before blowing up now, will accumulate in the, in the boundary of this, in the boundary of this, in the intersection of this sphere with the fiber, epsilon equals to zero. Okay, so this is the curve gamma that I noted here. Okay, so, well, I'm not going to enter in this computation, but I think it's perhaps a nice exercise to make them. So we use these two charts. So there is a chart which is, let's just go back here.
00:10:23.936 - 00:11:46.294, Speaker B: There is a chart which is in the direction of epsilon. So the direction which goes outside the screen, right? And one equipment also in the direction which is vertical, the y direction, which is the direction which goes vertically to the top. Okay? So in the epsilon direction, you get what people call usually the rescaling. So this is a classical transformation that you do in the singular perturbation, in the classical singular perturbation theory, which is so called the rescaling. So by this rescaling of variables, which is simply the blow up computed in the epsilon chart, you see that there is a sort of miracle which happens because recall that there is an epsilon multiplying the second component here, the component on x, d over the x, but it disappears. It appears precisely because after blowing up, you divide out everything by, by the highest power of epsilon that you can, you can factor out. So of course, the vibration in this case remains the same one given by the pullback of this equation, by, sorry, of this differential form by epsilon.
00:11:46.294 - 00:11:56.512, Speaker B: So this gives you the same equation. But in fact, this does not capture all the phenomena because I have to compute what happens in the other charts.
00:11:56.568 - 00:11:56.760, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:56.792 - 00:12:47.824, Speaker B: So let's just look at what happens in the second chart. There's a third chart also. But let's just give the vertical chart. So in this chart, you have these equations and the blow up, well, given by not making details, but the interest thing here is that the vibration now is no longer given by smooth fibers, because when you pull back this form, d epsilon, by replacing epsilon by y square epsilon, then you have this singular differential form here, which corresponds to, let's say, I'm going to make the drawing only on the epsilon chart. So you have the fiber given by y squared. Epsilon equals to zero, which is the unit of these two planes.
00:12:47.864 - 00:12:48.040, Speaker A: Right?
00:12:48.072 - 00:13:27.446, Speaker B: So the plane x equals to zero and the divisor, sorry, the plane given by epsilon equals to zero. And the plane given by y equals to zero, which is the divisor in this case. And now, well, in fact, these two bold lines here are exactly the. Sorry, I want to go back. There are exactly the strict transform of these two pieces of the cubic, which appears as straight lines. On the epsilon chart, on the white chart.
00:13:27.470 - 00:13:27.950, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:13:28.062 - 00:13:43.356, Speaker B: Yes, because with this blowing up, you straight, you make these two branches become straight lines. And then there is a new dynamics which appears inside this sphere.
00:13:43.420 - 00:13:43.620, Speaker A: Right?
00:13:43.652 - 00:13:51.412, Speaker B: So this is a new thing. And this is precisely the dynamics which is described by the rayskating chart.
00:13:51.548 - 00:13:52.100, Speaker A: Okay?
00:13:52.172 - 00:14:18.842, Speaker B: Which, as I said, there is no line of similarities here because the sino has disappeared. So in fact, what you do is that you, you compute them. Let's say. Now we have a three dimensional vector field here, as you can see by the image. But it respects some additional structure which is given by the vibration y square epsilon equals to constant.
00:14:19.018 - 00:14:19.734, Speaker A: Right?
00:14:20.874 - 00:15:28.724, Speaker B: So the two points now. So this is in our sense, this is a dissimilarization because all points now are elementary including the red colored points that I made, I've written here, I've drawn here because now they have also a non zero eigenvalue in the horizontal direction. Because in some sense by Boolean up you have eliminated this tangency between the cubic and the horizontal foliation given by d over dx one. So now there is Rousseau, Hindu, Mortier has interpreted. So there is a very classical tool that you use in the single perturbation theory which is the so called matching of asymptotic expansions. What people do is they fall. When you are in the regular part, the part which there is no potency, you have a very well behaved similar asymptotic expansion.
00:15:28.724 - 00:16:16.584, Speaker B: And then there is this rescaling map where you have some new asymptotic expansion. And what people do is that they say, well, you have to match these two asynthetic expansions by using the ray scaling map. What is the, let's say, the geometric interpretation of this? It's the following one. So you have these two red points and these points, in fact, they are, as I said, they are elementary points. But this point, they have one non zero eigenvalue in the horizontal direction, but in the y direction and the epsilon direction you have zero as an eigenvalue. So by this we mean that there is a, as before, there is a center manifold through these points.
00:16:17.244 - 00:16:18.144, Speaker A: Okay?
00:16:19.044 - 00:17:23.272, Speaker B: And this center manifold, in fact, there is a whole bunch of center manifolds because what you do is that you can obtain a whole family of center manifolds by saturating some curves which appear on the, let's say, when you look at things outside the section divisor. So here I've drawn one of these center manifolds. But let's say by this I have chosen one of the heights on the cubic. But if you go to another height here, you get another center manifold, which is, if you look at them on the red point, they have an exponentially flat contact between them. All these center manifolds, they have a flat contact between them on the red points. And this is precisely the reason why this phenomena happens in an exponential flat tongue that I've drawn in. You have this family of center manifolds.
00:17:23.272 - 00:17:48.864, Speaker B: And now how do you see the limit cycles? Now, you recall that you have the vibration. So if you look at the nearby vibration, which is given by y squared times epsilon positive but small. Right? What you see is that the intersection of this vibration with the center manifold gives you this curve.
00:17:49.444 - 00:17:49.852, Speaker A: Right?
00:17:49.908 - 00:18:11.004, Speaker B: And this is one of the limit cycles. So in fact, the idea is that by using blow up, you can reduce the study of this canard limit cycles to a problem of the study of, let's say, global, globally defined center manifolds for such kind of configuration.
00:18:13.544 - 00:18:14.112, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:14.208 - 00:18:25.684, Speaker B: So, well, this is a. I think there are a lot of people which is working on this subject right now. And now it's called geometric, geometric singular perturbation theory.
00:18:28.704 - 00:18:29.040, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:29.072 - 00:19:00.432, Speaker B: So let me just relate this to a problem which for me, it's quite interesting, because in some sense, it's even more irritating than the Hilbert 16 problem. You see that here. In fact, we have shown another sort of mechanism for the appearance of limit cycles, which is not the usual mechanism that we see when you study, for instance, dudex problem, where there is.
00:19:00.608 - 00:19:03.296, Speaker C: Excuse me, Daniel?
00:19:03.440 - 00:19:04.240, Speaker B: Yes?
00:19:04.432 - 00:19:06.944, Speaker C: Can you go back to the previous.
00:19:07.104 - 00:19:07.844, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:08.824 - 00:19:27.004, Speaker C: In this picture, it seems that the center money for the local center money for that one point, at one red point do not match with the other. It seems that they do not. They do not, are not gluing. It's actually.
00:19:27.504 - 00:19:52.496, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true. In fact, how do you construct this center manifolds? You take one curve, I don't know if you can see the point of my mouse here, but in fact, you can't take one transversal curve, which lies on some. On some height here, and then you saturate to the left by the positive flow and to the right by the negative flow.
00:19:52.640 - 00:19:53.364, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:54.104 - 00:20:15.574, Speaker B: Or there's. Or perhaps better, even better here, you can take a point on the exceptional divisor, a small straight line, let's say it's transverse, and then you saturate. But when you saturate by the flow positively and negatively, you end up above here with two curves which perhaps do not match.
00:20:16.754 - 00:20:17.090, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:17.122 - 00:20:25.434, Speaker B: So this is. So the idea that when they do not match, you don't have a closed curve.
00:20:25.594 - 00:20:27.930, Speaker C: Ah, that was the question. That was the question.
00:20:28.002 - 00:20:28.474, Speaker B: Because.
00:20:28.594 - 00:20:31.050, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:20:31.082 - 00:21:04.118, Speaker B: So, sorry. So then the. This is the role of the parameter a, because the parameter a, in fact, it has the role of moving these curves in such a way that they want to intersect transversely by changing the value of a. And this is the way to create the limit cycles. So, in fact, this is why, by changing. Sorry, I want to go back. By changing the value of a, the matching between the center manipules will happen in different heights.
00:21:04.118 - 00:21:06.154, Speaker B: And this is the canard phenomenon.
00:21:08.454 - 00:21:17.646, Speaker C: Okay, thank you. Yeah, I was interpreted that there were always limit cycle, but it's not true. It depends on the.
00:21:17.790 - 00:21:46.420, Speaker B: Yeah, no, there is always one, but it's shape. I mean, the height where this center manifolds intersect will depend on the parameter a. This. Okay, but it's. Yes, that's here. I've drawn a case where they match, and then you have this closed curve. So, yes, let's talk about this.
00:21:46.420 - 00:22:02.116, Speaker B: You're talking about this Hilbert's problem. So there is the Hilbert 16 problem, which the problem, of course, asking about the an uniform bound for the number of limit cycles for vector field, for polymer polynomial vector fields of a given degree.
00:22:02.260 - 00:22:02.564, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:02.604 - 00:23:15.478, Speaker B: So there is an easier problem, which is also, it's still very, very difficult, which is the so called duck problems, where you just fix one polynomial vector field and you ask about the finite cyclicity. Okay, well, so if you, if you fix one polynomial vector field of a given degree, of course, you have a whole bunch of different configurations which are possible, and then you have to first of all classify these configurations and already the finite. Then the finiteness of the number of limit cycles for a fixed polynomial vector field, it's a quite difficult problem. And then. And so, Ismail, in his list of problems for the 21st century, he simplified this problem and asked the following question. So you have a particular case of the family of polynomial vector fields of a given degree, which is the so called linear family, linear linear family, lineage, family. So it comes from this second order differential equation.
00:23:15.566 - 00:23:15.790, Speaker A: Right?
00:23:15.822 - 00:23:23.006, Speaker B: So it's perhaps the simplest second order differential equation that you can imagine, which is nonlinear. You just put a polynomial here.
00:23:23.190 - 00:23:23.654, Speaker A: So it's.
00:23:23.694 - 00:23:33.470, Speaker B: Sorry, it's a polynomial in t here. Sorry, I've made a mistake. No, no, it's. No, it's a predominant in x.
00:23:33.502 - 00:23:33.982, Speaker A: It's. Right.
00:23:34.038 - 00:24:27.828, Speaker B: Okay. And you can write the differential equation associated to this as a system in planar system of this form, y minus p of x d over dx minus x d over dy. Where a capital p is the, is a primitive of a small p, which vanishes on zero, right? So we, the problem asks, in the case where capital p is a polynomial of degree two, n minus one, okay, can you give an explicit bound for the number of limit cycles of this particular family, depending on n? Of course, because here, the only parameter now is just n. Well, in this case, if you take an individual element of this family, things are very simple.
00:24:27.916 - 00:24:28.188, Speaker A: Why?
00:24:28.236 - 00:25:18.184, Speaker B: Because for, in fact, this is the sort of face portrait in the case where you fix one polynomial vector field. So you have this. So this is the curve given by y equals to p. And then the vector field, it turns around like this. And for a radius sufficiently large, you can show by this condition here that everything goes inside, okay? So there is, you can say that the infinity is a repelling point, is a repelling point for this dynamics. So everything happens in a finite region. And moreover, there is a single singularity here, right? There are no other similarities except this one.
00:25:18.184 - 00:25:46.234, Speaker B: So, in fact, you can prove that a solution curve in this region, it has to turn around, right, at a similar point. And, in fact, there is a globally defined first return map, which I denoted by this, which. Well, in the, let's say, in the interesting cases, it's globally analytic.
00:25:47.294 - 00:25:47.950, Speaker A: Okay?
00:25:48.062 - 00:27:22.464, Speaker B: So I mean by in the, in a fine, in a finite region of the plane. So even in the origin, right, it can, you can extend this, this first return map to the origin as an analytic map, okay? So in this case, the finiteness of the number of limit cycles corresponds to the finites of the number of fixed points for isolated fixed points for t. And this, of course, is a trivial issue, because t is analytic, right? So for each polynomial p, the ponca reference for analytic. So, in this case, let's say that the analog of the dulac map is completely trivial because it's finite due to the analysis problem. But now the question remains as what happens when you consider all polynomials of a given degree? In the sense, you have to, you have to look in all, let's say, to the whole space of parameters. And in some sense, when you compactify the space of the parameters, which are nothing else than the coefficients of this polynomial p, what you find at the boundary by taking the parameters greater and greater are precisely the singular perturbation that I've drawn to you here. So, in fact, these similar perturbations, they appear at the boundary of the Leonard family.
00:27:22.464 - 00:27:29.644, Speaker B: So, with this, it's possible to give. There was an old conjecture.
00:27:29.724 - 00:27:29.964, Speaker A: Quite.
00:27:30.004 - 00:28:20.890, Speaker B: Let's say, look, it's quite old conjecture which said that the number of limit cycles should be bounded by n in this case. But we were able to give a counterexample by this precise, by studying the boundary and showing that when you look in the singular perturbation setting, you can have more than n starting from n equals to three. There is a counterexample to this conjecture. But as far as I know this conjecture is. So it's true for n equals to one, let's say for capital p of degree up to three it's true, but as far as I know it's open already for n equals to one. Uh, to one. Yes, for polynomial of degree five it's.
00:28:20.922 - 00:28:23.546, Speaker A: Uh, for n equals to two.
00:28:23.570 - 00:29:27.084, Speaker B: Yes, for n two it's, it's open as far as I know. And this is, let's say it's um, quite surprising because you see, you, you have a very simple equation and the face portrait, it's quite easy to understand. Okay, do you have any questions about this? No. Okay, so I'm going to now to enter on the subject of this, after this course it how to define this resolution of singularities for vector fields in dimension three. Right, so here I've made drawing of a polyhedron in dimension three. Now we are going to see how to choose this so called main phase and then to define a local resolution strategy. Okay, so now the settings.
00:29:27.084 - 00:30:37.208, Speaker B: The following have m three dimensional real identity manifold with corners. So e for us, which is the, let's say is the normal crossing divisor in our case will consist of the boundary of m. So the boundary of m now is two dimensional and it's given either by a plane, by two intersecting planes, or by three intersecting planes in, in normal crossing position. And now f is a singular fallation by curves which is tangent to e, to the boundary and such that, so this is an important condition. The locus of the nipotent points is of quad dimension greater or equal than two. Okay, so it means that in the code, in the recall that this hypothesis in the case of two dimensional foliations allowed us to consider only isolated points. But now it's inevitable to have curves of singularities.
00:30:37.208 - 00:31:47.884, Speaker B: So we have curves of nilpotent singularities, which eventually in our, let's say in our resolution algorithm should be taken as a center of blowing up at some point. Okay, so now the goal today is to explain to you how to define this invariant, the invariant that will decrease after each blowing up step. And you're going to see that it's a little bit subtle because due to the presence of points on the polyhedron, which have negative indices. So, to explain the environment, I'm going to place myself in the following typical situation, because in some sense, this is the situation that you can attain by some preparatory steps. And this is where the main difficulties lie on. I'm going to explain later on how to end up in this typical situation. So you have a germ, let's say m now is a germ of manifold, a neighborhood of the origin in three reals.
00:31:47.884 - 00:32:45.818, Speaker B: Let's suppose that the origin is an important point, and moreover, this is an important condition, is that the divisor is either given by x equals to zero or by x times y equals to zero. So, in particular, I'm not going to treat the case where we have three components of the boundary of our divisor intersecting at a point which is in the nilpotent locus. And the third condition, I'm going to explain to you how to obtain this condition, is that the vertical axis, so the axis which gives you by the intersection of the two, let's say the two components of the divisor, is not entirely contained in the nipotent locus. Okay, we're going to see why this condition shows up a little bit later. So, sorry, Danielle.
00:32:45.986 - 00:32:46.522, Speaker A: Yes.
00:32:46.618 - 00:33:24.934, Speaker B: So this condition you are imposing, this situation where the nippotone point is not in the intersection of three planes. Yes. I mean, it's a situation that you can reach after, in general, after some convenient transformations or. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, so if you start with a situation where your, your manifold m has no boundary, by which I mean e is empty, then I can prove that you are never going to attain a case where e has three components on an important point.
00:33:25.554 - 00:33:25.994, Speaker A: Okay?
00:33:26.034 - 00:34:11.364, Speaker B: Okay, so, but if you start a situation where the divisor exists, then you can in some sense eliminate this bad situation by some prepared to stop steps also. Okay, let's say this is why I call this a typical situation, because everything which is not in this situation can be obtained. Let's say we can eliminate by some easy preparatory steps. Okay, the core, the core of the, of the problem lies in this case. Okay, thank you. So you have this near potent polyhedron, which is associated to f, and of course, which depends on the choice of local coordinates. So I'm going to comment this a little bit later.
00:34:11.364 - 00:35:06.644, Speaker B: So let's suppose that we fix some coordinates, and then based on this chord, on this coordinates which are fixed, I'm going to define the invariant. So, first of all, there is the higher vertex of the polygon. Is the minimal vertex with respect to the lexicographical order in z three. So here we already see that there is the order of the coordinates will play an important role here. So we take the vertex of the polygon, which is the minimal one with respect to the lexicographical order in z three. I want to give an example. So by the both assumptions, this vertex h has necessarily this form, so its first component is zero.
00:35:08.304 - 00:35:08.808, Speaker A: Why?
00:35:08.896 - 00:36:24.804, Speaker B: Because the foliation is tangentially to the divisor x zero. I'm supposing always the presence of one of the divisors in this typical situation. But on the other side there is the locals of the depot and point is of co dimension greater ecodin two. So I don't know if you recall, but in this, when you combine these two hypotheses, this one with this one, you end up by concluding that the first component of this higher vertex h should be zero. It's greater or equal than zero because the divisor is invariant, but it's not strictly greater than zero because otherwise the divisor should be contained in the nippot locus. So there is these two other entries in the higher vertex, which eventually can be negative, right? We call that the Newton poly. The Newton polyhedron of a vector field can have negative vertices, but they are greater, equal and minus.
00:36:24.804 - 00:37:10.174, Speaker B: Yeah, so this explanation for what I just said. Okay, so now I going to the picture here represents the intersection of the polyhedron n with the plane given by v. One equals to zero. So you intersect the polyhedron with the plane given by first coordinate equals to zero. And now this is the age. So the age is the higher vertex with respect to lexicographic ordering. So it's situated in one of these three different possible positions, right? So let's say either.
00:37:10.174 - 00:38:10.004, Speaker B: So now I consider the two coordinates, h two and h three of this vertex h. And now there's an important separation between the first two situations and the last one. Yeah, so of course, sorry, I forgot you to say this. So why age is in this one of these two positions? Because if h is more to the right than what I represented here, then the vertical axis, the vertical z axis given by x y zero should be contained in an important locus. Okay, so now to guarantee that age is in one of these three positions here, I'm using this hypothesis, which I said that it's a hypothesis that going to appear in the typical situation.
00:38:10.504 - 00:38:11.364, Speaker A: Okay?
00:38:14.584 - 00:39:24.994, Speaker B: So the first two situations will be called the regular situations, and the third one will be called an impotent configuration. So regular configuration and potent configuration. Now so again this is, we're going to see that there is several situations where in some sense you have to split into different reasons depending on the configuration of the polyhedron. So in the regular configuration I'm going to define now what we call the main vertex of the polyhedron. So the main vertex is some sense the vertex which will control the whole procedure. Recall that in the case of dimension two you also had this main vertex which I showed up but now I have to separate the case, the regular case to the nil potent case. So in the regular case which are the two first ones here the main vertex is simple equals to h.
00:39:24.994 - 00:40:18.464, Speaker B: Okay. And in the nippot configuration, so what's the nipotent configuration? The nippon configuration is the one in which the intersection of the polyhedron with the plane given by first coordinate equals to zero has an edge which is positioned like the one that I illustrated here in the rightmost drawing. Okay, so in this case, well, if you recall the example of the cuspidal point which is an important singularity it's a sort of a generalization, a particular case of this configuration that I've just found here. So I. This is why I call this an important configuration. So in this, in this important configuration the main vertex is not age but is this n which appears here.
00:40:18.804 - 00:40:19.664, Speaker A: Okay.
00:40:22.604 - 00:40:37.334, Speaker B: Well, again we have to treat, since we are going to treat all possible cases we have to treat these three configurations but most of the time the first two of them will appear in some sense the third one is quite atypical.
00:40:39.354 - 00:40:40.894, Speaker A: But it shows up of course.
00:40:41.194 - 00:41:49.434, Speaker B: Okay, so you have defined the main vertex and now there is an important construction which is the following one. You take the main vertex m and now you're going to intersect the polyhedron with a plane with which is at height m three minus one half. Okay, so m three is the third coordinate of m and now we intersect with the polyhedron with a plane which is at height m three minus one half. So when you make this intersection, of course since everything is convex, you get a convex, let's say a convex set on this hyper on this plane and this, this is what they call the derivative polygon n prime. Okay, so now, of course, so. Sorry again, Daniel. Yes, so this one half here when in this definition is important could you have taken.
00:41:49.434 - 00:42:44.812, Speaker B: Yes, because in fact I'm going to show you an example in a moment. There's a classical construction of Hironaka which is called the characteristic polygon which is something which he has introduced to prove the resolution of singularities in surfaces, in excellent surfaces and in his construction, he takes one m three minus one and not one half. Now I'm going to show that it's not the same thing precisely because in the case of poly, of polyhedrons, for vector fields, it can have negative components. So you have, it's necessary to take one half here I'm going to show an example in a moment. I mean, I mean, one third could not have worked, for example, also a third would work, but not one. Okay, okay, I see, it's sufficient. Any height, let's say rational displacement, which is rational with it's more than strictly more than one hemisphere.
00:42:44.812 - 00:43:23.814, Speaker B: Okay, okay, because the, I recall that the vertices, let's say then the poly, the polygon n is defined by integral points, right, so, okay, so now I have this m prime, which is the minimal vertex of the derivative polygon n prime, again with respect to the lexicographical ornament. So now we have this polygon which is drawn in the plane at height m three minus one. And now I take the m prime as we have done in the two dimensional cases. In the two dimensional case.
00:43:26.154 - 00:43:27.410, Speaker A: Yeah, so.
00:43:27.602 - 00:44:16.248, Speaker B: And there is this displacement vector, which is simply the vector m prime minus m. Okay, sorry. Yes, with it will play an important role in a moment. So there is this delta, which is delta one, delta two, with our rational numbers in such a way that delta one, delta two minus one over one half is the vector m prime and the same. So it's the vector which links the m to m prime. Okay, so of course, one important question is why this? Why you have this intersection here? Because it could happen that the polygon, the polyhedron is so high that you don't have any. So that n prime should be empty.
00:44:16.248 - 00:44:31.364, Speaker B: Right? But this cannot hold, this cannot happen, because at least in the case where the main vertex has a height greater or equal than three, the derivative polygon cannot be empty.
00:44:31.904 - 00:44:32.360, Speaker A: Why?
00:44:32.432 - 00:44:49.764, Speaker B: Because if the intersection, let's say the n is empty, it should mean that the whole polyhedron is situated above the plane. So in the, let's say.
00:44:52.304 - 00:44:52.672, Speaker A: In the.
00:44:52.688 - 00:45:47.504, Speaker B: Half region given by v on r three, such that v three is greater or equal than one. Okay, so this is the only possibility when to have it a derivative polygon which is empty. But if this holds, then it implies that the plane z equals to zero is contained in nil potent locus. Because of the definition, you see that if you have such a configuration for your polyhedron, it means that all monomials which appear on the Taylor expansion of a local generator of the foliation should have a z square or something like this in its expansion. And this is equivalent to say that all points are the. But this contradicts our hypothesis that the potent locks don't have components of co dimension one.
00:45:47.804 - 00:45:48.624, Speaker A: Okay.
00:45:49.964 - 00:45:53.120, Speaker B: Okay, so this is true. Just to see. Sorry, yeah.
00:45:53.192 - 00:45:58.244, Speaker C: Excuse me, uh, Daniel? Uh, m. It's n in another.
00:45:58.984 - 00:46:02.200, Speaker B: Sorry, yeah, sorry. I mixed up a little bit the denotations.
00:46:02.232 - 00:46:02.472, Speaker A: Yes.
00:46:02.528 - 00:46:06.136, Speaker B: So, n. So, yes, because I was.
00:46:06.320 - 00:46:10.200, Speaker C: This is a. Yeah, I was hesitating if it was.
00:46:10.392 - 00:46:19.010, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah. And I think I've written it somewhere. Well, yeah, so n is the Newton polygon and n prime is the derivative one.
00:46:19.082 - 00:46:19.814, Speaker A: Okay.
00:46:20.914 - 00:46:24.050, Speaker C: No, yeah, but the little m and.
00:46:24.082 - 00:46:26.602, Speaker B: Little n. A little m is the.
00:46:26.618 - 00:46:27.334, Speaker A: Vertex.
00:46:29.754 - 00:46:31.554, Speaker B: Is the main vertex. Is the one.
00:46:31.634 - 00:46:36.450, Speaker C: The main vertex. Okay, sorry. Sometimes it's h and sometimes it's n. No.
00:46:36.562 - 00:46:42.546, Speaker B: Okay, so h. So there's two different say so at the start we have this h, which is the higher vertical.
00:46:42.570 - 00:46:42.682, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:42.698 - 00:46:43.824, Speaker C: Okay, I'm sorry.
00:46:43.904 - 00:46:44.160, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:44.192 - 00:46:45.764, Speaker C: So it was written there.
00:46:46.144 - 00:46:46.480, Speaker A: Yes.
00:46:46.512 - 00:47:08.484, Speaker B: In the generic case m is equal to h. But there is this special, a little bit annoying case where I have to take this second one here. It's okay. Okay, but most. Yeah, so there is this derivative polygon n prime, which I just showed you that it cannot be empty if.
00:47:11.164 - 00:47:11.428, Speaker A: In.
00:47:11.436 - 00:47:53.968, Speaker B: The condition that we are considering. And now I'm going to answer the question of Jean Philippe. So there is this famous hierarchus characteristic polygon where instead of cutting out at height m three minus one half, you cut at height m three minus one. Okay, so let's consider. So the problem here is precisely the fact that in the case of vector fields, you can have vertex with negative entries. Okay? So consider this example. And now I'm going to draw, to draw the polygon of this, the polyhedron source.
00:47:53.968 - 00:47:54.724, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:47:55.104 - 00:47:55.536, Speaker A: So.
00:47:55.600 - 00:48:03.946, Speaker B: Well, okay, so this first term here gives the main vertex which is at coordinate zero, zero three.
00:48:04.120 - 00:48:04.886, Speaker A: Okay.
00:48:05.030 - 00:48:19.678, Speaker B: And now there is this second monomial here, which is given zero, one, two, cannot select each one. And there is y seven. Perhaps there is a small mistake here.
00:48:19.846 - 00:48:20.166, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:20.190 - 00:48:33.616, Speaker B: So this should be d over dy. Perhaps I'm going to correct this, but this is not very important. The important is this triangle which appears here in the above.
00:48:33.760 - 00:48:34.040, Speaker A: Right?
00:48:34.072 - 00:49:33.534, Speaker B: So, and then there is this coefficient here which gives something which coordinates one minus one three. So this is the point here. Now let's, let's compare the derivative polygon that I just defined with the characteristics polygon of Hironaka, which is which I denoted here by n two prime. So if you cut out this polyhedron at height two, at height, let's say m three, this is height two. You just get one quadrant at with a point, a single vertex that coordinates zero one. But if you cut out at height three minus one two, then you capture this small, so this is the bottom drawing here. You capture this small side here.
00:49:35.994 - 00:49:36.330, Speaker A: Going.
00:49:36.362 - 00:50:29.024, Speaker B: From the point to the point. And this is quite important because this is precisely the intersection of this triangular face which appears here that you captured by taking this intersection. So you'll see that if the intersection is too low, you don't capture this face, which is triangular face. And this is precisely the face that we are going to use in our algorithm. In some sense, if you don't capture this face by cutting out at a convenient height, in the next blow up, you are going to lose the information about the main vertex. Again, this is precisely an example of the problems which are caused by, by the presence of vertices of negative coordinates.
00:50:30.804 - 00:50:31.324, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:31.404 - 00:51:28.334, Speaker B: So now the invariant, okay, I want to explain the invariant. So the invariant, it's a little bit more complicated than in dimension two. So the invariant of the foliage with respect to the coordinates x, y and z, of course, because everything is computed with respect to the polygon, the polyhedral source, which on its turn depend on the coordinates. So now it's given by a vector of natural numbers, of six natural numbers. I'm going to explain which the meaning of each one of these entries, m two and m three, are the second and the third coordinates of the main vertex. Now there is this delta, which is delta one and delta two. I recall to you, just go back a little bit.
00:51:28.334 - 00:51:46.634, Speaker B: These, sorry, are the coordinates of the displacement vector, I mean the vector which connects m to m prime. Again, they are rational, because everything is rational is defined over the rationals. I normalize it somewhere.
00:51:47.974 - 00:51:48.630, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:51:48.742 - 00:52:49.916, Speaker B: Okay, so there's delta one and delta two, and then there is this lambda, which is here. Just to normalize things and guarantee that this vector is an integral vector, is a vector of natural number. So I just multiply delta one and delta two by the factorial of m three plus one, because this is what guarantees that this will eliminate the possible denominators which appear in the expression of delta one and delta two. Now, so there is this e, which counts the number of irreducible components of the divisor at the origin. So I recall to you that in our typical situation there either one or two components of the device. So e is either one or two. And now the I mean the, the number which appear here is just e minus one.
00:52:49.916 - 00:53:40.304, Speaker B: So it, it's range is, it's either zero or one. So, okay, this is our, let's see, quite easy to explain. And now there is this important first component, which again is due to a phenomenon which does not appear in the case of, let's say of classical polyhedrons, which is so called the virtual height. So the virtual height is a natural number. I'm going to give an example in a moment, which is defined as. So it depends on the second coordinate of the main vertex. So if the main vertex is positioned at minus, let's say, let's start with this case, which is either.
00:53:40.304 - 00:53:47.584, Speaker B: So if the main vertex is at has its second coordinate equals to zero.
00:53:48.164 - 00:53:52.664, Speaker A: And the displacement vector is positive, or.
00:53:53.004 - 00:54:26.704, Speaker B: The displacement vector is positive. So the vertical height is just equal to m three. But there's a second case here. I'm going to illustrate an example where the main vertex is situated. Let's say second coordinate is equal to minus one and delta one equals to zero. And in this case it's given by this expression which I'm going to show to you. What's the meaning of this? This is the integral part of m three minus one plus one minus one over delta two.
00:54:26.704 - 00:55:26.468, Speaker B: Okay, so an example, take this vector field here and now. So its main vertex is at the .0 -14 and then the displacement vector is delta one, delta 2023. And now what's the virtual height? So now you see that there is this line here with this arrow which links, in fact the displacement vector is this vector which is represented with this bold arrow here. And now what you do is that you extend the line given by this arrow. And now you see the point where it intersects the vertical axis given by v. One equals to v, two equals to zero.
00:55:26.468 - 00:55:34.796, Speaker B: So this is this point which appear here. And the formula for this point is just m three minus one over delta.
00:55:34.820 - 00:55:37.424, Speaker A: Two, which is.
00:55:41.324 - 00:56:48.078, Speaker B: Two, right? So five, five over two. And the virtual height in this case is just the smallest integral integral number which is strictly greater than this. Okay, so you take this possible rational number and you round out to the greatest integral number which is to the smallest integral number which is greater than this. So in this case the invert is given by this six numbers which appear in below. So I claim that, now I'm going to explain to you what is the strategy of resolution of singularities. And I claim that if you compute this invariant with respect to a convenient system of coordinates, it will lexicographically decrease after each blowing up, provided that you. Okay, you compute it on near potent parts, of course.
00:56:48.078 - 00:57:23.988, Speaker B: So since it, let's say since it's. It cannot decrease indefinitely by the lexicographical order, at some point you are going to get an elementary situation where all points are decentralized. Okay, so it seems a little bit complicated, but I'm going to explain why you need to. So I'm going to explain to you the main singularization strategy and then why we have to consider this fancy number.
00:57:24.036 - 00:57:36.576, Speaker A: Which appears here, this h. Okay? Yeah. Okay.
00:57:36.600 - 00:58:19.014, Speaker B: So we have all the ingredients to define the local desingularization strategy. But now I have to show to you how to choose the main phase. So we have this I recall too, there is the m prime, which is the vertex of the derivative polygon situated at height m three minus one half. And now we do exactly as we have done. In the case of dimension two, we define the main side. I'm not going to call this a main edge, because it's not an edge of the polyhedron, but it's the edge. It's an edge of the derivative polygon, and I call it the main side.
00:58:19.014 - 00:58:42.856, Speaker B: So it's defined as. So if now I have drawn here them the derivative polygon n prime. So there are two situations. Either m one prime is positive. And in this case I choose the face, the side as being e zero.
00:58:42.960 - 00:58:44.208, Speaker A: In the picture, the picture.
00:58:44.256 - 00:59:22.604, Speaker B: Okay, so in this case I choose e zero. But if a m one prime is zero, then I choose e one. So the main side of n is either given by e zero or by e one. So it's e zero if the n prime is to the right of the vertical axis. And if n prime, it's exactly, let's say, intersects the vertical axis. Then you choose e one.
00:59:25.064 - 00:59:25.924, Speaker A: Okay.
00:59:28.144 - 01:00:11.390, Speaker B: Now make a drawing. So now you have the main edge. Yes, there is a small mistake here. So, the main edge of the polyhedron, of the polyhedron n is the edge defined by the segment connecting the main vertex with the main derivative vertex. So the connecting m to m prime. You can see this in the, in the drawing below. And then you have the main phase of n, which is the unique face of the polyhedron, which intersects the derivative polygon on the main side that I have just defined.
01:00:11.542 - 01:00:11.830, Speaker A: Right.
01:00:11.862 - 01:00:37.208, Speaker B: So you look at this leftmost drawing, have the main side given by this lowercase f. And then when you look at the face whose trace is given by a small f, you have some face capital f, which are going to call the main face of the polyhedron.
01:00:37.326 - 01:00:38.104, Speaker A: Okay?
01:00:39.084 - 01:01:36.444, Speaker B: Okay, so this is the main phase. And as you can imagine now the strategy consists in choosing a weighted blowup whose weight is defined by a vector which is orthogonal to this main phase. Okay, so there, there are two numbers which I'm going to introduce because they play a role in a moment. So there's, you recall that there is this displacement vector delta, which is given by m prime minus m. So, and then the main side of the derivative polygon can be written as in this form.
01:01:36.564 - 01:01:37.304, Speaker A: Okay?
01:01:39.564 - 01:02:29.266, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, sorry. Yeah. So what I'm considering this is that the main side f is given by m prime plus a multiple plus, let's say, t times this vector c minus 10, where t, let's say, varies in some interval of the real line. And then this number c lies on the extended, the field of extended positive rational. So it can be positive rational or eventually plus infinity. Okay, and I call this c minus 10, the horizontal displacement vector. Well, okay, so I make just a drawing here to show to you what are the possibilities here.
01:02:29.266 - 01:03:43.354, Speaker B: So we have m, we call you the main vertex, and then there is this delta minus one, which is the, yes, delta minus one, which is, it should be, that is the vertical displacement vector. And then there's this c, which in some sense it gives you the direction in, inside the plane at height m three minus one. So these two vectors delta minus one and c minus 10, they generate them, they affine plane which, which supports the main phase. So I say that the main phase is just given by m three plus a convex combination of these vectors. The delta one minus one and c zero minus one. So you see that there are two cases where there are two extreme cases. Here, the case where c equals to zero corresponds precisely to the case where the main side of the derivative polygon is vertical.
01:03:43.354 - 01:04:20.464, Speaker B: And then there is the case where c equals to infinity is the case where the derivative polygon is a quadrant. So the case where you can have a quadrant when you intersect, you see this rightmost drawing here means that when you intersect your polyhedron with, with the plane at height m three minus one, you can get a quadrant. And in this case you have c equals to infinity in this expression. In this expression.
01:04:23.484 - 01:04:24.464, Speaker A: Okay?
01:04:25.964 - 01:05:19.070, Speaker B: Yeah. So now, of course, the strategy for resolution of similarity in this case consists, as I said, in blowing up with the weight prescribed by this main phase. So if you recall what I have done in dimension two, it's quite easy to understand combinatorially what is the effect of blowing up with these weights. It simply corresponds to projecting the polyhedron by a, by shearing transformation in one of the three possible, let's say three coordinate hyperplanes. So if you make the x directional blow up, let's say the uppermost here, you just project in the, in the wall which lies on the screen.
01:05:19.222 - 01:05:19.510, Speaker A: Right?
01:05:19.542 - 01:05:24.194, Speaker B: So you have this projection here which I've drawn in the upper right.
01:05:26.214 - 01:05:26.954, Speaker A: Part.
01:05:27.374 - 01:06:32.174, Speaker B: Okay, if you have, if you make the y directional blow up, then you project the main phase by a shearing transformation in the, in the right, most in the plane, let's say in the plane given by second coordinate equals to zero. And if you make the z directional blow up, then it project in the bottom plane. Okay, so this is, of course this is just a combinatorial effect of the blowing up, which means that when you make the blow up and don't make any other translations, you recall that the problem for us is that you have to keep track of these combinatorial transformations and then to the eventual translations which are due to the fact that you have to recenter your coordinates on each point of the new exceptional divisor. But if you only consider the blow up, the combinatorial blow up without.
01:06:33.914 - 01:06:34.202, Speaker A: The.
01:06:34.218 - 01:07:19.384, Speaker B: Translations, it's quite easy to see that in each one of these three possibilities, the environment decreases strictly. Okay, so this is one of the ideas to why this invariant appears. Okay, so there's this z directional chart, which is quite easy to deal with because when you recall that in our initial hypothesis, I said that the main vertex has coordinates zero m two and m three, where m two is either equal to minus one or two one.
01:07:19.544 - 01:07:20.244, Speaker A: Right?
01:07:20.864 - 01:08:50.072, Speaker B: And then when you project on the bottom plane, which is what I've done here, in the z direction, you easily see that you always finishes with an elementary situation. So by this I mean that in the vertical direction, when you look at the blowing up in the vertical direction, you always attain in a single step and elementary situation. So what? The same phenomenon appeared in the case of planning up of planar rectophilus. So this is one of the reasons in some sense why I can always guarantee that there are no, the number of irreducible components of the divisor in the typical situation is never equal to three, because when you create a third component in the divisor as it appears in the z directional blow up, then you already attended an elementary situation. Okay, so what we just have to take care is to the two transformations which appear on the rightmost side of my drawing here, eventually followed by, of course by translations, right? So this is the, I recall, I just repeat that this is the combinatorial effect of the blowing up. But then there is a complicated issue.
01:08:50.168 - 01:08:54.356, Speaker A: Which is to guarantee that when you.
01:08:54.380 - 01:09:43.384, Speaker B: Make the translations, there is no compensation phenomena which could make your environment does not decrease or even increase in this case. Okay, so I'm going to give an example to show why the main vertex, the height of the main vertex, cannot be the first invariant, the first entry in the invariant. So I recall to you that in the case of two dimensional vector fields, there was a single invariant effect, that's catesim, which was precisely the height of the main vertex. Recall this is something which always decreases by blowing up. But it cannot be. So in this case, because, okay, well, there's something, yeah, sorry.
01:09:44.284 - 01:09:44.620, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:09:44.652 - 01:10:28.024, Speaker B: So this is the example. So you consider this vector field here, okay, it's drawing on the left hand side, and you compute the first three entries of its invariant. So the virtual height in this case is given by two, because by definition, and then there is the position of this, let's say the second coordinate of the invariant with m two, one. In this case, m two equals to zero. So you have one and then m three, which is two, okay, which is given by m three is given by.
01:10:29.604 - 01:10:33.224, Speaker A: By this first, sorry.
01:10:36.364 - 01:10:41.308, Speaker B: Yeah, m three is given by. Something wrong here.
01:10:41.436 - 01:10:42.184, Speaker A: Sorry.
01:10:46.784 - 01:11:06.896, Speaker B: Something wrong with my example. I have to check out. So y, okay, so, so this z 3d over dz gives the main vertex, sorry, because I have to, when you write this term in logarithmic coordinates, it.
01:11:06.920 - 01:11:10.724, Speaker A: Gives you z squared times z over.
01:11:10.764 - 01:12:01.252, Speaker B: Dz over d over dz. Daniel. Yes? Are you talking here about the main vertex or the higher vertex? In this case, it's the same thing, because this is a regular situation. Yes. If you take this polyhedron and intersect with the plane given by v, one equals to zero, you just have a configuration where, a regular configuration, I'm just checking out if, yeah, so the vertex of coordinate zero, zero two comes from dz cubed z d over dz dz. And then there is this vertex zero 10, which comes from y squared d over dynamic.
01:12:01.338 - 01:12:01.600, Speaker A: Yes.
01:12:01.632 - 01:13:47.106, Speaker B: And then there is x, this second xz cube, which gives you this vertex of coordinates zero, sorry, one minus one three. And you see here that there is a negative second entry, precisely because when you write this expression in this polynomial in the logarithmic basis, you get a negative exponent in y. So in fact, in our invariant, we don't see this negative third vertex, because you just look at what happens in the plane v, one equals to zero. But when you make the blow up in the direction x. So let's say this triangle here given by this tree vertex is our main phase according to what I've explained to you, right? So when you make the blow up with the weight given by a very, let's say, with the weight which defines the hyperplane, which supports the main phase, the effect is to project this triangle, this triangle here in the plane v, one equals to zero. But you see that when you project the vertex, this rightmost vertex with coordinates zero minus one three becomes, or, sorry, with coordinates one minus one three becomes zero minus one three, and then it becomes the main vertex of the transformant polygon. Polyhedron.
01:13:47.106 - 01:13:47.702, Speaker B: Sorry?
01:13:47.858 - 01:13:55.766, Speaker A: Yeah, but the original polyhedron has a.
01:13:55.790 - 01:15:11.188, Speaker B: Main vertex, had a main vertex with height two, and now you have a main vertex of height three, right? So the main height has increased precisely because there was something with the negative coordinates which was lying in the main face. Okay, fortune. So this, this, there's a lot of small adjustments which are due to this kind of phenomena. And this justifies why you have to take this, this vector of c, six natural numbers, each one of them in some sense takes care of one of this annoying phenomena which appears when you, you consider these projections. So if you can check out what modulus and mistake of my part. So when you blow up, you get this new vector field and the new environment as I defined. So the main height is two, but then the second coordinate of the main vertex, which was in the beginning it was zero.
01:15:11.188 - 01:16:24.484, Speaker B: Now it's minus one right from here. So the invert now is 20 three, and at the beginning it was two one two. So it's lexicographically smaller, even if it's third entry has increased. Okay, well, yes, looks like this. Well, so as in the case of dimension two, in order to guarantee that the invariant decreases, you have to compute it with respect to a stable coordinate system. I'm going to explain this in more detail next time, because I think I don't have time. But the idea, if you recall what I have done in dimension two, is that once we start with any coordinate system which is adapted to the divisor, we are going to be able to stabilize, in a sense that I'm going to explain to you next time in order to get a new coordinate system.
01:16:24.484 - 01:17:06.884, Speaker B: And moreover, this stabilization procedure is given always by a chain of coordinates, which is of this triangular form, essentially. Okay, so this is in some sense, this is the essential part of the modular multiplication by a unit, I could say this will be given by the preparation of coordinates, will be given by a chain of coordinates where x tilde, x, x and y. Tilde is y plus something which only depends on x and z. Tilde is given by z plus something which depends eventually on x and y. So it's a triangular form.
01:17:10.104 - 01:17:10.480, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:17:10.512 - 01:17:19.484, Speaker B: What's written here. Yes. So in some sense, we don't want to have too many, much freedom in the choice of coordinates.
01:17:19.624 - 01:17:19.924, Speaker A: Why?
01:17:19.964 - 01:18:57.394, Speaker B: Because you see that all these invariants that I defined, they are very, very depend in a very strong way in the choice of coordinates. So in some sense, we don't want to have too much choice when fixing these coordinates where we compute the invariant. And in order to do this, I'm going to, in fact, one of the ways to do this is to really define the choice of coordinates by introducing an additional geometric structure, which I call a nexus. I'm going to explain this. So I want to define to you what's an axis, but in some sense it's something which guarantees that when you move from one admissible system of coordinates to the other, by admissible, I mean that it should respect the divisor and also respect this structure called a nexus. And in this case, it should necessarily be given by something which is of this triangular form. Okay, so once you define, as I said, then this axis, the local strategy of blowing up, will be obtained by reading out the, let's say, this combinatorial data based on the Newton polyhedron for any stable system of coordinates.
01:18:57.394 - 01:19:24.240, Speaker B: Okay, so this is important. You recall that I said to you that when you compute the environment that I have computed, in the case of two dimensions, they were completely, they were a sort of intrinsic object attached to the foliation, provided that they were computed with respect to a stable system of coordinates. In this case, it's the same thing.
01:19:24.392 - 01:19:25.204, Speaker A: Okay.
01:19:25.624 - 01:20:50.954, Speaker B: It means that when you compute this long invariant that I have explained to you with respect to this, to a stable system of coordinates, it will be both intrinsically attached to the foliation and moreover, it will be an upper semi continuous function, by which I mean that you can, in fact, you can globalize this local strategy by always blowing up the locus of a maximal, where this invariant is maximum. So it gives you always analytic subset of our ambient space. Yeah. So again, to make some parallels, this notion of stable coordinates is quite similar to the notion of well prepared and very well prepared coordinates of Hiranaka's paper in some sense. Again, this always, in some sense, a generalization of this Chindhausen transformation. But in Hironaka's paper, if I'm not mistaken, he asks for a more strong condition about the, about the, let's say, which some sort of maximum contact situation. But I've explained to you that in the context of a vector field, we cannot expect in general, to have.
01:20:53.254 - 01:20:53.566, Speaker A: The.
01:20:53.590 - 01:21:14.984, Speaker B: Usual maximum contact situation. But you can still have some small sort of preparation which abjankers call the lazy Chinhausen. This some sort, the lazy Chinhausen in our context is this stabilization of coordinates.
01:21:17.924 - 01:21:18.468, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:21:18.556 - 01:22:15.164, Speaker B: Okay. So I said to you that this preparation of coordinates, it's quite, it's much harder to understand in the case of vector fields, because when you look at the D group given by these triangular changes of coordinates, it's quite easy to understand how it acts on germs or functions. But when you look at its action on germs of vector fields, it's much more tricky to understand the orbits of a vector field by the action of this group. Oh, I repeat the same things here. Sorry, I didn't have time to prepare much this. Yeah, so I'm going to finish with this because I think it's enough today. So what's the nexus? The goal is, as I said, is to, we don't have, of course you want to have some freedom in the choice of coordinates, but not too much freedom, because otherwise we're completely lost.
01:22:15.164 - 01:23:13.034, Speaker B: We, I cannot define, I cannot extract good invariance from the good intrinsic invariants from the polyhedron, except if this polyhedron is in some sense has some rigidity. So in the case of two dimensional vector fields, I recall to you that I've asked the coordinates to be always adapted to the divisor, in the sense that the divisor should always be given by x equals to zero. But in this case, in the case of three dimensions, this is not enough. So this is why I introduced this new structure here. So what's the nexus? So you started your singular foliated manifold mef, this triple. And now for me, an axis is a pair given by. So u is an open neighborhood of the nipotent locus of the foliation.
01:23:13.394 - 01:23:14.074, Speaker A: Okay?
01:23:14.194 - 01:24:06.344, Speaker B: So I'm not interested in what happens outside an important locus. So I'm going to, just to study what happens in a nearby the nipotent locus. So I'm going, it will be enough for us to define this axis in, in some open neighborhood of the nepotentilocus. And now on this neighborhood I'm going to, to note by calligraphic a, an analytic foliation by curves. So it is a new analytic folliation by curves, which in principle, of course is different from f, which in some sense it should be generically transverse to f. Okay, so what I mean by that, it means that, okay, it's adapted to the divisor. It's non singular, it has no singularities.
01:24:06.344 - 01:24:47.136, Speaker B: And if you place yourself in each point of the divisor which is contained in the, let's say in the device which contained in this open set u, where the axis exists, let's suppose that you, you fix some coordinates where the axis is given by d, is the foundation defined by d over dz. So the x, it's the z axis, in fact, the vertical axis. So the foliation is given by parallel lines, let's say lines parallel to the vertical axis, z over d, already z. So in this case, the hypothesis is.
01:24:47.160 - 01:24:47.724, Speaker A: That.
01:24:51.424 - 01:26:06.554, Speaker B: The nipotent locus is not contained, does not contain the axis through p. So you recall that this, in our, when I told you about this typical situation where I suppose that the intersection of the two divisors like this, I don't know if you see, it does not contain, it's not contained an important locus. This is, in this case, I'm sort of generalizing this typical situation by saying that the leaf of the axis through the point pull should not be contained in any potent locus. So this is first condition, and this holds for all points on the divisor. And then there's the point, the points which are outside the divisor. And in this case, I ask for a more stronger condition, which is that the axis, the foliation a and the foliation f should not have a common leaf. Okay, so I can express this by this equation here.
01:26:06.554 - 01:26:19.040, Speaker B: So if I choose local coordinates where the x is given by d over dz, I'm asking that this vertical axis.
01:26:19.142 - 01:26:22.900, Speaker A: Given by z, I'm sorry, x equals.
01:26:22.932 - 01:26:58.678, Speaker B: To y equals to zero, is not a leaf, a local leaf of the foliation f. This is the same thing as ac. The axis through p is not an invariant curve for f. So let's say the message here is that the axis is some new foliation which is everywhere irregular. And it's very transversal to the foliation, which I want to singularize. I make, I made a drawing here. So you see that you have the independent locus of m of f, and here you have this axis a.
01:26:58.678 - 01:27:15.244, Speaker B: And you can imagine locally as being something like the z, or let's say d over dz. So at any, at no point you should have the, the important locus containing one of these axes.
01:27:18.544 - 01:27:19.088, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:27:19.176 - 01:27:36.216, Speaker B: So in fact, so an axis cannot exist if you had an important point which has had three components of the divisor which lies in the direction of three components of the divisor.
01:27:36.280 - 01:27:36.480, Speaker A: Why?
01:27:36.512 - 01:28:46.544, Speaker B: Because if you had three components of the divisor through an impotent point, of course in this point here, any foliation which is tangent to the divisor should be singular, in particular an axis. As I'm asking an axis to be invariant by the divisor, it should be similar here. So in this case it would not be possible to have an axis. But as I said, this is a situation that you're always going to prevent because each time that you create a third component in the divisor, the singularity which appears on this intersection of the three components will already be elementary. So no more interesting for us. But in the two first situations here, the two left mode situations, you can have an axis. And let's say in this middle situation, the condition that x is tangent to the foliation obliges that the intersection of the two divisors should be the leaf of the axis through this point.
01:28:46.544 - 01:29:02.904, Speaker B: In this case I'm asking that. So the axis should be precisely the z axis here. And in this case we need that the nippon locus does not contain the z axis.
01:29:06.284 - 01:29:06.732, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:29:06.788 - 01:30:19.524, Speaker B: Okay, so just two last definitions. I think I'm going to finish in a moment. So we say that this triple mef is controllable if there exists as an axis as above. So in fact this axis in some sense will be used as a tool to control or more precisely to rigidify the choice of coordinates. So at each step we need to choose coordinates which will be stable in the sense that they're going to define next time, but in such a way that at the same time on these coordinates I'm requiring the axis should be given by this. Okay, so a coordinate will be adapted to the axis if in this coordinates a is always locally generated by z over DC. So one thing that you can see is that if you fix this condition on your system of local coordinates, it's immediate to see that when you change from one adapted system of coordinates to the other.
01:30:19.524 - 01:30:44.254, Speaker B: Sorry, they're going to go a bit back. You really find the sense that this third component cannot depend. Sorry. In the first two components cannot depend on z. Okay, so in some sense you already get this property of triangular triangularity of your change of coordinates by imposing that it should always respect the axis.
01:30:48.794 - 01:30:49.614, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:30:51.674 - 01:32:09.284, Speaker B: So we see that this link reformatted mechanism is controllable if you can find an axis, by which I mean a foliation, a regular foliage satisfy the condition that I showed you before. And in this case, this for here is called a singularly controlled singularly for the controlled singular for manifold. So my last remark from today, I think, I think I, yes, I'm going to finish with this, is that, well, as I said to you, it's not always possible to have a controllable single frame manifold. In particular, when you start with a situation where you have an important point with e equals to three, you cannot have, it's not going to be controllable, right? Because in this case, there is no possible definition of axis at this point. But my last claim from today is that if we start with a situation where the divisor is empty, then it's controllable. So it's quite easy, you see here. But you, if you start a situation where there is no divisor, then you can always define such axis.
01:32:09.284 - 01:32:46.298, Speaker B: You can always define a sufficiently transverse regular foliation which will satisfy our conditions. Well, what's the idea of the proof? So, it's very easy in the beginning, but now at the end, we are going to use a quite powerful theorem. So, since the divisor is empty, we have to choose just a regular one dimensional foliation in the neighborhood of nearpotent locus, which contains no invariant curve of.
01:32:46.346 - 01:32:46.934, Speaker A: F.
01:32:48.714 - 01:34:10.020, Speaker B: Recall that when you are outside the divisor, we ask that the axis, the foliation given by the axis has no leave in common with the foliation given by f. Okay, well, how do we do this? Well, in fact, it's quite easy to do this locally in the neighborhood of each point by a very easy perturbation argument. Okay, so you place yourself on each point of an important locus. And what you do that, you give biogenetic choice of coordinates, you can always define, um, let's say one coordinate equals two constant, which is not, it's generically transverse to the foliation given by f. So it quite, is quite easy to do this locally at each point by saying, let's say by chance, by choosing by, by a randomly, a change of coordinates, the coordinates, this will always be true to the x is given by one of, one of the, let's say two of the coordinates equals to constant. Now by partitions of unity, you can glue together these local perturbations. Okay, I've detailed this argument in my paper.
01:34:10.020 - 01:35:18.964, Speaker B: I'm not going to enter in detail, but it's quite easy to glue up these local perturbations. Let's say this local axis given on each point and define a c infinity foliation, which I call a tilde, which satisfies all the requirements. Ok, this by partition of cunity, it's quite, let's see, in the c infinity setting, you have a lot of freedom to do this. You can also do this by some sort of regularization and convolution method, but you end up with a sinfinity axis. And now it's the, now you are going to use the powerful theorem, which is the so called grauert embedding theorem, which say that, well, it says that you can embed any analytic manifold in rn for n sufficiently large. And one of the consequences that anything which is synfinity defined on an analytic manifold can be arbitrarily, well approximated by something which is analytic. Okay, so this is detailed in the graphics paper.
01:35:18.964 - 01:36:41.444, Speaker B: So using this gravity embedding, you can approach as well as you want this c infinity axis by an analytic axis which will satisfy all the requirements that I have listed. Okay, well, it's not very hard, but there's a very hard theorem behind. And indeed, when I adapted these results to the complex setting, we cannot use this argument because this gravity embedding theorem is something which is very particular to real analytical manifolds. It's not true that an allomorphic manifold can be embedded in CN for sufficiently high n by it means that it's not, not every complex manifold. This is time. Okay, so in our case, for, if you want to adapt this construction to the case of vector fields over C, you have to some sort to change a little bit the definition of an axis. I'm not going to comment too much on this, but there is a notion of quasi axis which allows us to define a global object without having to use the graudzing building theory.
01:36:41.444 - 01:36:45.384, Speaker B: So I think I'm going to finish here.
01:36:45.424 - 01:36:46.044, Speaker A: Yes.
01:36:46.344 - 01:37:16.226, Speaker B: So next time I'm going to explain to you how to use this axis to define what we call an adapted system of coordinates, and then to show how we can define a stable system of coordinates, which will take care of this phenomena of full compensation, which could happen when you make the combinatorial blow up and then the translation. So I think I'm going to stop here.
01:37:16.410 - 01:37:17.294, Speaker A: Thank you.
01:37:19.114 - 01:37:20.174, Speaker B: For your attention.
01:37:23.194 - 01:37:24.114, Speaker A: Stop the recording.
