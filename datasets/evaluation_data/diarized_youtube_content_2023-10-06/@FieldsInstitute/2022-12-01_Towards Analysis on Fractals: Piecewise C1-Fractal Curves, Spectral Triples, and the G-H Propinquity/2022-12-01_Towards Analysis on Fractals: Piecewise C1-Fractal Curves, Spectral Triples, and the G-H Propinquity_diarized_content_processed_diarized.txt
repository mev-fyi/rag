00:00:00.800 - 00:00:07.902, Speaker A: Teresa Landry, and she's going to tell us about analysis on fractals. I'll let you read the title title yourself.
00:00:07.958 - 00:00:51.112, Speaker B: It's long PsWyc one. Fractal curves. Lapidus, sarcasm, spectral triples and the gromlove. So thank you very much, organizers of this program, for giving me this opportunity to talk about my work with my collaborators. So, a key tool in the development of analysis on crackles is a development of the theory of their primate approximation. And that is because there are a lot of instances of natural phenomena that fractal geometers would call fractal. But of course, theoretical fractal is an infinite object in any occurrence.
00:00:51.112 - 00:01:21.000, Speaker B: A fractality in nature will by necessity define it. And as we all know, natural. There are many natural processes which can be modeled by differential equations. But classically, the solutions of such equations are often formulated in terms of operators on smooth manifolds. Another motivation for the development of analysis on fractals is the extension of such methods to fractal spaces. Sorry, you need them? Oh, they can't hear you.
00:01:21.032 - 00:01:35.204, Speaker C: I'm sorry. Okay. Sorry. That might have been part of being ready to go anytime. Okay, do I.
00:01:48.864 - 00:01:49.880, Speaker B: That should be good now.
00:01:49.952 - 00:01:50.480, Speaker C: Sorry.
00:01:50.592 - 00:01:55.644, Speaker A: Okay, so we're gonna take it from the top once more, this time with microphone. Maybe you can check. They can hear you.
00:01:56.664 - 00:02:07.368, Speaker C: Can you guys hear me? Or clap your hands if you can. Yes, we can hear you. Can you hear us? Yes.
00:02:07.416 - 00:02:08.644, Speaker A: Yeah, we can hear you. Great.
00:02:13.794 - 00:02:48.216, Speaker C: Okay. Well, all right. So why develop. So, a key tool in the development of analysis on fractals is a development of a theory of their finite approximation. And that is because there are many instances of natural phenomena that fractal geometers all agree are fractal. But a fractal is an infinite object. And by necessity, any occurrence of fractality in nature will be finite.
00:02:48.216 - 00:03:56.824, Speaker C: And so also there are important natural processes which are modeled by differential equations. But classically, their solutions are often formulated in terms of operators on smooth manifolds. So extending these methods to fractal spaces would allow us to. To better be able to understand how fractality arises and evolves in nature. So, in service of these goals, my work uses tools from non commutative geometry, in particular, spectral triples, because those can be viewed as a generalization of differentiable structure and the grammar of house star propinquity, which can be viewed as a sanction of housedorf distance to function spaces. And that's because accessing the geometry of a space like a fractal, through its function space removes any obstructions that might occur from the scarcity or absence of sufficiently well behaved paths on the space. So here is an important test case for analysis on fractals, and that is the Sierpinski gasket.
00:03:56.824 - 00:05:01.324, Speaker C: And that is because there actually does not exist any one definition of fractality that captures all the objects and processes that fractal geometers agree are fractal. So there are many non equivalent definitions of fractality, and the Sierpinski gasket satisfies several of them. So, for instance, it is self similar. It also has fractional haustorf dimensions, so they're actually fractals that do not have fractional house dwarf dimension. And it can also, for it can also be realized as a unique fixed point of an iterated function system, in particular, this one. So what is our framework for studying Sierpinski gasket type fractals? Well, that is the class of piecewise c, one fractal curves. So again, the serpentine gasket is the motivating example for this class of fractal curves.
00:05:01.324 - 00:06:08.648, Speaker C: It is a compact link space, and it's a compact link space that exhibits the following properties. So, first of all, the space can be decomposed into a countable set of parameterized curves, and it can be enumerated with respect to decreasing arc length. And the role of the second axiom is that it allows you to get a handle on the geodesics of the space. So it tells you that an implication of it is that the endpoints of the parameterized curves are dense in the space. And it also allows you to write the minimizing geodesics between two points as a concatenation, accountable concatenation of the parameterized. So besides a Sierpinski gasket, another very important example of a fractal that falls in this class is the harmonic gasket. And this is fundamentally different from the Sirkinski gasket.
00:06:08.648 - 00:07:59.852, Speaker C: First of all, it is self affine rather than self similar. But it's also fundamental importance, because this is a fractal on which there exists the most well developed measurable analog of romanian geometry. Thanks to Jun Kagami. So thanks to Jun Kagame, for the harmonic gasket, we have measurable analogs of romanian gradient volume and measure. Okay, so how might one approximate piecewise c, one fractal curves? So this is the usual realization of the or approximation of the Sierpinski gasket as an increasing union of finite graphs. And so, one of the things that Lapidus and lotrum olier and I did was come up with, we enriched the framework of p slice u one fractal curves with the notion of approximation sequence, so that a sequence of finite graphs would support also other structures like compact metric spaces and our quantum analogs of differential structures, that is, spectral triples, that those would also approximate those on the limiting fractal curve. So, um, even if we have um, an enumeration of um, of the parameterized curves by decreasing arc length, that doesn't mean that any, um, subsequence of these, um, parameterized curves is going to give us an approximating finite graph.
00:07:59.852 - 00:09:45.404, Speaker C: So, so you have to be careful in, in determining up to which parameterized curve in that enumeration to take in order to even for the housework distance, come up with a sequence of finite graphs that approximates the fractal curve. And so here is our definition of approximation sequence. So we have a piecewise c one fractal curve, we have a decomposition of it into parameterized curves. So our notion of approximation sequence is a strictly increasing function, and it is one that tells us up to which parameterized curve to take our union over to define our finite graph, and such that the corresponding sequence of finite graphs, when we equip it with the geodesic distance, exhibits the following properties. So for, so this tells you that the vertices in each finite graph are sufficiently well distributed throughout the finite graph for our approximation purposes, and also that the, when you lift the vertices of each finite graph up to the level of the limiting fractal curve, that the geodesic distance remains the same. So, as we'll see in a later example, it turns out that the inclusion map for each finite graph that it's actually not embedding. So, here's an example of approximation sequence for the Sierpinski gasket.
00:09:45.404 - 00:11:15.850, Speaker C: So namely, first take as your set of parameterized curves, first edges of length one, then of length one half, then of length one four. And so what increasing function describes the sequence of finite graphs? So that's, in particular this one does the job. And so this increasing function is such that we can capture this particular sequence of finite graphs. And it turns out that this particular approximation sequence happens to also work for a harmonic gasket. And it was really in trying to come up with, to generalize what properties were needed to go from even, just to even just be able to deal with the case of the harmonic gasket, that we had to come up with this generalized notion of approximation sequence, because you can see here from the self affinity, that it's not quite as predictable as it is when you have the self similarity. And that's another reason that the harmonic gasket is important, because in a way it's a relaxation of the strict self similarity that's normally associated with fractality. So, um, in romanian geometry, intrinsic metrics play an important role.
00:11:15.850 - 00:12:51.914, Speaker C: And for, um, fractal curves and finite graphs, a natural choice of intrinsic metric is the geodesic distance. So now this is where, um, the, uh, conditions on the vertices, why the importance of some of those might become apparent. So for instance, this point and this point, those are not vertices on this finite graph. But when I lift them to the fractal curve, then with respect to the geodesic distance, it gets shorter, right? But if I consider only vertices like so this one and this one, when I lift it to the fractal curve, the geodesic distance remains the same. So even at the level of Gromov Hausdorff's distance convergence for these corresponding compact metric spaces, that's still a non trivial sort of problem, and one which was a motivation for our choice of definition of approximation theory. And so that said, in order to be able to access these spaces via the perspective or lens of non commutative geometry, we need to make the appropriate choice of function spaces. And these function spaces in particular, as we'll see, happen to be very important examples of certain function spaces.
00:12:51.914 - 00:13:36.168, Speaker C: So many fractals are compact housedrive spaces. And the topological properties of such fractals can be recovered. And so their topological properties can be recovered from algebraic properties of their spaces of continuous complex valued functions. And, well, see, like such spaces are examples of c star algebras. So a sea star algebra is a Banach algebra, but it comes equipped with a star operation. And this star operation is conjugate linear. It's invaluative, it's anti multiplicative.
00:13:36.168 - 00:14:57.514, Speaker C: And then, what really distinguishes a sea star algebra from a Banach algebra is the way it determines the norm on the sea star algebra. So the sea star identity and this intertwining with the norm property is what really distinguishes c star algebras from Bahnatk algebras. And some examples include, well, the complex numbers and c of x for any compact housed or space x n by n matrices over c, and the space of bounded operators for any Hilbert space. So in the setting of c of x, the multiplicative linear functionals play an important and characterizing role. And morphisms between unital sea star algebras, they're given by algebra homomorphisms that preserve both the unit and the star operation. And so therefore the foundation of non commutative geometry is, is the Gelfand Narmach theorem, because this pretty, this gives you that every unital commutative c star algebra is star isomorphic to c of x for some compact hell star space x. And so therefore, by analogy, the non commutative spaces exist in correspondence with the non commutative sea star algebras.
00:14:57.514 - 00:15:31.256, Speaker C: And so one example is that while the complex numbers are star isomorphic to the space of continuous complex valued function for a singleton. But on the other hand, if I just take the vertices in the Sierpinski gasket, well, that is not a compact housedorp space. And so therefore the space of continuous complex valued functions over the vertices is not a unital c star algebra has.
00:15:31.280 - 00:15:37.544, Speaker A: A unit unit, all means it includes the identity, what is the unit? What's the unit?
00:15:37.664 - 00:16:58.814, Speaker C: It would be the constant. Okay, so our generalization of differentiable structure from non commutative geometry is that given by spectral triples which are due to con, and so a spectral triple, the main ingredients are, are, first of all unital sea star algebra. Hilbert space unital representation of the sea star algebra is bounded operators on the Hilbert space and a distinguished operator on that Hilbert space with the following properties. So, in analogy with the denseness of c, one functions in C of X. The set of elements in the sea star algebra for which the commutator with this operators densely defined and extends to a bounded operator in the Hilbert space, is dense in the C star algebra, and the operator has compact resolvent. And what this does is that it allows you via the methods from non quant geometry to extract information like non quant analogs of metric and measure. And so when the representation is also faithful, then all these ingredients together can be called a spectral triple and the operator a Dirac operator.
00:16:58.814 - 00:17:57.906, Speaker C: So, non commutative geometry via spectral triples can be viewed as a kind of non commutative riemannian geometry. And that is because in the prototypical setting of a compact spin riemannian manifold, Kahn showed that the geodesic distance can be recovered through purely operator algebraic data. So in that particular setting, there is really the choices of C star algebra and Hilbert space and Dirac operator are uniquely determined. And so then outside of that setting, there's some choice in this. And that's part of the art in non communicative geometry is choosing these elements so as to be able to capture the geometry of a space or equip a space with a geometry, sorry, what.
00:17:57.930 - 00:18:02.010, Speaker A: Are the subscripts infinity on the d and the h in the last line there?
00:18:02.202 - 00:19:07.310, Speaker C: Oh, well, in this case I'm thinking of the Sierpinski gasket. So this is just for, on the entire space. So maybe I should have removed, I should have removed that. Yeah. So you can see that for a fractal, that the usual definition of geodesic distance can be a problem because it requires the existence of sufficiently well behaved paths. And so this is a motivation for developing spectral triples for studying fractality, is because therefore that obstruction is no longer an issue. Okay, so do there exist spectral triples for fractal curves, and do they capture the geometry of such curves in a sufficiently interesting way? Well, yes, there do exist such spectral triples.
00:19:07.310 - 00:20:21.198, Speaker C: So one example would be Lapidus Sarhad spectral triples, and they are built from spectral triples for circles and so each, so these spectral triples are the following forms. So for the unital sea star algebra, take the algebra of two PI r periodic functions. On the real line, take the l two functions with respect to normalized Lebang measure, take this canonical orthonormal basis and this differential operator, define it on that basis and take its closure. And then for the representation, take that of left multiplication operators, so that spectral triple is built from spectral triples of this form for circles. And so for a piecewise c, one fractal curve for each parameterized curve, take one of these spectral triples for circles. And so you need to adjust each of the Dirac operators so as to maintain the compact resolvent condition. So that's the reason for the translation, and you have to adjust the representation.
00:20:21.198 - 00:21:15.094, Speaker C: So you do have a composition with the parameterized curves. And so what Lapidus and Sarhad showed is that this countable direct sum of spectral triples is in fact a spectral triple. So that's something that's not by necessity, but it is also importantly one that recovers the geodesic distance. And so for geometry in general, that's the essential idea, the essential importance of these spectral triples. And so, in fact, these spectral triples are generalization. So in the case of the Sierpinski gasket, they are exactly spectral triples that were developed by Antonescu, Christensen and Lapidus. In that particular case, and in that particular setting, the same spectral triple captures not only the geodesic distance, but also the Hausdorff dimension and the Hausdorff measure.
00:21:15.094 - 00:22:54.352, Speaker C: So again, a lot of key multiple key aspects of the fractality of these spaces so, that said, is there a way to approximate such a spectral triple by spectral triples supported on simpler spaces? And, well, that requires. So we use a generalization of grammar Pahlstorf distance, developed by our collaborator La Tremolier, who was in turn building on the work of Riefel. And he recently extended this generalization of Hausdorff distance to the setting of spectral triples, and appropriately termed it the spectral propinquity. And so, our main result informally is that if we have a piecewise c one fractal curve, so we've got parameterization, and we have our notion of approximation sequence compatible with that parameterization, then the Lapidus Sarhad spectral triple on each of those corresponding finite graphs converges in the sense of the spectral propinquity to the Lapidus Sarhad spectral triple on the limiting piecewise c one fractal curve. So that generalization of Graumov Hausdorff distance is actually. So it was first defined on quantum analogs of compact metric spaces. And these quantum analogs of compact metric spaces are due to reflect, and they can be viewed as generalizations of Lipschitz algebra.
00:22:54.352 - 00:23:31.054, Speaker C: So that's something to keep in mind as I go through the elements of the definition. So, a quantum compact metric space is a pairing of the unital sea star algebra, and you have a seminorm, and the semi norm satisfies a form of Leibniz inequality. And also it vanishes precisely on scalar multiples of the identity and then the associated Monchkonorovitch distance that tries as the weak star topology of the state space, by which I mean the set of positive linear functions of normal.
00:23:36.734 - 00:23:39.102, Speaker D: Be like the Lipschitz constant, you said.
00:23:39.238 - 00:24:28.790, Speaker C: Right, so this is an analogy to the Lipschitz semi norm. Okay, so, yeah, so l is a semi norm. And so in the particular. Yeah, great. So this is a semi norm that in this more general setting, these properties are those that we want to carry into the non commutative setting. And so when that seminorm exhibits all those properties with respect to the CSer algebra, then that pairing qualifies as a quantum compact metric space. And so, non commutative geometry, via quantum compact metric spaces can be viewed as a non commutative metric geometry.
00:24:28.790 - 00:25:31.550, Speaker C: And that's because here the prototype is a compact metric space, and all compact metric spaces are also quantum compact metric spaces. So here the unital c star algebra being c of x, and the seminorm being the Lipschitz semi norm for the metric. But of course, you could still equip C of x with other choices of semi norm. And that would define different quantum compact metric spaces, so long as that suite of properties in the definition are satisfied. And to me, another important thing is that, so, this map, the Gelfand transform, it's an isometry onto its image. So in that sense, the state space captures the metric information from the compact metric space. To me, even in the commutative setting, then here's this enriched perspective of the original space.
00:25:31.550 - 00:26:36.860, Speaker C: And so, even further, developing tools from non commutric geometry would allow you to extract information from this enriched perspective. And so that's where, as a fractal geometer, I'm also very interested in further developing these techniques. And for me, this is also a very important development in this, is that. So, in the case of the canner set. So Aguilar and Lopez, they were able to show that they were able to define different seminorms, that when you take their, when you equip the state space of c of x for x, the counter set with these, with their corresponding Mandakanorovich metrics, you get, they agree on the space of characters, but they disagree on a dense subset outside of the space of characters. And so these are different. So they capture still the metric information for this space.
00:26:36.860 - 00:27:25.298, Speaker C: But there's this additional sort of structure and perspective. So, for this generalization of gramma of housed Earth distance to the setting of non key of geometry, we have a notion of quantum isometry and what a full quantum isometry does. It's a star isomorphism between the sea star algebras that at the level of the state spaces, each equipped with their corresponding montocarnorovich metrics, gives rise to an isometry at that level. And the gramma of house perpinuity, La.
00:27:25.386 - 00:27:28.934, Speaker D: And lb sort of commute with the two back BFI.
00:27:29.434 - 00:27:30.730, Speaker C: Commute with the what?
00:27:30.882 - 00:27:59.354, Speaker D: I mean, with different bag BFI of elements. Yeah, I'm asking whether, I'm trying to wonder whether, why you really impose this condition of mount control distance and not directly the level of these differentiated differential operator enveloping.
00:28:00.214 - 00:28:19.794, Speaker C: Well, I think here it would be because I'm viewing the state space as equipped with this Mondkanu Ravitch metric. And so that's at the level at which I would like the isometries. So.
00:28:21.934 - 00:28:26.354, Speaker D: Okay, I'm fine. We'll just understand.
00:28:27.774 - 00:28:33.086, Speaker C: Well, of course, there's also lots more for me to understand too, and to ask experts.
00:28:33.230 - 00:28:55.914, Speaker D: Yeah, basically, I guess what I was asking also. Phi. Yeah, sorry. So I guess I was trying to understand the weather. So you have Phi that takes elements in a and returns elements in b. And you could ask whether phi of l of a, of some guy is the same as l of b of phi of that guy.
00:28:56.534 - 00:29:01.714, Speaker C: Well, you can do it in either direction. It can be done in either direction.
00:29:02.494 - 00:29:03.094, Speaker D: Okay.
00:29:03.174 - 00:30:06.244, Speaker C: Yeah. So actually, when you do the calculation, you do have to check it for both directions. So, and the gramopha. And in again, an analogy with the classical setting, this non commutative generalization of Gramoph Hausdorf distance, the Gromoff Hausdorff propinquity is, is a complete metric on the space of all quantum compact metric spaces. And what is distance zero mean for this non cumulative metric? Well, then it means that there exists a full quantum isometry between the two quantum compact metric spaces. And also remember that all compact metric spaces can also be associated to quantum compact metric spaces. So it turns out that when I restrict to such quantum compact metric spaces, the topology induced by the grammar pals DER propinquity agrees with the topology of the grammar of Hausdorff distance.
00:30:08.544 - 00:30:10.280, Speaker A: Sorry, you said agrees with. But you haven't.
00:30:10.312 - 00:30:39.116, Speaker C: Well, it can be, you have an inequality here that looks okay, not agrees. It recovers. Recovers, yeah. Right. So recovers. And that's actually a very. There, there's some things to be worked out about that still, because of that.
00:30:39.140 - 00:30:56.738, Speaker A: Inequality, this seems to say that x the metric spaces, the embeddings of the metric spaces into the spaces of functions are. I'm actually confused, but continuous. This seems to continuity of some embedding. No.
00:30:56.866 - 00:31:39.638, Speaker C: Right. So you can recover the topology. And I'm. And so here, I'm including detail I don't normally too much include, but because we have a lot of Gromov housed Earth distance people here. I mean, so when you do Gromov housed Earth distance calculations. And you can, you know, for the, for two compact metric spaces, for their disjoint union, define a metric on them. So when you do, when you calculate the gramma of house derp, propinquity between two quantum compact metric spaces is, there's a sort of general procedure by which you start.
00:31:39.638 - 00:32:46.864, Speaker C: So you can always make a, you begin making a unital c star algebra. You can begin by taking their count of their direct sum. And for your choice of seminorm, you can put the two seminorms you want. But then this part here, that's where every setting is going to be different. So this choice of this third component is going to be very different for each different setting. And in our particular setting are the conditions that we put on the vertices were such as to be able to get what we needed in this case. And when you do the calculations, one of the things you can use is it turns out that for that, when you've chosen the right, when you've made the right choice of third quantum compact metric space, then the Hausdorff distance for the state space of that quantum compact metric space with respect to the monjkan or metric for that seminorm, that gives you a bound on the grammar of Haustor propinquity between the two quantum compact metric spaces.
00:32:46.864 - 00:33:47.630, Speaker C: So again, these are by analogy and not perfect. Okay, so the spectral propinquity is not defined on all spectral triples. It's defined on a special class of spectral triples. It is those which induce quantum compact metric space structure. And so if you start off with a spectral triple, a natural quantum compact metric space, to see if you can associate to it is to take first the unital sea star algebra, and then for the semi norm, take the norm of the commutator with the Dirac operator. And if that semi norm, you know, with respect to the unit of c star algebra, satisfies the properties required for a quantum compact metric space, then your spectral triple is a metric spectral triple. And so for this class of spectral triples, the spectral propinquity is a metric on that class.
00:33:47.630 - 00:35:07.596, Speaker C: And it still remains to be seen what other additional properties this metric might have on such a class. So what does distance zero for the spectral propinquity between two metric spectral triples give you? Well, it gives you unitary equivalence between the Dirac operators. It also tells you how well the representations play with each other, and also the underlying quantum compact metric spaces, it also gives you that level. They're fully quantum isometric. And so when you, given the role of the Dirac operator in non commutative rumanian geometry for extracting geometric information, then having this level of unitary equivalence between the Dirac operators is one of the motivations for, for applying this metric to the study and approximation of spectral triggers. Okay, so here is a more formal statement of our results. So, first, keeping in mind the particular setting of the Sierpinski gasket, we have a parameterization of it, because it can be, it's an example of a piecewise c one fractal curve.
00:35:07.596 - 00:36:31.916, Speaker C: We have an approximation sequence compatible with that parameterization. We take each of the Lapidus Sarhad spectral triple constructions on the corresponding sequence of finite graphs, as well as that on the Sierpinski gasket, and each of those spectral triples happens to be a metric spectral triple. So they each induce quantum compact metric space structure. And then with respect to the spectral propinquity, each of these spectral triples more, gets closer and closer, or approximates that on the limiting fractal, the surface and our argument. So we came up with our framework, and our arguments are such that if you replace the Serpentski gasket with any piecewise c one fractal curve and any approximation sequence that has the properties that we gave in our definition, the same arguments still hold. So our arguments hold for any piecewise c one fractal curve for which you can identify an approximation sequence. Okay, so here are, so I've worked on the setting of the stretch Sierkinski gasket.
00:36:31.916 - 00:37:17.954, Speaker C: So the stretch Sierpinski gasket is another important example of an analysis on fractals, but it's one on which there is a lot of active results going on. So you can see already that instead of being self similar, it's self affine, but in a way, and it's natural to try to see what results from the Sierpinski gasket can be generalized as setting up the stretch Sierpinski gasket, because it's in a way a sort of relaxation, because one way to get it is to replace each of the vertices in the Sierpinski gasket with intervals of a certain length. And that's what this alpha parameter controls.
00:37:18.254 - 00:37:24.114, Speaker A: Sorry, why do you say it's self affine but not self similar? It sort of looks self similar.
00:37:24.634 - 00:38:08.584, Speaker C: Well, oh, I didn't mean self affine. Okay, the iterated function system, some of the iterates are not contraction mappings. So, so you can't, so actually, okay, when you define this then, so it's not self affine. So it's not. So it is self similar. But when one of the ways to define this via iterated function system is there are six contraction mappings. And so again, starting off with a triangle, and you map for the first three, that triangle to each of these and then to an interval for each one.
00:38:08.584 - 00:38:10.924, Speaker C: So you collapse it to.
00:38:15.104 - 00:38:16.292, Speaker D: Those edges.
00:38:16.488 - 00:38:16.924, Speaker A: I see.
00:38:16.964 - 00:38:19.584, Speaker D: If you pick out the edges, then it would still.
00:38:20.124 - 00:38:24.344, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, I see the edges of the hexagon.
00:38:24.644 - 00:38:41.632, Speaker C: Yeah, well, so the edge. So a lot of the problems come from the edges. So also, besides making it sort of fundamentally different media that would model this, it's also, this is not a piecewise c one fractal curve because the vertices are not dense and.
00:38:41.788 - 00:38:42.328, Speaker A: All right.
00:38:42.416 - 00:38:50.004, Speaker C: Yeah. And so it does have fractional housedorf dimension. Unfortunately, it depends on that parameter alpha.
00:38:51.064 - 00:38:52.984, Speaker A: Sorry, what is that? What is the alpha here?
00:38:53.104 - 00:38:57.336, Speaker C: So the alpha determines how small the.
00:38:57.360 - 00:38:58.320, Speaker A: Triangles are in the corners.
00:38:58.392 - 00:39:02.204, Speaker C: Well, how small these intervals are. So as alpha goes to zero.
00:39:02.984 - 00:39:05.776, Speaker A: I see, then the intervals shorter and shorter.
00:39:05.880 - 00:40:02.914, Speaker C: Right. So that's something that's in a paper, too, is actually even the Hausdorff distance, the housework distance convergence. So that's, Patricia Alonzo Ruiz and Utta Freiberg showed that. And so one of the things I've worked out is that also that parameter goes to zero. So Andrea Rousa Rivera, so she showed that the Lapidus Sarhad spectral triple on the strettserpinski gasket, so that that construction can be adapted to the stretch Serpentsky gasket to get a spectral triple. So I showed that that spectral triple that as the primer goes to zero, then it approaches for the spectral propinquity. The lab Betasar had spectral triple on Sierpinski gasket.
00:40:02.914 - 00:41:25.690, Speaker C: And, well, what I'd like to do is figure out, you know, use this as a prototype for definition of a class of almost piecewise c one factorial curves. So here's the Sierpinski tetrahedron. So, okay, what would be an appropriate generalization or construction? What would be an appropriate spectral triple for Sierpinski tetrahedron, along with a notion of approximation? And what would be a spectral triple that captures essential aspects of this geometry and along with the appropriate notion of approximation? And for me, this is kind of one of my holy grails is the Sierpinski carpet. And, well, Sierpinski carpets are fundamentally different from Sierpinski gaskets. There isn't, you know, the same tools that can be applied to Sierpinski gasket type fractals can't be applied to Sierpinski carpet type fractals. And one of the main ways to see the difficulties. So Sierpinski gaskets, you can remove, you can totally disconnect the fractal by removing a finite set of points, but that is impossible for Sierpinski carpet type fractals.
00:41:25.690 - 00:42:22.734, Speaker C: So they're example of infinitely ramified fractals. And so, in a sense, a lot of tools that I tried to acquire this year have been things that I hoped would help me in eventually developing spectral triples on Sierpinski carpets. And that's everything from early in this year wanting to learn about quasi symmetries, because there are a lot of quasi so these are, here's another sort of homeomorph. These are round serpentsuit carpets at the bottom and those are homeomorphic to Sierpinski carpets. So there are many different quasi isometry classes of those. And also there's a spectral triple involving limit sets of clinian groups. And that's what, so these are all sort of like tools that I've wanted to, that I've been working on trying to acquire for eventually Sierpinski carpet type fractals.
00:42:22.734 - 00:43:48.864, Speaker C: And so, see, other directions are future words. So, well again, there is this idea of how to come up with the right notion of generalization of manifolds that would include fractals. There's classification of sea star algebras on fractals. So my original motivation for this was, well, with respect to the Gelfand Nimark theorem, if you have c of X for X of Cantor set, then that star isomorphic to enable commutative approximately finite algebras. But outside of that setting, so even for serpiency gaskets, it's not known what kinds of sea star algebras those are. And so of course from getting to be here and getting to be in George's group, I hope to now I think I might try to see how I could use elements from classification for identifying and studying such c star algebras. And of course this would also help one, since these are key ingredients in quantum compact metric spaces and in spectral triples, then that would also be a basis for the further development of fractal manifold via means for non cognitive geometry.
00:43:48.864 - 00:44:43.084, Speaker C: And then lastly, well are defining instances of fractality that are in a sense truly non commutative. Are there fractals that can only occur in a non commutative setting? So for instance, the grammar of Hauster propinquity is a complete metric. Well, we have a complete metric. Maybe you could define, you could take the right sort of set of contraction mappings and define, could you define an interesting enough like fractal space with respect to that complete quantum metric? So that's just an example. But because there's so many non equivalent definitions of fractality, then there are a lot of possibilities for their definition and study and understanding. Thank you.
00:44:47.984 - 00:44:49.584, Speaker D: Thank you for that beautiful talk.
00:44:49.704 - 00:44:59.424, Speaker A: Are there quest? Let's see, are there questions from the online audience? Nicola has a question from me in the room.
00:45:03.404 - 00:45:08.324, Speaker D: Yeah, thank you very much for this nice overview. I was wondering, is there a way.
