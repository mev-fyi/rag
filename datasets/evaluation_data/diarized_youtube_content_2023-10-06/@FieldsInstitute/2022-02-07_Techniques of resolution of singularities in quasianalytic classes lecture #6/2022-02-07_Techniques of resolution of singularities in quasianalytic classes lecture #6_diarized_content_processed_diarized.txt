00:00:00.200 - 00:00:41.704, Speaker A: Not listen to my good. Okay, so let's start. So good morning, or good afternoon everyone. So if there's any question, you can just ask it right away. As usual, put up your microphone and ask for today I'm going to talk about monomenization of morphins. So the third and last technique that I wanted to present in the course. So today it's all about examples, statement, and then we're going to make considerations on the target to talk about some of the qualitative difficulties involved and what they mean, what kind of consequences they have for the problem.
00:00:41.704 - 00:02:33.764, Speaker A: So I want to start with somehow a vague question here that we're going to precise in a moment, but I want to start with a vague. So given proper qmorphism, is there a resolution of it? For now, we treated the case essentially a function, and we look at it in a very specific case of the zero locals of the function, because, as we said, our original interest was in the set, which was defined in the quasi analytic set, but was defined by the zero set of that function. But we can, of course ask this question for a general morphism, and in this case we're not only fixing on the zero locals, but we also are considering morphes, which have several entries, not only just one entry. And maybe the root of this question can go back, which is a vague question for now, to the problem of factorization of bi rational morphisms, which go back to Zaryski, at least, at least Zarinsky 58. So it's the first time that the question appears in a concrete way, or that actually approved in a concrete way for the case of surfaces, the two dimensional case. So it's a particular kind of morph is here by rational morphism. And there is a notion of what this resolution here, which is yet to be defined as.
00:02:33.764 - 00:04:14.698, Speaker A: And since then there are some sort of bifurcations of what this question should mean. That kind of depends on the applications that one is interested in. So we can go back to the notion of monomization, which goes back to Ironaka, but also you can go even a little bit back. This notion already appears, at least in papers of Abianka 65. I think you have the notion of development of what is called semi stable reduction, which goes back to work of the lean of Mumford around the seventies. And I can also want to cite the notion of the modern notion of relative dissingularization, which was recently introduced by Abramovich and Rhodarchic here in 2020. And these are all different notions of what this resolution might, might mean for us, which we haven't defined yet.
00:04:14.698 - 00:06:18.714, Speaker A: But we're going to focus on the notion of monorization coming from Ironaka and Abianka, kind of because there is expected applications at the time for super analytic geometry for us to plas analytic and else. So we do, we do in part, this is one of the interests here, is that we know that we're going to choose the kind of dissingularization or notion of resolution of the morphine which interests you as the most. And this is basically what we want to apply. And so the question in a more precise way then can be formulated as let phi of mn be a proper eumorphism. Is there a diagram, a commutative diagram? Here is your PI, here's a tau, and here's some phi cuba. So this is commutative, where the sigma and the tau that we're making are finite sequences of blowing up. And this fit, Judah, should be as simple as possible.
00:06:18.714 - 00:06:57.254, Speaker A: So the notion that we're going to give here is what we are going to call monomial. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to start in the next part. So this is the question that we're asking here. I'm going to start by defining what monomial means for us and what are some properties that it is for. Now, we can just think of it as being like the simplest. And this is the kind of heuristic I'm going to try to follow the simplest kind of morphins that we can hope to obtain. And then we're going to state the main results and give some answers to this question, at least in this setting, in this category.
00:06:57.254 - 00:08:02.004, Speaker A: So I'm going to start by precisely what I mean by monomial. And I want to kind of build up from an intuition in order just to get to the final, to the final, but to the working definition that we're going to use. So, let's do a first approximation. What it should mean, right. We take phi of M in n. We fix such that locally at a, at a point a, we have coordinate systems such as we are used to. So coordinate systems in the source and target.
00:08:02.004 - 00:09:01.454, Speaker A: And this time I'm not going to focus, not yet, at least in the exceptional divisor. So let's just make things simpler. Some coordinate systems we just like to take, uh, a and let's say xz at phi of a. My call it b, such that. Well, what we want is that the answers Xi are just going to be given by polynomials as we are used to and maybe I'm introducing these other variables that just to say that they are going to be terms which are equal to zero, I want to admit, I don't want necessarily that all of the entries are non zero. It's fine to admit some of the entries being equal to zero. So here, one, say, choose from P.
00:09:01.454 - 00:09:18.400, Speaker A: And now, and I'm going to use a strange notation here. S prime. But it's going to make sense later on when I actually define what I want to know, morphisms. But this is kind of the first approximation. We want some sort of morphism that. Well, every entry is a monomial. This seems to fit the description of what we want.
00:09:18.400 - 00:09:47.104, Speaker A: Monomial morphism. Now, let me start by saying, by like arguing that this is not yet good enough, that we want more, more properties. So let's start with a non example. So the non example, I'm going to give you this. We consider something from r to r two. Very simple, that takes u. And that sends into.
00:09:47.104 - 00:10:10.124, Speaker A: What did I take two or u three to u three. U three. U two. So what is going on here is that you have r. You are sending it to two reals. You're sending it to two reals. And the image of the morph is now.
00:10:10.124 - 00:10:49.034, Speaker A: Is going to be a. Is going to be a cusp. Right? So in here it's going to appear that. Oops. That phi of r is going to be contained, actually equal, in this case, through, um, x squared minus y, third equals zero. So in the notion of the simplest possible morpheus that we can take this. This does not yet correspond, because I can see that the image is yet singular at this point.
00:10:49.034 - 00:11:07.170, Speaker A: Right. And I would like. Sorry. Yes, go ahead. Yes, sorry. Just to make sure things precise, that you, in your definition, Phi of, um, is equal to x z or something like that. Right, sorry.
00:11:07.170 - 00:11:18.690, Speaker A: Let me maybe, let me. Right, there's no x here. Right. This is x and. Yes, yes. Right. This coordinates.
00:11:18.690 - 00:12:18.364, Speaker A: Okay, so x z coordinates that. And also in the definition of monomial morphism. Oh, yeah, I haven't yet given the definition. What I did is like, I'm saying, like, this is the first approximation, so maybe it should be a little bit more specific if there's doubt. So we fix some coordinate system at a point a and some coordinate systems at the image, so that when we do this. So in here, maybe I could add one more point here. When I write like this, I should really mean that I'm pulling back Xi and I'm making this slight abuse of notation.
00:12:18.364 - 00:12:41.264, Speaker A: Does that clarify? Yes. Thank you. Okay. Right. So coming back to. So this is not yet definition, and one of the reasons for it is that if I just ask for this, then I'm asking that the target could be complicated, it could be singular, for example, in this case. So I don't want to dimit things like this.
00:12:41.264 - 00:14:00.520, Speaker A: This means that I want to define, I can see that it's going to be, the image is going to be contained in something of dimension one here. And this is related to the rank. So I just want to define, I want to make this remark and define what is called generic rank. The little remark here is that if the rank of phi is constant, equal to r, then the image is an immersed, not embedded, locally embedded, but globally immersed q submanifold dimension, or. So this is what is happening at this morpheus outside of zero. So outside of zero, the morph is of rank one, and therefore it is contained into some manifold analytics of manifold algebra of dimension one. So it's going to be interesting for us.
00:14:00.520 - 00:14:34.584, Speaker A: It's already an information here to define what we're going to call the generic rank. I'm going to call it this, the phi. So phi a, the generic rank. This is going to be the rank of the Jacogon matrix of the phi at the point a. So as a germ at a. And this rank is not at the evaluation of the point. So I'm not evaluating phi at a and looking at the germ at a.
00:14:34.584 - 00:15:13.672, Speaker A: So this rank here is not in respect to the field given by r, but actually in respect to the fractional field of the quasi analytic functions that we're considering the point. So in the example here, we're just taking the jacobian. So just to, for the example, the jacobian of phi of a or phi of zero. Sorry, this is just the derivative here. So it's three u squared u. And we see that the rank of this matrix is equal to one in respect to the frac, right? In respect to the. We don't even have the frac, just in respect to quasi analytic functions.
00:15:13.672 - 00:16:04.624, Speaker A: It's not equivalent, equal to zero, any one of the entries. So since there's something which is not equivalent, equal to zero, the rank is one. So one of the things that we're going to want is that based on this generic rank, we would like the image of phi to be possibly an analytic set, a smooth analytic set, not a singular analytic set, where the dimension is going to be given by this generic rank just as if the rank was constant. We'll get it. So when we mark, we call it generic because outside of a set of measure zero, actually a quasi analytic set, a proper quasi analytic set, the rank is going to be constant, maximal, equal to this number that we're defining here, the actual rank is going to be constant, equal to this. That's why it's called generic. Fair enough.
00:16:04.624 - 00:17:01.134, Speaker A: Now let's move on to a second example before giving the definition where I'm going to build up on this, on this idea, and I'm going to think about another property that we would like. So example two, now let's look at an example that should be ammonomial market, and I'm going to take u one, u two, I'm going to send it to u one, u one, u two to the power 30. So this is something that I would like to be. This does look like a monomorph. So everything is entering and kind of based on what we're saying should look at what is going on in the target. Right? So here's z equals zero. So I do know that the image of this file is going to be containing z equals zero.
00:17:01.134 - 00:18:13.670, Speaker A: But if I take here some little compact set, the image of it is going to give us a wedge like this. So it's not going to be true that the image is going to be something of dimension, of it's going to be an analytic set. So this is to kind of highlight that what we're going to ask the property that we want is that the image of PI is contained in an analytic supermanifold quasi analytics, sorry, q submanifold for proof. In particular, let me stress this out of dimension equal to this generic rank. At that point I. So at least locally this is going to be true. The generic rank of this we can compute is going to be equal to two.
00:18:13.670 - 00:18:38.422, Speaker A: It corresponds, and this is the heuristic that we can use, it corresponds to the maximum rank over an open end set of r two here. So if we take points outside of u, one equals zero, u two equals zero. Actually just u two equals zero is enough. Then the rank of the, of the jacobian is going to be equal to two. So that's why the generic rank is also equal to two. So this property is something that we do want here. We want it to be as simple as possible.
00:18:38.422 - 00:19:33.234, Speaker A: And this is something that we can obtain, we cannot obtain in general. That's going to be exactly an analog set, but that is containing a good one. Now, a second thing that this example is going to tell us that we would like to have is that if we consider another property that I want monomial morphins to satisfy that it is open, because I'm not going to work in the algebraic case where I have a fine open set. So if we consider a translation I want to a equal to say zero psi with xi different from zero. Then we consider a change of coordinates. Let u equals to u one. And I'm going to give a bad name, it's kind of on purpose.
00:19:33.234 - 00:20:21.834, Speaker A: V cube equals to u two minus psi. So this new coordinate system is centered at a right. At v zero, we have u two equals psi. As u equals zero, we have u one equals zero. That's, that's the point a. And in this coordinate systems, when I take like this, what I obtain is the morph is given by u u times v tilde plus psi to the power 30. So in the definition of monomial morpheus, if I want the property to be open, I probably need to admit situations of this form.
00:20:21.834 - 00:21:22.864, Speaker A: But I can still make this a little bit better. This is not the best kind of form that I can do because by an implicit function theorem we may consider, let's say maybe I should have. Okay, this is a bit annoying, but I'm gonna write this nine plus v equals to where this is just psi to the power three. But by the implicit function theorem, I might still make a change of coordinates of this form. Right. The derivative in respect to v tilde of this, of this part here is different from zero because psi is different from zero. So I can make a change of coordinate so that it becomes like this with the first entry meaning this eta.
00:21:22.864 - 00:22:45.626, Speaker A: So once we do that, we obtain that phi u v is going to be of the form u u v plus eta zero. This is kind of the situation that I'm going to admit as a monomer morphis later on. Okay, yeah. So maybe let me jump to the definition now, which is going to give us, which is going to have this true property taken care of. Okay, so now is the destination. We're going to say that, and I'm going to do it with the divisor of Md to ne is monomial at a, which is n in m if there exists coordinate systems, just as usual. But now I'm going to actually introduce some new letters that we're going to play some rule later on.
00:22:45.626 - 00:23:46.164, Speaker A: So the u continue to be the variables which are exceptional, but in between the non exceptional variables, I'm going to also consider differences between v and w. And this is much more of a technical thing because later on in the proof is going to be interesting to, to separate the non exceptional variable in two kinds, which I'm going to write, I'm going to come back to what they mean in a second at a. So here e is the product of the UI is equal to zero eno d. Sorry. The exceptional divisor is the source. And I'm also going to take XYZ also in the target. It's going to be convenient to have some difference here, y one y q.
00:23:46.164 - 00:24:29.544, Speaker A: And here again is for a technical reason, which I'm going to explain in a second. And here I'm going to take e plus one s prime at phi of a. And the e is going to be the product of, oops, maybe two smaller. Yeah. Is the product of the Xci's and the y js equals to zero. So all the x and y are exceptional variables now, okay. Zero non exceptions such that.
00:24:29.544 - 00:25:43.722, Speaker A: And now we have what we want, the normal form that we expect x j is equal to u to the power alpha j j equals to one. Upon qp, the y is kick are going to be of the form u to the power beta k v k plus x e k equals to one over key. So here I'm admitting this, this necessary change of coordinates. And that's why I'm calling them y instead of x. And then the z might b equals to vl for L equals to k plus one up until s. And otherwise it's going to be zero for l equals to s plus one to this s prime that enter there. Okay, I have to add conditions here so that we have the two properties that we wanted.
00:25:43.722 - 00:27:11.054, Speaker A: So being open is going to be kind of, I'm going to follow just because I'm admitting here this VK plus CK. But let me just go by a bit so that I can continue where the alpha J's and the beta ks are multi indexes. As we are used to the Ck, they are non zero real numbers. And now the two properties, two extra properties that are going to be useful for us. So the most important one here is that alpha one alpha pull linearly independent. And I'm going to write a second before explaining the first. I also want the bk to be q, the q nothing cause analytic q in the set of rational numbers linearly dependent with the alphas.
00:27:11.054 - 00:28:26.622, Speaker A: Let me just first explain the first condition and then I'm going to talk a little bit about the second. So the first condition, it guarantees that our first example, the non example, was really a non example. If we look at the first condition that we had, the first example that we had u three, u two, then the multi indexes that are appearing here is three and two. They are not q linearly independent, of course. So this is not going to be accepted as a monomer morphism, as a matter of fact, because of property one, property one is enough in order to claim that what we want, one of the properties that we want. So let me write it down. Properties one imply that the image of phi is locally contained in a smooth, pure sort manifold.
00:28:26.622 - 00:29:18.884, Speaker A: Of course, this is movement, just stressing this off dimension given by the generic rank. So the rank that the dimension that it showed, the minimal dimension that the minimal, in terms of the topology dimension that one can expect, right? Just like in this second example, it was containing z equals zero. So this first property here just means that. So this is one of the properties. The second property is the monomial with an open property. And this is simply from the fact that we are admitting this v case plus c case. That can happen.
00:29:18.884 - 00:30:25.552, Speaker A: Now, just to explain a bit why the second property, the second property is to some extent not necessary, but very convenient, so that we have the best possible normal forms to get the best possible normal forms that one can obtain. If we don't use this, then we could have normal forms that could still be simplified. That's kind of the idea. So let me do this. Present this with an example, a clear example why we are adding two. So we take amorphous from r three to r two. Let me take here u one, u two v, and I'm going to send it to u one, u two square u one square u two v plus one.
00:30:25.552 - 00:30:56.024, Speaker A: Because why not? There we go. So in this case, the, the terms that are appearing here, right, we're taking alpha equals to one two, and this beta equals to two one. So the beta is linear independent with alpha. It's not satisfying condition two. And what you could do in this kind of situation is that you can still simplify the normal form that we obtain. So we can simplify by taking a change of parts. Consider.
00:30:56.024 - 00:31:23.328, Speaker A: So, andre, before you continue too much, uh, I want to, um, what's the relation between the different numbers rspq and the generic rank of phi? Can we read it off from the expression directly? Yes. It's going to be p. It's going to be p. Okay. Plus plus s. P plus s. Yeah.
00:31:23.328 - 00:31:56.734, Speaker A: All of the v's contribute, if you think of the, of the matrix. Right, the jacobian matrix. You're all going to have an entry, different entry for every time that you derive v a unique entry which is non zero, and for the use I'm going to, you can use the fact that they are q linear independent. So you're going to have p coming from this part and then s coming from each one of the v's. So it's p plus s. Okay, thanks. So you consider u one equals two.
00:31:56.734 - 00:32:48.768, Speaker A: Got lost again? Yes. U one v plus one minus two over three and u two equals to u two v plus one one over three. So these are changes of coordinates which locally are perfectly fine. So that now your morph is in terms of u one tilde, u two tilde, and this v is going to be just u one tilde, u two tilde squared, u one tilde square. Oops, oops, too fast. U two tilde. So now the v doesn't appear anymore.
00:32:48.768 - 00:33:57.944, Speaker A: So we use the fact that alpha and beta are not linear independent to say that we can make a change of coordinates that can be absorbed into the monoliths so that the coordinate v actually did not need to appear. The morph is going to be independent of this v. And this also explains now what is the reason why we have, sorry, I go too fast from one slide to the other, but what is the reason why we are singling out the w here? The w are things which are not appearing in the normal forms of the morphe. We call it phi free variables because phi does not depend on them. So it's going to be going to come back, this w, the importance of this w in the last lecture, when I talk about the proof itself. So for now, it seems just technical, but when we talk about the proof is going to clarify about the monetization problem, about why it's interesting to single out this w variable. For now, it's just introducing notation.
00:33:57.944 - 00:34:50.024, Speaker A: There was nothing to prove here. Okay, fair enough. We talked about the properties. So now let me talk about the main results. Let me start with the literature. So first of all, it's not in the literature, but the case of dimension, of the target of dimension one is essentially resolution of similarities. But we're going to see the proof in details later on.
00:34:50.024 - 00:35:57.004, Speaker A: We need to use hard theorem or something else, but we need to use something about the critical values. But we're going to see it later on. We are also going to see in details the dimension m, one and q. Is the analytic functions or algebraic. Again, I do not know, for I do not know who's the first person to study that. Then if we look at the case dimension of m equals to the dimension of m equal to two, then this was mq desert in analytics. This is a result from two positive results, and king from 92.
00:35:57.004 - 00:37:18.754, Speaker A: If the dimension of m is small or equal to the dimension of n, which is small or equal to three, and q is the algebraic, then this is the result of Kurkowski in a series of papers from 2000 220 15. And we also have local positive results, which I'm also going to be precise, are algebraic. And this again is from Kutkowski from then 1999 to 2017 in a series of papers. So this was, this is kind of the state of the art, was the state of the art, and the problem was originally a problem considering algebraic geometry. So people focus on the algebraic case and sometimes in the analytic case. Now, the results that I want to, that I want to give to you, they're going to be true. Please do the.
00:37:18.754 - 00:38:53.632, Speaker A: Our first result is that. No. What does that mean? It's the answer of the question. So there exists a proper real analytic morphism, PI from m to n. And I think it's interesting to say that the dimension of m is equal to three and the dimension of n is equal to four, which does not admit my global going up. As a matter of fact, the example is a, is a bit stronger than that, in the sense that. Stronger why? Sigma, sorry.
00:38:53.632 - 00:39:54.116, Speaker A: Can be any proper mapping with generic rank one. Il three map of generic rank equals to three. And tal can be any proper bimeromorphic morphism. It particularly blends up with weight. If you coat an after weight, we do it in a way that it still be neuromorphic. You cannot resolve it by using those. So this is the answer saying the original question, as we, as we said, the answer is no.
00:39:54.116 - 00:41:18.044, Speaker A: There is a contra example of it already in the real analytic case. And then the positive result that we're going to give is then a local result. Again, aversa of the truth. Now, let me give you the positive answer to let PI of MD to ne be a proper qmorphism. Then there exists accountable. Yeah, a number of commutative diagrams. And for once I'm going to just go scroll down so that I have theorem in one slide.
00:41:18.044 - 00:42:53.604, Speaker A: So I'm going to have diagrams MD. We had our morphins, Phi going to ne, galamina here, and lambda elonga. And here the phylometer touch that the first thing, just as before, in the local result that we presented, but with a little twist. Sigma lambda and tau lambda are finite compositions of local blows up and power substitutions. We haven't yet defined what power substitutions are for us. And I'm going to do it later on when I, when we arrive at the moment where this is necessary. So the plan is to give examples and to see why this actually is going to be necessary.
00:42:53.604 - 00:44:13.362, Speaker A: In the middle of the general cause analytic case, the second point is sigma, lambda, and lambda are semipropper, as usual. And the third point is that phi lamina are monom. So we get what we wanted, at least in a local way. Yeah, did not think about this because I wanted to have the theorem and discuss about it. So I'm going to do it like this, although it's not the best organized manner to do this, but just a couple of remarks about it. This theorem, if the quad analytic class Q is equal to the analytic or algebraic, then the theorem holds with actually one prime, just as we did the other. Well, no, we did it a little bit different.
00:44:13.362 - 00:44:46.014, Speaker A: Right. It was combinatorial blend up before. Now our finite compositions of local blender. So in the case that it's analytical or algebraic, we don't need power substitutions. And this was the original result of Khudkowski. This is the result that Kurtkowski proves. We follow the power substitutions in the algebraic, in the analytic.
00:44:46.014 - 00:45:22.226, Speaker A: So our result recovers this property. And there is a moment in the proof that I'm going to try to pin out today already, because it's essentially considerations on the target where we're going to see it, this point. So what is the plan for today for the last 55 years? Excuse me. Yes, Andre, you asked also something about that the images of the M lambda cover M or something like that, or. Yes, any proper covering. Yes. Oh, thank you.
00:45:22.226 - 00:45:39.578, Speaker A: Yes, yes, thanks, Fernando. Yes. It should cover everything. Yes. And it should be semi proper. So semi proper recall for every compact set, there exists a compact set in the union of all of the M. Laminder, whose image covers that compact set.
00:45:39.578 - 00:45:58.506, Speaker A: Yeah. As usual, in local monomer, it's. Yeah. Yes, yes. In the local result, it's what Felipe, I learned this from Felipe Cano. That property, then you should call it avoiding singularities instead of resolution. Okay, thank you.
00:45:58.506 - 00:46:44.416, Speaker A: Thank you. Okay, so, okay, so what's the plan for the rest of today? I'm going to focus on considerations on the target. So this will mean that we're going to already talk about why in the analytic case, we don't need power substitutions, but in the quasi analytic case, we do need power substitutions. And the plan is to get to have enough qualitative information to show what the example to show explicitly the example. So this is the plans. So I will start now the third part of the, once we have the results. And later on, what's the later plan? Right.
00:46:44.416 - 00:47:55.368, Speaker A: So Monday I'm planning to talk about then applications of this result, and on Friday about the proof of this result by making a dictionary with what we did with the local resolution. So for the next Friday I'm going to make, I'm going to really use what we did in the previous three courses to make some sort of dictionary between how we treat this case based on that one, which is crisp, kind of a simpler way that our approach works there. Okay, let me pass to the next topic. This is a horrible line. Let me try it again. The first thing I want to consider is the case of dimension of m equals to one. So the source, right.
00:47:55.368 - 00:48:15.624, Speaker A: We have phi from m to n. And I want to look at the case that the dimension of m is equal to one. Let's start with a simple example here. An example is going to be phi from r to r. Two is the example that we already seen. What do we do with it? Right. U.
00:48:15.624 - 00:49:08.134, Speaker A: That goes to, um, what was it again? I think I did u third or u squared mean u third. Right. And it is. Okay, so we're going to do this example and as we saw, we started here and then we send to the r two. And then what we had in the image was a cost, b minus y squared equals p zero. The idea is to transform this curve into a non singular curve. So what we're going to do is that we're going to start by bringing blowing up of the point here.
00:49:08.134 - 00:49:41.466, Speaker A: And we're going to see what we are going to define here. So we will define the blowing up of the point. So we're going to have an exceptional divisor. And then I claim that this curve is going to become, if, you know, resolution of the cusp, you probably know this by heart, but let me just point it out. So if you, if you blow up here, let me just write the expressions. So I'm considering the chart x one. X two equals two.
00:49:41.466 - 00:50:12.190, Speaker A: I need to consider which chart is x one. Chart X one Y one. So in here it's going to appear that this red curve is going to now become x one squared. X one minus Y one squared equals to zero. So there is a component here which is exceptional divisor, which is the x one equals to zero. But now there is a claim that this morph is well defined. Now I can verify this by hand by looking at the expression that I'm obtaining here.
00:50:12.190 - 00:51:00.194, Speaker A: So what does that mean? I mean that I could take x one, and I know that x one is equal to the entry x. Ah, let me do like this. Sorry about this. So x one is equal to x, which is equal to u squared, and y one is equal to y divided by x, which is u three divided by u two, which is equal to u. So now we have the morph is x one is equal to u squared, and y one is going to be equal to, uh, so I do have that. This guy is well defined. But there's a more general reason for this, which uses strongly the fact that we are with dimension of m equals to one, which is the universal property of blowing up.
00:51:00.194 - 00:51:52.176, Speaker A: So the universal property of blowing up says the following. If you take a center of blowing up and take another morphism, and the pullback of the ideal that generated center is principal, then the morph sense factor through the blowing up in here. If the dimension is one, every pullback of every idea that you take here is going to be principal. So that's good. It's always going to function this. So we can, for the case of dimension one here, we can always, just, in a simple way, just make this diagram work. Now we can continue the process because it's still not monomial in the sense that, well, we wanted this, maybe we should have not chosen y but z, because this is not yet an exceptional divisor.
00:51:52.176 - 00:52:44.044, Speaker A: We are not yet converse the exceptional divisor. But if we blow up twice, we're going to get that eventually, or for the same reason, phi two and phi three are going to be well defined. And for the same reason, we're going to get that at the end, or our transformation is going to be now monomial. Ah, it's going to be non singular. So let's look at what happens with the morphism. We take theta two. Oh, I think I made a mistake here.
00:52:44.044 - 00:54:09.334, Speaker A: I wanted this to be y one. Hopefully this is not confusing. Equals to x two, y two, y two. Then we get that the new morph here is going to be given by x two equal to u, y two equal to u, and if we do the last one, and then it doesn't really matter which chart we take, then we're going to get that x three is equal to u and y three is equal to one. And we are one little translation of the target for this to be equal to zero, and to get this little translation here, and to get a monomial morpheus as we want. So the essential thing here was to blow up the target in such a way that the curve that we obtained was nonsingular. But more generally, we take our v of m to n.
00:54:09.334 - 00:55:35.218, Speaker A: Let me simplify this. Let me do it in really one dimension for the, sorry, I wanted even to do the germ so that we really concentrate at a point. If we look at a morph is like at a germ, from something of dimension one to dimension n. So in particular, field zero is equal to zero according to this notation that we just used, the german notation, and we write phi events by one phi n. Then of course, either phi is constant or equal to zero, or apart from a change of coordinates, apart actually from just reordering the indexes, we may suppose that phi, one of u is equal to u to some power alpha times the function g of u, where v of zero is different from zero. Right. I have at least one function that is non zero.
00:55:35.218 - 00:55:58.594, Speaker A: I call it, it might be the c one. Then I factor out it's one dimensional, so I can factor out the power u as much as I can. And whatever is left is a unit. And the unit is quasi analytic, because quasi analytic classes are closed by, by division, by a car. We can do better. We can change the coordinates. I'll call that change of coordinates.
00:55:58.594 - 00:57:06.276, Speaker A: From a change of coordinates, we may surprise what I mean, even though the change of coordinates will be u going faster than when I should, is equal to u d of u one over a, since it's a unit, we can do this. We may suppose that phi, one of u is actually equal to u to the power alpha. Oh, no way. Alpha. Sorry about this. Interposes. And now I want to make, I want to specialize to the analytic case so that we make an argument.
00:57:06.276 - 00:57:52.282, Speaker A: Okay, so, so far we did everything with plus analytic, and we got it that we have this normal form where we start with phi one of u equals to u alpha. And the other terms, we don't, we don't have any, sorry, we don't have any information about them yet. They're just there. And I want to specialize the case that is analytic. So in the case that it's analytic, there's something that we can do. We can find relations for this curve in a direct way. So what we would like to consider in the target.
00:57:52.282 - 00:58:38.044, Speaker A: So recall, our objective is to find this curve gamma, this red curve. Right? If we find them, then we know how to start to blow up until we get some monomial morphes. That's at least heuristically that's the idea. So in here we knew that it was this curve x three minus y squared, because of the form of the, of the, of the morphism. But we want to do this now in a systematic way. So if we want to do this in a systematic way, the thing that we would like to take to consider would be something of the form x two or Xi. Let me do Xi already.
00:58:38.044 - 00:59:33.114, Speaker A: Xi minus the phi of phi depends on U. But we know that this phi one here of U of, right? So which is going to be the x one, one over alpha. Right? Because I call this entry here x one. Then x one should be equal to, sorry. Then u should be equal to x one, one over up. So this is what we wanted to consider, right. In the example this would matter would come to taking y minus x to the power three over two.
00:59:33.114 - 01:01:12.774, Speaker A: So this is not an analytic function. But we can do a little trick, which is usually in here, which is normal in this kind of setting, the algebraic and analytic setting, which is let psi be an alpha primitive square of the unit. And consider our I, which only depends on x one and xi given by the product from k equals zero to alpha minus one of the CI. So the term that we are thinking here, minus CI of c to the power k on one over alpha. So what we're doing is averaging by the, by the, by the, by a generator of the cyclic group here, that of the alpha square root of the units. So in the example, which would be of order two, which would mean that we are taking y minus x three over two times y minus. Sorry, the power three.
01:01:12.774 - 01:01:58.854, Speaker A: This is just going to be a plus. And what we're going to obtain is the cost. Right? So the claim is that when we do this, we get an analytic function. Well, and I'm not, I'm going to leave it as an exercise, because it's not difficult to prove our I is analytic. So what are we, what, what have we done? We have found a relation in the target. What does that mean? It means that if I compose ri with the phi, I'm going to get zero. I'm going to fasten.
01:01:58.854 - 01:03:17.444, Speaker A: Note that our I, composed with phi is constant equals to zero. I take this at a, the point that's zero at the point we are considering. Okay, so we do have the curve that we wanted, right. We can consider the curve gamma zero, which is r two equals to r three rn equals to zero. This is going to give us a curve, a locally defined curve there. And then the dilemma that, that we can use here is that let tau from n tilde to this rn be a resolution of singularities of gamma. Then Cuba equal to tau compose with phi.
01:03:17.444 - 01:03:58.878, Speaker A: Sorry, we have to etc. Such that pq again, PI equal to tau composed with student is monom. So now we argued that. So let me see. So in the case that we have analytic functions, we said, okay, we do know what kind of relations we want. We completed it. We make an algebraic trick here to complete into a function which is actually analytic.
01:03:58.878 - 01:04:48.474, Speaker A: Then we said, okay, this gives us an actual curve, an analytic curve, because we have n minus one equations. And in a similar way that we did for the first example, if we can consider a resolution of singularities of this curve, I'm claiming that it's going to give us a normalization of that morphism. And the proof is also very simple. The proof is very direct. I don't think, I'm not going to give the details. It's basically, once you get the resolution, it means that you have a change of coordinates where the curve is going to become just that, like all of the other, just z zero, z three equals zero, z n equals zero, which means that only the first entry, z one is non zero. And then you can verify in a simple way that it's a monoamorphism.
01:04:48.474 - 01:05:30.364, Speaker A: So I'm also going to leave this lemma as an exercise. It's also very simple. But then let's look at the case that it's q is general. So all of this was done for the analytic case. And we use this trick. And in this trick here, we are actually using this function PI, which was analytic. I'm multiplying by something which is sometimes complex, and I'm using that in this case, the fiat is still going to be convergent, right? Because if it's convergent at the origin, it's going to be convergent over at an open neighborhood, even in a complex case.
01:05:30.364 - 01:06:16.384, Speaker A: So also, we are also using that there is a complexification. It makes sense to write this in the quasi analytic case. This is not necessarily the general quasi analytic case. That does not necessarily true. And the difficulty, so q, general, no. So the difficulty arises from an example from Nazarov. Well, this example, by now there are several examples of this kind, but I like to use this one because it's very explicit.
01:06:16.384 - 01:07:38.718, Speaker A: Although if I'm not going to give the details, I'm just citing the reference. What they prove is that they exist across analytic class. And as a matter of fact, why am I saying that there are other examples? Because one can actually prove that every quasi analytic class have, I'm going to say here, and there exists a function f in q of zero one. So it's a function defined. So let me just write it here somewhere. Zero 10 function f into r, such that for every delta bigger than zero, and for every function g, which is quad analytic in between minus delta and one, the restriction of g, sorry, to zero one is different from f. So it's saying that whatever is the delta that we take here, whatever is the possible extension that we might want, there will not exist a function in the same class which extends this function here.
01:07:38.718 - 01:08:26.577, Speaker A: So you cannot extend it to the other side. This contrasts with the analytic case, where if we know that the Taylor series converges at a point, we know it converges in the neighborhood. And it also contrasts with the same infinity case, where we always can extend a synfinity function by sync function. It's not because of nothing that there exists viceroys preparation theorem for analytic. And there exists malgrange preparation theorem. So the viceroys version for the same case in the same category, it's very connected with the problem of extension, or actually of non extension in the quasi navy case. So why this difficulty here creates a big problem for us in the quasi analytic case.
01:08:26.577 - 01:09:07.233, Speaker A: So let me go to an example, and I would like to have space. I'm going to go down. So I'm going to use this function f in the next case, but simple. We just take from r to r two. We take u, and we're going to send it to u square f of u squared. Right? So we have here. And maybe the interesting thing is that since it's a U square, we are sending out twice to the positive part here.
01:09:07.233 - 01:10:14.394, Speaker A: What's going on? Right. So the situation that we, we're faced now, if we wanted to have a relation, if we wanted to find the relation that is given by this Morpheus here. So a relation between the components and the target. It's not difficult to see what you want to, what you would like to have, right. The relation that you would like to have access to would be r of x. And y should be equal to y minus f of x, right? But this is only defined, only defined in zero one times r. In particular, you cannot make.
01:10:14.394 - 01:11:02.014, Speaker A: So we can't, we cannot make the change of coordinates, which we would like to do. Z equals to y minus f of x. If we were able to do this change of coordinates, this monomial would become. This morpheus will become monomial, because what is this? This is just f of u squared minus f of u squared, which is zero. So we would get that. We'll get to the morpheus will be given by u squared, zero monomial. But we cannot do this change of coordinates because it's not well defined in an open neighborhood of the origin.
01:11:02.014 - 01:11:27.184, Speaker A: So it's connected with the non extension problem. And the phenomenon that we're looking here is not going to get better by blowing up. Blowing up is going to be birational. Well, yeah, it's biracial, but what do I mean by that? Right. The fact that you cannot extend here. Once you blow up, you're going to still have a whole half section that you cannot extend to. And this is not going to change by blowing up.
01:11:27.184 - 01:12:19.356, Speaker A: So this is the heuristic. You can prove it with computation if you want, but just geometrically, from the fact that you know that this part here is inaccessible by the extension, whenever you blow up, you're going to still have something half plane, which is inaccessible in any case for the change of coordinates. So this cannot go better. So how are we going to do with this? Now we can introduce power substitutions. Let me consider. Let r be some number again, and epsilon b plus or minus b minus one, or one. So, power substitutions.
01:12:19.356 - 01:13:14.958, Speaker A: In the real case, we're going to have things of the form u u square. So you should have u positive u squared or minus u squared so that you cover everything. So that's why there's going to be an appealing. And then we can define, although if I'm not taking much care about the. Sorry. And I, before you go further, very small question here. This problem that you just explained, is it really to do to this paper of Christoph Novak, which isn't the same theme of the necessity of the power substitutions or not? Okay, so what he proves in that paper, I just feel like this is, this is a different kind of.
01:13:14.958 - 01:13:37.410, Speaker A: It's more geometrical than that one, because what he proves is that you do need. So he proves that if f of x is square, is. It's related with that. Yes. Why didn't I think it? Yes, f. You're right. Because he already gave the proof, and an explicit proof using a four year analysis.
01:13:37.410 - 01:13:48.004, Speaker A: Right. F of x squared is in a class, but f is not in the class itself. Right? Yeah. Right. Right. So it's connected. Okay, thank you.
01:13:48.004 - 01:14:53.732, Speaker A: Okay, so. Okay, so, yeah, so the power substitution we're going to use here, although I'm not talking about in general, we want to do it only in respect to the exceptional divisor although I'm not paying too much attention to the exceptional divisor at this talk, but just so that we define it in the way that later on, the strongest possible way. So what we will do, and the one here is just to say that the first one is the one that we're going to change, which should be exceptional and should be appeared. Oops, let me do this better. It's going to appear this epsilon. So either plus or minus one u one to the power r and then everything else is just the same. So we just replace one of them by the power r.
01:14:53.732 - 01:15:48.054, Speaker A: And of course, if the power is even, then we should consider plus or minus, because otherwise we're not going to get subjective. We should consider both of them in order to get a call hovering. And in this situation here. Okay, but I just want to talk about the clock. I'm doing this kind of minimalist. Okay, so once we do this, what we're going to do is we're going to do a power substitutions in the target in order to take away the ramification of u squared. So we're going to consider, yeah, consider whole of Y.
01:15:48.054 - 01:17:15.934, Speaker A: Cuba equals to x cubed square y cubed, which is this x y from the beginning, right? So we, we had that x is equal to u squared and it's equal to x 2d squared. So from here we get x cubed equal to u and y cubed is equal to y, which is equal to f of u squared. So again, y cubed equal to f of u squared. And now we can make the change of coordinates, v equals to y cubed minus f of x cubed square. Because now this change of coordinates is defined over the open, over the open neighborhood in order to get monument, because this is going to be f of u squared minus f of u squared equals zero as we want. So now we have a power substitution in the target. We were able to get monomer.
01:17:15.934 - 01:18:31.264, Speaker A: So this exemplify what's the difficulty in the positive analytic case. In general, we cannot get relations in open sat like this. So that's why we use parse institutions, right? So maybe just a couple of words coming back to the original part, maybe I'm not going to write, but once you have this normal form here, once you have the phi, one is u to the power alpha, you can always make a power substitution so that it becomes just x one equals to u. And then you just need a change of coordinates in order to get a monoamomorphism, because you just have to do a what essentially what we did here for every one of the entries, because we already know that it's two that is equal to u and all of the other entries are function in U. So it becomes very simple. So I'm not going to write this, but it's direct. If you use power substitutions for the case of curves, we can just get to this better normal form here by.
01:18:31.264 - 01:19:07.046, Speaker A: Oops, there's some issue here. Yeah. You just can transform x one to become, by a power substitution equals to u, and then it's just a change of coordinates that becomes quite simple. So instead of that, I want to talk a little bit about the case where the source. So it's a little bit funny, right? And we're talking. I said that we're going to talk about the target, but we divided it in two parts. One where the source is equal, the dimension of the source is equal to one and the other when the dimension of the source is bigger than one.
01:19:07.046 - 01:20:18.708, Speaker A: And I want to talk about difficulties. There is a first and one of them I'm not going to spend much time, which is we did, we did talk about the fact that we consider m to n fine and we have a blowing up and we should define this morphsis feature. So in the case of dimension one, how to trans. How to modify the morphism so that phi Tudor is well defined. So this is a priority when we just. What I wrote is not such a difficulty in the sense that we know what we have to do. We take the center of the blowing up, we take its pullback, we have to take a resolution of singularity of it, and then we're going to complete this diagram.
01:20:18.708 - 01:20:53.380, Speaker A: We're going to have a true Morpheus coming from the source there. It's going to factor out. The difficulty here is that we're going to do this in a process of normalization. So we're going to have normal forms that we want to keep track of. So you cannot just do any kind of blowing up in the source and hope that you're going to preserve those normal forms. So there's actually a difficulty in this part, but in some sense it's a difficulty that I'm not going to talk about it today because I feel like it's a more technical difficulty that we know what we need to do. Like one needs to keep track of the normal form.
01:20:53.380 - 01:21:59.408, Speaker A: So we need to talk about the normal forms to say what are the conditions that we need to expect after blowing up to be preserved and etcetera. So it's going to be a more technical problem that we're going to cover in the other Friday. Today I want to focus on a second difficulty, which is more qualitative, which is obtaining relations. And here we can limit ourselves to key to q equals to the analytic case is more than enough for us to have to discuss this case details. Okay, so the first thing is that in the case of curves, we were able to see that we were able to get. Sorry, in the case the dimension of m was equal to one, we're able to get n minus one relations. So we were able to get that the image of the, of the curve was locally contained into an analytic set of dimension one.
01:21:59.408 - 01:22:50.600, Speaker A: So in general, we can define some sort of rank that measures this. And the definition of it I'm going to call like this is the dimension of. So since I'm analytic now, I can use usual standard. So this is, well, since I didn't introduce this, I'm going to use q divided by the kernel. We take the germ and we take it as the pullback in terms of the local rings, and we take the kernel of it. But what does this. So this is the definition that gives me what is called the analytic rank, but the heuristic that, because I'm not going to spend much time defining this.
01:22:50.600 - 01:23:42.728, Speaker A: But it's the dimension of the smallest. And that's how we should think about analytics. Set germ containing the local image of PI at a. Okay, so in the case of when dimension of m was equal to one, what we showed is the example the existence of two reals, three reals, rn. So n minus one relations. So this means that this kernel here, this kernel is going to be given by this r two, r three rn. So when we take this quotient, we're going to get something of dimension one.
01:23:42.728 - 01:24:53.524, Speaker A: It's going to be the dimension of the algebra geometry about the local ring of the curve. In any case, it's the dimension of the smallest set. Now, once we take dimension of m bigger than one, then the fact is that this relation here, the number of relations that was connected with the generic rank, might not be connected anymore. So let me just state this in a clear way. A definition, a point a in m is said to be regular for phi. So in the sense of Gabrielov, if the generic rank is equal to this analytic rank, for the case of curve, this was always true. Now, what I want to argue with you is that in general this is not true.
01:24:53.524 - 01:25:48.884, Speaker A: So this is the possible example of Osgoode we already talked about. But, so if we take the morphers that go from two reals, maybe we can do to three reals, and which takes from uv, and it's sent to uv, uv, exponential v. I claim that the generic rank of this morphine at zero is equal to two, but this analytic rank is equal to three. In other words, the only analytic set which contains the image of this morphine is going to be r three. There's not going to be something of dimension two. So let's see why. Okay.
01:25:48.884 - 01:26:45.064, Speaker A: Indeed, it's enough to look, to show this formally. So let us take h, some formal power series in our tree here. So lets one x two, x three, or x y z. Let's take an h in this sense here, such that when we compose with phi, we obtain something which is zero. So if it is a relation, if it's something, if, if we are in analytics set, and we compose with phi, which contains the image of phi, when we compose with I, we should get everything equals to zero, right? Because that's what the function is going to give us. So we have this. So let's write h as the sum of homogeneous terms here.
01:26:45.064 - 01:27:52.870, Speaker A: In this case, when we compose with phi, what we're going to get. So at one hand, we know that it's going to have to be zero. We are, we're choosing it like this, and we also know that this is going to be u h alpha of one v, the exponential v, which we want to be equal to zero. So now for each one of the levels that we consider, this is a polynomial in one v and v exponential v. But these guys are all algebraically transcendental between them, and h alpha is a polynomial. So there's only one choice. H alpha has to be zero for all alpha in n, which implies that h needs to be zero.
01:27:52.870 - 01:28:34.564, Speaker A: So the only form of power series, and therefore the only analytic function whose composition with phi is equal to zero, that contains the image of whose zero locals contain. The image of phi is the function zero itself. So this shows that the analytic rank is. So, of course, we started with this problem. We cannot use the last heuristic, right? We wanted to find enough relations so that this guides us, right? We were going to resolve the relations, and this should give us, or approach us to have a monomeomorphism. But now we have the issue that we don't even have a relation in the beginning. So one thing that we must do in this kind of case, if we want to get a monomerization, just want to get some relations.
01:28:34.564 - 01:29:27.304, Speaker A: To start with, the process, is that we should blow up the points which are the image of the points which are not regular. Right. These points are going to be in the target and we should blow up these points. These are the problematic points. They are really connected with the image. So we are going to blow up, we blow up the points which are in the image of no regular points. In the case of algorithm map, there's only one point here.
01:29:27.304 - 01:30:36.934, Speaker A: The zero zero is going to be sent to zero. So what we should blow up is the origin. In the example, we blow up PI of zero zero, which is zero. In our tree, we have our fly entry, we have our tao. Oops, not in claim that we have this morphemes phi tilde. And it's going to be enough to take the chart, the x chart. So now x is going to be equal to x one, y is going to be equal to x one, y one.
01:30:36.934 - 01:31:39.618, Speaker A: Z is going to be equal to x one, z one. And this computation we already done a couple of times today, so we know that x one is going to be equal to u, y one is going to be equal to v, and z one is going to be equal to v exponential of v. And now we have a nice relation here given by z one minus y one exponential of y one. So now the rank of Gabrielov like, sorry, dynalytic current has decreased. We do have the relation that we want. Actually, we just need to make a change of coordinates in order to get monomial. The change of coordinates given by w equals to this, so that it's only going to appear x one equals to u, y one equals to and w equals to zero.
01:31:39.618 - 01:32:31.234, Speaker A: And we're going to get monomi for this example. We can deal with it quite simply by just going off the point. But this gives me, takes me to the last point of today, which is, okay, so now we've seen that sometimes we don't have relations and we should point blow up the points which are in the image of this, where we don't have relations. Right. So what do I mean by this? Right. We had this non regular points a little bit confused and we said that we should blow up the image of the non regular points so the points in the target where there's no relation or there's too few relations. And let's explore that to construct an example that we cannot globally monomialize.
01:32:31.234 - 01:33:45.214, Speaker A: So the example is going to be based on the Osgoode mapping. Sorry. Sometimes this happens. So the example of morphism, which does not admit global non organization, and the example we're going to be building basically two kinds of functions. The first one is what we already saw, the Osgood mapping, which we just explained that it's not a regular zero. And we just verified that it doesn't have relations at zero. And the second one, we're going to take a function here, one over delta s minus one over PI.
01:33:45.214 - 01:34:21.554, Speaker A: Let me just write delta some number which is a small, oops, positive small. Start right fast. And you don't know why. I have time. And the idea from, from this function is that what we actually want to consider is the sine of it or the cosine of it, both of them actually. Right. Which is going to give us something that at one over delta PI, we are going to accumulate.
01:34:21.554 - 01:35:01.504, Speaker A: Right. We're going to have something like this as usual. And what we are actually going to consider is a curve given by h of s is going to be, did I write it? Yes. There, sine of theta s, which multiply cosine of theta square, sine square of theta s. Everything that I need to close. We're going to consider this function here. But this is the second one.
01:35:01.504 - 01:35:48.188, Speaker A: The reason to consider, oops, no, I didn't close enough. The reason to consider this function here is because it will. Its graph has an interesting property, the curve s gamma s containing our tree. So we are turning the circle here. We are also changing the. So in here, cosine square, sine square means that as we, as we go over, as we have an evolution with s, we're going to turn in the circle. And the function sign of theta s means that we're changing the radius along it.
01:35:48.188 - 01:37:30.584, Speaker A: So once we get close to one over delta PI, we're going to actually be dense and we're going to approach all of the points of the unit circle right over s equals to one delta PI. So this curve here has an interesting, interesting thing that one can prove. The intersection of its intersection with any sub analytic set of dimension two is at most a finite number of points. Transcendental resistance. For all super analytic set x, dimension of x is more than equal to true. I didn't give a name for the curve, but s hs is only given by a finite number of points. So by this we mean that you locally find, by this we mean that whatever we intersect, particularly intersect with something analytic, we're not going to be able to cover the entire curve.
01:37:30.584 - 01:38:40.924, Speaker A: Okay, very well. So now we can build up the morphism. So the base of the morphism is going to be the following, the following application. We're going to take pictures to use the same notation on the paper from s three two r four. So here I'm going to write, and then I'm going to explain s u v w. We're going to send to s u plus h one of s u v plus hq of s u v exponential v, where this s three is equal to squared plus u squared. W squared equals to one.
01:38:40.924 - 01:39:34.504, Speaker A: Right? It's the sphere. And we're defining this morpheus here. So the interesting thing about this morphism is that the points where that every point, if we follow the line s here, right, we follow s zero, zero, whatever. What we need one minus our square root of one minus s squared. All of these points are not going to be regular. It's not regular mu zero around here. Moreover, b nt is proper.
01:39:34.504 - 01:40:04.824, Speaker A: It's proper because it's analytic. And the domain is the sources, and the sources of the is compact. Let me just make the. Okay, so let me just write. What is the issue here? Right? So what is going on is that we have this. This sphere and we are looking at the target there. We're going to have the last coordinate here, equals to zero.
01:40:04.824 - 01:40:56.798, Speaker A: And then we have this curve of points, s. Here we have this curve of non regular points which are standing there. And what is going on is that this curve is going to be like a. And of course, we are only going so far. That's true. But if we wanted to extend this curve, then eventually we are going to get something transcendent, because it would follow this h one of f, h two of s, and s would follow that curve that we considered before. So already this means that if this curve was global, right? If we want to resolve the single, if we want to monomialize this morpheus, we need to blow up the points which are not regular.
01:40:56.798 - 01:42:08.930, Speaker A: So we need to blow up the red curve in order to guarantee that everything is as it should be. Let's just consider a new, just a small extra computation. And we consider dysmorphis, four reals, and we are going to take it in a manifold, not n, until that which is just the blowing up of four reals. And now this is the morphism we're going to consider. So what did we do here? Thou blowing up of the origin. And this I immersion to the. Ah.
01:42:08.930 - 01:42:41.974, Speaker A: I could just write because we defined it already. Sorry. The w chart. The chart in the left entry here, where I'm looking at this as x y z w. So if we do this, then this last morph, this means that once we make the bowen up so we will have only have one point where the, there's no relation. We blow it up. And now we get that this is the exceptional divisor.
01:42:41.974 - 01:43:31.064, Speaker A: So it's globally defined. And in this case, if you want to blow up the red curve, there's no way around it, you need to blow up the entire red curve. And if you say, okay, so maybe I can blow up something of dimension true of something else, then the property that any sub analytic set x will only have a finite number of points here means that for whatever sequence of blowing up, or more generally, for every proper demuromorphic mapping, the exceptional locus is going to be at least of co dimension two. It's going to be at most, sorry, of co dimension two. So its images, critical locus. So its critical values are going to be of a super analytic set of at most dimension two. Therefore, it will intersect only a finite number, locally finite number of points in this guy.
01:43:31.064 - 01:44:01.624, Speaker A: So you're not going to be able to, by some other general centers of blowing up, cover this red curve by blowing up. So you're obliged to blow it up entirely. But this is not possible globally. So this is the idea of the proof. I'm sorry that in the end it was a bit fast, but I will finish here today, and the next time we're going to talk about applications. Sorry for passing a bit of time. Okay, I stop.
01:44:01.624 - 01:44:07.924, Speaker A: Thank you, Andrea.
