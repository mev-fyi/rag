00:00:21.640 - 00:01:20.404, Speaker A: Okay, let's continue with our first serious example. It's example. It's called the subleff space. There are many sublef spaces. Indeed. We will study at least two, maybe three sublef spaces to understand what happens if we change the condition in the definition of a space and its consequences on the kernel and the formulas we obtain. So I obtain with, I commence with subleft spaces version one.
00:01:20.404 - 00:02:47.784, Speaker A: To do this, I need to recall a definition again from analysis, maybe in the second or third course of analysis, you see this. What is an absolutely continuous function? In particular, we stay on zero one with value on r. We can see that the real case, the complex case, is similar. This is just to avoid putting bar all the time we know the definition of continuous function absolutely continuous is more is really a heavier restriction on the function. One way to define it is this way. F is absolutely continuous on zero and one. If there is an integrable function g on zero one.
00:02:47.784 - 00:04:26.114, Speaker A: And let me emphasize what this what does integrable means? Integrable means that integral from zero to one absolute value of g of t d of t is less than infinity. That's the meaning of being integrable such that f of x is equal to f of zero plus integral from zero to x g of t dt. That's one definition of being absolutely continuous. Let's, let's see what is the consequence of this. Assume that you have an interval on zero one. So here is zero one one interval here, another one there, a little one there, x one, y one x two, y two. So assume that zero less than or equal to x one less than y one and then y one.
00:04:26.114 - 00:06:11.744, Speaker A: And then you have x two less than y two, and you continue up to the nth one. This interval r is zero one, with a restriction on this. So assume that this is we say assume that epsilon is given. Then there is delta such that if the some of the lengths, just not just one of them, y one minus x one, y two minus x two up to y n minus x, the sum is less than delta. If the sum of yj minus xj less than delta, then you can conclude that the sum j from one up to n absolute value f of yj minus f of xj is less than epsilon. You see, it's way more than continuity. In the continuity, we don't have sum here we have just one interval.
00:06:11.744 - 00:07:24.300, Speaker A: If the distance between y and x is less than delta, then the distance between f of y and f of x is less than epsilon. But here it can be a collection of intervals. And there is no restriction on the number of these sub intervals. And this is an easy exercise to prove in it comes from a measured theory. Indeed, because when you look at the sum sum j from one up to n f of y minus f of xj, look at this formula. If you put yj and xj instead of x, you see this is some absolute value integral from xj up to yj of g of t dt. This is, this is precisely equal to this.
00:07:24.300 - 00:08:50.242, Speaker A: These are equal for ej, thanks to this identity. And now you use triangle inequality is less than or equal to the sum j from one to n integral from xj to yj, absolute value of gt dt. And you can write this as some j from one to n integral over the interval xj yj the same, the same function. And since these are not overlapping, it's integral over the union. In other words, you calculate the area under absolute value of g over these intervals here, here, here, and here. The absolute continuity here means that if this set is small, then the area is small, and it's not just for interval. In the general setting, even we say something more.
00:08:50.242 - 00:09:51.848, Speaker A: We say that if we have a set in zero, one, of course, measurable set such that its length is less than delta length here means the Lubeg measure. Then integral over e of gt dt is less than epsilon. That's a generalization of what we have here. So this is the easy part of the definition of absolutely continuity. We can live with that. What is more difficult, and it's indeed one of the deep theorems that we prove in analysis two or three, is that if this is true, then we obtain such a representation. In other words, they are equivalent.
00:09:51.848 - 00:11:17.280, Speaker A: So, theorem is like this. Suppose that for each epsilon bigger than zero, there is a delta bigger than zero, such that if the sum of yj minus xj j from one to n is less than delta, then the sum of f of yj minus f of x j absolute value is less than. This is our assumption. Then there is so some existence theorem g on zero, one integrable such that the representation box f of x equal to f of zero, last integral from zero to x gt dt. That's a deep result. It's not, it's not trivial. It takes some time to prove it.
00:11:17.280 - 00:12:01.074, Speaker A: The previous one, this observation, even though you need to know some techniques from measured theory to prove this, but it's not something which is very profound, very deep. However, the proof of this theorem, in the reverse order, is something profound for us. We don't care. I mean, we use both of them because they are the same. So that's the definition of absolute continuity for us. I emphasize the fact that g is in l one. And a theorem of Lubeck, it's in the bacteria.
00:12:01.074 - 00:13:22.724, Speaker A: One of his famous contributions says that if f is absolutely continuous, then fix the derivative. The classical derivative exists, but almost everywhere. This is the terminology he's invented. Or instead of almost everywhere, I say for almost all x in zero one and fpmo x equal to glx, again, almost it. So we know what g is, the derivative of this. So this representation formula here can be written as follows. F of x is equal to f of zero plus integral from zero to one.
00:13:22.724 - 00:14:46.758, Speaker A: So, zero to x prime of t dt. So. So based on this observation, we can rewrite the definition of absolutely continuity as follows. So, in a sense, this is the third equivalent definition. F from zero to one in R is absolutely continuous. If one f prime of x exists almost everywhere. Two f prime is in l one of zero, one l one, is the same as saying integral and third representation, which is in rectangle here.
00:14:46.758 - 00:15:58.976, Speaker A: And third f of x is equal to f of zero plus. We have to have all three properties. In this case, our function is called an absolutely continuous function. To emphasize that all three are needed. And absolutely absolute continuity is something really strong is much, much more than being continuous. It's better to go and look for devil's staircase function in the literature. Look for this is a function which is defined on the contour set on zero one.
00:15:58.976 - 00:16:39.004, Speaker A: Sometimes it's even called contour stickers function, or I mean control lobe function. It's an increasing function like this. It here is zero one in the intervals that we exclude. You remember the construction of contour set. The first step will remove the interval. 1323. The function is defined to be constant here.
00:16:39.004 - 00:17:32.754, Speaker A: What is the value? You will see. And then we do this, because in this step, we remove this interval. In the second step, we remove two intervals, this one here and this one there, right in the middle. And the function is properly defined such that, naively speaking, it's like this here and like that over there. And we continue this construction. So it has infinitely many steps. That is why it's called staircase function.
00:17:32.754 - 00:18:10.448, Speaker A: And at the beginning it's equal to zero. Finally, at the end is equal to one. And these height are adjusted such that the function is really increasing. Or if you want to say non decreasing, well, go ahead with non decreasing. I don't mind to call it non decreasing or increasing function. Because of these steps on the interval which we remove. 1323.
00:18:10.448 - 00:18:59.284, Speaker A: Here is the interval one over nine, two over nine, three over nine, and here, here is six over nine. Here, seven over nine, and eight over nine. That's the second step because of all these blue intervals that we remove. F prime of x exists and is equal to zero on the union of these blue intervals. When you calculate the measure of the blue intervals that it's equal to one. That is why I can say almost everywhere on zero. This doesn't matter how we adjust these heights.
00:18:59.284 - 00:19:57.878, Speaker A: If they are constant on the blue intervals, then f prime is equal to zero almost everywhere. But we can adjust the height such that it's a continuous function. It's a continuous function. And so you see that for this function integral from zero to one, f prime of t dt is equal to zero, and it's not equal to f minus f of zero, which is one. So it's not an absolutely continuous function. Absolutely continuous function should satisfy this property for every x. It does.
00:19:57.878 - 00:20:41.212, Speaker A: It doesn't work for x equal to one. So go and study the details of this devil's function. It's very interesting, what we need here for our definition. I emphasized here that f prime is in L1. So I write it again here. For absolutely continuous f prime is in L1 l two. L1 is a subset, and it's a proper subset of l one of zero.
00:20:41.212 - 00:22:27.880, Speaker A: Why? Because if g is el two, then integral of absolute value of g of t t from zero to one. I apply the Cauchy Schwarz inequality with one of my functions to be one, the other to be g. So by Cauchy, Schwartz is less than or equal to integral from zero to one, one squared dt one two, and then integral from zero to one mod g squared dtf, which I mean this is equal to one and the other one is known to. So, briefly speaking, I showed that the norm of g in l one of zero one is less than or equal to the norm of g. In L 20, this shows the inclusion. So if the l two norm of something is bounded, so if norm in L two is bounded, certainly more in l, one is bounded too. But the reverse is not true.
00:22:27.880 - 00:23:01.814, Speaker A: And I leave it to you as an exercise. It's not difficult. It's really simple. Indeed, if you work with one over x for one over root of x, you obtain the functions which is in one of these spaces, but not the other. So the inclusion is really proper. Now I'm ready to define my sobolef space. Lh is the following set.
00:23:01.814 - 00:24:34.144, Speaker A: The set of all functions f from zero one to r such that, well, one f is absolutely continuous, though f prime, I put more restriction on it, is in L two, not just in L1. A bit more is in L two, and I add some boundary condition. I fix f of zero and f of one. So at both extremities, f of zero is equal to zero, f of one is equal to one. And I want to show my goal. Still the inner product is not defined, but I can tell you what is my final goal. I want to show that h is an rkhs and also find its kick, find its kernel.
00:24:34.144 - 00:25:33.204, Speaker A: That's, you will see, it's a kind of difficult task. Well, I said rkhs Hilbert space. Look, we can add these functions, we can multiply by scalars. It's easy to see that it's a vector space. But what is the inner product? If you want to have a Hilbert space here, the inner product I define. So definition I define the inner product of f and g in h to be integral from zero to one f prime t g prime, t dt. I don't need bar because I work in the real case.
00:25:33.204 - 00:26:29.982, Speaker A: Well, I need to prove that it's a genuine inner product and also the norm is complete. Several properties of inner products are easy to verify. For example, linearity with respect to first and second argument that the scalar multiplication can come out. For example, it's easy to see f plus g and h, that's elementary. Or alpha times f and g is equal to alpha times f and g. That's also elementary. Trivial f times g is the same as g times f.
00:26:29.982 - 00:27:07.174, Speaker A: Still elementary. And also, and also, inner product of f and f is positive because it's the normal function squared. What needs a bit of attention is that why if f inner product with f is zero, f is identically zero. Why? Back to the definition, it's f prime. Attention. F prime is not continuous. I will, that's a delicate point.
00:27:07.174 - 00:27:33.406, Speaker A: Explain. F times f is integral from zero to one. Yeah, but by the boundary condition, f is continuous. Yes, yes, absolutely. But you need to be careful here. Precisely. When this is equal to zero, integral from zero to one, f prime squared dt equal to zero.
00:27:33.406 - 00:28:12.938, Speaker A: What is the conclusion? F prime is zero almost everywhere. Please stop here. Very good answer. F prime of t equal to zero almost everywhere. And why? From here we can conclude that f is equal to zero. Where is this representation? X was equal to f zero plus the integral of f prime. Exactly, exactly.
00:28:12.938 - 00:28:52.728, Speaker A: We have this one f of x is equal to f of zero plus integral from zero to x f prime dt. That's an important property of absolutely continuous function. So f of x equal to f of zero, plus integral from zero to x, f prime, t dt. As you said, this is zero. And you also mentioned this is also zero boundary value. So we have f of x, zero for all x. In other words, f identically, is equal to zero.
00:28:52.728 - 00:29:15.488, Speaker A: So it's. It's a good inner product. It satisfies all the properties. Just a question. Yes. Because f prime is equal to zero, we can say that the f is constant almost everywhere also. No, I just gave you, I mean, I just raised your attention here for absolutely continuous function.
00:29:15.488 - 00:29:44.896, Speaker A: Yes, but if not here, it is devil's staircase. This is a function for which f prime is zero almost everywhere. But it's not a constant function. It's an increasing function from zero to one. Okay, thanks. It's. I mean, for us, 100 years, 120 years after, it's easy to, I mean, read this and understand.
00:29:44.896 - 00:30:32.214, Speaker A: But imagine 100 years ago, when Lobeg and Cantor and others thought about this thing. It wasn't easy at the time. I mean, I fully understand why you say, and I have the same feeling, too. When f prime is zero, f has to be constant, no. Thanks to the work of great masters, you see a function which is increasing zero almost everywhere, but not constant. But in our case, we consider a subclass, absolutely continuous function, for which what you say is correct. If you want to correctly state what you say, you can put it that way.
00:30:32.214 - 00:30:58.414, Speaker A: If f is absolutely continuous and f prime is zero altitude everywhere, then f is constant. That is true. Okay, so we have. Can I ask another question about this discussion, please? Can we say that f prime is zero absolute everywhere? Then f is constant. Absolute everywhere. Almost everywhere. Sorry.
00:30:58.414 - 00:31:53.538, Speaker A: F prime is zero almost everywhere. F is constant almost everywhere. Can you say this? Be careful about what you mean by f constant everywhere. Maybe you mean that f is like this, but the constants could be different because f is constant here, f is constant here is constant here, but not the same constant. Yeah, it depends what you want to say. Yes, if you want to say that f is constant, just one constant almost everywhere, then no, still, if you want to say that, if it's constant but different constants, you need to be careful. You need to be careful.
00:31:53.538 - 00:32:37.482, Speaker A: We have constructions which is way more complicated than this. And still f prime is equal to zero. And we do not have intervals on which f is constant. So it's a very delicate subject in measure theory to keep ourselves from error. Let me write the theorem, because we will, we can. We can use it. If f is absolutely continuous, and f prime equal to zero almost everywhere, then f is constant.
00:32:37.482 - 00:32:52.984, Speaker A: The way we understand. Constant, constant everywhere. Other than that. Other than that. It means if you remove the absolute continuity. We have many bizarre behaviors. We need to be careful.
00:32:52.984 - 00:33:38.612, Speaker A: Okay. And what remains? Ah, completeness. Completeness is almost for free. And that's a gift from Lubeck. As I mentioned earlier, one of the greatest achievement of Lubeck was to define LP spaces. And they are complete. What does this mean? This means that if you have a Cauchy sequence in LP, if gn is caucus, then there is.
00:33:38.612 - 00:34:41.534, Speaker A: And this is the essence, the existence, there is g in lp, such that gn goes to g in lp. Nor. That's the important message of Lubeck. And now let's go back and see what caution means in our setting. Let fn be Cauchy in H. So, for this, recall, what is the norm of f in h? The norm of f in h is integral from zero to one f times f, which is f prime of t squared dt root square. That's the same formula we have here.
00:34:41.534 - 00:35:41.224, Speaker A: Same formula we have here. I took f equal to g. And I can write this as the norm of f prime in L two. Of zero l two. So, fn Cauchy means that given every epsilon, there exists an n such that if m and n are big, then norm of fn minus fm. In this space, h is a small. But what is fn minus fm is fn prime minus fm prime in L two.
00:35:41.224 - 00:36:55.308, Speaker A: By this identity, therefore, this means that fn is Cauchy in L two of zero one, l two complete, there exists g such that f prime, fn prime goes to g in l two. We already had an inequality. Norm one is less than or equal to norm two. Here it is norm one is less than or equal to norm two. So if something converges to zero in l two, it also converges in l one. Therefore, we have this strong convergence. Also, fn prime goes to g in l one.
00:36:55.308 - 00:37:59.708, Speaker A: I need both. What are the consequences of these two? First, look at the representation for fn. Since f is in h, we have the representation f n of x is equal to fn. If n of zero is equal to zero. So I remove this integral from zero to one f n of f n prime of t dt, and here is x. I made a mistake. We know that this goes to integral from zero to one g of t dt.
00:37:59.708 - 00:38:41.120, Speaker A: Because the convergence is also in l one. Again, I wrote one. We know that the right side is convergent. Therefore, I come and define function f by the formula zero to x gt dt. That's my definition. By definition, f is absolutely continuous. The observation here.
00:38:41.120 - 00:39:32.304, Speaker A: Indeed, this one, since f prime is equal to g almost everywhere fn goes to f prime in l two. That's, that's what we have here, which is the same as going saying that f n goes to f in h. Before this, I have to verify two things. Indeed it has to come before this. But they are rather elementary. By definition, f of zero is equal to zero. Just to make sure that we are really in h.
00:39:32.304 - 00:40:34.840, Speaker A: And also why f of one is equal to one. Because f is equal to integral from zero to one g of t dt. There is no indication that this to be zero. But if you go back again and look at this, fn prime goes to g in l one. So here, here I can write limb n times infinity integral from zero one f prime t because f n prime goes to g in l one. And now I know that this is equal to fn one minus f zero and both are zero. So f zero one is also zero.
00:40:34.840 - 00:41:22.694, Speaker A: So this makes sure, this makes sure that f is in h. This should come before this and this one after. But it's okay. We have f in h converges to f in h. Therefore h is Hilbert space more than that, not just Hilbert space. Evaluation is continuous. Again, back to the formula f of x is equal to integral from zero one f prime t dt zero to x.
00:41:22.694 - 00:42:51.214, Speaker A: Taking the absolute value we have less than or equal to zero x this one. And then Cauchy Schwartz again with one function to be one, the other to be absolute value of f prime. So Cauchy Schwarz is less than zero to x one squared dt root square integral zero to x f prime t squared dt one two less than or equal. This is root x. And here, be a bit generous, that's not a mistake. This time I replace x by one and this is root x normal f in h. So absolute value of f of x is less than or equal to root x fh.
00:42:51.214 - 00:44:12.922, Speaker A: I can also write this as evaluation at point x of is less than is. So it's continuous and so ex is continuous and norm of ex as an element of h two r is bounded by root x. You see, that's one estimation. So by now we have, so we have an rkhs. Good. Is this optimal? Is this really an upper bound for the norm? I very quickly convinced you that this is not the optimal answer, because I started with this definition, with this one, with this representation, because this is f of x. The integral on the right side is f of x minus f of zero.
00:44:12.922 - 00:44:54.474, Speaker A: F of zero is zero. So we obtain, we also have what is integral from x to one f prime of t dt. I mean absolutely continuous. So this is f of one minus f of x. F of one is zero, so it's minus f of x. I can write f of x is equal to minus this. That's another formula.
00:44:54.474 - 00:46:22.646, Speaker A: That's another formula for f. And if I do the same calculation I did here, I mean, take absolute value inside, then apply Cauchy Schwarz. What do you obtain here instead of root x? You see that if I do the same calculation, square root of one minus x, exactly same calculation gives me this. And therefore also norm of x will be less than root of one minus x. So at least I have two one here less than root x, another one here less than root of one minus x, and none of them is indeed optimal. Root of x is not good. Root of one minus x is not good neither.
00:46:22.646 - 00:47:18.914, Speaker A: So the question is this, what's the norm of ex? That's the question I will answer next week. And to show you what I will use, I go back to the second part. Here it is. Here is the formula I will use to obtain the norm of the evaluation function. But before using this formula, I have a long road to traverse. I mean, I have to find k. I have to find the kernel here.
00:47:18.914 - 00:48:03.874, Speaker A: I know that it's reproducing kernel Hilbert space, but still I do not have the kernel. I have to find the kernel and then use the kernel to evaluate this. So, more honestly, this is my second question. And question one is what's k? This is what we will do next week. We will find k and we will see. For that we need techniques from distribution theory and ordinary differential equations. It's not an easy task, but at the end of the day, we will succeed.
00:48:03.874 - 00:48:52.720, Speaker A: We will obtain the kernel k, and then we'll use the kernel to obtain the norm of k. So the answer is available in the book I presented at the very beginning. You can go and read it in the book. My suggestion is to try to do it yourself, and I assure you it will pay off. You will see what are your difficulties and possibly why you do not succeed. And then you will be able to discuss and overcome all the difficulties one by one. Well, that's enough for today.
00:48:52.720 - 00:49:04.544, Speaker A: Thank you very much, all of you, and well hope to see you next week. I'm available if you have any questions.
