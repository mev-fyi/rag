00:00:00.160 - 00:01:23.264, Speaker A: Hello, my name is Carl, and today I'm going to present a summary of what I learned throughout the entire course. And for each unit, like, I will present one or two interesting results or theorem that I've learned. And for some of it I'll present a simple proof or rough draft of the proof, and the others, uh, that are too complicated. I will only mention the results. Okay, um, first of all, I'll start out with, with some stuff I learned in group theory. So given a group g, we may consider its subgroups in which we ought to know as, um, h. And the most important question that we were trying to solve was that when is the quotient set, which is the set of equivalent classes defined by h given by a, is equivalent to b, if so, for all equivalent classes.
00:01:23.264 - 00:03:45.804, Speaker A: And let's also denote this as the equivalent classes, including the element eight. And then we want to know, when is this set? Once this set, a group with the multiplications defined by this. So when, when is this while defined in this set to make this a group? And then it turns out that when h is normal, g over h, equation group is g over h is a group with the multiplications defined this way, and h is normal if and only if, which is defined to be the set if and only if this thing is equal to each. Or equivalently, the left translation of H is the same as the right translation of H. And then furthermore, this thing is also enough for showing that h is a normal group. And then we next talked about the group homomorphisms on G. So there is some relations between the group homomorphisms on G and the normal groups of G.
00:03:45.804 - 00:05:52.052, Speaker A: For each homomorphisms on the group G, um, we can consider its kernel, um, which is all the elements that's getting, getting mapped to one by the, by the homomorphism line. And then in this case, for each homomorphism on the group G, it's, its kernel is, is actually a also a normal group of object. And to show this, pick an arbitrary element that's in G. Then since h is an internal, we know that y of h is equal to one. So then this thing is equal to this, which is again equal to equal to one. And then next, I want to talk about a very interesting group that's kind of important to abstract harmonic analysis, which is the special unitary group on the, on c two. And then the elements in su two, after some computations, is always in the form where, where its determined determinant is equal to one.
00:05:52.052 - 00:07:07.460, Speaker A: So it's also equivalent to this. And in particular, since a and b are complex. This actually also implies that, um, suppose a is equal to, um, and b is equal to. Then this thing actually also implies. So each element in a special unitary group is also a solution to this equation. And they're, they're, they're kind of isomorphic to each other. So we also know that the special unitary group is, um, is isomorphic to the, to the sphere in r three, I mean r four.
00:07:07.460 - 00:08:37.404, Speaker A: Sorry. Yes, yeah, sorry. Yeah. And then, and then next we discuss about the, actually for a group g. Actually, we can assume it to be a topological, actually, let's just assume there to be a regular group for them, like just arbitrary groups for any group g and h, we may consider the set of homomorphisms from g two h. And we are wondering when, when is, when is this set a group? And after some computations and checkings, we notice that the homomorphism, this set is a group if and only if and only if h. H is the billionaire.
00:08:37.404 - 00:09:20.044, Speaker A: And, and why is that? It's because if h is not abelian, then the inverse of a homo of a homomorphisms in this, in this set might not always exist. And to see this, pick an arbitrary, arbitrary element, absolutely, that's in that same g. Then the identity of this set, when this is a group, always have to be the map app that maps everything to the identity of h.
00:09:28.664 - 00:09:33.222, Speaker B: Are you going to say what you, are you going to say what the group operations?
00:09:33.318 - 00:10:39.964, Speaker A: Yeah, so the group operations in this case is defined by the, by the point wise multiplications. So suppose we have y one times by two. Then this is defined to be, let's also put lg here. This is the group operations defined on this set. And when is this a? When, when does this group, this operations make this a group is when, when h is a billion. And, and to see this, consider ab, that's in g. And after some checkings, if this is a group, then its identity has to be the, has to be the map that sends everything to the identity of h.
00:10:39.964 - 00:11:17.274, Speaker A: So in this case, for any elements, a, b that's in g, and an arbitrary homomorphisms that's from g to h, then, then when we multiply by its inverse, this thing has to be equal to, um, to, but f of a times b, which is equal to, to one by definition, because.
00:11:22.334 - 00:11:25.994, Speaker C: I mean, in Omafina doesn't always have it.
00:11:27.534 - 00:11:30.582, Speaker A: So what I'm doing is, what do you mean?
00:11:30.638 - 00:11:32.874, Speaker C: Do you mean by om or geoh?
00:11:33.414 - 00:11:47.414, Speaker A: Oh, so the set of homomorphisms that's from g to h does that answer your question or.
00:11:50.434 - 00:11:51.346, Speaker C: Inverse?
00:11:51.450 - 00:11:55.654, Speaker A: Oh, sorry, sorry. These are elements of the set, right?
00:11:56.274 - 00:12:05.498, Speaker C: Yes, but, okay, if not all the normal females have been inversed. So how do you know that p minus one exists?
00:12:05.586 - 00:12:48.148, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah. So we're trying to show that, like, if this thing exists, then there has to satisfy certain properties. Yes, I'm sorry about that. Sorry about that. So if this thing exists, then the result has to be equal to one, which is. Sorry, like I'm in like the identity of h. And then, um, so this is technically equal to y times y inverse of a times b.
00:12:48.148 - 00:14:15.564, Speaker A: Right. And this two multiplied by each other should be equal to the identity, which is. And then, so here, what happens is that if we multiply the inverse of this elements on both sides, then we obtain like, this element's inverse that's in each. Okay, and then, and the inverse of this element, by looking at this, we know it has to be equal to. Right. And then if the y inverse in this case is also a homomorphism, then this has to satisfy, then this thing also has to be equal to this. And which shows that ab has to be equal to b.
00:14:18.064 - 00:14:20.982, Speaker B: That equal sign is coming from the very left hand side.
00:14:21.088 - 00:14:21.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:23.514 - 00:14:36.818, Speaker B: So, well, why is, why suddenly, just suddenly, not by inverse.
00:14:36.986 - 00:14:56.700, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. I think I shouldn't use equality here. But if like y inverse in this case is a homomorphism, then it has to also satisfy this equality.
00:14:56.732 - 00:15:26.994, Speaker C: No, no, you are not using that because the fact that you have a homomorphism will give you three of b minus one, not three minus one. If you have a pneumonal prisma, that will bring the minus one inside, not around what you are losing, I think you are losing that property there. Again, you are losing that three minus one ab is equal to three ad minus one.
00:15:29.734 - 00:15:30.914, Speaker A: So from here.
00:15:38.094 - 00:16:38.482, Speaker C: The fact that it's would normal figure would give you this one, not this one. Oh, what you are using is this property here that tell you that if you have the minus one, you can bring around three. But for example, if you take b equal the identity of g, you get from this, you get that b minus a, a the same minus one, this one. And this is what you are using. You are rewriting this as p minus one ob minus one away. And now using the one of these that is this. So you need one extra step, this, to get this equality, which is this one here.
00:16:38.482 - 00:16:42.334, Speaker C: But we taking one of the two, we further them.
00:16:44.634 - 00:16:45.002, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:45.018 - 00:16:46.774, Speaker A: Okay, thank you so much. Thank you so much.
00:16:49.314 - 00:16:51.584, Speaker C: I think that is what you want me to see.
00:16:57.954 - 00:16:58.854, Speaker A: Okay.
00:16:59.434 - 00:17:03.574, Speaker D: If I have a inverse, then it must be point wise inverse.
00:17:08.034 - 00:17:25.014, Speaker B: If it's point wise qualification, then the inverse has got to be the point. Why it is. But you're somehow telling that's not possible. But why. So why is it not possible in general?
00:17:26.274 - 00:17:46.214, Speaker A: Um, so my argument is that, uh, if a times b is not equal to b times a, then, uh, this thing might not be a. A homomorphism.
00:17:49.514 - 00:18:15.714, Speaker D: Well, see, we did to refine the group operation. You don't have to worry about medications. It's a big improvement. And now you are looking at a subset, which you want to show that it's a subgroup. Maybe you want to make sure that it's closed.
00:18:34.434 - 00:18:36.466, Speaker B: I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear that.
00:18:36.530 - 00:18:51.074, Speaker D: Well, the goal is though, that said, right, formal work business does not close under 50, quite likely. Or until. Well, I guess it doesn't exactly.
00:18:51.774 - 00:20:11.546, Speaker B: Certainly, certainly, if you look at all maps from any set into a group, then with point wise multiplication, that's a group. So what goes wrong? And if you have the subset, if it's a bit, it's a subgroup, well, subset with the usual modification, the same modification, then the inverse is going to have to be the same as it is in the big thing. We know what the inverse has to be if it exists. And you're just saying that the general inverse is inverse, the inverse of the function g into h, point wise inverse. Why is that? You said at the very end. Okay, so if the phi inverse ab is equal to phi inverse ba. Well, that's what's required.
00:20:11.546 - 00:20:14.774, Speaker B: Right, but what's wrong with that?
00:20:22.274 - 00:20:41.294, Speaker D: There could be something wrong with that. His statement, I mean, even hh is now a billion. The homologous still can be improved because this can be just a few.
00:20:44.874 - 00:21:20.794, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's not quite clear what your main statement is. Your main statement is just that if h is abelian, then you get a group, and that's fine. That's the main thing you stated. That's the only thing you stated. If h is abelian, then the whole organs form the group as a subset of the.
00:21:26.274 - 00:21:44.334, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Oh, I was, I was trying to show that when h is not billion, then, um, the inverse is not true. Oh, I see, I see. I think there might be something wrong with my. There might be something wrong with my. My.
00:21:48.474 - 00:22:12.964, Speaker D: B has to equal c of. But, but there could be homomorphisms that do that, right? Even if they could be that, there's a homomorphism. So proving that d of ad has equal entail does not apply to hilient, because we don't know that all the elements of h are it as the image of homo.
00:22:13.424 - 00:22:17.784, Speaker A: Oh, okay, okay. I see, I see. Okay.
00:22:19.804 - 00:22:40.756, Speaker B: And it might even be true that every arbitrary homomorphism, the inverse, more point wise inverse, is a homomorphism for some g and h where h is going to be.
00:22:40.940 - 00:23:02.834, Speaker D: Yes. So this was what John Lang was saying before, right. For example, it could be that the only homomorphism from d to h is epilepsy. So depending on what DNA got, like, for instance, DNA is a finite group when the cardinality, the group are relatively crossed. So then. Exactly.
00:23:07.934 - 00:23:11.034, Speaker B: At least they have to be trivial on the commentators.
00:23:11.484 - 00:23:22.824, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly right. So it could, so more generally, it could be that you have some situation where the common human subgroup, all the homo marcism.
00:23:28.684 - 00:23:32.012, Speaker A: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
00:23:32.028 - 00:23:38.484, Speaker B: Well, this is, this is a good example. Good question. Okay.
00:23:41.464 - 00:26:22.640, Speaker A: The next we go into topological groups, and one of the most interesting and useful results that I've showed is that for g and h, where now they're topological groups. Oh, sorry. We only have to look at a single, single, single topological group. Then the map that sends elements in g to where. And this is from g to g, this map is a homeomorphism. And to show this, we can, we can define like the decomposed elevate into the map, and then we just show that this map is continuous and this is continuous. Um, by assumption, since g is a topological group, so their composition is, um, uh, again continuous.
00:26:22.640 - 00:28:26.424, Speaker A: And from here we can, we can use this property to prove a lot of things. For example, um, if g and h are topological group. Oh, sorry, sorry. And, and phi is a homomorphism from group g to h, then to show that it's continuous, we only have to show that this thing is continuous at one point. And then I'll the proof. So basically, f, being a homeomorphism, implies that f is a open mappings. So since f is an open mappings, we know that for any open sets that's being in g, any translation of that open set is again open.
00:28:26.424 - 00:29:05.524, Speaker A: And then, so for every. So to show that vi is continuous everywhere, we just have, we just pick an arbitrary point and show that it's continuous. And since vi is continuous at one point, I can assume that it's for. Now, let's suppose that single point is the. .1 so vi is continuous at one. And I will show that, that will imply that Vi is actually continuous at every point.
00:29:05.524 - 00:30:41.828, Speaker A: So y is continuous at one implies that for any open set in age that is open, there exists a open set in G that covers the .1 such that the image of you is contained in, in v. And then the proof of this is that we first pick a point, arbitrary point in g, and pick a open set vg in h that covers the elements 5g. Then we may shift it, we may translate it so that this open set covers the elements one. So we can shift it by, um, by this element. And this, this open set now covers the elements, um. Uh, in which case we know that this is the identity of each.
00:30:41.828 - 00:31:19.424, Speaker A: And then by our assumption, there's an open set that's in G that covers the element one. But then if we translate it by 5g, then this open set covers the elements. And then when we. Wait, sorry, sorry. I shouldn't write this. I should just write g. Sorry.
00:31:19.424 - 00:32:31.814, Speaker A: Then when we take the image of this set, then this set is an open set that's included in the, in, like vg. In this case, covers. Yeah, yeah. Covers this coverage. Sorry. And then, in particular, this homeomorphism does not only gives us this result, it also gives us that for any set v, whenever v is compact, a translation of an elements in g will again gives us a compact set. Since this is a continuous function as well as a closed set, then any translation of that close set is again, close.
00:32:31.814 - 00:32:53.094, Speaker A: And so I think this is a very useful thing at proving if a topological group is locally compact, because then we only have to find a single point that's covered by a compact set, then we can translate that compact set so that it covers, like, any points we want in the group.
00:32:54.234 - 00:33:05.574, Speaker B: Didn't quite catch that statement. Is it not true for any topological group, that continuity is enough to have it as a single point?
00:33:06.594 - 00:33:16.934, Speaker A: Because, so we know that any translation of the compact group.
00:33:32.054 - 00:33:38.394, Speaker B: Well, what is the original? What's the business over here?
00:33:39.454 - 00:33:45.284, Speaker A: This shows that continues the arbitrary g that we picked.
00:33:47.664 - 00:33:48.200, Speaker D: That's true.
00:33:48.232 - 00:33:50.324, Speaker C: That the phase continues.
00:33:53.304 - 00:34:35.400, Speaker B: Okay, but that's just because, I mean, if you have any topological space and you have a map influence some other topological space, continuity means continuity. Continuity at every point. Okay, but if any two points are connected by homeworkers, obviously that's true. It's enough to look at one point. That's a trivial statement. Any top logical group, if you have translations or how many models take one for any. But what's the new statement?
00:34:35.552 - 00:34:55.312, Speaker A: So, so we know that this, this map is a homeopath. So this map, this map right here. Yeah, yeah. So this map is a homeomorphism. So this is also a continuous map. So it maps compact set to compact set.
00:34:55.488 - 00:34:56.648, Speaker B: Well, what's the question?
00:34:56.776 - 00:35:15.244, Speaker A: Okay, so week three, I'm clicking claiming that I think this might be trivial now, but since this maps, maps compact sets to compact sets, you're proving something. What's the actual. I'm not proving something. I'm stating.
00:35:15.544 - 00:35:20.792, Speaker D: We're pointing out that you can prove local compactness in a simpler way using this fact.
00:35:20.888 - 00:35:21.524, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:23.664 - 00:35:29.364, Speaker D: You want to check. You want to check that your group is locally compact path the fortress or the theory.
00:35:29.984 - 00:35:35.284, Speaker B: Well, okay, so you're just like moving from a single point.
00:35:43.744 - 00:35:44.764, Speaker A: Yeah. So.
00:35:52.144 - 00:36:01.644, Speaker B: Arbitrary point to arbitrary point then compact sets will go to compact sense neighborhood neighborhoods.
00:36:02.024 - 00:36:02.804, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:04.504 - 00:36:27.424, Speaker B: Okay. Well, yeah, you have to check if that's true that open neighborhoods go to open neighborhoods. So if every open neighborhood contains a qualified neighborhood and that will be true for all points, you have to check if it goes through the steps.
00:36:31.084 - 00:36:31.396, Speaker A: Is.
00:36:31.420 - 00:36:32.524, Speaker D: It going to stop.
