00:00:02.920 - 00:00:20.594, Speaker A: So it's time. So welcome, everyone, after the break. And it is my pleasure to have Alessandro Mangusi from University of Bergamo, and he will be talking about the Duria mission space on the single upper half space, and Yvonne Belgium. So please.
00:00:21.734 - 00:01:13.894, Speaker B: Okay, so thank you. And so I thank the organizer for the opportunity to give a talk here in this, in this workshop, in this week of this focus program. And thank you, the audience to be here. So, as you can see, I will talk about the Drury address on space, which is the main character of this week, but not in the classical setting of the unit pole, but in the setting of the sigra apparatus space. And I will talk about the one noman type inequality in this setting. And I will try to motivate a little bit at least, why I think it is nice or useful to have also the druid space in this setting. So the work I will talk about is a joint work with Nicola Arcoti, Nicolas Salmukis, Marco Pelosi, and Maura Salvatore.
00:01:13.894 - 00:01:51.278, Speaker B: So I will spend the first minutes to actually recall a little bit of basic facts that I'm sure we all know about. But I will do it anyway just to have a common notation and the common setting. Okay, so h will be a reproducing kernel, the space. So I have a space of functional domain omega, and the point evaluation is bounded. So I have a reproducing kernel, kz in h, such that f of z is f inner product kz for olf in h. Then let us consider b. D plus one is the unit bool in cd plus one.
00:01:51.278 - 00:02:31.934, Speaker B: So here I want to point out the fact that my dimension is d plus one. And it will be clear later why I use this dimension, d one. And so in particular, the case d equals zero is actually the one dimensional case, the complex plane. And as we actually saw, already saw this morning with Mikel Michel lecture, we can consider on the unit. Well, for a given parameter nu greater than minus b minus two, this well known family of reproducing kernels. Okay, so this family include Bergman spaces, Wetbar Bergman spaces, all spaces that we all know about. So we have the hardest space on the unit ball.
00:02:31.934 - 00:02:55.544, Speaker B: For nu equals minus one. The Bergman space is for nu equals zero. When nu goes to minus d minus two, we actually have the limit case, which is the duration space. And the kernel look a little bit different. We have a logarithm. And for nu equals minus d minus one, we have the drury drawn. So here I ask you for forgiveness, because I'm using this non standard notation.
00:02:55.544 - 00:03:28.284, Speaker B: I apologize, but we started using this notation with micro laborators and we add a lot of age in the paper. We also, for the Eisenberg group and stuff like that. And so we use this non standard notation. I hope it will not confuse you. So this is the kernel of the Drury outer stone space. So as we saw this morning in Mika lecture, this is the norm of a Drury harvest function. If we f as this power series expansion, and this is the norm.
00:03:28.284 - 00:04:19.674, Speaker B: And as actually Michael also mentioned, we do have an, also an exact integral representation for this norm. This is just a curiosity, but I will show it to you anyway, because if we have r to be the radial derivative which is defined like this, and we set this, we introduce these differential operators. Crypt zero is the identity. And we define script rk to be the identity plus the radial derivative over k of script rk minus one. Then if you consider this differential operator, you actually have this identity. You have that the norm of the square of the norm of the derivative normal function f is equal to that dimensional constant. And here you have the l two norm of this script RD derivative of f, let's say with respect to this weight here.
00:04:19.674 - 00:05:08.764, Speaker B: Okay, this is an identity. It's not hard to check it. And okay, actually, this differential operator were introduced by Marco Pelosi in his PhD thesis in 1992. But you can also take a look at the recent paper by arcoti, myself, Pelosi and Salvatore. So now let me now recall you. The von Neumann inequality. So if h is an Ilberg space and t is a contraction from h to h, then we know that for any polynomial PC, then the operator norm of pt is controlled by the multiplier operator associated to the polynomial p as a multiplier operator on the hard space, which coincides with the l infinity norm of p.
00:05:08.764 - 00:06:34.844, Speaker B: And then we know that this result has been generalized by Drury in what it is now that the druid space. So we have now a vector of d plus one operator t, one td plus one of linear operators on the Hilbert space age, such that they all commute with each other and they are a row contraction, meaning that these identity holes, okay, these are inequality holes. And now we know that if p is a complex polynomial in z one zd plus one variable, then the norm of pt is controlled by the norm of the multiplier operator associated to p as a multiplier active on the Drury aerodyson space. So what I will do in the next minute is to give a kind of a result of this kind in the setting of the Siglr perhaps space. Okay, so what is the sigra pair of space or sigal space is this following domain in Cd plus one is the domain given by the pair zd one in Cd. So this z is in cd times c. So that's basically the reason why my dimension is cd plus one, such that the imaginary part of zd plus one is greater than one over four, which is just a dimensional constant, normalization constant, the mod square of z.
00:06:34.844 - 00:07:28.798, Speaker B: So I use the dimension cd plus one because as you can see, the last direction, the last component zd plus one has, let's say a special role as is different than the first d direction. Then I also introduced these coordinates that actually will not really use, but these are called the Eisenberg coordinates. And it will be clear later why that we can describe this domain as follows, as the point z t plus I over four, z squared plus ih, such that z is in cd. So the latin z and the greek z actually is just a different notation. T is the real part of zd plus one. And for the imaginary part we write I over four mod square of z plus ih. So if h is equal to zero, then we are on the boundary of the domain.
00:07:28.798 - 00:07:56.456, Speaker B: If h is positive, we are in the interior in the domain. So h is a sort of eight over the boundary of the domain, let's say. And so in this setting as well, we can consider the analog family of reproducing kernel spaces we saw on the unit ball, which is the family of reproducing kernel spaces associated to this family of kernels. So the kernel look like this. Okay. And so we have omega d. Okay.
00:07:56.456 - 00:09:01.274, Speaker B: A constant which depends on d and nu. Omega d plus one minus d bar d plus one over two, I minus one over four. And this is the emission product in cd between omega and z. So also in this setting, this family of spaces is, I mean, it's not as known as in the unit ball, but for sure the most classical spaces are well known, such as the hardest space, the Bergman space. We actually studied in my paper together with the Arcoti, Pelosi and Salvatore, a little bit of the durish space in this setting and the Drury Harveston space in this setting, which corresponds also in this setting to the case nu equal minus d minus one. Okay, so this is the kernel we are interested in. So how you obtain this kernel is quite, I mean, you obtain this family of kernel because at least if you consider the Bergmann space, you can just use biologism with the unit ball and you obtain via the standard transformation role for the Bergman kernels, what is the candidate kernel? Then you can study the whole family of kernels.
00:09:01.274 - 00:10:09.220, Speaker B: So, okay, but why we consider the Sigra space, what's the point to consider this family of domain in this setting? So for one, first, okay, the figure half space is a biomorphic copy of the unit ball, but it is an unbounded biomorphic copy of the unit ball. So for sure, on one end, you can obtain or at least understand what can happen on the half plane via biomorphism with the unit ball. But not all the results actually transfer, can transfer trivially via biolomorphism. And from the theory of function, from the point of view of function theory, still, it is an abundant domain. So also, I mean, the function theory on the half plane and the function on the unit disk is not similar, but it's not completely the same. And the half space actually is somehow the sigalap space is somehow the correct generalization of the half plane in several variables. Also in the sigra space, what you do is actually somehow you break the symmetry of the ball.
00:10:09.220 - 00:10:50.420, Speaker B: I mean, it is a bielomorph to the unit ball via the Kelly transform, but you break the symmetry, meaning that we saw the definition, the ZT plus one direction is different than the others. I mean, it's a transversal direction to the boundary. And so this breaking the symmetry, not all the variables are the same now as in the unit ball. So this actually can help you to understand a little bit what's going on. And maybe you can use the point of view of the sigraphs plane to understand actually things on the unit board. So to go the other way around. And also a very important thing is that the boundary of the SIGGRAPH space can actually be identified with the assembled group.
00:10:50.420 - 00:11:53.908, Speaker B: And this is very important because this provides us a lot of tools from harmonic analysis on groups that allows us to study these spaces. Okay, this harmonic analysing group is very well developed, and we have a very flexible tool that can be used to study these spaces. And let's say that on the unit ball, you have a non morphine function and you can study it, and you actually do study the spaces using the power series expansion of the function, which is somehow the analog of studying using the harmonic analysis here on the group. But maybe it's not that sometimes the power series function is not that flexible, let's say. And also the c glass phase, okay, is biomorphic to the unit wall. So you can understand it's a good starting point to actually generalize to more general domains, which are called homogeneous single domains. And here I only recall some recent work by Carl Sampel, and they have a lot of references in their work.
00:11:53.908 - 00:12:29.160, Speaker B: So I refer you to take a look at the reference in their paper. So this is a motivation, I mean, of why I think it is worth to study these spaces in this set. So, let's take a look at a function theoretic description of the druid aversion space on the Sigler space. So let be rho of z z one is the defining function of the domain. So the imaginary part of zd plus one minus one over four mod square of z, and then f. A function f is in the druid some space. If two fins hold.
00:12:29.160 - 00:13:03.856, Speaker B: We have that here. We consider the derivative of order till from j that goes from zero to d minus one. And we derive with respect to the last variable. And we add this weight here, where this weight here is just the defining function. And we require this limit to be zero when the imaginary part of zd plus one goes to infinity, and the norm is given by this quantity. Here we are integrating the d derivative with respect to the last variable is an l two norm. And here we have this weight here and this weight here.
00:13:03.856 - 00:13:49.784, Speaker B: I could have put them this way together. Sorry. And so you can think of this as we actually saw this this morning with Michael, where here you had in the unit ball you had the radial derivative, and here, instead of this row function, here you have one minus modulus model z squared. Okay, so this is kind of the basis obolev description of the norm from the reaction space. Okay, so this is our domain, this is the kernel of our space. And let us now introduce the operators we are dealing with. So we define a vector of operator a, one ad plus one to be a single dissipative vector of p operators on an elb speed h.
00:13:49.784 - 00:14:32.672, Speaker B: And we require the following. We ask for the first d operators, a one ad to be bounded. We require the last operator to be closed, densely defined, and we ask the resolvent of Iad plus one to contain the positive half line. We require the first d operators to commute with each other and to strongly commute with the last operator. So the last operator is not required to be bounded. So we need the definition of commutativity between a notion of commutative between the last operator and the first d operators. And finally, we have this requirement of disruptivity, let's say.
00:14:32.672 - 00:15:49.238, Speaker B: So we require the imaginary part of the inner product of ad plus one, b inner product v to be greater or equal to one over four, and this sum here. So, as you can imagine, of course, this condition is model on the kernel of our space. In particular, I want to stress out the fact that by the Lummer Phillips theorem, this condition, the condition two, condition four, we actually have that Iad plus one is the infinitesimal generator of semigroup of contraction. And all these contractions, they all commute with the first a operator aj with j that goes from one to okay, so this is our cell and this is the theorem. We proved that given such a vector of operators, and let us consider for any tau j negative tau j for j that goes from one to d, we consider the operator mj, which is defined in this way, so e to the minus I tau j ad plus one aj. So is the composition of one of the contraction of the semi group generated by Iad plus one with aj. And we consider the analog function in zd plus one zd.
00:15:49.238 - 00:16:52.104, Speaker B: Okay, so e minus I tau jz plus one zj. And then we have that for any complex polynomial of d variable, not d plus one, this is not a type of d variable. We have that the norm of the polynomial in the big m one md variable. So we have a polynomial in in this operator here is controlled by the norm of the polynomial of the polynomial p in the variable little m, one little md, and this is the norm of the multiplier operator associated to this polynomial. Let's say on acting on the druid space, on the siga space. So I want to point out a thing here that we do actually need to to this tau j to be negative, strictly negative, because if not, this function here are turn out to be, they are not multiplier for the drill Arves on space. If tau j is zero, this is no longer a multiplier.
00:16:52.104 - 00:17:55.824, Speaker B: So what I'm saying is that the multiplication by a coordinate is not a bounded operator in our setting. And this is an effect, meaning that there is a paper by Ambrosia Anglican Muller for about von Neumann inequalities in general setting in Cn. But they do require in their spaces as an axiomatic, define some spaces axiomatically, and they do require the multiplication by coordinates to be a bounded operator. And this is not the case for us, and it is in the nature of the space we are considering. So now we'll spend a little bit about the proof of this theorem and okay, how to prove this theorem. Actually, if at least you assume all the operators to be bounded, you can surely obtain a proof of this theorem by using the Kelly transform and the biolomorphicity with the unit ball and the classical inequality on the unit ball. And this was actually pointed us to, pointed us out by Michelarts.
00:17:55.824 - 00:18:59.546, Speaker B: But we can, but what we do is we prefer to follow a direct approach because, and actually following in the step of Drury's original proof, because in doing so, we actually develop a little bit of machinery in this setting that I think we think can be useful or interesting in its own and maybe can be useful, you know, to study. Now we have these multiplier operators arise naturally. So maybe it would be interesting to study in this setting invariant subspaces with respect to these multiplier operators and stuff like that. So the proof is based on the following fact that this diagram commutes. And so now I will try to tell you a little bit, what are the objects in this diagram? Okay, so here, this is the given Hilbert space. And this actually is a multi index notation. A to the gamma is e one to the gamma one, e two to the gamma two, and so on till ad to the gamma D.
00:18:59.546 - 00:19:27.780, Speaker B: And this is a bounded operator. And this is immediately follows from the definition of sigal dissipative vector of commuting operators that we used. Now we have this altruist space. What is this l two space? So d mu. So here we are living on nD. So the d production that of. And so this is the product of d copies of the natural numbers times the negative real line.
00:19:27.780 - 00:20:31.294, Speaker B: And we have this measured dimu, which is some weighted measure. Here you can read the weight, maybe it won't tell you anything, I think. But here, I'm just saying that D alpha is the counting measure on nb and d lambda is the Lebega measure on the negative real line. So what is this space? How, why would we have this measure and why we have this l two space? Okay, this space is just a copy of the druid spaces, meaning that we have a map from these l two space into Da, which is a subjective isometry. And the map has looked explicitly like this. I think it will not tell you much because it's quite a complicated formula if you read it for the first time. But what I want to point out is that this is just a, just, this is a precise, a more precise formulation of the paly linear theorem for da, meaning this is nothing more than the, the inverse Fourier function on the isomer group for a given, for a given function on the drury harvest on space.
00:20:31.294 - 00:21:18.952, Speaker B: Okay, because I recall you that the boundary of our domain can be identified with the Asimber group. And if you use the Eisenberg coordinates zth that I introduced before that, maybe you already forgot about them, but we have some special coordinates that somehow reflect the geometry of the group and of the domain. And you have this formula here, which maybe is new for you, or maybe not, but this is just the inverse Fourier transform on the Asimir group. So this is a well known object, and this is the plancheral formula that you have the druid. So normal is given by the l two norm of the Fourier transform. So the Fourier transform of the group of a function. F is a family of operator Sigma lambda f.
00:21:18.952 - 00:22:06.316, Speaker B: Sigma lambda f is a family of Ilberschmitt operator. And we have this Planchet formal. So here, I don't want to go into details because they are too complicated, but I want just the takeaway message is we have the Fourier transform on the boundary. And these l two spaces is the image of the druid average space via the Fourier transform of the boundary value of the function in the our duria space, since the, and we use the fact that boundary of our, the sigal space is there as in the group. Okay? So here we use the harmonic analysis on the group. And then, of course, we, so we know now why we have this l two space. And now we consider h value function.
00:22:06.316 - 00:22:52.154, Speaker B: So here we go from g to the domain of the last operator ad plus one. We consider a new norm here where this delta norm is the following one. So here we are really somehow following. We are in the step of Druid's original proof on the unit board, okay? And so here we, here is where our dissipative condition on the operators plays a role. Okay? So now, okay, I told you. What are all these objects? Now, theta, as you can imagine, is now is an isometric embedding from our space to this l two space. And so here is the isometric bending, specifically given we do have this isometric bedding.
00:22:52.154 - 00:23:50.454, Speaker B: And, and finally, we have this last operator here, which is a star. Tens of identity is a shift. If we have gamma in n d and a negative tau, then s gamma Tau phi is this weighted shift operator, and it is abandoned operator on l two. And it is unitarily equivalent to the multiplier operator on the drillier with multiplier, this multiplier here. So we have the exponential in the last component and the multiplication by the first d coordinates, okay? And then s star is the adjunct. This is the split expression, okay, the formula complicated to read, but this is a weighted shear operator, okay? Which is unit really equivalent to this multiplier operator on our space. And then we tensor with identity.
00:23:50.454 - 00:24:29.040, Speaker B: Okay, so we will. So here, now we are done. I told you everything. And just to recap, is h is the Hilbert space and a one ad plus one are the given operators. So this l two space is, for us, just the Fourier transform of the, of our dual artificial space. This operator here is well defined and bounded because of our assumption. This weighted shift operator is the Fourier transform of the multiplier operator associated to this multiplier, and theta is an isometric bed.
00:24:29.040 - 00:25:08.914, Speaker B: So we can represent any such operator which arise from a single dissipative vector of the community operators as a weighted shift operator on this two space. Okay? And now the proof follows, because, as you can imagine, this is now the, the inequality we want to prove. Now, let us forget about a sum. Just prove it for one, for only one term. So we have the h norm of this object here. We use the symmetric embedding, and then we use the fact that our commutative diagram. Okay.
00:25:08.914 - 00:25:57.286, Speaker B: And so on. So here, now we. We have the weighted shift theta, and then we use the boundless theta, the boundlessness of the weighted shift, and the fact that the weighted shift is unitarily equivalent to our multiplier on the druid axon space. And the conclusion follows. So what's the takeaway message? This is a new point of view, maybe not new. I think point of view on a well known space maybe can be useful to study these, some problems in this setting that can maybe, hopefully, it will be useful to have this point of view and will answer to some problem on the unit ball or the other way around. And so, this is it.
00:25:57.286 - 00:26:00.314, Speaker B: I think my time is over. So thank you for your attention.
00:26:04.504 - 00:26:09.844, Speaker A: Okay, so, thank you very much for this talk. So, is there any question or comments?
00:26:15.744 - 00:26:21.804, Speaker C: I have a question, two questions. The first one is, what is your demu.
00:26:23.024 - 00:26:39.026, Speaker B: DEMU is. Sorry. Is this weighted measure here? Where is it? Is this weighted measure here? Okay.
00:26:39.090 - 00:26:46.494, Speaker C: Okay, thank you. And the third one is, do we know the zero sets of the da space?
00:26:47.994 - 00:26:48.826, Speaker B: Sorry?
00:26:49.010 - 00:26:51.826, Speaker C: Do we know the zero set of.
00:26:51.890 - 00:26:55.234, Speaker B: The da space of the drill arson space?
00:26:55.614 - 00:27:00.894, Speaker C: Yeah. Because with your polyvinyl theorem.
00:27:01.054 - 00:27:01.654, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:01.774 - 00:27:09.238, Speaker C: We can do the kind of maybe moons type theorem on l two. On your l two space.
00:27:09.406 - 00:27:25.564, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I see what you're saying. I don't think we. I mean, I do not know, actually. I don't think we have a description of the zero set of the druid space in this setting. I don't know. At least I don't know it.
00:27:27.344 - 00:27:28.244, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:27:28.664 - 00:27:35.764, Speaker B: Thank you for your question. Sorry, not to be helpful, but thank you. Okay.
00:27:36.864 - 00:27:39.444, Speaker A: Is there any other question for Alessandro?
00:27:41.024 - 00:28:19.138, Speaker B: Yes, Alessandro, is. Is for the. Is the sheloff boundary the same as the. As the topological boundary? Okay. Is the shield of boundary as the same as the topological boundary in. For the Shiloh here, I think that here in the Sigil space, they do conside. If you consider more general, homogeneous sigil domain, then this.
00:28:19.138 - 00:28:35.654, Speaker B: You have a difference. The sigil bound in the Shiloh boundary and the topological boundary. But in my setting here, I think this is the same as the Shiloh boundary. The Shiloh boundary. Anthropological boundary. Here they conside. Thank you for your question.
00:28:37.074 - 00:28:47.274, Speaker A: Okay, so is there any other question for Alessandro? If not, next time, thank the speaker again.
00:28:48.454 - 00:28:48.894, Speaker B: Thank you.
