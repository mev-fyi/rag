00:00:03.520 - 00:00:58.744, Speaker A: Welcome back, everybody. So we are continuing discussing example of Lce, which is given by slit domains. And let me try to slightly generalize this example. So now let us allow curve gamma that we consider to be self touching, meaning that it can return to itself, but it can never cross itself. This is very important. And let us look at the component of d of the complement of this curve containing zero. And kt would be complement of this domain.
00:00:58.744 - 00:01:38.364, Speaker A: So here, omega. This kt would be not only the curve, but a part of disk which is kind of followed by the curve. By this time. Again, crossed or continuity is easy. And this is yet another example of Leonard chain. Now, let us normalize things. So let us try to make sure that we really don't care about with which speed we go through these domains.
00:01:38.364 - 00:02:29.454, Speaker A: We're essentially only interested in trajectory. And there is one natural way to define time. And this is given here by an easy quantity derivative of ft in zero. So this ft prime of zero, it's a continuous function like crossed order continuity. At zero, it's one tends to zero by the last condition, its monotone by this condition. And again, continuity, as we discussed, by crossed or continuity. So we can re parameterize it.
00:02:29.454 - 00:03:29.548, Speaker A: So we can see the parameterization in which a of t is equal to e to the minus t. So we simply change time such that at time t, your derivative at zero would be e to the minus t. By the way, why do we have strict monotonous here? Because if the domain decrease strictly, then the derivative becomes strictly smaller, gained by Schwarz lemma. Okay, so now, finally, definition of normalized Leonard chain. And from now on, all my Leonard chains will be normalized. I will always consider them in this natural parameterization. These are all the conditions, one, two, three for the map of t, or one to four fraud domain omega t.
00:03:29.548 - 00:04:32.906, Speaker A: And we add this normalization that we consider maps, which at time t would have derivative exactly e to the minus t. Okay, so now let's try to derive differential equation. So, amazingly, any such thing can be parameterized by a family of measures on the real line. So again, here we have growing family of objects in the disk and all we need to do is family of measures. Well, in this model, not on real line, on the unit circle. So we parameterize something two dimensional by something one dimensional. And the reason for this magic is, again, because we got rid of the rate of growth.
00:04:32.906 - 00:05:29.134, Speaker A: So we parameterized naturally. Okay, so now let us introduce very important transfer function phi st of z, which would simply be f inverse applied to ft. This is defined for s less than t, because otherwise fs and were simply not defined NFT. And it's a map from disk to disk, this derivative at zero equal to e to the s minus t. And sometimes I will use these notations that phi st of z I will denote by physi St. And so this is a motivational picture with our example. So we run our curve for gamma up to gamma of s.
00:05:29.134 - 00:06:15.714, Speaker A: Then we run it up to gamma of t. We consider the corresponding map of t. Then we map back by fs. So what is not mapped back by fs is this real, is this thing which would become an arc here. Again, only in this example in general, it would define become some sort of extra growth here in the disk. And then firest is just a map from disk to disk, which essentially just map it to a slightly smaller thing. So this is phi s t.
00:06:15.714 - 00:07:04.414, Speaker A: And what is very important for us is the chain relation. So suppose that s is less or equal than t, is less or equal than tau. Then you can decompose phi z tau as phi zst compose with phi st. So phi z theta composed with st. And this is because, well, this is trivial because fs inverse f tau is composition of s inverse and f t and f t inverse and f tau. So again, one of the easier but important properties, this chain relations, let's remember them. And now the crucial observation.
00:07:04.414 - 00:08:06.606, Speaker A: So here we will take into account the fact that we are growing, that our sets kt are growing. So we consider, well, this seems like a strange and artificial thing, but let's play with it. So we know that phi St maps disk to disk. So, as we discussed, this guy, z minus phi st z plus phi st of z would map to the upper half plane. I'm sorry, not to the upper half, to the right half plane. Real part of this is positive. Now, we need to map zero to one, and that's why we need to multiply by this factor, because you can easily see that this is exactly derivative of the upper part at zero.
00:08:06.606 - 00:09:15.304, Speaker A: This is the derivative of the lower part while you divide by z standard. So this pst of z is now in class P. So remember, class p analytic functions, this positive real part, and p of zero is equal to one. That is where we leverage the fact, again, that we are growing so far, St maps disk to disk. And there are other models of luovner evolution which we would consider. They all essentially make use of this observation. Now, by her glot pst of z is sum, her gloss integral psi plus z of psi minus z d mu now, where is this thing supported? It's supported, remember, on the closure of the set on the boundary where this thing real part of this thing does not tend to zero.
00:09:15.304 - 00:10:01.484, Speaker A: This is exactly when phi does not tend to one. And again, let me be rigorous here. Again. So here, for example, on this picture, it would be supported on pre image of this little squiggle of this little arc on the fire. Remember, by crossado erythrium, which we just discussed, fire steel, in this situation, is extendable up to the boundary. So we can talk about premature the squiggle and all this. Okay, so this is.
00:10:01.484 - 00:10:39.870, Speaker A: We won't need this observation for this part. We'll need it when we derive more specific Leonard evolution for our example, for Leonard's chain generated by curves. But for now, okay, let's just make this observation. And now the key trick. So this was the key observation key trick. Let us try to take time derivative of ft. So we differentiate ft with respect to t.
00:10:39.870 - 00:11:19.644, Speaker A: So what do we have to do? We fix z. And we say that this is ft of z minus f s of z divided by t minus s. Let's now do this trick. Remember that ft is fs composed with phi st, that this Phi st was subordinating ft to fs by our definition. Aha. So this is, this looks now like a derivative of fs with respect to space, not time. Let's play with it a bit more.
00:11:19.644 - 00:11:48.784, Speaker A: So this is fs. Phi st of z minus fs of z. Phi st of z minus z multiplied by phi s. T of z minus z divided by t minus s. Let's play with it a bit more. So this thing is good. So let's keep it.
00:11:48.784 - 00:12:05.368, Speaker A: Now, I want to see something like this. I want this. Pst. So here it goes. I write this as z minus five, z plus five, S. T. One plus e to the s minus t, one minus e to the s minus t.
00:12:05.368 - 00:12:32.904, Speaker A: Exactly. This guy. And I have to multiply by what I added. So est minus one, one plus estimate. Z plus phi st of z divided by t minus x. So this identity is so important for us that we call it star. And let's remember that pst of z has herbal representation.
00:12:32.904 - 00:13:16.960, Speaker A: Okay, so this is the trick. We represent this time derivative of f through space, derivative of fs multiplied by some function from pst multiplied by a factor which we would be able to control in a moment. Okay, so now let us very formally do this. So let's let t go to s. So, what I am saying now is handwriting. I just want you to see why what would happen next makes sense. What happens when t goes to s? Let's look here.
00:13:16.960 - 00:14:11.954, Speaker A: This is just as promised, time derivative of ft. What happens here? This is ft prime. Now, if this mu st would convert to some measure mu t, then this part would converge to this. And finally, this whole thing converges to minus z, right? Because this is z phi t of z goes to z when t goes to s. So this becomes z, so two z, and this est minus t divided by t minus s, that's minus one. And then finally this divide by two. So this is minus z.
00:14:11.954 - 00:15:01.934, Speaker A: Okay, so nothing too exciting. But of course, this is totally non rigorous. Why would this limit exists? Okay, so what is non rigorous here? Let's be now very careful. This limit when s goes to t exists and indeed equal to ft prime of z, because we know that phi st of z converges to z. So that's the definition of the derivative. This limit exists, so this minus z. Also, totally honestly, what is not clear is why either this limit exists or this limit exists.
00:15:01.934 - 00:15:47.822, Speaker A: So why either this converges to this or this converges to some dimity. And the first thing we would prove, we would prove that actually this exists. Almost surely that will show us that actually the limit of this exists. And then spatial situation of chain generated by curves will do opposite, will show that this exists. And actually, muti would always be a very special delta measure. And so this derivative would exist everywhere. But first, again, general theorem.
00:15:47.822 - 00:17:03.354, Speaker A: So let's prove luvner equation. And for this, we need first this lemma about a priori continuity of ft in terms of first in terms of t, and then the same, we need a priori continuity of phi tu. So phi, tu and phi that they're actually close to each other. Okay, so what would be important is that these bounds are universal. Okay, so how do we first process? Well, we know that, remember what PST of z, that's our PST of z. This is a guy from class P. So we know that this is bounded above by one plus zero or one minus zero.
00:17:03.354 - 00:17:37.654, Speaker A: So we know that phi st of z minus z is bounded by phi st of z plus z multiplied by this, multiplied by this bound, one plus z divided by y minus z. This in turn is bounded. Well, of course, remember, phi st is bounded by z by short. So this is two z, one plus z, one minus z, one minus est. So this is this estimate when u is equal to zero. But that's enough. For example, let me show how we obtain this.
00:17:37.654 - 00:18:21.314, Speaker A: Now, so what is f z, t minus f zs. This is integral from z to phi of z of f prime of derivative of fs. Why? Because fzt, remember what it was ft was f composed with phi st. So we simply can write that this is. So this is our trick. We move from time difference to space difference. So this is just integral from this to this of f prime.
00:18:21.314 - 00:19:17.674, Speaker A: By distortion theorem, we can estimate this and here, where this factor e to the minus s would come from, because derivative of fs at zero is e to the minus s. So we have bound on this, and we have bound on the length of this interval. That's the bound. And after that settles, that's the estimate that we get, and exactly the same, but using chain relations. Now we would get this. So we reduce phi t u to phi su compose this phi st, and then we have exactly the same integral. And the only reason why we have different bound here is that derivative of phi su at zero is different.
00:19:17.674 - 00:20:00.734, Speaker A: It's e to the s minus u. Okay, now this means that this map for fixed z is almost surely differential almost every way differential for almost every t, because Liebz maps. And this is Lipschitz. Right. So there almost everywhere differentiable. Good. Now let's look at this exciting equation again.
00:20:00.734 - 00:21:10.600, Speaker A: So, we know that limit of the left hand side exists almost everywhere or false here. How do I know that it exists? False, because I know that I can do it for countable dense sets. So, for countable dense set, this limit exists. Limit when t go, stress exists for all elements of this set. And then we use uniform continuity of all these objects here on compacts to get that. In fact, this limit exists for the same time for all z on the unit disk, not just on this dance countable set. So again, this is actually a fine point, which is sometimes missed in the textbooks.
00:21:10.600 - 00:21:55.144, Speaker A: You need to do this first for accountable set. And another technical difficulty. Sorry about that. Let's see when I can connect back. Okay. Okay. And so, what do we have now? Suppose that t goes to s.
00:21:55.144 - 00:22:55.622, Speaker A: Then let's look carefully at everything. We know that this limit converges to fs prime by crossed or continuity again. Now I already said it, but now let's write it carefully. Since we know that phi st converges to z, this limit converges to minus z again by the same thing. And finally, since the limit of the length sign exists, there should be a limit of PST of the when t goes to else for almost every s. And we can do the same when now t less than s and t approaches to s. So the same would would hold.
00:22:55.622 - 00:23:43.826, Speaker A: Exactly. Okay, so what we just did, we just proved one half of the following theorem of Lelmer. So, the theorem is the following. Ft is a normalized Levner chain. If and only first, for every t, f, t is analytic. And t to ft absolutely continues. Well, we know that since this is one half ago, from conformal representation to the theorems to this theorem.
00:23:43.826 - 00:24:22.822, Speaker A: Of course, by our exciting lemma, this gives us more than absolute continuity. They actually lip sheets. But here, all we want, we want that for hz, you are absolutely continuous. So you are defined by your almost every wartime derived. And notice that here we don't assume that they are conformal, they just analytic. So we say ft is a normalized Leonard chain, if and only if this is absolutely continuous, and then it satisfies. So let's be very specific.
00:24:22.822 - 00:25:08.422, Speaker A: They exist immeasurable in t family of functions from p. So we don't assume any continuity in time. No, just measurable family of functions from p such that for almost every t, the derivative exists. Time derivative exists and is equal to this. Exactly. The construction the differential equation. Again, that's why we need that absolute continuity here, because we want to be able to say that we know the derivative just for almost every t.
00:25:08.422 - 00:25:59.284, Speaker A: And we can define this ft from this equations. Okay, so one half of the theorem is proved. If you have a normalized Leviner chain, then we can do this exciting thing, then normalize Leonard chain. It satisfies this equation always. And for this, to prove this thing, well, we now need to prove the other direction. And to do this, we'll actually approve another theorem of Leonard Kufariv. I will state it in a moment.
00:25:59.284 - 00:26:53.424, Speaker A: And let me do first derive an equation for phi, st of z for normal for Leonard chain. So let's differentiate ft of z with respect to s, right? So s is independent of t. So, of course, this. So let me actually modify it a bit and let me write it more carefully. So, s derivative of f t. It's obviously zero. But what is it? It's s derivative of f of phi, st of z of fs at ph.
00:26:53.424 - 00:27:56.082, Speaker A: Okay, so this guy, by chain rule, is s derivative of f at the point phi, s plus f prime at the, .5s multiplied by s derivative of phi, s t of z. But we know that by Leovner equation, we have this, right? So I just apply the to the point phi. So dds at this point phi, s is phi, p prime of phi, f prime of phi, s this minus sign. And now we know that f prime is not zero. So we just plug this in here and divide by f prime to get this exciting equation. Okay, so far, you might ask me, well, what are you doing? You're going in opposite direction.
00:27:56.082 - 00:28:53.068, Speaker A: We want to show that if you have this equation, you have a chain, and you seem to be starting with opposite. You are saying, okay, if I have a Leonard chain, then transfer function would satisfy this equation. Okay, but this would be kind of a motivation. Now, let me also remark that if j's is inverse of fs, then actually, by exactly the same reason, you can try out like that here. Derivative time derivative of j's is j's multiplied p's at the point j's for every z known guess. So look at this. This is no longer a pde.
00:28:53.068 - 00:29:43.794, Speaker A: So this is definitely a pd because you have derivative and t derivative and z for inverse function, you just have an OD, which is nice. You can just solve for this. And you know how to solve for this. And for transfer function, look, you also have odd, no derivative of phi is involved. So what's the problem with this? Why we didn't start with this? Because it's defined only gas. So this OD is satisfied only for z in omega s. Omega s is shrinking.
00:29:43.794 - 00:30:13.250, Speaker A: So it's a problem. But this is actually satisfied for. Okay. And so with this motivation, we are ready now to define our main equation. So this is our equation. W ds is equal to wps of w. This function satisfies it if it's a transfer function from the other chain.
00:30:13.250 - 00:30:48.394, Speaker A: So what we will do, we would study this equation. We'll study this equation. Notice where is it defined? First of all, it's defined for s less or equal t. And boundary condition here is kind of non standard. Your boundary condition would be at the end point when f is equal to t w t is phi z t z. So w star is this equation where time changes. So it's up to time t.
00:30:48.394 - 00:31:50.404, Speaker A: And at the end ui. So this is your equation. And that's what we would study in the next serum, which is now not just Ljovnir, but it's called Ljovnir Kufriev. And the story is that Ljovnir had some hints of this. And then in this form, it was proven by Pavel Kochufiriv. And suppose that you have p's s in measurable system. And let us solve this equation where we want to assume that this is true just for almost every size.
00:31:50.404 - 00:33:11.784, Speaker A: So we claim that this equation has unique solution, which we call wtz, which is defined for s and zero t. So indeed, we can solve this equation and our boundary condition. More than that, this map is conformal. So, for each fixed s and t, if you start running, if you solve this differential equation, then this map is analytic, but it's not analytic, it's conformal. And now, when you make s equal to zero, this forms normalized l. The statement of Liovnir Kofriv theory that it's purely ethereum in OD. And actually, one of the things people tried for many years since the theorem was invented, is to just derived from standard OD results.
00:33:11.784 - 00:33:58.324, Speaker A: I don't know of any such derivation. The proof would be fairly standard. It will use just an approximation, earlier approximation, but still we need to do a separate group. The equation is single enough so that we cannot, unfortunately, use standard ode results. Okay, so this is a general Leonard Kufriff theorem. And why would Ljovnir Kufariv imply the other direction of Ljovnir theorem? So, start with what we assume in other directions. We have fs absolutely continuous, which satisfy.
00:33:58.324 - 00:35:06.743, Speaker A: So one is absolute continuity, and two is satisfied. Now, what do we do? Here is the following. We look at derivative of fs at the point wtz. So, by chain rule, this is fs prime divided by derivative of w tz with respect to s plus time, derivative of ss at this point w. And then you just plug in the ovnar exactly like in this derivation here. But now we know that f satisfy the over, and that's all we know about f so far. So, this space derivative of this composition, it's zero.
00:35:06.743 - 00:35:55.740, Speaker A: So fs of w t zero. F is constant, so it doesn't change this s. So you can take now s equal to t, and then it becomes ft of z. So it's a constant equal to t. So now, let's remember this notation. From this area from Wt, the conformal app, we have that ft of this f s of phi, st of z. So, in particular, ft of z is f zero of fi of z, which is just phi zero t of z.
00:35:55.740 - 00:36:41.066, Speaker A: It's a Leonard chain. And then we are done. Okay, so this part was very, very now a difficult part. So, let us prove Ljovnir Kufriv, and we specifically use here Picard Lindleyov iterations. So, let us be careful here. Let us fix a point z. So, we are trying, first, we need to show that indeed this has a solution.
00:36:41.066 - 00:37:44.834, Speaker A: And then we'll see that this solution depends analytically on z and then conformally. So, let's try to get the solution fix z absolute value of z would be r. And now let us rewrite this differential equation, differential equation. We can rewrite it, of course, as integral equation. So this is a standard pde trig, or rather od trick that ws should have this form z exponent of minus integral from s to t. And again, it's very easy to see that if you, if your w satisfies this, we only need one direction. Let's take the derivative in s and that you get exactly Levner equation.
00:37:44.834 - 00:39:03.474, Speaker A: And so, what we do next, we do p card in the law. For iterations, we start with w zero of s to be zero wn plus one of s would be just integral iteration of wn. So you just do this. Now, very important moment, we need to use the fact that p is in p, that this little p has positive real part. This implies in particular that wn of z is always less or equal than z. This is very important for us, because again, it's z multiplied by something, and it's exponent of something with positive real part going down. Now, some observations observe first that since p and p, remember we had this universal bound, the derivative is bounded by two over one minus psi squared at every point.
00:39:03.474 - 00:40:10.406, Speaker A: And then if that's another observation, that if real part of n, real part of b was negative, then the difference between the exponents is bounded by a minus b. Okay, so with this in mind, let us play with it. So, let's estimate what happened when we go from wn to wn one. What we want to do, want to show that actually they converge to some function w. And they would converge uniformly as long as absolute value of z is fixed. So bounded. So that would mean that actually the limit would be limit of this function, rather these functions.
00:40:10.406 - 00:41:23.134, Speaker A: And of course it would satisfy, since we can pass to the uniform limit, it would satisfy this integral equation. But for this, as usual in Picard Lindleyov, let's approximate this difference. And, okay, so we just plug in, very stupidly, we use this guy and we plug in it here. So this is just bounded by integral from s to t, p at the point wn minus p in the point wn one minus one. And now this is just bounded by wn minus wn minus one divided by one minus r squared. Again, that's you can simply, because you can integrate from p prime from wn to wn minus one. And you get this bound, exactly this bound.
00:41:23.134 - 00:43:02.084, Speaker A: Okay, so that's why things, so this particular estimate is actually quite non standard, because what you can do, you can use induction to see that actually this goes to zero and goes to zero very fast. But look at what it is. So it's two to the n c s, one minus r, two to zen, and finally n factorial, which would kill everything. But again, so you, you just show it by induction that when you integrate, you pick up one minus r squared factor, you pick up two factor, and then this one over n, you pick up every time you do the integration, because u is sanctioned value t minus s to the, okay, and so that's what we do by induction. And so we know that since the sum of wn plus one minus wn converges, because some of these converges, this limit exists. And now we want dependence on z. So this limit not just exists, it's not just uniformly on compactness, it also exists on uniformly on compact and z.
00:43:02.084 - 00:43:48.314, Speaker A: As long as absolute value of z is less or equal than r, this estimates are uniform. Now let's observe that for fixed s and t, this map is analytic by induction. All right? Because w naught is analytic and wn plus one is defined using wn integrals. So definitely it is analytic in z. Again, because again, this integrals of something analytic in the. So w is also analytic in z. And again by libya, bounded convergence.
00:43:48.314 - 00:44:39.294, Speaker A: This ws satisfies ljovnir differential equation with the correct bounds, because, well, again, when s goes to t, this thing become just, well, this thing becomes one. So this becomes here. So boundary values are okay. And now let us just make this observation. Let's differentiate absolute value of w squared. Well, it's very easy to see that this is just two w squared, a real part of p's of w, almost surely. So w is actually increasing m s.
00:44:39.294 - 00:45:26.604, Speaker A: Now suppose that you have two solutions of this equation. Remember vignette, unique solution. So, suppose that you have two solutions. Then we know that absolute value of the derivative. So, we plug in equation, and this is bounded by some k of r as before, times w minus nu. So this is just from distortion on function p as before. I will go into details here.
00:45:26.604 - 00:46:52.124, Speaker A: So if w of t was equal to nu of t, and this is increasing function. So the difference also of course, satisfies the so if at some moment they were the same, they were also the same for s less than t, why again, it's by Gronwald, because we have that this bounded by this. This follows from standard groundwall theorem. We already had another groinwall theorem for area. This is groundwall theorem no d, which says that if derivative is bounded by constant times, the value of the function, and then the function is well bounded. And so also by uniqueness, we have this chain relation, because both this and this satisfy the same differential equations. And if phi is not conformal, phi at the first is the same as phi at the two st.
00:46:52.124 - 00:47:53.524, Speaker A: Then by the same uniqueness we have that five z one tt and five z two tt are the same. So it implies that the one is actually equal to zero. So phi is confirmed. And now for s equal to zero, let's observe that phi of z zero, it is so just the same chain relation. So if you plug in ft equal to this, it's now a conformal map, and we get that f tau is subordinate to ft. That's exactly what we wanted. And now uniform continuity on compact also comes from the chain relation, because this of course is continuous.
00:47:53.524 - 00:48:56.944, Speaker A: So the same would be. And we can also check that this ft satisfies pD. So this is a fine point. You see, if you vary in phi zst, the very first parameter, it satisfies OD, but here the very second parameter, and suddenly it becomes PDE. And again, the derivation is exactly the same as what we had. So, derivative of f tau z is equal to zero. We so write it down carefully, use chain rule apply, and now take tau equal to t and we get this.
00:48:56.944 - 00:50:29.244, Speaker A: So what just happened? We proved Ljevnir Kofriv, and with this we finished proving the most general form of Levnor theory, that any decreasing continuously decreasing family of compacts family of domains, or continuously increasing family of compacts in the unit disk is generated by measurable nT family of functions from class P or equivalently by Hercules representation family of measures. Okay, so next time in two weeks, we'll talk about Leonard chains generated by slip domains. So there the situation would be a bit more complicated, but we'll get a strong result. Okay, so before I finish, let me remind everybody that next Monday, October 11 is thanksgiving here in Canada. So there will be no lecture. Instead, there will be a lecture on November 29. Again, I will post a note about this on Field's website and separately on course website, but just wanted to tell people who are here now.
00:50:29.244 - 00:50:32.504, Speaker A: Okay, so let me stop the recording.
