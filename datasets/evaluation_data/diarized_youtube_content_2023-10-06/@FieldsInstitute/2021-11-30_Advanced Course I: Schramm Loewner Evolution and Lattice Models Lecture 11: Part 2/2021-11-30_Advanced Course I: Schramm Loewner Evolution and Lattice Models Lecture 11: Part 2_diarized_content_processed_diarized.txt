00:00:01.920 - 00:01:01.374, Speaker A: Okay, so we are continuing, and now I will talk about this theorem that uniform continuity implies uniform tortosity and vice versa. So I already stated the beginning of the theorem that if you have a curve which admits uniformly continuous parameterization, well, there is no uniformity here yet. But if it admits parameterization with this bound, then you can bound the tortosity and vice versa. If tortoise is bounded, then you can find the parameterization is practically the same bound. But you need to modify a function psi. So psi tilde would be this. Write it more carefully.
00:01:01.374 - 00:01:56.534, Speaker A: This would be psi of delta over two over two over logarithm, base two of over delta squared. So just logarithmic factor. Eventually, we'll talk about Psi being something like delta to some power. So, and so, this theorem essentially shows that condition. So when this psi is something like delta to the alpha is equivalent to the fact that we have also bound tortuosity. Okay, so let's prove it. And let's start with proving that carcinogen implies tortoise.
00:01:56.534 - 00:02:51.386, Speaker A: So what we do, we just, for this, we just cut the interior into one over psi over delta equal part. Then what do we know? That for any t one, t two in the same part, you have psi of gamma of t one minus gamma of t two is less than t one minus t two when. So this is of course bounded by psi of delta. So, sorry. So which means that diameter of gamma of tj to j plus one is bounded by delta, because psi is strictly increasing function. That's all. Okay, not very interesting.
00:02:51.386 - 00:03:32.254, Speaker A: So again, we just cut in small parts, and since they are all equal, diameter of each of them is at most psi of delta. So, distance between any two points on the interval is at most psi of delta. But that was by this. So diameter of this part is less or equal than delta. And we get this minimum to be at most this. So we did it in the roughest possible manner, as I estimate. Well, as you see, that is an extra function that is slightly, but just slightly more interesting.
00:03:32.254 - 00:04:05.742, Speaker A: So we need to construct the right parameterization, right? So that's the thing. So in the previous part, we started with correct parameterization. So it was easy to estimate tortoise. Opposite is again denote tortoise. How do we construct right parameterization? So, for a curve segment, we define new time time to travel. So we start with curve we know bound on tortoise. Let's define time to travel.
00:04:05.742 - 00:05:06.816, Speaker A: And this is the following construction. You look at the num as at a of gamma up to level s, and you do it at the distance two to the minus n. You sum it up over all n with this extra coefficient. You see, this stays bounded. So you need to add something to make it convergent. And this is, one over n squared is just fine. And then you say, okay, this would be the time to travel to segment s.
00:05:06.816 - 00:05:49.304, Speaker A: And again, we want the parameterization to be up to zero one. So you normalize by what would happen after you do the whole curve. So you do the tortoise here at the level two to the minus n, but of the whole curve. So here it was part of the curve, here's the whole curve. So this is the natural parameterization. This is the tortuosity friendly parameterization, if you want. So now let's see why it is strictly increasing.
00:05:49.304 - 00:07:37.014, Speaker A: Of course, you only need to look at the top and then notice that for large n, if s two is bigger than n one, then carefully tortoises up to s one. Trick less than tertosity up to s two, because there is a little extra segment which we add when we go from s one to s two. So when n is really, really large, we can squeeze a really small extra segment of diameter two to the minus n on this extra part and we would have to do it. So again, we have strictly reasoned, and now, well, that's exactly this comment. And now observe again this, if two to the minus n is less than gamma s one minus gamma s two, then this is at least one greater than this. Right? Because you will need to add this extra segment, at least one to cover travel from s one to s two. Okay, and now let us look at the inequalities t of s two minus t of s one.
00:07:37.014 - 00:08:35.584, Speaker A: This is bigger, equal than one half sum over all two minus ends of this, well, divided by some normalizing factor. But who cares? So we just, well, ah, okay. Actually I incorporated the normalizing factor here. So this is not bigger than two, because again, this is bounded by one. This is one over n plus one squared. So yeah, so normalizing factor, one half sum of psi of two to the minus n and normalize it by one over n squared. Okay? And now let's remember that we can be very, very generous here.
00:08:35.584 - 00:09:21.428, Speaker A: We can simply replace all of these guys. Well, sorry. We can just look at the first of these guys. So we just look at the very first guy where this is bigger than we get this, and we get this n plus one to the minus two two. That would be this guy. And then here it would be psi of gamma is one minus gamma s two over two. And this is exactly psych, that's why it takes, it gets its wings.
00:09:21.428 - 00:10:17.264, Speaker A: So t of s one minus t of s two minus t of s one. Again, it's just bounded below by the sum which we replaced by the first term and the sum which is exactly psi tilde of gamma of s one minus gamma two. First, well, distance between s one and s two gamma of s one gamma of s two, and we are done. Okay, so now let's see what we can do in terms of alpha. Helder, that's something that I already mentioned. This would be our main thing. Let's look at the rate of growth of this tortuosity when delta decreases.
00:10:17.264 - 00:10:57.014, Speaker A: So you can define it as smallest tau such that delta tau m of gamma delta tends to zero. Or equivalently, this is just limb soap of logarithm of the tortoise divided by absolute value of log delta. So that would be tortuosity rate of our curve. And there is also Helder rate. So this is supreme of alpha size that gamma admits an alpha Heralder parameterization. So gamma of t one minus gamma of t two is t one minus t two to the power alpha that. So just let me rewrite it in terms of the theorem.
00:10:57.014 - 00:12:24.784, Speaker A: This corresponds to t one minus t two equal to the constant two gamma of t one minus gamma of t two to the power one over twelve. So this is the condition of the theorem for this function delta to the power one over alpha. And then of course the claims that tau and one over alpha are the same again, because in one direction you don't lose anything from Hulder to tortosity, that's the same thing. In the other direction, well, you lose something. But this is a logarithmic factor, who cares? So it doesn't affect the rate of growth. So one remark here, you would not get exactly one over tau here because you do lose logarithmic terms like in brownian motion. So this is actually very tempting, but you still get, well, all alphas which are all alpha holder for all alpha less than one over time.
00:12:24.784 - 00:13:18.064, Speaker A: Okay, so that's the framework. And now let's try to make it slightly more manageable. And remember, we wanted to have titans. So far we discussed some tortoises, but what about titans? Okay, so let us look at an analysis a of z rr. So this is analyst inner radiuses, little r out radius is capital r. And I want to state this Eisenman Burchard condition for family of random curves. Gamma beta.
00:13:18.064 - 00:13:56.460, Speaker A: Write it. Nice. So the Eisenmann Bercher condition is the following. This event a of z of r is traveled by K. Traverse, sorry, by k, separate segments of gamma delta. So this is, this picture represents the crossing, six separate crossings. Let's count them.
00:13:56.460 - 00:14:41.584, Speaker A: 123456. This little incursions don't count. We want complete crossings. So this is called k arm event. So probability of this event should be bounded by r over r. So the ratio to the power lambda k for some kk, well, I shouldn't write less than otherwise, that's too interesting. So for some kk, less than infinity.
00:14:41.584 - 00:15:46.324, Speaker A: And what is very important, that lambda k should tend to infinity. So probability of this having more and more crossings should just disappear. Well, not quite disappear, but just ten to infinity. So probability of karma went for any anolus within a radius controlled by beta should be small polynomials. And then here comes a b condition. So suppose that you have a family of curves, gamma beta, so it's indexed by beta and they all satisfy Kk, this ab condition with the same KK lambda k. But beta of course changes this time.
00:15:46.324 - 00:16:42.484, Speaker A: This is very important because remember, our curves would eventually come from lattice models. So you cannot say anything about the levels which are smaller than size of the lattice or even size of the lattice to some power. Because, you know, maybe geometry of the lights would force you to always cross certain annually, multiple times, like, I don't know, for hexagonal lights, you would always, always cross the anole twice. Nothing you can do about it, just geometry of the lights. So that's why we have this beta here. And you will see why we would have lambda k go into infinity. So suppose that you have the family of the curves which satisfy this condition.
00:16:42.484 - 00:17:44.764, Speaker A: Then you can parameterize all the curves in gamma beta. So again, gamma beta are random curves which satisfy this condition. And then you want to be able to say k. You can parameterize them such that they would essentially be held with this exciting exponent, two minus lambda of one plus epsilon. They are two dimensional. In d dimensions it's slightly different. And then it would be a random constant depending on this epsilon and depending on beta, of course.
00:17:44.764 - 00:18:28.166, Speaker A: And then here is this factor diameter. Okay, so the shoulder. So these curves are all simultaneously held. More than that, you simultaneously parameterize them. And that's what we are fighting for. There exists the limit of the scarves for some subsequence going to zero. So some subsequence would converge in our metric in the weak topology.
00:18:28.166 - 00:19:13.494, Speaker A: So this again, remember this measure. So this measure would converge here. Actually, as we will see, the convergence is even slightly smaller, stronger. That is a coupling. You can put them at the same probability space such that this curves would really converge here to the curves here in our metric. So this is stronger, technically speaking, than we convergence. Okay, so that's the theorem.
00:19:13.494 - 00:20:04.196, Speaker A: So if you have this rate of decay of karma went uniform. So you will need to produce estimates which do not depend on the. But if you're able to do it by some miracle, or maybe not so such a miracle. Now, there are methods for establishing this, but if you can do it, then you know tightness, and you know that actually your limit curve will be better. Okay, there is no tortoise. Tortoise actually will appear in the proof. Okay, so let me start with this definition.
00:20:04.196 - 00:22:01.254, Speaker A: So, we say that a curve gamma has not necessarily random curve, just a curve. An instance of curve has epsilon r naught, k tempered crossing property, if gamma does not cross any animals of this sort when r is small enough. So here you see, this is opposite to what we had before, and so it doesn't cross it for more than k times for any animals with inner size r to the one plus epsilon outer size r. Okay, again, the next lemma tells us that tempered crossing property, which would hold with high probability given ab condition, but so, tempered cross cross sync property implies, well, at least for bounded curves. For Carson bounded domain, it implies this bound on tortoise for all delta which are less or equal than r naught. So, if your curve is not allowed to cross an anomalous multiple times, then you have a bound on tortosity. Namely, you need no more than some absolute constant times.
00:22:01.254 - 00:22:33.574, Speaker A: Obviously, this k number of crossings times the area. And then comes this thing. So, delta to the minus two, one plus epsilon. Thanks. So this should be true. Okay, now let me explain to you why this is kind of, sort of obvious. So what does it mean that the curve has large surturity for this delta that essentially it travels back and forth within this little ball.
00:22:33.574 - 00:23:46.844, Speaker A: How can it do it? So the claim is that it will need to have a lot of tortoises. It will need to cross lots of anoles like this. So it has to cross at least one anolus at least k timesh, but it cannot. Okay, so let me now prove it. So what we do, we cover, we cover gamma by this partition. So we take tj, would be the first time when gamma of t is less or is at least distance delta from tj minus one. Okay, so this is a greedy way to cover it.
00:23:46.844 - 00:24:08.644, Speaker A: So definitely this m of gamma delta is at most this n that we get from this greedy partition. So greedy. So just a word of caution. This is very tempting mistake to make. That's a greedy partition. So, you know, you just do the obvious thing. It's not always optimal.
00:24:08.644 - 00:25:06.254, Speaker A: Sometimes, you know, you can keep going. Maybe you, your curve would get far away, but then it would get close again. So maybe you can cover much more of the curve by something. But here I want an upper bound, remember? So I want to produce a partition, and greedy partition is enough. Okay, now, I can always cover gamma by this number of balls of diameter, delta to the one plus epsilon. Well, why the area considerations? Right, there are the areas about r squared. The area of each of these ball is delta to the minus two, one plus epsilon.
00:25:06.254 - 00:25:44.724, Speaker A: So that's how many value up to constant, of course, because the covering is inefficient. But up to constant, that's the maximum number you need to cover gamma. Even if gamma is trying to be, you know, space filling, it doesn't matter. You still can have this number of balls. And let's look at one of these disks. Then. I claim that it contains at most k points, this gamma of tj.
00:25:44.724 - 00:26:55.134, Speaker A: Why? Because otherwise gamma will have to cross this ball of this analyst centered of the not in radius delta to the one plus epsilon out radius delta k times. Because, you know, for each of the segment, you go from outside to the outside and then from inside to outside. So you found more than k points, you made more than k crossing. That was impossible. Well, more than k points, more equal than k crossing, but k crossings were impossible. Okay, so, so what do we get that m is bounded by m is bounded by r squared, delta to the minus two to the one plus epsilon times k, because each of them, so this is the number of balls. This is how many points at most, how many points are in each of them.
00:26:55.134 - 00:27:47.984, Speaker A: And this is uniform constant, because it was all dependent on just how many balls of size, diameter you need to cover the whole disk of radius r. And of course, this is all which is required. So we are done with this exciting clamor. So now the name of the game is to prove that this tempered property holds with high probability. So, let us do the first part. And for this, notice that by exciting theorem, we are not proving anything about Hodler constant. That's difficult.
00:27:47.984 - 00:28:38.514, Speaker A: That requires us to look for certain parameterization. We don't care. All we do, we want to prove this tortuosity bound, because then we can apply a lemma about relation between tortoise and continuity and see that by maybe giving up a little bit. On this epsilon, we get the same bound on hulder constant. So remember this fine point. When you know bound on tortosity, it implies bound on alpha holder for alpha less than this one over optimal tortoises bound. But that's the bound that we are requiring.
00:28:38.514 - 00:29:38.694, Speaker A: Okay, so let us define this random radius. So this random radius would be the infimum, the smallest annulus, which is traversed by at least k segments of gamma, beta and k separate segments. So there is a k arm event which happened on this at some z. And now we take the smallest r. And here, if this didn't happen, that's what we wanted. Remember, we wanted to say that with high probability there are no such things. So in freemium of empty set for us would be one.
00:29:38.694 - 00:30:39.134, Speaker A: Okay, and then we have this exciting claim. Suppose that we have this. So suppose that at some moment epsilon lambda k just exceeded two. Then we have this probability that this radius is less or equal than u actually decays in a controlled fashion. There is some uniform c, which depends only on epsilon. Okay? Such that probability that this radius is small is u to some power. Okay, so the key word here is that this is bigger than two.
00:30:39.134 - 00:31:42.698, Speaker A: So the moment lambda k is large enough, k crossings essentially happen very, very rarely. Okay, so let's prove it. So indeed, the claim would allow us to, as I say, say that eventually these crossings don't happen. So we'll use something like let's do it later. So, assumes exists k crossing. So some annulus for some r, some annuals like this crossed k times. Then the claim is the following, that you crossed it.
00:31:42.698 - 00:32:48.444, Speaker A: Well, of course there are uncountable many, the uncountable many hours. But then what happens is you can always find a point on this slightest. So on square lattice, what you do. So, let me try to illustrate what's happening here. So you look at the square lattice here, rescaled up to the factor to minus one plus epsilon, and you know that your curve crossed some annulus centered at this point. Then I claim that it also. So you look at the point from the lattice inside.
00:32:48.444 - 00:33:38.834, Speaker A: Then this crossed some annulus centered at this point. So that's all I'm claiming. And the reason why I want to do this is I want to say if this crossing happened for some annuals, it also happened for some annuals with fixed radius two to the minus n, and for some r two to them essentially, which is two to the minus n. And more specifically, there was a crossing of this to this. So here we are very generous in assigning. Okay, so here, actually, this is wrong. This is bigger.
00:33:38.834 - 00:34:54.704, Speaker A: So the inner radius should be bigger than r, the outer radius should be smaller, and we are close to the point. So the crossing did happen. So every crossing of this big red anolus led to the crossing of smaller green arrows. Okay, so now what do we know? So, probability that there exists crossing on some fixed scale r between two to the minus n minus one, two to the minus n for this r. Okay, this is bounded by the probability of having this crossing for one of the guys on the slices. There are this many guys on the slices. Okay, so now, yes, so Zara, two to them, two to the two, and one plus epsilon guys on the slices.
00:34:54.704 - 00:36:16.186, Speaker A: Probability of each of this crossing is bounded by ratio of this to this. And now you simply look at it, and since you have this condition, epsilon lambda k minus two, rather bigger than zero, this would be some constant which depends on this kk. And all this multiplied by what? Two to the minus n, one plus epsilon minus epsilon lambda kick, or rather, sorry, it's not violence. It's actually, be careful here. Two plus two, epsilon minus. Okay, sorry. Yeah, so, yes, this, let me be careful.
00:36:16.186 - 00:37:09.464, Speaker A: So this is minus minus. And so this actually would cancel with this. So, yeah, so this is plus epsilon lambda k minus two epsilon. And if we now sum this up overall n such that two to the minus n minus one is less equal than u, we get precisely our bound, because, well, this would sum up to exactly, well, not exactly. It would sum up to two to the minus first n instead of, uh, to epsilon lambda k minus two. And that's exactly what we would have here. That's exactly what we have at the claim.
00:37:09.464 - 00:38:00.054, Speaker A: Okay, so now, very important point here. We really didn't need lambda k to go to infinity here just for fixed epsilon. If we don't care about optimal, all the stuff holder and one sum holder want lightness, all we require is that eventually epsilon lambda k would be bigger than two. More than that, we essentially can take epsilon arbitrary close to one. So just a side remark, that condition lambda k is bigger than two is sufficient for titans. It's not sufficient for the estimates for headers that we would require. But if you manage to find the k cross inside such that the probability of this k crossing decays like a power higher than two, that's it.
00:38:00.054 - 00:39:16.024, Speaker A: You are golden, you are done, and you will have this uniform temperature. Okay, so, but now let us use the claim. Now apply the claim. So let's find k such as it in the claim. Then you know that if you have temperate crossing, then you have this estimate. So probability that you have this estimate is, well, sorry. Probability that you don't have this estimate is bounded by this bound, some uniform constant times delta to epsilon lambda of k minus two.
00:39:16.024 - 00:40:50.654, Speaker A: Okay, so now there is also this pesky part of diameter, but we can use lambda fun to estimate its diameter. And then we get this estimate that this probability, which decays with power law, we would have this bound well on tortosity. And now, well, we notice that this constant random. So now we just let this u here go to zero in the lemma, and the probability would go to zero. Of course, the bounds here would be ugly and uglier, but which would lead to bigger c here. But again, that would just mean that you would have larger, larger random constant. So this is enough.
00:40:50.654 - 00:41:21.726, Speaker A: Okay, so we have uniform boundaries. Well, uniform random bound on tortoises. So you have uniform random bound on Holder. Now, what about tightness? Holder is great. Of course this is great that we can uniformly holder parameterize everything. Seems nice. But what about titans? Well, that just follows from Marcella's calling.
00:41:21.726 - 00:42:02.854, Speaker A: Now, you simultaneously parameterize them, and you have fixed helder bound. And so you can use Herzla scholar. The problem is that we don't have fixed bound, so we have fixed exponent, but you don't have fixed bound. Remember that here, this bound is random. And I just spent painful amount of time explaining to you that it cannot be non random, but has to actually grow. For some curves. It would be large.
00:42:02.854 - 00:42:46.048, Speaker A: It's finite for any instance, or almost any instance, but it can be quite large. But not to worry. So, the standard probabilistic trick is the following. We know that for any delta we can find, like c, the size of the probability that this would happen, that we would have this bound, it's bigger than one minus delta, because the bound is finite. It's random, but it's finite. So we can select sites with bigger and bigger probabilities the way it is uniformly bounded. And this implies tightness.
00:42:46.048 - 00:43:35.408, Speaker A: So probability that. So, remember prokhorov probability that our curve is in this compact subset with uniform holder bound is bigger than delta. So for every delta you can find, that's it. So we are done with titles. So, Eisenman Burchard condition says that if you have lambda k tends to tending to infinity. Yes, if you have Eisenmann Burschel condition, lambda k tends to infinity, then. Okay, so where is it? Here? Yes.
00:43:35.408 - 00:44:22.692, Speaker A: So if you have lambda k tends to infinity. Or let me add that the exists k such that lambda k bigger than two. Then, as we just proved, we have tightness. So it seems that we are done. Not quite as of course, as I explained, the limiting curves don't need to be. So remember how we want our proof to work? We want to say, okay, we had nice family, we selected subsequential limit. Subsequential limit lives on curves.
00:44:22.692 - 00:44:47.302, Speaker A: And now we want to do Leonard parameterization. We cannot live nor parameterize any curve. We cannot live nor parameterize curves like this, occurs like this, as I explained. So here comes next framework. And there I apologize, I won't be as careful as I was here. There I will just state the results without proving them. They're more complicated.
00:44:47.302 - 00:45:56.100, Speaker A: But in the same vein actually, and this is new framework, which is due to int campaign and stats Smirnov. Okay, so here comes a very geometric definition. So what the framework says is we want to try to avoid situations like this. So what does it mean that we have situation like this or situation like this, that essentially, instead of our curve, instead of going where it's supposed to go, remember it goes from a to b. It for some reason decided to make this deterrent site, or maybe decided to stick to what it already traveled. That would be wrong if it does it. And they discovered this concept, or introduced this concept of unforced crossing.
00:45:56.100 - 00:47:02.644, Speaker A: So let me start explaining what it is. So suppose that omega is a simply connected domain, and gamma is usually the random curve in our standard setup, from one boundary prime end to the next boundary prime. And as usual, that would be the analog t is the stopping time for this random curve. And omega T is connected component of b in omega without the beginning of the curve. So our curves are parameterized. Now, but again, remember that by Eisenman Barchart we can always parameterize all of them simultaneously. Nicely, if they satisfy this Eisenmann Barchart condition, lambda k tends to infinity.
00:47:02.644 - 00:48:07.184, Speaker A: So here, one of the first things that they would prove is that the air condition implies is in one version, but then their condition is stronger and it would imply that the limiting curves are actually Levner curves. Okay, so here comes a very important definition. So what is avoidable? Subset of this animals at time t. So if the inner disk didn't intersect with omega. So if the inner disk of the anolus strictly light here, then nothing is avoidable. You are allowed to cross it any way you want. Okay, so if you have an animal somewhere here on this picture.
00:48:07.184 - 00:49:15.476, Speaker A: So for this analyst, nothing is available, you are absolutely welcome to cross this. It's okay, but now, if you are, on the other hand, in a disk, intersect the boundary, oh, things become more interesting. This avoidable set are all the guys such that the connected component of z in this domain does not disconnect gamma of t from b in omega of t. So this is a handful. So let's at least start looking at it. So look, for example here, I pick any point here. What is the connected component of z is in omega, t intersect with a.
00:49:15.476 - 00:49:52.204, Speaker A: This is this green, green thing, the whole green thing. And it does not disconnect the tip from b. The curve can absolutely travel to b without this crossing. It doesn't need to make this crossing. You would say, okay, here it also didn't need to make the crossing. But again, we only want to look at such guys. We want to prohibit crossings near the boundary or near what is already traveled.
00:49:52.204 - 00:50:26.166, Speaker A: So this, for us is avoidable crossing. And that we, let me actually show you another example of absolutely avoidable crossing. So here. So if you look at this thing, it has two components, this and this. Both of them are avoidable. None of them disconnects gamma of t from b. Okay, I will give more examples after a short break.
00:50:26.166 - 00:50:27.934, Speaker A: So see you all at no time.
