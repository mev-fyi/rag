00:00:00.760 - 00:00:55.856, Speaker A: Okay. Thank you for the invitation. I want to talk today about the action of a group on intersection numbers and as the title on the space of cars. And these two things are going to be related. So first I'm going to give a result as motivation, which is a theorem by sharp and Sullivan that says the following. If you have a map, see one map between an open set in rn to rn and this map is going to fix the origin in particular. But if you consider a hypothesis that fixed point.
00:00:55.856 - 00:01:44.276, Speaker A: Sorry. That the origin is an isolated fixed point for every positive iterate of f and isolated fixed point of every iterate, then at that point you can calculate the fixed point index of all these iterates at zero. Okay, I'm going to. You have a map that has an isolated fixed point at the origin. Then the index is. You can consider this. Sorry.
00:01:44.276 - 00:02:35.334, Speaker A: Again, this expression over here, this is defined, in particular, is defined as. As a map of the sphere. Okay, let's go. Put it like that. Is a map from the sphere of radius epsilon for, from which center at zero and radius epsilon for epsilon sufficiently small to the sphere of center zero and radius one. And by normalizing this epsilon, you have a map between two spheres. You can calculate the degree this.
00:02:35.334 - 00:02:53.754, Speaker A: Sorry. This numerator does not vanish. This epsilon is not enough. Is small enough, sorry. Since the degree varies well, and it's an invariant upto isotopy. This is well defined. If epsilon is small enough.
00:02:53.754 - 00:04:21.724, Speaker A: Okay, so the theorem says that under such conditions, the sequence of fixed point indexes of all the iterates at zero, it's a bounded sequence and you can. Ah, sorry. It's rounded sequence. This in particular can be used, for instance, to show that if you have a map defined in a compact manifold whose leptured numbers of data rates are unbounded, then it necessarily has infinitely many periodic points. For instance, it's a very nice theorem with very little hypothesis that's c one. And something that is interesting is that you can see that theorem as theorem about the action of a group, in this case a cyclic group, in some intersection numbers. So we are going to consider the diagonal in u times rn.
00:04:21.724 - 00:05:04.302, Speaker A: Okay. And we are going to consider a map in this case. We should give a different name. I guess it is a very simple map. Okay, you have xy. We are sending this, the first coordinate, x is sent to f and y is sent to y. And what happens is that this intersection number can be understood as the intersection number at zero.
00:05:04.302 - 00:06:02.370, Speaker A: Of the following two sets, one of them is going to be the diagonal and the other one is going to be the image by the h divide, the nth iterate of h of the diagonal, the origin of the diagonal, right. And so we have here the elements of a cyclic group. And indeed, what we are seeing is how this cyclic group acts on this intersection number. This is motivation to study this kind of problems. What we are going to consider, what we are going to consider in general are situations in which the degree of regularity is much bigger than c one. But we are going to consider more general classes of sets. And we are going to consider more general classes of groups.
00:06:02.370 - 00:06:40.770, Speaker A: We're not just going to be restricted to cyclic groups. We are going to consider locally femorphisms. It can be, for instance, c infinity femomorphisms defined in a neighborhood of the origin. In rn. That could be, that's one of the places where we can work. But at that point, in general, we consider the formal power series expansion at zero. And because of that we can work with the group of.
00:06:40.770 - 00:07:27.584, Speaker A: This is joints of b holomorphisms, indeed, not necessarily germs, because the power series could diverge. So more generally we need to work with this. This is just the notation for the formal completion of the group of germs of b holomorphisms. B holomorphisms defined in a neighborhood of the origin that fix the origin. So those are the spaces in which we are going to work like that. We are going to be working most of the time, almost all the time in the complex analytic category. Right.
00:07:27.584 - 00:09:14.824, Speaker A: So I want to define now which is the uniform intersection property for a group, a group, for instance, containing here or here or. It's very similar to work with these cases, because at the end we, we work in here. So we are going to, what's the definition? We say that a group has this uniform intersection property. If for any pair u and b of analytic sets, for any pair umb of analytics sets of complementary dimensions. So the sum of the dimensions is equal to m, then the action of the group in the intersection number is fine. It's a nice action. So what do I mean by that? We are going to consider, this is not, okay, the action, what do I mean by that? You can consider a function defined on the group.
00:09:14.824 - 00:10:17.544, Speaker A: This image is going to be denar rules union infinity, because the intersection can be infinity that sends every element to the intersection of the image by fn of u and b. Right. And what we are going to require to say that this property holds is that this maps takes finitely many values. It doesn't mean that it cannot take the infinity value, and it could be constant equal to infinity. In that case, we consider it takes one value, so it takes finitely many values. Okay, so this is the uniform intersection property. Essentially, the action of the group is going for any pair of analytic sets in which the intersection makes sense.
00:10:17.544 - 00:11:34.994, Speaker A: Here is the intersection, the intersection number of the origin. Maybe I should define it if you have two analytic sets that are defined by two ideals. Okay, the intersection number at the origin is going to be the dimension as a complex vector space of the rim of formal power series over the idea generated by u and b. Right? So it's a very algebraic definition. And this was studied by Arnold and others, motivated by this example over here, the Schub Sullivan theorem. And in 1991, okay, there's a theorem of Arnold 1991 that says that simply that cyclic groups satisfy the uniform intersection property, or everything that I'm talking about in this talk is local, right? It's everything. Yes.
00:11:34.994 - 00:12:27.300, Speaker A: We are working always in a neighborhood of a point, a fixed point. Ah, sure. N. So we have this theorem of Arnold that says that groups satisfy this property, let's call it Ui, for the sake of brevity. UI is uniform intersection. So it's used theorem of number theory called the scholar malar Lec theorem to prove this result. Then there were other, several years later, other people generalized this result.
00:12:27.300 - 00:14:03.176, Speaker A: In particular, Sigel and Jacobenko in 2014 that proved that finitely generated a billion groups are also ui. This is, the techniques are a little bit different, because here it's user resulting number theorem. Here it's used mostly netherianity of Sanrim. But in this way, we can extend this property that we can actually consider for every possible group. We can see first that it works for cyclic groups, and then extend it to finally generated a billion groups. There is a theorem in the, published in 2015 by Binghamini that says that if the group is a Lie group in some sense, that I'm not going to define in a natural sense, if G is a Lie group, then it's also ui. And even if, of course, it's not trivial to know whether or not a group of local DFMR physicians is going to be embedded in a le group.
00:14:03.176 - 00:15:25.694, Speaker A: This result is really interesting because it contains the other two. It can be proved that for finitely generated abelian groups, they always have a structure of the group. They can always be embedded in a, in a group, in an unreal way, in a finite dimensional e group. Okay? So once we get to this point, something that it is interesting is considered for a group of local diffomorphisms or formal diffuser morphisms, you can consider the Tsaritsky closure. I don't want to define this because, because this space over here is simply dimensional. So the natural way to define it is seeing that group as an inverse limit of linear groups that essentially the femorphisms restricted to every jet space. And then you consider the closure of the kj of g in every one of these linear groups, and you do the inverse limit of that.
00:15:25.694 - 00:15:56.114, Speaker A: It's a technical definition, but you can define a Tsaritski closure. This group is not going to be algebraic. It's going to be a pro algebraic. It's going to be a projective limit of algebraic groups. This is interesting, because this is a natural, but it should be a natural group to consider to apply this theorem. And indeed something that. Well, okay.
00:15:56.114 - 00:16:43.604, Speaker A: Of course, this construction is interesting. If the dimension of this Tsarisci closure is fine, since I didn't define what is the Sariski closure, I can try to give here a characterization of this result. Okay. What does it mean for a desirsky closure to be finite? It means that it exists. Okay. Such that the jets of order k of the elements of the group are going to determine the element, okay. So such that this map over here that sends the kjet to the k plus one jet is well defined.
00:16:43.604 - 00:17:23.624, Speaker A: Sorry, let's go here. K prime. For every k prime greater than k, this is well defined. In particular, it means that the two elements that have the same kj have all the jets equal, so they are the same. So this is what it is called also to be k finitely determined. The elements of the group are determined by its k jets. But besides that, of course we are going to ask for something more.
00:17:23.624 - 00:18:51.594, Speaker A: What do we ask? Sorry. No, no, it's for every case prime. Sorry. It's a. And what else? And what we're going to require is that the coefficients of any element, coefficients of the power of the Taylor power series expansion at the origin, the coefficients of f of degree less, no more higher than k, depend algebraically on the coefficients of degree less or equal than k. So, irregular functions on these coefficients, I'm going to write this on the coefficients of the j of the jet of order k. So, it's not just that this map exists, that this map exists is the same, that same, that the map that sends the k prime jets to the k jets is injected.
00:18:51.594 - 00:19:40.414, Speaker A: I wrote it this way because I think it's easier to express the second property. So we want more than finite determination. We want that the coefficients of higher degree have to be algebraic in the coefficients of some degree kick. Okay. And once you get to this case, it's easy, it's more or less easy to see the following result. This is a result of mine, that if the dimension of the Tsaritsky closure is finite, then you have that g satisfies this uniform intersection property. Sure.
00:19:40.414 - 00:20:51.574, Speaker A: It does not give a bigger class of group in which this property is true than this result, because of course, an algebraic group, this in particular implies that this group is isomorphic to a linear algebraic group. This is what being finite dimensional means. So if it's a linear algebraic group, is also a group. But it is interesting because in this way, we can focus on a very specific candidate to ble group that contains g, which is going to be the Tsaritsky closure. How do you prove this result? You defined the elements of the group such that, sorry, this intersection number of the origin of the image of u by f and b is greater or equal than k. It's okay. This defines an ideal on the, of the ring of polynomials inside of the variables.
00:20:51.574 - 00:22:11.576, Speaker A: It defines an ideal on the polynomial ring on the variables of. This notation is not very good, but what I mean is it's going to define an ideal in arena polynomials in the coefficients of degree less or equal than k. What is the problem in here? The problem, of course, is that when k increases, okay, you are using more and more variables, and, yeah, you end up considering ideals in different spaces. But if you have finite determination, sorry, you have finite dimension, at some point, the coefficients depend algebraically, are regular functions on the coefficients of degree less or equal than k. So all these ideas leaving the same space, and so you use netorianity, at some point they stabilize. And if they stabilize, what? It means that they stabilize as level k. It means that if this intersection is greater or equal than k, it is also greater or equal than k plus one, it is also greater or equal than k plus two, and so on and so forth.
00:22:11.576 - 00:23:02.694, Speaker A: So it's infinite. So it takes finitely many values. Okay, so this is the proof. And you can see here, this is a sketch of the proof, how this property of being a finite dimensional is interesting for this kind of problem. Okay, very good. Something that I wanted to say is that one of the advantages of working with groups with the Tsaritski closure is that you can define also a theory not just of finite dimensional groups. You can define the concept of a finite dimensional extension.
00:23:02.694 - 00:24:20.918, Speaker A: So, for instance, you could have something like this extension of groups at a tower of extensions. And it is possible to define when the extension between two consecutive ones is finite dimensional or not. And it's interesting because it behaves in a very similar way to the results that we saw at the beginning. Extensions that are finite dimensional are, for instance, finite extensions. That's expected. In that case, the dimension of the extension is zero, but for instance, finitely generated a billion extensions, those are finite dimensional. So if you have here that the quotient between an element of the previous one is always finitely generated in a billion, since clearly this has dimension zero, this is going to be finite dimensional two.
00:24:20.918 - 00:25:09.176, Speaker A: A tower of finite dimensional extensions gives you a finite dimensional group. And in that way it is possible to prove that polycyclic groups, polycyclic are finite dimensional, and in particular they are UI, they satisfy the uniform intersection property. Realistically means just that. You have here a subnormal series. Every element is normal in the next, and the quotient of two consecutive ones is cyclic. That's what it means, polycyclic. But there are classes of groups that are very well known and that there are polycyclic.
00:25:09.176 - 00:26:29.426, Speaker A: For instance, finitely generated important groups are polycyclic, are polistic. And this is interesting because in particular means that finally generated important groups satisfy the UI property, something that was not now. And in particular, for instance, also super solvable groups are polycyclic and solvable groups are not polycyclic. Super solvable is a, sorry, super solvable is a nice version of solvable. It's a solvable group in which every finite, in which every group is finally generated. So, but not every solvable group satisfies that property. Okay? So perfect, okay.
00:26:29.426 - 00:27:36.994, Speaker A: But what I wanted to talk today is how we can general, how we can try to obtain, I don't know, to determine the groups that satisfy this uniform intersection property. Because what we have so far is larger and larger classes of groups, but still here, because as I said, these groups and these groups are the same, such that they satisfy the uniform intersection property. But we don't know what is the optimal, what's the sharp condition for that. So we're going to work for a while in dimension two. The new results that I would like to present are in dimension higher than two. But I think that it is important too, to give here background on the problem. So in particular, in dimension two, whenever you consider one of these intersection numbers at the origin in dimension two, you have to suppose that u and b are curves, okay? Because if u is the ambient space, this is constant.
00:27:36.994 - 00:28:46.572, Speaker A: So this intersection number is constant if u is just the origin the same. So it's only interested when both of them, u and b, are cars. So from now on, when we talk about dimension two, we are considering here the intersection number of the image of a curve with another curve, right? And in dimension two, there is a topology that is very well adapted to this problem. You can give a topology in the space of curves, indeed, you can give a metric, okay, gamma and gamma prime are germs of cards of analytic charts at the origin of c two. And you can define this distance in the following way. You consider the multiplicity of gamma at the origin times the multiplicity of gamma prime at the origin, and you divide by the intersection number of gamma and gamma brain at the origin. This is a metric.
00:28:46.572 - 00:30:16.244, Speaker A: It defines a metric in the space of cars, and indeed is an ultrametric. So the space of cars has a topology that is first countable, obviously because it's symmetrical space, but it's not second countable. Okay, something that happens in here is that you can describe the topology also in a different way. You can define a fundamental neighborhood system for every car. And, okay, so for instance, what does it mean? What does it mean for a family of carves to convert to another car? I think that's interesting. To understand how this topology works, what it means is that for every k there exists, and there exists an index such that gamma, n and gamma share the first k infinite linear points for n greater or equal than n zero. So, such that gamma, n and gamma share.
00:30:16.244 - 00:30:54.634, Speaker A: It's first. Now I'm going to talk a little bit about this. First, it's, it's k first infinitely near points, or all n greater equals than n zero. So what does it mean to share the first infinite linear points? For instance, let us assume, just for simplicity, that the curves are smooth. This can be applied to, to the space of cars. But I think it's easier to understand what the curves are. The curves are smooth.
00:30:54.634 - 00:32:12.212, Speaker A: To share the first infinite linear point means that the smooth curves at the same tangent to share the two first infinite linear points means that the expansions agree to the second order. The three first infinite linear points are shared when they coincide till the third order with expansions of the curves, and so on and so forth. So, and this is interesting because this condition is exactly the same as the following, that the limit when n tends to infinity of the intersection number of gamma n and gamma is actually equal. In the case, assume that all these are smooth. For instance, when the curves are, or they are in the same orbits or something. Under those hypotheses, that condition is equivalent to this one, that the limit of the intersection number is infinite. So since we want that to find intersection, in order to find that something is known, it does not satisfy the uniform intersection property.
00:32:12.212 - 00:33:15.454, Speaker A: We are going to need intersections that are very big, but different than infinity. So we are going to need orbits of a sequence of curves in an orbit that converts to another curve. That's essentially what it has to happen. Okay. Everything okay? Take a look. Okay. Some property that every group that has this uniform intersection property satisfies is that it necessarily is finitely determined.
00:33:15.454 - 00:34:31.284, Speaker A: I defined that somewhere, but it means that every element is determined by its case. For sank, for sand, k, that is the same for all the elements. Okay. This is very, very simple, because if you have a group that is not finitely determined, then that means that there exists a sequence of elements in the group, such that the Kjet, these elements are different, they're different to the, they're not the same as the identity map. And the Kjet is the identity. And for a generic curve, this is going to imply that this intersection number over here is what is going to happen always for every curve, is that this intersection number tends to infinity. And for a generic curve, these elements over here are not equal to infinity from some moment on.
00:34:31.284 - 00:35:18.294, Speaker A: Because if this happens, the k first infinite linear points of every curve are fixed. So, yeah, the possibility of having the uniform intersection property, it doesn't happen. If the group is not finally determined. This is the easiest necessary condition that you can find to prove to have the uniform intersection property, you don't have that it's not satisfied. So, in particular, all the groups that we consider so far, finitely generated abelian groups, finite dimensional groups, all of them are finitely determined. That is.
00:35:25.534 - 00:35:28.742, Speaker B: Finally determine as a group or each element.
00:35:28.878 - 00:36:28.782, Speaker A: No, no, as a group, it means that when you, when you have this map over here, it means that for sankey, that map is injected, and for the minimum k for which this is injective, that's called, I don't know. We say that it's k, finitely determined. Sorry, that wasn't clear. So, okay, we, we saw that. Yeah. That finally determined groups are important. And so, yeah, this is the conditions that we saw at the beginning of the talk, are sufficient conditions for a group to be of having the uniform intersection property.
00:36:28.782 - 00:37:35.564, Speaker A: This is a necessary condition. Right. And. Sorry, I lost myself here. What happens is that if g does not satisfy the uniform intersection property, what it means is that there exists a sequence of elements in the group, such that these intersection numbers, there exist two cards, gamma and gamma prime, such that these numbers over here are not infinity, but they tend to infinity when n tends to infinity. This is the same as it is written over here, that in the topology that we just defined, the limit of the fn gammas converts to gamma prime. Okay.
00:37:35.564 - 00:38:44.684, Speaker A: Obviously, we are requiring that these curves are different than gamma prime. We want these numbers to be higher and higher, but different than infinity. So essentially, if the non uniform property is true, that means that we have a curve that is an accumulation point of the orbit of another curve. Right? We can suppose that all these points of these curves over here are different because they converge to gamma prime. Okay? And they are different than gamma prime. And in that way, since the images of gamma converts to gamma prime and the images of nn plus one also converts to gamma prime, we use the natural trick here, which is that when we compose fn with the inverse of f m plus one, the gamma converts to gamma prime. And this curve is different than gamma because these two curves over here are different.
00:38:44.684 - 00:39:05.854, Speaker A: Yeah. Up to consider subsequent here. We can, we can have that. So that means, sorry, here is gamma. So that means that the orbit of gamma is nondiscrete. Right. The orbit of gamma by the action of g is non discrete.
00:39:05.854 - 00:40:17.462, Speaker A: Obviously, if it's nondiscrete, the group is non ui, because you have this property with gamma equal gamma prime. So this is a condition that is equivalent to the group having the uniform intersection property for dimension two. Of course, in dimension two, what we, maybe what we saw is that a group has the uniform intersection property if and only if the action of the group in the space of curves is by discrete orbits. That's the, that's the result. So we can actually transform our study of whether or not a group satisfies the uniform intersection property into something slightly different. It can actually, okay. The theorem is that g is ui if and only if the orbits of curves by the action of g are discrete.
00:40:17.462 - 00:41:03.154, Speaker A: Every orbit has to be discrete. So we can check whether or not the orbit of a curve is discrete. And this allows to use techniques, for instance, the singularization techniques for the carbon, other stuff. Okay. I wanted to say a few things about the proof, but I think that, let's say something very, very quickly. So the point now is that we consider pairs in which the first element is a group of local bholomorphism. And, and the second element of the purl is a germ of curve.
00:41:03.154 - 00:42:14.324, Speaker A: And the question is whether the orbit of the curve is discrete or not, right? And if the orbit is discrete, we say that g is u I gamma. So it's exactly the same. That's saying that the orbit is discrete. So if you can prove that g is ui gamma for every gamma, then the group satisfies the uniform intersection property. That's what we are saying. And what I really did is, instead of proving directly when the characterization for uniform intersection property groups, I characterize for dimension to the groups for which the space of orbits satisfies this discreteness property. Okay, so what happens in the proof? The proof is the theorem is the following.
00:42:14.324 - 00:42:59.822, Speaker A: I'm going to write the theorem. Ah, sorry again. Thank you. Ah, sure, I can do that. The theorem is the following. G is Ui or has discrete orbits even only if g is finitely determined. Let's stress here that G is a group of local morphisms in dimension two.
00:42:59.822 - 00:44:02.386, Speaker A: This is our result for dimension two. In dimension higher than two is false. It's true that Ui implies finally determined, but the other way around is not true. So that's the theorem that we want to prove. And the, the idea of the proof is the following. If you have a g that is not ui gamma, so that the gamma that the g orbit of gamma is not discrete, what happens is that you can find an example. There exists a subgroup of g such that a subgroup j, or of g such that j is a billion and j does not satisfy u I gamma.
00:44:02.386 - 00:44:43.546, Speaker A: The orbit of gamma by j is not discrete. And so if there is a counter example to that theorem, there is a counter example for an abelian group. That's interesting. And what happens is that such counterexample, besides being abelian, has to be infinitely dimensional, because finite dimensional groups satisfy the uniform intersection property. So the dimension of j has to be infinite. And what happens is that because we are in dimension two, we get lucky. And there is a scarcity of groups like that.
00:44:43.546 - 00:45:26.114, Speaker A: Essentially, there is just one example. If you have an abelian group whose dimension is infinite, you can say that essentially, I'm not going to say what it means. Essentially what? Okay, thank you. Thank you. So we are here. Yeah. What happens is that J is a subgroup of the following group of different reasons, a very simple one, up to some transformation that are very natural.
00:45:26.114 - 00:46:04.332, Speaker A: It's almost an affine group. So it's an affine group in some sense. So, and the finally determined subgroups of this satisfy the uniform intersection property. So we just have to check an example that it satisfies that. So that control example does not exist. The proof was to prove that implication, to suppose that something is not ui. Then we can suppose that j is a billion.
00:46:04.332 - 00:46:41.858, Speaker A: We can suppose also that the dimension is infinite. Then you can suppose that you are in this case, and in this case the property holds. So that's it. Okay, I don't know if I have time to say something about dimension three. I can give an example in dimension three, this property, this theorem is not true. The one over there is not true that this property is finally determined. Indeed, it's more difficult to work with the uniform intersection property in higher dimension.
00:46:41.858 - 00:47:32.804, Speaker A: So instead of considering the Ui property, we consider the other, the property that is equivalent for dimension two. We are going to study whether the orbits are discrete. So the point is that four dimensions, three, you have a higher, of course, you have groups and curves such that the orbit of the curve is nondescript. And at least, I would like to give the main example. It's not the unique possibility, but it's the main example in which this thing happens. So consider a group of the following kind. Not here.
00:47:32.804 - 00:48:14.966, Speaker A: Consider a group. We can give every element, given a formal power series in each variable. In the first component we are going just to write x, the first variable, we are in c three. For the second one, we are going to consider y plus lambda, and c lambda n is a complex number. And here we are going to consider n a n of x. I'm going to explain, this is a power series. It can be a polynomial too.
00:48:14.966 - 00:48:45.026, Speaker A: It doesn't matter. And here we consider gamma Nc, lambda n and gamma N are generic. Gamma N has to be different than zero, but other than that, they are generic. I'm not going to explain how to obtain them. It's easy. So you consider generic elements, and that's it. And what happens when you have a group generated by these elements? Okay, and besides that, you ask that the multiplicity of a n tends to infinity.
00:48:45.026 - 00:49:46.234, Speaker A: That's the other thing that happens. So consider an element here, fn fn, applied to the x axis. Since c is zero, this vanish, this vanishes two, and it gets to be x an of x zero, right? But since the multiplicity goes to infinity, the order of contact between the x axis and this image goes up and up, and it tends to infinity. So it means in particular that the orbit of the x axis is not discrete. And the group, if lambda n and gamma n are well chosen, is finally determined. Indeed, it's one, finally determined. Every element is determined by its first yet.
00:49:46.234 - 00:50:27.204, Speaker A: Okay, so g is one finally determined. And what happens over here. Okay, so I'm going to end with that. What happens over here is that all the orbit of the curve is contained in c equals zero. So it means that the Tsariski closure of the orbit of the curve is containing a proper analytic subset. And this makes the fact that this is one finally determined. It's rendered meaningless because if you restrict to c equals zero, this is not any more finally determined.
00:50:27.204 - 00:50:58.734, Speaker A: So there is the main problem for this issue, for this property, the discreteness of orbits to hold in higher dimension, even for finitely determined groups, is that you can have orbits of curves that are intranscendent whose orbit is contained in a proper analytic subset. There is another possibility, but this is by far the most, the most important case. Thank you very much.
00:51:18.694 - 00:51:30.194, Speaker B: Yes, I was wondering if this result can be used to prove whether or not, the question is whether it is true or not that you have.
00:51:32.374 - 00:51:32.710, Speaker A: The.
00:51:32.742 - 00:52:13.706, Speaker B: Thermal fields in c two about this having infinitely many periodic points going to the fixed point, that you must have curve of fixed point for some iterator. I mean, you must have infinitely periodic points of a fixed degree of the fixed period going or accumulating to the next point.
00:52:13.770 - 00:52:54.238, Speaker A: I'm not sure. The issue is that the proof here is very algebraic indeed. The most important ingredient is to give an algebraic structure to the group of different physics. So you end up working much more with formal power series and projective limits of linear algebraic groups than with dynamics. Dynamics, sure, everything is related, but it didn't enter very much in the proof today. So yeah, that would be, it would be interesting to relate these properties with dynamics. They are related somehow.
00:52:54.238 - 00:53:21.484, Speaker A: For instance, it's none that you can use these techniques to prove that if the group is not solvable, then you have nondiscrete orbits of points in a neighborhood of the origin. So there is a bridge between these properties and dynamics. But in regard to the particular problem that you talked about, I'm not sure. Maybe, maybe, but I don't know. Now.
00:53:34.534 - 00:53:44.110, Speaker B: The crucial step, as far as I understand, in dimension two, is that you know all those finitely determined groups in dimension two.
00:53:44.222 - 00:53:44.934, Speaker A: Exactly, yes.
00:53:44.974 - 00:53:48.134, Speaker B: So this is the classification of them.
00:53:48.174 - 00:54:23.530, Speaker A: There are some groups of more or less. I mean, that's the reason I said essentially what you can say is the following. All the groups that are like that are of the following kind. It's not very difficult. No, but you, you have, you have to use some of the, to use some part of the algebraic theory, because you have to associate to a group, it's lie algebra, something that it's not. Okay, it's. But it can be done.
00:54:23.530 - 00:55:01.886, Speaker A: It's not, it's not that difficult. And then you work with the Lie algebra. And what happens is that the Lie algebra of that group consists of, consists of elements of this kind. There is a fixed x, which is a vector field, and f is the first integral of the vector phi. So we have something like this. I mentioned that two in this case, and f is a quotient of formal power series. Okay.
00:55:01.886 - 00:55:31.298, Speaker A: It's in the field of fractions. And to prove this is not, it's not very difficult. It's more or less, this idea is not difficult at all. It's algebraic, but it's quite simple. It's this kind of techniques in which you use algebraic properties of the group of B holomorphisms to deduce other properties. For instance, dynamical properties has been used since a long time ago. For instance, it was.
00:55:31.298 - 00:56:10.190, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. It was used at some point by Etienne G's to prove that if you have a group of analytic lithiumorphisms of the sphere. Okay, that is Neil pouring, I think. Sorry. Then you have that this group is metabilion. So if. Yeah, so, and what's the proof of this? The proof of this is there are you some very nice techniques to prove that there is a fixed point.
00:56:10.190 - 00:56:25.734, Speaker A: And so you get to the theory of local b holomorphisms in dimension two, because you complexify this, and the proofs there are very simple. The proof that you are in this situation is really simple.
