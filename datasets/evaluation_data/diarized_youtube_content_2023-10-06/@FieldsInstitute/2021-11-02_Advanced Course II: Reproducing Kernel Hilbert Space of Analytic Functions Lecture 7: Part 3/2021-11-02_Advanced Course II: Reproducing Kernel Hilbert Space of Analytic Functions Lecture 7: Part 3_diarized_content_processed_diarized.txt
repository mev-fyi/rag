00:00:02.800 - 00:01:03.870, Speaker A: Okay, now we are preparing for a very important theorem, probably the most important one in this chapter, which meant after the interpolation, which allows us to see when a function given is in this space. For this, we need a proposition. Let me remind you something. If you have a vector x in Cn, say x one to Xn and consider another one to yn, both of them in Cn. Pay attention to y x and x Y star. Both are meaningful. And sometimes I need the first one, sometimes the second one.
00:01:03.870 - 00:02:00.824, Speaker A: The first one, y is a number because you do it in this order. And so it's just sum I from one up to n x I yi bar. It's the inner product. It's another way to, to write the inner product. In Cn, it's a matrix, one by one matrix, which is the result, is the same as the inner product. However, the second one, x times y star is like this. X one up to x n, and then y star up to yn is an n by n matrix.
00:02:00.824 - 00:03:09.644, Speaker A: The, the first element is x y one, start x one x one y two star, and so on. And we continue up to x n y n star. So it's an n by n matrix. Keep this in mind. And now our theorem answers this question, or this criteria. A matrix p is given and we are wondering about range of p if x is in Cn when x belongs to the range of pie. I mean, up to here.
00:03:09.644 - 00:04:08.218, Speaker A: What is your strategy if you're faced with this question? Well, we tell ourselves p is a matrix. Range of p is the subspace created by the columns. Good. So before the columns, and try to understand which space they create and then try to see if the given x is in that linear combination. Straightforward pass gives the answer final and it's good. Now I give you another one which answers two questions. Indeed, one of them is when x is in the range of p and another one is related to the norm of a function, even though it is not clear in this way that I write.
00:04:08.218 - 00:04:55.472, Speaker A: But we will see later on. It's the norm of a function. Here is a proposition. Let p bigger than or equal to zero be an n by n matrix and let x x one up to x n in c n. If. Here is the way if and indeed it's if and only if. But that's the way we use it.
00:04:55.472 - 00:05:53.244, Speaker A: If x x star. And you see by my comment about x, x star is an n by n matrix is less than or equal to Cp. For some c bigger than or equal to zero. We know what it means, we know what it means a is less than or equal to b means that the difference is positive. Then x is in range of p. This is what we want that answers the question. Moreover, there is one more thing.
00:05:53.244 - 00:07:04.224, Speaker A: If x is equal to r times y means being in the range. Then the inner product of x and y in Cn is positive, bigger than or equal to zero, and also is controlled by c. The constant c that we have, we have above these constants. The importance of this is not clear now, but we will see why this is important and where we will use it for the time being. Just look at it as the answer to the question. When x is in the range of p x x star, you have a criteria you make. This matrix should be less than or equal to a multiple, a positive multiple of p.
00:07:04.224 - 00:08:07.304, Speaker A: That's another occasion in the book. That proof contains an inequality which is important. It can be even mentioned as a lemo. But if we know this inequality immediately, we obtain whatever we want. Proof. Well, recall that a is less than or equal to b. This means that b minus a is positive, which is the same thing as a z, and z is less than or equal to bz inner product z for any z in cn.
00:08:07.304 - 00:09:43.804, Speaker A: That's the meaning of a being less than or equal to b. Therefore, here we want to show that x star is less than or equal to Cp. Therefore, x x star is less than or equal to Cp if and only if what we have above xx star as a matrix act on z. Inner product on z is less than or equal to Cpz for all z in cub. And now it is easy to calculate the right side here, right side. Look, z is the vector z one up to zn. And if x is the vector x one up to x n, x star is the n by n matrix, whose ij element is xi or x I xj bar.
00:09:43.804 - 00:11:51.944, Speaker A: And therefore we can, we can calculate, we can calculate x x star z. That's, I mean, easy to do. I mean it's the, what is the ice component? Here is to multiply the ice row of x x star by the vectors a, its sum xixj bar z j from one up to n, and the inner product of this with z again. So if you do this, x z and z is the sum z I part true. It's just the ice component of the first vector times the conjugate of the ice component of the second vector. And then you solve, and now you see that you can separate I from j and this becomes sum I from one up to nxizi bar times sum j from one up to n x j bar z j, which is equal to sum I from one up to nxizi bar squared. And this is nothing but the inner product of x and z squared.
00:11:51.944 - 00:13:59.054, Speaker A: So in short, if I compare this with what I have here, I conclude that x star xx star less than or equal to cp if and only if the inner product of x and z squared is less than or equal to c p z. That's the key. Which gives us the answer, because again, we use the fact that when p is positive, then at least p is equal to p star. So we can write cn as the range of pie plus the nullity of p. This orthogonal decomposition says to us that x is in the range of p if and only if x is orthogonal to the null space of p. True. And so our let's look at the proposition again in the proposition, this is our assumption.
00:13:59.054 - 00:15:00.492, Speaker A: So we have this. Therefore we have the inequality, the inequalities holds for any z. So assume if z is in the n of p, then p of z is equal to zero. Therefore in particular, p z and z is equal to zero. And the inequality implies that x and z equal to zero PI inequality, which means that x is orthogonal to n of pie. Therefore x belongs to the range of p. It's immediate if we just notice this equivalence.
00:15:00.492 - 00:16:27.710, Speaker A: And this is not explicitly mentioned in the book, even though when you look carefully to the proof, it's there. It's hidden in the proof. And why do we have x inner product with y? Because you simply for any z x in a product with z squared is less than or equal to c, p, z and z for any z, no restriction. And suppose y is such that p of y is equal to x. So here, pick your put z equal to y. What do we obtain? We obtain x and y squared is equal to c, p y and y less than or equal. Sorry, which is equal to c x and y inner product c is already positive.
00:16:27.710 - 00:17:29.854, Speaker A: So this shows that the inner product of x and y, of course, is bigger than or equal to zero. And so the absolute value here is not needed. And if we divide both sides by x inner product with y, we obtain x inner y is less than or equal to c two. So we need this. As I said, it is not clear why. It is not clear why x y inner product bigger than c less than or equal to bigger than zero less than or equal to c is important, but we will see later where it comes into picture. Now we are prepared for the important theorem which I mentioned again.
00:17:29.854 - 00:19:09.918, Speaker A: This is the theorem that tells us when a function is in this space and we can call it controlled finite interpolation. Let's see why it is called controlled finite interpolation. The setting as before, h is an rkhs on x k its kernel, and f a function on x with values in c. Then the following are equivalent. What are the following? First, one f is in the space. Second, there exists a constant set c and zero such that for any finite x one x ten subset of x distinct, there is a function f. Well, it's called h here.
00:19:09.918 - 00:19:55.704, Speaker A: Doesn't matter. There is a function h in the space h such that the norm is controlled. That is why it's called controlled. And h at point xi is equal to f at point xi. See, this is the meaning of controlled finite interpolation. We interpolate for I from one up to n. In other words, from x one up to x n.
00:19:55.704 - 00:21:15.844, Speaker A: So we are looking for a function in this space whose norm is controlled and it interpolates with values lambda I, which are equal to f of x y for any possible combinations of x one up to x finite controlled interpolation. So finite controlled interpolation is possible. The most important feature of part two is that c, the constant here, does not depend on H. If you change your x one up to x n, c remains fixed, meaning of controlled and three the same thing as two. But in another language there exists c bigger than or equal to zero such that c two k xy minus fxy. This is a function. It's a kernel function bigger than or equal to zero.
00:21:15.844 - 00:22:46.394, Speaker A: You will see that this is not something different, but the language is a bit different. If I call this l l bigger than or equal to zero is the same thing as l is a kernel function. So moreover, we can say something about c. Of course, if number two or number three works for one c, then for any c bigger is also working. You can increase the c, and still it works. So the natural question is that what is the minimum possible value for c in two or in three? And here is the answer. Moreover, if f is in h, then absolute value, the normal f is the least circle that satisfies, or that works in two and three.
00:22:46.394 - 00:23:52.248, Speaker A: We will see in the proof the way the proof will be given that two and three work with equal to the normal f. And then we will show that if two and three works for an arbitrary c, then there is a function f whose norm is less than the c. Therefore, this statement will follow true. That's a very precious theorem. So let's see how it works. I will work. One implies three, three implies two and two implies one.
00:23:52.248 - 00:25:23.154, Speaker A: That's the way I will prove it. So y one implies three. In other words y f being in h two implies that l is a kernel function. So let f be the set x one up to x n and in x arbitrary and alpha one alpha n arbitrary scalars and put g equal to alpha one k x one oh that's, that's plus plus alpha mkx then what can we say about, about the inner product of f and g f is the function which is already in h. This is our assumption. In one f is in h. Well on one hand.
00:25:23.154 - 00:26:50.964, Speaker A: On one hand if g inner product squared by cauchy Schwarz is less than or equal to normal f squared, norm of g squared and norm of g, we have computed many many times, is less than is equal to the sum over I and j alpha I bar alpha jkxi and x. I don't need this representation here. But if you recall this is also equal to kxi xj. This matrix applied at alpha one up to alpha n inner quadratic alpha one up. I don't need it here but this is equal to also equal to this. So, so what I need is this one is equal to this. On the other hand, what can I say about again f in a product with g.
00:26:50.964 - 00:28:40.636, Speaker A: On the other hand f energy is f some I from one up to n alpha I kxi take the sum out fkxi and I know this is sum I from one up to n alpha I bar f at point xi. Therefore if I square it f g squared is fg, I can write it fg times f g bar. One of them is sum. For this I write j from one up to n alpha j which one is bar. Let me look at it now. Alpha I bar. So I keep it with I here not j I from one up to an alpha I bar f of x I and for this one I use j alpha j flxj bar and I put both together.
00:28:40.636 - 00:30:00.264, Speaker A: It's some I and j from 120 alpha I bar alpha j f of xi flxj bar this is precisely equal and I know also that it's less than or equal to this combination. So I put them together. So that's the second one which I need. Therefore I put them together as sum I j from one up to n alpha I four alpha jffxj bar is less than or equal alpha bar for j k xix and if I move f to the other side, this is equivalent to sum I j from one up to n alpha I bar alpha j bar k. Oh, I forgot something important. I forgot something very important. I forgot this normal f squared.
00:30:00.264 - 00:31:00.004, Speaker A: So here I forgot normal f squared. Kxix minus fxi f. This is bigger than or equal to zero. This means that, this means that l of xy is equal to the norm of f squared. K x y minus f of x f is a kernel function. This is what I wanted to prove with c equal to the norm of f squared. That's why I said, I will show that number two and number three works.
00:31:00.004 - 00:31:45.844, Speaker A: Both of them work with the constant c equal to the normal f squared. So this is not something difficult. So this finishes. One implies three. Now why three implies two? The same setting as before. What do we want to prove here? We want to prove that if l is positive, then we have controlled finite interpolation. And in this case, we need our preceding proposition.
00:31:45.844 - 00:33:38.434, Speaker A: I mean, it's written here for any, even this one is better. Even this one is better. L is bigger than or equal to zero. This means that this combination is positive for any alpha I and alpha j. And what does this mean? This means that, I mean sum l positive. This means that for any combination x form, to expand the this sum I and j from one up to n alpha j normal f squared kxi xj minus fxifar. What happened? Okay, very good.
00:33:38.434 - 00:34:45.604, Speaker A: Xix r. This is positive. What is going on? I don't know. So the way I can write this, remember, in previous theorem, previous proposition, we had this. If x x star is less than or equal to Cp, this means that x is in the range of p. And also we have the control on an inner product. So here, this means that the matrix, I want to write this in this form.
00:34:45.604 - 00:36:32.344, Speaker A: This is equivalent to say that f. I don't understand. Why is it like this in the last 20 minutes? It wants to tease me. I don't know why this is less than or equal to. This is precisely the meaning of this. The sum of alpha I bar alpha j. Bracket the whole thing inside, bracket bigger than or equal to zero means that the matrix whose ij coefficient is this one is a positive matrix.
00:36:32.344 - 00:37:03.280, Speaker A: And that can be written also in this format. This is vector x. This is vector x star. If you do x star, you obtain the ij element here. And this is the ij element of this matrix. So the difference is positive is precisely what is written here. Why I wrote it in this way, because I want to use the previous proposition.
00:37:03.280 - 00:37:47.142, Speaker A: Now, x x star is less than or equal to a constant times p. This means that f x one. Oh, come on. This is in the range of our matrix g. I mean this one, sometimes I call it g in the book. Sometimes we call it q. And when we say it's in the range, it means that interpolation is possible.
00:37:47.142 - 00:39:06.804, Speaker A: So this means that there is h in h such that h at point xi is equal to f at point xi. And for any I equal to one or two. And now it's the point that you will understand why we had the inequality in the previous proposition. We had if, if r of y is equal to x, we had before, then inner product of x and y is controlled by c, which is here, the normal f squared and positive. Now we will see why this is needed. This really bothers me, and I don't know why it's like that. H.
00:39:06.804 - 00:40:42.184, Speaker A: If we consider h, which is of the minimum form, h has the form sum I from one to n alpha ikxi in Hf. And then again, the formula that we have, recall that the norm of h squared is the matrix kxi xj times the vector alpha. Nice. And this matrix plays the role of r r times x r times. Here it is. I wrote it here. R times y equals to x.
00:40:42.184 - 00:41:54.504, Speaker A: Being in the range means that there is an alpha such that our matrix times alpha is equal to what we are looking for. So this is equal to and being positive not needed. It's already we know. But what we know from previous proposition is then is less than or equal to c. And our c here is a specific c. So h squared is less than c equal to normal f squared in our case. Wow.
00:41:54.504 - 00:42:56.994, Speaker A: This finishes the part that three implies two. And you see the role of that inequality that we had before. The role of this one. It gives the, the control that we need on h. And now it remains to show that two implies one, two implies one. It means that if we can do the finite control interpolation, then there is a function which is in this space. So here, what is our assumption? Assumption is that for any f finite set and there is a function h, which I call it h index f with two properties.
00:42:56.994 - 00:44:08.300, Speaker A: The first one norm is controlled. The second one it does the interpolation hf of x is equal to f of x, not for every x for x in the finite set f. And our goal is to go beyond this and show that h is really equal to f. The general strategy is like this. If we have for example, one function which go which is true for say one point, then we consider two points and two points. The set is bigger. So if it works for this and it works for this, then instead of considering this, we consider the function for that.
00:44:08.300 - 00:44:56.288, Speaker A: And if it works for two points, it works also for three points. And so we increase the points. But somehow, somehow, when we increase our point, we should think about lean h of f for f. If we stay with finite, with sequences, it doesn't work because x should be, can be big, like for example, the unit disk. And if we add one point at the time, at the end, we consider just a countable number of points. So we even do not arrive at overset. That's one problem.
00:44:56.288 - 00:45:38.058, Speaker A: But if our set is also countable, still we need to take care of the limit. So why the limit in the general setting exists and we have the convergence. That's the main point. And this is precisely where we need the limit of nets, not limit of sequences, to go from finite number of the points to the whole space. Please allow me to stop here. On one hand we have just three, four minutes. On the other hand, this pen, I mean, really makes me nervous.
00:45:38.058 - 00:46:06.854, Speaker A: I don't know why it's not working properly. If anything, I write it clean. So I try to see what's the problem for the next time. So next time I will complete the proof of two implies one. And this will finish our chapter, chapter three and go chapter four. Thank you very much.
