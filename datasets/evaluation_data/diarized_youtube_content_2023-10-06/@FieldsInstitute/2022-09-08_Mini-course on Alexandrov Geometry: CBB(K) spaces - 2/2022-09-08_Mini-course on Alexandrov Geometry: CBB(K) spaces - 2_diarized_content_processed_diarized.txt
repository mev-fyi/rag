00:00:02.720 - 00:00:17.514, Speaker A: Okay, it starts it. All right. Okay, so let's start. This is the second lecture of the mini course of Anton Petronian on Alexandra spaces. CBBK spaces, please. Anton.
00:00:18.054 - 00:01:00.690, Speaker B: Thank you. So today I'm going to spend some like the lecture talking about definition and something closely related to definition. And I plan to define CBb Kappa space. But actually I will talk about CBB zero. So CBB is curvature bounded below by Kappa. So this is slightly simplified. In this case, Kappa zero is slightly simpler.
00:01:00.690 - 00:02:07.042, Speaker B: Instead of model plane, sphere, hyperbolic plane, or euclidean plane, I simply take euclidean plane and most of the things straightforwardly generalize to Kappa to general k for positive case. Sometimes you have, like you have to work a little bit more. But I will be happy to answer questions if you interested in the general case. But there is no, there is no much difference, right? Right. So first of all, I want to, I need to discuss model angles and triangles. So if I have a metric space, l and three points there, I can measure distances between the points. So I draw lines between them.
00:02:07.042 - 00:03:16.976, Speaker B: But it's a general metric space, so there might be no lines, right? No geodesics between them. Then I can, after that, given these three distances, I can draw a plane triangle with the same distances. And in this plane, triangles, I let it be x y z. That will be x twiddle y twiddle z twiddle. The more or less standard notation is that triangle x Tweedle y Tweedle z tweedle is a model triangle of xyz. Okay, if I need to emphasize that I want to work in the Kappa plane, I should put Kappa somewhere, right? But since, or in my case, I always assume Kappa is zero, so I will emit it. So that's a triangle in the plane, and in triangle in the plane I can measure angles.
00:03:16.976 - 00:05:04.774, Speaker B: Say for example, I can measure this angle, and this angle is simply denoted by comparison angle for x y z. So this little bit funny notation for the angle, I will explain later why I choose this notation instead of more standard one in euclidean geometry, which would be y xz, right? But there is a reason to not to use it, right? Okay, so that's by definition, right? Whenever I have three points in the, in the metric space, I can find this value, right? In principle, I could write a formula for this using cosine rule, but I don't want to, right? And so I have a function, function xy z. Three points in the metric space is mapped to xyz, to the model angle or comparison angle. That's the same thing. Questions? Comments? Okay, I hope that everybody knows it, actually. Yeah. By the way, I think that the lecture is oriented to those who heard definitions of Alexander space, but want to have like better understanding the interplay between the definitions.
00:05:04.774 - 00:06:12.324, Speaker B: Okay, so now I'm ready to talk about a four point comparison. So now I have still, I have a metric space L. So l stays for lower Kochi bound but doesn't matter. And I choose four points in my metric space, pxxy and z. And then I can measure comparison and model angle. For I can calculate three models angles with vertex pxy plus p y z plus p. Oh, sorry, pzx.
00:06:12.324 - 00:06:48.464, Speaker B: Okay, so that's the inequality. So L is CBB zero space if and only if this inequality holds for any points pie x, y z in L. Questions? Comments that I gave a definition of Koch bounded below.
00:06:50.044 - 00:06:52.824, Speaker A: Are we defining taking this matrix?
00:06:54.324 - 00:06:57.824, Speaker B: Sorry, your voice is breaking. So could you repeat it?
00:06:58.524 - 00:07:01.184, Speaker A: Are we taking this matrix versus to be geodesic?
00:07:01.944 - 00:07:42.390, Speaker B: No, no, I don't, I don't assume anything. I may take at the moment. I may take any metric space and check this inequality for any four points. If it's inequality holds, I say that it's kouch bounded below by zero. Right? But on the other hand, you're right that if, like all applications, comes from, with additional. So when you, when you, when it comes to application, you additionally assume that L is a length space. And sometimes, like, we don't pack it in our book, we don't pack it in the definition.
00:07:42.390 - 00:08:22.978, Speaker B: So, curvature bounded below is separate from length space. But most of the time, people say that Alexander space is the CBB length space, right? So it's just inside and usually it's complete. Right? Completeness is. So that's two assumptions which usually appear in the, together with length spaces. Okay? Yeah. Okay. So next thing is we will try to like, okay, we want to say.
00:08:22.978 - 00:09:35.634, Speaker B: So eventually we want to work with geodesics in spaces with lower k bound and we want to show that they exist. Right? First of all, even if you assume that space is length and complete NCBB zero, it doesn't imply that it's geodesic space. So some points might be not connected by geodesic. All right, so let me give an example of such case. You may take s infinity in Hilbert space. All right, so that's infinite dimensional sphere and it's, I didn't prove it, and I probably, I'm not planning to prove it, but it's rather easy to prove that. This is example of space of curvature bounded below by zero, in fact, by one and in the sphere, you have plenty of geodesics that if you choose two opposite points, there are plenty of geodesics that connect them.
00:09:35.634 - 00:10:17.964, Speaker B: I should say one more thing, but in matrix geometry, when I say geodesic, it means always minimizing geodesic, right? It's not romanian term. It's a little bit different. Like if you used to term in romanian geometry, it's not the same. Okay, sometimes people say short express, sometimes minimizing geodesic. But yeah, okay, so we have plenty of geodesics that connects to points. Now, assume I take, I mean, some at a normal basis. So that will be element e zero, and I have e one, e two, and so on.
00:10:17.964 - 00:12:05.968, Speaker B: And now, around every element of my basis, I cut little head from the sphere, okay? That can be used. Such head can be used to make a shortcut between opposite points, points minus e zero and e zero. And if I make it these small cuts, bigger and bigger and bigger as n goes to infinity, but not approaching like some constant, but never, like always strictly bigger than, strictly smaller than some constant epsilon, then you get a space where there is no geodesic connecting opposite points. So whenever I choose some geodesic which is sufficiently close to the minimizing one, in the next hat, I will get a yet shorter one, okay? So it will be no geodesics at all. Nevertheless, you have a property that spaces complete, complete cbb, zero length, length spaces r g delta geodesic. What does it mean? That. That means that if I choose, I may change, I may choose everywhere dense g delta set in my.
00:12:05.968 - 00:13:01.044, Speaker B: For any. So I have to define this thing, right? I have to define this. So that means that I may, for any point p in my space, I may choose g delta dense set of points such that for any, say, for any point q in a, there is a geodesic connection p to q. In fact, I may assume that it's unique. This geodesic is unique, right? So that's the statement. And that's the theorem of plaut. Let me just.
00:13:01.044 - 00:14:55.694, Speaker B: So that's the plough's theorem, who, by the way, contributed quite a bit, Conor plough, who contributed quite a bit to the theory of Alexander. Space without dimension, condition of infinite dimension, infinite dimensional spaces. Okay, so how to prove such thing? Assume I have, like what? First of all, I want to show the following. That for there is a, there is a g delta dense set in l such that of, say, set a such that for any point, for any q in a that is r such that the angle comparison angle p q r. So this angle is nearly PI. So it's, it's bigger than PI minus epsilon for any given epsilon. So why is it so, right.
00:14:55.694 - 00:15:47.184, Speaker B: So if I choose a point, I may find a collection. So I may. So since my space is length space, I may find in a small neighborhood of points that Elmos lie on the geodesic. That means that this triangle inequality becomes almost equality. And once I see this angle must be nearly PI, so that, and it's true for any, for some open sets here. So I could find open then set such that this inequality holds for sum r. So that will be my r and q will be any point around here.
00:15:47.184 - 00:16:57.658, Speaker B: And passing to intersection of all these sets, I will get g delta, then set. So it's like for large set of points, this inequality holds like there is r such that this inequality holds for any positive website. Now, it's easy to see, once you have such point in this g delta set, it's easy to see that geodesic must be unique, right? If there is a two geodesics, so then you know that this angle is l must PI and this angle is l must PI. And by comparison, this angle must be nearly zero. And then applying comparison, it's rather easy to. So what the, the definition of angle comparison. So what does it mean? That means that if I choose two points on the same distance from q, then these two points must lie very close to each other.
00:16:57.658 - 00:17:54.534, Speaker B: This distance must be very small, and this distance must be arbitrary small like since this angle is almost zero. So that means that actually these two geodesics coincide. And applying pretty much the same argument, you can show that you can prove existence of geodesics. So what? In order to prove existence, what you have to show that there is a midpoint. Once you construct a midpoint between two points, you can iterate the construction and pass to the limit, right? And in the limit you will get a geodesic. And to construct this midpoint, you what you actually, from the, from the fact that your space is length space, you get Elmer's midpoints. For any epsilon, there is a point that lies almost in the middle.
00:17:54.534 - 00:18:44.182, Speaker B: And the same argument shows that this sequence is cachie. And so it must convergence. From completeness you get midpoints. So, questions, comments about this statement? So we get, we get important, like from now on, we have plenty of geodesics in Alexander space, right? So, like whenever we perturb one of the end of one of the elements of pair and can connect two points by unique geodesic. No questions. I have a question here. When you say g delta dense, is this just a set whose closure is g delta? G delta dense.
00:18:44.182 - 00:19:07.298, Speaker B: So g delta set is the intersection of countable many open sets. That's the definition of g delta set. And delta dense set means that all your open sets are dense. So it's intersection of countably many sets such that each is dense. I'm not sure. Did I answer your question or not? Yes, you did. That makes sense.
00:19:07.298 - 00:19:35.040, Speaker B: Okay, so, right. The standard definition. Right. So, like when you, when you don't have measure, right, to say that most of points lie, like have certain properties, you have obviously, in complete metric space, you can always talk about G delta dense sets. That's roughly by Bayer's theorem that tells you that most of points satisfy this property. Right. Okay, question here.
00:19:35.040 - 00:20:00.024, Speaker B: Could you state the result again? Plouck's theorem. Sure. Just a second. Here it is. So we have a complete CBB length space is J delta geodesic. And J Delta geodesic means that for any point, like, maybe I should write it nicely, maybe. Let me write it here.
00:20:00.024 - 00:21:02.814, Speaker B: For any point p, there is one g delta dense set, ap in L, such that for any q in Ap, there is unique geodesic pq. Okay, so did I answer your question? Yes. So is the idea that a sub p is almost the whole space. Yeah. Right. That's exactly right. If you remove little set in the sense.
00:21:02.814 - 00:21:20.004, Speaker B: In the sense of where categories. Right. And remain for the remaining set, you have unique geodesic. Okay, great. Thank you. Okay. Okay, so let me add one more.
00:21:20.004 - 00:22:22.704, Speaker B: Okay. So now once I have. Once I have geodesics, I could talk about angles and angle comparison. That another equivalent way to define Alexander spaces, but which is good for people who has good background in euclidean geometry. If you used to do euclidean geometry, you, I don't know, roughly, you can do Alexander geometry the same way as euclidean geometry, except you have some equalities supposed to be exchanged to inequalities, right. In a certain way. First of all, that, like, let me draw a picture.
00:22:22.704 - 00:23:06.284, Speaker B: So I assume I have the following picture. I have two points, x and y in the space. I assume there is a geodesic between them. And I have a point z on this geodesic. And yet I have another point p. So now I have picture p that like, once I have such picture, it is described by five real numbers, right? Because I have one restriction, z now lies between x and y. Okay, so then one equivalent condition.
00:23:06.284 - 00:25:18.246, Speaker B: So, okay, so say l is. Is complete cbb zero length, length space. If and only if l is j delta geodesic plus, for any picture like this, for any p x y z, as on the diagram, we have the following inequality z r p x plus angle z py is less or equal PI, right? So one way it's easy to prove, right? So since I, if I take the center z and apply four point comparison, I know that model angles of these three angles add up to something smaller than two PI. But this angle, the last angle, zxy, is exactly PI because it lies on the jdisic. By the way, the angle, by definition lies between zero and PI. It's easy, easy to see from the definition PI. So you get this inequality, but in fact it's enough once you know that space is geodesic g delta ge, this condition is sufficient to prove for point comparison, right, I will skip it.
00:25:18.246 - 00:26:00.194, Speaker B: I will like, I will list some statements, some other angle comparisons, and after that we'll say what's the tool can be used to prove them. So I don't want to give all proofs. Okay, so questions about this definition. It's very close to the four point comparison which I described before, except that you made a restriction. Instead of talking about arbitrary quadruple, you may talk about quadruple with central point line on geodesic between two others. But of course you might, you have to pay for this. And the thing you pay is this condition.
00:26:00.194 - 00:27:25.982, Speaker B: You assume that your space is delta J D. Okay, so next statement is, okay, I will redraw the picture x y z, and then I can write an equality between the comparison angles x py must be less or equal than x p z. Okay, so at angle at the point x, I can measure two comparison angles for triangle xzp and for triangle x yp. And for triangle xyp, the comparison angle cannot be larger. Oops, I forget the middle here. Okay. Or you may, equivalently, you may describe it the following way.
00:27:25.982 - 00:28:35.974, Speaker B: You take a model triangle x twiddle y twiddle p tweedle, and take a point z tweedle on the side that corresponds to z. So this side is exactly the same as this one. Then this distance must be smaller than corresponding distances in the space, right? That's second definition. And this definition, like, again, that's rather easy to prove. Equivalence of two statements, four point comparison, the previous comparison, which I described. And again, you, of course, you have to use that the spaces g delta geodesic. But from this you get extra calorie that you actually can define angles between geodesic coming from the, from one point.
00:28:35.974 - 00:30:36.784, Speaker B: So from once once you have this statement, you know that if you move a point, say, assume I have point x, say pq, right? And if I take some point q bar on this side, p bar on this side, and whenever I move a point closer to x, the value, the comparison angle x p bar, q bar getting larger. Once I have this, I have a limit of this angle. So this angle must converge to something as p bar and q bar converge to x. And this something is denoted by angle of the hinge x pq. So this notation of the hinge, this is simply shortcut notation for two j basics x p and x x q, right? So from this second comparison, I get existence of the angles between any pair of geodesic like existence of angle for any hinge, right? And this will be the third comparison statement, again equivalent to original one modular that spaces g delta JD is equal. No questions. Okay, so finally, let me give one more diffini.
00:30:38.164 - 00:31:01.234, Speaker A: Yeah, so suppose I know that my space has curvature bounded above by some key and bounded below by some k prime. So I can calculate a angle from above, right? Also, just like we doing cat capacity, will that angle be equal to this angle?
00:31:02.334 - 00:31:22.246, Speaker B: Sorry, I don't know what, by the way, do you hear me? I mean, what about my voice? Do you hear me? Right, because, yeah, I can hear you all right. Yeah. Can you just repeat the question? Yeah, maybe, maybe slow, because, because you breaking, you're breaking up like a constant.
00:31:22.270 - 00:31:44.624, Speaker A: Okay, so in cat case spaces, we can calculate the angle comparison angle by looking at, by looking at a constant curvature and calculate that. And now here you are, you are looking at the lower boundary, lower bound angles. So are those angles related somehow? That's what I'm asking.
00:31:45.204 - 00:31:58.220, Speaker B: Okay. Will they be, let me say again, I get only half of you, but my conjecture is what you're asking. Does it, does the definition of angle depend on kappa? Is it correct or not?
00:31:58.332 - 00:31:59.184, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:31:59.484 - 00:32:47.282, Speaker B: Okay. I was afraid. Right. So, no, it does not. Right. So if the triangle is very small, then Kappa comparison x y z is nearly the same as Kappa prime comparison angle XYZ for small triangle. That's just simple calculations, right? So it doesn't really matter what couple you use when, when you approach to, when two points approach the vertex of the handle.
00:32:47.282 - 00:32:51.826, Speaker B: Is it, is it, are you sure that was the question? Am I?
00:32:51.850 - 00:32:52.394, Speaker A: Yes.
00:32:52.554 - 00:33:37.762, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Okay. So can I continue or some other questions? No. Okay, so from now on I can talk about angles. If I have a hinge, say x p y, I can measure the angle between this hinge and from the definition of angle. I also have that the comparison angle x p y is always smaller.
00:33:37.762 - 00:34:31.074, Speaker B: Right? So that's the. We get it as a supremum of all comparison angles with. So p x y with y bar and p bar sliding along the geodesic toward two x. Right? So in particular, we get this inequality. So, but. And you could also write, so there is an equivalent way, but, like, it's not enough. And that's, like, first thing, like, funny thing about the definition, there is an open question, like, whether this is equivalent, gives you equivalent definition, but what's sufficient to be like.
00:34:31.074 - 00:35:34.682, Speaker B: Of course, it follows from the definition, but might be not equivalent. And what is needed here is that angle z. Oh, sorry. Z py plus angle z px is less or equal than PI whenever z lies between x and y. So, right, so let's. Let me make a remark, right? We are very close to defining Alexander spaces, and this is unknown whether this condition is really needed. Maybe this condition is equivalent to the original one.
00:35:34.682 - 00:36:43.680, Speaker B: And it's not even known for surfaces. It's not even known for. Known for two dimensional Alexander spaces. Right? So what's the tools? How to prove these things? So there, there are two, like, the proofs are quite straightforward. So there are two things you have to use, right? One is this the Alexander Flemmer, and another is triangle inequality for engels. Okay, so Alexander Flemmer is, I think Sasha Lichak already talked about this, but let me quickly say what it is. It's a lemma in euclidean plane geometry, or like better say kappa plane geometry, right? It's some statement which holds for spheres, hyperbolic planes and euclidean plane.
00:36:43.680 - 00:37:48.964, Speaker B: So imagine that you have a quadrilateral, you fix sizes, sites, and you think that at the vertices you have joints, right? So this quadrilateral can move. And when you move, you can measure different things. You can measure this distance, you can measure this angle, or you can measure some of these two angles. Okay? And the statement is that these three quantities are monotonic with respect to each other. Each of these values completely determines the quadrilateral. And once it's fixed, the other are they also fixed. And the dependence is monotonic.
00:37:48.964 - 00:38:52.290, Speaker B: Right? So that's one thing. And the other thing, that is a triangle inequality for angles. If you have a space where angles are defined, right? So that means that whenever you choose, say, two jedi coming from one point, you slide points toward the vertex, measure comparison angle. And you, no matter how. How fast they go, like maybe one go very fast, and now another go slow to the vertex, the limit will be always the same. Right? That's what, that's the case for spaces with curvature, with low curvature bound, right. Whenever you have space with well defined angles, the three angles, this one, this one and that one, such as y triangle inequality.
00:38:52.290 - 00:39:22.686, Speaker B: That's again, very simple statement, very straightforward. Right. So in these two statements, you combine them and the proof equivalent, and you, you can prove equivalence of the definitions. So that's. I finished the first part, right. And let me quickly say two more, maybe some questions. So I like.
00:39:22.686 - 00:40:28.024, Speaker B: Yeah, right. So that's angle comparison are most useful for people coming with good background in euclidean geometry. Now, I will quickly say one statement about function comparison and maybe. Yeah, I will skip development. Right. So another way, another equivalent way to define Alexander space is the following. You take, if I given a point p in the Alexander space, you can consider a function which is a distance function from point p squared over two, and then f is one concave, you can write it as f double prime, less than one.
00:40:28.024 - 00:41:59.902, Speaker B: And what does it mean? That means that if you restrict f to any geodesic, so gamma is unit speed speed geodesic, then the function f composed with gamma, which is now real to real function, is so minus t square over two is concave, right? So that has perfect statement, right? That's a perfect statement about function real to real function. Right? And you can informally write it as f composed with gamma double prime. Let's recall one, right? In distributional sense. And this is just defines this inequality, right? So there is a way to rewrite the Alexander comparison in terms of function, like convexity of certain functions. So that's, again, very useful if you want to do, if you, if you good at analysis, right? So that's okay. So I will. I will skip development.
00:41:59.902 - 00:42:12.744, Speaker B: Oh, by the way, maybe I should say here, right, that. Yeah, I will skip this part. So if. No questions, I will come to. I will, I will, I will talk about.
00:42:13.164 - 00:42:14.748, Speaker A: Sorry, can I ask one question?
00:42:14.876 - 00:43:13.774, Speaker B: Yeah. So the one concavity in there, is that specifically because you have Cvb zero, right? If it's not zero, then formulas become more complicated, right? You have to apply certain modification of distance that depends on kappa. You take it composition with distance, function, distance, function two p, right? That's your function f and the function f supposed to satisfy inequality like this. F double prime, right? Okay, thank you. But. So formulas are just more complicated, but pretty much the same thing works, right? And this is true, if Kappa is positive or negative, this. You have to be careful, right? So if, if it's positive, then you have to.
00:43:13.774 - 00:43:33.362, Speaker B: It works in the balls of radius PI. I mean, like, if it's. If Kappa is one, right? If Kappa is one, then this inequality holds in ball of radius one PI, right. And doesn't. Doesn't work after. Right. And there is a question whether you want to consider spaces.
00:43:33.362 - 00:43:59.754, Speaker B: Like there is a disagreement, right? Say real line, does it have curvature? Great. Recall one or not. So, for example, in our book, we think that, yes, and most of other people think that no. But it's like little bit, little weird part around definition. It's difference only in one dimensional case. Up a dimensional case, it doesn't matter. So, more questions.
00:44:00.054 - 00:44:00.994, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:44:02.574 - 00:45:15.634, Speaker B: Yeah, I answered. Okay, so now the next thing is globalization. So what, what is it about? It's. You may think that it's a generalization of the Panagov comparison theorem. And it says that locally local CBB zero implies CBB zero, of course, plus complete and lengthy. So, locally CBB zero means that you check the condition, for example, the four point comparison in the little neighborhood of each point, if it holds, if any point there is a neighborhood such that the comparison holds, then the space is locally zero. And it turns out that in this case, it must be globally zero.
00:45:15.634 - 00:45:50.754, Speaker B: Globally CBB zero. So, questions about statement. So, this statement. So it's a generalization of Topanogov theorem. Topanogov theorem is in terms generalization of Alexandrov comparison theorem, which was in dimension two, and Topanogov did it in arbitrary dimension. The proof does not change much, but it was an important observation that you can do the same thing in all dimensions. Not necessary to.
00:45:50.754 - 00:46:52.314, Speaker B: After the proof of globalization theorem, in most general case was done by, in the original paper by Borago, Gromov and Perelman. And after that. But the proof was not very simple. And I will talk about some simplification, which had a sequence of simplification, which is done by. Originally, the first statement was. The first step was done by Conrad Plaut, and after that by Urslang and Victor Schroeder. And the same proof, just independently, we did it in our book.
00:46:52.314 - 00:48:08.834, Speaker B: Right? So that's kind of. Yeah. Okay, so what's the, what's the argument? So, we want to use angle. We want to prove angle comparison, right? So we want to show that given angle, say, it's equivalent way to say the following. Right? So I assume I have a triangle px pq in my space, I measure this angle, and now I draw a comparison hinge with the same angle in the plane. Then this side must be greater than this side. Okay, so that's the comparison.
00:48:08.834 - 00:49:28.230, Speaker B: And what do I know? So the second part with the angles is just easy to get from local statements. And what I know, I know that this inequality holds if the hinge I start is sufficiently small. So, to measure the size of hinge, I can add up, say l, I can add up x distance from x to p to distance from x to q. So, yeah, right. So let me, let me just make a, I forget to make it an assumption. So, I assume that l is compact, compact, and in particular geodesic space. So there are two points connected by geodesic, but this assumption is not really serious, right? Like there are simple patches that generalize the proof, which I will present to general l, right? So in this case, I may say I can assume that this inequality holds.
00:49:28.230 - 00:50:54.854, Speaker B: For if l is smaller than some l zero and strictly less than zero. And maybe it doesn't hold, like arguing by contradiction, I may assume that it doesn't hold for some hinge bigger than l zero, right? So there is a, I can choose little bit above l zero, a little bit bigger hinge, such that this inequality doesn't hold anymore. And I want to, right? So I want to get a contradiction, right? So what, what I can do, I start with my hinge pq x. And I think of it as the first point in my sequence. So on each step, I choose the side of my hinge, which is longer. And I go there by some distance, say one of the third of this side, and I get new hinge, and next step, maybe still longer, I can choose this point. And then I travel back and forth, maybe four, and so on.
00:50:54.854 - 00:52:17.384, Speaker B: So, I get a sequence of points and a sequence of hinges in my metric space. So by assumption that my comparison hold for smaller hinges. So for each hinge, say xi xi plus one, and here might be p or q or q, depending on which side it was the comparison hold. Comparison hold. And I can use it, okay? So now I will try to draw the comparison picture. Let me take this triangle and find a comparison triangle for this p zero x one. Let me extend aside Tweedles, right? Every time I use Tweedle to denote the corresponding point in the comparison plane, let me extend it and get a corresponding point, q Tweedle.
00:52:17.384 - 00:53:32.474, Speaker B: So first of all, by comparison, this angle is smaller than this angle, right? Smaller, equal. So that means that this distance is smaller than comparison distance. So if I would draw the comparison hinge, the angle would be bigger, right? So once I have big angle, the opposite side getting bigger. So that was my original distance. And after that it's getting shorter. Okay, now I know that comparison holds for this angle, right? Again, this angle is smaller than this one. And once I know this, I know that the complement angle here is bigger than the complement.
00:53:32.474 - 00:54:43.494, Speaker B: And that complement angle here, right? And that means that if I want to draw comparison hinge for this one, for x one, it will have small angle here, right? Say q tweedle double prime. And this distance will be yet smaller, right? So when I go from x one to x zero to x one, and draw comparison hinge, the opposite side is getting smaller. And each time I pass from x one to x two, from x two to x three, and so on, it's getting smaller. So this, this distance comparison, distance comparison side opposite comparison side can be. Is getting smaller. On the other hand, this angle is converging to PI. Why? Because if it's not, then on each step we would shorten the distance, the.
00:54:43.494 - 00:55:32.294, Speaker B: The sum of sides considerably, right? By some positive delta. So we have just a finite amount of distance to like, it still must be greater than distance from p to q, right? Or better say it's. It still should be positive, right? So in, in the limit you get that this angle is PI. And so in the limit you get comparison. So if the angle is actually PI, you get comparison by. Simply by triangle inequality. So each time your opposite side is getting smaller, right at the beginning, your opposite side is.
00:55:32.294 - 00:56:28.584, Speaker B: Oh, sorry, something wrong? But. Right. So, yeah, yeah, I messed up with something, but some signs of inequalities getting wrong in my head. But that's pretty much the proof, right? So we have monotonicity of sequence, and in the limit we get comparison. So each, on each step you get. Only you get in, you get in picture worse and worse and worse and worse. And in the limit, your picture is good, right? So that's a contradiction.
00:56:28.584 - 00:57:08.954, Speaker B: Roughly. Sorry for this. I don't have much time to like to fix this statement, but I will. I will show you the link to correct proof, right? Actually, everything correct. Except I made some stupid change with sign somewhere. Right? I was planning to mention Kirch Brown theorem for the as another definition of Alexander comparison. But I don't have time, so better leave some time for the questions.
00:57:08.954 - 00:57:15.030, Speaker B: Any questions?
00:57:15.142 - 00:57:16.674, Speaker A: Okay, questions please.
00:57:24.594 - 00:58:06.324, Speaker B: No, I have one. This might not really have a good answer, but is there a definition for Alexandrov space that you find yourself leaning on more often than the others? So, look, I like euclidean geometry. And for me, angle comparison is the best, right? At least sometimes when I write a proof. It's easier to write used in function comparison, but still, I think in terms of angle comparison, but it depends on your background, right. Like what you write, what you used to do. Right. For some people I know that function comparison is more useful.
00:58:06.324 - 00:58:32.754, Speaker B: Right. And in fact, sometimes proofs are very much shorter with function comparisons. Yeah. Did I answer? Yeah. Thank you. Okay, so, finished. So next time I will talk about convex functions and gradient flow.
00:58:32.754 - 00:59:06.420, Speaker B: And in the last lecture I will talk about finite dimensional Alexander spaces and some tools which appear. Some extra tools which appear in the finite dimensional case. Actually. Can I ask a question? Yes. So, in the previous talk, there was also a local theorem, but they required by one to be trivial. But you mean social stock, right? Yes. Right.
00:59:06.420 - 00:59:20.032, Speaker B: And you don't have it, you don't need it, right? Yes. So. So the proof that was similar, but somehow it's not needed here. Where is it? It's not. It's not similar, right. It's just like. Right? Yeah.
00:59:20.032 - 00:59:51.386, Speaker B: I mean, in some sense, yes. You, you take triangles and so on, like get, like cat case is much simpler, right. I know that it took a while to find the spool, right? And it took yet many years to make a proof like simple. As you. As you see, it's sufficiently simple proof after all. Right? But it wasn't easy to find it. But the cat zero is rather a rather straightforward thing, right.
00:59:51.386 - 01:00:39.524, Speaker B: You just have thin triangles, and if you glue them together, the thinness propagates to bigger triangular, right. That's all right. And here, observe that you don't break here you don't break a triangle into like expected proof would be to break your triangle in some pieces, right. Use comparison locally and get a comparison for big triangle. And here, it's not exactly like you. You need to apply it infinitely many times. And why the expected thing is not working? What? Why what? Why doesn't the expected thing not work? This one, you mean? Yes, the infinite way, it doesn't work just because it doesn't work.
01:00:39.524 - 01:01:10.884, Speaker B: At least nobody able to do this infinite steps, right? You need to do infinite steps. And in the limit you get. It's like in the limit you get it from triangle inequality. But is there gluing in? No, it works like gluing doesn't work here. Right. In CAD, zero case triangles are thin and you glue two triangles and you get thin triangles again. And in CBB case, triangles are fat.
01:01:10.884 - 01:01:34.794, Speaker B: When you glue two fat triangles, you get nothing. I see, right at the very beginning of definitions, this development of cats and CBB are very similar, but actually they diverge. That's roughly the place where it diverges quite a bit. Yeah, I see. Thank you. You're very welcome. More questions?
01:01:40.294 - 01:01:53.614, Speaker A: Okay, if there are no questions, let's thank Antonio and I'll see you tomorrow. So the recordings are already available.
