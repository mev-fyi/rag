00:00:27.474 - 00:00:27.706, Speaker A: Okay.
00:00:27.730 - 00:00:29.178, Speaker B: So am I supposed to start?
00:00:29.306 - 00:00:32.506, Speaker C: Yeah, you can. You can share and start whenever you like.
00:00:32.570 - 00:00:33.334, Speaker D: Okay.
00:00:33.674 - 00:00:38.978, Speaker C: If you, if you share, I'll have a refresher on what the title is and I can introduce you.
00:00:39.146 - 00:00:40.574, Speaker D: Okay, perfect.
00:00:42.114 - 00:00:43.026, Speaker B: Wait a moment.
00:00:43.090 - 00:00:51.934, Speaker D: I have to, but it's.
00:00:54.054 - 00:00:55.314, Speaker B: At the moment.
00:01:05.174 - 00:01:06.274, Speaker D: Okay.
00:01:06.574 - 00:01:07.222, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:07.318 - 00:01:10.514, Speaker D: So do you see well or not so well?
00:01:11.014 - 00:01:11.470, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:11.502 - 00:01:13.274, Speaker D: It seems now it's okay.
00:01:15.694 - 00:01:22.594, Speaker C: I'm actually so happy you're doing it like this. This is super cool.
00:01:23.494 - 00:01:24.022, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:24.078 - 00:01:24.334, Speaker D: Yes.
00:01:24.374 - 00:01:29.674, Speaker B: I'm sorry. Just that it's moving a bit, the focus. I hope it stabilizes.
00:01:31.574 - 00:01:42.874, Speaker C: It looks pretty good right now. So we're very happy to have Matteo Viale, who's going to talk about the absolute model companionship spectrum and the continuum problem.
00:01:43.294 - 00:02:43.484, Speaker B: Okay, well, I'm very happy to have the occasion to talk in your seminar. And actually, this is a follow up of a seminar I gave two years ago when I started to have this type of results. But there I still have them in a very preliminary form, and now I have a very, I think, clean organization of the results. And essentially those results amount to resent using model theoretic terminology and ideas, many generic absoluteness results that were obtained by various people, starting with the seminal work of Wudin on generic absoluteness results for second order arithmetic. Then the Pmax work, which gets generic absoluteness results for the theory of HLF two, and then the combination of these results with the bounded for synapse results.
00:02:44.064 - 00:02:45.644, Speaker D: And so on and so forth.
00:02:46.104 - 00:03:59.944, Speaker B: And I will show that we can use the notion of model companionship to give a very neat model theoretic presentation of these results, this generic absoluteness results. Okay, so let me start from the beginning with. So essentially this will be a basic model theory talk for almost all of the time. And in the last part, I will present essentially a way to classify first order theory using the notion of model companionship. And then I will apply these classification tools that I am going to introduce to use them to analyze set theory astromatized by GFC, and see what this model theoretic tool says about set theory and how many generic absoluteness results can be rephrased in this model theoretical terminology. So let me start with the following basic fact.
00:04:02.504 - 00:04:12.204, Speaker D: Let ts be tau theories. Oh, that's terrible. I don't understand why.
00:04:12.504 - 00:04:18.400, Speaker A: Let's see. It's. Okay.
00:04:18.432 - 00:04:21.324, Speaker C: Maybe it just needed some letters to focus on.
00:04:23.024 - 00:04:25.696, Speaker D: It seems to be clearing up. Okay.
00:04:25.880 - 00:04:27.840, Speaker B: The problem is when I'm moving.
00:04:27.952 - 00:04:28.728, Speaker D: Okay, no, that.
00:04:28.776 - 00:04:29.364, Speaker A: No.
00:04:30.974 - 00:04:32.654, Speaker B: So the problem is when I move.
00:04:32.774 - 00:04:34.834, Speaker D: It seems that it shifts the focus.
00:04:36.294 - 00:04:37.034, Speaker B: And.
00:04:39.654 - 00:04:45.474, Speaker D: The following are equivalent one t.
00:04:46.094 - 00:05:07.894, Speaker B: I'm very picky and I'm extremely redundant in notation, but because we will soon see that this is convenient to some extent. So what is this? This is, let me say it for s, tau for all, and then the same applies to tau for all. So these are the c such that.
00:05:08.014 - 00:05:17.634, Speaker D: S models C, and C is universal tau sentence.
00:05:20.054 - 00:05:20.758, Speaker A: Okay?
00:05:20.846 - 00:05:45.316, Speaker B: And accordingly, we define theta for all. And this is, let's say, the syntactic way to say this concept. And the semantic way is this one for all m, which is a tau model, a tau structure. We get that M models T implies there exists an n which is a superstructure of M according to tau, and.
00:05:45.340 - 00:05:48.380, Speaker E: Then models s. Okay?
00:05:48.412 - 00:05:53.824, Speaker B: So if you have a model of T, you can extend it to a tau structure which is a model of.
00:05:53.864 - 00:05:56.088, Speaker D: S. And it's clear that if you.
00:05:56.096 - 00:06:18.232, Speaker B: Have two, you get one, because if you take a universal sentence which follows from S, you take a model of T, you take a superstructure with model S. It models the universal sentence, and then it's a substructure of a model of a universal sentence. So it models as well the universal sentence. So is this argument for two implies.
00:06:18.288 - 00:06:29.716, Speaker D: One here, and one implies two is.
00:06:29.740 - 00:06:34.844, Speaker B: A basic compactness argument. So what you do, you take the.
00:06:34.884 - 00:06:40.980, Speaker D: Theory S union delta zero M for.
00:06:41.092 - 00:06:45.948, Speaker E: M, a model of T. Okay?
00:06:45.996 - 00:06:55.868, Speaker B: So delta zero M is the atomic diagram. So this is equal to the C of a one an, such that a.
00:06:55.916 - 00:07:06.228, Speaker D: One an belongs to M, and M models C of a one an, and.
00:07:06.356 - 00:07:08.984, Speaker B: C is quantifier free.
00:07:10.384 - 00:07:11.324, Speaker A: Okay?
00:07:13.544 - 00:07:15.600, Speaker D: And it's clear that if we get.
00:07:15.632 - 00:07:46.094, Speaker B: The model of this theory, then this model realized it is a superstructure of M because it realizes the quantifier three diagram. So this allows to embed the quantifier free diagram into the model of this theory. And it's also a model of S, so it contradicts two. So if this theory is consistent, sorry, if M is a counterexample to the truth of two, this theory must be inconsistent.
00:07:46.874 - 00:07:48.002, Speaker D: Is this okay?
00:07:48.138 - 00:08:06.844, Speaker B: Should I move on? Okay, so let me continue the proof. So what happens now is that this theory is inconsistent. If M witnesses.
00:08:10.104 - 00:08:11.564, Speaker D: Two fails.
00:08:13.744 - 00:08:14.264, Speaker A: We get.
00:08:14.304 - 00:08:22.044, Speaker D: That S union delta zero m is inconsistent by compactness.
00:08:24.984 - 00:08:29.204, Speaker B: We find c of h zero an.
00:08:29.804 - 00:08:38.184, Speaker D: Such that S plus c of h zero an is inconsistent.
00:08:40.604 - 00:09:15.118, Speaker B: And now we are in business because this is a quantifier free formula. So we get that S deduced the negation of c of h zero an because S plus c of h zero n is inconsistent. But now those are elements of M, so they are outside of the language. So we get that as deduce sentence with the constants which are not appearing in the language of S, which implies that S deduce for all x zero.
00:09:15.246 - 00:09:35.344, Speaker D: Xn, not c of h, zero of x zero x n. Well, and now we also have that M models exist, x c of x zero xn.
00:09:38.124 - 00:09:49.506, Speaker B: And this gives that if s for all tau is a subset of theta.
00:09:49.530 - 00:10:01.930, Speaker D: Overall, which is one, then we get that for all x, not c of x, zero x n belongs to theta.
00:10:01.962 - 00:10:08.426, Speaker E: Overall, but M models t. And we.
00:10:08.450 - 00:10:17.754, Speaker B: Get the contradiction because it models this sentence and this sentence, and they're clearly incompatible. Okay, so this is the argument.
00:10:19.014 - 00:10:22.942, Speaker D: So we see the fact that every.
00:10:22.998 - 00:10:42.664, Speaker B: Model of a certain theory is bi embedded. Well, is embeddable in the model of another theory, amounts to an equivalence in the universal fragment of the theory. So if the universal fragment of the theories are the same, every model of one theory embeds in a model of the other theory conversely.
00:10:43.844 - 00:10:46.184, Speaker D: So this is the first point.
00:10:50.364 - 00:11:02.704, Speaker B: And now comes the key notion, which is, I mean, one of those that brought my attention to the notion of model companionship, which is the definition of existentially closed model.
00:11:04.124 - 00:11:23.718, Speaker D: Let's, now the theory M is tec if one m is a substructure of.
00:11:23.806 - 00:11:26.030, Speaker B: N, which is a model of t.
00:11:26.142 - 00:11:35.130, Speaker D: For some n, and two is m.
00:11:35.282 - 00:11:42.450, Speaker B: Is sigma, one elementary n for all n, which are a substructure of M.
00:11:42.602 - 00:11:46.634, Speaker D: And n, which models T. Okay, so.
00:11:46.754 - 00:12:10.460, Speaker B: It is a. I mean, this second condition is the relevant one. And the first condition says that it is not trivial. So there is some superstructure of m, which is a model of T, and any such superstructure is a sigma one elementary superstructure. Okay, so are you hearing? Well, everything is fine because I have.
00:12:10.492 - 00:12:15.744, Speaker D: No, no other way to know if everything is fine.
00:12:17.164 - 00:12:17.548, Speaker A: So.
00:12:17.596 - 00:12:19.944, Speaker B: And now the observation.
00:12:23.644 - 00:12:24.948, Speaker D: Which is at.
00:12:24.996 - 00:12:27.646, Speaker B: First time a bit surprising, is that.
00:12:27.780 - 00:12:39.134, Speaker D: M is t e c if and only if m is t for all tau ec.
00:12:39.474 - 00:12:43.810, Speaker B: So it does not depend really on the theory t. It depends just on.
00:12:43.842 - 00:12:46.770, Speaker D: The universal fragment of T. And why.
00:12:46.802 - 00:13:10.192, Speaker B: Is the case where you take m, you get the superstructure, which is a model. You get n, which models, sorry, let me put it here. T for all tau. And you want to show that it's sigma one elementary. Well, since t for all tau is the same universal fragment of t, you can get by the previous fact, you.
00:13:10.208 - 00:13:13.524, Speaker D: Can get the p, which models t.
00:13:13.824 - 00:13:51.976, Speaker B: And is the superstructure of n, because t and t for all tau are, have the same universal fragment. And now you apply the definition. And here you get sigma one elementarity, which means that if you have a sigma one formula with parameters in M, which is true in n, well, the witness in n remains a witness in p of the truth of the quantifier free formula. And now you use the sigma one reflection to get that. The witness can be found in Microsoft.
00:13:52.110 - 00:13:52.944, Speaker A: Okay.
00:13:54.124 - 00:13:58.264, Speaker D: And this is sigma one. Okay.
00:14:00.324 - 00:14:04.956, Speaker B: So you see, the notion of t existentially closed depend only on the.
00:14:04.980 - 00:14:06.824, Speaker D: Universal fragment of T.
00:14:17.984 - 00:14:18.632, Speaker A: Okay.
00:14:18.728 - 00:14:21.844, Speaker B: And another observation is the following.
00:14:23.784 - 00:14:43.708, Speaker D: Suppose M is Tec and n is a substructure of m such that n.
00:14:43.836 - 00:14:49.384, Speaker E: Models t. Then for any.
00:14:51.484 - 00:14:53.156, Speaker B: Universal sentence.
00:14:53.260 - 00:15:00.644, Speaker D: Universal tau sentence, we get that c.
00:15:00.804 - 00:15:27.302, Speaker B: We get that M models C if and only if n models c. So you get that when you have a model which is existentially closed and you build a superstructure which is a model of t, well, the fact that it's sigma one elementary grants that you are not changing the PI one theory. You cannot make a universal sentence through in M, false. In some superstructure of M, which is.
00:15:27.318 - 00:15:31.154, Speaker E: A model of t, does the converse solves.
00:15:35.334 - 00:15:37.680, Speaker B: So what I mean by the converse?
00:15:37.822 - 00:15:38.664, Speaker D: Suppose.
00:15:40.804 - 00:15:47.036, Speaker E: N models T and M is.
00:15:47.060 - 00:15:49.956, Speaker B: A substructure is a superstructure of n.
00:15:50.100 - 00:16:06.644, Speaker D: Such that M is tec. Does M and n agree on universal sentence?
00:16:11.424 - 00:16:12.088, Speaker A: Okay.
00:16:12.176 - 00:16:20.160, Speaker B: And the answer is no. You take as n, you take the.
00:16:20.312 - 00:16:25.184, Speaker D: Rational with plus times zero one, and.
00:16:25.224 - 00:16:41.270, Speaker B: You take as m, you take the complex number with plus times zero and one. And what happens is that you have that this is a substructure and you have that this is existentially closed for the theory of fields.
00:16:41.382 - 00:16:45.870, Speaker E: So here you get fields and you.
00:16:45.902 - 00:17:05.076, Speaker B: Get M. Is fields existentially closed? Because in this case, one can check that the notion of existentially closed for the theory of fields overlaps with the notion of algebraically closed field. But here you have that there is the square root of minus one, which.
00:17:05.100 - 00:17:17.024, Speaker D: Is, you get that this is true, and here you get that this is false.
00:17:23.204 - 00:17:43.504, Speaker B: So it's not the case that the two, that if you start from a model of some theory and you build a superstructure which is t existentially closed for the model, for the theory, the superstructure, agree with the model on the existential, on the universal or existential sentences.
00:17:43.924 - 00:17:44.784, Speaker A: Okay.
00:17:47.404 - 00:18:13.160, Speaker B: And, well, essentially, this is the peculiar difference between the state of affair for set theory and the state of affair for field theory. So in set theory, essentially, the examples that I found of existentially closed models for set theory are always preserving the sigma one. I mean, the universal fragment of the.
00:18:13.192 - 00:18:20.824, Speaker D: Model of set theory one starts with to build. Okay, so this is where I found.
00:18:20.864 - 00:18:26.982, Speaker B: The discrepancy between the standard presentation of model companionship, which I'm going to give.
00:18:27.038 - 00:18:30.726, Speaker D: Right away, and the setup inside theory.
00:18:30.910 - 00:18:39.234, Speaker B: There is this non symmetry. Okay, is everything clear so far? I continue.
00:18:42.014 - 00:18:42.794, Speaker A: Yep.
00:18:44.334 - 00:18:45.594, Speaker C: Yeah, very good.
00:18:46.414 - 00:18:52.726, Speaker B: Okay, so we have that the, we need another notion.
00:18:52.830 - 00:19:02.702, Speaker D: Well, let's say notation, which is tau for all val exists. This is equal to the c such.
00:19:02.758 - 00:19:07.382, Speaker B: That T models C. And C is.
00:19:07.558 - 00:19:14.874, Speaker D: The Boolean combination of universal sentences.
00:19:17.274 - 00:19:17.898, Speaker A: Okay.
00:19:17.986 - 00:19:55.188, Speaker B: And I use this notation, I don't know, I invented it because I didn't find it in the standard textbooks. Because essentially, if one thinks a moment, one gets that Boolean combination of universal sentences are essentially of two types, either a universal sentence conjunction, an existential sentence, or a universal sentence disjunction, an existential sentence. And the interesting case is when you have a disjunction, because that, I mean, the conjunction is more informative, the disjunction is less informative.
00:19:55.356 - 00:19:55.780, Speaker A: Okay.
00:19:55.812 - 00:20:04.876, Speaker B: So it's important to keep track of the disjunctions that are in the universal fragment rather than of the conjunctions.
00:20:04.940 - 00:20:09.064, Speaker D: But that's why I put the bell instead of the wedge.
00:20:09.844 - 00:20:18.224, Speaker B: And now the key definition which brings to the notion of absolute model relationship is the following.
00:20:19.804 - 00:20:30.268, Speaker D: Let t be tau theory. Well, well, I come back, okay.
00:20:30.356 - 00:20:34.344, Speaker B: And see the Tao sentence.
00:20:36.724 - 00:20:37.404, Speaker A: Okay.
00:20:37.484 - 00:20:40.824, Speaker B: And we say that c is strongly.
00:20:43.024 - 00:21:02.800, Speaker D: T consistent. If for all r, which extends t, we have that c plus r. Tau.
00:21:02.912 - 00:21:14.460, Speaker B: For all, well, exist is consistent. So C is not only consistent with t, but essentially, you take a model.
00:21:14.492 - 00:21:17.476, Speaker D: Of t, and then you can expand.
00:21:17.540 - 00:21:48.894, Speaker B: This model to become a model of the universal fragment of the theory of the model you started with and C. That's what this definition says. So it's not only consistent with t, you take any completion of t and C is consistent. Well, maybe the, the completion has the negation of C among its truths, but this can occur only if C is quite complicated, not if C is a universal or a Boolean combination of universal sentences.
00:21:49.054 - 00:21:51.694, Speaker D: In that case, C has to be consistent.
00:21:51.854 - 00:22:13.984, Speaker B: And in general, if you have a complicated formula and we will focus on PI, two sentences, we will have that. A pie two sentence is strongly consistent, essentially, if you can realize it in some, in, I mean, in some structure, which is, which satisfies exactly the same universal sentences that are realized in some.
00:22:14.024 - 00:22:17.720, Speaker D: Model of T. Okay, so is this definition clear?
00:22:17.832 - 00:22:21.524, Speaker B: Because that's the essentially a key definition of this talk.
00:22:26.864 - 00:22:27.764, Speaker A: Okay.
00:22:28.104 - 00:22:37.484, Speaker B: And here is the first, another basic fact about strongly t consistent PI two sentences.
00:22:40.344 - 00:22:41.084, Speaker A: Fact.
00:22:42.184 - 00:22:49.284, Speaker E: Assume C is PI two sentence.
00:22:51.904 - 00:22:52.648, Speaker A: For.
00:22:52.816 - 00:22:58.184, Speaker E: Tau, which is strongly.
00:23:00.164 - 00:23:14.504, Speaker D: T consistent. Then. And let m be a tec model.
00:23:17.804 - 00:23:25.084, Speaker E: Then M models C. Okay, proof.
00:23:28.304 - 00:23:30.792, Speaker B: So what happens is we start with.
00:23:30.888 - 00:23:34.824, Speaker D: M, okay, so it's a tec model.
00:23:34.864 - 00:23:37.552, Speaker B: So the, and we get to a.
00:23:37.648 - 00:23:43.232, Speaker D: Model of n, which is a model of T. Okay?
00:23:43.368 - 00:23:50.354, Speaker B: And actually here we have sigma one elementarity. And now we let r equals the.
00:23:50.394 - 00:23:56.186, Speaker D: Theory of n and we get that.
00:23:56.290 - 00:24:19.018, Speaker B: R is also, I mean, then we get that r tau for all well exists is realized in M because here you have sigma one elementarity. So every boolean combination of universal sentences, which is true in M, is also true in m. And now we plug in the fact that c is strongly consistent.
00:24:19.106 - 00:24:26.850, Speaker D: This means that there exists p, which is the model of C plus r.
00:24:27.002 - 00:24:46.418, Speaker B: Tau for all well exist. But now we observe that this theory is exactly the, if we take, sorry, if we take off this theory, the boolean combination of universal fragment.
00:24:46.546 - 00:24:51.714, Speaker D: Well, we don't add anything with respect to this, okay?
00:24:51.754 - 00:25:01.082, Speaker B: Because this was already complete. In essence, every PI sentence or boolean combination of PI one sentence is decided because the theory of n is a complete theory.
00:25:01.218 - 00:25:03.442, Speaker D: So we get that those two are.
00:25:03.458 - 00:25:11.384, Speaker B: Equal, which means by the previous factor that there is a superstructure p star.
00:25:11.724 - 00:25:14.636, Speaker D: Which is a model of C plus.
00:25:14.820 - 00:25:18.144, Speaker B: R tau for all that exists.
00:25:18.524 - 00:25:20.596, Speaker D: But this is a super theory of.
00:25:20.660 - 00:25:45.604, Speaker B: T for all, which means that M is now a sigma one elementarity. M is sigma one elementary. In P we have a PI two sentence which is true in p, we can reflect it to M because we take, so we get c is for all x x is y c x y.
00:25:45.984 - 00:25:46.924, Speaker A: We pick.
00:25:49.424 - 00:25:52.128, Speaker D: A belonging to M. Then.
00:25:52.216 - 00:26:20.514, Speaker B: We get that p star models x is ycay. And then we get that m models x is ycay. Because we have sigma one elementarity. Since we can do this for every element in M, we get the reflection. Okay, so we see that every PI two sentence which is strongly t consistent is going to be realized in the t existentially closed models.
00:26:22.054 - 00:26:22.954, Speaker A: Okay.
00:26:24.894 - 00:26:28.730, Speaker D: Is this clear? This part, can I move on or.
00:26:28.762 - 00:26:30.014, Speaker B: There are questions.
00:26:43.434 - 00:26:44.334, Speaker A: Okay.
00:26:46.554 - 00:26:49.294, Speaker B: So the question is a question.
00:26:54.774 - 00:26:57.994, Speaker E: Are the tec.
00:26:59.974 - 00:27:01.194, Speaker D: Tau models.
00:27:04.134 - 00:27:05.394, Speaker B: Axiomatized.
00:27:09.774 - 00:27:10.134, Speaker A: By.
00:27:10.174 - 00:27:13.074, Speaker E: The strongly.
00:27:16.614 - 00:27:18.074, Speaker B: T consistent.
00:27:20.834 - 00:27:31.014, Speaker D: By two sentences? Okay, and.
00:27:33.274 - 00:27:35.414, Speaker B: Again, the answer is no.
00:27:39.954 - 00:27:42.134, Speaker D: No, counterexample.
00:27:43.714 - 00:28:00.084, Speaker B: Again, the counterexample is always the same rational against, against algebraically closed fields. So we take as c, we get x is tax, x times x plus one equals zero.
00:28:00.424 - 00:28:07.256, Speaker E: This is c is not strongly fields.
00:28:07.320 - 00:28:12.564, Speaker B: Consistent because it fails in the rationals.
00:28:14.524 - 00:28:15.264, Speaker D: But.
00:28:17.204 - 00:28:55.204, Speaker B: ACF models c C is true in every algebraically closed fields, and one can check that algebraically closed fields are exactly the existentially closed models for the theory of fields. Okay, so here is the, where we start from, to depart from the standard theory of model companionship. So let me now define model companionship.
00:28:55.864 - 00:29:02.004, Speaker D: So let ts be tau theories.
00:29:08.044 - 00:29:12.468, Speaker B: So T is the model companion of.
00:29:12.516 - 00:29:13.104, Speaker D: S.
00:29:20.324 - 00:29:21.064, Speaker A: If.
00:29:23.004 - 00:29:27.812, Speaker D: One tau for all is equal to s tau for all.
00:29:27.868 - 00:29:51.004, Speaker B: So I'm just working with the universal sentence. T is model complete. I have not defined this notion, and I'm now giving a definition. T is model complete means t. For me, this is the definition I give. It's not the standard one, but it's axiomatized by the.
00:29:55.144 - 00:29:57.084, Speaker D: T for all ec.
00:29:57.424 - 00:30:00.644, Speaker B: By the PI two sentences.
00:30:03.424 - 00:30:12.204, Speaker E: Through in the t for all EC models.
00:30:15.024 - 00:30:17.560, Speaker B: Or actually, it's the same t for.
00:30:17.592 - 00:30:23.736, Speaker D: All well exist EC models. Okay, it can be checked that in.
00:30:23.760 - 00:30:27.870, Speaker B: This specific case, we can, or equivalently.
00:30:27.982 - 00:30:29.714, Speaker D: TEC models.
00:30:32.694 - 00:30:45.806, Speaker B: Because the universal fragment of these three theories are the same. The universal fragment of t is the same as the universal fragment of t for all exists and is the same as the universal fragment.
00:30:45.950 - 00:30:46.754, Speaker A: Okay.
00:30:49.734 - 00:30:53.954, Speaker B: So this is the notion of modern companionship. And standard example.
00:30:57.434 - 00:31:00.054, Speaker D: Algebraically closed fields are.
00:31:01.234 - 00:31:03.934, Speaker B: Is the model companion.
00:31:09.474 - 00:31:10.694, Speaker A: Of fields.
00:31:12.634 - 00:31:29.192, Speaker B: They satisfy exactly the same universal sentences. They do not satisfy the same existential sentences. So there is a, the square root of minus one is a witness of an existential sentence, which is true in an algebraically closed field, but not in.
00:31:29.208 - 00:31:31.696, Speaker E: The rational, which is a field.
00:31:31.880 - 00:31:38.104, Speaker A: Okay. Okay.
00:31:38.144 - 00:31:40.884, Speaker B: And now I want to tweak a bit this definition.
00:31:45.304 - 00:31:46.044, Speaker A: And.
00:31:51.714 - 00:31:52.694, Speaker D: Okay.
00:32:00.634 - 00:32:04.454, Speaker B: And I get the definition of absolute model companion.
00:32:05.674 - 00:32:19.810, Speaker D: Let ts be tau theories. T is the AMC of S. So.
00:32:19.842 - 00:32:23.474, Speaker B: Let me use this abbreviation, which means absolute model companion.
00:32:23.554 - 00:32:29.394, Speaker D: If one t for all val, x.
00:32:29.434 - 00:32:31.810, Speaker B: Is tau is equal to s, for.
00:32:31.842 - 00:32:55.314, Speaker D: All val exist tau, and two t is model complete. Okay, so, and now you see, for example, ACF is not the amc of fields.
00:32:58.694 - 00:32:59.222, Speaker A: Why?
00:32:59.318 - 00:33:27.314, Speaker B: Because the sentence exists. X x squared plus one equals one is an axiom of ACF, actually in the universal, in the Boolean combination of universal sentence axiom of ACF, but it's not an axiom of the theory of fields because it fails in the rationals. Okay, so this equality is false. This second part is, okay, but this.
00:33:27.354 - 00:33:32.034, Speaker D: First part is false. Okay, and what happens is that for.
00:33:32.074 - 00:33:45.762, Speaker B: What I'm aware of, in set theory, we have plenty of model companionship result for set theory, but those modern companionship results are of this type, not of the weaker type with for all in.
00:33:45.778 - 00:33:47.254, Speaker D: The place of this.
00:33:47.834 - 00:33:51.774, Speaker B: Okay, so this is why I get to this definition.
00:33:52.114 - 00:33:52.730, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:52.842 - 00:33:53.826, Speaker B: One quick question.
00:33:53.930 - 00:33:57.434, Speaker D: Is point one strictly stronger than just.
00:33:57.474 - 00:34:00.930, Speaker B: Saying that the existential and the universal.
00:34:00.962 - 00:34:03.254, Speaker D: Part are the same? Yes.
00:34:04.214 - 00:34:19.074, Speaker B: Okay, so not just the universal sentences, but also the Boolean combination of universal sentences. So the existential sentences are the same, and also the disjunction of a universal and existential are the same.
00:34:19.694 - 00:34:21.114, Speaker A: Okay, thanks.
00:34:23.054 - 00:34:23.794, Speaker D: Continue.
00:34:24.734 - 00:34:25.874, Speaker C: One more question.
00:34:26.254 - 00:34:26.798, Speaker D: Yes.
00:34:26.886 - 00:34:30.794, Speaker C: Can you say what the usual definition of model complete is?
00:34:31.184 - 00:34:31.964, Speaker D: Yes.
00:34:33.744 - 00:34:37.084, Speaker B: T is model complete. There are many definitions.
00:34:40.424 - 00:34:42.404, Speaker D: If for all.
00:34:44.144 - 00:34:47.168, Speaker B: M substructure of n.
00:34:47.256 - 00:34:50.480, Speaker D: Which are both models of t, we.
00:34:50.512 - 00:34:55.376, Speaker B: Get that m is elementary in.
00:34:55.400 - 00:34:56.232, Speaker A: Nice.
00:34:56.238 - 00:35:02.092, Speaker B: So this is the standard definition. And here you can put elementary or sigma one.
00:35:02.188 - 00:35:03.224, Speaker D: It's the same.
00:35:04.524 - 00:35:05.584, Speaker C: Okay, thanks.
00:35:06.804 - 00:35:07.404, Speaker D: Okay.
00:35:07.484 - 00:35:09.020, Speaker B: And another definition.
00:35:09.172 - 00:35:12.716, Speaker D: Well, no, I will come back to that later on.
00:35:12.900 - 00:35:13.500, Speaker A: Okay.
00:35:13.572 - 00:35:15.304, Speaker D: Okay, I move on.
00:35:17.284 - 00:35:17.804, Speaker A: Okay.
00:35:17.844 - 00:35:40.614, Speaker B: And. Okay, so you see, we have this equality which replaced the quality for all. And this suggests that there should be some counterpart on the semantic side. So what does this amount to, this equality amount to, say, at the level of biomedability of models of t, with models of s. And this is the equivalent proposition.
00:35:42.794 - 00:35:47.174, Speaker D: Let t's be tau theories.
00:35:51.414 - 00:35:53.354, Speaker B: The following are equivalent.
00:35:54.294 - 00:36:00.270, Speaker E: One, tau for all val exists is.
00:36:00.302 - 00:36:02.622, Speaker B: Equal to s. Tau for all val.
00:36:02.678 - 00:36:08.034, Speaker D: Exists, and two for all.
00:36:08.414 - 00:36:10.394, Speaker B: Sorry. Inclusion.
00:36:10.734 - 00:36:11.246, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:36:11.310 - 00:36:23.238, Speaker B: For all m, which is a model of t, there exists an n, which is a substructure of m, and n is a model of s and m.
00:36:23.406 - 00:36:29.234, Speaker E: And agree on universal sentences.
00:36:30.294 - 00:36:50.060, Speaker B: So you are in the setup where you cannot. When you build the superstructure of m, which is a model of s, you are not forced to make false some universal sentence that was true in m. You can do the model of s while preserving all the universal sentences that.
00:36:50.092 - 00:36:52.956, Speaker E: Were true in m. So that's the.
00:36:53.100 - 00:36:58.144, Speaker D: Equivalent of this syntactic property.
00:37:00.004 - 00:37:00.904, Speaker A: Okay.
00:37:05.324 - 00:37:06.424, Speaker D: I move on.
00:37:11.384 - 00:37:15.964, Speaker B: How much time am I supposed to have? 1 hour or.
00:37:20.784 - 00:37:24.404, Speaker C: I'm actually not sure. Let me check and get back to you.
00:37:25.024 - 00:37:25.924, Speaker A: Okay.
00:37:28.864 - 00:37:29.456, Speaker D: Okay.
00:37:29.520 - 00:37:43.114, Speaker B: And let me just give an example of example of AMc. So we take the theory s is the theory of z.
00:37:45.574 - 00:37:46.670, Speaker D: With the order.
00:37:46.822 - 00:37:59.558, Speaker B: And t is the theory of rationals with the orders. Those theories are complete. And it's easy to see that z embeds into.
00:37:59.726 - 00:38:04.830, Speaker D: Sorry. That a model of s embeds into.
00:38:04.862 - 00:38:10.390, Speaker B: A model of t, which embeds into.
00:38:10.542 - 00:38:15.674, Speaker E: A model of s. Sorry.
00:38:16.814 - 00:38:18.382, Speaker D: And so on, so forth.
00:38:18.438 - 00:39:03.330, Speaker B: What you do, you have a model of s, so it's a discrete linear order. You blow every point to q and you get the model of t, and here you have a dense linear order, and you blow every point to a copy of z, and you get a model of s. And in this way, you pass from one to the other. And since you are considering complete theories, you are not changing the universal sentences that are true in those models. They are always the same. But you get that this theory admits quantifier elimination. And then the standard definition of model completeness is satisfying, because if both are.
00:39:03.402 - 00:39:06.082, Speaker D: Models of t, well, if you have.
00:39:06.098 - 00:39:22.294, Speaker B: A substructure relation, since you have quantifier elimination, this amounts to say elementary substructure relation. So this is model complete. Those two theories agree on the boolean combination of universal sentences. So this is the absolute model companion of this.
00:39:24.354 - 00:39:25.254, Speaker A: Okay.
00:39:28.334 - 00:39:32.554, Speaker B: And now we will. Later on, we will see many examples from said theory.
00:39:35.734 - 00:39:40.926, Speaker C: So, Mateo, you probably can't see the chat, but you have another 45 minutes.
00:39:41.110 - 00:39:45.310, Speaker B: Okay, perfect. Then I will be on track to.
00:39:45.422 - 00:39:47.514, Speaker D: Say everything I wanted to say.
00:39:50.254 - 00:39:50.846, Speaker A: Okay.
00:39:50.910 - 00:39:57.594, Speaker B: And here is the characterization that brings my attention to this notion of AMC.
00:39:58.284 - 00:40:02.264, Speaker D: Let t's be tau theories.
00:40:04.724 - 00:40:07.424, Speaker B: And the following are equivalent.
00:40:09.044 - 00:40:25.560, Speaker D: One, t is the AMc of s, and two, t is axiomatized by PI.
00:40:25.592 - 00:40:26.684, Speaker B: Two sentences.
00:40:30.184 - 00:40:30.924, Speaker A: Which.
00:40:32.904 - 00:40:45.364, Speaker D: Are strongly as consistent and is model complete.
00:40:49.844 - 00:41:12.744, Speaker B: Okay, so the strongly as consistent PI two sentence give the axiomatization of the absolute model companion of s when it exists. The point is that the existence of absolute model companion or of a model companion is an absolutely non trivial property. So, in general, you should not expect that the theory has it.
00:41:18.104 - 00:41:27.284, Speaker C: Okay, so this axiomization condition, this is a replacement of the first part of the definition of AMC.
00:41:27.704 - 00:41:29.884, Speaker D: Yes, yes, exactly.
00:41:30.584 - 00:41:39.364, Speaker B: So. Well, actually, it's a replacement of. I mean, one definition is. You see, that's the other definition.
00:41:41.804 - 00:41:45.264, Speaker D: Sorry. Here.
00:41:46.604 - 00:42:30.064, Speaker B: Okay, so two is reinforcing. So, two, in the case of model companionship, you just have the request that you have model completeness. And essentially, the point is, we know that these PI two sentences are true in the existentially closed models, but are there some other sentences which are true in the existentially closed models and are not strongly as consistent? This is what happens in the case of algebraically closed fields versus fields. And this, too is saying, no, you are capturing everything.
00:42:31.864 - 00:42:33.444, Speaker C: Okay, thanks.
00:42:40.264 - 00:42:40.808, Speaker A: Okay.
00:42:40.856 - 00:43:14.556, Speaker B: And now comes the second model, theoretic ingredient of this analysis of, I mean, to analyze a theory which is the partial modelization. So what is the problem with the model companionship? The problem with modern companionship is that it is very sensitive to the signature. You can have the same theory. You axiomatized it using a signature. It has a model companion. You axiomatize it using another signature. It does not have a model companion.
00:43:14.620 - 00:43:15.864, Speaker E: In the new signature.
00:43:16.644 - 00:43:33.294, Speaker B: This is in contrast with the standard tameness properties. For example, stability of a theory. T is independent of the axon system. You choose to formalize t. The same for the not independence property, the same for a minimality.
00:43:33.954 - 00:43:34.814, Speaker A: Okay.
00:43:37.314 - 00:43:50.474, Speaker B: So let me start with the, with the problem we have. Okay, so let tau be the signature for fields.
00:43:50.554 - 00:43:58.726, Speaker D: So plus time zero one, the t be algebraically closed fields and Sb fields.
00:43:58.910 - 00:44:01.914, Speaker B: Sorry. Sb commutative rings.
00:44:02.254 - 00:44:02.766, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:44:02.830 - 00:44:08.554, Speaker B: So it's easier for me to build a conflict sample with no zero divisors.
00:44:13.694 - 00:44:14.502, Speaker A: Okay?
00:44:14.638 - 00:44:17.606, Speaker D: And now we consider C, which is.
00:44:17.630 - 00:44:24.030, Speaker B: A model of t, and then it is a substructure according to tau of.
00:44:24.182 - 00:44:31.438, Speaker D: Cx, which is a model of s. Okay?
00:44:31.606 - 00:44:48.382, Speaker B: And actually, you get that it's sigma one elementary. So if you take a polynomial here, where the coefficients are really complex numbers, then the solution of the polymonomial that you find here, you already found in.
00:44:48.398 - 00:44:49.634, Speaker D: The complex number number.
00:44:51.694 - 00:44:52.150, Speaker A: Okay?
00:44:52.182 - 00:45:16.114, Speaker B: So that's what sigma one elementary amounts to say, essentially. But now we do some complications. So what we do, we pass to tau prime, which is plus times zero one, and we add the multiplicative inverse.
00:45:16.714 - 00:45:17.426, Speaker A: Okay?
00:45:17.530 - 00:45:37.554, Speaker B: And now we have to interpret the multiplicative inverse. Well, here we know what to do. We take the multiplicative inverse. Here we have a problem, because not all polynomials have an inverse, essentially just when they are constant polynomials. But we have a very easy solution. So we add this axiom. So we get the axiom that says.
00:45:37.634 - 00:45:40.530, Speaker D: For all x, if there exists a.
00:45:40.562 - 00:45:44.066, Speaker B: Y such that x times y equals.
00:45:44.170 - 00:45:45.874, Speaker D: One, then.
00:45:47.734 - 00:45:53.874, Speaker B: We get that x times x minus one equals one.
00:45:55.254 - 00:45:59.494, Speaker D: Or there is no y such that.
00:45:59.614 - 00:46:07.914, Speaker B: X times y equals one, in which case x minus one is zero.
00:46:08.574 - 00:46:09.470, Speaker A: Okay?
00:46:09.622 - 00:46:42.014, Speaker B: And what happens is that this axiom serves the purpose of defining the multiplicative inverse as we want, here and here. So here it's really, this axiom is satisfied, and the interpretation is the multiplicative inverse. And here this axiom is satisfied. Whenever you take a complex number, the inverse is the complex inverse. But when you take a polynomial, which is of degree bigger than zero, then the inverse is the zero polynomial.
00:46:42.594 - 00:46:43.266, Speaker D: Okay?
00:46:43.370 - 00:47:00.490, Speaker B: So what happens is that here you get that tau prime is also true. So with respect to this expanded signature. So now we have also the minus one symbol. The tau prime substructure relation holds true. But this is false, because here you.
00:47:00.522 - 00:47:08.250, Speaker D: Get x is x x one equals.
00:47:08.322 - 00:47:11.534, Speaker B: Zero and x is not zero.
00:47:12.394 - 00:47:15.534, Speaker D: And here we get the converse.
00:47:20.074 - 00:47:35.994, Speaker B: Okay, so we get the sigma one sentence, which is true in this bigger structure and does not reflect here. Okay, so we changed the signature. And with the old signature, everything was fine. The algebraically closed field where the sigma.
00:47:36.074 - 00:47:39.180, Speaker D: The existentially closed models of the theory.
00:47:39.212 - 00:48:07.416, Speaker B: Of fields, we expanded the signature. And the algebraically closed fields are not anymore. The existentially closed models of the theory of commuting, well, they were also. The point is that the algebraically closed fields were also the existentially closed models for the theory of commutative rings with not zero divisors. I mean, we should be easily aware of this factory. But we expanded the signature. We had a symbol for multiplicative inverse.
00:48:07.416 - 00:48:12.444, Speaker B: We maintained the substructure relation. We described the sigma one elementary relation.
00:48:13.024 - 00:48:15.768, Speaker D: Okay, so what it says, this result.
00:48:15.856 - 00:49:02.534, Speaker B: Is that if we consider this theory in this signature and this theory in this signature, then we get that this is the model companion of this. Then we consider this theory in this signature, this theory in this signature, and this is not anymore the model companion of this. Okay, so we changed the signature, and we broke the model companionship relation between the theories. So what we do is, okay, so let's attach to a theory the signatures for which it admits a model companion. Okay, and to do this, we proceed as follows.
00:49:12.154 - 00:49:18.494, Speaker D: So we have a signature and we take phi x.
00:49:19.514 - 00:49:22.134, Speaker B: So is this counter example clear?
00:49:26.354 - 00:49:27.134, Speaker D: Yes.
00:49:32.394 - 00:49:35.786, Speaker B: So we have phi x and c.
00:49:35.970 - 00:49:40.134, Speaker D: X y tau formula.
00:49:41.394 - 00:49:57.682, Speaker B: And we consider two types of axiom. The first type of axiom is saying, okay, I'm considering this formula phi x as a, um, quantifier free formula. How do I do this? Well, you can imagine we do this.
00:49:57.858 - 00:50:03.974, Speaker D: Tx is equivalent to rtx.
00:50:05.594 - 00:50:35.610, Speaker B: Okay, so we add in tau union rf. So we add a relation symbol of the collectarity. And we predicate that whenever we have the formula phi true, we also have the atomic formula r phi true. And then we also do partial columnization. And this is what we use the formula C for. So what we do is for all.
00:50:35.722 - 00:50:45.244, Speaker D: X if there exists just one y such that cxy.
00:50:49.184 - 00:50:52.324, Speaker B: And then we say that.
00:50:54.184 - 00:50:59.724, Speaker D: F c of x equals y.
00:51:01.144 - 00:51:04.680, Speaker E: Or it's not the case that there.
00:51:04.712 - 00:51:12.220, Speaker B: Exists one y such that cx y, in which case we set that fc.
00:51:12.292 - 00:51:21.988, Speaker D: Of x is some constant c tau. And this is insignia tau union r.
00:51:22.116 - 00:51:50.734, Speaker B: Sorry, f f c and c tau. So essentially, the problem is tau may not have constant symbols. So we add one constant symbol, which we use for the trash value. So when we don't have a unique witness, and then we use the existence of a unique witness to define the function symbol. And if there is no unique witness, then we let the function symbol be evaluated trivially.
00:51:51.394 - 00:51:54.930, Speaker D: Okay, so this is exactly, so this.
00:51:54.962 - 00:52:24.768, Speaker B: Is what we did when we expanded the signature with the multiplicative inverse. So the multiplicative inverse is unique. So in case we have a unique multiplicative inverse, we are in this situation and we let the interpretation of the function symbol be the multiplicative inverse. Or if there is no multiplicative inverse, or there are possibly more than one, which is not the case in this situation, then we let the multiplicative inverse be interpreted by zero.
00:52:24.936 - 00:52:27.704, Speaker D: Okay, so this is what we applied.
00:52:27.784 - 00:52:30.200, Speaker B: In the case of, in the example.
00:52:30.232 - 00:52:33.084, Speaker D: Of the previous slide of the previous page.
00:52:36.964 - 00:52:40.744, Speaker E: Okay, is this clear?
00:52:46.764 - 00:53:19.998, Speaker B: So the standard modelization process that one finds in the courses is you add the relation symbol for all formula. And I am slightly more liberal because it's convenient. I add also function symbols, but I'm very picky. I want just one witness. This condition is important because otherwise the interpretation of the function symbol appeals to the axiom of choice. If we just know that there is a witness, but if there are too many witnesses in too many occasions, then I have to use the axiom of choice to interpret this function symbol.
00:53:20.046 - 00:53:23.662, Speaker D: And I don't want, because the point.
00:53:23.718 - 00:54:12.334, Speaker B: Is that with this stuff, if I have a model of, if I have a tau structure, I have a unique possibility to extend this tau structure in order to become an axioms of to become a structure which realizes those axioms. Okay, there is no chances I have freedom just to interpret this constant symbol. But once the constant symbol is interpreted, those axioms tells me how all the other symbols must be interpreted. While if this condition is dropped, then I may have many different interpretation of this column function, which are compatible with the fact that it's a column symbol for the formula.
00:54:15.554 - 00:54:52.204, Speaker D: Okay, so, fact, if m is a tau structure, there exists just and c belongs to m. There exists a unique expansion of m to tau union fcrv such that.
00:54:55.664 - 00:54:58.424, Speaker B: Expansion n such that n.
00:54:58.504 - 00:55:05.136, Speaker D: Models x zero phi plus x one.
00:55:05.240 - 00:55:12.592, Speaker B: C plus c is interpreted plus n.
00:55:12.688 - 00:55:17.136, Speaker D: Models c c tau equals c. Okay.
00:55:17.280 - 00:55:23.264, Speaker B: So the unique freedom I have is to decide what is the value of this constant. But once I decide the value, then.
00:55:23.304 - 00:55:24.712, Speaker D: The rest is fixed.
00:55:24.888 - 00:55:27.936, Speaker B: So this allow me to define unambiguously.
00:55:28.000 - 00:55:49.106, Speaker D: The for a contained in formula of tau times two, let tau a equal x ic such that ci belongs to a.
00:55:49.250 - 00:55:54.818, Speaker B: And this is giving me a partial modularization of a theory.
00:55:54.986 - 00:55:59.854, Speaker D: So t plus theta is the partial.
00:56:01.554 - 00:56:08.824, Speaker E: Modalization of t induced by a.
00:56:12.004 - 00:56:12.764, Speaker D: Is this.
00:56:12.884 - 00:56:14.244, Speaker B: Is everything okay?
00:56:14.364 - 00:56:15.984, Speaker D: I just turned on the back.
00:56:18.484 - 00:56:22.064, Speaker C: Yes. I assume you'll tell us that this is good for something.
00:56:24.604 - 00:56:25.344, Speaker A: What?
00:56:25.844 - 00:56:32.176, Speaker C: I assume you'll tell us that this is good for something. This is useful.
00:56:32.360 - 00:56:48.004, Speaker B: Yes, yes, I'm going to very soon, you will see it's very useful. Sorry, for the moment, it's just loading a lot of information on you, and you don't see where I'm heading, where I'm heading, but I will soon come to the point.
00:56:54.024 - 00:57:18.554, Speaker D: Okay, so let me just say standard modulation is of t is t plus tau a for a equal form tau times zero.
00:57:19.294 - 00:57:25.454, Speaker B: This is what one learns in order to eliminate quantifiers and maintain the theory.
00:57:26.314 - 00:57:30.378, Speaker D: Okay, and now here is the invariant.
00:57:30.466 - 00:57:33.134, Speaker B: That I'm attaching to a theory. Definition.
00:57:33.954 - 00:57:49.018, Speaker D: Let t be the tau theory, and we let the spec Amc of t.
00:57:49.186 - 00:57:52.754, Speaker B: Is equal to a contained in form.
00:57:52.834 - 00:58:05.204, Speaker D: Tau times two, such that t plus tau a has an absolute model companion.
00:58:06.144 - 00:58:10.080, Speaker B: And they can define accordingly spec Mc.
00:58:10.192 - 00:58:11.204, Speaker D: Of T.
00:58:13.744 - 00:58:17.520, Speaker E: Okay, so the idea is how.
00:58:17.592 - 00:58:45.954, Speaker B: How am I going to detect the property of a theory? Well, I look at the subset of the formula for which, when I'm declaring that those concepts are simple, so I equate them to atomic formula or to column functions, then I'm making the theory simple in the sense that it admits a model companion or an absolute model companion.
00:58:46.734 - 00:58:51.804, Speaker D: Okay, so this is a complicated invariant.
00:58:51.844 - 00:59:33.064, Speaker B: Because potentially you get two to the left zero many sub. I mean, if you have a countable theory, then you get, possibly you are attaching a subset of the real. Sorry? Yes, a subset of the real. You can have possibly two to the LF zero many a in the spectrum. Okay, but the point is that when you detect that an a is in the spectrum, you are getting important information on the theory. Essentially, the idea is that when you get the DNA in the spectrum, you are detecting concepts which are central for the theory. The formula that RNA are detecting fundamental concepts of the theory.
00:59:33.064 - 01:00:17.982, Speaker B: And I will show you soon examples. So, for the moment, what happens is that I can show that this invariant is useful when t is set theory. I don't know if this invariant is useful in other contexts, but I suspect that it should be. I mean, it's just more complicated to handle that simplicity need for something. But the point is that it's an invariant, that it's meaningful for an arbitrary theory. So you don't have to first show that the theory is simple and then simple in the sense of simplicity, tameness, or whatever, stability. And then you can analyze the theory.
01:00:17.982 - 01:00:30.478, Speaker B: Once you know that, that it has a nice tameness property. This stuff can be done for any theory in particular. Accordingly, to model theorists said theory is not tame.
01:00:30.526 - 01:00:31.454, Speaker D: It's very bad.
01:00:31.574 - 01:00:34.598, Speaker B: But this is a very useful classification tool.
01:00:34.646 - 01:00:38.674, Speaker A: Perspective. Okay.
01:00:40.614 - 01:00:44.982, Speaker B: Is it clear so far? Because now I'm going to state the.
01:00:45.118 - 01:00:53.334, Speaker D: Trm's for set theory. Okay, so for example, one can check.
01:00:53.374 - 01:01:07.754, Speaker B: That empty set belongs to the stack of model companion of fields in signature tau.
01:01:10.334 - 01:01:16.234, Speaker D: Tau equals plus times zero one, while.
01:01:16.734 - 01:01:25.214, Speaker B: One can check that stack. I'm not going to prove it, but one can check that the spec of.
01:01:25.294 - 01:01:35.890, Speaker D: AMC fields is equal to empty set. So there is nothing for tau equals.
01:01:36.042 - 01:01:39.482, Speaker E: Plus times zero one.
01:01:39.658 - 01:01:40.374, Speaker A: Right.
01:01:40.754 - 01:01:44.530, Speaker D: So here is actually here.
01:01:44.562 - 01:01:52.954, Speaker B: It's something like this. Well, no, it's not entirely correct, but essentially modulus mole perturbation. This is the unique element in the.
01:01:52.994 - 01:01:57.262, Speaker E: Spectrum of fields for model companionship.
01:01:57.318 - 01:01:58.154, Speaker D: Spectrum.
01:01:58.974 - 01:02:07.554, Speaker C: Okay, this example is illustrating some kind of fundamental difference between model theorists and set theorists or something like this.
01:02:09.854 - 01:02:10.954, Speaker B: In which way.
01:02:13.334 - 01:02:19.594, Speaker C: It seems maybe a model theorist wouldn't consider this absolute model companion, for example.
01:02:21.594 - 01:02:45.984, Speaker B: Well, I mean, there are very basic examples which are absolute model companions, but are not model. Well, the point is, I was really surprised not to find this notion of absolute model companionship in any of the standard model theory textbooks. And when I asked to model theorists if they knew this notion, nobody told me that they knew it.
01:02:46.034 - 01:02:48.264, Speaker D: So apparently it's a new notion.
01:02:51.684 - 01:02:56.864, Speaker C: Okay. The second example seems to suggest it's a question that they wouldn't ask.
01:02:57.764 - 01:03:01.544, Speaker D: Yeah, maybe. Yeah.
01:03:07.924 - 01:03:12.894, Speaker B: So now the point is AMC spectrum.
01:03:14.794 - 01:03:16.134, Speaker D: Of set theory.
01:03:20.034 - 01:03:22.770, Speaker B: Okay, so the first observation is that.
01:03:22.962 - 01:03:31.734, Speaker D: Epsilon is not the right signature for set theory.
01:03:33.194 - 01:03:39.418, Speaker B: I mean, it's good for axiomatizing, but it's not good to detect the basic.
01:03:39.466 - 01:03:40.916, Speaker D: Concepts of set theory.
01:03:41.090 - 01:03:47.604, Speaker B: The basic concepts are expressed by epsilon delta zero. What is epsilon delta zero? Is.
01:03:49.504 - 01:04:05.888, Speaker D: Rv phi delta zero. Formula union g one g ten gi.
01:04:06.056 - 01:04:07.444, Speaker B: Google operation.
01:04:12.864 - 01:04:17.240, Speaker E: As in jack and you.
01:04:17.272 - 01:04:33.684, Speaker B: Also add empty set and omega. And I leave you as a very basic exercise to check that this is actually, let's say, obtained by.
01:04:37.054 - 01:04:37.794, Speaker D: By.
01:04:38.174 - 01:04:58.422, Speaker B: I mean, these are expressible, but the graph of this function are expressible by delta zero formula. And you need just a fragment of Df to prove that those are total functions with well defined. Okay, and to define empty set and omega, you can do that with the delta zero formula.
01:04:58.558 - 01:05:02.046, Speaker D: They are the unique solution of the delta zero formula.
01:05:02.230 - 01:06:00.394, Speaker B: Okay, why am I saying this consider, try to formalize xy equals z in epsilon signature. I'm not going to do this because I would take a full line and it would take me 1 minute to write down the formula. But in this signature that I'm writing here, that's it. I have a function symbol for the pair, for the order pair, and I can write this. So in epsilon signature, the standard axiomatization using Kuratovsky trick gives a sigma two formula. And then if you want to find functions using order pair or binary relation using order pair, then you grow up in complexity. So already to say that something is a function, you need something like sigma five or sigma six formula which is not right and completely unreadable.
01:06:00.394 - 01:06:10.534, Speaker B: So already writing this is unreadable. If I write the formula here, you won't recognize that it's axiomatizing that that z is the ordered curve of x and y.
01:06:14.634 - 01:06:15.534, Speaker A: Okay.
01:06:20.834 - 01:06:26.844, Speaker B: Let me add this notation. Epsilon A is equal to.
01:06:29.064 - 01:06:34.164, Speaker D: Rv fc.
01:06:34.664 - 01:06:38.480, Speaker B: Such that phi zero belongs to a.
01:06:38.632 - 01:06:46.760, Speaker D: And c one belongs to a and z fc delta zero.
01:06:46.952 - 01:06:53.292, Speaker B: Well, then one can check that epsilon delta zero is equal to epsilon A.
01:06:53.348 - 01:07:00.612, Speaker E: For some a contained in form epsilon.
01:07:00.788 - 01:07:33.376, Speaker B: Times two and zfc delta zero is equal to zfc plus t epsilon a. Okay, so we are enriching dfc with the axon that says that delta zero formulas have to be interpreted the correct way. Okay, and now what happens that, for example, ch, well, x is aleph one, is phi one.
01:07:33.520 - 01:07:39.204, Speaker D: Well, sigma one, well, is in zfc.
01:07:41.104 - 01:07:45.846, Speaker B: Well, actually ZFC Delta minus delta zero.
01:07:46.040 - 01:07:51.854, Speaker D: For all that exists in Epsilon Delta Zero.
01:07:52.154 - 01:07:52.730, Speaker A: Why?
01:07:52.842 - 01:07:55.882, Speaker B: Well, you can check, what does it mean that x is alpha one?
01:07:55.938 - 01:08:15.652, Speaker D: It means for all f. F is a function. The domain of f belongs to x, implies range of f is different from x.
01:08:15.788 - 01:08:37.424, Speaker B: So this is saying that x is a cardinal. Sorry, I have to add that x is an ordinal. So it's a linear order. Epsilon relation makes it a linear order and is transitive. And I have to add there exists an f.
01:08:41.394 - 01:08:50.402, Speaker D: Dom. F is equal to x times omega. And for all alpha belonging to x.
01:08:50.538 - 01:08:58.574, Speaker B: F, restriction to alpha times omega is a subjection.
01:09:00.834 - 01:09:02.534, Speaker D: On omega.
01:09:03.294 - 01:09:08.022, Speaker B: And you can check that this piece is delta zero.
01:09:08.198 - 01:09:13.150, Speaker D: This piece is delta zero. This piece is delta zero.
01:09:13.302 - 01:09:20.674, Speaker B: And the unique solution of this formula is the carbonyl aleph one. In any model of a sufficient fragment of gfc.
01:09:21.854 - 01:09:24.638, Speaker D: Okay, so this part is PI one.
01:09:24.766 - 01:09:28.954, Speaker B: And then this part is sigma one. So it's PI one wedge sigma one.
01:09:31.094 - 01:09:31.994, Speaker A: Okay.
01:09:33.654 - 01:09:41.510, Speaker B: And similarly, you can check that x is aleph two is by one wedge sigma one. And so you can say ch, what.
01:09:41.542 - 01:09:47.114, Speaker D: Is ch is x is x x is aleph one.
01:09:47.414 - 01:09:53.286, Speaker B: And for all, sorry, exists f dom.
01:09:53.350 - 01:09:57.614, Speaker E: F equals aleph one.
01:09:59.034 - 01:10:03.010, Speaker D: And for all r r is a.
01:10:03.042 - 01:10:07.906, Speaker B: Subset of omega implies r belongs to.
01:10:07.930 - 01:10:10.730, Speaker E: The range of l. So there is.
01:10:10.762 - 01:10:19.494, Speaker B: A subjection of al f one onto the reals. You see, this is sigma two and this is sigma two.
01:10:20.534 - 01:10:24.074, Speaker D: So ch is sigma two, not ch.
01:10:24.694 - 01:10:39.934, Speaker B: Is actually sigma two, wedge PI two. Because this piece you need in order to state that there exists f one and the second piece you have to negate. So this become PI two and this becomes sigma two.
01:10:40.054 - 01:10:42.870, Speaker D: Okay, so you see now in this.
01:10:42.902 - 01:11:07.334, Speaker B: Signature, the standard concepts gets the right complexity. And this is what we are used to essentially. We just don't care to make it explicit saying what is the signature in which we are axiomatizing them. We say that we are axiomatizing the epsilon signature, but we regard the delta zero formula and go to operation as saying basic facts.
01:11:10.074 - 01:11:22.116, Speaker D: Okay, is this clear? Okay, so let me move on and.
01:11:22.140 - 01:11:27.532, Speaker B: I can now start to state the results about set theory with this model.
01:11:27.588 - 01:11:57.074, Speaker D: Companionship. Okay, so assume tau extends epsilon delta zero and t extends GFC tau. What is it? It's GFC delta zero plus replacement for tau formula. Okay, let.
01:11:59.894 - 01:12:00.634, Speaker A: M.
01:12:02.334 - 01:12:05.264, Speaker D: Be tech.
01:12:05.634 - 01:12:08.722, Speaker B: Okay, we take a model of t's.
01:12:08.778 - 01:12:09.374, Speaker D: Of.
01:12:11.434 - 01:12:13.466, Speaker B: Which is a tau structure, which.
01:12:13.490 - 01:12:16.454, Speaker D: Is t existentially closed. Then.
01:12:19.634 - 01:12:21.666, Speaker B: Is it a strange structure?
01:12:21.730 - 01:12:27.234, Speaker D: No, it is a model of ZFC, tau minus.
01:12:27.354 - 01:12:31.494, Speaker B: So it is a model of everything except the power set axiom.
01:12:31.944 - 01:12:32.804, Speaker A: Okay?
01:12:34.984 - 01:12:44.164, Speaker D: Furthermore, assume tau contains epsilon delta, zero, union kappa.
01:12:46.784 - 01:12:47.524, Speaker A: And.
01:12:49.504 - 01:12:53.960, Speaker D: H m tau m.
01:12:54.032 - 01:12:56.288, Speaker B: By this I mean the interpretation of.
01:12:56.456 - 01:13:00.570, Speaker D: Tau in H is always a substructure.
01:13:00.602 - 01:13:06.934, Speaker B: Of m. For m, a model of Gfc.
01:13:09.034 - 01:13:36.904, Speaker D: How then for all x there exist an f dom f equals kappa wedge run f equals x belongs to. Well, is strongly.
01:13:39.924 - 01:13:49.084, Speaker B: Zfc, tau consistent. In particular, M models Z models this.
01:13:49.124 - 01:14:00.034, Speaker D: Formula, let's say C M models C. If M is Cfc, now ec.
01:14:00.734 - 01:14:59.934, Speaker B: Okay, so what happens is that what kind of theory are the existentially closed model for set theory outlining, bringing out, they are bringing out the theory of h. So if you have a constant, for example, if you have a constant for omega one, it's not hard to check that hlf two is always sigma one elementary in v. In this signature, epsilon delta zero, union constant for omega one. And then it means that if you take existentially closed model for set theory in this signature, then this existentially closed model is a model of ZFC minus plus every set as size at most lf one. So the ZFC existentially closed model, in any signature that is still expanding epsilon delta zero, are describing a theory of h for an appropriate cardinal kappa.
01:15:01.074 - 01:15:01.974, Speaker A: Okay.
01:15:03.994 - 01:15:20.594, Speaker B: So this is the first thing is when I'm looking at the existentially closed model for set theory, provided I'm going to a signature which is meaningful. So an expansion of this signature, then I'm getting the existentially closed models are.
01:15:20.634 - 01:15:24.164, Speaker D: Describing a potential theory of hyper.
01:15:26.894 - 01:15:39.994, Speaker B: Okay, and now comes the main result. Now first, is it wide of content, the AMC spectrum of the theory? No, there are many.
01:15:40.294 - 01:15:43.554, Speaker D: So let t contains Gfc.
01:15:45.534 - 01:15:48.594, Speaker B: Be an epsilon theory.
01:15:50.834 - 01:15:56.442, Speaker D: Then for any kappa such that t.
01:15:56.538 - 01:16:02.474, Speaker B: The dues exist, let's say existence, just.
01:16:02.514 - 01:16:08.930, Speaker D: One x t x. And for all x t x implies.
01:16:09.082 - 01:16:25.364, Speaker B: X is a cardinal. So kappa is a definable cardinal. So this is the meaning of this stuff. There is a unique solution of this formula. And the solution of this formula are cardinals. Then you get that there exists a.
01:16:25.404 - 01:16:30.052, Speaker D: Kappa contained in form epsilon times two.
01:16:30.188 - 01:16:33.364, Speaker B: Such that a kappa is in the.
01:16:33.404 - 01:16:39.540, Speaker D: Spectrum, actually in the AMC spectrum of.
01:16:39.652 - 01:16:47.784, Speaker B: T. And let's say the AMc of.
01:16:48.124 - 01:16:52.412, Speaker D: T with respect to this expanded signature.
01:16:52.588 - 01:16:57.564, Speaker B: As models Zfc minus plus for all.
01:16:57.644 - 01:17:09.584, Speaker D: X there exists f dom f equal kappa and ran f.
01:17:11.524 - 01:17:12.796, Speaker A: Equals x.
01:17:12.940 - 01:17:49.734, Speaker B: So we get that there are many for any definable cardinal kappa. I can cook up a signature such that the absolute model companionship of set theory with respect to that signature exists and is describing the theory of h kappa plus. So kappa could be omega one, omega two, omega three, Aleph omega, first super compact, first inaccessible. So this is saying the AMC offset theory, the spectrum with respect to absolute model companionship is very rich.
01:17:53.434 - 01:17:54.002, Speaker A: Okay.
01:17:54.058 - 01:17:58.614, Speaker B: And now the stuff about ch and for synapsiums.
01:18:00.674 - 01:18:05.854, Speaker D: The theorem assumed.
01:18:08.934 - 01:18:11.854, Speaker E: T expands.
01:18:11.934 - 01:18:25.710, Speaker D: GFC and there is epsilon theory. And a belongs to the spectrum with respect to absolute.
01:18:25.782 - 01:18:35.078, Speaker B: Here it's important that it's a spectrum with respect to the absolute model companion and not the model companion. It is such that epsilon a contains.
01:18:35.166 - 01:18:43.992, Speaker D: Epsilon delta zero and zfc plus t.
01:18:44.088 - 01:18:52.320, Speaker B: Epsilon a contains zfc delta zero. So I'm interpreting stuff correctly. Then we have the following.
01:18:52.432 - 01:18:56.484, Speaker D: If t plus not ch is consistent.
01:18:58.344 - 01:19:13.222, Speaker B: Ch cannot be in the absolute model companionship of t with respect to signature a. And second, the same applies for t plus two to the lf zero bigger.
01:19:13.318 - 01:19:16.358, Speaker D: Than Aleph two consistent.
01:19:16.446 - 01:19:20.234, Speaker B: Then two to the lf zero bigger than alf two.
01:19:26.534 - 01:19:32.142, Speaker E: Not in ancient.
01:19:32.148 - 01:19:39.946, Speaker D: Okay, consistent. Okay, well, here the sumcr, I mean.
01:19:40.090 - 01:20:04.348, Speaker B: Here it's really just the nonch, as I stated it here, I have to be more careful, but essentially it is this stuff. So what happens is you can never put in the absolute model companion of some theory which extends Dfc and has not yet committed on the value of ch. You cannot put ch in the absolute model component.
01:20:04.516 - 01:20:05.108, Speaker A: Okay?
01:20:05.196 - 01:20:13.904, Speaker B: Nor you can put two to the lf zero bigger than Aleph two. So it remains open whether you can put two to the lf zero equals Aleph two.
01:20:15.364 - 01:20:33.396, Speaker D: And this is the other theorem. Theorem. There exists a b contained in form epsilon times two, such that for all.
01:20:33.460 - 01:20:47.780, Speaker B: T extending ZFc plus there exists class. Many super compact, actually weaker assumptions are needed. Well, we have that one b belongs.
01:20:47.812 - 01:20:49.104, Speaker D: To the spectrum.
01:20:52.624 - 01:20:55.644, Speaker E: Of t two.
01:20:57.424 - 01:20:59.364, Speaker B: A definable version.
01:21:02.824 - 01:21:04.352, Speaker E: Of two to the.
01:21:04.368 - 01:21:08.056, Speaker B: Aleph zero equals Aleph two belongs to.
01:21:08.080 - 01:21:09.284, Speaker D: This spectrum.
01:21:13.064 - 01:21:14.764, Speaker B: And three.
01:21:16.484 - 01:21:18.584, Speaker D: Amc of t.
01:21:19.044 - 01:21:21.508, Speaker B: With respect to this signature given by.
01:21:21.556 - 01:21:31.864, Speaker D: B describes the theory of h al f two.
01:21:32.324 - 01:21:38.064, Speaker E: In models of mm.
01:21:40.764 - 01:21:41.524, Speaker A: Okay.
01:21:41.644 - 01:22:16.094, Speaker B: And also it's. We also have that table for all val exists, epsilon B is forcing invariant. You cannot change the universal fragment of set theories axiomatized in this signature. Using forcing, you can change the PI two sentences, but not the PI one sentence. And note that one holds for any t which extends Dfc cardinal. So, for example, you can extend t with ch. So t satisfies ch.
01:22:16.094 - 01:22:32.654, Speaker B: But in the absolute model companionship spectrum, you are getting a theory of h aleph two, which satisfies two to the Aleph zero equals Aleph two. T could satisfy two to the Aleph zero bigger than Aleph two. But in the absolute model companion spectrum.
01:22:32.694 - 01:22:34.606, Speaker D: Of this b, you will get two.
01:22:34.630 - 01:23:08.624, Speaker B: To the Aleph zero equals Aleppo. So here the result is saying, even if you have a theory which decides chain, you are forced to put two to the lf zero equals Aleph two in the spectrum of this theory, while you are not forced to do it, when the theory is not deciding ch, well, you cannot put ch nor two to the lf zero bigger than aleph two when the theory has not decided the value of the continuum.
01:23:09.784 - 01:23:10.684, Speaker A: Okay.
01:23:11.024 - 01:23:25.604, Speaker B: And I think I can stop here because, I mean, there are parts of these results that are quite trivial to prove, but I think I'm already taking much of your question, so I stop here.
01:23:32.584 - 01:23:57.674, Speaker C: All right. Are there questions? I guess I have one. So this point, this point number three in this theorem, can you say a little bit more what describes means?
01:23:58.294 - 01:24:00.422, Speaker B: Yes, I can say what is the.
01:24:00.478 - 01:24:01.046, Speaker D: Exactly.
01:24:01.110 - 01:24:04.424, Speaker B: So this is equal to the c.
01:24:04.584 - 01:24:11.844, Speaker D: Such that c is PI two for epsilon B and.
01:24:15.424 - 01:24:24.604, Speaker B: T forces that c relativized to h. Aleph two is forcible.
01:24:25.744 - 01:24:28.724, Speaker D: Sorry. T models that.
01:24:30.004 - 01:24:55.608, Speaker B: So this is one possible description, but you can have another which is c such that there exists m such that M models t plus mm plus ch. Sorry. T models T plus yes, plus channel.
01:24:55.766 - 01:25:01.144, Speaker C: Okay, so some kind of maximal theory of yes.
01:25:01.684 - 01:25:45.004, Speaker B: So essentially, the point is this theory is described by forcibility. So if you have a PI two sentence which is forcible to hold in hlf two, then this pie two sentence is going to be true. And here I have to specify that epsilon B contains epsilon delta zero, and it has a constant for omega one, and it has a predicate symbol for the non stationary real, and then it has a predicate symbol for the universal sets. Universally. A certain university.
01:25:47.184 - 01:25:51.204, Speaker C: These would be. These would be natural things in the context your.
01:25:51.664 - 01:25:52.484, Speaker D: Yes.
01:25:55.864 - 01:26:00.604, Speaker C: I mean, to even describe mm, you need these things, right?
01:26:04.064 - 01:26:06.368, Speaker D: For example, what?
01:26:06.536 - 01:26:11.884, Speaker C: To describe something like mm. These are kinds of concepts you need.
01:26:12.664 - 01:26:15.320, Speaker D: Yes, yes, exactly.
01:26:15.512 - 01:26:27.154, Speaker B: To describe what happens in the theory of Hlf two. In models of mm. Well, not even in models of mm. I mean, to describe the theory of hlf two, you better have the non.
01:26:27.194 - 01:26:29.058, Speaker D: Stationary ideal as a predicate.
01:26:29.186 - 01:26:34.298, Speaker B: You better have omega one as a constant. And maybe you want to use some.
01:26:34.346 - 01:26:37.214, Speaker D: Universally verse sets as well, right?
01:26:40.754 - 01:26:51.674, Speaker C: Are there other questions? All right. If not, let's thank Mateo for a really nice talk.
01:26:55.014 - 01:26:58.294, Speaker D: The paper presentation was awesome. Thank you.
