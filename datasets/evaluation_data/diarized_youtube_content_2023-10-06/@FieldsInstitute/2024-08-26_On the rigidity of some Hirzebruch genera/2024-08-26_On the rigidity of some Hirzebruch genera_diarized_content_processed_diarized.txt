00:00:01.200 - 00:00:29.699, Speaker A: So our second speaker this afternoon is Georgi Czernick and his title is on the rigidity of some Herzegov General. Okay, I would like to thank all organizers of this wonderful program and tonight's workshop for the opportunity to give me a talk here. Thank you very much. Is my microphone. It's on some people in zoom. Hi, I think. I think yes.
00:00:29.699 - 00:01:02.095, Speaker A: I can see people online. Is my microphone is on? Is the microphone on? On? I think yes. I think yes. In fact said me that it's on. I don't know. Okay, let's start and let me briefly recall what the cobalt ring is. The cobalt ring? The complex cobalt ring is the ring of doubly complex manifold.
00:01:02.095 - 00:02:04.373, Speaker A: What's doubly complex manifold? It's manifold stably complex structure and stably complex structure on manifold it's complex structure on this. On direct sum of tangent bundle and some trivial real bundle up to addition of trivial complex summons. Okay. And if we have such two manifolds, we can consider coordinating relation between them. And two Stablecomps manifolds are coordinate if the joint union of M and N with opposite stably complex structure is the boundary of some stably complex manifold with boundary and it's a equivalence relation. And we can then define a quotient set. And in fact this set has two operations, addition and multiplication, addition induced by dejoint union and multiplication induced by Cartesian product.
00:02:04.373 - 00:02:27.305, Speaker A: And we obtain some evenly graded in fact commutative ring component marine. It's isomorphic to a polynomial ring with one generator in each even dimension. The result of Novik and Milner. And so with the ring of complex properties. Okay, we have not what we go back.
00:02:27.385 - 00:02:39.497, Speaker B: Yes, definition. So, first of all, I believe that usually one does identify different complex structures that are isomorphic as complex vector bundles.
00:02:39.601 - 00:02:40.525, Speaker A: Yes, yes, yes.
00:02:40.985 - 00:02:53.667, Speaker B: And if you do that, then the almost complex structure does not induce an orientation. And since you wrote N bar, I suspect maybe you're reversing orientation rather than.
00:02:53.731 - 00:02:55.419, Speaker A: No, it's in it's induced orientation.
00:02:55.507 - 00:03:02.611, Speaker B: I'm sorry. No, it does not. If you allow bundle complex bundle.
00:03:02.763 - 00:03:06.987, Speaker A: No complex isomorphism complex orientational fiber was.
00:03:07.011 - 00:03:32.335, Speaker B: In the bundle, but not the manifold, because the vector bundle is morphism might not come. For example, take the three dimensional sphere with its tangent bundle is trivial. Just add a copy of R to make it and then you can identify it in different ways with the trivial bundle C2.
00:03:33.235 - 00:03:35.935, Speaker A: Some of them will.
00:03:37.875 - 00:03:47.471, Speaker B: If you have a representative of J does give you orientation, but equivalent change could induce opposite orientations. I sort of suspect you have fixed an orientation as well.
00:03:47.543 - 00:03:50.327, Speaker A: Different stable complex structure can be induced different orientations?
00:03:50.431 - 00:03:52.783, Speaker B: No equivalent stable complex structures equivalent.
00:03:52.839 - 00:03:54.275, Speaker A: It's up to.
00:03:54.575 - 00:04:02.775, Speaker B: Yeah, they could induce. I'm just saying I suspect that you have chosen orientation. I suspect the N bar is opposite orientation just from looking at the symbols.
00:04:02.895 - 00:04:05.995, Speaker A: And bar with the so called opposite stabilic oblique.
00:04:06.975 - 00:04:08.929, Speaker B: So maybe we can talk about that later.
00:04:09.047 - 00:04:35.265, Speaker A: I said I will not, but I'm just not sure. There are no details here because I have no time. Sorry. Okay, we have notion of opposite stability complex structure. I believe that doubly complex structure, the equivalence class of it induced orientation, in fact. Yeah, this RN is also oriented. Okay, we are.
00:04:35.265 - 00:05:43.455, Speaker A: I will discuss it with you later. Okay. And what's hetroger genera? It's if we have some graded commutative algebra operationals then and cobalt then complex heterogeneous for us is just a ringomorphism from cobodism ring to ring. It's some function on manifolds, on stably complex manifolds, which is invariant with respect to cobodism, which and taken degenerative union to sums and cartesian products to product in R. So and this is theorem that complex genera I in bijection with the power series with coefficients in R with the first term X. It's kind of a result of Kitz Bruch and in one direction, if we have genus phi, then we can apply it coefficient wise to this genus to this power series, it's missing this formula. And obtain some power series with coefficients in R and it's the inverse series for corresponding power series F.
00:05:43.455 - 00:06:40.407, Speaker A: And in the other direction we have. If we have power series F, we can consider the classical formula its symmetric expression in variable 6i and we can express it in elementary symmetric functions. And if we replace elementary symmetric functions by chain classes, we obtain some characteristic class with coefficients in R. And if we apply to tangent bundle and pair with fundamental class, we obtain some element in R and one can check that this is a multiplicative and additive function in over this blink. So it's the bijection. Okay, so we have genera and corresponding power series. Okay, what's a current extension of this genera? We can similarly consider complex copyright of TK invariant equivariant manifolds.
00:06:40.407 - 00:07:18.233, Speaker A: We consider simply complex manifolds with the action of torus. We fix torus, we fix K, we fix some torus and consider manifolds with some action of torus. And in fact. So I need some light. If we have. If we have an action of torus on M, we have induced action on tandem bundle. And if we consider the TVL action on the trivial summit, we obtain some action of torus on this sum.
00:07:18.233 - 00:08:12.369, Speaker A: And then we consider complex structures on this sum which is equivalent with respect to this action. And this is definition of. This is our definition definition of equivariant stably complex manifolds. And we can then consider the usual notion of cobotism of such manifolds. So we obtain the aquarium cobalt is ring then, okay? And in fact we have some comparison homomorphism from this ring to so called homotopical equivalent complex cobotism ring. I will not define what is it because I have no time in fact. But in non aquarium case we have of course that cobotism is not just ring, it's Cochrane theory.
00:08:12.369 - 00:09:03.441, Speaker A: And we can define it in geometric way and in homotopical way as homotopic groups of some spaces, some spectra. And then we have it's pt comparison collapsing map from geometric 1 to homotopical 1. And in non equilibrium case it's isomorphism is tom thorium and but in equivalent case it's not isomorphism because of lactoserity. But we also have this comparison homomorphism from our cobrasim ring to some zomatopical ring. And then we have homorphins from this ring to the ordinary cobotism of classification space of torus which is just power series in k variables with coefficients ordinary complex cobotism marine. So we obtain this homomorphism. We call this the universal complex storing genus.
00:09:03.441 - 00:10:00.789, Speaker A: In fact it's an injective it's results of Kamisani and hanky about inductivity of the first one and the lofter of the inductivity of the second one. So we have some injective motion from our equivalent complex cobolring of manifolds with toro section to power series with coefficients in ordinary complex cobalt ring. Okay, and then if we have some ordinary genera from R, then we can consider the following composition, the universal homomorphism. And then two things on coefficients. We consider Phi Omega U2R and then we we consider on also some change of coordinates because F is is a invertible power series is just change of coordinates. It's convenient in some formulas. And so we from ordinary genus obtain some equivalent extension.
00:10:00.789 - 00:10:52.355, Speaker A: It's homorphism from equivalent copper to some extension of the original ring, its power series. Okay? It's the definition of equivalent extension of the ordinary genus. And then so it takes some manifold with store section and sends it to some power series. But it may happen that on some manifold the value of this extension is just a constant power series. And then we say that the original genos is rigid on some TK manifold if the value of its extension is constant power series on it. In fact, in this situation, this constant is just the value of the original genus on this manifold. And this is because in fact.
00:10:52.355 - 00:11:29.329, Speaker A: Ah, I didn't say that we have such formula for universal toric genus here. Okay, maybe. Okay, but we have this formula, this formula. They obtained the formula, they described explicitly the coefficients of the universal toric genus. It's some power series with coefficient in complex quantism, and we have some coefficients and they explicitly describe these coefficients as some simply complex manifold. In fact, this doubly complex manifolds. So it's.
00:11:29.329 - 00:12:51.337, Speaker A: Okay, I will say about this later, but now it's important that the first term is just M, and if we apply phi change of coordinates do not matter here, then we obtain that the first term of the equivalent accession is phi of M. Okay? Yes. And why this property rigidity is important because in fact we have that this property is equivalent to the fiberwise multiplicativity of the genus for any fiber bundle with fiber M. By definition, genus is multiplicative for trivial bundles, but in some cases it's multiplicative for any fiber bundle, and in fact it's when it's rigid. In fact, this theorem holds by some technical assumption, if genus is multiplicative for any bundle, then it's of course rigid. It falls from this formula, because this, okay, because these coefficients are in fact total space of bundles with fiber M with some base, and this base is coordinated to zero in cobalt ring. And so if phi is multiplicative for any bundle, then we can apply phi to this formula with just some change of coordinates, but it does not matter.
00:12:51.337 - 00:14:02.817, Speaker A: So, and obtain that equivalent extension of Phi of M is 5M with some Phi of this and but phi of this is zero, because if phi is multiplicative, we have phi of these coefficients is phi of M times phi of this, and this is zero, phi of zero is zero. And so we obtain that all higher terms vanish, and we obtain that phi is of course rigid, this value of its accession is constant, and but in other in opposite direction it's. We need some assumptions, because for example, Kodaira constructed. Okay, we have example of genus. The signature of multiplication homology is well known. It's well known genus and of course it's born in Hezbollah theorem that this genus is multiplicative for any bundle with trivial monogamy with trivial action of fundamental group of base on the homology fiber. And then this theorem can be applied for these bundles because this base are simply connected.
00:14:02.817 - 00:14:50.975, Speaker A: And then we obtain this signature is rigid for any m. But Gutierrez constructed some complex surfaces, they're four dimensional real manifolds such that, which are bundles over some Riemann surfaces with fiber Riemann surfaces. And then because of the dimensional reasons, signature is zero on base and zero on fiber. But proved that the signature is not zero for any this surface complex surface. So the signature is rigid on nm but not multiplicative on any bundles. And this counterexample of Codera is counterexample for this theorem without some technical assumption and for Borel hetero theorem without assumption on monotony. So we need some, we need some.
00:14:50.975 - 00:15:57.675, Speaker A: We need to be careful here. So, and, but this, okay, this technical assumption is just this complex cobotism of the classification group of the classification space of structure group is torsion free. Torsion free. If it's torsion free, then rigid genus is multiplicative for any rigid genesis multiplatiform with with this property. Okay, and the main part of my talk it's the following result. It localization formula, which is express, which is which expresses the equivalent extension of some genus on some manifold with isolated fixed points. In terms of fixed point data, if we have manifold with store sections with some finite fixed points, then in any fixed point we have tangent representation of the torus.
00:15:57.675 - 00:16:36.455, Speaker A: And so we have some weights, it's some integer vectors, it's. It's waste, it's here it's k dimensional weights and here it's a formal inner product. It's just linear combinations of variable 6, 1 xk with coefficients are coordinates of the weights. And then we consider F of this. F is power series. We consider F of this integral combination and consider this fraction, then product product. Yes, and then we can also define some sign in any fixed point.
00:16:36.455 - 00:17:39.553, Speaker A: And then we consider the sum with signs of such product. And this is theorem that this expression is in fact equivalent extension of original genus on the manifold M. And you can see that these fractions in fact are not power series. But it's a corollary of this that the sum with signs of such products it's in fact a power series. It's not a fraction, it has no fraction parts, in fact. Okay, and then if we obtain some question, for example, we can ask if we have some manifold or some class of manifolds, we can ask which regina are rigid on these manifolds and the theorem from the theorem we can obtain that this question can be reduced to the algebraic analytic question of the a solution of some rigidity equation we can consider power s power series F and consider this rigidity equation. This is.
00:17:39.553 - 00:18:29.017, Speaker A: This is must be constant in the case of rigidity. And we obtain some equation on F of on power series. And we can try to solve it and answer the question about rigidity of something around some manifolds. Okay, there are some examples, for example, how much. Okay, for example, we have such genus, it's genus with this power series for some values of parameters. This is for example signature for which parameters it's an X rays. And so and the theorem of motion that this kind of universal region general, it means that such genera are rigid on any manifolds.
00:18:29.017 - 00:19:20.907, Speaker A: And if such genus is reached on animals, then it has this form. In fact, it was proved by Bushaber and Bunkov that it's enough to. It's enough rigidity on any only on CP2 in fact and non zero value on CP2. It's it's kind of interesting result, but it's. It's. It's typical result in some in some sense because it may happen that if you consider some general rigid question about rigid on some class of manifolds, you can maybe find some finite many finite set of manifolds and if genus is reached on them, then it's reached on infinite class. And this is with typo.
00:19:20.907 - 00:19:43.753, Speaker A: This is result of such type. So and we. Ah yes, and this is the follow following example. It's genus will be. We will need this genus so oriented elliptic genus. It's some genus, yes, of such and such form. Then it corresponds to power series or elliptic sign.
00:19:43.753 - 00:20:39.785, Speaker A: Elliptic sign. What's elliptic sign? We of course have some analytic definition, but for us it's just an odd power series satisfies this this be quadratic equation or derivative itself for some values. It's again it's a signature. But yes, in this the result of for example that this genus is a universal genus regionic projective plane quaternionic plane is not stably complex, it's just oriented. But some genera can be defined not only on stubbornly complex manifolds, but on any oriented manifolds. And this genera corresponds exactly to odd power series elliptic sign is odd. So we can define this elliptic genus oriented on any oriented manifold.
00:20:39.785 - 00:21:22.905, Speaker A: And then one can prove that this is the genus is a universal rigid genus on cottonic predictive plane. So okay, but we need the complex elliptic genus. And complex elliptic genus is genus with four parameters. It means that corresponding power series have coefficients in four parameters. Or equivalently that genus taking value in four parameter polymerase and what is it? It's complex elliptic. It's universal complex elliptic genus. And it was defined by Krishwehr and Horn independently.
00:21:22.905 - 00:21:47.711, Speaker A: And here we using a point of view of Krishna. So Krish, we just defined the corresponding power series in such form. And what is it? Exponential? It's exponential. But what is it this function in denominator. What it's. It's very very well known in analytic theory of spatial functions Baker Heyer function. But for us it's just.
00:21:47.711 - 00:22:30.067, Speaker A: We have the following formal definition. For example, we can define formally what is the Wierstasp function. It's just function of such form which satisfying the following again some equation. And if we define V function then we can define V star sigma function which has delta function. And then we can define what is this function. And one can check that if we define this function in such way that then this fraction has coefficients in three parameters where parameters is p derivative and g 2, where g 3. But g 3 is a polynomial in the first three parameters, so we do not need them.
00:22:30.067 - 00:23:10.043, Speaker A: Okay, we don't need it. Okay, so it's some formulation and why we need this genus because Kirchheimer defined this and proved this. The following theorem proved that this genus is reached on any SU manifold SU manifold stably complex manifold with the zero or first gen class. And then Krishwehr proved that if we consider such units with such corresponding power series, then it's rigid on any SU manifold. And in fact if we have. Okay, it's not. And the theorem of Bushebe that the Krish Vaginus vanished.
00:23:10.043 - 00:23:44.367, Speaker A: On any quasitoric fu manifold you can check that if you have a toric manifold, then atoric variety, projective toric variety, then it cannot be su. It cannot. It cannot have zero search and class. But there are a lot of positroic SEO manifolds in fact, but on all of them. So. Okay, okay, we have. Okay, now we need to consider the cobot is bring of SU manifolds.
00:23:44.367 - 00:24:17.485, Speaker A: We have SU manifolds because we have cobotism relation between them. And we can define cobolism SU ring as you what is ring? And it's. In fact it's more. It's much more complicated than the compressor, but is one and it has torsion and even modular torsion is not polynomial, but all torsion is two torsion. And if we invert two, then this ring is polynomial. It has such generators. We can choose this generator to be integer to be represented by actual SU manifold.
00:24:17.485 - 00:24:53.815, Speaker A: And this is some low dimensional picture. We have generated Y2 Y2 can be represented by K3 surface. Yes, by K3 surface. It's some quartic in CP3, but there are no toric actions on such surfaces. So we cannot apply our toric techniques for this. For this generator more interesting the second the following generator y3, it can be represented by s6. S6 has the canonical it's well known almost complex structure falling from this representation of.
00:24:53.815 - 00:25:52.942, Speaker A: It's a homogeneous space of some groups and in fact it's almost complex. And of course S6 has no second homology. So the first chain class is zero and this is SU manifold. And in fact one can check that it represents the generator with your body's ring. And we have the action of the maximal torque of SU on S6. And then we can apply our approach of localization formula for the question about rigidity on this on this manifold S6 and is the result of book cyberpunk Andre again that if genus phi is reached on A six, then if it's non zero on this manifold, then it's a christiever genus with parameter B2 non 0. So if Christiver genus is reached on any SU manifold, but if genus is reached on any is on only one SU manifold at 6 and non 0 on it, then it's 2.
00:25:52.942 - 00:26:26.131, Speaker A: But if it's 0 and 6, then it's just. We can only say that its corresponding power series is a multiplication of exponential and some odd power series. And I need. I need to say here that. That what is the exceptional here? If B2 is 0, then preach where power series is just exponential times elliptic sign. And so. Okay, okay, okay.
00:26:26.131 - 00:27:21.209, Speaker A: But what about the higher generators y4? Y4 can be represented by some Bicomplex Grassmannian G24 with some to be complex structure. And I will not talk about this, but all higher generators can be in fact represented by quasi toricus humanitos. The result of Liu and Panov. And this result is falling from the place where toric topology arise in our story. And Lewin Panova constructed some two families of quasitoric humanifolds. It's okay, we have for example, it's specific mainframes over products of simplicity. For example, what is L.
00:27:21.209 - 00:28:03.385, Speaker A: Tilde we have. We have CP2K1 that's projective space. And we can consider sum of line bandwidth over it. And then we consider predictivization of this sum of line banners. This is sum toric manifold, but it's not SU manifold, But we know that it's tangent bundle stability is the sum of some line bundles and Then we can replace some of these line bundles by its complex conjugate, it corresponds to replacement of the corresponding characteristics matrix. And in fact we obtain some quasi toric manifold. Okay, yes, I'm quasitoric manifold, which is humanifold and over.
00:28:03.385 - 00:28:28.023, Speaker A: And in the case of until they we have the similar. Similar construction. So it's untwisted of toric manifolds. It's not toric, it's quasitoric. And. But. And the second important result that if we have two quasitoric manifolds, we can consider its connect sum, it's also vegetarian manifold and it represents the sum of borders classes.
00:28:28.023 - 00:29:08.713, Speaker A: So if we have some comparison classes which is represented by quasitoric manifolds, then we can represent by historic manifolds all integral linear combinations. And from these results Liu and Panov proved that we can represent any generators in ring. Okay, but we need only the first one, y5. Y5 is just the class of L tilde 2, 3. It's the quasitoric manifold. And for quasitoric manifolds we know all fixed point data. It has no.
00:29:08.713 - 00:29:54.539, Speaker A: I don't know, it has, I think 12. Ah, it has so. So 12. Yes, it has 12 fixed points with some weights in each of them. But. And we can write directly the rigidity equation and from some analysis of these equations we can in some sense solve it and obtain the following result that if our genus phi is rigid on a 6 and 0 on a C, so the corresponding power series is the multiplication of exponential on some odd power series. And if phi is reached on this manifold quasitoric manifold, then in fact this odd power series is just the elliptic sign.
00:29:54.539 - 00:30:22.099, Speaker A: So we obtain the following result that Krishna genus is the universal genus which is rigid on S6. And this is you positoric manifolds. And in particular it's universal su rigid genus. If some genus is rigid on any issue manifold, then it's Krishever genus. And in the following slide I wanted to say something about the oriented case, but I think I have no time. Yes. No.
00:30:22.099 - 00:30:28.555, Speaker A: Okay, not control what.
