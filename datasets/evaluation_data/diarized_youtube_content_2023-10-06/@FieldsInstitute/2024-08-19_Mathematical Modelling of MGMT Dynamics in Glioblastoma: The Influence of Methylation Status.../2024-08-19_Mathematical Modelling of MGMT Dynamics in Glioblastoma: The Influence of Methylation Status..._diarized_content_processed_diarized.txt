00:00:00.160 - 00:00:22.326, Speaker A: Welcome to our online friends and colleagues. Can we speak here as well? Yes, stop chatting. We might. Is it possible for the online people to speak here also? Maybe we could pass that. Does somebody online want to speak? Hello. This is from online. Excellent.
00:00:22.326 - 00:00:43.676, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, we can hear you loud and clear. Wonderful. Thank you. Right, so with great pleasure, I introduce the next speaker, Mark Sarok. He will be speaking about something on the hallmarks of cancer, but more specific about the mathematical MGMT dynamics in glioblastoma. Yes.
00:00:43.676 - 00:00:55.978, Speaker A: Thank you so much, Mark. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much for the welcome. So I think Thomas just wanted to remind you all of this beautiful figure that we all know so well.
00:00:55.978 - 00:01:23.480, Speaker A: And Thomas did a very good job of elucidating in the previous talk. So I'm actually going to speak mainly about kind of this one over here, I think. Anyway, maybe somebody actually, there's a few when we were around number 1112, I was thinking some of those might actually also be appropriate for my talk. So. And this kind of distinction between epigenetic and phenotypic stuff, that's a. That's the kind of stuff I want to speak about. So, yeah.
00:01:23.480 - 00:01:52.106, Speaker A: Is that. Does anybody want to say anything more about this slide, or should we move on? Apologies. I'll just be running back and forth. Yeah. So hopefully that's the last time I have to go to that computer. So, yeah, I'm from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. Got this fancy crest, and it's kind of very old medical school in Ireland.
00:01:52.106 - 00:02:27.954, Speaker A: It recently got university status. It's kind of primarily focused on medicine and health sciences, and it's based in Dublin in Ireland. And. Okay, this is a little bit different looking, but Dublin is very different from Toronto in some ways. I think it's quite a striking difference. Can you guess which city has a height restriction on new build, new buildings? It's this one over here. And that leads Dublin to being a very diffuse and spread out city.
00:02:27.954 - 00:02:54.660, Speaker A: It's kind of got tendrils that reach out into the nearby counties, and it's always kind of expanding outwards, much like guilloblastoma. The GTA is greater Toronto area. Yeah. I was thinking that people were telling me that when I landed in Toronto that actually, this is a facade. It's not all like this. It's kind of. It actually spreads out also like glioblastoma.
00:02:54.660 - 00:03:15.140, Speaker A: Sorry, that was my segue that I was trying to make over, and I was thinking, how do I kind of just do a cold open here. But, yeah. So glioblastoma is an aggressive type of brain cancer. I don't have spent too long on this. It's highly invasive in nature. It's difficult to completely remove surgically. It's often resistant to treatment.
00:03:15.140 - 00:03:53.940, Speaker A: What is that treatment? Well, currently it's the stoop protocol, which is maximal safe cervical resection followed by radiotherapy, and it's given in conjunction with temozolomide, or what I would call TMZ. And I think right away I'm going to get into trouble for that. So I apologize. If I call it TMZ and everyone else calls it TMZ, I'm going to try my best to say TMZ because I think we're in North America, although some Canadian can correct me. Would a canadian say Z or z? Z. Okay, but like I said, we're influenced by Americans. Yes, you were telling me.
00:03:53.940 - 00:04:38.416, Speaker A: Right, okay, but it is that. Right? So I'm confused now. Yeah, but you would say, when you were trying to say x, y z, if you cross the border, you'd say XYZ. Okay. But because of the huge influence of american culture and medicine, we're all going to say TMZ, and I'm going to say TMZ in this talk, so we can see that with this protocol. Apologies, I've forgotten how to use this. It's not quite coming out as clearly as I had hoped, but this is a kind of Kaplan Meier curve, showing the survival percentage over time of glioblastoma patients.
00:04:38.416 - 00:05:02.308, Speaker A: And you can see essentially, with the TMZ, the patients fare a bit better, but in general, it's still quite poor. It's still only about twelve to 15 months with this standard treatment. And. Apologies. I wonder if I can just get rid of that. Okay. No, no, I'm not going to be able to get rid of that.
00:05:02.308 - 00:05:34.530, Speaker A: That's okay. I don't want to accidentally rule the factory. So, five year survival rate, who can? I think it's 6%. And I apologize if I got that number wrong with a five year survival rate. The main thing I want to say is not very. It's poor. And there is this influence of the methylation status of the NGMT promoter, which seems to have a big influence on the survival percentage or overall survival time of the patients.
00:05:34.530 - 00:05:55.024, Speaker A: And this was my. I was going to include some slide on the hallmarks of cancer. I forgot that Thomas was performing, and he's going to. He's already given a much better job than I could ever do at going through them all. But I just want to say I'm going to focus on resisting cell death. And Thomas already spoke about the effects. I'm going to skip over this quite quickly.
00:05:55.024 - 00:06:38.610, Speaker A: It's a key mechanism in cancer progression and treatment resistance. It can be due to the evasion of apoptosis, altered DNA repair mechanisms, overexpression of survival proteins, and our focus in this talk is MGMT mediated resistance in gurublastoma. So MGMT, what is it some of you might not be familiar with? It's a DNA repair protein, sometimes referred to as a suicide enzyme. So in doing this business of repairing the protein, it gets kind of consumed or used up. So it's kind of an interesting feature that I want to make clear from the beginning. It removes the alkyl groups, specifically from the o six position of guanine. It effectively counteracts the effects of the temozolomide treatment.
00:06:38.610 - 00:07:29.680, Speaker A: It repairs the damage caused by TMZ. Sorry, I've already said TMZ. Reducing its effectiveness. We can see here if we have high Mgmt methylation. So the methylation epigenetic modification essentially gets in the way of the normal transcriptional process. If we have high MgMt methylation that's associated with low expression of the MgMT gene, we can see that when we have this high MgMt methylation, the patients on the blue line here survive quite a bit better. And this is actually the MGMT status of the glioblastoma is both prognosed and predictive of the overall survival.
00:07:29.680 - 00:08:00.538, Speaker A: The status of MGMT is crucial at the moment. It's one of the very few things when we get a Google pass through a patient in check. The MGMT status of the global assume straight away we have a pretty good idea of how long they're going to live just based on that MGMT status. So there's also this. So I've tried to. Sorry, go on, Thomas. Who produces MGMT? So who produces it? All of our cells produce m, two MTA, normal cells and cancer cells.
00:08:00.538 - 00:08:31.330, Speaker A: Sorry, that's a very good point. Both the normal cells and the cancer cells produce MGMT. And where it gets confusing in the literature is the link between TMZ treatment and MGMT expression. Some papers show that there's an increase in MGMT expression following TMZ treatment, both at the mRNA and protein level. That's something I'll come back to, but just to keep in the back of your mind for now. Sorry.
00:08:31.490 - 00:08:46.698, Speaker B: So that the increase in expression occurs in cancer cells before the initiation of treatment, as I said, when the patient shows presents.
00:08:46.754 - 00:08:54.434, Speaker A: So it's actually. It's following. So after we've treated the patients with the standard treatment.
00:08:54.482 - 00:09:02.138, Speaker B: No, that I understand. But you also said that patients present that you could predict base and valid percent, but when they don't.
00:09:02.194 - 00:09:11.070, Speaker A: Sorry, that's true. Yeah, yeah. The way I read about was not quite right. You're right. It's kind of. We're always kind of following the treatment. Yeah, we don't.
00:09:11.070 - 00:09:14.618, Speaker A: That's a very good point, though. Yeah, yeah. So.
00:09:14.674 - 00:09:21.070, Speaker B: And also, is it a. So just also to understand, is this a genetic change in the.
00:09:22.880 - 00:09:30.440, Speaker A: That's the whole point, yeah, that's what I'm going to talk about. Yeah, it's a very good question, though. And that's. I don't want to answer that quite yet.
00:09:30.520 - 00:09:33.700, Speaker B: Yeah, no, no, that's good.
00:09:37.720 - 00:10:02.458, Speaker A: So that's not something I've studied. It may well do. You know, I'm taking a kind of very simplistic, parsimonious approach here, but interactions with P 53 may well be very important and that's one way that. Yeah, please. Sorry, in the last point, when you say some papers show the increase, is.
00:10:02.474 - 00:10:04.954, Speaker B: That in vitro or in vivo?
00:10:05.082 - 00:10:35.650, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's in vitro and I think I'm in vitro and mice and there's less data in patience and. Yeah, the data is a little bit sparse when it comes to the MGMT expression. And I think this has led to these kind of. What I'll say is a bit of confusion in the literature over this. But anyway, I'll come back to that a little bit. I want to outline my talks. I'm going to present models of cell death resistance, focusing on non genetic aspects.
00:10:35.650 - 00:11:30.226, Speaker A: What I mean, that's more like phenotype or things related to mRNA and protein and gene expression rather than mutations in genes. I'm going to talk about this thing, phenotypic selection. I'm going to present some minimal models to capture phenotypic selection that I first developed when trying to capture antibiotic resistance in bacteria. When I was making this talk, I thought that bit is completely unrelated to the hallmarks of cancer. But when Thomas was speaking this morning, you know, about this gut bacteria and all this stuff, that stuff might not be so, you know, rat field after. It might actually be tangentially more related than I thought. So I'm going to present these kind of minimal models, and then the way I tend to make models is kind of what I would have thought of was like a bottom up.
00:11:30.226 - 00:12:09.762, Speaker A: So kind of a start. Off as simple as possible and gradually building complexity with the availability of data. So that's my philosophy, that's the way I tend to do things. But I know there's going to be contrasting opinions on that and, you know, I understand that holistic approaches are needed as well. So anyway, I'm going to suggest, going to end by suggesting some treatment strategy based on the model output. So phenotypic selection, it's also got this name as emergent gene expression. It's sometimes called non darwinian evolution, so that's to distinguish it from darwinian evolution.
00:12:09.762 - 00:12:51.156, Speaker A: So what it is, it's expression of a fitness inducing gene which is selectively upregulated in response to a change of environment. And it was funny because this morning when we were discussing, I think there was already a discussion about this between, I think, Paul and Edward. You're talking about the timescales at which a highly expressed protein might. This is essentially what we're going to be speaking about, but it was just interesting to hear that it's discussed already. This is what I mean by phenotypic selection. Fitness is based on phenotype rather than genotype. This has implications for cancer drug resistance and antibiotic resistance.
00:12:51.156 - 00:14:02.110, Speaker A: Here's the classical image of, let's say, darwinian evolution or genetic selection, where we have a homogeneous population of cells with maybe one genetic mutant, which in response to the addition of a cytotoxic drug, survives, whereas all the other cells are killed off. This cell that's been selected for can then divide and replicate, and then when we apply that same drug again, we find it's totally ineffective. The population is now resistant, if you like. So that's kind of the classical view of things I think we're all familiar with and don't need to spend much time on. So the other half of it is this non genetic heterogeneity with phenotypically resistant subpopulation fractions. So here we have expression of a fitness inducing gene that's expressed in cells stochastically at different levels. And let's say that the cells with a higher expression of this gene tend to be fitter and can survive in response to the addition of a cytotoxic drug.
00:14:02.110 - 00:15:02.836, Speaker A: Here, when we add the cytotoxic drug, maybe 90% of the cells are killed off, but we have a few cells that are able to survive based on their expression of a fitness inducing protein at that time. These cells are then able to divide. And what the thought is is that this then gives the chance for more hardwired genetic mutations to arise. So this phenotypic selection may precede genetic selection. So it's kind of a temporary measure that allows these cancer cells to develop really dangerous mutations that we can't then treat as easily. And as Thomas was saying earlier, this, uh, you know, these mutations can really accumulate quickly, and it can become very difficult. So, ideally, we would have, I guess, loved for the initial phenotypic, phenotypic selection to be not there and all the cells be wiped out.
00:15:02.836 - 00:15:07.880, Speaker A: So what I'm interested in is how, how we overcome this phenotypic selection. Sorry.
00:15:08.460 - 00:15:17.140, Speaker B: So, because a lot of experiments show nowadays that you stop treatment and you get sunny reversibility to the original population. Right.
00:15:17.180 - 00:15:37.520, Speaker A: I'm going to. Yeah, I'm going to speak about that. And. Yeah, that's an excellent question, though. Yeah. So, yeah, I just want to put some really basic requirements of the model to model stereotypic section. So the model should be stochastic to capture variability in phenotypes, and it should include cell growth division and cell death to capture selection.
00:15:37.520 - 00:16:35.676, Speaker A: So the first ingredient is stochastic gene expressions. We might use kind of chemical master equation with a simple gene expression model like we see in the top right there. And I think such models, you know, there's been quite a lot of progress analytically. They almost have full analytical solutions at this case, at least in terms of the first and second movements. But I'm going to start going to use more computational numerical approaches. So here we see kind of a pseudocode of the stochastic simulation algorithm, where we sample the next time, the time to the next reaction from an exponential distribution, and then we sample two additional random variables to work out probabilistically the next reaction that occurs. And we end up with some plots like this, where individual trajectories are statistically exact solutions of the underlying chemical master equation.
00:16:35.676 - 00:17:14.312, Speaker A: So we might even just at this point, say, sorry, if at time 100, we were to add some drug, and we can see that some cells have very high protein expression here, others are very low. So we'd expect maybe these cells up here to survive at that moment in time. I want to link this in with cell growth models. Here. I'm just showing basic exponential growing populations, but I'm modeling it in a few different ways. The first rule is this kind of mother machine approach, which is nice for modeling cell lineages. And here we just model a mother cell growing, and then it produces a daughter cell.
00:17:14.312 - 00:17:44.340, Speaker A: We discard the daughter cell and keep the mother cell, and then we look at lineages going forward like this. And there might be some variability in the final volume of the cell. So it might not exactly double before we have the division, and there might be one block or so slightly larger than the other. So these kinds of variability are built in here. And I've included some pseudo code for that in the top right corner. Of course, this mother machine approach is.
00:17:45.800 - 00:17:49.960, Speaker C: Sorry, can I ask a question regarding slide?
00:17:50.040 - 00:17:57.396, Speaker A: Yes, yes. Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:17:57.508 - 00:18:06.520, Speaker C: Any idea about type of process taking. So, diffusion process.
00:18:07.820 - 00:18:12.880, Speaker A: Oh, like a diffusion process to model the stochastic gene expression.
00:18:14.580 - 00:18:16.868, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:18:16.884 - 00:19:04.340, Speaker A: It's a chemical sprite, right? Yeah. And that's an interesting point. Yeah. There are, I guess, different levels of fidelity that we can model in chemical longevity equations, or what I use at some point is a kind of tall leaping algorithm that's somewhere between a stochastic differential equation and the stochastic simulation. It's a little bit of a clean approximation, but those kind of things are very important considerations. And a big point that I want to get across in this talk is that ultimately, I was trying to balance between fitting, well, let's say, capturing data while keeping the model as computationally tractable as possible. And so there were some, I don't know, shortcuts, but some approximations were made that could be refined.
00:19:04.340 - 00:20:04.960, Speaker A: I hope we touch upon them, but with respect to this kind of modeling of the cell growth. So I have this kind of mother machine approach, and we have this exponentially growing population approach. But this, I hope to convince you that this middle, let's say, approach can quickly become computationally intractable, especially with this exponentially growing population. And can, while, of course, that's what happens in nature, it's just, it prohibits certain things. And what we found is a good middle path between the mother machine and the exponential growing population is fixed population. So something like 1000, 10,000, 10,0000 cells. And when the cells grow and divide, we kind of randomly replace a cell in our population.
00:20:04.960 - 00:21:11.052, Speaker A: And I know there are problems with that as well, but this was kind of a what we thought was a good middle ground. So the exponential growing approach, obviously, is the most realistic for underserved growth. That's very computationally expensive. And if we're trying to compare populations at different time points or compare two different populations with the stochasticity involved in the cell dabbling time and things like this, it can become a little bit tricky for comparing two populations in a fair way. The mother machine approach, obviously is good for studying individual cell lineages, but misses these population level dynamics and population snapshots. There's the fixed population, I believe, or I'm trying to convince you, balances computational efficiency of population insights, allows clear comparisons easily between conditions, captures this population heterogeneity, and doesn't rule out simulation based inference, which is ultimately what I'm working towards. So yes, I think you probably got the picture already, but it's something like this.
00:21:11.052 - 00:22:03.780, Speaker A: So we have a population at time t plus tall. There might be three cells that divide. We then take these cells and then randomly replace existing cells in the population to keep the population constant. And I just made a note here. I should have attributed the offer of the paper, but there was some interesting study that showed the modern machine approach can lead to significantly, I wish that wasn't there. Underestimation of, I think the mean number of molecules, or overestimation of the mean number of molecules and underestimation of the intrinsic noise. So there's some issue with using this kind of mother machine individual, you know, mother cell being replaced by one of its daughters.
00:22:03.780 - 00:22:12.872, Speaker A: And we're not going to use that approach. I think often I do this when.
00:22:12.896 - 00:22:14.408, Speaker B: We track daughter cells.
00:22:14.464 - 00:22:34.580, Speaker A: Right. So I wrote, the author is Philip Thomas of Imperial College London. I apologize for not including that reference. I'm going to. Yeah, I don't know if we have maybe the slides somewhere online. I want to make sure I. Yeah, yeah.
00:22:34.580 - 00:22:41.520, Speaker A: So. Yeah. Oh, that's true, actually. Yeah. That would be in terms of. Yeah, exactly. Exponentially.
00:22:41.520 - 00:23:03.450, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Based on the stochastic simulation algorithm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. Yes. I want to combine these two, which is actually the point that you were just raising there. So we want to combine the stochastic simulation algorithm with the analytical solutions of some cell growth models.
00:23:03.450 - 00:23:36.640, Speaker A: And as I've said already, we use tal heaping coupled with the analytical solution of cell growth models. Initially just exponential growth models. We also use analytical solutions of the logistic growth model compared single as well, and use binomial partitioning to split mRNA's and proteins between daughter cells. And. Yeah, I'm probably not going to go through all of the pseudocode here, but this is the kind of output you get where you have. This is just a single cell. This is actually a mother cell simulation just to show you very easily what I'm talking about.
00:23:36.640 - 00:24:22.396, Speaker A: So we have the cells growing and then I halving in volume as they divide with the mother cell, replacing one of the daughter cells being discarded. And we have the mRNA levels going up and down. And we see in response to the cell dilution, a strict approximate halving of the mRNA. And similarly with the protein here, I have the number of cells tracked on the bottom here. And we can then, okay, okay. Before I do that, I did the exact same thing again, but this time I divided by the volume of the cell. This is what I'm going to be using throughout the talk.
00:24:22.396 - 00:24:56.406, Speaker A: So I just wanted to make that explicit. So we tend to look at the protein per cell volume and mRNA per cell volume, and the number of cells is just the same here. Now I've added in ten cells. Now we're in this fixed cell population approach that I was mentioning earlier. And we can see the dynamics of the cells growing and dividing alongside the mRNA and protein concentrations. Excuse me. So this is just exponentially growing cells.
00:24:56.406 - 00:25:24.492, Speaker A: It's just an exponential cell growth model. Deterministic, sorry, I purely deterministic the cell group. Sorry. Or maybe I have some stochasticity in terms of the final cell volume. So based on, it's kind of this noisy linear map that maps basically adds a little bit of noise around the. Yeah, exactly. There's a little bit of noise in there.
00:25:24.492 - 00:25:54.724, Speaker A: And also when the cells half, they don't exactly half in size, there's, it's not like 50 50, because there's some experiments to show that the cells, you know, one daughter cell can be slightly larger than the other. And so we've tried to reflect that as well. So there is a little bit of sarcasticism. Right, right, yeah. This is just some uniformity. Yeah. Uniform sampled noise.
00:25:54.724 - 00:26:27.574, Speaker A: Sorry, sampled from a uniform distribution over some range. Yeah. So yeah. The initial experimental data that motivated all of this was a bacterial system, as I've said before. So specifically we're interested in his c, which maybe nobody is familiar with. I don't think it's so widely known. So it's an enzyme which plays a crucial role in the creation of histidine, basic amino acid.
00:26:27.574 - 00:27:12.042, Speaker A: And histidine is needed for cell growth. So cells that have more histidine tend to grow faster. And if we have high expression of his c, we confer fitness upon the cell population in a histidine depleted environment. So if initially we have the cells in a medium that's rich in histidine, they're all growing very nicely. If we then deplete the environment of histidine, only those cells that have high expression of the hist seed gene will then continue to grow nicely. The ones that happen to have lower expression of the his seed gene will no longer grow as nicely. And.
00:27:12.042 - 00:28:28.370, Speaker A: Yeah, so we have some data actually related to this so they tagged his c with some fluorescence protein, and what they found is that in response to a change of the environment, the his c distribution, his c protein, if you like, shifted to the right. Now, they also had a very tight control, because not that interesting to have the expression of a protein increase or shift to the right. This can often happen if cells are just growing a little bit more slowly, there could be less dilution and the cells can shift to the right. So they also had kind of a reference protein, if you like, that was also expressed in those same cells. And what we found is, or sorry, what they found is that when they depleted the environment of histidine, you see a modest shift to the right in these reference proteins. These reference proteins do not compare fitness. But when we looked at the ratio of the fitness proteins to the reference proteins, we see a stark shift to the right, a unimodal shift to the right in the distribution.
00:28:28.370 - 00:29:48.810, Speaker A: An interesting thing, which I think, Eduardo, you commented on earlier, is, is this process reversible or not? I apologize, that's a little bit obscured. But if you add histidine, the system then returns to its initial state. There's an interesting part about it. So the idea is that we're moving in this kind of monostable structure that we see in the right, as opposed to a more sophisticated, interesting dynamical landscape, which might have multiple kind of fit states. So in this kind of regime, we might expect that if we move from an unfit to a fit state and then add back the histidine, we might expect the cells to stay in this higher mode of expression. But what they found is that, yeah, it's more like this scenario here, where it goes back to its initial state. Yes, we were trying to model this in a simple way where we had this approximate model I was talking about before, with the expression of two genes, the only difference being that one influences the level of the internal histidine, so that when we remove the external histidine, the cells that have more of this protein will have an advantage.
00:29:48.810 - 00:30:49.626, Speaker A: And what we found, to keep an eye on the time. Yeah, what we found is that, just to wrap up, this was quite a few years of work. But what we eventually found is that it was easy to observe an increase in history in model simulations following his depletion. But these were usually for superficial reasons, like, as I was mentioning earlier, just the growth rate decreasing and the level of dilution diminishing, and an accumulation of his, see. But it was very difficult for us to observe any increase relative to a reference protein. So when we were doing this kind of model, we were using the exact same parameters for transcription and translation for the reference protein and the fitness protein. And just to summarize, what we found is that we essentially needed the autocorrelation time or the lifetime of his c or the fitness protein.
00:30:49.626 - 00:31:46.392, Speaker A: Apologize, I've forgotten to end that sentence there. Fitness inducing protein to extend beyond that of the cell, so that dilution doesn't wipe out any selection. So we need a positive feedback here to keep a memory of the higher protein expression. And around this time, when we were doing these models, it was quite a few years ago. Now, as you see from the years on these papers, fingers 20 1516, there started to be a growing consensus that global positive feedbacks exist between the growth rate and gene expression rates. It's more like this kind of picture, particularly in bacteria, where cell growth rate would then impact in the same manner both the reference protein and the fitness protein. And essentially with these extra positive feedback groups, we could start to see this unimodal shift to the right.
00:31:46.392 - 00:32:38.070, Speaker A: In our simulations of our model, we actually did a huge approximate bayesian computation model comparison study, where we basically look at the minimum models with different ingredients and trying to figure out which ones gave us this kind of ratio greater than one. And there's only three models that really came out, and they all involved these global gene expression growth rate feedback loops. Back in one that was on the right. Yeah, which was. It didn't quite capture our data that we had that we were trying to model. It was a model that had what we called regulated gene expression. So constitutive gene expression is just a constant expression of a gene into mRNA.
00:32:38.070 - 00:32:53.914, Speaker A: What we're terming regulated gene expression is when we have a kind of switching of a gene on and off. So there's this rapid on and off switching that can capture this kind of bursting behavior of gene expression that's regulated by description factor.
00:32:53.962 - 00:32:56.626, Speaker B: That's a binary variable.
00:32:56.698 - 00:33:36.710, Speaker A: Just a binary variable that can randomly. Yeah, exactly. Then we observed this bimodal distribution started to emerge. In this model, we did actually get this ratio increasing, but when we looked at the consideration output, it would be like switching between one than the other. There would be a bimodal distribution in the protein before we depleted the histidine, they would be roughly the same. And after the kind of hire maybe be selected. So it's kind of, it's a little bit of a different thing to what we were investigating, but yeah, we kind of included it here in the table.
00:33:37.650 - 00:33:51.386, Speaker C: To ask technical questions. Yeah, so speak about. Actually, I put in a base transition.
00:33:51.578 - 00:33:53.138, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:33:53.234 - 00:33:54.738, Speaker C: If you can go backwards.
00:33:54.834 - 00:34:03.170, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I see, yeah.
00:34:05.150 - 00:34:07.806, Speaker C: On the leftmost diagram is.
00:34:07.878 - 00:34:08.530, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:09.510 - 00:34:11.398, Speaker C: Like, I understand this reference.
00:34:11.454 - 00:34:17.438, Speaker A: Level one. Yeah. So. Yeah.
00:34:17.574 - 00:34:24.153, Speaker C: What you have is linear, what we call Laplace, or double exponential distribution.
00:34:24.301 - 00:34:25.709, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Yes.
00:34:26.129 - 00:34:47.169, Speaker C: Then you move away from it, you get kind of approximated, like normal. That's all right. Financial Laplace distribution is actually useful in statistical evidence for degree, because.
00:34:47.289 - 00:34:48.469, Speaker A: Yes, yes.
00:34:49.009 - 00:34:51.481, Speaker C: Absolute value becomes.
00:34:51.665 - 00:34:52.058, Speaker A: Right.
00:34:52.114 - 00:35:00.762, Speaker C: Then we get a kind of transition phase transition from Laplace double exponential, level one to normal.
00:35:00.906 - 00:35:26.652, Speaker A: Right. It sounds very interesting, you know, off the top of my head now, I'm not sure, but I think we might have to discuss more in person later. It sounds like it could be another possible explanation of it. Right. Yeah, yeah.
00:35:26.676 - 00:35:28.000, Speaker B: I just wanted to ask a question.
00:35:28.620 - 00:35:32.060, Speaker A: Right. Sorry. Yeah. Yep, please. Sorry. Yeah.
00:35:32.220 - 00:35:41.600, Speaker B: So what kind of mechanism accounts for this impact growth? I'm sorry? Gene expression. I'm sorry.
00:35:41.980 - 00:36:08.572, Speaker A: Right. Yeah, it's. Yeah. The exact mechanism. What's driving these global feedbacks. Yeah, that's a very good question. You know, I think our understanding at the moment is more just that basically measuring the growth rates under these and the gene expression levels, and it's kind of like, I guess, a top down understanding of it.
00:36:08.572 - 00:36:27.300, Speaker A: But I understand what you're saying is, mechanistically what's causing these links between the goal for and the gene expression level. You know, I don't think that's very clear yet, but I might be mistaken. But I think that's. That's a very good question. I wish I could answer it. Better.
00:36:30.040 - 00:36:35.380, Speaker B: Competition for housekeeping, right?
00:36:35.680 - 00:36:36.460, Speaker A: Yes.
00:36:37.720 - 00:36:39.816, Speaker B: But I don't know if that's what's happening here.
00:36:39.888 - 00:36:54.850, Speaker A: It may be, yeah. I think there were some studies looking into those. Yeah, I, um. The Terrance wa group, which I might have. Yeah, I think exactly. Sorry. Yeah.
00:36:54.850 - 00:37:20.358, Speaker A: So I didn't build these kind of features into my mother. You know, I kind of just. Yeah. Put it in more as a phenomenological term. But it's a very good question. You know, like, if I was really going from the ground up, I would be interested in including these details, and I haven't, mainly because I think. I guess it depends what question we're trying to answer and things.
00:37:20.358 - 00:37:54.166, Speaker A: But I apologize. Yeah, it's a very good question. I wish I could answer it there. Yeah. Oh, sorry. I can't remember where it was, but essentially, in the end, we were trying to infer some data with these models, and we found this kind of dose dependent effect. So we would have this, I apologize about the colors, especially colorblind bureaus, but essentially we found that the larger doses of the histidine we supplied, oh, sorry.
00:37:54.166 - 00:38:35.240, Speaker A: So reversing so we would get the maximum effect with zero histidine supplied. And then as we added more, the level of the fitness protein relative to the reference protein would diminish. So it's kind of dose dependent effect. I think that's what I'm trying to say. And it would also be reflected in these kind of OD curves or the cell growth levels would be impacted. And we were able to capture these reasonably well, obviously not exactly, but at least qualitatively with our models. Anyway, just to wrap up those lessons, because I feel like I'm running out of time.
00:38:35.240 - 00:39:20.980, Speaker A: So the lessons learned from bacteria, phenotypic selection requires sufficient noise and gene expression. I don't think I even emphasize that enough. But the mRNA noise in particular had to be sufficient to kind of drive this genotypic selection. And we needed some kind of cellular memory which we found with the addition of the global positive feedback loops we could account for. And then we would observe this dose dependent selective upregulation of hip dysprocytes observed in response to various stresses. I've already showed you this histidine histi example, which is very obscure, but we were looking at more common antibiotic drugs and things like this as well. And if anyone's interested, I'm more than happy to share some more literature on that.
00:39:20.980 - 00:40:09.480, Speaker A: But yeah, I think the key point I also want to drive home, if I haven't already, is this may provide a temporary survival strategy before genetic adaptation, and in bacterial populations is potentially widespread. We found essentially huge parts of the parameter space that could explain our data. So it wasn't, it wasn't like a very stiff part of the parameter space where parameters had to be in some very tight conformation to observe the behavior. But it was quite a easy data to capture with the model anyway. Yeah. So I tried to take some of these lessons from bacteria. I apologize if I'm going over time to MGMT modeling in glioblastoma.
00:40:09.480 - 00:40:54.030, Speaker A: And we tried to keep the models as similar as possible, but we would use comparison. So analytical solutions of comparison growth rates. We would use growth rates, parameters as close as we could to the literature, the growth rates of glioblastoma cells and the sizes of glioblastoma cells and all these different details as best we could. We also had this additional interesting fact that when the NGMT protein would repair DNA damage. We would have it consumed in a kind of chemical reaction and we had to. Also, I haven't actually talked or included cell death at all in any of the models so far, which is of course a crucial component as well. So I'm just going to quickly.
00:40:54.030 - 00:41:46.920, Speaker A: So we have the same models as before. And now, just to show you the rough idea, I've included just a basic threshold model. So if the protein levels are below a certain level at time 50, I've said the cell dies. And even with just this basic model. So it's the same thing I was talking about before with the self growth, cell growth division, mRNA dynamics, protein dynamics. We start to see, when we add this fixed cell population over here we have ten cells and we could start to see this kind of selection of the higher protein expression states, even with this very simple toy model that I'm showing here. And the interesting thing also that we observed is that we get this kind of cell population or cell viability.
00:41:46.920 - 00:42:23.142, Speaker A: I'm going to call recovery over time. Initially, when this threshold model is applied, you see a huge drop in the cell population, with all those cells that don't have enough of this protein being killed. Then we start to see a recovery in the cell population. If we look at that, just with 100 cells, we do a kernel density estimate of 100 cells. It doesn't look too pretty, but we see a kind of shifting to the right in the distribution. But this is all very rough toy mortuary. And there's no reference protein here, there's no probabilistic cell death here.
00:42:23.142 - 00:43:15.404, Speaker A: It's just a threshold. There's no dosing of TMZ, it's just a constant cell death. We try to do all these things more carefully and then use approximate bayesian computation. Specifically, we use this adaptive APMC adaptive population Monte Carlo variant, which we found to be a bit more efficient. And we were trying to spend as much time as we could carefully crafting these prior distributions to be consistent with the literature on rail, blasto and NGMT dynamics. And we defined loss functions to capture available experimental data. We did have a little bit of in house experimental data in RCSI, essentially the cell viability of MGMT expressing GBM cells under different doses of TMZ and different growth rates.
00:43:15.404 - 00:43:25.160, Speaker A: And we aim to identify parameter sets that produce phenotypic selection of MGMT in response to TMZ. Sorry if I'm going too quickly. Yeah, sorry, sorry.
00:43:25.580 - 00:43:26.548, Speaker B: Do you have a.
00:43:26.644 - 00:43:27.900, Speaker A: First of all, how many parameters?
00:43:27.940 - 00:43:30.420, Speaker B: Second, is it one of these fixed population models?
00:43:30.580 - 00:43:43.748, Speaker A: Yes. Excuse me. Yeah, I was. I was starting to get worried that I was going to run out of time, so I went a bit in override there. Apologies about that. Thank you for stopping me. So, the model is still relatively simple.
00:43:43.748 - 00:43:48.788, Speaker A: I wish I had the same. Yeah, I didn't have it anyway. Right.
00:43:48.844 - 00:43:50.916, Speaker B: I thought six, seven parameters or something.
00:43:51.028 - 00:44:06.704, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just six or seven parameters or something. That's relatively small model, very parsimonious, very simplistic model, maybe. Sorry, I'm doing it might be eight or nine parameters. Yeah. And what was your other questions? It's a fixed population model. Yeah. It's still with like a thousand.
00:44:06.704 - 00:44:15.420, Speaker A: Yeah. 10,000 maybe cells we were using, or 100,000. I can't remember. It was basically as much as we could computationally handle.
00:44:17.560 - 00:44:20.176, Speaker B: When you do parameters, finish the average.
00:44:20.328 - 00:44:40.270, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we were. Yeah, exactly. So the cell viability, we were fitting to things like that. And there we would like. We have that exact same data, essentially, from this simulations. But in terms of. That's the unfortunate thing about this is we didn't have data for gene expression, so we didn't have the same.
00:44:40.270 - 00:45:38.220, Speaker A: We had these really cool experiments with the bacteria, with this tcam machine that would simultaneously give you fluorescence outputs for, I think, up to three genes and give you some cell growth, uh, dynamics at the same time. And I suppose that's the advantage of working with bacteria. There are these kind of technologies available that are give you beautiful data that you can fit very rigorously, lots of different bits of output from the model. But we were essentially just looking at. Okay, keeping the cell viability and the cell group and things like that is closely constrained to data that we had. But we were just exploring what parts of the parameter space would give us this selective upregulation of MGMT, but we didn't constrain it to data. So that's weakness of the study, is that we didn't have the MGMT expression to add.
00:45:38.220 - 00:46:07.212, Speaker A: So we didn't, as you were saying, take the mean of the MgMT or something like that, because we just didn't have it. We essentially defined a loss term that would give us the shift to the right in the distribution of MgMT. But that was kind of threshold thing. Yeah. We were just trying to identify parameters that would. Yeah, exactly. It's very good questions.
00:46:07.212 - 00:47:04.450, Speaker A: Yeah. And essentially, we found that it was relatively easy for a simple model to get the selective upreciation of MgMT in response to TMZ. And again, we found that kind of similar to the yes, going too fast. With the bacteria models, we had to have these kind of positive feedback loops between the cell growth and the gene expression. But with the MgMT models, with the cell death included, we found that it wasn't necessary actually to include these positive feedback loops, which we found that was an interesting difference. But we also looked at essentially varying the noise. We would start from a parameter set that would give us this selective upregulation of MGMT in response to the reference protein.
00:47:04.450 - 00:47:40.910, Speaker A: And then we would look at varying the MgMT mRNA noise levels. And we would kind of vary two parameters. So we've defined the noise in terms of the coefficient of variation squared. And because this is a kind of constitutive gene expression model, it's essentially a birth DeF model. So it's a kind of poisson process. And, you know, we can write down analytical terms for the mean level of mRNA. And we could essentially then vary by decreasing b one, we would increase the level of mRNA noise.
00:47:40.910 - 00:48:12.220, Speaker A: And we would then vary b two, which is the translation rate of the protein. And we kind of. Yes, above that process. Yeah, exactly. So we vary b one and b two to match the protein levels, while varying the mRNA noise levels. And essentially, we found that as we increase the mRNA noise, we would get this kind of nice increase in the level of what we call the phenotypic selection, or the mean level of MGMT to a reference protein.
00:48:12.380 - 00:48:16.484, Speaker B: Sorry, but the protein is not requestant process. So the mRNA is.
00:48:16.572 - 00:49:00.502, Speaker A: Right, right, true, true. Anyway, we looked at the mRNA noise and the skewness, and we found that these tend to influence the level of this genotypic selection. And this is just a quick look at the posterior distributions from the ABC study. These were the kind of parameter sets that gave us the selective upregulation of MGMT. And one of the key things that we found was that essentially the translation rate had to be high. It was always hugging the right hand side. No matter what fire distribution we used, it would tend to hug the right hand side.
00:49:00.502 - 00:49:39.962, Speaker A: And I think it was a low transcription rate and high translation rate were two of the key things that came out from our study. So this was kind of a basic MGMT model that I want to summarize briefly. We found that cell death resistance in GBM could be driven by MGMT without any need for genetic alterations. So active dose dependent increase of MGMT was observed in response to TMZ. And we found that sufficient noise and schema seemed to be needed. And also this high translation rate from the approximate bayesian computation study seemed to be necessary, too. And once again, repeating that point about the temporary survival strategy before genetic adaptation.
00:49:39.962 - 00:50:24.912, Speaker A: And then finally, I wanted to say that the major emission from this model is the methylation status of the MGMT promoter, which I started with saying, Washington, the most important thing. So now we have like ten minutes left. But anyway, so clinical studies. Oh yeah. On this MGMT promoter methylation status, one of the interesting things was a study around quite recently, 2020, I believe. Apologies, I didn't include the year, but there's a reference at the bottom there, if you can see it. What they found is that there was a downward shift in MGMT promoter methylation percentage from primary to recurrent GBM tumors following TMZ treatment.
00:50:24.912 - 00:51:51.272, Speaker A: Essentially, they had these cell line studies where they would show that as the concentration of TMZ increased, the percentage of MGMT positive cells would increase, and MGMT positive cells being unmethylated cells. So there's a shift from methylated to unmethylated MGMT cells, and they would also find the above proportion of live cells, which was handy data for us to include in the model, as also they're the average proportion of live cells in response to TMZ treatment. And we essentially changed our basic model here to then include different MGMT promoter methylation states, which, upon cell division could probabilistically switch to the other promoter methylation states. And for simplicity, we only included three promoter methylation states. So unmethylated, hemimethylated and fully methylated MGMT promoters. And the main assumption we had in our priors is that the transcription rate b one would essentially be highest for the unmethylated MGMT promoter and worse for the fully methylated MGMT promoter. With this addition of the promoter methylation status in this basic model, which had.
00:51:51.272 - 00:52:45.050, Speaker A: We're still using the fixed cell population, it has about 1012 parameters. It's still a very parsimonious, simple model. We found that the phenotypic selection of MGMT could occur independently of the methylation downshift. So that was something interesting we found is that the percentage of unmethylated cells could stay almost constant. I think it was a small increase, but we could see increase in the mean MGMT level relative to the reference protein. We also found that we could observe the promoter methylation downshift. So the switch from methylated to unmethylated MGMT promoters independently of a phenotypic selection, we can actually see almost reverse phenotypic selection, where the MGMT levels were actually lower relative to the reference protein in some regions of the parameter space.
00:52:45.050 - 00:53:36.150, Speaker A: I think we understood this based on the fact that the MGMT protein would be consumed in its acts of repairing the DNA damage. Finally, we found that we could observe MgMT promoter methylation downshift at the same time as the phenotypic selection of MgMT in other regions of the parameter space. So essentially, the model was very rich and we had these kind of three different loss terms that we use to capture these three very different modes of cell death resistance, as we termed them. And we're not going to be able to go through that. All but one of the key things, no matter how we defined I, the mode of cell death resistance, was the fact that the cell. Sorry. The protein translation rate always tended to be very high.
00:53:36.150 - 00:54:03.772, Speaker A: So if there was some way. Apologies. Yeah. If there was some way of inhibiting or targeting that translation rate of MGMT, this might be a viable way of overcoming this phenotypic selection or this kind of methylation downshift. Right. So let me just apologize that. Yeah, kind of spent too long at the beginning of the talk, not enough time at the end.
00:54:03.772 - 00:55:11.000, Speaker A: Anyway, self defense in GBM could be due to feed us to action methylation down shear for a combination of both. And there are many efforts underway to devise strategies to suppress MGMT levels to make GBM cells more sensitive to TMZ and our models. From our huge explorations of the parameter space, which was made feasible by this fixed population approach, we found that the translation inhibition would be an effective strategy to pursue. And actually, some recent studies by chinese group, which I haven't referenced here, have referenced my paper instead. I can show this paper of everyone, if they're interested. They're showing that there's some microrna that's expressed in our cells which may be possible to over express in cells, and that can directly target MGMT by effectively inhibiting the end result is it inhibits this translation of MGMT mRNA. And in patients who were expressing this microrna a little bit higher.
00:55:11.000 - 00:55:33.276, Speaker A: And what they found in this, I think it's the Chinese. Somebody helped me here. The CGGA. It's a Chinese. It's massive collection of patients. Is anyone familiar with the TCGA? Yeah, there's a chinese equivalent of that. And I apologize for not remembering exactly.
00:55:33.276 - 00:55:58.360, Speaker A: I'm going to have to look that up later and maybe tell everyone later. But they found that patients that were expressing this microarnia a little bit higher, we tend to live a bit longer. More suppression of this Mgmt mRNA. Sorry. Resisting cell death is a challenging hallmark of cancer. To overcome. Over 50% of GDM patients develop resistance to TMZ therapy.
00:55:58.360 - 00:56:47.290, Speaker A: Phenotypic selection of MGMT and a downshift in the methylation status of the MGMT promoter could provide time for dangerous mutations to accumulate. The literature is a little bit confused about what happens with MGMT expression promoter methylation following TMZ treatment. I think I mentioned that at the beginning, just from some burger, some experimental paper. They found basically that there's significant interaction between MgMT protein expression and TMZ therapy. So I think there was this positive link between the lateral MGMT protein and the effectiveness of the TMZ therapy. But they found that the full promoter methylation status didn't seem to play a role. And then other people say the opposite thing.
00:56:47.290 - 00:58:01.630, Speaker A: Experimentally, with these small sample size studies in mice, I think mathematical models can help elucidate these apparent contradictions. The underlying mechanistic model could be correct. It's just we're in different regions of the parameter space. So, as I think I said from the beginning, I think we should iteratively increase model complexity in line with the available experimental data. And maintaining computational efficiency enables things like Bayesian inference. And I just want to end with a few questions to the group, but I think Thomas already, I read these slides before Thomas's talk, and I wouldn't have included these questions otherwise. I was thinking, how does resisting cell death interplay with the other hallmarks of cancer? And anyone had any thoughts on that? Or could our models reveal unexpected connections between these hallmarks that are not immediately obvious? And yeah, one of the main things that I'm interested in is how these models might be able to suggest targeted treatments that might not be immediately obvious from just looking at the data.
00:58:01.630 - 00:58:05.140, Speaker A: And, yeah, thank you all for your time, and thanks all for the question.
