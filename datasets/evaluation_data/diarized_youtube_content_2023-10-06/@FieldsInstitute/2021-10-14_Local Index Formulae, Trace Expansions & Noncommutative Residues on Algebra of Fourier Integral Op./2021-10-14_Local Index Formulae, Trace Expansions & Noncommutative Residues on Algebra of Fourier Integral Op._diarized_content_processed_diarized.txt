00:00:03.480 - 00:00:22.314, Speaker A: Okay, so it's a great pleasure to introduce the third speaker this morning, Elmar Schro from Leibniz University and at Inanova, and I mean, he will talk about the local index formulae, trace expansions and non commutative residue on an algebra, Fourier.
00:00:22.814 - 00:01:08.878, Speaker B: So, Elmar, please, thank you very much for the introduction, and thanks a lot to all the organizers for putting together this beautiful conference. It's really been a great pleasure to attend this. What I'd like to speak about is joint work with Anton Savin from the people's Friendship University in Moscow. Okay, our motivation is the following. We consider a smooth closed manifold M. It could also be rm and the discrete group which acts on l tron of M by what we call quantized canonical transformations. Then we are interested in the index theory of operators of this form here.
00:01:08.878 - 00:01:57.154, Speaker B: So you have a finite sum of pseudo differential operators and these quantized canonical transformations that are called phison g. This seems at first a rather strange subject, but let me explain a little bit why this is interesting. Let me first say what I'm talking about. We have this quantized canonical transformations, and probably you remember from your physics course that a canonical transformation is a simple ectomorphism. So it's a diphtheromorphism of the cotangent bundle with the zero section removed. I indicate this by this little zero here, which preserves the symplectic format t star rm. So it's a symptomorphism, and in addition, it's one homogeneous.
00:01:57.154 - 00:02:47.930, Speaker B: So there's a natural r action on the fibers of t star m, and c respects this action. A quantized canonical transformation is a free integral operator which is associated with the graph of such a canonical transformation. If at the moment it's not clear to you what the quantized canonical transformation is, or what the freertical operator is, in this talk, it's mostly going to be about something really particular, and you don't need to know that. Okay, a few examples of canonical transformations that will come up. Of course. If you have a linear symplectic transformation, that's probably the easiest case of a canonical transformation. Another one comes up.
00:02:47.930 - 00:03:53.776, Speaker B: If you have your base manifold and you have a diffeomorphism on your base manifold, then you can lift this lithiumorphism to the cotangent bundle by this formula here that probably all of you have encountered one or another time. It naturally comes up when you look at the transformation of differential operators under different morphisms, and that's precisely what happens here. And the third example that's going to come up is when you look at the flow induced by a homogeneous function, real valued on the cotangent bundle. So again, I remove the zero section, so I don't say anything here. So it's homogeneous of tick bond in the fibers. Oops, sorry. So it induces a flow, and for every time that you stop the flow, you get a canonical transformation.
00:03:53.776 - 00:04:35.174, Speaker B: So that's very easy. Okay, why are we interested in the index theory of this form? Because it's a very general kind of index theory when you're based on pseudo differential operators. Let me give a few examples. Suppose you don't have a group at all, so you just have a pseudo differential operator. Then of course it's the classical index theory of pseudo differential operators. Okay, suppose your sum consists just of the identity here, and one of these five genes that also has a name. That's the Atiya Weinstein index problem.
00:04:35.174 - 00:05:22.006, Speaker B: And it's an interesting problem in that it was set up, I think, in 76, and the solution was given by Epstein, Melrose and Leichnam Ness and SVGan in about 2000. So there is an index formula for this operator here, but it's not really known whether there are any operators of index. Nonzero. Okay, you can do it a little bit different. And something very similar comes up in the work of beer and stromage. They considered a Dirac operator under the space time. And of course this is not an elliptic operator, so it doesn't essentially make sense to speak of an index.
00:05:22.006 - 00:06:10.044, Speaker B: But what you can do is the following. You look at the time slice, so you take two times t one and t two, and the one time slice, you impose a tier part of the boundary conditions, and on the other one just the opposite ones. And then you get a problem which is fretto and which is essentially of this type, apart from the projections that you put in. And this 5g then just is the propagator for the rag operator. And what has been studied very intensively is the case where these five g's are given by different morphin subs of the manifold. That's what I just mentioned before. They sometimes go under the name of shift operators.
00:06:10.044 - 00:07:25.342, Speaker B: And there's a wealth of literature on this. For example, Antonievich and Lebedeff had looked at this, Conan Moscovichi and Shantan, Dave and Denis Perrault, Raphael Ponge and many, many others. And when I was saying that this is a rather general index problem, it refers to the following. If you have something like this, and you want this to be in algebra, then you have to have an action of these three of these operators here on the pseudo differential operator, there's a theorem by Deutsche Martin Singer from 75 or 76 which says whenever you have an automorphism of the algebra pseudo differential operators, which preserves the order, so that's an additional condition, but then it's given by conjugation with the quantized canonical transformation. So in this sense, if you want to work with pseudo differential operator, there's not much more you could do. Okay, let me just shortly resume what we did before and why we came to what I'm talking about today. Of course you can introduce a notion of ellipticity.
00:07:25.342 - 00:08:37.854, Speaker B: So you get the invertibility of invert, sorry, ellipticity is the invertibility of a symbol, and the symbol then lives well just in the cross product of the continuous function s. That's the symbol of these dgs on which this group acts, the group that induces the five g's, right? So of course elliptic operators are threat term operators, otherwise the notion wouldn't make sense. What we can define, we can define localized analytic and algebraic indices for those, and they coincide. And in a very similar situation, Gokhovsky, the Klein and Nest obtained an algebraic index theorem for equivariant operators. And yeah, the problem is the following. For one thing, if you have these representations, then they might not be unique, and actually you might have different symbols for the same operator. This situation does not come up if g is amenable and the action is topologically free, but in general it does.
00:08:37.854 - 00:09:26.924, Speaker B: And also, of course, you think the algebraic index theorem of the Grokovsky decline and Nest should give the same index as this year. And everyone would say what else should it give? But it's not clear, and the situation is rather obscure. So what we did, we decided to look at a very concrete example where you can really compute something. And it turned out this was more interesting than we thought in the beginning. So our concrete example is the following. As a manifold, we take rn, then it makes sense for good reason. You don't work with the standard pseudo differential operators on Rn, but you work with these tubing types, pseudo differential operators on Rn.
00:09:26.924 - 00:10:06.712, Speaker B: The calculus is based on symbols that satisfy this estimate here. So you take the derivatives of a symbol and x and p, so the space variable and the variable in the fiber on the same level. So you estimate this by one plus the norm of x plus the norm of p to the order m. That's the order of the operator minus the sum of both derivatives. And we work with classical symbols, so they have an asymptotic expansion to homogeneous terms. And so they have principal symbols. And the principal symbols, of course, live on the coast sphere.
00:10:06.712 - 00:10:48.204, Speaker B: So the fear of dimension to n minus one and the cotangent space. Okay, these are the differential operators. And then we need some, some Fourier integral operators. We take particularly simple one. So for one thing, we take these Heisenberg bile operators that those are, those are similar to those considered by, in his talk here. So essentially, this is a shift operator. So you have a function u, you shift it by a, and you add the phase factor here.
00:10:48.204 - 00:11:35.634, Speaker B: So there's an e to the ikx. So read a function and then a pure constant factor from the two components of your variable z in rn. And you have this relation here. If you multiply tz by tw, then you get tz plus w with an additional phase factor, namely this one here. Okay, this is the first. They're very simple operators. And then to have something more complicated, we look at metaplectic operators, okay? And we don't look at all the metabolic operators, but we just look at the unitary subgroup represented by metabolic operators.
00:11:35.634 - 00:12:32.784, Speaker B: So how do you do this? We notice that t n has a complex structure simply by mapping x p to p minus ix. There's various ways to do this. And then gl of trn is the same as gl of c n. And here you have the unitary group in this. And, okay, you have to associate this to this metaplectic operator. So I explained what the metaplectic operator is. So the metaplactic operators are a subgroup of the bounded operators on L two, and it generated by the I to the I h, where this, or I should say h hat, where h hat is the y quantization of homogeneous real quadratic form on TCRn.
00:12:32.784 - 00:13:17.804, Speaker B: So there's a difference. Remember, in this example before had one homogeneous functions. But now, since space and the p variables are on the same level, you look at quadratic forms, so they're too homogeneous here. And, okay, these generate the metaplectic group. You can complexify the whole thing by just adding a phase factor of e to the I phi to this, where phi is any real. Okay, you have various ways of representing the metabolic group. It was probably introduced by lore.
00:13:17.804 - 00:13:48.544, Speaker B: And if you look at his books or the book of de Gausson, you find many other ways to see. But this is very convenient for what we do. And what we first notice is we start with the real quadratic form. And if we take the while operator associated to a real symbol, then you get the self adjoint operator. And this is of course very convenient, because then each of the ih hat is always a unitary operator. So that's quite practical.
00:13:49.604 - 00:13:57.340, Speaker A: There is a question in the chat, which is why complexify the group? What do we gain by doing that?
00:13:57.532 - 00:14:10.104, Speaker B: Because basically work with this UN and you see, okay, right. The whole thing becomes more complex now.
00:14:11.424 - 00:14:14.444, Speaker A: Okay. So I hope the answer satisfies the person.
00:14:18.864 - 00:14:37.284, Speaker C: Okay, is the motivation of complexification coming? Because physicists work with exponentials of the, of the iH, of the hamiltonian? Is this all physics motivated? Is mathematical construction?
00:14:38.444 - 00:14:58.084, Speaker B: Now we want to have a lifting of this thing and this works. Okay, you'll see in a second. We want to work with the unit here, operators, and we lift them through the complex metaplactic group. Is that just a few minutes? Maybe the next slide or the one after that?
00:14:58.244 - 00:14:59.604, Speaker C: Okay, I'll wait. Thank you.
00:14:59.644 - 00:15:42.884, Speaker B: Okay. But it's not for physical reasons in any case. Okay, if you have a metaplactic operator, then you get a symplectic matrix, and that's very easy. So you have a metaplactic operator, and suppose you take one of the generators, so this is this e to the ih hat, and then you have this quadratic form. This quadratic form gives you a hamiltonian flow and you stop the flow at time one and you get the symptomatic transformation. And here you have your symptomatic matrix in Gl of TRN. And actually this is rejection into the space here.
00:15:42.884 - 00:16:54.694, Speaker B: Okay. However, the metaplectic group is a non trivial double covering of the symplectic group. So we cannot represent the symplectic matrices by metaplectic operators. But what we can do is the following can represent the unitaries by them. Sorry. Okay, so if we identify Cn with t n, the unitary suggests the symbolic group intersected with the o, the orthogonal matrices, and you can generate un by matrices of this form e to the b plus ia, where a is a real symmetric matrix and b is a skew symmetric real n times n matrix. So this is just a standard representation of unitary matrices.
00:16:54.694 - 00:17:42.924, Speaker B: And the point is you can lift those. So you take a unitary and you lift it, and here comes the little c from the symplectic, from the metaplectic ones. By taking a lift of any lift of your metablactic operator, and you multiply this by the determinant of this g, and this is going to be a complex number in general. And the point is, if you do it this way, then it's well defined. So you start at the identity with the square root of one equal to one. And then you continue this path wise. And it turns out if you do a closed loop, then you arrive at the same point.
00:17:42.924 - 00:18:48.774, Speaker B: Basically, this means you go around two PI times and you get a sign of e to the two PI I. You take the square root that's a minus one, and the, the two p, the two operators that lie over the same symptomatic map, are also just differed by the sign. And, and this is why you get the same thing. Okay, you can write it also a bit more concretely. If you say, well, I have this quadratic form and it's given by this quadratic matrix, then the lift of this quadratic matrix is supposed to be the corresponding operators times this phase factor here. Or in a simpler way, the exponential minus ih hat multiplied by this phase factor here. So this explains, hopefully why we have this complex metabolic group.
00:18:48.774 - 00:18:51.014, Speaker B: It's okay.
00:18:57.194 - 00:19:00.734, Speaker A: I think you should go on. Yeah, okay.
00:19:03.634 - 00:20:35.264, Speaker B: What others might know, and what's very helpful in this concrete computations, is if you notice that you can generate the unitary operators by the orthogonal ones and one u one action. So when you see u one as a subgroup of u n, say, putting it just in the first slot of a diagonal matrix, then you can move this around by on, and you obtain all the unitary operators. And then you can look, what does this rg do? What's this representation do? And there is easy to see. Namely, if you have an orthogonal matrix, then this action is just the transformation by this orthogonal element. On the other hand, if you have something of this form e to the I phi, then what you get is an operator e to the I phi, and then you have, well, one half minus the harmonic oscillator in the first variable. So here we are only acting the first variable. So you only get the harmonic oscillator, the action in the first variable, and this you can represent.
00:20:35.264 - 00:21:32.574, Speaker B: Concretely, these operators are known as fractional Fourier transforms. So this, you can actually compute this. A nice paper by Hermande how to do this analytically. Correct. And the formula is generally known as melis formula. So if you don't have a multiple of two PI, a multiple of PI over two, then this is just given by this formula, this factor here, the square root of one minus I, the cotangent of phi divided by two PI. And then here comes basically your harmonic oscillator times the cotangent over two times, sorry, minus x one y one divided by the sine over this.
00:21:32.574 - 00:21:53.714, Speaker B: So these are known as fractional free transforms. You actually see, if phi is PI over two. Then the cotangent vanishes. So you have just this here, this factor one over square root of two PI and e to the I minus x one, y one.
00:21:53.834 - 00:21:54.066, Speaker A: Sure.
00:21:54.090 - 00:21:55.770, Speaker B: You get, and that's just a free transform.
00:21:55.882 - 00:21:56.970, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, sure.
00:21:57.162 - 00:23:25.704, Speaker B: Okay, so this acts on the pseudo differential operators by conjugation. You know, if you take a pseudo differential operator, you conjugate it by one of these rg, you get again, a pseudo differential operator. And actually for the principal symbol, you have this formula here where the principal symbol of the conjugate operator is, is given by the application of g inverse to the symbol. Okay, now let's go to non commutative geometry. And what already Henri Moscovici recalled in his talk is the Iskant's joint character that was first defined very abstractly for the case of a graded p summable spectrotripple. And the character was in the even case defined as an element of the even periodic cyclic homology. And it's very useful because if you take the, if you take any projection and you take the k class of the projection, then you get the index of the operator by pairing with this chain character.
00:23:25.704 - 00:23:34.176, Speaker B: Okay, the definition of this was based on the Dixmed race. And of course, it's very abstract.
00:23:34.240 - 00:23:40.508, Speaker A: So for dictionary trace, no, no, no. On the ordinary trace in the even.
00:23:40.556 - 00:23:43.372, Speaker B: Case, wasn't it tr, Mick, in your paper?
00:23:43.548 - 00:23:57.384, Speaker A: No, no. I mean, it is Auchiel class, which is a dixmet trace, but not the thing. The thing itself is a true trace. And that's why it's difficult to compute. If it had been a dictionary trace, it would be very easy to compute because it would be local.
00:23:57.684 - 00:23:58.500, Speaker B: Okay.
00:23:58.652 - 00:24:01.492, Speaker A: No, no, it's an ordinary trace, of course. Yeah, sure.
00:24:01.668 - 00:25:13.336, Speaker B: Okay. So the point is it's, it's difficult to compute. So what was the progress? Was the formula by the work by Kannon Moscovici, that has been improved a little later on by Hickson and Kerry Phillips, Randy and Sukhu Chev. Okay, what you have to do is your spectral triple has to be regular. So this means if you take an element of the algebra a, then both a and the commutator of a with d belong to the domain of all the iterators come iterated commutators with the absolute value of d. So the square root of d d. Also, you have to define an algebra of sort of pseudo differential operators, the smallest algebra of linear operators in the domain of all the powers of the absolute value that contain both the elements of a and the commutators for a with d, and disclose taking commutators with d squared.
00:25:13.336 - 00:26:10.088, Speaker B: You see in a second where this is needed. And in addition, for these, you consider the zeta functions that Henri Muscovici also introduced. So, for an element b in this algebra, you take the trace of b e to the minus two z for real part of z large. And you look at this thing first, it's holomorphic in a half plane, and then you can, in concrete cases, extended neuromorphically to see that was known in special cases. And so one assumes that this thing has simple dimension spectrum. So there exists a set f such that this thing extends metamorphically to c with at most simple poles in the set where you shift f by the order of b, because that's what comes up in concrete cases. And then the formula they gave.
00:26:10.088 - 00:26:14.484, Speaker B: Was there a question?
00:26:14.904 - 00:26:42.534, Speaker D: Sorry. Yes. Could we go back to the previous slide? So, in this definition of psi, shouldn't there be a modulus of t somewhere not in the definition of age infinity, but the derivations here. You mean this should somehow model the algebra of pseudo differential operators? Or different.
00:26:44.374 - 00:26:55.394, Speaker B: You think at one point they should be. Okay, it could be that I made a mistake, but I don't have the paper here right now.
00:26:56.654 - 00:26:57.914, Speaker D: Okay, okay.
00:27:02.174 - 00:27:03.034, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:05.534 - 00:27:09.964, Speaker A: I think the point was that the operators you wrote were more like differential operators.
00:27:10.134 - 00:27:11.848, Speaker D: Yes, exactly. Exactly.
00:27:11.936 - 00:27:24.044, Speaker A: You didn't have the inverse of the, you know, didn't have the parametrics, because you were taking commutators with D square, which are. So this will only give you differential operators. But that's fine. I mean, because the formula I mean, uses only that.
00:27:25.664 - 00:27:26.924, Speaker D: Okay, thank you.
00:27:29.184 - 00:28:52.798, Speaker B: Okay, so the theorem of Kanbaskovici says that the czech character that was defined before has a nice representative given by these, by these elements, by zero psi two, psi four, and so on, where these are given by the residues of, of zeta function. So in this case, you take the super trace, it's created, right, of a zero d to the power two minus two z, in the case of zero multiplied by z to the minus one. And for the larger case, by this rather more complicated formula, here you have the operators a zero, a one, up to a two k in your algebra. And you take the commutators first with D. So that's why d should all be there. And then you take from these, the commutators with d squared. So that's why you always also need those.
00:28:52.798 - 00:29:44.534, Speaker B: And then you multiply the whole thing by the absolute value to this power, so that you can actually define the residue in zero. And that gives you the tray that gives you this character here. And there's a scalar that comes in front that is here. This is the abstract formula ponch has shown, has applied this to the rack operators. There was more work for the agrarian case. Eventually this was settled by Penshan one. And there is also work by Landi, say, for index formula for su two.
00:29:44.534 - 00:30:34.328, Speaker B: So in our case, we do the following. We want to define a spectral triple for our algebra. So the algebra a is the algebra generated by these operators tz for z and c n, and these fractional Fourier transform for g and un. So you can compute the r's and the g's at the expense of changing the z. Basically, you can represent all these operators, all in such a form where you have a summation of akz to the power k with Ak and Z. Your Hilbert space is just l two with the forms. So you have a natural grading by the degree of forms and even or not forms.
00:30:34.328 - 00:31:10.542, Speaker B: And the Dirac operator acts between those. So it consists of, in this case, four entries. D and D are the usual operators on forms. And this is an operator that acts both on rn and on the form. So you have x Dx wedge and the contraction with x dx, which is x dxy star. So these act between these forms. Okay, it turns out that this is a spectral triple that meets the assumptions of Kanon Muskovici.
00:31:10.542 - 00:32:06.194, Speaker B: It's regular, it's finite summable, it has simple dimension spectrum. And in this case, we choose for the algebra, for convenience, a slightly larger algebra. So we take the algebra of all sums of operators, where dk is one of the Schubin pseudo differential operators, and that composed with these tz's and rgs and finite sums of those, it's a little bit larger than the one required by Konmaskovici, but that makes things rather better than worth. Okay, and then after a lengthy computation, you get concrete expressions for the Kanbaskovici co cycles. So we do the following. Suppose we have an operator of this form that I just had. So a sum of those of dk's.
00:32:06.194 - 00:33:33.594, Speaker B: Sorry, sorry, a sum of this here. So if the aj are these operators of this form, zjet, Zj, Rncn and Gj are unitaries, then it turns out this cycle is zero. If this mapping w goes to gw plus z has no fixed points, or k, this number here is larger than the dimension of the fixed point space. Okay? Or else, if this does have fixed points, then you basically have to integrate a certain form over the fixed point set and add this phase factor here and the phase factor here and this factor here. Okay, let me explain a little bit what happens. So you have this tz and the rgj. So you form this g by multiplying up all these dj's and m, in this case is the co dimension of the fixed point set.
00:33:33.594 - 00:34:24.394, Speaker B: Okay. So these e to e to the I five are the eigenvalues of g that are different from one. So it's unitary, it has decomposition as a diagram. It has a representation as a diagonal matrix with different eigenvalues. So these are the non one eigenvalues with corresponding eigenvectors e, sub j. Okay? And now you do something a bit more complicated. Namely, you multiply up the first j elements of these, of these group elements and apply this to this set j.
00:34:24.394 - 00:34:57.994, Speaker B: Add them up and you get the set. So this is the set that appears upstairs. Then the sigmas of the corresponding a minus ik are these forms here. So they are bond forms. And so these are the one forms you put together. E to the minus omega is the form constructed from the symplectic form. And the evaluation here is via the Beresian integral.
00:34:57.994 - 00:35:50.524, Speaker B: So the Beresian integral means you take an orthonormal basis, build the volume form, and then take the top coefficient of this, and these phase factors come in in addition. So it's rather concrete. Once you have an operator, you can precisely write down what it is. Okay, is this helpful? Yes, we have rather concrete expressions. In many cases of interest. One would be if you have a non commutative torus of any dimension. So you pick n elements in, in the complex plane that are linearly independent over q, and you consider the group g, which is given from the lattice that is generated by these n vectors.
00:35:50.524 - 00:36:48.626, Speaker B: And on this lattice you have. Okay, sorry. So yeah, you have these, these lattice, and moreover, you have these shift operators tb one to tbn with the corresponding commutation relations. So this is just an n dimensional analog of the classical two dimensional torus. For this, you have a precise expression for the Cherng con cocycle. Another example where you can compute it explicitly are non commutative c four orbifolds. So you take any positive k and you consider the group that is the cross product of l times c four, where l is the lattice spanned by k and ik.
00:36:48.626 - 00:37:25.124, Speaker B: So just a square lattice in C with the length k and z four acts on rotation by I. And so the algebra is generated by the operators u. That's the shift by k. The shift by I k and the rotation by I. This gives you the algebra. And of course, here you have the, from u and v, you have the non commutative torus. If you compute, if you compute the commutation relations, then you get the data for the torus to be minus k squared.
00:37:25.124 - 00:37:59.382, Speaker B: And on this, the rise act. Another example would be c six or befalls. You do something similar. You start with a positive number k and a vector of say 60 degrees. And then you take the lattice. So it's a triangular lattice that is spanned by k and k. Epsilon and z six acts on this by rotation.
00:37:59.382 - 00:39:05.176, Speaker B: So the algebra generated in this case by the tk, by the t epson k, so the one in the standard direction to the right and the one by the 60 degree angle, and then the rotation by 60 degrees, that generates the action. So again you have here an uncomputed torus from these two elements. And this time the theta is minus square root three times k squared over two. And our epsilon x on this. Okay, I should say these, I think Chakrabortyn Lucas also obtained local index formula for this case, but with different methods, not relying on the churn count cycle. Of course, non convictory have been studied by Kahn. These orbifolds have been studied by Eshdorf, lips and walters.
00:39:05.176 - 00:39:42.654, Speaker B: And there is also work by Fatisadi Luft and by taunch on this, and Czechobotti Louvre built on this and on work by Boltez. Okay, maybe that's enough for, for this. Let me come to the tracics patches. Okay, maybe some people would say this is completely clear. What we do is the following. You have one of these operators here. We choose an auxiliary operator, any pseudo differential operator, the Schuben calculus of order m positive.
00:39:42.654 - 00:40:25.624, Speaker B: And we assume that the principal symbol is positive and scalar. So if you have a system, then this would be okay. But we want the principal symbol to be scalar. One example that you could take is just the harmonic oscillator, this operator that we had before, one half x squared minus delta. Okay, what we know in the case of h zero, this is not necessary, but if you have a general operator, you might have to shift it a little bit. But, but then you know it's going to be invertible for all lambda in a sector. And the sector can have an angle as small as you want about the positive real axis.
00:40:25.624 - 00:41:38.102, Speaker B: And then what you get is the following. So that is resolvent expansion, the spirit of the work of Copen Sealy. So if you have a fixed u, w and an a and you look at the operator rg twa, you multiply this by the resolvent of h to the power minus k, and the power should be so large that the whole thing is trace class. Then, okay, this is just choosing this k large enough lens race class for all lambdas in the sector. Moreover, this is of course meromorphic near zero. That's easy to see, and this is the more difficult part. So if you let lambda tend to infinity in the sector, then you get an expansion, and the expansion has coefficient cj, and then minus lambda to the power is here.
00:41:38.102 - 00:42:16.670, Speaker B: And this m in this case is the complex dimension of the fixed PI set of g plus the order of a. That's what always comes in minus j. J is the running index of this sequence divided by the order of h. And then you have a minus k from this k here. So these are the terms you probably all know, say from the classical expansion. But what sometimes doesn't happen if you just look at Laplacians or differential operators, then you don't have these terms here. So these are logarithmic terms and integer powers.
00:42:16.670 - 00:43:36.398, Speaker B: So these might have in particular if the order of a non integer, just non integer parts. But this here will also come up in general, and these are just suitable coefficients. What turns out is that this coefficient c zero prime. So the coefficient of the log term with the power just minus k, so the same as this here. So the largest possible power, this independent of the choice of the auxiliary operator you choose, if it has the properties that we have, okay? Moreover, for the zeta function, we get the corresponding expansion. And this is due to the fact that this expansion that we have for the resolvent implies a decay of the zeta function at affinity. Okay, so we have that the Cta function is holomorphic in a half plane, namely, when the order of h times the real part of z is large into n plus the order of a, it extends mammoth into c.
00:43:36.398 - 00:44:32.396, Speaker B: That's fairly easy to see with poles in this set here. And if you multiply by gamma, then you get the following pole structure. So you have the standard poles in these points here, plus you have double poles at the negative integers, and these additional simple poles here. And these coefficients here that, sorry, that we have here, they're related to the coefficients that we had before by universal constant. So essentially these two things are equivalent. And in particular we have that the residue of the zeta function zero. So you have to take care of the factor here.
00:44:32.396 - 00:45:29.474, Speaker B: This is just this coefficient z zero prime that we have here, and it's the same as the one and the resultant expansion. Okay, if the fixed point set of this mapping, g plus w, so v goes g, v plus w is empty, then we have no pulse at all. And what we also have is that we have rapid decay along the vertical lines where, wait. Okay, when we take c, the real part of z, then we look at the trace that we considered before. It has rapid decreased uniformly for c in compact intervals. Okay, you have to stay a little bit away from the real axis, so the imaginary part of that is larger than one. Okay.
00:45:29.474 - 00:46:27.762, Speaker B: And similarly, you have a heat trace expansion. And the fact that these three things are equivalent is a fact, actually is a consequence of the existence of the result of the expansion, as cop and seelie have shown. So here you studied the sort of the generalized heat kernel where you have e to the minus th multiplied by your operator, and then you have such an expansion. Okay? So the interesting point, of course, that's clear to everybody is this residue at zero. Because we have a group action here. We define a localized non commutative residue, sorry for the localized at the conjugacy class of your group g. And the residue then is just given by the order of h.
00:46:27.762 - 00:47:16.178, Speaker B: This is just to norm the whole thing times the residue of the corresponding operators. Localized, okay, so you just sum over those that lie in the controversy. Class of a given element. So call this element w bar g bar. Then you have a localized residue at this thing by just taking those elements that are in the conjugacy class. Okay, and these, of course, from what we saw before, these are just the corresponding elements either in the resolvent expansion or in the zeta function expansion that you get. And, okay, one might try to look at how this is.
00:47:16.178 - 00:48:02.444, Speaker B: And, okay, we tried to look at a specific example, and it turns out it's rather intransparent. So you have your unitary, and the unitary can always be diagonalized. So we assume it's diagonalizable and it has eigenvalues different from multiples of PI over two. Call these phi one to phi m one. Then it can have eigenvalues I eigenvalues minus I eigenvalues minus one and eigenvalues one. Okay, so this is how it generically looks. If it's not of this form, you can easily bring it to it.
00:48:02.444 - 00:48:41.494, Speaker B: That's not a big problem. And then you can compute what comes out. And I wouldn't swear this formula is correct, but roughly, it should be like this. So you look at the residue of this thing, and what you get is essentially you integrate the minus two m five part. So that's the eigenspace of this thing here. So the complex dimension is m five, real dimension is two m five. You integrate this over the co sphere of the corresponding dimension and integrate over Dx and multiply by this factor here.
00:48:41.494 - 00:48:46.574, Speaker B: So the fact is a bit messy. You see the contributions from the various parts.
00:48:47.394 - 00:48:52.574, Speaker A: How do you choose the square root of I one minus tangent of phi j.
00:48:54.634 - 00:49:04.362, Speaker B: Just from fi equal zero on? What you do is you do the Taylor expansion, and then that gives you the.
00:49:04.498 - 00:49:13.254, Speaker A: Okay, you do Taylor expansion, yeah, but you have to choose square root of I. Then. I mean, you take exponential I PI over four, or something like that.
00:49:15.194 - 00:49:17.334, Speaker B: I'd have to look it up. I have to pay by any.
00:49:17.914 - 00:49:18.774, Speaker A: Okay.
00:49:21.694 - 00:50:09.724, Speaker B: Okay. What's maybe interesting is most of the trouble is caused by the simple shift here. You see, you have this interesting factor here that you will always have, and all the rest are just phase factors coming from this thing here. This here I've not even defined yet, because it's a more complicated expression than the other terms. But these are all just phase factors. And the contribution comes from this, from the eigenspace of value one. So if you reduce the case where the shift vanishes, then this simplifies to this factor here.
00:50:09.724 - 00:51:08.980, Speaker B: And if you simply divert that, that when g is one, then you just get the integral of the minus two and five term over the corresponding sphere. And this is the analog of Azyci's residue in the shubin calculus. So in this case, the formula is certainly correct. And it comes down to this. And so what you expect to be true is that for every joist of a controversy, class, this localized, noncommutative residue is indeed a trace. And this, I should mention, is of course, closely related to what Chanton Daveed, where he considered not these rgs, but only operators that are induced by different morphism of the base manifold. Okay, that's it.
00:51:08.980 - 00:51:09.944, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:51:14.844 - 00:51:24.404, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, Elmar. I was muted. Okay. Thank you for this great talk. Yes. So, I mean, let me ask if there are questions.
