00:00:00.880 - 00:00:27.545, Speaker A: Okay, 10:30. So the deadline was yesterday for assignment one. I'm going to post the solutions sometime later this week, either tomorrow or the next day. I have at least most of the solutions. I'll probably finish writing them all. And I posted assignment two yesterday or this morning? This morning. And it's due three weeks from last night because of reading week.
00:00:27.545 - 00:00:40.841, Speaker A: Right. And then assignments three, four and five are all going to be. You're going to have two weeks to work on each one of them. All the assignments from now 2 to 5 are going to be 5 problems each. And. And there's reading week next week. There's no lectures next week.
00:00:40.841 - 00:01:05.115, Speaker A: Right. So after today we meet again on Monday the 17th. I'll put all that on canvas and Piazza. Okay, so we started talking about Jacobi fields. Let me remind you the last thing we did. And then later today I'm going to remind you something else we did from Monday. But the setup is as follows.
00:01:05.115 - 00:02:42.419, Speaker A: Let Gamma be a geodesic segment of a geodesic be a geodesic. Then a vector field J along Gamma is called the Jacobi field. Jacobi field. If dt squared j plus r of j gamma prime gamma prime equals 0 for all t in 0a. This is the Jacobi equation and we showed last time. This is a second order linear ode. And hence, given initial conditions j at time 0 and the covariant derivative along the curve of j at time zero, there exists a unique smooth solution, okay? And moreover, the space of Jacobi fields along gamma is 2N dimensional, where N is the dimension of the manifold.
00:02:42.419 - 00:04:18.365, Speaker A: And the reason for that is the way we saw this, and I'm repeating it because I'm going to use it to make the next observation is the idea is let E1 up to EN be an orthonormal basis of T gamma 0m and extend. And by parallel transport along Gamma, we get E1 of T up to EN of T is an orthonormal basis of T gamma T m for all time in 0a. And then the idea was you can write, because this is a frame, it's an orthonormal basis. We can write J of t as some sum of df, sorry, fi of T E I of t. And then plugging it into the Jacobi equation, we found that you get a second order. The Jacobi equation is a second order linear system of ODEs. ODEs for the FIS, okay? It expresses the second derivatives with respect to time of the FIS in terms of some linear combination of the FIS, where that those coefficients depend on the curvature and the geogenesis.
00:04:18.365 - 00:05:09.751, Speaker A: Okay, but in particular, the reason we get two linearly independent solutions is a basis for the space of solutions is given by taking the solutions where FI of 0 is, let's say delta I K and DFI DT at 0 is 0. This is. This is n of them. And the other ones are FI of 0 is 0 and DFI DT at 0 is Delta IK. This is the other end. So what I'm saying is for each of these choices you get a Jacobi field. And any Jacobi field is a linear combination of these two n Jacobi fields.
00:05:09.751 - 00:06:33.035, Speaker A: So these have dtj at 0 equals 0 and j at 0 is ek. And these have j at 0 is 0 and dtj at 0 is ek. So that's just a review from last time, but I wanted to repeat it because I want to observe that we always get two obvious solutions to the Jacobi equation. And that's because the velocity vector field gamma prime of the geodesic gamma is itself parallel along gamma. So since dt of gamma prime equals zero for a geodesic, we could take for example en to be gamma prime in this construction, right? What I needed, in other words, I choose my orthonormal basis en of T, en of T is gamma prime of T. I need my orthonormal basis of T gamma 0. So I just choose gamma prime of 0.
00:06:33.035 - 00:07:43.355, Speaker A: If this is a unit speed geodesic, Gamma prime of 0 is a unit vector. And therefore I can take that to be one of these vectors and extend to north normal basis. So then the solutions, the solution with fi of 0 is delta in and dfidt at 0 is 0 gives j is gamma prime as a Jacobi field. So let's verify this. So, because if j is gamma prime, then DTJ is dt gamma prime, which is zero. Well, that means dt squared J is zero because dt of zero is zero. And what about R of j Gamma prime gamma prime? Well, that's going to be R of gamma prime gamma prime gamma prime, and that's zero, because this is Q.
00:07:43.355 - 00:08:46.048, Speaker A: Okay? So hence j equals gamma prime always satisfies the Jacobi equation. And this, this solution has j of 0 is gamma prime of 0 is not equal to 0 and dtj of 0 is 0. So we always have one solution whose initial covariant derivative is 0, which is given by the velocity vector field itself. But we also get from this class of solutions another one. The solution with FI of 0 and DFI DT of 0 is delta in is j of T is t times gamma prime of T. If I take a. I'll show this in a second.
00:08:46.048 - 00:09:28.943, Speaker A: If I take any vector field along a curve and I multiply it by a function of T, this is still a vector field along the curve. So let's see why this is a Jacobi field. It's the same kind of calculation, except this one has different properties. So, so if J is t gamma prime, then what's dt of j? It's not zero this time, because I have to do dt of this function of t times gamma prime. And that's going to be D by dt of T times gamma prime plus T times DT gamma prime. And this is 0, this is 1. So this I get gamma prime.
00:09:28.943 - 00:10:40.035, Speaker A: And therefore dt squared of J is dt gamma prime is zero. So in this example T times gamma prime, it's not parallel along Gamma, but its second covariant derivative is 0 and R of t gamma prime gamma prime gamma prime. This is still zero because this is linear. I can pull this out. Okay, so hence j equals T gamma prime satisfies the Jacobi equation with j of 0 is 0 this time and dt j at 0 is gamma prime of 0 is not equal to 0. Okay, so whenever we have a geodesic, we already know what two of the Jacobi two of the linearly independent Jacobi fields are the velocity vector field itself and t times the velocity vector field. I'm going to make an observation and then we're going to see that somehow these are the trivial ones that we want to just look at the rest of them.
00:10:40.035 - 00:11:22.795, Speaker A: So now that we found those two solutions, let's observe the following lemma. If I take. Well, let me not state as a lemma. Let me just do the calculation. Let's write V prime for dt of v double prime for dt squared of V, etc. And it's just going to be easier. So when I do covariant differentiation of a vector field along the curve is always fixed.
00:11:22.795 - 00:12:31.975, Speaker A: I'm going to use the prime notation. So what happens if I do D by dt of j gamma prime? Well, by the Leibniz rule, when we covariate differentiate along a curve, an inner product of two vector fields along the curve, that's going to be j prime gamma prime plus J prime gamma double prime, right? And remember, gamma double prime is dt of gamma prime is zero for geodesic, okay, so this is zero. And what's d squared by dt squared of j gamma prime? I have to take the first time derivative and differentiate that and Again, when I differentiate the gamma prime because it's a geodesic, I'm going to get zero. So this is j double prime gamma prime. But by the Jacobi equation, I'm assuming J is a Jacobi field. By the Jacobi equation, this is minus R, j gamma prime, gamma prime, gamma prime. So that's minus the Riemann tensor applied to j gamma prime, gamma prime, gamma prime.
00:12:31.975 - 00:13:06.515, Speaker A: And that's zero by the symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor, because it's skew in those two. So. Sorry, that's a parenthesis skewing those two. So this function of T J inner product gamma prime, the second derivative is zero. So hence j gamma prime as a function of T has to be some constant plus another constant times t. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it should be J.
00:13:06.515 - 00:13:23.523, Speaker A: Thank you. I made a mistake there. That was. You're right. Differentiate one and not the other. Okay, so what we've shown is that this function of T has second time derivative equal to zero. It's a smooth function of T on some interval, right? Therefore it's a constant plus a constant times t.
00:13:23.523 - 00:14:09.261, Speaker A: And what is this constant? This is j gamma prime at time zero. And what's C2? It's D by DT of J gamma prime at zero, which we saw is just J prime gamma prime at zero. Okay, So I can write this as j of zero gamma prime of zero. And this one is j prime of zero, gamma prime of zero. Okay, so what we observe is if that Jacobi field is initially orthogonal to the to the velocity of the geodesic at that point. If this is zero, then C1 is zero. And if it's an if it's covariant derivative at times zero is orthogonal to the velocity, then C2 is zero.
00:14:09.261 - 00:15:05.685, Speaker A: So this is the zero function. That means the Jacobi field will be orthogonal to the velocity for all time. So If j of 0 is orthogonal to gamma prime of 0 and j prime of 0 is orthogonal to Gamma prime of 0, then j of T is orthogonal to Gamma prime of T for all T. Okay, so we found two linearly independent solutions which were. Which were not orthogonal to Gamma prime, right? Because they were in the direction of gamma prime. They were Gamma prime itself and T times Gamma prime. And we know that the space of solutions is given a solution is determined by its initial conditions, right? And we just have to prescribe the initial value of J and its covariant derivative at time zero.
00:15:05.685 - 00:16:32.215, Speaker A: So the punchline of this is hence the space of Jacobi fields along gamma, which are not orthogonal to gamma prime of t for all T is exactly spanned by gamma prime and T gamma prime. So these are parallel to Gamma prime for all T. Okay, so really what we've shown is if you have a. So these two Jacobi fields are somehow not interesting. They're always there for any, for any geodesic. The ones that are interesting are the ones which are given by the other initial conditions. So to get the other initial conditions, if we chose our en to be gamma prime, that means we definitely need FI of FN of 0 to be 0 and F and DFN DT at 0 to be 0.
00:16:32.215 - 00:17:46.740, Speaker A: And that means that the initial value will be orthogonal to en gamma prime and the initial covariant derivative will also be orthogonal to en. So if that's true, then it stays orthogonal to gamma prime for all T. Okay, so, so we will only care about Jacobi fields such that j of 0 and j prime of 0 are orthogonal to gamma prime of 0. And these are called normal Jacobi fields because we just saw from this observation on the, on the previous board that if we have a Jacobi field with those initial values, it stays orthogonal to the velocity vector field for all time. Okay, so let's do an explicit example. One person asked a question at the end of last lectures how easy it is to compute Jacobi field. It's not because you need to know, you know what the curvature is explicitly, that's hard to compute from the metric.
00:17:46.740 - 00:18:22.365, Speaker A: And then you need to know what the geodesics are explicitly, and that's usually hard to do. But in examples where, where the metric is very nice, so the curvature is very nice, then usually the geodesics are very nice, then you can do something, right? So only in very special examples can you explicitly solve this equation. It doesn't matter. You don't really need. One thing you learn in differential geometry is you give up the hope of finding explicit solutions to geometric differential equations, right? You just want to prove the solutions exist and they have certain properties. And that's often enough to do what you want to do. But let's look at an example.
00:18:22.365 - 00:19:35.523, Speaker A: So let mg be of constant sectional curvature K, which is some real number. Then we know that the riemann curvature tensor, the 04 tensor, is k times x inner product w Y inner product z minus x inner product z, y inner product W. That was from a couple of lectures ago. Let's let gamma be a unit speed geodesic. So gamma prime of T has length one for all t. And let j be a Jacobi field along gamma that is normal in the sense that we just described. So we will see that we can, we can find out exactly what these are.
00:19:35.523 - 00:20:15.515, Speaker A: Right? We know there's a 2N dimensional space of Jacobi Fields and we know what two of them are a basis for. Two of them, sorry, two linearly independent ones are gamma prime and T gamma prime. So this space is 2n minus 2 dimensional. The space of normal Jacobi fields is 2n minus 2 dimensional. So we're going to figure out exactly what these are. Okay, so remember, this means that j of 0 and j prime of 0 are orthogonal to gamma prime of 0. So let's plug it in to the Jacobi equation and use the fact that we're assuming we have constant sectional curvature.
00:20:15.515 - 00:21:22.815, Speaker A: So what is R j gamma prime gamma prime with V. Let V be any vector field along gamma. Let's compute what this inner product is by definition of the Riemann curvature tensor. This is R of j gamma prime gamma prime V. And because we have constant sectional curvature, this is K times jv gamma prime gamma prime minus j gamma prime gamma prime V. But we're assuming that this is a normal Jacobi field. And we proved somewhere here that that means that j inner product Gamma prime is 0 for all T because it's normal Jacobi field.
00:21:22.815 - 00:22:11.995, Speaker A: And we also have that this is one because it's unit speed. So what do we get? This is equal to I can, I can bring the k inside. This is a constant. This is k times j inner product V. So this guy, their inner product with any V is the same as the inner product of kj with V. But that means that R j gamma prime gamma prime is kj. So hence the Jacobi equation in this case is j double prime plus k times j equals zero.
00:22:11.995 - 00:22:51.605, Speaker A: Sorry, J double prime. Yeah, that's right. Plus k times j equals zero. That's the Jacobi equation. And we can easily solve this equation explicitly. Remember, the idea was you express things in terms of a parallel frame along your curve, right? By taking an orthonormal frame and parallel transporting it. So the solutions, the solutions are obtained as follows.
00:22:51.605 - 00:24:18.149, Speaker A: So let's let W be in T gamma 0 of M, with W orthogonal to the initial velocity. And let W of T be the parallel transport of W along Gamma from gamma of 0 to gamma prime of T to Gamma of T. And what we get is that j of T has to be. Well, there's three possibilities depending on the sine of K. There's sine of t square root of k over square Root of K times W of T if K is positive, T times W of T If K is 0 and hyperbolic sine of T times the square root of minus K over the square root of minus K if K is negative. Okay? So if K is negative, then minus K is positive. And I can take the square root.
00:24:18.149 - 00:24:58.435, Speaker A: So it's very easy to see that. Oh, sorry, what am I saying? This is, this is a solution. These are solutions with initial, initial value 0 and initial derivative W. So these are the Jacobi fields with j of 0 equals 0 and j prime of 0 equals w. Okay, so I'm not finding all the normal vector fields. I'm finding the normal vector. Sorry, not finding all the normal Jacobi fields.
00:24:58.435 - 00:25:51.511, Speaker A: I'm finding those whose initial value is zero. Okay, that's half, that's the basis for half, half of it. So I'll tell you that now. So if you can see that if you put T equals zero, you get zero, and then you just want to show that the second derivative is minus K times the function times J, right? But because W is parallel, right? If I take dt of this, that term is going to be zero because W is parallel. So I just have to differentiate the coefficient as a function of time twice, right? And if I differentiate sine this thing twice each, I'll get. I'll go from sine to cosine to minus sign, and then there'll be a 2, 2 root ks that come out, right? So I'll get a K over root K with a minus sign. So the K over root K is going to give me a root K.
00:25:51.511 - 00:26:38.565, Speaker A: Let's just do the. Let's just do one of them, right? So J double prime is minus root K squared sine of t root k over root k times W of T. And this is because WW prime is zero and it's parallel. And then what's this? This is equal to minus K times J of T, right? Because this whole thing is still J. So I have a minus K, and that's what I needed. You have a question? Yeah, yes. Yes.
00:26:38.565 - 00:27:05.545, Speaker A: I forgot to write the W of T because it doesn't make sense otherwise. So. And you can see, right, the same thing here. What I want is because W is parallel, right? It's, it's. It's basically coming along for the ride. It's constant. So I need a function, since I want J Prime of 0 to be W, I need a function of T whose value at t equals 0 is 0 and whose first derivative at t equals 0 is 1, and that's exactly.
00:27:05.545 - 00:27:59.873, Speaker A: Sorry, what we want is so J of T is some F of T, W of T. That means we want F double prime plus kf equals zero with F of zero is zero and F prime of zero is one. And those are the solutions. Yep. Yeah, well, it really, it's really showing you. So the question was that this seems to be related to the usual PD that gives you harmonic oscillations, right? And that's why we get the strig function. It's really showing you that on a manifold with positive sexual curvature, the Jacobi fields are going to want to, if they start with zero, they're going to want to become zero again.
00:27:59.873 - 00:28:47.561, Speaker A: Right? This one starts at zero, but it's never zero again and neither is this. Okay? And when we see that Jacobi fields have something to do with varying geodesics through geodesics, this is really going to be related to the fact that when you have positive curvature, geodesics want to come back and join up, to join back up to each other. Because you'll see that a Jacobi field is, we'll see that later in the course. The Jacobi field is also a non trivial. A non 0 Jacobi field corresponds to a variation of that geodesic through geodesics. So if the, if that Jacobi field vanishes at two points, there should be a family of geodesics going between those two points. Right? And of course, we know that that can happen if the points are close enough together because of the uniqueness of minimizing geodesics in a normal neighborhood, but far enough away, it'll happen.
00:28:47.561 - 00:30:00.285, Speaker A: And on the sphere which has positive sectional curvature, we know that if you have geodesics starting out from the North Pole, eventually they will join again. So you have a whole family of geodesics by taking these meridians which have the same initial and final points. So that kind of phenomenon only happens really when the space is somehow positively curved and it doesn't happen for negative or zero curvature. So we're going to see that in the coming weeks. But then another answer to your question is just that curvature involves two derivatives, right? If you want to look at the simplest case, you want to look at the simplest second order linear ode, it's going to be that. Okay, all right, so we're going to use these several times later in the course, right? But, and you can, you can also write down what the, what the Jacobi fields are on, on this manifold of constant sectional curvature whose initial, whose initial derivative is some, whose initial value some vector and whose initial derivative is zero. And you just have to change this one and this zero, right? And you're going to get cosines and hyperbolic cosines and things like that.
00:30:00.285 - 00:31:34.735, Speaker A: Okay? So recall from last time that if V is a smooth curve in the tangent space at M, with. This is abusive notation, but we're going to do it anyway. This Curve at time 0 is some fixed vector V and V prime of 0 is W. Then if I define J of T to be D by DS of Sigma at 0t, where Sigma of S and t is x p of tvs, then this J is a Jacobi field along gamma of T, which is Sigma of 0, T, which is exp P of TV. This was the initial motivation on Monday for the Jacobi equation. We said start with this family in S and T, this parameterized surface. Look at the velocity in the S direction at S equals 0.
00:31:34.735 - 00:32:11.787, Speaker A: We get a vector field along gamma and we show that that satisfies an ode. Okay? And also that's a Jacobi field. Also, what is J of 0? If we look at the definition of J, that's going to be d sigma ds@00. So that's the same as d by ds@s equals 0 of sigma of 0, t, which is d by ds@s equals zero. What happens if I put. What have I done? Sorry, that doesn't make sense. S0.
00:32:11.787 - 00:32:40.819, Speaker A: I'm differentiating with respect to S, so I can already set T to be zero. So this is going to be sigma of S, zero is XP of zero. And this is just P for all, for all S. So this is zero. So this Jacobi field, which was the initial one we found on Monday, which motivated the introduction of the. Of the ODE, satisfies that its initial value at time 0 is 0. So what is.
00:32:40.819 - 00:33:22.167, Speaker A: Let's see what it's. What is JJ prime at zero? Because we know that once we know what j of 0 is and j prime of 0, there's only one Jacobi field. Without initial data. There exists one and there's only one. So this part of the book in docarmo, he makes it unnecessarily convoluted. Let's compute. So what is J.
00:33:22.167 - 00:33:49.275, Speaker A: U. Prime of zero? Well, we need. So J of T was the sigma DS at zero T. Okay, so we need to compute what dt DTJ at zero is. And that's going to be. Well, let's compute without. Before we evaluate at zero, let's compute dt of that.
00:33:49.275 - 00:34:35.048, Speaker A: So that's going to be. Again, this is from last Time when we motivated this discussion. The formula for this was exp star at TV applied to tw. Okay, this is from last time. And this is a linear map. So I can pull this T out of the linear map. So this is going to be dt of T times X P star TV applied to W.
00:34:35.048 - 00:35:10.545, Speaker A: So here I just use the fact that push forwards are linear. And now I have some vector field along gamma times T and I'm taking dt of that. So the first thing I do is differentiate this guy. So it's going to be exp star tv applied to W&T times. Some stuff where I differentiate this and I don't care what it is because I'm going to evaluate it. At T equals zero. It's going to all die because of this.
00:35:10.545 - 00:35:48.655, Speaker A: So JJ prime at 0 is DTJ at 0. It's going to be. This part becomes 0 because of that T. And what about this? When I put In T equals 0, we know that X p star at the origin is the identity. We proved this a long time ago. So this is just W. Okay, so what have we shown? We've proved the following.
00:35:48.655 - 00:37:00.555, Speaker A: We have an explicit formula for the Jacobi in terms of the exponential map. We have explicit formula for the Jacobi field with a given initial value and initial covariant derivative. So we've proved the following corollary. Let Gamma be a geodesic. Geodesic. The Jacobi field J along gamma with j of 0 equals 0 is j of t is exp star t gamma prime 0, t j prime 0. Right? Because remember, v is gamma prime of 0.
00:37:00.555 - 00:38:04.615, Speaker A: And we just calculated over there that, that if we took, if we took this for J, then W is just j prime of zero. So if you want the geodesic with an initial J prime to be something, and you know, you know that your geodesic is gamma. So what you do is you take, you take the initial value of j prime that you want multiplied by T and apply X p star at T gamma prime zero. That's a vector field along gamma and it's exactly a Jacobi field with j of 0 equals 0 and j prime of 0 equals j prime of 0. Okay? So we're going to use that formula probably a few times in the rest of the term. The way, the way Docarmo worded that section was very weird, right? He says somehow this is. He says, look, we constructed a Jacobi field here with initial value 0 and initial covariant derivative equal to W.
00:38:04.615 - 00:38:36.317, Speaker A: And he says that this is the only way to do it. Well, we know that's the only way to do it because it's the ode. So if you have the initial conditions, there's a unique solution. So you just have to compute what is J Prime at 0 for this J. And that gives you that corollary. So the next thing we want to do is we want to investigate how the Jacobi fields are related. I mentioned this on Monday to the spreading of geodesics.
00:38:36.317 - 00:39:23.985, Speaker A: So now we'll relate the spreading of geodesics. I'm putting in quotation marks. Geodesics starting from P with the curvature at P. So when we introduce curvature, someone asked, well, what is the geometric meaning of sexual curvature? When we get to chapter six after reading week, we're going to see another geometric meaning of sectional curvature. But today we're going to see and see one that's related to geodesics. It's going to tell us that the sign of the sectional curvature is. And I also motivated this intuitively.
00:39:23.985 - 00:39:49.731, Speaker A: On Monday, the sign of the sectional curvature is going to be telling us whether geodesics, starting from a point, want to come closer together or spread further apart. Okay, so let's state the proposition. Prove it. This is going to be a fun proof. I like this proof. And then interpret it. And that's probably where we're going to.
00:39:49.731 - 00:41:02.267, Speaker A: Well, we'll see what we're going to get to. Okay, so here's the proposition. Let P be a point in M. Let gamma be a geodesic starting at P, and let V be the initial velocity of this geodesic. Let W be a tangent vector at V to TPM, which, remember, is canonically TPM with W equals 1, length of W equals 1. So we take a unit vector, another unit vector. So V doesn't have to be a unit vector here, but if it's parameterized by unit by arc length, it will be.
00:41:02.267 - 00:42:17.735, Speaker A: But it's just some vector. And we take W to be a unit vector in tpm. But we want to think of it as being tangent to TPM at the point V. And let J be the Jacobi field along gamma given by J of T is exp p star at TV applied to TW for T in 0A. So by the previous corollary, by the Corollary, J at 0 is 0 and J Prime at 0 is W. It's the Jacobi field. With this initial data, then the Taylor expansion of the function take J of T and take its norm squared about T equals zero is.
00:42:17.735 - 00:42:36.963, Speaker A: So this is. This J is a vector field. Along gamma, the norm. This is the norm coming from the metric. The metric is smooth, J is smooth. And therefore this is a smooth function of T. So we can tailor, expand it as a power series in T about t equals zero.
00:42:36.963 - 00:43:38.495, Speaker A: What we get is that J of t norm squared is T squared. So already this tells us that the that it starts at the quadratic term minus 1/3 r of VW v times t to the 4th plus higher order terms, okay? This means that when you divide them by t to the fourth and you set T to zero, this still goes to zero. So this O of T to the fourth divided by T to the fourth goes to zero as T goes to zero. And you can see that this has something to do with sectional curvature already, right? So that's what we're going to prove now. And it's exactly, you know the way you're going to guess how to do it, because we know how to compute the coefficients of a Taylor series, right from calculus one. And we know that this J is a Jacobi field. So its second derivative satisfies some equation.
00:43:38.495 - 00:44:15.825, Speaker A: The Jacobi equation. This is going to be fun. Let's go through it. So, first things first. We know that j of 0 equals 0. That implies that j of 0 j of j squared, the norm of j squared at 0 equals 0. Because this is just j of 0 squared.
00:44:15.825 - 00:44:53.095, Speaker A: So the that's why the constant term isn't there. We also know that j prime of 0 is w and j double prime is minus rj gamma prime. Gamma prime. This is the Jacobi equation. And therefore if I evaluate this at time zero, I get zero because j of zero is zero. So that this is, this is a tensor, right? So evaluate this at time zero. I just evaluate each of these things at time zero and that one is zero.
00:44:53.095 - 00:45:54.495, Speaker A: So what do we have? We have J of zero is zero, J prime of zero is W. J double prime at zero is zero. Okay? So now as I said, we have the function I want to tailor, expand is this inner product of J with itself, right? That's zero at time zero. What is its first derivative? Well, by the Leibniz rule, well, metric compatibility. Really, by metric compatibility, this is 2 JJ prime, okay? And hence this thing at time 0 is 0 because that guy vanishes at time 0. Now let's look at the second derivative. To compute the second derivative, I have to differentiate the first derivative.
00:45:54.495 - 00:46:34.405, Speaker A: So again, I'm going to have metric compatibility. When I differentiate the J here, I'm going to have a J prime squared. And when I differentiate that one, I'll have a JJ double prime. And so if I compute what is the second derivative at time zero, that one's going to be gone because both of these vanish at time zero. But this is equal to W and that's a unit vector. So this is two. So we already know a big chunk of this.
00:46:34.405 - 00:47:25.435, Speaker A: So if I let F of T beyond JJ at T, then what do we have? We have F of T is f of 0 plus t times f prime of 0 plus t squared over 2 times f double prime of 0 plus higher order terms. We just showed that this is 0 from here. We just showed that this is zero from here. And this one is equal to T squared because F double prime at the origin is two. So the two cancels with the one half. So we've got, we've got up to here. We need to show that the, the T cubed term is zero and that the T quarter term is what it is there.
00:47:25.435 - 00:48:03.063, Speaker A: So now we need the third derivative. So, so what's, what's next here? Right, we have t cubed over 6 times f triple at 0 plus t to the 4th over 24 times the 4th derivative at 0 plus. So we need the 3rd and 4th derivatives. So let's compute F triple. Go back and you look. This is F double prime. This is.
00:48:03.063 - 00:48:32.945, Speaker A: Maybe I should write this. So let's write it over here. F double prime is two J prime J prime plus two JJ double. Okay? So I'm taking the prime of this. So from here I'm going to get two more. I'm going to get J prime J double, right? Because I'll have a J double times J prime plus a J prime times J double. There's two of those.
00:48:32.945 - 00:48:53.527, Speaker A: It's symmetric. And there's a two already. And then here I'll have a J prime J double plus JJ triple. Okay, Now I evaluate this at time zero. Well, that one's not zero, but this one is. This one is. This one is right.
00:48:53.527 - 00:49:22.285, Speaker A: J prime is not zero. And we don't know anything about J triple. But there's always. Every term has something that vanishes at time zero. So F triple is zero. So we, we know there's no T cubed term. We have 1, 1 more left to compute the fourth derivative of F.
00:49:22.285 - 00:50:26.367, Speaker A: So I have to differentiate the third derivative. So when I differentiate that guy, I'm going to get 4J double squared plus 4J prime J triple plus 4F plus 2. Oh, I could have combined these, right? I have, I have six of these. This is equal to six J prime J double plus two JJ triple. Let's do that. So I'm going to get six of these plus six of those plus two J prime J triple plus two jj four, three. Okay, and these combined.
00:50:26.367 - 00:50:51.201, Speaker A: Anyway, so what is the fourth derivative at time zero? This is going to be zero. This one's going to be zero. We don't know what the fourth derivative is, but we know J is zero at times zero. And these are the same. So we're going to get 8J prime 0J triple prime of 0. So we need to. You see here, if we're going to.
00:50:51.201 - 00:51:27.135, Speaker A: What, what goes here is the. Is so F to the fourth.01 over 24 times T to the fourth is going to be 8 over 24 is 1 third. This is W J triple prime at 0 T to the fourth. So to complete the proof, we have our 1 third. There's a minus sign. And what is this? This is equal to.
00:51:27.135 - 00:52:24.835, Speaker A: This is equal to minus R of VW V inner product with W and the 2 minus signs cancel. So I've written this as an inner product with W. So it's enough to show. It remains to show that J Triple prime at 0 is RVWV. Once we can show this, we'll be finished. Okay, so we need a preliminary claim. If we had talked about how to differentiate arbitrary tensors, not just vector fields, using the levitic connection, this claim would be obvious.
00:52:24.835 - 00:53:04.205, Speaker A: For those of you who know how to do that, it's immediate. But since we didn't spend time talking about that, I have to do this as a separate claim. So before we can prove this, I claim that if I look at R of J, gamma prime, gamma prime. This is a vector field along the curve. If I evaluate dt of this at time zero, then that's the same as R J prime, gamma prime, gamma prime at zero. Okay? So think about what this is telling us. We want to somehow differentiate this whole thing.
00:53:04.205 - 00:53:25.175, Speaker A: Okay? There's going to be. If you want to think of this as a product of things, there's an R, a J, a gamma prime and a gamma prime. Because gamma is a geodesic, the derivatives of these should go away. Okay? There should also be a derivative of R somehow. But that means we're not differentiating the J. But JJ at times zero is zero. So that's why there's no derivative of R term on the right hand side.
00:53:25.175 - 00:54:05.177, Speaker A: So all that should survive is the term where we differentiate the J. That's how you should think about this. So let's make that Precise. So proof of claim. Let Z be any vector field along gamma. So I'll go, I have to go to the other board because this will take a few steps. So let's compute.
00:54:05.177 - 00:55:02.215, Speaker A: If I, I want to compute this guy, eventually I want to compute that just at time zero. That's what I care about in the claim. But let's use metric compatibility to write this as D by dt of R of J gamma prime, gamma prime Z minus R of J gamma prime gamma prime dtz. Right? Because if you expand this out, the first term you get is this, and then the other term is that. And eventually I'm going to let T go to zero and that's all I care about. So this zero at T equals zero. So I'm going to ignore it from now on.
00:55:02.215 - 00:55:49.817, Speaker A: It's going to be irrelevant. It's going to drop out when I set T equal to zero. And that's because this guy vanishes at T equals zero. So now by the properties, the symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor, I can, I can swap the first two with the last two and I can also interchange the last two and. Or to pick up a minus sign and the first two to pick up a minus sign. So this is the same as R of Z gamma prime, gamma prime, J plus stuff that I don't care about. So what did I do? I brought this here and this here.
00:55:49.817 - 00:56:57.511, Speaker A: So I have a gamma prime Z J gamma prime. And then I swap the first two and the last two get two minus signs. Now let's use metric compatibility again. And this is going to be DT of R of Z gamma prime gamma prime J plus R of Z gamma prime, gamma prime, DTJ plus stuff, which I'm ignoring because it's going to be zero and T equals zero. But now this guy, even though now I'm still differentiating the curvature, I don't care about this term because I've moved the J over here. This will also vanishes at T equals zero because j does. And I'm not differentiating the j here.
00:56:57.511 - 00:58:05.603, Speaker A: Okay? So now again, by the symmetries of R, I can write this as R of dtj gamma prime, gamma prime Z plus stuff that I don't care about. So again, I did the same thing. I swapped the first two with the last two and then I flip them, and I flip them. Okay, and now let T equals zero. What do we get? We get dt of R of J gamma prime, Gamma prime at 0 is equal to, sorry, inner product with Z at 0 is equal to R J Prime Gamma Prime, Gamma prime at 0 with Z. Okay, and that's exactly what I want to prove. I want to prove that this thing is equal to this.
00:58:05.603 - 00:58:37.775, Speaker A: Well, I just proved that it's inner product with any tangent vector at that point is the same. And because the inner product is non degenerate, it follows. So this is for all z0 in t gamma 0m. So the claim is proved. Okay, so now we're ready to finish. We have the claim. What do we want to show? It's still here.
00:58:37.775 - 00:59:34.235, Speaker A: We want to show that. Okay, so what is j triple? Well, it's dt of j double. But by the Jacobi equation, this is dt of -r j gamma prime, gamma prime. So by the claim, if I only care about j triple at time zero, the minus sign comes out. I want this thing at time zero. This is equal to minus R J prime at zero gamma prime zero gamma prime zero. And that's equal to minus R of wv, which is R of vw.
00:59:34.235 - 01:01:01.641, Speaker A: Good, that's what we wanted. Okay, so the proposition is proved. We see that the Taylor expansion of the norm squared of this Jacobi field, the first, the first non zero term is a T squared and the next one is a T to the fourth and it's involving curvature. So I'll repeat the results. So we've shown that If j of 0 is 0 and j prime of 0 is w, then J of t squared is t squared minus 1/3 r of VWV t to the 4th plus higher order terms. Okay, so corollary of this, if I just take the square root, then this is T minus 1 6. Sorry, I'm jumping ahead.
01:01:01.641 - 01:02:01.991, Speaker A: Suppose gamma is unit speed, so that the norm of v is 1 and that w is orthogonal to V. Okay? Then this thing R of V W W V is exactly K of L, where LP is the span of V and W. So the proposition we proved was general, right? V was just the initial velocity, the initial velocity of this geodesic. And W is the initial covariant derivative of the Jacobi field which vanishes at time zero. But now we're saying let's parameterize the that's by unit speed. So V is a unit vector. And let's choose W to be orthogonal to V.
01:02:01.991 - 01:02:59.707, Speaker A: So we're looking at a normal geodesic. So in this case J is a normal geodesic with initial value zero. And then because, because V and W are orthonormal, this is exactly the sectional curvature of the two plane spanned by V and W. So I haven't so then J of T squared is just KLP T to the 4th plus higher order terms. And I can take the square root and that's going to be T minus 16 klp cubed plus higher order terms. Okay, so the proof. Well, this I already did here.
01:02:59.707 - 01:03:46.575, Speaker A: I just observed that this is. This is equal to this. Right? And why is this true? Well, if I want to take the square root of T squared plus T squared times something, I can factor out the T squared and I get 1 plus B, sorry, P to the fourth. So this 1 plus T squared B and that's equal to 1 plus T squared over two B plus higher order terms. I'm taking the square root of this guy. I'm taking the square root of this. I factor out a T squared and I take the square root.
01:03:46.575 - 01:04:01.825, Speaker A: So I get a T times this. Something is wrong. Looks like I've got. I should have a 1 12th. This should be a 1 12th. Oh, no, sorry. Yeah.
01:04:01.825 - 01:04:21.515, Speaker A: This is a 1 3rd. And I get a half of that. So that's 1 6. Okay. Okay, so it says that the norm of J of T is to first order is T. And the next correction is cubic. And basically Apart from this 1 6, it's minus the sectional curvature.
01:04:21.515 - 01:05:28.975, Speaker A: Okay, so let's see now what this means geometrically. I'll draw a picture. There haven't been that many pictures today, unfortunately. So I'll draw a picture and we'll see how we should think about this. Okay, I'm definitely going to need my colors now. Okay, so what does this mean? So let's draw a picture again of tpm and let's draw a picture of M. So here's the origin.
01:05:28.975 - 01:06:14.665, Speaker A: The exponential map is taking the origin to P. What we have here is we have this curve V of S which is passing through this is V, which is V when S equals zero. And we have. I haven't used green yet. We have all these rays. Let's look at all these rays going from the origin to this orange curve. And the exponential map will take this two.
01:06:14.665 - 01:07:24.355, Speaker A: The orange curve. The orange curve here is going to be X P of V of S. This blue one is gamma, which is X P of tv. And these green ones are the images of these rays. Okay, so for sigma of st is x p of t versus with s in some neighborhood of 0 and t from 0 to some delta such that this is defined. We know because the domain of the exponential map is open. If I choose this point here, then I'm going to be able to move along this curve at least for a little bit and all the way from the origin up to here.
01:07:24.355 - 01:08:42.725, Speaker A: So I can even take delta to be at least one because V is in the domain where this is going to work. So this is where V of 0 is V and V prime of 0 is W. Got the typo. So this velocity here is W and that's going to have some velocity here. The raise T goes to TV of S for fixed S. For fixed S deviate from T goes to t of v0 with a velocity d by ds of t. V of s at s equals 0.
01:08:42.725 - 01:09:14.653, Speaker A: And that's equal to. If I take this and I differentiate with respect to S, the T comes out and I get a v prime of 0, which is t times W. And that's just T. Okay, so in this picture, if I'm looking at these green rays, these are, these are all rays coming out of the origin. They're going to map to geodesics there. And I want to see how are these spreading along this orange curve as S varies. So I want to find their sort of rate of change.
01:09:14.653 - 01:10:31.823, Speaker A: The speed that they're changing at s equals 0 in this s direction. So I differentiate that curve for fixed T with respect to S at S equals zero. I get this yellow vector and the length of that vector here is T. Okay, but what's happening on the other side on M the geodesics, T goes to X P T V of S, which is, which is sigma of S. And T deviate from T goes to X p T V which is sigma of 0, t with the velocity, with the speed, let's say. So I want, that, I want to look at D by ds. So what is, what is sigma? I take, I take for a fixed T.
01:10:31.823 - 01:11:06.825, Speaker A: If I'm, if T is fixed, I'm gonna, I'm gonna look at this orange curve and I'm gonna pass through the exponential map and I want to look at the velocity of this orange curves at S equals zero. So that's this yellow vector here. So that is going to be. Well, what is this? Remember, this is just J of T. So what I really want to compute is the norm of J of T. But we just showed that that's equal to T minus 1 6. The Gauss curvature of that plane T cubed plus higher order terms.
01:11:06.825 - 01:11:36.035, Speaker A: Okay, so this calculation that we did over here is telling us what is the length of this yellow vector here. Okay. And we know that this one has length T. So this orange curve here, I guess is, is t times versus. And this this one is x of t times versus. I was drawing it at t equals one, right? But we did the calculations here for any T. So this is T times versus.
01:11:36.035 - 01:12:08.529, Speaker A: These are spreading. These geodesics are spreading at time T with respect to S. They're spreading with this, with this. These rays are spreading with a speed equal to the norm of this vector, which is T. And they're mapped by the exponential map to these green geodesics passing through this orange curve. And the rate for fixed T, the rate at which they're spreading as a function of S, is the norm of this yellow curve. And that's to first order, to leading order.
01:12:08.529 - 01:14:11.189, Speaker A: It's the same as it was on the, before applying the exponential map. But the leading, the first correction term is cubic and T, and it involves this sectional curvature. So hence if K of LP is positive, then the geodesics spread apart less than they do in flat space. Because that picture there, the picture in TPM with the fixed inner product gp, that's, you know, the, if we pick an orthonormal basis, then we really just have Rn with the Euclidean metric. So what's happening in flat space? What would happen in flat space is what's happening on the left hand side the picture in tpm, because we know the geodesics are just straight lines. Okay? And in fact, one thing you'll prove on assignment two is that if you, if you're in a flat space, right? If the sectional curvature is identically zero, the exponential map is the identity and is defined on all, on all of our end, right? So the, the picture, these two pictures are exactly the same picture in flat space, okay? And if the sectional curvature is negative, the geodesics spread apart more than they do in flat space. And this is all, all of this for sufficiently small T, right? It doesn't tell us anything really far away, but it just says that near, near T equals zero.
01:14:11.189 - 01:14:54.355, Speaker A: If you look at these geodesics, for small enough T, how do they, how are they spreading apart as a function of S? So, so it's exactly this, you see, because of this minus sign. If K is positive, then this, for small enough T, this will be less than T, which is what the flat space would give you. And if K is negative for small enough T, this becomes negligible. This would be bigger than T, which is what you have in flat space. So if you know what the geodesics look like in hyperbolic space, they're spreading out from each other. And on the sphere which has positive curvature, they're coming Back, Okay. And we're going to make this more precise over the next few weeks.
01:14:54.355 - 01:16:39.425, Speaker A: Okay? So this is probably good time to stop because the next thing is slightly different direction. So let me just say what we're going to do after reading week. So after reading week. So on Monday, October 17, we'll investigate the relationship between Jacobi fields and critical points of the exponential map, that is points these in TPM such that XP star at V which goes from TV of tpm, which is TPM to T XPV of M is singular, right? This push forward is a linear map from here to here. And these are both N dimensional. So it's exactly going to fail to be invertible if and only if it has a non trivial kernel by rank nullity. And we know that when V equals 0, this is the identity, so it's invertible.
01:16:39.425 - 01:17:22.911, Speaker A: And by smoothness, when V is close enough to zero, it's going to be invertible. But if you go far enough away, it could be that this fails to be invertible. Okay? So it doesn't. It no longer gives you a diffiomorph. So we know that the exponential map has some domain where outside that is not even defined, right? But within that domain we know that it's pushed forward is invertible at the origin. So by the inverse function theorem, there's some neighborhood of the origin which might be properly smaller than its domain, on which it's a diffeomorphism, okay? And at every point in that neighborhood, because the push forward of a diffeomorphism is an isomorphism, this will be invertible. So this will.
01:17:22.911 - 01:18:24.405, Speaker A: These are not critical points. But at some point we leave the region where X lower star is invertible and that's outside of the domain on which X is a diffeomorphism, okay? And these points, these critical points of the exponential map are going to be related to Jacobi fields. We'll see that if you have such a point, then there's going to be a Jacobi field which is not zero, but which vanishes both at the origin and at P. And at this point that's going to characterize these critical points of the exponential map by the existence of a Jacobi field that vanishes at two points. Okay? So we're going to do that and a few consequences of that when we come back after reading week, I only need about 35, 40 minutes to do that. We'll be done with chapter three and all the. All of assignment two is based on, sorry, chapter five all of assignment two is based on chapter four and five, right? So you can already do about half of it.
01:18:24.405 - 01:18:45.215, Speaker A: Actually, you can do more than that. I think you can do two thirds of it now over reading week. And after the first half of Monday, October 17th, you'll be able to do the rest of it. And it's due on Tuesday, October 25th. Okay, so we're going to end two minutes early today, and we'll all celebrate that and take a week off.
