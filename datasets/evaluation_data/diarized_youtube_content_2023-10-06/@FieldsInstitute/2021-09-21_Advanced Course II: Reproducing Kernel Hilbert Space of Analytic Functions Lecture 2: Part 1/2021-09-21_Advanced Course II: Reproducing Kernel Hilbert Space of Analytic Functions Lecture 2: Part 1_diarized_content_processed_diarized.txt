00:00:03.000 - 00:01:05.572, Speaker A: Okay, thank you, Marco, for reminding me. So, we saw the definition of absolutely a continuous function. F is ac. If there is a function integrable such that f of x has this representation, it can be written as fl zero plus integral from zero to x g of t dt. And it's more than being continuous, it's a very strong property. And based on the le vector of integration, now we know that f prime at point x exists and is equal to g of x almost everywhere. And using this, we define our first subalf spaces, I mean, call it h, such that f defined on zero one.
00:01:05.572 - 00:01:39.674, Speaker A: And we studied the real version of this. The complex version is similar with two properties. First, this g in general, we saw it in l one. We put more restriction. We assume that f is ac, and moreover, this derivative, which has to be in l one by definition. Now, we assume that is in l 20 one. So its square is integral.
00:01:39.674 - 00:02:30.904, Speaker A: And we had two boundary conditions. And we add f of zero equal f of one equal to zero. That's the definition. I will play with these conditions in my second and third example. And even if we have time in the fourth one, and we'll see that it has a huge effect on calculation of k, that the kernel, we saw that the h is rkhs. I don't go into detail. And also, for the evaluation f at point x, we have this representation here, and f of zero is zero.
00:02:30.904 - 00:03:46.208, Speaker A: So one of them is integral from zero to x g t dt or f prime t dt. Both are correct. And, and the other one, since f of one is also zero, so it's one of them is integral from zero to x f prime t dt, and another one is integral from x to one f prime t dt with a minus here, because f of one is also equal to zero. And using these two formulas, we saw that f of x is less than or equal to root of x normal f in h, and also at the same time is less than root of one minus x normal f in H. So, both show that the evaluations are continuous. That is considered here, but none of them is optimal. I mean, neither the first one nor this one is optimal.
00:03:46.208 - 00:05:18.734, Speaker A: And they just give an upper bound for the norm of ex. As an evaluation from h into r, both show that is less than or equal to the minimum of root x and root one minus x. So, but what is the norm? What is the norm of ex? And here is, we realize the power of Rkhs. I recall that we saw, after giving the definition, that the norm of x is equal to, indeed the norm of kx in h, which is the same as k of x root square. So we need to find kernel either in the little form or the capital form, they are the same. And then we immediately, by evaluating on the diagonal, we obtain the norm of ex. So the biggest question is what is kx? And for this we need some tools from distribution theory to find the kernel.
00:05:18.734 - 00:07:22.316, Speaker A: From here it's the new material. So let's start with f of x equal to integral from zero to x f prime t no sorry, not this one. We know this is true, but we start from the fact that f of x is given by f inner product with kx, and by definition this is the integral from zero to one f of t prime k of x prime t dt and the integral is well defined. I remind you that in the definition we assume that f prime and k prime both are in l two, so the product stays in l one. There is no problem, the integral is perfectly well defined. If we know that k has a second derivative, we can do integration by part and write this as f of x or f of t k x prime t t from zero to one minus integral from zero to one fotkx double prime t dt for momentarily, assume that everything is okay, k is smooth, and we can do integration by parts. If we do this based on the assumption again on the boundary values at point t equal to one and t equal to zero, f is equal to zero.
00:07:22.316 - 00:08:53.994, Speaker A: So this term disappears is equal to zero and what remains is integral zero to one minus integral from zero to one f of t k x prime double prime t dt true and but even if k is not two continuously differentiable, we can give a meaning to this. Using the theory of distribution. The identity f of x is equal to integral from zero to one ftk x double prime t dt with minus is also valid for functions which are infinitely differentiable with support inside the open interval. That's the theory of distribution. So we do not want to go into detail of this, but at least we can assure you that this is true whenever f is in c infinity of zero one and of compact support. And moreover this restriction is also important. Support of f is inside the open interval, it doesn't touch the boundaries.
00:08:53.994 - 00:09:48.582, Speaker A: And we can do this, we can do pretty much what we call integration by parts. But now we look at this as a distribution. So this is the derivative of this as a distribution. And for this now we have f of x equal to on one hand, integral from zero to one f of t k x double prime c dt and at the same time, we know that this is also given by the Dirac delta measure anchored at point x. So we can also write this as zero to one f of t d delta x. Delta x is the measure that attention. The way I write here is the way mathematicians write.
00:09:48.582 - 00:10:56.406, Speaker A: I write D of the measure in some engineering books, instead of this, they write delta x of t dt. So you need to be careful which text you are looking for. And so if we compare this, we see that k has to satisfy this identity, which is a differential equation in the sense of distribution theory. And now we want to solve this. How to solve this? I just borrowed this fact from distribution theory. Again, which is not difficult to prove even I can leave it as you as an exercise to prove. Consider the function u defined this way.
00:10:56.406 - 00:11:33.724, Speaker A: For t positive equal to 114, negative equal to zero. And for precisely at point t equal to zero, it really doesn't matter. You can define it the way you like it. So u of t is defined for t positive 140, negative zero. And for example, to have it write continuous, I put identity here. It is called a heaviside step function. It's a very important signal in engineering, engineering, in electrical engineering.
00:11:33.724 - 00:12:44.936, Speaker A: So, heavy sight function. And with the interpretation I gave about the exercise is this, show that u prime with respect to t. If we forget the distribution theory and we consider what we have studied in analysis one or two, our answer would be u prime is equal to zero, for t is strictly positive, and also for t is strictly negative. And u prime at the .0 does not exist. That's a perfectly correct answer if we stay in the context of classical derivative. But with respect to the one that we consider for distribution, this is equal to dt and delta t.
00:12:44.936 - 00:13:37.644, Speaker A: And delta t is the same as delta zero t, the one anchored at the. .0 and if you look at, for example, any book on circuit analysis in electrical engineering, they really define delta to be a function, not a measure or a distribution. And the way they defined it, they say that it's a function which is equal to zero everywhere, and at the .0 it's equal to infinity. So that's the way they define delta t. And then ask, how do we use this, this function? They say the way to use it is by this formula, integral of f of T.
00:13:37.644 - 00:13:40.824, Speaker A: Delta t dt is equal.
00:13:40.864 - 00:13:42.084, Speaker B: To f of zero.
00:13:52.434 - 00:14:50.222, Speaker A: And with this, it works very well. They solve many interesting questions in circuit theory, and also from historical point of view. It is interesting to know that way. Before Laurent Schwartz introduced distribution theory, it existed among, for example, people in physics or other science, and they used it with naming generalized functions, so functions like this. And then Laurent Schwartz, I mean, tried to and succeeded to give a mathematical basis to this. And nowadays, us, instead of writing delta t dt and treat it as a function, we write, write a d of delta t, and we treat it as a measure or distribution, and everything has a very solid foundation. So that's as a comment.
00:14:50.222 - 00:16:03.974, Speaker A: So just show that u prime is equal to delta. And if you shift it by x u, x is defined the same as u is u of t minus x. So is the same step function, but jump is at the point x, and. Oh, what's happened? I'm sorry. I don't know why my cryon stopped. Technical problem. Oh, really doesn't want to work.
00:16:03.974 - 00:16:38.294, Speaker A: My apologies. Please give me a couple of minutes. I go downstairs to see if the technician can help me. My apologies. I stopped the recording. Now, where is the recording? Pose.
00:16:40.034 - 00:17:39.584, Speaker B: Thank you. And I go here. Computer. See, one virus has changed our life. Even our teaching is different. Okay, we are good now. So, are we good to continue?
00:17:49.184 - 00:17:49.928, Speaker A: Yes.
00:17:50.096 - 00:18:52.732, Speaker B: Okay, thank you. So, we were here, we arrived at the point that we wanted to solve this differential equation. K double prime x is equal to minus delta x. And to do this, I define the function u, or the shifted version ux, with the property that we know u prime is equal to delta x. So, this is the tool that we use, or borrow from, from distribution theory. For not going into detail. There are some ways, for example, Laplace transform other methods that we can use and solve this equation.
00:18:52.732 - 00:19:47.338, Speaker B: But with this, we have a shortcut, and we can easily find the solution. So now we see that kx is equal to minus ux prime. So, take the antiderivative of both sides. Once it's kx prime is equal to minus ux plus a constant. And note that the constant is with respect to t, because the operations are with respect to t. And so c can be a function of x. And indeed, we will see that it depends on x, but c doesn't depend on c, does not depend on t, but it may depend on x.
00:19:47.338 - 00:20:33.044, Speaker B: And there is another difference here. From now on, even though kx prime is equal to minus ux, plus a constant is, again, another ordinary differential equation for distributions. But we can treat them as the differential equation that we know from now on. From the first derivative, kx prime is a well defined function. Ux is a well defined function. So it is a regular ode. But both interpretations end up to the same thing, and we need to do one more antiderivative to find the answer.
00:20:33.044 - 00:21:49.356, Speaker B: But to do so, recall the definition of ux. The definition is like this is equal to one with minus in front is minus one plus c if t is bigger than x. If t is less than x, u is zero. So it's just c. And so when you do the antiderivative one more time, kx of t becomes ct. It's better to write c minus one t, c minus one t plus another constant, which I called it my note e. This is for t bigger than x, and for t less than x, is just a constant which becomes c times t plus another one, which I wrote d.
00:21:49.356 - 00:22:37.290, Speaker B: Again, C. D and e are constant with respect to c, but they can depend on x. So what do we have here? We have a function, kx. When we look at the graph of k from zero to x and from x to one, we see in both cases there are lines, a line like this, but. And like a line like that. And now remember that we want to solve it such that at the end of the day, k of x needs to be in h. So there are some properties or conditions to be respected.
00:22:37.290 - 00:23:48.574, Speaker B: And for sure, k has to be continuous. So, one important property that we need to observe is that k of x is continuous at the point t equal to x. In other words, we need to have something like this. And this is equivalent to say that kx at the point x plus is equal to kx at the point x minus according to, to these definitions. Therefore, oh, too much. What's happened? Therefore, if you put t times to x from x bigger than x and t times x from t less than x, we see that this is equivalent to c minus one. X plus e is equal to cx plus d.
00:23:48.574 - 00:24:25.512, Speaker B: So cx with cx simplifies. So minus x plus e is equal to d. So it's a relation between two constants, e and d. And at the same time, you see that these constants have to depend on x. So we can get rid of one of them here. Either write e in terms of d or d in terms of e, and this gives us this formula, which I need later on. Kx is equal to.
00:24:25.512 - 00:24:58.740, Speaker B: Now, despite that, here I wrote strictly less than x and strictly bigger than x. Now I can write this formula is equal to ct plus d if t is less than or equal to x, and then c minus one t plus x plus d if t bigger than.
00:24:58.772 - 00:24:59.644, Speaker A: Or equal to x.
00:24:59.684 - 00:25:48.814, Speaker B: In both cases, I can put x. Now, I have a function like this, which at the point t equal to x is well defined, is continuous. And now we have to respect other condition. In this case, in this example, we also want that, we also want that kx at the .0 to be equal to zero and kx at the .1 to be zero, because it has to be in this space h. And now we try, we put in the equation here, and we find our c and k x at the .0
00:25:48.814 - 00:26:31.450, Speaker B: is this one is for t less than or equal to x, is simply equal to d and this has to be zero. And kx at the .1 is c minus one times one plus x plus d. This one also want to be equal to zero. So this implies c minus one plus x is equal to zero. So c is one minus x, which is okay. C just doesn't depend, depend on t.
00:26:31.450 - 00:27:26.092, Speaker B: So we see that our k is obtained, is equal to one minus x times t. This is for t less than or equal to x, because it's simply c times t and d is equal to zero. C is one minus x times t. And for t bigger than or equal to x is d is zero. C minus one is minus x. So it's minus x, t plus x, which I write it as one minus t times x. So that's the, the formula we obtain for x.
00:27:26.092 - 00:27:33.524, Speaker B: And now you see that the advantage of this, this is also, is equal to k of t and x.
00:27:33.564 - 00:27:34.544, Speaker A: If you wish.
00:27:35.204 - 00:27:45.864, Speaker B: The formula for capital x. You remember. Yeah. There is a question.
00:27:46.404 - 00:27:50.064, Speaker C: Is it one minus xt or one minus xx?
00:27:54.444 - 00:28:24.742, Speaker B: I go here. Yeah. C for this case is c minus one. C minus one is minus x. So it's minus x times t plus x plus d, which is zero. True. And when I factorize x is become, it becomes one minus t times x, which I wrote here.
00:28:24.742 - 00:28:55.962, Speaker B: Yes, true. Okay. And the same for the other one. And now, a very important formula which I will use several times. I mentioned before, this technical problem happened. Norm of x as a functional from h to r is equal to. Yeah.
00:28:55.962 - 00:30:23.714, Speaker B: Is equal to norm of kx, which is equal to kx at the point x, root of this or root of k, x and x. So any of this you can use here and see immediately that in our case, norm of the evaluation functional as a functional form from h to r is equal to root square. Evaluate this at point x is one minus x times x. That's the precise value for the, for the norm. And recall that with estimation. So recall that we had estimations that the norm of x is bounded by one of them less than root x and by another one root of one minus x, and none of them, you see that now is optimal. The optimal one is this one, which is the best and shows the power of rts.
00:30:25.094 - 00:30:25.982, Speaker A: I see.
00:30:26.118 - 00:30:28.234, Speaker B: Let me see what is in the chat.
00:30:28.934 - 00:30:29.454, Speaker C: Okay.
00:30:29.494 - 00:30:35.634, Speaker B: No, it's not a question. So, yes.
00:30:37.534 - 00:30:45.094, Speaker C: While you had got a formula for kx of t, where there were three constraints, c ed.
00:30:45.434 - 00:30:45.874, Speaker B: Yes.
00:30:45.914 - 00:31:06.894, Speaker C: And you only use two properties, kx being continuous, and the boundary condition, to, yes, evaluate. But kx being h, then there are many more condition it satisfy. It should be absolutely continuous. And it is.
00:31:07.434 - 00:31:38.974, Speaker B: It is indeed, because it's something linear. I mean, the kx has a very simple formula. If I go back. Yeah, you see over here and over there, kx is linear. So when you take the derivative, is a constant and constant, two different constants. In general case, it's okay, it doesn't matter. Two different constant is in l two.
00:31:38.974 - 00:31:59.874, Speaker B: So what were our conditions for being in h, the derivative being in l two, that's one thing, being continuous and is equal to zero. At the end points, all of them are satisfied. Now, do you agree?
00:32:00.294 - 00:32:02.574, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:32:02.654 - 00:32:22.444, Speaker B: But you're right. The point you raised is a good point. You say that, and it should be considered in other examples. We will see. What you say is that we have a differential equation. That's good. We obtain the general solution.
00:32:22.444 - 00:32:57.140, Speaker B: That is good, too. And now it doesn't mean that automatically. What we obtain is a member of the space we have to satisfy, or I mean, verify the other conditions. That's a good observation indeed. And here, well, I didn't explicitly mention that. You will see in our subsequent examples. The point you raise is very important, because pretty much we will have similar differential equations like we saw before.
00:32:57.140 - 00:33:26.304, Speaker B: So the solution will be something like this, but the boundary conditions are different, or the inner product is defined differently, and we need to verify if the properties are satisfied or not. We will see, I mean, momentarily, some other examples up to here. Is it okay for you? Everybody's fine.
00:33:28.884 - 00:33:57.944, Speaker C: Sir, there is one more case. Once we have got the equation k x prime equal to minus ux plus c. After that, it was elementary stuff, analysis one and two. Yes, but coming to kx prime equal to minus ux plus c, you are basically using some facts from this distribution period.
00:33:58.364 - 00:33:59.144, Speaker B: Yes.
00:34:00.404 - 00:34:03.172, Speaker C: Is there some other easy way to see this?
00:34:03.308 - 00:34:48.108, Speaker B: Because, yes, in my notes, even somehow, it's mentioned in the book of Vern Paulsen. But in my note, I mentioned another second method to find the kernel without using the distribution theory. It works. But in a sense, when you read the notes carefully, on one hand, you see the. Well, it works. It gives us the final solution. But on the other hand, in a sense, we are cheating because we have used other methods to find the kernel.
00:34:48.108 - 00:35:35.632, Speaker B: We know what is the kernel, what the kernel is, and then we adjust our strategy to find it. So, if I want to answer your question, yes, there is a method, but the ultimate solution, there is no escape. You need to know a little bit of distribution theory to fully understand what's going on. You have a question in the chat. I'm wondering whether finding k always reduced to solve a differential equation. Not necessarily. In the examples I started, and I will continue today, we have differential equations.
00:35:35.632 - 00:36:46.808, Speaker B: But then when we enter our second category of examples, analytic function spaces, on the open unit disk, we will see h two, the Hardy space, Dirichlet space, Bergman space, and even Dobranche of Niagara spaces. In those cases, there is no differential equation. We have Taylor series expansion. And based on Taylor series expansion, we find the kernel, so not always a differential equation. Okay, thank you indeed. So, before going for the, for the second example, I would like to. Yeah, I would like to highlight this, that k x t given by this formula, that's the general solution of this equation that we saw about.
00:36:46.896 - 00:36:47.392, Speaker A: It should be.
00:36:47.408 - 00:37:16.374, Speaker B: The equation should be a bit up there. K. Here it is. That's the general solution of this. I emphasize on the general solution, because in next example, we have again this differential equation. And so I do not repeat everything which is written here. I just apply it to find k and then the norm of the evaluation.
00:37:16.374 - 00:38:35.662, Speaker B: So, okay, this said sub space two. So let me call it example two is like the previous one. H is the space of function defined on the interval with values in r such that f is absolutely continuous. And we also add that f prime being in l two. And now I add just one boundary condition f of zero equal to zero. And immediately you see that there should be some problem. I mean, as one of you a few minutes ago mentioned, we verified the boundary values f of zero equal to zero.
00:38:35.662 - 00:39:23.394, Speaker B: We found one constant and f of one equal to zero. We obtained another constant. And here we just have one condition, f of zero equal to zero. So if we end up with a differential equation of degree two, how do we find the other constant? So that's why the question yes is very relevant here. The inner product in this case is the same as before. We can, we can define integral from zero to one. F prime t g prime, t dt, exactly as in the previous case, and it's genuine inner product.
00:39:23.394 - 00:40:27.400, Speaker B: This condition is enough. The only thing which might be suspicious is that if the norm of f is equal to zero, can we conclude that f is identically zero? This is really the case, because if norm is equal to zero, then integral from zero to one f prime squared is equal to zero. And this implies that f prime is equal to zero. Be careful here. Not for all point almost everywhere, but absolute continuity is relevant here. We know that f of x is given by f of zero plus integral from zero to x f prime t dt. This is not valid for all functions, it's just for absolutely continuous function.
00:40:27.400 - 00:41:18.664, Speaker B: And indeed, we adopted this as a definition. And now, condition f of zero equal to zero gives us zero plus zero is identically zero for all x, and we are done. So, even though it's just one condition, it's enough for us to to give us a reproducing kernel here. But the verification of other things and the fact that the evaluation is continuous is precisely as before, with one exception. In this case, we just have this representation. This one. It means that f of x is equal to integral from zero to x f prime t dt.
00:41:18.664 - 00:42:31.448, Speaker B: And if we do cauchy, schwarz f of x less than or equal psychosis words integral from zero to x one squared dt root square times integral from zero to x f prime t square dt root square. And the first one gives us root x, the second gives us, I mean, integral from zero to one. Be generous, write integral from zero to one instead of zero to x, the same thing. And we obtain root x normal f in h. So, evaluations are bounded and we have just one estimation for the norm. But is this optimal? We do not know. We need to find the norm.
00:42:31.448 - 00:43:54.584, Speaker B: And you know how to do it? To answer this question, we need to find k of x. And the procedure is the same as before. We have a differential equation to be satisfied. Let me see. So if we start with this and we do integration by parts, we obtain precisely, as in the previous case, a minus integral from zero to. Let me, let me do the calculation. F of x is f inner product with kx in h.
00:43:54.584 - 00:44:14.244, Speaker B: So it's equal to from integral from zero to one f of x prime k of x prime dt. As I mean, nothing is different. And if we do integration by part, what do we obtain?
00:44:18.184 - 00:44:25.394, Speaker C: There will be extra from f one of kx prime one minus integral zero to one f t. Yes.
00:44:27.054 - 00:45:48.844, Speaker B: And let me assure you, we obtain the same thing. Because when I write f of t k x prime t t from zero to t to the one minus zero to one t dt, uh, do you see why still I, I write here zero. That's the point I wanted to highlight still, even though, even though my condition here is this one boundary condition. But when we want to obtain the differential equation, still I write zero. It seems there is a problem, because this is equal to f k x prime at .1 minus f zero kx prime at .0 minus the rest.
00:45:48.844 - 00:47:08.220, Speaker B: You might use the boundary condition and say that this is equal to zero. But there is no clue that this one has to be zero too. And indeed it is not. And we will see this is one of the obstacles that we need to remove. Also, at the same time, remember that we are working with the class of test functions f to obtain the differential equation f is in c infinity with compact support of zero one, and also the support of f is in the open interval. We are working with this class of function, not the whole space h. So if zero and one here, the function we consider are something like this, a little bigger than zero, everything is zero from minus infinity up to here, and also a little bit less than one.
00:47:08.220 - 00:47:35.440, Speaker B: Say here everything is zero. If, even if we want to extend to infinity, it's okay and the action is happening in between. And the function is indeed c infinity. What I need is that at the .0 and at the, .1 the function is indeed equal to zero. I repeat, not all the function in a space h.
00:47:35.440 - 00:48:59.644, Speaker B: No, the subclass I consider, which is called the test functions, for them it's equal to zero. And therefore we obtain again the representation f of x is equal to minus zero, one f of kx prime t dt. And this, considering the Dirac measure that we saw before, it, gives us the same differential equation, kx double prime of t equal to minus delta x of t. And once we obtain a general solution of this, it was, it was up here. It was precisely. No, that was after it was up here. Once we obtain the general solution of this differential equation of order two, and being of order two, it is natural to have two constants.
00:48:59.644 - 00:50:09.842, Speaker B: One of them is d, the other is c. And how do we obtain this one? At least we can obtain one of them, or a relation between them, because k of x which obtained by that formula. Should I repeat the formula? No, the formula is up there. So let me forget for reference, I repeat the formula. So we saw the general solution kx of t is equal to Ct plus d for t less than x as c minus one t plus x plus d for t bigger than or equal to x. One condition, we have k of x at .0 we need to be zero.
00:50:09.842 - 00:50:49.104, Speaker B: And if we use this formula, we see that k of x at .0 is equal to d, so d has to be zero. So we have a function. Now, k of x of t equal to ct is here. C minus t plus x for t less than or equal to x, for t bigger than or equal to x. Still, there is one constant to be determined. And back to the question you raised all the time.
00:50:49.104 - 00:51:29.164, Speaker B: It's a good idea to verify if we are in this space or not. We are in the space indeed, because what was, what were our conditions? K of x be absolutely continuous. This function is continuous. It has, I mean, the drawing is like this, and then another one. So it's continuous and indeed absolutely continuous, because the derivative here is a constant. Here is another constant. The constant are c and c minus one, that they are different constant.
00:51:29.164 - 00:51:53.130, Speaker B: It doesn't matter if the derivative is in l two. That's okay. So the most important condition is satisfied. And at the .0 is equal to zero. So for any value of c, this is a member of the space. That's a good sign.
00:51:53.130 - 00:52:21.964, Speaker B: But what else do we want? What else do we want? We also want f at the point x to be the inner product of f and k x inner product in h. And this is equal to integral from zero to one. Yes.
00:52:22.624 - 00:52:39.448, Speaker C: In this calculation, we have only used the test functions and kx properly. Kx being in h, whatever property. Yes, but we have not used any other function, which is noted.
00:52:39.496 - 00:53:01.504, Speaker B: Test function, absolutely, you're right. That is why. That is precisely. Very good question. Right at the point. That is why I wrote this. I want this identity to be true for any affinity, not just for the test functions.
00:53:01.504 - 00:53:27.444, Speaker B: True. That's the very definition of a reproducing kernel. You ask your question at the right place. Why do I write this? This is not automatic. This is not automatic. I want to have this identity for all f in this space. And now let's see what we obtain.
00:53:27.444 - 00:54:06.474, Speaker B: Integral from zero to one f prime, kx prime. And f prime has, I mean, two values, depending if we are between zero and x, or between x and one. So I write this integral from zero, one plus integral. Sorry, from zero to x plus integral from x to one, between zero and x. We are here. K is ct, so its derivative is just c. We obtain f prime, t c dt.
00:54:06.474 - 00:54:51.210, Speaker B: In other case is c minus one, the derivative c minus one dt. Simplify again. Being absolutely continuous, this integral is f of x minus f of zero. And that integral is f of one minus f of x. Simplify. We know that f of zero is equal to zero is in the space, which is good. F of x.
00:54:51.210 - 00:55:24.934, Speaker B: We have c here and one minus c here because of the minus here. So it's just f of x. That's good. We want this. And what else do we have? Plus c minus one, f zero one. This term stays for an a general element of space. So if we want this identity to be true, we should have c minus one, f of one equal to zero for all f in h.
00:55:24.934 - 00:56:30.054, Speaker B: And since there are elements, I mean, I write in parentheses here, there are f. It's very easy to construct, for example, f of t equal to t in edge, such that f is not equal to zero g f o t equal to t. So therefore this implies that c has to be equal to one, and being equal, being equal to one. You see what is your k of x. The formula is just. Therefore, k of x is equal to t. If t is less than or equal to x and bigger than x is equal to x is a constant.
00:56:30.054 - 00:57:24.122, Speaker B: C is equal to one. So it's just x is a constant. So that's the formula we obtain for little k. And now ex, the norm of evaluation as an operator from h to r is root of kx at the point x, which is root of x. So incidentally, what the estimation you obtained before is optimal, but there was no proof at that point. Now we have the proof, so it is optimal and we are done. Is that okay? So this is our second example.
00:57:24.122 - 00:57:46.174, Speaker B: We take a little break and then I have two more examples interesting of the same type about is 1522. We come back at eight minutes from now. It.
