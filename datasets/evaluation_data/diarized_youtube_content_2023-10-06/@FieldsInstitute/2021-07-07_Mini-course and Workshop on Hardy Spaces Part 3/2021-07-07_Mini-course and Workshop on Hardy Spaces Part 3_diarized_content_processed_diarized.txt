00:00:00.200 - 00:01:13.706, Speaker A: Everybody or maybe. Good afternoon. Welcome to second day of our focus program. As I mentioned yesterday for our representation theorem, let me share one note. I cannot see the chats here. Well, sometimes the function on the boundary on t, or the measure on t is given and we go inside, and sometimes the other way around, the function inside the disk is given and we want to see what happens on the boundary. And if we have any representation.
00:01:13.706 - 00:02:23.890, Speaker A: Today we go with the first type and tomorrow with the second. In other words, on the open unit disk here on the boundary t, either a measure mu is given or a function f in one of the function spaces lp is given. And then we use this with the Poisson integral to create a function on d. So, from the boundary, we go inside, and then we want to see what is the connection between the function which lives inside the function which is on the boundary. For this, we need to develop some tools. The first one is convolution. If f and g functions in l one are given, we cannot conclude that fg is in l one.
00:02:23.890 - 00:03:18.644, Speaker A: Fg is not in an algebra with coin to multiplication. It's very easy to come up with simple examples. But what is really surprising is that if instead of direct point PI multiplication, we rotate one of them. So this one means that integral from zero to two PI f e to the I theta g e to the I theta d theta. But if instead of this, we, we can see the integral from zero to PI f, we keep it as it is. But for g, we rotate it a bit. I mean, rotated and reflection t is fixed for the, for the moment.
00:03:18.644 - 00:04:20.074, Speaker A: So this combination again, even, I mean, we need to put an absolute value for a fixed t t. We cannot say that this integral is finite. But the surprising part is that if we use for Beni theorem and take another n integral of this with respect to t, then it becomes finite. I mean, just to Fubini. And this means that the integral inside I. I see, I didn't share this PDF file. It's Joseph sima who is sharing it.
00:04:20.074 - 00:05:11.654, Speaker A: Hello, Joe. Okay, I go back to my own. So, if we apply for bini here, do you see my screen now? Yes. Okay, thank you. So this is finite. So the integral inside should be finite almost everywhere. And this allows us to define a new function, which we call it the convolution of f of g, precisely the same formula without absolute value.
00:05:11.654 - 00:05:59.758, Speaker A: And that's a very important tool for our analysis. Ft g e to the I t minus theta. And here, d theta or d theta divided by two PI. The reason we divide by two PI is to have a nice formula. Later on we will see one of them momentarily. And I mean to name this, I mean, let's call it f star g at point e to dt. So this is a function which is defined, well defined almost everywhere, and precisely based on the formula above, is in l one.
00:05:59.758 - 00:06:59.198, Speaker A: With f star g norm, one is bounded by normal f in l one normal g in l one. Why is this important? That because our connection with harmonic analysis for a function f in l one f hat of n is Fourier transformer. Fourier coefficient is defined by integral zero two PI f e to the I t minus int again d theta. Either put dt, put two PI here or in front doesn't matter. This is just to emphasize that we consider the normalized measure and precisely the same formula for measures. Now let's stay with functions. A very easy exercise.
00:06:59.198 - 00:07:51.044, Speaker A: Again, simple application of object says that. So it's lemma f star g hat at point n is f hat of n g hat. That's the main essence of convolution and the convolution. This identity looks nice because we hide it. Because we hide it. PI or two PI in previous formulas, if you look at some books, you see that, for example, it's written f star g hat of n is equal to two PI or one over two PI f hat of ng hat. It's not a mistake.
00:07:51.044 - 00:08:22.234, Speaker A: It is because their definition of f hat, and also their definition of f star g is different. They did not hide as we did to PI in the formulas. So PI has to appear somewhere. I mean, we put it there with the measure. And that is why we have something, I mean, clean and nice here. Let me see if I can see the chats now. Okay, there is no comment.
00:08:22.234 - 00:09:25.452, Speaker A: The inequality that we saw here can be generalized a little bit and some versions of it. We need it later on. The most general setting is called young inequality. And I just mentioned a special case of young inequality theorem for the case f in Lp, g in L1. The conclusion is that f star g, then f star g is in Lp, and moreover, the norm can be controlled. Norm of f star g in Lp is controlled by norm of f in Lp, norm of g in L1. We can go a little bit further.
00:09:25.452 - 00:10:52.394, Speaker A: I mean, the PDF file that we share with you later on contains, I mean, the general case, but we don't need it for the representation theorem that we are looking for. One further comment about convolution is that if f and g both are in L1 f star g is defined almost everywhere. But if we know more and more means that f belongs to Lp and g belongs to Lq, then f star g is defined everywhere. I mean, at all point e to the it is well defined, and moreover, it's a continuous function. I mean, this is a kind of subclass of all the convolutions that we consider. So this is enough for the representation theorem that we want to develop for a little hp and even big hp. The last comment about convolution is that the thing I mentioned about functions, I mean, f star g can be generalized for measures.
00:10:52.394 - 00:12:30.214, Speaker A: In other words, if mu and nu are measures on m, then we can define mu star the convolution and the definition is adjusted such that, first of all, if mu is. You remember yesterday we said that there is a copy of l one in M. So if d mu is equal to f dt divided by two PI, and nu is g dt divided by two PI. In other words, if mu and nu on absolutely continuous with respect to Lubeck measure, then the definition should be such that mu star nu. The convolution that we obtain is the same as f star g as we defined before. In other words, this measure is f star g d divided by two PI. The new definition should be at least with this property, and also, it's designed such that mu star nu hat at point n is equal to mu hat of n.
00:12:30.214 - 00:13:53.042, Speaker A: So in other words, it says that the definition which I have not provided yet, it's a good one. But what is that definition? The definition is not as direct as this one. I mean, this is a very direct formula which says, what is f star g? The definition of mu nu is kind of indirect, is like this. Consider this combination integral two y's over t times t of phi e to the I t plus theta d mu with respect to t, and d nu with respect to theta. And call this lambda alpha. Well, that lambda is well defined and it's linear for some appropriate functional space, is rather clear to have no difficulty, because leukemia dysfunctions might have direct measures in them. So we need to be careful which phi we consider.
00:13:53.042 - 00:15:00.684, Speaker A: But at least if we take phi to b in class of continuous function, there is absolutely no ambiguity with this definition. Lambda of is well defined. And also with a little bit of work, we can show that lambda is a bounded linear functional on c of t. In other words, easy to see that lambda belongs to c of t star. And even when you take absolute value inside here, you easily see that even the norm of lambda is controlled by the norm of mu times the norm of. No, this is easy, I mean, very easy to establish linear bounded. Yesterday we showed that c of t is equal to m of t.
00:15:00.684 - 00:15:46.502, Speaker A: I mean, with the appropriate interpretation of equality. In other words, rist theorem. Now, I mean, so that's the moment that we use a very heavy tool. Rise theorem tells us that there is another measure, there is a measure lambda. So this is in m of t such that lambda of phi is equal to integral over t phi to the it. And I mean, don't mix t here with t or theta, which is there. It's dummy variable.
00:15:46.502 - 00:16:55.822, Speaker A: I mean, put it whatever you wish. E to the is d lambda e to the is. And if we put this with the definition of lambda, so that integral phi e to the I t plus theta order of t and theta is not important. This is equal to integral of phi with respect to a measure lambda, which I mean, instead of lambda, I use mu star nu. That's a notation. So, mu star nu is defined by this formula star nu e to the is. So that's the way we, we define, we define of a convolution of mu and nu.
00:16:55.822 - 00:17:48.014, Speaker A: It's kind of indirect. It's not as, as direct as this formula for f star g. But however, I leave it an exercise to show that it has the two good properties that we are looking for. On one hand, if mu and nu are absolutely continuous, we recover the previous definition. And on the other hand, the multiplicative probability property that we're looking for is satisfying. Well, that's just, I mean, recall on the convolution that we needed here. What else? The second tool, which is equally more important is approximate identities.
00:17:48.014 - 00:18:21.074, Speaker A: F star g. The convolution, if restricted on L1, it has many nice properties. F one of t with a star. Indeed, with this f l, one becomes even a panic. Algebra. And it has all the properties that we are looking at, the algebraic properties, commutative, associative, distributive. But there is one thing which is missing.
00:18:21.074 - 00:19:41.152, Speaker A: There is no unit element. There is no element called it. I mean, e such that in L1 f star e is equal to e star f equal to f. There is no such element. And the reason is very simple, because if we take the Fourier transform of both sides, we see that f hat of n, e hat of n is equal to f hat of n for any n and for any f in L1. And therefore, even if we consider just e to the in t, we see that if such an e exists, we should have e hat of n equal to one for all n in z. And this is impossible if you are already familiar with the Riemann Lubeck lemma.
00:19:41.152 - 00:20:26.698, Speaker A: Riemann Lubeck Lemma says that if you have a function in L1, then g hat of n goes to zero, then n goes to infinity from both directions. Therefore, we cannot have a function which with this property, even one of the results we develop today, I mean, has a proof of this. But at the end of the day, there is no unit element. There is a unit element. If we go bigger, if we can see the measures, and that's the Dirac measure anchored at zero. Dirac measure anchored at zero has this property. But we stay in L1.
00:20:26.698 - 00:21:22.534, Speaker A: How we can overcome this difficulty? There is no unit. So we go with something which is close to the unit, and being close to the unit, it has different interpretation. One of the interpretation is indeed coming from this one. We do not have a function such that the spectrum is equal to one everywhere. So we try to choose functions, not just one function. Try to choose functions such that the spectrum is getting closer and closer to this requirement. One of them is, for example, if you see, is the failure kernel.
00:21:22.534 - 00:22:10.578, Speaker A: The spectrum of failure kernel is like this is not equal to one, but it's one at the origin. But this, this decreases. And here is the point n and minus n. That's the spectrum of the n's element. And then you see that when n increases, the spectrum is getting closer and closer to what? To what we want here. It's not identically equal to one, but it's getting the same is for the Poisson Kelvin. The spectrum is.
00:22:10.578 - 00:23:17.370, Speaker A: The question is, what do you mean by a spectrum? Is the Fourier transform in the sequences here, if defined f hat, somewhere here is f hat. F hat is defined for all n in z. And so if you put them on the diagram like this, we call it spectrum. Now I give a definition of approximate identity. This definition does not reflect what I said here, but when you look more closely, you see it's there. So, approximate identity, an approximate identity is not one function. It's a family of functions.
00:23:17.370 - 00:25:00.640, Speaker A: So in the PDF file I denoted by phi Kappa, and now I will say phi of ka, and k is not necessarily an integer. It could be in the case of failure kernel k equal to 0123 for failure kernel, which we'll see later on. But the Poisson kernel kappa is indeed r, which is in the interval of zero one. And when we say in the following limit over k or soup over k, in the first case, it means that lim when k goes to infinity and soup means soup for all k in 0123, all integers. But in the second case, for the Poisson lim over k means that limit when k goes to one, and here for all k in the interval zero and one, we have to distinguish between at least two cases. But generally speaking, I will write lean and su. So what are the properties of these functions? All of them are in l one, I mean l one of t, the first property, they are normalized.
00:25:00.640 - 00:26:24.304, Speaker A: Normalization means that integral of phi k e to the I t dt divided by two PI is equal to one. And you will see this place, even though it looks very simple and naive, it will play an important role in the proof of the result. The second one is uniform boundedness, uniformly boundedness. This means that there is a constant c, or, I mean, we can, we can, instead of saying there exists a constant c, we can consider the supremum. So put an absolute value here, and they take the supremum over all k. And this is finite. Boundedness means, means this, all of them in one ball, and the radius of this ball, we call it c, which of course depend on v.
00:26:24.304 - 00:27:57.134, Speaker A: So they do not explode, they don't go to infinity. And the third one is called concentration around zero. There are two versions of this, the weak version, which is enough for many applications, but for some of them we need something a bit stronger. So I start with the weak one for each fixed theta, for each theta in the interval zero and PI. If you chop off the interval minus delta, delta, in other words, you, instead of doing these integrals all over t, if you think of the unit circuit, I remove, I remove this little interval minus delta and delta and do the integration on the rest. You can even think of it on the as on the interval minus PI over PI, it has the same conclusion. So I do the integration here.
00:27:57.134 - 00:28:46.104, Speaker A: So, integral of absolute value of vk e to the I t dt or dt divided by two PI, two PI. Here it doesn't matter, but not for all t. Absolute value of t is between delta and PI, I mean the yellow region. So we do this integral. Of course, this quantity depends on k. When we change over k, the quantity changes. The important assumption is that the limb over k of this is equal to zero.
00:28:46.104 - 00:29:29.158, Speaker A: In other words, the mass which is outside zero, not in a neighborhood of zero. It becomes less and less important. And recall that without absolute value, the total mass is one. And even if you put the absolute value, it doesn't go to infinity, is something finite. But eventually, whatever we have concentrates around zero, around origin. If you think of the open unit disk. And you say, on the unit circle, our function concentrates around the point z equal to one.
00:29:29.158 - 00:30:16.804, Speaker A: But on real line is equal to, say, around t zero. These three assumptions are enough for many applications. Sometimes, instead of three, there is something which is a bit stronger. I call it three pro prime. Instead of the integral over delta to PI, and from minus delta to minus PI, we consider the supreme. So supreme. So it's bigger than the previous one of absolute value of v.
00:30:16.804 - 00:31:11.192, Speaker A: So in other words, we replaced l one by l infinity. So this quantity is. Bracket is even bigger than this one. But for many kernels, even the limit of this one is equal to zero. So, of course, three prime implies three, and it's stronger. I mentioned this because two kernels that we consider satisfies three prime, the stronger one. And so, as I said, the definitions one two three, or one two, three prime, do not reflect, do not show directly that we have this property.
00:31:11.192 - 00:31:37.672, Speaker A: If we take phi n hat. Why, when n grows phi n, would you please. Thank you. Why? Why when we take. Here I am. As I said, I. I got my bills.
00:31:37.672 - 00:32:07.124, Speaker A: Uh, well, uh, I do not. I. We do not see directly that if we take hat phi and hat goes to one. But it is not very difficult. I mean, use one, two, three or three prime to show that this is really the case. So we, we get closer and closer to one, and we. That is why this is called an approximate identity.
00:32:07.124 - 00:32:42.704, Speaker A: Two important examples for us. Let me. Yeah, there are two important examples that we need. Let me see what is in chat. Okay. Two examples. One of them is the Poisson, which I mentioned many, many times.
00:32:42.704 - 00:33:28.564, Speaker A: P. Sometimes we write re to the it, like this. Sometimes we write p to r e to the it. Both versions are good. And it's one minus two reals, one plus two reals minus two r, cos t. I do not go into detail to show that it satisfies one, two and three prime. Another one is the and for which the formula is kn.
00:33:28.564 - 00:34:26.310, Speaker A: Let me emphasize here that r is between zero and one and kn, the failure formula e to the it. There are at least three formulas, but they are the same. Each one has a different feature. Uh, one of them, I mean, is this one sum k from minus n to n, one minus absolute value of k over n plus one e to the I k t. I mean, the whole six courses that we had yesterday, today and tomorrow, we'll have. It's about representation theorem. This is a good point to emphasize that each representation formula is important, and it shows something.
00:34:26.310 - 00:35:22.714, Speaker A: It has a message in it. For example, about this kn with the formula I gave you saw something, you saw that, you can see that the coefficient here, the case one, when k is fixed and n goes to infinity, it goes to one. So we have this property that I mentioned. It gets more and more flat and close to one. That's one good thing that we see out of this. Another thing that we see out of this is that if we integrate both sides, the integral of e to the ikt is zero, except for k equal to zero. And therefore, we immediately recover what we want here as formula one, as condition one.
00:35:22.714 - 00:36:45.844, Speaker A: With this formula, we do not see that kn is positive. There is absolutely no indication with this summation from minus n to n, a coefficient e to the kt, that we have something positive. But if you do some algebraic operation, you see that, I mean, this is an exercise for a student, that this is precisely equal to one over n plus one, sine of n plus one, c over two over sine c over two, the whole thing squared. In fact, I mean, as a hint, to put, to obtain this identity, multiply this, this summation by sine of t over two squared, do simplification and you obtain the combination that you need here. I mean, I leave the detail. The message is important. This is another formula which represents the same function, kn.
00:36:45.844 - 00:37:50.964, Speaker A: And with this formula, you immediately see two things. The first one is that kn is positive. And being positive, you immediately prove number two, because if n is positive, you don't need absolute value. Removing the absolute value, the integral is equal to one, so c is equal to one. This is a consequence of this formula, so, which is rather impossible to deduce it from the first one. And also with this formula, you can deduce three prime. Why? Because if you are away from the origin, you can replace the sign in nominator by one, the biggest possibility, and sign in denominator by sine delta over two, which is fixed.
00:37:50.964 - 00:38:25.734, Speaker A: And then when n goes to infinity, this goes to zero. In other words, away from the origin, kn is big o of one over n. And so we proved this condition, this condition, this required condition. And well, there is another formula for kn. I don't need it here. And the same for pr. With this formula, you see that it's positive.
00:38:25.734 - 00:39:37.874, Speaker A: Everything nominator and denominator is positive. But you do not see, see number one, y integral of pr is equal to one. Of course, using techniques from calculus, I mean, from good old days, you can integrate both sides and do, I mean, some heavy calculations to get you set, it's equal to one, but not so easy from this formula. However, there is another formula for print and the formula I write it here. This is equal to also the sum over n in z r to the absolute value of n e to the int. Since r is less than one, the convergence is uniform. Question in chat is it possible new? Approximately there is a question, yes.
00:39:37.874 - 00:40:30.544, Speaker A: The question is, is it possible to construct a new approximate identity using the old one? Indeed, yes. And the blue book that I mentioned, there are some construction, construction in it, and one of them is needed in the proof of theorem, but unfortunately I do not have time to go over it. Let's see what is the usefulness of this second formula for pr. Immediately you see number one. I mean, if you integrate, you can put the integral after the summation. Because the convergence is uniform, everything is zero except for n equal to zero, which you obtain one. And by this, the first one, it is positive.
00:40:30.544 - 00:41:27.874, Speaker A: So again c is equal to one. You don't need absolute value here, so it becomes one. And so you have one and two. Thanks to the collaboration of Formula one and Formula two and Formula one also gives us three prime, because if you fix delta, you can find the minimum of the denominator, and the minimum is one plus two reals minus two r cos delta, which is strictly bigger than zero. And now when r goes to one up, the denominator goes to zero, denominator goes to two minus two cos delta, which is not zero. So we proved number three prime. So that's another, I mean, indication of the, I mean, the philosophy of these codes.
00:41:27.874 - 00:42:41.174, Speaker A: Each representation formula, each formula has its own myriad. It helps us for something. Well, this is for approximate identities. I have some pictures on my other computer for, for failure kernel and for Poisson kernel, which I cannot share it here, but it's in the PDF file we can see later on. It's some pictures for the spectrum of pr and f kn and also their graph for different values of r and n. Application how do we use these two tools? Remember, we developed approximate identities and also the convolution. So constructions, let's start with a measure mu on t.
00:42:41.174 - 00:44:03.834, Speaker A: And then we already defined the convolution of pr and mu. More explicitly, pr and star mu at point e to the I theta is given by this formula integral over t pr at the point it would I theta minus t or more explicitly, one minus r two one plus r two minus two r theta minus t. With the notation we had above, this is p r at the point e to the I theta minus t. Since this is an even function, if somebody makes a mistake and write t minus theta instead of theta minus t, there is no problem. And then d mu of e to the I t. That's an explicit formula for the convolution of pr and mu. And what can we say about this? That's our first theorem about construction.
00:44:03.834 - 00:44:41.234, Speaker A: Theorem. So you see, I said at the very beginning today, today we start on the boundary and we go inside in the open unit. This, this is precisely what we did here. Mu is in on the boundary, but what we can say about p or pr star mu. There are two ways that we can interpret a function on the open unit disk. We can, I mean, to inter. Maybe it's a good idea to emphasize it here before the theorem.
00:44:41.234 - 00:45:22.014, Speaker A: If you have a function f on d, there are two ways to interpret f. One way to look at it as just one function f of z. For each value of z, it gives us something. So it's a single valued function at all point that. This is the common point of view that we know. But there's another way which comes into picture here. We can look at f as a family of functions, and we call it fr.
00:45:22.014 - 00:46:29.300, Speaker A: If r at point e to the I theta is defined to be f at point r e to the I theta. In other words, instead of looking at f as one function, we can see the circles of different radius, and restriction of f on each of these is called fr f r fr. So we have a family of function for r between zero and one. That's another way that we can look at a function which is defined on d. And this is precisely what you see here. You see a family of function defined on t with parameter ARR, which is between zero and one. So either you look at it this way, or you can say that this is p star mu at point r e to the I theta as one function on the open unit disk.
00:46:29.300 - 00:47:09.398, Speaker A: Both ways are good, and we consider it here below. Now, the theorem, our first theorem. Assumptions. Let me be in m of t. That's it. And then define the function. Uh, I mean, I put it this way because I want to emphasize that r e to the I theta is important for us.
00:47:09.398 - 00:48:07.380, Speaker A: Otherwise, I can write it as here, u at point r e to the I theta is defined as the convolution of pr and mu, the value of the convolution at point e to the I theta. And the formula is about I. Simply repeat the formula. This is our first important theorem. Then, what are the properties of this then first, u is harmonic on d. It's a function which is defined on d. But it's more than just a function.
00:48:07.380 - 00:49:42.354, Speaker A: It's harmonic two. It has a representation as a power series u of r e to the I theta is given by mu hat of n r to the absolute value of n e to the I n thet. The series converges uniformly on compact subsets of t. And well, these are the basic properties that, that we wanted to mention. But more than that, we will say something more about the norm of u in h one. But now let's just see why we have number one and number two. And then after the break, we will go into more detail and study different convergence modes.
00:49:42.354 - 00:50:16.234, Speaker A: Lp on weaker star convergence. Why? Why in your opinion, u is a harmonic function? We have at least two methods. Two way to prove it. What does harmonic mean? It was mentioned yesterday. We have to verify the Cauchy. The Laplace equation works. Why the Laplacian of this is equal to zero.
00:50:16.234 - 00:51:23.502, Speaker A: So proof. The first one is the direct proof. You want to calculate Laplacian r, which means in cartesian coordinate derivative with respect to x two y plus derivative with respect to y to y. Or if you, because of the r and theta, which had before, if you want to use the polar coordinates, it's urr plus one over r u r plus one over r two u theta, theta. I mean, one of these two formulas, you have to verify and do the calculation. And at the end of the day, prove that it's equal to zero. This is, I mean, not difficult.
00:51:23.502 - 00:52:46.354, Speaker A: You can use this formula. The only thing that you need to verify is that you can interchange the order of change, the order of integration and the operator delta two. In other words, delta two of u, which is delta two with respect to r and theta. That's the delicate point. You need some tools from ordinary courses of analysis be able to justify that this is equal to integral and take the Laplacian inside. But I mean, everything works well and then this is equal to zero and you obtain what you want. That's one way to do it, most direct way, it works very well.
00:52:46.354 - 00:53:49.616, Speaker A: But there is another way to do it. And for this you need a bit of complex analysis. In complex analysis, we know that the real part and also the imaginary part, the real part of every harmonic function is, every holomorphic function is harmonic. So if f is written as u plus iv, if holomorphic implies that u and v are harmonic. And here you need to make an observation about the formula. Here is the formula u is defined by this formula, and you have a kernel here. Is this the real part of something analytic? And the answer is, of course, yes.
00:53:49.616 - 00:54:43.272, Speaker A: And then you can easily bring the real part outside and you obtain a function which is analytic, and its real part is the one which is given here. It's not difficult. I mean, I leave it to you to prove that if you consider e to the I theta plus z over e to the I theta minus z and take the real part, you obtain the Poisson kernel. So that's an indirect way to prove the same thing. But you need complex analysis. What about the second one? Why do we have this representation for you? Again, back to the two formulas I provided for failure kernel and for Poisson kernel. These two are for failure.
00:54:43.272 - 00:55:27.564, Speaker A: We will use them later. And these two are for the Poisson. And I need this one here. I need this one here. And note that again, since I r is less than one, the convergence is uniform. And back to the formula for u. The formula for u, it was integral pr e to the I theta minus t, d mu e to the it integration over t.
00:55:27.564 - 00:56:25.384, Speaker A: And I can replace pr by the summation n in z r to the absolute value of n e to the in theta minus t. D mu e to the it convergence is uniform. So there is no danger here. I can change the order of summation and integration r to the absolute value of n comes out. And then integration is with respect to t. So n is missing here. E to the I n theta is also here.
00:56:25.384 - 00:57:15.824, Speaker A: And what remains is integral over t e to the minus int. And this is precisely the definition of mu hat that we saw at the very beginning today. So it becomes r to the absolute value of n, mu hat of n e to the I n theta. And if you are familiar with the summation theory, again, Hardy is a master of this subject, and his last book, divergent series is about this topic. You see the Abel summation of the Fourier series of me. Good, I better to stop here. 57 have few minutes of breaks.
