00:00:00.840 - 00:00:01.256, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:01.302 - 00:00:47.164, Speaker B: Okay, so the next talk, the remainder of the talks today are connecting, connected to SDP and tensegrity. SDP and rigidity and tensegrity. The universal rigidity is a sort of a connecting concept between semi definite programming and, and rigidity. So the remaining two talks will be on rigidity. The afternoon talk, not sure if it connects to universal rigidity, but this one certainly does. Okay, Ryoshun is a. Is from, is from the group of Shinichi Tanigawa and.
00:00:47.164 - 00:00:50.244, Speaker B: Yeah, all yours, Ryosha.
00:00:51.924 - 00:01:54.460, Speaker A: Thank you for your introduction. I'm going to talk about universal rigidity of generic symmetric tensegrities. This is a joint work with my advisor Shinstanyawa. Let me start from the background or background graphite emitting problem. In this problem, you're given a graph g and real number lij for all. For each ij in e, your task is to find d dimensional point configuration p such that the point at the distance between PI and pj is equal to Lij. And you can also formulate this in terms of euclidean distance matrix.
00:01:54.460 - 00:02:57.850, Speaker A: So this problem is also known as low rank euclidean distance matrix completion. This problem appears in various applications, for example, molecular conformation, tensor grid deconstruction, and sensor network localization. Especially when you think about the sensor network localization. In addition to the interpoint distance, you are given a position of the subset of the vertices, which is called anchors. Unfortunately, graphene reading problem is known to be np hard. So one of the main analysis too is to use SDP relaxation so and so. I thought, so I'll do this.
00:02:57.850 - 00:04:08.574, Speaker A: Let v to be, let the number of vertices to be n, and we assume that it is labeled from the natural number from one to n. And for d dimensional configuration p, we write capital p to be the d times n matrix whose I square is PI. We define a matrix called gram matrix by p transpose p. In other words, I j entry of gram matrix is the inner product between PI and pj. When you consider gram matrix, orthogonal transformation cancels out. Okay, so by using this gram matrix, I reformulate the graph embedding problem. I always write sn plus to be the n times n psd matrix, and inner product is written trace.
00:04:08.574 - 00:05:12.454, Speaker A: Inner product is written like this one I should use as a pointer. Then the problem is like this. So given the graph and etij, your task is to find a PSd matrix x satisfying linear constraint plus rank constraint. Here fij is defined to be eimas ej times e ij transpose. Then gram matrix of p is feasible if and only if p is the solution to the original graph emitting problem, okay? But still, because of the long constraint, this problem is non convex. So what I do is to relax this condition when, when the rank constraint is deleted, it is convex. So it is solvable within a given precision.
00:05:12.454 - 00:06:06.004, Speaker A: But the solution can be very high rank. So in time, the solution to the original graph embedding problem is in high dimension, which is not a good thing. So there are two natural questions. So there are two natural ideas. So decide if every feasible solution of this relaxed SDP has rank at most d. This leads to the notion called dimensional rigidity. And another question is that, another thing is that to decide if the SDP has a unique solution, this corresponds to the notion called universal rigidity and unique localizability.
00:06:06.004 - 00:07:30.254, Speaker A: There's a slight difference between these notions. So, localizability refers to the property of the system, while rigidity refers to the property of the underlying budget framework for tensegrity. And I focus on the budget framework setting. So I thought from the basic terminologies, from rigidity, okay. A d dimensional tense degree is a table g, sigma and p, where g is a graph and sigma is a map called the sine map, which is a map from edge set to sines, and p is a map from busiest to d space, and it is called a point configuration. Here's example. So actually, the sign that labeled minus is called strapped and h labeled zero is called bar, and plus is called cable.
00:07:30.254 - 00:08:16.770, Speaker A: So this is a four but ten security. And I mean it is two dimensional. And like in this case, when every member is a stiff bar, it is called a bar joint framework. Throughout, we assume that the number of vertex is at most is bigger than the dimension it lives. And the point configuration is a five, that is, no d plus one. Points lie on hyperbrain. We define the two relations between tensegrities.
00:08:16.770 - 00:09:06.724, Speaker A: The first one is dominance. So let g sigma p and g sigma q be d dimensional tense degrees. We say that g sigma p dominates g sigma q if these conditions hold. So it means that the strut cannot be shorter and the length of bars are fixed and cables cannot be longer. So it represents physical constraint given by, like strut bar cables. So, for example, this left tense security domain is the right one. Okay? And the second relation is congruence.
00:09:06.724 - 00:10:26.896, Speaker A: For two dimensional point configuration p and q, we say that p is equivalent to p is congruent to q. If every point y's distance are the same, they are irrespective of the existence of edge. In other words, there is a eugradian motion which maps p to q. Okay, let me define the notion global digit. The d dimensional tensibility is called globally digit. If for any d dimensional point configuration q, which is dominated by j sigma p implies that q is a congruent image of p. For example, as I showed that this tense security dominates another tensegrity, and that is not a congruent image of the initial one.
00:10:26.896 - 00:11:36.174, Speaker A: So this is not globally digitized. And this patient framework is also not globally rigid because you can flip the above vertex down to here, while the right two tensibilities and frameworks are globally rigid. So what I do is to formulate global rigidity in terms of rank constraint SDP, and we use the same line by Gram matrix. So, okay, here is a feasibility problem. Find the ten security jig sigma p a. Given the tensorgrity g extreme p. Find a positive semi definite matrix x such that satisfying three condition, three condition plus one condition where jn is just all one matrix plus rank constraint.
00:11:36.174 - 00:12:59.174, Speaker A: Okay? And the inner product between rank matrix is just for bitcoin, it just to forbid trivial translation. So when x is the grammar matrix of some p, some q, then it says that center of gravity over q is at the origin. So for simplicity, we assume that, we always assume that the center of gravity of a point configuration is at the origin, then the gram matrix of p is always feasible. In this program, here is a claim. Zigma p is globally digit if and only if the above problem about zigma p has a unique feasibility solution. I think this is just a repeat, but I prefer this. So suppose x is, suppose p is a gram matrix of point configuration q.
00:12:59.174 - 00:14:01.438, Speaker A: This is nothing but p dominate the sigma q and the center of gravity at the origin. So, so the uniqueness is equivalent to global. So my plan is to delete the rank condition. Then I get, I get this. So this is a very important definition. I say that tense security g shigma p is universally rigid if and only if the, this Sdp, this relaxed SDp for g sigma p has a unique feasible solution, namely grammar recp. Geometrically, uh, it corresponds to the global digit, any higher dimension.
00:14:01.438 - 00:14:59.694, Speaker A: So what I mean here is that. So, so consider this framework. This is known to be globally digit in two space. But when you lift it in r three space, then there is a non trivial flex in three reals. So this is not universal rigid, but somewhat surprisingly is this guy is universally rigid. So as a consequence, universal rigidity is not a generic property of a graphic, right? Yeah. And this is also universal region.
00:14:59.694 - 00:15:59.244, Speaker A: Okay. And there is a very nice geometric view about universal rigidity. So for that, consider just a budget framework. So no strut and no cables. Let ln plus be the set of sn plus a set of PSD matrices, which is also going to oram matrix where so, so here l denotes laplacian and let PI be also going on projection from span of f I j for all I and Jesus to span over f I j where I j is in e. Then here is the grain. P is universally rigid if and only if this condition holds.
00:15:59.244 - 00:17:10.164, Speaker A: So what this means is that take the gram matrix of p and project it down and take its inverse image. And so then the intersection of dots and the laplacian cone is just a single. This is the meaning of the right hand side. Why this is true? Because for the patient framework, case dominance is just, just saying this. So every edge length are the same. And so in terms of gram matrix, this is equivalent to say that the difference of the gram matrix is also connected to the f I j for all I j and e. So it says that the image of these two are the same under PI.
00:17:10.164 - 00:18:08.136, Speaker A: So the singleton s is equivalent to the universal rigidity. Okay, so our question is that which tends to grid is I inversely rigid? Okay, so start from RDB. So this is just the same SDP, but I slightly change it. I just set the arbitrary objective function. Then I can take the dual problem program. It looks like this. So what the constraint means? So these two constraint is just first two conditions that cables strut give a sign constraint.
00:18:08.136 - 00:19:07.554, Speaker A: And the third one says that weighted laprasian matrix is positive same definite. So for example, dual variable is edge weight and steroid and cables and the psdness of Laplacian. Okay, let me move on to the notion called equilibrium stress. So consider this. This equation star. We say that omega is an equilibrium stress of g sigma p if it satisfies asterisk and the sign constraint. So what this condition mean is that consider antibiotics and consider the edge vectors towards the neighbors.
00:19:07.554 - 00:20:21.814, Speaker A: And then the weighted average of these vectors are zero. So physically it is best to understand it as a young modulus. Then the dual objective function is the energy function and the object function can be written as just the inner product of gram matrix and weighted Laplace matrix. So it is always non negative. When omega is identically zero, the optimum value zero is always attained attained. So omega is optimal then p times lg, omega is zero then. And actually this linear constraint is nothing but this asterisk condition.
00:20:21.814 - 00:21:41.814, Speaker A: So what it means is that any optimal solution of the dual problem is an equilibrium stress of j sigma p. Okay, we also say that the edge weight is strictly proper if it is negative on strat and positive on cable. So this is just a his observation. So for for any equilibrium stress omega, the rank of the weighted Laplacian matrix is bounded above by n minus d minus one. Why this is true, we already saw that p times l j omega is zero. And since erga omega is a laprasian Quran vector is always in its colony, so it satisfies this concern. And since we assume a fine furnace and left matrix is low for rank, hence this upper branch here is an important definition.
00:21:41.814 - 00:22:47.760, Speaker A: We say that the tensegrity g sigma p is super stable if it satisfies two conditions. First condition is called es, where, which stands for equilibrium stress. It says that there exists a strictly proper equilibrium stress such that its laplacian is positive semi definite and its rank is maximum, which is n minus d minus one. The second condition is called conic or conic condition. It says that there is no non zero symmetric matrix s satisfying this condition. The important thing is that. So important thing is that actually super stability is sufficient for universal rigidity.
00:22:47.760 - 00:23:58.724, Speaker A: This is first pointed out by Connery. And yes, um, for dimensional rigidity es is sufficient. Okay, so, so let me interpret that super stability in the language of SDP. So, equilibrium stress condition about the condition about the equilibrium stress is equivalent to say that dual optimal solution there exists a dual optimal solution where the pair of gram matrix of p and lg omega is a strict complementary pair of the SDP. This is an interpretation of the first function for the second condition. It is the best described in this way, I think. So it implies that there is no matrix a satisfying this constraint.
00:23:58.724 - 00:25:10.904, Speaker A: So it means that there is no affine flex. Okay, and I also give a geometric view of super stability. So again, consider a batch joint framework with no inequality constraint, since record that the set of PSD laplacians are just the face of the PSD matrix. So it is isomorphic to the smaller psdcon, so we know the phase structure of it. And concretely it can be write like this. Here is our claim. Es is equivalent to the existence of hyperbrain, which is parallel to PI and exposing the minimal phase of the gram matrix.
00:25:10.904 - 00:26:27.236, Speaker A: Secondly, the conic condition is equivalent to the disc condition. And I think this is just saying that it is universally digit inside the face. Okay? And actually when you combine these two claims, it is easy to see that Es brasconic implies universal digit, universal digitity, because suppose, yeah, and when you project it down and take it inverse image, it is still inside the hyper brain. So only the possible candidate is inside the face. And the conic condition implies that it is unique inside the face. Okay. And to see this claim, I just, I only explain for the case of, for the first case.
00:26:27.236 - 00:27:33.604, Speaker A: For the first claim, suppose, suppose some hyper planes parity PI. It is equivalent to say that normal vector is in the span of the fij for ije. And the exposedness condition can be written concurrently like this. And this follows actually from this exact description of the face. Okay, this is the figures. So, most of the universal rigid tensegrities are super stable, but there, there is no some examples which is universally rigid but is not super stable. So the question is when it is necessary.
00:27:33.604 - 00:28:20.444, Speaker A: And I introduce, I talked about previous work. I define notion called genericity. So let k be a field. We assume that the k is a subfield of real numbers, and it is a finite extension field of the rationals. We say that the point configuration d d point configuration p is generic over k. If the coordinates of p one through pn are algebraically independent over field k. When, when a field k is the rationals, we simply say p is generic.
00:28:20.444 - 00:29:21.874, Speaker A: And one. One reason that we may pay attention to genericity is that set of non generic points has lubric measure zero. So. So, so, yeah, with some exception, we can say something that that's the reason why we assume genericity. So since this one has a, like a reflectional symmetry, and this is not generic, this is example. Okay, so here is a go to Thurston's necessity condition. It says that if a generic power joint framework is universal rigid, then it is super stable.
00:29:21.874 - 00:30:17.024, Speaker A: In figures it's. So they say that for this part, actually super stability and universal rigidity coincides. Okay, so I move on to my, our main results. First result is about generic tensegrities. So we, we make so, so cables or struts are out. There is that if a generic tense activity is universally rigid, then it is super stable, which means that in this range, superstar and universal rigidity also coincides. Our second theorem is about the outside of genericity around here.
00:30:17.024 - 00:31:20.234, Speaker A: So to state our second theorem, I introduce some notion. So, let gamma be a finite group. Let theta be a group homomorphism from gamma to orthogonal group of RD. We say that the 10th segregated g sigma p is theta symmetric. If gamma acts freely on the signed graph g sigma, and the action of gamma is compatible with that of theta. In other words, it satisfies this condition actually symmetric. Tensegrity appears in engineering, for example, it appears in engineering and actually there is some real examples constructed.
00:31:20.234 - 00:32:31.174, Speaker A: We introduce a weaker condition, weaker genericity condition. So gamma and theta are the same. We define q theta to be a finite extension field of q generated by the entries of theta gamma for all gamma. Since we assume that gamma is a finite group, this is finite external field. We say that the Cd symmetric tense security is generic module symmetry if the coordinate of representative vertices are algebraically independent over q theta. So instead of assuming the genericity of all, all the points, we can pick up representatives from each vertex orbit and we assume the genericity of them. Then here is a second theorem.
00:32:31.174 - 00:33:58.690, Speaker A: Let g sigma p be a ctosymmetric tensegrity custom theta and we assume some condition for the conic. Suppose for all vertex, for all vertex, I, I and its neighbors together spawn the span, the whole RD space. If g sigma p is generic modular symmetry and universally rigid, then it is super stable. So again in figures it refers to this range. This is because when gamma is a trivial group, generic module symmetry just is just genericity. So, so our theorem says that this is real picture. Okay, is there any question so far? If not, I, I should say about some related works, further related works.
00:33:58.690 - 00:34:54.616, Speaker A: So universal rigidity is actually there is none. There is no equivalent condition to the universal rigidity, which is the existence of sequence of stresses. And it is stronger than super stability. And it can be best interpreted as a facial reduction step. Okay. And there the result and hours do not collapse, because our result says that in some, under some genericity just one hyperplane is sufficient, is nest is, which just why just one hyper brain suffice. Yeah.
00:34:54.616 - 00:36:12.740, Speaker A: And there are some results, recent results, which says that the every genetic global digit graph can be realized as a genetically universally digit framework. And there is also a very deep result about global rigidity itself. It says that a generic framework is globally rigid if and only if there exists equilibrium stress omega such that the laplacian matrix is max rank in our language it is es two without PSD condition. So I move on to proofs. And this is not a very deep one though. I just remarked that the conic condition follows from. So, okay, yeah, what we want to do is to check super stability, but for chronic condition it follows from the previous result.
00:36:12.740 - 00:37:26.034, Speaker A: So I only check Es condition about, which is about equilibrium stress. Okay, so here is a very important idea and very good, very nice idea by Godran Thurston. So we, so we have a red point, which is a universal rigid point. And what we want is hyper plane which is parallel to PI and exposing the minimal face of the red one. So this orange one, to get this hyper plane, we take the projected, we consider the projected image of La Brachiencon and take the exposing supporting hyperbrain of this red point and we put it back to the whole space. This is the idea. But yeah, there is, of course there is a problem.
00:37:26.034 - 00:38:22.794, Speaker A: The coordinate shadow may not be exposed, so we may not get this appropriate hyperbrain age. So to couple with this, Goto and Thurston introduced a very nice lemma. So, and we use that as a black box. So I, may I talk about it? So let k be a semi algebraic set over field k, and x is a. X is called a generic point in k. If for any k coefficient polynomial f, f zero implies f is identically zero on s. And we say that x is a locally generic point.
00:38:22.794 - 00:39:26.436, Speaker A: If x is a generic point in k intersected with some neighborhood. So here's example. When k is the algebraic set defined by x times y calls zero, then this point on the x axis is not generic point because this is not a generic point. But if we take some neighborhood, then it is generic inside this border intersected with k. So this may be a local generic point. Here is a theorem by lemma by Godwin Thurston, which is a little bit long, but I go step by step. Let k be a closed convex line free semi azure x set over k line free means it contains no feed line.
00:39:26.436 - 00:40:38.164, Speaker A: So like this. And let PI be a projection where let PI be a projection, yeah. And let x be a point in k satisfying this condition, namely universal digit condition. Under this condition, if some condition star is satisfied, then we can take, and then there exists hyperbrain h in the lower dimension such that if we put it up, it exposes face of x. So this is what we want, right? And the condition we have to check is this. X is a locally generic point in extreme points of kick for some m. So where here m extreme points is a set that which is included in the m dimensional face of k.
00:40:38.164 - 00:42:22.936, Speaker A: So in this example, what we should do is to local generality with, within these smaller, smaller dimensional faces. Okay, is this remarkable. So what we do is to translate the problem to satisfy this and to check star, okay? So for tensegrities, in order to use that form, in order to use that grammar, we need to address slack variables. So first, so here is a. So these are the slack variables and we consider the projection from this bigger space to this space and our cone becomes the becomes this sky. Then even for ten segrities, the universal rigidity can be, can be interpreted in this, like this projected down and take its inverse image intersected. The core is a singleton type statement.
00:42:22.936 - 00:43:54.398, Speaker A: Okay yeah. So what we need to do is check star and in this case when the original p is generic, then p, then grammar x of p plus zero comma zero is locally generic. In d plus one, choose to extreme points of the cone. This is oga argyber brief. So since we know the facial structure of k plus, we can explicitly write down d plus one to extreme points, which is like this. And since the gram matrix of p has rank d and the rank is lower semi continuous, there exists a neighborhood of grammatrix of p such that inside a neighborhood the length of matrix is always at this d. And so we consider the sorry, so this is not right.
00:43:54.398 - 00:45:12.104, Speaker A: When we consider d plus one, choose two extreme points intersected with with this neighborhood. Then like this, so and the originality of the original piece implies that in this range, in this set, p transpose p zero is generic. So altogether it is locally generic. In d one extreme points, okay, after that is very easy. So by combining the claim and lemma, there exists a hyperbrain parallel to PI dash which is exposing the face of p transpose p comm zero. And when we take the normal vector of that hyperplane, then actually some strict properness follows from this exposing ness condition and also lung condition and PSG controls. So that's a desired certificate.
00:45:12.104 - 00:46:59.242, Speaker A: This is a proof of the theory one for the theorem two, the problem is becoming more complicated. So where we start is a generic module symmetry point configuration pull. And then because of some symmetry it is not even locally generic in max stream points of the Laplacian PSD Laplacian cone. So what we should do is to restrict ourselves to symmetric matrices. The set of symmetric matrices where I mean symmetric matrices is this. So it is a set of Laplacians which is invariant under some permutation, where this permutation is given by the action of gamma to the vertex set, and our cone is the intersection of this symmetric matrices with La pracien cone. So what we want to do is to check conditional star and it is like this.
00:46:59.242 - 00:48:21.462, Speaker A: The grammatrix of p is a locally genetic point in some extreme point of array plus gamma. And to prove this statement we use block diagonalization. I think this is an interesting point block diagonalization is like was used to employ symmetry for designing faster algorithm. And recently actually the combination with facial reduction appears, but we use it to analyze the facial structure of symmetric La pracien PSD Co. Because in order to prove this, this, this statement, we at least we have to understand the facial structure of this. Okay, and so, so, so this is a symmetric Laplacians. And what we do is to block diagonal lines.
00:48:21.462 - 00:49:53.344, Speaker A: Let gamma tilde be the equivalent class of DL irregular representations. Then the transformation can be written like this, so, which looks ugly and complicated. But the important point is it is just some of very known spaces. Okay, then some complication comes from the fact that we have to work over real numbers instead of complex numbers, and this comes from that not destroy is a uniqueness condition. Using this block diagonalization we can check star condition. So to make my presentation simple, we further assume that gamma is absolutely irreducible. Suppose D sigma p is a theta symmetric and let m load multiplicity of law in the point group theta.
00:49:53.344 - 00:50:55.544, Speaker A: Then we can check actually check star. Namely, if p is a generic module symmetry, then gram matrix, the image of gram matrix and upside is a locally generic point in some extreme points of the mapped cone. And by combining the goto thousands lemma plus this lemma, we can get our second server. So this is the final page. What we proved is necessity of surfaceability for generic tensegrities and generic tensegrities with symmetry. The corresponding program for global rigidity remains open. So.
00:50:55.544 - 00:51:11.004, Speaker A: But. Yeah, but I think it's out of the scope of SDP approach, I guess. Yeah, so. So. Thank you. This is the end of my talk.
00:51:19.724 - 00:51:23.464, Speaker B: Thank you, Ryoshan, any questions?
00:51:27.404 - 00:51:39.004, Speaker C: Yes, I have a remark. This is very good. It's very interesting.
00:51:39.464 - 00:51:40.404, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:51:47.744 - 00:51:48.884, Speaker C: Excuse me.
00:51:49.464 - 00:51:50.244, Speaker A: Yes.
00:51:52.904 - 00:53:15.874, Speaker C: Simon Guest and I have been writing a book for the last over ten years, and at the end of the book we have a discussion about super stable and, well, mostly super stable tensegrities with symmetry using group representation theory, mostly for finite groups in dimension three. I wonder if there's any overlap with what you're doing. The book as soon will come out at the end of this year, before the end of this year, but it's been in the works for many years. Also, I have some software where if you want to create a framework, a tensegrity with like the alternating group with five elements, the symmetric group with four elements, you can create one. It'll give you the lengths and so on that you need in order to build it, if that's what you're interested in. In fact, I don't know if you see, you can see some of the. Let's see if you can see my video.
00:53:15.874 - 00:53:28.124, Speaker C: You can see, for instance, this is an old, like this. I imagine your theory would work for this. Can you see this? I don't. This has.
00:53:28.584 - 00:53:30.992, Speaker A: Yes, I can see that. Yes.
00:53:31.048 - 00:54:05.864, Speaker C: This is the symmetry of a cube. Part of the. I think this is s four something, a symmetric group on four elements, something like that. It has 24 vertices. 24 of these vertices, yes. And so you can use representation theory to calculate the stress matrix and that gives you that kind of result. And I imagine it would connect with your thing.
00:54:05.864 - 00:54:41.944, Speaker C: There's no discussion of it being generic explicitly, but there's a range of parameters that you can choose for these structures and it's very limited. There's about the types of graph that you can choose, but nevertheless it gives you things like this. So I would imagine your symmetry, your discussion, your theory would work perfectly, reasonably well.
00:54:41.984 - 00:55:00.664, Speaker A: Yes, yes. I actually read the paper with you by you and terror, 1995.
00:55:02.484 - 00:55:05.704, Speaker C: And what paper was this.
00:55:07.724 - 00:55:11.724, Speaker A: Paper about?
00:55:13.584 - 00:55:32.324, Speaker C: Oh, with Maria Terrell. Yeah, that's one of the very early papers. Yes. That has to do with that. Isn't this thing that I'm talking about with representation? With that kind of representation theory? Yes. There are things like. I have some models like that.
00:55:32.324 - 00:55:49.140, Speaker C: This isn't quite it, but this is. This is an. I don't know if you could see it. It has this kind of symmetry. I'm playing games here. You can sort of destroy some of the symmetry by putting a different thing at one end. But it looks.
00:55:49.140 - 00:56:07.854, Speaker C: The things that Marie and I did are something like this. Right. That's a very early paper. I'm surprised we actually did the work well before that. Yes. So that's another. That's essentially the dihedral group.
00:56:07.854 - 00:56:23.814, Speaker C: And the .1 point about this, that all the vertices are equivalent under the symmetry. That simplifies this quite a bit. I think, in principle, with many of these things, you could just do the calculation and compute the stress matrix and compute the rank.
00:56:24.434 - 00:56:26.014, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. That's right.
00:56:27.154 - 00:56:36.554, Speaker C: And with modern computers today, it's not a problem, but it does simplify things quite a bit to use the symmetry, for what it's worth.
00:56:42.974 - 00:56:43.874, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:56:44.174 - 00:56:56.514, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you. Yes, yes.
00:56:57.394 - 00:57:09.094, Speaker A: So some people sometimes talk about your book with Simon, but I have never found it. So it will come soon. It will come.
00:57:11.514 - 00:57:45.974, Speaker C: We can send you a copy. It's been around for a long time. I also have software where you can design your own. Some of these things with the. The big finite groups, not the Tahiti, but you can decide on the ratio between. There's one degree of freedom in these structures. And you could decide on the ratio between the lengths of, let's say, the cables.
00:57:45.974 - 00:58:04.954, Speaker C: And then it'll show you a picture and it will tell you exactly what the lengths are. And so it can help you. It doesn't help you make it. You still have to make it. Some of them are quite hard to make physical, but you can do that.
00:58:05.934 - 00:58:09.034, Speaker A: Okay, so I send your email?
00:58:09.414 - 00:58:13.114, Speaker C: Yes, yes, please do. We'll send you a copy free of charge.
00:58:15.054 - 00:58:15.834, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:58:20.474 - 00:58:25.534, Speaker B: Any further questions? Why is my camera on?
00:58:26.754 - 00:58:31.034, Speaker C: Yes, this is very powerful talk. I'm very impressed. Thank you.
