00:00:27.074 - 00:01:47.004, Speaker A: Well, welcome everybody to the last week of our focus program. We continue with a theorem that I mentioned before, but one component was missing, and that is why I couldn't give a complete proof. Now I do it, thanks to the hint by Sheldon. So here is the theorem. H and k are rkhs on x and t. A mapping from h to k is linear. An important message here is that if you pick any f in h, then t of f is a function in K.
00:01:47.004 - 00:02:32.772, Speaker A: That's the meaning of this t from h to k, that that's important. But the one which was missing was this one. We also assume that. We also assume that for every x in our ambient set x, the mapping. We don't need to give a name to this, but it's a mapping from h to the complex set of complex number defined by taking f and mapping to tf. And note that tf now is a function in K. So it's a function which defined on x.
00:02:32.772 - 00:03:39.844, Speaker A: And we evaluate the that function at the point x, the point x is fixed, but for any such point, this mapping is continuous. So if you have a sequence fn in h which goes to f, then tfn at point x goes to tf at point x. And the conclusion is that then automatically t is a bounded operator. And here is the proof. We use the closed graph theorem. So for that to use.
00:03:47.584 - 00:03:52.004, Speaker B: Graph theorem, let's see on that.
00:04:02.054 - 00:04:11.234, Speaker A: You have a sequence fn which goes to f in h and t.
00:04:13.054 - 00:04:14.718, Speaker B: Goes to g in.
00:04:14.766 - 00:04:17.918, Speaker A: K. And our goal is to show.
00:04:17.966 - 00:04:18.554, Speaker B: That.
00:04:30.334 - 00:04:40.446, Speaker A: To show that t of f is equal to g and that we imply immediately by the closed graph here.
00:04:40.510 - 00:04:41.954, Speaker B: That t is bounded.
00:04:43.614 - 00:05:31.644, Speaker A: And now, based on our assumption, it's kind of immediate to deduce this is this conclusion, because when we have convergence in norm in Rkhs, we have convergence point wise. So this assumption implies that for every x in x, tf, n at the point x goes to glx as a sequence of complex numbers. But we had another assumption, too. That was the part which is missing. And now it helps us here.
00:05:34.624 - 00:05:35.008, Speaker B: This.
00:05:35.056 - 00:06:00.864, Speaker A: Assumption that for every fixed x, this mapping is continuous. I need it here precisely here. And also, moreover, tfn of x goes.
00:06:01.324 - 00:06:05.744, Speaker B: To t f of x two. This is by assumption.
00:06:07.644 - 00:06:28.860, Speaker A: Continuity of that mapping for every fixed x. And when we put this together, we conclude that g of x is equal to t, f of x, and for every x. And so g is equal to gf.
00:06:28.932 - 00:06:30.504, Speaker B: And that's the end of the.
00:06:32.664 - 00:06:50.924, Speaker A: So we are done, the special case that we used before. So it's a recall special case. H was a subset of K, and we considered the inclusion map e.
00:06:53.944 - 00:06:59.174, Speaker B: H to kick maps f to f.
00:07:01.114 - 00:07:07.738, Speaker A: And this is automatically continuous because both properties are satisfied.
00:07:07.906 - 00:07:08.734, Speaker B: I mean.
00:07:10.474 - 00:07:13.654, Speaker A: If we can, the map we need from H.
00:07:15.394 - 00:07:16.866, Speaker B: To C is.
00:07:16.890 - 00:07:22.434, Speaker A: The map which sends f to the image of f e f. It's not.
00:07:22.474 - 00:07:25.450, Speaker B: E f, it's e of f at.
00:07:25.482 - 00:08:30.744, Speaker A: The point x, which is equal to f of x. And we know this is continuous again by rkhs is continuous, and therefore that important property is satisfied. And also the inclusion really f in H, f is in k two by this assumption. So the inclusion map is, is bounded. And now I will use another application of this in more detail, but just let me mention the beginning. Then we go into further studies. Our last section of this course is about multipliers, and we discuss a bit about general multipliers, some of their properties, and then more specifically about multipliers in Hardy and Dirichlet spaces.
00:08:31.844 - 00:08:40.184, Speaker B: So let me start the session multipliers.
00:08:40.484 - 00:08:49.889, Speaker A: So h rkhs is given a function.
00:08:49.961 - 00:08:57.009, Speaker B: F, I better call it H. A.
00:08:57.041 - 00:08:59.129, Speaker A: Function h which is defined on the.
00:08:59.161 - 00:09:03.377, Speaker B: Same set with values in C, is.
00:09:03.425 - 00:09:04.533, Speaker A: A multiplier.
00:09:09.294 - 00:09:12.794, Speaker B: Of H. If.
00:09:16.134 - 00:09:22.638, Speaker A: For every f in h, when we multiply f.
00:09:22.686 - 00:09:26.194, Speaker B: By h, it stays in the space.
00:09:28.934 - 00:09:39.264, Speaker A: That's the point wise multiplier, which is simply saying multiplier. There are other types which are equally important, like Hadamard multipliers.
00:09:39.384 - 00:09:43.564, Speaker B: There were some talks about them, but that's another story.
00:09:44.104 - 00:10:14.864, Speaker A: And the notation that we use here is mof, sometimes moh, sorry, sometimes even more explicitly. We write Malta H because M is used in particular in the study of Dobrange Rovnyak spaces. M has a meaning. So we avoid to use m of hb, we use multi of hp.
00:10:16.804 - 00:10:24.304, Speaker B: That's the collection of all multipliers, functional hh and multiplier.
00:10:27.204 - 00:11:10.644, Speaker A: We usually work with this set. Sometimes we do a little bit of generalization, and a little bit is here. Instead of assuming that f multiplies the element of h into itself from h to h, we assume that it takes an element from h one and map it to an element in h two. It's, it's a little bit of general. Sometimes it's useful, and there are some interesting results. For example, the result of, I will mention freakin and Rios and Ross. When we consider different model spaces, something interesting happens.
00:11:10.644 - 00:11:15.524, Speaker A: So a bit of generalization.
00:11:26.804 - 00:11:58.924, Speaker B: So we can see that h one and h two to rkhs and h is in. Now we like we write malt of h one and h two, or simply m of h one and h two. If, or this set is the collection of for every f is in h one.
00:12:01.024 - 00:12:17.592, Speaker A: When we multiply, we obtain an element of h two. So either in this case, or in the previous special case, which is important, we can define a mapping.
00:12:17.728 - 00:12:29.424, Speaker B: And here is the definition m index h defined from space h one to space h two.
00:12:35.124 - 00:12:52.144, Speaker A: And maps f into hf. By definition is well defined. I mean, that's hidden in the definition of a multiplier. And clearly it's linear two, so well defined.
00:12:57.044 - 00:12:58.344, Speaker B: And linear.
00:12:59.804 - 00:13:43.420, Speaker A: But is it bounded? The only thing we need to verify, based on our general theorem is that for any fixed x, we look at the mapping from h one, the first space into the set of complex number, and it maps f into its image mh. That's a function, but that function evaluated at point x, this has to be continuous. But we know what this function is, because mh of is h times f, and evaluated at point x is h.
00:13:43.452 - 00:13:46.104, Speaker B: Of x f of x.
00:13:47.884 - 00:14:25.608, Speaker A: And the mapping, since h one is an rkhs, the mapping from h one to c which sends f into f of x, is of course continuous. That's maybe our first lemo, what we did in the first week. And then little h of x is just a constant. So therefore, sending f to h of.
00:14:25.656 - 00:14:30.324, Speaker B: X f of x is a scalar here, this is continuous.
00:14:32.444 - 00:14:39.596, Speaker A: So we immediately conclude that, and that's an important conclusion, that m in xh.
00:14:39.780 - 00:14:41.824, Speaker B: Is a bounded operator.
00:14:56.504 - 00:15:09.976, Speaker A: So in other words, if we consider the family of all operators, bonded operators from h one to h two, in some books they use l of h.
00:15:10.040 - 00:15:20.664, Speaker B: One and h two, l of h one and h two.
00:15:20.824 - 00:15:22.808, Speaker A: Some other books they use b for.
00:15:22.856 - 00:15:26.062, Speaker B: Bounded h one and h two.
00:15:26.238 - 00:15:27.594, Speaker A: So the set of.
00:15:29.974 - 00:15:33.554, Speaker B: Multipliers sits here.
00:15:34.334 - 00:15:36.754, Speaker A: Sits in the set of bounded operators.
00:15:37.094 - 00:15:41.674, Speaker B: And we study some properties of this. Now.
00:15:49.214 - 00:16:09.790, Speaker A: To give and a structure to the multiplier algebra, I mean, I already sleep from my mouth. Algebra, it's easy to see that it's an algebra, even a unital algebra, because when we consider the constant function one.
00:16:09.862 - 00:16:11.234, Speaker B: So it's a constant.
00:16:15.774 - 00:16:37.232, Speaker A: Function, then m of one, multiplication by one is the identity element, element. And it's very straightforward and easy to see that m of f plus or.
00:16:37.328 - 00:16:47.484, Speaker B: H plus m of h two, it's m of one plus h two. So it's.
00:16:51.704 - 00:17:13.605, Speaker A: These are straightforward and more importantly, m of h one, m of h two. Generally speaking, when you have two operators, say t one and t two, t one, t two is not the same as t two t one. But for the multipliers, it doesn't matter if you multiply by h two first and then by h one, or vice versa.
00:17:13.719 - 00:17:22.613, Speaker B: So this is equal to m of h two, m of h one, and it's the same thing. And multiplying by h one and h two.
00:17:23.473 - 00:18:30.164, Speaker A: So that is why we obtain a unital algebra inside b of h one and h two. And now we want to give a structure to this space to do so, I recall, I mean strategy that indeed we explored a couple of times, and it was very useful. Probably the most important case that we use this strategy was in the Moore's theorem. And it's a very simple idea, but very practical. You have a set a which has a structure, whatever I mean for us is an Rkhs. It can be a group, it can be a vector space, and algebra, whatever structure that can, even topological analytical structure. And then we have another set b, and we succeed to have a bijection between the two.
00:18:30.164 - 00:19:08.706, Speaker A: And as soon as we have the bijection, the set b is the same as the set a. I mean, we have just, I mean painted is its element with another color. So we can transfer this structure, whatever it is, to the other set and put it here. In our case is an RKhs. On a set a, we establish a bijection between another set and then transfer the Hilbert space and the whole Rkhs.
00:19:08.770 - 00:19:19.454, Speaker B: Structure to the second setting. And let's see what I mean by this very explicitly.
00:19:20.594 - 00:19:24.774, Speaker A: So here is the proposition which explains what I mean.
00:19:25.654 - 00:19:27.274, Speaker B: The proposition.
00:19:34.534 - 00:19:36.874, Speaker A: Edge is an.
00:19:38.574 - 00:19:41.714, Speaker B: Rkhs on x.
00:19:44.214 - 00:19:45.394, Speaker A: With kernel.
00:19:49.494 - 00:19:51.654, Speaker B: Kick.
00:19:51.804 - 00:20:33.664, Speaker A: That's our first thing. An f here is just a function, I mean, from x to c. We do not assume that iT's a multiplier now it's just a function. And you will see immediately why I consider this set h. Naught is the set of all elements. In the book the role of h and f, the way I wrote above, is interchanged, but it really doesn't matter. All elements of the space h which are killed by f, means that f.
00:20:33.744 - 00:20:44.286, Speaker B: Times h is equal to zero. So note that this sits in hook.
00:20:44.340 - 00:20:45.174, Speaker A: And then.
00:20:46.914 - 00:20:49.578, Speaker B: I defined h one to.
00:20:49.626 - 00:20:52.018, Speaker A: Be the orthogonal complement of this.
00:20:52.146 - 00:20:54.334, Speaker B: So it's h zero perp.
00:20:56.834 - 00:21:25.492, Speaker A: So definition up to here. Now put h index f. This is overset, equal to f times h. If f is a multiplier, then this, this will be a subset of h. BUt in general, I mean, this proposition is true even if f is not a.
00:21:25.508 - 00:21:27.384, Speaker B: Multiplier, is another set.
00:21:28.124 - 00:22:03.220, Speaker A: And writing h as orthogonal sum of h one and h zero. We see that fh f times h is equal to f times h zero plus f times h one. But f times h zero is zero. That's the way it is defined. That is why here I can write f h one. So this is the space we consider h index f. And on this set I, I do.
00:22:03.220 - 00:22:04.344, Speaker A: This definition.
00:22:07.244 - 00:22:08.904, Speaker B: Put the undefined.
00:22:15.044 - 00:22:21.412, Speaker A: Two elements of hf f h one f h.
00:22:21.468 - 00:22:23.580, Speaker B: Two two element of this.
00:22:23.772 - 00:22:47.182, Speaker A: So here I add an index hf. So this is defined to be the inner product of h one and h two in our original space, h and h one h two here are element of h one.
00:22:47.278 - 00:22:51.030, Speaker B: I define it this way, so it.
00:22:51.182 - 00:23:06.812, Speaker A: Sounds to be a bit complicated, but you will immediately see that there is nothing particular about this. It's a realization of what I explained here.
00:23:06.908 - 00:23:09.984, Speaker B: You will see more explicitly very soon.
00:23:11.844 - 00:23:18.584, Speaker A: Let me finish the theorem then. Here is the conclusion.
00:23:21.044 - 00:23:33.828, Speaker B: Hf is and rkhs with kernel with.
00:23:33.876 - 00:23:39.236, Speaker A: Kernel k. Let's put f index f.
00:23:39.300 - 00:23:50.744, Speaker B: Here at point xy is f of x k xy f y bar.
00:23:52.924 - 00:24:34.718, Speaker A: That's the end of the so I defined a new space and the new space is hf. And the fact that it's an rkhs is it should be trivial. Very elementary indeed. And here is the reasoning. Here is the set h. That's the set a that we had above, and we map it to the set hf by multiplying by f. So any element.
00:24:34.806 - 00:24:38.714, Speaker B: H here is mapped here to element hf.
00:24:39.614 - 00:25:48.994, Speaker A: So a function to a function. I cannot immediately apply this simple strategy because what I need here is a bijection. There should be a bijection between the elements of a and the elements of b. So between elements of h and, and hf, there is no on general, there is no bijection, because maybe there is a collection of elements that all of them are mapped to zero. And this is precisely what I called h zero. So now we need to establish out of this a bijection. The way we did is that this h zero inside h divides or partitions h into some cells, equivalence classes.
00:25:48.994 - 00:26:05.554, Speaker A: And we pick one element from each equivalence class, one element, and that is precisely h one. And now between h one and hf.
00:26:06.214 - 00:26:08.914, Speaker B: I mean, between these two.
00:26:10.934 - 00:26:40.140, Speaker A: There is a bijection. And as soon as we have a bijection, we can transfer the structure of h one, which is an Rkhs to that of hf. And this is precisely the definition. How do we transfer any structure? You consider two elements here, and you say that the product here is the same as the product of the pre images here. This is what I wrote here.
00:26:40.212 - 00:26:43.704, Speaker B: This is, this is precisely what I wrote here.
00:26:45.604 - 00:27:21.134, Speaker A: The product of any two elements is the product of the prey images. And the choice of h one and h two is unique. Now that's the reason for introducing h naught and its orthogonal complement. If by chance, in a special case, this h zero is just the z zero. We don't need to do this generality, and we have already a bijection. But I mean, generally we don't have.
00:27:21.594 - 00:27:24.734, Speaker B: We need to do it the way I explained.
00:27:25.234 - 00:27:41.294, Speaker A: So up to here it's trivial because of the bijection explained. The only thing we need to verify is that the kernel is given by this formula. And now.
00:27:43.114 - 00:27:45.094, Speaker B: Let'S verify this.
00:27:49.654 - 00:28:00.446, Speaker A: So for any y in the space x and for any h in h.
00:28:00.510 - 00:28:01.114, Speaker B: One.
00:28:05.054 - 00:28:07.134, Speaker A: What can we say about f.
00:28:07.174 - 00:28:09.914, Speaker B: Of y h y?
00:28:11.134 - 00:28:17.048, Speaker A: Well, f of y is a constant. For h of y I can write.
00:28:17.176 - 00:28:26.844, Speaker B: H and k y in the space h, because that's the reproducing can.
00:28:28.264 - 00:28:43.972, Speaker A: And now I use the fact that projection is, call it self adjoint. I mean p projection onto h one.
00:28:44.108 - 00:28:48.388, Speaker B: I simply write it p. I use.
00:28:48.436 - 00:28:51.972, Speaker A: Two properties, p equal to p star.
00:28:52.148 - 00:28:54.348, Speaker B: And also the fact that p over.
00:28:54.436 - 00:28:57.144, Speaker A: H one is equal to identity.
00:28:57.924 - 00:29:00.304, Speaker B: So f.
00:29:02.324 - 00:29:03.732, Speaker A: H is in h one.
00:29:03.788 - 00:29:10.634, Speaker B: So I can write phone nky h.
00:29:13.934 - 00:29:17.274, Speaker A: And transferring p to the other side.
00:29:27.614 - 00:29:29.274, Speaker B: I can write it this way.
00:29:30.054 - 00:30:06.136, Speaker A: And the good thing about this representation is that now both elements, this one and this one, both of them are in h one. Therefore I can rewrite the same identity as f at point y h p k. I mean, there is a notation for, in the book for p projection of ky on h one. Here they write it ky with a.
00:30:06.160 - 00:30:08.976, Speaker B: Super, super index one.
00:30:09.120 - 00:30:26.884, Speaker A: So we can, we can write instead of Pky, we can write ky one. It's the same thing, just a different notation. But the important thing here I can replace h by h one.
00:30:29.964 - 00:30:35.624, Speaker B: The main difference here is that h is replaced by h one here.
00:30:37.284 - 00:30:47.980, Speaker A: And why is this good? Because go back to the definition again here. When both elements even, it's better here.
00:30:48.012 - 00:30:52.100, Speaker B: That I write h or if you wish, h one.
00:30:52.252 - 00:30:59.424, Speaker A: When both elements are in h one, that's the definition of the forward image in Hf.
00:31:02.244 - 00:31:08.304, Speaker B: So I can write this is equal to still f of y is staying with us.
00:31:09.644 - 00:31:25.624, Speaker A: But I can write fh and f ky one. But now in this space hf. And note that the two elements here.
00:31:25.784 - 00:31:29.224, Speaker B: Now are elements of Hf.
00:31:29.304 - 00:31:34.644, Speaker A: So I succeeded to move from a space h one to a space hf.
00:31:34.944 - 00:31:40.360, Speaker B: And it's almost done, because I can.
00:31:40.432 - 00:31:45.480, Speaker A: Write this as fh and take f.
00:31:45.512 - 00:31:57.304, Speaker B: Of y inside f k y one fo y bar in hf h index.
00:31:57.764 - 00:32:07.964, Speaker A: And compare this with what we have at the beginning. That's fh at point y is equal.
00:32:08.004 - 00:32:12.944, Speaker B: To this is equal to this representation.
00:32:13.624 - 00:32:28.184, Speaker A: And this immediately implies that this is the kernel we were looking for. So the kernel of, I mean, I put an f here to show that it's in the space f. Hf at.
00:32:28.224 - 00:32:34.884, Speaker B: Point y is f k y one f.
00:32:36.864 - 00:32:44.134, Speaker A: Or if you want to bring x also into the picture, it's kyf.
00:32:44.434 - 00:32:54.494, Speaker B: At point x is f of x k y one at point x m for y bar.
00:32:55.194 - 00:33:45.140, Speaker A: Another way to write the same thing is that recall k one was the projection of k y into space h one. So if I write k two ky two, the projection into space h zero of the same kernel, then ky is indeed the orthogonal sum of ky one and ky two. And the interesting thing is that if you multiply both sides by f, then.
00:33:45.212 - 00:33:53.544, Speaker B: F k y is equal to f k y one plus f ky two.
00:33:54.004 - 00:34:36.132, Speaker A: By the very definition of space h zero, this is identically zero. So we obtain f ky is equal to f k y one. And this can be used here. This can be used here. So again, ky in this space hf is equal to f ky. I don't need to put one here because they are the same and f of y bar. So that's another formula.
00:34:36.132 - 00:34:42.868, Speaker A: All these formulas are equivalent, but the evaluation of this at the point x is more interesting.
00:34:43.036 - 00:35:27.854, Speaker B: Kyf evaluated at x is f of x k y bar, or more explicitly, capital k capital k. I can, I can put f now as an index of x, and y is f of x capital kxyf of y bar. That's the kernel for that space. The relation between k into both spaces.
00:35:34.234 - 00:36:23.628, Speaker A: Here, f of x f of y bar k x y. I mean, these are scalars. One might, I mean, wonder why I wrote fkxy and then f y bar. Why not, why not fxfy bar these two together and then k x y? Well, as long as you work with scalars, that's okay, there is no problem. But when we go to matrix value and vector valued functions, then the ordering is important. And that is why the authors here have been careful to keep an ordering which is not important here, but it's important in future. So even though, even though this is.
00:36:23.676 - 00:36:30.484, Speaker B: True, so, but better to forget it and write the way they wrote it.
00:36:30.524 - 00:36:36.740, Speaker A: Because in vector values it's important to write f of x first and f.
00:36:36.772 - 00:36:39.304, Speaker B: Of y bar at the end.
00:36:43.784 - 00:36:49.848, Speaker A: And now we arrive, I mean, using this proposition, we arrive at our main.
00:36:49.936 - 00:37:01.124, Speaker B: Theorem, that's main theorem, say, for multipliers.
00:37:08.164 - 00:37:47.554, Speaker A: This is in parallel with a theorem that we had before, which was a crucial theorem. It gives us a criteria to check whether a function is in this space or not. And even up to now I have used that result several times. Even I will use it today a couple of more times too. That was for the containment of an element in this space. So, but this, this result is of the same type, but for multipliers.
00:37:49.534 - 00:37:51.634, Speaker B: And here is this statement.
00:37:52.214 - 00:37:53.714, Speaker A: Well, h one.
00:37:56.314 - 00:38:13.414, Speaker B: And h two r khs on space x with kernels k one and k two.
00:38:14.434 - 00:38:47.292, Speaker A: We need to be a little bit careful here. K one is the kernel of h one. K two is the kernel of h two. We should not mix them with the k one and k two k two, which were in the proof of the previous theorem. In the previous theorem, k one and k two are the orthogonal decomposition of one of the kernels with respect to the spaces h zero and h naught. And. But here k one is the kernel of h one, k two is the kernel of h two.
00:38:47.292 - 00:39:06.698, Speaker A: And I emphasize on this because later on I need to decompose k one according to the recipe we had before. It means that k one should be written as, say k eleven plus k ten, as, as we had about.
00:39:06.826 - 00:39:08.894, Speaker B: So don't, don't mix them up.
00:39:10.514 - 00:39:12.534, Speaker A: And here f.
00:39:14.514 - 00:39:19.334, Speaker B: Is a function from x to c, a function.
00:39:24.694 - 00:39:26.646, Speaker A: Then the following are equivalent.
00:39:26.790 - 00:39:31.954, Speaker B: The following equivalent. First.
00:39:34.614 - 00:39:40.486, Speaker A: F is a multiply from h.
00:39:40.550 - 00:39:42.394, Speaker B: One into h two.
00:39:43.934 - 00:40:04.254, Speaker A: Tow a little bit more. But this has been done before. Indeed. And mof is a bounded operator.
00:40:11.934 - 00:40:16.794, Speaker B: We have seen this before. But still, to emphasize is important.
00:40:17.974 - 00:40:26.754, Speaker A: And the number three, that's the, the essence of theorem. There exists a constant c.
00:40:31.414 - 00:40:41.374, Speaker B: This is the constant, see positive, such that.
00:40:47.474 - 00:40:47.834, Speaker A: F.
00:40:47.874 - 00:40:54.834, Speaker B: Of x k one, x y f of y bar.
00:40:54.954 - 00:41:00.946, Speaker A: We know this is a kernel. This kernel is majorized by the kernel.
00:41:01.130 - 00:41:05.674, Speaker B: K two with a constant c two.
00:41:09.414 - 00:41:26.686, Speaker A: Recall that something like this is not a property, a point wise property. It means that for any n by n matrix formed with point x one.
00:41:26.710 - 00:41:28.062, Speaker B: Up, x two up to x.
00:41:28.118 - 00:41:43.370, Speaker A: Nice. Then you have a matrix on the left side, another matrix on the right side. If you take the difference, the difference is a positive operator for any values of n, and for any choice of.
00:41:43.402 - 00:41:45.974, Speaker B: The point x one, x two and x.
00:41:46.434 - 00:41:58.198, Speaker A: So in a sense, even though it's easy to write this inequality. It's a rather huge restriction on k.
00:41:58.246 - 00:41:59.874, Speaker B: One, k two and nf.
00:42:01.294 - 00:42:25.542, Speaker A: And moreover, I mean, the important message is the equivalent of one, two and three. Moreover, we can say a little bit, moreover, about the best constant c here, normal mf as an operator between h one and h two is the least.
00:42:25.598 - 00:43:01.694, Speaker B: Constant or is the best constant or the least constant c satisfying. Let me, let me call this star satisfying star proof of this.
00:43:03.754 - 00:43:15.094, Speaker A: Well, that two implies one is trivial. Indeed, the way in the book, it's.
00:43:19.044 - 00:43:34.824, Speaker B: It'S proof is like this. 1232 implies one, three implies two, and one implies three. I mean, that's the way done in the book.
00:43:36.044 - 00:43:48.504, Speaker A: The proof that two implies one is trivial. And even, I mean, I mentioned here that one implies two.
00:43:48.584 - 00:44:02.484, Speaker B: I mean, we saw already. Now let's, let's prove one implies three.
00:44:11.554 - 00:44:34.586, Speaker A: As before, we consider the space hf, which is f times h one, that's an rkhs. And we saw in the proposition, and.
00:44:34.610 - 00:44:35.854, Speaker B: By the position.
00:44:41.794 - 00:44:42.922, Speaker A: The kernel of this.
00:44:42.978 - 00:44:55.254, Speaker B: K f of x and y is equal to, I mean, we saw, but I repeat, k one, x y f. So that's again.
00:44:58.074 - 00:45:19.834, Speaker A: And what is our assumption? The assumption, well, one is our assumption. Let's look at, let's look at one again. F is a multiplier. It means that f times h one is in h two.
00:45:20.454 - 00:45:22.714, Speaker B: So our assumption.
00:45:28.314 - 00:45:30.654, Speaker A: F is in mult.
00:45:32.114 - 00:45:34.866, Speaker B: H one and h two is the.
00:45:34.890 - 00:45:38.906, Speaker A: Same thing as f times h one.
00:45:39.010 - 00:45:41.466, Speaker B: Is in h two, which is the.
00:45:41.490 - 00:45:42.734, Speaker A: Same thing as.
00:45:44.474 - 00:45:48.986, Speaker B: Not m, which is.
00:45:49.010 - 00:46:04.908, Speaker A: The same thing as hf is in h two. And now it's time to use that theorem about the inclusion. It's theorem 5.1 in the book. But it was the first theorem of.
00:46:04.956 - 00:46:09.036, Speaker B: This chapter that we started.
00:46:09.220 - 00:46:18.852, Speaker A: Whenever you have two rkhs, one is in another if and only if. But I just use one direction of this.
00:46:18.988 - 00:46:31.684, Speaker B: So by theorem, I add in parentheses theorem 5.1 in the book inclusion theorem.
00:46:36.304 - 00:46:41.684, Speaker A: This is equivalent with the relation constant.
00:46:42.504 - 00:46:44.644, Speaker B: C such that.
00:46:48.004 - 00:46:51.468, Speaker A: K, f, x and.
00:46:51.516 - 00:46:59.064, Speaker B: Y is majorized by the kernel of the other one. We can have a constant here too.
00:46:59.684 - 00:47:13.490, Speaker A: And even in that theorem, we saw that the best constant is the norm of the inclusion map that was a part of theorem 5.1. And so this implies that because we.
00:47:13.522 - 00:47:42.704, Speaker B: Know what is kf kf, it's written here, kf is this one. So we conclude that f of x, k x y, and is indeed k one space h one f y bar. That's the kernel of hf. This one is majorized by c two.
00:47:43.884 - 00:47:45.624, Speaker A: Kernel law of h two.
00:47:46.284 - 00:47:48.676, Speaker B: That's what we wanted to prove.
00:47:48.820 - 00:47:58.148, Speaker A: So indeed, one implies three. There is nothing profound in it, because the work is already done.
00:47:58.316 - 00:48:02.344, Speaker B: The work is theorem 5.1.
00:48:03.204 - 00:48:05.824, Speaker A: And finally, y three implies two.
00:48:08.024 - 00:48:13.568, Speaker B: No, this is what yes, one implies three.
00:48:13.616 - 00:48:14.204, Speaker A: Then.
00:48:16.864 - 00:48:18.608, Speaker B: Yes, two implies one.
00:48:18.656 - 00:48:39.490, Speaker A: Why one implies three. And now why three implies two? Again, again, we consider hf, which is f times h one, and we know.
00:48:39.522 - 00:48:41.014, Speaker B: What is its kernel.
00:48:42.394 - 00:48:48.746, Speaker A: And indeed we know that this is true. This is our assumption.
00:48:48.810 - 00:48:49.414, Speaker B: Now.
00:48:51.234 - 00:48:57.454, Speaker A: And one more time we use theorem 5.1, because theorem 5.1.
00:49:00.034 - 00:49:00.854, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:49:05.234 - 00:49:08.174, Speaker A: Theorem 5.1 says that.
00:49:10.114 - 00:49:11.854, Speaker B: Let me go a little bit.
00:49:13.594 - 00:49:25.320, Speaker A: If you have this inclusion, then you have this between the, this relation, between.
00:49:25.392 - 00:49:26.524, Speaker B: The kernels.
00:49:30.744 - 00:49:34.964, Speaker A: You have this, either this or this, they are the same.
00:49:37.224 - 00:49:37.632, Speaker B: And.
00:49:37.688 - 00:49:52.544, Speaker A: This is even only if I mean from this, you can also go back to this one. That's theorem 5.1. So I use that theorem again, saying that this property implies that so.
00:49:56.764 - 00:50:14.184, Speaker B: Implies that hf. So by 0.1, Hof is a subset of h two, which implies that f h one is a subset of h two.
00:50:15.844 - 00:50:19.948, Speaker A: And now let's decompose h one as we did above.
00:50:20.076 - 00:50:29.944, Speaker B: I mean, I write h one is equal to h 10 plus h eleven.
00:50:30.964 - 00:50:32.964, Speaker A: H 10 is the part which is.
00:50:33.004 - 00:50:36.836, Speaker B: Killed by f. I mean, f h.
00:50:36.900 - 00:50:43.932, Speaker A: Ten is equal to zero and h eleven is the orthogonal complement of that.
00:50:44.108 - 00:50:51.264, Speaker B: So. And h eleven is h 10 pip.
00:50:53.964 - 00:51:08.540, Speaker A: And so every element of h can be written as h zero and h.
00:51:08.612 - 00:51:17.544, Speaker B: One in these spaces. When this is in h 10, this is in h one one.
00:51:22.804 - 00:51:31.516, Speaker A: And now what can we say about, what can we say about the norm.
00:51:31.580 - 00:51:45.454, Speaker B: Of f h two? Now norm of f in h two. What can we say about this?
00:51:50.314 - 00:51:55.682, Speaker A: Well, first thing is that f h.
00:51:55.778 - 00:52:03.174, Speaker B: Is f h zero plus fh one. But the first one is zero, is just fh one.
00:52:03.874 - 00:52:08.850, Speaker A: So the normal fh is the same.
00:52:08.922 - 00:52:11.614, Speaker B: As the normal fh one.
00:52:15.274 - 00:52:18.634, Speaker A: And this is less than or equal.
00:52:18.674 - 00:52:20.986, Speaker B: To the constant, the same constant, which.
00:52:21.010 - 00:52:24.634, Speaker A: Is about, between the kernels, the normal.
00:52:24.714 - 00:52:28.774, Speaker B: F h one in space hf.
00:52:31.814 - 00:52:33.314, Speaker A: That is coming.
00:52:35.934 - 00:52:43.678, Speaker B: From, from this assumption, from this one, and the fact that when.
00:52:43.726 - 00:52:50.134, Speaker A: Hf is in h two, the inclusion map is continuous and the norm of.
00:52:50.214 - 00:52:53.630, Speaker B: The inclusion map is at most c.
00:52:53.702 - 00:52:56.608, Speaker A: The best constant here is the inclusion map.
00:52:56.806 - 00:52:59.344, Speaker B: So that is why I have c here.
00:53:02.204 - 00:53:11.476, Speaker A: And now I can write here c. And you see now why I did the decomposition, because now I can write.
00:53:11.540 - 00:53:18.824, Speaker B: This is equal to c, the norm of h one in h eleven.
00:53:19.724 - 00:53:33.010, Speaker A: If I keep h here, it's true. I mean, I can do the inequality. And I arrive here at fh in h of. It's true, but I cannot write this.
00:53:33.042 - 00:53:38.978, Speaker B: Is equal to the norm of h in h one. This is not true.
00:53:39.026 - 00:54:07.134, Speaker A: That is why I did this decomposition. But at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter, because we are interested in less than or equal and orthogonal decomposition. Normal h norm of h squared is norm of h zero squared plus norm of h one squared. So here I can write this less.
00:54:07.174 - 00:54:14.314, Speaker B: Than c norm of h in h squared in h one. Sorry.
00:54:15.414 - 00:54:21.302, Speaker A: So, even though this is not true, but still I arrive at the same.
00:54:21.358 - 00:54:23.574, Speaker B: Conclusion that I wanted.
00:54:24.594 - 00:54:27.934, Speaker A: And so this implies that Mof is bounded.
00:54:28.634 - 00:54:33.338, Speaker B: So this implies that Mof is bounded.
00:54:33.466 - 00:54:42.854, Speaker A: That's by comparing this part. Yeah, it will be without script, I'm sorry.
00:54:44.114 - 00:54:46.974, Speaker B: There will not be scale, it will be just.
00:54:49.134 - 00:54:50.830, Speaker A: I don't hear you well, I mean.
00:54:50.902 - 00:54:55.794, Speaker B: The line is cut. Am I audible?
00:54:57.854 - 00:55:00.046, Speaker A: Hello, hello?
00:55:00.150 - 00:55:01.154, Speaker B: Am I audible?
00:55:01.934 - 00:55:11.274, Speaker A: I hardly hear you. Do you have a question or comment?
00:55:12.854 - 00:55:14.714, Speaker B: Okay, let me see the chat.
00:55:17.444 - 00:55:24.024, Speaker A: There will not here, there is no square. And indeed, that is why.
00:55:24.524 - 00:55:26.156, Speaker B: Let me go back here.
00:55:26.300 - 00:55:38.044, Speaker A: That is why. That is why a square is here. The square is here. Because if you don't put square, then here you have to write root square.
00:55:38.084 - 00:55:38.944, Speaker B: Of c.
00:55:42.384 - 00:55:47.320, Speaker A: And if you mean this one. Yes, you are right.
00:55:47.352 - 00:55:50.032, Speaker B: I have to remove that. Sorry.
00:55:50.128 - 00:56:15.596, Speaker A: Maybe you meant this one, it will not be squared. Maybe you went me, you meant this. Yeah, you're right. So if I compare this with this precisely means that mf is bounded and also a restriction on its norm. And the norm is.
00:56:15.700 - 00:56:19.764, Speaker B: And the norm of mf is bounded.
00:56:19.804 - 00:56:34.364, Speaker A: By c. To finish and have a break, we can take mof to bc and start from this. Indeed, if we take.
00:56:36.064 - 00:56:37.404, Speaker B: So this is done.
00:56:37.704 - 00:56:50.024, Speaker A: If we take the constant to be c, then for any h one is.
00:56:50.064 - 00:57:00.054, Speaker B: In h eleven, we can write norm of f h one in h two.
00:57:02.034 - 00:57:04.386, Speaker A: Is less than or equal to the.
00:57:04.450 - 00:57:10.614, Speaker B: Normal mf, normal h one in h one.
00:57:15.514 - 00:57:21.306, Speaker A: And which is equal to the.
00:57:21.370 - 00:57:31.584, Speaker B: Normal mf, the normal f h one in this space mf.
00:57:33.564 - 00:57:37.452, Speaker A: And this inequality, again, by the same.
00:57:37.508 - 00:57:42.544, Speaker B: Theorem I mentioned before several times, implies.
00:57:44.724 - 00:57:50.998, Speaker A: Implies this box formula with c precisely.
00:57:51.046 - 00:57:54.154, Speaker B: Equal to the normal f. So this.
00:57:56.654 - 00:57:57.554, Speaker A: Implies.
00:58:03.054 - 00:58:23.574, Speaker B: F of x, k one x and y f less than or equal normal nf squared k two x and y.
00:58:25.074 - 00:58:30.954, Speaker A: And that is why I said the best constant, the least constant is normal.
