00:00:00.160 - 00:00:07.394, Speaker A: You Christian? Okay, sorry. Can you hear me?
00:00:10.054 - 00:00:10.822, Speaker B: No.
00:00:10.998 - 00:00:13.714, Speaker C: John Ogier, you should probably do the join. Ogyu.
00:00:14.814 - 00:00:16.994, Speaker D: Okay, I can hear you.
00:00:18.054 - 00:00:20.470, Speaker A: Okay, but maybe.
00:00:20.582 - 00:00:22.366, Speaker D: Maybe the local participants can't.
00:00:22.510 - 00:00:23.634, Speaker C: Just a moment.
00:00:50.084 - 00:00:50.984, Speaker B: Okay.
00:01:05.784 - 00:01:08.376, Speaker A: Robert, can you maybe say something to.
00:01:08.520 - 00:01:08.824, Speaker C: Sure.
00:01:08.864 - 00:01:10.104, Speaker D: What would you like me to say?
00:01:10.264 - 00:01:10.680, Speaker C: Just.
00:01:10.752 - 00:01:14.848, Speaker A: Just for testing. It's our fault. So we also don't hear Robert.
00:01:15.016 - 00:01:18.520, Speaker C: Okay, John, audio is a good idea.
00:01:18.552 - 00:01:19.124, Speaker B: No.
00:01:26.104 - 00:01:26.584, Speaker C: But.
00:01:26.664 - 00:01:26.896, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:01:26.920 - 00:01:27.344, Speaker A: Okay, so.
00:01:27.384 - 00:01:29.844, Speaker D: But I can hear you, Matthias.
00:01:30.424 - 00:01:32.124, Speaker A: Yes, now we hear you.
00:01:32.904 - 00:01:50.504, Speaker C: Okay, thank you. Can you hear me? Yes, thanks, Robert. Okay, I guess they should just start.
00:01:51.804 - 00:01:57.020, Speaker A: Yeah, so I can. I'm supposed to chair.
00:01:57.212 - 00:01:57.540, Speaker B: So.
00:01:57.572 - 00:02:16.086, Speaker A: Welcome everybody. Yeah. Today's speaker in the seminars, Boaz Klatak, and he will talk about romanian rigidity of remaining embeddings of discrete metric spaces. Thank you.
00:02:16.230 - 00:02:49.268, Speaker C: Okay, thanks. Hello, everybody. Let me begin by thanking the organizers Christina Soromani and Robert Mekan for inviting me to speak in this special semester on non smooth somalian organization geometry. And indeed, as we just heard, I'm going to talk about. First of all, it is my joint work with Matani Elat, the graduate student at the white man Institute in Israel. And I'm going to talk about some remaining aspects of discrete metric spaces. I think.
00:02:49.268 - 00:03:59.334, Speaker C: I'm not sure, but I think that maybe our framework is not entirely the usual setting in low regularity geometry. If I got it right, then usually in low gradient geometry, people study Alexander spaces, or these spaces of Sturm and not villani, and these spaces are non smooth. But in these spaces, usually when you have two points, x and y, in many cases you have the full nice geodesic connecting them. On the other hand, if you have a discrete metric space, just points that are each point in its own neighborhood, then typically the midpoint between x and y is not available to you because it's not in your space. You cannot easily construct comparison triangles and do things that are, I guess, more common in locality geometry. Okay, that said, let me understand the rules in this seminar that the first lecture of today is going to be introduction. So I'm going to proceed with rather slow introduction to this topic.
00:03:59.334 - 00:04:48.054, Speaker C: And please feel free, both the people on zoom and the people in this class, please leave it to stop and interrupt me at any time if you have questions. Okay, so what is our setting throughout this lecture? M is going to be remain manifold. In fact, it's going to be a complete connected dimensional imaging manifold. Okay, so for instance. So for instance, you could think on some surface in r three. That's completely fine example. So if this is r three, then we can try to draw some null surface.
00:04:48.054 - 00:05:21.804, Speaker C: I don't know. This kind of scarf is some german surface which we denote by m. It is a sub manifold of r three. Okay, and what is the meaning of this word? Complete and connected? Connected means that there is just one connected component. You don't have two separate surfaces and complete. This means that if you have any Cauchy sequence in this, this manifold, if you have any sequence of points whose distance is ten to zero, then the limit point is also inside your Manifold.
00:05:22.144 - 00:05:22.536, Speaker B: Okay?
00:05:22.560 - 00:05:41.434, Speaker C: So you cannot, if you take some, some nice surface in our sphere, no sphere, a towel, a cylinder, and you take away one point, then it's no longer complete because you can tend to this point. But oops, the limiting point is not in your Manifold. Okay, so this is completely connected. Now, given two points, x and y, on, on the manifold.
00:05:43.414 - 00:05:44.150, Speaker B: You can look.
00:05:44.222 - 00:06:24.304, Speaker C: On curves on the manifold connecting them, and each curve has a length. In the case of a surface in r three, the length is just the length of the equilibrium metric. We all know to measure the length of a curve in interdimensional space, but the curve is confined to stay on the manifold. And when you take the infumo over all lengths of osage curves, you get the distance d of xy. Okay, that's the remaining, maybe I should write the m of xy. This is the remaining distance between x and y. Okay, so for any two points, the info of the length of the curve, the remaining distance.
00:06:24.304 - 00:07:08.434, Speaker C: And this means that we kind of view remaining manifold as a metric space. It's a completely legitimate point of view to think intrinsically, if you want, when you remind manifold as being a metric space. Okay, so we understand in embedding. So what's an embedding? So, definition, suppose that x is a metric space. So you have some distance function. It could be finite or infinite, we don't care. Then we say that x embeds, let's say we write, it's more popular.
00:07:08.434 - 00:07:40.494, Speaker C: We say that x embeds in m. And we write this symbol. If there is a map from x to the manifold which preserve distances. So the distance between, for an x and y, if you measure the distance at x, it's the same as the distance between f of x and f of y on the manifold.
00:07:41.194 - 00:07:41.610, Speaker B: Okay?
00:07:41.642 - 00:08:26.214, Speaker C: So if you look at this example here, if I don't know if a metric space with three points, x, y and z, then I mean that the length of these geodesics, the three of them, should be exactly what is given by the data of the metric space. Okay, so that's an embedding. It's f is definitely one to one. Okay, let's begin with a non example. So which metric spaces do not embed in any remaining manifold? So these are branching metric spaces. So I'm given a space x of four points. And let me tell you the distances.
00:08:26.214 - 00:08:48.986, Speaker C: So these are four in .123 and four. And the distances will be maybe, okay, this would be one, this would be one, and this would be two. So this means that if I put them on a manifold, then this point is a midpoint of that curve, but I also make it a midpoint of another curve like this. And this distance could be whatever you.
00:08:49.010 - 00:08:51.874, Speaker B: Want one as well.
00:08:53.414 - 00:09:00.198, Speaker C: Okay, in this case, if I try to embed this example in manifold, what would happen? I'd have a geodesic.
00:09:00.286 - 00:09:03.678, Speaker B: So this would be a geodesic because.
00:09:03.726 - 00:09:24.738, Speaker C: This is one, this is one, and this is two. So this point must be in the middle of a minimizing logistic between these two points. But also this will be geodesic. Why is the blue geodesic? For the same reason. One, one and two. So these two are geodesics. But in the remaining manifold, if two geodesics overlap, then they coincide.
00:09:24.738 - 00:10:12.054, Speaker C: Right. If you begin to go in certain direction on a minimizing geodesic, you cannot just split and get two minimizing geodesics. Okay, so the tangent here kind of points in two different direction, which is impossible. So in this case, you don't have any embedding in any human manifold. So x does not embed in m for any, for any m, okay, and the space is non branching if it does not contain four points with this property. So, okay, so space is branching metric space if it contains four points. So there is a local obstruction for the historical bending magic metric space.
00:10:12.054 - 00:10:51.594, Speaker C: So it contains four points which are not collinear. So it's not that you have these four points. You cannot embed them in a line, distance being the distance on the line, but they contain two collineal triplets. Okay, so that's a non example. All right, now.
00:10:54.014 - 00:10:54.470, Speaker B: Question.
00:10:54.542 - 00:10:56.314, Speaker C: Anything, please.
00:10:57.814 - 00:11:07.452, Speaker E: Okay, so you're saying for this, this branching metric space, the metric space doesn't embed into the Romania manifold because Nisr.
00:11:07.468 - 00:11:10.156, Speaker C: Finsler, by the way, NiSr Finsler, not.
00:11:10.180 - 00:11:34.454, Speaker E: Even Finsler, okay, because like you said, you have geodesics that aren't coinciding, that separate. But if you were to lower the regularity of the riemannian manifold to, like, continuity, then in that case, you know, this property of geodesics or, I mean, you don't even have geodesics in that. In that case. And so you can have different length minimizers or something. So is there a statement?
00:11:35.034 - 00:11:39.850, Speaker C: So maybe I should emphasize. So the manifold itself is smooth.
00:11:39.922 - 00:11:40.574, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:11:41.954 - 00:11:46.554, Speaker C: The metrics that the non smooth, if you like, comes from the discrete subsets.
00:11:46.714 - 00:11:47.802, Speaker E: Okay, so my question.
00:11:47.858 - 00:11:58.514, Speaker C: So the question would be, so such a manifold, as you say, would have, if it's a minute, would have curvature minus infinity or something completely. Yeah. If it's a c one remaining manifold, such a picture cannot exist. The c one remaining manifold.
00:12:00.054 - 00:12:05.302, Speaker E: But even. What about a c zero? Like, with just a continuous metric?
00:12:05.478 - 00:12:14.154, Speaker C: Could it exist in a continuous metric? I have no idea. This is a pathology that I don't know.
00:12:16.094 - 00:12:26.834, Speaker D: And of course, I guess that these branching, you could. I mean, this needs to be a boundary in this manifold, because you can embed this example into a manifold with boundary. But that's not what you want. Right?
00:12:28.254 - 00:12:29.702, Speaker C: I could not hear you over.
00:12:29.878 - 00:12:37.414, Speaker D: Oh, sorry. I was just saying that it's important that these manifolds not have boundary because.
00:12:37.494 - 00:12:41.910, Speaker C: Yeah. Without boundary. Right, right. Smooth and without boundary. Right. That's a good one. Yeah.
00:12:41.910 - 00:12:53.694, Speaker C: Yeah. Smooth and no boundary. Right? Sure. Right, sure. Yeah.
00:12:54.074 - 00:12:54.458, Speaker B: So.
00:12:54.506 - 00:13:14.902, Speaker C: So we look at remain into decent remaining manifold. If you have a sizzle remaining manifold. Can you get branching examples? I don't know. So. So would you call this thing remain. So, would you call this thing remaining manifold? If so, then yes, sure. If this is my.
00:13:14.902 - 00:13:17.154, Speaker C: For you, then this is a bundling minor manifold.
00:13:19.734 - 00:13:33.554, Speaker D: I think the point of the example of the c zero example was that the geodesic equation solutions exist, but they're not unique. And so then you can get this kind of branching phenomenon. When you want to apply the Picard theorem. The vector field isn't Lipschitz.
00:13:34.174 - 00:13:40.134, Speaker C: So in this usual example, do you have a geodesic equation? Do you have Christopher symbols? Do we have zero.
00:13:45.114 - 00:13:49.274, Speaker E: For c one riemannian manifold? You would have the Judy's equation, but you don't have.
00:13:49.354 - 00:13:52.506, Speaker C: You need c eleven, right? You need to be leap sheets in order to have. Yeah.
00:13:52.530 - 00:14:03.410, Speaker E: So not c eleven, because that would guarantee uniqueness of Judy's exposure. So just c one, and then you can have branching. And so then maybe this could be embedded into one of those types of manifolds. I don't know.
00:14:03.442 - 00:14:14.820, Speaker C: It's just a question. Okay. Anyway, the demand money for the. For me should be. I would not. I mean. Yeah, that's good.
00:14:14.820 - 00:15:27.806, Speaker C: More questions. Okay, so there is a folklore result. I'm not sure where you treat them actually, but also know about it that if you have any finite metric space embeds asymmetrically in romanian surface non branching, no branching in two dimensional magnetic surface. Typically of hygiene. Let me explain to you this result in an example. So suppose your space, geometric space has five points. Let's make it without coordinating points.
00:15:27.806 - 00:15:44.434, Speaker C: So it's actually, this can be weakened to be non branching. Then how would you embed it into a two dimensional germanian surface? So let's first of all invade topological c graph in a torus. So let me draw a torus.
00:15:46.454 - 00:15:46.742, Speaker B: And.
00:15:46.758 - 00:15:56.614, Speaker C: I put my five points here. So, as we know, the complete graph on five vertices can be embedded in the tools.
00:15:56.994 - 00:15:57.842, Speaker B: So how do you do it?
00:15:57.858 - 00:16:31.844, Speaker C: So we need this, this one, and this. Okay, so you can get ten these joint curves connecting these five points. And now you can basically find a smooth remaining metric on these terms so that these will be the geodesic. You put the metric to be the, tends to be rather similar on the curve that you chose, you align. This is correctly, and the metric is huge outside these things. So you get the correct distances. And if you have more than five, you have six or seven, you just need bigger genus.
00:16:32.504 - 00:16:33.244, Speaker B: So.
00:16:35.184 - 00:17:44.944, Speaker C: This folklore result kind of tells you that, I mean, you cannot quite detect that many things from knowing that, from knowing about knowing the distance in some sense. So even if you take, know in r three, some net, in some big box, I don't know, grid of 100 by 100 by 101 million points, and you look at distances, this still embeds in two dimensional minor surface. It does not even detect the fact that it came from a 3d space if you don't restrict the topology. And the question that we like to ask is, how about the countable case? So suppose that I want some biscuit metric space, but not a finite one. So what about countable matrix spaces? And let's start with an example of a counterpart network space. So for instance, let's take a net in RN. So what is a net? X in Rn is a net or a delta net.
00:17:44.944 - 00:19:09.154, Speaker C: Sometimes people say if there exists some number delta, such as a delta net, such that any point in the rn is of distance, at most delta from one of the points in the net, you create that distance. Okay, this is Euclidean, this thesis, okay, so nth just collection of points in the plane that nothing is too far from the net, okay? For example, a lattice, any lattice is a net, okay? For the lattice is a net, any dimension lattice is a net in r. Because if you have a lattice, then surely if delta is big enough, then all points are boundary distance from the net. And the question is whether you can suppose that you embed euclidean net in some manifold. What can you learn about that manifold? Is it, the situation like here is that large parts of the manifold are not covered at all, but geodes and you know very little about them. Okay, so a net is a metric space, euclidean distance. Okay, so X D is the induced euclidean distance.
00:19:09.154 - 00:20:37.482, Speaker C: And our first result is that there's a difference between the finite and the count obliques. So suppose that x is an f is an app and m is a two dimensional remainder manifold. Close, okay, smooth, connected, complete, remain manifold, which contains a copy of x, isometric copy of x. Then m is flat. So since m is smooth, it has a curvature tensor and you can compute it and it's zero. And in fact, it has isometric to the plane. Okay? So even though you have geometry with lots of gaps, without your disc, without curves, without tensors, just we have kind of a crowd of points, each one for its own.
00:20:37.482 - 00:21:08.824, Speaker C: You can still determine the full remaining structure of the manifold if you know the distance is on this set alone. Okay, it's not even c zero manifold, it's just on cloud. Okay, so this is the ethereum one. Let me remark. So, any questions? Yes. That's something that we talk a lot. Don't worry.
00:21:08.824 - 00:21:16.974, Speaker C: I mean, we don't. Okay, we know it's. Yeah.
00:21:17.714 - 00:21:27.254, Speaker D: Can we come back to the theorem for a minute? Yeah, so I don't. Sorry, I can't see that blackboard. If you put, if the camera person thinks.
00:21:29.394 - 00:21:31.986, Speaker C: Which blackboard? You want to see this one, this one, this one.
00:21:32.010 - 00:21:33.334, Speaker D: This is perfect. This is great.
00:21:34.594 - 00:21:35.454, Speaker C: Okay.
00:21:37.154 - 00:21:55.938, Speaker D: So you mean. So we embed it. Sorry, you say any finite metric space that embeds in a 2d romanian surface. No, no, sorry, this is. I'm sorry, I'm missing the punchline again. Where was the punchline? You said if you have finite metric.
00:21:55.986 - 00:22:24.324, Speaker C: Spaces, you can always put them on a surface, and you cannot, I mean, there are many, many different surfaces of the embedded metric space. You cannot, you cannot determine the complete geometry for the matrix space. You don't know much about it. For instance, you don't have a finite metric space that requires three dimensional spaces, while we'll see in a second examples of metric spaces that do not because they are intrinsically three dimensional, for instance. Okay.
00:22:26.624 - 00:22:45.426, Speaker D: So the point of this theorem is that I start out with a euclidean net in the euclidean plane, and then isometrically embedded into some other manifolds. And then the conclusion is that m is flat and isomorphic to, maybe isometric to. What's the conclusion? I still can't see the blackboard. What's the conclusion on the blackboard?
00:22:45.490 - 00:22:50.894, Speaker C: To flat r two. Oh, so, mom. Okay.
00:22:53.154 - 00:22:58.918, Speaker D: Could it not be the torus? I'm confused. Oh, it's not. It won't be isometric in the torus. Okay, I understand. Thanks.
00:22:59.106 - 00:23:12.726, Speaker C: It cannot be a trough. No. It's flat Earth two. Just for example, instead of power presentation, somehow. Hyperbolic plane. Hyperbolic plane. I will discuss this, too.
00:23:12.726 - 00:23:22.294, Speaker C: You ask questions that are. Will be discussed sometimes correct. Sometimes interact. Yeah. Sometimes, yes. That's a good question for yes. That's something.
00:23:22.294 - 00:23:23.674, Speaker C: We'll discuss this. Yes.
00:23:26.784 - 00:23:27.964, Speaker B: More questions.
00:23:29.224 - 00:23:31.936, Speaker C: Okay, so just one question.
00:23:32.120 - 00:23:36.256, Speaker A: The manifold is smooth here or it's smooth.
00:23:36.320 - 00:23:41.896, Speaker C: It is smooth. Yes, it is smooth. I don't know if it is c two or c three, but it is smooth.
00:23:42.080 - 00:23:42.964, Speaker B: Okay.
00:23:43.384 - 00:23:44.120, Speaker C: Okay.
00:23:44.232 - 00:23:44.800, Speaker A: So you.
00:23:44.872 - 00:23:46.324, Speaker B: Okay, thanks.
00:23:52.844 - 00:24:27.234, Speaker C: Okay, so I just want to remark that this is a purely remaining phenomenon. So it fails for the Finsler manifold. So if you have Finsler manifold. So you can do the following trick. You can take. This is an example that appears basically in. You can take the euclidean plane, you can have some nether, and you can take a disk disjoint for all of these points.
00:24:27.234 - 00:24:54.380, Speaker C: And you can perturb the metric inside in a Finstler way. So not rimannian, but a fizzler perturbation inside the disk so that all outside from the outside are not altered. So in the Fiesta case, there is no hope for such strong rigidity orange that you can detect the full manifold from this. Except. But in the romanian case, it does hold true. Okay, now about. I want to discuss the higher dimensional case.
00:24:54.380 - 00:25:08.864, Speaker C: I know. Wait. No, sorry. First, I want to discuss some corollary. So, the corollary is that if x in r three, for example, is some set which is not contained.
00:25:12.314 - 00:25:12.658, Speaker B: In a.
00:25:12.666 - 00:26:01.554, Speaker C: Two dimensional in a plane, but contains some net in some plane, than for any m which is two dimensional, x does not embed in m. So such a metric space requires a three dimensional modifier in order to be embedded. So let's. I mean, an example is that just take some lattice in r two and add one point in three dimensions.
00:26:02.514 - 00:26:03.454, Speaker B: So if.
00:26:06.754 - 00:26:33.288, Speaker C: X is z two times zero, and you add to the point, then this has what we call asymptotic dimension three. Because. Because it embeds in three reals.
00:26:33.336 - 00:26:33.520, Speaker B: Right.
00:26:33.552 - 00:27:07.266, Speaker C: It is substorm three measure manifold. But you added just one point to the Euclidean to the lattice, and it does not embed in any two dimensional immune manifold. Okay, now what about rn? So in rn, we kind of still struggle. Let me tell you what we know. This is answer over here. So in rn. So suppose that x in rn is a lattice and not a lattice in it, m is n dimensional remaining manifold complete.
00:27:07.266 - 00:27:42.604, Speaker C: Correct. Xmos such as x inventing m. So we don't exactly know. We cannot say immediately that m is isometric to rn, but m is diphromorphic. At least, at least we detected topology to rn. If n equals four, that's not the exotic r four, but the flat r four. Okay, so that's a partial result.
00:27:42.604 - 00:27:52.284, Speaker C: Towards your question, let me remark that, okay, so there are some cases where we know.
00:27:54.214 - 00:27:55.062, Speaker B: Okay, if you add a.
00:27:55.078 - 00:28:38.494, Speaker C: Sum, okay, so this is kind of, Matan is exactly working on these things. Now under some assumptions you get isometric. So for instance, if you know that the metric tends to be supported, it's true. Second remark is that here, this is also here, you don't have to be a euclidean net for this thermomorphic part of the proof is kind of more soft. And for it, this, this is more general. And this works for also for non euclidean spaces, say for the hyperbolic plane. For some discrete sets, you can also detect the deformable fusion type.
00:28:38.494 - 00:29:03.710, Speaker C: Okay, but I cannot, uh oh. Okay. Yes, I can. Oh, I cannot really. Huh.
00:29:03.862 - 00:29:04.754, Speaker B: Let's see.
00:29:05.374 - 00:29:09.834, Speaker C: This should go a bit up. This goes all the way down.
00:29:14.104 - 00:29:16.808, Speaker B: Can you see okay?
00:29:16.936 - 00:29:18.016, Speaker C: I think it's okay.
00:29:18.160 - 00:29:18.608, Speaker B: Okay.
00:29:18.656 - 00:29:44.704, Speaker C: Hi, Robert. Hi, Bob. Okay, yeah. So there are also some other partial results. For instance, we know, it seems that we know that X would be also a net in the target manifold. In dimensions, there are some partial, but we don't still have a complete answer. In dimensions, the finite case.
00:29:44.704 - 00:29:52.344, Speaker C: Ah, sure, sure. Yeah. So you can have. Yeah, you can have things that definitely. You can have.
00:29:53.364 - 00:29:54.228, Speaker B: Yeah, you can have.
00:29:54.276 - 00:30:04.396, Speaker C: You can. Okay, you can have. How do you construct negative result? Take a countable set so that all geodesics miss a certain region. You wonder if all of them miss.
00:30:04.420 - 00:30:09.552, Speaker B: And you can, yeah, no, yes, you.
00:30:09.568 - 00:30:14.200, Speaker C: Can have a net. You put a little mushroom kind of.
00:30:14.232 - 00:30:23.284, Speaker B: Growing from some point and then yes. More questions.
00:30:23.704 - 00:30:50.112, Speaker A: Can I maybe ask a question just about? Will you specify more about countable examples? Because I probably of a net does not need. So a net does not need to be countable. Maybe uncountable is counter accountable. Examples sort of do they give results is accountable.
00:30:50.248 - 00:31:02.870, Speaker C: And that is in r two is infinite. So if it's not countable, then you even have more information. If you know that something uncountable embeds in Microsoft, it's only easier for you, you have more information.
00:31:02.982 - 00:31:07.234, Speaker A: So countable is really some, some interesting special case.
00:31:08.134 - 00:31:10.274, Speaker C: It is the non trivial case. Yes.
00:31:10.734 - 00:31:14.070, Speaker B: Okay. Yes, yes.
00:31:14.102 - 00:31:21.954, Speaker C: It's not just right, we don't use the fact it's countable. Yes, please. But infinite, it's used.
00:31:23.174 - 00:31:32.142, Speaker E: So for your second remark, you say it also works for some new non nuclear, yeah. I mean, I can see how there might be an analog hyperbolic space.
00:31:32.278 - 00:31:37.814, Speaker C: Yes, that's what I'm thinking about. Spherical space, you, sphere is compact.
00:31:37.894 - 00:31:38.222, Speaker E: Yes.
00:31:38.278 - 00:31:42.774, Speaker C: So I'm not quite sure what would be a good formulation in the case of the sphere.
00:31:42.854 - 00:31:43.254, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:31:43.334 - 00:31:49.294, Speaker C: So maybe for, I mean, for the sphere you have, you want infinitely many points in the sphere.
00:31:49.334 - 00:31:54.834, Speaker E: I don't want infinitely many points. I think maybe the analog would be a finite number of points that would still satisfy this net condition.
00:31:55.364 - 00:32:26.296, Speaker C: Now this cannot be, because if you have just five points, then there are regions in the spheres that are not covered by the radio descripts. And if you modify the metric there, you cannot detect that. So if you have in the sphere just fine, too many points, you cannot detect the topology, definitely not the metric of the sphere. So if you just think, let's see, so you have some, this is the sphere, you have some points. One 2317 points. So just all the great arcs for netting them.
00:32:26.360 - 00:32:30.448, Speaker B: Okay, suppose now I take a region.
00:32:30.496 - 00:32:36.124, Speaker C: That is not covered by these finely many arcs, and I grow a big mushroom.
00:32:36.584 - 00:32:37.288, Speaker B: Okay?
00:32:37.416 - 00:33:03.954, Speaker C: Huge mushroom here I put little statue of Robert. Okay? I can do whatever I want on the, and the Jurassic would just, would never detect that. Yeah, so, so, so, yeah, so I don't, I don't have a good formulation of this for the. So I have, okay. In general, I think that there is, okay, this is, let me just kind of wave hands. There is a finite effect. So there is an effect that you could see in a finite metric space.
00:33:03.954 - 00:33:15.524, Speaker C: What's the effect if you have, say, finite net, suppose you take, I don't know, all latitude, I mean, net of one epsilon net in s two. Okay, epsilon, there's one over epsilon square points.
00:33:16.264 - 00:33:17.124, Speaker B: Okay.
00:33:17.904 - 00:33:28.444, Speaker C: If you know all distances, my feeling is that you cannot recover the full geometry of the manifold, but you do recover geometry in a much, much smaller scale than epsilon.
00:33:29.224 - 00:33:29.680, Speaker B: Okay?
00:33:29.712 - 00:33:48.534, Speaker C: So somehow I know something about in the scale of epsilon Square. I don't know. That's kind of, I don't know how to make a theorem that I can prove, but that's the feeling, my friend, just gives you a smaller, smaller scale. And if you have a net, then okay, go all the way to zeros and you recover everything. That's kind of, but that's not math, just.
00:33:48.694 - 00:33:49.514, Speaker B: Okay.
00:33:50.654 - 00:34:02.182, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Where was I? Ah, yeah. Okay. So, so I said that. Okay, so yeah, for the bodily plane, things like that.
00:34:02.182 - 00:35:00.634, Speaker C: Yeah, we have examples of this side. Sometimes you need more than it, sometimes. Okay, not entirely done, not entirely understood. Now I want to make it a bit more formal. So what's a metrically rigid set? So if you have, if M is a remaining manifold subset x of m usually countable, but does not have to be isometrically rigid. If for any other remaining manifold, M Tilde, of the same dimension, it's very important if you know the following. Whenever x embeds in M tilde.
00:35:02.814 - 00:35:06.806, Speaker B: This determines the manifold m tilde.
00:35:06.910 - 00:35:41.850, Speaker C: This implies that m tilde is isometric to m. Okay, so you have your money from m. Think about two reals or some very specific thing. Say, ok, you want subset of r two. So that if you embed them anywhere of the same dimension, then that anywhere has to be the place where it came from. So x really encodes the entire geometry of the manifold where it lies. So for instance, okay, what we just said, yeah, I'm just repeating myself 20 times.
00:35:41.882 - 00:35:42.694, Speaker B: But, okay.
00:35:45.034 - 00:35:48.094, Speaker C: So what we said is that nets are metal, carry rigid.
00:35:50.394 - 00:35:50.786, Speaker B: Okay.
00:35:50.810 - 00:35:59.224, Speaker C: So nets in r two, but also, you know, okay, also other things automatically you did. But also, I don't know if you have a Poisson process, it's still okay.
00:36:02.924 - 00:36:03.664, Speaker B: Also.
00:36:05.524 - 00:36:59.734, Speaker C: Poisson processing probability one. So there is something we call quasinet, which is enough. Okay, and two questions is first question, do we have metric rigidity for netting Hadamard manifolds? So this we don't know in general, we don't have a counter example actually for Hadamard Manifold. So Hadamard manifold means simply connected non positive curvature. If you have a Hadamard manifold, they don't know a single example of a net which is not ready. And second question, just because this is the semester on romanian and lorentzian geometry, so I can ask about lorentzian. So I mean, I know very little about lorenzian manifold.
00:36:59.734 - 00:37:14.364, Speaker C: So what would the question is it true that what subsets of Minkowski spacetime?
00:37:15.384 - 00:37:15.672, Speaker B: What?
00:37:15.688 - 00:38:33.744, Speaker C: Discrete, let me emphasize discrete subsets. Israel. Okay, although discrete subsets of Minkowski spacetime, of Minkowski spacetime that are Lorenz distance or proper time rigid. So that is if you have maybe, I'm not sure, I don't know what's next, but okay, so inkowski spacetime, or in any lorentzian manifold you have a notion of Lorenz distance. It may be infinity maintains, but sometimes it's finite. And still you can look at this definition just now, instead of m being romanian, just instead of m being lorentzian. Is it true that you can detect the geometry of curved space time by having some discrete set of spaceships and knowing the proper time between them? And maybe this determines space time.
00:38:33.744 - 00:39:00.224, Speaker C: I don't know. After you're done with copy space time, you can look at the Schwarzschild solution or the ker solution, or other more examples. So you really know nothing about question two? Absolutely nothing. Okay, now I want to tell you about some history questions. Okay, some history. I don't think so. So, before we talk.
00:39:00.224 - 00:39:21.654, Speaker C: So let me. I mean, really, if it wasn't. If the word Laurentian would not appear in the title of this semester, I would not say about this. So, no, I apologize. I don't know enough about. Also, everything is in reverse, right? Yeah, maybe it does not make sense. And the net, you know, if you have.
00:39:21.654 - 00:39:35.036, Speaker C: I don't know really. This is came to the discrete?
00:39:35.140 - 00:39:36.572, Speaker B: Yes, basically.
00:39:36.668 - 00:39:38.372, Speaker D: Although they wouldn't have called it that.
00:39:38.468 - 00:39:41.024, Speaker C: But basically they wouldn't have.
00:39:43.764 - 00:39:44.980, Speaker B: Causal relations.
00:39:45.132 - 00:39:52.594, Speaker C: Okay. Future, past. Yeah. It really determines mass. Determining whether there is a black hole and stuff like that.
00:39:52.764 - 00:39:54.074, Speaker B: That's going too far.
00:39:54.454 - 00:40:05.206, Speaker C: I'm not up on what they do, but I know them and I know of them. Please connect. I mean, please tell me later. Okay. Sounds really exciting. Yes. Yeah, I'm okay.
00:40:05.206 - 00:40:10.670, Speaker C: I know very little. I mean, I took hundred class some years ago, but in a relativity. But other than that I don't.
00:40:10.782 - 00:40:11.874, Speaker B: Not an expert.
00:40:12.854 - 00:40:17.726, Speaker C: Good. Interesting. Okay, yeah. History, right. I mean. Okay. Metric adjutant is.
00:40:17.726 - 00:40:18.110, Speaker C: Okay.
00:40:18.142 - 00:40:18.688, Speaker B: So.
00:40:18.846 - 00:41:04.350, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'm not going to survey all results in mathematics or in geometry. Let me discuss what I think is somehow development, which is relevant for us. And I think that some history of this geometric relativity of mania. And so at least. So the first note I want to mention is from 1948 by Hopf, which is a beautiful paper, very short. So Hoff proved. Prove actually more than what I would say, but.
00:41:04.350 - 00:41:50.824, Speaker C: Okay, prove that if you have any romanian metric on the toes, without conjugate points. I'll explain if you don't. Without conjugate points is flat. Okay, so kind of historically, the condition that appeared usually was about what are conjugate points? These are critical values of the exponential map. You say that two points, p and q are conjugate. If you look at the geotesic between them. In a complete manifold, you have geodesics.
00:41:50.824 - 00:42:26.020, Speaker C: And if you vary, let's say the direction of the geodesic to first order here, then the change here is the second order, it's the higher order. So this basically, if you change direction of the geodesic goes, it basically nearly does not move in Q. For instance, on the sphere, antipodal points are conjugate points. Because if you look at this geodesic and you now shoot it in a somewhat different direction, you land it at exactly the same point. Okay, so these are conjugate points. And formally it's critical values of the exponential map. And hope proves that.
00:42:26.020 - 00:42:51.148, Speaker C: Yeah. If you don't have these conjugate points, if your metric, I would not say it as unique. Okay, then it has to be flat. So it's not just unique matrix are many flat metrics. On the torus, it's not, you know, you can take any lattice, gives you a different, it's not isometric to square torus, but still it is flat. And it was conjecture. It's true in any dimensions.
00:42:51.148 - 00:43:42.764, Speaker C: It was broke by Boozman. Important on that. It was solved a bit later. A bit means not a bit, some years later by Brago Niven, and they show that it's two in any dimension. Okay, so also on PNJ, points is flat. Now, I want to tell you about Michel's conjecture from the eighties. So, the bovivanief pouf is some ergodic tear, and it is kind of very much tailored to the case of the, of the towers, while helping to do the technique, which was useful also in other cases.
00:43:42.764 - 00:44:52.274, Speaker C: And also in some cases, I'm going to mention now Michel's conjecture from ap one. This time we discuss remaining manifolds, smooth minor manifolds with boundary. So, any simple, I'll explain what simple means in a second. Any simple, minimally following the boundary is determined from boundary distances. Okay, so what's simple? Simple is a good important word here. So simple. So we have some remaining manifold with boundary, okay, so the manifold is m and it has a boundary.
00:44:52.274 - 00:44:57.846, Speaker C: And the meaning of the word simple is that if you have two points.
00:44:58.030 - 00:45:01.246, Speaker B: On the boundary x and y, two.
00:45:01.270 - 00:46:13.684, Speaker C: Points on the boundary, then there is a unique geodesic minimizing geodesic connecting them. And it is entirely in the interior of the boundary, sorry, of the manifold m, except for the two endpoints. That simple. Okay, so for instance, if you have strongly convex domains in rn, these are simple, okay, so strike is fine, three convex domains in rm. And the conjecture says that if you know the distances between all points in the boundary. So this collection of data, this determines m. So any two manifolds with the same boundary distances are isometric to each other.
00:46:13.684 - 00:46:51.724, Speaker C: Okay, so this is Michel's conjecture form 81. Any questions or anything about it? Okay, so it's two in some cases. So it was early. I mean, in the pressing years ago, it was proven for strong convex domains in constant curvature. In rn or hn or hemisphere. Pesto van Ullman. Impressive work.
00:46:51.724 - 00:47:21.364, Speaker C: This was o two. This shows that it's two and two dimensions. Okay. It's still not known in dimension three. Let me also mention another relative result. So this will not stay. We cannot move it up.
00:47:21.364 - 00:47:44.634, Speaker C: So I should. Is that the minimum? Can you see above that point? Or even. Okay. Bangert and Emmerich, I hope. I pronounce the german name. I hope in Emerick. In 13, they prove the following results, which utilizes the Hobbs technique.
00:47:44.634 - 00:48:16.334, Speaker C: So suppose that m. Okay, first of all, you know it's deformific to r two. Second, you know that it has no conjugate points. Then let's pick some point xm. Then, if you look at the area of a disk of radius r.
00:48:18.064 - 00:48:18.592, Speaker B: Around.
00:48:18.688 - 00:48:41.616, Speaker C: X, if it has no conjugate points, kind of feels like negative curvature. So you kind of assume it should be more. The volume should be more than what you get in the flat case. This indeed correct. But it's correct in a rather strong sense. So the disk is at least one. I have to put the PI there.
00:48:41.616 - 00:49:11.424, Speaker C: At least PI with equality. If and only if you're flat. M is flatter, too. The given plane. Okay, now, I think that I have eleven more minutes until three. I write.
00:49:11.844 - 00:49:12.676, Speaker B: Christian, how much?
00:49:12.740 - 00:49:15.104, Speaker C: What's the. Yeah. Yes.
00:49:15.484 - 00:49:15.988, Speaker B: And.
00:49:16.076 - 00:49:16.860, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:17.052 - 00:49:20.144, Speaker A: Nine minutes. Nine or five?
00:49:21.044 - 00:49:39.044, Speaker C: Five. Okay. Okay. So now I want to tell you a few things about if there are no question. I want to know a few things about the proofs of our theorems. Other questions, the proofs. So we want to make contact.
00:49:39.044 - 00:49:59.884, Speaker C: Okay, so plan of proof. We want to make contact with this body of research about the case where you have no conjugate points. Can you ask? 2013? It's a recent one. Relatively.
00:50:01.804 - 00:50:02.584, Speaker B: Yes.
00:50:03.084 - 00:50:09.260, Speaker C: And that's 2002. But 81 is 1981.
00:50:09.372 - 00:50:10.104, Speaker B: Okay.
00:50:17.244 - 00:50:22.664, Speaker C: Okay. From 1980s. Okay.
00:50:25.204 - 00:50:26.064, Speaker B: Okay.
00:50:28.184 - 00:50:33.324, Speaker C: Right. So our powerpoop is. Okay. So, first of all, use the embedding.
00:50:34.384 - 00:50:35.096, Speaker B: Okay.
00:50:35.200 - 00:51:17.428, Speaker C: Embedding x in M ensures that there are no conjugate points. And, well, once you know there's no conjugate points, then you can use large scale geometry. Right. You have a net. So if you know that the natural gradient is from large scale, it really looks like flat r two. And you could hope to get bounds on, say, area of disks. And, yeah, you can do that and conclude that using this non conjugate pointing.
00:51:17.428 - 00:51:54.488, Speaker C: You include that conclude that it's flat. Okay, so that's, that's the general plan. Let me tell you a few words about part of how to show that there are no conjugate points. But at the beginning of the proof, and the paper is an archive in case you want to learn more. So we have this hit set x, okay, which is. Okay, it's both in our n. Let's.
00:51:54.488 - 00:52:22.724, Speaker C: Okay, let's do it in rn because I will not reach the point for you. It's r n in the m. Okay, so it's a subset of rn which is embedded in m. Okay, and let's fix some point p in this. In this x. Okay, and let's take, consider some sequence of points p m, okay, because I mistaken pm in x, which tends to infinity. Okay, so that's the picture.
00:52:22.724 - 00:52:39.774, Speaker C: So you have p, that's pm, p one, p two, et cetera, p three, whatever. And I connect them by geodesics. So, in a complete manifold, there's at least one geodesic minimizing, connecting any two points. And now I take subsequence.
00:52:41.834 - 00:52:42.306, Speaker B: Of these.
00:52:42.330 - 00:53:35.384, Speaker C: Geodesics from p to p and p to two. And this converges to some ray for minimizing geodesic ray from p emanating from p. Okay, but of course, the destiny craze that you obtain depends on the sequence that this many sequences, you can take many, many of this. Now let me, let me give a definition. So we say that the sequence of points. So let v in s n minus one be fixed. And suppose that pm in x tends to infinity.
00:53:35.384 - 00:54:20.664, Speaker C: We say that pm is drifting in direction v. And we know it like this. If. Okay, if pm normalized to a unit vector tends to v, okay, so this point p and p, you want these things to tend to direction v, okay, and what you want to show that this minimizing jurassic way is determined by v. That's really the very, very first step in the proof.
00:54:22.884 - 00:54:23.276, Speaker B: Okay?
00:54:23.300 - 00:55:26.504, Speaker C: So if you have sequences going the same direction, they have the same geodesic way. And for that we will use one lipset functions. So we will use. Okay, we'll use one lipstick functions and some ideas from the theory of l one mass transport, which is probably the only connection to the next lecture today by chasmac. We also discussed okay, so if you have a one, if its function, then you know that the distance between two points is f of x minus f, at least f of x minus f of y. Okay, so this gives you lower bound on the distances. And these things are kind of dual to curves because curve gives you upper bounds.
00:55:26.504 - 00:56:27.256, Speaker C: So if you have a curve connecting x and y, then gives you an upper bound for gamma. And there is a developed theoretical function that I learned actually from the papers by Everton, gangbo and Feldman and Meccan in the romanian case, this is Euclidean. Here's Germania serious later. And the concept of transport ray. So it says that unit speed gamma gamma from a b to m, unit speed is a transport ray. If the function, if the one transport to ray of f, if f progressing, the maximum possible speed on gamma f of gamma of t minus f of gamma of s is just t minus s. It cannot be faster than that because it's one leapsheet.
00:56:27.256 - 00:56:33.244, Speaker C: But that's the critical thing. And one of the things that I love on this paper is that.
00:56:35.104 - 00:56:35.416, Speaker B: Is.
00:56:35.440 - 00:57:39.600, Speaker C: That if, you know, if you have two transport rays you set in an interior point, they have to coincide. And two transport rays that intersect an interior point overlap. It's more accurate to say, okay, so you cannot have a picture like this. So if this is a transport curve and that one is a transport curve, that's impossible because it's like an interior point of one of them, that's impossible. And you use this, this type of idea don't explain much. You can start some kind of boson function, some ideal boundary, and you show that if you have two sequences that drift direction v, that you have to coincide because of this fact that we have here. Okay, so I think I'm just 1 minute out of time.
00:57:39.600 - 00:57:46.554, Speaker C: So I think it's a good point to stop. And thank you for your attention, for the many questions. Thank you. Also, you can ask more. Okay.
00:57:51.334 - 00:57:56.414, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you very much for the nice talk. Are there any questions.
