00:03:32.122 - 00:04:05.434, Speaker A: Thank you. And second graduate student, Fuyun Gujari. Well, I don't see Tan Yi. I don't see Tian Yi online. Oh, yeah. Puyan Gujari is online. You're online.
00:04:05.434 - 00:04:11.998, Speaker A: Oh, okay, good. Right. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. All right. Okay.
00:04:11.998 - 00:04:51.074, Speaker A: I don't see. He's in Ottawa. Then dial in Lee. Never met him, but he's registered. All right, well, can I ask you, what's your name? I'm sorry? I have your email. Yes, hello. It's an urgent call.
00:04:51.074 - 00:05:13.730, Speaker A: Yes, I. Yes, yes, I would just like. I can confirm. I can confirm. I can confirm the appointment. Well, it's canceled. All right, well, I didn't get that.
00:05:13.730 - 00:05:53.234, Speaker A: All right, so it's canceled. Is there a new date anyway? I see. 1015 March. No, 1015 March 20. March 25 26th. Yeah. All right.
00:05:53.234 - 00:06:09.484, Speaker A: All right. Thank. Well, all right. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. You know, I'll never be able to get in touch with that office directly.
00:06:09.484 - 00:07:12.604, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, well, how many people have you can. You can look up? Um, Paul Helmoss wrote a number of books, including one of them, one of them being, I want to be a mathematician. And, um, he's considered to be, um, one of the best, um, posters of mathematics. Um, but he's also a leading figure in the theory of learning operators in Hilbert space. And I've quoted from him from time to time. One of his books is, well, introduction to Hilbert's day theory.
00:07:12.604 - 00:08:29.148, Speaker A: One of them is measure theory, called measure theory. One of them is called naive set theory, which is maybe worth looking at because it's just the opposite of something like Whitehead and Russell, which might have some difficulty with. And another of his books might have been naive category theory. Okay. And I've forgotten if it says, look, I just mentioned covers category theory, but it's different from set theory, for instance. There's no, well, your categories could be set, okay? But they don't have to be. And, and it's important to be able to work with the elementary concepts of category theory because it's just very helpful.
00:08:29.148 - 00:09:42.874, Speaker A: Very helpful. So what's the category? Well, what's the category of set? You just look at sets and then a category has objects that has arrows and the arrows go between the objects and you can compose them. And it's a social, that's a category. Well, you have, you have, every object has an identity map, which is an arrow, which you can compose it with itself and you get, you get, you get the same map back again and you compose it with them. So if you have a map between two points, an identity map on the main side of the arrow is compose it with this, recompose with this. The arrows can be composed with the, if the head of one tail of one begins at the head of the same object where the head of the other one begins. Okay, that's the category thereof.
00:09:42.874 - 00:10:38.490, Speaker A: The source and the range, okay, domain or the code domain. And, and the identity map on the range side is the composer with the arrow, an arrow going to this point. Then you get the same thing. That's a category. And if you have three arrows and any, the first two can be composed and the, and the last two can be composed, then the composition of the first two can be composed with the last one. And the composition of the last two can be composed of the first one. And you get the same answer.
00:10:38.490 - 00:11:35.614, Speaker A: That's associativity. An example is the category of sets where the objects are sets and the arrows are just set maps and. Well, then this electronic age, I'm going to have to start bringing salt. Well, I did bring some thought pieces off my emergency talk. Don't know if it's actually. Things will come down to an emergency yet. Okay, so, and I'll go with the category of vector spaces.
00:11:35.614 - 00:12:17.964, Speaker A: And there's a, is the category of cardinal numbers. Natural numbers are more generally cardinal number. And they what, you have to have two cardinal numbers and n prime. So what is an arrow going between? There's always an arrow going in at least one direction. Okay. And the arrow just says n is less than or equal to n prime. Okay.
00:12:17.964 - 00:13:19.924, Speaker A: And that makes the natural numbers of the category. And so if you have arrows in both directions, that means each one is less than or equal to the other. And, and by the, depending on how you define cardinal numbers, that implies that either by definition or it implies by the canter Bernstein theorem that they're equal. And that's equal, equals is isomorphic in the category. So what, what is isomorphism in the category? Well, you have maps, you do have maps going in both directions between two arrows. It's going forwards and backwards with those arrows gives you the identity map on the first object, and going backwards and forwards gives you the identity map on the second object. And that's called an isomorphism.
00:13:19.924 - 00:14:22.098, Speaker A: Each of these maps is called an isomorphism, and other one is called the inverse of the first one. Okay, now just natural numbers. This is cardinal number, and if you have vector spaces, a category of vector spaces, linear map. And this, there's a, what's called a function going from vector spaces to cardinal numbers. Okay? That's the dimension. And what, and what does it mean that, that's the, oh, vector spaces. With, with injective maps.
00:14:22.098 - 00:16:05.594, Speaker A: Okay, injective linear maps. Then if you have a map, objective map between two vector spaces, the question what's the function, Abigail, but have a vector space and what's the cardinal number? Sorry? Yeah, the dimension. Yes, so, um, so, um, um, vector space, vector space goes to the dimension, and in the end, so the first part of it being a function is just objects go to objects, and that's fine. But then maps have to go to maps because of injective map between two vector spaces. Oh, I'm sorry, this is a narrow, this is not a narrow insider category. It's a, it's a, it's just a function can be considered as a mapping, a correspondence from one, which if the categories are set, then it's just a function. Spaces to parallel numbers, and the vector space goes to the dimension.
00:16:05.594 - 00:18:29.284, Speaker A: And if you have two vector spaces of v one and v two, and the dimension of v one, the dimension of v two, if you have an injection from v one to v two, then you're going to get a map here, right, elon, do you agree? Because if there's an injection, then the dimension of some of the range vector space, the range we call the main vector space, will be greater than or equal to the dimension of the first vector space. So, but now if you have some, if you have natural numbers, I won't try to extend this to cardinal numbers and then another way to make them into the category, a map between two natural numbers. Does anyone want to make a suggestion? Two non zero natural numbers. So in the case of cardinal numbers, what we, any two cardinal numbers have at least one arrow between them and at most, two, one in each direction. But with natural numbers, non zero natural numbers, that means. That means dividing. Makes sense, right? And I guess.
00:18:29.284 - 00:19:07.336, Speaker A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Wait, sorry. Well, okay, but don't forget, less than, less than, or equal to is not an equivalent relation. It's a. It's what's called an order relation. Right. Well, they're closely related, but they're different.
00:19:07.336 - 00:19:33.682, Speaker A: In fact, each one has three axioms, equivalence relation and order relation. This is kind of fun. The first axiom is exactly the same in each case. It's called reflexivity. It's related to itself. Each element is related to itself. And then the second axiom is transitivity that says if you go from x to y and from y to z, then you go from x.
00:19:33.682 - 00:20:14.516, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I must ask people to. Even though people are not wearing masks, most people are not wearing masks. I'd like to really ask people to speak up because there's a lot of ventilation. It's, again, partly because of the last few years. Yes, but you're not saying anything. Well, that's exactly what I had in my mind.
00:20:14.516 - 00:20:44.960, Speaker A: Right. Okay. And this is now we're getting into the sea star algebra theory, a category of natural numbers which is very closely related to Wim's UHF algorithm. It's very closely related to the. Well, it's. What's most related to is the finite dimensional UHF algebra is just ordinary matrix algorithms. And if you.
00:20:44.960 - 00:21:45.174, Speaker A: So we've more or less agreed that if you have two matrix algebras and the order of one divides the order of, of the other, then one of them maps into the other. If and only if maps unitly, in a way preserving the unit, if and only if the orders divide. Right? So that, that means there's going to be, just as there was a function from vector spaces to cardinal numbers, there's going to be n one. Just as there was a filter from cardinal numbers, for instance, natural numbers, into. Sorry. From vector spaces, for instance, finitely generated vector spaces into cardinal numbers. There's a, there's a function from.
00:21:45.174 - 00:22:49.784, Speaker A: From matrix algebra. Look at the category of matrix algebra with the unit on math. Okay. And the thing over a fixed field over the complex numbers. Okay. And there's a function from here into natural numbers, okay? Because if m maps unitly into mn prime, this implies that n divides n primes, if an only. All right, so what's the next step? Why, if I were to let the cat out of the bag.
00:22:49.784 - 00:24:04.844, Speaker A: Okay, so matrix natural numbers and matrix algebra. Well, I guess the next step will be super matrix algebra and which was what the Gwynn could have called the, uh, algebra and the supernatural numbers. Dixmae did, Dixme did talk about generalized integers and then that morphed into supernatural numbers. And Dixmey talked about metroid algebra. Okay, those were the ones that, he's got the word matrix there. Okay, so we have like glim of UHF algebra mapping to supernatural numbers. We have to be a little careful.
00:24:04.844 - 00:25:24.224, Speaker A: The matrix algebra is going to the natural number. How do we, when we define the natural number of how much of the matrix algebra are we looking at? Are we just looking at its structure as an algebra or are we, are we assuming, are we assuming that it's an mn? Okay, that's the, well, in fact, you can define the n in terms of the algebra. Okay, how do we do that? A number of people have been contributing to that discussion. Clarissa, do you remember caricature? Do you remember of how you get from the algebra to the number without assuming that it's starting, without assuming that it's constructed from a number? If you just talk about mn, that's constructed from the number n. Right? Suppose you just, you're given some algebra and you're told it might be an mn. Then how do you tell which n it would be? Yeah, yeah. You look at the linear dimension, then you take the square roots.
00:25:24.224 - 00:26:31.694, Speaker A: Okay, so that's, so we have a true functor for matrix algebras to natural numbers that has this property. And by the way, once we know that, then that sort of tells us that if the algebra is isomorphic, if the, well, it's, it says that if they're isomorphic, then the n is equal to the n prime. Okay. It can't be isomorphic because n is not equal to n prime because. Yeah, well, we were talking about unital maps, though, right? You can map m two into, if you want, you can map it into the upper left hand corner to upper left hand two by two, corner of three by three matrices. But that's getting a little more. That's moving ahead a little.
00:26:31.694 - 00:27:07.506, Speaker A: We'll look at that too. But I think it's important to the UHF case from the point of view of categories. It's not only naive category theory, but it's, um, it's barely noticeable. Okay. It's going to be very straightforward. Okay. But we had one, had to work a bit.
00:27:07.506 - 00:27:53.126, Speaker A: We had to work a bit to prove that there was a function from matrix algebra to natural numbers that took mn into n, didn't depend on knowing the n ahead of time. Okay, well, it's the same thing here, but grim. Uhf algebra. And that means by construction, by definition, it is an mn. For what Dix may noted wrote as nn. He took the notation m, sub n, where n is a supernatural number. Okay? And then he showed that if you have the mn just as an algebra, then you can, you can reconstruct the.
00:27:53.126 - 00:28:22.046, Speaker A: Nice. Okay, just like for matrix algebra, you're given an algebra and it might be an mn. Well, then the n is unique and you get the function. And it's the same for glim, uhf algebra. You know, every one of them comes from some. From some n, but a priori, you don't know it's unique. You don't know the end is unique.
00:28:22.046 - 00:29:00.954, Speaker A: But if you prove that the n is unique, then you have the function. Okay? Because it was also true. You can also show that if you have mn mapping into mn prime in a unitful way, then this implies that n divides n prime. Is it clear what it means for. For one supernatural number to divide another? You just take. You just take what it means for natural numbers in terms of the prime decomposition. Right? This means that for each prime number, there's our.
00:29:00.954 - 00:29:33.460, Speaker A: The one that divides the other one has fewer at most that number of prime, prime numbers in this factorization. And that's exactly. That makes that you say exactly the same thing for supernatural numbers. You just look at the. The power of each prime number in it. If that gets larger than you say, divides them, the smaller power divides the larger power, even if it's infinite or even if there are infinitely many primes. We're talking about one.
00:29:33.460 - 00:30:09.294, Speaker A: Or one. Okay, so we have to. Well, so actually, Glenn's classification theorem about just drew in the existence of the functor from. From the category of UHF algebras with unital math. Okay, and. And, um, I should say that equipped. Okay, so.
00:30:09.294 - 00:31:07.696, Speaker A: And how does one, conversely, if you know there is a functor, then. Then you know there is a function from algebra to supernatural numbers. But take them n to n, then you have the classification. You have the classification. You know that if, if the thing isn't mn, then n is unique. Until function of this. Okay, you just have to check that.
00:31:07.696 - 00:32:14.244, Speaker A: If the n, if n one does divide n two, then probably that happens. If. No, you mn divide and n prime. Well, and at more elementary level, we can just talk about the. Well, what dictates me digs me translation of Wim's very rather deeper calculations was just to do some number theory. Okay, and you, and you can talk about. So you can talk about the category of some supernatural numbers on the one hand.
00:32:14.244 - 00:32:52.484, Speaker A: And on the other hand, you can talk about the subgroups of the rational numbers, okay, containing. Containing the integers. And here you would hear them maps. This is a category with inclusion, a lot like the simple arrows over here. For cardinal numbers, you take less than or equal to. And for natural numbers, non zero natural numbers, you take the visibility. Dividing the ratio of one, dividing the other.
00:32:52.484 - 00:33:43.594, Speaker A: For sets, makes sense to talk about inclusion. Of course, these are added to groups and inclusion will be thought of as a group homomorphism as well. Special group of malorphic preserves, the. Okay, so this is a category. Supernatural numbers are a category. Well, in fact, these two categories are equivalent. What does equivalent mean? Well, it has a more complicated meaning, but the more down to earth more special meaning is that the two categories are, in a strong sense, exactly the same.
00:33:43.594 - 00:34:25.094, Speaker A: Okay? In fact, they're both sets. Supernatural numbers are a set and the collection of subgroups of two that forms a set. So we can talk about. We can just say they're isomorphic. There's a map between this set and this set, which is map between the arrows here and the arrow is here. And the structure being the category of objects on the map between the arrows. Sorry.
00:34:25.094 - 00:34:46.244, Speaker A: The structure being the objects and the arrows between. Okay, that's exactly isomorphic. It's the same thing. Okay, and this is supposed to be something that's not complete news or not completely news. Okay. Something that we supposed to have. Supposed to have touched on already.
00:34:46.244 - 00:35:25.266, Speaker A: Does that ring a bell? Can anyone comment on that? So, Jared, you're saying you can't even comment on it, huh? That's mutually. Well, that's a comment. Thank you. But. Well, this reminds me of. This is almost like it's kind of a legend about Khan. Maybe he's not the only one.
00:35:25.266 - 00:36:17.556, Speaker A: But you ask him to explain something, he'll give you a very clear explanation. But if you would like him to explain it a bit more, a bit more detail, he will give you a completely different explanation. And so you might not even recognize that it's explaining the same thing, right? Afraid that's what we might be bringing now. All right, but. Yes, but. Okay, just start again from the beginning. Thank you.
00:36:17.556 - 00:36:52.886, Speaker A: But. Well, that's the question. Okay, this is an exercise. Does there exist. Does there exist a map from m two to m three? Of course. In algebra, map preserving, linear preserving product and taking one into one. But we're talking about one into one, right? They can be preserving the identity that's a good question, because it's later.
00:36:52.886 - 00:37:16.434, Speaker A: Before too long, we'll look at more general maps, too. Okay. And we'll have to. And the category approach will come into its own. So it's not. It could be in the present setting, it could be avoided just by saying that everything that you see is the same, more or less. Right.
00:37:16.434 - 00:37:39.822, Speaker A: That the, these, the supernatural numbers are the same as subgroups of Q. Does that. Does that ring a bell at all? Jared, do you remember. Now you're nodding. Okay, do you remember some correspondence between subgroups of q and supernatural numbers? How many does anyone. I see some heads. Naughty.
00:37:39.822 - 00:38:11.746, Speaker A: Yes, Justin. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now this. Someone, some people might say that for n, a supernatural number, one over n is nonsense. Okay, but if it's one over n times z, then this sum can be given a meaning. Justin, can you say what it is? Well, I'm sure you can say what it is. Okay, but can everyone, can everyone say what the one over n, for instance, one over n times z.
00:38:11.746 - 00:38:31.664, Speaker A: Okay, that contains z. If you look at how this is defined, where n is a supernatural number, okay. Including an ordinary. If it's an ordinary natural number, non zero, no problem. Right. Okay. The point of supernatural is that they behave almost the same.
00:38:31.664 - 00:38:43.940, Speaker A: Okay. You can't. It's not. Adding is not so much in the works. Okay. But you can modify them and divide just almost as well as with. Essentially.
00:38:43.940 - 00:38:58.844, Speaker A: As well as with ordinary nonzero. Well, yeah. Right. But this is the only example. That's it. Okay. And this is.
00:38:58.844 - 00:39:21.434, Speaker A: I'm going to keep track how many times I have to assign this as an exercise. Right? I mean, that's. That's why I don't, I don't know if computers are ever going to catch on, I think paper. You have a blank t sheet of paper. You've got to write something on it. So if someone says anything, it looks like exercise. You write it down.
00:39:21.434 - 00:40:17.434, Speaker A: Whereas if it's a computer, well, I'll be busy doing some calculation, making money for something. Okay, so that's. And the end. The n is a supernatural number. And this is bijective correspondence, okay? Between these, this group, however it's defined, and the n, the n is an arbitrary supernatural number. That means a collection of exponents, a way of associating an exponent to arbitrary prime number. It's a function from prime numbers to natural numbers, including zero and also including infinity.
00:40:17.434 - 00:41:17.944, Speaker A: Keep track of prime powers. And that's your. That's all you need to know. That's all you need to know about a natural number, you only need to know the exponents of all the prime factors, right? And then now addition is a little, they have to work, have to work a bit to do addition on that. But multiplication is very simple, right? That turns out to be addition on the sequences of victor. Okay, well, so what I'm hoping is that some people might decide to turn this into a glorious essay, the whole thing, put it all together. And which is, I mean, one of the things I'm hoping people will catch on to is the idea of writing an essay.
00:41:17.944 - 00:43:17.192, Speaker A: And this is as good a topic as any good topic, a good essay topic. What is, how much of the situation is just formulating things and how much is proving things, how much has to be approved once you formulated things? I think sometimes the things are cluttered by a great deal of technical, technical calculation work. Okay. And in that case, it's a little harder to ask people to straighten everything out themselves. Okay? But in the present setting, in the present setting it's um, I think it's realistic to, um, to ask for an essay, on the one hand, talking about the, the, um, exact, exact correspondence which can be thought of as isomorphism of categories between supernatural numbers with arrows being positioned relation, and the subgroups of q containing the number one, which, where the arrows are inclusion occlusion. And so what's an isomorphism? Doc, you're done. Yes, okay, but what is an isomorphism between two objects in this category subgroup? In general, if you just say two groups, isomorphism is isomorphism, right? I mean, it's having a map between them that preserves the operation, both directions and bijective.
00:43:17.192 - 00:44:07.774, Speaker A: That's it. That's an isomorphism between groups, you only have to say, preserves the operation in one direction. That's what happens. Don't worry about that. Okay, but in this case, isomorphism of two of these objects, especially, they're special groups, right? There's subgroup of q on the one hand, and they're assumed to contain z. And, and furthermore, okay, I guess I should have said that all the isomorphisms are inclusions, right? Well, actually you don't. If it's any bunch of subsets of a set and you consider them as a category where the maps are inclusion, arrows are inclusions, then you can say what an isomorphism is, right? It says the first object is contained in the second, the second object is contained in the first.
00:44:07.774 - 00:44:46.182, Speaker A: This is set through any conclusion, right? So what's the upshot of that? Well, I guess if two sets are going, if they're ever going to be equal and they're equal. And that's true, right? Each one is a subset of the other. That's what an isomorphism is. In this category, isomorphism is just equality. And furthermore, that's what it is here. If you have two supernatural numbers and each one divides the other. And the fact, that's what it is for the cardinal numbers, too, each one in a sort of a relationship.
00:44:46.182 - 00:45:49.724, Speaker A: The, if you look at the exponents, and it's the cardinal numbers of the exponents you're looking at. But anyway, if you have two supernatural numbers, if one, if there's an arrow in both directions between two supernatural numbers, then there's an arrow going forwards and backwards, and only one arrow from something into itself, namely the identity. So anyway, what's the upshot of it for the two supernatural numbers, even if there's an arrow going in both directions? Forget about being a nice Marcus Carissa. That's the two supernatural numbers, n and n prime. You have a map in one direction and then a map in the other direction. So what does that say? Yeah. Yeah, because this one says that the first one says one divides the other, and the second one says the other divides the first.
00:45:49.724 - 00:50:06.268, Speaker A: In terms of the exponent, that's done well. In general, there are. And between groups, there are non trivialized marxism, but in this case, it, it. And even when you can see. But point is that injecting by talking about isomorphism opposed to equality of sense. Okay, these. One over n one z, when you look at the mn sensor k, you can get that group, but you can't get it the way the z, you get it up twice more than you get the group k zero.
00:50:06.268 - 00:50:58.084, Speaker A: Okay, k zero is a functor. Look at this algebra. It's isomorphic to this. If you're looking at Mn tensor k, then the k zero group is isomorphic to this, but not in any canonical way, because you don't have the class of the unit, you don't know what the unit was. So the non trivial reasons for talking about the category theory in the trivial case, where everything is equal, is that in the call destabilized case, m n ten to the k. What's important, you have them n and n prime. You look at the two groups, one over n times z, one over n prime times z.
00:50:58.084 - 00:51:16.292, Speaker A: Then the algebra is isomorphic. Both are isomorphic. Then it's if and only if the groups are not equal. The equals make sense. Okay, but they don't have to be equal. They just have to be isomorphic. Jack, you.
00:51:16.292 - 00:51:53.844, Speaker A: You put your finger on essentially phrase. Okay? And I'll have to repeat it next time. That the benefit of people online or including me. Any questions? And we can meet in the front of the room or outside. And I highly recommend the Friday afternoon office hours of Mister Powell.
