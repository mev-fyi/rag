00:00:00.440 - 00:00:45.002, Speaker A: Good afternoon. How many people. How many people have located the chinese antecedent to Pascal? There's something called, I guess, everyone who studied in North America or Europe. Well, it might be more widely known. Everyone, essentially everyone knows what Pascal's triangle is, right? Pascal's triangle is. It starts off. Well, every journey starts with a thousand.
00:00:45.002 - 00:01:08.724, Speaker A: Every journey starts with a single step, whether it's a thousand steps or. Okay, but the. With Pascal's triangle, you have. You start with a single point, and then what? She comes. What's the second stage? Yeah, okay, don't tell me the whole story. That's. Just.
00:01:08.724 - 00:01:24.432, Speaker A: Tell me what's next. So you have a single point and then what? Or 2.2. Oh, okay, two points. And then. And then you can. Well, of course, you connect. Every point gets connected to the two points on either side of it.
00:01:24.432 - 00:02:02.394, Speaker A: Below you, sort of. The rows are skewed. So just like the seats in an auditorium, if you are moving seats. So these seats maybe are not like that. They're just lined up in a straight line. But if you have movable seats that you put in place and then put them away afterwards, I think it's common to have the two adjacent rows. The seats are staggered so that you have to go two rows before you get another chair in the same place.
00:02:02.394 - 00:02:33.864, Speaker A: Otherwise it's halfway in between. And I guess this makes it easier to see if it's. Especially if it's flat. Flat. The core is flat. I know this because when I grew up, the floor was flat. I'm not saying the earth was flat, but by the way, anyone can tell the earth is flat.
00:02:33.864 - 00:02:49.282, Speaker A: You stand on a hill, I think you can see. Not just things if you're looking over the water. Not things. Not just things disappearing in the distance. But you can. I imagine that you can see the. You can see something round.
00:02:49.282 - 00:03:12.636, Speaker A: You can see some roundness. Anyone ever noticed that or agree with me? Of course, my imagination might be running away with me sometimes, but. Okay, but. And then what's the. Are you. No, you. What is your name? Please? Remind me of your name.
00:03:12.636 - 00:03:42.928, Speaker A: Vincent. Okay, good. I got it out first, right? Almost like almost too late, almost too slow. Okay, but that happens to me quite often. Almost too slow. Either that or too slow. Okay, but so what's the next role? Remember the flat auditorium? Remember the flat floor? Okay, so, well, are you.
00:03:42.928 - 00:04:40.812, Speaker A: Are you familiar with what's called Pascal's triangle? Okay, we have one point, and then usually below that, you have two points that's sort of symmetrical, all right? But then at the third row three for three for three points in the third row. Right. And furthermore, it's symmetric, which means staggered with respect to the second row and lined up exactly with respect to the first row. And. Okay, but I know for a fact that this was discovered several hundred years ago in France, but. But I believe several hundred years before that in China. I guess I would say it's a, it's an interesting historical exercise.
00:04:40.812 - 00:05:16.144, Speaker A: Just look up Pascal's triangle. Chinese with a question mark. You don't need the question mark. I used to be very slow looking things up, but now it's kind of a hobby using keywords and, well, so slow. But it's fun to choose to try to think of efficient keywords or even keywords that work at all. Sometimes you have quite a lot of ways using keywords. Something up.
00:05:16.144 - 00:06:04.802, Speaker A: Be interesting to see what the chinese context was, I think Pascal's context of probability. It'd be nice to see how it goes, but it's quite fundamental in Siesta algebra theory, the example of Pascal's triangle and how this leads in a natural way to a, to a sister algebra. And since the. It's a sister algebra, then it leads in a natural way to a group. Right. The k zero group. And it's an interesting question what both.
00:06:04.802 - 00:06:39.934, Speaker A: What the sister algebra is and what the group is. A million group. It's an order group. The order group means you have different. Two elements might be comparable. One of them might be less than or equal to the other. If you say which elements are positive or greater than or equal to zero, then that tells you, in general, since you assume the order is translation invariant, tells you when two elements are comparable, because you can always subtract to make one of them zero.
00:06:39.934 - 00:07:38.644, Speaker A: And that's supposed to have the same comparability of relation, then. Okay, so I'm just sort of, I'm just sort of drawing to your attention that this is a important example to study and to think of how you get the. How you get the. How the, I mean, the diagram is quite schematic, right? So you have to decide how it actually gives rise to the sister algebra or an ordered group. So what's the legend? What's the key? Well, if you have a single point, I was already, last time I was using a single point to denote a full matrix algebra. Right. A single full matrix algebra.
00:07:38.644 - 00:08:45.652, Speaker A: It was a schematic representation of the algebra unspecified size. You put a number beside the point, and that would tell you what the order or size of the matrix algebra was. I mean, that would be one way of keeping track of it. And, okay, and so, and if you have two points in one row, so one row is supposed to be a whole algebra. And, and if it's single point, it's a single full matrix algebra. If it's two points, then it's the direct sum of two full matrix algebra. And how do you tell what the size is? What's the legend or the key? How you read this as a map? Well, I guess a point should be non zero matrix algebra.
00:08:45.652 - 00:09:31.796, Speaker A: If you don't specify, don't specify. Maybe it's one by one. Maybe it's one by one matrix. And then, so you start with a single point that could be the algebra of complex numbers. And then if you have two points at the next stage, let's make it symmetry. Okay, and it's difficult to line up to join the points, okay, not all. Well, in this case, all the points between the two different rows, all the pairs of points.
00:09:31.796 - 00:10:34.064, Speaker A: And, and if you draw the single line in the Bradley diagram, that's supposed to have matrix algebra, two matrix algebras at the next stage. But if you have a single line, that means that the map from the first algebra, the first full matrix algebra into the second one is just model physically one. Okay, and what does model 51 mean? It means that if the first algebra is the complex number and it's a unital map, then the second algebra is also the complex number and it's an isomorphism. Okay, so the second algebra is the direct sum of two copies of the complex number. Excellency, I'm going to run out of space. I hope I stay on the camera. Okay.
00:10:34.064 - 00:11:02.426, Speaker A: All right. And then the vincent was saying, chicam was saying two points at the second stage. Vincent was saying three points at the third stage. Notice we're not actually making a full triangle. So the triangle saying triangle is a bit of a, bit of a misnomer. You have to imagine the three points from the triangle. You always have three points, but what's important is the two sides of the triangle.
00:11:02.426 - 00:11:57.228, Speaker A: So every point maps it's joined to the two points on either side of it. Okay? And so if it's supposed to be a unital map, these are finite dimensional algebras, finite direct sums of matrix algebra. And so if it's monopolistic one, if this is the complex numbers, then the first one and the second one will both be copies of the complex numbers. But at the next stage, the first algebra, well, if it's unit only, the unit is the direct sum of the units at every stage. So the unit here will go down to the unit here as well, because nothing else is going into it. That's the only way that the unit in the whole first, in the whole second algebra can map into the unit of the whole third stage. We get a copy of the.
00:11:57.228 - 00:12:56.258, Speaker A: I'm going to have to continue. Over here we have c and then c plus c, and then on the outside we have c again and both ends. Okay, but then what do we have in the middle? There's a big space in the middle. What's the algebra in the middle? How many people? I don't mind someone who already knows answering, but I would prefer to see someone who doesn't know. I mean, I think that, for one thing, I think it's important to Charlie. Are you sure you don't know? Okay, I exactly like to see people guessing. Okay, I jump into the blue.
00:12:56.258 - 00:13:20.564, Speaker A: Of course. You should look before you leave. Right. Okay. Well, no, the convention is that every row is a direct sum, a full matrix algebra. Okay, so definitely the middle algebra is the direct sum of three matrix algebras. And the only question is how large they are.
00:13:20.564 - 00:14:31.144, Speaker A: Okay. And the point is that each of these one by one is mapping with monoplicity one into a two by two, but not unitly, because the one here and the one here, this mapping, I guess the direct whole algebra mapped into here, then if it's a homomorphism, these two projections, or these two units in this, these direct summons are orthogonal, product is zero. That's going to be true when you map the second algebra to the third algebra. The images of the two units in the two direct summons, second stage images are going to be orthogonal here. So what's, if you have two, what's an example of a matrix algebra where you have two projections that are orthogonal, non zero production. Okay, how many people don't know? That eliminates, that'll narrow the field a little, I hope. Okay, everyone knows.
00:14:31.144 - 00:15:00.746, Speaker A: Larry, what did you say? Well, that's, well, that, very good. That's 90%. Right. Because I didn't ask for the co domain, I just asked. I could have been asking for the image. Right. So you have this algebra mapping into this algebra and the.
00:15:00.746 - 00:15:23.522, Speaker A: Of course, it can't be, if it's commutatively homomorphic image of a commutative algebra is going to be commutative. Right. So image of this, if it's C squared or C plus C, image will be c plus c. But the, but this is supposed to be a full matrix algebra. So you've got to have a c plus C sitting in the full matrix algebra. So that's. You're missing 10%.
00:15:23.522 - 00:15:33.896, Speaker A: At least. At least 10%. Okay, but very good. Very good guess. Okay, I hope it was a guess. Sorry. Okay, good, good.
00:15:33.896 - 00:16:17.016, Speaker A: Yes. Charlie, you want to come back to it? Okay, now, you could say it was M 32. I mean, you're going to map C C plus C into M 32. Take 216 dimensional projections down the diagonal, right? But 16 ones and 16 zeros for one of them, and then 16 zeros and 16 ones for the other one. But the simplest one, and usually the simplest one, is the answer. Unless you're Sherlock Holmes. Okay, so Sherlock Holmes said you hold out to the end and you take the most difficult one that couldn't possibly have to eliminate all the other.
00:16:17.016 - 00:17:16.704, Speaker A: Of course, it'd be this simple ones. You try first and illuminate those. And at the end, I think the way it goes is it's a good, good maxim. What's left after you've eliminated the ones that are impossible, no matter how improbable. That must be the truth. Okay, so, all right, so we have m two, c, and by the way, does anyone recognize this? Does anyone recognize the sequence of ordered couplets of numbers? So one, and then 11121. What's the next one going to be? Without even drawing the drawing, the triangle diagram.
00:17:16.704 - 00:17:46.504, Speaker A: What's the next. What's it going to be, Larry? Well, that's just words. What's the answer for the next stage? I mean, you're telling me how to calculate it. I want to get the answer. I guess so. And then, and then I might ask you, how did you get it? You're spoiling my thunder. Yeah.
00:17:46.504 - 00:18:22.344, Speaker A: Okay, good. So we, we can just. I mean, so then here's an exercise that you do get the every stage, it has to be the binomial coefficients, right? That's. You wouldn't believe that was a sea strip. You might not believe it. For that matter, why is it a probability exercise? I'd like to see that. I'd like to see someone go over that.
00:18:22.344 - 00:19:01.820, Speaker A: Pascal was a famous. Oh, he's a general mathematician, too, I suppose, but. So I think he'd be best known as one of the founders of the theory of probability. Well, okay, so that's the algebra. Okay, now we could say, what about the group? What about the k zero group? But we know what k zero of a field is, right? So we know what the k zero group is for the first row. That's the field. For that matter.
00:19:01.820 - 00:19:33.444, Speaker A: We know it for the second row, too, because it direct sum of two algebra, sum of the two k zero groups. Do you agree with that, Teresa? K zero would be, would preserve direct sums of algebra. The k zero of the rec sum is the direct sum of the k zero in the sense of groups. Well, that's an exercise then if you don't agree immediately with it. But, but even, look, there's no easy way out. Even if you agree immediately with it, it's still an exercise. Okay.
00:19:33.444 - 00:20:21.544, Speaker A: Okay, so, and don't forget, the exercises you hand in are only the tip of the iceberg. Nine tenths of your homework is just done at home. I mean, and it doesn't necessarily see the light of day. That's how I understand how to study a subject. You can, one way to study is to read a book. But I think if you're going to read a book, you should start at the end and work backwards. That's what we're doing, right? Sort of.
00:20:21.544 - 00:21:29.204, Speaker A: The af algebra part is later on, I guess, and we're skipping in the meantime, we're skipping the bot periodicity so far, but we should keep going over that, keep reviewing. I mean, that's, that's one of the, of course it's related to the, closely related to the af algebra theory, even though, even though there's no k one for af algebra. Okay, but that's, it's important. It's already important that there isn't any k one for an AFL. But let me just mention the fundamental, the basic theorem for Af algebras. If you have an ideal, closed ideal, which is af, that means it comes from something like a pascal triangle. It's a whole bunch of funny dimensional algebras.
00:21:29.204 - 00:22:33.534, Speaker A: And these are, and they're schematically represented by the, the, these multiplicities. You had two, if you did have multiplicity two here you'd draw two lines. If it's a whole lot of multiplicity, is quite large, then you would just put a number beside the edge. By the way, taking complex numbers into 16 by 16 matrices, where you put the number 116 times down the diagonal, that would have multiplicity 16. Right? Okay, so these are, the ideal is af and the quotient is a, first of all, if a, if a big algebra were af, then the ideal would be af, then the quotient would be af. That's an exercise. Okay, it's a good exercise.
00:22:33.534 - 00:23:41.844, Speaker A: It's easier to prove the quotient is an Af algebra than to prove the ideal is true for the ideal too. And that's a bit, that's a bit almost like, remember for vector spaces. If you, you have a finitely generated vector space and you want to define the kernel and you want to show that every operator has indexed, every linear operator has indexed, then you have to look at the kernel of the operator and the co kernel and show that those are both finitely generated, right? Okay, that's because that's what finite index means. It means the kernel and the co kernel are finitely generated. Well, if you have a quotient space of a finitely generated vector space, then the finite generating set maps into, the finite generating set maps into a finite set in the quotient which will be generating. That's a no brainer. Okay, but nothing personal.
00:23:41.844 - 00:24:39.210, Speaker A: But if it's a subspace, like the kernel, the co kernel is a quotient. By the way, you take the image on the whole co domain and you divide the co domain by the image, and that's the co kernel. And then if that's finitely generated, you look at the fake dimension of that, and that's if you, that's one of the, you look at the smallest possible number of generators is finite, and then you do the same for the kernel, except you have to know the kernel is finitely generated. Okay, so it's a subspace. The only way you see immediately something is finitely generated if the big space is, is if it's a quotient. So you take the current subspace and you describe it as a quotient. In other words, you construct a complementary subspace, another subspace, such that the direct sum intersection is zero and the sum is everything.
00:24:39.210 - 00:25:07.926, Speaker A: So the whole space is the direct sum of the two subspaces, and it doesn't matter. Well, the way, how do you do this? It's the same procedure. It's a trivial procedure. It's the same way you construct the basis. Okay, you just, it's a slight, that's a good exercise. Review how you do it. But it's not one of the big theorems of linear algebra.
00:25:07.926 - 00:25:48.182, Speaker A: It's just an exercise like the Gram Schmidt, it's just an analog. It's a quantification of what's called the Gram Schmidt process. But that means then that your subspace, arbitrary subspace of the finitely generated vector space has a complementary subspace. But then if you divide out by that, you exactly get your subspace up to isomorphism, right? Okay, but then that represents that, that way you've described, you've obtained, you've described your subspace as a quotient. So therefore it's finitely generated as the whole space was. Okay, that's how. That's.
00:25:48.182 - 00:26:43.494, Speaker A: That's how you prove that index exists. And that's supposed to be trivial. The non trivial statement is that. Well, what's the non trivial statement, Abigail, in terms of the index, the index you got by subtracting the two of these two numbers. And if the whole space is finitely generated, then what do you know about the index? Of course I'm asking you something which you don't. I expect that you didn't learn it in previous years, because unless someone, unless you had a very, very advanced course, talking about index, did you just say the index should be zero? Okay, well, that's exactly. That's exactly the.
00:26:43.494 - 00:27:01.682, Speaker A: That's the fundamental statement in linear algebra. That's one. One of 14 different formulations, okay? And it's. The index exists. That's straightforward. The whole space is finitely generated. But the fact that the index is zero, that's a deep theorem.
00:27:01.682 - 00:28:13.550, Speaker A: That's linear algebra, okay? And it's quite a strong statement, because if it's not, well, in finite, finitely generated vector space, every operator has some index zero, every linear operator, and the phase into itself is index zero. And that's actually only true in the finite regenerated case. If it's. If it's a vector space which is not finitely generated, then you can. It's a good exercise to find an operator, linear operator that has index, that has indexed, but the index is not zero. Okay? And that's fair game as an exercise for the weekly homework. And if you want to, I'd say it's also super fair game if you want to write an essay where you take a random selection of these implications between two non trivial linear algebra statements, and not throwing too much into not making it a loaded question, not making the statement.
00:28:13.550 - 00:28:58.060, Speaker A: I mean, if you have, if you talk about the null of rank nullity, and you define the rank and annuity as dimensions, well, that's cheating, okay? Because that's assuming that dimension makes sense. But that's one of the deep theorems. You want to use frank nullity defined in terms of fake dimension to prove that the real fake dimension is real. Does that make sense? The fake dimension is just the smallest number of generators. So, ranked annuity, you have linear transformation in a finitely generated vector space. So the. The nullity is finite in terms of.
00:28:58.060 - 00:29:30.164, Speaker A: Because since there's a finite set of generators, the fake dimension is the smallest number of generators. That's finite. And for the rank, that's the image of the operator. And that's a subspace, so it's finitely generated and so it has a fake dimension and rank. And so you rank, and then the whole space has fake dimensions. You have three numbers, and there's a formula. And actually, if you look at that formula, then what it says.
00:29:30.164 - 00:30:01.932, Speaker A: I'm letting the cat out of the bank. But that's a terrible thing to say, isn't it? But it's an expression. Just an expression. If you look at these three numbers combined in a certain way in an equation, what does. Abigail. What does that equation say? It's. Well, I'm hoping that what you're going to say is.
00:30:01.932 - 00:30:33.680, Speaker A: What it says is this proper combination, this appropriate combination of the three numbers, the fake dimension of the whole space and of the range kernel of the operator. If you've expressed these as an equation, that equation just says that the index is zero, which is. You don't have to call it rank nullity, you just call it index, which is. That's a grown up. That's grown up by the line. Okay. But that's my.
00:30:33.680 - 00:31:10.120, Speaker A: I figured. I consider that to be my job here. Well, every year, to introduce the world, to introduce what I like to think of as grown up mathematics to. Okay, well, I'm talking through my hat, right? I don't know what. I don't know what mathematics is. Don't quote me on that, but maybe I'm supposed to follow my life. All right, okay.
00:31:10.120 - 00:31:42.550, Speaker A: But. So, it is what reminded me of this fake dimension. The number of generators was finite. If it's finite for a vector space, it's finite for the quotient. What reminded me is if the algebra is the corresponding fact, analogous fact that if the algebra is afraid it's a limit of finite dimensional algebras, then the quotient is going to be such a limit, too. So it's a. Yeah, that's easy.
00:31:42.550 - 00:31:59.622, Speaker A: Just like passing the quotient of a vector. Vector. And then. Now, it's a little trickier for the ideal, because it's not. There's no complementary. There's no complementary subalgeber in general. Okay? If you had a.
00:31:59.622 - 00:32:42.014, Speaker A: If a were equal to. If there were some algebra of a, which is isomorphic to the quotient, like there. A complement to the ideal, which is a subalgebra and wasn't isomorphic in the quotient of baf, well, if you. If you knew that the. In that case, well, you wouldn't even know that was an ideal. For one thing, you couldn't divide out by it in the algebraic sense. Of course, if there were an ideal, if it were the direct sum of two ideals, then it's easy because one of the ideals would be divided out by one of the ideals.
00:32:42.014 - 00:33:11.346, Speaker A: You'd get the other one. Okay. And any quotient of an a thousand. But the, it's an exercise, definitely to prove that. But an ideal of an af algebra is af, even in a purely algebraic setting. Look at it as a purely algebraic exercise. A is the union.
00:33:11.346 - 00:34:23.929, Speaker A: So we're asking if it is a ideal is a. If a is the increasing union of finite dimensional algebra, finite sums of matrix algebra, then does that also hold for the ideal? Okay, you may not be able to do it. I may not be able to do it cold turkey, but you shouldn't always just do things that you know how to do, or. No, that's a silly thing to say. Maybe you can't finish doing it until you know how to do it, but a lot of the effort is to find the out how to do it. Then, by the way, I guess once you find out how to do it, you should do it just to nail it down, which means writing it out and then maybe handing it in, even. All right? Okay.
00:34:23.929 - 00:35:24.156, Speaker A: But the main question is that, well, it's decidedly not an exercise, and, well, it's a conceptual exercise, if you like. In case theory, it's an application, k one, right? So you might think af algebras are just k zero, and that's what the classification is. But, and then if k one is equal to zero, then that's all there is to it. But in fact, you can make hey. With the fact that k one is zero. That's what implies that if the ideal and the quotient are af, then a itself is af. Okay? And that's a rather major result.
00:35:24.156 - 00:36:12.390, Speaker A: Okay? I had proven that if there were a complementary sub algebra, which was af, complementary subaltern would be isomorphic to the quotient. If there were one, then the a was af. I had proven that for that, you have to show a projection in the quotient, that it comes from a projection in the algebra. Okay? And I didn't know how to prove that. One day at a meeting, famous Larry Brown, Lawrence G. Brown came up to me, and I knew who he was. So I immediately got a bit nervous, and he said, this is after I had done the k zero.
00:36:12.390 - 00:36:42.650, Speaker A: Bradley had done the Bradley diagram classification of af algebras, and without realizing it was the same thing. Technically, it was the same thing. I had done the k zero classification of af algebra without calling it k zero. Just calling it very fundamental dimensions is what it is. My point of view is the name k zero came later. Well, it did, I guess. Okay, but what Larry Brown.
00:36:42.650 - 00:38:03.344, Speaker A: So some of you may have heard this historical sketch, but Larry Brown came up to me and he said, you know what? What you're doing is k zero. Okay, well, I knew I should be paying more attention, but I didn't, and I, and I just said, so, okay? So what he said was, so there's, there's also k one. And he knew I was trying to lift projections, okay? And he, and he was just giving me a hint, because that's how you do it. You use the fact that k one of the ideal is zero. You can assume that the quotient is enough to lift projections. You can assume that the quotient is just the complex numbers, okay? And there's a simple k zero proof that at least the k zero class of the unit of this, of this algebra, the production, the k zero class of the production comes from the k zero comes from the k zero class of a projection upstairs. Okay, there's a certain short exact theorem which is called this exact sequence of bot periodicity.
00:38:03.344 - 00:38:37.570, Speaker A: The short exact sequence of. No, it's a six term exact sequence of bot periodicity. This is a short exact sequence, sister algebra. So if you, you get a short sequence of k zero groups. Short, but it's not exact at the end. So it's not exact here and here. Then you get another one for k one, because these are just, because these are functors, okay? Remember, k one is just k zero of the suspension, and the suspension of any static algebra is.
00:38:37.570 - 00:39:28.218, Speaker A: There's some functions into the real line, into the band account for vanishing affinity. Okay? So that's. But it's not, neither of these sequences is a short exact sequence. But it turns out that there's an index is pertinent in the general setting of sister algebras because there's an index map that goes from k one of the quotient to k zero of the algebra, okay? And that's the even index map. And the index is even in the k zero group. Then there's an odd one, too. And this is the 6th term sequence now, and it's exact.
00:39:28.218 - 00:40:02.514, Speaker A: Okay? And that's bought periodistically. That's one way of stating bot periodistic. It's only true for the compact number. So the index map exists in the real case, too, the even index map. But the odd index map requires the complex number. All right, well, let's start fitting things in if it's a quotient is af, then this is zero. Okay, before the k one of the quotient is zero and k one of the.
00:40:02.514 - 00:40:19.198, Speaker A: I'm writing these left to right. Sometimes people write the second row right to left. That's because they. They don't realize that this crossing over the graph is. Can be. Can be embedded in the plane. There's a way of writing.
00:40:19.198 - 00:41:03.332, Speaker A: There's a way of drawing it so the lines don't cross if you object to that. Anyone see it? How you can write this, all these arrows in the plane without a crossover? Okay, well, okay, that's a planar topology. Don't tell anyone. This course doesn't have topology. All right, so. All right, so we have. But what that means is that, well, the important thing is the k one of the ideal is zero.
00:41:03.332 - 00:42:12.982, Speaker A: What that means is that you have a map upstairs from the big algebra to the k zero, over the big algebra to k zero of the quotient. If the next arrow is zero, just the arrow itself, not even the codomain. If the x arrow is zero, then what does that mean in terms of exactness? How many people have that? Fingertips. What does exactness mean? Larry? Do you know what exactness means? Charlie, do you know? Yeah. So, yeah, and the kernel is everything, right? If this map, this map is zero, the kernel, the kernel, its kernel is zero. Therefore, if you have exactness exactly here, then the kernel, which is everything, equal to the image of the preceding map, the preceding map will be everything. So it's other words, it's surjective.
00:42:12.982 - 00:42:38.468, Speaker A: Now, we want to prove surjectivity at the level of projection, right? But at least you get surjectivity at level of k zero. Any k zero element comes from a k zero element. Any k zero element here comes from a k zero element. That's what this says. And that's bot very distant. Okay. And the rest is just mopping up, going from k zero elements to projections to positive k zero elements to projections.
00:42:38.468 - 00:43:15.534, Speaker A: That's really just cleaning up after a good day's work. Some people were repairing the roof outside my office. They left a pile of trash outside my window. I wish they'd come and clean it up. I could tell them to try and use what periodicity. The periodicity would be seeing them come back. I wish.
00:43:15.534 - 00:44:29.724, Speaker A: Okay, how are we doing? Well, how did I get into Bach very distance? Well, it's af algebra. I was trying to persuade people that there's nothing wrong with starting. At the end of the book, we've got a description of the algebra as a limit, the Bartley diagram algebra for the pascal triangle. And the question is, what happens at the level of groups? Well, if you take k zero of the complex numbers, you get some. Hands up, what's k zero over complex numbers? This is only people who don't know. Right? Okay. Everyone knows.
00:44:29.724 - 00:45:11.360, Speaker A: Good. I can just say, all right, so z and then z plus z, okay, with the k zero map, it's a functor, right? So you have model 51. Well, it turns into model 51. A map from z to z has a model 50. What you multiply by, if they either multiply by zero or by one or by two or, and if it's a positive map, if it takes, if it preserves order, then it's a positive. Multiplying by multiplicity is positive, okay, including possibly zero. But if the unit goes to the unit, then, well, we, we've decided the diagram is this.
00:45:11.360 - 00:46:01.964, Speaker A: And that means the, the mass is non zero, multiplying by one. And at the next stage, again, we have a z on the outside, two zs on the outside, and what do we have in the middle? What's k zero of matrices over complex numbers over a field? Okay. Sometimes it's easier working with idempos. Okay, this is slightly tricky to show that matrices have the same k zero group as the algebra you start with. Take matrices over an algebra. Ask what that algebra has for k zero. Well, with the module definition, you have to.
00:46:01.964 - 00:46:45.018, Speaker A: That's a good exercise to work it out. Okay. But for idempotent, nothing could be simpler, because if you look at the algebra, when they look at idempotence, this is in the unit whole case, right? If you look at the algebra, then it's the case. They're always idempotent. Governance classes of idempotence. Well, that may not, you may not be able to add always, but then you look at matrices, you look at idempotence in the matrix algebra instead. In addition, in addition, and you think of the algebra itself as sitting in the upper left hand corner.
00:46:45.018 - 00:47:22.514, Speaker A: So you get more and more idempotence as the matrix algebra gets larger and larger. But suppose you, okay, so you look at them one by one, matrices two by two, three by three, and so on. But suppose you throw away the one by ones and the three by threes, and you just look at the two by twos and the four by fours and the six by sixes. Okay? Then those are matrix algebras. It's the same. It's the same. You're just taking the union so you get the same idempotence.
00:47:22.514 - 00:47:53.014, Speaker A: It's the same algebra. Okay. The union of the algebra is the same whether you take all of them or just the even numbered ones. Right? But then even numbered ones are exactly matrix algebras over the two by two matrix algebra. So that means that the two by two matrix algebra, when you take, when you take matrix algebra over that, you're going to see this. Exactly the same idempotent and the same equivalences. So the k zero, Marie fundamental and semi group is the same idempotent equivalent.
00:47:53.014 - 00:48:46.044, Speaker A: Maybe the Marie von Neumann is the self, a joint case production. Kaplansky did it for the non star case. Kropansky, Murray, van Lehman, Semiguru. How many people recognize the name Kropansky? Somewhere there's a chart, there's a board on the wall showing the early history, at least of the, of course, just the early history of this annual Putnam competition. Well, the very first one. Who won the very first Putnam competition? Well, how many names have I mentioned in the last two minutes? Yeah, okay. And who disposed and what team? What university team disposed won the first putnam team of three.
00:48:46.044 - 00:49:11.984, Speaker A: Well, yeah, we're here. This is it. Yeah. And it went back and forth, of course. It's a slight, slight sort of fly in the ointment. What was the prize? The prize was not a scholarship to U of T. It was a scholarship to Harvard.
00:49:11.984 - 00:49:50.276, Speaker A: Well, fine, fine. Okay. But the next several years, the winner, the winning team, and the winning person, I believe, as I roughly recall, just moved back and forth between the two places. And Kopansky took the scholarship to Harvard. And one of his students was a, someone who's well known in the, in the area of popular entertainment. Maybe the name still resonates. Now.
00:49:50.276 - 00:50:36.114, Speaker A: How many people are familiar with the comedian? Perhaps Tom Lehrer? You can look it up. T o m l e h r VR. There's another related question. How many people are familiar with the canadian comedy team Wayne and Schuster? Well, again, that's before, it's not before my time. But on the other hand, it's, it's famous enough, but they're worth looking up. Wayne and Schuster. Okay, all right.
00:50:36.114 - 00:51:20.254, Speaker A: Well, okay, and, but they were, when they were, they were, well, they were forming, they formed a team already when they were undergraduates here. But with the undergraduate, at the undergraduate level, it wasn't Wayne and Schuster. What do you suppose it was, huh? No, it was. Well, that's a good point. It wasn't alphabetical. Wayne and Schuster, not alphabetical, but it was even less alphabetical when they were here, it was Wayne and Schuster and Koplansky. Okay.
00:51:20.254 - 00:52:11.694, Speaker A: That's more so of history. But Kopensky, of course, had an illustrious career. He was head of the mathematics at the University of Chicago, and he was the first director of Mathematical Sciences research institute in Berkeley. And he was. I like to think that almost, almost, first and foremost, he was an operator of algebra. And once you talk about the Koplansky Mary phenomena equivalents, and it's clear it's not just seastar. Algebra.
00:52:11.694 - 00:52:31.634, Speaker A: Algebra. Just algebra or algebraic geometry. Okay, so that's, um. So in the middle, it's how many people don't know. Again, everybody knows. Good. All right.
00:52:31.634 - 00:52:56.162, Speaker A: And they just. You can put dots if you don't. You don't want to write anything more or don't have time. Okay. Did, um. Did someone just come in and then leave again? That maybe was, uh, going to take over, wanted to take over the room? They, they came in and they. And they saw.
00:52:56.162 - 00:53:11.734, Speaker A: They saw us in action and decided it was too, too risky. Okay. Okay. We'll be happy to carry on discussion in the hall.
