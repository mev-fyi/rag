00:00:02.400 - 00:00:38.514, Speaker A: Examples? To show the difference between tangential and non tangential, we start with example that Sheldon mentioned. Example f of z equal to exponential. And please allow me to write it this way. One plus z. Z one minus z. And put the minus there. Sheldon wrote z plus one over z minus one, which is perfectly fine, but please, please allow me to write it that way.
00:00:38.514 - 00:00:43.994, Speaker A: Christina has a question, I think. Hey, Christina.
00:00:50.694 - 00:00:56.434, Speaker B: Sorry, I'm having problems again. So sorry.
00:00:57.134 - 00:01:00.542, Speaker A: Do you mean that you do not hear the lecture or.
00:01:00.718 - 00:01:11.598, Speaker B: No, no, it's that I don't know how to explain. When I want to activate the sound, I'm not able. And the same happens sometimes with the.
00:01:11.686 - 00:01:13.974, Speaker A: Camera, but do you hear me?
00:01:14.054 - 00:01:16.334, Speaker B: Yes. Yes. Perfectly okay.
00:01:16.414 - 00:01:19.034, Speaker A: Thank you. So, do you have a question now?
00:01:20.104 - 00:01:20.952, Speaker B: No. No.
00:01:21.088 - 00:01:21.464, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:21.504 - 00:01:22.080, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:01:22.232 - 00:01:27.616, Speaker A: No problem. Because I saw in my screen that you raised your hand. I thought there is a cloud.
00:01:27.680 - 00:01:31.056, Speaker B: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I don't know how this happened.
00:01:31.200 - 00:01:54.210, Speaker A: It's okay. I mean, as I said, it's a. It's a classroom. We are just chat together. So this function is defined on the. On the open unities. It is very simple to see that when we approach to the .1
00:01:54.210 - 00:02:23.470, Speaker A: on this radius. So here is r. When we consider f of r is exponential minus one plus r, one minus r. And we see that limb f of r goes to one. From below is. I mean, this part explodes to plus infinity. With minus in front, it becomes zero.
00:02:23.470 - 00:03:10.534, Speaker A: This part is easy. A little bit of work that is not really difficult. I leave it as an exercise for the students. If you can see the any non tangential domain. So c is fixed, but by bigger than one still. You can show that Lim z goes to the boundary f of z, but z stays in the gamma C anchor, that one still the limit is here. It's not that difficult.
00:03:10.534 - 00:04:03.268, Speaker A: You need to calculate the absolute value of this. And then you will see again poisson kernel. But at the end of the day, you see that if you go from inside this gamac to the boundary, again, the limit is equal to zero. And indeed, this is a good example to see the phenomenon we mentioned before. The phenomenon was that when you change your c, your delta changes, too. That's a very explicit formula here. And for this explicit formula, if you write absolute value of f of z less than epsilon and calculate z, you will clearly see that the delta depends on C.
00:04:03.268 - 00:04:59.364, Speaker A: And when c grows, delta goes to infinity. So this is okay. This is okay. And the third one, show that lim, when z goes to one f of z, does not exist. In other words, the first method, when you go to the boundary without any restriction, is not working here. And this part is not difficult to show. It's enough to show that, for example, there is a sequence which goes to the boundary, and the sequence has to be kind of tangential to.
00:04:59.364 - 00:05:47.474, Speaker A: .1 example, find zn in d such that zn goes to one, but f of zn doesn't go to zero. A sequence here which goes toward the boundary, but when we calculate fl, it doesn't go to zero. So we see here the radial limit was zero for sure. Generalized non tangential limit was zero. But when you remove the restriction, no, it doesn't exist. So we end up with this limit doesn't exist.
00:05:47.474 - 00:06:45.444, Speaker A: And up to here, I mean, all the calculations are elementary. Everybody can do that. What is a bit more difficult, and it's not easy to show, you need better understanding of hardy spaces. You can ask this question, well, the limit doesn't exist, but consider all sequences, all zn in d, such that zn goes to one and limb of f of z n exists. All such sequences and go to infinity. We know that they exist. I mean, we just saw one specific one here.
00:06:45.444 - 00:07:18.728, Speaker A: Any sequence here which goes toward one will give us zero. The boundary limit is equal to zero. So this exists and is equal to zero. So you consider all these sequences, all limit exists, and then put all these limits together. So define a set s. Oh, the naming doesn't matter. The set of all limits, n term n goes to infinity, f out z.
00:07:18.728 - 00:08:19.554, Speaker A: All of these limits goes to one. I didn't write it properly. We have to assume that the limit exists, but you understand what I mean. So you collect all the possible accumulation point. When you go toward the boundary, you know that zero is there, depending on the example. I ask here, you may find some other points, but this is a more general question, what is all of them? I mean, if you put them all together, and it's interesting to know that you can approach pretty much everything, it cannot be bigger than that, because f of z is less than or equal to one. I mean, this is not difficult to prove that this function is less than one on d.
00:08:19.554 - 00:09:06.904, Speaker A: So when you go toward the boundary, it cannot be bigger than one. But it is interesting to know that when you go toward the boundary, you get everything. So in a sense, in a sense, you can say it this way, this is a horrible point. This is really, or we can say it's a very interesting point. When you go to that point, you can get anything. All the points of the open unit test. So, this is a topic that I do not enter into discussion on this, but I just wanted to highlight the fact that even with analytic functions, I mean functions which are very, very nice inside.
00:09:06.904 - 00:09:49.808, Speaker A: When you go toward the boundary, something very strange can happen. And this example, just to make you be more surprised, this example is an example for which there is one singular point. There is one point on the boundary which I mean, is bad. The. .1 there are functions, one of them constructed by Frassmann, indeed, such that when you go toward the boundary, almost every point is like the. .1
00:09:49.808 - 00:10:30.594, Speaker A: in other words, for almost all points, when you go to boundary, the accumulation point is the bar. This is one thing. And the other one is that when you go toward any point, almost everywhere, the non tangential limit exists and is unimodular. Is absolute value one? If you think carefully about this, it's really counterintuitive. Probably I will comment more about this at the end of the lectures. And now, two participants raise hands. If there is a question, please go ahead.
00:10:30.594 - 00:11:14.924, Speaker A: Yes, I have a question. Is there a connection between the last spec we saw and the fact that at one, the function has an essential singularity? Yes, there is a theorem for that which I mean. This function I rapidly mentioned is generated by a singular measure, which is Dirac measure. And the Dirac measure is anchored at the. .1 the general theorem says that with respect to that measure, almost all points are like that are singular points. I emphasize not with respect to lobe measure, with respect to the measure mu, which represent the function f.
00:11:14.924 - 00:11:49.328, Speaker A: Thank you. Any further question? Okay. And I said there is a modification of this function, which is interesting. And when we do this modification to plask products has some application. Consider the same function. So this is my example. One, but a bit modified still.
00:11:49.328 - 00:12:03.264, Speaker A: I call it f. It's not the same f. It's another example. The example we had before. Minus one plus z. One minus z. This was bad at.
00:12:03.264 - 00:12:33.784, Speaker A: .1 but consider a multiplier here. For example, a simple multiplier. Multiply by one minus z. And the exercise show that this function is nice. In other words, f belongs to the disk algebra. Belonging to the disk algebra means it is continuous at all point of the boundary.
00:12:33.784 - 00:13:09.114, Speaker A: Well, if z is not equal to one, it is trivial. The only thing you need to show is that limit z tends to one. No restriction f of z exists and is equal to one. I think there are two comments. Let me see in the chat if nontangential, radial and z at all in. Yes, well, of course, when non tangential limit exists. Radial limit is a special case of that.
00:13:09.114 - 00:14:16.264, Speaker A: For the case c equal to one, it has to be the same. And in the in the context of hardy spaces, either we consider in h infinity or in hp, this is always the case. Non tangential and radial coincide. So in this modified example, I asked you to show that if you have a good multiplier, if you multiply by one minus z, then you transform your previous function, which had a very strange singularity, to something which is extremely nice. The new function is in the disk. Algebra is continuous at all point of the boundary. For this example, example one, or example two, which is the modified version of example one.
00:14:16.264 - 00:15:00.880, Speaker A: We do not need a special tool, it works perfectly well. But if you there are some more sophisticated examples for them, we need the definition of blaschke program. I do not want to enter them here. If there is a time at the end which I don't think there will be, we can talk about canonical factorization theorem, which is needed in many talks which are coming. But I just write the definition of a Plaschke product, accepted as it is. Details are in the book. If you have a sequence zn in the dark, it satisfies this gross restriction.
00:15:00.880 - 00:15:52.306, Speaker A: One minus mod zn is finite. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for this function to be well defined. Product n from one to infinity zn minus z, one minus zn and bar z. This is an automorphism of the open unit disk sends d to d bijectively. If you put z equal to zero, this combination becomes zn. The argument of zn can be a problem. In other words, n can rotate infinitely many times around zero.
00:15:52.306 - 00:16:45.034, Speaker A: To overcome this difficulty, we multiply here by a unimodular constant. To fix that argument, either some books write e to the I theta n such that theta n satisfies these properties. Or we can say mod zn divided by zn. And now if you put z equal to zero, the whole combination becomes absolute value of zn and absolute value of zn. Its argument is zero and the convergence problem is fixed. And this function is well defined. And now assume that these points, I mean they are in the open unit disk, infinitely many of them.
00:16:45.034 - 00:17:27.814, Speaker A: They converge toward the boundary. So they can converge either to 1.2 point infinitely many points. And even in the extreme case, which is the monster which constructed by Frassmann, he considered that it can go to, it can converge to all points of the boundary. And indeed the construction is not not difficult. You consider any positive sequence which satisfies this. For example, zn equal to one minus one over two, n n bigger than or equal to one.
00:17:27.814 - 00:18:26.384, Speaker A: It's better to write rn rn equal to that. I mean, these points are on the radius zero one, and they converge toward the. .1 and now you can add some arguments to them. Which argument? For example, zn equal to rn e to the I, theta n one minus one over two, n e to the I, and you choose theta n such that our sequence rotates around the open, around the origin infinitely many times and becomes closer and closer to the, to the boundary. For example, e to the in. That works well, this is not the only one, but I mean, there are many, many options.
00:18:26.384 - 00:19:23.084, Speaker A: But let's consider the simple case, something like this. The same phenomenon as before. You can show that when Lim zn goes to one, it was here exactly like this function. You can show that when you go to one, the limit is equal to zero. Not for all Blaschke sequences, but for this one, it works for this one. When you go toward the boundary, the limit of bn is equal to zero. So if this is our sequence, you can show that limb of br equal to zero when r goes to one.
00:19:23.084 - 00:20:24.810, Speaker A: As Paul mentioned, in this setting, radial and non tangential limits are the same. So either use that theorem or directly show that limb b of z, when z goes to one non tangentially. Wow. What happened? When z goes to one non tangentially, is again equal zero. However, when z goes to one with no restriction, p of z does not exist. The limit does not exist. And precisely the same hint I gave here, a bit more difficult.
00:20:24.810 - 00:21:13.770, Speaker A: But anyhow, we can fix it. Find the sequence z such z n go to one. But b of z, the n doesn't go to zero. So it shows that the limit is not, does not exist when you go to one. And the strange phenomenon that we saw for that exponential function, it happens here too. If we accumulate all the, if you put all the accumulation point in one set, the set is big, is the whole closed unit disk. So this function has the same bad behavior at the boundary one as the function before, but at all other points of the boundary, it's a nice function.
00:21:13.770 - 00:22:14.452, Speaker A: So the only bad point is here. At all other points of the, of the boundary, the function is nice. It's even analytic. What Frassman did, he constructed a Blaschke product, call it a monster. So a blushker product says that almost all point of the boundary are bad points, are singular points. So this phenomenon, this happens at almost all points of the of the boundary, and at the same time, at the same time, non tangential limit exists and is unimodular. It's completely counterintuitive what he constructed modification that we can do for this function.
00:22:14.452 - 00:23:22.472, Speaker A: It is not difficult to show that for any of this plasket protocol. It doesn't matter either this one or with an argument. If zn goes to one, or even more, more general than that. If you define f of z equal to a multiplier, and this multiplier here is z minus one times b of z, then limb z goes to one, f of z is equal to zero. It's not always z minus one is the favorite one. Another one is z minus one squared b of z. Dan Sarason has a series of lecture notes about corona problem, corona construction, even Douglas algebra.
00:23:22.472 - 00:24:19.920, Speaker A: And at the very beginning, it rapidly talks about blush, about hardy spaces to make the set, arrange the setting. And this is one of the function that is considered, if I'm not mistaken, over there, for the purpose that it's a function for which f prime belongs to h infinity. F prime is not necessarily if, in general, the derivative of a plaske product is not even the Smirnov class. But if you multiply by this multiplier, it becomes bounded. And it has some interesting applications. I mean, this is not difficult to prove. So, this shows the importance of multipliers.
00:24:19.920 - 00:24:52.396, Speaker A: And the reason I mentioned multiplying by z minus one or z minus one squared. Because, I mean, this is as an information. In the hardest page setting, zero sets are classified. These are precisely the blusher condition. Here, a sequence is a zero set of a function in the hardest phase, if and only if it satisfies this plascus. Complete characterization. Beautiful point.
00:24:52.396 - 00:25:22.454, Speaker A: End of the story. In the Dirichlet space, it's still an open question. There are optimal theorems. It says that under these conditions, for example, Shapiro Schills has a sufficient condition. Under that we have a zero set. And we can even justify that their condition is optimal. But there is no complete characterization.
00:25:22.454 - 00:26:13.624, Speaker A: We have a set of sufficient conditions, a set of necessary conditions. And in between, it's an open question. It is not settled in. In between, the argument of zeros are important. And in some cases, if you have a good multiplier, like z minus one here, or z minus one squared there, and even some more sophisticated multipliers, you can show that you can form a blaschka product times that multiplier. The result stays in the hardy, in the Dirichlet space, and you have a zero set. Again, construction of those multipliers are not easy and not trivial.
00:26:13.624 - 00:27:12.584, Speaker A: However, the whole question is still an open question, just as an information. Well, this finishes our part about approach, region and examples. And now we want to start to talk about representation theorem. To do so, we naturally need to know about LP spaces. I mean, I just mentioned the notation. Sometimes we write LP of T, sometimes LP of M. This is the set of functions which defined on t measurable with respect to luwag measure, and the integral of f e to the I theta exponent p d theta is finite.
00:27:12.584 - 00:28:21.364, Speaker A: And sometimes I hide e to the I theta and d theta and write the same thing as integral over t of f of zeta exponent p d m of zeta Dm is almost d theta is normalized. It means that we divide it by two PI. And sometimes, to emphasize that two PI belongs to d theta, we write it as I did, but most of the time we put it here in front of the integral. So this is a more compact way to write the same thing. And if this is finite, then we take the piece root and we denote it by norm p. And it's a norm if p is bigger than or equal to one, less than infinity. For p equal to infinity is the essential supremum.
00:28:21.364 - 00:29:01.066, Speaker A: And again, it's a norm, even though we use the same notation for p less than one. But you need to be careful. For p less than one, it's not a norm. But if I write it here, p less than one. But in this case, the distance between f and g can be defined as this quantity exponent p. This becomes a metric. And with respect to this metric, the space is complete.
00:29:01.066 - 00:29:52.550, Speaker A: It's a, it's a fresh air space. We do not enter that much into detail of this, but it's better to know, even though all the time, even for p equal to one, it's something common. I will mention normal f, but it's not really a norm. Keep this in mind. And also I need the measures, the Borel measures, which are defined on t. So m of t is the set of measure mu. Mu is a complex real measure on t.
00:29:52.550 - 00:30:43.384, Speaker A: In this case, I emphasize on complex, because we define the norm of mu to be absolute value of mu, the total variation of mu on the whole disk. What is the meaning of total variation? This is something that you should have seen in the course on measure theory. If not, I invite you to go and have a look. And also I emphasize the fact that this is not equal to mu of t absolute value. These are two different things, completely different. Total variation by itself is a measure and you should master what it means. Well, these are the definition.
00:30:43.384 - 00:31:53.090, Speaker A: Why did I mention these two? Because when we started the representation theorem, two theorems of fris come into play, and we badly need both of them to obtain our representation theorem. The first one is that it says that if p is between one and infinity, the exponent conjugate of p is defined by this identity. One plus p plus one over q is equal to one. And then ris theorem says that the dual of Lp is Lq. Lp star is equal to Lq. What does this mean? I'm cheating a bit here. The precise formulation is like this.
00:31:53.090 - 00:33:19.034, Speaker A: Lp star is isometrically, isomorphically equal to Lq. So there are two technical terms here, isomorphic, isometric. But they are, they are hidden in this identity. Again, to go into further detail, because this is really important for us, given g in Lq, we define lambda from lp to c by the following formula. Lambda of f is defined by integral t f zeta g zeta t and z. And to emphasize that lambda depends on g, even though g is fixed, it is better to write lambda index g here. Our variable for lambda G is f f changes over lp.
00:33:19.034 - 00:34:28.276, Speaker A: But the easy part of an easy depends how familiar you are with measured theory. But the easy part is to show that lambda G belongs to Lp star. In other words, it's a bounded linear functional on Lp, and also the norm of lg. As a linear functional is equal to the norm of g in Lq. I used two technical words. Isometrically isomorphic, isometric is for this one, the norm of lambda g is equal to the norm of g in Lq. This identity reflects in the wording isometric isomorphic, which is somehow the difficult part of the theorem, and proved by Marcel Reese says that there is no more.
00:34:28.276 - 00:35:34.898, Speaker A: I mean, these lambda g are all bounded linear functionals on Lp. So if we make this mapping, lambda G goes into the functional, it represents the important, the second important message of the theorem is that there is no more. This map is bijective and this part reflects the isomorphism part. So isomorphic, isometric, that's what it means. By simply hiding everything in this identity. Lp star is equal to Lq. I will need this when we go to study the representation theorem.
00:35:34.898 - 00:36:24.540, Speaker A: There is one comment on this lambda G, which I will come back to this a bit later. This doesn't work for p equal to one. This doesn't work for p equal to one. But what is the remedy? How we can find a solution for that p equal to one? I mean, l one l one of t. There are two ways to look at elements of l. One. One way we can consider f as a function defined on t with values of the.
00:36:24.540 - 00:37:14.064, Speaker A: This is the point of view that we adopted before. The other way is to interpret f as a measure. We defined mu by d mu e to the I theta is equal to f e to the I theta, d theta over two PI. So we look at f as a measure mu, and with this measure, in this way, we can put a copy of l one into m. M of t is there. We put a copy of l one inside m inside the set of Borel measures. And again, this is a good copy.
00:37:14.064 - 00:37:58.084, Speaker A: In other words, both words that I used before can be used here, too. It's isomorphic. Isometric. In other words, the total variation of mu, which we saw, its mu, total variation of t, is precisely the same as the normal f in l one of T. That's the isometric part. And the bijection here, not with all of mt, but just with the image, is one to one. Of course, it is on two, because we slick our.
00:37:58.084 - 00:38:44.744, Speaker A: But more importantly, it's one to one. So it's a bijection between l one and a copy of M of T. And with this point of view, we can find a remedy for the problem we had here. This didn't work for p equal to one and another theorem. Second theorem of Fris that we need here, with the same interpretation that we had before, says that c of t star is m of t. There is a comment. Let me see what is there in the chat.
00:38:44.744 - 00:39:54.896, Speaker A: If we take an absolutely continuous or l measured. Well, yes, but the question is that if we take an absolutely continuous Borel measure, is it represented by f in l one? Well, the answer is yes, but this phrase can be a theorem or can be just the consequence of the definition. It depends how you define absolute continuity. Some people, some authors define mew to be absolutely continuous if it has this form. And so in this case, the thing you mentioned is just a rephrase of the definition, but it's more profound than that. The right definition is that if you have a set of low back measures zero, then this measure is also zero. On that.
00:39:54.896 - 00:40:40.364, Speaker A: If this is your definition, then this phrase is a theorem, and it's not easy to prove that. So it depends how you define absolute continuity. But at the end of the day, the answer is yes. Okay, so that, that this has. Yes. Okay, so doesn't matter which one you, you adopt as a definition, but the final answer is yes, even though with the more honest definition, it's kind of difficult theorem to prove. So back to this, and let's finish this again to magic word isometric isomorphism.
00:40:40.364 - 00:42:45.324, Speaker A: You know what it means here with any measure mu. So mu is in M. We can define lambda mu from c of t to c by the formula anti integral of it t f d mu. And isometric part means that the norm of lambda mu as a functional is equal to the norm of mu as a measure in M. And isomorphic part means that if you can see the m of t and you project it into c of t star by the formula that we saw above, this mapping is bijective. So again, as before, we have isomorphic isometric pairing between c of t star, the dual of c of T and m of T. This is not this finite, and also this one I need in coming lectures to finish in the last remaining five minutes, I would like to make a comment about this representation this way of defining lambda G and even this one for lambda mu.
00:42:45.324 - 00:43:25.580, Speaker A: This is not the only way, the only method that we can make this pairing. They are several different ways, and each one of them has an advantage. I summarize them here below the one I wrote about lambda Gof. It was defined integral over t f g no g bar g g dm. This is good. Everything works well. We can say this is definition one.
00:43:25.580 - 00:43:59.118, Speaker A: With this we saw, we have isomorph morphic isomorphism number two for some reasons. In particular, when we studied dual spaces of hardy spaces, some authors prefer to write f g bar dm. This is good. It works perfectly well. We have the isomorphic part. Also we have the bijection. But note that our mapping here is anti linear.
00:43:59.118 - 00:44:35.282, Speaker A: It really doesn't matter. It's not linear, it's anti linear. But still the bijection holes and even these are not all. I mean another one, again, for a special reason. That means to take care of the constant that appears in some application. Another way to define lambda g is to define lambda glf by integral over t. They put a zeta here.
00:44:35.282 - 00:45:16.092, Speaker A: And note that our argument is zeta two here, zeta or zeta bar. Anything unimodular here works. There is a reason. It's not just out of, I mean, pleasure, that we put zeta here. There is a reason. The proofs become easier if we put zeta here. The good thing is that even under this definition, isometric isomorphism works, and also the last one, which indeed is not the last one which appears in the literature.
00:45:16.092 - 00:46:23.958, Speaker A: It's the last one which I mentioned. This also can be seen in papers integral of f zeta g of zeta bar dm zeta. They put bar on the zeta and when we studied again the convolution and there are some cancellation. With this formulation, it is easier to explain that the final result, the same variation which I mentioned 12344 for g, the same variation exists for lambda mu. In other words, you can define. For example, I defined lambda mu of f as integral of f d mu. Sometimes, sometimes it's better to define lambda mu of f as integral of f d mu and put a bar here it exists.
00:46:23.958 - 00:47:04.806, Speaker A: If you look at the papers you see such definition. Or put a zeta lambda mu of f integral of zeta f d mu or d mu bar. I mean, all this variation exists in the application. Two things. It in a sense it doesn't matter which of this representation we use. This is one thing, but the important thing is that the variation we use must be compatible. In other words, must be isometric isomorphism.
00:47:04.806 - 00:48:18.414, Speaker A: We obtain a good we obtain a good copy of lambda c star or a good copy of lambda p star. If this works, yeah, we have liberty to use the application. So this is a kind of summarization of functional spaces that we need then I will use this tomorrow to study in further detailed representation theorems. There is something in the chat. Is it any use for the unicellular? What do you mean by general set a? I mean, is this variation a use for the unit circle or the general set a? If I mentioned, I'm familiar with open unit disc and upper half plane and also some Smirnov domains. Such variation exists for the upper half plane and for the Smirnoff domain. More than that, I mean more general setting I'm not familiar with.
00:48:18.414 - 00:48:30.674, Speaker A: Well, thank you very much. I think this ends our today's lectures. I'm very.
