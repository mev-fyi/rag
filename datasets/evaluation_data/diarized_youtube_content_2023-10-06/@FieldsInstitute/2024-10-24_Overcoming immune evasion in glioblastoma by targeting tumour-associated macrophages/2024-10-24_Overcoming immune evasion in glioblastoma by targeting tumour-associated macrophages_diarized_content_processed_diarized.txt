00:00:06.560 - 00:00:26.987, Speaker A: Okay. Welcome back to day three. So, today it's my big pleasure to introduce one of the members of my lab, Blanche Manjean. Oops, sorry, everyone. I thought. I thought people were in. Blanche is a third year Biomathematics PhD candidate and NSERC CGSD scholar at the University of Montreal.
00:00:26.987 - 00:00:53.035, Speaker A: And she has a background in mathematics and computer science. Her research focuses on the development of mathematical models to study novel immunotherapies to tackle clinical trial failures and glioblastoma, the most aggressive primary brain tumor. And she's currently interested in how tumor associated macrophages promote glioblastoma immunoscape and targeting these immune cells to improve the prognosis of patients with glioblastoma. Take it away, Blanche.
00:00:54.925 - 00:01:29.665, Speaker B: All right. So. Well, hello everyone. So I'm really excited to be here today to present to you what's been my PhD research so far. So, as Morgan said, I'm interested in developing these mathematical models to tackle the clinical trial failures in glioblastoma, as well as to study the promise held by novel treatment strategies. So, just to make sure that we're all familiar with glioblastoma, we're talking about a really aggressive brain tumor, as well as, unfortunately, the most frequent primary brain tumor. So it's got a median survival of about three, four months without treatment.
00:01:29.665 - 00:01:57.875, Speaker B: Sorry. And of barely 15 months with treatment. The current standard of care is a resection that's followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. And it has pretty much remained unchanged in the last 20 years. It was established in 2005. The reason for that is that no other treatments were shown to be more effective than gliomastoma. So, as we probably all know, since this is an immuno oncology workshop, there's a lot of interest lately in developing immunotherapies in tumors.
00:01:57.875 - 00:02:33.555, Speaker B: And there's been successes in other types of solid tumors, such as melanomas, with, for example, immune checkpoint inhibitors. And so a glioblastoma is known to be highly immune invasive. And as such, scientists are interested in how we could train a patient's immune system to better recognize the tumor and attack the tumor in this context. So for that, we must understand how it escapes immune surveillance. There are different pathways that it uses to do so. The first one I'll talk about is the PD1 and PD L1 signaling axis. So, just a brief recap, I'll just stop.
00:02:33.555 - 00:03:29.395, Speaker B: Yep. So We've got the PD1 receptors that are expressed on the surface of CD8 positive T cells, and one of their ligands is PD L1, which is expressed on the surface of tumor cells and on some innate immune cells such as macrophages and microglia. When this happens, the PD1 act as a T cell break, meaning that the CD8 passive T cell is exhausted and cannot kill the tumor cell. There's interest in using an anti PD1 agent called nivumab, which was shown to be successful in melanoma, which would act as a break release by binding with the PD1, which would prevent the binding from between PD1 and PD L1. PD L1 expression was found in 88% of newly diagnosed glioblastomas. Which scientists to think that, well, this PD1 PD L1 signaling axis is an important immune escape mechanism in glioblastoma. And the successes that were served in melanomas might translate into successes in glioblastoma.
00:03:29.395 - 00:04:10.753, Speaker B: And so as such, clinical trials were set up, but unfortunately they failed. So what you see on the left is the Kaplan Meyer curve for the standard of care in well blue, which is so radiotherapy, RT and tmz, which stands for temosalamide, which is the chemotherapeutic drug in the glioblastoma standard of care. So we can see a median overall survival of about 14.6 months. Now on the right are the results of one of the clinical trial involving nivolumab in glioblastoma. So we're interested in the dashed gray line right here, which is nivolumab plus the standard of care. And we see a median overall survival of about 14.75
00:04:10.753 - 00:04:33.485, Speaker B: months. And so in other words, nivolumab was unsuccessful in improving significantly and impactfully the median overall survival. And so when we see that, the question that we can ask ourselves is, well, why did it work in melanoma and why did it not work in glioblastoma? And one of the hypothesis is that glioblastoma is what we call a cold tumor mean. Yes.
00:04:38.395 - 00:04:42.683, Speaker C: So you say there's no improvement, but I think there's a big improvement compared to the upper curve.
00:04:42.859 - 00:05:18.225, Speaker B: Yeah, so this, this curve is for the. So patients in glioblastoma can have methylated or unmethylated MGMT promoters. The subset of patients with the methylated MGMT promoters are known to respond more to treatments already. So we're looking at this curve which is for the unmethylated subset of the majority of patients with unmethylated MGMT promoters. So this is one of the results. There are clinical trials involving nivolumab on these patients with the methylated MGMT promoters and they have failed also. I just didn't put the results up on this slide.
00:05:18.225 - 00:06:23.615, Speaker B: So yeah, so the hypothesis that was made was that the clinical trials failed because of a lack of CD8 positive T cell in the tumor microenvironment. So the ICI works, but there are not enough T cells that their impact, even if they're activated and non exhausted, would be well impactful. And so we wanted to test this hypothesis by doing a mathematical model of glioblastoma with its immune microenvironment involving also the standard of care. And so for that we built an ordinary differential equation model starting with our glioblastomas cells G that can proliferate. And then of course we add in our first immune cells so the CD8 positive T cells denoted by T which can kill the tumor cells and be activated by the tumor cells. Then we needed to include the activation of the adaptive immune system by the innate immune system through the activation of the CD8 positive T cells by the tumor associated macrophages and microglia. So at first these cells were believed to be entitled so to have a negative role on the tumor cells.
00:06:23.615 - 00:07:33.395, Speaker B: But it was briefly mentioned yesterday that they can actually be polarized with a phenotype that's on a spectrum. And so on one end of the spectrum we've got the M1 tams, so those that are classically activated and those that are in tight role. But on the other end of the spectrum We've got the M2 tumor associated macrophages. So those that are alternatively activated and those that orwell actually pro tmol and favor an immune suppressed tumor microenvironment. In the context of a tumor such as glioblastoma, it's known to actually have more M2 tams than M1 tams, which results in a low recruitment of CA positive T cells. In our model we, to simplify things, Simply included the M1 like terms versus M2 lag tams, we've got the resident macrophages that can be activated with either one of the two phenotypes and TAMs can switch phenotypes. Once activated, the activation of the CD8 positive T cell is made dependent on the ratio of M2 to M1 TAMS to mimic the immunosuppression due to a low or well, due to a high ratio of M2 to M1.
00:07:33.395 - 00:08:31.125, Speaker B: Finally, as I said, we need to also include of course our PD1 and PD L1 receptors to mimic the exhaustion of the CD8 positive T cell by this binding of the PD1 with the PD L1. Then we've got our three treatments of interest at first, which is the chemotherapy and the radiotherapy for the standard of care. Now those act directly on the tumor cells and we have the anti PD1 agent naval map that would bind with the PD1 and thus block the PD1. Simply put, our model includes interaction between a glioblastoma and its immune microenvironment. It describes the dynamic of the different cell subtypes and it can easily simulate on and off different treatment strategies, which I'll come back to later on. So I won't go into details of how we model chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but I'd be happy to answer any question of that. But I will explain how we model CDEA positive T cell exhaustion by the PD1 PD L1 signaling axis.
00:08:31.125 - 00:09:23.749, Speaker B: So this is actually taken from a model by Elaine Friedman, established in 2017, where they came up with the function F right there, which depends on the concentration of PD1 receptors and on the concentration of PD L1 in the context of a tumor growth. Since the PD L1 is expressed on the tumor cells, we have this concentration that let's say tends to infinity and thus a function that tends to 0. And we've got immune evasion. Now with an anti PD1 agent, since it blocks the PD1 receptors, we have this concentration of PD1 receptors that are free to bind with the PD L1 that tend to 0 and thus a function F that tends to 1 and we've got the immune activation. All right. And so the first thing we did is to reproduce the clinical trials of standard of care plus ici. So we have this timeline right there.
00:09:23.749 - 00:10:11.335, Speaker B: So just say we've got about a three weeks break between the resection and the first six week cycle of chemotherapy with radiotherapy. Then after a four week break, we give six cycles of Temosol Medsulov chemotherapy with the drug administered for the first five days. The immunotherapy is given at first every two weeks for eight doses and then at larger doses every four weeks up to the end of the chemotherapy. What you see on the right are the results for assimilation for the standard of care and the standard of care plus ici. We've got a lethal threshold that was determined from clinical observations. And so as you can see, there's not really any difference. I think it's about two day difference between the survival between the two regimens.
00:10:11.335 - 00:10:58.831, Speaker B: This model was able to reproduce the clinical trial failures that was observed in the clinic. Now we can look at the function F that I presented earlier, which is the level of non exhaustion of the CD8 positive T cells. You have the green line right there. That is for the standard of care plus ici. And you see that it's successful in restoring the activation of the CD8 positive T cell. Again, the problem with the ICI not working in glioblastoma is not with its direct mechanism of action. But if we look at the hypothesis that is that maybe it fails because of a lack of CD8 positive T cell recruitment, we can actually introduce a Constant source of CD8 positive T cells in our model during treatment to look at its effect on the survival.
00:10:58.831 - 00:11:51.585, Speaker B: And when we do so, we see that we can observe an increase in survival in our model. And so this valid that the lack of CD8 positive T cell recruitment during treatment drives clinical trial failures. So once we have this, the question is well, what drives this lack of CD8 positive T cell recruitment and how can we target it? And so for that we can go back to the impact of temporarization on nivolumab efficacy. And so one of the advantage of using a mathematical model is that we can easily simulate different scenario. And so as such we can simulate an M1 knockout versus an M2 knockout. So in the context of an M2 knockout, all of the macrophages would be M2 knockout, would be antitrumoral versus an M1 knockout where they would all be protmoral. And as such we would expect expect a smaller response in treatment.
00:11:51.585 - 00:12:57.517, Speaker B: And so we simulate these strategies, these two scenarios, sorry during treatment at first. And so when we do so we have in the blue curve right here you've got the M2 knockout versus in the purple ish curve that you've got the M1 knockout. And so we do see a difference in survival when the knockout is during the treatment. But also if you look here, you've got the log two fold change in entitypoint one efficacy. So throughout the presentation the efficacy is calculated as the decrease in post treatment tumor cell count. And so you see that we've got a positive full change in n type 1 efficacy versus a negative full change heal log 2 full change in anti PD1 efficacy, meaning that the M2 knockout does result in an increase in nivolumab efficacy, likely due to an increase of CD8 positive T cells. Now to also see what's the impact of the tumor associated macrophages and microglia polarization on survival, we again simulate an M1 versus M2 knockout.
00:12:57.517 - 00:14:14.395, Speaker B: But in this case, we simulated starting at cancer initiation instead of starting at cancer treatment. So what if the tumor actually evolves in a tumor microenvironment that's completely deprived of either M2 or M110 starting at the first cells of tumors? This is what we get here for these simulations. You see that in the M2 knockout context, it actually stabilizes below this lethality threshold right there. It stabilizes below the death threshold, which means that the temporarization actually has a high impact on survival. This is because an M2 knockout results also in a higher level of activation of CD8 positive T cells, which leads to a higher level of cytotoxic of CD8 positive cytotoxic activity of these CD8 positive T cells. What's interesting also is that actually when we simulate the average model, so the model with the average M2 to M1 ratio, we have a curve that resembles closely that of an M1 knockout scenario. All right? And so, of course, the polarization scientists have already been looking into this polarization of TAMs, and they have come up with strategies of targeting the tumor associated macrophages and microchlia.
00:14:14.395 - 00:15:16.165, Speaker B: The strategies can usually be linked to one of two goals. So you can either reduce the number of temps in the tumor microenvironment or change their properties to shape them into entire tumor cells instead of protumoral. What our goal was afterwards was to do a theoretical analysis of these strategies in glioblastoma. So how can we use our model to include these strategies in order to see which ones are promising and which one would be worth looking into for this cancer? And so, as such, we'll concentrate at first on the strategies that aim to reduce the number of TAMS in the tumor microenvironment. And so every strategies was included in the model with a parameter to change the schematic of the model. At first, we can deplete the temp. In other words, we can induce our apoptosis through, for example, in the clinic, this could be done with CSF1R inhibitors, for example.
00:15:16.165 - 00:15:56.603, Speaker B: In the model, we do that by introducing a perimeter that would increase the death rate of the temps. Another way of reducing the number of temps in the tumor rectory environment is that, you see, we've got this constant source of resident TEMs in the model, and, well, we can reduce the recruitment of TEMS through, for example, CCL2 inhibitors. And so we introduced a model that inhibits this constant source. And so these are the results that we got from there. So I'LL just explain the heat maps because they'll come back. So at first. So you've got the first strategy here, which is to increase the death rate of tumor associated macrophages and microglia.
00:15:56.603 - 00:16:41.475, Speaker B: Then you've got the second strategy which inhibits the recruitment in the tumor microenvironment. Then for each of the heat map, the first row is for the standard of care plus the TAM targeting treatment tamt, and the second row is for standard of care plus TAMT plus nivolumab as well. The colors indicate the percent change with standard of care in post treatment tumor cell counts. In red would be a positive percentage, which would be an increase versus in blue and negative which would be a decrease. And the darker the color, the larger the decrease or the increase. And finally, as I said, every strategy is included in the model with a perimeter. So this allows us to simulate no efficacy at all.
00:16:41.475 - 00:16:45.855, Speaker B: So what if we just don't give the treatment versus a maximal efficacy?
00:16:52.325 - 00:17:01.453, Speaker C: Sorry, Blanche, for the interruption. Yeah, I was just wondering, for your base model already, did you tell us how you estimated the parameters and I did not.
00:17:01.629 - 00:17:16.505, Speaker B: They were estimated mostly from either the literature or from data that were publicly available and from clinical observations. So some of the parameters were fit to survival data, for example.
00:17:25.295 - 00:17:34.991, Speaker C: Yeah, I just wanted to clarify your color code. Does it indicate that this is a one point percent change or is it one and a half change?
00:17:35.183 - 00:17:37.711, Speaker B: No, no, it's in percent change. So that would be one percent.
00:17:37.863 - 00:17:39.431, Speaker C: Ah, so there's no big difference.
00:17:39.503 - 00:17:41.151, Speaker B: Yeah, which is what I love.
00:17:41.223 - 00:17:41.955, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:17:42.745 - 00:18:18.015, Speaker B: Which is what I'll come to. Yeah, so, yeah, so it's been mentioned in this context reducing the number of tans in the tumor microenvironment. If we do look at the color bar right there, we've seen an increase of 1.5%, which is low, but still an increase for the first strategy of increasing the death rate of TAMs. And for the second strategy when we inhibit the recruitment of resident TAMs, or in blue, so there's no increase, but. But we're in very light blue. So there's not really any difference in the post treatment tumor cell count.
00:18:18.015 - 00:19:24.147, Speaker B: And so what we did next is look at different metrics in our model and still we're looking at the percent change with the standard of care. And so we've got the standard of care plus ICI and either TAMT1, which is again increasing the death rate, or TAMT2, which is inhibiting the recruitment. And so what we see here, I've put, is that for when we increase the death rate of tumor associated macrophages, we actually increase because we increase the death rate of all the macrophages including the M1 like tumor associated macrophages. We also increased the M2 to M1 ratio actually in our model, which leads to a small increase in CD8 positive T cells activated. Either way, it's a really small increase, but that still explains why we've got an increase with this strategy. And so this brings me to a paper by O'Brien et al published in 2021 where they looked at different cell lines at an antibody that is actually an enticed CSF1R. So that would actually aim to deplete the tumor associated macrophages and microglia.
00:19:24.147 - 00:20:18.875, Speaker B: I've put the results for the LL2 cell line, it's actually for lung cancer because there were no cell lines that were for glioblastoma in this study. But it's also a cold tumor just like glioblastoma is. The point here is that they observed no difference in the tumor growth between control versus the treated group. They observed M1 and M2 depletion significantly but no change in CD8 positive T cells. In other words, their molecule was depleting the two types of tumor associated macrophages which resulted in no change in CD8 positive T cells. And so our hypothesis afterwards was does having a higher target specificity. So in other words, thus targeting the M2 like tumor associated macrophages and microglia instead of all of the TAMS would increase the efficacy of this strategy.
00:20:18.875 - 00:21:12.544, Speaker B: And so we tried this strategy by targeting targeting only the M2 TAMS which is in blue. And when we do so we observe a decrease in post treatment tumor cell count of about 12%. So it's still small, but just shows that higher target specificity in this strategy increases efficacy of depleting the tams. But either way reducing the number of TAMS does not seem to have an impactful impact have a big impact on the post treatment tumor cell count. There is the other side of the circle which is the strategies that aim to alter the temps protonal properties. One way of doing that is by reprogramming the TAMS by shaping them to have entire properties instead of protonoral. This can be achieved in the clinic with CD48 agonist, for example, or CXF1R inhibitors.
00:21:12.544 - 00:22:09.705, Speaker B: In the model we simulate that with two different strategies. One way is by increasing the M2 to M1 repolarization rate. And another way is by decreasing the bias of the tumor microenvironment towards the M2 phenotype. And finally the other strategy is by enhancing the phagocytosis of the tumor cells by the tams. So tumor cells expressed on their surface don't IME signals, which prevents the TAMS from recognizing them as foreign bodies and from phagocytosis these cells. And so the aim of this strategy is to target to block these immune signals so that attempts can recognize and phagocytose the tumor cells. And so we introduced in our model a parameter that allows for the phagocytosis of glioblastoma cells by the anti trial macrophages.
00:22:09.705 - 00:23:11.299, Speaker B: All right, so again, the same heat map as earlier, but for these three strategies, one thing to see is that, well, in this case we're all in blue, so there's no increase in post treatment tumor cell count, which is good thing. And then if we look at the strategy 4 and 5 at first, so increasing the M2 M1 repolarization versus rate or versus increasing the bias towards the M1 phenotype, we've got a decrease that's about between 25 and 30%. So we have a decrease. Another interesting thing is we don't really see it, I think, but there's a 3% difference between if we introduce the nivolumab versus if we don't. So it's way more than what we had without the time targeting treatment. So it does increase a little bit the efficacy of nibble mamba, but it's still marginal. And finally, Interestingly is the third strategy which is enhancing the M1 phagocytic activity.
00:23:11.299 - 00:23:35.985, Speaker B: So here we're in dark blue. We've got a decrease of about 85% in post treatment tumor cell count with our average model. So this was promising at first. Well, and then we can go back and look at our heat map for the different metrics and I'm not sure if there's a question by Kathleen. Okay, there is a question.
00:23:36.145 - 00:23:54.111, Speaker A: If I interrupt you, is that. Okay, can you hear me talk? I don't know if we can hear you. We can't. Do you want to put it in the chat and I'll ask. Can you hear me now? We can't hear you.
00:23:54.223 - 00:23:54.583, Speaker B: Okay.
00:23:54.639 - 00:24:02.943, Speaker A: I'm assuming you're saying yes, so we'll just wait. You can't hear me. Okay. I mean, maybe Blanche, you can keep going and once it pops up.
00:24:03.039 - 00:24:31.885, Speaker B: All right, so if we look back at our metric for the strategy 4 and 5, we see a decrease in the M2 to M1 ratio, which is what was wanted with These strategies which results in an increase in these CD8 positive T cells that are activated by the tens. Now if we look at the third strategy, we don't see these effect on the M2 to M1 ratio but we see a high increase in. Yeah.
00:24:32.465 - 00:24:40.217, Speaker A: In case anyone can't read it and is Kathleen's just asking how is the parameter changed to explore the effect shown in the heat maps.
00:24:40.321 - 00:25:12.045, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So increase in the killing rate of the tumor cells. As for the question. All right, so we've got. I would need to go like to the end of the slides. So not sure if I can't like it'll be easier that way. Yeah.
00:25:12.045 - 00:25:44.193, Speaker B: So all of the parameters have an interval of definition, basically. So they're on one end of the interval. You've got the of treatment values. For example, if we look at releasing the phagocytosis of the cancer cell by the TAM. So these are the equations we've got lambda S3. And so when there's no treatment, lambda S3 is just equal to zero, which means that there's. That the cells cannot phagocytose any of the cancer cells versus when we simulate maximal efficacy, lambda S3 is equal to 1.
00:25:44.193 - 00:26:05.595, Speaker B: And so there's maximal phagocytosis of the cancer cells. So there's this interval of definition for each of the five time targeting specific parameters. And so we. Yeah, so we change the effect in the heat map by just going through this interval of definition. I think that answers.
00:26:10.775 - 00:26:15.395, Speaker A: If you increase the parameter more, will you see a bigger effect? Why did you set it to one?
00:26:16.815 - 00:26:55.455, Speaker B: I guess if we do increase it. Yes, we just set it to one because dmg, let's say is the phagocytosis rate of the tumor cells that we took. There's a lot of parameters. So I don't remember clearly where that one is from that we took from a study online. And so we consider that as a maximal phagocytosis rate of the tumor cells by the TAMS. So lambda S3 just maximally re enabling this rate of phagocytosis. But technically if we go over this maximal rate, I guess that yeah, there would be a bigger effect.
00:26:56.355 - 00:27:16.625, Speaker A: Can you hear me at all? Can you hear me at all? Talking but we can't hear you. Sorry. Well, we'll say yes. Okay, keep going. For the transition from M2 to M1. This is a known rate.
00:27:17.165 - 00:27:17.985, Speaker B: Yep.
00:27:18.325 - 00:27:20.173, Speaker A: But you are perturbing it.
00:27:20.349 - 00:27:41.305, Speaker B: Yes, why not? We could change it more. We set. We just had like two. So this is out. We just have to.
00:27:47.355 - 00:28:12.549, Speaker A: Kathleen, can you Say something now. Can you hear me? Now? Can you hear me? Hello? Sorry. She says just keep going.
00:28:12.597 - 00:28:54.865, Speaker B: Okay, perfect. Yeah, but for the people reprogramming of the tense for the repolarization, we just had like two set an interval of definition to try and like, see what's the impact. So, yeah, and so lambda is 5. For example, this parameter is a fraction, so it cannot go over 1, which is why it's set to 1. And 0 would be if all of the parameters take on the M2 or M1. I don't remember which one it is, but yeah. All right, so I'll just go back a few slides.
00:28:54.865 - 00:29:27.261, Speaker B: Yeah. All right. So I think I was here. Yes. And so the TAMT3 treatment, either way has a high impact on the increasing of the killing rate of the tumor cells versus the other two strategies that do increase the killing rate of the tumor cells, but at a lower rate. And we'll come back to that a bit later. And so we've talked about a lot from now about virtual clinical trial.
00:29:27.261 - 00:30:10.989, Speaker B: And so when we saw these results, what we wanted to do, well, what we ask ourselves is, well, how would these translate in a heterogeneous population? We set up a first virtual clinical trial for that. We all know virtual patients, simply a set of peer meters in our model. Now, I haven't talked about how we model tmz. In this model, we use a pub PK model that was established by Osterman et al, and they came up with distributions for the clearance rate, absorption rate, and the plasma to csf. So cerebral spinal fluid, the brain transfer rate. We include in our model these three distributions right there. And then we do a parameter sensitivity analysis, in fact a global sensitivity analysis with efas.
00:30:10.989 - 00:31:10.175, Speaker B: So EFAS gives us the first order sensitivity index, which is a fraction of the output variance that can be explained by the variation in the parameter p. And then we've got the total order sensitivity index, which is 1 minus the first order sensitivity index of all of the other parameters. And so we divided our parameters in to four categories. So we have the binding of the ici, which is in orange. We've got the innate immune system in blue, the adaptive immune system activity in red, and finally the intrinsic growth rate of the tumor in green. And so, interestingly, what we saw was that, well, you see this parameter Mu P, which is the binding of the ici. Well, the nivolumab efficacy is not sensitive to mu p, which is consistent with what we showed earlier, that the Nivlumab is not failing because of its mechanism of action failing, but because of other intratranoral mechanisms, which explains why the model is not sensitive to mup.
00:31:10.175 - 00:31:46.115, Speaker B: And now we have the growth rate that is important in both the tumor burden after the standard of care and the NIVL magnificency. We define a distribution for that. We have also the innate immune system activity which got the perimeter Q which is the bias of the tumor micron environment towards the M2 phenotype. That is the most sensitive, most significantly important parameter for both of these output. And finally, we also define a distribution for the antigenicity of tumor cells, since the hypothesis is made that higher. Yes.
00:31:50.175 - 00:31:54.555, Speaker C: So what do you mean by define a distribution for the growth rate? You explain this.
00:31:54.695 - 00:32:41.955, Speaker B: Yeah. So for the growth rate we took as well, these three distributions are log normal. We take as the mean the estimated perimeter in our average model. And then we define the standard deviation for the growth rate in order to have 95% of the patients that are between minus and plus one months without treatment. And we do similarly for all of these, all of the other parameters, but with different criteria. All right. And so we define distributions for these three parameters, as I said, and we take the distribution from Aserman et al, and we generate 900 virtual patients with these.
00:32:41.955 - 00:33:44.067, Speaker B: And so at first what we do is we reproduce the clinical trial involving inivolumab and the standard of care. And so in the middle right there, you've got the Kaplan Meier curve. So for these two treatments, and so again, they're pretty much the same. So we're able again to reproduce the failure in the clinic that was observed with nivolumab. Now, what's interesting is when we divide the Kaplan Meyer curves, but according to the perimeter values and most interestingly with beta, which is intrinsic growth rate of the tumor, so we see that of course, patients with a lower growth rate really have a higher survival than patients with a higher growth rate. This tells us that this rapid growth and the aggressivity of this tumor is important in the survival of the tumor. And that is why a treatment such as STAM T3, which has a high impact on the killing rate of the tumor cells, is more effective because it directly targets this rapid growth and this aggressivity.
00:33:44.067 - 00:35:08.737, Speaker B: And why it's important with this tumor to establish such a treatment that will have a direct effect instead of a treatment such as Tamti 4 or Tamti 5 that are still like, they still have a decrease of about 25%, but due to the rapid growth, it doesn't have as much an impact on survival. All right, and so if we go back to this enhancements of N1 phytocytic activity in with our visual clinical trial, we just modified this timeline right here to introduce the phagocytosis of tumor cells at first at constant maximal efficacy. So from the start of the treatment to the end of the treatment. And so this is what we observe again, no change between whether there's ICI or not or no ici. So this is also a good thing because it tells us that maybe this treatment, this immunotherapy on its own, with the standard of care, would make the ICI unnecessary, which would limit the adverse effects. Then when we look at the Kaplan Meyer curve, so in green, we have with the Tamti 3 versus in black, where we don't have the enhancements of phagocytosis, we see that TAMTI3 does increase significantly the survival versus its treatment if it's not administered. And so we still have a decrease in the patients between minus 70% or minus 90%.
00:35:08.737 - 00:35:59.935, Speaker B: So there's still like a 20% difference. And so our goal afterwards was to identify what could distinguish the best responders from the worst responders in this context. And so for that, we define what we call the growth independent efficacy, which is basically, well, the absolute value of the percent change. So the decrease divided by the growth of this tumor for this patient without any treatment. Then we look at the histograms for the worst responders in red and the best responders. The worst responders are defined as the 25% of patients with the smallest decreases versus the best 25% with the largest decreases. I'm only showing the plots for these three parameters since the plots for, well, the distributions for the TMZ for macrokinetics were not shown to be significantly different between the two groups.
00:35:59.935 - 00:37:05.795, Speaker B: The distributions between the two groups for these three parameters were all shown to be significantly different. We can see that patients in the best responder group tend to have a higher antigenicity of tumor cells as well as a higher intrinsic growth rate, which again correlates with the fact that this treatment directly targets the growth of the tumors of the tumor. Finally, while we do see a clear distinction between the worst responders and the best responders, when we look at the bias towards the M2 phenotype, to clearly distinguish the parameters that. Well, to clearly identify, sorry, the parameters that distinguish the best from the worst responders, since there's a lot of overlap, we added an effect measure with the overlapping index. So this was taken by Pastore and Kiao Changi it's an index that is normalized between 0 and 1, so 0 being non overlapped distributions versus 1 identical distributions. So it's basically how much of the distributions overlap. And so we set 0.5
00:37:05.795 - 00:37:59.639, Speaker B: as a threshold, meaning that if the distribution were shown to have a significant P value and if they had an overlapping index smaller than 0.5, we took their parameter as we considered it as a parameter that distinguishes the best from the worst responders. In this case only the tumor microenvironment bias where Zim2 phenotype was shown to well have an overlap index small beds5 and so to distinguish the best from the worst responders. And so to test that even more, we generated two new cohort of virtual patients. In this case one that is M1 biased. So one that has a bias well that has a fraction of tumor associated macrophages that gets the M1 phenotype smaller, the M1 so higher than 0.5 versus the M2 bias which is smaller, that's 0.5.
00:37:59.639 - 00:39:16.035, Speaker B: What we see is that the M1 bias has a survival that is clearly longer than the M2 bias population. And also interestingly, we see a difference with anivolumab efficacy in the M1 bias population versus no difference in the N2 bias population. If we go back here with our previous 900 virtual patients and their temp T3 efficacy, again temp 3 is for the phagocytosis activity of the M1 TAMS. Our question is can we take these worst responders and increase their efficacy by targeting their M2 to M1 ratio? And so to do so we have our worst responders always in red and best responders always in blue. And so we introduce in the worst responders the TAMT4 treatment which is decreasing the bias towards the M2 phenotype. What you see on the top row is the M2 M1 ratio after treatment versus on the bottom row which is the efficacy. So the percent change in the glioblastoma cell count after treatment we see that worst responders versus best responders they have a significantly different percent change in glass cell count after treatment, which is the temp T3 treatment.
00:39:16.035 - 00:40:22.891, Speaker B: So to be expected, of course. And then when we have a worse responders and when we add in this treatment that directly targets on top ratio, we have a decrease that's actually small, a decrease that's actually higher than the decrease of the best responders. And we have a ratio that is a decrease in their ratio after treatment for these combination. And so this Means basically that patients with a really high M2 M1 ratio might also benefit from a combination of treatment that would target not only the enhancements of their M1 like times phagocytosis, but also their M2 to M1 ratio. All right, so if we go back here, as I said, what we've done up till now is to simulate a constant treatment efficacy. So lambda3, as I've shown earlier in this equation, is set to zero before the first temosolamide dose and after the first temosolamide. Now of course, pretty sure we've all seen a graph like that.
00:40:22.891 - 00:41:08.595, Speaker B: So when a drug is administered, it goes through adme. So absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Of course its concentration in the body will fluctuate with time, will decrease with time, and so will its efficacy. Simulating a constant treatment efficacy is not really realistic in the clinic. To look more at its theoretical significant potential in the clinic, we simulate a treatment efficacy that decays with time with a maximal efficacy of 100%. We choose a half life of about 13 days, which is the half life of a molecule that's under clinical investigation and that targets the CD47 mist signal. We can look at different administration scenarios.
00:41:08.595 - 00:42:10.205, Speaker B: We have either every week in green or every two weeks in orange. And either way we have this undetectable region right there. What we see is that if we administer this scenario every, if we have this administration every week or every two weeks, we've got a cancer that is below the detectable threshold at the end of treatment. However, about 11 months after the diagnosis, all of the tumor have grown back to a detectable size. Another advantage of using a mathematical model is that, well, you can simulate a treatment that ends pretty much whenever you want. What we did afterwards is what if we have the chemotherapy that ends when it should, but we've got the time targeting treatment that goes on for about a year after the chemotherapy. Well, when we do that, either with the every week or every two week administration scenario, we have a tumor that stabilizes above the detectable threshold, but still below a quarter of the lethality threshold.
00:42:10.205 - 00:43:38.397, Speaker B: And so this led us to make the hypothesis that while enhancing the phagocytosis activity of the antitrum modal times could have a significant potential in the clinic. And so some key take home messages before getting into the future work is that in other words, our mathematical framework showed that a lack of CD8 positive T cell recruitment could drive the entire PD1 so nivalumab clinical trial failures. We also showed that Low levels of CD8 positive T cell recruitment were due to tumor microenvironment that was highly biased were protumoral phenotype and while reducing the number of TANs, did not increase the level of CD8 positive T cell recruitment or impact significant treatment efficacy. Reprogramming the protumoral TAMS did increase the recruitment nivolumab efficacy marginally, but still and overall survival and due to the intrinsic aggressivity and rapid growth of a glioblastoma, enhancing the phagocytosis of glioblastoma cells by antitramoral tams would be theoretically the most promising TAM targeting treatment. But still, overall, all of the strategies that were shown to be effective were those that were targeting directly the protonoral phenotype of the tamps. Now, as I've said a few times, this study was theoretical. But of course what our next goal is is to actually combine that with data, which is pretty much everyone's goal.
00:43:38.397 - 00:44:57.185, Speaker B: So we've got collaborators at a university in Montreal with who we're working to actually do some experimental validation of this model. So our next goal we're actually they're setting up the experiments right now to look at the combination of chemotherapy and attempt targeting treatments. And so our next goal is to adapt this model so that it fits their data, reprimetrize it of course to the murine data and finally study this combination of treatment and hopefully optimize the combination treatment regimens. Other thing I haven't mentioned is that well, this is an OD model. So one of its limitations is that it does not take into account any spatial characteristic of the tumor. What we want to do is build an agent based model to study these stem targeting treatments in the context of a spatial tumor, well, in a spatial model and hopefully combine our ODE model in this optimized model right here with this abm. And so this brings me to say a few words about an article that we published this year that showed that agent based the accuracy of an agent based model predictions dependent on Stella at initialization.
00:44:57.185 - 00:45:50.525, Speaker B: So again our collaborators also at McGill University, what they did is that they provided us IMC data, so data from imaging massetometry from patients, so from patient biopsy. And so this quantified the tumor microenvironment of these patients. And so we were able to see well where were these cells, but also what are the proportions in these biopsy of every cell type. And so we did so for about over 140 patients. And then we ranked the patients according to the proportions of adaptive immune cells. So CD4 positive and CD8 positive T cells. And we picked the three patients with the lowest proportions of adaptive immune cells as those with the weakest adaptive immune responses and the three patients with the largest adaptive immune proportions and those with the strongest adaptive immune response.
00:45:50.525 - 00:46:31.689, Speaker B: And we simulated on these patients different treatment scenarios that combine oncotec virus chemotherapy as well as nivolumab. So in type one. And what we saw, surprisingly, I haven't put that on the slide, was that, well, we had a larger response in the weakest adaptive immune patient versus the strongest adaptive immune, which is, well, pretty much contradicts what we know. And so we looked at the total initial cell count in all of these patients. And what we saw was that all of these patients, their IMC data comes from biopsy. And so it's really like a subset of a tumor. And so the cell count that they provided us with is below 5,000.
00:46:31.689 - 00:47:35.465, Speaker B: So it's like there are not a lot of cells. And so we asked ourselves, what if we keep the same, same cell distributions but increase the cell count? And so this is what we did. We generated two virtual patients, so one representative of a weak adaptive immune response versus one representative of a strong adaptive immune response. And we generated for these two virtual patients 10,000 cells. And when we did so, we were able to recreate the intrature model accurately, the intramural mechanisms that define defined by the adaptive immune responses. And so we had a strong adaptive immune response patient that responded more to treatments. But the question that remains for the combination of the ABM with the ODE model is that here we generated virtual patients with cell distributions that were representative of the data that we had, but we lost all of the spatial characteristic of the data, which is what is interesting from such a data set.
00:47:35.465 - 00:48:15.965, Speaker B: So what we want to do now is find a way to actually recreate this, well, reproduce this generation of virtual patients from spatial data, but by maintaining not only the cell distribution, but also the cell characteristics, such as where are the CD8T cells compared to the tumor cells, for example. So this is last part of our future work, hopefully. And so I think I spoke fast. I want to thank, of course, all of the lab members. Morgan, my supervisor, Adrian Jenner, that worked with us on and as well as our collaborators at McGill University.
00:48:25.025 - 00:48:51.743, Speaker D: Thank you for. It was a very lovely talk and lots of food for thought. But I was. One of my questions was actually on this last part of the abm, you said that changing the initial send count affects your responses. When you say cell counts is like, you mean cell density like are you keeping the size of your simulated grid the same and you're decreasing the dense like.
00:48:51.839 - 00:48:57.463, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what you mean. No, we mean really the cell count and address this cell.
00:48:57.479 - 00:48:59.487, Speaker D: So you're increasing the size of the.
00:48:59.511 - 00:49:09.755, Speaker B: Domain is increased a bit. The density is not kept one exactly the same, but it's close to the density of the virtual patients.
00:49:10.115 - 00:49:31.779, Speaker D: So you have an intuition of why the CD is effect. Because I would expect maybe a low density. You have the dynamics, proliferative dynamics of the system is kind of getting rid of your initial condition or. But in this like I'm not sure what, what's driving this dependence on the number of cells. If you have any insight, it might be.
00:49:31.867 - 00:49:56.235, Speaker B: I'm not. I'm not sure exactly what I think. It's just might be how these like. Because if you really don't have a lot of CD8 positive T cells, even if, I guess, even if the density just account like if you trying to think of an intuition.
00:49:58.175 - 00:50:03.443, Speaker D: Like you know, maybe the initial number of cells is something we don't care initially, but then it matters a lot in terms of.
00:50:03.499 - 00:50:30.165, Speaker B: I think at a certain point like the density matters also. But I think what is also important is that you still need to have like you need to have more than 3 CD8 positive T cells in your model. And if your proportion is like 0.2% and you end up with 3 CD8 positive T cell like it's not going to have any effect versus if so you need to have a certain like number of cell counts so that this 0.2 proportion does not result in three cells.
00:50:30.285 - 00:50:35.625, Speaker D: And then my other question, what kind of boundary condition are you using in the abm?
00:50:36.445 - 00:50:45.625, Speaker B: This is a good question. The answer is in the paper. But I don't remember like firsthand because this was established from previous.
00:50:46.405 - 00:50:50.885, Speaker D: Because maybe if you're periodic in some way you get. Yeah, you're actually simulating it.
