00:00:00.880 - 00:00:26.020, Speaker A: And so down university to give us the next talk. Right? You can get started now, buddy. Okay. Okay. So hello everybody. Now I go back here. So I hope I will have no problem to for my presentation for John that I know from a long time ago.
00:00:26.020 - 00:01:16.280, Speaker A: And because I am in Italy at the moment, in a hotel and the connection is bad. So if it stops, it's not my fault. Okay? So the work I will present today is something we began sometimes ago with Institut Curie, who is a famous institute for cancer research and who has a very good hospital, which is close to my lab, very close to my lab. And we focus about immunology and cancer. And what I present is simply. It's simply the interplay between T cell, fibroblast and cancer cell. It's limited to that because we have data for that.
00:01:16.280 - 00:02:04.210, Speaker A: Okay, So I think, okay, for you who are specialists of cancer and specialization, perhaps it is appropriate for him. I don't know. Okay, So I go. So as I tell you, since four years we have this collaboration with the people of Curie. And especially the people concerned by the lung tumors. And it's the biologist come are in by immunology lab. And so my presentation concerned primary solid tumor of the lung.
00:02:04.210 - 00:02:47.458, Speaker A: And I immediately gave you the all the cell I consider, because there is plenty of cell, of course, each time, plenty of bad cell each time. And so the cell can be macrophages, but not in this talk. T cell and B cell, which are cell of the immune system. But for this talk it will be T cell mostly and of course cancer cell. And eventually and also healthy cell. And you have all the chemical signaling. So we have a special focus of a non carcinoma, which is called.
00:02:47.458 - 00:03:34.176, Speaker A: You have this name it. The first letters are for non small cancerous lung carcinoma, I think. And in this case what we need is we can restrict on fibroblast for at least for the moment. This is the only things we can do because we do not have data for macrophages, T cells and cancer cell. So this work has been done mostly by a PhD student. Now he's a postdoc in a neighbor lab, Joseph Ackerman. And with a group of Napoli in Italy, Chiara Bernard and Massimiliano Fraldi.
00:03:34.176 - 00:04:25.340, Speaker A: And for the biologist Philemon Sirven and Helene Salmon. So as I say, I focused on the most active cell for this problem. And so what we need to sum up. To sum up the things you have cancer cell, which proliferates, which are eliminated by the T cell, at least is the hope that the T cells succeed to eliminate the cancer cell. But you have also inverse trauma fibroblast. Fibroblasts, which are here because, you know, in stroma you have fibroblast. And.
00:04:25.340 - 00:05:17.174, Speaker A: But because we are close to tumor, they are transformed into what we call as activated fibroblasts. It means that they change their property property in proliferation. And of course, property concerning the T cell. And they are called also and best T cell, of course, are attracted to the cancer cell. But they are inhibited in several ways chemically. And they can stop in the bad cases by the fibroblast. So this is the things we have to treat together, to couple together.
00:05:17.174 - 00:06:15.220, Speaker A: And of course, the chemical signaling. So there is a typical picture in immunology where it's possible to classify the tumor, the solid tumor and into immune dessert. Immune dessert means that our immune system is completely inefficient, Immune excluded. So it means that the immune system react to the presence of a tumor and try to do the job he has to do. But excluded from the interior of the tumor. Add odd tumors, which is the beta case. Because you have T cell inside the tumor and some up for treatment.
00:06:15.220 - 00:07:25.262, Speaker A: And this picture is also very important for the immunology treatment. In the sense that somebody was an immune tumor, you know, will be more sensitive to. To the car T, for example, immunology. Okay, so if we consider all the cell we have to consider and we write simply a dynamical system. And I think it's important to begin with a dynamical system in order to see the parameters which are important for the following. If you consider these parameters, you begin by an ordinary nonlinear equation for the cancer cell, for example, very simple. And you say, okay, the cancer cell, Their role is to proliferate in the first time.
00:07:25.262 - 00:08:05.950, Speaker A: And after they saturate, they saturate for another reason is that the quantity I consider is a den. So it means I consider not the number of cancer cell, but the ratio between the volume of cancer cell and the total volume of my space. And of course, this ratio is smaller than one. So we have to say there is a natural saturation that you can understand as a pressure eventually, if you want. So you have a parameter which is delta in the first equation. In the first equation. In this equation, I don't know if you see, when I do that.
00:08:05.950 - 00:08:37.382, Speaker A: Yes, you see, okay, immediately there is one parameter. And you can, okay, say, okay, I limit the number of parameters. So I can choose my unit of time, which is the proliferation rate for the new volume, which is not exactly the Proliferation rate of this. Of the cancer cell. Hopefully for us. But it's something. But it's a unit of time that you can choose.
00:08:37.382 - 00:08:53.494, Speaker A: You can choose. So there is one parameter which is eliminated. Which is present, but eliminated because it. It's our scale of time. And this is quite the only one for them. And after. After you have the T cell.
00:08:53.494 - 00:09:10.036, Speaker A: And this is what I say. The T cell are attracted. The second equation which is here. Are attracted by the cancer cell. Because we are made in. They are. They originate from the thymus.
00:09:10.036 - 00:09:28.160, Speaker A: Thymus? Thymus. I don't know. The thymus. And the thymus is not. It's not at the level of the lung. It's something elsewhere. And so we are attracted because there is an inflammation place sit.
00:09:28.160 - 00:09:59.750, Speaker A: So they are attracted by the cancer cell. And also they disappear. They are limited naturally. But now the pressure is met with the cancer and the T cell. And if you look to the first equation. Now the cancer cell are attacked in the good case by the T cell. So now you have three coefficients only for that.
00:09:59.750 - 00:10:26.290, Speaker A: And two coefficients which will be rather important for the situation. Which is this one and this one. So these two delta, if you want. These two delta are especially important in the following. And you have what happens with the fibroblast. So sorry. What I have done.
00:10:26.290 - 00:10:48.008, Speaker A: Sorry. I am very sorry. So the fibroblast. So the fibroblast, as we say before, the fibroblast. Now they make two family of fibroblasts. The fibroblasts, which are in. In situ in your.
00:10:48.008 - 00:11:09.260, Speaker A: If you want. And this is the non activated fibroblast. So they are here a priori. They. Their number increase because of the cancer cell. Because cancer cell may transform cells. So they are transformed by the cancer cell.
00:11:09.260 - 00:11:44.250, Speaker A: They disappear because they are transformated into cafe more associated fibroblast. And after you have the same quantity, the same delta. But this function has become more important. So as soon as you introduce new participants, you have more coefficients. And when we study all the coefficients, we arrive to a number which is 11 and 11. It means that you can do what you want. You obtain what you want with 11 coefficients when they are not known.
00:11:44.250 - 00:12:42.518, Speaker A: But in fact we realize that there are very two important coefficients. Which is the delta, which represent the pressure which limit the growth of all these quantities. And epsilon, which is the ratio between delta and the coefficient of the death of a cancer cell due to the T cell only. And depending epsilon this epsilon and delta. In fact, you succeed to represent all the scenario for immunology that I Have represented at the beginning. And in particular we analyze a little bit. We were happy to have this picture of tumor of lung given by Institute Curie.
00:12:42.518 - 00:13:22.348, Speaker A: So it's the case of two patients. And if you look at the tumor, the tumor site are in gray for the two patients. So it's very far from the disc in 2D of a growing tumor. As you see, because the tumor has a little bit distorted. So it is like this. It's bad news for us. And if you look present now, where are the T cell for this patient? They are here, so they are not in the tumor.
00:13:22.348 - 00:14:06.376, Speaker A: So this patient has attract obviously T cell, but they do not penetrate the tumor. And here they put another signaling in order to visualize the fibroblast. And the fibroblasts are in red. And the fibroblast are, as I mentioned before, mostly located outside the tumor, not inside. And I don't know if we do a protection of the tumor, but probably this is their role. And it is a bad role for the patient. And also you have over cell which.
00:14:06.376 - 00:14:44.818, Speaker A: But a small number of cells. And if you look at the second patient, which is below, you see that in the tumor, which is here, the tumor is. Hopefully we have a drawing to understand what happens. Because it's so for people who are not specialists of. Of figures is difficult. But you see you have a black, black zone inside the tumor. And I ask if they can say, tell me if it is the necrosis, the tumor necrosis or not.
00:14:44.818 - 00:15:35.496, Speaker A: And they say, and they say, because they take caution. And they say, perhaps, perhaps, but it's probably because it is the place where you have plenty of T cell inside the tumor. Plenty of T cell. Here again are the fibroblasts. So you have two patients which are in two different situation, which correspond mostly to the scheme of the big evening. At least you have a reaction of immune system, but which is not enough. So now it is true that what it is important is to treat the space because it's our system.
00:15:35.496 - 00:16:18.676, Speaker A: As okay, we analyze the system. But for many people now they may think that it is okay, we do better now for the system. But we want something simple. And now we have the space equation. So this is really inspired also from. I want to say from the paper by John and the review paper, yes, written okay 15 years ago about modeling the model of tumor. And okay, so the first equation is the concentration of cells.
00:16:18.676 - 00:16:52.490, Speaker A: I so cancer cell, fibroblast and so on. And here, the right hand side of this first equation is. Is the equation the coefficient exactly of the dynamical system. So it's easy, but it is written. It's a linear system. So it's easy to write to. And you have such equation for the growth of a species.
00:16:52.490 - 00:17:32.010, Speaker A: For example concept cell and. But velocity. And for all the nutrients, neutrons, canyon signaling and so on. It's easy because it's a diffusion equation. It's a diffusion equation with. With a term for which express attraction of this chemical bio species and the deaths the uptake. But the main problem is how to find the velocity and the velocity itself.
00:17:32.010 - 00:18:05.044, Speaker A: So it's more. This is the difficult point is to find the velocity of the species. And for that we use the relation method equivalent to. Equivalent to the other dynamical equation. I'm sorry, really sorry. Okay. And the.
00:18:05.044 - 00:18:32.970, Speaker A: So the relation means simply that the velocity we must found make extremal the dissipation. So the difficulty paper to calculate. So it's allowed to obtain very more easily. I will say the velocity. In fact, I prefer this method. This method is due to Londrellet. His name was truth when he was not a lot.
00:18:32.970 - 00:18:57.190, Speaker A: But after he becomes Landrele. And this is a very old publication. But anyway, if you use the relation like we use like the Amiston equation and so on. It simplify a little bit the formalism. And formalism. I say it is safe. It means that you know where to put the phi and okay.
00:18:57.190 - 00:19:48.300, Speaker A: And after you have the dissipation. So and we take a fluid friction either stoke, either Darcy. Darcy is probably more appropriate. But okay, you have both possibility. And we add an energy interfacial energy between phases. So it remains the interaction between cells. In our case, we have chosen the flow energy which takes into account the diffusion of the coefficient of a species and the interaction between cell cell interaction.
00:19:48.300 - 00:20:23.290, Speaker A: More specifically, and to limit also AV calculation we take interaction between cancer cell. Because of course cancer cell attract each other. Since we make an aggregate or a tumor. I have forgotten to say that in the lung you have really nest. So it means high concentration of cancer cell localized in a space. Localized in a space it's really nest. So with a percentage around 90%.
00:20:23.290 - 00:20:57.576, Speaker A: So it's a huge percentage. And the T cell attracted by the C. This is what I say. This coefficient. And finally the fibroblast and the cancer cell. So this is all attractive term and only limited to the most active cell dissipation is ordinary. It means stokes flow for that.
00:20:57.576 - 00:21:30.716, Speaker A: Or Darcy flow for that with a concentration here. So now I will give you simply. I will give example of simulation. So as you have seen in the first. In the first slide, the nest. The two nests can be rather close to each other. And we ask the following question.
00:21:30.716 - 00:22:11.752, Speaker A: It's a simple geometry. If we can have a collapse of the tumor, the two tumor seeds can be joined together to make a big tumor. And of course, it depends of our parameters. It's not always true. Sometimes, and it depends if we have a good inflammation of a tumor. In this case, the nest disappear before the collapse, or if you have an intermediate situation. And because we have a strange geometry for the tumor, we try to mimic the geometry.
00:22:11.752 - 00:22:51.760, Speaker A: But there is work to continue on that, because this paper is under review and it's one of the question of the referee why we limit ourselves to circular tumor. And we are not. But okay, circular, of course. So I continue. I have another slide before this, but obviously. Voila. So, to sum up.
00:22:51.760 - 00:23:26.496, Speaker A: So I think for this work, okay, we have to. To improve the representation of tortuous tumor. And we will succeed for sure. Now the next step is of course to understand the macrophages. And you know, the macrophages, they are like their role, you know, they are. You have always macrofishes in your tissue. It's like the policeman in the city, you know, you have always.
00:23:26.496 - 00:24:11.190, Speaker A: And they are ready to attack eventually and to see. Anyway, we have information, in vitro information about how they are attracted by the cells and so on. And this is our next step. And finally, this is our paper concerning that. What I want to say is that my presentation is quite accepted in Elife at the moment. So finally, I would like to say to Jean, Happy birthday. Unfortunately, I cannot be in Canada, because I have another celebration in Italy.
00:24:11.190 - 00:24:28.260, Speaker A: And Italy is a little bit less expensive and complicated to go, but. Okay. I would like to see him really. And I hope to see him in the next future. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you.
