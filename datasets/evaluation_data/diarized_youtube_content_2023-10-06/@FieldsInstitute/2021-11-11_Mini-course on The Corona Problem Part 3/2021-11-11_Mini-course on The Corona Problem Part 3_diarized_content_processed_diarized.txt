00:00:00.240 - 00:00:07.790, Speaker A: My great pleasure to introduce our first speaker of the day, Alexander Brudni from University of Calgary, who will continue his mini course.
00:00:07.902 - 00:01:03.354, Speaker B: Please. Okay, so last time I stopped at the point where I was just telling you the serum of Fernando Daniel Suarez did the set of trivial glissant parts, which is denoted as MS, is totally disconnected. So just remind you that we have just two types of parts. One parts are analytic disks, and this set is just open, dense, and has even some analytic structure that I explained last time. And this one is just like a singular set, because we will prove that it is totally disconnected. And this means in some sense, it looks like the set of isolated points. In some sense, of course.
00:01:03.354 - 00:01:55.774, Speaker B: So I just remind you of the following definition. The space X capital is totally disconnected if any subset of x containing more than two points is disconnected. So for compact, housed or spaces, totally disconnected is equivalent to the fact that the covering dimension of the space is zero. And this one is just the definition. The governing dimension of x is zero if and only the space has the base of compact and open neighborhoods at each point. Okay, so I will not give you all details, because it's still quite technical. I'll just show you that it is really very simple, and still it requires only the basic Curlisson construction.
00:01:55.774 - 00:02:53.474, Speaker B: And that's it. So by sxgac we will denote the open level sublevel set of the function g. And what we will do, we will do the full length. So, let us take any point from the set of trivial glycemic parts, then take some function f such that the Griffon transform of this function equals zero, this point x, and maybe just of normal one. The function. Then the first lemma says that if we'll just fix any c more than zero, then inside of the sublevel set of f with the head sublevel circuit. So there is some close and open subset c containing x.
00:02:53.474 - 00:03:42.902, Speaker B: So the proof is just here, just a technical proof, but I explain you how it works. We use the proof of the corona theorem. Namely, we use the construction. We'll take the correspond here such that correson contour will just separate the set of small values from the set of larger values. So small values will be epsilon, for instance, and larger values will be delta. Now, the correspond is a correspondence that I just introduced in my first lecture. In particular, it has an epsilon chain, which is an interpolating set.
00:03:42.902 - 00:04:30.183, Speaker B: And in particular, from here it follows that the closure of the whole curl contour in the maximal ideal space of h infinity belongs to the set of all non trivial grissom parts. So it will not touch any set of trivial glisten parts. And this is the main, I believe this is the general measure property of h infinity, which allows to prove such nice results for the maximal dual space, but actually just separating. And therefore we have just two parts. One part will be inserted of epsilon and another part will be outside of delta. Okay, and then what we'll do, sorry. Oops.
00:04:30.183 - 00:05:25.882, Speaker B: It's so we'll just simply consider, for instance, the function characteristic function of the set where our function f is less than epsilon. So then it will be just, or vice versa. So when it is just less than epsilon, the our function will be zero and outside the corresponding function will be one. Now this theorem that I proved about solution of the bar equations, allows to extend this function, which has only two values, zero and one, to the maximal ideal space. Okay, now this extension will be zero in here. So inside of the contour, where just instead of c, it will be epsilon. So epsilon will be less than c here.
00:05:25.882 - 00:06:08.096, Speaker B: So this extension equals zero in here. And by the definition, because outside of the set where function of modulus of function models and delta, it is one. So therefore, outside of sublevel set of delta of the function, it will be one. And that's it. Because you see here, just one side of this sublevel set, our set c, it's the set where our function less than epsilon and it is clopping because it is zero and one will be just outside of c. So we just take delta in such a way. And that's it.
00:06:08.096 - 00:07:14.368, Speaker B: So this is just the proof, which is much shorter, maybe not too much simpler, but actually then original proof of source. But actually it uses only the basic construction of Curlison. This is the only sense that you need. So at least will be maximum two pages instead of, I don't know, 13 pages in the Suarez paper. Okay, so from here it follows that the set of trivial gas parse mass is totally disconnected. Why? Because by the definition of the Gelfand topology, each point x in a mass has the open neighborhood of the form intersection of sublevel sets of finitely many functions. For any such subset inside, we will find clop and subset which contains our point x, and therefore intersection of finitely many clop and subsets.
00:07:14.368 - 00:08:54.094, Speaker B: Of course, they just close and open together. And this will be just inside of this basic neighborhood of x. And so this says that MS will allow the base of topology consisting of closed and open sets. And this is just the same to tell that covering dimension is zero and so it is just totally disconnected. So when we will need it, you will need it just to not in such situation where we don't want to work with a set of planes in mas, because it just very complicated structure and we don't know how to make an analysis. And therefore using just totally disconnectedness of Ms, we obtain the following technical lemma, which is the most important part here. So if we'll just take any open cover of the maximal dual space mh infinity open finite cover, then inside of this cover I can find a refinement and a continuous partition of unity ROI subordinate to this refinement such that for the refinement we have the following so all possible non empty intersection vi and vg will be the relatively compact subsets of the good part of the maximal real space of the part of analytic disks.
00:08:54.094 - 00:09:49.904, Speaker B: Okay, this is the main point. Moreover, if I restrict every function from our partition of unity to the unit disk back, then it will be c infinity function and differential. This function will be of the following form where here gi and hi will be uniformly continuous with respect to pseudo hyperbolic metric row, say infinity functions. So what is good for that, for such kind of functions, for all these coefficients we know how to solve the bar equation. This was just the statement of the fossil equation. Therefore we can solve everything which involves bounded functions and derivatives of the partition of unity. Ok, so let us just consider some example.
00:09:49.904 - 00:10:31.004, Speaker B: So here just we will consider the following algebra. So suppose that a capital is also unital. Banach algebra. Yeah, so commutative as well, complex unit. So h infinity da will be just the Banach algebra of allomorphic bounded functions from the unit disk into a capital with the obvious norm. And then we prove the following theorem. So this theorem says that just in order to solve the Bezel equation.
00:10:31.004 - 00:11:56.404, Speaker B: No, sorry, this is just about the ideals just more general result. So suppose that we have a finite open cover of the maximal real space such that for any index of the COVID the restriction of the function our function here, just one of the functions to the intersection of UgA with belongs to some ideal ij generated by restrictions of functions f one fm. Okay, then f squared belongs to the ideal global ideal generated by f one fm in h infinity a. So this is just kind of a standard statement of multi dimensional complex analysis, because in the multi dimensional complex analysis we are working with analytic sets. Analytic sets has some nice geometric structure locally in. Therefore actually mostly in many not very complicated cases, we can just solve locally the problem of the ideal problem for function f. But then we can glue that in multidimensional complex analysis using partition unity, and then reduce everything using complex to debar equations.
00:11:56.404 - 00:13:04.794, Speaker B: In particular, it is true, if we are working on Stein spaces here, it is not Stein, and we have some bad situation with singular set MS. But still, if you know somehow how to solve locally the problem, the ideal problem, then the theorem states that we can solve it globally, but unfortunately only for f squared. Why it is f squared? This is just, I believe it is optimal. First of all, according to the result of Rao, which was mentioned yesterday by Bretwick in his lecture. But this is just the technical efficiency which is given by the Kasul complex. Okay, how to prove it? So, we need just to glue together somehow all these local solutions. So, according to the definition, we know that locally on the intersection.
00:13:04.794 - 00:13:54.406, Speaker B: Yeah. First of all, from our original cover, you'll go to the partition, we satisfy the condition of the lemma. In particular, what is important here, that the intersection vg and vi will be inside of the set of analytic disks in the analytical part of the maximal real space. And we will take the partition of unity from this lemma. So, according to the hypothesis of this theorem, we can find a family of functions locally here which solve the ideal problem. So this means that we have this equation in each VGA intersection with D. And then we'll just do the standard thing.
00:13:54.406 - 00:14:46.990, Speaker B: So we'll just define the cocycle for each I, it will be kcl. On the intersection we are using versus and d. So it is non empty. And then we will just glue together this cycle using the partition of unity, and we obtain some function ha r. So, sum here, of course, will be taken only over all s, for which this intersection is non empty. Now, by the definition, of course, these are just bounded functions, and they belong to c infinity, because in the disk, of course, because the partition of unity was just c infinity. Okay, so, and then finally, we'll just define.
00:14:46.990 - 00:15:23.856, Speaker B: So then from this definition, this is just resolution of the catheter. So we have hir minus his equals cirs, this kind of standard. So just very standard algebraic technique. And so we'll just define hi as difference gir and minus this resolution. And now, so this new function will be just bounded everywhere and c infinity. So in particular. But this is just with values in the algebra.
00:15:23.856 - 00:16:02.528, Speaker B: Yeah. So in particular, if I'll take the bar of h I, so it will be c infinity, value zero, one form. But you see, when I just differentiated the bar, I'm taking just derivatives of this, of rho. For rho, we know that they have very nice derivatives. And in particular, these derivatives will be also form hi divided by one minus modulus z squared. Hi will be exactly our function with support in w. What is w? W is just the union of all non empty intersections with the disk.
00:16:02.528 - 00:16:50.904, Speaker B: Yeah, because when I differentiate, I actually differentiate all these functions. And therefore I need just to take the union of supports of all and then it will be support of this or derivative of this. So therefore this function will be just the function of the required class. For this function, we know how to solve this equation. It was just in my first and second lectures. And therefore, moreover, the construction was given in such a way that actually we express f using this hi. So hi times fi equals I from one to m.
00:16:50.904 - 00:17:40.094, Speaker B: But unfortunately, ha are not allomorphic, so we need just to change it so that they would be callomorphic. And here, where we will use the Kosul complex, I will not give you the detailed construction. You can read it just in garner for instance, but here how we'll do it. So we'll just change slightly our function gi in this following way. So write if plus some function a is fs s from one to m. So AI's is just a formal matrix, and this square matrix m times n. And we will assume for this square metric that it is.
00:17:40.094 - 00:18:40.194, Speaker B: How do you spell for good anti symmetric, right? So just put it will just take the transpose, then it will be negative this matrix. So namely, we'll present each AIs as bis minus Bsi. And this required bis and BSI will be given by the following solutions of the following equations. Okay, when we'll do everything like that, then it's easy to check that if you can solve this equation 17. Then this new GI will be holomorphic function with values in a capital. So here just the population simple calculation. So you see here I have extra f, unfortunately, and this is why it will be f squared.
00:18:40.194 - 00:19:26.852, Speaker B: So this is just computation. And so, just to, and this will imply, so if you can solve this equation 17. This will imply actually that f squared belongs to the ideal h infinity, aka. Now to complete the proof it remains to solve bounded solutions of these equations. But just note that because we are taking derivative of partition of unity, so it will be of the following form. Hi times d bar hs will be this. This adjusts bound with nice function.
00:19:26.852 - 00:20:30.324, Speaker B: This is just also uniformly continuous infinity with values in the algebra a. So anyway, this coefficient belongs to what we know how to solve. And therefore, according to theorem one, we can solve this equation, we obtain bounded solutions and therefore we can prove this theorem so, and that's it. So the second part was just, you see, just garnet. So because it's only the casual complex here, nothing else. Okay, so just as a some corollary, one can prove the following fact. So let us denote by h infinity with ohm below a, the Banner algebra function, polymorphic functions on the unit disk with values in a such that the image in a is relatively compact.
00:20:30.324 - 00:21:08.304, Speaker B: Okay, relative, relative image image. I need just to remove it. It's not support relatively compact image. Then of course the same result will be true. Also the previous one for algebra h infinity components a capital. Why? Because I told you at some point that there is a version of the same serum for functions with relatively compact images. So the solution will have also relatively compact image here.
00:21:08.304 - 00:22:31.946, Speaker B: And therefore, just using this result, we obtain this theorem for h infinity comp a capital. So the Bezel equation f one j plus so on, plus fnjm equals one is solvable in h infinity complex if actually it is solvable for every fixed z with the uniform bound of the solutions. If for every z, we obtain just one elements from the algebraic capital. So for them there are some other elements such that we have the solution, and moreover, the bounds for all these elements are just bounded by some, by some number for light. Yeah, when we'll do that, then we can prove it. So it just defect actually uses only the property of relative compactness of the images, because any such function from h infinity comp a extends as a continuous a valued function on the maximal ideal space of h infinity. And therefore, in particular, we are working with continuous functions on the maximal real space.
00:22:31.946 - 00:23:19.974, Speaker B: And so we have local stability of the problem. So if you know just that such equation is valid at one point, then it will be valid also in some open neighborhood. And this is what we need. Actually, I will not give details, but it's just not difficult. Okay, so as a corollary, we obtained from the previous results that if we want to compute maximal ideal space of the algebra h infinity comp a capital, then actually it will be the same as direct production of mh infinity and the maximum ideal space of algebra a. This is just from the previous solution of the bzu equation. Right away.
00:23:19.974 - 00:24:50.054, Speaker B: Okay, so this was unknown 60 years ago, even less, and I proved it in 2013, I believe. So still, this, I will not just give some details, but this fact is related also to the so called Grattan dig approximation problem from algebra h infinity, which is still open. So this problem says that if we'll just take it just in simple way, so it will take just any such function h infinity from h infinity, comma a. Then it can be uniformly approximated by functions with similar functions having finite images. So images and finite dimensional subspaces of algebra a capital. Okay, so, but I'll just go back to this serum three, and you can, no, not this three. And you can see here that you can apply it even, for instance, if we take algebra a capital as h infinity again, then h infinity from h infinity will be just h infinity on the by disk.
00:24:50.054 - 00:25:49.574, Speaker B: And so from here, this theorem gives you just. Yeah, and if you want to just to solve this equation, that your function will be one here, and therefore here one square will be still one. And so in this case, theorem will say something about solubility of the Bezou equation, say on the by disk. But you can extend it further by induction, and it will be the disk of dimension and still will be the same. So it says in particular that if you can solve locally the corona problem for the by disk, then you can solve it globally, but locally in some strong sense, because you are taking some specific open subsets. So subsets are coming from the one dimensional corona program. So just more restrictive condition.
00:25:49.574 - 00:27:00.154, Speaker B: Okay, but still it will give some examples, for instance, of Bezoic questions for which we can solve this, which can be solved, and it was unknown before. Still, it's not enough to prove the corona serum for the bad disk, unfortunately. Okay, so now I will just go further to a crater completion problem for h infinity. So it's just only one aspect of this operator compression problem. Namely, this will just about every operators bounded holomorphic operators with relatively compact images. So it's not about Hilbert space in general problem, but it's more general formulation, but only for the class of curators with relatively compact images. Okay, so we need to some definitions.
00:27:00.154 - 00:27:44.814, Speaker B: So let's consider any complex banner algebra a with unit one, not necessarily commutative, you see? So, and by a with minus one, we denote the group of invertible elements of this algebra. So one can check that it is a complex Banach regroup. So regroup, which is modulated on a Banach space. So with zero. Here I will denote the subset of invertible elements, which belongs to the connected component containing one. Also, I'll denote this subset al minus one. This will be just the subset of elements of the algebra a, which are left invertible.
00:27:44.814 - 00:28:43.074, Speaker B: This means that there is another a from another b from a such that b times a equals one. And finally, by Ida, we denote the set of identities of the algebra. So a square equals a. Now we have the following standard properties that a zero minus one acts on the left invertible elements by left multiplication. So just I'll take multiply by invertible element, any left invertible. Still it will be left invertible. The stabilizer, stabilizer, stabilizer, sorry, of a will be just it is a complex subgroup which consists of following element g, which preserve a so ga equals a.
00:28:43.074 - 00:30:32.164, Speaker B: So one can see that actually it doesn't depend on a and it will be isomorphic to one subgroup all the time whenever a just moves along a connected component of tl minus one. Okay, so in turn also the group of invertible elements in the unit component acts also on identity of a by conjugation. So this stabilizer in this case consists of all element g from at this group, such that the similarity transformation will preserve a. Okay, so now I will formulate some result which describes properties of idempotence and left invertible elements. For in the case of when we are working with algebra h infinity a capital. So about the proof, I'll tell later, but I'll tell you only that this is just the theory which is based on the solution of the debar equations that we considered in first and second lecture, plus on the structure of the set of trivial parts of the maximal ideal space mh infinity. This way we use the effects that we can locally solve deeper equations plus, roughly speaking, on the implicit functions theorem for holomorphic functions in Banach spaces.
00:30:32.164 - 00:31:37.102, Speaker B: But of course it requires also some technique just to glue together some facts and so on. So it requires also some specific structure of functions from h infinity as well. Okay, so here's the theorem. So first of all, consider just the adempetent from the algebraic infinity combine. So these just bounded holomorphic maps from the unidisk to complex unit Albena algebra a capital not commutative with relatively compact images. Suppose that stabilizer of the element f zero, so f zero will be just element of identity of a capital. So suppose the stabilizer of this element under the action of a zero minus one is connected.
00:31:37.102 - 00:32:47.194, Speaker B: So we need connectedness only. Then in this case we can just prove kind of canonical representation for such identity. And this means that there is some invertible element from h infinity coma from the unit, from the connected component of the unit, such that the conjugation with this element will give us exactly the value at zero. So here was just bounded clomorphic function, and this one just constant functions at the end of the algebra okay, so it is proof only when we assume that this group is connected. Okay, so connected. I will just say several words about this and the second theorem about the structure of left invertible elements. So, suppose that we have just the left invertible element f of the same algebra, who was asking? Nobody.
00:32:47.194 - 00:33:42.354, Speaker B: So, and assume again that the stabilizer, now just of a zero minus one acting on f zero, is connected. Still. We need connectedness. Then in this case, we can just transform this left invertible element to the constant element from left invertible constant element from the algebra. Just multiplication from from the left by invertible element of h infinity component a. So, this is just a nice result, but unfortunately, we need just to know something else as well. So what are these elements? H infinity, comma, l minus one in the second part, this is just kind of abstract here.
00:33:42.354 - 00:34:31.778, Speaker B: So, if you don't know, what are these elements, and therefore these elements can be still described in my theorem also. So these are just kind of the problem which is related to night problem of 1978. So, here we have in this situation, f in h infinity.com a is left invertible. So has left inverse g if and only if. For every z there is a left invert gz of f at z is just element of the algebra a. And moreover, all norms of all such elements are bounded uniformly from above.
00:34:31.778 - 00:35:01.878, Speaker B: So when we know this, then we can solve this problem. It is just a statement of this theorem. Br five serum four nine. And so this, therefore, we can just describe all these elements. Yeah, so we describe these elements. And therefore, you can just apply this serum if you need. Okay, so now just I mentioned that this problem is related to the night problem.
00:35:01.878 - 00:35:37.314, Speaker B: So it will be just the following formulation of the original night problem. So, suppose we have. So lx one x two will be just Banach spaces, one of the operators between complex Banach spaces x one and x two. So in this problem, h one and h two are separable Hilbert spaces. And we consider f from h infinity l h one h two. So, assume that at each point the operator is left invertible. This is just a condition here.
00:35:37.314 - 00:36:37.006, Speaker B: Okay, does this mean that left invertible, sorry. And also we have the uniform bound of left inverse operator. This condition means exactly that, because here just delta. The question is whether under this condition there is g global from h infinity lh two h one such that it will be the left inverse of f capital. Okay, so in this situation, it is not true in general. And there are some results of Sergey trail, which gives contra example for this problem in some general situation. But there are some kind of, some kind of cases where it is still true.
00:36:37.006 - 00:37:31.124, Speaker B: And this theorem 49, it is one of these cases even in a more general situation, where you consider just some arbitrary exponents to not only separable Hilbert spaces. Okay, so here just some text that you will not just read, you can read yourself because you will have slides. So the result is very important and it is explained in the book of Nikola Nikolsky. This problem, I mean, it's very important. Okay, so what are positive results? Positive results for the night problem is when dim h one is finite. So this means that, yeah, so from h one to h two, h one is finite dimensional. So it is true.
00:37:31.124 - 00:38:17.212, Speaker B: Also, Sergey trail proves that if f is a small perturbation of left invertible function f zero. So this means that f minus f zero just belongs to some nice class of Hilbert Schmidt operators. Then it will be true in this situation as well. So not problem. Yeah, and so, and my previous theorem says that it is always true when we consider h infinity comb lh one h two. Why? Because for infinite dimensional Gilbert space, we know that the group of bounded linear operators is contractible due to the result of PPA. And this is the main point.
00:38:17.212 - 00:39:08.786, Speaker B: Just to apply this result, six. Okay, so now just at the end of my mini course, I'll consider the following example. So we'll work with now with the following. Banach algebra, the most natural application. So it will be lx, the Banach linear operators on the complex Banach space X equipped with operator norm. So ix will denote the identity operator Glx, the set of invertible bounded linear operators on x capital. And so for this algebra, so it is the same as Glx.
00:39:08.786 - 00:40:12.758, Speaker B: Now Gl zero X will denote the connected component containing the unit transformation. Let us start first with group of idempotents. So, if each identifier can define by the projection to a closed subspace, therefore determines a direct sum decomposition. So xe zero plus x e one x e zero is just kernel, x e one is co kernel. And it is easily seen that the stabilizer of the action by conjugation of Gl zero X will consist of breadth, which map x e k to x e k. So x e k should be just invariant with respect to this operator. So this will be stabilizer.
00:40:12.758 - 00:41:15.812, Speaker B: So if red block matrices, it's easy to see that it will be true. So in particular, so if we just restrict jl zero xe to x e k equals zero one, then we obtain an injection of complex banachle groups monomorphism, just an algebraic definition. So it will be just the injection of zero xe into the direct product of these two groups. Okay, and Se will be isomorphism if and only if Glx ek are connected. If they connected, then actually just will be isomorphism. And therefore, now we can just reformulate serum six one in this case. So it will be like the full length theorem.
00:41:15.812 - 00:42:52.204, Speaker B: So suppose f will be just operator holomorphic operator idempotent, such that the image of the disk will be relatively compact in ls. And assume that for the value at zero which is denoted as a groups Glx e zero and Glx e one are connected. So in the decomposition kernel and co kernel have connected invertible groups, then the theorem states that there is some g which is invertible element in the component containing one of h infinity comp such that the conjugation g of g minus one will be e in this situation. Now in particular, so we have some bunch of examples where this group Glx e zero and Glx e one are connected. So we can take for instance finite dimensional space. Yeah, it's obvious because it will be group Gl and C which is connected Hilbert space infinite dimensional, which is also known due to Cooper results. In this case, we obtain that xe zero and xe one will be also Hilbert spaces.
00:42:52.204 - 00:43:53.336, Speaker B: And we have two situations, whether both of them are infinite dimensions and these groups are contractible. If one of them is not infinite dimensional, that it is finite dimensional, so it is connected. Also, we know the same for the following banner spaces c zero small lp, small p between one and infinity. And this was proved just many years ago, 50 years already by Mitigin said, in this situation, for such spaces, GL groups will be contractible, even for if the spaces are infinite dimensional. Yeah, so they are contractible. But we need just to know something about subspaces of the spaces. And here these are just deep.
00:43:53.336 - 00:44:55.054, Speaker B: Also classical result of Velcinski and Linden Strauss, which says that if we have C naught or LTP between one and infinity, then its infinite dimensional complemented subspaces are isomorphic to the same space. So it will be the synod for Lp as well, and therefore according to meteor. And so we can apply this theorem. But so Doherty was the first who gave an example of a complex banar space X with disconnected group GLX. So I believe it was Banach space lp Times Lq. So did a product of LP and LQ with different TNQ. So in this case he proved that the group of connected components of GLx will be isomorphic to this is a group of integers.
00:44:55.054 - 00:46:40.110, Speaker B: Okay, so yeah, so now just the second situation, let us consider now the left and vertical elements. So each left invertible element determines a complemented subspace x one, which is rank of a range and which will be isomorphic to x as well. The stabilizer then in this case of the action by left multiplication consists of all operators b, such that restriction of b to this x one is the identity operator. So if x two will be a complemented subspace to x one, then any such elemental stabilizer will have the following form. Upper triangle form on the diagonal will be a ix one and d where d will be in gl x two and c will be from x two to x one. So, and therefore the group gl zero xe of such operators is hematopically equivalent to the subgroup of quotient group here. Okay, and such that subgroup of operators d such that if we take ix 1d, then it will be in the unit component.
00:46:40.110 - 00:47:27.874, Speaker B: This is the only thing. So unit component ix one diagonal. Okay, and so here we obtain the following from the second part of the six. Suppose that we have left invertible element of capital in our algebra and denote by f by e f at zero. Then the corresponding group gl x washing x y, and assume that the corresponding group of glass x quotient by x one is connected. Then actually there is some invertible global invertible element such that f equal g. So again we can present it, we can just transform it to the constant operator.
00:47:27.874 - 00:48:22.904, Speaker B: So in matrices, one can just prove it in the following way. So suppose f will be f one, f two and g. Then we have this form and e will be this form. So x two will be just corresponding to the second component here. Okay, so then we obtain that in this situation. So if we reformulate it on the language of these operators, this means that the previous result says that we can complement this f one f two to an invertible element. So we'll just set here something and so it will be just invertible element in h compel infinity zero in hl infinity.
00:48:22.904 - 00:49:25.222, Speaker B: Yeah, zero minus one. So this means that f extends to an invertible mn. In particular, we obtain the following corollary. Suppose that f from ancient infinity comp l y one y two, where yy are some complex planar spaces such that for each z there is left invertible gz satisfying the boundless condition of norms over zoom. And assume that gly y equals kernel of the value in G zero is connected. Then actually this is just kind of extension of operators which is written here. So we can find h and g from l y one plus y to y two, and from the other side such that ag equals one operator y two.
00:49:25.222 - 00:50:18.444, Speaker B: Gh will be just another operator by one y, and restriction will be just two y, one will be exactly f. This is just extension of matrices in terms of operators written here. Okay, so, and finally I have 1 minute. So just tell you what we use to prove this theorem. So, so this theorem is based on the following effect, which is proof to machinery that was developed before in my paper. So suppose we have a complex bandai group with unit one, and consider open cover, finite open cover of maximal ideal space. Suppose that we have holomorphic percycle on the COVID of the disk obtained from here with relatively compact image in the group G.
00:50:18.444 - 00:51:09.712, Speaker B: Okay, so this is just definition of the cycle. Then the result says that actually we can resolve this. So this means that we can write gig as gi minus one times gg, where gi also will be functions with relatively complex images in G. Roughly speaking, this says that. Yeah, so roughly speaking, this says that actually principal polymorphic principle bundles with connected group. I forgot to write here, connecting over MH infinity are trivial. And this is what, what is used to prove all previous results of the last section.
00:51:09.712 - 00:51:18.602, Speaker B: Thank you very much. So I will create several misprints here and then I will send slides again. Okay, that's it. Thank you.
00:51:18.778 - 00:51:55.750, Speaker A: Thank you very much, Alex, for wonderful talk. Questions, comments, suggestions? Yes, Paul, please. Yes, Alex. First of all, thank you very much for these very important, informative lectures. My question is just one of history or terminology today. You part of the result you presented, you said was an OCA grauer theory.
00:51:55.942 - 00:51:56.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:56.694 - 00:52:05.712, Speaker A: And what does that mean? What kind of things are labeled Grauer theory?
00:52:05.848 - 00:52:58.574, Speaker B: Yeah. So this means that as I know. Yeah, so Oka was just like a father of this, one of the fuzzers of multidimensional complex analysis. So it contains what is called now OchA principle, but only for one dimensional complex or only for rank one linear polymorphic boundaries. Now, Grauert, in one of his work just extended this fact for two principal holomorphic bundles over Stein spaces. Okay, and this is just. But, but then it was also results of Gromov.
00:52:58.574 - 00:53:48.414, Speaker B: And so we can just also call it just Oca grauert Gromov principle. Gromov results are much more complicated and more involved. But actually the generalization of the notions of vibration and so on, in such situation, the analog of principle as well. So. Oh, I forgot to mention. What is principle? So the principle is as follows. If you can solve something some in terms of continuous functions, then you can solve it also in terms of collimorative functions, such as the local principle.
00:53:48.414 - 00:53:49.546, Speaker B: Okay.
00:53:49.690 - 00:53:50.170, Speaker A: Yes.
00:53:50.242 - 00:53:56.774, Speaker B: Okay, thank you. And this is where only for, you know. So for. For stain manifolds.
00:53:57.074 - 00:54:01.974, Speaker A: Yes. Yes. Excuse me, that's my telephone. I'll shut off mute.
00:54:02.994 - 00:54:08.138, Speaker B: Okay, so thank you for. For asking, Paul. So, any other.
00:54:08.186 - 00:54:13.970, Speaker A: More questions, comments? Well, if not.
00:54:14.082 - 00:54:28.518, Speaker B: Oh, thank you, guys. I was just. It was nice to present at least some small part of the results to you. Hopefully it will be better.
00:54:28.566 - 00:54:47.824, Speaker C: Now, I have a comment, if I may. So first, I'd like to thank you, Alex, for a nice series of talks. The other thing. So, in the first talk, you mentioned that there are counterexamples to corona on Riemann surfaces.
00:54:48.404 - 00:54:49.060, Speaker B: Yes.
00:54:49.172 - 00:54:53.284, Speaker C: The first such counterexample was given by Brian Cole.
00:54:53.404 - 00:54:54.144, Speaker B: Yes.
00:54:54.444 - 00:55:11.304, Speaker C: I don't think his name was ever mentioned. I thought his name should be brought up. So I wanted to mention the first counterexample was given by Brian Cole, and it's presented in the monograph of gamlin, uniform algebras and Jensen measures.
00:55:13.284 - 00:55:17.704, Speaker B: Yeah, let me see. Maybe I have here Brian who.
00:55:21.004 - 00:55:41.864, Speaker C: Brian never published it, but it's in Gamlin. Yes, it's in the book of Gamlin that you also, I think it's interesting to note that there's an earlier counter example on an analytic variety that's due to Eric Bishop.
00:55:42.564 - 00:55:47.396, Speaker B: Ah, I didn't know that. So it would be nice if you'll send me a reference of that.
00:55:47.500 - 00:56:02.756, Speaker C: Well, so that's in another. It's in a paper of Gamlin, which I think is also on your list. It's the paper in which he proves the localization of the corona problem for domains in the plane.
00:56:02.900 - 00:56:09.632, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, here it is. Yeah. This one. G two. Right.
00:56:09.688 - 00:56:11.600, Speaker C: Localization of the corona problem.
00:56:11.792 - 00:56:21.124, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, thank you. So I will just look in that. And so I will just add these references as well.
00:56:23.704 - 00:56:34.624, Speaker A: More questions or comments? Well, if not, let's thank Alex again for this talk and for his wonderful series of talks. Thank you.
00:56:35.764 - 00:56:39.684, Speaker B: Thank you. So I'm going out.
