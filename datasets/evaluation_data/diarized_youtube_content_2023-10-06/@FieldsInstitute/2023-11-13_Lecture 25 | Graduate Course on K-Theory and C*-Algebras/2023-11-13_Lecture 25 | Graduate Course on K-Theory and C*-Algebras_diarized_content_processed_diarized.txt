00:00:01.440 - 00:01:52.554, Speaker A: Well, there was one push in Pascal's triangle that I wanted to do quickly and then we have to move on. Has to do about Perry destiny. It the order break has a unit element which is also assumed to be an order unit. Something is less everything less than or equal to some loan, some positive load. And we want to show that phi is state. That means the map g to russian function. Otherwise those are the states.
00:01:52.554 - 00:03:14.168, Speaker A: The states form a compact convex. You know the extreme points and know that every element is an average extreme points with respect to the measure on the extreme measure on the screen. So this proof the calculation of the point wise strict point wise order for polynomials on the interior of the unit interval. It's positive nonzero at every point in the. I want to show that that order, that order of structure on the polynomials implies if it's in the pascal, namely the summons of monomials in x and one minus x. It was needed for the proof of the fella moment problem. What we needed to know is every element, every state is an average of points on the interval zero one.
00:03:14.168 - 00:04:18.484, Speaker A: And so you want to know this extreme what the OS implies more. I believe the contradict is true after the fact, based in the special case of as true for the continuous functions on the contact space. It means real value functions on a compact space. Whether it's true for general or brain, I don't know, but we don't need that. My point I wanted to mention today, we need to know exactly what the extreme points are. You know, we want Pascal primal, so called Pascal. It belongs to the angle one.
00:04:18.484 - 00:04:51.274, Speaker A: If you have a measure concentrated on the extreme points, it's concentrated on interval zero one. That's exactly what moment problem wants. It wants a measure of interval 0.1. So that's. And let me just outline this number of people have communicated to me that they tell the truth. Let me just outline it again. I think everyone should consider it as an exercise.
00:04:51.274 - 00:05:44.106, Speaker A: And maybe they'll put on their thinking cap a little about converse. So, closed eyes and you have element a arbitrary element of b, element a between zero and one, and every omen is less than some multiple of one. You can easily reduce the phase. It's less than equal. Computation would be easier. So b is arbitrary. Then define by survey as a state PI, sub a of b equals five.
00:05:44.106 - 00:06:14.034, Speaker A: A times b. Okay, because a is positive and b times b is positive for any b. For any positive b, this is a positive function. And if we divide by phi of a, well, let's assume that phi of a is not phi of a is equal to zero. Easy to show. Five a and b is also. This is a state.
00:06:14.034 - 00:06:50.810, Speaker A: And also phi one minus a state, because a is less than one. One minus a is positive PI. One minus a minus b divided by. This is now a setup. We have two states and a certain linear combination of them. Convex combination is equal to five. Now, can you tell me what.
00:06:50.810 - 00:07:37.334, Speaker A: Can you tell people what convex combination you should take? Yeah. I want to get. Phi is equal to lambda times PI, sub a, plus one minus lamb times PI, sub one minus a convex population. So if this is equal to five, extreme, that means that phi is. Is equal to five. And the phi, sub a is equal to phi, that means that phi. Put the phi a upstairs.
00:07:37.334 - 00:08:21.200, Speaker A: Then the phi ab equal phi a times. If that's equal to phi, then phi ab is equal to phi a times phi b. Okay. So if we can prove this is a general factor, whether PI is extreme or not, that they got this convex combination. Vincent, do you want to tell me. Do you want to tell people what the lambda should be? Right. I can't hear them.
00:08:21.200 - 00:08:38.656, Speaker A: Yeah. You're saying it should be something involving b. Classify by. Yeah, because there isn't any b in. You always want to start with what the. Very. Okay, good.
00:08:38.656 - 00:09:27.308, Speaker A: So. And phi sub a, it's got a phi a on the bottom, right. Then on top of this, phi ab, right? And it's the same for one minus lambda will be one. Will be phi one minus a, right? And so you. One minus lambda times v five. So that's how you proved that. Abigail.
00:09:27.308 - 00:09:45.776, Speaker A: You told me you had that. I think you know this. Well, that's what my understanding. You were. One day after class, you were. So. You told me that.
00:09:45.776 - 00:10:04.664, Speaker A: I understood that you knew how to. Doc. Why is it. Okay, well, we also assume that phi of a. Sorry. Phi a is not equal to one. Those cases are fine.
00:10:04.664 - 00:10:31.724, Speaker A: What was your question? Just, like, why it's phi one minus a times b in the top there. For phi sub one minus a. But then it's phi sub a times b. Well, okay. So I'm saying that this is the overlay. I'm sorry, the. Of course, I left out the.
00:10:31.724 - 00:11:14.050, Speaker A: This is the definition of phi. One minus a times phi b. Five b. What am I saying? This is. What's the definition? What's the definition of five? One minus a? Just take my one by and say, oh, you caught me at a moment of concentration. So I hope everyone else was able to figure this out. Okay, so otherwise it's.
00:11:14.050 - 00:11:30.414, Speaker A: Otherwise it's terribly confusing. Right. Is that. Okay, so phi one minus a times b, which is. We're cutting it down. Phi is positive, never. B is positive.
00:11:30.414 - 00:12:00.864, Speaker A: And multiply the b by one minus a, and it's still positive. That's to get a positive number. Plugging b equals one. Then you just give it one. So it's a state. All right. Thanks for the way.
00:12:00.864 - 00:13:11.024, Speaker A: I would be very. I very much welcome an essay on pascal's trying. And there are a lot of aspects related to. One could write anywhere from five to 25 pages and everyone would be the better for it. How many people remember my notorious demonstration, which I. Exposition of the proof of the classification theorem for eth algebra? Rishi, what was step one? Okay, what was step two? The same thing. Well, the opposite thing again.
00:13:11.024 - 00:13:35.164, Speaker A: Well, actually, more or less the same. Right. What was step three? Okay, and then you were finished. That's. That would be worth an essay, too, explaining what the. Explaining what the different steps mean. Description.
00:13:35.164 - 00:14:24.564, Speaker A: That's what I call. That's a schematic. We call schematic diagram of the proof. I was only thinking, you have the two horizontal sequences from the algebra. And. And then how do we do limit output? And then, actually, what is in this diagram is the k zero groups of the finite. And then.
00:14:24.564 - 00:15:28.924, Speaker A: And there's a given. Maps given a nice marcism of the inductive limits people. Then what you do is you pull that back to. After you pass the subsequences of the two horizontal diagrams which exist and have limits, k zero groups, because that's what k zero does. It preserves the operation of taking an inductive loop of the sequence. You take the two sequences of k zero groups, each one of which is a finite direct sum of copies of z or quoted new vaccine. And then passing through sequences, you got arrows, which makes the diagram mute at the level of.
00:15:28.924 - 00:15:57.064, Speaker A: And this was a. This was a. Already a bit of an operation we had. We came back to it more than once. Definitely an essay. Essay material. And then step two, Rishi, you want to say quickly what step two, actually, what this diagram represents.
00:15:57.064 - 00:17:01.124, Speaker A: You want to go from maps of map. Yeah. Right. So no more subsequences at this stage, no subsequent, just any map here we just constructed out, which gives rise to it and even takes the unit into the unit. This also preserves the unit as well as the orders for stepwise lifting of the k zero nut to an algebra. And the trouble is, since it's step by step, there's no control on whether it's commutative by the way, these are the given time, you want all those triangles to be created. That's what the third diagram is supposed to remind you of how you go step by step to make the diagram, make the individual triangles without fiddling with earlier triangles.
00:17:01.124 - 00:18:14.834, Speaker A: That means when you're finished, you're going to diagram algebra. And it's this means that you get corresponding schematic diagram for the proof of quite distance twelve. If you first look at the left, we have a. And then k zero is more. The definition is more direct. The algebra has a unit. And then we map, we have the double suspension for the single suspension, much less engine.
00:18:14.834 - 00:19:32.590, Speaker A: What is Soa? That's a suspension. What's the definition of? Yes, so it functions on the whole line, which converge to zero. The values take values in a and they converge to zero at infinity, plus and minus infinity. And then you take the super and quantifiers. That's a Banach algorithm. We're talking about Banach algorithms rather than siesta algorithms, because we've just discussed the relationship between k zero definitions. We need to use the panic algebra setup and it'll become clear why we need Banach alpha.
00:19:32.590 - 00:20:16.774, Speaker A: It's not already have. Larry, do you remember, do you remember what goes wrong in the sea geology context? We haven't really seen it come to life. It's the question whether you define k one well. So by the way, I guess we want k zero in terms of y importance too. Okay, but that's important also. K one should be defined in terms of inverter this way. And the reason is that in the sea structural context, try to do in terms of unitaries.
00:20:16.774 - 00:21:00.434, Speaker A: And when you start approximating the unitary by something, well, you won't know it's unitary, you just know it's invertible. And you're not allowed to fiddle with it to make a unitary. I mean, there's a joke, a bad joke. If it's close to a unitary and you want it to be unitary, just replace it by the given unitary. But you actually have to do it on a whole curve, and you want the new curve to have a special property. What type of property do we want for the new curve? You want the new curve to be so we're given a curve of voltage. So that's what's jumping ahead.
00:21:00.434 - 00:21:36.084, Speaker A: A zero a. Once that k one. Actually, we also k one. K one is usually find first for an algebra with unit. It's a complex static algebra. You don't need to throw away the unit afterwards, because k one is a complex zero. But anyway, we're working unit two s away.
00:21:36.084 - 00:24:06.394, Speaker A: So if s of a is functions in a function values in a converting to zero plus or minus infinity, well then the s tilde the functions on the line which converge to independently to two scalar multiples of the unit at plus or minus infinity. It won't be independent if it's, if you have a function converting to zero both ends, and you adjoin a unit, then that function is constant equal to one everywhere. So you multiply it by a scalar will be constant equal to a scalar everywhere. So if you do put the two things together, you'll get sa functions converging to the same scalar like, which is the same as functions on the circle. So when sma is functions on the circle, which are values of, we have function f circle and f 1.1 times. Okay, so what was the, how many people remember the map they discussed? We discussed that we start with a projection here in a, and we want to get a vertical element which is a function on the whole line, and infinity, it should be plus, it should be plus one.
00:24:06.394 - 00:24:48.620, Speaker A: Well, we could take constant equal to one everywhere. P is zero. I guess we will take constant equal one everywhere. And do you have a suggestion? P times s plus one minus p. Yeah, yeah, that would be, that was the, that was definitely the function p belongs to a p times z. Z, of course, is the function z is z or z equals z. Okay, z is a function z where z is on the circle.
00:24:48.620 - 00:25:18.188, Speaker A: It's just a point on the circle. Z for the whole complex, a point on the whole complex plane. Maybe later, but today it's just a point on the unit circle p z, it'll be prefixed. Z will be an a. But if you, if z is equal to one. No. Yes, z is equal to one.
00:25:18.188 - 00:26:47.230, Speaker A: It's not a scale of multiple of the unit. That's why we do what if set is equal to one, then this is just one. So on the circle we got a function from the values in a, because a has a unit, this is the unit a one minus p means the quantum function on the circle constant equal to this is the function of p times. And what's an exercise to show that this gives us a map from k zero a to k one of sa. That would be good for, that would be good for a large part, a good part of one week somewhere, not to show it. So if two productions are equivalent, I think this might have a very fun. As a semi group, the unit two productions are equivalent.
00:26:47.230 - 00:27:53.864, Speaker A: Then the two verticals of course, this is invertible vertical element. They're doing vertical, vertical. And then they have to show pq equals qp equals zero. In these, the product in k one of those two. Composition of k one. We want to get a map, the group map, a zero of the algebra k one. Okay, so that's the, I guess that's the first step getting the math.
00:27:53.864 - 00:28:44.784, Speaker A: And we have the group that we have the map. Step two, maybe in step three. Okay, so I want to have a periodic, periodic diagram, especially this third schematic. Third part of the schematic diagram is an arrow, which is as a group map. What to prove? It's like you can just write it like this. That's the sine group. I mean, that means for definitive, that's the schematics function.
00:28:44.784 - 00:30:02.294, Speaker A: What you syntax. Here's the circle and here's a path. I guess it should start. These are, these are invertible elements of a, except at this point, the continuous function of the invertible elements a. At this point, one constant convertible element suspension in time. It might be a non zero scalar, but then you just want to fly through the inverses are open on zero scalar. That doesn't affect the k one class because k one verticals in circle are connected, not necessarily in the circle.
00:30:02.294 - 00:32:17.830, Speaker A: Verticals in a complex plane, nonzero points in a complex plane are connected. Okay, so we have given a path of variables and we want to show it in this group, k one group, it's equal to something coming from this map between groups. Well, this is on the semi group, right? Otherwise if it's something in the group, then you go into, well, actually it might be, this might be a projection in some matrix algebra, in which case this would be the, this would be the unit of that matrix element. So we want to get, we want to show that this is, it comes from two different things like this in matrix one by taking the formal difference. Okay, well, actually you might be pictures. Any questions? Matthew or Mark have any questions? Okay, let's, first of all, what we'd like to do is reduce it to just finding a single one of these maps. Okay? We'd like to just, just like for when we put darkness in the middle six term sequence, darkness in k zero is the large extension output k one of extension out.
00:32:17.830 - 00:33:18.262, Speaker A: We want to discuss that. It was important to notice that you have k zero of an algebra. And you don't just take two line importance in matrix algorithms, two arbitrary lines in matrix algorithms, and subtract the classes by enlarging them both by the same amount, you can assume that one of them is the unit of a vector. Then with the unit of a matrix algebra, p is the unit of a matrix algebra. Then it just maps into z. Maybe, let's say z. And then that's it.
00:33:18.262 - 00:34:33.613, Speaker A: Because the p is equal to the one times the unit. If you like, z times the unit all the way down the diagonal. But then this could be this times one, sub n, once again, is the unit. Okay, so we want to show that an arbitrary thing in the right hand side, there's the difference of two things like this. We can assume that one of them is like this, but that means that you can, you can get rid of the, by the way, that's also the same as the nth. That's the same in k one as n to the nth times one. So if you have a production in the algebra itself, then minus n times z.
00:34:33.613 - 00:35:50.852, Speaker A: And then what? You multiply both the one you're adding, and when you're subtracting by that and the end, this one becomes trivial. And the given map is just multiplied by a polyjet plus one minus p. Get P z to the n plus one, plus one minus p times. And that would be just as good. Actually, with the multiplying group, if you want to get rid of z to the n, we multiply both top and bottom by z to the minus n. So that's going to be z. So what's, so this is a single thing then we have to get a single curve.
00:35:50.852 - 00:36:12.288, Speaker A: This is the curve. It's an element of SA 20. We want to get just a single one. What's special about this? What's, what's special about it, by the way? We get this, we can get the z. We can get Z to the NC's. We got, we got that here. We've got it already, actually.
00:36:12.288 - 00:36:52.950, Speaker A: We don't have to multiply through by it. We can just forget about it. So actually we just have to get, because the other one we can get and the things we can get are a group. Once we know it's a group map and the image is a group, right. If you want to get everything, it's enough to get some things, differences or images. If you take the difference of that and you get everything. So we can, and these we can get.
00:36:52.950 - 00:37:12.834, Speaker A: So we only have to get these. That's just a kind of silly diagram. Please. All right. How many people are familiar with diagram? It's a nice game. Just look it up. Just look it up.
00:37:12.834 - 00:38:05.860, Speaker A: Okay. Not to be confused with wild goose chase here we've caught something. Here we've caught something. What we've caught is we only have to show something like this gums from. But actually, what's important about this? What are the important things about this? We can get it for a given path. Well, first of all, we have to be sure the path will give us just right, because the path might require taking a formal difference. But what are we doing? Who are we to multiply through? Well, that's fine.
00:38:05.860 - 00:38:45.504, Speaker A: If, if we can, if we already have this, then we multiply through it. We know what to put. Suppose we don't have this. What am I trying to get towards? The sort of conceptual secret of this whole proof, the conceptual secret. And it's where the vertical elements have to come in instead of unitarians. Okay, we had an arbitrary path. Arbitrary path.
00:38:45.504 - 00:39:45.628, Speaker A: You could say they were unitary, but not been staying very long. And we want to, we'd like to get it to be passed something like this. Well, what's special about this function as quantum z? What's a linear function in Zen? Right. These other ones I was looking at with z to the n and so on, those are polynomials in z. That's the secret. Secret for this proof is to approximate your given curve, your given closed curve, which is just continuous, continuous path in the group of invertible elements equal to one. And one couldn't just be an arbitrary continuous path.
00:39:45.628 - 00:40:29.924, Speaker A: We want to be polynomial. Polynomial with coefficients, polynomial with coefficients in the l or in the matrix lie. And that the endpoint should be that we still want to get. You want to get the identity ratios, because if we got, well, I, worse one, to get a matrix with scalars. Scalars are invertible. You can deform it to the matrix. Invertible matrices are connected to the elements looking for polynomial paths equal to one and one.
00:40:29.924 - 00:41:05.362, Speaker A: That's the secret strategy. Why does that, why is that important if it's a polynomial? First of all, it will be on polynomial. In the first instance, you have said positive power and negative powers. That's what we saw. Because you can approximate by trigonometric polynomials, which have powers of z and powers of z inverse. And we, those are not ordinary polynomials. We want ordinary polynomials.
00:41:05.362 - 00:41:48.584, Speaker A: There's positive powers of. Can you modify through, by the, by power of z, get rid of all the negative powers. And that's legitimate because the powers of net, you can get like nobody's business. Okay, so once we can approximate by. Those are, those are unitary, so those are norm preserving, so being quantified by z to the n. So it doesn't change how close, how close the polynomial is to any given path. So what we want to do is get a polynomial approximation, multiply it by then we know it has a positive plus degree and a minus degree.
00:41:48.584 - 00:42:55.964, Speaker A: Right? And you multiply it by the minus degree, you get rid of the negative powers, and you have an ordinary polynomial in Z. But then you go to work on it. So why answer you want to have the degree doesn't really make sense when it's positive and negative powers, is that right? Normally, normally you talk about degree for polynomial to x, not in z to the just positive powers. It has a degree, and the proof just be reducing the degree. The idea is you have a vertical element, vertical path, and its dependence on z is polynomial with coefficients. And it might be. And what we want to get is a linear polynomial.
00:42:55.964 - 00:43:15.644, Speaker A: This is a linear polynomial. Can't hit the polynomial by something. So reduce the degree. Then we keep doing it. So we get down to degree one. And of course, it's got to be a process that doesn't get it all the way down to degree zero because the constant thing would have trivial k one class. Don't expect that.
00:43:15.644 - 00:44:04.794, Speaker A: Well, by the way, something has to give. We can't just expect the polynomial. We can't expect us to do something inside the algebra. If this is inside the algebra, we can't expect to work on the polynomial just inside the arm, get lower the degree. But if we go to matrices, that gives us more room. We call this f, and look at the matrix f, zero, zero, one by two. Matrix F is n is a polynomial and z, well, this is a two by two matrix.
00:44:04.794 - 00:45:30.480, Speaker A: That's linear algebra. What's the most important tool in the. Matthew, are you familiar with linear alpha? Mark, are you familiar with any of you saying what to do? Have you heard of, have you heard of robbery? Doctor? Okay, how many people have heard of Robert? Obviously you have to find bathroom in your album. No, not really. Not rolling out snakes. Any algorithms? I studied both Latin and Greek. I don't remember everything.
00:45:30.480 - 00:46:05.006, Speaker A: For one thing, I spent a certain amount of that time standing out in the hall. That's all right. I like to think my remarks were keen precautions. I think they were just. Or I was discussing important matters with names. They were important. Okay.
00:46:05.006 - 00:46:41.118, Speaker A: But row reduction means you. It means you do something. It doesn't. Turns out it doesn't affect the connected component of the matrix, but it simplifies it. So when you do is you call reduction to you. Row, row reduction, row operations, you call operations. And that's, that's not going to change the k one class.
00:46:41.118 - 00:47:17.168, Speaker A: This is still the same k one class. And because the k one is defined by, like the regression, this is how you do it. So what you risk, we're about to lose the room. Okay, but that's how it goes. Okay? The row and column operations allow us to get rid of one of at least one power, the highest power, Zen. And the thing is that they're going to leave some lower powers of that elsewhere. Okay, maybe at least three.
00:47:17.168 - 00:47:42.156, Speaker A: One. So we're never going to get rid of the last powers, which is what we expect. Right? Okay, so that's how it goes. You can, and then you end up with a linear polynomial. And the point is, why do you have the one. So it's linear polynomial, it's, it's a Z plus b. Okay, if you plug in, Z equals one, you always preserve equal to one of one.
00:47:42.156 - 00:48:09.704, Speaker A: Okay, so plug in Z equals one, what do you get? Two happens. Well, you gotta get an equation. A plus b equals one. That means b equals one minus a. That's what we're looking for. So if we're halfway there, we're more than halfway, because b and one minus a commute, I mean, a and b commute. If b is equal to one minus a.
00:48:09.704 - 00:48:45.262, Speaker A: We're in a commutative bandic algebra capacity. What's generated by a and b? That's another reason not to use sea structure, because the wouldn't get a community algebra. Just essentially functions on it. Essentially functions on the circuit, it functions on the plane. And you can do elementary considerations. That's how you read the program. Okay, well, we'll come back to it.
00:48:45.262 - 00:48:48.194, Speaker A: That's not the end. Okay, the end for today.
