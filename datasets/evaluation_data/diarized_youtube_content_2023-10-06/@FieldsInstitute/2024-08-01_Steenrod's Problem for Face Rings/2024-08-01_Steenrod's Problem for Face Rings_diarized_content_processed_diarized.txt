00:00:00.640 - 00:00:06.926, Speaker A: Yeah. Our first speaker this morning is Dom Stanley, who's going to tell us about Steeno's problem for face rings.
00:00:07.078 - 00:00:32.620, Speaker B: Thanks, Ian. And thanks to the organizers for the invitation to speak here. This is joint work with master hero Decada. I made sure I wrote that up. I hate it when I forget to mention my co authors. That's very painful. Okay, so the first thing we start off with is a, is a graded algebra over Z.
00:00:32.620 - 00:01:44.286, Speaker B: I mean, of course there would be similar problems over other rings, but we're just concentrating on the problem over Z for now. And what does Steamrod's problem say? Steenrod's problem, basically it asks if that graded algebra comes from a space, so does there exist to space x such that the comology of x with z coefficients is isomorphic to a? That's Steenrod's problem, or the comology realization problem. There's many variants of that. You could look at a additional Steenrod algebra structure or something like that. So, and if yes, then a is called realizable. Is called realizable. Okay.
00:01:44.286 - 00:02:16.198, Speaker B: And Larry, in his talk, he talked about a different version of this. So something where if after you tensor with Q, it becomes an exterior algebra. Talked about that. I'm mostly going to be considering Stanley Reisner rings, right? So let's just talk about some various earlier versions of that, some examples of how that was solved. So if you look at a equals z a modulo a cubed. So this is almost the simplest possible case you can imagine. This is essentially the Hoffman variant, one problem.
00:02:16.198 - 00:02:57.420, Speaker B: So it's already, in this very simple case, a complicated problem. And the other thing is you get that a is realizable. That happens if and only if the degree of a equals two, four or eight. So it's important in this problem whether the answer, you know, the answer depends strongly on the degrees of the generators. Okay, so that will come up. So the next thing is that Steenrod, when he asked this question, it was in a paper from the early sixties, these. So steam rod and steamrod showed.
00:02:57.420 - 00:03:45.508, Speaker B: So this. Yeah, this is by Adams, and it's about 1960. And then steam rod, there's a variant of that problem, steamrod, in around, also around 1960. If you just have one generator and you have a polynomial algebra is realizable. That happens if and only if the degree of a is equal to two or four. Okay, so that was the first version of a polynomial algebra. So then this problem, actually for polynomial algebra was developed, was a very important problem in homotopy theory for about the next 50 years, and a lot of important work developed out of it.
00:03:45.508 - 00:05:03.520, Speaker B: And the theory of, say, p compact groups was partially motivated by studying this problem and then using p compact groups. The problem was finally solved by Anderson and Grodel around 2010. So it took about 50 years to solve this problem. And what it says is that a. Now we have a polynomial algebra on mini generators up to, say, am our favorite thing for an integer, our favorite letter for an integer that's realizable. That happens if, and only if a is a tensor product of things that come essentially from compact lead groups of the comology of, say, bu one or cp infinity BSun, and that's BSun and B Spnhdenhe. So things.
00:05:03.520 - 00:05:44.810, Speaker B: So basically, all the common algebras have to come from the classical league groups. Of course, they also gave a much bigger theory about what happens mod P. And then the situation is much more complicated. Well, I mean, you should know these from your graduate school, but I mean, I mean, basically this one is a two. This one would be like. So right now I'm writing the generators, and I'm writing it, writing them the generators as subscripts. This one would be z, a four, a six, every even degree up to two n.
00:05:44.810 - 00:06:14.700, Speaker B: And this one would be every, every degree divisible by four up to four n. So a four, a four n. Okay, right. So that took a long time. And as I said, it develops a lot of things. You know, Adams, Wilkerson, Dwyer, and Wilkerson developing p compact groups. And actually, Dietrich Notbom was also involved in this story at some point.
00:06:14.700 - 00:07:16.110, Speaker B: Okay, so now I'm going to talk about, more about the case that I'm interested in, in this talk, which is back to something we've been talking about. So, we have one of our favorite things. We have a simplicial complex k, on some vertex set m, which is the integers from one to m. And then we have out of that we can construct srk, which is the face ring of khdem, face ring of k, which is equal to, say, z. You have some generators which go up to m vm, one for each vertex, one for each element of the set m. So you have one for each vertex, and k, and modulo ik and ik is generated by missing simplices. Maybe I'll.
00:07:16.110 - 00:07:55.690, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe I'll go like that. Okay, so an ik is generated by missing simplices. Missing simplices. So, for example, if you have this, if you just have m is three, then the only missing simplex is two, three, and one, two three. So you would have that ik is generated by v two, v three, and then v one, v two, v three. Even though you really only have to add the minimal ones. You don't need this one formally.
00:07:55.690 - 00:08:32.700, Speaker B: That's what you could write it as generated by. Okay, but you also need, not just that, but as we saw, the degrees are important here. So we need something to keep track of the degrees. So we also have phi, which is a map from m into two times the natural numbers. All I mean is that the degree of each vertex is supposed to be even. That's all I'm saying by this, into two n, it's supposed to be even. And then we would have a corresponding thing which would be sr, which I'll sometimes denote as Srk.
00:08:32.700 - 00:09:13.950, Speaker B: Or if I want to emphasize the dependence on the degrees, I'll say Srk phi. And that's a graded algebra. And we really want to ask when are these realizable? When are these particular graded algebras realizable? Okay, right. So the polynomial thing is going to be a special case of this. And of course it's, it's a for corresponding to the full simplex. And of course it's already quite complicated, so we probably can't expect to solve this in full generality. I would say maybe there's some optimists, but I'm maybe too much of a pessimist, but I think it's a difficult problem.
00:09:13.950 - 00:10:15.576, Speaker B: It's maybe possible, but let's do an example. So examples of these would be Davis Yaniskiewicz spaces, but so example. So if we have that for every I, the value of phi is two or four. So we have that, well phi of I, the degrees of the generators is two or four. We get that it's realizable. Well, and of course, what would it be? People may know this already, but basically if you take xi is equal to either cp infinity when phi I is equal to two. So for degree two generators and hp infinity when phi I is equal to four, then you're going to get that s r k.
00:10:15.576 - 00:10:53.200, Speaker B: Phi is isomorphic to the polyhedral product, the corresponding polyhedral product, which would be h, the cohomology of x, comma point, upper k. And I didn't write the coefficients because we're always working over the integers. Okay, so that's an example you can get if you just have generators in degree two or four. You can solve this problem just with polyhedral products. Right, I'll mention that. Yeah, I'll mention that. You can extend this a little bit.
00:10:53.200 - 00:12:06.504, Speaker B: So this corresponds to so if you look at SRK, that corresponds to polynomial algebras a one up to am modulo I, where I is square free monomial, right. And perhaps this problem in general is within reach. But if you go and take away the square free and you just take monomials, then this problem has also been solved when the degrees are two and four by work of Trevisan or BBCG also had an alternative proof of this. I think they only maybe did it in degree with the generators in degree two. But the proof, at least Trevisan's proof, will work also when the generators are in degree two or four. Right. But in general, if you take away the square and just look at, and you modify monomials, this problem is, if you look at it a little bit, you can see that this problem is going to probably be completely out of reach to solve in general.
00:12:06.504 - 00:12:49.658, Speaker B: So adding the square free condition makes it somewhat more within reach. Okay, the next thing is if, let's say we have a certain condition. So now we're looking. So again, I'm considering, we're considering mostly the case of SrK phi. Okay, so that's the case we're interested in for the rest of the talk. And some special cases of that have already been solved by Takeda. So I'll just say what the conditions are for that vitae is if the degrees of the generators are, okay, so this is a condition whenever the degrees of the generators are powers of two and they're equal to each other.
00:12:49.658 - 00:14:07.240, Speaker B: Oh, I should put k are powers of two and k is bigger than two, so at least four. And of course, if, then if I is not equal to j, this is a requirement you need that vitae is equal to zero. Okay, so with this condition, right, products of generators that are of the same degree and powers of two are zero, then the problem was solved by Takeda. So he classifies, this is a reasonably recent paper in AGT. He classifies realizable SrK phi. And just to give you, without going into details of the classification, I can just kind of quickly give you some examples and kind of, some reasoning about how it, how the work, how the proof goes. So for example, if you have something like this, if you have a k like this, four and six, right? So that would be, basically, that would be z.
00:14:07.240 - 00:14:41.640, Speaker B: So here again, I'm writing the degrees as the subscripts. So that would be v four, v six, modulo v four, v six. This is not realizable. This is not realizable, but this one, if you go like this, four, six, eight. This, this is realizable. So that would be v four, v six, v six, v eight. And then you just mod out by v six, v eight.
00:14:41.640 - 00:15:28.520, Speaker B: The reason this is not realizable comes from a steenrod algebra obstruction. This algebra cannot be given a, an algebra structure over this unstable steenrod algebra, whereas this one can. And you can actually, the way you can see kind of in the picture, this is going to be a homotopy push out. This corresponds to the space realizing this would be a homotopy push out. So it's like a colimb, but it's really a hoco limb of a diagram where you'd have the corresponding things. So you'd have here you'd have HP infinity or BSU two. Then you'd have BSu three, BSu three and BsP two.
00:15:28.520 - 00:15:41.522, Speaker B: And then if you take this homotopy co limit and you take the comology of that, you'll get this. This Stanley Reisner algebra. Yes, please.
00:15:41.716 - 00:15:50.930, Speaker A: When you take the polyhedral product using those three algebra, you don't get any examples of the lubricant.
00:15:52.350 - 00:16:11.020, Speaker B: The example like this construction here. Yeah. When it's two or four, you're only. I mean, the thing is that. Okay, let's say you tried to do this instead of with CP Infinity and HP infinity, you did this with some of the other lie groups. Right. What's going to happen is you're going to have a whole bunch of generators that you might not want.
00:16:11.020 - 00:16:33.776, Speaker B: Right. Because to get a degree eight generator, you'd also need a degree four generator or a degree four and six generator, but you might not want those. Yeah. They're all linked, so you can't get rid of those. So you could take polydral products of these things, but you're going to get some SRK, but not all. So you have to kind of find a way of gluing them together and. Yeah.
00:16:33.776 - 00:16:57.330, Speaker B: And you could do it like this with a homotopy co limit. And that's like. So takeda kind of did this in a systematic way with some conditions and then showed that, yeah. Using this Dean dot algebra doesn't exist in all other cases, but only when we have these conditions here. Okay. In particular, you have products of the degree four generators are zero. Right.
00:16:57.330 - 00:17:15.872, Speaker B: Okay, so now. Yes, please. Yeah. You mean the non realizability side of it. Yeah. So I mean the non realizability side of it. What you do is because this is a torsion free algebra.
00:17:15.872 - 00:17:36.612, Speaker B: So you know that when you tensor with z mod two, you'll get an algebra over z mod two, and then that has to have an action of the steenrod algebra. And then you can show that it doesn't this one in particular say, but also all the other examples. But yeah, you do tensor with z mod two, the comology with z mod two, and then look at the serial algebra on that, not on the comalg with z coefficients.
00:17:36.796 - 00:17:37.588, Speaker C: Okay, thanks.
00:17:37.684 - 00:17:48.520, Speaker B: Any other questions? Yeah, probably, I mean. Yeah, which, I mean you. Yeah. Yes, that's true.
00:17:50.180 - 00:17:53.524, Speaker A: So, no, the obstructions to realizability depend on the prime.
00:17:53.652 - 00:18:21.070, Speaker B: Yes. And also, if you look at the Anderson Grote result, if you look at it prime at a time, it becomes much more complicated. So to do everything I'm doing, you could probably do similar things. We haven't done this, but that's like another thing that people could look at, which would be very interesting. I think you could look at this one prime at a time. And I guess it would become much more complicated because the classification of P compact groups at primes, as opposed to all over ones that all fit together over z are much more complicated.
00:18:22.860 - 00:18:27.880, Speaker A: You can't eliminate the mod degrees if you work over mod two.
00:18:30.580 - 00:18:50.564, Speaker B: So you're eliminating anything where the a's didn't have an even degree because you're over the integers. You do that mod two, you'd have to consider a's which had odd degrees as well. Right. So we're kind of working, we're strongly using the fact that we're not working over that. It's not realizability over z mod two. Over z mod two, you'd have odd degrees. And that makes it considerably more complicated.
00:18:50.564 - 00:19:01.320, Speaker B: That also comes up in torque topology. Right. The even degree, only even degrees makes things a lot easier. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Okay.
00:19:04.980 - 00:19:25.662, Speaker C: When you're doing the k of j construction, maybe there's a map from the Stanley ring of k of j phi, which would be you like you put degree, I mean, you double phi, I divided by two each vertex, kind of. Maybe this goes to the Stanley Reiner ring of k phi, I think.
00:19:25.726 - 00:20:00.488, Speaker B: So this is kind of related to this thing of polarization, polarization that was used. I mean, you're not, you're not going to get a general, a general result. You can see that some things are just not realizable. So you're not going to get a general result. Okay. So now I just want to talk about the problem that I'm actually is the version of this problem that we're looking at in our joint work. So we're kind of stopping we're no longer having.
00:20:00.488 - 00:20:25.410, Speaker B: We want to look at what happens when we don't have that condition. But we want to look at the simplest possible case of that. Say, that's non trivial. So the next case. The next case is. Okay, so we're going to have that phi to the minus one of four is bigger than one. So we're going to have more than one.
00:20:25.410 - 00:20:34.710, Speaker B: This. If you just have one degree four generator. It kind of fits more into that. And so. Right. And we're going to have. So it's going to look like something like this.
00:20:34.710 - 00:20:46.670, Speaker B: V four. And then v four prime. So two generators in degree four. But we're going to have. With some other generators here. And then we're going to have that. Well, v four.
00:20:46.670 - 00:21:04.340, Speaker B: V four primed is not zero. So this would not fit into that setup there. Right. That condition requires that if you have two degree four generators, their product has to be zero. So we're looking at the case where that's not zero. And so we're going to make further assumptions. So assume.
00:21:04.340 - 00:21:27.134, Speaker B: Assume. Assume the degrees of the generators. So, vi, the degree of that is four or six. We're only looking at degree four or six generators. And not only that, but the relations are all of a particular kind. They're only really all triple relations between sixes are there. Okay, maybe I'll just write it out.
00:21:27.134 - 00:21:41.922, Speaker B: Okay, so we have that, vij. So we don't have any relations. If. Yeah, if. Actually, this is not quite right. But anyway, so if, vi. Right.
00:21:41.922 - 00:22:05.960, Speaker B: So only relations. Okay, so maybe I should put it like this. So the relations are. Vij. Vk is equal to zero. If the degrees. If phi of I equals phi of j equals phi of K.
00:22:05.960 - 00:22:46.640, Speaker B: And of course, they're distinct. I, j, k, distinct. Okay, so you always have that triple relation. And the only other relations. The only other relations are relations. Quadratic relations between the sixes. So other relations are of form.
00:22:46.640 - 00:23:08.332, Speaker B: Vijay is equal to zero. Where the I and the j are of degree six. So these are the only relation. So in other words, there's no relations. So you have. Everything is generated in degree four and six. There's no relations between the fours and the sixes.
00:23:08.332 - 00:23:27.490, Speaker B: Or between amongst the fours. There's only relations between the sixes. All triple relations between the sixes are there. So you don't have any. Any two simplices. And all the other relations are just quadratic between the sixes. Whoops.
00:23:27.490 - 00:24:51.790, Speaker B: Sorry, I lost my place. There we go. Okay, so this information is actually the same as a graph on this degree six vertices. Okay, this is same information is the same of as is a graph, graph g, which I could write as g of k depending on the simplest k width vertices whose vertices with vertices phi to the minus one of six. So in other words, the vertices are all the degree six generators and an edge, and an edge, an edge, if vintage vj is not zero, right? If it's zero, then you don't have the edge just like this. Normal Stanley Reisner relations. Okay, so you can write it as a graph and then, right, so another way to say this is you could write it like this, you could write it as essentially k.
00:24:51.790 - 00:25:44.636, Speaker B: K would be equal to a simplex of degree, which would be the size, the degree, the number of degree four generators minus one. And then you would join with this graph. That would be, that would be another way of describing the simplicial complex. Okay, and so you were looking at Srk of such k, okay, right. So then for a graph, for a graph g, g is equal to ve. So I'll just, I'll maintain this notation throughout the talk. So that's vertices and edges we have that chi of g is the chromatic number, chromatic number, right.
00:25:44.636 - 00:26:33.850, Speaker B: So it's the least number of colors you need for a coloring of ghdev, right. So if you have like, yes, so this would be like this one, you could do it, you know, red, red and white. So here we would have chi of g equals two. But if you have something like this, you'd need three colors and say x, red, x, and so chi of g would be equal to three. Okay, so it's the chromatic number. And so this is related, realizability is related to the chromatic number of this graph. So essentially this follows more or less from what Takeda did, but just, you can express it this way in terms of graph theory, which is theorem.
00:26:33.850 - 00:27:54.100, Speaker B: Theorem is that if the chromatic number of this graph is of g of k is less than or equal to the number of degree four generators. This is basically to Cata. Then you get that this SRDH k, phi is realizable, okay? Right. So you can, so the realizability is associated to the chromatic number. So how about the converse? So yeah, we don't know if the converse is true or not, but we can't show the converse, but we can show something somewhat weaker. To show the weaker thing, we have to introduce a different notion of coloring, which we call span coloring, which will give a, right, so this kind of gives, this gives like an upper bound for the number of degree four generators you need. Now I'm going to give you a lower bound for the number of degree four generators you need.
00:27:54.100 - 00:28:52.150, Speaker B: It's again a, some homotopy co limit of, it's just going to be of, of Hp infinities and BSu two s, Bsu three s, a homotopic colloid constructed from the graph. Okay, so I'm gonna mention span coloring now. So, so we introduced a new kind of coloring, or we believe it's a new kind of coloring. We did look for this in on for some time and couldn't find anything like it. This would be a span coloring. We can do this over any ring or over any field, but I'm just going to talk about this span coloring over z mod two. So we have, again, we have our graph with, I wrote the notation for graph.
00:28:52.150 - 00:29:29.842, Speaker B: It's vetted. So an n span coloring, an n, well, I could say z two. Span coloring of g is a map, is a map. You label things now by, not colors but by vectors in z mod two to the n. So the n span coloring says what the dimension is of the vector space that you label. Bye. And the condition, of course there's a condition that would be too easy if it was just like that.
00:29:29.842 - 00:30:11.132, Speaker B: So that, well, the condition is that for every vertex, for every vertex of the graph, v and e, there, if you look at, if you look at this, the span of all the values, okay, so the value at v cannot be in the Spanish. The link of v. Of span of phi. Of the link of v. Can you read that, Martin? The phi, yes. Okay, thank you. And, oh, higher, higher.
00:30:11.132 - 00:30:36.480, Speaker B: Sorry, sorry. Good, good. Okay, good, good. Okay, excellent. Right, so, yeah, and of course the link, you know, this is all vertices adjacent to van. Vertices adjacent. Okay, so I guess since I have to leave this here, I'll go over to the next board.
00:30:36.480 - 00:31:19.150, Speaker B: Okay, so that's a span coloring. And then of course you can get a span chromatic number in the same way that you get a chromatic number. You want the smallest, the least and such that there's a span coloring. Okay. And then you can define the span chromatic number. Yeah, so you get an associated chromatic number. So you could say z mod two span chromatic number of G is the least NDE, least n such that g has an n span coloring.
00:31:19.150 - 00:32:08.642, Speaker B: Okay, so that's the, what I'd call the span chromatic number of G. And clearly, clearly phi of G. Okay, maybe I should put clearly in quotes. I mean, this really is clearly, but phi of G is bigger than or equal to z mod two span phi of G. Okay, now why is. Because, you know, you can always, you can just use the standard basis vectors and just color by standard basis vectors, one for each color. And that will show you that from that you can get that this is true.
00:32:08.642 - 00:32:22.346, Speaker B: Okay. So I'll take off the quotes. It is clearly. Okay. Okay. And then the other thing is that actually. Okay, so this, I won't really have time to talk about this, probably, but there exists a g.
00:32:22.346 - 00:33:11.550, Speaker B: There exists a g with this not equal. So these two things are not equal to each other already for n equals three. Okay. They're not equal to each other. Okay. And the relation with Steenrod's problem is through the Steenrod algebra, which is kind of the main theorem I'm talking about, I guess, is that theorem. And this is with Takeda, which is that if we tensor SRK phi and we tensor with z mod two, that has a Steven Rod algebra action.
00:33:11.550 - 00:34:07.868, Speaker B: And I mean unstable, you know, satisfying the unstable condition. Unstable Steenrod algebra action. That happens if and only if the span coloring, the chromatic span chromatic number z two span chi of g is less than or equal to. Again, it depends on the number of degree four generators, phi to the minus one of four, the number of degree four generators. Okay. So if you compare that to this, right? So if the number of degree four generators is bigger than the chromatic number, you get realization. And if the number of degree four generators is bigger than the span chromatic number, you get a Steenrod algebra action.
00:34:07.868 - 00:34:50.380, Speaker B: Okay, so this implies kind of a partial converse to that result there. Yes. Yeah. Basically, I mean, if that's what you do, is you say, I mean, it's kind of the other way around. You show that if it's less than this, then you find a way of constructing a sternought algebra action. Well, the unstable. Yes, the unstable condition is important.
00:34:50.380 - 00:35:36.594, Speaker B: Yes. Right. Are there any other questions? Yeah, that would be nice, but we don't, that's actually kind of what we write. So the question is, so I can repeat it and then, I mean, I don't, do I need them? I already have a microphone. Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, Tony's question was, yeah, do we have any examples? Wherever it has a steroid algebra action, but is not realizable.
00:35:36.594 - 00:35:48.954, Speaker B: So that's, yeah, that's kind of the main question. Are there such examples or not? Yes. Why don't you come down, Martin, in.
00:35:48.962 - 00:35:55.642, Speaker A: The Hoffenvarin one problem, if you just look at the Steenhardt algebra, you just get the condition on the generators as a power of two.
00:35:55.746 - 00:35:56.218, Speaker B: Yes.
00:35:56.314 - 00:35:59.482, Speaker A: But they're not realizable, obviously, for the higher altitude.
00:35:59.586 - 00:36:25.514, Speaker B: Yes. Right. So that's more relevant because we're only agreeing with this. This is more relevant for Takeda. So Takeda has this result, what I said, where you have to have squares equal to, you know, if two things are in the same degree, same power of two degree, their product has to be zero. The reason he bumps into that problem when he, in his classification result, this won't really be a problem here because we only have degree four and degree circumflex six generators. There's no higher generators.
00:36:25.514 - 00:37:41.094, Speaker B: So really all that matters here is square two and square four. Okay, so then as a corollary of that result is that sk sr k phi is realizable. Realizable implies that z mod two, this chromatic span coloring, chromatic span, chromatic number z two, span chi of g, it has to be less than phi minus one of four. And of course there's a gap here. So, you know, because here we would have, if it's actually less than this bigger number, sorry, this smaller number, I guess, right, then, then you get realizability. And the interesting thing is, what is the gap between these two things? Right. And, yeah, okay, so I was just going to say, related to that, related to the gap is, so we can define, as I mentioned before, we can define this over any ring.
00:37:41.094 - 00:38:28.880, Speaker B: So you can, you can take, so really this, this might be, this, this span chromatic number might be something interesting in graph theory. One way that it might be interesting would be that, well, we have that this is bigger than sort of, we can define a z, something over z span chromatic number in a similar way. And this would be equal. This would be actually bigger. We know that this one is strictly bigger than the z two one, but this would actually be bigger than the supremum over all p of z mod p, spanish chromatic numbers of G. And we would ask, well, okay, so this, can this be equal? Are these equal? Can, yeah. Is this equal? And now we're taking a supremum.
00:38:28.880 - 00:39:05.078, Speaker B: So we don't know if this is equal. Is that equal? Is that equal? I guess I don't need quotes here. Is that equal? Is that equal? Of course, that would be kind of something that I would call too good to be true. That would mean that you can reduce kind of problems of coloring a graph, graph coloring problems, chromatic number problems to this localizations of them to local problems. And you would have turning graph theory into kind of a localized thing. So this would be too good to be true, I think. But it was still an interesting question.
00:39:05.078 - 00:39:43.566, Speaker B: Are these different or are they the same? And, yeah, so this also might be interesting from the point of view of graph theory. One other thing, since I still have five minutes. Is that right? Yeah. Okay. So one other thing I wanted to talk about is I can talk a little bit more about the, right, so one thing we do a little bit about the proof. So basically the idea is that the proof of this goes that. Yeah, so we construct, if you have a span coloring, you can find an explicit way of getting a Steenrod algebra action.
00:39:43.566 - 00:40:58.330, Speaker B: And then if you have a Steenrod algebra action, you can get a span coloring. It's not some, it's a constructive, it's a somewhat constructive thing. There's some choices at one stage in the construction, but it's a constructive procedure. The other thing is we construct a, so there exists some, there exists a graph, a graph which is, which we will call an such that. So you can also realize this as a graph homomorphism problem. So there exists a graph an such that g hom g comma an is hom gan is not empty if and only if g has an n span coloring. So this is kind of an analog of the result for normal colorings where you have that hom g, if you take the complete graph on n letters, that this is not empty if and only if g has a coloring.
00:40:58.330 - 00:41:35.222, Speaker B: G has a coloring and n coloring. G has an n coloring. So, and then this is actually the graph that we use to. Right. So it's an analog with the normal. Yeah, so colorings correspond to homomorphisms from g into this graph, and n span colorings correspond to homomorphisms from g into this other graph that we construct. The other thing is we found that, but we don't actually know the chromatic number of that, but we know that the chromatic number of.
00:41:35.222 - 00:42:06.370, Speaker B: So if we take chi of an, so of a three, of course there's one of these for every z mod p. So chi of a three, we don't know actually if it's four or five, right? So it's kind of bigger. This is what shows that the, showing that it's not three shows that the two chromatic numbers are different. But we actually don't know. We only have a five coloring. We don't actually have a four coloring. So probably there's a four coloring, but we don't know.
00:42:06.370 - 00:42:48.986, Speaker B: So that's kind of another problem you could look at is you know, what is, what is, what is, what is, you know, what is the chromatic number of all of these? An and similarly for different primes. So we have a result kind of like this for different primes, that it's not always the same. For every prime, there's always some n for which they're different. You get different, it doesn't agree. The number here doesn't agree with a chromatic number. But yeah, we don't know how to compute the chromatic number of these graphs. It's kind of like, I think it has like 28 vertices or something like that.
00:42:48.986 - 00:43:20.976, Speaker B: So, no, I could draw, it kind of looks like something like this locally. It's like, it's something like this. And then that kind of wraps around on itself. It has a bunch of, it can be covered by a bunch of. All of the an can be covered by a bunch of kn's. It has a covering by. And that's kind of how the proof of the difference goes, that it's not, that this is not equal to three.
00:43:20.976 - 00:43:38.662, Speaker B: We do some kind of counting argument. But if there's a map into k three, then you count something and the numbers don't add up. So you get, that's how you prove that they're different. But yeah, so it looks like something that's covered by kns in general. And this would be what a three looks like. But of course it goes out more than that.
00:43:38.766 - 00:43:40.250, Speaker A: So thanks.
00:43:42.350 - 00:43:44.270, Speaker B: I guess that's the end of my talk.
