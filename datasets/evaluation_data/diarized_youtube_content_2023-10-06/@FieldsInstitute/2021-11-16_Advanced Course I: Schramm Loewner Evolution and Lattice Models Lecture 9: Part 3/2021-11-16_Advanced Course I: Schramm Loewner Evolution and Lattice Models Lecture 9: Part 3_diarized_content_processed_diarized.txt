00:00:03.200 - 00:01:31.004, Speaker A: Okay, welcome back. So now we are finishing the proof of the key estimate. So, this is the key estimate, and it relies on our theorem, which allows us to estimate expected value of derivative well normalized by something at time, at stop time t zero. So, well, at the time where imaginary part of Gt is equal to one. But of course it cannot be rescaled, because again, we know that Gt satisfies brownian scaling, so we can do the rescaling of everything. And after the dust settles, this would be the expectation of rescale things, the expectation of g prime at the moment tj. So when you reach j to the power, this is just bounded f by f, but not of z, but e to the minus j times z, because again, because of brown risk.
00:01:31.004 - 00:02:12.144, Speaker A: Okay, so let me now finish the computations. We want to estimate the probability that this event will happen. Then, when imaginary part of Gt is something e to the minus j. So when imaginary part is two to minus j, derivative is bigger than delta over y. This is the same as, I'm just rewriting it. Probability that this to the a times y to the a times delta minus a is bigger equals than one. And we can just use Chebyshev, that it's bounded by the expectation of this guy.
00:02:12.144 - 00:03:10.744, Speaker A: Aha. This is very, very familiar thing. So this is bounded by delta to the a, e to the minus j here, f of e to the minus j times z. So this probability of seven that we want, this is, now let's write what this is. So we rewrite it down, and the only factors, okay, so here it's not minus, it's plus. Because you see, that was minus here, this would be the sum e to the j a minus lambda. And after you sum it up, and remembering that you start with log delta, you would get exactly this estimate.
00:03:10.744 - 00:03:56.918, Speaker A: And again, everything would depend on whether a is bigger than lambda or smaller than lambda. If a is smaller than lambda, there would be something interesting. If a is bigger than lambda, it just would be some constant. And for a equal to lambda, well, you just. There would be log delta here. So exactly as I promised you, and we are done here. Okay, so this was all technical, and I was actually hesitating whether to include this in the course, but I thought that at some moment you should see the how it's done technically, because otherwise it looks like it's all pulled out of the.
00:03:56.918 - 00:05:03.124, Speaker A: It's a rabbit pulled out of the head. So I will try to avoid these technical details like I just. Okay, similar to what we did before, but again, crucial things in all these proofs, we try get rid of dependence of t by considering some stopping times, and then seeing that nothing changes much in the stopping times. And then for fixed stocking times, all our estimates actually rely on distortion theorems. But this will be null and void without this exciting observation that this expectation can be computed precisely, that it's equal to exactly this. And that was eta calculus. So you do something, you do some observation for some quantity, which you can compute precisely using intercalculus, and then you do all this technical stuff that I described.
00:05:03.124 - 00:05:59.664, Speaker A: Again, notice that even with this tedious calculation, that this was the calculation which I didn't do, of course. So I didn't show you how to make sure that quadrant quadratic variation disappears here. But that's actually very, very easy. It's an exercise for students. So the name of the game in SL actually will find the martingale and see what you can do with it. Again, there are other methods, of course. And what I want to talk next is what I already promised you is that description of behavior of sla kappa.
00:05:59.664 - 00:06:38.974, Speaker A: So, validate is a curve. But remember, I said it would be a curve from zero to infinity. What I really don't want to have is some curve which goes back and forth, back and forth, and never reaches infinity. So it just goes around. So is it curve to infinity? And actually it is. And so, let me describe this in the following theorem. So what is oscillocapy? This is very different curves for different kappas.
00:06:38.974 - 00:07:30.862, Speaker A: First of all, for Kappa less or equal than four, this is the easiest tool, understand? This is just a simple curve which tends to infinity as time tends to plus infinity. Now, for copper, between four and eight, things do change. The curve becomes self touching and it generates growing holes. So the curve would look, and let me remind you, it would look here as something like that. Of course, it will touch itself many times and maybe touch real line and so on. Kappa T would be. Sorry.
00:07:30.862 - 00:08:23.684, Speaker A: Rather, kt would be whatever is eaten up up to the time t. So, this compact, we already discussed such terms, and I claim that this compact covers the whole plane. So this is totally different behavior. Our curve, it doesn't, if you have a fixed point, it's probability one. It doesn't hit it, but it will be swallowed eventually by one of this compact k. So they would be growing, and eventually they would cover the whole closed half plane. Can I take the closure of the hull? But the most interesting thing happens when kappa is at least eight.
00:08:23.684 - 00:09:27.724, Speaker A: Here, this is a space filling curve, which covers the whole edge. Meaning that it visits every point of the plane of the extent, actually a closed plane. So it visits just all of them and covers everything and goes to infinity. So it covers bigger and bigger blob. So that's what happened. When kappa is bigger, equals. Okay, and so now how do we prove it? And here, remember, at some moment when we started basel processes, I told you that sle is, in a sense, complex version of Bessel process.
00:09:27.724 - 00:10:23.206, Speaker A: Let us do just the change of time and space to see that this is what it is. So we can set a new function, HTML, which would be our sla process, but taken at the time dt over kappa. And let's subtract brown and bt. So this is something very similar to what we discussed in the beginning of. Well, so here we took ft hat, which was ft of z plus psi. Here we kind of do the opposite. We do gt minus driving function, and we change time to t over kappa.
00:10:23.206 - 00:10:50.486, Speaker A: Let's take the derivative. So, thanks. So just take the derivative here. Instead of two, it would become two over kappa. We change the time to over kappa, gt kappa of z minus bt, dt minus DBT. But this is, it's h t. So this is two over kappa ht of the minus DBT.
00:10:50.486 - 00:11:49.208, Speaker A: And the law wouldn't change if we change brownian motion with minus brownian motion. So it satisfies this to over kappa, hc of z plus DBT. And why is it a Bessel process? Let's remember the definition of Bessel process. So this is exactly the same. D x, t is DBT plus a over x. So here we see that if we start at a real number and stay on the real line, then this is simply a Bessel process. So if z is real, and we write it for this real z, then we are simply describing a Bessel process.
00:11:49.208 - 00:12:33.186, Speaker A: So here in general, we start at z, which is not on the real line. And that. Well, but that wouldn't stop us from studying the properties of this. And this is defined up to the first time that we hit zero. It's still the same as for real case. So ht is defined for t less or equal than t and more than that. If t is less than tz, then z plus bt belongs to the corresponding domain.
00:12:33.186 - 00:13:02.794, Speaker A: So this is, remember, it's component of infinity of h minus the beginning of the curve. So we already know that sl is generated by a curve. We just don't know what type of curve it would be. And now we'll describe it. Okay. And so now the reminder about Bessel processes. So, if we start at a point which is real.
00:13:02.794 - 00:13:58.734, Speaker A: Then, when k is less or equal than four, kappa less or equal than four, it corresponds to the case a. Remember, this is two over kappa bigger equals than one half. This means that tx is equal infinity, almost surely. So, almost surely, no point of the real line is touched by our curve, or is followed by our curve. When cap is bigger than four, every point of the real line would eventually be swallowed. And when kappa is bigger equals than eight, which corresponds to a less or equal than one quarter, they all swallowed a different time. But when kappa is between four and eight, sometimes with positive probability, they would be swallowed together.
00:13:58.734 - 00:14:54.524, Speaker A: And finally, when kappa is less than four, almost surely info of h t of x would be zero. And here let me write absolute value, because I consider negative x is two, but it's symmetric. So these are all restatements of the exciting theorem we had about Bessel processes. So where is it? Here's our theorem. And that what we will be using. And now to the proof. As I wrote here, let's start with the case k less or equal.
00:14:54.524 - 00:15:57.368, Speaker A: Let's look at x, which is not zero. It means that for every x, t is never on, would be never hit. And here I realize that it's better to write one more implication. So this, of course, means that x does not belong to the kt for every t less than infinity, which means that x does not belong to the gamma. So this is somewhat, well, it's an easy statement, but it's something which I should have commented. So there is zero, there is x. So you never belong to KT.
00:15:57.368 - 00:17:06.484, Speaker A: So of course you never. So kt is gamma together with some other components. So it means that you are not belonging to gamma, surely. So gamma does not intersect real line outside of zero. So you start at zero, you start evolving. You never intersect real line because no point, if you would intersect real line, this point x would be hit infinite time. And now use the mind Markov property for all rational r probability that gamma, you take gamma from r to infinity and you apply Gr to it.
00:17:06.484 - 00:17:55.724, Speaker A: This is by domain Markov property. This is the solid. So let me draw a picture here. So you run up to r, and then you run further. And then I mapped it by jar, this thing by domain marker probes, which we know is sla kappa with the same kappa. And this curve does not intersect real line. So for each fixed r probability that this intersect real line is zero.
00:17:55.724 - 00:18:41.090, Speaker A: So it's true for all rational r. So it's true that for all rational r, Gr of gamma R infinity doesn't intersect real lines, but it means that gamma infinity doesn't intersect gamma zero r. Because after, if they did intersect somewhere here, then take the image. This image on the same jar would intersect real lines. That's impossible. So for all rational numbers, if you cut it at any moment, this past and future don't intersect. So suppose that now it's not a simple curve.
00:18:41.090 - 00:19:42.584, Speaker A: Suppose that for some t one, t two, gamma of t one is equal to gamma of t two. Then there exists some rational number between them for which gamma of s is not gamma of t one. And then we see that past. And so, and, well, I forgot to write that s should be between t one and t two. So you can find such guy, because if they were all the same k of t one would be k of t two. And you know that half plane capacity of t two, it's two t two, it's bigger than two t one. So for some rational number in between, gamma of s should not be equal to gamma of t one.
00:19:42.584 - 00:20:22.274, Speaker A: So which means that gamma of zero s intersect gamma of s infinity. But that doesn't happen. We know that for our curve, past and future don't intersect. So what we just proved, we proved that our gamma is injective. So it is a simple curve. Okay, so we almost done this case kappa less or equal than four, except that we need the following statement. Well, we need to show that gamma of t goes to infinity.
00:20:22.274 - 00:21:16.530, Speaker A: Well, that would follow from the following claim. Suppose that, well, kappa is between zero and four. Then probability that there exists some real number and sequence of times such that gamma of t n goes to x, it's equal to zero. So the probability that you approach a point on the real line infinitely often, so you can hit it, you know that, but you can approach it infinitely often. That actually is zero. Okay, I'll prove it. But, well, I'll do the complete proof for kappa less than four.
00:21:16.530 - 00:22:14.214, Speaker A: And then I will indicate what to do for kappa equals to four. So this exciting condition can be restated as distance from x to gamma is equal to zero, right? So this is the same. And so by scaling and symmetry, we just can assume that x is between one and one plus epsilon for some positive epsilon. Because again, if this probability would be bigger than zero for sum x, we can rescale x to be arbitrary close to one. And then by symmetry we can assume that x is positive. And let us look at some delta which is less than one four. And let this be the first time.
00:22:14.214 - 00:23:10.112, Speaker A: Then distance between gamma of t is less or equal than delta. So this is the first time, um, closer to delta. And vf course, as always, assumes that in theorem of anti citizen. So if you never approach your interval from one to one plus epsilon, fine, but let us approach it. Okay, now here's an important observation. Let us look at our picture here. So we have our curve.
00:23:10.112 - 00:24:03.614, Speaker A: It approached for the first time, delta neighborhood of the interval epsilon. Let's do h sigma delta. And this point would be mapped to zero. And this point would be mapped to h sigma delta of one half. Okay, now let us look at the r delta, by definition, would be interval from zero to one half, plus this whole right hand side of the curve gamma from zero to sigma delta. Now let's see what happens. Here we have a cross cut of diameter less equal than delta.
00:24:03.614 - 00:24:49.444, Speaker A: By Lavrentia theorem, it means that the diameter of this part, h sigma delta of this, is bounded by c times square root of delta. Again, we here, I'm cheating a little bit, because Lavrentiv theorem, as I proved it, was for maps of the unit disk. And this is not quite the unit disk, but we can map everything to the unit disk. All distortions are bounded. So h sigma delta of one half to zero. So the length of this interval is less than c square root of delta. So which means that h sigma delta of one half tends to zero.
00:24:49.444 - 00:25:31.464, Speaker A: But this is a different stopping times for process ht of one half. And this is a real number. So this is h t of one half should tend to zeros. But that cannot happen when capital less than four, because we know that infinium of h sigma delta, this is big or equal than in femur for h the surely bigger than zero. So that's a contradiction. So that does not happen. This event that I just described, that your curve approaches close and closer to the interval epsilon, that just doesn't happen.
00:25:31.464 - 00:26:43.974, Speaker A: Distance to zero. So now, if you use fine estimates on harmonic measure, you can actually do the same way k scalp equal to four. Well, by finite estimates, I mean the same level interfere estimates, but you do them more precisely. So you also, essentially, you look at this part and you compare h sigma delta of one quarter here, and you see that actually this would be exponentially smaller than this because this opening is so small that, you know, the fact that this is much closer to the tip would already make this part. Sorry. Not this exponentially close. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
00:26:43.974 - 00:27:30.804, Speaker A: H Sigma delta fan quarter. So this part actually would not be seen by harmonic measure. Because remember, this is eventually we are talking about harmonic measure we're talking about probabilities. That brownian motion came through here, and instead of hitting this part, hit here, instead of hitting all this stuff. And this actually would lead to a contradiction because we know that these two guys are not supposed to be that close. So. Well, again, I will skip the details for now, but it's just estimated harmonic measure.
00:27:30.804 - 00:28:25.844, Speaker A: Okay, now, using this claim, we can prove that gamma of t is indeed tends to infinity. Since half plane capacity of gamma t two t tends to infinity. Gamma T is unbounded because, well, if it would be bounded, its capacity would be bounded by the capacity of what it is bounded by. So there exists some tk, such as gamma of tk tends to infinity. And let c one be the first time that absolute value of gamma t is bigger than one. So unwrap it. So let's consider ht one.
00:28:25.844 - 00:29:00.634, Speaker A: And let's see, if you look at hd one, there are two prime ends here. This one and this one, which are mapped to two different points, x minus and x plus. So this is what map ht one does. It unwraps it. We already know that it's a simple curve. Kappa is less or equal than four. So we unwrap it here.
00:29:00.634 - 00:30:05.390, Speaker A: And so these are images under t one. So this gamma hat of t is independent sla kappa. By our claim infimum of distance between x minus x plus and gamma hat, it's positive. So gamma head cannot approach is x minus or x plus. So by Lavrenti theorem, almost surely they exist r such that for all t gamma of t, one plus t is bigger equals than r. So you never, you can return back, but you never, never approach zero again. Because again, otherwise shortcross cut means you approach x one, x minus or x plus.
00:30:05.390 - 00:31:05.844, Speaker A: And you dot. Okay, so using scaling, it means that for every n you can find rn which goes to zero size, that for every app probability z, they exist s bigger than t such that gamma of s is r and gamma of t is rnr. This is less than two to the minus n again, because probably psi char always exists. You can again take r small enough to make the probability that second hit is r and times some is two to the minus n. And then you use scale invariance. And now the usual spiel. Take rn equal to one rk equal rk minus one divided by little rk.
00:31:05.844 - 00:31:47.564, Speaker A: This rk goes to infinity. And when you hit rk, you would not hit rk minus one. This probability at least one minus two to the minus k. You sum it up, use barrel can tell you and you are done. You are attaining to infinity. So again here, I would not do this pesky details. Okay, so we are done with the case kappa less or equal.
00:31:47.564 - 00:33:00.304, Speaker A: So again, the key probabilistic estimate here, and the only probabilistic estimate here that we use was estimate on Bessel process, that for Bessel processes, all the solutions stay forever, stay for infinite time. And then we used domain Markov property and some very elementary complex analysis to just see that it implies that our curve actually would be simple. So it doesn't touch real line by the marker property, doesn't touch itself by Lavrentia, it tends to infinity and rescale. That's also important. Things get slightly more complicated when kappa is between four and eight. So here there would be some swallowing. So, a point in the extended half plane, each bar closed half plane, is called swallowed by family of growing halves, kt.
00:33:00.304 - 00:33:46.884, Speaker A: If z is in closure of KTC, but not in the union of KT up to this time. So let me draw you an example of swallowed point. So this is our curve. It goes and then it hits itself, and then it keeps going. So all the points here are swallowed again, because so this is our time, tz for all of them, for t less than tz, they are not in kftz. And suddenly you swallow them up. So that's what swallowed means.
00:33:46.884 - 00:34:26.698, Speaker A: And swallowed point on. So let me continue. If it hits here, then all these points, including these points on the real line. So these points on the real line, they all swallowed at this moment. No, they were not in the hull. And suddenly they swallowed by the hull altogether. Notice this characteristic proxy, what happened here? All these points were valid alive after this moment.
00:34:26.698 - 00:35:24.794, Speaker A: But then suddenly they got written together. Remember, that's characteristic property of exactly this regime of Basel processes, when kappa is between four and eight, or a is between one four and one half. Okay, so now just an observation. This h minus closure of the union of all this kt, it's relatively open in h hat, of course. So if z is swallowed. So it means that z is not an omega of tz. So it means that z belongs to a bounded component of this guy, h minus closure.
00:35:24.794 - 00:36:53.344, Speaker A: See? So you know, for example, here you are swallowed, this point is not solid, but all the points inside, they are suddenly in bounded component. This. So, well, just open set condition. If point is swallowed, then the existing neighborhood, which is also swallowed. So you never, so it's an open condition. Okay, more than that, all these points are swallowed at the same time as z, right? And as usual, we can take epsilon to be the distance from z to gamma, which would be the same as the distance from z to gamma zero infinity, because z belongs to one of the components of the complement of gamma of zero up to tz. So the closest point on the gamma would actually be point at the time before tz.
00:36:53.344 - 00:38:08.084, Speaker A: So this is the picture. If we have a swallowing, then all points. If point is followed, then all points which are closer to our point than gamma would also be swallowed at the same time. Okay, so now let's exploit the fact of what we know. We know that for all real x with nonzero probability, it's swallowed together with one other. Let us observe that probability that tx is equal to one t one is actually bounded by Markov property by probabilities that square root of n of x is eaten together with one to the power n. Well, because this suggests n once like this.
00:38:08.084 - 00:39:29.944, Speaker A: So we get that the probability that there exists x such that tx is equal to one is equal to one. Because again, if it won't exist, then we would immediately arrive to a point where the probability is zero, which again knows that this is possible again. So let x not would be the max or max ytx is equal to t one. Accidentally, this is just gamma of t one. So your this is next node is actually not a swallowed point, but all points before that are again. So let epsilon be the distance between one and gamma of zero t one. It's a positive number, because if it wouldn't be, then t one would be swallowed before by gamma.
00:39:29.944 - 00:40:23.796, Speaker A: So, okay, so we have swallowed 0.1. We know that one is followed with probability one. Then by our observation, before we know that for every w in the upper half plane, which is epsilon close to one, tw is equal to t one. So we immediately see that gamma is not space filling. We'll have a more precise manifestation of it next time. Now let us play with it a bit more. Let us introduce a new stopping time t prime, which would be the following.
00:40:23.796 - 00:41:33.632, Speaker A: If zero is not on the boundary k t one, then t prime just would be t one. Otherwise t prime would be defined as t one plus the time that gt of zero would be stopped by the gamma of t one infinity. So t gt prime of zero would be following time for gamma of, which is from t one to infinity. And here I should be more careful. This is not just any t. So this is gt one of zero, this following time of the one. And so we see that this actually this gt of zero is solved with probability one by scaling every point.
00:41:33.632 - 00:42:52.634, Speaker A: So one is solved with probability one, which means that every other fixed point is also solved with probability one. Now, distance from zero to this boundary is positive, almost surely. So again, that's why I wanted either this condition or the moment when it's followed. So what does it mean? So it means that for every delta you can find epsilon t, such that this probability bigger than one minus delta kt covers b of zero epsilon. So let me be much more careful h intersect this ball over. Let me be even more careful and not forget to turn off highlighting collider. So this happens with probability at least one minus delta.
00:42:52.634 - 00:44:08.644, Speaker A: Okay, so again, up to time kt prime, it swallowed some disk. So we know, okay, maybe up to time t prime, it's followed some disk of radius epsilon. This probability at least one minus delta over two. And then this probability one minus delta, another one minus delta over two, there was t prime was less or equal than t. So this ball would be swallowed in time t. So by scaling, this is true for any positive epsilon, which gives that the union of this closure of the union of kt is upper half plane, which is exactly. Well, actually it gives slightly more that union of the closures is h.
00:44:08.644 - 00:45:26.744, Speaker A: So eventually every point would get eaten, would get swallowed. But as we will see later, for any given point, the probability that it would be on the curve but not swallowed is zero. And this is somewhat finite. So that would come after we do case kappa bigger than eight. And so here, let me remind you that in this case, almost surely, if, say, y is bigger than x, bigger than zero, then tx is less than cy. So by symmetry, if x is not equal to y, then tx is not equal to y with probability one for fixed x and y. And then one thing here we see that there are no swallowed points on real line, because swallowing considerial line implies that tx is equal to ty for some different x and y.
00:45:26.744 - 00:46:47.344, Speaker A: But again, by doing exactly the same trick as we did for simple curves and looking at rational r, we see that there are no swallowed points anywhere. Because you see, if there are swallowed points here, then there is this self touching. And after you open it up, it means that your curve touched realign. It means that you are hitting, that a portion of your line is followed. And this again implies that kt, rather even close kt is just gamma of zero t. Nothing is followed, but every point on the curve eventually dies on the curve. This is the key word I'm trying to prove much more.
00:46:47.344 - 00:48:40.868, Speaker A: All we know is that curves, well, eventually touches every point on the real line. But what about complex plane? Would it really touch every point on the complex plane? Let's prove this. So now we are proving that the curve space fitting, and for this, we define distance from point x plus I to gamma of zero infinity. If you prove, and probably will do it next time, that for almost surely for all x, this distance is equal to zero, then it means that almost surely distance from z, from any point of the upper half plane to our Sla curve zero, there is no swelling. So this means that gamma would be a space filling curve, because, again. So, again, the details that I would skip here is that you again, can unwrap it and see that your point is almost on the real line, but it gets closer and closer there. So it means that it will be actually hit by the curve.
00:48:40.868 - 00:50:01.334, Speaker A: Distance to the curve is zero, and this curve is close. So now, how would the proof price it? Basically, we'll look at VU's curb, this area, and Schwarz Lemma to estimate this distance by something related to the derivative of corresponding Leonard map. We'll study this, and they will be estimates which are very similar to the estimates we used in the Professor Frodenscharm theorem. And eventually we'll get that, well, this distance is zero, but then we'll do more. We'll show that essentially, we'll describe the law of this distance for Kappa less than eight. And so if d of x is. Well, it's not quite, but it's like logarithm of the distance, then the moment of it, we would have precise form of it.
00:50:01.334 - 00:50:49.634, Speaker A: And again, this would be just an easy computation. And then we'll use what is called Feynman Katz formula to estimate D of x from there. And that would allow us to study Hausdorff dimension of slicoffs. But again, this is later. Next time, I promise. We start with the proof that SLA curve for kappa bigger equals than eight touches every point of the real line. So the distance from every point of the real line to SLa curve is zero.
