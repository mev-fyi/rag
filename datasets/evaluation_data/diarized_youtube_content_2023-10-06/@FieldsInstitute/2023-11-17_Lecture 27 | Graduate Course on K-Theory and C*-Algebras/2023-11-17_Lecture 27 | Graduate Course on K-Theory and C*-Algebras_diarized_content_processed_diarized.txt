00:00:00.800 - 00:00:19.622, Speaker A: Afternoon. This is accessible to everyone of this interview with Israel Halpern. But I thought. I thought you might be interested in.
00:00:19.678 - 00:00:20.274, Speaker B: Just.
00:00:22.254 - 00:00:24.446, Speaker A: Hearing a bit more about it.
00:00:24.470 - 00:00:25.034, Speaker B: Now.
00:00:35.804 - 00:01:06.642, Speaker A: Albert Tucker is asking Israel helper and who he took the courses from, whom he took courses from. And so by Eisenhart.
00:01:06.698 - 00:01:07.294, Speaker B: And.
00:01:10.074 - 00:01:43.214, Speaker A: Eisenhart, of course, I got rather fed up, in spite of the fact that Eisenhart was the dean and a stern looking gentleman. And I just didn't go to lectures after a few. The other courses were so casual that I sort of dropped out of them, too. I went to bone and blues lectures for a while. I had had most of the stuff from Professor William J. Wepper in Toronto. I met Professor Weber, but I didn't meet Professor Singh.
00:01:43.214 - 00:02:14.174, Speaker A: But the one person whose lectures I had not had before was von Neumann, and I wouldn't have missed any of that. What was he lecturing on that year? Well, I recall the story I heard later, someone who said to have asked Eugene Wigner how many people are familiar with the. With the name Eugene Vigner?
00:02:16.754 - 00:02:17.210, Speaker B: Just.
00:02:17.282 - 00:02:31.770, Speaker A: Just one. Just one person. Run into the name. He's Charlie. Jack, can you say what you know.
00:02:31.802 - 00:02:55.094, Speaker B: About contributions to quantum mechanics? There's, like, a bigger formula. Quantum mechanics, like, what are those distributions? Probability distribution. Like a way to represent. Okay.
00:02:58.274 - 00:03:32.230, Speaker A: One thing I still associated name with is the conservation laws and the idea that the idea of groups altogether. In mathematics. In mathematics applied to physics. In fact, here's an article you can look up just like this one, and you only have to look. It's the title of a paper professor.
00:03:32.262 - 00:03:33.274, Speaker B: Vigner wrote.
00:03:35.374 - 00:04:06.092, Speaker A: And it's famous enough paper just to type in the first two words. First word is not enough. First two important words. Then it comes up. I have to give you some word. I mean, type in vigor. It might come up, but w I g n e r.
00:04:06.092 - 00:04:22.504, Speaker A: But the paper. Some of you might have heard of it. Well, without even remembering the name of the author, it's the. Well, the first word is. Thus, I'm not counting that. The next two words are unreasonable effectiveness. The unreasonable effectiveness.
00:04:22.504 - 00:05:11.304, Speaker A: This is such a brilliant combination. Such a tricky combination of words. But there's a feeling. There's a workshop of guild institute this week on what's called free probability, closely related to one of the titles of one of the lectures. Begins with those words. Obviously, that's a quotation to reference. Okay, so what is the outlook? The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences?
00:05:13.364 - 00:05:14.944, Speaker B: That's the thought of the mistake.
00:05:22.014 - 00:06:12.838, Speaker A: And von Neumann were at school together. Okay, so someone is said to have asked Eugene Wigner, what is von Neumann lecturing on this year? Wigner replied, I don't know what he'll call it, but it will be Hilbert's basis. Well, von Neumann more or less invented Hilbert spaces. He's responsible for the oxymatic formulation of Hilbert's benzodiazepine. Yes, he was actually on a different.
00:06:12.886 - 00:06:14.686, Speaker B: Space on spectral theory.
00:06:14.870 - 00:06:46.502, Speaker A: How many people know the spectral theorem? Okay, by the way, you have a first year course in linear algebra. It often includes something called strip morphology. We're talking about language, not always called that. Let me just call the symmetric real matrices to revitalize. It works with complex matrices too, that.
00:06:46.518 - 00:06:47.074, Speaker B: Are.
00:06:55.254 - 00:07:09.122, Speaker A: In the context of star algebraic, the same self is only and the matrix and the matrices from a star algebra. If the conjugate transpose has the star.
00:07:09.178 - 00:07:12.294, Speaker B: Operation, in fact.
00:07:15.794 - 00:08:34.134, Speaker A: Norm, which makes it always a unique one, because that satisfies all the outcome. Okay, but, but the spectral theorem, and by the way, when it can be diagonalized, that's by means of a unitary matrix, right? Isn't a thought orthonormal basis another way of saying. There's another way of saying it isn't orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvalues, not on the camera. Well, technotherm in finite dimensions is very important. It's related to why an ellipse is such a fundamental idea. The idea of an ellipse is so fundamental, if you transform an ellipse by a linear, so saying something in litmus and ellipse, it's sort of, you think of it as a euclidean notion, right? But if you take any linear transformation of plane, then it transforms an ellipse into another ellipse. Everyone aware of that.
00:08:34.134 - 00:09:54.974, Speaker A: Well, true fitting, I would say, is always a spectral theorem. Or if you prevent some other way, then into proof of the spectral thing in two dimensions, two real domain, and well, not only is there a spectral theorem in finite dimension, but there's a spectral theorem in an infinite dimensional hybrid space as well, real or complex. And in fact, if you apply, well in the real case, if you apply it to sulfur joint operators, even in two dimensions, if you try to try to state the spectral theorem for a normal operator in a complex case, it's true for what's called a normal operator, mutually determined. But in two dimensions, if you have a problem, rotation. Rotation is a unitary operator in two dimensions. It preserves the norm. But I don't think it has any eigenvector in two dimensions.
00:09:54.974 - 00:11:19.544, Speaker A: I don't think a rotation has any eigenvector whatsoever, whatsoever. Well, if it's a rotation by 180 degrees, then, and it has lots of eigenvectors, otherwise, not. Still, there's a version for normal operators, and in the case of a complex open space, even funny dimensional, they work, certain normal operators too. There's an orthonormal basis, basis of two or space basis, in which the, if you look at the operator in that basis, the matrix is diagonal. And that's, by the way, we've been talking about k one of the complex numbers, right? Well, that means you look at matrices, look at the variable or unitary matrices, and you say that the k one group is zero. That means that everything is connected. Every invertible matrix is connected to the identity matrix, possibly through a larger, through larger matrices, possibly embedded in the left hand corner of larger matrices.
00:11:19.544 - 00:11:56.474, Speaker A: But in fact it's true. Just inside a given matrix algebra field, look at the two by two matrix altogether, or 200 by 200 matrix volume. You look at a unitary or vertical matrix, then it's connected by a path in the, inside the group of unitary or invertible matrices. Whichever you're talking about, these energy matrix, is everyone aware of that? Well, if you're aware of that, you must be, you must be aware of the spectral theorem. I don't know any other way to prove it.
00:11:57.974 - 00:11:58.714, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:00.614 - 00:12:40.026, Speaker A: If you know the spectral theorem, then it's enough to look at a diagonal operator. In a complex case. Every unitary operator is unitarily equivalent to a diagonal operation. If it's invertible, we have polar decomposition. If somebody, it's equal to a unitary operator times an invertible positive operator. Invertible positive operator is clearly connected to the identity matrix. You just take a linear path connecting vertical positive operator to the density matrix.
00:12:40.026 - 00:13:08.406, Speaker A: Everything along that straight line path is positive and invertible. It's a path connecting it to identity. You only have to look at the unitary, unitary, unitary operator is normal. So it's unitarily equivalent to, it doesn't affect whether it's connected to the identity, unitarily equivalent to diagonal out there. But then you just look at the diagonal entries separately, connect each one to the number one.
00:13:08.590 - 00:13:09.078, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:09.166 - 00:14:20.644, Speaker A: That makes sense. Okay, so that's, that's how important this spectral theorem is in this course. Probably we could give the whole course just by going through the interview. Halperin is bringing things back to fairly elementary level. Don't forget he's just got a master's degree in throne, and this is almost 100 years ago. Things were maybe, maybe some aspects of education were more thorough, but probably the curriculum wasn't as advanced as it was after all. This is a fortunate course.
00:14:20.644 - 00:14:35.194, Speaker A: Here you go. First, I couldn't understand how you could have Hilbert spaces with complex numbers. What does everyone. This is how to take.
00:14:35.234 - 00:14:35.410, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:35.442 - 00:14:47.574, Speaker A: Does everyone now understand how you can have a hybrid space with complex scale? Yeah. So what's the inner product? If you just take the complex number. So it's a one dimensional vector space, right. What's the inner product?
00:14:48.434 - 00:14:57.634, Speaker B: There is. It's x interval of y x times PI r. Yeah.
00:14:57.674 - 00:16:17.074, Speaker A: So the x and y are vectors, right? They're complex numbers, but you can modify them and you can take a complex conjugate. And so if you do that, then you get an inner part. Have you, are you, have you checked that? That gives you the axioms of a Hilbert space? Okay, well, that's a. Maybe you should do it. For instance, you get a norm. What's the norm of a complex thing? What's the length of the vector? Well, it's supposed to be a Hilbert space, right? So you have to have a length, a norm. Every vector has a norm if it's one dimensional complex vector space, if it's significant, if you think of it as the vector space of complex number, what's the norm? Well, in general, we know what's best in terms of the inner product, right? You take the inner product of the vector itself to its x times x bar, and then you take the square root.
00:16:17.074 - 00:16:26.014, Speaker A: Okay, but that already has a name. If you look at complex vectors in the plane. And what's that number?
00:16:28.354 - 00:16:29.134, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:16:30.754 - 00:17:01.154, Speaker A: Look, if you have one dimensional complex space, we can visualize that as two dimensional real vector space, right? And there's. In two dimensional real vector space, there's also an inner product. How do you. How much. The formula for inner particles in the real world, you take two vectors X and Y x is x one x two. Y is y one, y two. And what's the other part?
00:17:03.574 - 00:17:07.874, Speaker B: X squared. X one squared.
00:17:08.294 - 00:17:15.793, Speaker A: Well, that's the norm. That's the inner part. If Y is equal to x, that's what you do. What do you do if X is not equal to y?
00:17:20.053 - 00:17:23.765, Speaker B: Sorry. Well, okay.
00:17:23.789 - 00:17:30.833, Speaker A: Does anyone want to actually voice the formula? Yes.
00:17:31.253 - 00:17:33.437, Speaker B: So if X is X one x.
00:17:33.485 - 00:17:37.125, Speaker A: Two and y is Y one y two, then the inner product would be.
00:17:37.269 - 00:17:40.473, Speaker B: X one times y one plus x.
00:17:41.554 - 00:17:48.298, Speaker A: Okay, and that's a real number, right?
00:17:48.386 - 00:17:49.106, Speaker B: Yes.
00:17:49.290 - 00:18:36.414, Speaker A: And how does that relate to the complex inner product of X and y? In the complex case, you want to conjugate the entries of. Okay, so it's a complex number. It's not a real number. Yeah, well, okay, but is there no connection whatsoever between the realm inner product of X and y considered as points in the Euclidean plane? And the complex inner product is considered, considered as points in the complex one dimensional, complex plane? Is there, is there a relationship, Larry, do you know a relationship? Well, you have two. It's, you have two sets. One is a one dimensional complex vector space, and it's a Hilbert space. It has an inner product, just a complex number.
00:18:36.414 - 00:19:22.126, Speaker A: And then the, it's also a real vector space, two dimensional real vector space. And it has an inner product, real real valued inner product. So what's the relationship? How many people are aware of the relationship between these two inner products? Shout out. I mean, once you have the formula for the two products, then you can just say that the relationship is, on the one hand, one of them is this, and on the other hand, the other one is this. Sometimes. And that might be the best you can do. I would say in this case it's.
00:19:22.150 - 00:19:39.134, Speaker B: Not the best product. When you restrict the complex inner products to real numbers, it just gives you the real inner product.
00:19:39.434 - 00:19:40.898, Speaker A: Okay, but what does that mean?
00:19:40.986 - 00:19:45.974, Speaker B: That means that the real inner product is just the complex and a product restricted to.
00:19:46.274 - 00:20:41.710, Speaker A: Okay, but what's this restriction? Because the vectors are the same. They're either in their points in the plane, they have the same pictorial representation. Points in the plane x and y, or points in r squared x one x two, y one y two. The information is exactly the same. So it seems to me maybe it's possible to say that one of them is information. I suppose a complex number. If the inner product is complex vector space complex, that's a complex number, then maybe it has more information than the inner product or the points in the euclidean plane, it's the same point.
00:20:41.710 - 00:21:20.074, Speaker A: But maybe the complex inner product contains more information. Well, yeah, I mean, geometrically it's the same thing. Yeah, but somehow the complex numbers are not. That's what you say, is the information in the complex number.
00:21:24.374 - 00:21:40.154, Speaker B: Right. Or I can just multiplication, please.
00:21:41.354 - 00:21:52.890, Speaker A: The blue look will be good. So we have two linear products. I was going to say that the.
00:21:53.042 - 00:22:02.850, Speaker B: Real part of the complex for how many people? Okay, good.
00:22:02.922 - 00:22:06.626, Speaker A: And if you have it, you're not aware of it, maybe you want to check it.
00:22:06.650 - 00:22:07.214, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:07.994 - 00:23:10.936, Speaker A: Just write down here, write down x times y bar the terms of the x one and x two of y one and y two. And see if the real part isn't equal to x one by one. And then be a question, what's the complex? What's the imaginary part? What's the point of view on the plane? What's the additional information? So these two points in the plane, then the real in the certain information complex in a product is supposed to give you more information. Geometrical point of view. How much more information? How do you visualize, visualize that additional information. For instance, I guess it's well known that the inner product.
00:23:11.040 - 00:23:11.724, Speaker B: Yes.
00:23:15.264 - 00:23:30.852, Speaker A: You didn't say something, actually. Good, good. But I guess everyone is aware that some kind of inner part is supposed to say something about the angle between.
00:23:30.908 - 00:23:32.264, Speaker B: The two methods, right?
00:23:33.204 - 00:23:33.984, Speaker A: Yes.
00:23:34.964 - 00:23:56.708, Speaker B: I think it's like the imaginary part is the negative, the determinant, or like, I guess the area, like the negative one of the determinant, like the permanent. Yeah.
00:23:56.756 - 00:24:03.024, Speaker A: Okay, well, that's something to do with the parallelogram.
00:24:09.164 - 00:24:09.524, Speaker B: Yes.
00:24:09.564 - 00:24:14.196, Speaker A: Well, you know, yes. If you change the order, I mean.
00:24:14.220 - 00:24:16.652, Speaker B: If you put second point x prime.
00:24:16.708 - 00:24:42.638, Speaker A: Eight degree prime first in the mattress determinant, and the minus will be no problem. If you put x prime and x one e great one, and then if x is x two e great two, x one e great two, then we don't have the minus. Then it should be the third example. Elementary geometry is something that I should be reviewing all the time, too.
00:24:42.686 - 00:24:43.274, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:45.544 - 00:25:25.614, Speaker A: But let me just wind up at mini discussion repeating the question, what is the, what is the norm? So we agree it's the square root of the inner product. From a geometrical point of view, what is the norm? It's just the length, right? Length is direct.
00:25:26.154 - 00:25:27.054, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:29.274 - 00:25:30.186, Speaker A: That'S the same.
00:25:30.290 - 00:25:30.962, Speaker B: That's the same.
00:25:31.018 - 00:25:57.872, Speaker A: Whether you're looking at the, looking at this real vector space or a complex vector space. Real inner product. Well, okay. But, you know, you could almost write an essay about electronic dimensional inner product spaces, comparing the real and the complex.
00:25:57.928 - 00:25:58.524, Speaker B: One.
00:26:02.504 - 00:27:04.054, Speaker A: Application, I guess. How many lives do you want to find a major and minor axis? I guess that's the spectral theory. So I think that this is considered to be important in engineering. And by the way, the spectral theorem in infinite dimensions, which is what is definitely going to be useful in this course if we haven't used it already. Well, it's, there aren't any eigenvectors in general. Okay. So you have to make do without eigenvectors.
00:27:04.054 - 00:27:14.778, Speaker A: And it should be a similar, it has to be a common formulation that covers the finite dimensional case and the infinite dimensional case.
00:27:14.826 - 00:27:15.226, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:15.330 - 00:27:47.102, Speaker A: So somehow you need to find a way of formulating the spectral theorem. Even in finite dimensions. It doesn't mention eigenvectors. Doesn't mention eigenvalues. Okay, that's a good exercise. Let me give you a hint. Well, let me do it, because it's, it may not be clear why you should do it, but let me, let me give an expression.
00:27:47.102 - 00:28:04.944, Speaker A: Let me give a formulation of the spectral theorem in finite dimensions. For a finite dimension, I'll say, well, real or complex selfie joint operators, real and complex Hilbert space statement is the same. And then see if you can.
00:28:07.684 - 00:28:07.972, Speaker B: See.
00:28:07.988 - 00:28:48.624, Speaker A: If you can make sense of this. For an infinite dimensional Hilbert space, it bound itself a joint operator on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. Okay, I'll state it for a finite dimension. Well, so whenever you have a, whenever you have a measure space, you have to know what a measure space is. Whenever you have a measure space, then there's l two of the measure space. You have the l two space for the measure space, and that's a Hilbert space. So natural in terms of the measure of two functions, you can define the inner product.
00:28:48.624 - 00:29:15.740, Speaker A: So in the case of one dimensional space, the functions are just, if it's the measure space, just a single point, then the functions are just single complex numbers, right? So the inner product is, if they're just x and y, then the inner product is x times y, because the integral is just evaluating it at one point, just giving you the value of the function.
00:29:15.772 - 00:29:17.068, Speaker B: That's what the integral is.
00:29:17.236 - 00:30:39.840, Speaker A: Okay, so we're generalizing this. It generalizes the one dimensional complex case. So you look at the l two space in general, and if you have a bounded measurable function, real valued function, real bounded real valued measurable function. If you have an arbitrary function on the measure space, measurable function, of course, l two arbitrary l two function, you multiply that by a bounded function, you get another l two function, right? And if it's a real valued function you're multiplying by, it's a bounded real value function you're multiplying by, you get a bounded self adjoint output, okay? But the fact that it's bounded, if the l two space is finite dimensional, that says the measure space is finite. Okay, finite set of points. So l two functions that are vectors, right? They have just for each point, you have the value of the point that's looking like the coordinates of a vector. And a bounded vertical function is just another, it's another finite set of finite set of numbers, right? Finite set of real numbers, and multiplying the two functions, that's just multiplying.
00:30:39.840 - 00:31:22.516, Speaker A: The easiest way to modify them is to consider them as diagonal matrices and multiply them as matrices that modifies the corresponding values of the functions. So the diagonal matrix, the function, if you have a function, you put the values of the function down the matrix, and that tells you what it is as an operator. So that's the correspondence. But you know, I. The trouble is I can't, I couldn't state the finite dimensional theorem without stating infinite dimensional theorem. The exercise is flown out the window. Still, we could prove it.
00:31:22.516 - 00:32:06.264, Speaker A: Okay, you could review the proof in the finite dimensional case and then see what you need to approve it in the incident dimension of case that your given boundary joint operator is unitarily equivalent to such a multiplication operator. By the way, you might want to think about it. And in fact, there's a way of proving this theorem in the infinite dimensional case. Just applying the finite dimensional theorem. Prove it using the finite dimensional theorem. Of course, you still gotta have to. Then you still have to prove the finite dimensional theorem.
00:32:06.264 - 00:32:22.464, Speaker A: So maybe it's simpler to prove the infinite dimensional theorem from scratch that will prove to the finite life is. Involves choices, right? And you can't always have it both ways. In this case, you could.
00:32:26.094 - 00:32:26.470, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:32:26.502 - 00:32:28.114, Speaker A: That's enough of the interview.
00:32:31.894 - 00:32:32.714, Speaker B: That's.
00:32:35.214 - 00:32:44.294, Speaker A: That'S what I feel like. That's one day, 1 minute in the life of Israel.
00:32:44.334 - 00:32:44.870, Speaker B: How?
00:32:45.022 - 00:33:00.180, Speaker A: By the way, he has a nice proof of the structural theorem in it. There's a paper in the 1964 American Mathematical monthly giving a very elementary proof of spectral theorem, which works for the planet dimensional phase too.
00:33:00.212 - 00:33:02.664, Speaker B: You don't have to assume the planet dimensional.
00:33:09.684 - 00:33:51.844, Speaker A: There are two. Professor Halpern has two papers in that journal, american mathematical mention in the early sixties. And this is what, this is just one of them. 1964. Okay, so he says, I had never heard of such a thing. Gilbert, space is a complex thing. I asked Malcolm Robertson, how do you define the inner product if you have complex numbers? And he told me, well, I know now too.
00:33:53.304 - 00:33:55.604, Speaker B: Good. All right.
00:33:57.624 - 00:34:20.786, Speaker A: Well, at least in the one dimensional case. Okay, so here's a kind of a riddle, by the way, whereabouts in the course are we using the spectrum theorem? I think I even put it in.
00:34:20.810 - 00:34:23.214, Speaker B: As a prerequisite for the course.
00:34:24.434 - 00:35:01.444, Speaker A: And this is purely a psychological thing, or is it something that actually gets used? Okay, so we were discussing the. I like to start from a schematic outline, and sometimes people think my schematic outlines are a little too schematic, but.
00:35:02.424 - 00:35:05.576, Speaker B: I like to feel that there's no.
00:35:05.600 - 00:35:18.284, Speaker A: Such thing as two schematic. As long as you. As long as you prepare to stand by. Stand by.
00:35:18.704 - 00:35:19.168, Speaker B: Whatever.
00:35:19.216 - 00:35:21.404, Speaker A: You're closing it back out.
00:35:21.984 - 00:35:25.204, Speaker B: Okay, so, first step.
00:35:29.034 - 00:35:50.694, Speaker A: Talking about isopods and vertical ohms, or productions and unitaries. But we're not going to be able to stay with productions and unitaries forever, as we might as well start off more general or abstract non star structure.
00:35:51.174 - 00:35:51.914, Speaker B: But.
00:35:55.574 - 00:35:56.634, Speaker A: This is the.
00:36:08.694 - 00:36:09.054, Speaker B: Key.
00:36:09.094 - 00:36:09.794, Speaker A: Square.
00:36:16.974 - 00:36:17.834, Speaker B: The one.
00:36:21.054 - 00:37:10.884, Speaker A: What was the invertible? We're looking at a map from vertical elements of the suspension within the joint. Well, yeah, if you will. Because what you're saying is, suppose that p were equal to one, then what would the. What would we be thinking? Tap. What's a. Oh, yeah. Well, come on, that's too trivial.
00:37:10.884 - 00:37:26.572, Speaker A: We want something that has a non. This is a non trivial. K zero would be the zero, k zero cost. This is in general, this will not be the zero k zero cost. This will be an interesting k zero cost. In the case of the complex numbers, this generates k zero.
00:37:26.628 - 00:37:27.224, Speaker B: Right?
00:37:28.244 - 00:37:41.290, Speaker A: Okay. So it would be enough to look at this case. And this is supposed to somehow suggest what the general case is. But in this case, what's the invertible? Element, or unitary, if you like.
00:37:41.322 - 00:37:42.658, Speaker B: This is the star.
00:37:42.706 - 00:38:14.684, Speaker A: Right? Opponent is production. So we expect to get a unitary. What would the unitary be in the. We're going from a to extension of a tilt flow. It's not a map of algebra, it's compare the two. Algebra. When you go from k zero b to k one, in terms of invertebrates or unit terms.
00:38:14.684 - 00:38:30.704, Speaker A: So what, Larry, what would you put here? Remember what the suspension is. It functions on the circle.
00:38:30.784 - 00:38:31.404, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:32.284 - 00:39:08.812, Speaker A: Which are zero at the special point in number one. Look at the unit circle and we have a special point. Well, the suspension, thought of as a valued functions, which are zero at this special point. And if you join a unit, it's a valued functions. Since a has a unit, it's a valued function, which at the point. At this point, they are scalar multiples of still going into a, but they're still a value function. Okay, so you want the function.
00:39:08.812 - 00:39:29.034, Speaker A: The function which is a value and is non trivial, and it's equal to one at the beginning and the end of the time. And it should work. If a is just the complex numbers, charlie.
00:39:30.654 - 00:39:43.354, Speaker B: Sure. Okay. Like multiples of the p and then.
00:39:45.454 - 00:39:54.984, Speaker A: The algebra. If a is the complex numbers, then what is s and b in terms of what is s? A.
00:39:58.404 - 00:40:02.504, Speaker B: Complex number, extended complex number.
00:40:12.404 - 00:40:14.012, Speaker A: It already has a unit.
00:40:14.148 - 00:40:14.732, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:14.868 - 00:40:26.548, Speaker A: And the. The suspension is functions on the circle. Functions on the circle with values in the complex plane, it would be divided as a path.
00:40:26.596 - 00:40:27.184, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:29.484 - 00:41:12.624, Speaker A: And it's in fact, it's an arbitrary path because the fibers are always just scalar and the scale of multiples of one. So there's no condition if we, the suspension should be zero, meaning the path should be zero at the end. And if it's in the tilde, it's essay tilting an arbitrary path continuous. It's some path, some element of continuous of the algebra. Continuous functions on the circle. Continuous complex value focused on the circle. And that's what src looking at.
00:41:12.624 - 00:41:32.934, Speaker A: So if a is c, then s of c tilde, it's just continuous functions. Continuous complex value functions on the circle. And what's the simplest non trivial continuous complex value function on the circuit?
00:41:35.074 - 00:41:35.546, Speaker B: Remember?
00:41:35.610 - 00:41:36.654, Speaker A: Yes, Larry.
00:41:38.474 - 00:41:39.254, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:41:40.924 - 00:41:58.504, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, and this is a joke where it's a humor, supposed to be a humorous description of the identity map, because the circle is contained in a complex plane. So every point on the circle is a complex one. So you take the identity inclusion.
00:42:01.084 - 00:42:01.436, Speaker B: That'S.
00:42:01.460 - 00:42:41.914, Speaker A: A function on the circle complex. And if you call it z or z, I think it's funny to say that may more be a reflection on me. Okay, but if we're looking for a notation, we could say this. It might be slightly confusing, but I don't think it's working. Elevated from saying it is z. And this is accurate. This is abusive notation.
00:42:41.914 - 00:42:50.114, Speaker A: Z is a single phaset is a single complex number. And of course you say z equals z. Then it's obviously the identity map, right?
00:42:50.614 - 00:42:51.430, Speaker B: That's what.
00:42:51.542 - 00:43:15.966, Speaker A: On any space, the identity map is some x of x equals x. You could write it as x. There's a. I keep thinking about George Gamma, one, two, three, infinity, which I read when I was maybe even a preteen.
00:43:16.030 - 00:43:20.314, Speaker B: I forgot that's the word.
00:43:21.854 - 00:44:12.602, Speaker A: And one of the items in the book. It's very interesting. It's about the importance of complex numbers. Someone found a treasure map about buried treasure. Have I told this story? Buried treasure on a certain island, which is the guy knew where it was, he went there, and when he tried to follow the map, one of the things on the map you were supposed to orient yourself by. Make a turn, make a left turn. There was an old wooden gallows as pirates, I guess the pirates, they buried the treasure that got caught.
00:44:12.602 - 00:44:36.754, Speaker A: Anyway, trouble with following the instructions on the map was the gallows had disappeared, it had rotted. But the guy was studying complex variables, so he was able anyway to find the pressure, find the. Locate the x on the map.
00:44:37.734 - 00:44:38.614, Speaker B: Okay.
00:44:38.774 - 00:44:54.814, Speaker A: And so you could look it up. Gotta guess how it works. Or you could look it up. It's very ingenious. That's why I didn't recall. And it's one, two, three, infinity. George Gamlon, he's a very, he's one of the most famous physicists, because he discovered.
00:44:54.814 - 00:45:26.590, Speaker A: Have I mentioned this? I told this story. He discovered the. What did he discover? He discovered, nowadays everyone knows that the sun is hot, right? And then the. And it's not just a fire. He found out why the sun is hot. Okay. And it's quite funny.
00:45:26.590 - 00:45:37.274, Speaker A: You see a bumper sticker that says it has a picture of the sun on it and the signs. And this bumper sticker says, atomic power. No, thank you.
00:45:41.834 - 00:45:42.290, Speaker B: Okay.
00:45:42.322 - 00:46:32.964, Speaker A: But this discovery was joined with a student. Have I told this story? It's almost worth telling. Student is still alive and he still complains about this. What happened? So Gamow was mischievous in many ways. When he, in the fifties, when he was looking to leave the Soviet Union, gave an interview, lecture, public lecture at the University of Colorado. The physics building there named that very. And at that time, there was a.
00:46:32.964 - 00:47:21.504, Speaker A: Well, there are always funny things going on in Russia. Former Soviet Union, then present, versus former Soviet Union in those days. One funny thing was there was someone claiming to be a biologist and funding all kinds of crazy theories that to make about genetics, to make meat strong, so on top of the snow, things like that. And this was reinforced by. Stone disagreed, and that was it. I mean, you wouldn't have any job having to be released. Okay, so.
00:47:21.504 - 00:48:24.454, Speaker A: So Gamlov began his lecture by referring and very respectable, in a very respecting manner to his colleague. His name slips my mind this moment, but it doesn't matter. Maybe it's better not to read repeated, but my worthy colleague has come up with, and has discovered very important facts and so on and so on. And you could see how. But everyone outside Russia was aware that this was nonsense. And so you could see how people's faces fell when this visiting public was supposedly brilliant. Public lecturer was starting to talk about starting to play to boost the.
00:48:24.454 - 00:49:35.564, Speaker A: His russian colleague, crazy, crazy pseudobiologists. And so then Gamlov went on. His magnificent theory will explain the following phenomenon. But if it happens in a family, if the son looks more like an old man than father. Okay, well, when this saved the day, he got the job, got the house down and got the job. Okay, so in one, two, three, infinity. Well, we talked a bit about complex numbers today, and I almost covered the spectral theorems.
00:49:35.564 - 00:50:32.098, Speaker A: You should know now, you should know how to state the spectral theorem in a way which is consistent in both the planet and the infinite measure of case. And also you should know how to prove it. You either look up this 1964 paper, and it's just using this easy. It reminds you a bit of. It will remind you a bit of Pascal strength. And so that's. So you get the ordinary, and then the Internet, and you can, if you want, you don't want to look up the 1964 paper.
00:50:32.098 - 00:51:12.930, Speaker A: If you don't want the high school limit, then, and you just use these spectral theorems for fun interventions, which is not that hard to prove. That's high school functioning. And you apply that to the infinite dimensional case to reduce dimensional case. Now, the strategy for that might be a little. You might not hit upon it yourself. Might not hit on it yourself. So if anyone wants to, wants to hear about it, and we can talk about that in the future.
00:51:12.930 - 00:51:19.330, Speaker A: By the way, how many people want to have a makeup Monday on December 7?
00:51:19.482 - 00:51:20.786, Speaker B: Like I said, it's festival.
00:51:20.890 - 00:51:21.574, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:51:23.714 - 00:51:25.226, Speaker B: At the end of the spectrum. Yeah.
00:51:25.250 - 00:51:26.178, Speaker A: On December 7.
00:51:26.266 - 00:51:26.898, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:27.066 - 00:51:39.674, Speaker A: It's a makeup for a legal holiday. It's a little strange. Why not make up for Sundays? But anyway, we could have one, and we could talk about the spectral theorem.
