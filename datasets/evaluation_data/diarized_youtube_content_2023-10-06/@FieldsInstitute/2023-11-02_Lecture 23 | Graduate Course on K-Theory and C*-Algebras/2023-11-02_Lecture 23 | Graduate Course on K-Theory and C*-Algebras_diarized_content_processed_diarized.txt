00:00:01.080 - 00:01:29.514, Speaker A: Good afternoon. I suppose everyone is aware that next Monday is the time you have to decide to continue the course. The number of people present enrolled is not that greatly reduced from what it was originally, which was twice what the people are present. I guess people can take care, can take care of administrative matters. I came across a interesting article, short article, got no interest related to mathematics. Partly related to mathematics. Mathematics and physics, I guess.
00:01:29.514 - 00:01:51.104, Speaker A: Physics and mathematics, of course, are very closely related. Did everyone study physics? Has everyone studied physics? Good. Not everyone put up their hands. You know, a lot of mathematics includes a lot of physics. So you. It's a trick question. You can't really say no.
00:01:51.104 - 00:03:21.014, Speaker A: Well, it, it. I'm not sure. I think that it could be of one, half a dozen of the other, since we're in the metric system now, that joke might not be intelligible, but did I mention the history of Jones's discovery of how to keep the knots in your shoes straight, left, between left and right? This, the Jones invariant for knots, the Jones called a polynomial. It was proposed to other invariants, other polynomials which had been discovered to study knots, to distinguish knots, and they couldn't, but they couldn't distinguish or shoot on. Right. But those definition of those invariants was very simple. It was simple geometry, simple down to earth geometry.
00:03:21.014 - 00:04:45.090, Speaker A: But the Jones not polynomial involves these operator algebra and. Or you could, you could give a definition, you could give a stupid definition of it in terms of the. Right, you're not, you draw a picture of your knot in three dimensions and then you project it down, or you take your knot and hold it up in three dimensions, and the wire made out of wire, so it's rigid and you project it down to two dimensions, and then you have a whole lot of crossings, the line cross each other, right? So you keep track of whether each crossing, which arrow, which, which wire goes upstairs and which goes downstairs in every crossing. Okay. And in terms of that, there's an inductive definition of the invariant. Of course, you can't discover an invariant that way because there are many, many formula you can write down in terms of the numbers of crossings, what kinds of crossings, and most of them will be nonsense, but this particular one was invariant independent of how you projected the knot down onto the table. And it was invariant of the invariant of the homocopy of the knot.
00:04:45.090 - 00:05:30.506, Speaker A: You take the knot and transform it, just a homotopy invariant of the, of the map from last three and. Okay, but then it was a physicist who, Edward Witten, who discovered how to explain the knot in physical terms. Not ordinary geometry, but quantum field theory. Okay, I guess I mentioned how you do it. You have a quantum field in space. It means at every point there's an operator, just a distribution, but don't worry about that. And you.
00:05:30.506 - 00:06:13.954, Speaker A: The knot is a curve in three dimensional space. You just integrate this. You take the trace of the operator, and you integrate it over the. Over the curve, and maybe you integrate first, then take the trace for it to be finite. Okay, but this was physics. Mathematical physics, if you like. But it's actually, quantum field theory doesn't have a mathematical basis yet.
00:06:13.954 - 00:07:08.920, Speaker A: So it was pure physics, then? I should say quantum field theory. Quantum field theory doesn't have a fully mathematical basis. Many people have worked on. Well, okay. But then this came back to mathematics, physics influencing mathematics with the Iberg Witten theory, if you heard of that. How many people have heard of that? Okay, good. Okay, so this is.
00:07:08.920 - 00:08:08.524, Speaker A: You can decide yourself how much of this is mathematics and how much fittings. And the title of the article is how to predict a coin toss. And the subheading is, coins are fair, they're tossers, less so. All right, so. So the Percy diacones, a mathematician, Susan Holmes and Richard Montgomery were two other american mathematicians in 2007, analyzed the physics of a flipping coin and noticed something intriguing besides sending it somersaulting end over end. Most people, when they flipped a coin, impart a slight rotation to it. That means.
00:08:08.524 - 00:08:40.446, Speaker A: I guess that means like this. So the coin is sitting flat, rotating like this. Of course, if you flip it, it's rotating through an axis. Through it. You take the diameter as an axis, and it's rotating about that when you flip it. But also, if you look at the axis perpendicular to the point, then apparently you can't flip it without giving it a rotation along that axis. And then if you have a top spinning, then it is.
00:08:40.446 - 00:09:04.850, Speaker A: It has some stability. Right? In fact, there's a. There's a trick you can play on someone. You ask them to carry your suitcase, and you've got a gyroscope in it. Okay? So when they come to a corner, they have trouble getting around the corner. Okay? It goes both ways with porters. There was a car.
00:09:04.850 - 00:10:02.582, Speaker A: I saw a cartoon once of a. Someone had his baggage brought up to the. By the bellhop to the hotel room. He was looking out the window, and the reporter said, well, I must have been so confused when you gave me a whole $0.25 for a tip that I put it out the window instead of on the floor. Okay, but so that causes the axis about which the coin is flipping to drift while it is in the air, a phenomenon called precession. After crunching the numbers, the physicists concluded that a coin thrown by a human could exhibit a subtle but persistent bias.
00:10:02.582 - 00:10:54.934, Speaker A: There was about a 51% chance that a coin would land the same way up as it had been prior to being thrown. So, in other words, if it was a heads up when it was thrown, then it would be slightly more likely to be heads up at the end. Sorry, you want to know the reference? Well, the title is. It's in the economist, October 21, and the title is how to predict the coin cost. It's under probability science and technology section. Okay, so. But then there was the person who.
00:10:54.934 - 00:11:18.834, Speaker A: Who took an interest in this prediction. Radical prediction by these three. Mathematicians decided to do an experiment. He convinced 48 volunteers to perform 350,707 coin tosses. You look up. You got the article up now. Okay, sir.
00:11:18.834 - 00:11:50.534, Speaker A: Huh. Well, it was more. It would be a little less than. What is it? If it's a divide by 100, it's 3000 divided by 100. Close to 10,000. Close to 10,000 each. Each volunteer.
00:11:50.534 - 00:12:14.426, Speaker A: All right. But the data. And using all kinds of different coins. All kinds of different coins. His data confirmed what the physics had predicted. The coins landed same side up. So the original theoretical prediction was 51%.
00:12:14.426 - 00:12:51.024, Speaker A: Okay, this is like quantum field theory. The prediction with experiment, the comparison of theory with experiment, which is over ten significant figures. This is not quite so close, but it's three significant figures. So 51% theoretically, and 50.8% experimental. Okay, so it was. The determining factor was indeed humans apparent inability to throw straight.
00:12:51.024 - 00:13:41.604, Speaker A: Well, that's some. That's not going to be any of you, of any use to anyone, because everyone will know this now. Okay, so one thing that. Well, a number of loose ends. Okay, what we've been talking about, connection with k theory and sea star algebra, and one is in connection with the Pascal triangle. We wanted to know that the two. If you have a.
00:13:41.604 - 00:15:00.024, Speaker A: We had the polynomials with the order coming from the pascal triangle, and with monomials in x and one minus x generating the positive cone. And then if you have a linear functional which is positive on all those monomials, which are independent, so you certainly have one, then we want to know that it's. Well, the idea is that we're looking at moments on the unit interval. That's the problem. And this is approach to the problem a priori. It's not very clear that it's related to the interval, but as soon as you figure out what the positive functionals are on this order group. Then remember that the extreme points are the, on the closed points in the closed unit interval, and you get those.
00:15:00.024 - 00:15:52.210, Speaker A: But how did we calculate that? Well, we had to calculate, we calculated it by using the extreme points for multiplicative on the ordered rings, because you multiply two monomials to get another one. So it's a product of two positive elements is positive. So an order ring with units. And there's a theorem that says that it's also true for unit of unit or sea through algebra. If you have an extreme positive functional, which is look at the convex set of positive functionals equal to one on the unit, you look at extreme points, then they're exactly the homomorphisms into the real numbers. They're additive, preserving the product. And we haven't discussed the proof of that yet.
00:15:52.210 - 00:16:32.394, Speaker A: Has anyone looked at that? That's a very good exercise. So I hate to spoil people's fun. I mean. No, but there's a difference between solving it and looking at it, right? In fact, everyone just now, everyone has looked at it, right? I put it in the air. So it's there and you've seen it. Okay? So no one can say they haven't looked at it. Now, of course, I don't, I don't, I can't keep track of how thoroughly everyone looks at every point that has come up.
00:16:32.394 - 00:17:28.404, Speaker A: That's why, that's why I asked. No, but if something comes up like that, which is obviously important for, for a major theme, and it makes sense to look at, to see what's involved, how difficult, is it something that can be worked out immediately, or is it going to, is it likely to take for long? Thought. So that's, that's. And it's, it's two, it's sort of two exercises. It's, um. If and only if, right? It's an extreme point. So you have one ring unit or a drink.
00:17:28.404 - 00:18:55.510, Speaker A: And usually what you mean is that the. But if you look at the order of group underlying the effect to addition, underlying the ring structure, then the unit of the ring should be what's called an order unit, which means some integer, some positive integer times, the unit should be greater than or equal to any given element. Okay, so that's the, that's the setting. And if it's a commutative sister algebra, you can think of it as continuous functions on continuous continuous functions on a compact housed workspace, maybe continuous functions on the closed interval zero one. So that becomes quite close to this example. We're looking at is polynomials which turn out to be exactly the positive ones turn out to be exactly the ones which are strictly positive on the open intervals. So it would be.
00:18:55.510 - 00:19:47.814, Speaker A: If it's. If you might be more. It might be. I don't know which question is which special case is easier to consider, the polynomials with the pascal triangle order or the continuous real value functions on the interval with the greater than or equal to order. So the positive cone would be the positive, the functions that are greater than or equal to zero everywhere on the interval. And the question then is if you have a function positive functional, linear functional, which is positive on positive elements, and it's. And if you look at it's equal to one.
00:19:47.814 - 00:20:23.226, Speaker A: So you look at what are the states? R is going to be one. R plus goes to r plus and one goes to one. Okay. Those are. That's what it state is. Yes, sorry. The ring r.
00:20:23.226 - 00:21:06.774, Speaker A: The positive set of positive elements of r goes to the positive real numbers. Oh, thank. Yeah, I got. I'm sorry, I got. Thank you for waking me up. But let's say that what that interregnum, what intermission emphasizes is how important the unit is in the ring. Okay? It's also the order unit serves double duty.
00:21:06.774 - 00:22:14.434, Speaker A: It's also the order unit of the order group. Go with some. Of course, it's additive linear, functional, positive and unital. And that what it means then is there's a natural topology, so called point wise topology convergence on each element of r. The set of states is compact, so it's compact and convex. And so it's got lots of extreme points by the kind momentum seen the crime momentum. Has no one seen the crime momentum? Who has seen the crying Millman term? Let me ask.
00:22:14.434 - 00:23:21.674, Speaker A: Okay? One person. How many people have heard of crying? A millman or Millman or both? Well, the name Millman should be familiar to everyone because he's a member of the department. I mean, the son of the son of the kind Oman noman is a member of the masterpiece. His brother is a mathematician in Israel. Okay, through extreme state, extreme point of a convex set. Because does everyone know what extreme point of a convex set is? The convex set is if you take two points in a real linear space and you take two points. Yes, Charlie.
00:23:21.674 - 00:23:44.038, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So you, you take two point, you take two points in the. Take two points in this. In the set, then the straight line makes sense because it's a linear space. That's what the word linear means. It means straight lines make sense.
00:23:44.038 - 00:24:32.494, Speaker A: Right? Okay, then a convex set means it's closed undertaking the straight lines joining two points. And now if you just look at a point, you don't know whether it's extreme or not extreme, okay? If you just look at a single point. But if you look at, look at two points, it's very easy to construct a lot of points which are not extremely, okay, very easy. You have two points and you join them and you take any point between them which is not, which is different from the two points, okay? Of course, if the two different. The two points are. If the two points are different. No, even if the two points are different, you don't know whether.
00:24:32.494 - 00:24:59.534, Speaker A: You still don't know whether either of them is extreme. Okay? It could both be extreme. I mean, after all, any two points can be joined. Even two extreme points can be joined by a line, right? So particular triangle and each of the edges is joining two extreme points. But if you take a point interior, as Charlie says, to one of the edges, which makes sense because it's an ordinary line, okay, then it's not. Then it's not an extreme point. Okay? That's the definition of extreme point.
00:24:59.534 - 00:26:06.030, Speaker A: There's some things that you have to define by the opposite, okay, well, so it's extreme. Well, f in extreme state is equivalent to f being. F is multiplicative. Okay, I think this is the elementary exercise. It's interesting, okay? It's not trivial. So why not take a look at it and maybe, maybe not just now. Maybe not just now.
00:26:06.030 - 00:26:35.194, Speaker A: Okay, you're taking a brief looking at. Look at it now. But maybe we should. Maybe it's more appropriate to leave it hanging. Okay, it's not the sort of Damocles, because there isn't any exam in the course and you're exercises are optional. I mean optionally chosen, freely chosen. This would be a good exercise.
00:26:35.194 - 00:28:03.738, Speaker A: Okay, but then what I'd like to do is consider another thread. I won't, I won't, I won't be so rude as to refer to it as a loose thread. Okay, so we've been looking at extensions of seiscular algebra. And so you have an idea. Closed two sided ideal mapping into a and then mapping to the quotient a over I. Map a I into a. Then you do what anyone 50 years or more have been around for 50 years or more would say.
00:28:03.738 - 00:28:46.172, Speaker A: Divide. You divide a by I pass. Quotient is a noun. 50 years ago, quotient was a noun. But see, that isn't me. And the question is, what happens to the. Well, first of all, an interesting application of the k theory applied to this extension a.
00:28:46.172 - 00:29:14.794, Speaker A: So a is called an extension of I by a over I, something. Some people say it the other way. If it's a direct sum of the two algebra, then it's symmetric, doesn't make any difference. That's where you go. If I is a direct sum in the way. If a is I plus something else, then that's another algorithm and two of our talking. In other words, just the direct sum manic algebra, and the quotient is the other direct summit.
00:29:14.794 - 00:30:52.464, Speaker A: And it's, um, certainly the, um. Look at the definition of the k groups and it deserves direct summary, each one of them. Direct sum if you have. Sometimes it's true that in general there's a simple relationship that the k group maps onto major over a over I. For instance, if a is unit o, then and a over I is just the complex numbers looking at a complex manic algebra, because that's what, that's where Bach just use a simpler. And the what? One reason to look at bot freedom, it doesn't come up with Pascal's triangle. You don't need bot prediction to prove the postdraw moment problem, but you do need it to prove that the ideal is af and the extension is unknown and the quotient is af.
00:30:52.464 - 00:32:02.660, Speaker A: And this implies that a is af. Okay. In other words, is the closure of an increasing sequence of finite dimensional theta algebra, which are. It's a good exercise that finite dimensional theta algebras are, are direct sums of full matrix algebra over the complex numbers considered as future algebra. Oh, it was probably someone's PhD thesis half a century ago. And more, more, I guess three quarters of a century maybe. But also, k zero is a functor, and you use that to define k zero for non unit.
00:32:02.660 - 00:33:29.144, Speaker A: Well, you join the unit, you map, you map k zero of a tilde onto k zero of the complex numbers. And this is surjective, but, and this is non zero. That means that there's a kernel, probably, and that's, well, likely as a kernel. And even more, it would be even more likely this were zero, that there'd be a kernel. In fact, if you're talking about k one, how many people have looked at k one of the complex numbers? Okay, so let me move the. What's k one of the complex numbers they defined in terms of unitaries, what's the unitary group of the complex numbers? Uja? Yeah, it's a circle right in the plane, the unit circle. And is that connected or not connected? Connected.
00:33:29.144 - 00:34:46.083, Speaker A: Okay, so this suggests that k, one of the complex numbers, is zero, because you take the connected component if you have to go to matrices, and who knows what the, what the what the two by two unitary elements are two by two unitary matrices. Well, you have to give a definition. Well, of course we know the definition. Or you have to write a formula in terms of two by two matrices and you get to n by n matrices. It's getting going to get more and more complicated. So there's a trick to show that also the matrices are connected. Anyone want to guess the trick? Rishi, are you going to guess it? Okay, so what do we know about the unitary matrices over the complex number? How many unitary matrices are there? Charlie, are you familiar with the spectrum of a matrix? It's the eigenvalues for matrix.
00:34:46.083 - 00:35:50.494, Speaker A: Okay, well, if you have a diagonal matrix, then you can see the eigenvalue is sitting there, right? What if it's not diagonal? Or you have, you can define the eigenvalue, but what's the purpose of knowing the eigenvalues if it's a unitary matrix? Rishi. But. Okay, aquifer, the eigenvalues are, well, you're saying, okay, but if you self adjoint, the eigenvalues are on the line. But if it's, if it's unitary, the argument, the eigenvalues are on the circle. Okay, I didn't hear what you said. Okay, but I guess this is true for any normal matrix, and there, these eigenvalues are any points. So it's not so important that they're on the circle.
00:35:50.494 - 00:36:46.622, Speaker A: What's important is what's important is that they're on the circle when you've got them down the diagonal. In other words, there's something called the spectral theorem. I don't know if it's called the spectral theorem in the linear algebra course, but we can talk about unitary matrices. But every, in the finite dimensional Hilbert space, euphian space over the real complex number, every. Puyan, what do you know? Sorry. Okay, this is, you're getting to be too long. This is too long a story.
00:36:46.622 - 00:37:07.172, Speaker A: The spectral theorem can be summed up by one word. The rough summary is just one word. Okay. For a normal matrix. Yeah, I was just going to say diagonal. Okay, but it's better. Diagonalizable.
00:37:07.172 - 00:37:41.004, Speaker A: It's cheating a bit, because it's more syllables, but it's still one word. Yeah. Okay. It's a bit tricky, but. All right, then, of course, diagonalizable means with respect to actually doesn't mean you don't care how it's diagonalizable, whether just by an invertible matrix or by a unitary matrix. In fact, you can do it with a unitary matrix, but it doesn't matter because the point is that once it's diagonal, the spectrum is still going to be the same. Okay.
00:37:41.004 - 00:39:14.804, Speaker A: And it's, oh no, we, we don't. Yes, and the spectrum is going to be the same, but then it's, obviously, but then the, okay, and so what you have down the diagonal is a whole lot of points on the circle because it's, because it's unitary. So the spectrum is on the circle and then you can connect, yeah, you can connect those, all those eigenvalues through other points on the circle to the number one, which, okay, but the trouble is along the way it's not necessarily unitary, it's invertible. So that's where you want, it's similar by a unitary matrix. It's unitarily equivalent. Okay, then you look at the diagonal points on the circle and then when you deform them around the circle to come back to one number one, each one of them, then all the time you have a unitary matrix and therefore in the middle, and therefore when you go backwards with the unitary transformation which transformed the original matrix, you get a whole path of unitary matrices. Okay, so that's my effort to prove the theorem in a complete sentence with single, complete sentence.
00:39:14.804 - 00:40:18.096, Speaker A: But the unitary group is connected using the spectral theorem for matrices. But then since k one is the, you look at the union of unitaries in all the matrices, module connected, component in each matrix, each size of matrices, then it's going to be just have a single element. So everything is connected. So k one with complex numbers is zero. That means k one of a. The map is zero. And if it were to be analogous to definition of k zero, then you would, well that's after you take the joining unit.
00:40:18.096 - 00:41:17.064, Speaker A: And if you're going to define k one of a to be the kernel of this, well that's everything. So you join a unit and then that's k one. Oh, okay. But the point is that it's not always rejected. And the map, since it's a, since it's a function, since k zero is a function, you do and, and you can see it, you first prove it's a function for unitil algebras. And then if you have a map from a to b, you do a little diagram chasing to show that the kernel of this is a commutative diagram. And the kernel of the first map is going to map into the kernel of the second map.
00:41:17.064 - 00:41:41.992, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to be the same. So. So in other words, it's a functor. It's a functor even for non units of algebra. So you got a map. The ideal, as I said before, the ideal is almost never going to be unit an exercise. When it is going to be unital.
00:41:41.992 - 00:42:21.984, Speaker A: When the. Of course, if it has the unit of the whole algebra, then it's equal to the whole algebra. If it has just a unit, well, then it's a good exercise. Well, I already said what it had to. I gave, I described the setting, which has to be the case that if the ideal has a unit, I talked about the sum of two algebra. Okay? In that case, each one of them, each one of the directs summons is an ideal, and one of them can have a unit. Okay? Either one can have a unit, both can, and that's the general case, when the ideal has a unit.
00:42:21.984 - 00:43:01.164, Speaker A: So you really have to know what k zero of a non unit of ideal is, and then have a function. But then that's, and then you have exactness here, but not even though, of course, you have a map from zero into this and this into zero. And that's the k zero. That's what the k zero functor gives you. I mean, this is some objective. Have an ideal. I can.
00:43:01.164 - 00:44:03.764, Speaker A: So the k zero function gives you five terms in some sense, and the end is zero, but it's only a short sequence, but it's only exact in the middle, and the same with the k one. And since you want, you can prove, without talking about sequences, you can prove that k one is the k zero of the suspension. It follows that it's exact here too, for k one. But you can also prove directly in terms of the definition. In terms of what consequence of exactness here. If you have, you know, k one is k zero is the suspension. You just know it's invertible elements or unitary elements.
00:44:03.764 - 00:44:31.266, Speaker A: Then you have to prove it directly. But that's not so hard. Let's, let's see if we can. Let's see if I can just do it cold turkey. Okay. By the way, I hope that everyone has had 30 seconds to look at it, right? They actually had six weeks. But how many people have tracked it? But that's what you always do, you know, when there's a major theorem, even a minor theorem.
00:44:31.266 - 00:45:00.664, Speaker A: Well, maybe the other way around is whenever there's any result at all in the book, you first try to absorb what it says, then you try and prove it. And then if you don't know how to get started, you peak, maybe. Okay. And then that tells you how to start, maybe. And then you keep on going. If you get stuck, then if you want, you could peek again. No, no one is going to, no one is going to complain.
00:45:00.664 - 00:45:53.804, Speaker A: Well, you might be afraid that you're losing the fun, losing some fun. Okay, because, but the, all right, so let's, so what does it, well, we don't have very many minutes, but let's see. Suppose we have something here. Suppose we have a projection. Suppose e is equal to e squared belonging to a, and, well, no, it's two projections. It's a formal difference of the class of e and the class of f in matrix e and f of projections in matrix algebra. And this goes into zero, k zero, a over I.
00:45:53.804 - 00:47:37.542, Speaker A: And by the way, I'm assuming that the algebra a has a unit, not I, but a assuming, because I guess that if you can prove exactness here after joining a unit, and you can prove it from the definition for the a itself. Okay? So that means that if we look at projections e dot and f dot, these are then the images of e and f in a over I, and we have e dot minus f dot. E dot is equal to f dot, okay? Because we're assuming the k zero element goes to zero. And so two projections with the same k zero plus, well, they're not unitarily equivalent, but in fact, you can add multiple of the, you can add a multiple of the unit to both of them. So the dinner equivalent. Marie van Erman equivalent. But then there's an exercise that if you have two projections in the disturb algebra, or any algebra, any star algebra, or doesn't have to be a star algebra.
00:47:37.542 - 00:48:23.054, Speaker A: If you use the general definition of equivalent, if they're equivalent in the algebra, then they're unitarily equivalent in a matrix algebra. And then the non star setting, they're similar. There's an invertible element in a larger matrix algebra. It takes one into the other. Okay? That means we can assume, so we, by the way, if you add the class of the unit to each of these a has a unit, you add the same multiple unit to each one, then it won't change the k class. And so we can suppose that, we can suppose that they are equivalent. Then passing to matrices, we can suppose they're unitarily equivalent within the set.
00:48:23.054 - 00:49:20.880, Speaker A: So we have a unitary in the quotient. But furthermore, go to another mate, a larger matrix algebra, we can, if we look at u, u minus one in a larger matrix algebra, we can assume it's, it's connected to the identity because you then just rotate u down to here and they cancel out. So in other words, we can suppose that e dot and f dot are unitarily equivalent by a unitary that's connected to the identity. But such a unitary always comes from a unitary in a because it's a finite product. If u is connected, then u is equal to e to the I h e to the two PI I PI h. For some sulfur joint h. That's not quite true.
00:49:20.880 - 00:49:52.974, Speaker A: It's a finite product. It's a finite product of such things. Okay. And each one of these obviously lifts because the sulfur joint element lifts to a sulfur joint element. You lift it to anything and then take the, and then you take the adjoint of it and divide it by two and that will map into, that'll be a sulfur joint and be another lifting of your given. Okay, so we looked at unitary up here. We transform e and f by the unitary.
00:49:52.974 - 00:50:27.404, Speaker A: And that means that we're down, that we've reduced to the case that the e dot and f dot are equal. Okay, well maybe that's overkill. What did we want to get to? It's in k zero of I. We wanted. So I guess we did want to know that e. How do we. Yeah, so we get that e and e minus f.
00:50:27.404 - 00:51:12.132, Speaker A: They're equal in the quotient. Yeah, they're equal in the quotient. Okay. That means e minus f one to the ideal in a. We look at a, then d minus f c. What's, how are we going to get the image of. Okay, well, well, we could, we could, I could try bracing it out until someone else came into the room, took over the room.
00:51:12.132 - 00:51:49.894, Speaker A: Let me, let me just try a bit. Remember this? This was cold turkey. Maybe I haven't done it for 30 years. And meanwhile I'm hoping that people, someone will help me out. Right? In fact, maybe I should just leave it for people to finish. How does that sound? Okay, so we've reduced it to the case. We've reduced it to the case that e dot is equal to f dot.
00:51:49.894 - 00:52:50.874, Speaker A: Okay? In other words, we have two projections in a and we're looking at a class of e zero minus f zero and e dot is equal to f dot. And the question, does this imply that e zero minus f zero is in the image? Is it in the image? See, the trouble is it's a little complicated because I does not have an ideal. So we have to say something is in I tilde. Look at I tilde. So we have itilde is contained in a. Because a has a unit. That means I with unit are joined.
00:52:50.874 - 00:53:50.588, Speaker A: And what's k zero of I? You look at something. You look at something in k zero by tilde, which maps into zero in the. In the quotient that was the kernel. Oh, yeah, but, okay, but, but look, if e zero minus f zero, that's in, that is in. Is there in case you have to be checked. But if it is it, is it equal to zero when you map into. Well, certainly when you map into the quotient, divide out by I, then the two projections are equal.
00:53:50.588 - 00:54:20.064, Speaker A: So once you get it here, then it will be in k zero I. All right, well, let me rest my case. That's not the usual. Um, when. When a lawyer looks as if he's losing, he does not. What he said. Okay.
