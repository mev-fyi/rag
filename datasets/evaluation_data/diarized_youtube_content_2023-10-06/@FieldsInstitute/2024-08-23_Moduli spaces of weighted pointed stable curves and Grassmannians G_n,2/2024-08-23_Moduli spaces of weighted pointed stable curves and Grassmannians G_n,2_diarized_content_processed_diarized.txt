00:00:00.640 - 00:00:14.641, Speaker A: Okay, let's start our next talk. So it's my great pleasure to introduce the next speaker, Aswathana Tezuk from University of Montenegro. She's going to talk about modular spaces where you point stable curves on cross variance. Please start.
00:00:14.753 - 00:01:14.171, Speaker B: Thank you very much. Thank you for the invitation to give a talk. It's my pleasure. I'm going to speak about my recent joint result with Victor Bush Taber, which actually these results appear on our long time investigation of the of the torus action on the manifolds and in particular on the Grassman manifolds. And I'm going to explain you one connection that we established between the, I mean a relatively recent notion of modular spaces of weighted point in stable curves and compactor section on Grassmanians Grassmann manifolds, in particular Grassmannian GN2. So just in short, to have an overview of what I'm going to speak about. Actually, as I said, we have recently been studied the aquarium topology of Grassmann manifold GN2, Grassman manifold GN2.
00:01:14.171 - 00:02:16.961, Speaker B: They are just complex Erasmus manifolds, which consists of two dimensional complex subspaces in n dimensional complex space. They are all as well homogeneous spaces. And we studied the canonical action of the compactorus. Actually we have the action of the compactorus on CN standard coordinate wise action and induces the action of the compactoris on a Grassman manifold two dimensional complex outspaces. And maybe two years ago, recently in a paper published a year or year ago, I think we constructed just by topological methods a model for the orbit space. What does it mean, a model? It means something that in some, in some sense, I mean it means that we have actually we constructed the model. It is the some space un, which is actually the product of the hyper simplex standard hyper simplex and some smooth compact manifold together with the continuous projection.
00:02:16.961 - 00:03:03.855, Speaker B: And this is that this is a model. I maybe I will say a few words later. This is that this is the model. What, what do we mean by that? We mean that there are open subsets, open dense subsets in un and this and in these orbit says such that this projection is diffeomorphism between them. This is diffeomorphism. And actually in preserve the combinatorial structure, we have here the combinatorial structure which I am going to explain and here also some combinatorial structure. And actually we, we constructed this model which actually in some topological sense very well approximate this orbit space.
00:03:03.855 - 00:04:39.979, Speaker B: And then for this space fn, in our model we prove that it is diffeomorphic to the well known Delin manford compactification of the stable genus zero curves within marked points. And so somehow our ingredient, our space F pen, which appears in our model, is actually very well known and very well studied. We obtained it completely independently. We came to this space, to this space F pen from the point of view of topological description of our orbit space. And after that we realized that we can prove that actually it is delin Manford compactification of modular spaces of n pointed curves. A theory of stable curves of genus zero has recently, I mean, not recently, almost 20 years ago, enriched by Bernard Hassett, where he introduced the notion of for arbitrary genus G, I'm going to restrict myself to the genus zero. It is intrigued by Hassett by considering the stable curves, weighty stable curves, what does it mean to each point is assigned a weight and such that it behaves nicely.
00:04:39.979 - 00:05:44.175, Speaker B: And what for this space Fn I said, we established in our model, we established the relation with these well known delinquent Manford compactification. And then what I'm going to present you today is that also it can be established relation between these hazard spaces. So the spaces, the module spaces of stable curves with weights assigned, which are. Which assign the weights and the. And actually the toric topology equation topology of the Grassmann manifold in some sense, I'm going to show you that we realize that the orbit space of Grassmann manifold GN2 by the action of the compact torus, can serve as a universal object for all these modular spaces. So now, just to remind you to be. I mean, to follow, to follow easier the things.
00:05:44.175 - 00:06:52.375, Speaker B: So we consider modular space mln, mln Modular space is just modular space of compact complex algebraic curve of gene 0, so CP1. And by moduli space, we consider all such with mo n complex complex algebraic curves of gene 0 with n mark distinct points. It can be considered as a. As a space, as a configuration space of endpoints on CP1 and different points on CP1 up to the action of the projector group, say For n equals 3, this moduli space, this moduli space. So when we consider this modular space is we consider CP1 with three mark distinct points. But and then it's a we have always homography which maps then to these 2 to these 3 points 0, 1 infinity. So this space mo3 is just a point.
00:06:52.375 - 00:07:24.800, Speaker B: In the case N equal n equal 4. We have. We consider CP1 with four points. And then if we apply some, I mean, maybe use transformation then we. It is, it is. It is isomorphic to CP1,0,1 infinity with one parameter t, where t is not zero and infinity, since these points are assumed to be different. So the space mo4 is just cp1 minus 3 points and so on.
00:07:24.800 - 00:08:04.963, Speaker B: So in general cp cp1 with d space mon with N mark N mark points is given this way. It's actually subset in CP1, n minus 3. This space is not compact as well as N is bigger equal three. And now it's a well known problem of compact. It was solved one more problem of compactification of these spaces. And of course one can compactify some space in many, many different ways. But it's a problem one can just what one point, one point compactification we all know.
00:08:04.963 - 00:08:30.671, Speaker B: But the problem is to find the good compactification. Good compactification. So it would be itself a modular space which parameterize in a natural way generalization of the object from mon. And it is well known in this context. It is well known Manford which is equivalent to Grotem compactification bar by stable. By stable curves. I'm not going to explain.
00:08:30.671 - 00:08:52.459, Speaker B: There are many definitions of stable curves. I mean this stable curves. These are the curves that have actually singularities of a type node. All mark points are different. And say. One can say that only. I think only isomorphism that CP1 that preserves the fixed points is actually identity.
00:08:52.459 - 00:09:23.235, Speaker B: Or there are many. There are the combinatorial equivalent definitions, but one, the stability condition of these curves. These are curves that. These are curves with n of genus 0 with n mark fixed points, which satisfies additional condition. Stability condition. And stability condition can be defined, can be formulated many ways. One of the way is that this divisor is an ampl divisor for the colonica class of the curve C.
00:09:23.235 - 00:09:46.965, Speaker B: And then. So the compactification of MO4, if you remember MO4 is a CP1 minus 3 points. It will be CP1, MO5 will be say known the peso surface of degree of degree 5. Yes.
00:09:49.585 - 00:09:53.345, Speaker C: So this is my. So my lack of understanding, I guess you.
00:09:53.385 - 00:09:53.561, Speaker B: You.
00:09:53.593 - 00:09:56.321, Speaker C: You are adding the stability condition, right?
00:09:56.353 - 00:09:56.761, Speaker B: Yes.
00:09:56.873 - 00:10:09.779, Speaker C: And to me that would have intuitively mean that you get fewer points than before, that you're making your sink smaller because you. You have another condition. Something that was in there before is not in there now. Because it. My.
00:10:09.907 - 00:10:12.299, Speaker B: Yes. No, no, no. This is compactification.
00:10:12.387 - 00:10:17.811, Speaker C: Yeah, that's what I don't understand. Why is it I would. Why is it not getting smaller?
00:10:17.923 - 00:10:27.443, Speaker B: It's not. I mean, the stability. The stability in condition is not. Because stability in condition. Now you. You consider the. You consider the curves which are.
00:10:27.443 - 00:10:45.889, Speaker B: Which can be. Which can have singular points. And the singular points may have only be the nodes the double singular point. Okay, and then what are this is. This is. This is ordinary stability condition. When we have ordinary points without any weights.
00:10:45.889 - 00:11:22.637, Speaker B: What the paper Bernard Hassett actually which is. Which was somehow revolutionary paper in this direction. They are after that many, many more papers studying studying this notion Is he assigned? Roughly speaking, we have the same situation, but we have also we the stable curves. But now we want to assign to each stable curve weight. And one has to take to take into account that any curve has a weight. And then he formulated a stability condition in this way. So he said.
00:11:22.637 - 00:11:44.307, Speaker B: So we have a. We have a curve of genus 0, we have a mark points. In this case, the points are not required to be different. They may. They may coincide. And this is said to be a weighted average table. If it is given a function of which to each point assign a weight.
00:11:44.307 - 00:12:17.857, Speaker B: A weight is some number between 0 and 1. And this divisor is required to be ample. So each point is multiplied by its weight. And if some points collide, then the sum of weights is required to be less equal one. And this is stability condition given by Hassett. And he considered modulus spaces of such curves. And from this stability condition by degrees, it follows that the sum of the weights has to be bigger than two.
00:12:17.857 - 00:13:26.007, Speaker B: Then, if we take that all weights always are equal to 1, this M bar or hasset space is just the lean Manfred compactification. And just in the language it's far from me, but the language of the of algebraic geometry has proved that actually exactly what Delimanford proved that MOA is a smooth connected man for exact proper over disease. Okay, then what is what is nice? Then in his this paper he proved that among these these spaces weighted spaces of stable curves, one has reduction and forgetting morphism. So if we have a two, we have two, two weighted spaces, stable curves, weighty stable curves, modulate spaces. Then if it indifferents all weights from here bi are less equal than AI, then there is reduction. B rational reduction morphism. So it's a rational map.
00:13:26.007 - 00:14:03.915, Speaker B: It has inverse rational map. And in addition, he proved that if we have some set of weights and say we forget some weights from here, but such that the weights which are left satisfied these stability conditions, then we have a forgetting morphism. This is not. This is just a morphism. This is not. There are no irrationality. And I shortly write down here how it's how these reduction and forgetting morphism works.
00:14:03.915 - 00:14:43.407, Speaker B: He just consider one takes a curve and consider these components. Consider these points of the curve along these. These. These divisor fails to be ample. And then it contracts it to the points in order to get correct map. And then now what is interesting so when we consider the these HACC construction and he sees these spaces of weight weighted stable modular spaces of weighted stable geno zero curves, it appears these weights. These we have.
00:14:43.407 - 00:15:14.753, Speaker B: We have the weights. And as I said, these weights are. I put here Rn. It's the same unit in these weights. As I said, the weights are some numbers here start with the sum is the bigger equal to. And then one can define this is we. We are in Rn and it is defined in his paper chamber the composition coarse chamber decomposition and fine chamber.
00:15:14.753 - 00:15:59.077, Speaker B: The composition of this domain of admissible weights. I mean, it's nothing if one reads a little bit from algebraic geometry. Especially I think great paper by Michael Tatius from Journal of Mathematical Society from 96 97. Actually, on the abstract level of algebraic geometries it is written there, but here it's rewritten in a very concrete terms. So we have considered this domain of admissible domain of weight data. And then one can consider this hyperparameter arrangement. I just here coarse camber deposition consider.
00:15:59.077 - 00:16:51.047, Speaker B: And this hyperpolar arrangement gives a chamber decomposition of Rn and intersected with these domain of admissible weights, it gives the chamber the composition of. It gives the chamber the composition of these domain. So one can consider the chamber decomposition of these domain by this hyperpolar arrangement. And then it is defined the boundary. This is not topological boundary, but this is the boundary is defined to be the set of all such weights where this sum is two. And one can. It's not easily to realize that this boundary is actually the interior of the hyper simplex delta N2.
00:16:51.047 - 00:18:01.735, Speaker B: And what okay is interior hyper simple delta N2. And what I did not write here. Maybe it will appear later, but I want to emphasize what was the result also has approved. When we consider the chamber decomposition of this weight of this domain of weight data by these so called coarse hyperpolar arrangement, then the weighted space M bar OA is a constant on the chamber does not depend on A. So say we take D some D Omega is a chamber from D on given by this. By this decomposition by this hyperpolar arrangement. And we take A from this D Omega we consider M bar OA weighted space.
00:18:01.735 - 00:19:15.095, Speaker B: It does not depend on A, so it's isomorphic. So in other words, these. These. These weighted spaces stable of stable modular space of stable reno zero curves weighted spaces are constant on each chamber of this chamber decomposition. It is proved in his paper and okay, then what is further interesting, he established the relation between, I just shortly remind the relation between these, these modular spaces and geometric invariant theory quotient. Actually one can say if we consider CP1N with diagonal action of the projective group and then one can, one can, one can consider such a so called fractional linearization of this action. I mean, I do not have time to talk about that.
00:19:15.095 - 00:20:32.979, Speaker B: As I said, one can find all these things in module setting. This paper of Tadeus in Journal of Medical Mathematical Society that when we consider say Li is a canonical bundle on each I factor and then we consider some type of rational rational numbers and then consider this tensor product, this element actually is fractional linearization. It's a member, it's element of so called neuron severity groups, which is contained in Picard groups of Geraldine's line bundle. And then when we consider this tensor product, it's a line bundle and it defines so called fractional linearization of this action. And if we assume that the sum is equal to two, then just in order to construct geometric invariant theory quotient, one has to consider semi stable and stable points. And the semi stability condition of a point can be summarized as follows. So I mean, and this line bundle is typical when all stable points are stable and atypical.
00:20:32.979 - 00:21:39.009, Speaker B: Otherwise and this is, I mean this is all preparatory notions. So one can define the geometric geometric human theory quotient. So we consider CP1N geometric invariant theory quotient of CP1N by this action defined by linearization O. And this linearization O is defined by some T1TN from QN. And what has it proved? He proved that if we have a typical linearization, so none of the coordinates of for L is delta or none of the sum of the coordinates is 1, then so we consider some element from the boundary of delta on. So it's some tuple of n rational numbers, none, none is zero, everyone is less equal one and sum is two. And we consider linearization of the action of projective algebraic PGL on a CP1N defined by this linearization.
00:21:39.009 - 00:22:47.305, Speaker B: Then there exists neighborhood of this point L such that the intersection U with the domain of admissible weights of U is an open chamber in delta on is an open chamber in domain of admissible weights and for each A from that open chamber, the moduli space is isomorphic to the geometric invariant theory quotient of geometric invariant theory quotient of this action. If the linearization is atypical, so some of the points are allowed, some, some of some points are allowed to be one there. This is not an isomorphism, but there exists national natural irrational morphism. So he. He established connection between the the his modular spaces of stable rated 00 curves and the geometric invariant theory quotient of the CP1n defined by the. By the. By the action of PGL2 diagonal action.
00:22:47.305 - 00:23:49.295, Speaker B: And then I want to mention here because among these spaces, because there are a lot of studied in physics and in a connection with the different problems, they are so called loss of money spaces. Loss and spaces are spaces. They are modular spaces of stable curves of genus 0 whose points are painted by black and white. And at least it has at least two pointed painting by black and two point points painted by white. And all white points are pairwise distinct and distinct from black ones, while black points are without restrictions. People who work with quantization and other quantum homology cohomology operates and other things they often meet with the loss of money spaces. And it's a result.
00:23:49.295 - 00:24:37.897, Speaker B: Manin proved that actually this loss of money space after Hasset published his result can be realized. It's isomorphic can be realized as a modularized space of weighted curves. And we proved actually that this. That. That somehow this weight vector, this weight vector a man include actually that this weight vector where we have a K that man improved where AK +1 an he. He. He chose to be to specify it.
00:24:37.897 - 00:25:41.901, Speaker B: And we proved that actually that that loss of money paid does not depend on these weight vectors on the of these a k plus one K N N. Okay, these are. I mean these things I present in now up to now are just an overview of somehow known things. And now I would like to relate this with our work on a Grassman manifolds. So as I said so this was one part, one part about some known results from algebraic geometry. And now this is our work. We studied as I said T an action of GN2 compact torus action of complex draftsman manifold two dimensional complex spaces in a CN and this action just to remind extend to canonical action of the algebraic torus and then we have the standard moment map.
00:25:41.901 - 00:26:53.851, Speaker B: I'm not there, I'm just going to recall the standard moment map defined by the Pukir coordinates. We have a Puker coordinates and lambda I are the vectors from Zn I are two dimensional subsets from 1 to n 1. The I are the vectors which have a two places 1 and the other n minus two places 0. Just to have the image of this moment, PEP is a hyper simplex delta n 2. Now using this looker remaining one can define I mean one can define the stratification of Grassman manifold the strata for each subset sigma of two element sets from 1 to n, 1 can define W sigma. It's consisting of all points from grassman gn2 such that the non 0p coordinates are determined by the subset sigma such element w sigma. If it is non empty, we call the stratum and the sigma for which this wsigma is not empty, we call admissible set.
00:26:53.851 - 00:27:52.857, Speaker B: Then GN2 is the union of all these of all these w sigma, all w sigma are c star and invariant. So we have A and W sigma do not intersect. We have a certification of Grassman manifolds by the pucker coordinates. And we proved, I mean when we were doing this, that when we apply the moment map to WC sigma, we'll get that the image of the moment map is interior of the height of the of the interior of the poly top sigma, where poly top sigma is a convex half of those lambda I where I are indexed by sigma. I will call sigma invisible polytope. And what we further prove that as I said, WS sigma is invariant at the action of algebraic torus and so the quotient by the action of algebraic torus is an algebraic variety. And we proved actually that this vibration is trivial.
00:27:52.857 - 00:28:57.425, Speaker B: So we have a homeomorphism between the orbit space of any strata on any stratum by the action of the compact torus and this product admissible set. Admissible set is the is a set sigma which is subset here for which this w sigma is non empty, non empty, because it may happen that from some sigma it will be empty, for some it will be non empty. And just to sort it down, we call them admissible. And then we have here the main stratum. The main stratum are given by all points in the Grassmann manifold for which all Puker coordinates are non zero. So it is an open dense set in a Grassmann manifold. And as I said, since we have that it is this orbit space, I mean, from the previous slide we actually proved that orbit space of each stratum is homeomorphic to this.
00:28:57.425 - 00:29:57.875, Speaker B: So the orbit space of main stratum, since admissible polytope is going to be the interior of the whole hyper simplex times fn, and it is open then sent in this in the orbit space of the Grassman fn is just the orbit space algebraic torus and it can be written explicitly in this way. It is just some the intersection of some cubic hypersurfaces in CP1 on degree N I mean, actually it is not difficult to see because we can here work in a chart. Actually we can fix one chart. What is one chart? We can fix puker coordinate, which is non zero. Write down the main stratum belongs to any chart. Write down the main stratum in the terms of local coordinates. Then act by the algebraic torus and see what is the quotient.
00:29:57.875 - 00:31:02.629, Speaker B: And now this here is an open dense set in this orbit space. So it means that there is compactification of this product which will give us this orbit space. I mean, it's difficult to write down explicitly this compactification. But what we did, we constructed the compactification this is of this factor here, which is the compactification of this factor here. It means the compactification of this orbit space, which is going to be the model for our orbit space. So what does it mean? We constructed the compactification of this factor such that we will have a project. We will have a projection from this compactification to our orbit space, which is going to be diffeomorphism on a smooth open dense sub manifold.
00:31:02.629 - 00:31:39.881, Speaker B: On the open dense sub manifolds. How we constructed these, how we constructed the model, this compactification. Well, you will see somehow then how we establish the relation with the with HACC construction modular spaces. That's the reason I'm presenting this construction. We have, as I said, we have the family of admissible polytopes. The family of admissible polytopes are polytopes which we can get as images of the strata by the moment map. And these admissible polytopes, they sit inside the hyper simple delta N2.
00:31:39.881 - 00:32:07.117, Speaker B: They may intersect. I mean, they behave arbitrarily. I mean, we don't know. The situation is much more complicated in a case of toric positoric manifolds. We do not have in that case, the admissible polytopes are the whole simplex and is it and it faces here the station much more complicated. So we can intersect these. We can intersect these admissible polytopes and obtain the chamber decomposition of the hyper simplex.
00:32:07.117 - 00:32:36.167, Speaker B: So all possible intersection of admissible polytopes. So we consider all chamber decomposition by all possible intersection of admissible polytopes. Then we consider the induced moment map. Moment map is invariant under the action of tn. So we have the induced moment map. Then we consider the pre image by the induced moment path of a chamber C Omega hat. So if C omega is a chamber C Omega hat, it's a pre image.
00:32:36.167 - 00:33:36.543, Speaker B: And then we proved that they also behave nicely that C Omega hat is homeomorphic to C Omega times F Omega, where F Omega is actually disjoint union of all spaces of parameters F sigma. F sigma are the orbit spaces of the strata bar. The action of algebraic torus which such that sigma belongs to Omega. The space of parameters of main stratum is contained in F Omega and F Omega is a compact space. Actually, what one can deduce from the results of. They were studying these spaces by Gilpan, Serganovagoreski McPherson. They have one even joint paper.
00:33:36.543 - 00:34:27.605, Speaker B: And actually it's not written explicitly there, but one can. One can. One can somehow figure out it from that. That when we consider the chambers for this chamber decomposition, then and consider the pre image of a point from a chamber in this orbit space, that that pre image up to homeomorphism does not depend on a chosen point from the chamber. So when we go through the chamber and consider pre images of a point, these pre images topologically do not depend on a chosen point from the chamber. So what do we get? We get that the orbit space is actually the union of this C Omega hat. And this is the union of these products.
00:34:27.605 - 00:35:18.551, Speaker B: And now, as I said, we wanted to compactify this. We wanted to compactify from this product in order to obtain the model from this orbit space. The problem is the compactified Delta N2 interior. I mean, obviously it has to be Delta N2, but this FN F, I mean ordinary F, which is the spatial parameters of the main stratum was not easy how to competify in order to get a model. And we introduced an ocean universal space of parameters that will be compactification of the space of parameters fn, which will behave nicely under all our constructions. So that we will have a projection. Then here we have the certification.
00:35:18.551 - 00:36:01.183, Speaker B: The pre image of any strata is going to be is going to be appropriate appropriate product here here is will be admissible polytope and here some space and fn, which we call the virtual space of parameters. And there is this projection from this F sigma tilde. Since this. This part, if you remember, is a product based sigma zero times F sigma. So we will this F sigma tilde is larger than F sigma. So we require that there is such a projection such that when we go to by GN to this orbit space and by this homeomorphism to this that it coincides with the. With the.
00:36:01.183 - 00:36:31.874, Speaker B: With the. With this projection from here to here. And how we. How we. I just how we. How we construct this space is fn, which I explained. Now first, as I said, our fn is given an intersection of these cubic surfaces in CP1N, where each of the parameters cij cijcij prime is not allowed to be 0, 1 infinity and the first compactification is just closure fn in CP1N.
00:36:31.874 - 00:37:53.505, Speaker B: So to allow this point to be 1, 0 infinity, but this compactification does not work for us well, so it doesn't satisfy this condition I mentioned. So we found out that there is nice construction due to many authors the continuing process. Fulton, McPherson and Lee called the wonderful compactification wonderful compactification. It's compactify, it may compact like already compact objects in order to resolve some singularity that appears in some context. It's a There is a notion, I mean, one can find a smooth wonderful compactification of a smooth algebraic variety generating by building set of smooth sub varieties. And we proved actually that in this FN bar there exists a building set such that a smooth compact manifold obtained as a wonderful compactification by this building set will be the universal space of parameters of GN2. Actually we starting from this closure of fn fn bar in CP1N, we applied the wonderful compactification obtained the smooth compact manifold which is going to satisfy our condition.
00:37:53.505 - 00:38:38.735, Speaker B: And now here it appears so called virtual. As I said, in virtual spaces of parameters, visual spaces of parameters gives all universal space of parameters for the main stratum, DRF and tilde. And we have this projection. And what is interesting, when we are inside one chamber and consider the union of mutual spaces of parameters where sigma belongs to Omega, which determines the chamber. This union is disjoint and so this union joint. So one can define the projection from FN to F omega. F omega is union of all F sigma where sigma is of Omega.
00:38:38.735 - 00:39:21.135, Speaker B: In this way P omega of Y. We just take Y from here there exists uniq F sigma tilde which contains Y. We have projection from F sigma tilde to F sigma. On that way we define this projection. And now we can construct the model just in a short so the model is delta N2 times FN, where this orbit space is the union of pre images of the chamber. And how is defined the projection. We take X and Y when Y is from fn, X belongs to some chamber C Omega.
00:39:21.135 - 00:40:11.001, Speaker B: From this Y we have the projection from FN to F omega. So X P omega Y will belong to C Omega times F omega. We apply homeomorphism F H Omega and go to C Omega hat and this is for the the chambers which belong to interior. For the chambers which are on the boundary of delta N2, we notice that the boundary of delta N2 consists of hyper simplicity of smaller dimension and simplicity. So the pre image is going to be the union of the orbit spaces of Grassmannian of smaller dimension and orbit spaces of complex projective spaces. Here the space of parameters is a point universal space of parameters. Here the space of parameters of the universal space of parameters is fn minus 1.
00:40:11.001 - 00:41:24.515, Speaker B: And we actually proved that the space of parameters of the Grassmannian on the boundary. Actually we we get as a result of the for by forgetting 1 coordinates from FN. So to summarize, what are the structural data of our model? It's a universal space of parameters which we constructed by the wonderful compactification virtual spaces of parameters. Spaces of parameters of chambers and over the chambers and strata in the projection from the virtual to ordinary space of parameters from FN to F Omega and our and this is for getting one coordinate. And what we proved that this model that what this model can be completely realized in terms of modular space of weighted curves and morphism between them. The first what we proved is that the space of parameters of a stratum we have a stratum, we have the orbit space by the action of the algebraic torus. It's actually a lot of things can be done in terms of isomorphisms and so on.
00:41:24.515 - 00:42:28.875, Speaker B: I'm speaking in terms of topology and homeomorphism. So the spatial parameters of any stratum is homeomorphic to to modulate space ordinary module space. Then we proved, as I said introduction, that universal space of parameters is diffeomorphic to the Delinquen Manfort compactification. Further, then we use the result of David Manford and Francis Kirman of categorical quotients and Kirman of geometric invariant theory quotients and prove that space of parameters of the chambers. So we have a pre image of the chamber, it's C star N invariant and we consider the action of algebraic toes. Spaces of parameters of the chambers are actually homeomorphic. We can even say isomorphic to the geometric invariant theory quotient defined by the defined by the ample line bundle defined by this linearization.
00:42:28.875 - 00:43:31.875, Speaker B: Linearization is given by the point from a chamber. It does not the point of the chamber. Then so then combining the results of hasset, which establishes the connection between the geometric invariant theory quotients and moduli spaces, we actually prove that if you have a chamber of maximal dimension, then the space of parameters of the chamber is actually homomorphic to this modular space. If the chamber of dimension less than n minus 1 we have irrational morphism. Then here we established how these virtual spaces of parameters that we Described how they are all homomorphic to these. We describe the virtual spaces of parameters. Actually these are these universal spatial parameters and they are model or they are all modular spaces.
00:43:31.875 - 00:44:55.825, Speaker B: And so I just would want to mention that when we consider the family of these chambers in Delta N2 and we consider the family of chambers in Hasse decomposition, that from this. From this proposition, from this corollary, for each chamber there exists F omega, we have an ejective map such that to each chamber C Omega it assigns chamber D Omega such that D Omega belongs to D Omega bar. And actually the space of parameters F omega for this chamber is homeomorphic to the moduli space which correspond to this chamber D Omega. Then what we further proved, we further proved that our projection map which we have in our model, it coincides with the forgetting map by Hasset. And we proved that the projection from the universal space of parameters to a chamber when dimension is in minus 1 and the reduction corresponding since fn is this modular space F omega is this modular space, it coincides with the reduction morphism of Hasid. As far. May I have something.
00:44:55.825 - 00:45:41.305, Speaker B: As far as the loss of money spaces are concerned, the loss of minion spaces are as I said, they are also realized as. As these modular spaces of weighted curves. The chamber which belong to the to which belong this vector A does not satisfy this condition. It's not in the image of this moment map. But nevertheless we can prove that that there exists a chamber such that we have a B rational morphism from the loss and money in space to this chamber. And actually one can prove it for all. For all chambers maximal dimension satisfying this condition and all chambers of dimension N minus 1 less equal N minus 1.
00:45:41.305 - 00:47:06.667, Speaker B: As a result, there are plenty of consequences, since our FN is blow up, is actually wonderful complication FN bar, it's a it's iterating blow ups of FN bar. We have the blow down morphism and we also have the reduction B rational morphism. Since here all weights are 1 and here r equal 1, and we prove the divisor for these morphism coincides. So we prove that the loss of money space is isomorphic to this space FN bar, which is compactification, which is in CP1N. Okay, then I will skip this for demonstration on an N equal 5. And just to mention because here about toric paratis, but remains one thing why I mentioned loss of money in space, because combining the result of mining Caprano, Delphin, Serganova, one can say that one can see that Loss of money in space with n paint in white points is a smooth projective variety over permutahedron permutahedron variety. And it actually can be obtained as a closure of principal orbit in a complete complex flag manifold.
00:47:06.667 - 00:48:33.001, Speaker B: So, according our results, these so these permutor hetero variety can be mapped up to be rational morphism to the Dorby space of the Grossmanian gene 2. And now one can ask the question. One can ask the question, okay, since this permutahedral variety is a graph associated variety, so which these varieties can be related to our orbit space through the module spaces of weighted curves. And there are not many, there are not many overlapping, because there is the result which says that storic variety, which is variety associated with graph G is isomorphic to a modular space of stable genus zero curves to weighted modulo space, if and only if G is iterated cone over some discrete set of vertices. So, as a corollary, we we can see that the graph associate notoric varieties for the graph G, which is cone which is actually iterated cone over some vertices can be met by partial morphism to the to this variety. And as I mentioned this, in this way we prove that our orbit space is a universal object for all host spaces. First, all Haas spaces are b rationally equivalent.
00:48:33.001 - 00:49:33.631, Speaker B: One can easily see that there are no morphism between them. In general, between loss and money spaces, there exists irrational morphism. But what we hear, what we prove that using this that all our spaces of parameters of chamber are irrationally equivalent. There are no directional morphism between them. But what is somehow final result is that any has a space module space there exists b rational morphism to some space of parameters F omega of our orbit space gn2 by tn. So up to virginal up to virtual morphism, any cassette space can be can be mapped to a variety in a orbit space gn2 by tn. And what would be related to this? There are many, many questions that can be that can be asked here.
00:49:33.631 - 00:50:12.457, Speaker B: First, one can consider geometric complexity of torus action. When we have the torus acting of manifold M2N with the moment map and reduced moment map. Then, when k is equal n pre image of a point is a point. So we have a toric quasi toric toric manifold when can is equal n -1. In most cases, when we take two points x and Y from the interior of the moment polytope, then the pre images are homomorphic. So we take nose moment map from the orbit space. We take the pre images pre images are homo morphic.
00:50:12.457 - 00:51:08.881, Speaker B: So when we consider say G42, we proved it in our paper with Victor Matric that pre Images are homomorphic CP1. When we consider T3 action flag manifolds, flag manifolds are mentioned several times. The pre image is also going to be CP1. Then the pre image of Hamiltonian T and minus action on a simple activity manifold, the preimage of the points from the interior are also all homeomorphic where K is less equal n -1. Then we may have we have an example that the pre images are not homeomorphic. For the first time example each appear is n equal 5. We take Grassmann manifold GN2 moment map from G52 to t5 to delta 52 and then we may find two points such that the primitives are not homomorphic.
00:51:08.881 - 00:52:22.051, Speaker B: And so the orbit space is much much more complicated. And so what are the problem? Classify at least not classify some one can classify the pre images for Centauru section of the points from up to homeomorphism B. Rational equivalence. In our case, in a Grassmann manifold GN2, since the pre image of a point is actually the spatial parameters F omega for the chamber that point belongs. An appropriate problem would be find criterion for classification of these spaces in terms of asset and the loss of money spaces. And I just want one more thing to mention, since our F omega we have when we we have the the complexity of the action in also algebraic geometry. When we have the action of algebraic torus in our case, our space of parameters F omega are nothing else but the orbits spaces of the union of the strata for sigma is omega by the action of the bright torus.
00:52:22.051 - 00:52:52.335, Speaker B: So we related our spaces of parameters F omega with the modular spaces. But our spaces of parameters F omega belong to the to the problems of our space of parameters F omega are actually the orbit spaces by the action of Gabriel. So somehow these results in the research is related to the action to the algebraic toru section of the positive complexity. Thank you very much. I'm sorry for.
