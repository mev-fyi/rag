00:00:00.360 - 00:00:29.954, Speaker A: Afternoon. There was an interesting article yesterday in the newspaper. Well, obituary. I just thought I might draw it to your attention. Scientists transformed the study of memory. Endel Tuving, 1927 to 2023. Endo Tuving, who transformed the study of human memory with revelatory observations about how the brain stores and retrieves information.
00:00:29.954 - 00:01:32.572, Speaker A: For example, differentiating from knowing what a shoe is to remembering the purchase of limited edition nikes, died September 11 at a retirement home in Mississauga. He was 96. Tuving, a cognitive psychologist who taught at the University of Toronto for 35 years, almost single handedly pushed his field to sink of memory as something more than just one big pile of information, memories, and experiences. His peers recalled him as a towering figure in psychology and neuroscience. So the two forms of memory that he described, he picked out were semantic memories. For instance, knowing that George Washington was the first president of the United States, well, okay, so the occasion analog would be that Sir John A. McDonald was the first prime minister of the United.
00:01:32.572 - 00:02:16.544, Speaker A: Of the country, although the head of state would have been Queen Victoria. Okay. Or that semantic memory would be that cats look different from dogs. The other form of memory, as he coined the term, was episodic experience of eating a delicious croissant after shopping on the Avenue des Champs Elysees. That's a French. Oh, all right. So there's a.
00:02:16.544 - 00:07:09.956, Speaker A: Soving was recognized for drawing a distinction between semantic memory and episodic memory. Okay, well, let me run through people's names to see if I can improve my familiarity, improve my acquaintance with people whose name. Thank you. Abigail Arsino Alexander Boland Jing Kwan Kao thank you Jack Ceroniya Chen Siddhartha Daniel Dima Emil Fredfeld Justin Foos thank you Sabek Trememy Charles Griffin Ken May Grover Henry Hua thank you Joel Kasan. Thank you Alexander Koh Chow Xiang mine drawing ye local Yife lu lu k Lukashi thank you abu bakr mohithan I think Ruben Navar Saudi Jonathan King Vishiba Siyot Mohammed Raza Hygie Very Thai Iran Wang Hong boang paradong way Chikan Wong Huyan Gujari Gugu Darjeeling can you joke in, please? Okay, William, we've been discussing a number of things, and what I like to do, sometimes, a lot of the time, maybe depending on how people react to it, what I'd like to do is cover something up, covers the. Some of what, some of the basic ideas surrounding something, and then. And then put it down for a while and then promising to come back to it.
00:07:09.956 - 00:09:09.236, Speaker A: There must be a number of things that we've done that with so far, one of them, for instance, being the relationship between the two, two definitions of k zero, the module definition and the definition in terms of idempose. Very roughly speaking, the correspondence is, if you have an algebra and you have an idempotent, then if you look at a times e, then that's the left module over a left module over a. Okay, conversely. Well, and what kind of a module is it? Well, it's a, it's a projective, projective module and it's singly generated, okay, generated, because every, every element is equal to something in a times either. And so it's the, and it contains e, because you could take e times e, or if a has a unit, then you can take, I guess we're talking about modules. Normally we assume the algebra as a unit. Otherwise you have to adjoin with, and, okay, so it's a projective singly generated module and it's an arbitrary exercise.
00:09:09.236 - 00:10:16.330, Speaker A: Every single generated module over a is exactly equal to a times or isomorphic, isomorphic to a times e. For some idempotent element equal to its square in a itself, you don't have to go to matrices. So the, that's an exercise. And then further exercise is to check what you do with, in a matrix algebra. How, if you have a height and potent, in a matrix algebra, what is the finitely generated projective module that corresponds to it in this natural way, giving you taking equivalence to equivalence. Kubernetes duas morphism. Well, I'll give you a, by the way, remember how much is dictum? Professor Paul Helmoss is victim.
00:10:16.330 - 00:11:07.914, Speaker A: For every problem, there's an easier problem. Okay, so instead of taking an arbitrary idempotent in, so take two by two matrices instead of just n by n matrices. And then we've been, we've done one by one matrices, take two by two matrices. And look at, look at the, instead of looking at an arbitrary idempotent, what it will, zero is too easy because zero module is finitely generated and direct sum in the free module. But let's take the identity, let's take the unit element. What's the unit element of two by two matrices? Ovary. Remind me, remind me of your name.
00:11:07.914 - 00:11:49.024, Speaker A: Is that your last name? Oh, okay. And what, what is the, if we, what, what's the den, what's the identity element for multiplication with the two by two matrices over a? Yeah. So this is, this is a. And now, now take two by two matrices over. Right. And that's an algebra. Right.
00:11:49.024 - 00:12:25.566, Speaker A: Okay. What was the last word you said. Yeah. Okay. So that's the unit of that algorithm. Okay, well, if that's an idempotent, why don't we try inside a itself? The module corresponding to the idempotent one is just a times one. Which is what? Which is a.
00:12:25.566 - 00:12:55.944, Speaker A: And that's considered. That's called the singly generated free module. The free module with a single generator. Okay. And the reason that a times e is projective is that it is a direct summon of a free module. In other words, there's another module. There's another module, m, such that ae plus m is.
00:12:55.944 - 00:13:36.744, Speaker A: While it's finitely generated free. That means it's isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of. Okay, okay. And as left module. Okay, so what's m? Can you tell me what m should be to get the ae? And what. And how many of these should I take? What's the smallest number we can. We probably can't do it just with, um.
00:13:36.744 - 00:14:15.024, Speaker A: We probably can't do it just with, uh. Actually, maybe we can do it with just one generator. How about, um. How about just saying, uh, if e is an ideal a, then can we find a module such that perhaps a sub module of a such that a times either plus the other module, direct sum is isomorphic to a. Yes, Charles. Okay. Did you already know that when you came into this room or.
00:14:15.024 - 00:14:22.756, Speaker A: I'm just curious. Sorry. Okay, good. Yeah. So. But. Okay, well, that's what I like to see.
00:14:22.756 - 00:14:53.492, Speaker A: I like to see someone doing a calculation and even telling people what the answer is, even though it might not be. Right. Okay. The worst thing that could happen is everyone laughed. Right? How bad is that? You know, I started wearing glasses when I was in grade three, maybe something like that. And I got them over the Easter holidays. And I was late.
00:14:53.492 - 00:15:15.264, Speaker A: I was late. I'll never be late. Well, I can't say that. But anyway, when I walked into the classroom a few seconds later, everyone laughed. I like to think it was a friendly welcome. Okay. All right.
00:15:15.264 - 00:15:40.134, Speaker A: Yes. Okay. So Charlie is saying, take a e direct sum with a times one minus e. And by the way, one minus e is also an idempotent. Right? You square that, you'll get the same thing. Try it. And so a times one minus e is singly generated.
00:15:40.134 - 00:16:14.104, Speaker A: Well, a times anything is single generated. But it's productive because the a. If you just even, just even just take plus, you don't have to take the direct sum. If you look at ae plus some a times one minus e, you can put a dot over the plus sign. Because the intersection is zero. You can call it internal direct sum. And so this is, and it's isomorphic to the external direct sum, which is just abstract.
00:16:14.104 - 00:16:58.136, Speaker A: But then this is easier to calculate because you just notice, you just prove that ae plus a times one minus e is equal to a. Okay? Everyone agree? Okay. You have to remember what it means to add sets. Okay? These are sets. So you take an arbitrary element here, an arbitrary element here, and take the sum, okay? And that's the, that's what the, that's what the sum is without the dot. Then the dot is just to tell people that whatever the sum is equal to, it's a direct sum. It's an internal direct sum which is isomorphic, the external direct sum.
00:16:58.136 - 00:17:49.882, Speaker A: Which means that a times e itself is projective. Projective. And that's first thing we do, okay? But that. So now if we look at 1001 in m two a. We want to get this as a module over a, okay? We want to find a corresponding module. Corresponding module. Let's leave that as the next step in the exercise of taking arbitrary idempotent in a matrix algebra, which is what you do to get k zero.
00:17:49.882 - 00:18:29.460, Speaker A: By the idempotent definition. It works just as with a. Usually you do it with, in the book, in the textbook it's done with star items over joint item Boolean and the star algebra. But it um. It's a similar definition without the star operation, as was shown by Kovansky. Okay? And for c str, you get the same answer, okay. Because every idempotent is similar, is equivalent in the algebraic sense to a self adjoint item.
00:18:29.460 - 00:19:21.230, Speaker A: Potent. You have to use spectral theory for that. And this is in the book, by the way. And it's important for periodicity defined in terms of star algebra. Because you need to just look at the Banach algebra. And furthermore, if two projections are equivalent in the sense of just, of an algebra, if two self adjoint item potents are equivalent in the Koplansky sense, then they're equivalent in the Murray von Neumann sense. Okay? That means that the semigroup is the same semigroup coming from and the semi group coming from projection.
00:19:21.230 - 00:20:14.734, Speaker A: So if we joined on importance, but this is only not known for an arbitrary star algebra, that's convenient for sea Star algebra. It's true for sea star algorithm. So it's convenient to define k zero in terms of projection, in terms of self adjoint items. This is, this advantage of this is it works for an arbitrary algebra over a field or even over the integer and in the important case of the. Gives you the specialized answer. Okay, so that's one thing we were discussing. What was another thing we discussed? Jack, do you want.
00:20:14.734 - 00:21:12.540, Speaker A: Is there something else you would like to see? Left a loose end with and we'd like to see it taken up again. Like, did we finish UHF algebra? Okay, well, of course I didn't do it. I don't think I actually. I don't remember standing at the board and checking out loud that Dixma is numbers. Radical observation, Mister Lao. Joshua Lau was reminding me that a few years after Dixmeyer's paper on UHF algebra, someone. Someone else worked out similar.
00:21:12.540 - 00:21:37.204, Speaker A: The same. The same number theory observation in the setting of solidoid, the topology. Okay, but it was. It was three years afterwards, but. So there's the basic fact that this has to be. It requires heavy arithmetic. Okay, maybe not heavy for me, but heavy for you.
00:21:37.204 - 00:22:28.888, Speaker A: I learned arithmetic when I was in school. Well, okay, that may be something. Maybe now, maybe fewer people after me learned arithmetic, but maybe they learned it even better. No, you know, they don't even claim to teach arithmetic anymore. It's claimed to teach mathematics, but I don't think you can even say that arithmetic is mathematics. Sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't. Please don't speak quite so fast.
00:22:28.888 - 00:22:44.718, Speaker A: The 50 years difference makes you. I think people. I think the language is speeding up, but I haven't. Do you like how they're teaching? Well, I haven't been there for a while. No, no, I don't. I don't know. I.
00:22:44.718 - 00:23:12.864, Speaker A: I don't have children. I have nieces and nephews, but there. Great great niece and great nephew. Well, okay, but that's sort of changing the subject. I just said something is it's not mathematics. And you asked me about mathematics. You asked me a question about mathematics.
00:23:12.864 - 00:23:43.404, Speaker A: I would say it's not. I mean, one thing is important in mathematics is logic. So I'm complaining, right? Okay, but no, it's a pretty diffuse complaint. All right, so. So there was this number theory theorem. Okay, so that is mathematics. To prove it, you have to do arithmetic.
00:23:43.404 - 00:24:29.106, Speaker A: But I think you say that mathematics is by definition, mathematics is fun. Okay, I think we could say foods, arithmetic. Unless you really enjoy flashcards or something like that, which is what I eventually end up, well, not liking and not disliking so much. Okay, this was at home. I don't know if I would have reacted to the school. Okay, so. But this is something to check, right? If you have a.
00:24:29.106 - 00:25:25.954, Speaker A: First of all, always do the easy case. First, follow how much is. Can save a lot of trouble by picking out the simple case first, because it somehow allows you to organize your thinking with fewer complications. All right. I think in general, it's almost always very good advice. Okay, so what's the special case of a supernatural number? Now I'm going to have to. I'm sorry, I'm very slow with name.
00:25:25.954 - 00:26:08.602, Speaker A: Very slow. But now, what was the question? Oh, what's the special case of. If we want to show that the supernatural number gives rise to a subgroup of the rational number, then I guess if it's the. If it's the supernatural number one, what we're going to get. What group are we going to get? Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah. I didn't catch that because I was expecting you to say the interview.
00:26:08.602 - 00:26:27.528, Speaker A: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But generally speaking, maybe it's better to avoid mathematical notation when you can, when it's convenient. But that's just an example. Okay. I mean, maybe I'm special. Maybe I catch. Maybe I'm especially slow hearing and catching on.
00:26:27.528 - 00:26:44.424, Speaker A: Okay, but, um. Okay, so. So what if you have a general natural number, then what's the corresponding. I guess it's sort of clear then what? Almost clear what the corresponding subgroup of the rational numbers would be. Right. Yeah. Okay.
00:26:44.424 - 00:27:08.024, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. The notation is helped, right? Yeah. So here's a case where it's hard to maybe. Well, notation does help. If you say one over n times z, then that's just ordinary arithmetic, right? If it's natural. If it's an ordinary natural number, not equal to zero.
00:27:08.024 - 00:27:46.424, Speaker A: Sometimes it's convenient to include zero in counting numbers. Okay, but then, does everyone know what to do when n becomes a supernatural number, which is defined in terms of prime factor decomposition? Prime, prime, prime. Power. One. Quicker decomposition. Right. Archipelago, is that you? Okay, do you know how to do it? If it's.
00:27:46.424 - 00:28:20.224, Speaker A: Supposedly. It's two to the infinity, then what? Supposedly the supernatural number is two to the power infinity. Sorry? Well, so the two to the infinity you take with a grain of salt. The important thing is the exponent, which is infinite. Okay, and then if it's a finite. If it were a finite exponent, just with one prime number, then it would be a natural number. But if it's of infinite power, then.
00:28:20.224 - 00:28:39.884, Speaker A: Then what? Well, it's just a convention. Yes. Please say your name again quickly. Okay. I'll be able to find out. Very sorry. It's on the list.
00:28:39.884 - 00:29:24.284, Speaker A: Oh, okay. Well, then my reading and pronunciation are just very bad. Well, looking at the wrong list okay. Hussein. Andrew. Yes. So what would the group be for the time number two and the exponent and infinite exponential, is it just the infinite direct sum? Well, I'd say that's a very good guess, but it's.
00:29:24.284 - 00:29:52.100, Speaker A: Because for one thing, the group we're talking about is not going to be finitely generated. Okay. And the group you mentioned is not finitely generated infinite direct sum. Okay, but Abigail, would you want to comment on that? Yes. I saw you put up your hand. Okay, so you're suggesting something apparently different. Okay, well, then.
00:29:52.100 - 00:30:17.578, Speaker A: But I guess it's a question to prove those two groups are different. Abigail is suggesting that it's a different answer. Now, conceivably, at this stage, you could both be right that the groups might be isomorphic. We're just talking about groups. The order relation is not. Especially if it's a subgroup with the rational numbers. Then there's a natural order relation.
00:30:17.578 - 00:30:39.024, Speaker A: We don't have to talk about it. But we don't. But in dixmage paper, you don't talk about it anyway. Okay, but. Okay, well, there's something to think about, right. Is it the same group or is it a different one? Pardon? Yes. Okay, good.
00:30:39.024 - 00:31:18.560, Speaker A: That's what I call a lightning computation. And I like to do those. And sometimes they're right. Okay, so. And so the. Did anyone. Did anyone manage to take the whole assembly of supernatural numbers and recognize them as a topological space? If you can, yeah.
00:31:18.560 - 00:31:55.134, Speaker A: Is there a natural topology which is familiar? Of course. Every set you can give it a discrete topology, but that's generally. Maybe that's all you can do in general. But you can hope sometimes to have a more interesting. Recognize a more interesting topology. Well, okay, remember its sequences of exponents, right? And. Yeah, that's.
00:31:55.134 - 00:32:18.384, Speaker A: You can remember that some of the exponents are zero and one. Right? And you take infinite sequences of zeros and ones. That's familiar. Right? And the infinite product, the Cartesian product is called the canter set. Right, but it's not the middle third function. But it's. Anyway, Charlie, was that what you were going to say? Sorry.
00:32:18.384 - 00:32:32.860, Speaker A: Okay. Was that all you were going to say? Yeah. Supernatural. Supernatural. Okay, that's. Okay. We were arguing about discrete.
00:32:32.860 - 00:33:03.014, Speaker A: Okay. If it's the super. If it's a natural number, then discrete is all you can do. Again, but don't forget the exponents also, if possible. Well, natural numbers come in two ways in this setting, and as they come in as special cases of supernatural numbers. But then they're not all there, right? No, they are, they're starting at one. They're all there.
00:33:03.014 - 00:34:11.778, Speaker A: One, two, three and so on. Those are supernatural numbers. Yes. Can you define a topology on the dyadic, the triadic and so on? Well, we don't want to mix up between the, the supernatural numbers and the elements of the corresponding group. So if you look at supernatural numbers and include natural numbers starting at one, but then if you look at possible exponents of prime numbers that each one individually gives you, well, if it's a finite exponent, it gives you a natural number. So it starts at zero. So two to the zero is one, and that's a natural number, and two to the one is two, and so on.
00:34:11.778 - 00:35:07.922, Speaker A: Then the difference with exponents is that they're not just natural numbers starting at zero, they're also, you're also allowed to have infinity. So the exponents, the exponents are discrete, right? Sorry. The finite exponents are discrete, but the infinite one is piled on as a limit in an actual way. If you take that topology on the, when we talked about the infinite product, when you speak, when you were discussing, when you were suggesting the infinite product of sets, then for the just zero one, you take the discrete topology. But if you take the going 0123 up to infinity, it's not the discrete topology. You take the topology where the isolated points converge to the point of infinity. But that's totally disconnected.
00:35:07.922 - 00:35:57.490, Speaker A: That's totally disconnected. And if you take infinite product of copies of that, then it'll be still totally disconnected. And if it's metrisable to begin with, it's compact and metrisable to begin with, it'll be compact and metrizable afterwards. And there's one more thing you have to check to show that it's the Cantor sand. Okay, what's that, Jack? What do you need to check to, Abigail, what do you need to check to get that totally disconnected compact metric space is the counter set. Are you familiar with that characterization? Cantor set? There's one more. One property, one additional property you need, for instance, to take a single point.
00:35:57.490 - 00:36:49.466, Speaker A: That's not the Cantor set, is it? Right, well, that's better. That's post, but I'm sure it doesn't include some things. Yes. Doc, do you have that at your fingertips? Well, okay, but dense is something that applies to a subset, right? But it doesn't necessarily apply to the whole, just to a whole space. If it's a subset of a metric space, then you can say it's dense or of a topological space. That means the closure is everything. But there's another way of saying dense, too.
00:36:49.466 - 00:37:11.294, Speaker A: That order statically. You say that any two points have something strictly between them. Yes. Well, it's compact and metrics based. It's automatically complete. Okay, that's, that's good, but. Yes, Doctor Prava.
00:37:11.294 - 00:37:34.478, Speaker A: Sorry. Well, okay, but I. That's. We. I think I may have mentioned that because the original set is totally disconnected, the. Any cartesian product of copies of it will be totally disconnected and also compact if it's compact. But there's.
00:37:34.478 - 00:38:18.500, Speaker A: You've got to. And you've got to exclude it being a single point, but you've got to go just a little farther than that if it's. And you want to exclude that as two points or the. Okay, well, I'm not going to. I don't think I'll let the cat out of the bag, but this is a good exercise. Okay. It's kind of fundamental, not just in sister algebra theory, but the point is that if you take a totally distant compact metric space, then with a very simple additional condition, it has to be the cantor set.
00:38:18.500 - 00:38:49.474, Speaker A: Now, it will imply that it's uncountable with making all suggestions, but it's not. That's not. I don't think that's a strong enough restriction. Yes, well, compact, very good. But that's automatic if it's compact metric. Okay, compact metric spaces as a countable basis of open sets, you know, it has accountable length set geometric spaces. That's equivalent.
00:38:49.474 - 00:39:29.924, Speaker A: Okay, so let's just leave that as something to think about. Yeah. Yeah. What's the difference between. If you look at compact metric spaces that are totally disconnected, then a priori, there are many, many of those, okay. And most of them are uncountable. But question, which one is it possible to single out by a simple.
00:39:29.924 - 00:39:49.116, Speaker A: By a simple property? Which one of them is the counterset Jack? Do you remember that? Yeah. It's something you have to remember or it takes a while to figure out. Okay, well, you. I'm guessing you're remembering that now. Okay, good. No, good, good. No, no.
00:39:49.116 - 00:40:08.564, Speaker A: Okay. But it's an impolite question, but I'm just curious. I'm curious about things like that because it would be. I think. I wasn't expecting anyone to work at error. Okay. It's a somewhat subtle fact.
00:40:08.564 - 00:40:45.986, Speaker A: Well, somewhat, rather, rather subtle fact. And it's something that's so elegant that it's a single condition which eliminates all of these compact, total, disconnected metric spaces, except just a single one. Okay, maybe the single one. Maybe the single one. Is a key memory key, because the extra condition is the single isolated point. Okay. It should not be there, which excludes the case that the whole thing is a single point.
00:40:45.986 - 00:41:22.844, Speaker A: Right. For instance. But very elegant. And if you want to put it in as an exercise, that's fine. The proof, I mean, it's, you may have to work a bit to work it out, to have a bit of arithmetic problem. Okay, so what's there was the UHF algebras, which are parameterized by this canter set. Very nice space.
00:41:22.844 - 00:42:23.082, Speaker A: And then there's the isomorphism classes. Well, that's exactly, it turns out it's exactly the same thing. Right. You have, how many boards are there? Well, um. So, um, you have, if you look at supernatural numbers as a category. Well, this is, I brought this chalk. I'm responsible for it.
00:42:23.082 - 00:42:55.714, Speaker A: It's doesn't write very well. I hope it erases. Okay, so this is a category and the arrows are n divides n prime. Okay? Meaning the exponents are larger. They prime each, each corresponding exponents get larger. Okay, and then look at UHF. There's a natural construction.
00:42:55.714 - 00:43:26.014, Speaker A: You have the supernatural number. That means you have the exponents. So you look at m to the two, to the e two. E two is the exponent for two, sorry. Yeah. And then tensor m three to the e three exponent for prime number three, and so on. This is infinite algebraic tensor product, the increasing union in a natural way.
00:43:26.014 - 00:44:40.854, Speaker A: And, and if you have, so the, you have the largest one where all the exponents are infinite. And then if it's, if some of the exponents are finite, you just take the first finite number of them. I mean, you, in other words, you take, you write this as m two. Well, it's contained in, this one is contained in m two to the infinite number of times. And if you have a larger exponent, so you take, by definition, you take the first e, two of them, okay? And a larger exponent then will give you a larger algebra, larger subalgebra. Okay, so it's a function. So the arrows here are punitive homomorphism.
00:44:40.854 - 00:45:48.540, Speaker A: Okay, those, so that's, that's a, that's a functor between categories. And then UHF. Turns out that you can recover, almost recovering the supernatural number immediately. But the easiest way is to do it with the group. Okay, so, um, groups containing the integers, as Tusam said, and contained in the rational numbers, okay, and, um, and so, so the special case, mn, it's a, it is a function, but it has the property to take mn into what does Jack was it you, that reminded us of the notation for the group. Who was it? Whose n? Was it you? Okay, so. And it was one over n times that, right? Yeah.
00:45:48.540 - 00:47:03.304, Speaker A: Okay, so mn goes to one over n times z. And, and it defined rerobatory algebras, including anything isomorphic to mn, where you've forgotten the n. Okay? You just know it arises as UHF algebra. It's isomorphic to one of the mns, but then they somehow you get the n coming out of the blue. Okay, this group immediately tells you what n is. The last puncture is going back here, okay? And that's just the one to one correspondence, hijacked the correspondence between the groups and the supernatural. Okay, so, so we were discussing that, and also there's the free floating version of it, okay? And I remember you sent me an email questioning what the purpose of the, of the free floating algebra was based on a given algebra.
00:47:03.304 - 00:48:13.824, Speaker A: And in particular, what's, what's the purpose of a free floating algebra? What's the purpose of having an algebra which is isomorphic to its own free floating algebra? Well, so, by the way, if it, if it's any, if it's a free floating algebra, the infinite matrix algebra based with entries in a given algebra, then it's always free. It's always isomorphic. Just take that algebra and take the free floating algebra over it. Then it's, you don't get anything new. It's the free floating algebra over a free floating algebra. Is the same algebra up to I smarter than, that's a good exercise. Working with infinite cardinals says that l of zero times l of zero is l of zero.
00:48:13.824 - 00:49:03.294, Speaker A: But, but, so the, but if you look at a unital algebra, then they take the free floating algebra won't be unital. So free floating algebra of the UHF algebra will not be UHF. And in fact, the classification in this particular case, this, the free floating algebras have a wilder classification than the free floating ones. It's not super natural. It's several different ends will give you the same free floating algebra. And that's a very good exercise. Okay, but the main, main point of the free floating, in that setting, the free floating algebras are worse.
00:49:03.294 - 00:50:20.474, Speaker A: They're worse than the ones they're based on, okay, because the ones are based on, the isomorphism is very smoothly parameterized. Isomorphism classes just by supernat. But it's a slightly tricky exercise to look at the equivalent situation on supernatural to saying they correspond to UHF algebra. And it's, but, but in fact, these free floating algebras are better to work with in general, because even if something is not free floating in general, it's never going. The isomorphism classes have a certain class of algebra. For instance, the Af algebras, even simple unital af algebra, these are special cases of simple unital af algebras, but they're very, very well behaved. Arbitrary simple simple unital af algebras, they're already badly behaved, okay? In the sense that the isomorphism classes are wild.
00:50:20.474 - 00:51:08.550, Speaker A: And so the, if you, if you, but take a look at the free floating algebras based on these, they're not any worse. In fact, they're better, because already for these you need the k zero functor. It's not, you don't just have a group, I don't have a subgroup of q, a specific subgroup of q. You have a functor, okay? You have an abstract group, abstract order group for simple unit of af algebra. And in addition, you have to carry along the class of the unit as an element of this ordered group. But if you take a look at the free floating algebra a, there's no units. So that's, maybe that's, that sounds bad, but that means there, know what that means in practice is that you don't need to worry about the unit.
00:51:08.550 - 00:51:51.916, Speaker A: So if you look at the k zero group, it's just an order group. You don't need to keep track of any of the class of the unit. And that's a much simpler, that's a much simpler and better thing to look at. For instance, here's an example of why it's better so already in the case just of q, okay, so instead of looking at the invariant including the one, then there are no automorphisms, okay, no automorphisms of this group which fix it. Fix the .1 automorphism. A group automorphism of q, it fixes the, .1
00:51:51.916 - 00:53:25.678, Speaker A: then it has to be identity. But in general, if you pass to the free floating algebra and look at the k zero group that you get, so this is q, this is k zero of a certain UHF. But if you just look at q itself, then this is k zero of a free floating algebra, okay? And there are automorphisms of this, and they come from automorphisms of the free floating algebra, okay, you can multiply everything by two, and so that's, and so on the free floating algebra, you, you look at the trace and you, and you do the automorphism of q, multiplying it by two. That's a group automorphism, right? Then that will multiply the trace by the number two. We have an automorphism that shifts the trace, it changes the trace, which is very useful in applications. Okay, so that's a brief review of some of the things we've discussed, and I'd like to think that it formed good basis for exercises or even essays. So we owe something else to review.
00:53:25.678 - 00:54:36.902, Speaker A: Is the proof of the classification theorem, the proof of the classification theorem for af algebra, af isomorphism theorem. Remember, if you have two inductive limits, two inductive limit sequences, I had an intertwining of the a zero groups, and then I lifted each of the arrows to the arrows between the algebras, okay? And then I changed the arrows, one each arrow. I changed once to have the same action on k zero. That's how, that's how I managed to change it, but I changed each arrow. Once you get a commutative diagram, okay, once it's a commutative diagram, then you get an isomorphism with a limit between the algebra instead of just one between the, between the, so this is between the algebra. Just dotted line means they exist, you get them, and solid line means you're given them. Okay, well, that's, that's okay, I've done it again.
00:54:36.902 - 00:54:45.694, Speaker A: Okay. I mean, yeah, well, everyone can walk out now, okay.
