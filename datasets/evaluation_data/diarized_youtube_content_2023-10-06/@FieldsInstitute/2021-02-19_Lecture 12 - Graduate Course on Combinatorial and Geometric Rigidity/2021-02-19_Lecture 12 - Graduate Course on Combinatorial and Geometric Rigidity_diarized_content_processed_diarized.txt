00:00:00.960 - 00:00:47.832, Speaker A: We now know we're talking about generic global rigidity. We now know that every generic globally rigid framework is redundantly rigid and d plus one connected. And we have this stress matrix which gives an algebraic sufficient condition for global rigidity. And we also talked about one dimensional global rigidity, where we showed that every two connected graph was globally rigid on the line. And so the combinatorial step there was pretty easy, and I think I left it as an exercise. It was to show that every minimally two connected graph could be reduced to a smaller two connected graph by a one reduction, so by the inverse operation to a one extension. So now we really want to do that in two dimensions.
00:00:47.832 - 00:01:28.894, Speaker A: So we want to characterize global rigidity for frameworks, generic frameworks in r two. And so we're going to be looking at when can we find a degree free vertex and when can we apply a one reduction to it. But this is going to be much more complicated, and so I won't manage to do it all in this lecture. So it will take at least two, probably three lectures. This particular lecture, I think, is kind of a difficult one to give because it's going to be very technical, combinatorial. But actually. So I have two papers where I look at analogous results for other sparsity matroids.
00:01:28.894 - 00:02:10.092, Speaker A: And still I read the paper of Bergen Jordan that today's lecture is based on, and wonder how they came up with it, because it's very intricate and you'll see as we go. But I think it's kind of a hard lecture to present. So I'm strictly saying this because I would like it if you interrupt me, things become unclear. Then please do interrupt and we'll try and go through it, because it's going to be quite technical, combinatorics. Okay, so remember, we have the generic D dimensional rigidity matriid RD. So this is just the linear matrix, or the rho matriid of the rigidity matrix at some generic point P. So a state RD here.
00:02:10.092 - 00:02:43.574, Speaker A: But we're only going to be interested in the two dimensional rigidity matridge. So, and in particular, we're going to be interested in dependent sets, in the rigidity matriarch. And the fundamental case of dependent sets is circuits. So we are going to define a graph. So I know in matrix the circuits are edge sets. But really, if going to abuse notation and think of a graph as a circuit. So if we have the rigidity matrix of some graph, then a sub graph of it, h, is called an two reals circuit.
00:02:43.574 - 00:03:22.114, Speaker A: If the number of edge, if the edge set of h is a circuit that is a minimally dependent set. So the edges of h, the rows of the rigidity matrix, are dependent. But if you take any one edge away, those rows become minimally independent. And what we're really going to do is think of circuits in this matrix. We're going to think of them as just purely a graph theory condition, because we're going to use the polycheck Geringer Leman theorem. Okay? So as a corollary of the Lantern theorem, you can deduce the following. So a graph is an two reals circuit if and only if it has 2 volts minus two edges.
00:03:22.114 - 00:03:49.900, Speaker A: And if you take any one edge away, you're minimally rigid. It doesn't matter which edge you pick, you take any one of them away. You get to a graph of e equals two, v minus three. And because you had a circuit before, by Leman's theorem, you will end up with a. Well, just because you had two b minus three before circuit, before you could take one away, it becomes minimally rigid. And this is equivalent to saying the number of edges is two, v minus two. Still.
00:03:49.900 - 00:04:41.312, Speaker A: But we know Laman's room, which expresses minimal rigidity as a purely graph theoretic property. So it says the number of edges induced by any subset x with a sufficient number of vertices is at most two x minus three. And of course, now we have the additional condition that the size of x has to be strictly less than the whole set v, because we know v has a minus two here, rather than the minus three, we have the sub graphs. So Leman's condition would be, would have a free and a free. But we know it's a two in total and it's free after you've deleted any edge, say, and it's free for any proper subgraph whatsoever. So these are the circuits in this, this nice matriid. So, sorry, I guess I answer question.
00:04:41.488 - 00:04:51.096, Speaker B: Yeah, for the first condition up there, up above, we're saying g is an two reals circuit, because any that's equivalent.
00:04:51.120 - 00:04:53.600, Speaker A: To the second one where g is minimally rigid.
00:04:53.712 - 00:04:59.324, Speaker B: Is that because any subgraph of g would be independent in the rigidity matrix?
00:04:59.924 - 00:05:35.984, Speaker A: Yes. So if you, if I give you a circuit and I take any edge away or take any proper subgraph, then you'll be independent in the rigidity matriarch. It, I mean in higher dimensions and two, it's not true that circuits are always rigid. So I'm sort of using Laman's theorem, which I haven't told you, that I didn't say a proof of this lemma to deduce this, because Leman's theorem implies that all of the circuits have exactly two b minus two edges. And when you throw one away, then the rows are independent and it's got two b minus three edges, so it's got the rank. It's the full thing for the rigidity matriid.
00:05:36.484 - 00:05:41.704, Speaker B: Yeah, sorry. Just sort of understand that out loud, but, yeah, thank you.
00:05:42.084 - 00:05:42.824, Speaker A: Great.
00:05:43.564 - 00:05:46.460, Speaker B: Tony, can we just pause and look at these for a moment?
00:05:46.612 - 00:06:00.644, Speaker A: Sure. So, do you want me to re explain, or do you just want to think for a minute?
00:06:02.984 - 00:06:12.524, Speaker C: I mean, when you say g is an r two circuit, can I think that the g is an r two circuit on the complete graph with the same number of vertices?
00:06:13.064 - 00:06:14.604, Speaker A: Yes. Yes.
00:06:19.724 - 00:06:28.184, Speaker B: Okay. I have a question about the I of x less than or equal to. Wasn't it a greater than or equal to in Le mans theorem?
00:06:28.724 - 00:07:11.214, Speaker A: So, Laman's theorem said g is minimally rigid if and only if e equals two v minus three. And I of x is at most two x minus three for all x in v with x greater than or equal, equal to two. So the sort of motivating example was something like this, where you really don't want it to be bigger than two v minus three for subsets, because then you could have something like a k four here, which has wasted edges, even though it satisfies the count. So it's definitely a less than or equal to, and it's the same less than or equal to here, that the only real difference is the change from the three to the two for the full graph.
00:07:12.374 - 00:07:14.074, Speaker B: Okay, great, thanks.
00:07:17.894 - 00:07:19.834, Speaker A: Okay, is everyone happy?
00:07:20.774 - 00:07:27.514, Speaker C: No. I don't understand that example that you just gave. Why is it minimally? Why is it rigid?
00:07:27.894 - 00:07:44.886, Speaker A: This one's not. So. Sorry. So this is an example why you needed. So, I think, I thought Alex asked about this inequality. And so this is an example that doesn't satisfy what's over here. So it satisfies the equality, but it does not satisfy the inequality for this k four subgraph.
00:07:44.886 - 00:07:50.734, Speaker A: And as you. I guess you worked out, it's flexible because this four cycle at the side can just move.
00:07:50.854 - 00:07:51.794, Speaker C: Okay, thanks.
00:07:54.054 - 00:08:07.254, Speaker B: So, basically, to get a circuit, you take like a two three tight graph and add an edge. But you want to make sure that all subgraphs still have this two x minus three condition.
00:08:08.034 - 00:08:46.104, Speaker A: Yes. So you're exactly right. So if you take any two free type graph and you add an edge, you will get a circuit. But what I want in my graph to be a circuit is for that circuit, you get to be the entire graph. So here's a sort of two free type graph. If I just add an edge, then what you can see here is that the circuit I've found is this little k four in the middle here, and you've got bits that just hang around. So for example, if I chose to delete this degree two vertex, I would take the total count of two b minus two to two b minus two, because I just lose two from the two edges and one times two vertex.
00:08:46.104 - 00:09:01.124, Speaker A: So you're right, you take a leman graph or two free type graph and you add one edge. But for the entire graph to be a circuit, rather than just contain a circuit, you have to be careful of which you pick to start with.
00:09:02.824 - 00:09:03.684, Speaker B: Okay?
00:09:05.584 - 00:09:37.622, Speaker A: Okay, so I will have some examples as we go, so hopefully it will start to become clearer. But please do keep interrupting if anything's unclear. So this learner is just sort of a motivational thing. So what we're really going to be interested in is d plus one connected redundantly rigid graph. So we're in two dimensions of free connect redundantly rigid graphs. So it's worth mentioning that redundant rigidity is very intimately linked to circuits. So again, I'm not going to give a proof, but this lemma is hopefully easy.
00:09:37.622 - 00:10:02.752, Speaker A: So a graph is redundantly rigid if and only if it is rigid. Clearly, redundantly rigid implies rigid. But also, as well as being rigid, it must be that every edge belongs to a circuit. So if it's rigid and every edge belongs to a circuit, if I throw any edge away, I don't change the rank. So it's still rigid. So it's redundantly rigid. And so this is the kind of motivation here.
00:10:02.752 - 00:10:34.736, Speaker A: But what we're saying is we understand rigid graphs in two dimensions, we want to understand circuits, and then that will help us to understand redundant rigidity. Okay, so here's a fact. I mean, so we just go back up. We know the total number of edges in a circuit is two v minus two, so the average degree is slightly less than four. But we can't have a degree two vertex from this sort of discussion we had here. So the minimum degree is always free. And so this is going to be helpful for us.
00:10:34.736 - 00:11:14.094, Speaker A: We have a degree free vertex we now want to find when we can reduce it in by a one reduction. As an aside, I've put an exercise in which tells you that this minimum degree, at least as a bound, not as a precise answer, sort of applies in any dimension. So it's not so hard. And actually you can look it up if you find the right reference, if it becomes tricky. But an exercise would be to show that every circuit in the d dimensional rigidity matriarch is d plus one edge connected. And if you're d plus one edge connected, then the minimum degree is certainly at least d plus one. So this fact actually generalizes a bit.
00:11:14.094 - 00:11:20.214, Speaker A: It's not true that it's equal to d plus one all the time, but it's at least d plus one all the time.
00:11:20.594 - 00:11:27.774, Speaker C: Okay, is it clear that it's, that it's three? Why can't it just be bigger than or equal to three?
00:11:28.314 - 00:11:52.818, Speaker A: Oh, so in a two dimensional circuit, we have e equals 2 volts two, which says that two e equals 4 volts four. And so twice the number of edges is equal to the sum of the degrees by the handshaking lemma. So if every vertex had degree four, then you, then two e would be equal to 4 volts, which is bigger than four, v minus four. So you must have something less than four.
00:11:52.906 - 00:11:54.134, Speaker C: Makes sense. Okay.
00:11:57.034 - 00:12:21.126, Speaker A: Okay. Yes. So remember, at the end of the last lecture, what we were doing was we were proving the one extension operation preserves global rigidity. So everything we're going to get from a globally rigid graph by one extensions will be globally rigid. So we talked about small complete graphs. Then k four is a very simple example of a two reals circuit. It's the smallest one.
00:12:21.126 - 00:12:54.744, Speaker A: So if we take k four, we showed it was globally rigid last time. Everything we get from k four by a sequence of one extensions, it turns out, is actually a circuit as well, and is a globally rigid one. So we're sort of looking at the right kind of thing for our global rigidity problem. But we're just in a particularly special case with circuits. But last time we also showed that we were doing sequences of edge additions and one extensions. But edge additions clearly can't preserve the property of being a circuit. You know, the total number of edges is this.
00:12:54.744 - 00:13:26.620, Speaker A: If you add one in, then that fails, and so you go outside the class. So we're just going to, we're going to forget about the edge additions part and just do one extensions. So here's a couple of examples of circuits. So first of all, g. So here we have four vertices of degree free. And so what's the point in this example? So what would happen if we did a one reduction is, let's say we pick this vertex. So I'll just draw it here.
00:13:26.620 - 00:14:00.092, Speaker A: So the rest of the graph would stay the same. We want to reduce this vertex by a one reduction, so its neighbors are these three. Two of those options are ruled out because we don't want to duplicate an edge. So our only option is to do this third one and we add this edge. But unlike. So what happened in the, when we were doing rigidity in the polych Geringer theorem was we picked a degree free vertex and we were able to prove we could always reduce it to a smaller two free type graph. And that would, would then made our life easy.
00:14:00.092 - 00:14:43.688, Speaker A: So this here showed that the only thing I could do to reduce this vertex here was reduce to this smaller graph, which has a k four, which is the circuit, and a degree two, which is not possible. So we did find a smaller graph from this reduction, but it wasn't a circuit. It contained a subgraph that was a circuit, but itself it wasn't a circuit. So that one reduction was not possible. It's what I will call a non admissible one reduction. Okay, and notice then by the symmetry that if I pick this degree free or this one or this one, you get exactly the same graph up to isomorphism. Oh, I think there's a question in the chat, sorry, I'm not quite so good at following the chat at the moment.
00:14:43.688 - 00:15:18.288, Speaker A: Is there an example where every edge belongs to a circuit but the graph is not rigid? Yes, so there's trivial examples. So suppose you have a complete graph and a hundred vertices there, and a complete graph and 100 vertices here, but they're not connected. So it's not connected. So it's clearly not rigid. Just fix one component and move the other one. But k four already has a, has a, is already circuit. So in fact, if you replace the k 100 with just this graph on two k four s, every edge is in a circuit, because both k four s are circuits, but it's not rigid.
00:15:18.288 - 00:16:28.398, Speaker A: And you could do the same example if you have them share a single vertex. So you have to be a bit more careful in just saying every edge is in a circuit. Okay, so, yeah, so going back to this picture, so what we just said is it's a, it's a circuit, but every possible degree free vertex and every possible one reduction at a degree free vertex gave us a graph which was not a circuit. So this says that this particular circuit here cannot be obtained from a smaller circuit by the one extension operation. The saving grace for us is that this circuit has a, I don't get it in red, but let me do it in green here, has a two vertex separating set here. And so what we're going to show is if you're free connected, which we need for redundant rigidity anyway, then our life is made easier and we will be able to find some vertex to reduce and which the resulting graph is a circuit. But even if we assume free connectivity like in this graph h, it's not true.
00:16:28.398 - 00:17:06.358, Speaker A: The nice thing, like it was in the Laman case, that every vertex of degree free can be reduced. So that's my, my next example. So if we kind of ignore the things around the outside and go back just to this example h. So what happens in h? So h has degree free vertices here, here and here, here. If we take v, imagine you did a one reduction at this vertex v, because all three of its neighbors have degree three. One of those neighbors will drop its degree to two. When we do the one reduction, I'll either add this edge or this edge or this one.
00:17:06.358 - 00:17:45.084, Speaker A: Whichever one I pick, the third vertex will have degree two. And so just like down here, it won't be a circuit. So v is not reducible. So it's what we will call it, non admissible when I define that shortly. But in h, it is true that there are some vertices that can be reduced. So for example, this one, if I take this vertex on the left and I reduce it and add that edge, then you can check for yourself, that will be a smaller circuit. So reducing the blue vertex and adding the dotted edge from v down this high degree vertex will be okay.
00:17:45.084 - 00:18:10.132, Speaker A: And so that's what we're going to have to do. We're going to make a connectivity assumption on our circuits and then we're going to find that still some are not good, but some are good. And we're going to have to prove that a good one always exists. Okay, so that's what I say here in the free connected graph h, there was an irreducible vertex, but there are also good ones.
00:18:10.328 - 00:18:16.744, Speaker B: Hey, Tom, did we already see that three connectivity is required?
00:18:18.204 - 00:18:19.504, Speaker A: Required for what?
00:18:20.724 - 00:18:22.384, Speaker B: For global rigidity.
00:18:22.964 - 00:18:51.492, Speaker A: Yes, so remember we showed that if you're globally rigid in RD, then you must be d plus one connected. So in the plane, the example would be. Sorry, the example would be if you have a. If you break it up via two vertices, so this is not reconnected, but you just put a line through those two vertices that separate the graph and reflect one component across the separating set cross, just reflect through that line.
00:18:51.588 - 00:18:55.236, Speaker B: Oh, I remember this last lecture, sir.
00:18:55.380 - 00:18:59.836, Speaker A: Last lecture, maybe two ago, I think, but very recently.
00:18:59.900 - 00:19:01.464, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, thanks.
00:19:03.824 - 00:19:44.714, Speaker A: Yes, so circuits like this one don't need to be free connected. But the circuits, we're going to be interested in the free connected ones because we're interested for global rigidity which requires free connectivity. Okay, so here's some, some notation. Given a graph I'm going to use v sub three to denote the set of vertices of degree free. Okay? So we're going to, we care about degree free vertices and we want to find one of them to reduce. So we're going to have this notation for the set of them all. And also rather than saying vertex of degree free, I'm going to use node to refer to a vertex of degree free.
00:19:44.714 - 00:20:29.774, Speaker A: And this subset, the subset v three of nodes will induce gv three. The subgraph induced by v three will be called the subgraph of nodes. And so we're going to work with these objects, okay? And it's also going to be important. And this is motivated by the second example I drew above that h example. So a node, if you think about it instead of as a vertex of g, but think about as a vertex in the subgraph of nodes, then g could have degree zero, one, two or three. So it's got three neighbors in g, but how many of those neighbors have degree three is the possible degrees of this node. And so we're going to split into various cases as we go.
00:20:29.774 - 00:21:03.454, Speaker A: So if the degree is at most one then it's a leaf node. If the degree is equal to two it's called a series node and if it's equal to three it's called a branching node. So these are their degrees in this subgraph of nodes. And the point of this is that, as we said before, I had a vertex whose neighbors were all degree free. But forget what happens in the rest of the graph. If I try and reduce v, then I have to add an edge somewhere and that will make the other vertex drop from degree three to degree two. So that's always going to be bad regardless of what happens over here.
00:21:03.454 - 00:21:36.668, Speaker A: So that means we need to rule out this case. We need to find a node that's in one of the other cases. But it also means for technical reasons what we're going to end up doing is saying, okay, there's, there's a bad node here and with some blocking set and we find something else here that's a node. But if it was a series node it might be that it has a neighbor over here. So it could be a series node in this. Maybe this is not such a useful picture, but just to complete with a sentence. Anyway, don't worry about it.
00:21:36.668 - 00:22:11.644, Speaker A: If it's not so clear, we had a bad node, which was bad because of a, a blocking set, and then you picked a different nodes elsewhere. And then over here it might have been good, but it might have one more neighbor over here that pushes the two up to a three if you move from a subgraph of the sub graph of nodes. And so we really want to have this distinction because it will be the series. Ones that go up would also be bad. But I think that's probably too vague at this point. We've got a fair bit of work to do to get to that point. Yes.
00:22:11.644 - 00:23:03.704, Speaker A: So this was the illustration of, part of the motivation for this, separating out nodes into their degree in the subgraph of nodes into leaf series and branching. Okay, okay, so another example, let's think about wheels. So wheels are a very nice class of graphs, and they're all circuits. So what is a wheel? Well, if you just keep adding degree twos on in a going round, then this is a nice minimally rigid graph in the plane, and we add one more edge, we get a nice circuit. So whatever size wheel, I mean, I could have had more vertices if you like, just kept going, made bigger and bigger wheel around the outside. This will always be a circuit. So wheel for me, wn is a cycle of length n plus a cone vertex.
00:23:03.704 - 00:23:54.496, Speaker A: So plus one vertex in the middle here, adjacent to, to everything. Okay, so what do I want to say about wheels? Well, they're special because of this sub graph of nodes thing. So in the middle, as long as the number of vertices and the wheels at least, well at least four on the cycle, then the vertex in the middle will have large degree, but every other vertex will have degree free. Okay, so if I look at the, the sub graph of the wheel induced by the vertices of degree free, then I get this cycle around the outside. Okay. And notice as well, if I want to go from one wheel to another, what I would do, say is take this edge, subdivide it and add it to the center. So that's a nice one extension.
00:23:54.496 - 00:24:35.502, Speaker A: And so if I wanted to undo that, I could delete this blue vertex v by deleting it and putting an edge across like that. And you can just keep going and going and going. So it's easy to see that every wheel is obtained from k four by one extensions. So wheels that are a nice little family of globally rigid frameworks in 2d that we can already see from the previous lecture are all done. But wheels are also exceptional in a sense that I just mentioned. So we just said that the subgraph of nodes in a wheel was a cycle. It's always the cycle around the outside of the wheels, everything apart from the vertex adjacent to everything else.
00:24:35.502 - 00:25:11.134, Speaker A: But if you're not a wheel, then this subgraph of nodes cannot have cycles, and that's what we're going to prove next. So if the graph is not a wheel but it is a circuit, then the subgraph of the vertices of degree three is acyclic. It's a forest. Okay, so let's go through that. So suppose it contains a cycle, and we're going to get contradictions. So if this sub graph contains a cycle, we may as well choose a shorter cycle c. So if your cycle had chords, you just pick a smaller cycle because the chord would give you a smaller cycle.
00:25:11.134 - 00:25:59.334, Speaker A: So I've got some cycle with no chords c in my subgraph of nodes. Oh, and sorry, I forgot to make a little correction here. So I want to use, but for lazy reasons I want to use c for both the vertex set and the edge set of the cycle. So apologies for that, but you could write out v of c and e of C if you, if you like, but I'm just going to use c for both the vertex and edge set. So g itself is not a cycle. So if I take the vertex set of g and subtract the vertices of the cycle, I still have some vertices left. Each vertex of this cycle I've found is a node because it's a part of the sub graph of nodes.
00:25:59.334 - 00:26:41.818, Speaker A: And since we're not the wheel, we know there's at least two vertices outside. So in the case of the wheel, the sub graph of nodes looks like that and there's exactly one morphing adjacent everywhere. But if I'm not the wheel, then those at least two vertices outside. Okay, so now I want to count what's the number of edges induced by the vertices outside of this particular cycle. Well, it's the number of vertices in the entire graph minus the number of edges induced by the cycle, minus the number of edges between the cycle and what's not in the cycle. So that's sort of evident. The number of edges, the whole graph stays the same.
00:26:41.818 - 00:27:15.034, Speaker A: The number of edges in a cycle is the number of vertices, so that's just c. And the number of edges between the cycle and the rest of the graph is c as well. So why is that? Well, I know I have some cycle, but I also know every vertex on the cycle has degree free. So if that's the cycle and this is the rest of the graph. There's one edge coming from there, one from there, one from there, one from there, one from there, one from there, and there were no chords. So none of those ones I just drew could do something like that. So there was exactly c of those as well.
00:27:15.034 - 00:27:46.314, Speaker A: But I've now got 2 volts minus two c, which is the number of vertices in over here. And I've got a minus two, but this is a proper subset of the vertex set with a minus two here on my count, rather than at most three. So this is a subset which contradicts the definition of a circuit. So we proved that this subgraph of nodes, when we're not a wheel, is cycle free. Okay, is that okay?
00:27:54.854 - 00:27:55.994, Speaker C: Yeah, that's good.
00:27:59.594 - 00:28:43.054, Speaker A: Okay, so here, this is, I guess this is really completely an aside. It's not relevant to the proof I'm going through, but if you want an exercise to do, it's sort of a nice little thing to do. If you draw a planar circuit, and you take a plane drawing of that circuit, and you take the planar jewel, then you should get another plane circuit. So that's an exercise to verify, if you like. Okay, so we've started to understand a bit about this subgraph of nodes, and we want to use it to apply one reductions. So first I want to just characterize the very simple thing. So I give you a vertex of degree free.
00:28:43.054 - 00:29:37.646, Speaker A: I apply a particular one reduction, what can go wrong? And a characterization of what can go wrong for just a one reduction at v which adds one particular edge. I know there's three possible edges, which is a bit harder to understand, but just adding one of the particular choices, what can block that from working? So I say a one reduction at a vertex, a node v that adds xy among the neighbors of v, is called admissible. If the graph you get. So g, sub v, subscript xy is saying the graph I get from g by applying a one reduction at v, adding the edge xy, that one reduction is admissible. If the graph you get is a circuit, it's non admissible if it's not. So when is one of these one reductions admissible or non admissible? That's this, Lana. So I take my circuit, I take a vertex of degree three with neighbors, say x, y, and z.
00:29:37.646 - 00:30:08.950, Speaker A: The one reduction at v adding xy is non admissible if and only if there exists a critical set x with x, y in x and v and z not. So. Remember, critical set means I of x is two x minus three. So if there, I mean I'll say the proof again in a second. But if there is such a set, then when you add x and y to it, then this goes up by one. And so you get a subgraph. That's bad, because it doesn't contain these things.
00:30:08.950 - 00:30:53.920, Speaker A: So one direction is kind of obvious, and the other direction isn't hard either. But let's just run through it anyway. So this is the easy direction. I say here, if such a critical set edge exists, then the edge xy adds one to my count for I of x, which, because v and z are not in it, in x, violates the definition of a circuit. Okay? Which would tell you the one reduction is non admissible. So that's proved one direction. Conversely, if we suppose the one reduction is non admissible, then that means there exists some set in the smaller graph we get, which violates the circuit condition.
00:30:53.920 - 00:31:34.914, Speaker A: So we know that we would have e equals two, v minus two. That's just a very simple count. So there must be some subset which has too many edges in it and lives in the vertex set of a smaller graph which is actually equal to the vertex, that of v minus v. Okay? So if we look in this smaller graph and the number of edges is at most what they are in the big graph plus one, because we only have one edge. So it follows from that that x must have been critical in the big graph, because in the big graph, it must satisfy that the sparsity conditions and it must fail them here. So it must go, and it can only go by one. So it must have been critical.
00:31:34.914 - 00:32:23.946, Speaker A: And the set that violates is not a subset of g. So the critical set in g must contain x and y. So the only thing we're left to show is that z is in it. And the point here is that we have this vertex b, and here's x and y and z. If z is in the critical set, then you add v and you add one to three edges, and you find a a bad thing for your critical set, like we did in the Lamar case. So if z is in x, then I of x plus v is I of x plus three. But we only added one vertex, so we end up with two x plus v minus two, which would give us a sub graph of g, which can't happen in a circuit, because, well, it just can't.
00:32:23.946 - 00:32:51.434, Speaker A: So you get a contradiction. Hence z is not in x. And so that's nice, because when we want to do a one reduction, since we know that the block looks like this and doesn't contain z, we can also then think, well, let's look at a second one reduction which might be blocked by yz, but not contain x. And so you have more freedom to do things. So this is a sort of luxury, I guess, that you have in this situation. You don't always have in other problems.
00:32:52.414 - 00:32:57.034, Speaker B: Okay, Tony, can we look at the statement of this lemma?
00:32:57.414 - 00:33:21.114, Speaker A: Yeah. So I want to do a one reduction in a circuit at a particular vertex, adding a particular edge among the neighbors. And that's no good. It does not preserve the circuit property if and only if you have this property.
00:33:22.974 - 00:33:32.558, Speaker C: So Tony, when you say no good, or sometimes you say this is bad or something like that, it means that we're not preserving the circuit property.
00:33:32.686 - 00:33:49.578, Speaker A: Yeah. So, I mean, the one reduction is non admissible, which means that I took a vertex in a circuit and I applied this one reduction, and what I get is not a circuit. Alex, have you seen the statement?
00:33:49.666 - 00:33:53.494, Speaker B: Long enough now, yeah, thanks.
00:33:53.874 - 00:34:34.096, Speaker A: Great. Okay, so we were talking there about one reductions, adding a particular edge, but as you know, there are three possible one reductions. You could add any of the three edges. So we can extend our definition of non admissible to talk about a node being non admissible rather than the particular one reduction. So a node v is nonadmissible if none of the three possible one reductions gives you a circuit. Okay? And we saw earlier on with those two examples, g and h, that nodes may be non admissible. So we need to understand what happens in that sort of situation.
00:34:34.096 - 00:35:20.024, Speaker A: So it may be that some node is nonadmissible. We need to look in the rest of the graph and use the structure that nonadmissibility gives us these critical sets to find some vertex that is admissible. And we're going to use free connectivity, need to use free connectivity at some point along the way. We know that from the non free connected counter example. Here's a helpful lemma. I take a circuit and I take a subset of the vertex set, which is a critical set such that there are at least two vertices in V that aren't in the critical set. So you sort of want to imagine that x is a critical set which blocks a one reduction at some vertex.
00:35:20.024 - 00:36:14.300, Speaker A: So obviously then the v and the z would not be in it. So you would have this at least two property. And the conclusion of the lemma is that outside of this circuit there are at least two nodes. So if you find a node you can't reduce as a critical set, but there's at least two of the vertices, and somewhere in that rest of the graph there's at least two nodes and you can try and do a one reduction there. So why is this true? Okay, so let's let x be a critical set, satisfying the hypotheses and define y to be the rest of the vertex set, v minus x. So x is a critical set, so it has at least two elements and hence the number of edges between x and y is at least four. So maybe that's not quite obvious, but it's an exercise I've left here.
00:36:14.300 - 00:37:06.084, Speaker A: So what's an exercise to verify this? One way to do it is to show that every free edge separation in a circuit has the property that one side is a single vertex. So it's clearly true. You can have a free edge separation because you can have vertices of degree free and there's a free edge separation. But if you have at least two vertices on the two sides, you can't just have free edges between them. That's those sort of separations are not possible. And so you can show this by looking at the two v minus two and at most two x minus three edges in subgraph conditions and just counting. Basically this is an exercise to verify, but the only thing we're going to use from it is that we have at least two vertices in x which we already knew, but between x and y there's at least four edges.
00:37:06.084 - 00:37:50.126, Speaker A: Okay, so given that we're then just going to count. Okay, so in Y, which, remember y is the vertices outside this special critical set x, we want to count the degrees of the vertices in Y. So it should be clear that what you want to do, the sum of the degrees is twice the number of edges. But we're looking at the degree in G and we're looking at a subset of a vertex set. So it's not just twice the edges induced by y, it's also the edges. So there's y here and there's x here. These edges count towards the degree of vertices and y at those ends, but they count once rather than the twice.
00:37:50.126 - 00:38:17.036, Speaker A: And edge within here it counts towards the degree once here and once here. So it's twice for the edges in y and once for the edges between x and y. Okay, so now we just do a sequence of equations. So the sum of the degrees of the vertices in y. We just said that I of y is what? So, sorry. So the dxy is just going to stay at the end all the way down for a while. So we look at two I of one.
00:38:17.036 - 00:38:58.314, Speaker A: So this is equal to twice I of y and I of y is the, the number of edges in the whole graph minus the number of edges induced by x minus the edges between x and y. Okay, but the edges in the whole graph are two v minus two. Because it's a circuit, x is critical. So I of x is two, x minus three, and the dxy stays. So now we can take two times two, v minus two minus two, x minus three minus d is this if you just work it out. And then 4 volts minus four, x is four, y minus four plus six is two. These two cancel, just give a minus one.
00:38:58.314 - 00:39:40.346, Speaker A: And we said dxy was at least four, so two minus at least four gives us at most four, y minus two. Okay, and so now we just have the degree thing again. So the sum of the degrees of the vertices in y is at most four, y minus two. So even if they were so, keeping them as low as possible, they can't all be fours. We must have something of degree less than four in there. So we get something of degree free. But because this is a minus two rather than a minus one, it follows at least two of them that are degree less than four, and they're both freeze because we can't have a degree two.
00:39:40.346 - 00:40:21.684, Speaker A: So since the degree is at least three, each three gives us a minus one in this compared to fours. So we get at least two nodes, which is what we concluded in the lemma. Okay, so we proved that one. All right, so now if we have a non admissible node v, then we know it's blocked for the one reduction at xy by a critical set x, and we can find some node outside of it. In fact, we can find two. But what we're going to do is have this picture and work on this node to find some sort of contradiction or find some sort of admissible node that we can reduce.
00:40:24.184 - 00:40:25.088, Speaker B: Tony?
00:40:25.256 - 00:40:25.964, Speaker A: Yes.
00:40:26.344 - 00:40:29.564, Speaker B: Will a series node always be admissible?
00:40:30.344 - 00:41:22.014, Speaker A: No, it won't. So I'm wondering if I can draw an example quick enough where it will work. So maybe this example I had here was this, this was true, wasn't it? No, they were leaf nodes, because this was, there was a free and a free. It won't be. It's, yeah, it's not true that they're always admissible. So I bet you can make some sort of, just minor edit to this kind of picture. You know, where I showed that branching nodes, if you just make one of these bigger, but still force the reduction to add this edge, then this one would stay at degree would still be, degree would drop.
00:41:22.014 - 00:41:36.064, Speaker A: But I can't without taking a couple of minutes. I don't know how to make an example, so I think it's no, but probably after the lecture, if you like, I could spend five minutes and come up with an example, but.
00:41:36.404 - 00:41:38.424, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, no problem. Thanks.
00:41:40.364 - 00:42:14.576, Speaker A: Yes. So I guess the answer is, unfortunately, it's not quite as simple as that. Okay, so what I want to do, we have these critical sets, but I really care about critical sets that actually block one reductions. I don't care about arbitrary critical sets. So I'm going to just refine the idea of a critical set a bit in two ways. So, first of all, let's take a node with neighbor set x y z node v. And if you have a critical set x which contains two neighbors but not the third and not the node, then the node is.
00:42:14.576 - 00:42:47.314, Speaker A: Sorry. Then the critical set is v critical for that particular node v. But it's always true that you can get sort of trivialities. So in fact, the trivialities is kind of what's happening here. So it's always true that G minus V is a critical set because it's a degree free vertex. But that's not really interesting or helpful. If you take any degree free vertex, the entire graph minus that one vertex or the entire vertex set will give you a critical set.
00:42:47.314 - 00:43:32.566, Speaker A: But what we're really going to care about is where the neighbors, at least one of the neighbor outside the critical set has sufficient degree. So we have this special neighbor that's not in the critical set. If that has degree free, then non admissibility is very definitely obvious. Before you worry about adding the edge xy, because if you want to add xy, then z will drop to degree two. So they're called trivial v critical sets. And the what sets we're really going to work on on node critical sets, which is a v critical set such that the degree of z is at least four. So I want to work on critical sets which are critical for some node.
00:43:32.566 - 00:43:48.890, Speaker A: I either contain two of the neighbours or the node, but not the third. And the third neighbor has degree, at least four. Okay, so, Tony, could you just draw.
00:43:48.922 - 00:43:54.894, Speaker C: The quick picture that goes with the v critical set? Is there a sc, is there some kind of schematic that.
00:43:56.154 - 00:44:33.924, Speaker A: Okay, so I have, this is my vertex v and its neighbors. So I have a critical set x is v critical if it looks like this. So it's a critical set which contains two of the neighbors and not the third. And so this set x is, as well as just being an arbitrary critical set, a set with two x minus three elements, it's critical for v because it stops us doing the one reduction at v that adds the edge xy. And then it's called node critical as well. If you just say that z is degree at least four.
00:44:36.944 - 00:44:53.544, Speaker C: Okay, that makes sense. Also, there's somehow a component outside like Z isn't all by itself. Is that. How do I say this?
00:44:55.404 - 00:45:22.096, Speaker A: Yes. So it is possible that what you see in this picture here is the entire graph. So what happened in this picture? So I'll draw it a slightly different way. So we had this example a few times. So suppose this is v and this is x, this is y, and this is z. Then the critical set containing x and y is this graph, and then z is degree free in. It's in the.
00:45:22.096 - 00:45:51.964, Speaker A: This is the trivial case. But over here I said that Z has degree at least four and x is critical. So if Z had three neighbors over here, then that would be over full because it doesn't contain v. So one of these three neighbors definitely lives over here. So yeah, there is something over here as well, as well as z. So that's kind of one of the points of the node critical thing. Because the trivial case, you can have things like this where there's nothing else.
00:45:51.964 - 00:45:57.524, Speaker A: But in the node critical case, there is definitely some vertex over here in the rest of the graph.
00:45:58.304 - 00:45:59.168, Speaker C: Okay, thanks.
00:45:59.256 - 00:46:00.056, Speaker A: That's perfect.
00:46:00.200 - 00:46:01.204, Speaker B: Hey, Tony.
00:46:01.504 - 00:46:02.168, Speaker A: Yeah?
00:46:02.296 - 00:46:14.584, Speaker B: I have sort of a dumb question. If I do a one reduction at v in this red picture, then, and I add the edge in the critical set x, that would make the resulting graph flexible.
00:46:18.484 - 00:46:57.474, Speaker A: No, not necessarily. So, for example, so what it's saying is that you have I of x is two, x minus three, and you add one edge to this. So you get a subset that violates the, the inequality you need for circuits. It may be that you get a nice rigid graph. For example, in the case where z is degree free, like here, you would get, you would get k four plus a degree two. So it would be a perfectly valid reduction for preserving rigidity, but it would not preserve the circuit property. And that's the property we're trying to preserve at this point.
00:46:57.854 - 00:46:59.514, Speaker B: Okay, thanks.
00:47:02.354 - 00:47:31.574, Speaker A: Okay, so. Oh, I'm about halfway through what I wanted to say in this lecture, but that's just good because it means I'm going slowly and hopefully people are understanding. So let's have this lemma. So we take a free connector. This is the first point we're going to use the free connectivity condition in one of our results. A free connected circuit on at least five vertices, the only circuit up to four vertices is k four. So at least five vertices is not really making any assumption.
00:47:31.574 - 00:48:13.938, Speaker A: Suppose that v is nonadmissible and it's a leaf node, so it's a node with degree at most one in the subgraph of nodes, so it's got at most one neighbor which is also degree free. Then there exists two v critical sets, x and y, which intersect in at least two vertices, and their union is the entire graph except for the vertex v that we're, that we're talking about. So that's the first part of the lemma. And then there's a. Moreover, if the vertex v is adjacent to a node z, so v is a non admissible leaf node. So if it's adjacent to a node z, that's the degree. Exactly.
00:48:13.938 - 00:49:17.544, Speaker A: One case, then these two critical sets, the v critical sets x and y, you can choose them to satisfy z is in the intersection. So we have this, this reduction, and let's say z is this one and x and y are here. If it's true that v is adjacent to z and z is a node, then as well as just existing to be critical sets, which you'd have the free possibilities for, like that, it's true that we can choose the x and y to be the two that intersect in z. Okay, so that's the lemma. I think given that it's ten two, I'll prove the lemma and then stop for questions and we'll just continue next time from that point. Okay, so let's say neighbors are via xyz as usual. So what we're doing, we have a non admissible leaf node and we're trying to show that there are two critical sets, x and y, with these two properties that the intersection at least two points and the union is v minus v.
00:49:17.544 - 00:49:48.200, Speaker A: So our vertex is non admissible. So we're blocked from adding xy, we're blocked from adding xz and we're blocked from adding yz. So that tells us there are three v critical sets. Let's say x contains y and z but not v and x. Y contains x and z, not v and y. Z contains x and y, not v and z. So I have these, these free blocking sets, x, y and z, and I'm going to show that the union of some pair of them is the x and y I want in there in the lemma.
00:49:48.200 - 00:50:27.680, Speaker A: So if any two of them intersect in at least two vertices, their union will be critical. And then when I add v, I'll get everything right. So suppose I have this set and this set this is v. If this is x and y and there's at least two vertices in here, then x union y will be critical. So x union y, union v will be equal to two x union y union v minus two. And hence it must be the entire circuit. So that that would be the intersection at least two I wanted, and I'd have that x union y equal b minus b.
00:50:27.680 - 00:51:05.842, Speaker A: So I'm going to suppose it doesn't happen if I get the intersection, I get that I've got everything. So suppose no two of these sets intersect in at least two vertices. Okay, so just to do the picture, maybe do the picture this way. What that says is I've got this graph where I've got my x, my y and my z, and the three critical sets are the free blobs. And it's exactly like that. Okay? So I want to just do some counting. So just relatively quickly, let m denote the number of edges induced by the union of these three critical sets.
00:51:05.842 - 00:51:42.334, Speaker A: So I think I have it as x, z and y like that in the picture. Picture, okay, so the number of edges in the union, it's a subgraph subset which doesn't include the vertex v. So it's at most twice the union minus three. But it's equal to the number of edges in x plus the edges in y plus the edges in z plus the ones in the union which don't belong to the three parts, which we defined as n. X is critical, so you get this. Y is critical, so you get this. And z is critical, so you get that they intersect.
00:51:42.334 - 00:52:06.714, Speaker A: Well, let's just put it together. X, y and z put them all together. There was three minus three. So two times minus three minus one minus three. So that's still fine. And then there were exactly these three vertices, x, y and z in common. So I get to this, but now I have that this is greater than or equal to this.
00:52:06.714 - 00:52:26.862, Speaker A: So it must actually be that greater than or equal to is an equality. And the m is zero. Okay, but that. But now I also have the number of edges from the vertex v to x union y. Union z is free. That's evident. X union y, union z includes x, y and z.
00:52:26.862 - 00:52:59.524, Speaker A: So you get all three of the edges. So when I add them in, I get the entire graph, as I was just saying before, in the same way. So if I add them in, I get a circuit, I get a subset with two, x minus two. And so it must be the, the entire thing. And hence x union y union z is v minus v. So I wanted a pair of these things to be all of v minus v. So far I've shown that all three of them are in this case where there's only single vertices in the intersections.
00:52:59.524 - 00:53:27.098, Speaker A: So now I want to use the free connectivity hypothesis to get a contradiction. So I know I have at least five vertices. So if you count up, there's x, there's y, the z, there's v, that's four. So there's at least one more vertex somewhere. So I can assume that one of these three blobs has a vertex in it. Say it's x. Then I've got, in x I've got y and z and that vertex.
00:53:27.098 - 00:54:23.430, Speaker A: So it has at least three elements, okay? But we know there were no edges induced by the union of x, y and z that weren't in the individual blobs. So what that says is that this pair of vertices, y and z, separates this vertex in x from anything over here or over here. In fact, yz is a two vertex separation in the graph which separates this vertex from the rest. So you contradict the hypothesis that you're free connected. Okay, so that's, that was what happened if all three of the intersections of these three critical sets had size one. So for some pair, and I've just called it x and y because I can just relabel if I like, you have, I do have at least two things in the intersection and hence the union is critical. And as we said before, that means that you add v and its free edges back.
00:54:23.430 - 00:54:49.114, Speaker A: You get, you must get the entire thing. So that's the first part of the dilemma. The second part, the moreover, was that we could assume that if z is a node, we could put z in the intersection of x and y. And I know in my x and y, z is actually there. But I could have relabeled to make this assumption. So I need to check that's actually true. Okay, so suppose z is a node.
00:54:49.114 - 00:55:16.508, Speaker A: So here's a special case. If xz and yz are both edges, then the picture looks like this. My two blobs, the blob that was including x and z is just this single edge, and the blob that was y and z is just this single edge. But now z is a node. So very definitely x. Y separates z from the vertices over here. Okay, we know the number of vertices was not four, it was at least five.
00:55:16.508 - 00:55:44.126, Speaker A: So there was something over here. Otherwise I'd have had this edge and being k four. Okay, so again, that would have been a contradiction of free connectivity. So I can assume one of these edges doesn't exist. Let's say it's the edge from y to z. So we know that this edge doesn't exist. Now we know that this is blocked by a critical set x, and it has at least three elements.
00:55:44.126 - 00:56:21.374, Speaker A: So x is at least three if you have a critical set on at least three elements. It's a laming graph. It's a two free type graph you get. So it's too connected. Hence the vertex z here has at least two neighbors in this in the subgraph x in the vertex x, if z has no neighbors in y. So remember, y could just be this edge, or it could be a bigger blob. So if z has no neighbors in y, then it would be true that this edge x z is not present.
00:56:21.374 - 00:56:52.780, Speaker A: Otherwise that would contradict having no neighbors. So that means that there's at least a vertex here, but it would also say that z has no neighbors in this bit. So z is an isolated vertex in the subgraph gy. But we just said the subgraph gy is two connected, so it can't have an isolated vertex. So that's a contrast. Hence Z has a neighbor over here, but z has degree free. And you can see I've got one, two, three, plus the edge to v four.
00:56:52.780 - 00:57:27.592, Speaker A: So one of these two vertices must actually be in this intersection with z. And so x intersect y is at least two. There's a second thing in there. And now again, x union y is critical, and x union Y equals v minus v, as we did before. Okay, so I should stop there. I was going to next get to the really key technical bit, but we'll delay that until next time because I've already run quite far over. Let me just slide this right to the end, because I just wanted to remind people that the next lecture is not for a while.
00:57:27.592 - 00:57:53.354, Speaker A: So I'm happy to hang around for questions, but just to remind you first, the next lecture is actually on the 5 March, because next week we have the rigidity workshop, and then the Monday to Wednesday of the following week we have the materials mini symposium. So it's. I think it's two weeks today. Friday the 5 March is the next lecture we'll have in this course. So thank you for bearing with me through some technical combinatorics.
