00:00:00.080 - 00:00:37.534, Speaker A: Okay, welcome, everybody. And yes, in this online world, we have to say good day to you, wherever you are, whatever time of day it might be, where you're logging in from. I hope you're all keeping well, keeping staying safe and healthy. Now, we've got a really interesting speaker and topic for today. It's about the spread of COVID the physics, the aerodynamics, rather, of the spread spread of COVID through droplets. Our speaker is Swetta Prabhup Chaudhary from the Institute for Aerospace Studies at U of T. Swetta Prabhup, please.
00:00:38.314 - 00:01:30.694, Speaker B: Thanks a lot, Professor Murthy, and thanks a lot for inviting me to this talk. It's an honor to be talking about the Phil's Institute Covid-19 math founding seminar. So, I am Shrattaprabha Chaudhary. I work at the Institute for Aerospace Studies, University of Toronto. And today we are going to discuss constructing a Covid-19 disease spread model from the flow physics of infectious droplets and aerosols. And Shaptoshi Poshu from indian science, Ank Shah from University of California, San Diego are the collaborators in this work. So what do we do? Where does our research focus lies normally? Now we look into the turbulent reacting and multiphase flows relevant to airspace, aerospace, propulsion.
00:01:30.694 - 00:02:13.487, Speaker B: So, as you know that there is different kind of aircraft engines as well as rocket engines. And in the heart of these engines is the combustor. Now, in the combustor, what is done is you inject the liquid fuel in in a large number of droplets. I mean, the droplet sizes can range from anywhere between one micron to 100 and 5200 micron. Okay? And these droplets evaporate, and then the mix with the air and they react and release heat. And then that heat, that heated high pressure air can be used for basically generating crust. Now, what happens is that there is strong turbulence, and this turbulence interacts with flames.
00:02:13.487 - 00:03:26.896, Speaker B: And we look into how basically flame interacts with turbulence, how fast they propagate under the impact of turbulence and things like flame extinction, flame stabilization, and all aspects of them. But what this is basically, this is essentially a multi scale problem that involves turbulent multiphase flows, chemical reactions. Why I'm talking about this because we can say that, as I'll show you next slide, that Covid-19 is also essentially a multi scale problem involving turbulent multiphase flows, exactly same gas, liquid and solid phases, as well as it involves chemical reactions or you can say biochemical reactions. And we will show that the kind of reaction mechanisms we use here can be directly applied in basically modeling the disease spread as well. So from here on, I will talk about Covid-19 disease spread. Now, we can say that the Covid-19 disease spread is essentially a multiscale, multidisciplinary problem. Why is it multi scale? It involves scales from the size of the bias, which is 120 nm in diameter, and it involves all the way.
00:03:26.896 - 00:04:08.714, Speaker B: It involves scales from 0.5 to one, 0.5 micron to 1 mm, which is the size of the respiratory droplet at the time of its ejection. It involves respiratory sprays, which contains airborne and ballistic droplets, which these ballistic droplets can go about at max, 2 meters. But the droplets that are rejected doesn't stop there, because these are airborne. These are very tiny droplets. And these droplets can basically spread along with the turbulence in the air, or they can just spread with the jet and the puff that is caused as a result of the cough or a sneeze, or even by talking or even by breathing.
00:04:08.714 - 00:04:41.506, Speaker B: And then they can spread. These infectious aerosols can disperse and spread in crowds and then people in healthy aerosols. And then that's why the Covid-19 is essentially an airborne disease. Now, before I go into this, why, what settles that? The fact that the Covid-19 is an airborne disease. Now, if you look into the time scales, the settling time for a 110 hundred micron droplet is about 10 seconds. Okay? Now the settling time actually increases because the droplet evaporates and it evaporates continuously. It basically loses the water.
00:04:41.506 - 00:05:39.102, Speaker B: And then it basically gets to form a droplet residue, which we call a droplet nuclei. I'll come to that. But the settling time for a one micron droplet can be of the order of 300 hours plus. Now the virus leaves for the half life of the virus, as has been proven from experiments in and of salt, can be anywhere between two minutes to 30 hours, depending on the local temperature, relative humidity you've indexed, and so on and so forth. Okay? And of course, 120 hours is the mean incubation period, that is about five days. So you can clearly see that this large variation in timescales, this fact that the droplets can remain airborne for a long lot of time, and then the fact that the virus leaves for comparable timescales, makes essentially Covid-19 an airborne disease. All right? And then, of course, at the very largest scales, you have the worldwide spread, which is this is the longest flight distance.
00:05:39.102 - 00:06:54.620, Speaker B: It can go from 16,000, 70,000 km. So it involves scales, length, scale, from all the way from 120 thousands of kilometers at the tv spread level. And it involves time scales of the order of, I mean, even smaller time scales can be there because the operation time scales are smaller all the way from few seconds to few months. Now then, the question that we ask is that can we construct a disease spread model? That is this, that is how the disease spreads, not only by restricting ourselves to this particular acir model, but can the AcIR model be built all the way involving these different phenomena that builds up to the disease rate? That is the question that we are going to ask, and we will see that how far a progress we can make. And of course, it's inherent here that the fact that Covid-19 is a multidisciplinary problem, and that the discipline actually changes kind of with the length scales. And this is governed by biology, virology, immunology. This is governed by droplet physics, evaporation, which is controlled by thermodynamics, species transfer chemistry.
00:06:54.620 - 00:07:46.334, Speaker B: This is governed by fluid mechanics. This is governed by aerosol physics. And this is governed by epidemiology. So it involves multiple disciplines, as it involves different kind of scales, length and time scales. So the question is the following are the following. We have two specific questions in mind that can we identify and quantify the relative importance of the different dominant transmission routes of the sars cov two bias? What contributes most to the dominant routes? Droplet droplet nuclei. And if we can identify the different routes, can we construct a disease break model from the mechanics of these different routes that we have identified? So, to that end, we start with the following thought experiment.
00:07:46.334 - 00:08:29.914, Speaker B: So, suppose we have a large indoor area. The area, the indoor space is kind of air conditioned at typical temperatures, typically humidity. And we have a crowd. And each people in this crowd are moving in random directions and are basically moving randomly. Now, one person in this crowd basically coughs. And as that person coughs, that person ejects a plethora of droplets of different sizes. And those droplets are injected in a gas cloud, okay? And this gas cloud basically is injected in the form of a jet.
00:08:29.914 - 00:09:14.468, Speaker B: The jet transitions to a puff, because at some point of time, the momentum source is cut off, and then the puff disperses in this crowd. So this is the basic framework that we are going to look at. And this is the problem. This is the schematic of the problem that we formulate. So this is the infected person, this red circle, and this infected person is this prey of infectious droplets of different sizes. These droplets are denoted by red. And after some point of time, the droplets evaporate.
00:09:14.468 - 00:10:11.108, Speaker B: And as they evaporate, they do not vanish. They leave behind a droplet residue, which is basically a combination of solid, or a semi solid matter, which can contain salt proteins, mucin, surfactants and the virus. And those droplet residues are denoted by blue. And these basically cloud spreads. And then we have this green susceptible individuals who are moving basically in different directions. And then if they cross this cloud, then they can inhale these droplets or the droplet residues, the aerosol particles, essentially, and they can basically get infected. And further step is that this susceptible individuals, upon inhalation of this infected aerosols, becomes exposed, and this exposed, after the incubation period, becomes infected.
00:10:11.108 - 00:11:04.474, Speaker B: And then they can recover or they can get deceased. So this is the basic framework that we are going to look at. So the objectives are the following. That first we need to estimate that if this susceptible individual crosses this droplet or aerosol cloud, what is the probability of infection? Okay, what is the probability of infection by droplets of the droplet nuclei, that is a droplet residue. And once we can identify the probability of infection, then can we estimate the infection rate constants and the corresponding basic reproduction number that can be used in a acid model. Now, the probability of infection and the rate constants are not same things. The probability of infection goes into this red constants that we will show.
00:11:04.474 - 00:12:00.938, Speaker B: So, of course, it would be very nice if there was a very clean set of governing equations that we could have solved to basically solve this entire problem. But unfortunately, due to this large, disparate, due to the very large range of scales, and due to the involvement of these different disciplines, it's almost impossible to construct such a thing. If you are to do the entire simulation from the virus to the, to the disease spread, you need to basically solve in a grid, which is at the smallest scales can be of the order of few microns, and at the largest scale can be of the tens of thousands of kilometers. So that is not possible. So the approach we adopt is the following. That is, we start with the cough droplet size distribution, which was experimentally measured in from literature. We get it from literature, and then we feed into, feed that thing into a respiratory droplet aerosol model.
00:12:00.938 - 00:12:57.872, Speaker B: Now, what this does is it solves the governing equations, mass momentum energy species for droplets of different sizes. And it gives us the evaporation time, it gives us the settling time. Now, of course, it is to be recognized that the droplets do not, do not get ejected individually or isolated. They, a large number of droplets are ejected, but they are ejected in a gas cloud, as Borobio's work has shown. Okay? And so it is, this respiratory droplet model cannot be done, cannot be solved in isolation. It needs to be coupled with the corresponding checkpath aerodynamics model. Okay? And this, of course, we need to include the information of the virus because whether the droplets will or the aerosols will be infected or not depends on the virus half life.
00:12:57.872 - 00:14:11.528, Speaker B: So we need to provide those inputs. Also we need to provide the inputs of the virus lifetime. Extremely important is the viral load, that is, the number of vital particles per unit, volume of the liquid that is being ejected. And we also include, need to include those response model that will essentially determine, and all this coupled will determine the probability of infection. Okay. Now then, the probability of infection needs to be coupled once again with the jet of aerodynamics model because this now once you get the probability of infection, you need to basically need to find out, that is how many, what is the frequency of this infected cloud will, what is the frequency of collision of these susceptible individuals with this infected cloud or this with this infectious cloud? Okay? So that is a very important thing. So once we know the frequency of collisions or frequency of contact between the susceptible individuals with the infectious cloud, we can combine with the probability of infection and that can yield the red constants and the local basic reproduction number from this collision theory.
00:14:11.528 - 00:15:09.644, Speaker B: Okay? And then we are all set to use these things into the ACI model. So this is the approach that we are going to follow. Now, what I will do in the following is the following is what I'll do is the following that I'll just. These individual models, jet power dynamics respecting droplet model and the virus half life, etcetera. Please feel free to look into the papers for detailed description of this, but I'll more focus on the how to derive the probability of infection and how to derive the red constants and collision theory. So, but first I will discuss these, these models quickly and then focus on these in a more at a greater details. So first, this whole exercise will focus on estimating the probability of infection by droplets and droplet nuclei.
00:15:09.644 - 00:16:10.630, Speaker B: Now, it is to be recognized that the conventions that we adopt that at the moment of ejection, everything is in a form of droplets, okay? These droplets contain water, these droplets contain salt, this droplet can contain protein, this can contain surfactants and of course, the virus. And at the moment of the rejection, they can range anywhere between 0.5 microns to 750 micron initial diameter. Now, but the medical community and the following has now has a cutoff about 100 micron. And the aerosol community, of course, has put a cut off about 100 micron. And they say that below 100 micron we call them as aerosols, and below, beyond 100 micron, we call them as droplets. But for this purpose of the talk, we will basically, we use the convention that whatever contains liquid predominantly and can be defined by a surface free surface is essentially droplet.
00:16:10.630 - 00:17:06.444, Speaker B: That's the physics definition. And of course, these droplets, if it is 0.5 to 750 micron initial diameter, they can be both airborne or ballistic. The small droplets are of course, airborne, as I have shown before, that 100 micron droplet has a settling time of 10 seconds. So all the way from basically 100 micron. And smaller droplets are basically airborne for substantial amount of time, whereas one that are above 100 micron and even larger ones can have sufficient momentum and they can behave as a, like, they can have a ballistic trajectory, which are more dominated by their momentum and the gravity. And so we model the respiratory droplets as a 1% salt water solution, 1% nacl water solution.
00:17:06.444 - 00:17:58.470, Speaker B: All right. And of course, the real respiratory droplet contains more components, but we, for the time being, we use this as the, as the constituents and we will show that this model, this surrogate model that we use works reasonably well when we compare the model outputs with the real saliva experiments. So this two component model basically works well. And then the convention is that the droplet nuclei are those solid and the semi solid residue that are left post droplet evaporation. And we'll show them. The size of this droplet nuclei is typically one fifth to one 6th of the initial droplet diameter. If the relative humidity is beyond about 80%.
00:17:58.470 - 00:19:07.794, Speaker B: If the relative humidity is very large, about, say 90%, 100%, then the droplet does not evaporate at all. And, and they continue with their initial size. So, in this whole discussion, temperature, relative humidity are very, very important factors. And we need to basically, and that emphasizes the importance of having a very robust droplet evaporation and settling model, because depending on the temperature and the relative humidity, the evaporation time and the settling time of the droplets will be governed by temperature, relative humidity. And not only that, the final equilibrium diameter of this solid, of the semi solid residue will depend on the relative humidity. So it is very important to have a robust droplet evaporation settling model to be included in this approach that we are doing. Okay.
00:19:07.794 - 00:19:43.372, Speaker B: So we say that this is, this is known, as I have said before, from the Walker Borobia, that droplets are ejected in a turbulent jet, that transitions to a puff. Okay. Initially, you have a lot of momentum through which the, which sustains the jet. But after the cough stops, the source of the momentum is cut off. And as a result of that, the jet transitions to a puff. And then this puff expands. And of course, this whole puff expands and the jet also increases in diameter because as the jet moves, it continually entrains air.
00:19:43.372 - 00:20:27.176, Speaker B: Okay. And this continual entrainment of air actually dilutes the concentration of the droplets and the aerosols that is present within the jet and the cloud or the path. So this is very, very important, this continuous entrainment of air that happens and that reduces the concentration of the results within the cloud. In this work, we do not consider effects of turbulence and or ventilation. They are actually coupled. And, but we are in the, in our, in present work, we are actually including these effects also. And then the, we say that the infection occurs when a certain number of variants are inhaled upon collision of susceptible individuals with the droplet of the droplet nuclei.
00:20:27.176 - 00:20:58.524, Speaker B: Cloud. Okay. So as soon as a person comes in contact with the cloud, okay, the cloud is expanding, people are moving, and they can inhale the drop, inhale a certain number of droplets or videos, and when they inhale certain number of videos, then there is a certain probability of infection. And that this comes from the dose response model that we will use. So first, is this the top part of my slide visible?
00:20:58.904 - 00:21:00.072, Speaker A: Yes, we can see it.
00:21:00.208 - 00:21:23.780, Speaker B: Okay, great. Okay, so this is the droplet evaporation and the desiccation model that we're talking about. Okay, so what's the droplet evaporation model? This is fairly detailed. So we work with this surrogate cough droplet. That is one person, sodium chloride light of droplet, which is evolving in the xl layer. Now, please remember that these droplets do not evolve isolatedly. They evolve in the axel layer.
00:21:23.780 - 00:21:52.402, Speaker B: So their surroundings is governed by the output of the jetpuff model that I'll show how the coupling occurs. So, of course, this is the mass flow rate or the, of the water. That is the rate at which the water leaves the droplet surface due to evaporation. And that is given by this formula. I'll go over this quickly. I'll not go into the details. This is the density of the vapor, this is the diffusivity, this is the droplet size, and this is the mass transfer number.
00:21:52.402 - 00:22:24.350, Speaker B: The mass transfer number is essentially the difference of the mass fraction of water on the droplet surface and the mass fraction of water or water vapor on the gas. Okay. And this is one minus l one s y one s. That is the mass fraction of the water vapor on the droplet surface. Okay? And this mass fraction of water, if it was just pure water, then things would have been simple. But now this droplet contains. Droplet also contains salt.
00:22:24.350 - 00:23:14.048, Speaker B: Now, as the water content in the droplet is reducing, the salt concentration is increasing. And now we have to basically take into account the paper vapor pressure on the surface. So this mass fraction on the water of water on the surface is controlled by the vapor pressure of pressure of the liquid on the surface. And that is controlled by the local temperature. And the mass fraction of water, the mass fraction of water itself is, can be defined as one minus the mass fraction of the salt. And this basically comes from the raoult's law. That is, that is, the vapor pressure is basically determined now by Raul's law, because your concentration of salt is increasing in the droplet, and that because of the increasing concentration of the salt inside the droplet, that actually suppresses evaporation because it reduces the vapor pressure.
00:23:14.048 - 00:23:32.784, Speaker B: Okay? And this is the vapor pressure. This is the mass fraction of water in the far field. Uh, that is in the, in the gas. It's just in the near field gas. I'm sorry. This is the mass fraction of water on the near field gas. And this is once again controlled by the relative humidity of the excellent air.
00:23:32.784 - 00:24:08.566, Speaker B: Okay? And then we can do a simple scaling by which we can couple the temperature of the gas and the mass fraction of the gas with the momentum of the gas, because we can say that the random number and the number, basically the, which, basically the ratios of the corresponding diffusivities and the viscosities, and those are close to one. And as a result of that, this can be. And this is verified experimentally. Also. Now we need to still know the temperature of the water on the droplet surface. And that we can obtain by solving the energy equation for the droplet temperature. And we assume that the droplet temperature is homogeneous throughout the droplet volume.
00:24:08.566 - 00:24:31.974, Speaker B: And that's a very good assumption. Okay, so this is the equation that we need to solve. And this is the temperature. Okay. The raoult's law is this mass fraction of water on the surface, which is also a function of the mass fraction of salt on the surface. And from that, we can get the mass fraction of water on the surface. We get the mass fraction of water, of water in the near field gas.
00:24:31.974 - 00:25:17.954, Speaker B: And we can put this in and we can find the evaporation rate of water from the droplet. Now, the mass fraction of the salt, which is the mass fraction of the water, is basically one minus mass fraction of the salt. For that, we need to basically solve the a species balance equation. And now we say that after a certain threshold, the salt essentially crystallizes. And this is basically the one step crystallization chemistry that we include. So all this yields basically the mass loss of the mass flow rate of water from the droplet surface. And that is basically needed to obtain the droplet evaporation time and the drying curve of the droplet.
00:25:17.954 - 00:25:40.994, Speaker B: And then the droplet motion, we can basically solve using the momentum balance. This is essentially Newton's law. Balance of. This is the ma term, the rate of change of momentum. And this is basically the drag force that acts on that. Okay, this is in the x direction. And using the Stokes settling velocity, we can find out the time for settling of the droplet.
00:25:40.994 - 00:26:01.890, Speaker B: I'll not go into these in details, as I said previously, and just show how this works. Just give a glimpse. The respiratory jetpuff model. Once again, initially, the exiled air is. Is a jet. And that we can. That we can show that using, once again, mass balance, momentum balance.
00:26:01.890 - 00:26:39.214, Speaker B: We can show that initially, the diameter of the jet initially scales as t to the power of half. And once the momentum source is cut off, the jet transitions to a path. And then the diameter of the jet, the diameter of the puff, evolves as t to the power of one fourth. So by combining these two to the power of half and one four, we get the diameter of the jet, the position of the center of centroid, of the jet, of the puff, and the position and the velocity. And this is required. This is coupled to the droplet evaporation model. So this is the validation of the droplet evaporation model.
00:26:39.214 - 00:27:23.848, Speaker B: Now, we do experiments in a contact free levitated setup. So we basically levitate this respiratory, this actual saliva droplet in this acoustic levitator at a given condition. And then we measured the, basically the drying curve, the normalized droplet diameter as a function of time. So this is the experimental result for a real saliva, human saliva droplet of initial diameter, 550 micron. And this is the model prediction. This does not involve any inject puff. And we see that after a certain time, a plateau is hit, because now what happens here is that the mass fraction of water has reduced because the salt mass fraction has increased very much, which suppresses the evaporation.
00:27:23.848 - 00:27:53.018, Speaker B: So this plateau continues. And then after some time, the mass fraction of salt has gone up so much that it has crossed certain threshold. And then the salt kind of crystallizes out. Okay. And as a result of that, now evaporation can again proceed and the droplet can get almost right and certain related humidity, the droplet will not be dried. Okay. So this basically validates our, our choice of the sodium chloride water droplet evaporation.
00:27:53.018 - 00:28:43.780, Speaker B: Of course, there is certain difference, about 15%, but we live with that for this work. This is a very important plot. So once our droplet model is obtained, we can find out the drop, the evaporation times as a function of the initial droplet diameter. So this is the evaporation, this is the initial droplet diameter, and this is the evaporation curve. It continuously increases, whereas the settling time, as found from the stoke, settling velocity, which is, which is a function of the instantaneous diameter, continuously reduces. So this increases, evaporation time increases and this continuously reduces. Okay, now there is a jump in slope because at the very large diameters, the droplet settles in its droplet state itself.
00:28:43.780 - 00:29:44.466, Speaker B: But beyond certain, beyond, after the most of the droplet has evaporated. Now it is basically the droplet, the dried droplet nuclei and the size of the dried droplet nuclei and its state are different from that of the droplet. So that's why we get a difference in the slope here. Okay. So what we can, what we get out from this is that at any instant of time, at any instant of time, t we can know that what is the fraction of my initial droplet distribution has become a droplet nuclei, because anything above this curve, this blue curve is, has become a droplet nuclei. And anything below this blue curve is, still remains as a droplet. So we can know at a particular amount, at a particular time that what fraction, the initial droplet distribution that was ejected has become droplet nuclei.
00:29:44.466 - 00:30:08.894, Speaker B: It's essentially this part all the way from 0.5 micron. So if you look at this, this time, there is seven, 7th, 2nd. So here, all the way from 0.5 micron to about 25 microns has become droplet nuclei, whereas from about 25 micron to 150 microns still remains as droplet because large droplets need more time to evaporate. Okay. And what fraction has settled.
00:30:08.894 - 00:30:59.004, Speaker B: So this becomes very important in telling us at any particular instant of time, what is the state of the cloud? What is the state of the cloud, of the cough cloud that was ejected. Okay. That we can say from this curve itself that, that this is the state of the cloud. Okay. So, and also important to note here is that the virus half life is somewhere here about, in the 900 seconds, okay, about 950 seconds. At this time, at this temperature. So this clearly tells us that the large fraction of the nuclei have, basically has, which are airborne, has remained infectious.
00:30:59.004 - 00:31:42.002, Speaker B: So now we go into calculate the probability of the infection, and we start with the PDF of the probability density function of the injected droplet diameter. So this is the, we can approximate the initial droplet size distribution using a log normal distribution. So this is the log normal distribution. We use results from toots paper. Okay. And the cumulative number of virions in droplets between sizes d one and d two is given by this formula. So the total number of virions, or bias particles between sizes d one and d two is a function of this PDF.
00:31:42.002 - 00:32:02.754, Speaker B: Okay. It depends on the total number of particles or the top list being ejected. It depends on the viral load. This is a very important parameter. Average viral load can be 7 million copies per milliliter and the maximum viral load can be 2.35 billion copies per milliliter. So this is the cumulative number of videos between sizes d one and d two.
00:32:02.754 - 00:32:57.224, Speaker B: The number of video particles that can be inhaled by the droplet route can be, is a function of basically the, once again, all these things, total number of virus particles, vital load. It's a function of the size of the inhalation volume or the, which we convert into basically hemisphere. And this is the effective diameter of the hemisphere, the size of the cloud, the number of breaths per unit time, the relative velocity with which the people are crossing the cloud. Okay. And the sigma d, once again is the diameter of the cloud route. And so, and this is to get infected by the droplet route, we have to basically find the droplets. And these droplets are between, at this particular time can be between d one and d two, whereas d one and d two are basically these two limits.
00:32:57.224 - 00:33:55.884, Speaker B: So, because at any particular time, only between d one and d two, you will find droplets. So likewise, we also calculate the number of virion particles that are inhaled by the droplet nuclei. Doubt. And the nuclear out can be anywhere between zero to this tn, whereas this dn is basically given by this limit if the time we are considering is less than the droplet, maximum evaporation time, or by this limit if the time you are considering is settling time. Okay, so anything here is basically droplet nuclei. Anything here is droplet. And this equation, basically, these two equations basically find out, first the number of videos available from the droplet drought, and then compute the number of videos that can be inhaled if we just inhale a certain amount of volume from this large droplet cloud or this large droplet nuclear cloud.
00:33:55.884 - 00:34:52.654, Speaker B: Okay, so this is, this is the formula that we use that we developed for basically calculating number of virus particles in help of the droplet nuclei of the droplet, or the droplet of the droplet nuclear. Now, one important parameter is this factor. This, that is, this gives the number of the fraction of infectious, infectious virions that are available. And this is a function of temperature, ambient temperature. This is a function of time, temperature, relative humidity, uv index, and it can be modeled using this half to the power of t by the half life of the virus. And we can get this number, this t half from this, this website, which is essentially based on this very, very important paper where this infectivity rate constants are provided. So they made basically aerosol experience.
00:34:52.654 - 00:35:58.198, Speaker B: And why does the virus survive inside the nuclei? Now, this we learn from very the seminal works by Mar, Lindsay Marr's group. Basically, the virus gets distributed, gets entrapped inside the nuclei, inside the droplet nuclei, and they get kind of frozen, okay? And as a result of this, whereas if the, if the, if the, if the, if the droplet remains as is, that is almost in its droplet state, then also, then the virus can remain infectious, okay? So as a result of this, this half life has a kind of a u shaped curve as a function of relative humidity. And this information is basically included in the model that we have just shown. We also did experiments with the salt crystals, and we see that the distribution is essentially similar. So most of the virus gets entrapped inside this droplet nuclei. But once they're entrapped, they're entrapped does not mean that they become non infectious. Once they're entrapped, it means that they're kind of frozen.
00:35:58.198 - 00:37:10.398, Speaker B: And once they come out and interact with human cells, lung cells, etcetera, they can still regain their potency. This was proved by this very important paper by Ludinki, where they basically isolated this aerosol particles at a reasonably large distance from 2 meters and 8 meters, and then they could culture these virus particles. So now, once this number of virus particles that are inhaled by the different routes are settled by this, as I've said, by this formulas that we have developed, once they are done, we can basically estimate the probability of infection, okay? And that is given by this formula, it's essentially a Moissa distribution. So the probability of infection by the expiratory event alpha and the vector beta, that is expiratory event can be cough sing, sneeze, talk, etcetera. The beta can be droplet, droplet, nippling or might, and that is given by this formula. This is essentially the dose response model that was developed by Haas. And then we can find out the total probability of infection.
00:37:10.398 - 00:37:46.214, Speaker B: We sum over the different vectors, the contribution of the virus particles inhaled by the different vectors, and that is what we have done. Okay, now the mid, the minimum infectious dose for SARS Cov two is unknown. So what we do is essentially we do a variation of these parameters to see what is the, what kind of response we get. I'll come to that later. So these are the results. So this is the initial droplet size distribution that is ejected from a cough, okay. And this is the number of virus particles at those sizes.
00:37:46.214 - 00:38:14.754, Speaker B: So this is the initial size and this is the PDF, okay. And this is done at this particular conditions. Ambient temperature 21 degree celsius, relative humidity 50%. And this is the exit state of the gas that is being exhaled. And we can clearly see that this is the histogram of this droplet size. Of this droplet sizes. This is the initial size and it shifts to the left because of droplet evaporation.
00:38:14.754 - 00:38:58.490, Speaker B: And it also shifts to the left because the droplets settle out. So within, at time t equal to zero. This initial, this mode for this histogram was about, at 13 microns, but within about a few seconds, within about tens of seconds, it shifts to about eleven, it shifts about 2.5 microns. So we can see that this, there's a very fast, very, this reduction of the droplet size is an important phenomenon that is happening here. Okay, now we can estimate then the probability of the infection. The red curves corresponds to the probability of infection for the droplet route, red, the blue is for the nuclear route.
00:38:58.490 - 00:39:40.596, Speaker B: And here we plot the probability of infection as a function of time. And here we plot the same thing, probability of infection for the, for the cough event, for the different trans, for the different vectors as a function of distance. And clearly the probability of infection reduces as we go, as the, as we go in, as we move in time or in distance. And this is because the, the droplets are evaporating and more importantly, the droplet cloud or the jet is diluting because it is entering air. Okay. This dilution is a very important effect. So this, and after some time, the, the droplets essentially evaporate and they vanish.
00:39:40.596 - 00:40:18.010, Speaker B: But of course they do not, they do not go away. They leave behind this droplet nuclei. Okay, so this droplet nuclei, now the probability of infection by the droplet nuclei picks up and we now see that they continue. But clearly the probability of infection by the droplet nuclei is always smaller than that of the, of inhaling the droplets. And that is because by the time the droplet nuclei developed, the puff has developed, the puff has diluted to a reasonable extent. The size of the puff is very large. So the concentration of the nuclei inside the puff is small.
00:40:18.010 - 00:41:08.556, Speaker B: So that is why the probability of infection is less if one crosses a droplet cloud versus a droplet nuclear. But we will see that, that this does not mean the droplet nuclei contributes less. Okay, so this is an important distinction. So next we plot the different, the probability for the different droplets with including different cutoffs. So here we provide cutoffs. That is, if we can prevent the ejection of droplets beyond these particular sizes, okay, beyond ten, beyond 150 and ten, how will the probability look like? So we see, we find that if we cut off at 100 micron, nothing changes much. But if we can cut off the droplets beyond ten micron, then the probability reduces very sharply.
00:41:08.556 - 00:42:09.568, Speaker B: So from this we can conclude that, uh, that the probability that the droplets with the initial size between ten to 50 micron contributes most to this probability of getting infected. Okay, we can see that the probability of if the cutoff at 50 micron also is very large. Okay, so now can we estimate the, uh, the rate constants and the ace from ACI to model? So we can write the AciR model as the following, that in the form of a chemical reaction mechanism, we can say that s plus I becomes e plus I, that is susceptible plus infected. When they come in contact and they inhale, those rerons becomes exposed plus infected. And that corresponding rate constant is given by this k one alpha beta. Now, what is k one alpha beta? The k one alpha beta can be, is dependent on both the respiratory event as well as the corresponding transmission vector. So we can break up this k one alpha beta into all these different things.
00:42:09.568 - 00:42:49.590, Speaker B: Breath, coughing, stop and droplet droplet in. And these are all the different rate constants, okay? And then of course, this is standard. The exposed becomes infected, the infected becomes either recovered or diseased. And these are the different fractions. So we can basically solve this whole thing, okay, this involves several equations like as in, as in we do in chemical reaction mechanisms. And we can solve this whole thing as a form of this, in this differential equation that immediately comes from the previous reaction mechanism. And we can obtain this, this can form over from the whole disease rate module.
00:42:49.590 - 00:43:47.972, Speaker B: But then the question is that how to estimate k one? Now we can estimate k one using the, by adopting the molecular collision theory. Now suppose in the unit volume we have ni and ns number of infected and susceptible individuals. Okay? So in a unit volume. So then, then a collision will occur in unit time if this susceptible individuals would lie within a volume which is given by PI times sigma ds squared. Sigma ds square is sigma t is the drop is a puff diameter and sigma sigma s is the diameter of the inhalation volume. And this is sigma ds is essentially the sum of these two things, okay? So if we, this is the sigma ds squared and this is the relative velocity, the vds. So the collision will occur if susceptible individuals basically lies in this collision volume.
00:43:47.972 - 00:44:49.100, Speaker B: The collision volume is essentially the volume swept by the cloud in unit time. Okay? Now since we know the number density of this infected and susceptible individuals, essentially the susceptible individuals, so we can find out the total number of collisions just by finding out the total number of susceptible individuals that will lie in this collision volume. And this is given by this, okay, but all collisions or all contacts will not result in infection. So that is why it is multiplied with this probability of infection. Okay, so then the total number of infections per unit volume per unit time is given by I times sigma ds squared times the relative velocity times the probability of infection for the explanatory event alpha and transmission vector beta times the number of infected individuals, number of socio. Okay, so then we can generalize the rate constant by basically averaging over over the time that is instantaneous. So this is basically the average of that.
00:44:49.100 - 00:45:17.080, Speaker B: And we can find out the corresponding rate constant. For the droplet. This is the k one, alpha d, gamma, gamma. We can include a location parameter also. And for droplets, we only need to integrate between zero to tau d, whereas tau d is the evaporation time, the max evaporation time, whereas we can find out the rate constant for the nuclei. Nuclei can persist almost for an indefinite amount of time. And basically we need to integrate from zero to infinity.
00:45:17.080 - 00:46:11.434, Speaker B: But for practical cases, because the p probability goes to almost zero, we need to integrate only up to a point where the integral converges. Okay, so this is the rate constant from the droplet route and this is the rate constants that we get from the nuclear route, okay? And with the total rate constant is just the sum of the these different parallel rate parallel routes. And so we just need to sum over this. Now here is the result. That is, if we consider this ambient temperature at 21 degrees Celsius, 50% relative humidity, and we do all the calculations based on the formulations that we have shown, the rate constant by the droplet that we see is this one 0.018 the rate constant by the nuclei is almost 15 times larger. And we can find out, based on the, based on this red constant, we can find out the basic production number also in this state.
00:46:11.434 - 00:46:49.636, Speaker B: And this is this one. Now remember, the probability of the droplet, of getting infected by the droplet was much higher than that of the corresponding nuclei. Okay, now, but the rate constant contribution by the nuclei is much, much higher than that of the droplets. And that is because of two things. That is because, number one, the size of the cloud which contains the droplet nuclei is much larger. And but more importantly here, we are integrating over a large amount of time. So the chance of getting, or the contribution by the nuclei is much larger because of the persistence of the nuclei, whereas the droplets only persists for a small amount of time.
00:46:49.636 - 00:47:44.226, Speaker B: Audi is much, much smaller than this by the time for which the nuclei persists. And as a result of this, we can clearly see from here that it is essentially this droplet nuclei, which is essentially aerosol particles, that contributes overwhelmingly over these droplets, even though the contribution to the probability by this is large. Okay? And we can clearly see, as we reduce the temperature because of the longer survivability of both the droplets and the droplet nuclei, these numbers go up and the r naught basically also increases. So this can include the effect of temperature also. And the effect of temperature is very much important because the wider survivability is a strong function of temperature. And of course, it's a function of relative humidity and index also. Okay, so this is just the some simulations you can just do with the AC IR model, and it shows that it just works perfectly well, as a standard ACI model would do.
00:47:44.226 - 00:49:18.516, Speaker B: And then we can also estimate the, the basic reproduction number by this ratio of this different rate constants. And then we can find out the rate constant, the basic reproduction numbers, if we cut off the droplets at different sizes, that is, if we can prevent ejection of droplets at certain sizes, what would be the basic reproduction number and how does it vary with the different vital load? Okay, so we can clearly see that for the viral load, this, the average vital load is somewhere here, and whereas, whereas with the largest viral load, it can really go off the charts. And how does this reflect now, of course, with the, if we plot the minimum infectious dose, that is, for a 90% chance of infection probability, and on the x axis and the basic reproduction number on the y axis, for the average vital load, we get discovered, okay, but for the max viral load, we essentially get this curve. And of course, this basic reproduction number is of course, must have a distribution, because the viral load also has a popular, has a distribution among the entire population. And we can clearly see that this can follow some population, something like a PDF, something like this. So here I plot the PDF, essentially, okay? And the mid can vary. The minimum infectious dose can vary due to several reasons, due to reduced immunity, due to introduction of new variants and all these sorts of things, okay? And we can generate this curve basically for any temperature, any relative humidity, any condition.
00:49:18.516 - 00:50:26.638, Speaker B: Okay? So that is what we are trying to do here. That is for at any condition, can we generate the basic production number? Of course, it includes several other things like population density, etcetera. So now we are almost coming close to this talk, close to the end of this talk, and we can summarize. So what we have done is we have modeled droplet settling, evaporation and desiccation in a cuff jet to calculate the infection probability, all right? And then we have combined it with the collision frequency between the droplet cloud and the susceptible individuals, and combine that with this probability of infection to estimate the basic or not the corresponding r naught. And from that, from this collision theory, we developed this acid model, okay? And this can be generalized to any expiratory event. All we need is basically the input in terms of the droplet size distribution, input droplet size distribution. So, and that is available.
00:50:26.638 - 00:51:04.084, Speaker B: We can use the input droplet size distribution for cough, sing, sneeze, talk, breathe, anything. Okay? So for any of this expiratory event we can form, we can find out the probability and the basic reproduction. But for this present case, we have done it for cough. And we find that this droplets with ten to 550 micron have the highest infection probability. But by the time they infect, okay, they could be one 6th of their initial size. So it's essentially they could be infecting it one six to one fifth of this, these numbers. So by the time they infect, they could be about anywhere between two micron to ten micron.
00:51:04.084 - 00:52:04.538, Speaker B: And the probability by the droplets is very high near the source. The probability of getting infected, if you cause the droplet cloud, is very high near the source, but decay soon after. Now, the aerosolized droplet nuclei, despite the low instantaneous probability of infection that dominates in contributing to the r naught c. And that is because of the large lifetime of the virus and the fact that the virus can remain potent inside the double nuclei, and that the size of the cloud, the number of people that the cloud can infect, is much large. Okay? And the fact that these aerosols can persist in this, in the air for a long, long time. And we can show that the preventing injection of all droplets beyond five micron could yield an unknown c about one. But this is only for the cough droplet size distribution that we have done.
00:52:04.538 - 00:52:32.274, Speaker B: And we have also assumed that the wire load is uniform across all droplet sizes. So what is the next. What can we do next? We can of course add, make this individual models or the sub models much more rigorous. We can validate them further with experiments. Okay. We can add new modules in the form of ventilation, which we have not considered. But more importantly, this is SEIIt model is developed on one particular location.
00:52:32.274 - 00:53:09.774, Speaker B: We can, given the certain inputs, okay, that can be available from different databases. We can basically obtain the r naught c for specific conditions, different indoor conditions. And from that we can either generate a distribution or we can plug this into a network model, okay. Or a mobility network model. And we can basically use this towards practical, practical disease model. So these are the next things that we have in mind and acknowledgements, civil people. Definitely.
00:53:09.774 - 00:53:40.780, Speaker B: To Professor Lindsay Marr, I mean, her works and her discussions advice has had profound impact on what we have done. Professor Balachander from Florida, Professor Kasi battler from Duke. Ever had bonus cards from Max Planck, Professor Menon from Africa and ICMs, several colleagues and advisors for their encouragement and support and award from Utias. So, thank you very much. I'll be happy to address any questions.
00:53:40.932 - 00:53:51.124, Speaker A: Thank you, Sid. So I think there are some questions, but before maybe I. John Hong, is it okay if I ask the first question?
00:53:51.244 - 00:53:52.144, Speaker C: Yes, please.
00:53:53.004 - 00:54:04.524, Speaker A: So, interesting thing. Suppose I had multiple droplet clouds and the interference in them. What, what. How does that affect your dynamics?
00:54:06.504 - 00:54:11.684, Speaker B: I mean, if you say that all the. I mean, the multiple droplet clouds remain infectious.
00:54:12.944 - 00:54:26.044, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, in. Do you just. Is there some like, this is a density that you have to integrate over or something? Is it like there are multiple events happening in a certain volume of space?
00:54:27.574 - 00:55:00.450, Speaker B: Okay, so, I mean, if they are not infectious, I mean, there can be two conditions. That is we have one infected cloud and other not infected cloud. So in that case, the non infected clouds will affect the dynamics of this by several effects through basically turbulence and through dilution. So we can include all those things. And when we say ventilation. So this multiple people moving around their exhalations, all this will add to increased turbulence and increased turbulence will lead to further enhanced diffusion of this cloud. So this cloud will then diffuse faster.
00:55:00.450 - 00:55:21.274, Speaker B: That is one effect that we can definitely think about. But if you have multiple infectious cloud. Then its situation becomes complicated. And then also, I believe we can address this, but we have to basically consider what you said, interference of these clouds and the total number of ice particles that have been integrated over all these clouds. But it can be done.
00:55:21.394 - 00:55:27.066, Speaker A: Right? Right. And even if it's not infectious, the turbulence is a nonlinear phenomena.
00:55:27.090 - 00:55:27.250, Speaker B: Right.
00:55:27.282 - 00:55:29.362, Speaker A: You'd have to deal with that.
00:55:29.538 - 00:55:40.210, Speaker B: So what we can deal with is, basically, we can model it using a turbulent diffusivity, which can be a function of your ventilation rates and function of the people moving around, etcetera, and all these things.
00:55:40.362 - 00:56:17.724, Speaker A: Okay. So I think this is really, really interesting and important work, because right now, as people think about the reopening of society, we may look at what we have at hand, namely public health measures such as masking and so on. We may look to vaccines, but then there are still public spaces where these things are not practical, as masking, for example, is not practical. And so ventilation is going to be a serious issue in terms of our return to normal. So this. These kind of models, I think they're very important. So it's very interesting work.
00:56:17.724 - 00:56:23.944, Speaker A: I'm glad you guys are active in that. Good. Now I see. I think. I think. Tom, you had a question.
00:56:24.724 - 00:56:31.344, Speaker C: Yeah. But also, Atasha, I want you. Hold on, and we'll definitely give a chance to ask questions.
00:56:32.404 - 00:56:33.224, Speaker A: Yep.
00:56:33.804 - 00:56:35.184, Speaker D: Shall I jump in?
00:56:36.044 - 00:56:36.596, Speaker B: Yes.
00:56:36.700 - 00:56:37.452, Speaker D: Tom here.
00:56:37.548 - 00:56:38.304, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:56:38.944 - 00:57:30.084, Speaker D: Yeah. Fascinating talk. Thank you very much. I love the preamble with the multiple scales going from seconds and micrometers to thousands of kilometers, just to go even more microscopic. I've been thinking a lot about the Haas dose response, which is sort of imagining the fire on virions inside the body. Could you say that if you inhale nuclei, what you call nuclei, would that land in the tissue in a different way from droplets? And so with the rate that are in equation 17, that r factor, would that be different for nuclei versus droplets?
00:57:30.464 - 00:57:53.544, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. It can definitely be in. In this case, we do not consider them to be different. I don't think that is known sufficiently well yet that what would be the. If the dose response curve would be different for droplets versus nuclei, but it can definitely be different. But in this work, we have not considered them to be different.
00:57:54.564 - 00:58:36.982, Speaker D: Yeah. So, mathematically, the exponential function has wonderful properties, but I sort of think with an immune system acting on the cerions when they enter the body, that exponential curve actually could be, it seems to me, quite a different shape from that. I do. I've been working with this problem, and the exponential. I do know it has some really special properties, but I wonder whether it's really true. But anyway, I thought it was fascinating that you're linking this scale of. To the physics of the aerosols and droplets, but I just wouldn't.
00:58:36.982 - 00:58:46.474, Speaker D: So the in host, what happens to the nuclei and droplets in the body is then a very interesting question. I wonder if you comment on that.
00:58:47.574 - 00:59:16.900, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. That's a very important question, but, yeah, I cannot comment on that. I mean, this is the. This is extremely important, as you point out, that because this couples the whole infection with the. With the rest of the physics that is happening. But I think this is essentially this kind of dose response model is the state of the art. I don't think, at least mathematically or physically.
00:59:16.900 - 00:59:24.006, Speaker B: It is known beyond this kind of a model to integrate the physics with the. With the physiology.
00:59:24.030 - 00:59:27.194, Speaker A: I would say we need the in host people.
00:59:28.254 - 00:59:38.794, Speaker B: So this is. This goes into the. Basically the domain of immunology and which I don't know anything about. So I cannot. I cannot go farther than this equation, to be honest.
00:59:39.494 - 00:59:47.394, Speaker C: We're trying to find the immunologist to have a pair to generate further discussions on this.
00:59:47.534 - 00:59:48.734, Speaker B: Yeah, of course.
00:59:49.434 - 00:59:56.094, Speaker C: I would like to really, Tasha, if you can open, unmute and ask a question directly.
00:59:59.794 - 01:00:00.802, Speaker A: Sorry, who's that?
01:00:00.898 - 01:00:04.946, Speaker C: Okay, so let me. So this is a student, a grade nine student.
01:00:05.010 - 01:00:05.914, Speaker A: Oh, Artash.
01:00:06.034 - 01:00:33.918, Speaker C: Artash. And he want to thank the speaker for a very fascinating presentation. And, uh, he is asking. He's curious to know if your model can explain the disparity in infection rates between different countries, especially countries with warmer and colder temperature. Which parameter of you model could account for this difference?
01:00:34.086 - 01:01:18.310, Speaker B: Oh, that would be that. I think the, I mean, initially we were thinking about droplet, infoprosion, all these things. But digging more into this, I think the most important parameter that governs is this one is the virus half life. Okay. This is the most important parameter that probably governs why the infection shoots up in colder. In winter times, especially indoors, where the relative humidity can be very small, versus in warmer countries, where the temperature is higher. Of course, you have to take into account that the ventilation rates in warmer places, not necessarily warmer countries, are also much higher in winter time.
01:01:18.310 - 01:02:00.894, Speaker B: You close the doors and the air kind of circulates inside. So that reduces those things also. But in one word, in my understanding, it is this virus half life. I mean, you can see here that at 20% relative humidity, the virus does not almost decay. This is from the actual data for SARS CoV, it only decays at 40 degrees celsius. Okay, so it almost stays here, whereas if the relative humidity is 70%, it goes up here. So, and even at the same relative, even at the same temperature, even at the same relative humidity, also the temperature is a very bigger.
01:02:00.894 - 01:02:04.884, Speaker B: So I think this is the most important factor.
01:02:05.044 - 01:02:14.504, Speaker A: Is there a role for the, I mean, viscosity if there's high humidity, is it the half life, or is it just simply that the thing can't move?
01:02:14.884 - 01:03:11.884, Speaker B: What happens is that, I think, I mean, once again, the experts, I mean, as I showed the professor, Lindsay Mar, is the foremost expert who can answer this kind of questions. But in my understanding, what this u shaped curve results from, the fact that if the relative humidity is very small, then the droplet kind of quickly evaporates and it leaves behind this droplet nuclei and the virus remains frozen there. So there is nothing to basically deactivate. On the other hand, if the droplet remains as is very high relative humidity, when the droplet does not evaporate, then also the virus can sustain well within the droplet. But in this middle relative humidity, what happens is that the droplet loses water, but the protein mass fraction kind of increases, and the virus probably doesn't like that protein. I mean, the protein is kind of responsible for deactivating the virus, and that results in the deactivation of the virus in this kind of mid relative.
01:03:14.064 - 01:03:15.844, Speaker A: Interesting. Very interesting.
01:03:17.144 - 01:03:56.494, Speaker C: Thank you. I do have questions, but I think the time is running out. Maybe I should take the opportunity to first of, thank the speaker again for coming to the fields institute. This is fantastic talk, really, in the heart of what fields is really trying to bring together. So we will find other opportunities to bring you again to this institute. And again, on behalf of the institute and Omar is here, and on behalf of the task of also, I want to thank you again and thank all the audience today.
01:03:57.114 - 01:04:03.482, Speaker B: Thank you very much. It has been a great pleasure and honor to speak in this audience, and thank you for inviting me for this talk. Thank you.
01:04:03.578 - 01:04:07.674, Speaker A: Okay, so see you, everybody, next week, next summer. Bye.
