00:00:00.280 - 00:00:30.444, Speaker A: Our next speaker of the morning is Martin Schneider, who will speak on dynamics of unit groups of von Neumann's continuous rings. Thanks, Andy. And, of course, I would like to start by. Can you hear me all right? Okay, perfect. Thanks. Yeah, I want to start, really, by thanking the organizers for inviting me. It's really been a fantastic week with a lot of very inspiring and very considerate talks.
00:00:30.444 - 00:01:09.498, Speaker A: I'm glad to have. Yeah. To have been here for this week. And, of course, I'm also grateful for the opportunity to contribute with my own talk, which will be, as Andy said. Oh, thanks. About dynamics of unit groups of phenomenon's continuous rings. So, it will be about topological dynamics, but it also will be about, I guess, a type of object that is not so, or a class of objects that is not so well known, or perhaps not that popular.
00:01:09.498 - 00:01:54.546, Speaker A: So I'll spend some time at the beginning to, well, give some very brief explanation of what continuous rings are and where they come from, what. Well, how they emerged and why von Neumann introduced them. Okay, so I'll take a start with just saying a few words about continuous rings. So, yeah, so, r in the following. R will be a ring. So a unitile ring, non zero. So that unit is distinct from zero.
00:01:54.546 - 00:02:38.188, Speaker A: And I want to recall a notion that von Neumann invented, and that is the notion of a regular ring. Okay? And that means that for every element of the ring, there exists another element of the ring with the property that aba equals a. So far, it's just some algebraic condition. You can. Well, I want to give an example just at the beginning to think about. So, let's say k is a field. It could also be a skew field.
00:02:38.188 - 00:03:10.638, Speaker A: But if you. If you don't like skew fields too much, it's perfectly fine and perfectly interesting. In the case of a field, and we just look at the. We just look at a matrix ring. So let's say this guy here, the ring of n by n matrices with coefficients in that ring. That will be an example of a regular ring, and that is actually easily verified. So what you do is you can simply.
00:03:10.638 - 00:04:25.454, Speaker A: I think I'll be able to just write it here. You know that, well, given, given some matrix a, we need to produce such a b, and that's actually a consequence of gaussian elimination. So if we start with an element a of that matrix ring, we know that we will find invertible matrices that we can multiply, say, s and t, so that we will get a matrix of that form one, one, one on the diagonal, but, well, then potentially some zeros a matrix of this form some b, and, well, now you can just define b from such a pair of invertible matrices. You just define b, and then we can simply verify it. So for, in that case, we can simply verify that Aba. So a t is a. That's the same thing as s inverse e b t inverse.
00:04:25.454 - 00:04:46.734, Speaker A: I just used this condition here in two cases. And then this is an idempotent matrix. So it's just e. So it's s inverse, e t inverse. That's just a. So that's really what I wanted to have. So just to give an example.
00:04:46.734 - 00:05:24.056, Speaker A: Okay, well, okay. Some algebraic condition. It's, it's satisfied by these matrix rings. What is so special about these rings is that you can associate with every such ring, you can associate a particular lattice. So let me just define the set. So it's just a set of all principle left ideals. Principle left ideals of that ring, and it actually forms a lattice.
00:05:24.056 - 00:05:57.124, Speaker A: So if you take the sum of two such principle left ideals, then, well, what gets out of it will still be a principle left ideal, which is something that doesn't happen in general rings. Of course, it's due to the fact that it's a regular ring and it's not trivial to prove that. Same for the intersection. And that lattice that you will get even will have further properties. It will be complemented. Complemented modular. Complemented modular lattice.
00:05:57.124 - 00:06:22.344, Speaker A: And yes, with respect to inclusion. With respect to inclusion. Okay. It's a bounded lattice. It has a smallest and largest element. So complemented just means that for every element of that lattice, I find another one. So, so that the infimum of the two is the bottom element and the supremum of the two is the top element.
00:06:22.344 - 00:07:22.388, Speaker A: And modularity, I guess, is something that I will not really need it, but it simply says that it's some conditional form of distributivity. So if you have two elements and x is below y, then x supremum y infermum z equals y x supremum z. Okay. And that's really for all y z in that letters. This is what, some sort of conditional distributivity? It's actually not so important, the precise condition. What is important, though, is that by a theorem by Freneumann on this side, you can actually get almost all such lattices. Well, there are some exceptional cases.
00:07:22.388 - 00:08:16.020, Speaker A: I'll say something about them in a minute. But you can get all by this construction. You will get all complemented modular lettuces of an order, at least four. Okay, what happens here in this particular situation in this matrix case. So this LR is really isomorphic to the space of linear subspaces of this vector space here. Okay. One way to establish, I mean to just write down one to one correspondence here would be to say, well, to go say from here to here, you could say for a given subspace, I want to assign with that such an ideal.
00:08:16.020 - 00:09:37.192, Speaker A: Just give me the set of all matrices, all of whose rows belong to that subspace. Okay. And the other way around, if you have an ideal here then you just take all the rows and they will be, I mean you can, because it's a left ideal, you can just take the first row and the others will, will be there too. And that actually, I guess something very familiar this should remind you of the coordination of finite dimensional projective geometries. And that's actually where this whole thing comes from. So there's very classical theory, a classical coordinator theorem by Weber and Young, the sort of the fundamental theorem of projective geometry that tells you that putting aside those exceptional disagreeing planes, every finite dimensional projective geometry of dimension at least three can be coordinateized over some skew field, over some division algebra. And this theorem was something that von Neumann put into comparison with observations that he had made as part of a joint work with Francis Murray in operator algebras.
00:09:37.192 - 00:11:04.554, Speaker A: So what von Neumann observed was that there is a lot of similarities between these lattices here on this side that will basically encode projective geometries and geometries that arise from finite, for Neumann algebras. And this is what he well, used as a starting point to really set up a whole theory. So the whole theory of continuous rings is, well, it could also be formulated as a theory of. Or it is really, it has a sibling that is the theory of continuous rings. And what is, sorry, of continuous geometry. So what is a continuous geometry? Continuous geometry, this is, well, it's a complete, complete complemented modular lattice l such that the lattice operations here furthermore satisfy a certain type of continuity. So I think I shouldn't go below this.
00:11:04.554 - 00:11:29.810, Speaker A: Right. Is the next line still alright? Yeah. Okay. So whenever we say it again, a few more. Okay. Okay. So for every chain, if you and every other element of your lattice, if you take the supremum of the chain and well, you take the infimum with that element, it's the same thing as this supremum here.
00:11:29.810 - 00:12:33.534, Speaker A: So you can first take the infimum with that single element and then take that supremum. And dually, if you take here the infimum, the supremum and here, the infimum, then it's the same thing. Okay, this is what von Neumann defined as a continuous geometry. What has this to do with, with the above? Now in this line here, that corresponds to finite dimensional projective geometries. Of course, this is a very particular kind of such lattices. Well, most importantly, the lattices that show up here have a bound on the length of their maximal chains, right? You have that dimension n. So you know that the maximum length of a chain that you will see in this lattice is n plus one.
00:12:33.534 - 00:13:20.704, Speaker A: But these examples, which we will see in a second, that came from the theory of operator algebras, they don't have anything that resembles that. So they don't have a bound on the length of chains, they don't have atoms. So he was really looking for a counterpart, some version of projective geometry that is point free. So he had to get rid of this condition. But what he still wanted to have is, well, he wanted to have infinite limits in this order theoretic sense. And he wanted those suprema and infima to be continuous to satisfy this kind of continuity condition. And the rings that correspond to these continuous geometries, they are just the continuous rings.
00:13:20.704 - 00:14:21.460, Speaker A: So that's what a continuous ring is. A continuous ring is a regular ring that has the property that this lattice here is a continuous geometry. Now maybe I put it on here so that this lattice is a continuous geometry. Okay? And these continuous rings, we will see next that they come equipped with an intrinsic topology, which is, this is not part of the, of the definition, of course. Well, this is an algebraic condition. And this, yeah, okay. It's a condition about the lattice, but they, they will have further properties that just follow from these assumptions.
00:14:21.460 - 00:15:22.610, Speaker A: And I'm interested in, and I want to tell you a few things about the dynamics of the groups of invertebrate, invertible elements of these continuous rings. Okay, so I think I'll go over here. So the first thing, I mean, the first really big thing that von Norman proved was this correspondence in the first line, so that actually you will get every complemented modular lattice with, of an order at least four. I know I'm not tell what, what order means in this context. And the second thing is dimension theory. So he proved. So this was maybe 35, I should say, that all of this, all this theory that he developed on continuous geometries and continuous rings originated within really a very brief period of time.
00:15:22.610 - 00:16:08.814, Speaker A: This was just two years he was working on this. And, but it's multiple papers. It's a book that, I mean, it's his lecture notes, that of a lecture series that he held at Princeton. So this is quite a lot of, quite a body of literature that exists, and it's just work by von Neumann and then some of his students. So let's say r is an irreducible continuous ring. So what does irreducibility means? Mean, it just means that you cannot represent r as, in a non trivial fashion, as the direct sum of two other rings. Okay.
00:16:08.814 - 00:17:01.674, Speaker A: And the same, by the way, the same notion of irreducibility I could define for a lattice. A lattice is irreducible if it cannot be written in a non trivial way as a direct product of two lattices. And these two notions of irreducibility, they really correspond to one another via this correspondence. So a ring is irreducible if and only if it's associated, a regular ring if and only if the, the associated lattice is irreducible. And actually, in the context of continuous rings, I could, this is also the same thing as saying that the ring is simple. Okay, now every such ring admits a sorry, simple doesn't have non trivial two sided ideals, just as the algebraic notion, for they do have a lot of idempotence. But it's about central idempotence that commute with everything.
00:17:01.674 - 00:17:47.514, Speaker A: That would be another way of saying it that doesn't have, I mean, of course it has zero and one, but those are the only central idempotents. Okay. Actually, the geometry of idempotence in such rings is the essential thing about the ring and the associated geometry. Okay, so there is a unique, I call it rho, and this, well, it's unique. So it's really something that comes from the ring. It's a unique rank function, rank function, rank function. So what do I mean by that? That's really definition.
00:17:47.514 - 00:18:52.264, Speaker A: So it's a few properties. So first of all, the rank of the one in the ring, one element in the ring is 1. Second, for any two elements in the ring, the rank of the product of the two is bounded by the minimum of the ranks of those two elements. Third, that's now about idempotence. So for any two idempotent elements, so e is idempotent, f is idempotent if the two are orthogonal. So this means the product of ef equals the product of fe equals zero. If that is the case, if we have two orthogonal idempotents, then the rank of their sum is really the sum of their ranks.
00:18:52.264 - 00:19:42.414, Speaker A: And fourth condition that I will put here from this already, it follows that actually the rank of the zero element is zero, because zero is an idempotent. And I can summit many times, of course. And that this equation holds will entail that actually the rank is zero. But this should be an if, if and only if. So it's really, this equals zero if and only if. This is the zero element. Okay, those are the properties of a rank function.
00:19:42.414 - 00:20:24.144, Speaker A: Such an irreducible continuous ring always exists, admits a unique one. And here you can see in this example, well, it's just the usual rank function, but normalized. That's what it is. Okay. And, but there's more. So this map here called doctor, I mean, the rank defines a distance defines a metric. So the distance of two ring elements is just the rank of their difference.
00:20:24.144 - 00:21:08.634, Speaker A: This is a metric, not just a metric, it's a complete metric. So it turns the ring into a complete metric space. And, well, you can, if you restrict it to its group of invertibles, it will be a bi invariant metric on that group. Okay, so this is, this is a complete metric. And there is a dichotomy on the range of this metric that I should mention. There can only be two things happening. It could be that the range of this function is finite.
00:21:08.634 - 00:21:55.386, Speaker A: And then this is really the case where your ring is isomorphic to a ring of that form over some skew field. And the rank function is precisely, well, the only rank function that exists. So the one that you know. And if that is not the case, then it really has, it's really a subjection onto the whole interval. So you really have continuous dimension. So I guess it's slowly unfolding how this is a continuous version of, well, at least say, the theory of these matchmake strings. I will not be telling you too much about the projective geometries from this perspective, but I want to mention, before I continue, I mean, I want to tell you what the goal is.
00:21:55.386 - 00:23:14.994, Speaker A: I will just say, well, the goal of what I have been looking into here, and what I want to tell you is I want to understand, understand topological dynamics of the group of invertible elements of the ring. So I just call it GlR. I sometimes call it U of R, but it's dangerous because it could be the unitary group of something that's associated with it. So, so this is really just a group of invertible elements. And this group of invertible elements can be described slightly differently in terms of that rank function. Well, it's really just the set of those elements that have rank one. So it's again, like in the finite dimensional case, those that have full rank with the associated with the topology inherited from R.
00:23:14.994 - 00:23:55.004, Speaker A: So it's a closed subset. I mean, the rank function is Elipsett's function with respect to that metric. So it's so sort of well behaved. Okay, so that will be the goal. And I guess I want to mention now two examples that you can, if you are sort of on the edge of getting bored already, you can at least take home those two examples. So, first example, this is really, this is Sort of a limiting case of this, of these guys in a more direct fashion. So let's say we have, we fix again some field or skew field.
00:23:55.004 - 00:24:46.766, Speaker A: Then what I can do is I can consider, move this slightly up. I can consider the following sequence of embeddings. So here I look at the group of matrices, but now it's two to the n by two to the n matrices over that field. And of course I can naturally embedded into the next guy by just, well, taking a matrix and duplicating it along the diagonal. That's a unital embedding of rings. Okay, this is nothing too difficult. So I call it phi I.
00:24:46.766 - 00:25:15.350, Speaker A: And of course I have a whole, that's really something. The first in line here is the field itself, which is isomorphic of course, to this matrix group. And then it continues, and then it continues further. So let me take, here, let me take the inductive limit of this. So I write this. This is really just a symbol. I'm not actually taking the infinite power of two.
00:25:15.350 - 00:26:00.284, Speaker A: It's really just a symbol. Let me let this be the inductive limit, inductive limit of these rings, just the union. And because they are all embeddings of unital rings, the group operation will be well defined. Now I make another observation. These phi I's, they are actually isometric, isometric maps. So an observation, observation. So this family of phi is, they are isometric.
00:26:00.284 - 00:26:53.754, Speaker A: So I should tell you what the metric is. So on each of these guys, I can put a metric, and the metric will be the normalized rank metric. So we move over here. So the metric would be dn, would be a metric on here. And of course, the distance of two matrices is really just the normalized rank of their, of their difference. Okay, they are isometric. So actually these metrics, this family of metrics lifts to the inductive limit.
00:26:53.754 - 00:27:40.626, Speaker A: It's. Well, if I want to compare two elements, I just go to some stage where they are both defined, where they both enter in that inductive limit and I compute that distance. And it doesn't really matter if I made a mistake and I jumped to an earlier time and computed the distance there, because these are symmetric. So this so gives rise to a metric, metric, d infinity, on this inductive limit. And I can simply define now m infinity. Now I forget the two, which may be a bit dangerous because the construction depends on what I want. Well, in some sense depends on the two, but it will not actually depend on it.
00:27:40.626 - 00:28:46.062, Speaker A: So I just define this to be the completion, completion of this metric space. Completion of this metric space. And one of the first examples of a continuous geometry of a continuous ring was this. So this thing here is a simple or reducible continuous ring. I already hinted at the fact that the role of the two here is not so essential. We could have taken any sequence, any factorial sequence of natural numbers. So with the condition that the, well, it's always, it always divides the next, the next natural number in that sequence.
00:28:46.062 - 00:30:11.428, Speaker A: And it would have, they would have, the limit object that you get here is the same up to isomorphism. And I should say at this point, this has been, for the case of a finite field has been considered in the, well, in the context of metric frise theory. So actually if k is a finite, if k is finite, then this can be described, then this can be described as a frise limit of the class of finite matrix algebras equipped with their normalized rank distances. So this is by, so I'm not going to tell you any more about this, but this, so, connection with, say, connection with, with continuous logic. This was, I think, Anderson and Lupini in 2017. Okay, now the second example, there's more to tell about this, but leave it at that second example. Yes, the old ones here.
00:30:11.428 - 00:30:40.052, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely. They are always discrete objects. If I don't go past to a limit, these guys in this cosmos here, they are discrete objects. Yes. I mean, so what I wanted to, so this dichotomy, thanks for asking. So that I could state this dichotomy about the range here even differently. I could have said this topology is discrete or is non discrete if and only if that is a subjective function.
00:30:40.052 - 00:31:23.442, Speaker A: So I really see continuous continuous dimension. And in all the other cases, it's really just this discrete finite dimensional object. So the second example, I think I'll spend much less time on telling you about this. This was actually the example that led von Neumann to develop this joint generalization of finite dimensional projective geometries. And this guy. So let's say this is a for Neumann algebra. So a so called type two one factor, so certain type, I leave it at that, a certain type of von Neumann algebra acting on some Hilbert space.
00:31:23.442 - 00:32:17.066, Speaker A: H. So, for instance, this is something that you can associate with every. Well, with every, with a large class of discrete groups. For instance, you can say, this could be the group for Neumann algebra associated with a. That's the group for Neumann algebra. Group for Neumann algebra of a non trivial ICC group. Non trivial group in which ICC means it's a non trivial group in which every non identity element has an infinite controversy class.
00:32:17.066 - 00:33:03.602, Speaker A: Okay, there's an object that you can associate with it that will give you such an, such a type to one factor. I'll not say more about this. And so what von Neumann, Descarbert. And this was, this was, I should say, in joint work with Murray, I put the reference at the end was that the set of projections of such a von Neumann algebra forms a continuous geometry in the sense. So there should be a ring giving rise to it. And this ring is, this ring is what is called the ring of affiliated operators. I think I'll skip the definition of this.
00:33:03.602 - 00:33:56.854, Speaker A: Those who know this, well, I guess maybe fine with it just being mentioned, and those who don't. There's not enough time to give a reasonable account on this here. But this is. So this is just the ring of, of, I should say, densely defined closed linear operators affiliated with M. Operators affiliated, affiliated with M. Okay. And this is Murray and van 36.
00:33:56.854 - 00:34:36.352, Speaker A: Okay, so much for the, for the examples. As I said, I want to tell you something about the dynamics of these groups of invertible elements. And as you may expect at this point, those will be large groups. Typically, they will not be polish groups. I mean, this guy here, if, for instance, the field k is countable, then this guy will be separable. But otherwise, there's no real reason for it to have accountable then subset. They are large groups, but they're not polish groups.
00:34:36.352 - 00:35:06.244, Speaker A: That's it. Not in general. Okay. But. Well, I will tell you something, or I want to tell you something about their dynamics, which will tell you that they are in fact quite large. Maybe I. And for that, I want to briefly recall a theorem that has made an appearance earlier this week in Todor's talk.
00:35:06.244 - 00:35:48.676, Speaker A: And that's the theorem by William beach from the seventies. So, what's the theorem again? So, we are entering now the second 2nd part. So, topological dynamics. So, the theorem that I want to recall is this. William Beach 77. Every locally compact group admits a free flow. That's the theorem.
00:35:48.676 - 00:36:57.734, Speaker A: Every locally compact group, that's a free flow. So, as in the other dynamical talks, a flow of a topological group is a non empty compact house of space equipped with a jointly continuous action of the group on that space. And free? Well, free means that if you have a group element that fixes some element of that space when acting on it, then it means that that group element had to be the neutral element. Only the neutral element can have any fixed point in your space. Okay, so this theorem is the reason why several people have mentioned extreme amenability doesn't show up for discrete groups or even for locally compact groups. For instance, Justin mentioned that. Just recall an extremely amenable group.
00:36:57.734 - 00:38:07.664, Speaker A: Extremely amenable means that for every flow that exists, we need a global fixed point. Okay? And, well, it implies a property that is very well familiar to the. To group theorists. It's almost the same thing, but with regular Borrell probability measures such that for all g. So this is just to compare. Now, you may think, okay, I may be about to tell you that these groups are all extremely amenable. Well, at least I can tell you something in that direction.
00:38:07.664 - 00:39:14.684, Speaker A: So, first result, I think, really the first result that was considering dynamics of these, these groups. This is by Alessandro Caderi and Andreas Tohm. It was published in 18. It appeared in 16 on the archive. If k is a finite field, then the group of invertebrate, invertible elements, the group of invertible elements here of this ring that I mentioned up there, this is an extremely amenable group. Okay? And so another way to think of this is, this is a closure of this kind of. Of union of these general linear groups of the k.
00:39:14.684 - 00:40:02.304, Speaker A: So you can just think of this where you can forget about the continuous rings again and just say, okay, there's some sort of. There's an inductive limit of these general linear groups. And then I take a completion. I don't really have to go through this. This is an extremely amenable one. And so the proof of this has really something to do with this other phenomenon that, fortunately was mentioned by Lionel yesterday, this phenomenon of concentration of measure, which is a second route to extreme amenability. But it makes heavy use of the fact that the k is finite.
00:40:02.304 - 00:40:26.616, Speaker A: I mean, I will not go into the details of this, but it really is. It depends on this. So, if you want to prove that all these groups are extremely amenable, you. You would need to develop something that is essentially different when different in an essential way from this. And actually, I. What I can tell you is that it is doomed. So they are not all extremely amenable.
00:40:26.616 - 00:41:23.504, Speaker A: These examples, these unit groups of continuous rings, actually, there are some that are not even amenable. And, well, in some sense it makes sense if you think of them as some sort of continuous analog of general linear groups. But it turns out to be more complicated to actually prove this. So if gamma is something that is called, if it's a discrete group, discrete group that is not inner amenable. So inner amenable means we can look at the action of G. So, okay, I'll first state it and then say what the definition is. Well, then the unit group of this ring of affiliated operators that I mentioned, operators affiliated with the group von Neumann algebra of this thing.
00:41:23.504 - 00:42:05.560, Speaker A: This is non amenable. This is non amenable. And just to tell you what this means. So it means, so we can look at the action of the group by conjugation, conjugation on the set of non identity elements. So we discard the identity element and let gamma act on this set by conjugation. The definition of inner amenability is that this action admits an invariant mean. So there is a mean on little l infinity.
00:42:05.560 - 00:42:50.340, Speaker A: So a positive unital linear functional on little l l infinity of the set that is invariant under that action. Okay, so examples of this group of such groups are, okay, free groups, Thompson's group groups V and t, they are not in amenable. I suspect that this should be, that this conclusion should hold a much greater generality. But it's actually, well, for me, it didn't turn out to be that easy to prove just in this case, so. Okay, but there is something that I, that I want to mention to you about. Yes, that's what I think. Okay.
00:42:50.340 - 00:43:34.882, Speaker A: My really poorly educated guess is that the overwhelming majority of continuous rings, of unit groups, of continuous rings should lean towards non amenability. I mean, whatever that means. Okay. But. And I mean, this has really to do with, well, these affiliated operators and stuff. I think it doesn't, doesn't really fit well for this talk, but there is a property that I want to mention to you that is a bit. I mean, the unfortunate thing about extreme amenability is that, well, it is a way of saying a group is large, but it also, well, it entails amenability.
00:43:34.882 - 00:43:56.962, Speaker A: So it somehow. It's like, okay, every. It's. If you, if you exhibit extreme amenability of a group, of course you say that it's. That it's a large group, but you. Well, it almost sounds like a group that is large should necessarily be amenable. And that's.
00:43:56.962 - 00:44:42.298, Speaker A: I want to. I want to make a definition that is, that, that somehow is of a slightly different spirit. That really has to do with this theorem, of which. So I call a group inert, a topological group, if for every g flow and for every single element, there exists a point that is fixed. So, in particular, this means I move this up. So, in particular, by which theorem, such a group cannot be locally compact unless it's a trivial group. Okay.
00:44:42.298 - 00:44:53.254, Speaker A: Yeah, but that's. That's the only. The only case. How much time do I have? Five. Five minutes. Yes. Okay, so.
00:44:53.254 - 00:45:57.436, Speaker A: So this is clearly a property of large topological groups. Maybe a simple example or a quick example of such a group, these l zero groups that showed up in Francois's talk. But I think for integer coefficients, right, yes. Well, you can, of course, do the same thing, but for your coefficients, you take free group on two generators, any non amenable, discrete group. So, we look at the group of all measurable maps from the interval to that countable group, and it gets this topology of convergence. In measure, this group is non amenable as a topological group, which doesn't simply follow from the fact that f two embeds into it. It's more complicated to prove this.
00:45:57.436 - 00:46:55.904, Speaker A: So this is non amenable, but it's inert. The inertia part has to do with results by Giordano and Pestoff, and the non amenability follows from a work of pestoff and myself from a few years ago. Okay, now, the reason why. I mean, what has this to do with the work of, with. Well, I mean, I'm mentioning work of Giordano and Pestoff, which has to do with extreme amenability of l zero groups. But here, well, it will not apply, because the group that we have put here is a non amenable group, but it actually has to do with the following. Very simple lemma.
00:46:55.904 - 00:47:32.324, Speaker A: Very simple lemma. So, let's say g is a topological group. If. If you have. If g is the closure of the union of all its extremely amenable subgroups. So, let's say if this happens, and there's no. I mean, the extremely amenable subgroups of a topological group, they don't form a directed family or anything.
00:47:32.324 - 00:48:02.626, Speaker A: This hypothesis here really is just saying the set of elements of the group that are contained in some extremely amino subgroup, that set should be dense. That's. That's it. If that is true, then, well, then g is inert. Okay, so. Well, at least, I mean, it's a sufficient criterion for this inertness I don't know. I mean, all the examples I know of in groups come via this simple lemma.
00:48:02.626 - 00:49:10.704, Speaker A: I guess it shouldn't be a characterization, but I don't have another example. Okay, now the theorem, the theorem that I wanted to get to, and hopefully I did. So if r is any non discrete, any non discrete irreducible continuous ring, then this group here is inert. So that's the result. It uses this lemma above, but it's really, I mean, the lemma above is a one line thing. It uses a lot of work by von Neumann. And it is another instance of a case of extreme amenability that shows up due to concentration of measure.
00:49:10.704 - 00:49:54.008, Speaker A: As I said, Lionel mentioned this method of using concentration of measure to establish extreme amenability. What will happen here is, I can say this very, I guess I have 1 minute or a few seconds. I see. So the idea here is, I do this very quickly. There's three steps, and each of which are not quite trivial. So the first is something is really using material by von Neumann, he showed, and that's actually a very beautiful analog of Kelly Hamilton theorem. He showed that in these non discrete irreducible continuous rings, the set of algebraic elements is dense.
00:49:54.008 - 00:50:28.946, Speaker A: Now, what is an algebraic element? Element? The center of such a ring is a field. That's actually the fact that this assumption, irreducibility, is equivalent to the center of the ring being field. And then I can speak of algebraic elements. I can say, okay, there should be zeros of some non trivial polynomials. They're actually dense. In the case of this ring here, this is really just an application of Kelly Hamilton, because every square matrix is a zero of its own characteristic polynomial. There's nothing, no analog of characteristic polynomials here.
00:50:28.946 - 00:51:08.474, Speaker A: This is completely different. And then there is an analog. Well, I proved that, an analog of a triangularization theorem. So a continuous triangularization. So. So I managed to show that these algebraic elements, they're all contained in, well, they each stabilize some maximal chain, and then, well, I show that the groups that each of them inside of these stabilizing subgroups of maximal chains that are contained in some extremely amenable subgroup. And this is then using concentration of measure.
00:51:08.474 - 00:51:23.534, Speaker A: Okay, I'm happy to tell more details to those who are interested. And for the time being, I thank you all for your attention. Thank you, Martin. Any questions?
