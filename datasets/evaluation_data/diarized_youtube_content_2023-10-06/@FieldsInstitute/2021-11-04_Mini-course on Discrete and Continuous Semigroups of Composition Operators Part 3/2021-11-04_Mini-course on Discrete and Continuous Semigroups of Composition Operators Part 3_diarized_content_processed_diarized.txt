00:00:04.680 - 00:00:14.994, Speaker A: Hello, everybody. Welcome to the third day. We continue with lectures by Isabel on composition operators. Isabel, please.
00:00:15.614 - 00:01:41.194, Speaker B: Thank you, Jeannette. So for the last lecture, we will have an answer to the questions we had, I think, at the end of the first lecture, or maybe the second. So the question was, can we deduce the limit of when t tends to infinity of c phi t? So it's very special semigroups, its composition operators, provided there are c zero, can we deduce the limit from the generator that is data at zero? So I remind you that, okay, we have an analytic semiflow on the open ended disk. Then we have a notion of generator for this semiflow defined by j. So j is the limit of this, and it happens that it's an allomorphic function on the open unit disk. This was proved by Bergson and Porter, as mentioned in several talks before. And the link between the generator of the composition and the generator of the semiflow is the following.
00:01:41.194 - 00:02:59.684, Speaker B: I call it a. And af is completely determined by g, because af is gf prime. And from this we can see that the a is not bounded in general, because its domain, it's not the whole space, because in many, many spaces, when you take an f, the relative is normal in the space, and provided you multiply by giving the same. It's not true. It's not evident that, it's not obvious that this will stay in the, in the right space, but at least provided it's a c zero semi group domain is dense. Okay, so first I will remind you, or mention, for people who are not familiar with that notion, well known properties of analytic semi flows. And I would like to make a recommendation about a very nice book, a recent book written by Filippo Bracci Contreras and Dias Madrigal, about continuous semi groups of allomatic self maps of the unit disc.
00:02:59.684 - 00:04:44.512, Speaker B: It's a very nice book where all the things I'm mentioning today are very well detailed and many other things inside. So very, very nice book. So the first thing is that for all t, phi t is automatically injective. This is important, for example, if you consider composition operators, same groups of composition operators on the directly space, for example, because in this case, because phi t is injective, c five t is well defined. A second observation is that if for some t zero, it happens that phi t zero is an automobile or even an elliptic automatism, that is an entomophism with a fixed point inside the opening disk, then it happens that all phi t is of the same kind of functions. So all the phi t are automatically automobile, and if one of them is elliptic, all the others are elliptic. And moreover, for all semiflows which are not elliptic automobiles, there is a unique point in the closed unit disk called alpha, as previously, such that you have the limit of phi t minus this point.
00:04:44.512 - 00:05:34.894, Speaker B: When you take the subnorm on a compact subset of the open unit disk, it turns to zero. So that's the. So you have a. We already knew, know that. Okay, just make a remark. For t zero fixed, we know that this is equal to mt t zero. Okay? And it happens at, sorry, it's composition by phi m t zero.
00:05:34.894 - 00:06:41.670, Speaker B: And from the tangible theory for just one composition operators, we know that this guy tends to one point called alpha. But this alpha may depend on the point t zero you have chosen. But nonviolent theory for semi groups says that it does not depend on the t you take. In fact, it's independent of the choice of the t zero. Okay, so now this such alpha is called the tangible point of the semifinal. And then I remind you a result already mentioned by a vagin garant. Yesterday, he mentioned Bergson and porta results, which is the following.
00:06:41.670 - 00:07:27.704, Speaker B: If you have a magnetic semiflow on the open unit disk, then the generator exists for all z. And moreover, we have a precise form of its generator. And the form is the following. It's an alpha, which is precisely in the case where phi t is not made of elliptic automatism. This alpha is not the wrong notation. That's really the same as the dangerous point of phi t. So it's alpha minus z times one, minus the conjugate of alpha times z times a certain function f, which is allomorphic, and for which the real part is non negative.
00:07:27.704 - 00:08:17.504, Speaker B: In fact, because f is allomorphic, if f is not constant, the real part will be strictly, will be positive, in fact, and. Oh, sorry, I have. Okay. Oh, thank you, Javet. Javet gave a link to the book of Filippo and others. Thanks. Okay, so, in particular, when you have function with such condition, it happens that it is automatically in the intersection of all the county space for p less than one.
00:08:17.504 - 00:09:50.760, Speaker B: And in particular, it implies that such f has a rather limits almost everywhere. So the g has all the same property, it has rather limits almost everywhere. And Bergson and Potter proved also that, reciprocally, if you have a g of this form, with an arbitrary f satisfying this condition, then it is the generator of a semiflow. So we have a complete characterization of the generator, and this characterization, at least when the fight are not elliptical. Thermopsin involves the dungeon valve point of the semi flow. I would like to mention another characterization of the generator of the semiflo that we obtained in a joint work with Corentin Avicu, one of my PhD students, and Jonathan Pattington. In 2015, we proved that another characterization of generator semiflows is in fact to be holomorphic, having radial limits almost everywhere on the unit circle and on the unit circle.
00:09:50.760 - 00:11:11.250, Speaker B: And here I mentioned, I consider the radial limits that in this sense that I write this because obviously g is not defined on the open, on the closed unit disk in general, but at least it has radial limits. And so another characterization, avoiding the dendritic point and the f and so on, is the real part of the conjugate of z. G of z is non positive almost everywhere on the unit circle. Okay, so now we will use the result I have presented yesterday. I will restrict myself to the hardest place, but okay, we can get the same result for other spaces. I will mention that later. So I have mentioned at the very end of the talk that existence of the p, such that p is the limit of the composition operators to the n.
00:11:11.250 - 00:12:28.044, Speaker B: So I just take one composition, not semi groups, that's a discrete case. And I mentioned that the existence of a limit for the topology of the norm is equivalent to the fact that you have a limit for the strong topology. There is no difference. And the criteria is the, the symbol of the composition is not inner and the phi has a fixed point inside the unit disk. Okay, and the reason for that is? Well, if phi phi is inner with a fixed point, it happens that c phi is similar to and isometry. So no way to get a limit. Okay, so from this we obtain the following result concerning Sony groups, we take the hard displays, but what I mentioned is true for other classical banal spaces, such that directly space Bergen spaces.
00:12:28.044 - 00:14:01.014, Speaker B: And this is the following. In fact, the semi group strongly converges to, well, a projection of rank one if and only if the same is true for the norm. And we can characterize this, we can characterize that in terms of the, in terms of properties of the generator, that is the generator g, the generator of the phi t, which is nearly the same as having the generator of the semi groups, because the a of this one, the a, which generates sin phi t is defined by this expression. So having a is equivalent to having g. So we have the convergence in the strongest topology or in the for the strong operator topology, if not, if the g has a zero. And we can find a borrel subset of the unit circle of positive measure, on which the real part. So this quantity must be understood in the sense of the raddle limits.
00:14:01.014 - 00:15:04.324, Speaker B: And the real part is negative on this non trivial borrowed subset of the unit circle. And just a few words explain why we have that. Okay, so the fact that g has a zero in d means exactly that. The alpha in the description of g given by Bergson Porta, which is the good candidate for being the countervolve point of the semi close, provided it's not an elliptic automatism, is inside. Okay, so we have this equivalence. Therefore phi t is an elliptic automobile for all t, or it is not the case. And in this case the dangerfoot point is in d, which is the criteria we have.
00:15:04.324 - 00:16:00.454, Speaker B: Okay, now let's look at the second condition. We grip at the rear part of this is negative on a non trivial subset of the unit circle. It happens that this is the way to express the fact that the semiflow phi t is not made of automobile. Indeed, if phi t is. So here, if I have automobile, so it's not just a semi flow, but a flow. And if I have a semi flow or a flow of automobile, it happens that g on its opposite minus g generates semi groups. So the real part of z bar g is negative and it's non positive.
00:16:00.454 - 00:17:09.414, Speaker B: And on the other side, the real part of z bar minus g is also non positive. So the real part must be equal to zero almost everywhere on the unit circle. So the way to say so here, it's an interpretation of that is just to avoid case of automobile. Okay, so it means that with this and this, we have cancelled the case of elliptic automobile. And why is it equivalent to the existence of a limit? In fact, I mentioned at the very beginning that for all the semi flow, they are automatically injective. So now our criteria, the symbol is not enough. But if you are not an injective, it's then equivalent to be not an atomoptin.
00:17:09.414 - 00:18:57.304, Speaker B: Okay, so you see that the work in the discrete case provide the answer for the semigroups. And in this case we are very lucky because we have a characterization of the existence of limits from a data at zero, that is, from the a or g. Okay, so it's at the end of the biggest part of this lecture, and now I will go slower. I wanted to be absolutely sure to have finished this part. So now I will leave the case at the open unit disk to study what happens for the asymptotic behavior of composition operators, but on other domain. So I would like to replace the open unit disk by the whole complex plane and I would like to look at composition operators on quite well studied spaces of entire function, that is a folk space. And I am interested in the same properties, namely the asymptotic behavior of c phi to the n, or the description of photons for semi groups of composition.
00:18:57.304 - 00:20:33.144, Speaker B: Okay, so, this work is a joint work with Jonathan we have this summer. It's our 1st 100% zoom paper. It's quite sad, but okay, that's life. Okay, so, I will start slowly with the definition of folk spaces and so on. So, for a parameter new finite between and greater or equal to one, the folk space f new consists of entire function such that the following integral is bounded. It's finite. So, I take the modulus of f and mu, and I put an exponential em.
00:20:33.144 - 00:22:00.764, Speaker B: And this is all that to the power of one other mu. Okay, we can give other more generalized folk spaces changing with this thing, but okay, we will stay in this kind of focus spaces, okay, so we have the norm, and this is a banner space. In fact, we can even say that for nu equals space. And it's a classical fact that in fact, when you take ez to the n over the square root of factorial n, this is an autonomous basis. Okay. And we would like to consider composition operators on both spaces. And this was the study.
00:22:00.764 - 00:24:24.644, Speaker B: So, we would like to study composition, and we would like to know first, for which phi is it well defined. So, we would like to characterize phi such that c phi is bounded. It was done in 2003 by Carswell, McLaur and Schuster. And what we did is, in the case of f two, they characterize the bounded operator on f two, the bounded composition operator as follows. So, the proof that c five is bounded on f two, if and only it just a few phi, for which it's possible. The defi is of the form a z b, where da must be of modulus strictly less than one. B is an arbitrary complex number, or the phi is just AZ with the modulus of a is equal to one.
00:24:24.644 - 00:25:47.084, Speaker B: And moreover, in the case where the modulus of a is true less than one, it happens that c is compact. Okay, okay. So, in fact, this result was then generalized for weighted composition operators, and with arbitrary new between one and infinity. But okay, this, this pioneer work is very important in this theory. Okay, maybe. Okay, the same. Well, later there was some generalization.
00:25:47.084 - 00:28:17.944, Speaker B: Then other people were compassed subject. For example, in 20 2014 Leh and even in 2016, I and coy I studied weighted composition operators w defined by WF composed with phi on the focus spaces general one and they proved also that so they can characterize completely when this is bounded. And in any cases, five must be of the form, the same form mentioned by the pioneer work of Carnswell, McLaurin and Schuster. Okay, so even for that, there is no choice, this for any weight. So in particular, for a weight equal to one, this is bounded implies that define the symbol must be of the form a z plus b with this condition. Okay, I think I will not have time enough to consider weighted composition operators, even if we also studied them, and we also studied their asymptotic behavior. But I will say we update the the case of unweighted composition.
00:28:17.944 - 00:29:26.274, Speaker B: So, composition. Okay, so, as previously, let's start with the case of the discrete case. So, we begin with the study of the powers of one c five, so discrete case. So, we would like to study asymptotic behavior of that. Now, c phi to the n. Because the phi is so simple, it's easy to describe c phi. N is just f composed with a to the n z plus one minus a n over one minus a b, provided a is not equal to one.
00:29:26.274 - 00:31:21.172, Speaker B: Okay, and so this is that, or this is just the identity map if a equal to one, because in the case where the modulus of a is equal to one, b must be zero, so that c five is well defined. Okay, and to study the assembly behavior of that once more, we use Nigel Nagel's result I mentioned yesterday. To that aim, we first need to check that c five is power bounded. So, to add aim, the first thing to do is to check that c phi is power bounded. Okay, but we have an estimation of the norm of c phi. That's also a work initiated by Carswell, McLaurin and Schuster. In the case nu equal to two.
00:31:21.172 - 00:32:52.382, Speaker B: And then. So it's the same paper. And then, generalized in 2019 by die, we have an estimation of the norm, which is independent of the parameter c five. The norm is in fact equal to the exponential of one over four. The modulus of b squared over one minus the modulus a square if at least phi is a z plus b, with a strictly less than one. Okay, so when we look at c phi to the n, because we have still a composition operators, c phi to the n is now composition by this function a to the n, and the b is replaced by this. It's easy to check that it's power bounded, at least for the models of a, is slightly less than one.
00:32:52.382 - 00:35:37.364, Speaker B: So now I put the theorem so the asymptotic of iteration of bounded composition operators on fog spaces is as follows. Okay, if phi is equal to a z with the modulus of a equal to one, and we avoid the trivial case of the identity map, then in this case c phi, nice is consist of unitary operator so it does not converge even weekly. So the most interesting case is the case where phi is equal to a z b. Then circumflex n converges in the strongest topology. So in the converges in norm, in operator norm to the evaluation at b over one minus a. Okay? And now we do the proof. Okay, in the first, if phi is just a z where a is modulus one, take the identity map.
00:35:37.364 - 00:37:58.274, Speaker B: So circumflex n is just f of a n z, and it's then equal to a n z. If so, we avoid the triple case if you take the f of z equal to z, okay? So it doesn't converge even weekly. Okay, so more interesting is the other one. So assume that we have a z plus b, okay, and c five to the end is c phi n, where the iterates of phi is just a to the n plus one minus an over one minus above. And so that's our new, so this is called an and this is our new bn. Okay? And we know from the expression of the norm that when we look at bn squared over one minus a n squared, because it's not, it's in the previous slide, okay? See that the norm of c phi is exponential of something like that. So you just have to compute b to the square, one minus a to the square.
00:37:58.274 - 00:39:04.494, Speaker B: It's easy. And you see, because of the expression you have and the fact that a is less than one, it tends to b square over one minus a squared, okay? Because, am I right? Yes. Okay. Is ten to zero and b and square tends to that. Okay? So it's power bounded. Now since c five is compact, the essential spectral radius of c five is zero. And in the Nagel's theorem, we require that the essential spectral radius is strictly less than one.
00:39:04.494 - 00:41:22.174, Speaker B: Okay? Now the other conditions concern the point spectrum. So for the points for the point spectrum sequence, there is an eigenvalue and f an eigenvector, okay? So such that f of a z plus b equal to lambda f of z iterate, we get f of a n z plus b. One minus a n over one minus a is then equal to lambda to the n f. So that is, um, so it implies that, it implies that, uh, lambda n f tends to f at b over one minus a for any z. And it follows that f is zero if lambda is equal to one, that's lambda equal to. So f must be zero. If the modulus of lambda is equal to one and lambda different from one.
00:41:22.174 - 00:43:34.418, Speaker B: Okay, so finally, if one is in the is in the spectrum c five, then one is in the point spectrum of c phi, since c phi is compact. Okay. And by this equation, in fact, the only eigenvector is constant. So f is constant if f is an eigenvector associated with one. And so the dimension of the kernel is one is one dimensional, so one is the pole of the resolvent of order at most one. Okay, and then we apply Nigel's theorem we have seen yesterday, and it happens that c n converges to rank. One operator converges in norm to t defined by tf equal f evaluated at b over one minus a times one.
00:43:34.418 - 00:45:01.764, Speaker B: The constant function one. Okay, so as you see, the point is that the phi for which c phi is well defined on the Fox spaces, they are quite limited. And applying Nigel's result, Nigel's results, we get the asymptotic behavior very easily. Now let's have a look to the semigroups. So we have done the discrete case and now we are interested in semigroups of composition operators. Okay, so take the color red for to show you the result. So in fact, a semi group of bounded composition operator on fog spaces satisfies one of the following conditions.
00:45:01.764 - 00:48:16.374, Speaker B: So first case, the phi t must be of the form exponential of lambda t z plus a certain constant c exponential of lambda t minus one, with the condition that lambda is in c minus defined to be the complex number for which the real part is negative. And, sorry. So the lambda must be like that and the c is arbitrary or the other solution is just that phi t is exponential of lambda t z for some pure imaginary complex numbers, for some lambda in r l. Okay, so still the cases of its limited, just a few semi flows for which we have the boundedness of composition operators. And the generator is given by af equal lambda z plus c f prime, where c is equal to zero in case two, okay, and in this case tt. So c phi t converges enorm as t and to infinity if not, if lambda is in c minus and it converges in norm to t, the function which is the evaluation at minus c. So this is an obvious consequence of the discrete case.
00:48:16.374 - 00:50:26.854, Speaker B: So the only thing to do is to check that in order to get a semi flow in the family of function of the form a z plus b that you have just both cases. So it's not very difficult. And to conclude. So the proof is just obvious from what I mentioned previously. I would just conclude this talk with an application of the result already mentioned several times by Eddie Bernard and also by Polgong concerning the semi groups generated by a generator which has a special form. So what we get is that every c zero semigroup, well, I just restrict myself to the Fox spaces, which is a Gibbert space. So every c zero semicrooked on f two with generator of the form af equals certain function f g f prime for some g an entire function.
00:50:26.854 - 00:53:13.794, Speaker B: So every c zero semicolon f two with such generator is automatically a semicolon composition operator. The g has the form a z plus b with the real part of a and negative or j equal to a z, where a is pure imaginary complex numbers, complex number. And moreover, we can get another characterization of generators of semi flow generated c zero semicolon composition. So it happens that g has the form a z plus b with the real part of a negative, or if b is nonzero, or a in r and b equal to zero if and only if, and we will recover a result we have found in a joint work with Corentin, Licou and Jonathan. It's equivalent to say that the limit, when the modulus of z tends to infinity of the real part of z bar g is not positive. So you recover exactly the same kind of criteria, which was the characterization of, um, generator of semi flow on the unit disk. But here it's on the whole complex plane, and you see that you tend to the boundary.
00:53:13.794 - 00:53:31.344, Speaker B: But in this case. So what is the. The analog of Baxton and portal result? It's even much more simple because the. The semi flow are. There are just a few in this case. Okay. So I conclude with that.
00:53:31.344 - 00:53:33.624, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
00:53:34.924 - 00:54:03.614, Speaker A: Thank you indeed. Isabel. Let's thank the speaker first. Wonderful series of talks. Any question or comments for Isabel? Indeed, I have just. I mean, in the previous page, I think it was in the previous one, you emphasized that lambda should not be one, and I couldn't see one more, please. Yeah.
00:54:03.614 - 00:54:12.054, Speaker A: And you take the limit. It's just before this theorem.
00:54:12.354 - 00:54:16.134, Speaker B: Okay, sorry, I.
00:54:19.394 - 00:54:23.094, Speaker A: You emphasize that. Yeah, here it is.
00:54:23.554 - 00:54:24.294, Speaker B: Why.
00:54:24.874 - 00:54:37.224, Speaker A: I don't see why lambda nutrition, being equal to one, plays a role here. Are you. Because you get f equal to f. Okay. Okay.
00:54:37.384 - 00:54:42.804, Speaker B: Yeah. There is no contradiction if lambda is equal to one. But otherwise, you have a problem.
00:54:45.624 - 00:55:00.264, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. See it now. Thank you. Any further comments or questions for Isabel? If not, let's thank her again.
00:55:01.924 - 00:55:02.820, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:55:02.972 - 00:55:09.164, Speaker A: Thank you. And as before, we appreciate if you share it on, please.
