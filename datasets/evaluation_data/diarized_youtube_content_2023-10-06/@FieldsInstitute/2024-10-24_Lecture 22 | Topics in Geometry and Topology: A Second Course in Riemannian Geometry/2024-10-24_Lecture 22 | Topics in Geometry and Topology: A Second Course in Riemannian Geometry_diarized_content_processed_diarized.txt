00:00:00.400 - 00:00:35.521, Speaker A: Okay, so. So this is the third to last lecture, right? We have today, we have Wednesday, and we have next Monday, and then we're done. I just wanted to give one more corollary about the Morse Index Theorem, which I didn't get time to do last week. Then we're going to start chapter 12 on Priceman's theorem, which tells you something about the fundamental group of a compact manifold with strictly negative sectional curvature. And that's all we'll have time for, although we've done a lot, I think, in this course. So let me remind you what the Moore's Index Theorem was. We proved it last time.
00:00:35.521 - 00:01:28.679, Speaker A: If we have a geodesic on our Riemannian manifold, then we get the index form of the geodesic, which is a quadratic form, or equivalently a symmetric bilinear form on the space of piecewise smooth vector fields along Gamma which vanish at the endpoints. And then that symmetric bilinear form could have an index if it has a maximal negative definite subspace. And the theorem says that it does have a finite index, and that index is equal to the sum counted with multiplicities of all the interior conjugate points. So here's Gamma of zero, gamma of A. If there's any conjugate points to Gamma of zero in the interior, they'll have some multiplicity. The sum of those points counted with their multiplicities is the index of this bilinear form. So corollary, which is really just a rewriting, a rewriting of this thing, it says the following.
00:01:28.679 - 00:03:08.839, Speaker A: This is called the Jacobi Theorem. So let Gamma be a geodesic and suppose Gamma of A is not conjugate to Gamma of zero. So if there are any conjugate points, they have to be in the interior. Then Gamma has no conjugate points on 0a if and only if for all proper variations, Gamma S of Gamma with energy function E, there exists some delta positive such that E of S is greater than or equal to e of 0 for all s and minus delta to delta. Okay? In particular, if Gamma is minimizing, then Gamma has no conjugate points on 0a. So before I explain how this is. Where's my chart? This is just a rewriting of the Morse Index theorem.
00:03:08.839 - 00:04:33.051, Speaker A: It's worth pointing out because I've been trying to do that all term when Doc does things that are non standard or incorrect or just lacking in details for some reason in docarmo instead of writing this, he writes E of S less than E of delta, which is clearly A typo. This makes no sense at all. Okay, so if you're reading the textbook, just be aware this is an obvious mistake. Okay, so why is, why is this true? This is just as I said, rephrasing the index theorem. So by the Morse index theorem, Gamma has no conjugate points on in the interior if and only if the index of I A is zero. That's exactly what it says. So there does not exist any negative definite subspace of this script V, which was the piecewise smooth vector fields that vanish on the endpoints.
00:04:33.051 - 00:05:43.805, Speaker A: I guess strictly speaking any non 0, because by the definition of negative definite, the 0 subspace is both positive and negative definite for any bilinear form because there are no zero vectors in it. Also, since gamma of A is not conjugate to gamma of zero, there's no radical. The radical of IA is also zero, right? Because remember we one of the preliminary steps in proving the Mohr's index theorem, we showed that the radical was exactly equal to the Jacobi fields, right? So, and that means conjugate. That means gamma of A would be conjugate, right? So since gamma is not conjugate, there are no Jacobi fields on gamma. So there are no Jacobi fields which non trivial Jacobi fields which vanish at the endpoints, which exactly means that the radical of IA on V is zero. So then we claim that. So this A and B.
00:05:43.805 - 00:06:45.929, Speaker A: So B is immediate because of our assumption that gamma of A is not conjugate to gamma 0 and A then is now equivalent to the index being zero to the having no conjugate points. So A and B implies that I A is positive definite on V. So we essentially did this in the course of proving the index theorem. But I think it's worth doing again because it's just a few lines and it's more general than what I did last time. So since there exists no negative definite subspace for all V in script V, I A of V has to be greater than or equal to zero. So here's the proof of the claim. Okay, well then we want to show that I A of V equals zero implies V equals zero, right? That would tell us that it's positive definite because we know it's always non negative.
00:06:45.929 - 00:07:14.775, Speaker A: And if the only time you get zero is if you put in zero, then you're done. Well, we can compute this is equal to I A of V plus 2 lambda IA of VW. So I'm abusing notation. Maybe I shouldn't be doing that. Let's. I'm identifying that the quadratic form and the bilinear form. But I shouldn't do that.
00:07:14.775 - 00:08:17.765, Speaker A: V + lambda w VV okay, so this is greater than or equal to zero because this is true for all vectors because there's no negative definite sum space. And this is zero. And therefore, as in last class, this is for all lambda. The only way that this will be non negative for all lambda is if I a vw equals zero. But then V is in the radical and that means that V is zero because there's no radical. So the this is a linear algebra result says if you have a symmetric bilinear form on some vector space, even if that vector space is infinite dimensional, if you know the radical is trivial, and you know there's no vector that you can plug in there into the quadratic form and get something negative, then it has to be positive, definitely. Okay, so that's the proof of the claim.
00:08:17.765 - 00:09:38.395, Speaker A: But then, so hence no conjugate points on the interior is equivalent to IA is positive, definitely. But then that's exactly what this corollary is saying for us, right? That what is IA is the second derivative. So I, E double prime at zero is positive definite for any variation gamma s of gamma with energy E. So gamma, so s equals 0 is a local min of E, and that implies that E of S is greater than or equal to e of 0 for all s close enough to zero. Yep. Where did I. That does not exist.
00:09:38.395 - 00:11:13.275, Speaker A: Does not exist any non zero negative. That's what it means for the index to be zero. There's no non zero vector in script V that you plug into the quadratic form and get something negative. Okay, so that proves that proves this right in particular, so having no conjugate if you if A is Gamma is not conjugate to gamma zero, then having no interior conjugate points is equivalent to every variation of gamma. Every proper variation of Gamma as it gives you a local Gamma is a local minimum for every proper variation, right? So if Gamma is minimizing, then of course gamma is a global minimum for the for the energy and therefore it satisfies, then it's a local minimum and therefore there's no conjugate points. So in particular, if Gamma is minimizing, then E has a local min at s equals 0 for any gamma s variation, proper variation. So, so the index equals zero.
00:11:13.275 - 00:12:34.305, Speaker A: So there's no conjugate points, there's no interior conjugate points. Okay? And the corollary of the corollary, which is just the contrapositive, the geodesic Gamma, let me just say call it Gamma is never minimizing past its first conjugate point. And the, and this is the contra positive of the previous, right? Because if there was a conjugate point, I mean if it is minimizing, there are no interior conjugate points. So if there is an interior conjugate point and you go past it, then it can't be minimizing. So assignment four, question one is this, right, but you're not going to prove it like this. This is. There's a direct proof of this.
00:12:34.305 - 00:13:16.645, Speaker A: I walk you through it, right? I give you all the hints on how to do it. And this is our long winded way of getting the same result as assignment for question one. But of course the Morse index theorem gives us much more. And then the other corollary of the index theorem which I did do last time, was that the set of con. This was a corollary of the proof, not of the statement the set of conjugate points along a geodesic is discrete and therefore finite. So I did that last time. All right, any questions before we change gears completely? Yeah, 0a.
00:13:16.645 - 00:14:08.685, Speaker A: I mean I'm being, you know, the conjugate points are on the geodesic. That means gamma of T is not conjugate to gamma of zero for any t in the open interval. All right, so we are moving on to chapter 12, which is the last thing we're going to do. And as I said, this is a result about the fundamental group of a compact manifold with negative curvature. It's called Priceman's theorem. But before we actually get to that, we're not going to get to that till Wednesday. We're going to need some preliminary results which are actually pretty general.
00:14:08.685 - 00:15:18.625, Speaker A: This is chapter 12, the fundamental group of compact Riemannian manifolds with negative curvature. I'll tell you what the theorem says today in a few minutes, but we won't get to the actual statement improved till Wednesday. So let's set it up. So suppose I'm going to start out more generally, right? We eventually we're going to look at just compact and we know compact is always complete, right? But for now let's just assume it's complete but not necessarily compact. So suppose MNG is complete with negative sectional curvature and not constant. Could be, but it doesn't have to be constant. It's just that for every point in M and any two plane, any two dimensional subspace of the tangent plane, the sectional curvature at that point in the direction of that two plane is negative.
00:15:18.625 - 00:16:43.601, Speaker A: Then the Universal cover M tilde of M equipped with the covering metric G tilde, which is PI star of G is simply connected. That's what the universal cover means, right? This is some fact from algebraic topology that every manifold is more general than that. But every smooth manifold has a universal cover unique up to diffeomorphism, up to homeomorphism, which is simply connected. Simply connected and is simply connected. And the metric is complete with sectional curvature, K tilde negative and PI from M tilde to M is a local isometry. These are just facts that we've used before, especially on assignment three. There was a lot to do with this universal cover and the covering metric.
00:16:43.601 - 00:17:13.499, Speaker A: So that this was a. This was a big deal, right? In problem in Assignment 3, that if you do have a covering map, then so this is. This is a covering map. Then pulling back a complete metric by a covering map gives you a complete metric. And because this is the universal cover, this is simply connected. And the covering map is always a local isometry. By the way we defined G tilde and Y is the and because it's a local isometry.
00:17:13.499 - 00:18:25.269, Speaker A: That's why K tilde is also negative if K is negative. Okay? Hence, by the Cartan Hadamard theorem, M tilde is diffeomorphic to rn. In fact, all we needed was k less than or equal to zero for that. In fact, this only needs k less than or equal to zero, right? We proved the Carton Hadamard theorem says if you have a complete Riemannian manifold with non positive sectional curvature, then it's diffeomorphic to rn. Okay, so what we want to do in this chapter is we want to study PI1 of M, the fundamental group. That's the. It's a group and it's defined as the equivalence classes of homotopy closed closed loops centered at some point.
00:18:25.269 - 00:19:05.245, Speaker A: Right? Really, strictly speaking, I should be talking about PI 1 of m p, where p is some fixed point in M. All our manifolds have been connected for like half a term. Now we're only going to be thinking about connected manifolds. PI 1 of PM. This is the equivalence classes or homotopy classes of loops at P. That means continuous paths that start and end at P. And you can define what it means for two such continuous loops at P to be homotopic.
00:19:05.245 - 00:19:40.275, Speaker A: And that gives you an equivalence relation. And you can show that the set of equivalence class has a group structure. By concatenating loops you get another loop and the homotopia of the concatenation, sorry, the IF2. So you've hopefully seen this. And if you haven't, it doesn't matter. If Gamma is an equivalence class of loops, let's call them G, G1, concatenate G2 that's equal to the concatenate, the equivalence class of the concatenation, et cetera. Okay, this is something you, you see in a topology class.
00:19:40.275 - 00:20:33.645, Speaker A: So why do we want to study this? So, so I'm saying equal, right? You define this. For every point P and M, you define this. And if M is connected, then all of these guys are isomorphic to each other as groups, but not canonically. You have to pick a path from P to Q and get your isomorphism. And that isomorphism depends on the path. So here's a fact. If the universal cover of M is Rn, which it is here, so let me say of a manifold M, which it is here, then all the higher homotopia groups are trivial.
00:20:33.645 - 00:21:18.905, Speaker A: So pik of M is 0 for K at least 2. So you either know what higher homotopia groups are or you don't. If you don't, you can ignore this. Don't ask me why this is true, because I've never seen why this is true. This is. In fact, we usually say 0 here instead of 1 because the higher homotopia groups, unlike the fundamental group, they're abelian. You should think of these as equivalent homotopy classes of continuous maps from the k sphere into M, because these are really homotopy classes of continuous maps from the one sphere S1 into M.
00:21:18.905 - 00:22:21.335, Speaker A: And it's not obvious that these have to be abelian, and these are very hard to understand. But in this case, when our manifold is complete with negative sectional curvature, then it is covered universally covered by Rn, so it doesn't have any higher homotopia groups. So all the homotopy theoretic home homotopy theoretic information in this case is contained in Pi1, right? Because it's connected. So Pi0 is trivial. Pi1 is the only one that could be non trivial. Of course, that's not all the topological information, because you can have such manifolds with with non trivial homology or cohomology. It's just the homotopy theoretic information.
00:22:21.335 - 00:24:16.933, Speaker A: Okay, so what we'll prove on Monday, on Wednesday, next time. Priceman's theorem. If Mg is compact with negative curvature, so it's exactly this situation we have here, except I'm adding the compactness assumption, which is stronger than completeness, then every non trivial subgroup of PI 1 non trivial means I E not equal to the trivial subgroup or the whole thing is infinite cyclic. There'll be a bit of group theory in the last three lectures of the course. So that's what we're going to prove. So an example if we take t3, which is the three torus, then something you learn in algebraic topology is that pi1 is z plus z plus z. Okay? And now there definitely exists subgroups of here of this group which are not, you know, trivial, which are not infinite cyclic.
00:24:16.933 - 00:25:09.381, Speaker A: Because I can take that, right? I can take any two of these. That gives me a non trivial subgroup which is not infinite cyclic. So T3 does not admit any metric of negative curvature, right? T3 is compact. So any Riemannian metric on there will be complete. And if it, if it was strictly negative curvature everywhere, then by Priceman's theorem you couldn't have a non trivial subgroup of the fundamental group which was not infinite cyclic. But since you do, there is no metric of negative curvature. That means if you put any riemannian metric on T3, there has to be at least one point where the sectional curvature is either 0 or positive.
00:25:09.381 - 00:26:47.865, Speaker A: So if G is any metric on T3, there exists a P in M and an Lp two dimensional subspace of TPM such that K of Lp is either 0 or positive. That's a consequence. We're also going to prove a very similar result. So we'll also prove if mg is compact and k negative, then pi1 is not abelian. So in particular, so tn for n bigger than 1 has no metric of negative curvature because pi1 tn is z is abelian. N copies. Wait, why did I.
00:26:47.865 - 00:27:31.539, Speaker A: I don't need to make n bigger than one. Okay, so any torus, in fact any metric on torus has to have at least the point N&A2 plane where the sectional curvature is non negative. Of course on T1 we know it's flat. Any Riemannian one manifold is flat. Was there a question? Virtual? Yeah. Do you have any examples of compact manifolds with negative curvature that are kind of easy to visualize? I do not. The question is do I have any examples of manifolds, compact manifolds with negative curvature that are easy to visualize? I don't, but let me think about it and I'll tell you next time, right, because we don't.
00:27:31.539 - 00:28:06.395, Speaker A: Remember we proved Myers theorem that says if the curvature was positive everywhere, then it had to be compact. But that wasn't an if and only if, right? Just because you're reminding manifolds compact doesn't mean the curvature has to be positive everywhere. There do exist compact manifolds with sectional curvature negative everywhere. But right now I don't know the answer to that. So, so let me get back to you. Pseudosphere is not compact. Yeah, there's lots of easy examples, like hyperbolic space has constant negative sectional curvature, but it's not compact.
00:28:06.395 - 00:28:56.073, Speaker A: Okay? And then if time permits, on Monday of next week, we'll prove Buyer's Theorem, not to be confused with Myers Buyer's Theorem, which is a refinement of Priceman. It says again, with the same hypotheses as Priceman's theorem. I might have spelled it wrong, that in fact, it's not just that it has to be infinite, cyclical. You learn more about it involving solvable subgroups and normal subgroups. And so I'll state it on Monday when we get to it. I think we'll have time to get there and then we'll stop. We'll stop there.
00:28:56.073 - 00:30:03.791, Speaker A: So. But first, we're not going to do any of that today. So first we need a general theorem, again due to Cartan, about existence of closed geodesics in a compact Romanian manifold. Okay? So first I have to tell you what does it mean to have a closed geodesic before we state the theorem? Actually, I'm not going to do that yet. We need to, we need to talk a little bit. Maybe I can do that first. Okay, now let me.
00:30:03.791 - 00:31:08.685, Speaker A: Let me do this. So before we do that, we need to understand a little bit about this isomorphism between the fundamental group and the group of dec transformations of the universal cover. So I'm going to just tell you some facts from algebraic topology which we're going to use. But I don't know if we're going to get to them today, but we should go over them right now. So, okay, so mg complete M tilde, G tilde, the universal cover with the covering metric. So G tilde is PI star G and PI is a local is the covering map and a local isometry. We said all this before.
00:31:08.685 - 00:31:48.815, Speaker A: So let's let A of M tilde be the group of dec transformations. He calls them covering transformations. Most authors call them deck transformations of this covering. So it's the. It's the group of all diffeomorphisms. Diffeomorphisms such that PI compose F equals PI. Okay? That means that it takes the sheets of the covering to themselves.
00:31:48.815 - 00:32:26.695, Speaker A: I mean, sorry, not to themselves. It interchanges the sheets of the covering. And here's a fact. If F is in A of M tilde, then F is an isometry. We already did this many weeks ago. And you can see that from here, just by taking the pullback on G of both of these things. And moreover, if F is not the identity, then F has no fixed points.
00:32:26.695 - 00:33:39.715, Speaker A: So this is a fact about DEC transformations, right? There's the identity, of course, and every other DEC transformation has no fixed point transformations. And there exists an isomorphism from this group of deck transformations of the Universal cover with PI 1 with the fundamental group of the manifold. And it's not canonical, but it is going to be important for us how it's how it's defined. So I'm going to tell you how this isomorphism is defined. And you know, you can just believe that it's an isomorphism or you can check the details yourself, because you know, this is. That would be just a bunch of algebraic topology. So as this isomorphism is defined as follows, choose a point P tilde in PI inverse of P.
00:33:39.715 - 00:35:01.157, Speaker A: So P tilde is in M tilde and PI of P tilde is P, right? So first of all, I'm identifying this group of DEC transformations with the fundamental group at a particular point, right? If I chose some other point P prime, you know, there would be a different isomorphism, but not only that, the isomorphism depends on the choice of a P tilde lying above P. So this is a picture of M tilde, and this is a picture of M. So given an equivalence class in Pi1, this is a homotopy class of loops at P. We associate a map a DEC transformation alpha, which depends on. It depends on this P tilde that I chose, right? And now it's going to be a map. G goes to alpha P tilde G. So this is in pi1 of mp, and this is going to be in A of M tilde.
00:35:01.157 - 00:36:02.885, Speaker A: So I have to define what this map is. So this is in A of M tilde by as follows. So let Q tilde be a point in M tilde. I have to say where it goes. Okay? Choose a path sigma tilde in M tilde from Q tilde to P tilde. Then sigma, which is PI composed Sigma tilde is a path in M from Q to P. So Q is PI of Q tilde.
00:36:02.885 - 00:36:40.005, Speaker A: And this of course is PI of P tilde. So I have Q and this is sigma. And I have, remember, G is my loop. This is a representative for that loop. It doesn't matter which one you choose. Let beta be first you follow sigma, then you follow G and then you follow sigma inverse. This is a loop at Q.
00:36:40.005 - 00:37:06.851, Speaker A: So I'm this is Concatenation of paths. Concatenation of paths. And a lot of algebraic topologists will write concatenation of paths. The first one is on the left and then on the right. And then you go like that. That just psychologically disturbs me because I'm thinking of whatever comes first should be on the right. But anyway, it means you follow sigma, then you follow G and then you go sigma backwards to Q.
00:37:06.851 - 00:38:26.025, Speaker A: That's a loop on key on Q a Q. And then since PI is a covering map, there exists a unique lift, beta tilde Q tilde of beta starting at Q tilde, right? If I take this thing now, is beta tilde going here, Beta is going here and then around and then back. If I have any path downstairs, doesn't have to be a loop, but any path downstairs, and I pick a point above the initial point of my path, then because it's a covering map, there will be a unique lift of that map starting at that point, at that point. But it doesn't have to end at this point, right? Just because I lift a loop doesn't mean it ends at a loop. So then we define. I'll go over here because I have more trace. We define a, sorry, alpha G P tilde of Q tilde to be the final point, final point of the lift.
00:38:26.025 - 00:39:22.545, Speaker A: So I've parameterized all these paths on 01, okay? So I have this beta is that guy. And this lifts to beta tilde and it ends beta tilde Q tilde. So beta tilde Q tilde of one is by definition alpha G P tilde of Q tilde. Okay? So there's so many things you have to check here. You have to check that everything is independent of the choices, right? The representatives. So if, if, if you had some other path homotopic, and you know, all this, all this G, I picked a representative. So there's a lot of things to check here and that this is an isomorphism.
00:39:22.545 - 00:40:28.485, Speaker A: So this exercise, or just read it or just believe it, this is well defined and gives an isomorphism, so morphism between PI 1 of m base that P and the dec transformations of M tilde. So as I said, like we're going to need this formula either later today or early on Wednesday. But if you're just willing to believe this algebraic topology, then you don't have to sweat out the details, right? This is all we're going to need. And just as a observation, if Q tilde equals P tilde, if I want to apply this map alpha GP tilde to P tilde itself, we can take sigma to be the constant path. We can take sigma. Tilde is the constant path. And that means that sigma is the constant path.
00:40:28.485 - 00:41:28.537, Speaker A: And that means that beta is just G. And that means that alpha G P tilde applied to P tilde is just G tilde Q tilde of one. Okay, so in this case, if I want to see where this point goes, if I want to see where this point goes by this dec transformation, alpha P tilde of G, I take my loop G and I lift it. There's going to be a unique lift starting at P tilde, and it doesn't have to end at P tilde. And this is going to be alpha G. P tilde of P tilde is just GP tilde of one. Okay, so that also is gonna, is gonna show up when we apply this fact.
00:41:28.537 - 00:42:12.273, Speaker A: We're gonna end up showing the two dec transformations are the same. And the way we're gonna do that is we're gonna be able to show, use this formula on one side and this formula on the other side and show that they, they both map one particular point to the same point. And therefore, if you do one and then the inverse of the other, it has a fixed point, and therefore that's the identity. And therefore they're equal. Okay, So I will remind you of these formulas when we use it. I think we'll get to it today, but if we don't, it'll be the first thing on Wednesday. Okay, so now we're almost ready for the existence theorem on closed geodesics.
00:42:12.273 - 00:43:42.047, Speaker A: But we need a definition, a set L of closed paths. Continuous paths in M is called a free homotopy class if it is an equivalence class with respect to free homotopia of closed paths. So what does that mean? So if I have that is, if F and G are two closed paths in M. So that just means they're continuous. This is all, this is all topology. There's no geometry or smooth manifold theory here. They're continuous and closed means that, you know, they end and start at the same point.
00:43:42.047 - 00:45:47.225, Speaker A: But these two, the initial and final point of F is the same and the initial final point of G is the same, but they don't have to be the same as each other. Then we say F and G are freely homotopic if there exists h from 01 times 01 to m continuous such that h of 0 t is f of t, h of 1 of t is g of t and h of s 0 equals h of s 1 for all t and S. Okay, so this says that it's a homotopy from F to G. But all the intermediate curves are closed curves. But the endpoints could be moving, right, and that has to be the case if the, if this point and this point are not the same, there's no way you can homotope them one to the other with the same fixed endpoints. So that is H S dot 01 to M is a closed path in M for all S. Okay? So under a free homotopy, the end point or the origin HS0, which is equal to HS1, is allowed to vary with S.
00:45:47.225 - 00:47:12.967, Speaker A: Okay? So the picture this could be f, f of 0 equals f of 1, and then g of 0 equals g of 1 and we get a smoothly varying family. I don't know how I'm going to draw it, but it might go like that. Eventually gets to G. Okay, and one more fact about this free homotopy class, which is almost obvious, but again, I'll leave it for you. So here's a fact. Free homotopy classes of closed paths are or correspond to conjugacy classes in I1 of MP or any P. Okay? So in other words, you know, you can look at, this is a group, right? So it has conjugacy classes.
00:47:12.967 - 00:48:18.155, Speaker A: Every point in here, you know, will be. Will determine a conjugacy class where two points are in the same conjugacy class if there's a. If there's an element in the group which conjugates one to the other. And so a conjugacy class in pi1 corresponds to a free homotopy class of closed paths and vice versa. Okay? So in particular, if PI 1 of m is not trivial, then there exists a non trivial free homotopy class cell, right? Because remember, for a group the identity is in is is the only element in its conjugacy class. Because if you're conjugate to the identity, you're the identity. And then if you're going to have anything else in pi1, if it's not the trivial group, it will live in some conjugacy class and an element, a non identity element, will live in some conjugacy class which is not the trivial conjugacy class.
00:48:18.155 - 00:49:30.077, Speaker A: So there's going to be a non trivial free homotopia class. This is how we're going to use it, right? Because we're going to want to say, well, you'll see now we're going to, we're going to want to understand something about the fundamental group, but we're going to get information about non trivial free homotopy classes. Okay, so one more definition. Now let mg be Riemannian. A closed geodesic on M is a smooth immersion gamma from S1 to M such that gamma is a geodesic at each. Let's see. Gamma such that gamma is locally a geodesic.
00:49:30.077 - 00:50:58.105, Speaker A: So what do I mean, I don't want to be too worthy. The S1 is a one dimensional manifold, right? So I can cover it, in fact, I can cover it by two charts, the domains of which are open intervals. Okay? So if I'm saying that if I restrict gamma to any, in fact all I need to do is pull out one point from S1 and then that's diffeomorphic to an open interval, right? So if I remove any one point from S1 and restrict gamma to that open interval, it's a geodesic. We know what that means. Okay, and, but it's a smooth immersion from the sphere. So in particular, so not only is gamma of, well, or let me say equivalently, equivalently gamma corresponds to, I mean, let me just say like this. We can think of a closed geodesic as a geodesic gamma on into M such that not only, you know, does it come back to where it started from, but gamma prime of zero is call that thing P is equal to Gamma prime of 1 in TP of M.
00:50:58.105 - 00:51:40.635, Speaker A: So this is the additional condition. And this, this is equivalent to thinking of it as a smooth immersion from the circle into M, right? So it's not just a loop, a piecewise smooth thing that could have a sharp turn when it comes back to the, to the starting point. It has to do it in a C one way. So I'll draw a picture. So here's our manifold M. Let's put some holes in it, maybe. So this is the manifold.
00:51:40.635 - 00:53:01.205, Speaker A: If we have a smooth immersion of the circle, that means it's going to close up on itself and the velocity vectors are also going to smoothly close up on itself. So this could be gamma of 0 equals gamma of 1 and gamma prime of 0 equals gamma prime of 1 and it's a geodesic everywhere that's a closed geodesic. You could also have something that looks like this, right? Here's a, here's a situation where gamma of 0 equals gamma of 1. But gamma prime of 0 is not equal to gamma prime of 1. This is called a geodesic lasso, right? So it's a, it's a closed curve piecewise. Well, it's. If It's a geodesic on 01, we know it's going to be a smooth curve, but there's no reason for the velocity that's at the end at time 1 to be the same as the velocity at time 0, even though they're in the same tangent space.
00:53:01.205 - 00:53:52.543, Speaker A: So there do exist things like that. Okay, but we're not going to care about these guys. We're going to care about these closed geodesics. And in fact, if you've been working on assignment four, problem four, I think it's problem four is about, or maybe three, Problem three is about these closed geodesics. Okay, so now we're ready for the main result of today. So we're going to need this as a tool to prove Priceman's theorem on Wednesday. But this is a very general result and it's actually gives you a bit of a flavor of geometric analysis.
00:53:52.543 - 00:54:43.495, Speaker A: Because we want to solve, we want to find some object with certain properties. And the way we do it is we show that we can find an object with potentially less properties in a relatively easy way using methods of analysis. And then we work hard to show that the thing we found actually has more properties than it seemed to have. Okay, so here's a theorem. This is Carton, Carton's theorem on existence of closed geodesics. So it's the following. Let MG be compact.
00:54:43.495 - 00:56:45.071, Speaker A: So I'll point out exactly where we need the compactness in the proof, because document doesn't, it doesn't say it. Let L be a non trivial free homotopy class in free homotopy class of closed paths in M. So there's no way you'll have a non trivial free homotopy class if the thing is simply connected, right? So we need pi1 of m, non trivial necessarily. And if it is, if it is non trivial, there will be non trivial free homotopy classes. Then there exists a closed geodesic in M, okay? So we can find exactly one of these, sorry, in L, In L it's clear that this thing can't be, must be non constant, right? So it must be non constant because the constant curve trivially satisfies the definition of a closed geodesic, right? But the constant curve is in the equivalence class of the identity in the fundamental group, right? So it wouldn't be in L because L is a non trivial free homotopy class. So it says, essentially it says if your manifold has some holes in it, compact Riemannian manifold. Then if I choose, for example, this guy which is not homotopic to zero, right? Then it defines, it's a representative of some non trivial free homotopy class.
00:56:45.071 - 00:57:27.965, Speaker A: I look at all the loops freely homotopic to this one. There's going to be one in that class which is a closed geodesic. So in particular, if it's a geodesic, it's going to be smooth. Right? And these guys are all just continuous. Okay, so how are we going to do this? Well, as I said, we're going to construct it in a sort of relatively easy way using analysis. We're going to construct a sort of candidate curve and then we're going to have to prove that that curve actually is the one we want is, does have the properties we want. This is not, not necessarily unique.
00:57:27.965 - 00:58:23.409, Speaker A: Okay, I can do it. Okay, so let's let D be the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves. In fact, I can make them continuous. It doesn't matter smooth curves in the class L. Okay, so we know L is a non trivial class. It's not empty, right? There's some, there's some closed continuous paths in there, and I can always then approximate them if I want by piecewise smooth paths. The lengths are always non negative of any curve.
00:58:23.409 - 00:59:09.541, Speaker A: So this is a non empty set of non negative real numbers. So the infimum exists. D is greater than or equal to zero. Since M is compact, this is where we use it. Documo doesn't really mention it. There exists delta positive such that every point P and M lies in a totally normal neighborhood W delta. Okay, so because I can put, I can certainly put every point lies in the in in a totally normal neighborhood.
00:59:09.541 - 01:00:49.905, Speaker A: By compactness, I can cover it by finitely many and I can just take the minimum of all those deltas and it'll be positive. So hence this implies that D is positive. So why? Because if D is 0, then there exists some closed some piecewise smooth path, let's say alpha in this class L closed path with the length of alpha less than delta, this delta here. But that means that alpha is contained in a geodesic ball. That means that alpha is homotopically trivial. But that's a contradiction because alpha is in this non trivial free homotopy class, right? The only homotopically trivial closed paths are going to be in the trivial free homotopy class, the one of the constant path. Okay, so this is where we use the compactness to argue that D is positive.
01:00:49.905 - 01:01:57.415, Speaker A: And we're going to see where we use the fact that D is positive in a few minutes. And in fact it's important to remember this, because after we do the proof, I'll show you an example where the theorem fails in the non compact case without going through the details. And it's exactly because this infimum is 0 in the non compact case. Okay, so now let gamma K be a sequence of piecewise smooth closed paths in L such that the length of gamma K goes to D as K goes to infinity. Now of course I can do that because of the definition of d was the infimum of all these lengths. So if the infimum is D, that means there's a sequence in this set whose lengths go to D. So this is by definition of D.
01:01:57.415 - 01:02:56.525, Speaker A: And remember, we've shown D is positive. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that each gamma K is a broken geodesic on 01 parameterized by arc, parameterized proportionately to arc length. So why can we do this? We've done this before. I can cover my. If gamma K is not like this, I can cover gamma K by finitely many totally normal neighborhoods. And I can, I can replace. I can, I can just choose points in these intersections and I can replace.
01:02:56.525 - 01:04:02.465, Speaker A: Because this lies the totally normal neighborhood, there's going to be a unique minimizing geodesic, right? So I can replace each of the these segments by minimizing geodesic. Then it's a broken geodesic, right? So there's a finite collection of geodesics there that are attached at points where it might jump in the velocity. And the length can only decrease if I do that. So that's even better. What do I want? I know the lengths are always at least D, and I know they're going to D, right? So if I, if for each K, I replace it by one of these broken geodesics, the length is still going to be at least D and it's going to only get below. So by the squeeze theorem, these new gamma K's, which I'm still going to call gamma K, well are still going to go to D. And of course, since it's a broken geodesic at each point the velocity is constant, I can just reparameterize it proportionally to arc length so that it's, it's in its domain is the closed zero one.
01:04:02.465 - 01:04:49.295, Speaker A: So that's fine. Now let's let L be the supremum overall K of the length of gamma K. Certainly this is finite because these gamma K's are going to D. And so it's a convergence sequence that's bounded right. The length of gamma K's are going to D. And this is equal to the supremum over k of gamma K prime. Right? These all have constant speed.
01:04:49.295 - 01:05:42.715, Speaker A: That's right, because I parameterized them proportionally to arc length. Right? So the speed is constant. So for each K, this guy, this gamma K has a constant speed and the speed is equal to the length because the length of gamma K is equal to the integral from 0 to 1 gamma K prime of T DT. But this is constant, so it's just equal to gamma K prime. Okay, so length is equal to the speed. Now let T1 be less than or equal to T2 in. And let's look at the distance from Gamma K of T1 to Gamma K of T2.
01:05:42.715 - 01:06:44.405, Speaker A: Well, the distance between these two points is going to be less than or equal to the length of any curve joining those two points. And Gamma K certainly joins Gamma KT1 to Gamma KT2. So it's going to be less than or equal to the integral from T1 to T2 gamma K prime T DT. But this is less than or equal to L. So this is less than or equal to l times t2 minus t1. But what does that say? Hence, the set of maps gamma K for K in N is equi continuous because I showed that they're in fact all Lipschitz with the same Lipschitz Constant L times T2 minus T1. L is a number.
01:06:44.405 - 01:08:14.596, Speaker A: Okay? And then since M is compact again, we're using compactness here. A version of the Arzella Ascoli theorem says that there exists a subsequence which I'll still denote gamma K, which converges uniformly to a closed continuous path gamma zero from zero one to m. So there's various versions of the Arzella Ascoli theorem. They all require, you know, this family of maps to be equal, continuous. And then you need some more stuff, some compactness here. I'm looking at maps into a compact metric, from a compact metric space to a compact metric space, and there is a version of Azela Scoli you can look up that works here. So after passing to a subsequence, which I'll just relabel to be gamma K, we can assume that gamma K converges uniformly to gamma 0.
01:08:14.596 - 01:09:04.731, Speaker A: Moreover, gamma 0 is in the same free homotopy class, so you can check that the free homotopies converge. So what am I saying? Basically, each got each one of these is in the same free homotopy class. So you can pick a single representative in there, and they're all Free gamma K's are all freely homotopic to some reference loop. And if the Gamma Ks are converging uniformly, you can show that the free homotopies will converge uniformly. So this guy is in the same homotopy class, but now it's no longer nice and smooth. Right? Just a continuous map. Let's.
01:09:04.731 - 01:10:39.859, Speaker A: Let's subdivide, as we've done many times this via partition, such that Gamma zero restricted to TK minus one up to TK is contained in a totally normal neighborhood for each k. So it'll be a different one for different k's. It's the same picture I have down there. And let Gamma be the piecewise smooth closed curve such that Gamma restricted to Tk minus 1 Tk is the unique minimizing geodesic from gamma of Tk minus 1 to gamma Tk for all K. So again we had our gamma zero. And then we cover it and we take. We take minimizing geodesic.
01:10:39.859 - 01:11:09.245, Speaker A: So then we can. We can ensure that. So Gamma would be a piecewise smooth broken geodesic. It's clear that Gamma is in L also. Right? Because if Gamma naught is in L, then this curve is obviously freely homotopic to gamma naught. So it's in the same homotopy class. So the length of Gamma is at least D.
01:11:09.245 - 01:11:20.905, Speaker A: We're going to show that this is the one we want. We're going to show that the length of Gamma equals D and that it's. That it's a geodesic, a closed geodesic. Right. Sorry. It's close. These pictures are bad.
01:11:20.905 - 01:11:39.827, Speaker A: Right. Should be coming back. It's closed. Gamma is a broken geodesic, its length at least D. We're going to show two things. That the length equals D and that. That it's a closed geodesic.
01:11:39.827 - 01:12:29.303, Speaker A: And then we'll be done. Okay, so suppose that the length of Gamma is bigger than D. Well, then let epsilon be the length of gamma minus D over 2k plus 2n plus 1. This is. This is n here. And that's positive. There exists some k natural number such that the length of Gamma k minus D is less than epsilon.
01:12:29.303 - 01:13:28.679, Speaker A: Because remember, the lengths are all above D and they're going to D. So eventually, as long as you go far enough out, the length of Gamma K minus D will be as small as we want. And the distance from gamma K of t to gamma 0 of t is less than epsilon for all T in. And that's by the uniform convergence of the Gamma K's to gamma zero. Okay, so I've got these two inequalities. Let's let Gamma J K the G. Sorry, I shouldn't have called these K's, right? I didn't call them K.
01:13:28.679 - 01:14:06.655, Speaker A: I did, because K is my index for my. For my sequence. So I'm going to call those J's. It doesn't. It's not dangerous, what I did here, but it will be now. So let gamma KJ be gamma K restricted to TJ minus 1 terabyte. This is the decomposition of 01 for gamma naught, which gave us Gamma.
01:14:06.655 - 01:14:53.595, Speaker A: We're just fixing that decomposition in the middle board. Okay? And we're restricting each of the terms in this sequence, these gamma K's to that sub interval. Let's look at the sum From J equals 1 up to N of the length of gamma KJ plus 2 ε. Well, that's equal to. If I add up all the lengths of these pieces, that's equal to the length of gamma K plus 2K epsilon. Because I have 2 epsilon 2N epsilon, and that is less than D plus epsilon plus 2N epsilon. This is because of.
01:14:53.595 - 01:15:37.667, Speaker A: Because the length of Gamma K is less than D + Epsilon. That's here. The length of Gamma K is less than d +epsilon. And then this is equal to d +2n +1epsilon. And that's equal to the length of Gamma. Because of the definition, if you solve this for length of Gamma, you get exactly that. And this is the sum From j equals 1 up to n of the length of Gamma J, which is the same decomposition for Gamma.
01:15:37.667 - 01:17:10.865, Speaker A: Okay, so what have we got? We have the sum From j equals 1 up to n of the length of gamma kj plus 2 ε is less than the sum from j equals 1 up to n of the length of Gamma J. Okay? So at least one of these guys has to be less than that than the corresponding one there. Because if, if for each j this guy was at least equal to this one, then the sum here would be at least equal to the sum here. So there exists some j0 from 1 up to n such that the length of Gamma J naught k length plus 2 epsilon is less than the length of Gamma J naught. But this contradicts that Gamma J is minimizing on TJ minus 1 up to TJ. Okay? So hence we got this contradiction by assuming that the length was bigger than D. Therefore, the length equals D.
01:17:10.865 - 01:18:22.585, Speaker A: Do I have time? So hence the length of Gamma equals D. I don't know if I have time to do this, so it remains so. Now parameterize gamma by arc length. So we have gamma from zero to its length L to M is a broken geodesic. That means the velocity can jump at a finite number of points which has minimum length L in the free homotopy class script L. So all that remains to show is that it's regular, it has no jumps in its velocity, and then we'll be done. It'll be a closed geodesic.
01:18:22.585 - 01:19:43.175, Speaker A: So we'll show that gamma is regular. In other words, C1 at the points pj, which is gamma tj for j equals 1 up to n. And that implies the gamma is a closed geodesic in the homotopy class L. Okay, so that's all that we have left to do. And this, in two minutes, is going to finally use the existence of geodesically convex neighborhoods, which we did at the end of chapter three. So suppose not let PI be gamma of ti, be a point where gamma is not regular. So the velocity jumps and let B be a geodesically convex neighborhood of PI.
01:19:43.175 - 01:20:06.735, Speaker A: So here's the picture. There's gamma, some closed curve. There's a, there's a. I mean, it might have other jumps too, but we're assuming it has a jump at PI. That's why this thing. There's a non zero angle here. So let's choose.
01:20:06.735 - 01:20:55.819, Speaker A: I just need 90 seconds. Choose Q1, Q2. In the image of gamma J intersect B such that the geodesic triangle PI q1, q2 is homotopically trivial. This uses the geodesic convexity. Remember, one of the applications of the geodesically convex neighborhoods was to get a covering by the convex. So here's, here's Q1, Q2. This is A.
01:20:55.819 - 01:22:06.675, Speaker A: This is a geodesically convex neighborhood. So that means there exists a minimizing geodesic between Q1 and Q2, and it lies entirely in B. So the closed curve given by the minimizing geodesic Q1, Q2 and the arc of gamma that does not include PI has strictly smaller length and is in L. And that's a contradiction. So rather than write any more, I'll just see on the picture. See, if there was a sharp corner here, then I get this triangle like this. And I know that because this is a geodesically convex neighborhood, this is the only curve from here to here that minimizes the length from here to here.
01:22:06.675 - 01:22:48.245, Speaker A: So since this is a curve from here to here in B, this length is strictly longer than this. So if I take this guy and then this together I get a closed curve, it's clearly in the same free homotopy class, because I can free homotope this down to here, because this is homotopically trivial and the length is strictly smaller. But that contradicts the fact that the length of Gamma was D and which was the minimal it could be. Okay, so we're done. I proved the existence theorem. Sorry, I'm over on Wednesday. I'll just restate the theorem and make some remarks about it, but I didn't want to leave the proof in the middle and then we'll get to Priceman's theorem.
01:22:48.245 - 01:22:56.825, Speaker A: Okay, so Arthur, I'll ask answer your question, if not today, then tomorrow on Piazza, because I'm pretty busy today, but I'll find you an example.
