00:00:03.800 - 00:00:44.134, Speaker A: Thank you, symmetra. So the theorem of Paley venier was like that. It gives us a bijection between two space. And the way I explained was this. If f is entire and exponential type at most sigma, then there is. Oh, I forgot one important thing. F restricted to r is in l two r.
00:00:44.134 - 00:02:14.940, Speaker A: So this set of conditions implies that there is a function which later on we saw that. We saw that it's indeed the, the Fourier transform, or so, instead of there is a g in l two of minus sigma and sigma such that f of z is given by this formula two PI dz dt. And also there is an identity between the norm in on the left side and on the right side. And it's indeed if and only if it's not something difficult to see the other direction. The only thing which I forgot is this one. I had to add a two PI here because of two PI, which I added there. The reason I did not mention this when I prepared the lecture was that in many books, for example, Kuchi's book, or even, I believe it's in Duran book two.
00:02:14.940 - 00:02:56.496, Speaker A: But I'm sure in Kutris, because I got it there for the first time. The way they define a Fourier transform is not via this formula. They don't put two PI over there. They define f hat by integral from minus infinity to infinity f of t e to the minus I t x dt by this formula. And sometimes they add a coefficient. Here I put c. Some books take c equal to one sum, one over two PI, and even some one over root square of two PI for many different reasons.
00:02:56.496 - 00:03:25.358, Speaker A: I mean, I don't want to get into the way c works here. I mean, many different c's. You see, with this version, you don't need two PI here. So it's exponential type less than or equal to sigma, and then you have this representation. The penalty is paid somewhere else. I mean, PI is somewhere. You cannot completely hide it there.
00:03:25.358 - 00:04:17.408, Speaker A: So that's one thing which is important to which I wanted to highlight in order to avoid the mistake I had last time. Now we start over. Pretty much. Last example is the Bergman space. So, example in the category of analytic function spaces, the previous to the hardy space and the Dirichlet space, they were defined on the open unit disk. Bergman space can be also defined on dopamine, but it can be even more general. We consider any g which is in c, or even later on you can go to cn.
00:04:17.408 - 00:05:11.454, Speaker A: So it's a domain in the complex plane, and the notation either b two of g, and some books even write a two of g, two notations. It's the set of function f defined from G to C. Of course, analytic holomorph and also the integral over G. Either you write it g with one integral, but it's. And if you look at the measure I use here, it's indeed a double integral. So it's f of z squared da of z. Or you can write it like this.
00:05:11.454 - 00:06:18.990, Speaker A: F of x plus iy squared dx dy is finite, so it's squared integral with respect to area measure. In the previous two cases, in the dirichlet and in the Hardy space, we started with the line integral. So it's obvious that, for example, any polynomial or any function which is holomorphic on a domain bigger than g, in the finite case, in the case. So. But from abstract point of view, let me prove this theorem. B two. B two of G is a reproducing kernel.
00:06:18.990 - 00:06:46.094, Speaker A: So it's nrkhs. This means it's a hillbilly space. And of course, the point evaluations are continuous. To do C. To do. To do this, I need an estimation. So suppose this is the point g and this is the point w.
00:06:46.094 - 00:07:45.144, Speaker A: Consider a disk which is here are entirely inside our domain g. So our domain can have holes too. So d of w and r, it's even closure. It's inside G. And I want to obtain a representation here on this disk. But from Cauchy, we know that f at point w is equal to one over two. PI integral from zero to PI f of w plus r e to the I t or theta d theta for any r between zero and capital r.
00:07:45.144 - 00:08:27.576, Speaker A: Indeed, that's the Cauchy, the main cauchy integral f of say zeta over zeta minus w d zeta. And then when you parenthese zeta, you obtain this one. That's a line integral. So on this disk, which I mean, enlarge it. Here it is w. I consider a small silica of radius r inside the bigger one. But r, little r is freeze between zero and r.
00:08:27.576 - 00:08:56.574, Speaker A: So I integrate both sides with respect to R. Doctor. So I do integral from zero to R. Doctor, on both sides. On the left side, f of w doesn't depend on R. And I can write it f R. Doctor.
00:08:56.574 - 00:09:54.804, Speaker A: And on the, on the right side, it's integral from zero to PI fo omega plus r e to the I theta d theta. And then the whole thing, rdr integral from zero to r on this disk. That is why I wanted here to be away from the frontier. Even the closure does not touch the frontier. So f is a bounded function on the disc, or even its closure and fubini or tonality. I mean, better to say Fubini theorem works well. And I can interpret this as one integral with respect to the measure R.
00:09:54.804 - 00:11:18.832, Speaker A: Doctor d theta and one over two PI. Here I can write zero to. This is big r. I can write from zero to big r, zero to PI, or on the disk omega radius r. And now on the left side, I have f times two reals over two reals. And if I move capital r to the other side, the representation I was looking for is one over PI r, two integral over the disk f of omega plus r e to the I theta rdr d theta or, which is the same thing. F of w is one over PI r, two integral over d omega r f of z daz.
00:11:18.832 - 00:12:05.364, Speaker A: And for me, daz is dx dy. We'll see. Sometimes later on we normalize and it will be different by constant. So for the time being, what, what I obtained is fine and I can draw many consequences after this. First, let's apply Cauchy Schwartz. So w f of w absolute value would be less than or equal to one over PI r two. Our integral over disk one times mode of fz.
00:12:05.364 - 00:13:15.644, Speaker A: And then applying Cauchy Schwarz to this omega r, one squared daz root square, and the same thing for the function f. And at this point, we obtain an interesting inequality. This integral is PI r two. But don't forget the root square with another one down there, it gives us one over root square of PI r. And for the other integral, let's be generous. We put it integral from g. Instead of this, we write, we write the whole domain, domain g f of z dx dy.
00:13:15.644 - 00:14:26.694, Speaker A: And this is the norm that I mean, in the definition of Birkman space, we had this, I mean, maybe I did not mention explicitly, that's, that's the definition of norm in the Bergman space. So it's, it's a normal f in b two. So in short, f of w is less than or equal to one over root PI r norm of f in this space. Consequences of this estimation. What is our goal? We want to show that it's a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Yeah, Sheldon mentioned gene need not to be bounded through. For example, if she's the upper half plane is still interesting.
00:14:26.694 - 00:15:28.744, Speaker A: Indeed. I probably Sheldon mentioned this since I mentioned polynomials are there. That was for the bounded case. Yeah, absolutely true. And even this inequality that you see here, you see that in some cases the space is trivial for example, if g is equal to c, the whole complex plane capital r here is free, can goes to infinity and shows that f is identically equal to zero if r goes to infinity, and therefore b, two of c, is just the trivial case. However, g equal to C plus the upper half plane is an interesting space. And there are other elements, many, many other elements in there.
00:15:28.744 - 00:16:18.754, Speaker A: The reason I did not mention that explicitly because my focus was on the open unit disk and I did not highlight this case. But Sheldon is absolutely right. So, consequences of this, I want to show that Bergman space is a Hilbert space, and moreover, the point evaluations are continuous. It seems that the last part is done first. However, this is needed to show that it's a Hilbert space. In other words, I need this. I need this estimation to show that b, two of g, is closed in l two of g.
00:16:18.754 - 00:17:34.054, Speaker A: And when it's closed, it's by itself a Hilbert space. Point evaluation today and point evaluation already shown. So how to show that it's closed? Assume that fn is a Cauchy sequence in B two. Two things. First, of course, Fn is Cauchy in L two. So there is a function, there is a. Call it h in L two of g, such that if n goes to h in L two in norm, at this point, there is no indication that h is analytic.
00:17:34.054 - 00:18:15.674, Speaker A: And that is the point. The previous estimations come into picture. Since fn goes to h, there is a subsequence. There is snap, such that f and k of z goes to h of z. Almost. So we have kind of point wise convergence two for a subsequence. But still it is not enough to show that h is a good function, or better to say, change it to a function which is holomorphic.
00:18:15.674 - 00:18:54.002, Speaker A: I use this as before. Consider a disk r, which does not touch the frontier. And it's on the second page. We are in our domain like this. Take it. Disk like this can be anywhere. But the important thing is that the distance from the disk to the frontier is positive.
00:18:54.002 - 00:19:42.044, Speaker A: Delta is strictly positive. And now you can do the previous estimation at any point of this with capital r, with capital r to be delta divided by two. So the radius of this is delta over two. And when you do all of this, still you are away from the frontier. And you can say that for any point, w in this disk, f of w is less than or equal to a constant, which depends on delta. Doesn't matter the precise value. It's two over delta.
00:19:42.044 - 00:21:06.124, Speaker A: But then the precise value is not, is not important for us. The important thing is that it's controlled by the normal f in this space e two at all points, at all points of this disk. Now replace f by fn. Take f to be n minus f, so fm of w minus f so uniformly on this disk, we can control the growth of fn minus fm. And by our assumption I mean f n to be cauchy, this quantity can be made small. So the right side small implies that the left side is small, and therefore f. The sequence fn is uniformly convergent on this disk, on this disk.
00:21:06.124 - 00:22:01.254, Speaker A: So in other words, when you are away from the frontier, the sequence is uniformly convergent and the uniformly convergent sequence of holomorphic function. The limit is also holomorphic. So here you can say that there is f in whole of g, such that fn of z goes to f of z locally for every point. And more than that, if I mean indeed, this is a consequence of the uniform convergence. But this is enough for me, even at all points, not almost everywhere. So now compare this one with what we obtained before. With this one.
00:22:01.254 - 00:23:02.854, Speaker A: On one hand, f n goes to f everywhere. On the other hand, a subsequence goes to h. So this means that. So this means that h is equal to f almost everywhere. Or you can put it also this way, h can be repaired at a set of measure zero to obtain a function which is holomorphic. And therefore f n goes to f in l two of g, which is equivalent to say that fn goes to f in b two. Therefore b two is a hindered space.
00:23:02.854 - 00:24:39.938, Speaker A: We already saw the point evaluations are continuous. So enters nrkhs spatial case. What is this special part? Important case when g is the open unit is parallel to what we saw for Bergman, for hardy, and the Dirichlet space. For the hardy space, it was the function of the four sum a n z n such that the sum of mod a n squared is finite. For the Dirichlet space, we had the factor n plus one in front for the Bergman space. For the time being, we don't have such a representation. Our definition is that f is in b two.
00:24:39.938 - 00:25:20.006, Speaker A: If integral over d f prime z squared, daz is finite. And for us, up to now, daz is dx dy. I mentioned the normalization before. I changed a little bit the definition here. So my definition for the disk, I just normalize da. Instead of dx dy, I divide it by two PI, so f not f prime in that integral. Thank you.
00:25:20.006 - 00:26:06.824, Speaker A: Thank you. If Frank is a another space, f. Thank you. Yes, so the reason I divided by p, you'll see later on. I mean, I add them in parenthesis here, that with this, the norm of the constant function one will be one. That is why no other reason. So with this, the norm of f in the Bergmann space, p two is now integral over d f o z squared daz or dx dy divided by PI root of this.
00:26:06.824 - 00:26:55.272, Speaker A: It's the definition of the original one, but it's not similar to this one. Can we interpret this or obtain a similar formula based on an. And this is a simple consequence of perceival identity. It's not something difficult to obtain. You can write it this way. Dxdy is the same as rdr d theta. If you had this before, it's integral from zero to y zero to one f of r e to theta squared r.
00:26:55.272 - 00:27:55.834, Speaker A: Doctor. And I put one over PI here. And now I use the formula for f as a series representation. So integral from zero to one, integral from zero to two PI sum a n r n. That's as our coefficient e to the I n theta squared d theta. And I had one over PI allowed me to write one over two PI and then the whole thing rdr. And at some point I need to multiply by two two.
00:27:55.834 - 00:28:41.094, Speaker A: So because of these, I multiply by two two. The reason I wrote it this way, because the integral inside the, the red parenthesis, I can apply the parcel identity and it's equal to this sum. And from zero to infinity an rn squared. And then rdr half. That's. That's parsimony. And now everything is positive.
00:28:41.094 - 00:29:18.254, Speaker A: I have two integral here. One of them is this, the other integral is this summation. Everything is positive. I can change the order. And it's better to, instead of parenthesis here, it's better to write absolute value because a n could be complex number. So it's twice some n from zero to infinity, a n squared integral from zero to one r two n plus one, doctor. And here a half.
00:29:18.254 - 00:30:11.540, Speaker A: And we are almost done. We're almost done because it's this integral is one over two n plus two. And two simplifies and I obtain some a n squared divided by n plus one n root square of this. And now we can compare with what we had before. One moment please. What's happening here it is. So you see, for Hardy is just mod squared summation and Dirichlet summation n plus one.
00:30:11.540 - 00:30:29.074, Speaker A: And now I can erase this. So the condition for Bergman is equivalent to say that a n squared divided by n plus one is finite and square root of this is the norm. Was there a question.
00:30:31.614 - 00:30:36.874, Speaker B: Sir? Can you please explain the step which uses the personal identity?
00:30:37.174 - 00:32:25.144, Speaker A: The personal identity is, I mean, says that if you have a function phi even in l two, either l two of t if you think of the unit circuit, or l two of zero to PI if you stay on the real line, and then for any n in z, not just in our case. In our case, half of the spectrum is zero. In general cases, for any n is z, phi hat of n is defined by integral with the first interpretation on t, with the second interpretation from zero to two PI of not e to the I theta e minus I theta d theta from zero to PI, and then normalize divided by two p. That's the Fourier coefficient. So, Fourier coefficient is defined for any integer in z and Karswal. It makes the bridge very important. It says that the norm of phi in our original space, l two of t is equal to the norm of phi hat in little l two l two of z, which is the same as sum m from minus infinity plus infinity, absolute value phi hat n mod squared, and then root squared.
00:32:25.144 - 00:33:36.774, Speaker A: That's the partial identity. What I used here, here is my, this is my function phi, the whole thing here, this is my function phi of e to the I theta. And because our little r everything works well, I mean, the summation is uniformly convergent. And for this function, phi hat of n is equal to zero if n is negative. That is why I said half of this spectrum is equal to zero. And if n is positive, that's the Fourier coefficient. It's a n r to the n for n bigger than or equal to zero.
00:33:36.774 - 00:34:06.314, Speaker A: And what I wrote below here, it's just mod of phi hat of n phi hat of nature mod squared. What I wrote here, but n from zero to infinity because the other half is identically equal to zero. Is that clear now or more transparent now?
00:34:07.054 - 00:34:28.024, Speaker B: Yes, sir. And what you wrote below the parcel identity, that is just coming from the parcel identity in general university, I mean the below the general, which one you told for l two of zero to two PI.
00:34:28.724 - 00:34:30.424, Speaker A: So that's a bigger arrow.
00:34:30.804 - 00:34:34.584, Speaker B: That is just a special case of partial identity for Hilbert space.
00:34:36.884 - 00:35:15.244, Speaker A: For this Hilbert space in. It's a result from harmonic analysis. Yeah, of course, in a general Hilbert space, you also have the personal identity. But there is an assumption over there. You start with a family, either a sequence or if it's not counterbali family or function in the theorem, you assume that is an orthonormal basis.
00:35:16.784 - 00:35:22.884, Speaker B: If you assume e raised to power in theta will be the orthonormal basis for l two t, right?
00:35:23.304 - 00:36:17.866, Speaker A: Yes. That's the whole point here in the abstract setting, assuming that your sequence or your family is an orthonormal basis is a part of the hypothesis, and then based on that, you obtain the personal identity. In a sense, this is the easy part. What is important here, and it's hidden indeed in the personal identity, is that this set n from minus infinity to plus infinity is complete. To show that it's an orthonormal sequence, that is simple. But to show that it's complete, it's a bit of work. And then, knowing that it's complete, we can obtain the parcel identity.
00:36:17.866 - 00:36:37.674, Speaker A: That's the difference between parcel identity for l two of t and the partial identity for a general abstract Hilbert space. In other words. Well, this theorem has more in it than the one you see for the abstract setting.
00:36:39.574 - 00:36:40.982, Speaker B: You said thank you.
00:36:41.118 - 00:37:31.984, Speaker A: You're welcome. This finishes our example. Before wrapping up this chapter and examples, there are very good books now at least two now one by Durian and one by Heddleman and on Bergman spaces. And also, Sheldon has a very nice paper on this computer. Unfortunately, I do not have that long paper you wrote many, many years ago on Bergman spaces. If you have, you may share it with us please. And it's a very good reference if you want to be more familiar with these spaces.
00:37:31.984 - 00:38:15.684, Speaker A: I will try to find an electronic copy and post it over the break. Thank you very much. The last section on this chapter is when you want to go from c or d. I mean dimension one to cn or dn. In some cases it's very straightforward, but in some other cases you need to be careful. It's not that straightforward. I just mentioned the generalization of the definition of h two of D.
00:38:15.684 - 00:39:32.664, Speaker A: And you can follow the same line to obtain the h two of Bregman and spaces and some others. But as I said, you need to be careful. In the general setting, how do we define h two of Dm? First, the definition of Dm. D times d the poly disk and an arbitrary element of Dn or Cn. Still, we can use z, but z this times is a vector of dimension. Nice. And how do we define polynomials here? To do so, consider the multi index I a one a two, and in which each ak is an integer is bigger than or equal to zero.
00:39:32.664 - 00:41:00.284, Speaker A: And now definition I define z to the power I. So it's a notation. A vector to exponent another vector. This is defined to be the first component z one to the power I one times the second component to the our second component in I I two, and up to the last one multiplied by zn to the power in. And in this way we could have normal formal series formal sum a, which depends on I I, is in z plus exponent m and z exponent I. If we are in dimension one, we obtain just what we had before. But in higher dimension dimension two or three, the index here is the one like here.
00:41:00.284 - 00:41:47.248, Speaker A: And for example, let me write for the case n equal to two. That's very informative. In the, in the two dimension n equal to two, the formal series sum a iz I. Our first term is the constant a zero zero, and then we have terms of degree one plus a 10 z one plus a zero one z two, and then terms of degree two. It's a formal series. We are not worried about convergence. Now, a 20 z one exponent two.
00:41:47.248 - 00:43:04.490, Speaker A: And here I have also z two exponent zero, but I don't write it plus a eleven z two plus a zero two z two exponent two. So this is the homogeneous polynomial of degree two, and we continue that that's our formal c base. The definition of h two of d and is simple. The set of all function f such that some mod AI squared is finite and the summation is over. I I is in z plus n. In the previous case, which, which I mentioned for n equal to two when I write some module AI squared means that sum of mod of all these coefficients is bounded. So you can show that it's a, it's a Hilbert space of analytic functions.
00:43:04.490 - 00:44:30.156, Speaker A: On the dn and even point evaluations are continuous. And I mean, just to finish, in a few minutes remaining of the first part, let me, let me find the kernel for this space still in the case two. So in the case n equal to two, I mean h want to find k w. In other words, the function kw such that for any f in h two f of w is equal to the inner product of f and k. What is this? I recall you that in the one dimensional case it was the Zigo kernel. And sometimes we call it Cauchy Zigo kernel. It's one over one minus z w bar.
00:44:30.156 - 00:46:15.294, Speaker A: But here we have z one z two w one w two. What would be the kernel? And to find the kernel based on this restriction that we put on the definition of h two, I should clarify, what is the inner product, even though it's hidden here. So to be more precise, if f and g are in h two of dn then the inner product of f and g is defined to be the sum AI bi r summation over all I, where ar are the coefficients of f and bi are the coefficients of G. So f has the form sum of AI z exponent I and g for bi z to the I. So now we want to find kw based on this representation. So, we evaluate the right side and the left side, and this identity is the clue to tell us what is the kernel. On one hand, assume that kw also has this representation k.
00:46:15.294 - 00:48:41.784, Speaker A: Of course, bi will depend on on I, but for the time being, we assume that w is fixed and our variable is z for f and g. What is f and inner product with kw? Well, on one hand, we had it above with some AI bi bar, and on the, on the other hand, this is equal to f w, and we know that fw is equal the sum over I, AI w to the exponent I. And by comparing this inequalities together, we see that bi bar should be equal to w bar, or bi is w bar I. And so kw of z is the sum summation over I, bi z I is the summation w bar I z I. According to the definition I presented above. If you develop this, this sum, because it's overall I, at least, for example, for n two, it's one plus double. Sorry, I don't know what's going on.
00:48:41.784 - 00:50:00.894, Speaker A: One plus w 1 bar z one plus w two bar z two. This is the part for the linear term plus w 1 bar squared z one squared plus w 1 bar z 1 bar w two. No, z two plus w two bar squared z two squared. And continue like this. And you see immediately, this is indeed the product of two sums. The first is one plus w one z one plus w 1 bar squared z one squared. And the other is the same thing with index two.
00:50:00.894 - 00:50:41.464, Speaker A: And this is precisely one over one minus w one z one times one over one minus w two bar z two. So it's a product of one minus w j bar as a j over j from one up to. Any case, it's the product of the Koshijiva care that we had before.
00:50:44.604 - 00:50:52.544, Speaker B: So, yeah, all this actually work out because we are working with absolutely convergence, right?
00:50:53.564 - 00:50:59.916, Speaker A: I'm sorry that the connection apparently is not what. I couldn't hear you well, okay, what.
00:50:59.940 - 00:51:06.774, Speaker B: I'm saying, like in the third step, you had written the sum as the product of two series.
00:51:07.234 - 00:51:07.634, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:07.674 - 00:51:12.722, Speaker B: All this works out because we are working with the absolutely convergence, right?
00:51:12.818 - 00:51:24.594, Speaker A: Yes, yes. Everything is inside the disk. I mean, the way the way I write, for example, here or here or here, even the order of summation is not important. Yeah.
00:51:24.634 - 00:51:40.694, Speaker B: And just one more thing. For the kwz to be the summation I omega bar I z I. Yeah. This summation of mod omega mod omega I square should be finite.
00:51:41.474 - 00:51:42.294, Speaker A: Yes.
00:51:42.794 - 00:51:45.586, Speaker B: And that is because we are inside the disk.
00:51:45.730 - 00:52:11.814, Speaker A: Yes. Yes. For a w fixed and z fixed inside the disk, it's absolutely convergent. And if both of them are strictly less than or equal to, say, the r, which is less than one, then the convergence is uniform on that compact set. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
00:52:11.814 - 00:53:20.892, Speaker A: The convergence, I mean, it's the best type of convergence that we can have here because we stay inside this in, when these parameters are on the boundary. Indeed, it happens in some studies of the Dirichlet space in which, or model spaces, we have k, w and z, absolute value of w less than one and absolute value of z less than one. In some studies, it happens in model spaces and also happens in local dirt spaces. At least we need to consider point on the boundary. Still, there is a meaning for that. But the calculations are not as straightforward as I explained here. Some caution is needed precisely because of what you set.
00:53:20.892 - 00:54:04.584, Speaker A: We do not have uniform or absolute convergence at the point of the boundary, but still we have some, some type of convergence and we can proceed and define kw. Okay. Yes, thank you. I think I, I went a bit ahead of time. I think it's better to stop now, have, have a quick break of about ten minutes, and then come back with the rest in the chapter two.
