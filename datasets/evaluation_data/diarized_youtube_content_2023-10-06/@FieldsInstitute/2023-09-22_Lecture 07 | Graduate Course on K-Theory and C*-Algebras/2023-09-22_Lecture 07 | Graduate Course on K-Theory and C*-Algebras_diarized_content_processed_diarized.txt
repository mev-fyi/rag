00:01:01.614 - 00:01:19.254, Speaker A: 1960 and ten by ten.
00:02:08.994 - 00:02:10.094, Speaker B: This is a.
00:02:27.394 - 00:02:35.274, Speaker C: Sort of interpret, um.
00:02:37.774 - 00:06:37.834, Speaker A: Zero by the way the batteries came in. No, they are the way cycle. I guess maybe, maybe I could ask you the question. What is the one by one in the back row? Yeah, one by one.
00:06:39.414 - 00:06:40.434, Speaker C: How do you.
00:06:43.534 - 00:06:46.274, Speaker A: How do we behave? How do you modify.
00:06:53.994 - 00:06:54.734, Speaker C: So.
00:07:14.674 - 00:07:45.916, Speaker A: You modify the entries and you add them and that's now modify. You have to remember how to do it, right. Everyone has to learn how to do it. I guess that's learned behavior. I think you just put closer over there for a while so we can.
00:07:45.940 - 00:07:49.134, Speaker C: Use this or is that okay?
00:07:49.174 - 00:07:50.034, Speaker B: Oh, sure.
00:07:50.374 - 00:07:50.806, Speaker C: Okay.
00:07:50.830 - 00:08:01.030, Speaker A: But was there someone that can hear me better now? Oh, I mean the people on Zoom can. Hopefully it's only getting this way.
00:08:01.142 - 00:08:01.834, Speaker C: Yes.
00:08:05.974 - 00:08:07.118, Speaker A: Somewhere in this area.
00:08:07.206 - 00:08:07.694, Speaker B: Yes.
00:08:07.814 - 00:08:08.914, Speaker A: Good afternoon.
00:08:12.434 - 00:08:13.254, Speaker C: All right.
00:08:16.874 - 00:08:50.393, Speaker A: Just carefully learned, laboriously learned the behavior. You can multiply two by two matrices. Is it commutative still? I guess zero by zero and one by one. Our community value, this ting Kuan, how. Okay. Are one by one matrices, complex matrix? Okay, what about two by two?
00:08:52.973 - 00:08:53.429, Speaker C: No.
00:08:53.501 - 00:08:54.273, Speaker B: Okay.
00:08:54.973 - 00:08:55.793, Speaker C: All right.
00:09:02.693 - 00:09:36.474, Speaker A: That takes care of that. And should I. And I guess a two by two are not mutative and three by three matrices are not going to be, because in some, in some sense, three by threes include two by twos. You put two by twos in the upper left hand corner, that's a subway. Take the two by two.
00:09:38.214 - 00:09:39.154, Speaker B: By three.
00:09:46.014 - 00:10:04.264, Speaker A: By two, keeping, just leaving the zeros alone. And so they're not going to be okay. By the way, how do we distinguish, how do we distinguish m one, m zero? That's a good way of distinguishing m zero, m one, and m zero.
00:10:05.324 - 00:10:07.076, Speaker B: M zero is zero and m one.
00:10:07.100 - 00:10:12.292, Speaker A: Is as a marking to the complex numbers. So they're not isomorphic.
00:10:12.428 - 00:11:00.464, Speaker B: M two is not commutative, so it's not isomorphic to m one. But how about m three? How do you show that m three is not isomorphic to m two as an algebra? Let me just continue down this. Alexander Bohlen wasn't here, okay? No, I asked if somebody else was you. But that's not the same thing as asking you whether, how you distinguish three by three matrices from two by two matrices. Can you tell the difference? I mean, if you look at them, you can see the difference, right? If you see them as matrices. But suppose you just see them as an abstract algebra. And how do you tell that there are different algebras? They're both non communities.
00:11:00.464 - 00:11:40.430, Speaker B: Well, think about it. That's a good exercise, really. I mean, that's getting close to the core of the course. How do you show that? One way, by the way, would be to, well, the point is that this is a course in k zero, k theory, k zero and k one associated ideas. But if you calculate the k zero group, k zero is a billion group. Calculate k zero of m one or m two. M k zero of the zero algebra is zero, but k zero of m one is isomorphic to k zero of m two.
00:11:40.430 - 00:11:42.474, Speaker B: Would you know what they are? Alexander?
00:11:44.214 - 00:11:44.598, Speaker C: Yes.
00:11:44.646 - 00:12:39.354, Speaker B: Alexander what does, what is k zero of m one? Okay, well, that's something to study, right? We've talked about it. It's the module definition. You take finitely generated vector spaces and you add them, take direct sum of them, and that gives you a semigroup, except it's not abelian and it's not associative. So it's sort of a semi group. But then you take a modular isomorphism and you get, well, the isomorphism classes are labeled by natural numbers, right? Two finite dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension. So the isomorphism, which is 0123 and so on. So the isomorphism classes are labeled by the natural number.
00:12:39.354 - 00:14:01.534, Speaker B: And so that's the semigroup of isomorphism classes. That's an exercise. Okay, that makes sense. All right? But it's the same for, so m one is modules over the complex, modules over m one is modules over the complex number. Now I forgot to put that. All right, so it turns out that modules over m two are in one to one correspond, modules over m one. That's, if you have any ring with r, then have any ring r with unit, then k zero of r is an isomorphic and a natural way to k zero of the ring of two by two matrices over r.
00:14:01.534 - 00:14:39.446, Speaker B: Okay? And if you take, we've got two definitions of k zero. There's the module definition and there's the idempotent definition. And sometimes, sometimes one is much easier, sometimes the other is much easier, okay? And so it's good to know their equivalent definition with item potence or projections in a star ring that's in the.
00:14:39.470 - 00:14:40.034, Speaker C: Book.
00:14:41.774 - 00:15:50.884, Speaker B: Textbook by Rodham company. And the module definition is what I'm talking about. With some certain class of module, you take, you take direct sum, take direction, and isomorphous, okay, well, the, it turns out that the k zero group of m two over the complex m two of the complex numbers is the same group in a natural way as the k zero group of m one. But you don't just keep, if you have a unit or ring. You don't just keep track of the, you don't just keep track of the modules and arbitrary modules with direct sum. And nice. What you do is to keep track of the module r.
00:15:50.884 - 00:15:53.656, Speaker B: R is the left module over itself.
00:15:53.720 - 00:15:54.484, Speaker C: Okay?
00:15:56.304 - 00:16:32.674, Speaker B: It's finitely generated because the algebra, the ring has a unit and it's a projector because that's part of the definition of projective. It's a direct sum of copies of our is projective, that's free. And a direct sum and finite direct sum of copies of the ring is that projective means. So r in particular is a projective, finitely generated left module. And so, and this is a special module, right? Given the ring.
00:16:34.614 - 00:16:35.046, Speaker C: Okay?
00:16:35.070 - 00:17:42.412, Speaker B: Within the k zero group, keeps track of the special modules, looks at all modules, finitely generated production modules and keeps track of the special one. Well here the special one is r at the left module. And here the special module is over m two of r is m two of our over m two of our left module. And so as if you think of the module, and of course we're talking about the complex numbers. R is the complex numbers here. And if um, if the um, this special element will be one, it will be um, it will be equal to the number one in z, okay? And this number will be the special number two in z. That's a computation.
00:17:42.468 - 00:17:43.224, Speaker C: Okay.
00:17:44.404 - 00:18:46.520, Speaker B: We have to notice how modules over m two are give you the same semi group in a natural way as modules over r. And so the, and here the unit of the natural special element of the k zero group, which is the module itself, it's going inside z. It's going to be twice what you get there. This two comes up the factor, okay? But by the way, in terms of idempotence, it's a little easier because you just look at the, at the unit, you look at the class of the unit, the k zero class of the unit. We can call it here, we can call it the k zero class or this special module. But in terms of idempotence it's almost easier. You have the unit of the ring and then you have the unit of two by two matrix of the unit of the two by two matrix thing.
00:18:46.520 - 00:19:48.664, Speaker B: Call this one sub one. That's the unit of the one by one matrix string. And one sub two is the unit of the two by two matrix string. So here it's easier to recognize this as the one sub unit of the one by one matrices. And this is the unit of the two by two matrices. And the reason it's easy to recognize is if you look at the matrices, look at two by two matrices over the complex numbers, and what's the unit? Well, if it's one by one matrices, then it's the matrix one one by one. But if it's, what's the, is Doc Roney here today? Okay, so what does the unit of the algebra of two by two maker two.
00:19:48.664 - 00:20:41.716, Speaker B: Okay, well, okay, I think a better way to say that is the identity matrix, because if you talk about the unit of an algebra that's sometimes just called the identity, whether it's matrices or not, right? And now it's true. If you have an algebra that has multiplicative identity, then that's going to be unique. So if you say the identity, then that's leaving me up to do the computation, right? But if you say the identity matrix, this is sort of an idiom for a very, for a given, your family pet would see a matrix with 10 one down the diagonal, right? Identity matrix. You don't have to think, you don't have to calculate what the actual how that acts as the identity of the algebra.
00:20:41.900 - 00:20:42.316, Speaker C: Okay?
00:20:42.340 - 00:21:01.498, Speaker B: But it does, of course. All right, so this is my point is writing an explicit formula, writing an explicit expression for the identity element of the ring gives you an explanation. It gives you a visualization of the number two. You see two one, right?
00:21:01.636 - 00:21:02.314, Speaker C: So.
00:21:06.214 - 00:22:01.938, Speaker B: This one, sub two, is equal to the number two in the k zero group. Well, it's, I guess people should be doing computations. Okay, yes, well, I was, you're seeing what I'm leading up to. I mean, I'm leading up to another wave for matrix algebra is over the, over the commuter to ring particularly complex numbers. You're anticipating the discussion of a different way of computing than to the k zero group.
00:22:01.986 - 00:22:05.334, Speaker C: Okay. Well.
00:22:08.074 - 00:23:08.064, Speaker B: It'S more or less, it's most natural in the setting of idempotence, but then it takes for granted that you're talking about idempotent. So it's combined. It's combined. It's a trace of a certain linear function, right? You have matrices, matrices of entries, complex numbers, real or complex numbers, for instance, or any field, and you can always talk about the trace, right? That's a linear functional on the linear space or algebra of matrices. And if you take, lo and behold, if you take the trace of this one, you get one, which is one, okay? And you take the trace of this one. Karissa, why? I asked you a question. Is Siddharth Dagar in today?
00:23:09.324 - 00:23:11.136, Speaker C: Oh, okay.
00:23:11.160 - 00:24:21.524, Speaker B: Well, let me briefly try and see how that, how the communication works online I don't see, yeah, that's Siddharth. Okay, now do you, can you see what the traces of the unit of two by two matrices? Maybe you don't have your, maybe you're not, maybe you can't hear me. Okay. I'm not very good at communicating online. Have to, have to learn how to do that. Daniel Dima Emil Fredzone Justin Foos Sabek Germain Charles Griffin. Okay, good, thank you.
00:24:21.524 - 00:25:18.068, Speaker B: Do you want to tell us what the traces of the identity two by two identity matrices? It sounds like a trivial question, right? Yes, well, okay, but yes, I mean new Charles. Yeah, yeah, two, yeah. Okay. But it's interesting that, that coincides with the K zero class, right, well, sorry. Yeah, yeah. If you have, if you go farther to ten by ten matrices, I guess the, if you look at the trace of the identity matrix, order 1010 by ten identity matrix. Yeah, that's a very good, I think we should say that's an exercise.
00:25:18.068 - 00:25:38.488, Speaker B: Okay, so we're, we're looking at, so it's already an exercise with two by two matrices because not every, if it's one by one matrices, then every matrix is diagonal. And so if it's, if it's idempotent, the entries have to be zero or one.
00:25:38.536 - 00:25:39.124, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:39.584 - 00:26:32.038, Speaker B: And so the trace is obvious what the trace is, you just count the number of ones and that'll be also the, the dimension of the range of the, of the atom bone as a linear operator on column vectors. So, and it will, which is, which is the, that's the module that corresponds to the item voltage. And the dimension of, that is how we compute the, that's how we compute the K zero group, the complex number. Okay, but if you have already, with two by two matrices, you can have an idempotent, which is not. So now we're getting into something interesting. So Jara, that was a very good, it's anticipating something, I sure. I want you to believe I was going to get to the trace.
00:26:32.086 - 00:26:32.794, Speaker C: Okay.
00:26:34.094 - 00:27:29.624, Speaker B: It's very important for looking at the computing case and it's in some sense it's maybe more, more elementary in certain cases. Okay, but the, so what's an example of an idempotent matrix, two by two matrix, which is not diagonal, all zeros is diagonal and ones down the diagonal, or just ones and zeros down the diagonal, those are all idempotent and they're diagonal. So the trace is easy to compute. Well the thing is we have another if any two by two matrix, the trace is easy to compute because it's the same formula. Just take the diagonal. This is a. By the way, the trace is a highly non trivial thing.
00:27:29.624 - 00:27:40.704, Speaker B: It's a linear functionality and it has unique with certain properties. Okay, so that's a good exercise. Characterize the trace as a linear functional with certain very special properties.
00:27:41.084 - 00:27:41.604, Speaker C: Okay?
00:27:41.644 - 00:29:03.234, Speaker B: It's not just enough that the trace of the unit in n by n matrices is equal to n. That's not enough because you take any non zero functional. If it's non zero, if it's non zero on the unit, then you can multiply it by some number to get something to get it equal to one on the unit. That can't be enough to characterize trace. Okay, so trace is very important. Reminds me of a story about the late Abrah Kirkberg, one of the leading figures, operator algebra theory at the year long, two year long group program at Fields institute. During a series of lectures in 1994, he was talking about quasi diagonal juxtaposal algebra, and someone in the audience, a student or a postdoc probably a student, asked, what is quasi diagonality? And Professor Kirkberg is a traditional, was a traditional german professor.
00:29:03.234 - 00:29:52.472, Speaker B: Well, he had a milder side, but he was a little gruff sometimes. So his answer was this, diagonality. Quasi diagonality is a very important concept. Everyone should know what quasi diagonality is. Then he continued with his lecture. Okay, so I could almost say the same thing with the trace, right? Interestingly, it's related to diagonality too, somehow. Okay, but I hope that I'm not as gruff as Professor Kierfberg was sometimes.
00:29:52.472 - 00:29:58.976, Speaker B: But on the other hand, I can only hope, I can only aim to be as kind as he thought, as.
00:29:59.000 - 00:30:02.204, Speaker C: He often was, I think.
00:30:06.224 - 00:30:30.144, Speaker B: Well, only a spiral. So what? Has anyone figured out an example of a non diagonal item? Potent. Now for two by two matrices over the complex numbers. I was, I was talking with Charles. Did you take a look at that? Yes, Charlie.
00:30:35.864 - 00:30:36.256, Speaker C: Okay.
00:30:36.280 - 00:31:14.700, Speaker B: You know, I can understand why I advised to use a microphone, not just for the people. And I'm off the camera, too. I don't know if they can. Is my battery still working? Okay, but I'll keep an eye on it. Keep an ear on it, but. Okay. So, Charlie, you were giving me the entries in a two by two matrix, but I couldn't quite catch them.
00:31:14.700 - 00:31:39.448, Speaker B: Maybe I should in a meeting where they have a microphone to pass around to people in the audience, you know, not, it shouldn't. It's a. It. I don't expect it to be the identity matrix. I don't expect it to be the identity for multiplication identity element. Okay, because that's unique. But I just, but I want it to be equal to its square.
00:31:39.448 - 00:31:41.848, Speaker B: That's what, in Latin that's what idempotent means.
00:31:41.896 - 00:31:42.604, Speaker C: Okay.
00:31:43.024 - 00:32:05.962, Speaker B: Um, yeah. Okay well that's one, which is, it's not either. It's not the zero matrix and it's not the identity matrix, but its only entries are zero and one. Would be nice to see something which has entry, different entries.
00:32:06.018 - 00:32:06.774, Speaker C: Okay.
00:32:07.794 - 00:32:42.664, Speaker B: And does anyone want to suggest such a matrix? But it isn't an expert on matrices. I mean if they are all so much the better if they're an expert. But then the purpose of my asking people to offer answers and suggestions is not solely for the enlightenment of other people but for their own enlightenment to put them on the spot.
00:32:43.624 - 00:32:44.016, Speaker C: Okay.
00:32:44.040 - 00:33:18.374, Speaker B: I mean to give them practice and think every, but you probably must know, you must know already. Oh, someone is suggesting one in the chat. Okay, can you get, can you find out what they have in mind? Okay, how, so it's a four two by two matrix. Right. So three, three by three, that wouldn't work with, how about, how about one third everywhere if it's three by three, anyone wants to try that? Okay, but I'm.
00:33:20.914 - 00:33:21.306, Speaker C: All right.
00:33:21.330 - 00:33:55.938, Speaker B: But you know I, as I recall that works. Okay, so that may be a good sort of mini exercise, but has anyone checked, has anyone in the, well presumably Siddharth dagger. It was him. Yeah. Okay, so presumably he's checked it. I would guess so. But has anyone else by now checked that if you square even one third works too? Well that's a bit wishy washy.
00:33:55.986 - 00:33:56.970, Speaker C: I mean I just did it.
00:33:57.002 - 00:34:08.504, Speaker B: Okay, good, good. Okay, that's a different matter. Yeah, don't, don't pull your punches. Might dislocate, might dislocate your shoulder.
00:34:08.844 - 00:34:09.664, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:10.564 - 00:34:29.804, Speaker B: And, okay, but that's, and by the way, these, these two examples take one over n everywhere in the n matrix. Okay, what's the trace? Yeah, okay, interesting. Yeah.
00:34:30.264 - 00:34:31.044, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:31.384 - 00:34:36.204, Speaker B: Well you might say it's not interesting because if it's always the same. Well yes.
00:34:53.244 - 00:34:53.984, Speaker C: Well.
00:34:56.244 - 00:35:18.884, Speaker B: It'S, that's a very good question. But by the way, in terms of idempotence and ranges, the module approach, the range of an idempotent is a vector space acting on, if it acts by left multiplication on colon vector and.
00:35:20.824 - 00:35:21.136, Speaker C: It.
00:35:21.160 - 00:35:24.248, Speaker B: Turns out the, and that subspace will have a dimension.
00:35:24.296 - 00:35:24.936, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:25.120 - 00:35:56.164, Speaker B: Well turns out the trace of this is important is equal to the dimension of the substrate of the range. Okay, that's an exercise. Almost everything I say is going to be an exercise, okay? I'm afraid. But so I hope people are. This is getting recorded, but I would hope that it's that you're making notes, suitable exercises or mini exercises to. You don't just. You don't only have to do Mister Laos suggested exercises partly from the book.
00:35:56.164 - 00:36:52.054, Speaker B: Okay, so if you have an idempotent in a matrix algebra acting on column vector space, then the trace of the idempotent is a matrix is equal to the dimension of the range. We've just tested it in the case of a one dimensional range. Okay, by the way, what's the vector in the range? So we know from this general principle that the range of the decidempotent one half everywhere is a subspace of column vectors of dimension one. Well, if it's of dimension one, that means it's generated by a single vector, right. This vector won't be unique because any non zero scale or multiple will be another such vector. But what's an example of such a vector?
00:36:53.114 - 00:36:53.894, Speaker C: Yes.
00:36:57.314 - 00:37:19.178, Speaker B: Okay, good. And we're. Okay, we were just talking about two by two, but you're writing it horizontally. I'm taking the version I learned where you multiply on the left and it's a column vector. Okay, but then you're saying take the vector that has the same entry, one over one half or one n. One over n everywhere.
00:37:19.226 - 00:37:19.938, Speaker C: Okay.
00:37:20.106 - 00:37:57.594, Speaker B: And this. Well, is that really true then, that the. That's in the range. How do you, so how do you get that vector in the range of this item pole? I'm looking for? Let's just do it with two by two. So you have one half, one half everywhere. And your claim of do I have is your name on Elizabeth? I haven't got.
00:38:04.984 - 00:38:05.416, Speaker C: Okay.
00:38:05.440 - 00:38:11.244, Speaker B: Yeah. Shaoha. Okay, so getting. I was getting very close to it anyway. Yeah. Okay, good. All right.
00:38:11.244 - 00:38:43.514, Speaker B: I mean, I've got to have some system to learn things. All right, so we're looking for some vector ab column vectors like the. That this is equal. It's taken onto itself by this idempotent matrix. And the question is, is it true if you take the same. If you take one half, one half. All right.
00:38:43.514 - 00:38:45.834, Speaker B: But I would say that's.
00:38:48.134 - 00:38:48.502, Speaker C: Okay.
00:38:48.518 - 00:38:56.122, Speaker B: That's certainly true. It's interesting why one would take. And it's also true if you take one. One.
00:38:56.178 - 00:38:56.774, Speaker C: Right.
00:38:57.234 - 00:39:07.250, Speaker B: So, yeah, so it's slightly, it's open to matter of taste to some extent what you take as the vector.
00:39:07.282 - 00:39:07.906, Speaker C: Okay.
00:39:08.050 - 00:39:19.710, Speaker B: But it's nice to see the vector. And so, and this proves it's in the ray. If it's, if the matrix on it is equal to itself, then it's in the range.
00:39:19.742 - 00:39:20.126, Speaker C: Okay?
00:39:20.190 - 00:39:58.466, Speaker B: But then before you knew it was equal to itself, maybe it's a better, maybe there's another way to see it's in the range. And there's a way to see it where you get one half automatically because a simple vector that act on to operate on is one 10 right, 10 down the column. So and if you look the matrix one half everywhere acting on one, the column vector 10, then you get one half all the way down. So in some sense it's actual. So anyway, thank you. Okay, good. So that's the partial answer of why the trace is important.
00:39:58.466 - 00:40:31.284, Speaker B: Perhaps it's also important because it's unique with certain properties. In fact, I think it would already be. You could say that it's unique with the properties that for an item that we just said it's a linear functionality. And if on acting on an idempotent it gives you the number it gives you is the dimension of the range of the idempotent, then this determines it uniquely. Okay, that's an important property. That's a determining property of the trace. So definitely.
00:40:31.284 - 00:41:09.938, Speaker B: Is that a clear enough exposition? I mean, if I write everything down, then I might as well prepare the week ahead of time and bring it on the slide because. Because it would, I would already be at the end of the hour close, getting closed anyway. But anyway. But I'm assuming that you prefer to hear me talk more than to write more. I'm open to comments on that. But to me, talking is the natural writing is what you do in secret.
00:41:10.026 - 00:41:10.774, Speaker C: Okay.
00:41:16.514 - 00:41:21.914, Speaker B: Maybe, maybe brief notes to record something that's been discussed.
00:41:22.074 - 00:41:22.814, Speaker C: Yes.
00:41:26.874 - 00:41:28.654, Speaker B: I thought you were going to say from the camera.
00:41:45.764 - 00:41:46.504, Speaker C: Well.
00:41:49.204 - 00:42:29.784, Speaker B: Okay, but why don't we. Where did you see that? This is a very good idea. Very good. Very good quotation. Yeah, well, he's. The late John Rowe is a famous, well known, very well known leading worker in the field of non communicative geometry. He was at Oxford originally and he was invited by Professor Nigel Higson to move to the University of Pennsylvania State University.
00:42:29.784 - 00:43:27.442, Speaker B: Professor Higson is participating for this fall term in the fields institute. So he's giving a course on alternate days of the week. I mean, I'm on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and he's on Tuesday and Thursday. Actually. His lectures are quite spectacular. So I'm telling you this at my own risk, so I won't tell you that they're 1030 in the morning, okay? But so tan may go over here. Here? No, um, Henry who? Okay, do you have a question? Do you have an answer? Can you talk? Can you, can you.
00:43:27.442 - 00:45:07.254, Speaker B: Well, okay, but can you comment on the trace? You want to comment on the trace? This is a, you know, this could be an essay topic or what is the role of the trace? What is, how important is the trace? Maybe you have to think about it a bit and get some ideas or look up some source, but John Rose book might be a good source, but. Well, Jalal Kakasham Alexander code do you have any questions about the trace? Okay, but do you think you can do, have you, have you taken a record of the exercise involving the trace that the trace of the idempotent is equal to the dimension of its range? When you consider this acting by left multiplication on call vectors. But that's very good exercise. Is it clear what the exercise is? Okay, well, I would suggest that you put that in your assignment. Well, it's not an assignment, it's a chosen exercise set. Okay, I think that's a very good suggestion that could be preliminary to writing an essay about the trace. The role of the trace in operator algebra.
00:45:07.254 - 00:45:35.934, Speaker B: It's extremely important. It's not always unique. Some algebra have more than one trace with using another property of the trace. You say the trace is zero on additive commutators, which additive commutator of two elements of an algebra. Xy is xy minus yx. Have anyone, has anyone seen that formula before? Xy minus y x. Okay, good.
00:45:35.934 - 00:46:45.754, Speaker B: That's called a commutator. If you have a linear functional, an additive commutator if you like, because for invertible elements, you have multiplicative commutative, the elements in a group, you have a Boolean group, you have multiplicative commutatives. But if you have the trace, if you find a trace on an algebra as a linear function over to zero in additive commutators, then it's also unique up to a scalar multiple for matrices, for matrices. But if you take the direct sum of two matrix algebras, that's what a finite, that's typical for a finite dimensional seaster algebra by the way, the finite direct sum of matrix algebra of various sizes, various orders. But if you will, if you look at the direct sum of two sea structure has a trace, then those two traces will give, will give you two independent traces on the direct sum algebra. That's quite common. In fact, one thing, I was one thing that came up quite often at the meeting this week at the field institute on operator algebra.
00:46:45.754 - 00:47:09.424, Speaker B: Symmetry. Structure of operating algebra was the question of traces. How many traces were there on an algebra? What did you do with. What did the simplex of traces look like? How many people know what a simplex is? Yeah, good. There are finite dimensional simplices and those everyone is familiar with. Okay, like a tetrahedron. That's a simplex.
00:47:09.424 - 00:47:22.664, Speaker B: A three dimensional simplex. What's a two dimensional simplex? What is in the two dimensional space? What is a two dimensional. What is a two dimensional symbol?
00:47:25.404 - 00:47:26.144, Speaker C: Well.
00:47:30.324 - 00:47:55.808, Speaker B: The line is a degenerate triangle, but it's one dimensional, okay? And that's why. So that's why I said in two dimensional space. What's a two dimensional impact? Because you have a one dimensional. Any simplex can sit in any space of higher dimension. Yes, charlie? Yeah, well, yeah, right. This is just a triangle. Maybe, say non degenerate triangle.
00:47:55.808 - 00:48:23.548, Speaker B: But you were saying that with your fingers. Okay, fine. Good, good. Yes, good, good. Well, okay, but yours was isosceles. Yeah. Has everyone heard the sort of parable or apocryphal story with a moral about the modus oscillates triangles? The school classroom.
00:48:23.548 - 00:49:08.974, Speaker B: School classroom machine that the teacher asks the student to prove that the opposite angles in the Australis triangle are equal. Okay, well, I think in Greek, esophagus means equal side to equal sign. But anyway, that's not a proof. But it's getting close because the idea is to use side angle side to prove. Well, that's so what? Well, the usual proof is side angle side with. With a perpendicular right to the base. Okay, but what the student said was just lift the triangle up and flip it and put it back down again.
00:49:08.974 - 00:49:49.416, Speaker B: Yes, but that is very. What, so what congruence theorem is that using both side angle side, right? Or no, you could say it's side angle side. You could also say it's a side side side three side, because flipping one side will not change the length. Okay, but the point was the unfortunate ending to the story. But the teacher said you're not allowed to do that. Pick it up and put it back down again. Now, the irony is that if you write it out in the way you're told to write, we put in mathematical proofs triangle ABC and triangle CBA.
00:49:49.416 - 00:50:14.544, Speaker B: That's perfectly precise. Okay, so. Well, all right, I was. Let me just preview for a few seconds. Let me preview. Didn't get through the names. I'll start at the end next time.
00:50:14.544 - 00:50:16.824, Speaker B: That's a warning.
00:50:18.564 - 00:50:19.424, Speaker C: Okay.
00:50:21.364 - 00:50:44.564, Speaker B: So let me quickly preview the next installment of UHF algebra. You can see I was going in that direction. By the way, this is one way to tell they're different, right? Because the special element in k zero is different for all. Okay, that's, that's the complicated way. That's the advanced way.
00:50:44.604 - 00:50:45.062, Speaker C: Okay?
00:50:45.148 - 00:51:59.442, Speaker B: The easy way is to forget about that there are algebras and just take them as linear spaces and look at the linear dimension. We discussed that, okay? And so that's for sure. These are definitely non isomorphic as algebra. But then what did was say, taken in modern language, a little more, little more simplified language, maybe what Gwim said was, take some infinite collection of these things and take the infinite tensor product, which is perfectly well defined, say, in an algebraic sense, as an algebra, then how do you tell when these are different? How do you tell when they're the same and when they're different? Because there are many ways of choosing different matrix algebra and getting the same infinite tensor PI, even the same finite tensor product. As we discussed, if you take, if you take. Well, my arithmetic is a bit slow, right? But I'm doing the addition rather than modification. But the idea is that the trace will do it.
00:51:59.442 - 00:52:05.146, Speaker B: That's what the experience contribution. He was really thinking about k zero, but implicitly.
00:52:05.170 - 00:52:05.594, Speaker C: Okay?
00:52:05.674 - 00:52:11.090, Speaker B: And I, I took him literally on that, and that's how I, that's how I, that's why I'm here.
00:52:11.122 - 00:52:11.854, Speaker C: Okay.
00:52:13.594 - 00:52:26.754, Speaker B: As opposed to some other, some other job, maybe. But picking up cleaning what Cleveland Dixmay did was extremely fruitful.
00:52:26.794 - 00:52:27.494, Speaker C: Okay?
00:52:28.154 - 00:52:43.124, Speaker B: So that's why I want to emphasize their paper idea. Also. It's in the book, it's in the textbook, it's on the curriculum. And you have any questions about the syllabus or curriculum, by the way, send me an email.
00:52:43.624 - 00:52:44.176, Speaker C: Okay.
00:52:44.240 - 00:53:28.968, Speaker B: But the point is that the way Dixme is secret for classifying these algebra, telling exactly in terms of the prime decomposition of supernatural numbers that we were discussing, discussing last time. You have the prime decomposition of ordinary natural numbers, and then formal infinite products have a similar unique prime fact prime power decomposition. And you can determine that by looking at the trace. There's a trace on the infinite tensor product. If you have to renormalize it, you take the ordinary trace on matrix algebra and renormalize it so it's equal to one on the unit. So you divide by the order of the matrix algebra. But then on tensor products, it's compatible.
00:53:28.968 - 00:53:53.544, Speaker B: Okay, take a tensor product of three matrix algebras, and you look at the normalized trace. Restrict to the three subalgebers, you get the usual trace, normalized also on the unit of the subalge. Okay, well, that's. I think we've. We don't. I think we have to give up the room today, but thank you for attending.
