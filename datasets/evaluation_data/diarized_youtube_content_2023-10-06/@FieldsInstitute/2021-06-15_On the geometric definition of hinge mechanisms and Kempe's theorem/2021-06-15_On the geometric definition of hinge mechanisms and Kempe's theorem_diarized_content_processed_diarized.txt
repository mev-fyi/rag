00:00:07.480 - 00:01:48.608, Speaker A: Famous campus. Therium says it was in his work on a general method of describing playing curves of the nth degree by link work 1876. And this work doesn't contain any statement of any theorem. It contains only a method. And different people state this ethereum as something like this bounded part of plane algebraic curve can be drawn by a hinge of some plane hinge linkage moving with one degree of freedom. It was. I thought that this theorem was in that work of Kemper was proved by him for a century, for a century.
00:01:48.608 - 00:04:17.630, Speaker A: But it was found that Kempez arguments are incomplete in maybe first in this work of Hopcroft, Joseph and Whitesides. The next development of this theme was in works of Jordan, Steiner, Kaposch and Milson, King and Keane in the end of that millennium. It it is based on abstract definition of mechanism, mathematical definition. This definition is convenient for mathematicians, but it is not traditional. It is not in the sense of engineering. Some other results in global results were also proved obtained. And I make different definitions of a mechanism hinged, which is consistent with the meaning of the word mechanism in engineering.
00:04:17.630 - 00:05:10.564, Speaker A: It was in 1994. In this paper you see, in engineering there are two main types of structures. First mechanism is a movable flexible structure. It can be moved continuously from any position to each other. They are investigated in the theory of machines and mechanisms. And the other type are rigid structures or trusses. And they are investigating building mechanics.
00:05:10.564 - 00:06:30.944, Speaker A: Give my definition of hinge mechanism. The first is hinged structural ski. It is an abstract connected graph without loops and multiple edges with the vertices of two kinds. Circles are corresponding to three hinges, not pinned, and crosses corresponding to facet or pinned in plain hinges. The hinges are revolute pairs. In mechanics, edges of a graph correspond to levels or bars of this mechanism. Structural scheme doesn't contain edges.
00:06:30.944 - 00:07:54.584, Speaker A: This is a mistake. Connecting crosses, it upgrades on circles are also connected, like here. It doesn't be so because these two parts of this device are kinematically not connected. This moves independent of that. And to study one mechanism, I take only this part. For example. The other steps are a fastened hinged scheme is a huge structural scheme, plus the positions of the first and.
00:07:54.584 - 00:10:21.624, Speaker A: And if we have a fastened scheme, we have a rigidity mapping or h function, which is written here with all the hinges in the plane, where e I is the position of a hinge in the plane, and dij is a square of the distance between hinges PI and pj. Small is the number of bars, m is the number of hinges. Kinematic hinges scheme is a fastened hinge scheme plus a collection of squares of the length of levers or buzz rods framework. It is a point in the right space, when here framework is a point in the left space. This is an example of rigidity mapping the simplest way one. And in my definition, the configuration space of a linkage is a connected component of a pre image of kinematic scheme, component of positive dimension. This two linkages.
00:10:21.624 - 00:12:25.410, Speaker A: And this is not linkage. This is a rigid framework. And if I have such definition, I must say that configuration space of a linkage is not always an algebraic said it is. Maybe it is not convenient from the point of view of mathematics, but it must be so from the point of view of mechanics. Are there any questions on these definitions? And an abstract definition is that the configuration space of the linkage is the whole preimage containing traces and different linkages. In my understanding, it is not natural when we are speaking about campus theorem, to think so that all this is one linkage. All the pre images one linkage.
00:12:25.410 - 00:13:48.914, Speaker A: There are two linkages and address. Now I'll say a few words about difficulties with Cam pairs. Proof with compassion theory. What is, what is maybe wrong in the proof or in campus matter. There can be deals with blocks, which compounding them. Here comes to that mechanism drawing curve that we want to draw. And for example, one of these blocks is multiplicator.
00:13:48.914 - 00:15:20.434, Speaker A: It involves counterparallel grams, this one and this one. And when this mechanism makes from one angle, twice these angles, another such angle. And this contra parallelogram has an undesired diffusion motion. It may transform in parallelogram, when all its hinges come on straight line. And to avoid this. And this is undesired construction. And block doesn't work properly.
00:15:20.434 - 00:17:16.763, Speaker A: And to correct this problem, people add an edge to this construction. It prevents to transform parallelogram to contra parallelogram. They said, for example. And there are they can make additions of edges, so that contra parallelogram will not be transformed into parallelogram. So also this method is contains in the works of Abbott and power. These methods of bracing of parallelogram or anti contrast. And they obtained by this bracing and repeating compares arguments.
00:17:16.763 - 00:18:53.174, Speaker A: The following theorem. Let p be the projection of r two m to r to the plane of positions of a hinge. And ethereum is the following. For a plane algebraic curve a and the point p on a, there is a circular enclosed neighborhood o in the plane of the point p. And mechanism with configuration space. Okay, for which the projection of this configuration space on the plane of positions of our hinge is coincides with in this neighborhood with algebraic age. But we can obtain from campus arguments without any bracing, only the following theory.
00:18:53.174 - 00:22:30.582, Speaker A: I mean, this is the strict meaning of that Kemp did for a plane algebraic curve a and the point p on a. There is a mechanism with configuration space k and circular closed neighborhood of the point p, as well as a spherical closed neighborhood of the point where a framework on configuration space that the projection of this configuration space of a path of configuration space in this neighborhood w coincides with this algebraic. This is a picture what I have said, w neighborhood is there and who neighborhood is here. And when you are drawing a curvy, it is not important that the points from other mechanism can be projected in this point p is only important to this configuration space connected there. And the only corrections of Kemper's argument are in the choice of the origin of coordinate system used in his proof. And this and directions of coordinate axis. The angle theta must be very smaller than fee, because in this difficulty, maybe when these two summons are equal each to other, and we can easily avoid this difficulty, then they are equal each to other.
00:22:30.582 - 00:23:23.094, Speaker A: In this. In this block, the counterpart become on one line and that is a befurcation. And this is treated in mile in my book in Russian. That's all. Thank you.
00:23:27.154 - 00:23:53.094, Speaker B: Thank you so much. Let's thank the speaker. I just had a question. So there was a paper by Steve Power, I think, just trying to figure out whether it was published and where it was published, but it's on archive, I think it was from 2017, where he pretty much gives the same correction, I think, to Kempe's proof.
00:23:54.474 - 00:24:38.874, Speaker A: No, no, he power. He insists on breast parallelogram. But if we don't see on these points, which far from p on the configuration space, we may use not breast parallelograms.
00:24:39.414 - 00:24:40.314, Speaker B: I see.
00:24:44.414 - 00:25:40.654, Speaker A: This is without any breasting. Only by choosing this system. Yes, yes. He also chooses the system, but he says that we must use breast, because he take into account another five points from this point of configuration space. And if we change the formulation of the ethereum compares arguments are sufficient.
