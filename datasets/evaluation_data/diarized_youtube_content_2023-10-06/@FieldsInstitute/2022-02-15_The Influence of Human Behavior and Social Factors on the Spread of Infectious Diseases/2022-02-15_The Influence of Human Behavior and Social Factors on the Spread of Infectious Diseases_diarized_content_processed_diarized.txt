00:00:00.320 - 00:01:43.548, Speaker A: Everyone, I'm very pleased. Today we have the opportunity to have professor sugar back to the field institute after many years of involvement with many activities. Fields Institute Professor Shugu Yuan has a very strong academic root in Canada. He, he received his PhD degree from University of Alberta and then started a junior research fellow at the Fields Institute when the institute was inaugurated. And with physics side at that time, Waterloo, and he became a faculty at University of Harvard and there he also was awarded killing award and then he moved down to University of Miami to a great north of canadian mathematics with Professor Yang kept coming back to Fields Institute for coordinating variety of activities, editing some of the special issues with the Fields Institute and thank the next field activity. He is going to co organize the workshop in the summer. And Professor Yuan is now a professor in University Miami where there he also was awarded corporal fellow by the faculty of University Miami.
00:01:43.548 - 00:02:10.004, Speaker A: And he is on the editor board of many important mathematical biology and especially infections disease modeling journals, including the DMC infectious diseases. And today I'm very glad that he's here and to share his progress in modeling the influence of human behaviors and social factors. So, Professor Shukui.
00:02:10.944 - 00:02:50.342, Speaker B: Yeah, Jianhung, thank you so much for introducing fashion. It's really an honor for me to come back to fields because I started my career there. Well, it's one of the mentioned, one of the first set of pastas. I mean, it's just unbelievable. It's been 30 years, it's kind of old. So today I'm going to mention something to me, even new, which is the influence of human behavior and social factors on the spread of infectious diseases. I'm going to present more result from other people, introduces some concept and ideas.
00:02:50.342 - 00:03:34.114, Speaker B: Instead of reporting what I've been doing. Okay, before doing that, let me mention, let me quote what Newton once said. I can calculate the movement of these stars, but not the mannings of men. After the study, the famous South Sea bubble. So from infection disease, you can see this is the madness of men. Or I mean, the social behavior for humans is complicated. So basically, especially after the Covid-19 there's tens of thousands, thousands of papers modeling the COVID and other infection diseases.
00:03:34.114 - 00:04:35.288, Speaker B: And simply put it this way, you just try to give an example. So what do we usually do? You classify the population into four different categories. The Suzette group, the infectious group, the recovery group and also when you have vaccine, you have vaccinated groups. Most of the time we just write down four equations for each group and using certain functions describe the. The transfer from one group to another group, for example the beta here intentionally I write it as a function of t s and I. This is the transmission rate between the infectious and susceptible individuals and gamma is a recovery rate and phi is the vaccination rate and precise the veining rate. So when most of the time when we write models we just simply take let's say for the better usages.
00:04:35.288 - 00:05:19.654, Speaker B: Beta as a counts and times as times is the so called mass action and gamma is just proportionally the infectious recovery. And same thing for the vaccinated group is some certain percentage of people is going to be vaccinated. We wrote this kind of form automatically. Was this enough to describe the vaccine, the recovery and so on. When we consider the social factors, the human behavior to start with, let's consider vaccine. I mean here now when we expect. When talking about everybody knows vaccine because of the Covid-19 and this is certainly, this is a huge.
00:05:19.654 - 00:05:45.886, Speaker B: It depends on human behaviors. The decision whether to vaccine or not is completely personal decision. It's not mandatory. Some of them mandatory, right. And most countries in fact apply a volunteering compliance when wesing is talking about right. And not because vesin has a side effect. Right.
00:05:45.886 - 00:06:52.834, Speaker B: And if the vaccine does not protect you, even hurt you more. Of course that's not a good idea to take the vaccine, which makes sense. Also there's another idea. It's called free riot. Because if the majority, because of the religious reason or other belief or due to lack of awareness and if a majority of people vaccinate the rest, which is small fashion, can a free ride, right? So in another hand, if you decide whether or not to vaccine according to self interest, then the herd immunity may completely different from what is best for the whole population compared to the mandatory vaccine. So when we talk about vaccine, especially talking about the humans attitude, the us general public's attitude toward the vaccine, we needed to mention the famous research fraud on the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and autism. This is a very famous story.
00:06:52.834 - 00:07:53.938, Speaker B: In fact, what happened is in 1998 a doctor whose name is Andrew Wakefield, a former UK physician and his group published people in the Lancet. In the paper, they show that they study a new syndrome called autocystolitis and raised the positive link between autism and the MMR vaccine. They claim that the parent of AIdS. So they have a sample of twelve kids. They claim that eight of the twelve had symptoms, which is they described the behavior symptoms with MMR and report that the onset of these symptoms began with twist of the MMR vaccine. So they link eight of them related to the vaccine. So this is a huge story.
00:07:53.938 - 00:08:32.262, Speaker B: And then this is filled with the vaccine scan and then consequently, the, the anti vaccine movement worldwide. Well, there was some people against the vaccine, but this just, you know, put a fire on that movement. The claim in the paper were widely reported, leading to a sharp drop of vaccine rate in the UK and worldwide. Okay. And because for them, this is missile. And there was a whole generation was not well vaccinated. So the 2019 vaccine outbreak worldwide was a consequence of this fraud.
00:08:32.262 - 00:09:36.124, Speaker B: And this is the data shows you, okay, because 2019 is about 20 years later, you can see this huge increase of number of infections worldwide in more than 40 countries. So in fact, this is fraud because later on, people tried to question him, tried to find out what's going on. So the investigator found that the doctor had multiple undeclared conflicts of interest, had manipulated the evidence and data had broken other ethical codes. So consequently, in 2010, Lanson retracted paper. At the same year, the UK General Medical Council suspended his lessons. He cannot practice in UK anymore. But the damage is there already because 2010 is more than twelve years after the paper.
00:09:36.124 - 00:10:49.990, Speaker B: However, the damage was done worldwide anti vaccine movement already started and continues to now. In this event, the whole thing was characterized as perhaps the most damaging medical hawks of the last 100 years. And then even now, if you go to Facebook and Google and Amazon, you can see tons of anti vaccine argument and books by famous people, celebrities and politicians, even our former leaders and so on, right? And this movement still keep going and even toward the COVID vaccine, because this data was reported by the NPR and PBS network. The pool shows opinions about more than 1000 United States adults. The question was that if a vaccine for the COVID virus is available to you, will you choose to be vaccine or not? So at the beginning, you see this is at the end of 2020, around 60% people said yes. Okay. And around 10% says no, I'm not sure.
00:10:49.990 - 00:11:31.560, Speaker B: But more than 30 says no, I will not take it. So of course this data changes. Those who say yes, all vaccined also say not sure. Some change ideas because they went vaccine, but those who say were not. What I mean, around about 10% change, but there's still closer to 20% say snow. Okay, so even less. I don't know what happened in Canada, but at least in Florida, there's a lot of stories in the summer, in the last year, in the summer, because there's many people didn't take the vaccine and got infected and passed away.
00:11:31.560 - 00:11:59.964, Speaker B: There were news about that. For example, in August 1 story is just that this guy is 28 years old. He got the very thing that he passed away. And the church decided to hold a vesting campaign at his funeral. Of course, an agreement with his family. But this report didn't say how many people were vaccinated. In fact, there's another story.
00:11:59.964 - 00:12:22.618, Speaker B: And also in August, this guy, in fact, is a deputy. So he's. He was 32 years old. They have. He had five kids, which is tough, right? And he didn't vaccine. And then he got infected and passed away. So the police department also church organized activities, you know, vesting activity.
00:12:22.618 - 00:13:00.474, Speaker B: And they reported that 94 people, in fact, you know, in those. In those days, organized by the family, in the church. So you can see this is sad story. But this sad story contributed positive other people to do so. This also shows you the people, the psychological factors is there. Because then people, when those people see their friends or relatives died from COVID without vaccine, they rethought about that and maybe make different actions. So this figure to show you, I just downloaded from this morning from the website.
00:13:00.474 - 00:13:22.172, Speaker B: This is the COVID data, even for my mid eight. And this is the. You can see how many outbreaks? 1234. This is the fourth one. This is the hardest one. So the solid means the cases, the bars indicating the vaccination. You can see the vast nation population is increasing.
00:13:22.172 - 00:13:43.584, Speaker B: This mommy date probably has the highest vaccine rate. Now in whole Florida, there's more than 5.75 million people infected. Even in Miami, we have 1.16 million people infected. The population is 2.77. So it's almost 40% people get infected.
00:13:43.584 - 00:14:33.764, Speaker B: So this is a big deal. Okay, so now talking about vaccine, when we do modeling, what we need to consider, there's one method is taking the theory game into consideration. So, there's a concept called Nash equilibrium. And so, in game theory, the natural equilibrium is the most common ways to define the solution for a non corporate game involving two or more players. So if each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategy of other players, and if somebody wanted change, nobody will gain, then that strategy is called national equilibrium. A famous example is the so called president's dilemma. So you have two president a and b.
00:14:33.764 - 00:15:12.886, Speaker B: They got caught. They are suspected to commit a robbery together, but they are isolated and they are argued to confess. Now, each is concerned any about getting the shortest possible sentence for himself. And each must decide whether to confess or without knowing the other's decision. And however, they both know that first, if both confess, then both go to jail for five years. If you need to confess, both go to jail for one year. Third way is if one confess, another does not, then the confessors get free and the silent goes to the jail for 20 years.
00:15:12.886 - 00:16:04.690, Speaker B: So the best solution is do not cooperate. You know, you know, think about themselves. So if they both come back and go to the jail for five years, this is the best. Okay, so in other words, this is a Nash equalibrium is selfishly, uncooperatively is the best for their both interests. Okay, so taking the game theory, putting the game theory into epidemic model was a hot topic. And one of the early papers by the Canadians, you know, the Chris Bouch and David Earn, they published paper in the PNS in 2004. So the western game has each member of the population of n individuals play a strategy.
00:16:04.690 - 00:16:23.564, Speaker B: So the western with the probability p. Okay, so that's the strategy. So this is. So of course there's two riskies. Here is the risky from the infection from the disease. Another risky is from the vaccine if the ratio of the two riskies is r, which is presumably it's a constant. So this is.
00:16:23.564 - 00:16:48.898, Speaker B: I'm going to come back to this ratio later on. Now, let's use p sub PI to represent the risk of infection. If a fraction of p individual is vaccined. So then the expected payoff of the individual plane spread p is, you know, the negative r, the ratio times p minus p. P times one minus p. So that's the expected payoff. Now.
00:16:48.898 - 00:17:40.898, Speaker B: Now suppose you have a p strategy, p, which is at Nash equilibrium if no players can improve their playoffs by switching to a different strategy queue. Okay? So then in this case, suppose a fashion epson of the population vaccinates with probability p and the remaining with probability q. So the overall coverage, of course, is the epsilon times p plus epsilon. One minus epsilon times the remaining q. Right? So then you can know then the. The, uh, payoff, of course, is e PI of this p of this p minus your r, and of course, minus the difference of the two strategies. This is the, um, the expected payoff, okay? Now, if you switch, okay, then you switch.
00:17:40.898 - 00:18:34.862, Speaker B: Of course, this data e gives you a measure for the incentive for you from changing from q to p, or vice versa. So therefore, even giving any risk r, there is always a unique strategy p, such that the payoff is strictly positive for our strategy, which is different from p, and for any proportion of epsilons when epson is between zero and one. So this is the concept, this is the basic notations. Now, in the paper, they consider a standard sir model. So you can see the equations here and the only thing is here p. P is the vaccine rate or vaccine update rate. So beta is the transmission rate and one, or gamma is the infection period.
00:18:34.862 - 00:19:11.636, Speaker B: So we know that the basic protective number can be found explicitly, which is better over gamma plus mu. And if we know the basic result number, then the critical coverage of vaccine can be determined, which is p critical. That's certain ratio of certain percentage of individual we needed to vaccine in order to eliminate the disease. Of course, that depends on r zero. If r zero is less than one, then this is zero. Your r is greater than one. This one over one minus one over r naught.
00:19:11.636 - 00:19:59.856, Speaker B: So that's also what we use to. To estimate how many people we needed to vaccine for Covid. So therefore, then the probability of if somebody is not vaccine, then the probability of infection is PI, sub p. That can be given in terms of the r naught and the probability p, which is one minus one over r naught minus p. So therefore, we can, we can find the natural equilibrium. Okay, for this case, remember, PI, sub p is the probability of infection with a certain population p infected. If p equals zero, and especially if the ratio, that means the ratio of get sick, whereas you get sick because of vaccine.
00:19:59.856 - 00:20:29.194, Speaker B: If the r is greater than that, then of course, the zero is the Nash equilibrium. We don't need to worry about that. On the other hand, if it's less than PI naught, then you can find the equilibrium equilibrium, the Nash equilibrium, which is one minus one over r naught times one minus r. So the r plays a very important rule. Remember, r is the ratio again. So this is the unique equilibrium. Now, your r is greater than zero.
00:20:29.194 - 00:21:20.848, Speaker B: So that means it's impossible to eradicate disease if you use voluntary policies. Okay? On hand, if r is greater than one, that means the vaccine is more harmful than the disease itself. Then nobody, of course, would take it. So finally, if r is less than one. Okay, remember, I think when Chris Fouch and David was studying the problem, they had the UK fraud in mind. So they were trying to see how that vaccine scale affected the missile program. So their conclusion is that when r is less than one after vaccine score, even if perceived vaccine risk is greatly reduced, it will be relatively difficult to restore the prescript vaccine coverage levels.
00:21:20.848 - 00:22:21.890, Speaker B: That exactly happened. Because before that moment, vaccine for missile was like 90 something. Now is 80 something. It's 20 years later, still not back to that level. So, in other words, what I'm trying to say is that when we try to model, try to consider vaccine, maybe we just cannot just say vaccine rate times a population s. Maybe a little more involved. In fact, in the follow up papers, Chris Bouche and then other people, they shows that, I mean, they use a step function to describe the western rate, okay? And also, in fact, there's quite a few other papers talking about taking the game, the western game into consideration.
00:22:21.890 - 00:22:55.850, Speaker B: Especially this is a survey paper, like here. This one is a very long paper, more than 100 pages. Try to studied the vaccine by using statistical physics method. Also recently I went to talk from China. They proposed the model to study the vaccine games in Covid. So he used a function like a combination of things. So you have to consider different factors.
00:22:55.850 - 00:24:09.296, Speaker B: So in other words, maybe the vaccine rate is not a simple constant times the s population. So that's the first part I'm going to mention. So the second part is social inequality in vaccination disease. So, inequality result from society organized by hierarchies of class, race, gender and many other factors, okay? That in fact, unequal distribution, access, resources, rights, okay? So social inequality is characterized by existence, equal opportunities and reward for different social positions or status within a group of society. So it contains structured and recurrent patterns of unequal distribution of good, wealth and opportunity, reward and punishment and so on. So of course then for in fact, as in fact this is about talking about this is also distributed unevenly through the society in which the vulnerable, the poor people bears disproportional burden. There are many studies showing that, for example, some years back there was showing in fact, as everyone knows about malaria.
00:24:09.296 - 00:24:57.450, Speaker B: So in Africa, some poor families were not able to afford the Bennet, which is treated with insecticide. And also when those family were poor, because when they got infected, they were not able to search to looking for treatment on time. So in that new fact, those infections gonna stay in that status longer, which cause more infections. And because they are poor, they got infected, which make them poor. So this is very typical cycle. And also some years back I was studying the habitat C in China. I was puzzled by the data.
00:24:57.450 - 00:25:51.438, Speaker B: So the geographical distribution of HB cases in China was kind of strange. So along the east, the coast, east side of the country, including Shanghai, Beijing and then and also Guangdong and so on, the cases is lower, but in the middle part is higher. In the west it's much higher. Later on we found out, in fact, in 1992, in fact, the HB vaccine was discovered, was tested in China. And China was the first country to use the vaccine. But in 1992, the minister of house recommend the virus to the general public, but were not free. We cost 159 un remedies at that time, which is a big amount of money.
00:25:51.438 - 00:26:33.316, Speaker B: So any of those rich family, a rich family in the east part or some in the middle part were able to afford that. So that caused this problem. Okay, so this is again another. This is socioeconomic inequality because the full family will not afford to vaccinate their kids and let all the kids get infected. So some years later, the government probably realized that. So in 2000, 920 eleven, the government retroactively immunized more than 60 million young kids younger 15 years. But the problem was there already cause the problem.
00:26:33.316 - 00:27:40.330, Speaker B: This is again social inequality. So five years ago there was a survey paper published in the Norwegian medical Journal. And the survey was about the two influenza pandemics in 20, 1829 and which shows that the EU countries, including also United States and Canada, Australia, and in those countries, the poorest family, poorest people suffered the highest risk of infections, having a severe disease in both cases. Also, even for this Covid-19 there were papers published in New England, Journal of Madison. Also in Nature, the poor people, certain immigrants groups, black people and certain native people once again are paying the highest cost for the current pandemic. So this is so obvious. So again, going back to the figure, I showed you the diagram here.
00:27:40.330 - 00:28:08.896, Speaker B: So in other words, now you're talking about the infectives. You know, usually we take it for granted, the constant gamma times I as a recovery. But according what we say, that the poor family will not afford that. In fact, that's not a constant. Maybe that depends on many of other factors, social inequalities, social economy studies. But how to do that, honestly, I don't know. But this is certainly something we needed to look at.
00:28:08.896 - 00:29:01.100, Speaker B: Maybe I can show you one of the examples I did before. A few years back, we had an NIH grant working on vector bone diseases in the Middle east. We studied the rift valley fever in Egypt and some other countries. We did consider this systemal change and socioeconomic status. So what happened is here. So we have a virus which is called rifle valley fever, which is among animals basically including cattle, sheep and camel and goats and so on. Human can get infected biolus through handling the animals because the virus was originally found in Reef Valley in Kenya in 1931.
00:29:01.100 - 00:29:27.820, Speaker B: So this is named the reef Valley fever. Okay. The outbreaks of the virus reported in sub saharan in Africa, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Okay, this is the virus looks like. Okay, so the five major objects coincide with either the pink season of the mosquitoes or the timing of the great Barren. Okay. Or it's called the feast of sacrifice.
00:29:27.820 - 00:30:45.206, Speaker B: So this adila adaha, this is the largest Islam festival, at which time very large number of livestock are driven towards the side of the fest. So in Egypt, Arabia and Yemen, outbreaks may occur when the disease introduced by importation and transportation of animals. So it was reported that usually more than 1 million of ship, more than 750,000 from Somalia and 350 from southern, from Sudan were imported by a company for this project. Okay, let me try. So this festival fails on the 10th day of the 12th month of the Islam ruling calendar. So it creates a particular periodicity of times of high potential for the Arabs, because the river flood stage follows the solar, I mean, the calendar, which is 355 days, while the religious feast festival, this is lunan calendar, is 354.37 days.
00:30:45.206 - 00:31:37.004, Speaker B: So these two events will coincide perfectly every other 33.57 years. So in order to arrive at the rendezvous that is the denial delta, well, millions of the Muslims celebrate the festival by ritual sacrifice of Rama. After long distance travel, people travel by food, by train and so on. Okay, so they, what are they? I'm going to show the map. They start from Sudan and follow the Nile river and then from the south to the north, and then travel to the southeastern part of Saudi Arabia and along the Red Sea. Okay, so this event, in fact is, why is it socio economic? Okay, here, this is the map.
00:31:37.004 - 00:32:19.266, Speaker B: So this is from Sudan along the Nida river, Nile river and Yip, and then to Saudi Arabia. And this event is socio economic because every family makes a contribution, and the contribution depends on your status, economic status. If you have rich, you have a big family, of course you can read more for them. You can build a camera or big animals. If relatively rich, you may contribute proportionally small. And if we are not that rich, then you can contribute sheep or gold. And if you are poor, you don't, then you contribute the labels.
00:32:19.266 - 00:33:12.106, Speaker B: Okay, so this is completely socio economic activities. Okay, so at that time it was supported by NIH, and then in one of the early papers published by one of my former students, Dao Jo, published in brutal mathematics. So we use a patch model. We use three patches to describe the three locations so that you have movements from each patch. And we study how those moments contributed to the outbreak of the, of the problem. So in the paper published in the plas, in the labotropic disease, we generalize the model by considering the periodicity. So you have the annual change of the rivers and the seasons, and also you have the annual movement of those people doing this kind of gathering.
00:33:12.106 - 00:33:38.346, Speaker B: So you can see the coefficients are periodical so the directions in the dash represents the seasonal or socionamical driving flows. Okay. Driving flows here, the driving floors here, okay. All right. So we did lots of simulations and this is the simulation of the model. And we pair solutions. Especially we could have resonance cases, because you have two periodical going on.
00:33:38.346 - 00:34:53.404, Speaker B: As I mentioned, every 33 years the two coincides. Also we studied, if you study to the daily increasement of the movement. So if you move faster, how that's gonna affect the disease outbreak? And if you, you know, let's take a long time to prepare. If you start earlier, you start later. How that gonna affect the outbreaks and so on. We did lots of simulations, but in summary, in this study we proposed almost a periodical three patch model to investigate the transmitter damage of the refrivated fever among the ruminants with spatial movement. So this simulation shows that in the northeast of Africa, the human activity, including the social festival, along with the combination of climate change, such as rainfall, socio economic factors and hydraulic hydrological environments that will all contribute to the transmission and disperse of the disease.
00:34:53.404 - 00:35:37.044, Speaker B: So spiritical. All the big may occur when the two events occur together. First, you have a lot of animals moving on. Secondly, you happen to have the to see somewhere, then they have large number of mosquitoes, then definitely they're going to have outbreaks. So this is showing one example. So the last part I'm going to mention the influence of the psychological fact. So, in the late seventies, the italian mathematician Caposa and his co author public paper in mathematical bioscience.
00:35:37.044 - 00:36:04.884, Speaker B: So they studied the chiral epidemic in Bahrain in 1973. And they introduced a saturated incidence rate. So nothing better. Times I times s. In fact, it's g of I times s. To model the so called cross effect and protection measures. Moreover, they introduce a phenomenon which is called the psychological effect.
00:36:04.884 - 00:36:57.986, Speaker B: What are the factors? So now, in fact, we experienced that when you're talking about Covid-19. So if the newspaper and tv and social media report very large or increased number of infected individuals, then those people who are not infected would be cautious, will take actual measures and protect yourself. So, because you take the measures, of course, the interaction between the infectives and sustepos is going to be reduced. Because you see now large number of sustainable will take protections. So in other words, when the number infectives increase, the infection in fact decreases. So this. So in their paper, they even give this figure to describe the sociopsychological factor.
00:36:57.986 - 00:37:51.910, Speaker B: Because the psychological factor, the infection rate decreases when the number in fact is increased past certain numbers. So they gave this figure here. But in the paper, they did not give any specific function to describe such incidence. So a few years back, I was, me and my classes tried to see whether or not they were able to find a function to describe this kind of curve, the sociopsychologic factor. In other words, the question was how to characterize the psychological factor using the specific function. What is the impact, the psychological impact on the dynamics of the model? So we can go back to the one of the early papers by 711 Yuvasa and 711 student wei min Liu. So in their paper, they proposed a very general incident function.
00:37:51.910 - 00:38:54.438, Speaker B: So k times I to the power, l times s divided by one plus alpha I to the h. This the denominator, 1 hour, the denominator, one over one plus alpha times I describe this psychological factor. Okay, so, of course, the, the l and h are important, okay? Now, if h equals zero and, and l equals one, that's the standard in the mass action, right? We know that now. So also, because there are two integers here, two powers, l and h. When h, when l is greater than h, of course, then the function, just like the standard bilinear function, the function is unbounded, right? Increase. And there's a case where when the two equal, when l two h, then you have saturation. This is just like the mechanism m and function.
00:38:54.438 - 00:39:25.360, Speaker B: However, there's a case when the power in the denominator h is greater than l. For example, when l one h two, then you can see the function goes up and reaches a maximum and then decrease. So this is similar to the figure cap also proposed. Maybe we can use this one. So that's what we did in 2007, my career dome Xiao and then I published paper in the math Web Science. So we use this function. So the numerator here I is the power is one.
00:39:25.360 - 00:40:10.720, Speaker B: In the denominator is two. As I mentioned, ki measures the infection force of a disease, and then the ratio here, this measures the psychological factor from the behavior change of discipline individuals, the number increases. So you've put this one into the standard sir model, where you can find the basic reduction number. It turned out that dynamics is pretty standard or pretty trivial in the sense that when the basic product number is less than one, this is free. Equilibrium is globally stable. Otherwise, when r naught is greater than one, then you have an indemnity equilibrium, which is also globally stable. From the math point of view, this is clear, this is trivial, okay? But that doesn't tell you too much about the impact of the psychological factor.
00:40:10.720 - 00:41:05.090, Speaker B: But if we look at carefully okay, we did some simulation. So say, suppose this is the number of infectives, okay? And as I mentioned, that the alpha, okay, the alpha effects the. That's a psychological factor. When alpha take different values, you can see the number infectives drop dramatically, right? If alpha is larger, you could have like 150 people in fact, and then 100 people in fact, and then less than 50 people fed. So the psychological fact does affect the dynamics, in the sense affect the number of infectives, the behavior, I mean, the long term behavior, that's maybe not, not so obvious, but it does. It does. Okay? So this is one of the cases.
00:41:05.090 - 00:41:52.564, Speaker B: So, in fact, later on, we found that maybe mathematically we can do a little bit more. Say, for example, we keep a function like that, a more generalized number ten, and such incidence function, like you have quadratic terms in the numerator, correct terms in the denominator, but then you have a parameter beta, which does not have any biological meanings. It just changes the shape when beta take different values. If beta equals one, the function is increasing. When beta equals zero or beta equals negative 0.5, then you can see that you have the saturation effect. But when beta becomes negative, but is greater than negative two r squared of alpha, then again, it's increasing and decreasing.
00:41:52.564 - 00:42:45.224, Speaker B: So if we change, replace that, the previous one by this one, then the dynamics no longer trivial. It's going to be much, much more complicated. You can have a lot of interesting dynamics. For example, you're going to have a weak force multiple of two, and you have a cusp of codimension two. And you could have all kind of application, including set knob application, magneto, taking the condominium to hot application, and even the general hot applications, okay? And even we. By the way, this paper is by colleagues from central China, normal university, and Pei Yu from western. And we show that, in fact, in some case, we have two living cycles, which are showing more complicated dynamics.
00:42:45.224 - 00:43:30.604, Speaker B: And in another paper we just published, if the numerator is linear, then the model could have three limit cycles. The dynamic is no longer trivial if the function takes a little bit more complicated ways. And also, we use this model to simulate the data, to inference the data from mainland China, data from 2004 to 2017. So this dashed data gets read and the solution is from the model. Okay, so that's the simulation. We kind of simulated the data. So the model does make some sense.
00:43:30.604 - 00:44:39.414, Speaker B: Okay, so, in summary, what I'm trying to do, what I have tried to do, is to try to show you that human behavior and social factors play very important roles in the spread of infectious diseases, understand the difference of them on the spread of disease can be a key to improve the control efforts. I think everybody's convinced that because of the Covid-19 this is just daily lectures for everybody. Of course you believe in vaccine. I recently some recent studies on the inference of human behaviors with rare diseases and also studies or data on vaccine decision using national equilibrium strategy to impact the social inequalities and influence of psycho factor will review this. So I presented some result also present more problems because there's some points are very important. But even I mentioned I don't know how to model properly. But in the next project, maybe when we try to model some infection diseases, maybe we needed to consider them.
00:44:39.414 - 00:44:42.614, Speaker B: So that's what I want to talk about. Thank you very much.
00:44:43.874 - 00:44:51.994, Speaker A: Thank you Shugwei and this is very nice. Also indicating changing.
