00:00:00.280 - 00:02:29.454, Speaker A: Good afternoon. We were looking at the Pascal triangle of the order group. If you get from it, by the way, instead of z one, if you weren't talking about af algebra, the order group of real numbers at every place you put that particular order group. And then you have embeddings in the finite graphs on the copies of your basic group at every stage into the next stage, the union. This is an order group. And it turns out that, well, first of all, as a group, it's pretty easy, pretty simple to see that you can think of it as the polynomials. Right? Everyone taking a look at that.
00:02:29.454 - 00:04:23.850, Speaker A: Harley, are you okay with that? So by the way, in the applicant host or moment problem application, we were, we were saying in the prescription, we put the moments down, the moments to the left hand points in every row. Okay. And what that means is it's natural to do that and then fill out the, fill out the diagram in a unique way so that the sum of any two adjacent numbers gives you the preceding number, common preceding number. By the way, remember the housewarf solution to the housewarf, the sequence of, sequence of numbers, positive numbers, is the sequence of moments. In other words, um, integrating integral or from x to the zero x to the one x squared and so on over the integral zero one x. Your measure from integral with respect to x plus x to the zero is equal to one. This is not a proof so much.
00:04:23.850 - 00:06:27.614, Speaker A: It's just a statement that you could also say if you don't need to range things that pass, you can just say, look at the higher order differences, first order differences, because these functions are decreasing on the interval, moments get smaller, then they are, then the differences, the differences, the differences are going to be positive and get smaller. But so what that suggests is that you should look. So now we're putting aside, while we're just looking at the ordered group and we're noticing that it seems to be natural to abstract the dice to polynomials that x with some order structure coming from point evaluated. Considering the polynomial function, that's, well, I don't know if anyone would guess that that's true. Anyway, purely outright, if we get into an order structure, if associate these generators at the first stage, and then already you get a generating set for state, then you get monomials associated to all the other points too. And you can say that those monomials are positive x and one minus x. So the boundary diagram of folks as those are positive.
00:06:27.614 - 00:08:08.374, Speaker A: So that's, so that's the order structure of, let's say, sub p for pascal, pascal, the semigroup, semi group generated by x to the other. N equals one, n equals zero, one generated by these. Well, if it's coefficients in z, coefficients in q, then you have rational, positive rational. By the way, one thing you see with this is that it has what I would call in the order set. Each one is bigger than the other elements. Separate them like this. In a special case that there is a single element in between that's called the Reese interpolation.
00:08:08.374 - 00:08:25.678, Speaker A: Two papers in the other, but I think it's 42, it could be 40.
00:08:25.726 - 00:08:26.314, Speaker B: But.
00:08:28.934 - 00:10:30.140, Speaker A: And for order group is what an x is, the properties are equivalent. I mean the recent work of recent triple hook something called the reach decomposition. The reason I'm mentioning that is that it means you can avoid the virus cross theorem to show that the ones who brought the point wise order when these polynomials are dense and continuous. You don't need to know, you don't need to know the interpolation properly if you're willing to quote, because once you know that the order structure, and you could just say you could be looking at Z x plus with respect to, okay, here, capital p stands for point wise. That's why I was telling it. I was told the point wise, meaning on the strict strictly greater than zero on the open, that's a quote of my positive poly zero together with the polynomials are strictly positive on the integration zero to one. But if you find, now it turns out these are the same equipment, these are the same positive code.
00:10:30.140 - 00:12:11.524, Speaker A: If you don't know that, and you just look at the point wise one, then if you might want to know, it might ask, might occur to you to ask whether or not it has the interpolation problem and you have to prove that. But if you know that it is the same as the one that comes from the barley diagram, then it's obvious, because every stage you have the interpolation properties. So for the union they do too. So, okay, so if you want to get the solution, talking about positive functionals on this order group, it's easy to see that those are just parameterized by sequence sequences that we're talking about. You put positive numbers to these points and then you show in the diagram all the entries should be positive. That's what the positive functions are on this pascal order group. And as soon as we know that this is, well, we know it's the same as the point wise order in that open interval.
00:12:11.524 - 00:12:57.152, Speaker A: And then we get extend to quite an interesting proof that the two order, the two semi groups are the same two order structures on each. Yes, okay, so cone group is a semigroup, right?
00:12:57.208 - 00:12:57.704, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:57.824 - 00:13:34.412, Speaker A: Both under this syndrome and contains zero. Well, if you say, look at the semigorp monomial. Oh, you know, I wrote it down. I'm sorry, I left some out. Is that what you were going to say? Oh, okay, but that's quite important. Let's go look at what you want. So, look, I've got.
00:13:34.412 - 00:13:51.904, Speaker A: Well, yes, those would be positive. Okay. But I left out the other ones. I left out the one minus x. Okay, so. So it's not just x to the n, it's x to the n times one minus x, maybe to the, um. To the, uh.
00:13:51.904 - 00:14:15.474, Speaker A: N minus k. Okay, where k goes from. So n is zero, one, two, and so on. And k is a is zero, one, two up to n. Okay, so. Well, no, it could be larger. Just n m all monomials in x to the n and.
00:14:15.474 - 00:15:20.734, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's the, it's a semi group generated by zero and x to the n one minus x to the m, where n and m zero. That's the positive tone for master Pascal. Thank you for giving me a chance to notice. I know those you noticing in particular that if you write a polynomial in the US away in terms of power, then something that polynomial was positive. I guess if and only if. Well, no, no, it would be positive if the coefficients are positive. Positive.
00:15:20.734 - 00:16:08.254, Speaker A: But there are other polynomials that are positive, too. For instance, one minus x coefficients are not positive. That's what, it's an interesting order relation. Even when you just look at very elementary algebraically, then this other problem with functions, and that's often to say, let's look at positive functions that are positive pointwise. Well, it turns out that this is, these particular functions, they're positive point wise. Well, that's easy to see. Put in some number between zero and one, you got something positive.
00:16:08.254 - 00:16:49.106, Speaker A: And if it's strictly between zero and one, that's something strictly cause. But it's a delicate question through the converse. Okay, so I'd like to take a look at that, because it shows off some important methods. Question. Is there a hand up? We're including zero. I'm curious, which hand was up? Sorry.
00:16:49.290 - 00:16:53.534, Speaker B: So we're including zero in the pascal semiconductor.
00:16:54.274 - 00:17:18.668, Speaker A: Well, also another one. Oh, okay. Well, sorry. Yeah, sure. I mean, zero is always positive. Okay? And large, large swaths of mathematics considered positive. And whereas some, some, sometimes people say positive be the sort of the opposite, non negative, which is kind of bizarre.
00:17:18.668 - 00:17:40.487, Speaker A: That only works for totally ordered sets. Right. Look at the first quadrant. If you look at the plane, first quadrant. Well, negative then means the third quadrant. Right. So what does non negative mean? It's a union of three quadrants.
00:17:40.487 - 00:17:58.664, Speaker A: Okay, but that shows that. Yeah, that shows that. Be a little careful about. Well, thank you.
00:18:04.524 - 00:18:18.864, Speaker B: We can have a polynomial, which is like say zero, x equals one half, but it's still everywhere else. So that would, that wouldn't be in the pascal.
00:18:20.934 - 00:18:22.114, Speaker A: Which wouldn't be.
00:18:23.254 - 00:18:25.422, Speaker B: Oh wait, no. Okay, you just never mind.
00:18:25.518 - 00:19:28.674, Speaker A: Okay, well, I'm claiming these two semi groups are the same, and it's obvious one is included in the other. And so I think it's a very good exercise, very good question, to look at this elementary point of view and try and prove the converse without using fantasy functional analysis. If it's behind the screen. No, no. Just for the way it works out, either to be identically zero, or it could be strictly positive on the open interval being just created at or equal to zero at the endpoint. That's how it works out. And if you want to approximate continuous one, if something is small in this order relation, then it's small everywhere, right.
00:19:28.674 - 00:20:35.594, Speaker A: It's a small point, one less than or equal to epsilon. Well, you have the constant function. It's less than or equal to the quantum epsilon. Let's say we talk about rational, something is strictly point is that there's, when you talk about approximations, there is to choose between saying less than or equal to epsilon, or is less, strictly less than epsilon. So as long as epsilon is not zero, then it doesn't make any difference. So the reason I'm saying that is we want to approximate continuous functions and normally take the super, which is less than or equal, strictly less than, less than or equal to at the end point. That's irrelevant as far as approximating.
00:20:35.594 - 00:21:02.974, Speaker A: And the point is that, well, there are two ways of approximation. Let's not worry about the approximation of continuous functions. It is important to know that this cone is the same as this. Okay. There should be, hopefully with elementary proof. Okay. But not going to use the handbag.
00:21:02.974 - 00:21:13.626, Speaker A: Yes. Good. You have an idea? Yeah.
00:21:13.650 - 00:21:18.094, Speaker B: Like we just considered, like sort of like I feel like.
00:21:18.474 - 00:22:25.904, Speaker A: Okay, let me just take the question a little more thoroughly. We have p of x is in z of x, or q of x or r of x is not great. And let's say p of t is strictly greater than zero. Zero. And the question does this imply x equals some sum of x to the some coefficients of ajiaijx to the I one minus x to the greater than or equal to zero? You were looking at that, yeah. Okay.
00:22:30.764 - 00:23:24.454, Speaker B: All the polygonals which are like. Because otherwise when we evaluate it at one, we get a negative. And so because there's less negative signs, you can basically just like group up negative ones of positive ones and then factorize. So that every psychological, and then if there is a number which is like a plus one or a minus one, because I think essentially what ends up happening is because it's sort of like x squared is sort of like.
00:23:29.034 - 00:23:29.322, Speaker A: You.
00:23:29.338 - 00:23:45.162, Speaker B: Have like a minus two x squared, there's no way you should sort of like, I might be wrong with this, but somehow, in some sense, it's like if you try to like majorize the negative x squared by like x, for.
00:23:45.178 - 00:23:45.934, Speaker A: Example.
00:23:47.674 - 00:23:52.814, Speaker B: The only, like number in front of x, which will actually be negative two.
00:24:00.294 - 00:28:02.814, Speaker A: It'S real q or an r vector space. And the reason that you have a positive cone which is closed under multiplying by the positive q plus hole present plus one half inventor. Actually, I don't, this is not very small, very similar finding certain. Oh, what's, well, it's certainly true for the, certainly true for the point wise order. Actually, that's not quite clear. Right. And then you apply it, to apply it here.
00:28:02.814 - 00:31:32.784, Speaker A: And there's a corollary. The theorem is that if you have a subgroup sub vector space contains the order unit contains what? And you look at the relative order that we replace equals. If your partners are functional. And the conclusion is that such a space, the. If I gave five, by the way, that's not necessary. Note that you can't. It just happens that sufficient to know and, well, um, not true.
00:31:32.784 - 00:34:05.124, Speaker A: But now being extreme point points are just going to be the point evaluation. And the reason you can see that is this is a ring. And jason points are just, last time I pointed out that scale, the limit was, I claimed that that was really because you can multiply again, zero. That doesn't happen for polymer. So it's not, there's no way, look at it has a natural range. And in order to make functional one x, one minus x, that means it's multiplicative for every number. That's what, that's what your data point is.
00:34:05.124 - 00:38:48.024, Speaker A: Okay, so how are we going to use this? Okay, so now we want to prove motor somewhere, someone like 7000. No, no, two others. How do we apply the parlor? So of course I have to say, but equal to the sum. Okay, so, so what I want to do is look at one and three, that's two polymers. I want to look at the one and g are probably independent. No, q squared. And since the order unit greater than anything else in here, so anything in here through a cone, by the way, every cone can look like.
00:38:48.024 - 00:42:24.418, Speaker A: Otherwise it's going to look like this. That means it's certainly not in the interior because where it is, it is not in the anterior. There's certain types of apply positive. 5151 is equal to one, PI of t is equal to zero. It's two dimensional vector space and null space is here, non zero. Oh, by the way, but I don't know, it's strictly positive because it might be zero by zero. So I have to handle some special cases, that's all.
00:42:24.418 - 00:45:14.754, Speaker A: Extreme ones that says that 50 greater than zero. Each one shows premium pm. All right, that's case one. And this is not a contradiction. A priority, because a priority five is just defined on the substrate. Here we have a function which is not a zero and it's equal to zero. So what that says, what does that say? What's the conclusion? Yes.
00:45:14.754 - 00:46:54.684, Speaker A: How many other cases are there? Well, it is positive. It is certainly positive in the integer. Then it's going to be strictly non zero over there. Okay, that's. But I guess I should say or g of one. So sorry that you, you know, it's rip dark. So that's why I was just leading up to the subject.
00:46:54.684 - 00:48:24.824, Speaker A: So one is zero. What do we know? Because. Well, let's review. First of all, if b is zero, zero. Therefore that's. This is an ordered ring. Positive elements, too.
00:48:24.824 - 00:52:06.264, Speaker A: Product is too positive, by the way, from zero. Same thing as the reach. Approximate all continuous function, approximately wait value. Using the interpolation problem, for every point you close in a neighborhood, and we want it to be less than equal to everybody. There's a polynomial that's got to be closer than that. Finitely many contact us at the interval because this is finite. So that's the household.
00:52:06.264 - 00:54:48.014, Speaker A: But that's what the measure is, actually. In that case, it's very easy to write, but it's a little hard to prove exactly. Suppose you have any projection here squared. Then you look at e to the two power by eight that maps into one. Therefore this it, and on, right.
