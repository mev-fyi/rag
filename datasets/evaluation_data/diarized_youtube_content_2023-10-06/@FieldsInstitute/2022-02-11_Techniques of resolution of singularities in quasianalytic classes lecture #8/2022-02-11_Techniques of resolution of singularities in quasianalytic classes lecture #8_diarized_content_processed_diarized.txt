00:00:00.320 - 00:00:30.504, Speaker A: Okay, so, good afternoon or good morning for everyone. You are one of the brave people that stayed until the end of the course. Today I'm going to talk about the idea of the proof of modernization of morphism. And this is probably the talk that I was looking most forward to. So if you stick to with me up until here, at least this one, I had pleasure preparing it. Hopefully it's going to be something that's understandable too.
00:00:31.084 - 00:00:32.340, Speaker B: So let's do it.
00:00:32.532 - 00:01:13.518, Speaker A: So I want to talk about now the idea of the proof of modernization of morphes. And up until now, what we have done was to make considerations on the target and to talk about applications of the result. Today, my deeds talk mainly about the source of the morphism. But before that, I want to restate the, the result in a little bit different way. And I want to start by motivating why. So, in the problem of, in the problem, in the theorem that we had, we had a hypothesis on phi, right? So I started with a question, why.
00:01:13.686 - 00:01:18.354, Speaker B: Phi of m to n proper?
00:01:19.294 - 00:01:38.774, Speaker A: So why are we asking to be proper? And the reason we can see with a, with a simple example. So suppose that we have phi from a disconnect. So it's going to be a countable, disconnected set. Here, let me take r, just r. And I'm going to index it with.
00:01:39.114 - 00:01:41.134, Speaker B: I in the natural numbers.
00:01:41.714 - 00:01:44.614, Speaker A: And this is going to arrive in r two.
00:01:46.114 - 00:01:48.294, Speaker B: R two is the target is rn.
00:01:48.774 - 00:01:58.478, Speaker A: So it's not going to be a proper morphism. And in here, let's call it phi, the restriction to each one of these ri's, which is simply a function from.
00:01:58.526 - 00:02:01.926, Speaker B: R to r two, and which is.
00:02:01.950 - 00:02:04.638, Speaker A: Given by, say, u, which is sent.
00:02:04.686 - 00:02:09.286, Speaker B: To u squared, u two to the.
00:02:09.310 - 00:02:16.470, Speaker A: Power I plus one. So if we recall the, the idea that we had when we talked about.
00:02:16.502 - 00:02:18.462, Speaker B: The target, we're going to see that.
00:02:18.558 - 00:02:20.374, Speaker A: This morph is like once we fix.
00:02:20.414 - 00:02:23.870, Speaker B: The ri from r to the power.
00:02:23.902 - 00:02:30.874, Speaker A: R. Just what is going on here is that we're sending here to.
00:02:32.894 - 00:02:33.230, Speaker B: A.
00:02:33.262 - 00:03:22.818, Speaker A: Cusp given by the equation x two I one minus y square equals to zero. So for each y we have a different cost. And we noted that in order to resolve, in order to monomialize this morphism, we must. So in order to monomialize by I, we need. Well, we need to resolve this curve. And resolution of discourse means making at least I plus two boilings up. So when y was equal to one, that was the cusp, it was x three minus y squared was the case that we treated in details.
00:03:22.818 - 00:03:24.426, Speaker A: So, in general, if we have a.
00:03:24.450 - 00:03:31.394, Speaker B: General I, we need to perform I.
00:03:31.434 - 00:03:49.084, Speaker A: Plus two blowing up in the target, all of which are going to be in the same r two and are going to project into the same, in the same point, the zero zero, which project.
00:03:54.304 - 00:04:04.064, Speaker B: Into the origin of r two.
00:04:05.524 - 00:04:52.496, Speaker A: So this is showing that indeed you cannot, you're not going to be able to monomyllize these morphes here, because if you consider all of them, you would have to have an infinite, infinite number of blowings up of the point, which like you have to project, blow up the origin and then blow up again a point and then blow up again a point an infinite number of times. So you're not going to be able to finish this process in the target. At least if you stay here with the target, you would have to use countable many copies of the target, and then this is not going to be a locally finite hovering. So you're going to have problems of this form. So really, the reason for choosing properties that certain extent is to avoid that you have too many relations in the target. You have a countable number of relations. You want to have finite ones.
00:04:52.496 - 00:05:16.724, Speaker A: So keeping things proper means that your fiber is going to be compact. And therefore any relation that you have, you can just find a finite number of relations in the target. And this you can resolve. So we could restate the theorem in the following form, you know, apparently weaker form, but which actually implies the other.
00:05:17.384 - 00:05:18.724, Speaker B: And doesn't need proper.
00:05:20.624 - 00:05:41.304, Speaker A: Phi of MD to ne. The qomorphism, quasanalytic morphism. Let us fix a point a in.
00:05:41.344 - 00:05:46.364, Speaker B: M and b is the image of a.
00:05:46.664 - 00:06:24.160, Speaker A: Then what we can do is that there exists a neighborhood v of a. Well, not only one neighborhood and w of p and a finite number of commutative diagrams. It's going to be a local version of the resolution of singularities locally at a and b. And here we're going to go to.
00:06:24.192 - 00:06:38.044, Speaker B: V D, or the restriction of D to v. I. Correct this, we have our original morphs Phi restricted to v. Maybe write it down, v.
00:06:42.244 - 00:06:45.544, Speaker A: Lambda. Here we're going to have.
00:06:48.804 - 00:06:49.784, Speaker B: Lambda.
00:06:50.084 - 00:07:01.748, Speaker A: So now only find that we don't need cobra countable many, many of them such that, as usual, sigma lambda and tau lambda.
00:07:01.876 - 00:07:04.996, Speaker B: So we note it as one are.
00:07:05.020 - 00:07:08.484, Speaker A: Finite compositions.
00:07:12.024 - 00:07:18.280, Speaker B: Of local lines up and.
00:07:18.312 - 00:07:19.484, Speaker A: Power substitutions.
00:07:25.704 - 00:07:29.936, Speaker B: Through PI lambda lambda are.
00:07:29.960 - 00:07:31.444, Speaker A: Semipropper coverings.
00:07:37.644 - 00:07:40.464, Speaker B: Entry by lambda's monomial.
00:07:42.804 - 00:08:19.856, Speaker A: So this recalls us. What is the theorem that we're trying to prove today, or that we're going to understand, the idea of the proof ended at the beginning and noted that we are going to restrict ourselves to some neighborhood. So in here we could have done that, right. If we just restrict to a neighbor for each one of the points, then the relation is just a cusp. So we can do it. We won't need any, any condition for the amorphous tube proper. It's just when we want a covering of the entire varieties here and we want it to be countable, then it's necessary to add some hypotheses either on phi or to do some little bit of topology.
00:08:19.856 - 00:08:22.000, Speaker A: But essentially the result, the technical result.
00:08:22.032 - 00:08:23.484, Speaker B: That we need to prove is this one.
00:08:24.124 - 00:08:51.124, Speaker A: Okay, there's a local version of the modernization, so let me start by talking about its proof. Okay, so first of all, this result here, we see that then, since we're going to restrict ourselves to some v in the source and some w in the target, we may suppose as well that the target is rn. We may suppose.
00:08:53.704 - 00:08:54.984, Speaker B: That the target n.
00:08:55.064 - 00:09:49.164, Speaker A: Is equal to rn. And this allows us to start the process already with some fixed coordinate system and therefore write the morpheus in a special way. Consider phi given by the first entries that we appear here fn. So we are now in our end. So we can just write phi in terms of the. We take one of the coordinate systems and we phi, phi in terms of discordant systems in the target. And we will monomolize by one entry at a time.
00:09:49.164 - 00:09:52.968, Speaker A: What does it mean? It means that we're going to consider.
00:09:53.056 - 00:09:55.672, Speaker B: This Morpheus here, which I'm going to.
00:09:55.768 - 00:10:57.564, Speaker A: Call it pk, given by the first k entries. And we're going to prove by induction on k that we can monolize the next one. Okay, in time, we will suppose, we will assume, we will argue by induction with zero. Zero is just a constant function implies we may modify, we may modify the source and target. So that ck plus one, which I recall, that is just ck.
00:10:58.724 - 00:11:02.464, Speaker B: And the last entry is mono.
00:11:04.444 - 00:11:11.184, Speaker A: So that's our, that's the idea. One thing that we can support in this structure here.
00:11:14.604 - 00:11:17.424, Speaker B: Yeah. Remark. We may suppose.
00:11:22.764 - 00:11:51.836, Speaker A: That the Mars is five. K is dominant. That is the generic rank of it. The generic rank is equal to k. This you can always do. Because we may as well suppose that if there are some zeros, we may just take away the zero entries. We don't need to consider it, right? And just consider again and continue the induction.
00:11:51.836 - 00:12:20.784, Speaker A: But we follow those entries, it becomes even simpler. So we may as well suppose that all of the entries of the p k are different from zero, and that p k is going to be monomial. So this is kind of the idea. And then we're going to follow three steps. Now I'm going to keep some. I'm going to come back to these steps because the first one, I don't want to state it just yet.
00:12:21.184 - 00:12:21.576, Speaker B: Okay.
00:12:21.600 - 00:12:41.564, Speaker A: I want to keep it for now, open what is going to be the first one? And once we, we are a little bit more advanced and know what we're aiming for, I'm going to come back for it. It's going to be one of this. It's going to be easier than the second step, and it's going to actually be auxiliary for the second step. The second step, we can already explain what we want to do.
00:12:44.064 - 00:12:45.484, Speaker B: Oops, no.
00:12:49.084 - 00:13:17.544, Speaker A: So I'm going to call one b, and I'm calling one because one means that it's only on the source, the things that we're going to modify, or we're going to concentrate ourselves in the source, which is going to be transforming ck plus one into a q function, a quad analytic function. We satisfy a certain normal form, v.
00:13:17.624 - 00:13:21.684, Speaker B: Plus an m, such that.
00:13:23.664 - 00:13:43.852, Speaker A: The first thing is that if we consider this morphine here, we found the g. We found this g is monolith. This morph is monolith. And the second part is that the. And I'm going to write and then I'm explaining. What does this mean?
00:13:43.948 - 00:13:44.704, Speaker B: Oops.
00:13:45.764 - 00:14:19.120, Speaker A: If I take the wedge of dg with up until dc, I obtain that this is zero. Okay, so the reasoning for doing this so condition true implies that the generic rank of pk with the SLS entry.
00:14:19.192 - 00:14:26.752, Speaker B: In g is k. So we have k plus one entries and we know.
00:14:26.768 - 00:14:57.924, Speaker A: That this k by g is of rank k. So we can expect a relation here. We can expect that there's going to be a relation in the target and that we're going to have to deal with it by modifying the target. So I'm going to keep this structure up like this. Sorry, Andre. So m. M is supposed to be what afterwards? M is a function such that a and m monomial is a monomial.
00:14:57.924 - 00:15:03.684, Speaker A: Okay. It's simply a q function. All right? Yeah. Right. It's not a monomial. Whatever.
00:15:03.724 - 00:15:04.384, Speaker B: Okay.
00:15:04.684 - 00:15:41.042, Speaker A: Yeah. Gm q function. Well, in the end it's going to be monomial, but a special monomial, not any. Yes, at the end. Or I'm going to actually write the normal forms that we have in the next remark. I just want to, to finish the three steps and then I'm going to talk a little bit more, but okay, but just to give the definition in this case, once we get this normal form, we call this vk plus one.
00:15:41.098 - 00:15:46.014, Speaker B: Here, which is ck g plus m.
00:15:46.754 - 00:16:00.982, Speaker A: A pre monomial morphine. And the last step, as we might imagine, is to transform premonomorphism into a.
00:16:00.998 - 00:16:13.354, Speaker B: Monomorphism transforming through g equals zero.
00:16:15.134 - 00:16:22.684, Speaker A: Okay, so a couple of comments about this in a Mars mysterious tone. So in order to also address what.
00:16:22.724 - 00:16:24.224, Speaker B: I was just asked. Right.
00:16:26.444 - 00:16:57.974, Speaker A: No, before it. So if we are able to do all of this, then we're good, because if we were able to transform into g equals zero, then we're going to obtain that. Actually, the phi k plus one is a monomial morphe, because the, there's many k's here, but the, the morph is phi k plus one, which is in here, is going to be monomial, because the last entry is just going to be equal to this m. And we know that phi k m is monomial. So then we won. And we follow up by induction. We continue the induction process.
00:16:57.974 - 00:17:11.634, Speaker A: This is the essential idea. So let's comment a little bit more about what premonomial is. So the first thing, what is this? M, right, so m.
00:17:13.504 - 00:17:14.440, Speaker B: Or let me.
00:17:14.552 - 00:17:16.792, Speaker A: Like, this might be, might be.
00:17:16.808 - 00:17:19.404, Speaker B: No, like belongs to.
00:17:20.144 - 00:17:21.404, Speaker A: It's either zero.
00:17:23.344 - 00:17:24.924, Speaker B: It's not right, like.
00:17:26.824 - 00:17:28.044, Speaker A: Because it is not.
00:17:28.504 - 00:17:29.484, Speaker B: Oh no.
00:17:39.964 - 00:17:58.304, Speaker A: M is equal to either zero or u to some power alpha or some u to the power beta. V plus phi. It's one of these forms, right, that we can assume.
00:18:00.324 - 00:18:03.952, Speaker B: The second thing that I wanted to.
00:18:03.968 - 00:18:18.368, Speaker A: Say is an example of free monomial, and the cusp is a good example. So if we just take phi from.
00:18:18.416 - 00:18:20.764, Speaker B: R to r two.
00:18:22.704 - 00:18:25.656, Speaker A: U, that goes to u squared or u third.
00:18:25.720 - 00:18:31.784, Speaker B: U squared, u third is primarily.
00:18:34.044 - 00:19:29.110, Speaker A: Okay, so in this case, I will call phi one equals to u squared, phi two equals to u third. And in this case, the phi two is just equal to g plus m, where g is equal to u three and m is equal to zero. So in particular, this is the part of the proof where we really, so we made an assumption here that we may say that we may suppose, apart from taking away zeros, that the morpheus is dominant. But we do treat the non dominant case, and we treat it in an explicit way, because when we assume that something is pre monomial, we are not assuming that it is dominant. It might have, if the m is equal to zero, then the generic rank is going to be k, right? So it's not going to be k plus one. We are not dominant in this case. And therefore we are dealing with relations in the target.
00:19:29.110 - 00:19:58.602, Speaker A: And this kind of captures the heuristic of why we want to have this division here. The G will have relation will correspond to the relations with the prior of the morphism. So we expect as a second entry here that we will need to modify the target. And that's actually what we do in the part two. We'll modify the target. And we basically modify the source by induction. So we need to modify the source because we need to blow up something in the target.
00:19:58.602 - 00:20:20.434, Speaker A: And then we use result that by induction says that. Okay, there's a commutative diagram, but we're really just focusing on the target. And whenever I write the one in this part here. Once I want this normal form, this m appearing here. This m does not have really. It's not going to be having relations with the previous entries of the morpheus. So unless it's zero.
00:20:20.434 - 00:20:41.878, Speaker A: So this is the part where we're going to modify the source. So the part one here corresponds. Because here we're going to really fix on the source. And we modify the target by induction. So we're going to make modifications of the target. And then of course we need to apply maybe these three steps for amorphous with less entries. And then it's going to appear some modification of the target.
00:20:41.878 - 00:20:44.494, Speaker A: But it's going to use it elements as a black box.
00:20:45.234 - 00:20:45.690, Speaker B: Okay?
00:20:45.722 - 00:20:53.094, Speaker A: And the idea today is to concentrate on this part. Be here for a while. And then we're going to see what is going to perinate.
00:20:55.394 - 00:21:04.254, Speaker B: Okay, this is the plus this path, the source.
00:21:11.294 - 00:21:18.766, Speaker A: We want to start with some sort of question here to lead a little bit for the first observation that we're going to have.
00:21:18.950 - 00:21:22.446, Speaker B: Which is kind of funny question to.
00:21:22.470 - 00:21:24.766, Speaker A: Ask at this point. But why is this not trivial, right?
00:21:24.830 - 00:21:29.874, Speaker B: Why is this not really? Why is the problem?
00:21:38.634 - 00:21:59.692, Speaker A: And by this, there is an idea behind that I think that we might think, or we might consider in an easy way, which is, okay, now we are in a local case. So why don't we consider the ideal I given by the product of all of these I's. And if we want to be fancy and even order this monomial. Because why not?
00:21:59.818 - 00:22:01.804, Speaker B: You can even take the difference between them.
00:22:05.984 - 00:22:19.844, Speaker A: Something like this. And now we apply local resolution of singularity. And we apply local resolution of singularities.
00:22:20.624 - 00:22:28.868, Speaker B: So that we may assume that I.
00:22:28.916 - 00:22:31.428, Speaker A: Is actually equal to u to some power.
00:22:31.556 - 00:22:33.704, Speaker B: Which one did I use? Not gamma.
00:22:34.964 - 00:22:35.828, Speaker A: It's just some power.
00:22:35.876 - 00:22:36.584, Speaker B: Gamma.
00:22:39.644 - 00:22:42.860, Speaker A: So this is a simultaneous resolution of singularity.
00:22:42.972 - 00:22:44.664, Speaker B: Sometimes this is called random.
00:22:45.324 - 00:22:47.104, Speaker A: So in this case, then.
00:22:50.684 - 00:22:51.420, Speaker B: What happens.
00:22:51.452 - 00:22:52.820, Speaker A: Is that you're going to have each.
00:22:52.852 - 00:22:56.022, Speaker B: One of the entries is going to.
00:22:56.038 - 00:23:02.030, Speaker A: Be given by some u to the power alpha one. And I'm going to write here, cuv.
00:23:02.142 - 00:23:02.794, Speaker B: W.
00:23:05.174 - 00:23:06.246, Speaker A: C n is going to be.
00:23:06.270 - 00:23:13.510, Speaker B: Nu to the power alpha ncnuvw.
00:23:13.662 - 00:23:59.774, Speaker A: And we know that this c's are units because each one of them have to divide this u gamma. And then therefore they have to be a new to some power times something or a unit or something. So if we do data, assuming that none of these phi's are zero, right, take away the phi's which are zero, we can, we can bring it to this form. So now why is this not enough to finish? Right. The point is that we still need to absorb this units into the monomial and we cannot do this for all of them at the same time. But in general.
00:24:06.194 - 00:24:12.494, Speaker B: We can't absorb all units.
00:24:14.034 - 00:24:32.486, Speaker A: And the easier way to see this is just by an example, in my opinion. So let's consider the martin here, from c three to c three, or to r three to r three.
00:24:32.510 - 00:24:40.910, Speaker B: It doesn't matter. Let's say that we take x one.
00:24:40.942 - 00:24:44.694, Speaker A: Which is phi one is equal to u to the power three.
00:24:45.994 - 00:24:57.814, Speaker B: The second entry is going to be u to the power three. One plus uv, one plus v two square.
00:24:59.394 - 00:25:02.174, Speaker A: Let's say that x three is equal to.
00:25:04.394 - 00:25:08.810, Speaker B: Three. And I noted here u five could.
00:25:08.842 - 00:25:11.614, Speaker A: Why not v two plus one?
00:25:13.114 - 00:25:22.930, Speaker B: Let me just make it even simple. Oh no, just keep so here, the.
00:25:22.962 - 00:25:53.554, Speaker A: Point is that, okay, every one of the entries are monomial, but we do not have a monomial morpheus yet. And we can see this because the monomial morph is going to have something more rigid than this. So this is a unit we cannot all absorb. If we try to make a change of coordinates here in u and absorb all of this unit into u. So we're going to make a change of coordinates of the form u tilde equals u times the third root of this, of this function here, then we're going to appear a unit in the other part here.
00:25:53.894 - 00:25:54.886, Speaker B: So we're not going to be able.
00:25:54.910 - 00:26:00.594, Speaker A: To get rid of this unit. And another way to see this is that if we make a change of coordinates in the target.
00:26:02.694 - 00:26:06.134, Speaker B: We consider x.
00:26:06.174 - 00:26:55.334, Speaker A: Cubed two equals to x two minus x one. Then this x two is going to be equal to u four v one plus u three v two squared, which is not in monomial form. So there's something more subtle about. More rigid about phenomenal. Sorry, andre, I don't understand your last point. Why would you want x two minus x one to be a monomial? Ah, no, it's just I'm trying to make up because I'm going to try to make a point with the other part.
00:26:55.374 - 00:26:55.550, Speaker B: But.
00:26:55.582 - 00:27:16.014, Speaker A: But you're right, I could change coordinates and then don't obtain morphs again. It's not clear yet. Okay, point. But the first part, just. The first point is clear that I cannot absorb everything. This one is clear. Yeah, yeah, no, I'm anticipating the point that I'm going to make next.
00:27:16.014 - 00:27:59.398, Speaker A: Okay, so what's the point that I'm going to make next is that things are more rigid. And for that I wanted to recall, but in a, you know, like weaker form, monomial morphism, we thought simple normal crossings. So just the definition of what monomial morphine is. But without tearing out the simple normal process, which is a technical point, it's very important for the proof. But. But for today, just let's focus on the heuristic. It's not going to appear the technical details with the normal crossings.
00:27:59.398 - 00:28:03.022, Speaker A: So let's just recall phi of m.
00:28:03.158 - 00:28:11.074, Speaker B: To n is monomial at a.
00:28:11.774 - 00:28:14.874, Speaker A: If there exists coordinate systems.
00:28:21.954 - 00:28:28.930, Speaker B: U v, w at a x y z at.
00:28:28.962 - 00:28:30.890, Speaker A: Phi of a, which you will normally.
00:28:30.922 - 00:28:33.894, Speaker B: Denote by b such that.
00:28:37.674 - 00:29:07.510, Speaker A: Xi is equal to u to the power alpha I, yj is equal to u to the power bj. Bj plus psi j zk is equal to vk. And finally, or zk equals to zero. So here was for I equals to.
00:29:07.542 - 00:29:11.754, Speaker B: One upon two p j from one.
00:29:12.054 - 00:29:16.914, Speaker A: To q k from q plus one.
00:29:17.494 - 00:29:53.754, Speaker B: Up on q s and k here from s plus one went to what we call s. Prime should have written this completely so that we feel happy about it. This is top two r v one goes to versus w, one goes to wt, and then x one goes up until xp, y, one goes up until yk. And then we had k plus one.
00:29:54.174 - 00:30:01.634, Speaker A: Upon t s prime. That was the way that we were given. And we had two conditions.
00:30:01.934 - 00:30:11.174, Speaker B: The set of alphas. Oops, rq.
00:30:12.674 - 00:30:22.934, Speaker A: Not quasi analytic, just q linearly independent form, vector space of dimension p and.
00:30:24.074 - 00:30:27.094, Speaker B: Beta j is q.
00:30:28.794 - 00:31:07.134, Speaker A: Linearly dependent with the alpha one, alpha p. These were the conditions. So we had this nice looking normal form and this extra condition. So we talked a lot about what happened in this, in the, in the, in the target. But now I wanted to. I want to talk about once we have these normal forms a property that is going to be intrinsic here. About this morphe, about amorphous with this form is that the level set is going to be very, very rigid.
00:31:07.994 - 00:31:09.154, Speaker B: So this is the next point.
00:31:09.194 - 00:31:46.544, Speaker A: So following this definition, I want to talk about the level set. The level set is very rigid. So maybe let's start with an example, a couple of examples.
00:31:48.504 - 00:31:49.032, Speaker B: And then I'm.
00:31:49.048 - 00:32:00.280, Speaker A: Going to complete the definition that I want to put here. So let's say that we want to consider. I was going to do, but I think that it's a good thing to do. Let's say that we consider Morpheus five.
00:32:00.352 - 00:32:09.064, Speaker B: From c. Why am I taking c three?
00:32:09.104 - 00:32:11.640, Speaker A: I can take r because I copied.
00:32:11.672 - 00:32:12.564, Speaker B: From the table.
00:32:14.644 - 00:32:15.852, Speaker A: Three reals to two.
00:32:15.868 - 00:32:17.744, Speaker B: Reals e.
00:32:20.604 - 00:32:22.180, Speaker A: And in the first one.
00:32:22.372 - 00:32:31.756, Speaker B: First example, let's take d being u one. U two equals zero and e being.
00:32:31.860 - 00:32:38.484, Speaker A: X one equals zero. And then we have a normal form here, x one or x.
00:32:38.564 - 00:32:39.904, Speaker B: Because there's only one x.
00:32:40.314 - 00:32:51.794, Speaker A: It's going to be equal to u one alpha one, u two alpha two. And then the next coordinate, z, is going to just be equal to z.
00:32:51.914 - 00:32:54.094, Speaker B: To the last coordinate. There is not up here.
00:32:54.474 - 00:33:04.974, Speaker A: So this is our morphism from r three to r two. Okay, so the level sets. In order to compute the level sets of these morphism, I'm going to search for the vector field.
00:33:05.374 - 00:33:05.734, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:05.774 - 00:33:12.194, Speaker A: Level set is going to give us affiliation. In this case, I have something from dimension three. So the level set.
00:33:13.614 - 00:33:16.142, Speaker B: Can you hear me? I can hear you, yes.
00:33:16.198 - 00:33:36.548, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. I've been struggling. Not for very long. Can you insist a little bit on the. Maybe you did already, but on the difference between the definition of monomial morphism without any and with an original definition.
00:33:36.596 - 00:33:40.024, Speaker B: That you gave us the definition.
00:33:40.524 - 00:33:41.212, Speaker A: This one.
00:33:41.268 - 00:33:44.268, Speaker C: This one and the previous definition, which.
00:33:44.316 - 00:33:46.584, Speaker B: I. Oh.
00:33:48.484 - 00:34:07.894, Speaker A: It'S the same. I'm just not putting the condition on the, on the. Yeah, on the simple normal crossings. So the conditions. The conditions was that U was the normal crossing divisor of m and x and Y gave us the normal crossing divisor over n.
00:34:11.154 - 00:34:15.194, Speaker B: Yeah, that's it. I could have added also.
00:34:15.234 - 00:34:16.426, Speaker A: I just didn't want to focus on it.
00:34:16.450 - 00:34:21.134, Speaker C: So. Okay, so you don't have divisors in this case.
00:34:21.554 - 00:34:27.506, Speaker A: No, it's true. Yes, it's true that. And here I didn't need to put a divisor in some sense if I.
00:34:27.530 - 00:34:29.648, Speaker B: Want to follow here. Okay.
00:34:29.776 - 00:34:31.004, Speaker A: Is that why you are.
00:34:31.344 - 00:34:31.888, Speaker B: Good point.
00:34:31.936 - 00:34:32.564, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:33.864 - 00:34:41.192, Speaker C: First is my microphone making a terrible sound because some people look like it's no. Is it okay?
00:34:41.288 - 00:34:42.604, Speaker A: It's okay. It's okay.
00:34:45.024 - 00:34:45.552, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:45.648 - 00:34:54.448, Speaker C: I think I always have trouble understanding the role that the devices plays, play in these, in these terms, but.
00:34:54.616 - 00:34:58.577, Speaker A: Yeah, because you're always trying to, I'm actually going to insist on it with.
00:34:58.625 - 00:35:01.881, Speaker C: A set of devices because you're building resolution.
00:35:01.937 - 00:35:23.333, Speaker A: So, because in the end, what we want to use, what's going to appear is the derivations which are tangent to the divisor too, just as we did in the local resolution case, so that the devices are going to appear right away here. So that's why I feel like I'm going to insist on it now.
00:35:24.074 - 00:35:26.254, Speaker B: Okay, thanks.
00:35:28.714 - 00:36:03.864, Speaker A: So, okay, so the level sets of dysmorphism is going to be given by curves or points, and it's going to generate for us a poliation. So a poliation will be able to see it via a vector field in this case. So we consider the vector field, we consider a vector field x, which I'm also going to assume to be tangent to the divisor. So it's going to be of the form a one, e one, g one.
00:36:06.004 - 00:36:07.904, Speaker B: Why did I take p a.
00:36:11.404 - 00:36:18.994, Speaker A: Two, u two, the u two, and then the b in the last one plus b dv.
00:36:20.014 - 00:36:23.566, Speaker B: Right. And in order to find that it's.
00:36:23.590 - 00:37:03.356, Speaker A: Going to generate the level curves, what we need is that it has to be tangent, which each one of the functions such that x of u one, alpha one, u two, also two. This must be equivalent to zero. And so does x of v must be equivalent to zero. So x of v is just b. So we are just saying that the coefficient b is constant equal to zero. And this other, whoops. This other one is going to give us, since it's going to be there is this u one, u one.
00:37:03.356 - 00:37:06.124, Speaker A: It's going to give us u alpha.
00:37:06.164 - 00:37:20.570, Speaker B: One, u alpha two, which multiplies alpha one, a one plus alpha two, a.
00:37:20.602 - 00:37:37.034, Speaker A: Two that we also want to be equivalent to zero. So this gives us relations on the, on the coefficients a one and a two that we must satisfy. So from this we take that x must be equal to a function a.
00:37:38.214 - 00:37:40.902, Speaker B: Which multiply the vector, because there is.
00:37:40.918 - 00:38:25.174, Speaker A: A relation between a one and a two. So there's going to be a common function a here which multiply alpha two, u alpha one, u two, the u two, this is the terms here that's going to make this part here become zero. And then there's a common factor. So this term here is the generator of the variation of the level sets, which is a linear vector field.
00:38:27.774 - 00:38:28.038, Speaker B: In.
00:38:28.046 - 00:38:59.390, Speaker A: A similar way if I take another example. So, okay, so this was the point I started with this monomer morphs. I realized that the level curves are generated by a vector field which is linear. And if I try something a little bit more involved as an example and consider now, sorry to interrupt again. So you consider the level sets, the collection of level sets as the leaves of affiliation. What is the level of set?
00:38:59.422 - 00:38:59.566, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:59.590 - 00:39:04.238, Speaker A: I'm considering phi equals to constant.
00:39:04.366 - 00:39:04.790, Speaker B: Yes.
00:39:04.862 - 00:39:12.894, Speaker A: So you see that as a Fourier, this, this, I'm seeing that as affiliation. So this is, this is giving me some partition of the, of the entire set.
00:39:13.014 - 00:39:13.674, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:14.134 - 00:39:36.134, Speaker A: So what is being claimed is that if we have this form, u one alpha alpha alpha one, u two alpha two, then the vector field x that we are doing here is going to look like in the u one, u two is going to look like a set of. So you're going to have like this.
00:39:41.154 - 00:39:42.174, Speaker B: The leaves.
00:39:42.474 - 00:40:29.304, Speaker A: And if we change to any other, uh, level here given by some other, uh, v equals to one, for example, is still this kind of saddle vector field given by this one. So it's a family of this, not a family because there's no changing parameters. It's a three dimensional vector field which is, uh, the v entry does not make a difference in every point is just giving us corners. So it's going to be tangent to v, it's tangent to the, to the level sets of v equals constant. And it's going to be also tangent to the level sets of u one a one, u two a two equals constant. Okay, so now u two, u three equals zero.
00:40:31.524 - 00:40:36.004, Speaker B: And e x one, x two equals zero.
00:40:36.044 - 00:40:44.594, Speaker A: So both of them, and let's take x one equals to u alpha one.
00:40:52.374 - 00:40:56.614, Speaker B: U three output three and x two.
00:40:56.654 - 00:41:03.274, Speaker A: Given by u one. Let's say meta one, u two beta.
00:41:03.314 - 00:41:07.614, Speaker B: Two, u three beta three.
00:41:08.394 - 00:41:31.390, Speaker A: Okay, so if we wanted to play the same game, we want to find out the level sets. We are interested in knowing which are the level sets of phi equals constant. We're going to search the vector field that makes both of this the generator, right, just as we did here, that annihilates both of these entries. So we search a vector field.
00:41:31.422 - 00:41:32.234, Speaker B: We search.
00:41:35.774 - 00:41:44.006, Speaker A: X equals to the sum of AI ui dui. So tangent to the exception divisor such.
00:41:44.070 - 00:41:44.674, Speaker B: That.
00:41:47.454 - 00:42:32.072, Speaker A: X one must be constant equals to zero and x two must be constant equals to zero. This is going to give us the level set of the vector field. Then we'll generate a line foliation which will coincide with the level sense. It's going to be tangent along both of them. Both of them are first integrals of them. So the foliation itself is going to be tangent to both of these functions. In this case, just as before, what was appearing here was we didn't have the v did not make an appearance, and the alpha one, alpha two was such that the determinant here was, if we think about that, there was the alpha one, alpha two here, there was the vector space generated by alpha one, alpha two.
00:42:32.072 - 00:42:49.024, Speaker A: And what we took here was alpha two minus alpha one. So we took the orthogonal space, because once we take the orthogonal space and you multiply to the inner product with alpha one for two, this is going to be zero. So in here, to generate this vector field, we can do the same trick. We consider.
00:42:51.364 - 00:42:57.624, Speaker B: Gamma equals to this alpha beta, right.
00:42:59.404 - 00:43:16.608, Speaker A: In dimension three, we can just take the vector product and x given by the entries of this gamma Ui dy generate the levels, the foliation, the level.
00:43:16.656 - 00:43:17.364, Speaker B: Sense.
00:43:20.784 - 00:43:41.694, Speaker A: Of phi equals to constant. This is going to be the vector field that is going to give us, that is going to describe all of the level sets of the fog. So this can be a little bit more involved because it's a three dimensional vector field. But you might have a situation that.
00:43:41.994 - 00:43:45.050, Speaker B: Some of them may do some drawing.
00:43:45.082 - 00:44:31.804, Speaker A: You could have situation radial here, and in the other ones you're doing something with it. An example what could have been depending on the choice of alpha that they retake here. But one thing that is important once again is that this is again linear. So this is very rigid. So what is the object that we are going to consider in both of these cases? We want to consider this foliation, this level sets which we're going to describe as a foliation. So we're going to describe it with a model of our sheath of modules of derivations. So the level thing, the level set PI equals constant.
00:44:34.644 - 00:44:38.864, Speaker B: Gives rise to a foliation.
00:44:40.564 - 00:44:47.904, Speaker A: And we describe this foliation via its vector fields, one of the definitions in algebraic geometry.
00:44:48.804 - 00:44:56.024, Speaker B: So we consider decay.
00:44:59.624 - 00:45:00.764, Speaker A: Of models.
00:45:02.904 - 00:45:03.216, Speaker B: Which.
00:45:03.240 - 00:45:04.164, Speaker A: We'Re going to call.
00:45:07.024 - 00:45:08.736, Speaker B: Gamma phi, which.
00:45:08.760 - 00:45:26.170, Speaker A: Is going to be contained in the sheet of derivations tangent to the exceptional divisor such that for every n, a and m we give them by the stalk of what is going to be.
00:45:26.202 - 00:45:29.094, Speaker B: So phi at a.
00:45:29.714 - 00:45:55.542, Speaker A: This is going to be the vector fields in de, in the stalk a. So what we want is that it is going to be tangent to every one of the entries of the morphism. So one way to say this is that x of f composed with phi is constant equals to zero for all.
00:45:55.598 - 00:45:56.194, Speaker B: F.
00:45:59.494 - 00:46:20.850, Speaker A: In the local ring of the image. So if we are in this situation, we're just pulling back x and z, or we're pulling back x one and x two. But we could have pulled back any other function, it's still going to be zero. So this is going to be the sheath that is going to describe this.
00:46:20.882 - 00:46:21.694, Speaker B: Level set.
00:46:28.114 - 00:46:29.654, Speaker A: Of log derivations.
00:46:33.954 - 00:46:35.214, Speaker B: Tangent to phi.
00:46:38.834 - 00:47:16.374, Speaker A: So just to say that the point that I anticipated a bit too early in this example was that once we make this change of coordinates, we're going to remark that at least the first two entries here, the level set is not going to be linear. It's going to have a more delicate singularity here. So the vector field is not going to be linear. That's just the point. So I anticipated this was the second point that I wanted to make. So this is not going to be monomial because the level sets are not going to be good. And, and when I'm saying that the level sets are strict.
00:47:16.374 - 00:47:27.954, Speaker A: So we talked about these two examples where we saw that the level sets were given by this vector field which is linear, but this is actually a more general result. Now I just give it to you.
00:47:31.294 - 00:47:38.174, Speaker B: The following one lemma.
00:47:42.074 - 00:47:43.454, Speaker A: Is supposed that.
00:47:49.314 - 00:47:57.734, Speaker B: PI of md to me is monomial.
00:48:02.134 - 00:48:45.746, Speaker A: Then, first information. This heap of models is a finite type. It is not strange because the locally right after change of coordinates, the morphism is algebra. It looks like an algebraic morphism, and therefore the sheet almost like an algebraic sheet and not a quasi analytic sheet. So you can expect it that it's going to be a finite type, not only privileged. Actually finite type here is important because it's not a priority. Clear why the sheet for any abstract morph is that we define here would be privileged.
00:48:45.746 - 00:48:53.414, Speaker A: But actually it's much more than just privilege of finite type indicates that it's a monomer morphism.
00:49:00.394 - 00:49:01.134, Speaker B: And.
00:49:03.634 - 00:49:06.906, Speaker A: The scht set a is generated.
00:49:06.970 - 00:49:07.574, Speaker B: By.
00:49:12.834 - 00:49:30.754, Speaker A: Vector field of this form yj equals to the sum k equals to one to r gamma jk uk duk.
00:49:31.894 - 00:49:36.006, Speaker B: Where j equals to one over r.
00:49:36.070 - 00:49:43.766, Speaker A: Minus p. I'm going to explain why this notation here in a second and zl is just going to be equal.
00:49:43.790 - 00:49:49.694, Speaker B: To ewl equals to one.
00:49:51.034 - 00:50:08.778, Speaker A: So finally, the w variable appears. The w variable, which we sometimes call phi three, is the one where the we have derivations in this sheath, which are regular, which are not singular.
00:50:08.866 - 00:50:09.210, Speaker B: Right?
00:50:09.282 - 00:50:35.644, Speaker A: These ones are singular, they are u times derivation. They have to be tangent to the exception of divisors these ones are not similar. If you derive wl, you get equals to one. That's what it means. And we can even say a little bit more so that we are a little bit more precise about this, where the collection of all of these gamuts.
00:50:38.044 - 00:50:39.344, Speaker B: R minus b.
00:50:41.084 - 00:50:42.424, Speaker A: Forms the basics.
00:50:49.564 - 00:50:49.876, Speaker B: Of.
00:50:49.900 - 00:50:51.384, Speaker A: The orthogonal complement.
00:51:00.764 - 00:51:04.496, Speaker B: Of alpha one, alpha.
00:51:04.520 - 00:51:45.544, Speaker A: P. So just as before, in this example here, you had alpha, well, the truer alpha. So you have the vector space generated by alpha and beta, and then gamma was an orthogonal one. So this is a more general phenomenon. You can always take this sheath as locally generated by vector fields of this form, linear in the u variables and regular in the w variable. So this means that the level sets are really rigid and very special pollinations. Okay, so this kind of explains why we are going to need something.
00:51:45.544 - 00:52:13.424, Speaker A: In some sense, we need to, let me write, we're going to need to not only deal with the normal form of phi, but also with the level sets of phi. So there is considerations about the derivatives here that are changing. Considerations are going in the direction of poliation theory, although we don't have transcendental behavior, because everything is come, everything has a first integral, something intermediate between them. So the problem of molarization.
00:52:24.344 - 00:52:24.776, Speaker B: And.
00:52:24.840 - 00:52:44.644, Speaker C: Sorry, Andre. Yes, so you gave only one index in the, for the gamma I in the, between the brackets. So I take it it's gamma one k to gamma r minus one k, which form the basis. And so does it mean also that we can pick them independent of k?
00:52:47.064 - 00:53:04.708, Speaker A: Yeah, they don't depend. Sorry. So maybe I should have been clear. When I write gamma one, I mean the vector given by gamma one, one, gamma one r. Okay, sorry.
00:53:04.756 - 00:53:06.204, Speaker C: Yeah, okay. Each gamma.
00:53:06.324 - 00:53:11.884, Speaker A: Sorry, I should have, should have been precise. J is fixed and the k is varying.
00:53:11.964 - 00:53:15.844, Speaker B: And then I'm taking the multi index, right?
00:53:16.384 - 00:53:30.536, Speaker A: No, but this is show that you're falling so good. There's many, many indexes, to be precise. Okay, so demand, let me write this.
00:53:30.560 - 00:53:36.884, Speaker B: In a better way. Transformations.
00:53:41.244 - 00:53:42.464, Speaker A: In the source.
00:53:49.524 - 00:53:52.676, Speaker B: Such that, well.
00:53:52.740 - 00:53:55.904, Speaker A: We want to some extent resolve.
00:53:58.284 - 00:54:01.132, Speaker B: The cell, the level set, and at the.
00:54:01.148 - 00:54:02.384, Speaker A: Same time obtain.
00:54:05.384 - 00:54:07.004, Speaker B: Monomial normal forms.
00:54:13.544 - 00:54:38.624, Speaker A: Of course, the second one is the one that we're really after. But the first one is going to play a role in the proof. We're going to play an important role in what follows. So I wanted to put up it in a special way that we also want these level sets to be nice. And this is going to play a role on how we define invariant and etcetera, that we're going to work with.
00:54:39.964 - 00:54:43.804, Speaker B: Okay, and all this. So this was the first.
00:54:43.884 - 00:55:14.964, Speaker A: And now the second one that I wanted to make is let's now consider the monomial morphism, a pre monomial morphism. So from, from the beginning, right? So we had five k plus one was equal to this phi k.
00:55:17.064 - 00:55:17.352, Speaker B: And.
00:55:17.368 - 00:55:19.604, Speaker A: Then we wrote g plus m.
00:55:25.084 - 00:55:25.804, Speaker B: Where.
00:55:25.964 - 00:55:27.344, Speaker A: V was a relation.
00:55:28.164 - 00:55:44.184, Speaker B: So dc one dk, dd is equal to zero. And if we disconsider the relation v, then this is monogamy.
00:55:47.364 - 00:55:50.646, Speaker A: And the first thing I want to remark is that now if we have.
00:55:50.670 - 00:55:57.566, Speaker B: A vector field in this sheath and.
00:55:57.590 - 00:56:00.154, Speaker A: We apply to g, then we're going to get zero.
00:56:00.694 - 00:56:08.006, Speaker B: So if x belongs to the sheath.
00:56:08.070 - 00:56:14.394, Speaker A: Let me not be precise about the point. We don't have to gerrify. Then.
00:56:17.394 - 00:56:19.922, Speaker B: When we apply to g, we're.
00:56:19.938 - 00:56:55.044, Speaker A: Going to get zero. And this is coming from this property here. It means that if we have something which is, which is going to be like. It's an exercise to do it. But the heuristic is that a g is related, right? There is a relation with this phi one. So, although if we don't see it necessarily as a function in the target, the relation is already captured by the, by the level sets we're not going to define like the level sets are not going to change. If we add the morphs pkg, they're going to be exactly the same.
00:56:55.044 - 00:57:19.032, Speaker A: I'm going to change them. I'm going to have something smaller. So this is the first point here. And because of this we can now see that if we apply these derivations that we have here to the premonomial Morpheus, to the last century of the premonomial morphism, then we're going to be.
00:57:19.048 - 00:57:21.656, Speaker B: Able to find an intrinsic way to.
00:57:21.680 - 00:57:31.764, Speaker A: See this monoamian morphism that it is a premonomial morphs. So let me be more precise about this. So consider.
00:57:36.764 - 00:57:40.140, Speaker B: The ideal j, which is.
00:57:40.172 - 00:57:46.104, Speaker A: Given by the derivation of c k plus one.
00:57:48.364 - 00:57:49.384, Speaker B: For all.
00:57:54.524 - 00:58:34.056, Speaker A: And here with k we consider this, this j here, and let us compute it in the, in the case of a primonomial morphs, right? So there's basically three cases. If m is equal to zero, then nothing to do. J has to be equal to zero because every derivation that we take here is going to make g equals zero and zero. So the ideal is zero, nothing to do there. If m is of the form u.
00:58:34.080 - 00:58:37.480, Speaker B: To the power alpha, then this alpha.
00:58:37.512 - 00:59:13.700, Speaker A: Was linear independent with the alpha one alpha two p. And therefore when we take a derivation x of it. Right, we are going to be forming a basis of the orthogonal complement. So there's at least one of these derivations which apply to u alpha is non zero. So as a matter of fact, this g is going to be equal to u alpha. This is j, sorry, it's going to be equal to u alpha. And third, if m was equal to.
00:59:13.732 - 00:59:22.936, Speaker B: U beta, v not v w plus.
00:59:23.040 - 00:59:45.824, Speaker A: Psi, then the beta was linear dependent with the alphas. So every one of the derivations that are written like here, they're going to make this, this monomial to be equal to zero. Nevertheless, all of the derivations in w do appear. So once we derive in w here, we obtain just u to the power beta. So we are going to see that.
00:59:45.864 - 00:59:50.776, Speaker B: J is equal to u, bet, which.
00:59:50.800 - 01:00:06.924, Speaker A: Is mono u, and this actually captured. So if we have a premonomial morphism, and we consider this ideal j, we obtain something that is either zero or monomial. And this actually captures a more general statement.
01:00:09.784 - 01:00:12.804, Speaker B: Which is lemma.
01:00:14.294 - 01:00:15.034, Speaker A: And.
01:00:22.334 - 01:00:26.794, Speaker B: If j is equal to zero.
01:00:27.374 - 01:00:31.114, Speaker A: Or j is monomial.
01:00:34.334 - 01:00:35.074, Speaker B: Then.
01:00:44.154 - 01:01:34.652, Speaker A: Is premonomial. So what is the point of what I'm trying to present here and construct this lemma? The point is we have this rigidity of the, of the, of the level sets, and now we can use it by applying it to the entry, the last entry of the morpheus, the one that we're trying to transform in order to get a certain ideal, which, if this ideal has a good property, if this ideal is monomial, we know that we have finished the step one b. We know that we are in pre monomial form. Now, instead of working with the morphism itself, we are transforming the problem into working with an ideal. The idea coming from the derivations of.
01:01:34.668 - 01:01:48.164, Speaker B: This file, the shift of derivations of phi k here. So let me write a little bit better. Okay? Right.
01:01:48.204 - 01:02:33.680, Speaker A: So once we do this now we have to deal with an ideal in some sense, right? What we want is to deal with the ideal given by all of these derivations of the last form, which are not going to see the relations g. They are only going to capture what appears afterwards, doesn't capture things that are going to have to be dealt in the target, but only things that have to be dealt in the source. And our goal would be to make it monomial. That would be a goal for us in that step one b. And if we do that, then we have to consider the target to get g zero. This motivates us to talk about the theorem that I'm going to call one a. So this is going to correspond to the one a step.
01:02:33.680 - 01:02:47.484, Speaker A: So the first step, the technical step, that now makes sense, which is the following. So let phi of MD into ne.
01:02:50.684 - 01:02:51.424, Speaker B: Here.
01:02:53.204 - 01:02:57.864, Speaker A: But now monomial. This is going to be a hypothesis.
01:03:00.444 - 01:03:01.344, Speaker B: Morphism.
01:03:02.044 - 01:03:07.224, Speaker A: So now we assume that the morph is monomial, and we consider.
01:03:13.684 - 01:03:14.228, Speaker B: And let.
01:03:14.276 - 01:03:32.124, Speaker A: I be a privilege ideal. Then we do the local version. Let a in m be equals to.
01:03:32.504 - 01:03:36.408, Speaker B: V of a, which belongs to n.
01:03:36.576 - 01:03:43.624, Speaker A: So there exists neighborhood v of a, w.
01:03:47.644 - 01:04:07.984, Speaker B: Of b, and a finite number of commutative diagrams just before.
01:04:30.664 - 01:04:32.564, Speaker A: Satisfying all the properties.
01:04:41.324 - 01:04:44.824, Speaker B: One, two and three.
01:04:45.204 - 01:05:07.364, Speaker A: So the properties about the local points up are substitutions, semicover, semi proper coverings, the phi lambda monomial. This is not that impressive, because in the beginning phi was monomial already. So if that was it, then we could just take Sigma and tau as identity. But the real thing and the pullback.
01:05:07.704 - 01:05:10.964, Speaker B: Of I is monomial.
01:05:16.064 - 01:05:25.164, Speaker A: So what we're doing is that we're taking an idea. We take already a morpheus, which is monomial, and we take some idea in it, in the m. I didn't say where it was.
01:05:38.024 - 01:05:42.764, Speaker B: Let's put the heath and something implicit.
01:05:46.224 - 01:06:09.470, Speaker A: In m, and we're going to principalize this ideal, and we will preserve the fact that the morpheus was monolithic. And in here we are seeing that this is the kind of thing that we want. We want to be able to do this because we want to take this kind of ideal j, and we want to be able to principalize it in a way, monomialize it in a way that we keep the morphism Phi k.
01:06:09.502 - 01:06:13.702, Speaker B: That is appearing here, this morphism, we.
01:06:13.718 - 01:06:36.878, Speaker A: Want to keep it monomial. The idea that we're going to apply it to phi equals to phi k. So go back to the beginning, and I'm going to write that theorem. One a with phi equals two phi.
01:06:36.926 - 01:06:37.514, Speaker B: K.
01:06:39.454 - 01:07:30.364, Speaker A: And the ideal, the kind of ideal that we want to derive and we want to monomialize, will be related to that ideal JavaScript. It's not only going to be that ideal j, we're going to see what exactly we want, but that's the idea. We want to principalize that idea J, so that we are able to finish by saying that it's a pre monomial morphism. Take this guy, make it a monomial, use this theorem, make it monomial, guarantee that therefore we get something that is primonal. But this j is coming from the derivation of it doesn't behave as an ideal as we blow up, because it's coming, it's not an ideal itself. It was coming from taking the idea that generated by derivations of some entries. So this is going to be able, we'll have to do this in a very precise way.
01:07:30.364 - 01:08:27.992, Speaker A: But now I will focus more on the first part and why I'm going to sphere one a right with clearly is important to which. Clearly important, which I tried to argue so far that it's very important to make the transformation of this j into something monomial, and therefore to get us pre monomer. And the reason why I'm going to focus on this is because the proof is very similar to local resolution of an ideal. Right, which we already did in a lot of details. So my idea now is to take and to present what we need to modify in that proof in order to get the result. So as a first thing, I want to talk about the morphisms that are going to preserve the normal form of being monomial. So when we did, let's enter in.
01:08:28.008 - 01:08:32.468, Speaker B: This, this topic, when we talked about.
01:08:32.516 - 01:08:52.424, Speaker A: Local resolutions, we started by talking about combinatorial blowing up. It was very, very useful for us. And here we're going to try to understand what are the morphins that we're searching for. Right, combinatorials are going to be some of them, but we might want something more so amorphous preserving transformations.
01:08:58.344 - 01:08:59.644, Speaker B: Which preserve.
01:09:11.024 - 01:09:40.183, Speaker A: So as we did before, our transformation is going to keep everything good, our combinatorial transformations and sigma.
01:09:42.843 - 01:09:46.131, Speaker B: Primary diffuser to.
01:09:46.187 - 01:09:50.563, Speaker A: Md a combinatorial.
01:09:56.943 - 01:09:57.963, Speaker B: Going up.
01:09:59.023 - 01:10:21.420, Speaker A: Then two things happen which are good for us. First one is that the composition with sigma, which we can call it, is again monomial. So if we make this combinatorial bonds.
01:10:21.452 - 01:10:25.024, Speaker B: Up, we keep the fact that it's monom.
01:10:25.804 - 01:10:34.664, Speaker A: But there was another property that we talked about when we did local resolution, which we call the key property. And the key properties is still true here.
01:10:36.764 - 01:10:44.820, Speaker B: That is, if we pull back the sheath of the radiation tension to PI.
01:10:45.012 - 01:12:02.176, Speaker A: This is going to give us exactly the new sheet of derivations of the composition we had called this t property. And maybe, just to answer a question that came before, why do we keep track so much of the exceptional device as well? One of the reasons is because of this kind of transform, right. If we have combinatorial, combinatorial is really dependent on the exceptional divisor. We know that all of the properties that are somehow important for us and going to keep track and control on the objects that we are working with are satisfied. So combinatorial examples are good, but we're not going to be able to prove this theorem only with combinatorial blinds up. So we will have to be much more precise where we use them and also where we need to use more general transformations, which also have these two properties. So now I want to argue with you that these two properties are what we want to keep, but they are not only satisfied by combinatorial blowing up, and moreover, in some sense they are independent.
01:12:02.176 - 01:12:40.824, Speaker A: They have a big correlation between them. But we might have blowings up to the preserve the first and not the second, or we might have blowings up that preserve the second but not the first. So let's do this with examples. I will consider. And here again, I'm a little bit, I'm just not taking much importance. The exception divisors. Let's take empty.
01:12:40.824 - 01:12:53.954, Speaker A: And here z one equals to v one and z two equal to v two. First, if we take the blowing up.
01:12:55.894 - 01:13:10.034, Speaker B: Sigma, and I write this is.
01:13:11.854 - 01:13:12.754, Speaker A: Spent.
01:13:13.494 - 01:13:17.270, Speaker B: By the variable w. There was just.
01:13:17.302 - 01:13:20.704, Speaker A: One vector field, right? It's from r three to r two. It's a vector filter.
01:13:20.744 - 01:13:24.124, Speaker B: It's a line collision given by w.
01:13:24.704 - 01:13:26.884, Speaker A: So now if we blow up.
01:13:31.944 - 01:13:32.280, Speaker B: With.
01:13:32.312 - 01:13:36.924, Speaker A: Center c equals v one and v two, so this is not combinatorial.
01:13:50.284 - 01:13:51.024, Speaker B: Then.
01:13:51.884 - 01:13:56.264, Speaker A: Both proper, come, this one here is not good enough, then both properties.
01:14:01.324 - 01:14:02.544, Speaker B: Are satisfied.
01:14:06.324 - 01:14:21.442, Speaker A: We can see that if we blow up like this, then this blow up is invariant by the x as given by w. So the pullback of this in particular, we're going to have that.
01:14:21.458 - 01:14:34.882, Speaker B: The blowing up of this PI is still going to be span of the Dw, which is now d of sigma PI.
01:14:35.018 - 01:14:55.694, Speaker A: And we can see that. So we don't need to blow up only combinatorial. There's more general blowing up that preserve both properties. But if we blow up with center c given by v two w.
01:14:57.554 - 01:14:57.962, Speaker B: Again.
01:14:58.018 - 01:14:58.854, Speaker A: Which is not.
01:15:08.174 - 01:15:12.994, Speaker B: Then x PI was argued.
01:15:16.534 - 01:15:31.302, Speaker A: I composed with sigma is monomial, but now this guy is going to.
01:15:31.318 - 01:15:37.966, Speaker B: Have a pole, has poles, and so.
01:15:37.990 - 01:16:06.584, Speaker A: It'S different from the composition. So the second property. So we might make blowing up that preserve the first property but not the second. And one could present also examples. I just, I won't do it just to move forward. But one can also present examples where the blowing up preserve the second property but not the first. So from now on, we're going to think combinatorial is not going to be enough.
01:16:06.584 - 01:16:30.402, Speaker A: But we want to have a property on the sequence of blowing up, which allows us to have a control. We call this key property because it allows us to have a control on later on some chain of ideals. This is what we are searching here, too. But instead of just talking about combinatorial blowing up, we're going to talk about sequences of blows up which satisfy this property. And this is either going to play a role of a thesis or on.
01:16:30.418 - 01:16:33.010, Speaker B: A hypothesis, in the same way that.
01:16:33.042 - 01:16:34.506, Speaker A: Combinatorial would play a role.
01:16:34.570 - 01:16:35.058, Speaker B: Right?
01:16:35.186 - 01:17:28.176, Speaker A: If we have a sequence of combinatorial goings up, then something good happens. Or if we have an idea which we call the combinatorial, then there exists a sequence of combinatorial bones up in the same way. We're going to have statements that says that if an ideal satisfies a certain property, then we're going to be able to find sequence of blowing up which satisfy this key property, and then statements that say if such a key property is satisfied, then we can control the environment that we're going to define in a little bit. So this is going to still play a key part of the Triton that we're going to have here. It's going to be a property in itself that we want to study. It's kind of the point that I'm trying to make. Now that we saw this part.
01:17:28.176 - 01:17:58.404, Speaker A: Let's now build up the calculus of log derivatives in the same way that we did for the, in the local case for ideals in the same way as we did before.
01:17:58.524 - 01:18:03.904, Speaker B: So let I let you.
01:18:06.404 - 01:18:58.224, Speaker A: Privileged ideal sheet. We consider chain of ideals where we start by the ideal itself. Now before with an index, the exceptional divisor. Now I'm going to put demorphis itself where need to define it. I k plus one of phi is equal to the previous one. Plus all of the derivatives apply to the previous one. We consider its closure, which we call.
01:18:58.764 - 01:18:59.504, Speaker B: This.
01:19:05.504 - 01:19:21.044, Speaker A: Ik phi kn is the delta phi closure. And then we define the invariant that we work with.
01:19:21.744 - 01:19:27.072, Speaker B: So given a in M, the invariant.
01:19:27.128 - 01:19:31.144, Speaker A: At a corresponds to phi of I.
01:19:31.884 - 01:19:44.308, Speaker B: Is the minimum of k in the natural numbers plus infinity, such that ik.
01:19:44.356 - 01:19:54.424, Speaker A: Phi localized at a is equal to I infinity phi localized at a.
01:19:58.644 - 01:19:58.972, Speaker B: I'm.
01:19:58.988 - 01:20:25.484, Speaker A: Doing it a bit more faster because this is what we did in the local resolution case. So maybe now let's compute given amorphous compute this sequence here in explicit way. For one example, let's consider phi.
01:20:27.744 - 01:20:36.644, Speaker B: Of r.
01:20:41.184 - 01:20:42.368, Speaker A: Is equal to.
01:20:42.536 - 01:21:06.788, Speaker B: Yeah, is not great. It's not easy for me to write in this tablet equal to zero. And there we take right again.
01:21:06.956 - 01:21:08.660, Speaker A: Yes, this one we're going to take.
01:21:08.692 - 01:21:12.660, Speaker B: X one equals to u one, u.
01:21:12.692 - 01:21:35.380, Speaker A: Two n x two equals to u two u three. And just by doing the vectorial product of the two vector here, one 10 and zero one one, we can find this guy is spanned by one vector.
01:21:35.412 - 01:21:58.068, Speaker B: Field, which is given by here I'm going to choose, or maybe let me use the notation, right. It was y. So let me use y. U.
01:21:58.116 - 01:22:00.100, Speaker A: Let's take as an ideal, the ideal.
01:22:00.132 - 01:22:04.064, Speaker B: Generated by f, where s.
01:22:05.944 - 01:22:07.004, Speaker A: Equal to.
01:22:09.904 - 01:22:30.044, Speaker B: U one, u two plus u two, u three plus u two, u three to the power four plus u one, u two to the power.
01:22:34.284 - 01:23:05.026, Speaker A: And I want to start by making a couple of observations here about the interaction of this vector field y, which each one of the terms that are appearing here. So we see that these two terms are actually given by the morphes itself. So we have chosen y so that y over x one and y over x two is equivalent, equals to zero. So if we compute in each one of them here, u one, u two.
01:23:05.170 - 01:23:07.906, Speaker B: This is going to be zero, and.
01:23:07.930 - 01:23:51.426, Speaker A: We compute u two, u three, this is equal to zero. Now, the other two monomials are not like that, right? So if we compute y of u two, u three to the power four, then we say, we see that the entry in u two that appears here is going to appear with a minus one. So this is going to give us minus one, and the entry in the u three is going to appear with a plus. So here is four. So it's going to appear plus four, and then we're going to have the same monomial, we're preserving the monomial by this derivation. So this is just three times u.
01:23:51.450 - 01:23:58.678, Speaker B: Two, u three to the power four. And if we do the thing with.
01:23:58.726 - 01:24:32.476, Speaker A: The same thing with the last one, then the u one we're going to apply u is going to be one, going to give us the term that is appearing here, and then we're going to have minus this derivation. So when we apply u this, it's going to have the six that is going to go down, but we have a sinus of minus. So here's one of your minus six, and then the same module u one, u two six. So this is going to be equal to minus five, u one, u two.
01:24:32.500 - 01:24:33.624, Speaker B: To the power six.
01:24:38.884 - 01:24:56.380, Speaker A: Okay, so now let's use this information to compute this, the sequence of ideal, this chain of ideals. And actually I'm going to be more interested about the invariant itself. So the first information that we have is that if we take y of.
01:24:56.452 - 01:24:58.860, Speaker B: S, this is going to give us.
01:24:58.892 - 01:25:13.164, Speaker A: Zero times zero to the power one. The way to write zero, u one, u two, plus u two, u three.
01:25:14.864 - 01:25:17.320, Speaker B: Now it's going to appear three, which.
01:25:17.352 - 01:25:20.448, Speaker A: Multiplies u two to the power one.
01:25:20.616 - 01:25:31.764, Speaker B: U two, u three four, plus minus 510 to the power one, u one, u two to the power six.
01:25:33.104 - 01:25:34.576, Speaker A: And if we apply for the second.
01:25:34.640 - 01:25:35.244, Speaker B: Time.
01:25:37.804 - 01:25:41.944, Speaker A: Then we're going to have, again zero. It was already zero, after all.
01:25:48.124 - 01:25:48.548, Speaker B: Plus.
01:25:48.596 - 01:26:09.004, Speaker A: Three to the power two, because the three is a constant, minus five to the power two to six. So we have these three entries, and we, of course, I did not write, but we have, we have f.
01:26:10.744 - 01:26:11.056, Speaker B: Then.
01:26:11.080 - 01:26:14.984, Speaker A: There'S no zero to any power. It's just u one, u two plus.
01:26:15.024 - 01:26:23.484, Speaker B: U two, u three, u three four plus.
01:26:26.064 - 01:26:56.374, Speaker A: And if we make the computation just as with the van DER Mont matrix, basically here we're going to have a van DER Mont. This is going to have a nice looking determinant. We can invert that matrix. And what we're going to obtain is that we may make combinations of f, y f and y square of f to generate each one of these monomials. And this pair here, this sum independently. So we conclude that.
01:26:58.684 - 01:27:11.292, Speaker B: U one, u two plus u two, u three, u two u three four, and u one.
01:27:11.468 - 01:27:53.374, Speaker A: U two six are elements we need to derive twice. So, via I five two, there are elements of that. And this is going to give us all the information that we need to finish to compute the sequence, because we know that I phi zero, which is equal to this f. And this is contained in the idea generated by all of these terms separately. U one, u two plus u two, u three.
01:27:55.954 - 01:27:58.082, Speaker B: U two, u four to.
01:27:58.098 - 01:28:00.254, Speaker A: The power u three to the power four.
01:28:03.434 - 01:28:04.370, Speaker B: Let's go.
01:28:04.522 - 01:28:05.774, Speaker A: Keep my concentration.
01:28:07.394 - 01:28:17.136, Speaker B: And u one, u two to the power six. Right. And then we, we had the first.
01:28:17.200 - 01:28:22.552, Speaker A: One, which is then going to be given by f y of that, and.
01:28:22.568 - 01:28:27.080, Speaker B: Then the third one, f y of.
01:28:27.112 - 01:28:38.724, Speaker A: X, which in the one hand, it's going to contain. We just computed it. It contains. So this idea.
01:28:39.264 - 01:28:47.784, Speaker C: So, andre, we agree that the inclusion symbolism is. Is in the wrong direction, right? Or. I really don't understand.
01:28:48.084 - 01:28:52.344, Speaker B: Okay. No, thanks. You're right.
01:28:54.444 - 01:28:57.464, Speaker A: When I'm writing, like when I have to write a lot of things, sometimes.
01:29:00.564 - 01:29:01.624, Speaker B: Concentration.
01:29:05.804 - 01:29:19.084, Speaker A: Thanks for this one. We know that it's going to be contained by the previous argument. And on the other hand, we know that this idea is invariant by the derivations of phi.
01:29:19.624 - 01:29:19.960, Speaker B: Right.
01:29:19.992 - 01:29:22.904, Speaker A: We have computed them just here. They are invariant.
01:29:22.944 - 01:29:24.016, Speaker B: We're keeping them.
01:29:24.200 - 01:29:54.024, Speaker A: So they are also something which contains I one phi, and therefore they also contain I two. We conclude that the invariant is going to be equal to true, because this one is going to be the I infinity phi.
01:29:55.924 - 01:29:58.860, Speaker B: Inverter y of I at.
01:29:58.892 - 01:30:22.084, Speaker A: Zero is equal to two. We need the two derivations in order to obtain this. Ah, of course. So fire proof that it's smaller or equal to two. So, strictly saying, we need to verify that this idea is not going to be able to give us the three elements. But this is not difficult because it's generated by two elements. And here we have an idea generated by three.
01:30:22.084 - 01:30:37.554, Speaker A: So we do get that it's going to be equal to two. But there's something, and all right with it, one more time. The infinity idea is this. And there's something which is different from.
01:30:39.454 - 01:30:43.754, Speaker B: The case of local resolution, which is.
01:30:45.294 - 01:31:14.912, Speaker A: When we did this closure ideal, we obtained that it was going to be generated, at least formally, by monomials. And this was important because we used a combinatorial resolution of similarities too, to deal with it. But now, as we can see, it's not anymore generated by Mononis. It's going to be generated by power series, where the only information that we have is that the, the functions are appearing here. They're going to be, they're going to.
01:31:14.928 - 01:31:17.776, Speaker B: Have some nice behavior in terms of.
01:31:17.800 - 01:31:42.452, Speaker A: The, of the, of the derivations that generates the, the sheath of the rejection tangent to the morphs. So we're going to make this a little bit more precise later on. But the thing that I wanted to remark right away is that this infinity idea is not, it's not even a question of, informally or not in this case here, precisely. It's analytic, algebraic. We do see that it's not given by monomials. We cannot solve it, we cannot resolve it.
01:31:42.468 - 01:31:43.084, Speaker B: Sorry.
01:31:43.244 - 01:31:51.414, Speaker A: By combinatorial goings up. We need something more general. Andre? Yes, sorry.
01:31:51.604 - 01:31:59.074, Speaker B: I two is generated by f y of f and y two of f. Maybe not. Yes.
01:31:59.194 - 01:32:00.434, Speaker A: Sorry about this. You're right.
01:32:00.474 - 01:32:08.854, Speaker B: Okay, thank you.
01:32:11.794 - 01:32:14.934, Speaker A: I'm thinking about the point that I want to make, and I don't write stuff.
01:32:15.954 - 01:32:16.594, Speaker B: Okay.
01:32:16.674 - 01:32:39.114, Speaker A: So now let's try to make a the point here where. What's the point? The last thing I need to say, I will do two claims.
01:32:39.234 - 01:32:43.254, Speaker B: The first one is in the proof.
01:32:46.894 - 01:32:57.074, Speaker A: Of local resolution of singularities of ideals. Step two.
01:33:01.974 - 01:33:02.598, Speaker B: Inductive.
01:33:02.646 - 01:33:13.774, Speaker A: Step two and step three rest the same.
01:33:21.154 - 01:33:22.254, Speaker B: By adding.
01:33:26.754 - 01:33:27.854, Speaker A: To this statement.
01:33:33.514 - 01:33:34.254, Speaker B: That.
01:33:36.564 - 01:33:37.984, Speaker A: The Morpheus PI.
01:33:41.364 - 01:33:48.364, Speaker B: Is preserved monomial. Right.
01:33:48.404 - 01:34:32.684, Speaker A: So this would be the property tree. My claim is that if we just take that proof that we did and we add to the inductive statement that, well, we want also to keep some commutative diagram where the Morpheus is going to be monomial. The proof adopts mutatis mutantis. The same arguments apply. The part that does not adapt is step one. So the last part that I want to say is, what happens in step one? So the heuristic of it.
01:34:34.784 - 01:34:35.724, Speaker B: No, not.
01:34:36.104 - 01:35:25.244, Speaker A: The goal of it, consisted. Step one consisted in monomializing I phi infinity. This was the first step that we did, right. We considered the entire idea. We consider the idea generated by all of the monomials that appeared, which we showed was formally equal to this one. And then we said, okay, we can resolve it, and we make a couple of arguments to say we finished, but we could resolve it. And one of the things which was important was that we could resolve it by combinatorial blowing up.
01:35:25.244 - 01:35:54.724, Speaker A: This was something that we used in an important way, because these allowed us to use the key property which kept control of the, of the, of the invariant. So here we need to do the same thing. So we need to do something similar. But combinatorial blowing up is not going to be enough, because we just seen that this infinity ideal might not be given by monomials. So we actually have to prove a proposition here.
01:35:59.984 - 01:36:12.684, Speaker B: So in the notation of theorem one a.
01:36:15.794 - 01:36:53.874, Speaker A: Suppose that if we apply all of the derivations, we are still containing the idea. This is an idea which satisfies this property, right? It satisfies this property, because if we recall, this is given by the sum of I phi k. So if we apply them, then it's just going to give you the sum of I five k plus one. This is going to be containing the sum of all of them. So it satisfies this property. Then.
01:36:56.974 - 01:36:57.714, Speaker B: Then.
01:37:00.054 - 01:37:01.994, Speaker A: There exists the same.
01:37:05.794 - 01:37:09.534, Speaker B: Commutative diagrams.
01:37:12.714 - 01:37:18.754, Speaker A: Satisfying properties.
01:37:18.834 - 01:37:35.470, Speaker B: 1234 that the idea is going to be monomial and the key property of.
01:37:35.502 - 01:37:41.314, Speaker A: Gamma Phi is going to be equal to gamma PI lambda.
01:37:43.334 - 01:37:43.790, Speaker B: Right?
01:37:43.862 - 01:38:24.664, Speaker A: So this is what's going to replace combinatorial blowing up. So we are going to put ourselves in a situation that, in the resolution of singularities of ideals, correspond to a combinatorial ideal. So we knew that we could resolve a combinatorial blowing up. Now we do not know that. It's not a combinatorial view anymore. You just seen an example that shows that. But still, we are going to have to prove, that's what we want to prove, that there is going to exist such a resolution of singularities, preserving the monomer morphism and also keeping track of this key lemma, this key lemma, this key property, because with such a result, then we can control the invariant.
01:38:24.664 - 01:39:19.104, Speaker A: Okay, so I don't have much more time, so that I want to just make one last point, because this is the last point that I won't present the examples, but this proposition here turns out to be particularly hard in the quasi analytic case. And this is one big difference between the quasi analytic and the analytic case. So maybe the heuristic out of this is that in the quasi analytic, in the analytic case, we made an argument saying that I infinity of phi was equal to a combinatorial ideal formally. And then we said, well, the combinatorial ideal is convergent, so we can resolve in here something similar is going to happen. But instead of having monomials, we are going to have what we call aging, aging, aging vectors of the, of the sheath.
01:39:20.644 - 01:39:22.824, Speaker B: And in the analytic case, they converge.
01:39:24.044 - 01:39:45.924, Speaker A: But in the quasi analytic case, they're going to be just power series. They're not going to be just given by monomials. So the same argument does not apply. And this turns out to be a very sensible difference between the two, between the two results. So, as a matter of fact, in the analytic case, if we come back to the beginning.
01:39:49.184 - 01:39:53.280, Speaker B: Oh, well, did it just lose it?
01:39:53.312 - 01:39:54.656, Speaker A: No, it's coming back.
01:39:54.680 - 01:39:55.272, Speaker B: Okay.
01:39:55.408 - 01:40:02.920, Speaker A: If we just come back to the beginning of the, of the text, in the analytic case, we are able to.
01:40:02.952 - 01:40:04.804, Speaker B: Prove one a.
01:40:07.704 - 01:40:43.456, Speaker A: Separately by using one a and true. In this case, we do not need to pass through one b. In the quasi analytic. In the general quasi analytic case, we do not know how to prove this theorem one a without participating in the whole step of the induction. So this is a very, this is one of the delicate points about the difference between quasi analytic and analytic. This is a point that makes a big technical difference. In the analytic case, just repeat, we are able to prove theorem one can prove one a by just proving part one a and part two.
01:40:43.456 - 01:41:05.246, Speaker A: In the quasi analytic, we do not know how to do that. We need to prove also that the morphine become premonomial. So I don't have time. I'm going to start. I like this with the last point. This shows one difficulty, one of the big differences between analytic and quasi analytic. And I will stop here.
01:41:05.246 - 01:41:08.794, Speaker A: So thanks a lot for participating in the course, everyone.
01:41:09.214 - 01:41:20.654, Speaker B: Thank you, Andre. So let's thank Andre, I think, at his last lecture. Thank you. Let me stop the recording.
