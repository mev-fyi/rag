00:00:00.320 - 00:00:10.554, Speaker A: Welcome, everyone. We're very happy this week to have Mark Haskins from Duke University, and he's going to talk to us about solitons and Brian's g two laplacian flow.
00:00:11.014 - 00:01:07.324, Speaker B: Go ahead. Thanks, Vera. Thanks very much. Thanks for everyone for joining virtually. So I'm going to give a sort of overview of some recent were somewhat still in progress with Johannes Nordstrom at Bath and also summer undergraduate research student Rowan Juneman. So I'm going to explain what Florence G two Laplacian flow is, and I won't say too, too much about exactly what is known from an analytic point of view there. And I want to instead focus just on some particular skeletons that we've been studying recently.
00:01:07.324 - 00:02:23.086, Speaker B: So many of you will probably know a lot more about unethical flows than iwell and so. And for laplacian flow, then, this is something that Vera has been thinking about an awful lot longer than me. So let's just give some sort of preliminaries to set things up. So we want to just say a little bit about g two and what it's got to do with three forms in seven dimensions. So all the way back prior to the classification of complex simple Lee groups or the algebras, then when killing was trying to classify them, originally he thought there were only the sort of classical lie algebras. But Engel thought that in fact there ought to be a way to construct a 14 dimensional simple group by taking a generic three form in seven variables. So this turned out to be the case.
00:02:23.086 - 00:03:50.224, Speaker B: But somehow the picture wasn't completely settled until, until nearly 30 years later. So what do we mean by a generic k form? On, let's talk about complex k form. So if we've got a complex, if we've got a k form, then obviously we can pull it back by any general linear group element. And so generic just means that it's all that under the general linear group is open in the space of all k. So for any k form, if I look at its isotropic subgroup, the stabilizer of that form, so the general linear elements that stabilize that, then clearly to be a generic three form, what I need is that the dimension of gl minus, this should be the dimension of the space of all cases. And in general, as we make the dimension too large, there will be no way for this to be true. But if we're in the special case of three and seven, then this is 49, this is 35, the difference is 14, which is indeed this dimension of d two.
00:03:50.224 - 00:05:15.586, Speaker B: So this is at least plausible. So Engel, in 1900 started off really by looking at the case of complex generic three forms and the orbit under gl seven c. And it's simpler in that case, in that every generic three form has hypertrophy isomorphic to this complex Li algebra of g two. We're going to be interested in the real version of it, in which case things are a little bit more subtle. So over the reals, then, this was a student of angle called Reichel, who doesn't seem to have disappeared more or less after this. So if now you look at real three forms under the real general linear group, then it turns out actually that there are two types of generic orbits, and those will correspond to the fact that this complex lie algebra has two different real forms, one of which will be compact, the other one is non compact. So we'll be interested in the compact one.
00:05:15.586 - 00:06:18.018, Speaker B: In that case, then it leaves invariant a positive definite symmetric bilinear form. And then the stabilizer of that form in that orbit, is isomorphic to this compact simple regroup, whereas the other real form is compatible with a bilinear form, a definite non degenerate bilinear form, but of signature four three. So we ignore that for today. So we'll be interested in a generic real three form that is one of the positive ones. So the induced non degenerate bilinear form is positive definite. We'll call that a positive three form and just open orbit the positive feature. So sometimes it's the case that generic things, it's hard to describe a particular element in it.
00:06:18.018 - 00:07:34.644, Speaker B: In this case, that's not the case. So, using octoneonic multiplication, one can easily exhibit a particular. So if you're used to thinking about the quaternion and geometry in three reals cross product, by taking the imaginary quaternions and taking multiplication, you can do the same thing on the, so if I view r seven as the imaginary conion, then I can define a vector cross product on it by taking my two imaginary octonions, multiplying them together as octonions, and then taking that imaginary part. But since the octonions are also new on division algebra, then out of the norm, I polarize and get the inner product. So I can also form a three form by zero, by taking a product of two elements, and then it's in a product with a third one. So that gives me a three form constructed out of the cross product and the metric. And then this three form is such a positive three form.
00:07:34.644 - 00:09:22.624, Speaker B: So clearly this way, if I take something that's a automorphism of the tonions, then it's clearly going to preserve this and also this cross product. So I'm going to definitely have anything that preserve in this stabilizes five, but in fact also the reverse. Anything that just preserves the three form must preserve the whole structure of being an automorphism of the octopus. Okay, so that's just a very quick review about where g two and three forms come in and what the link to special properties of dimension eight and the octonions are. So if we want to do what are the special structures on seven manifolds that arise because of the presence of this root p two, then the simplest thing is just to insist that you have this structure at every point. So if phi zero is my particular choice of three form constructed via the octonions, then I think given on a smooth metaphor, then I can ask that there'd be some isomorphism from the tangent space at that point that pulls back my standard model and gives me some given three four at the point. So this is just point wide thing.
00:09:22.624 - 00:10:20.604, Speaker B: And I want to insist that my seven manifold be oriented and that this by the orientation preserving that. So then after this point wise construction, I just make a bundle out of that whose fiber is that point. And then a positive three form is a protection of that bundle. So just reform that lives in that of every point. So every time I have a positive three form on m, then it does give me a reduction of the frame bundle to some principle frame principal sub bundle of the frame bundle with fiber g two. So it gives me a g two structure in the usual sense. And it's, we've chosen a given orientation on M and it's compatible with that orientation.
00:10:20.604 - 00:11:48.188, Speaker B: So these positive three forms are basically in one to one correspondence with oriented structure. So, but this is not very interesting from a geometric point of view. It's purely a topological question that you have a positive three form on your seven manifold if and only if your seven manifold is orientable. And so, so if you want to get some more interesting geometry, then you want to put more conditions on your, and there are rare things that you can do, but the most sort of the strongest condition is to look at manifolds with polonomic group g two. So let me just say a little bit about that. So it's well known since the mid fifties that the possible holy groups of riemannian manifolds in a generic case. So you want to look at things that are not locally symmetric stages where you have far fewer constraints because hold parallel or whole curvature, tensor is parallel.
00:11:48.188 - 00:13:03.948, Speaker B: There you want to get rid of things that are reducible. And if you want to make things nice, they'll make global statements easier to assume than to connect it. So in those, under that setting, under that assumptions, then, virgin showed that the possible holonomy groups of riemannian manifolds are extremely limited. So there are five possible infinite families plus two exceptional cases. And then the two exceptional cases occur in dimension seven and eight, and g two occurs in dimension seven and spin seven, the double cover of. So if we take these exceptional cases plus, well, so in these five infinite families, then two of those infinite families are just holonomy son and holonomy un. So both correspond to generic riemannian manifolds and generic Taylor manifolds.
00:13:03.948 - 00:13:48.894, Speaker B: So if you take these two plus the three families there, those constitute what we call the special holonomy metric. And then all the special holonomy metrics are necessarily Einstein. And in fact, except in one case, they're all Ricci flat. So in particular, the exceptional holonomy ones are all Ricci flat. So Beaujet does not say that all of these things have to arise. He just says those are the only things that can arise. And so, knowing that they're Einstein or Ricci Flatt obviously tells you that proving existence of these is actually highly non trivial.
00:13:48.894 - 00:15:31.104, Speaker B: So, proving the existence of all the possible families of special holonomy metrics in various levels of generality, either sort of as a local construction or complete metrics on non compact spaces, or on compact spaces. But most of the 40 years, from mid fifties to the mid nineties, and involved some rather deep developments in geometry and analysis, most famously probably Yale's proof the Clavi conjecture settles the cases where the holonomy is the group special unitary group, or this compact group. And in that case you can use, you can reduce to, by working in a given Taylor class and using the DD bar lemma, you can reduce to a scalar equation, but you end up with a fully nonlinear scalar elliptic equation, a Monge complex monge ampere equation. And then, yeah, solve this by the continuity. Now, in the exceptional holonomy cases, then there is no known way to reduce to a scalar equation like this. And rather the best that's sort of known is a system of nonlinear first order PD's. So I'll just say something very briefly about what happens in the g two kits.
00:15:31.104 - 00:16:59.674, Speaker B: So it's not at the beginning, it's not obvious that polynomial leads to Pde's at all, in the sense that holonomy is a integrod differential condition. But the way to think about it is partly via thinking of the three form rather than working with the metric directly. So when I think about the holonomy group of romanian manifold, then the main thing that the holonomy does is determine exactly what the parallel tensors are. On my riemannian manifold. In particular, if I have holon on the inside of g two, then this kind of three form that I have, which is invariant under g two by its definition, will get turned into a parallel positive three. So if I have a g two holonometric, then I'll have a positive three form, but it will actually be parallel. So if I start with a g two structure, then I've got an induced metric, because g two is a subgroup of sr seven s.
00:16:59.674 - 00:18:01.584, Speaker B: But then I want to just write out the condition that induced metric b colonomy contained in g two. Well, we know it must be parallel. So if the holonomy is contained in g two, then there must be, if it's parallel, then it certainly must be closed and co closed. But also the reverse is true that it's sufficient to know that the form be closed and co closed. And then that actually says there must be a parallel form, and therefore the holonomy must reduce to a sub group of g two. So it doesn't say the holonomy is exactly g two. But you know, we've got now at least some differential conditions rather than integrodifferential conditions, and then we've got a containment of the holonomy.
00:18:01.584 - 00:19:03.644, Speaker B: So let's think about the equations occurring here a little bit more. So recall that in order to define Hodge star, we needed a metric. But the way that the three form determines a metric is nonlinear, sort of cubic in the three form. So in this statement here, then, this operator depends in a non linear way on the background three forms that we have. So we've got this equation genuinely of linear and phi, but this one is not. So in any case, we call something that satisfies this condition here a torsion three g two structure. So you can talk about torsion of a g two or g structure, and this is equivalent to that intrinsic torsion.
00:19:03.644 - 00:20:11.064, Speaker B: So, so rather than concentrating on the metric, we've concentrated on the free form and we've looked at the condition to be a subgroup, the holonomy, a subgroup of g two, and we've got differential equations. So how many equations did we get? So this was a three form, so it depended on 35 coefficients. We've got a vanishing of a four form and the vanishing of a five form. So like a three form and a two form. So that gives us 35 conditions and 21 conditions, but it turns out they overlap by seven. And so what we end up is 49 equations for these first five coefficients. So we get a first order system of 49 equations on 35 on that.
00:20:11.064 - 00:21:15.304, Speaker B: So still, it's not the sort of thing that your typical analyst would like to study. And, you know, the first approach to try to think about it would be you've got a, apparently an over determined system. So you would use methods designed to solve over determined equations. And that's exactly what Robert Bryant did, using the methods of different systems. But there are also some elliptic methods that you can use to study this, but essentially only perturbatively. So all of the current flavor of results are, suppose that you can in some way get your hands on a g two structure which satisfies theta d of phi zero. So we'll call that a closed d two structure.
00:21:15.304 - 00:22:43.010, Speaker B: And then its failure to be torsion free is now measured by d phi. So then if you can make something where d phi is sufficiently small, then there's a general, fairly robust perturbation theory developed by Dominic Joyce that says you can correct that to something with exactly caution. Three, and so then the art form is trying to find close g two structures with small torsion in creative ways. So by now, there are a number of different ways to do that. So Joyce's original filmmaker construction variants on that using qa le spaces. Then the bridge did connect some construction that was depicted by Donaldson, first investigated by Kovalev, and then in some more detail by myself and collaborators. And then more recently, Dominic and Spiro have gone back and generalized quite a bit of what Dominic did, where you can replace objects that used to be, had to be assumed to be flat, to be more curved.
00:22:43.010 - 00:23:57.530, Speaker B: But then it's difficult to find too many examples of it. There are, there's a lot of potential for extending that construction. So what I want to talk about today, so that's more or less all known constructions of compact g two holonomy manifolds are via that perturbation theory. Well, so mark, may I ask for this? What is doing saying, I mean, I thought one uses the implicit function, the answer. So why doesn't this contradict accounting? Why is the gluing construction not an over determined problem? Well, so, first of all, I haven't here really taken into account any diffumorphism invariants. And so, but this isn't, this is a bit of a fictitious count here. And so I, I could try to think of it you know, I could try to think of the problem locally, and, you know, then my form would be.
00:23:57.530 - 00:25:22.004, Speaker B: My form would be exactly. And everything would change. But I mean, the basic picture is that if you. So by the time you do, by the time you impose the diffumorphism invariant, then suppose that you had a g two holonomy network, and you look at what nearby ones would be like, then they would be given by the harmonic three forms on your manifold, but you would have a modulized fate of them. And in that, unlike for a general reachy flat phase, then in that case, you could actually prove that that's the smooth point of the moduli phase. And so now the general sort of perturbation theory instead is you're not quite at that situation, and you want to understand what has kind of changed. You know what? Yeah, I mean, without going into a bit of g two representation theory, to say reform should split this way, and it's a little bit difficult to be too specific.
00:25:22.004 - 00:26:15.644, Speaker B: Okay, thank you. But I mean, just so, just because it doesn't mean that all of these equations are really independent. I mean, it's just a crude parameter. Count is the first thing. It doesn't include diffeomorphism invariants in the second one. And whenever you have an over determined system, that still could be more solutions than you expect. And that's exactly what Robert Cartwhee and Kaler sort of thing will tell you, is for an over determined system locally, how many functions of how many variables does a solution depend on? So, so, I'm not sure I've done a very good job of answering the question.
00:26:17.624 - 00:26:38.344, Speaker A: Maybe I can just add for Bob what Dominic did for his existence theorem. There's a way to gauge fix, somehow get rid of the diffumorphism invariants. And then you really do get Laplacian of some two form equals some nonlinear quadratic stuff in first derivatives. So it really becomes, if you do it the right way, it does become an elliptic equation.
00:26:39.204 - 00:28:13.284, Speaker B: It's hard to see only for, only for somehow things close to that were already close to something that was a solution. Okay. But in any case, today I want to essentially ignore, I mean, I want to say, as far as actual construction to date of d two holonomy manifolds, everything has been done this way. But now I only want to now talk about parabolic related things, which so far has been not a good way to construct g two polynomial metrics yet, but which I think at least is give rise to a collection of interesting analytic geometric problems. And maybe one day far in the future will, will be useful. So there are, there are a number of different flows of three forms that one could introduce, and there are a few survey articles that came out of thought given at the Fields institute a few years ago. I'm going to concentrate on what I would regard as the most geometrically natural one, which is something that works on closed YouTube structures.
00:28:13.284 - 00:29:17.406, Speaker B: So there's a very natural flow introduced by Robert Bryant, which is that for a given closed positive three form. Then you try to solve the following problem that you try to say that the prime derivative is the Hodge Laplacian of your initial three four. So it turns out that this closed condition is satisfied. Once it's satisfied at times zero, it satisfies all p in the lifetime. And as a sign that you're not doing something completely crazy, then if you. So every five p gives you an induced metric gp. If you look at how the metric evolves, then it evolved via Ricci flow up to terms that are quadratic.
00:29:17.406 - 00:30:22.064, Speaker B: In if this thing does not have zero torsion, then this thing is quadratic terms in that torsion. So really, if I take something that's closed and co closed, then this Hodge Laplacian term vanishes. And so, in fact, the stationary points that are exactly the torsion three u two structures. But more than that, the Laplacian flow actually has a gradient flow structure. So kitchen introduced his local volume functional. So, given a form, phi, we have its induced metric g phi. Therefore, I can also talk about Hodge Laplacian and Hodge star, and therefore I can take phi where phi, and on a compact manifold, I can then integrate that.
00:30:22.064 - 00:31:55.264, Speaker B: Then I can, given some initial phi zero, I look at the I fix that given chromology class, and now vary the volume functional restricted to that class. Then what Hitchens showed is that the critical points of volume are exactly the torsion three g, two structures, they're all maxima. Or the second variation is greater or equal to zero, and I mean less than or equal to zero. And the only zero directions are the presence of diffuse. So, but this is actually a sort of upward gradient flow for the Hitchin volume. So that means, for instance, that when you look at the, how the volume increases, how the volume changes along the Laportean flow, then it's strictly increasing along the flow. Okay, so a natural question would be, you know, does this flow have short time, uniqueness and existence? And the answer is yes, it's not completely trivial.
00:31:55.264 - 00:33:02.844, Speaker B: So that was proven in an unpublished paper of brand and Duke. The subtlety is that even once you take into account Dipio in the invariance, then essentially what you get is things are parabolic only in the direction of closed forms. But you can either then directly do the Nash moser. Or it was pointed out recently that in Hamilton's 1982 JDG paper, then he gives a general setup which allows a integrability condition to be imposed. And if you appeal to that, then, then that fits within that class of problems that Hamilton considered. So. So, uniqueness and local uniqueness and short term existence and uniqueness is true, but not completely trivial.
00:33:02.844 - 00:34:12.524, Speaker B: A number of things have been done since. I mean, in no way does the state of development of Laplace inflow at all resemble the state of development of mean curvature flow or Ricci flow or Yamabi flow. But the last few years have seen some improvements. And for instance, there is a sort of stability result due to flote away. So that if you start sufficiently close to g two structure and let it flow and Laplace and flow, you will come back to a portion, three g two structure. Although the proof is not completely sort of self contained in the sense that you somehow need to use some of the elliptic perturbation theory in order to prove that. So from a purely parabolic point of view, it's, it's not very satisfactory.
00:34:12.524 - 00:35:45.884, Speaker B: But anyway, I think it's, it's fair to say that, you know, as in most geometric flows in higher dimensions, we're not expecting that in general, the solution should run for infinite time and always convergence. We're definitely expecting that there should be some sort of singularities, but at the moment, where we don't really have a clear idea of what those singularities are. And so the work here is an attempt to suggest some sort of singularities that one should definitely start thinking about. So, so, in most, most geometric flows and the simplest models for singularity formation have come from solitons in the flow. So in the context of laplacian flow, then what we mean by a soliton is we've got some GPU structure or vector field and some scalar. We want the g two structure to be closed. Then the sort of equation that we want is that now that the Hodge Laplace should be lambda times phi plus the lead derivative term.
00:35:45.884 - 00:37:19.868, Speaker B: And so, as usual, those correspond to similar solutions of Laplace and flow, where so they might form, can get pulled back by diffeo f together with dilated or expanded by this scale factor. So the dipio is generated by the, this vector field that again is distorted by the scale factor, which depends on the sign of lambda. And so with these sign conventions, then lambda. So this kappa is growing when lambda is positive. So these corresponding to expanders, so in particular, they will give rise to immortal solutions. So solutions that exist from some time up to infinite time, steady solitons, so things that exist for all time, or negative shrinkers for ancient solutions that started backwards minus infinity, but stop at some time. Okay, so just some obvious things to notice here.
00:37:19.868 - 00:38:03.344, Speaker B: So, the first thing to notice here is that this term we're saying this is closed. So by the carton formula, we've got two terms, one of which disappears. And so this term is exact. Also, one of these terms disappears because this is also exactly. So if lambda is not zero, then this three form is exact. So a non steady soliton, the three four, must be exact. So now also, if you just think about the behavior of volume, that volume is increasing along the flow, and that certainly means that you can't have any shrinkers.
00:38:03.344 - 00:38:36.664, Speaker B: And in fact, any steady one on a compact manifold must actually be stationary, must be a torsion free solution. One cannot rule out expanders, but at the moment, no compact expanders are known. And it's a non trivial question you answer, because again, the symmetry group of. So you would have no continuous symmetries for the hit band.
00:38:37.164 - 00:38:38.508, Speaker A: Mark, can I ask a question?
00:38:38.636 - 00:38:39.544, Speaker B: Yeah. So.
00:38:41.724 - 00:38:52.116, Speaker A: Whether or not there are any expanders that exist in the compact case, we don't, we haven't shown yet whether saltons are directly connected to singularity formation in this flow, have we?
00:38:52.260 - 00:38:52.876, Speaker B: No.
00:38:53.020 - 00:39:03.244, Speaker A: Okay, so, so even if we, even if one proves that there are no non stationary solitons, that doesn't mean there are no singularities.
00:39:05.464 - 00:41:32.220, Speaker B: No, I mean, I mean, in some sense, all of those, I mean, immortal, eternal and ancient, are in some sense more natural, just from the point of view of what are you going to obtain by a blow up procedure? But typically, there's some other blowdown procedures that in one of these other situations would also associate to them some soliton at infinity that may be kind of degenerate. But no, a number of basic things that are known in mean curvature flow and Ricci flow are still unknown in Laplace explosive. So, and then, as usual, then, you know, there's a scaling behavior that, you know, if I want to change the value of lambda, then I can do that by the appropriate scaling of other geometric quantities. So, in particular, you know, if I've got some original three form and x, which is a lambda skeleton, and I want to make it a k over two k over case lambda k over k two, then I have to scale the three form of the vector field like this. So this is important later on, mainly just as a difference between the steady case and the other cases, namely that rescaling a steady soliton gives me back another steady soliton, but otherwise changes the value of the parameter. So, so as I said, and as Piero pointed out, then we, we don't know the extent to which a singularity model in laplacian flow is necessarily modeled in any fancy. So, but that has been the case, at least sort of morally.
00:41:32.220 - 00:42:26.104, Speaker B: In most other flows one would come across. So it makes sense to start looking for solid arms as potential model for singularity. But already, you know, if I, obviously, if I put lambda zero and don't have a vector field, then this is just giving me back a torsion three g two structure. So this is something sort of potentially more exotic than this. So I certainly don't have too many methods for constructing those things. Pretty much the only things I could do would be try to do some kind of perturbation theory. But then I've got to start with something that's a reasonable almost solution, or otherwise I could look for things that have symmetrical.
00:42:26.104 - 00:43:56.004, Speaker B: And that's also the case to a large extent in Reiki flow, unless you're in the caloric flow context, in which again, you have some complex mongen pair going on. So in some sense, what we're going to look at is skeletons in Laplace and flow that have a reasonable but not kind of maximal symmetry. So maximal symmetry would be to ask that these things are homogeneous. And there is a literature on that. And, but I see that as maybe more relevant to understanding what might happen to laplacian flow. For he going to infinity when, you know, maybe in the same way that in Ricci flow, when you want to see, you know, what happens once you've done your sort of connect, connect some decomposition and towards infinity you want to see a thick, thin decomposition and see some of the geometries appearing with some collapsing, then this is maybe more relevant here. But I want to instead look at things where there's a group of symmetries acting with co dimension one.
00:43:56.004 - 00:44:44.836, Speaker B: And that I'm particularly interested in things that are shrinkers. So if they're shrinkers, we already know they must be non compact. And I would like to look at shrinkers that are asymptotically conical. So we also knew that if they're not steady, then they have to be exact. So if you start thinking about known g two holonomy metrics that are asymptotically conical, but now want to imagine deforming them a little bit. Then there's one on the spinner bundle of s three, but that has a associative compact three cycle. So that's definitely not exact.
00:44:44.836 - 00:45:49.534, Speaker B: But there are two other well known solutions. In the case due to Brian from Salomon on lambda two, plus or minus of cp two. Just depends on what orientation you give your cp two, whether you pull that plus or minus or on the same thing on the four sphere. So both of those have a lot of symmetry, st three in the cp two case, or st two in this case. Our goal is to try to find skeletons with their symmetry on this topology. So these are, this is a rank three bundle over cp two and a rank three bundle over s four with a certain symmetry. And in some sense, we can find things that are deforming away from a torsion free.
00:45:49.534 - 00:46:49.634, Speaker B: So, let me state what the three main results are, and then try to explain what goes into proving them. So the first, the first theorem is that if we look at steady prototons, then on cp two, on lambda two plus of cp two, but not on lambda two plus of s four, then there is a one parameter family of steady silicons asymptotic with a particular rate, all asymptotic to the torsion three g two cone that appears in the Bryant Salman metric. So these are steady non torsion free things that are asymptotic to a torsion free cone of infinity.
00:46:50.214 - 00:46:51.822, Speaker A: So, mark, can I ask a question?
00:46:51.958 - 00:46:52.638, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:52.806 - 00:46:58.434, Speaker A: So the Brian Solomon metric itself is not in this family. You said none of these are torsion free.
00:46:58.734 - 00:47:03.794, Speaker B: So the Brian Salomon one appears as a sort of degenerate limit of the.
00:47:04.484 - 00:47:09.264, Speaker A: Because that one is rate minus four, but somehow the rate gets much better in that limit.
00:47:09.684 - 00:47:13.464, Speaker B: So this minus one is, you know, it's.
00:47:15.364 - 00:47:21.844, Speaker A: So the minus one is definitely. It's not that. You know, it's. No, it's no worse than minus one. It actually is minus one.
00:47:21.924 - 00:47:26.980, Speaker B: Yeah, I see. I mean, this means it's decaying much slower to the cut.
00:47:27.012 - 00:47:27.676, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:27.860 - 00:48:32.138, Speaker B: Yeah. So. So I find this interesting in that certainly dirty skeletons in Ricci flow and caloriciflow have been fairly well studied. And for instance, in Ricci flow, then there's Brian steady skeleton that's f o n invariant. And a lot is now known about this, thanks to work of Brendel and others. But that has a kind of paraboloid geometry at infinity. So it certainly doesn't have the maximal volume growth in caloric flow, then there's an example, a very symmetric example, due to we don't.
00:48:32.138 - 00:49:50.350, Speaker B: And then sort of, you can take quotients of that and resolve to get lots more. Or there's a more recent analytic construction of Ronan, Conlan and Alex. Very well. But in that case, the volume growth is sort of half the dimension of the manifold in question. And so it's not clear, or it's clear that these steady solitons with sub maximal volume growth don't play sort of an interesting role in singularity formation in finite time, in Paleo Richie fluoride. So the fact that there are AC study solitons that deform away from caution free thing is, I think, an interesting feature of the Laplacian flow that makes it look a bit different from Ricci and caloricisol. So, second theorem is, um, there's an explicit ac shrinker on both of these bases with a particular rate minus two.
00:49:50.350 - 00:51:13.784, Speaker B: So shrinkers are relatively rare, and they're the typical way that you would think of modeling the formation of, in this case, the conical singularity. So, and then the third theorem says that again, both, on both of these spaces, then there is at least a one parameter family of completed standards on them, and in fact, conjecturally on the second one, then there should actually be a two parameter family of complete expanded. So this is sort of the simplest way in which you could again model Laplacian flow, smoothing out certain sorts of conical singularities, at least for a short time. Okay, so that's the result that I want to describe in a little bit more detail. So before I do that, I just wanted to ask, are there any questions just about the rough statements of the main results? Okay, so.
00:51:15.804 - 00:51:22.024, Speaker A: I have a question. So, yeah, when you say in theorem b, it's explicit, you mean you actually solve exactly the equations.
00:51:23.544 - 00:51:24.280, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:24.432 - 00:51:34.360, Speaker A: So, can you actually. So it's exact. No, it's not exact here. Can you actually say what the torsion is in that case, since it's explicit?
00:51:34.552 - 00:51:35.364, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:37.464 - 00:51:42.604, Speaker A: Are you going to tell us or. It's. Okay, I'll wait, I'll wait.
00:51:42.904 - 00:51:45.200, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm going to write down the solution.
00:51:45.312 - 00:51:47.964, Speaker A: Okay, good. Yeah, thanks.
00:51:49.184 - 00:52:39.544, Speaker B: So. All right, so let's just do a little bit, just about st three invariant g, two structures away from. So take out the zero section of this, of this rank three bundle, and now then that space is just r plus times the cross section. And then depending on whether m is cp two or s four, then that's six manifold, the flag manifold f twelve. So sd three mod p two or ep three. And then in this case, there's an action of the obvious action of sd three. In this case, there's an action of sd two.
00:52:39.544 - 00:53:52.804, Speaker B: And then it turns out, when I look at invariant two forms on this one, then there's a three dimensional space of those which are labeled omega one, omega three, omega three. And then there's, well, there are two invariant three forms, but only one of them is relevant. In our case, this, we'll call it alpha. And then our closed invariant three form, our closing variant g two structure should take this kind of form. So I've got three non negative functions or positive functions. So my three form has this sort of form that the sum of fi omega I f I squared omega I wedge dt, where p is arc length coordinate sort of perpendicular to the orbit. And then there's this final term, the product of the fis, and asking that this be closed.
00:53:52.804 - 00:55:05.300, Speaker B: Just knowing what the structure equations are for, these just tells you, if one equation here, if you think about what that says using this sort of, I mean, here's a geometric mean, and here's a sort of quadratic mean type thing. If you figure out what that says, it says that this derivative is at least a half. So this is controlling the volume growth. So if this thing ever is complete, then it must be, it must be, the volume must be growing at least like p to the 7th. So you can't have something collapsed. Okay, so then this is the case of fg three. You can regard the s, the cp two case of sort of sub case, as Clayton and Tuan sort of realized that basically, in that case, there are only two forms, which is basically a kind of combination of both these two forms here.
00:55:05.300 - 00:56:22.880, Speaker B: And so what you can end up doing is if you set f two equals f three here, and then apply everything else, then you can regard the sp two invariant case as a subcase of this one. So, but it has some extra from being the sort of general structure, then it's better to think about the sg three invariant case. But for being able to get some global control of things, in the end, it's sometimes convenient to restrict to the Fc two case. So one way you might think about trying to obtain a soliton would be to say, well, suppose that I start with a cone. Then what is my flow going to do to that cone? Is it going to smooth it out into something nicer locally? And for instance, that sort of what happens in you take a rotationally invariant metric, change the cone angle and the bryant. So n invariant solitons are obtained this way. But you could do the same kind of thing in this case.
00:56:22.880 - 00:57:32.658, Speaker B: But you have to start with a closed Gq cone. Otherwise it's not even permissible initial data for the closed laplacian flow. So let's think about these invariant GQ structures on this case, and let's think in terms of an overall scale and sort of the homosexual class of the inherited metric. So rather than just think of the coefficient f one, f two f three here, then I want to think of that divided by the volume. And then if you ask that this be closed and that this homosexual constant, then it turns out to force that g is linear and that this form is conical. So you end up getting that your fis are some constants times p I's, and the closed condition imposes one condition on those coefficients. So remember, the closed condition was saying this thing here.
00:57:32.658 - 00:58:23.880, Speaker B: So now you're saying c one, c two, c three, b cubed is now something quadratic. So three and two give you a six, and so you get six t one. So you've got this nonlinear condition on the CI's. So you have a sort of a two parameter family of closed cones. So what you might wonder is, is it possible to sort of run laplacian flow on each of those closed cones? And if so, what do I get out of it? You might also notice that again, suppose so. If I've got this condition here, then assuming this is not zero, then all of these CI's are non zero. So let's make a sign assumption that they're all positive.
00:58:23.880 - 00:59:15.554, Speaker B: So now I've got some positive triples. This thing scales like is homogeneous degree three. This is homogeneous degree two. So if we start with any positive triple, then there's some unique choice of scaling rescaling to satisfy that. So if you think of it now, then if you fix the sort of homosexual class of metric on sigma, then there is some kind of cone angle, a unique choice of cone angle that actually makes it a closed cone. So you need to write down what the Soliton conditions do. So, we've got the three form and the metric.
00:59:15.554 - 01:00:16.144, Speaker B: We assume also that the, I mean the vector field. We assume that the vector field is invariant as well. So it's just given by some function u. And then we're going to get some ode system for the f's and the u's, which when you first look at it, is second order in these, first order in u and has a bunch of constraints and looks a bit of a mess, but it's possible to, to rewrite it in a nicer way so that in the end, what you get is a first order system in five variables, where the five natural variables are these three coefficients, f one, f two, f three. And then these, uh, this is a closed g two structure. You can understand its torsion. Its torsion is always given by a two form of special algebraic type of type 14.
01:00:16.144 - 01:01:24.140, Speaker B: Um, we have a three dimensional space of invariant three forms, but only a two dimensional space of invariant three forms of type 40. So they turn out to be two coefficients that tell you the torsion form. So, roughly, there is a first order system where the components are these three coefficients here, plus two things that tell you the torture. And then, if I know those, in fact, u is completely determined, right? So that's not obvious, but turns out to be the case. So the question then is that we've got now this first order system in five variables, and a solution is a curve of those things. So this is telling us locally, at least, that for fp, three invariant solitons, the four parameter of family of solutions, and for fd, two invariant things, I've got f one, f two. And then it turns out that there's only one component of the caution in that case.
01:01:24.140 - 01:02:39.804, Speaker B: So there's three variables, and so there's a two parameter family of solutions. And then the whole job is to try to understand which of these solutions actually extends global. So the main somehow principle is that provided that these homophy ratios, or these ratios, f one over g, f two over g, remain bounded, then as t goes infinity, then you really will be asymptotic to a closed company. So the rough strategy is to sort of again, divide into three parts. So you want to understand. So this gives you sort of control in the middle, but you also want to have control near m and control near infinity. So you separate out control at zero and control at infinity.
01:02:39.804 - 01:03:58.174, Speaker B: The zero part turns out to be most standard part. It follows argument that goes back mainly to Eschenberg and Wang, but has also been used in the exceptional hormonomy cases by myself and other collaborators. This problem at infinity has a slightly different nature, and the answer depends on the sign of. Well, it depends on whether you're steady shrinking or expanding. And then the most subtle part is understanding the connection between geometry at one end and geometry at the other end. So maybe I should stop at that stage, since we're at the hour time now. And then, if anybody wants more details about any particular parts, I'm happy to oblige, either privately or publicly.
01:04:03.714 - 01:04:04.530, Speaker A: Thanks very much.
01:04:04.562 - 01:04:04.922, Speaker B: Mark.
01:04:05.018 - 01:04:06.374, Speaker A: Are there any questions?
01:04:09.514 - 01:05:27.734, Speaker B: So, there's Schrinker from CRMP. Do you know if it's unique? Sorry, can you say it again? I'm asking about uniqueness of, of the Schrenke from CRMB. So I believe that it's the unique one on lambda two plus of f four. I don't know. We still can't prove that. But there is sort of some, there are some compelling numerics that says among FP two invariant things, it's the only one. There is a general principle that sort of says even on lambda two plus of f four, you probably have only at most finitely many solutions, but how many is less clear? And there is a, there is a form of rigidity for laplacian shrinkers that hold certainly in this invariant case, but which I would conjecture holds more generally.
01:05:27.734 - 01:06:21.184, Speaker B: In the same spirit of, you know, Lu, Wang, Koch bar, etc. That, you know, there should be a kind of backwards unique continuation type result. And in this particular case, you see a kind of ode manifestation of that. But. So, yeah, on lambda two plus of s four, it should be the unique invariant one. And a teleton that's asymptotic to any of those phones should have the same symmetry as well. And so probably it's the only one, but there's still a lot that needs to be proven there.
01:06:21.184 - 01:06:44.474, Speaker B: And then. Spiro wanted to see the formula for it, I think. So. Let's see.
01:06:52.614 - 01:06:54.364, Speaker A: Okay, interesting.
01:06:54.744 - 01:07:11.552, Speaker B: So it's actually simpler than the Brian Salmon. And so you can see that. So the cone that it's at, the Brian Salomon cone, would have all of these being a half.
01:07:11.688 - 01:07:12.404, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:07:14.224 - 01:07:30.104, Speaker B: So this is definitely a closed, but not the solution is it's simple polynomial. And.
01:07:30.604 - 01:07:47.444, Speaker A: And what's the, on the link of this cone? That's the flag here, right? Or is it cd? So what do we know about the induced metric on the link? Is there anything special?
01:07:48.184 - 01:08:35.156, Speaker B: Well, I don't know really what? I mean, you know, the thing, the two coefficients that you have are now telling you a relative size of the, I mean, so this shrinker you can either regard as a shrinker on lambda t plus of x four or on the flag. So it's easier to think about on the f four case, because then it's just literally telling you something about the f four base to the s 25 size. And so it's telling you something about that relative to what would have happened in the Bryant salman case.
01:08:35.300 - 01:08:39.806, Speaker A: I guess what I meant is like, there's an su three structure on this, on this cp three.
01:08:39.990 - 01:08:40.630, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:40.742 - 01:08:45.034, Speaker A: It's not nearly kalar now, but half flat or something like that.
01:08:46.094 - 01:09:28.366, Speaker B: Yeah, but it. Yeah, but I mean, this, this tells you what that nearly kayla structure is. But what I'm saying is basically, you know, you, what you'll want to know is these, it's these values, p one and p two. And then this closed cone condition now gives you one condition on that. So six times c one, c two squared is e one squared plus two c two squared. And so there's a one parameter family of those things. And basically the, it's a smooth curve.
01:09:28.366 - 01:10:22.744, Speaker B: The torsion free thing fits somewhere in the middle. And then if you remove the torsion free thing, then it's got two components. Everything on one side of the torsion free thing appears as the asymptotic cone of an expander, a unique expander with sp two symmetry. And then this particular cone here is on the other side of that. And conjecturally, that's the only thing. That's the only cone that can appear as the asymptotic cone of a shrinker. But why that's the only one? I don't have a satisfactory answer at the moment.
01:10:22.744 - 01:11:05.824, Speaker B: I mean, we found the solution by, you know, you can find a, in order to solve the problem close to the cp two or s four, you have to do some kind of power theories. And in order to do numerics, you need to do it up to some reasonable order. We have done that symbolically. I started looking at this thing and it's sort of, oh, well, like ten terms in this disappear. If this value is this. Okay, let's see what that would tell me. And then you can, then you can see it has to be this.
01:11:05.824 - 01:12:59.084, Speaker B: And so I guess fundamentally the difference between the two cases is, is the sign of lambda doesn't make any difference when you understand, when you try to understand what happens near the singular orbit. So in, you know, so, but it does make a difference when you try to look at, you pick a closed cone at infinity and try to look at just an end that is asymptotic to that. So in our symmetric, in our highly symmetric case, that gives us some other kind of singular ode problem. But unlike the problem at the singular orbit, then it's a, it's a, quote, irregular singular value problem. So you find that there is a power theory solution to it, but the general solution is smooth, but need not be analytic. And so you find that you might have to worry about different solutions with the same Taylor theory, that infinity. But now, morally speaking, then depending on the sign of lambda, then, well, in both cases, somehow, morally speaking, the difference between two solutions, I mean, the two solutions that might have the same Taylor series differ by some kind of exponentials, but in one case, those are exponentially small.
01:12:59.084 - 01:13:49.656, Speaker B: And so in the expander case, then there really are. There is, for instance, to a given cone, there is a two parameter family of expanders asymptotic to the same cone that differ by exponentially small depths. On the other hand, if you try to look at shrinkers, then those exponential corrections would become exponentially large and would screw up that cone structure to infinity. So the difference is. So you have a five dimensional, sort of phase space. You have a two dimensional space of closed cones. Each of those, for expanders, have a two dimensional phase of ends.
01:13:49.656 - 01:14:45.424, Speaker B: So that gives you a four dimensional space of kind of conical ends, asymptotic conical ends, that fills up an open subset of the phase space when you evolve it. In the shrinker case, you've got still the same dimensional set of cones, but each one now has a unique solution. So now you only have a two dimensional space of things. So now you're trying to connect, say, the singular value problem is like a two dimensional curve inside of. I mean, a two dimensional sub manifold inside of your four dimensional space of solutions is trying to reach some other two dimensional thing at infinity. And so, generically, they should only intersect finally, many times. Whereas the skeleton, the expanders, is, if you could find one and make a small perturbation of it, it's an open condition.
01:14:45.424 - 01:15:51.776, Speaker B: And then the steady ones have a completely different. They have a completely different kind of asymptotic geometry. So the cone is somehow forced to be caution free, but the rate at which they become asymptotic to it is then different. But I think that's something that one should really pay some serious attention to from, you know, the point of view of, you know, developing some regularity theory, etcetera, because, you know, they. They appear as a definition of the torsion three asymptotically conical thing. In particular, I can make, point wise, the torsion as small as I like. So this is like in lagrangian mean curvature flow.
01:15:51.776 - 01:16:34.144, Speaker B: Then Dominic and collaborators constructed a family of translators where the lagrangian angle, the variation of the lagrangian angle is a small, if you like. So, you know, Andre had proved. Andre never said proven. You know, if something had some kind of. Maybe if it was in l two, then it had to be static. But this says, it's quite subtle as to what kind of gap type thing you can have that it can't be at the level. It can't be at a kind of point wise level.
01:16:34.144 - 01:17:40.692, Speaker B: So, so this, I think, is something that one should worry about. And Dominic conjectured in the lagrangian Ming curvature case that these steady, these translators could occur as finite time singularities unless you have flir theory reasons to rule them out. And so anything for which you need flur theory reasons to rule them out in Lagrange amine culture flow, I don't really see how you could, you know, rule out the corresponding g two things. So I would certainly be worried that these studies could appear as modeling finite time singularities. And. But is there any geometric intuition how such singularities could look like? I mean, for. For each flow, I mean, curvature flow, you have a quite geometric picture of the discharge neck pinch, and then you blow up at the tip and get the.
01:17:40.692 - 01:18:32.212, Speaker B: Get the quite solid underneath. Not really, because, again, we don't. We don't have any analogue of geometrization or something that we're trying to implement by the flow that guides you in the first place. Um, you know, we don't really know what, you know, what should the flow be trying to do to your original thing in. In a finite time singularity, say? Um, so, um, probably again, the. I mean, Dominic has some picture of how those things these translators might appear in laplace in mean curvature flow. So that might give you some guidance here.
01:18:32.212 - 01:19:24.180, Speaker B: So there is a. There is some way in which these things really are kind of formal analog of some things in lagrangian curve to flow. That was how I originally got into thinking about these. You could try to. So, for some g two manifold where you have a circle action, you can try to take the quotient and get something six dimensional. So, in the original g two holonomy case, if you choose the right circle, then topologically, at least, you get, you know, are thick. And the cones then are things where you've got a couple of planes in them.
01:19:24.180 - 01:19:54.886, Speaker B: And then the asymptotical things are things where you smooth out those planes. So in. So in. So you can think of in c three, take, you know, three reals and e to the I PI over three r three. That's the union of special lagrangian planes. And then there's the sort of most symmetric law enact that. Smooth them out.
01:19:54.886 - 01:21:00.274, Speaker B: So now if you want to get, say, an expander, then you, you know, you want to move them away from being area minimizing. So you push them so that the angle condition is no longer satisfied. So you push them together a bit. Then there is an expander with maximal symmetry asymptotic for that. So the expanders in the g two thing are somehow a bit like that. So you started with the forge and three solution, and then now there's a one parameter, kind of on one side of the forging free cone, there's a family of expanders. It's not quite as simple as that, because in Lagrange mean curvature flow, then the unions of planes are still a minimal thing, so it's still a critical point of volume.
01:21:00.274 - 01:22:12.144, Speaker B: And so then in that case, you get exponentially fast convergence to the plane. Here, you really do have to move the asymptotic cone to some closed but not torsion free thing, and then you only get polynomial decay to the cone. So they are an analogue of those skeleton solutions, these lagrangian mucosal skeletons, but they have some different wrinkles. And the steady skeletons are somehow in that picture. The steady solitons are what happens if your initial union of planes does not intersect transversely? And instead there's a line of singularities, and then roughly the steady skeleton is sort of unzipping things along a half line or something. They're unzipped, and the bit that they're unzipping moves along that axis. I don't know how to give a picture of that in the g two world.
01:22:12.144 - 01:23:02.944, Speaker B: Oh, good. But at least it corresponds to some degenerate situation. It should, I mean, in the lagrangian mean curvature flow, it corresponds to a degenerate situation. Here, you know, you can obtain these things. As you know, there should be a two parameter family of expanders, and then if you blow those down in the right way, then you should get a steady, which should be one of those things. So the studies appear as the blowdowns of, of some larger family of expanders. Hey.
01:23:04.684 - 01:23:09.004, Speaker A: I guess that's probably more than enough questions for Mark. Let's thank him again.
