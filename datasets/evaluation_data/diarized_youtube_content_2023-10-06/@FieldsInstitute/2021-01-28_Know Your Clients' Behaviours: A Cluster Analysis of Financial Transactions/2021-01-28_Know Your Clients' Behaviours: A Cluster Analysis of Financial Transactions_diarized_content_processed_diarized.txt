00:00:00.200 - 00:00:39.554, Speaker A: Wonderful. Thank you very much for the introduction, Sebastian, and thank you for the invitation to speak today. It's always nice to visit the Fields Institute, even virtually. And this is work that's from, I guess, my personal finance track of my research program. The title of my talk today is know your client's behavior, a cluster analysis of financial transactions. And this is work that I've done with some colleagues at Western, some colleagues at Laurier. And I want to highlight down here that this work started with the fields.
00:00:39.554 - 00:01:08.864, Speaker A: Field, SEcem laboratories that were in. In place a couple of years ago. So the. This is a project that we worked on initially in the field SECAM financial data analytics lab, and that we continue to work on today. Okay, so before I get rolling into the talk, some acknowledgments, some funding acknowledgments. Of course, I mentioned the field's CKM program. Funding program.
00:01:08.864 - 00:02:04.314, Speaker A: One of our partners has now sponsored a Mitax elevate postdoctoral fellowship that. Where that postdoc is continuing to work on problems related to this data set, NSERC has to be acknowledged, as does the support from Laurier and Western. Our investment dealer wishes to remain anonymous, but without this work or without their data, this work wouldn't happen. And without the input and discussions with some of the team members from that dealer, this work wouldn't have been possible either. I'll acknowledge them anonymously, if that makes any sense, and some other people that I can name. There are a number of people both at Western and at Laurier that were instrumental in completing this work. Chuck Grace at the business school at Western.
00:02:04.314 - 00:02:49.780, Speaker A: John Thompson, who's our postdoc, who's at Laurier in Western. Leon Feng, who's one of our research associates and at Data Wiz, and Matt Davison, who's here in the audience, and Adam Metzler from Laurier. Matt's, of course, at Western, and Jet Zhou, who is now at Western, who used to be at Laurier. There are also a few individuals from four Eyes financial who are the custodians of the data set, and they provided us the data, and we had many, many discussions with them about understanding the data set that we were given. Okay, I think I'm through all the acknowledgments. I hope I didn't forget anybody. And onto the talk.
00:02:49.780 - 00:03:47.194, Speaker A: Okay, so, just to give you an executive summary of what we did, what we did was we took our data set, which included a bunch of different types of information, and we clustered clients using features from a recency frequency, monetary profile, behavioral finance model, okay. And the information that we used to do the clustering was subjective and objective. Know your client information. So these are the questionnaires that you would go through when you sit down with an advisor, and they find out how you feel about risk and what your investment goals are and so on. And also transactions data. So in our data set, we have by account, by client account, we had transactions data for all of the clients that have dealings with this dealer.
00:03:48.354 - 00:03:49.254, Speaker B: Okay?
00:03:49.914 - 00:04:13.614, Speaker A: And what we found was that the client trading behavior is not informed at all by the KYC information. And in particular, it's not informed at all by KYC inferred risk tolerances. And we found this really surprising because this challenges the assumption that risk tolerance is going to be related to trading behavior.
00:04:14.764 - 00:04:15.620, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:15.772 - 00:05:11.414, Speaker A: And one of the outcomes of this, of this work is that we think that regulators and advisors should use more advanced techniques rather than the standard KYC questionnaires that are currently in use to better understand clients. Okay? So let's let me dive into the details a little bit. So, retail investors, they end up hiring financial advisors. And what the financial advisors do is they select and manage. Select the investments, manage the investments for the client, and also provide advice, advice on the investments and other financial matters. And the advisors have to provide advice and products that are suitable for each client. And by have to provide here, I mean, these are driven by financial regulations.
00:05:11.414 - 00:06:00.274, Speaker A: For example, the Ontario Securities Commission in 2014 described suitability as a meaningful dialogue with the client to obtain a solid understanding of the client's investment needs and objectives, and to explain how a proposed investment strategy is suitable for the client in light of the client's investments, needs and objectives. That's a pretty wordy definition of suitability, but really, it gets at the fact that advisors have to know their clients in order to provide the advice and products that they're providing and the services that they're providing to their clients. And this is, like I said earlier, this is something that's hardwired into financial regulations effectively in all jurisdictions in Canada and many jurisdictions around the world.
00:06:03.884 - 00:06:04.784, Speaker B: Okay?
00:06:06.684 - 00:07:03.624, Speaker A: And so when a client gets on board, typically what happens is there's a meeting with the advisor, and some know your client information is collected, usually in the form of a questionnaire. And there are sort of two types of information that are collected at this point. There's demographic and identifying information. So these are things like age, gender, occupation, income, social insurance number, address, telephone number, all that wonderful stuff. And then there's also subjective financial situation information. And these are things like questions that try to assess the risk preferences and tolerance of the client, some discussion on the investment goals, the time horizon for each account, and so on.
00:07:04.164 - 00:07:05.064, Speaker B: Okay.
00:07:06.324 - 00:07:13.504, Speaker A: Both types of information are then combined to determine somehow the client's risk tolerance.
00:07:14.204 - 00:07:14.796, Speaker B: Okay.
00:07:14.860 - 00:07:57.944, Speaker A: And then the risk tolerance is then used to determine the suitability of investments and advice that advisors give to clients. Okay. And when we initially went down this path and started analyzing this data set, we thought that groups of investors that had similar KYC attributes, know your client attributes, would have similar. Know your client risked, know your client inferred risk tolerances. That actually happens to be true, and also similar trading behaviors. And that happens to very much not be true. What we find is that.
00:07:57.944 - 00:08:23.232, Speaker A: I think I already just said this, the similar kytria attributes give similar risk tolerance. Risk tolerances and very different trading behaviors. And you'll see what I mean by that later on in the talk. Okay. A very brief literature review. Just. I'm going to pause for a second and take.
00:08:23.232 - 00:08:56.992, Speaker A: And grab a drink. Okay. So I've classified the literature review. This is going to be a very brief literature review. We recently had our paper accepted in. In a journal, and I'm happy to share that paper with you if you want. And there's a more, much more extensive literature review, of course, in the paper.
00:08:56.992 - 00:09:31.834, Speaker A: So I've classified these into three groupings. Suitability and know your clients. This is the first grouping of the literature review. This is suitability. Regulations appear in many jurisdictions, including Canada, US, UK, Europe, Australia, et cetera. And the existing research generally uses KYC information to study things besides trading behavior. And an example is a paper by Miano and Ross in 2017.
00:09:31.834 - 00:09:41.674, Speaker A: There is very little that is no research done on using subjective KYC information to study trading behavior.
00:09:42.204 - 00:09:42.660, Speaker B: Okay.
00:09:42.692 - 00:09:55.664, Speaker A: There has been some work by Picard and de Palma that looks at inferred risk tolerances through surveys, which would be similar to the KYC questionnaires that people fill out when they first meet with the advisor.
00:09:57.684 - 00:09:58.116, Speaker B: Okay.
00:09:58.140 - 00:10:34.394, Speaker A: But basically, there's nothing done in this exact space that we've been working in. This is trading behavior is the second grouping that I'll throw in the literature review. There's lots of. There's lots of work done in general on trading behavior. I've listed a few references here, three references here. Generally, this work uses either different tools than what we use or different data sets. We have a unique data set, so they're obviously using a different data set, or they have a slightly different focus for their study.
00:10:34.394 - 00:11:24.364, Speaker A: And the third grouping of the literature review is machine learning and finance. Many of you here are working in this area. Machine learning and data analytics is ubiquitous in finance. There's an overview paper by Rondo et al in 2019 that lists some of those applications, and it's been used in portfolio construction, financial distress prediction, banking risk management, credit card fraud detection, and anti money laundering. Basically, many, many areas of finance, but none that we found. Study retail client suitability and trading behavior. Okay, so this work fills that hole, or helps to fill that hole anyways.
00:11:24.364 - 00:12:08.860, Speaker A: Okay, so on to the data set. So we have the dealer that we. That provided the data set has over 30 years of experience in the industry. They have around 300 advisors that work with them, and about 5 billion in assets under management. The data set has information on about 24,000 clients, and those clients have about 52,000 accounts. So many clients would have more than one account. If you think about an individual, they might have a registered education savings plan for their kids, along with a retirement savings plan and maybe a tax free savings account.
00:12:08.860 - 00:13:04.274, Speaker A: So that would be three common accounts that an individual might have. So it's not surprising that obviously, that there are more accounts and clients in our data set. We have both subjective and objective know your client information, and we also have trade and transaction details on each client account. And the data set covers the period from January 1 to August 12, 2019. So about eight months of data. And it's a huge dataset, particularly the trade and transaction data set. Okay, so what type of information is contained in and do we use from the KYC data? Well, there's something called tombstone data.
00:13:04.274 - 00:13:47.334, Speaker A: So this could be information that might go on somebody's tombstone, like your gender, your name, your marital status, where you live, and all that kind of stuff, age and so on. Other types of information we've got, there's an indicated random variable to see whether, to determine whether or not a person's retired annual income, the self reported question about how knowledgeable of an investor the person is, the number of accounts that they have. And these types of information go into the profile features category in our recency, frequency, monetary and profile model that we're going to use.
00:13:47.834 - 00:13:48.546, Speaker B: Okay.
00:13:48.650 - 00:14:29.608, Speaker A: One thing I'll note here is that the subjective KYC data, subjective information is not used at all in the clustering that we're going to do. Okay. So the subjective data would be answers to the risk, the risk profile questions and things like investment goals and. And time horizon and so on. Okay. And as is standard with. With many of these supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, we do some feature engineering, and there are as I mentioned, just mentioned, there are four categories for our features.
00:14:29.608 - 00:15:13.724, Speaker A: Recency, frequency, monetary and profile features. I will mention that RFM models without the profile, these are generally used in business practices for marketing purposes, for businesses to understand their clients. And so we've just sort of adapted those types of models to this particular situation and added in the KYC profile data. Okay, the first two features, the first two classes of features, recency and frequency. There are only a couple of features, and they're very easy to understand. I'll get to that in a couple of slides. The features that are a little more difficult to understand, we're calling monetary features.
00:15:13.724 - 00:16:04.274, Speaker A: And monetary features effectively refer to features of different types of transactions. So we have a lot of different accounts, and each account can have many different types of transactions, some of which we think have no bearing on client behavior, and others we think have bearing on client behavior. And we've classified those transactions into three categories. Third party initiated trades. So these would be things like dividends that get paid out or interest payments that get put into a client account from their investments. Systematic trades, which are client initiated, but they are set up. So these would be sort of automatic withdrawals and automatic contributions or reinvestments of dividends.
00:16:04.274 - 00:16:13.234, Speaker A: And then there are also what we're calling periodic trades, which would be ad hoc client initiated trades.
00:16:18.894 - 00:16:19.350, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:19.382 - 00:16:52.978, Speaker A: And I'm going to provide a bit more detail on these monetary, these types of transactions on the next slide. Excuse me. Okay, so what I've got here is a histogram of the top 30 transaction types in our data set. Along the x axis here, I've got frequency. So I know it's kind of hard for you to see this. So this scale here is 300,000 transactions, okay? Of a particular type. And on the y axis here, I've got different types of transactions.
00:16:52.978 - 00:17:24.484, Speaker A: So the most frequent transaction in the data set is what? Something called a book value adjustment. The second most frequent transaction is a reinvested dividend, okay? And then there are transactions like fees, HST sells, buys, income distributions, dividends, and so on. I'm not gonna list all of them, but the point is that there are lots of different transactions, and we think that some of them, you can get some information about client behavior from some of them, but not all of them.
00:17:24.944 - 00:17:25.872, Speaker B: Okay?
00:17:26.048 - 00:18:17.916, Speaker A: And the bars that I just turned green, these are, this is the class of features that we're calling third party initiated trades. These are the dividends, the income distributions, and the interest payments that clients get from holding certain investments in their accounts, okay? So we're putting those all into one category. The second category, there are the bars that are getting shaded, I guess red or pink. These are systematic trades. So these are client initiated, but they're automatic transactions. So they're automatic withdrawals, pre authorized contributions, reinvested dividends, and so on. Okay, and then the final grouping of features is what we call periodic trades.
00:18:17.916 - 00:18:38.704, Speaker A: And these are ad hoc client requests. And there are lots of different types of these. I've shaded them purple in the frequency histogram. So there are buy and sell orders. Those are the two most common ones. And then there are other ones like withdrawals, eft deposits, spousal contributions, and so on.
00:18:39.644 - 00:18:40.504, Speaker B: Okay.
00:18:41.004 - 00:19:16.784, Speaker A: And so these are the types of transactions that we pulled out. Notice that there are still some black bars here that didn't get shaded a different color. These correspond to features or transactions that we didn't do anything with. So, paying of taxes, paying of fees and so on. Those were not things that we did. It looked at in terms of features to be used for the clustering. Okay, let me roll on here.
00:19:16.784 - 00:19:44.344, Speaker A: Okay, so this, this table sort of summarizes the features that we use, that we've extracted and that we're, that we use in the clustering. The recency feature. This is simply the number of days since, since the last trade in the data set. Okay, the frequency features. There were, there are two types. Two, two features corresponding to the frequency type. Total number of trades in the time period, average number of days between trades.
00:19:44.764 - 00:19:45.704, Speaker B: Okay.
00:19:46.924 - 00:20:10.238, Speaker A: For the monetary type of feature, there were a number of different features. There were two here that are buy and sell size totals over the time period. And then there are four features. The buy size, minimum and maximum value. That's two of them. And the sell size, minimum and maximum value. So that's another two.
00:20:10.238 - 00:20:35.364, Speaker A: So there are four features there. And then for each of the different trade types. So our third party initiated trades, systematic trades and periodic trades. We have trade size, and so average trade size and the standard deviation, or variability of trade size. Okay, and so there are, there are six features here, two variables for each of the trade types.
00:20:37.264 - 00:20:37.880, Speaker B: Okay.
00:20:37.952 - 00:21:00.364, Speaker A: And then the profile variables. We're using age, age, gender, residency, annual income, investment knowledge, number of accounts, marital status, and retirement indicator. And that gives us a total of 23 features that we use in the clustering algorithm. And where, where needed, we just add these features to the client records before we do the clustering.
00:21:02.184 - 00:21:03.044, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:08.064 - 00:21:12.084, Speaker A: Okay, let me give. I need a. I'll get, I'll pause and have a.
00:21:22.084 - 00:21:22.468, Speaker B: Mark.
00:21:22.516 - 00:21:24.344, Speaker C: There's a couple of questions in the chat.
00:21:24.804 - 00:21:27.548, Speaker A: Okay, sure, Matt.
00:21:27.596 - 00:21:37.116, Speaker D: I think we'll take, let's take them at the end. That's what I was suggesting, that we take them, leave the questions for the end, and then ask the audience to ask them themselves.
00:21:37.220 - 00:21:37.944, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:42.724 - 00:22:32.910, Speaker A: Okay, so our clustering algorithm. So this is the algorithm that we used was a k prototypes algorithm. And so this extends, this extends the k means algorithm that is standard. And what this does is it allows for mixed variable types. So we have a mixture of features here that are numeric and categorical. And so this k prototypes algorithm allows for both types of variables in the analysis. And as with any clustering algorithm, what the goal is to put clients into groups or clusters, such that there's, each client belongs to one and only one group.
00:22:32.910 - 00:22:39.994, Speaker A: The clients within clusters are similar, and the clients in different cluster clusters are dissimilar.
00:22:40.434 - 00:22:41.378, Speaker B: Okay.
00:22:41.546 - 00:23:17.544, Speaker A: And so the clustering procedure, of course, is an iterative procedure. You have to kick it off by specifying cluster centroids initially. And then what you do is you put people into clusters, you put individuals into clusters and calculate some loss function. And then what you do is you update your cluster centers and reallocate people to the clusters, calculate the loss function again, and see if your loss function improved or not. And you keep on doing this until the loss function doesn't improve.
00:23:18.124 - 00:23:18.596, Speaker B: Okay?
00:23:18.620 - 00:24:07.814, Speaker A: And once that's done, you have your clusters. Before you do all of that, though, you have to specify the number of clusters that you want. And so there's an open question of how many clusters should you have for your particular data set. There are a couple of different ways of choosing the optimal cluster number. We looked at two in particular that are popularly used, one called silhouette coefficient, one called the DB index. And both of these measures told us that the optimal number of clusters in our data set happened to be five. And one thing that we use to try and visualize the clusters are these t distributed stochastic neighbor embeddings.
00:24:07.814 - 00:24:30.924, Speaker A: So, on the x axis in this plot is what we call embedding one. On the y axis is embedding two. And effectively what this is, is it's a way of projecting the high dimensional client data down into lower dimensions. It's similar to principal components analysis, but not exactly the same.
00:24:31.264 - 00:24:32.000, Speaker B: Okay.
00:24:32.112 - 00:24:40.164, Speaker A: And so the cloud of points here, these are all of the 52,000 accounts that we have in our data set projected onto these two embeddings.
00:24:41.224 - 00:24:42.040, Speaker B: Okay?
00:24:42.192 - 00:25:21.794, Speaker A: And if you just look at these, it's kind of like looking in the clouds. You can, you can see shapes and I don't know. Maybe you can see animals or something, like when you're staring at fluffy clouds in the sky. If we ask everybody in the room how many clusters there are in this data, we'd probably get 15 different answers. And so what we did after we did the clustering, what we can do is we can actually label the data points with different colors. And that's exactly what I've got on this next slide. Here is our five clusters that we found labeled with different colors.
00:25:21.794 - 00:25:38.086, Speaker A: And you can see that our clustering algorithm does a. Does a fairly good job of separating the points. Of course, it doesn't do a perfect job. We've got some. There's some blue points down here. There's some orange points here. Of course, there's some blue here and some green here.
00:25:38.086 - 00:26:18.370, Speaker A: There's some overlap in these clusters. But remember, we're projecting a high dimensional, high dimensional data down to just two dimensions here. You can also do these embedding plots in three dimensions, and we've looked at those, and a three dimensional plot shows that there's some pretty rigid boundaries between these. Between these clusters that we found. I guess one thing to point out is that the smallest cluster contains 7% of the data. The largest cluster contains about 35% of the data. So there's no one cluster that dominates this data set.
00:26:18.370 - 00:26:44.064, Speaker A: And there isn't one cluster that's super tiny and insignificant either. Okay? So once we have our clusters, what we then do is we go back and look at the attributes of the individuals within each cluster to see what types of individuals fall in those clusters.
00:26:45.364 - 00:26:45.868, Speaker B: Okay?
00:26:45.916 - 00:27:00.104, Speaker A: And that's what this. This next slide is a first step in that direction. So if you look at the upper, the upper left plot here, I've got a stacked bar plot of residency by cluster.
00:27:00.484 - 00:27:01.196, Speaker B: Okay?
00:27:01.300 - 00:27:25.904, Speaker A: So this is cluster one, cluster two, cluster three, and so on. And the y axis here is percentage within each cluster. And I know that the legend is kind of small here, but these are different provinces in the country. Of course. The red one is Ontario, the purple one is BC, and the dark purple one is Alberta.
00:27:27.044 - 00:27:27.804, Speaker B: Okay?
00:27:27.924 - 00:27:57.214, Speaker A: And you can see there's not a whole lot of variation, with the possible exception of maybe of Ontario being overweight in cluster one, there's not a whole lot of variation in the. The residencies across clusters. Okay, if we go to the top right panel, we've got the bar plot of gender. Of gender for each cluster. And basically what we have. What we see here is we've got a 50 50 gender split in every single cluster. So we're not.
00:27:57.214 - 00:28:46.514, Speaker A: Gender is unimportant when forming clusters in this way. Okay, bottom left panel, we've got age distributions for each of the five clusters. So on the x axis here, I've got age y axis here, I've got probability density function and each line here corresponds to a fitted probability density function for the age distribution in each cluster. So this one cluster, this is cluster four. There seem to be older individuals in this cluster than in the other clusters. And the blue cluster here is cluster two. And it looks like the age profile in cluster two is slightly younger than in the other clusters.
00:28:46.514 - 00:29:55.404, Speaker A: In the bottom right panel, I've got a stacked bar plot of account type. We didn't use account type as one of the features in the clustering algorithm and so I've got percentage within each cluster of the different account types. I mentioned earlier that some of the account types are registered education savings plans, tax free savings accounts and so on. And I guess one thing I want to just bring your attention to is if you look at cluster four, which on the bottom left panel plot has the older investors. Cluster four is overweight in retirement income funds compared to the other clusters, and that's not surprising because they have older investors. Once you reach a magic age, your retirement, registered retirement savings plans have to be converted into a retirement income fund, in which case you have forced annual withdrawals. And so the fact that cluster four, which has older investors, has a higher percentage of RiF accounts and it is unsurprising.
00:29:55.404 - 00:30:54.524, Speaker A: Okay? And we can, I'm not going to go on with the sort of KYC information, but I want to go on and look at some of the trades and transactions data that we use to classify, to classify the individuals on, and look at the different clusters along that axis. So what I've got here is I've got the third party initiated average average trade size along the x axis here, I've got time, the y axis is average trade size. And I've got, each line here corresponds to a different cluster, each line corresponds to a different cluster, and the shaded regions give upper and lower 95%, 5% and 95% quantiles of the distributions.
00:30:55.224 - 00:30:56.152, Speaker B: Okay?
00:30:56.328 - 00:31:33.124, Speaker A: And just by looking at that, you can see this is state. I feel like I'm captain obvious. Some of these lines are not like the others. So there are differences between clusters among the third party initiated trades. Cluster two here, the blue line is all by itself down at the bottom, okay? It has a smaller, smaller average third party initiated trade side trade size clusters, the purple line and the orange line. So clusters three and five tend to go together and clusters one and four tend to go together.
00:31:36.244 - 00:31:37.144, Speaker B: Okay.
00:31:42.924 - 00:32:01.104, Speaker A: One final thing I'll point out here before I go on to the next slide is that the, just note the scale here. So these are the scale on the y axis here. The trade size is on the order of hundreds. So these would be things like dividends that you get paid, interest payments and so on.
00:32:04.854 - 00:32:05.754, Speaker B: Okay?
00:32:07.174 - 00:32:53.664, Speaker A: So going on to the next slide, I'm looking at the average monthly trade size now for systematic trades, okay? And I'm doing this by cluster again along the x axis, I've got time. Along the y axis I've got a dollar amount or average monthly trade amount. And if you look at these are order of magnitudes, an order of magnitude difference between this slide and the previous slide. Again, to state the obvious, cluster two, the blue line is not like the other lines. It's off by itself. And it's pretty clear here that clusters, clusters three and five tend to move together and clusters one and four tend to move together too with these systematic traits.
00:33:00.344 - 00:33:00.984, Speaker B: Okay?
00:33:01.064 - 00:33:43.116, Speaker A: And finally, for the periodic trades, so these trades, the periodic trade sizes, so these trades, again, are ad hoc client initiated trades. So these would be buy and sell orders that clients would call into the advisor along the x axis here, I've got time. The y axis here, I've got average trade amount. And again, I'll note here, look at the, look at the scale. And this is an order of magnitude bigger than the systematic trade sizes that we, that we just, that we just looked at, okay? Again, cluster two all by itself, okay? Down at the bottom, they basically, people in cluster two don't do any periodic trades.
00:33:43.300 - 00:33:44.184, Speaker B: Okay?
00:33:45.284 - 00:33:59.424, Speaker A: The other thing that stands out now is cluster one is up here all by itself, okay? So these are people that are doing large, frequent periodic trades. And then the other three clusters kind of behave similarly.
00:34:00.764 - 00:34:09.052, Speaker B: Okay? Okay.
00:34:09.108 - 00:35:13.884, Speaker A: So just to summarize what, what I just went through with those, with those plots, the most important features in determining cluster membership are the transactions data that we use to construct the monetary frequency and recency features and the profile features from the KYC data are less important. Okay, I'm just going to pause for a second and have a, okay, so once we've done a thorough analysis of the clusters, generally what's done is Personas are made so that we can identify the clusters with, with, with people that might exist.
00:35:14.424 - 00:35:15.256, Speaker B: Okay?
00:35:15.400 - 00:35:53.278, Speaker A: And so to summarize, cluster one, we've called them active traders, okay? They trade frequently in large amounts and in an ad hoc ad hoc trading pattern. Okay, so these were, these were the periodic trades. Okay. This was the green line on that last, that last plot that I showed you that was way above all the other average trade amounts for periodic trades. Cluster two are the early savers. They do systematic transactions. They don't do any active trading.
00:35:53.278 - 00:36:25.604, Speaker A: And these are generally younger people. There are people that we call the cluster three. We call the just in time investors. They trade manually. So periodic trades that are client initiated less frequently and in smaller amounts than the active traders of cluster one. So the big, the really big gamblers, I guess, in cluster one, or at least people that like to buy and sell a lot. Cluster four, if you remember, these are the older investors.
00:36:25.604 - 00:36:41.904, Speaker A: They trade infrequently. Generally they rely on systematic or third party initiated transactions. And these people are generally older, and they have slightly lower KYC inferred risk tolerances.
00:36:42.444 - 00:36:42.900, Speaker B: Okay?
00:36:42.932 - 00:37:06.324, Speaker A: And I'm going to show you in a minute a slide of the KYC inferred risk tolerance distributions for each of the clusters, which is what I think is one of the really interesting parts of this work. In cluster five, we call them systematic savers. They do recurrent small systematic trades and large periodic transactions as well.
00:37:08.144 - 00:37:08.880, Speaker B: Okay?
00:37:08.992 - 00:37:51.854, Speaker A: So we go from data to Personas and investors, or I guess advisors can use this, these Personas, when they're trying to understand clients and when they're talking to clients to see what type of. What type of Persona a particular client might have. Okay? So I promised you the distribution of risk. KYC inferred risk tolerances by clusters. And that's exactly what this plot is. In the upper left panel, I've got the cluster of cluster one, which are the active traders. So I've got the client inferred risk tolerance score here.
00:37:51.854 - 00:37:58.654, Speaker A: In these. In this scale, one is low risk, five is high risk.
00:38:00.874 - 00:38:01.418, Speaker B: Okay.
00:38:01.466 - 00:38:06.254, Speaker A: And so, three, this again, to state the obvious, this is medium risk.
00:38:07.154 - 00:38:07.874, Speaker B: Okay?
00:38:07.994 - 00:38:26.882, Speaker A: And so the upper left panel is for active, active traders. The middle left panel is for just in time traders. That's cluster three. The bottom left panel is cluster five. These are the systematic savers. The middle right panel is cluster four. These are the older investors.
00:38:26.882 - 00:38:35.334, Speaker A: And cluster, the upper right distribution is for the young savers.
00:38:35.634 - 00:38:36.570, Speaker B: Okay.
00:38:36.762 - 00:39:23.634, Speaker A: And a few things that stand out here pretty much. Sorry, I guess the bottom right panel, these are all of the densities overlaid. And I've just circled the giant spike that is apparent in all of these distributions. Effectively, most of the people are classified by their KYC information as medium risk investors. Okay, you can see some slight differences. If I look at the distribution for the older investors, you can see a slight, remember, lower numbers here are low risk, higher numbers are high risk. So you can see a higher proportion of older investors are low risk compared to the, for example, cluster one, the active traders.
00:39:23.974 - 00:39:24.834, Speaker B: Okay.
00:39:25.854 - 00:40:28.954, Speaker A: But what we did, we did a statistical analysis, of course, of these different distributions to see if there were any differences between them. And all of the tests that we did reported basically no differences between any of these distributions. So what that really means is the distribution of risk tolerance is the same for each cluster. So the KYC informed or inferred risk tolerance score is the same across all of the clusters. And I've shown you evidence that the risk, the trading behavior, of course, is not the same across all of the, all of the clusters. And that's the thing that I think is the most interesting part of this work. Okay, so, to summarize, we clustered clients using a recency frequency monetary profile behavioral finance model.
00:40:28.954 - 00:40:45.654, Speaker A: Client trading behavior is not informed by the subjective and objective KYC information, and in particular, by the KYC inferred risk tolerances. This challenges the assumption that risk tolerance and trading behavior are related.
00:40:46.874 - 00:40:47.802, Speaker B: Okay.
00:40:47.978 - 00:41:21.394, Speaker A: And our current and ongoing work looks at trading behavior and the actual asset mix that the clients hold in their accounts. It uses the security risk ratings for each of the products that the client holds in the accounts. And what it does is, it looks to tie the actual risk or compare the actual risk that clients take on with the KYC prescribed risk tolerances. And. Thank you for your attention. I will wrap up and end there.
00:41:22.214 - 00:41:45.664, Speaker D: Wonderful. Thank you, Mark. Quite interesting talk. There's been some questions posted in the chat here, and I guess I'll call upon the questioners to see if they would like to ask them themselves. So, first up we have Louis Belisley. Would you like to unmute yourself? And if you want, turn on your camera and ask the question.
00:41:46.164 - 00:41:57.984, Speaker E: Yeah, hi. Hi, Sebastian. Hi, Bart. So, yeah, my question is, when. When you motivated, you said that there's not a lot of KYC. Yeah. Basically your same conclusion.
00:41:57.984 - 00:42:26.414, Speaker E: That doesn't really tie to trading behavior. The way I understand KYC regulation is more about making sure that the banks have accountability, or that at least, like, the investors have accountability on who their clients are in order to prevent money laundering. So if that's the case, we wouldn't expect necessarily that to match with their trading behavior. So, do you have a sense on how the KYC is more geared towards AML, like anti money laundering, or actually.
00:42:26.794 - 00:43:17.744, Speaker A: For trading patterns, it is used for anti money laundering, but it's also used for advisors to provide suitable advice to their clients. For example, you wouldn't, an advisor would be, would not, would not advise a, an 85 year old person on a fixed income to put all, an 85 year old person put all their money on, you know, an equity option and have that as a suitable investment for their client. Okay. And they need to, the know your client regulations are designed to make sure that the advisors are providing suitable recommendations for their clients in addition to some of the other uses like anti money laundering that you mentioned.
00:43:18.844 - 00:43:39.804, Speaker E: Okay, so how do we map that to. So, yeah, the KYC regulation to ensure kind of fiduciary duty. And so how do we map that with the fact that, yeah. What you're, do you have any clue as to why what you're finding doesn't have this trading behavior highlighted by KYC patterns.
00:43:43.464 - 00:44:06.564, Speaker A: You'Ve interested in? No, that's, that's, that's the interesting thing. Right. We found, we found that the trade. Well, I guess the hypothesis is that trading behavior would somehow be, would inform risk preferences and risk tolerances that, that clients have and that are not being revealed through the KYC information and that's being collected by advisors.
00:44:08.114 - 00:44:08.746, Speaker E: Okay, cool.
00:44:08.770 - 00:44:09.042, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:44:09.098 - 00:44:10.814, Speaker E: That's interesting. Yeah, thank you.
00:44:11.994 - 00:44:21.814, Speaker A: And that's kind of that analysis of that risk is part of the follow up that we're doing or the other study that we're currently just wrapping up.
00:44:23.154 - 00:44:34.014, Speaker D: Okay, cool. So next we have Yiyo Xi. Would you like to ask your question, unmute and turn on your camera, or shall I read it?
00:44:34.974 - 00:44:48.674, Speaker F: Yeah, sure. So, hi, Mark. Thank you for the presentation. So my question is, is this a mutual fund data or a group of self directed accounts? Data.
00:44:51.294 - 00:45:08.194, Speaker A: It's not self directed accounts. All of the clients are working with advisors, and so they, it's not a self directed account. Many of the products, most, by far most of the products that in the clients invest in through this dealer are mutual funds.
00:45:09.454 - 00:45:20.514, Speaker F: So all the transactions are based on the advice given by the advisors, not from themselves, like, who executed the transaction.
00:45:23.494 - 00:45:49.282, Speaker A: The broker executes the transactions, but the client can ask the advisor, I've got $100. I've got $100. I want to buy more of this mutual fund. And then the advisor does it. So there are different, two different types of advisors. There are discretionary advisors and non discretionary advisors and discretionary advisors. I might get this mixed up.
00:45:49.282 - 00:46:10.174, Speaker A: Discretionary advisors can trade on the client's behalf without actually taking direction from the client. And the non discretionary ones have to wait for the clients to approve trades. So they can, they can suggest trades or investments to clients, but they can't make the trade until the client says, yes, I want to do that.
00:46:11.034 - 00:46:11.690, Speaker F: Thanks.
00:46:11.802 - 00:46:13.586, Speaker A: Okay. Does that clarify things?
00:46:13.690 - 00:46:28.034, Speaker F: Yeah. And is there any, like, big discrepancy between the know your client information and their actual traits? Like, what's the purpose of this study to understand that?
00:46:29.894 - 00:47:02.004, Speaker A: Well, the, the thinking is that the know your client information is going to, is going to be related somehow to trading behavior, which is also, in turn, related to the actual risk preferences of the clients and the people. And what we've shown is that there's a disconnect between the information used in the KYC and the actual trading behavior. So if trading behavior is reflective of actual risk preferences and tolerances, then KYC is not necessarily the best tool to get at that information.
00:47:02.664 - 00:47:03.288, Speaker B: Okay.
00:47:03.376 - 00:47:04.844, Speaker F: Thank you very much.
00:47:07.464 - 00:47:34.972, Speaker D: Okay, great. There's another question here by Yanis Siligakis. Would you like to unmute yourself and turn on your video to ask the question? Okay, maybe they're not here anymore, or would, would like me to ask. So I'll read it out for you. So how can you, Yanis asks. Oh, hello. No.
00:47:34.972 - 00:47:44.944, Speaker D: Okay, so, Yanis asks, how can you infer the risk tolerance by surveys or by type of trade activity?
00:47:46.844 - 00:48:14.904, Speaker A: Okay, well, that's, that's a great question. The risk tolerances scores that I presented here, those are inferred by discussions between the advisor and the client. And so there's all of the information that's collected, the KYC information, and responses to those questions. There's a questionnaire that gets filled out. Those questions get shoved into an algorithm and out spits a risk tolerance score.
00:48:15.744 - 00:48:16.504, Speaker B: Okay.
00:48:16.624 - 00:48:52.064, Speaker A: And it has nothing to do, that has nothing to do with the trade activity or type. And so that's the thing that's kind of interesting, is that it seems like everybody gets assigned a similar risk tolerance. If I go back to, go back to this slide here, across all clusters, you've got the same risk tolerance distribution, the KYC inferred risk tolerance distribution. And if I go back one more slide. Well, not more here. Three more slides. Here's some trading activity or trading behavior for the different clusters that are clearly not the same.
00:48:53.124 - 00:48:53.860, Speaker B: Okay.
00:48:53.972 - 00:49:03.504, Speaker A: And if we think that trading behavior is related to risk preferences and risk tolerances, then there's something else that's missing in the understanding of clients.
00:49:06.624 - 00:49:18.368, Speaker D: Okay, maybe one more from the audience, and then I want to ask one. So, Fabio Samarco, would you like to ask your question, unmute yourself and turn on your video. Yes.
00:49:18.416 - 00:49:18.968, Speaker G: Hi, Mark.
00:49:19.056 - 00:49:24.120, Speaker A: Hope you can hear me. I can. It's good to hear you again. Yeah.
00:49:24.152 - 00:50:01.604, Speaker G: So I had a question. I really like your presentation, Mark. It's very, very useful. I was thinking in terms of, like, of, let's say a company that try to move people between classes because, for example, unearthly savers may, over time, become active traders. So you can give up targeted offer, say, okay, I give you $5 trade instead of ten, try to move it to active traders. Is there a way, I don't know if you maybe looked at it already, but is there a way to see movements over time of these clusters? So, basically, try to see if your offers is effective in pushing a client from being an early service to active traders, for example.
00:50:03.054 - 00:50:03.638, Speaker B: Hmm.
00:50:03.726 - 00:50:18.554, Speaker A: That's a. That's a great question. We haven't. We haven't looked at tracking different clusters over time. You would have to find. I think there is a way. We just haven't looked at that.
00:50:18.554 - 00:50:22.194, Speaker A: There.
00:50:23.374 - 00:50:25.758, Speaker D: Your data set is about nine months.
00:50:25.886 - 00:50:26.906, Speaker A: Yeah. Right?
00:50:27.030 - 00:50:27.426, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:50:27.490 - 00:50:56.734, Speaker A: Yeah, there is. So there isn't. It's not a long data set, first of all, but it, you know, there might be some people. There would be some people in that data set that would have had some. Some family events like births, deaths, marriages, separations and so on. Things that can have a real impact on your risk tolerance scores that might have been updated so that some of that information would have been captured. I really don't know.
00:50:56.734 - 00:51:39.864, Speaker A: I really don't know off the top of my head if there's a way to track this through time. The thing is, if you do clustering with different snapshots in time of data, there's nothing that says an individual. You'll have the same number of clusters. Those cluster makeups will be the same. And that if it's, say, if somebody was an early saver, if nothing has changed in their life, you would think that they would end up with the other early savers at a different snapshot in time, but maybe not. So. Yeah, it's not a very useful answer to your question, Fabio, so I'm sorry about that.
00:51:39.864 - 00:51:41.464, Speaker A: All right.
00:51:42.364 - 00:51:46.516, Speaker G: I like the grouping. It's very useful and actionable for a company.
00:51:46.580 - 00:51:47.184, Speaker A: So.
00:51:48.104 - 00:51:52.764, Speaker D: So, Tom, why don't you go. I see you post a question there. Go for it.
00:51:53.304 - 00:52:17.964, Speaker C: Yeah, I just thought, Mark, perhaps you offer an opinion about the KYC process. I mean, I'm imagining the advisors are not incentivized to take this seriously, and so they just assign everybody the mid assessment. Do you think the process is well designed, or are there obvious flaws that could be corrected?
00:52:22.374 - 00:53:35.816, Speaker A: I don't know enough about the KYC process to really answer that question. Well, I know that I think there might be some people in the audience that are much more versed with the KYC protocol than me. It looks to me like the risk tolerances, the questionnaires, typically they get answered, and then theres a discussion about investment goals. And I dont think this is necessarily a flaw in the process, but after the discussion about investment goals, thats when people realize, hey, they need to take on a bit more risk. And maybe some of those answers to the risk tolerance questions that they did previously really werent. I dont want to say werent the right answers, but as people, through further discussions, people can move from, you know, being totally risk averse to being, yeah, okay, I'm okay with taking on a bit of risk here, and I don't know if that's a flaw in the process, but it's certainly a non standard part of the process. And the KYCs that are done, they're not prescribed by any of the regulators.
00:53:35.816 - 00:53:50.728, Speaker A: They just give sort of guidelines about suitability. And the dealers themselves have to, or the advisors themselves have to come up with their own, their own processes in order to ensure compliance. Yeah.
00:53:50.816 - 00:54:03.952, Speaker C: So, I mean, a system that generates, you know, on a five point scale, and everybody comes out with level three, then it sort of says that it's not a very useful exercise, so. Okay.
00:54:04.048 - 00:54:12.264, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. No, I don't disagree with you, Tom. I don't disagree with you, but it's. How to fix that. I don't know.
00:54:12.644 - 00:54:29.424, Speaker D: Thanks, Mark. I had a similar question. One of my questions was similar to Tom's, but if you go back one slide, I think that's where you have this distribution of the KYC for each cluster. Is that right? On slide 24, this one? Yeah. Right.
00:54:29.844 - 00:54:30.412, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:30.508 - 00:54:56.512, Speaker D: So what strikes me about this is not just that the mode is at number three, but also, if you look at every single cluster, these are not simply statistically statistical. Deviation from one histogram to the next is not simply insignificant, but from one to the next. They're super, super close with features that are kind of irregular.
00:54:56.568 - 00:54:56.784, Speaker A: Right.
00:54:56.824 - 00:55:08.154, Speaker D: You see this little to the right of the peak? Okay. There's a little trough, and then there's a peak, and then there's another trough, and then a peak. And that persists in every single one. Okay. Except for the gray one where it's.
00:55:08.194 - 00:55:11.010, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you're absolutely right.
00:55:11.162 - 00:55:29.714, Speaker D: And, and, and then the spike at number two is also identical across these clusters. So this seems, you know, to indicate to me that this cluster. Sorry, not the cluster. The KYC measure, or however they're coming up with it, is flawed in some way.
00:55:29.754 - 00:55:29.986, Speaker A: I don't.
00:55:30.010 - 00:55:45.474, Speaker D: I don't know. That's what it seems to indicate to me. But I was wondering, what are your thoughts about why these distributions not only are, you know, statistically indistinguishable from one another, but even in the eyeball norm, appear to be pretty much the same.
00:55:46.614 - 00:56:05.034, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, there's certainly, certainly you've. You've picked up on the fact that these are lumpy. Right. And so. Excuse me, this, too, here would correspond to a medium low risk client. Four would correspond to a medium high risk client.
00:56:05.034 - 00:56:33.644, Speaker A: And the way. The way that. The way that this dealer does things is once they receive all of the information from the. From the KYC information, what they do is they prescribe a risk. A risk rating that might be something like, you should be 100% medium. So your investment portfolio should be 100% medium rated risk investments.
00:56:33.944 - 00:56:34.728, Speaker B: Okay.
00:56:34.856 - 00:56:41.884, Speaker A: Or it might be, you should be in 50% medium and 50% medium high.
00:56:42.784 - 00:56:43.336, Speaker D: Okay.
00:56:43.400 - 00:56:44.048, Speaker B: Okay.
00:56:44.176 - 00:57:07.954, Speaker A: And if we have. If we have one of these, this we would translate into something like. So a 50. If 100% medium is a three on the scale and a 50 50 medium medium high is prescribed, we would translate that to something like 3.25 on our. Hang on. Did I get that wrong? Let's go with 3.5.
00:57:07.954 - 00:57:13.350, Speaker A: Okay. 3.5 is the average of three and four, I think.
00:57:13.542 - 00:57:14.014, Speaker B: Right.
00:57:14.094 - 00:57:30.734, Speaker A: And that would translate into a 3.5 on this risk tolerance scale. Right. Okay. And so the. The dealer has these allocations that are sort of consistent with their product risk ratings about what they. Where they think the client should lie.
00:57:30.734 - 00:57:54.504, Speaker A: And these get translated, then, into a score from one to five on, on this particular scale. So if I. If we have somebody that's somebody that's 50 low medium and 50 high medium, for some reason, they would get a rating of three, which would be the same as somebody who's 100% medium risk from the questionnaire.
00:57:54.924 - 00:57:55.824, Speaker B: Okay.
00:57:56.684 - 00:58:17.904, Speaker A: And so this questionnaire puts people, or puts clients into sort of allocations across the risk ratings, which we then turn into risk tolerance, a single risk tolerance score. And those classifications and the risk ratings are going to correspond to the security risk ratings on the product shelf for the dealer.
00:58:21.174 - 00:58:21.990, Speaker D: Okay.
00:58:22.142 - 00:58:22.526, Speaker B: Okay.
00:58:22.550 - 00:58:31.434, Speaker A: So that's, that that accounts for some of the lumpiness in what you're seeing. That doesn't really account, though. For the fact that everybody's medium.
00:58:32.574 - 00:58:32.958, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:58:33.006 - 00:58:53.834, Speaker A: Right. And it also doesn't. I mean, there's nobody that's low risk and nobody that's super high risk. That's. I think, by this. That's actually by design with the. With the questionnaire, but, yeah, there's lots of bodies buried here.
00:58:55.814 - 00:59:02.190, Speaker D: Okay, well, let's see the time. 603. Maybe one more quick one, if you have a few minutes.
00:59:02.302 - 00:59:02.646, Speaker A: Sure.
00:59:02.710 - 00:59:30.864, Speaker D: I'm wondering. So were there. I'm trying to formulate the question. I want to ask a question about robo advising. How would Robo advising any of this, if at all? You know, this is something that's coming online these days. Right. And is because I would imagine that these sort of risk tolerance inference are being used in robo advisors to suggest to clients what they should trade.
00:59:30.864 - 00:59:38.108, Speaker D: I don't know if that. If Robo advising was any part of the subset of clients here or used it or not.
00:59:38.276 - 01:00:11.174, Speaker A: No. So this. These. This dealer doesn't do any robo advising. What they are, they're hoping that some of the work that we've done will help them with client advising. I think the term they're using is bionic advising. So they want to use some high level robos analytics along with, obviously, some personal experience and advisor expertise, in order to provide a better service to their clients.
01:00:11.174 - 01:00:25.304, Speaker A: So none of these investors are. None of these accounts are robo accounts. So I expect that some of the robo advisors are doing similar things, but I don't know.
01:00:26.644 - 01:00:36.812, Speaker D: Yeah, well, it doesn't bode well for the methodology to use this KYC and deciding on how the robo advisor should advise, that's for sure.
01:00:36.868 - 01:00:47.294, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. It's almost like they should have some sort of trading history in order to. To use the trading history in order to provide advice to the clients and.
01:00:50.474 - 01:00:51.654, Speaker D: Okay, cool.
01:00:52.434 - 01:00:52.906, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:52.970 - 01:00:54.522, Speaker D: Oh, sorry. Go ahead, finish this.
01:00:54.698 - 01:01:20.024, Speaker A: I was just going to say that the robo advisors have to follow the same KYC protocols as the in person advisors. Right. This is the same principles that they have to follow. The robo. The robos can't provide. Have to provide suitable advice to their clients, just like the in person advisors have to apply. You have to give suitable advice to their clients as well.
01:01:20.024 - 01:01:28.716, Speaker A: How they actually do the suitability test is up to them, but it has to pass the stiff test from the. From the regulators.
01:01:28.900 - 01:01:36.004, Speaker D: Right. Okay. Okay. Well, on that note, Mark, thank you kindly for very interesting talk.
