00:00:00.160 - 00:00:44.154, Speaker A: Good afternoon. Are there any. Are there any questions? But what is the main. What is the main point in the course? That's the question, I guess. Of course, I guess you're supposed to answer. You're supposed to answer some questions yourself, Justin. Are you, Justin, you have an idea what the course is about by now? I hope.
00:00:44.154 - 00:01:11.828, Speaker A: I mean, I hope. I hope everyone does, because it's really about just one thing. I would say. Okay, all right. And you know what the letter K stands for? It's supposed to stand, historically. Supposed to stand for? Well, I think it's class, the german word for class. And if you have.
00:01:11.828 - 00:01:53.942, Speaker A: So in other words, K class should be somehow redundant. The key class of an item, potent when I regenerate a productive module. Larry, and what would you, would you say the course is about? Well, if it's. If it's what? If it's one. If I'm saying it's just one thing, and somebody has already said just one thing, then I guess you don't have much choice, do you? Oh, well, okay. But you mentioned c star algebra, too. Yeah.
00:01:53.942 - 00:02:51.328, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, yeah. Well, my point of view is the case theory arose out of c star algebra, so that's also kind of redundant because it's also really almost the only game in town doing a few strokes, as we've seen for. At least for af algebra, for UHF algebra, UHF algebra, infinite tensor products of matrix algebra. And then, as I've been starting to talk about with Bradley's af algebras, the. The is all you need to at least to tell them apart. I went to a lecture this morning.
00:02:51.328 - 00:03:53.024, Speaker A: It's the fields metal symposium going on right now at the Fields institute, and it's about, it's in honor of particular field medalists, every year someone is chosen, some recent field medalist is chosen. Since they're roughly four. Every four years, that works out about even. So, the person is invited to. To attend and the meeting. And tonight there's a public opening that's taking place next door at the fields interview at 07:00 it's just across the street. It's across the patio, across the square.
00:03:53.024 - 00:05:02.588, Speaker A: There'll be a. There'll be some dignitaries talking about how important mathematics is, and then there'll be someone talking about how important the work of post shape of Berker is. Probably not pronouncing his name right, clearly not pronouncing his name right. And it's about classification. One of his main themes is the classification of algebraic variety. I think what this means, as I already understood from the lecture, I attended this morning is that what it means is you attach parameters not just to the construction of the objects in your category and what you're classifying, studying and classifying the UHF algebras were, there was a parameter, almost. It was a subset of the real line, right? It's a cantor set, parameterized the construction of UHF algebra.
00:05:02.588 - 00:06:16.122, Speaker A: So it turned out it also same, exactly the same parameter, also also parameterized the isomorphism clauses. Different supernatural numbers give you different algebras. But still, when we to prove this, we talked about categories and functions, right? To recapture I's version of Wim's proof in rest of mathematics, it seems that that people are able to define parameters for the isomorphism classes. And this is one of the main achievements. Whereas as soon as we pass to the free floating algebra of UHF algebra, then the parameter somehow dissolves, it disappears into thin air. It's no longer a nice topological space. It there are no open sets whatsoever.
00:06:16.122 - 00:07:20.304, Speaker A: If you look at the quotient space equivalence relation as such. Well, that's pretty, that's a good exercise to check what quotient topology is. If you look at the first of all, what the equivalence relation is, how much can you change the supernatural number in order that the associated UHF algebra, when you look at its free floating algebra, doesn't change? Some of us, anyway, have discussed the question of what happens if you multiply by two. And I think we agreed that if you take two by two, it means taking two by two matrices over your algebra. Well, if the algebra is any free floating algebra, taking finite matrices fixed to finite order of matrices is not going to change the algebra simply because of n is a finite number, one, two, three, so on. And you look at infinity, then n times infinity is equal to infinity. If you take account of first countable infinity, then you get exactly the same one.
00:07:20.304 - 00:08:08.074, Speaker A: That means that you multiply the number of rows and columns by two, you get the same number of rows and columns. So the. So that's an example of how you can change the supernatural number. What's a good exercise to find out exactly what the general equivalence relation is? And then if the supernatural numbers form a counter set, what is the quotient space? Every covalence relation on a topological space, you can pass to the equivalence classes and the quotient topology. What's the quotient? How many people know what the quotient is? Follows you, Charlie? Okay, good. Remind me of your name. Are you abu? Are you Abu? Okay, I'm sorry.
00:08:08.074 - 00:09:17.490, Speaker A: Thank you. So do you want to remind people what the quotient topology is. Okay, well that sounds exactly right. Yeah. And a surjective map from one space to the other, I guess that's from one set to another. That's almost talking about an equivalent solution, right? That could be another definition of an equivalent relation, right? Yeah. Okay, well, I think it's a good question, first of all to determine what the covenant relation is on the counter set of supernatural numbers, and then what the quotient space is if it's, and in particular.
00:09:17.490 - 00:11:05.366, Speaker A: Okay, so I've forgotten what it is, but I know it's pretty bad, so I'm going to guess, I'm going to guess, sort of casting back with my pretty faulty memory that you don't get any open sets at all. Okay, except for the empty set and the whole, and the whole set. Okay, but I'm happy to be corrected on that. But certainly it won't be house core, for instance. For sure it won't be what is generally thought of as a nice, well behaved, respectable topological space, which would be, which you would want to have for, when I call something the space of moduli, a parameter for the isomorphism classes, well, for general Af algebras, even if they're simple and unital, just like UHF algebra, the situation also is complicated, the only way to classify them, and it's a new version of classifiability, or you have, I'm just going to ignore someone, tell me if it gives them a headache. Okay, so if I do just ignore what's already on the board. Okay, but you have a big category which you want to classify, and then you want to classify it with a small, a smaller category, meaning it's simpler, fewer arrows.
00:11:05.366 - 00:12:36.254, Speaker A: Okay, okay, and then what's the classification function? Well, any function maps arrows into arrows, right? And we want that all the objects on the right should be at least isomorphic to objects that arise on the left. And also, okay, well, by the way, if you have a functor and you have an isomorphism upstairs, then for sure it's going to give you an isomorphism downstairs for sure. Okay, if the identity maps go to identity maps, that's what a functor does, and then if forwards and backwards is the identity map, then that will happen in the image too. Okay, but what we want to know is that if the images of two objects are isomorphic, then is there an isomorphism, is there an isomorphism upstairs? Okay, and that's, if there is, that's called a classification function, because the isomorphism classes are distinguished by the function. But the, these objects, you can't become. You can't compare them, they're just, the best you can do is say they're isomorphic because there'll be groups in general, and every sea straight algebra has a different the k group is abstract. The k zero group is an abstract ability in group.
00:12:36.254 - 00:13:03.194, Speaker A: Well, it's concrete. Starting from the algebra, you look at the idempotent, then you look at the equivalence classes, and that's abstract. That was abstract. And so it's apples and oranges. You can't say they're equal, but if you have a bag with twelve apples and twelve oranges, you can say they, they have a bijective correspondence. Isomorphic in a sense. You ignore the fact that apple and apple isn't exactly an orange.
00:13:03.194 - 00:13:44.822, Speaker A: Okay, well, if you have two groups, it makes sense to say they're isomorphic. And that's, and if it's a unital af algebra, then it makes sense to say the ISO, they're isomorphic in a way that determines the class of the unit. And that will be true if the algebra is isomorphic, because they're isomorphic. Of course the unit will coincide, the unit will correspond by the isomorphic. If they're unital, they have algebra. Let's consider the case of unital AFL groups. And by the way, we can't rely on the traces anymore to compute k zero.
00:13:44.822 - 00:14:57.494, Speaker A: In the case of the UHF algebra, you wanted to compute the concrete computation of the trace of the k zero group as they put together with the unit special element as a set of numbers. You just look at the normalized trace on the trace, on the algebra, the unique trace which is normalized on the unit, and you look at the traces of projection, and that will give you numbers in the interval zero one, and that's the intersection with the interval zero one of the k zero group. Optvice Marcus okay, so that's the, but that's so special for general unit o af algebra, even if it has a unique trace, even if there is a unique, there's always a trace. But stay simple. No closed two sided ideals, no non trivial closed two sided ideal. If it's simple and has unique trace, close unique trace, close unique trace, normalized, of course, on the unit. Well, the k zero functor is still with a special element, the class of the unit that's complete invariant.
00:14:57.494 - 00:16:05.744, Speaker A: Okay, that's what the, that's what my version of bratally's isomorphism theorem says. And by the way, I hope people are having fun proving that the category, interpreting diagrams as a category and showing that it's equivalent to the category of order groups that arise as the k groups from af algebra, the special element. Okay, so the unique trace is a, this is a red herring. You can't, it tells you nothing about k zero. Okay? It tells you something about k zero, but it doesn't nail it down because it gives you a functional and k zero. But this may not be injected, okay? May not be, maps the k zero into the real numbers, but the k zero may not be order isomorphic because we order positivity preserving mapping from the, from the k zero group into the real numbers. Any trace done.
00:16:05.744 - 00:16:53.804, Speaker A: But it, and for you, for UHF algebra, just happens that this is an isomorphism of groups order isomorphism, in fact, but in general, not a chance. Well, okay, but that means that you have to look at the, when I did it, I just talked about very phenomenal equivalents. And then when Larry Brown started to point out how important it was to interpret that as k zero, I said, well, that's fine. Although I didn't take his hint. His hint was, there's also k one. Okay? I was trying to lift projections. I was talking about this earlier.
00:16:53.804 - 00:17:59.534, Speaker A: I was trying to lift projections from the potion. And you realize that lifting projections is a bit, it's the first step. K zero classes from the quotient, okay, you have k zero maps the algebra onto the quotient, maps k zero of the algebra, k zero function. The quotient map, going from the algebra to the quotient, takes the k zero group of the algebra onto the k zero group of the quotient. And if you know that surjective, and that says that every k class lifts, okay, but that's almost the same as saying every projection lifts, which is exactly what I wanted. And Larry was, when he said, well, so there's also k one. When I said, so, so what? To his suggestion that I was working with k zero, well, what he was expecting me to pick up on was that k one of the ideal in this six term is that well known six term exact sequence.
00:17:59.534 - 00:19:03.874, Speaker A: K one of the ideal is zero, and which by exactness says that the k zero map into the k zero of the quotient is rejected because it means it's the kernel of the next map, which is zero, because the map into the zero group. So, so that I sort of missed out on that one. And Larry Brown finally had to sit down and write, write the paper. Okay. But that would be, that would be a sort of a piece of history that would be a good subject for an essay, I think. Well, okay, but the, so you look at the k zero function you get for two k zero algebras, for instance, unit, the ones. But in other words, it's not going to help with the unit.
00:19:03.874 - 00:19:57.874, Speaker A: The k zero is still just an abstract group. When you have unique trace, and we have two different af algebra, simple, with unit, even unique trace, you look at the k zero group with the special elements, they're going to be apples and oranges. You can't say they're equal, you can say they're isomorphic. And then that's what I was talking about last time. Well, recently I've been talking about the intertwining argument, which it was used by Bradley already in his Bradley diagram to prove isomorphism. The Bradley diagrams were equivalent, which in his sense meant it was an intertwining in the natural sense. And this could be traced back to isomorphism between the algebra.
00:19:57.874 - 00:21:01.954, Speaker A: Okay, so how do we, one thing I wanted to do was look a bit more at the triple squiggle proof. Okay? The first proof was you intertwine the k zero group. The first step, second step is to reach some k zero map between finite stages in the two sequences. For each k zero map, you find an algebra map that gives rise to it. But then these are just constructive, piecemeal. So the second diagram is not going to commute. It would be, it would be the, you could, if it happened to commute when you did it one day, then you could make a note that that was a good day.
00:21:01.954 - 00:22:01.710, Speaker A: Okay. Because it probably, probably going to be the last time it happened. All right. But then third picture is when you take the algebra maps and you make them, you modify each of them in such a way that doesn't it still ellipse the k zero map, change them by an inner automorphism. And because the unitary acting on projection takes one, takes minute, takes one production into an equivalent projection, right? So it acts as the identity on k zero. And that's what I wanted to do. I did, I started to say how you did it, but I got bogged down a bit because you're going to have to look at the actual definition of inductive limit.
00:22:01.710 - 00:23:09.790, Speaker A: Okay, so as I said before, these circuit diagrams, I could almost use them, right. You know, I had an uncle who was a physicist. Well, he, I have an uncle, historically. He died a few years ago. He came to Canada working as a postdoc for the atomic energy of Canada Limited. I lived in a town, people live, work there, and he was quite an experience to meet people like that. And one time, not that long ago, when I was moving back from Denmark, I had an electrical engineer in Denmark had modified my amplifier.
00:23:09.790 - 00:23:30.258, Speaker A: My Heathcote amplifiers were in Denmark. But after coming back, it didn't work here. And I had no idea how to. How to work on, how to. How to work it out, what to do. And I had. I thought I had lost the manual for constructing a very detailed manual.
00:23:30.258 - 00:23:52.144, Speaker A: So I asked my uncle if he would be. If he would take. If he would mind taking a look at it. He was very happy to do it, to look at it, and he just fixed it. Okay. Cold turkey. The, um.
00:23:52.144 - 00:24:16.304, Speaker A: I did. Quite a few years later, I found the manual for the. But, uh, it was, uh. No, I didn't mention it. I didn't mention it, and it was no longer necessary. In any case, I'm not sure that I could even have fixed it using the manual. Okay.
00:24:16.304 - 00:25:09.012, Speaker A: Okay, so we have the two sequences. Let's show several dots. Meaning it's a direct sum of the finite stages, are direct sums of various numbers of full matrix algebra. These three dots, I can never resist making this, making this funny, silly comment. These three dots should not be confused with these dots. And then we have the Vaughan Jones's black hole for the limit, and that's number one. And then we have number two.
00:25:09.012 - 00:25:59.188, Speaker A: Of course, it's completely different. Completely different. Bradley diagram. If finite stage maps are determined up to unitary equivalence, that's the uniqueness term that we need to show that once we have the k zero, once we have the k zero intertwining, and then we've lifted the k zero maps individually to algebra homomorphism. But having non commutative triangles, we can modify. The uniqueness term says you can modify the down up so that it's equal to the across after you put in an inner automorphism. But then the point is, that doesn't change the first map, the down map.
00:25:59.188 - 00:26:31.074, Speaker A: Only you can think of it by sociativity. It's just changing the up map. Okay, and so you've changed the up map, and first triangle is commutative. And then look at the second triangle and you have up with the new up map, then down, but it max the same way on k zero. Then you're down with the original choice of algebra math. And so you have the up. Down is gives you the same k zero is going across.
00:26:31.074 - 00:27:00.224, Speaker A: That's. Now that was commutative. And that's what I want to investigate. Now, why is the k zero lifting? Community? Why can you choose a community? But once you have uniqueness, up down is the same as across. Then you can modify the second down map by in the automorphism. And when you're finished, you have a completely stupid commutative algebra diagram. Okay.
00:27:00.224 - 00:27:36.814, Speaker A: And so it's a, it's a, it's. I wouldn't, I wouldn't. It's not even respectable to assign it as an exercise. If you have a commutative intertwined diagram like this in any category, and it gives you an isomorphism in the limit, maybe don't try to do it. It's just like you get to get a warning sometimes. Don't try this at home. Maybe don't try it for an arbitrary category at first.
00:27:36.814 - 00:28:27.954, Speaker A: Just look at finite dimensional, finite direct summons a finite dimension of matrix algebra, showing that mutative diagram involving two horizontal sequences gives you an isomorphism between the limits. Converges. Converges if you like, in a natural sense, algebraic sense. True for the sister algebra limits, too. But we're just looking at the algebra limits. Okay, so I draw this black hole, sort of a mirror image, to draw it differently. I guess you can't really tell what one of those shadings is clockwise and one is counterclockwise.
00:28:27.954 - 00:29:01.854, Speaker A: But that's sort of in a memorial gesture to the late Vaughan Jones to distinguish the knot on your left shoe from the knot on your right shoe. Okay, that's worse. That's worth looking into. I mean, at least in general terms. It's, what is the Jones? Not polynomial? Well, you don't need to do it with phone algebras. You can do it with matrix algebra. Find it with matrix algebra.
00:29:01.854 - 00:30:04.414, Speaker A: It's beyond Wikipedia once you know it exists. It's a challenge sometimes just to rediscover something. It's in the air now, but it's. This is controversial, perhaps open to debate, but some people might say it was the most important discovery, let's say mathematical discovery in the last century, and that you don't need fundamental algebra, you don't need operator algebras, even matrix algebra, to understand it, because Edward Whitten, have I mentioned that story? Yeah. Okay. But it's too good a story to not mention it again. So we have a knot.
00:30:04.414 - 00:30:30.944, Speaker A: A knot can be thought of as an embedding of s one into s three. Okay. S one being the circle and s three being three dimensional space. It's the. I think if you take three dimensional space and put a point at infinity, I think you get s three. Okay. All right.
00:30:30.944 - 00:31:52.944, Speaker A: So what Ed Witten said you should do is take a, take your favorite quantum field and just integrate it along the circle. Okay? And that's the Jones polynomial. Okay, roughly speaking. Okay, so what we assume that you have an isomorphism between the, this is the k groups, now with isomorphism between the algebra, but then this is an isomorphism, it gives you an isomorphism, bipunctoriality gives you isomorphism between the k zero groups. Let's say, taking the unit to the unit, let's look at the unit. Of course, if they're inverses, what the inverse is going to take one into the one going backwards. Okay.
00:31:52.944 - 00:32:48.544, Speaker A: Um, so what we want is to get the first step, the first weekly step. And we would like notice, um, that, uh, it's sort of, it's, it's, um, it's sort of assumed right off the bat that this first diagram is commutative. Okay? And that means it is, it shouldn't be too hard. The idea is it's not too hard to get it. The first step is to take some element here where you have generators, right? It's a free group with three free abelian groups, three generators, right? As a group goes. So you maybe assume it's just take the case where it's just singly generated. Then this, you look at where this goes to in the limit, okay? But then it comes to something down here.
00:32:48.544 - 00:33:29.188, Speaker A: And so, and then that something down here will certainly come from something at the finite stages. This is just the algebraic inductive limit. Okay, so what's the algebraic inductive limit? Bunch of building group. Well, it's not as, it's not injective maps. It's slightly, this is slightly subtle. Okay? If it were not injective maps, if it were injective maps, just increasing sets, then if you have something in the union, obviously it has to belong to one of the finite sets within the inductive limit with non inductive mass. And you can, sometimes you can never construct the decomposition if you order a group.
00:33:29.188 - 00:34:40.473, Speaker A: Sometimes you can never construct the decomposition that has injective map, finite direct sum of the copies of z at every state, even if you can get it without injecting maps. That was something that held me up for a while, for quite a year, I think, when I was trying to prove this theorem, my first pre print somehow said, well, we can assume the maps are injected. And a student of dixmage od male shell pointed out to me in the letter, that was not a justified, that was not justified. And so, she certainly knew of a counterexample she didn't mention, when I finally wrote the paper where I realized you didn't need injective math. I put a counterexample in to show you you needed a proof that didn't assume injective math. Okay? These are just math. The level of proof, which would take positive elements into positive elements and.
00:34:40.473 - 00:36:28.206, Speaker A: Okay, so this first positive generator, number one, the number one in the group says maps into something here and there's something down here. And so at some finite stage, if you look at the definition of the conductive limit of non injective maps, even for sets, everything does come from, if it's just sets without metric or anything purely algebraic and don't limit, and everything does come from the finite stage. Okay? You have to, it's a, it's a, every time you have a different category. Yeah. It's a good question whether in that category you have inductive limits and sequences, and that's defined in terms of a universal property. Okay? Universal property that says that this would be the inductive limit. If whenever you have finite stage maps into some other test object, created a diagram from the maps between the finite stage objects down to the, which arrows from the finite stage objects down to some other objects which give you commutative triangles all the time, then that should factor through the candidate for the limit, right? The universal property says there's a unique factorization, okay? And so you have, that's any category, okay? Now I use the term inductive limit.
00:36:28.206 - 00:37:14.714, Speaker A: There are other terms, and that's regardless of whether these maps are injected or not. Well, but it doesn't always exist. Okay? When it does exist, you have to construct it. And for billion groups or for sets, the same thing, same construction. You just look at sequences of elements, okay? So these are elements now, not the object, okay? You look at the sequence of elements. Of course that means a contiguous, contiguous element, first goes into the second, 2nd goes into the third, and so on. Infinite connected sequence of elements.
00:37:14.714 - 00:37:55.354, Speaker A: But it doesn't, of course, if it always started at the beginning, then it would be. You could only have so many, you only have as many elements as there were elements. You don't have as many connected sequences as there were elements starting at the beginning, okay? But in fact, you can start anywhere. You start anywhere. There's an element up here which doesn't come from here. So these maps, of course are not surjective any more than they're injected. And if you just look at the connected sequences, and then it's not a concrete construction, you look at equivalence classes, okay? Two connected sequences are equivalent.
00:37:55.354 - 00:38:15.350, Speaker A: If what? Well, there's a, there's a good. Homework question. Okay. If it doesn't pop out of my head right away, then by definition, it's an exercise. Okay. If you wanted to. If you wanted to see me work, then I.
00:38:15.350 - 00:38:33.852, Speaker A: Then I might. Someone. Well, I wouldn't welcome if six people put up hands and said, we require you to describe this construction. Well, I wouldn't know what to do. I have to go. I have to. But do people agree.
00:38:33.852 - 00:39:22.868, Speaker A: Do people agree to take this as a possible homework exercise or at least to think about? Okay, good. Because, you know, I've done it before. I can assure you I've done it before. And anything I've done before, I can almost hope to do again. All right, so that's the question is, how do you identify two contiguous sequences? But the point is, everything in the limit does come from some contiguous sequence. And so that's. You just look at this element, what it went into down here, and you pull it back to where the contiguous sequence.
00:39:22.868 - 00:39:35.464, Speaker A: Someplace where it was on the. Maybe where the contiguous sequence began. Not necessarily that. Just some place on the contiguous. Okay. Some element on the path. Particular path.
00:39:35.464 - 00:39:50.074, Speaker A: So, um. But then you just map this element directly down to there. And then it's a free group. The whole group maps. Okay. It's a group map. And that's.
00:39:50.074 - 00:40:09.630, Speaker A: And then you just proceed likewise. Suppose these are all just single z. Okay. It's the same idea. Okay. So then you get a map, except that this is not position number two. It's some finite position, okay? And then going up, you get, again, some finite position, some finite stage.
00:40:09.630 - 00:40:41.170, Speaker A: This maps up. And the question is, is this first triangle mutative? Well, the answer is no. You have to fix it up. Okay? And that means probably when you define the first map, allowing it to meet up with the second contiguous sequence farther out. Okay. Allowing. So the first map maybe should be like this.
00:40:41.170 - 00:41:17.152, Speaker A: And the next map going up maybe be like this meeting, the meeting, the upstairs sequence much farther out, where we map this one out to the one that's here. The generator here, or each generator, each three generator. You map it out to infinity and up. And you pull that back to some finite state. But we're now going to have to decide which finite state, okay? And it definitely won't be the first. Won't be the earliest possible one. So this.
00:41:17.152 - 00:41:34.944, Speaker A: At this stage, I think it makes sense to think of it as homework. But why don't I try to. Just to show it. I'm at least half awake. Let me try to see if I see what I can do in a minute. And a half. Okay.
00:41:34.944 - 00:42:08.424, Speaker A: In terms of modifying these arrows to go farther. To go farther out. So, in fact, we get a commuter to the triangle. Okay? All right. So medically, we have this. Okay, this is the wrong. This is the arrows between the groups.
00:42:08.424 - 00:42:32.114, Speaker A: These are the arrows between the group. Okay? Infinity, up and down. Infinity. Then we have these finite stage maps. And what do we know? How did we. What do we know about this diagram? Well, we know that if we look at. If we look at this map, we go up and across.
00:42:32.114 - 00:43:02.866, Speaker A: That's the same as going across and up. Okay? Right. That was how this map going up was chosen to be the same as. To be such that going up and across is the same as going across and up. All right? But then we just erase this for the time being. And this combined map is the same as going down and across and up. Okay? All right.
00:43:02.866 - 00:43:54.896, Speaker A: But now this one, down and across, down and across was the same as across and down. Right? So across and down and up is the same as across and down and up. But down and up is the identity. Okay? It's the same as across. So this combined map going down, up and across is exactly the same as going across to infinity, only to go to infinity. Okay, remember, this triangle is commutative if you compose it with this very, very long arrow going from this apex of the triangle, if you like, to infinity, except mutative. Well, we have these two maps, down, up and across, and they coincide after you go to infinity.
00:43:54.896 - 00:44:23.564, Speaker A: Well, that's true, for that means we have finitely many. We have the generator here, generators. And then those two maps, take those generators to here. And saying the two maps are equal is the same as saying they're equal on these generators. But they're not equal. They're not equal as it is. But if you go farther out than they are.
00:44:23.564 - 00:44:53.718, Speaker A: But that means that for any finite element, for any single element here, if you go to. If the two maps, if two. Or the image by the image, by the two elements, a single element here, it's imaged by the two maps. Down, across, and up and down, down and up. It'd be two maps, two elements here. And if they're the same at infinity, that means they're the same at some finite stage later. Okay.
00:44:53.718 - 00:45:24.332, Speaker A: I mean, there is some finite stage later where if you go down and up, across, and just go to that finite state, you get the same. Okay, but that means we can keep the first map. Now we can keep the down map. We just change the up map like this. And then there are communities that's how you get the first triangle community at the level of k zero. And just. I'm claiming it's an elementary exercise.
00:45:24.332 - 00:45:44.762, Speaker A: And inductive limit. Definition of inductive limit. Using the fact that these groups are free. Okay. Oh, now it's many generators. You have to decide whether it's going to be. Well, you want the maps to be positive, too.
00:45:44.762 - 00:46:04.530, Speaker A: I think that if we stick with. I think that's a throw to check later that you can make the maps. All the maps deserve positivity. Okay? Deserve. The order of. The main thing is to get them in the first place. Well, okay, that wasn't.
00:46:04.530 - 00:46:29.890, Speaker A: That was. That was more than a minute and a half. Okay, so that. That's. But that's more or less some. Well, there's the uniqueness theorem. But for maps between matrix algebra, if it's finite direct sums of matrix algebra, it's six.
00:46:29.890 - 00:47:24.674, Speaker A: It's six of one, half a dozen of the other. The important thing is just to check from two maps between Mn and Mn prime. And they're the same on k zero. Now, they're not necessarily. They're not necessarily unital maps, okay? Because if you have a finite direct sum of matrix algebra and you map it to a finite direct sum of matrix algebra, you can think of that as a whole lot of map between individual pairs of four matrix algebras. But these won't be unital. The units on the whole thing will go into the unit, and the whole thing in particular.
00:47:24.674 - 00:48:17.834, Speaker A: It will be the direct sum of a whole lot of things at each stage. But then the individual finite, the individual direct summons of the remains stage will be. The units will be the sum of a whole lot of things, orthogonal things. And so, inside each matrix algebra, at the second stage, the image of each of the individual units will be just some projection, some items. Is that. Is it clear? Okay, so we just look at homomorphism. So not uniform.
00:48:17.834 - 00:49:29.504, Speaker A: The point is that if they're the same on k zero, then what, Abigail? What's the two maps which are the same on k zero? K zero is z. So that means they're modifying the zmap is multiplying by some number, right? And call that the multiplicity of the map of the embedding. And so two maps have the same modelicity. What can you say? Particularly if they're unital? Two unital maps, they would have the same model, okay? Because that would be just. This is one by one, and this is n prime by n prime, then one would go into n prime, right? That's the map. Of the levels that we're modifying by n prime. And if it's a unit of map between two matrix algebra, what can you say about it if it's two unit of maps? Well, first of all.
00:49:29.504 - 00:49:50.336, Speaker A: Well, okay, in this case, we have n. Then if it's. Actually, Professor Helmont said you should always look at a trivial special case first. Okay. Well, he just said easier. For every problem, there's an easier one. He didn't mean necessarily trivial, but maybe it doesn't hurt.
00:49:50.336 - 00:50:12.090, Speaker A: You can sort of warm up slowly, I guess, the case of m one into m two, and look at unital maps. Okay, then. How many of those are there? Well, actually, I guess there's only. Abigail. You put up one finger. That was your answer. That wasn't just putting up your hand, right? Okay.
00:50:12.090 - 00:50:20.514, Speaker A: Yeah. Right. Good. There's only one actual map. But suppose it's two by two going into. Well, three by three. There won't be any.
00:50:20.514 - 00:50:43.984, Speaker A: Okay. But four by four it will be. But how many? Well, you have one. If you have one mapped from m two into m four. And of course you do, because you can write m four as two by. We were discussing what happens when you take two by two matrices over something. Notice that m four is the same as m two over m two.
00:50:43.984 - 00:51:32.228, Speaker A: M two by two matrices over m two. Okay, so if the m two maps into m four by putting a box down the diagonal, identical box down the diagonal, there's an example of a map from m two into m four unit on that course, too. K zero. The minimum projection here, one dimensional production here, will go into two dimensional production here with multiplying by two. And so here, one goes to two two times one. So. Okay, but that's.
00:51:32.228 - 00:51:55.920, Speaker A: I'm not. I'm not going to. I don't have time to say what the answer is, okay? That's homework. If I have another. Another map from m two into m four, that takes the unit into the units, then is it equal? Must it be equal to the first one, or. Obviously not. Okay.
00:51:55.920 - 00:52:24.244, Speaker A: I wouldn't be asking the question. Well, you have to be careful. Okay. But anyway, let's leave it at that. Any. Any questions? I hope everyone is trying to get into the tutorial room on Friday at 02:00. 03:00.
00:52:24.244 - 00:52:47.664, Speaker A: In a pinch, I think that whole 20 people, it used to be undergraduates, were competitive. How many could get into a Volkswagen or a telephone booth? But now there are no more Volkswagen Beatles and no more telephone booths. It's a challenge to find. A challenge. Okay, I'm sorry to be silly.
