00:00:00.600 - 00:00:22.045, Speaker A: So let's get back to it in 12 days. Hopefully you haven't forgotten everything. I will remind you where we were. We were talking about Jacobi fields. I'll remind you what the definition is in a second. We're going to continue talking about Jacobi fields for the first half an hour today. And then originally my plan was to move on to chapter six about isometric immersions.
00:00:22.045 - 00:01:00.157, Speaker A: But that's sort of much more standard Riemannian geometry that you often see in introductory courses. And it's really easy to follow and I don't need it again in the book until half of chapter 10. So what I'm going to do is skip chapter six and move on to chapter seven on completeness, Hoff Rhino Theorem, Cartan Hadamard Theorem, and then depending on how far we get, if we get to the second half of chapter 10, I might decide to go back to chapter six or we might do other interesting things and not talk about isometric emergence. So that's the plan. I'm also about halfway through grading assignment one. You'll get it back before you hand in assignment two. You'll probably get it back by Friday, I think.
00:01:00.157 - 00:01:34.765, Speaker A: Assignment 2 is due a week from tomorrow, if I'm correct. Something like that. And you can do most of it already and you'll be able to do the rest of it after I finish the Jacobi field stuff. So recall, this is how we define Jacobi field. If we have a geodesic on M, we always have a fixed Riemannian metric on our manifold. We have a geodesic, then a Jacobi field along this geodesic, so this is fixed data, is a vector field along this geodesic such that it satisfies this equation, this Jacobi equation. This is the second covariant derivative along gamma.
00:01:34.765 - 00:02:10.385, Speaker A: So that's the Jacobi equation. And we saw that this is a second order linear ode. So for a second order linear ode, as long as you prescribe the initial value and the initial derivative, there exists a unique solution. So this is. This space of solutions is parameterized by j of 0 and j prime of 0. So if you specify j at time 0 and the first covariant derivative along the curve of JJ at time zero, then there's a unique solution. And this, this is a, this is a vector space, right? Because it's a linear equation.
00:02:10.385 - 00:02:40.367, Speaker A: Any linear combination of solutions is a solution. And we saw that there exists sort of two simple ones. The tangential solutions are J equals gamma prime. This is always a Jacobi field. And J is T gamma prime. This is also a Jacobi field. And then so these are somehow less interesting.
00:02:40.367 - 00:03:39.987, Speaker A: So the solutions such that J is orthogonal to gamma prime for all T are called normal Jacobi fields. Normal Jacobi fields, and these are the ones we're really interested in. And this is a two n minus two dimensional space. And this corresponds to taking j of zero and j prime of zero orthogonal to gamma prime of zero. Okay? In fact, I'll review some of this near the end of this section. But what we did before the break was to understand that Jacobi fields tell you something, because you see the curvature shows up in the equation. They tell you they're used to understand how curvature affects the spreading of geodesics.
00:03:39.987 - 00:05:51.793, Speaker A: And so we saw that in some sense, some which we made precise before the break, but I'm not going to repeat it, that if the curvature was positive at a point, the sectional curvature, then geodesics that are initially tangent to that two plane tend to not spread out as much as they do in flat space. And if the sectional curvature is negative on some two plane, then geodesics that are initially tangent to that two plane tend to spread out more than they do in flat space. Okay, but the next thing we're going to do is to see another interpretation of Jacobian Jacobi fields, what another thing they're good for, and that is to identify where the exponential map becomes singular. Okay? So the next is the relationship between Jacobi fields and singularities of the exponential map. Okay? So recall that XP is defined on some open set in tpm, which is, which is star shaped with respect to the origin, star shaped with respect to the origin, and it maps into M and it's smooth, okay? And therefore the push forward, if V is a point in capital V, then the push forward at V will go from TV of tpm, which is canonically tpm, to T XP of V of M. And this is linear, okay? And we know that When V is 0, this is the identity map. When V equals 0 XP, star at 0 is the identity on TPM.
00:05:51.793 - 00:07:14.435, Speaker A: Because if I apply XP to 0, I get, I get P. So for V close to zero, xp, star V is an isomorphism, okay? Because everything is smooth. So this Jacobian matrix, if you write in coordinates, the entries are the first partial derivatives and they're continuous, right? So if the determinant is 1 at P, then at 0, then at close to 0, the determinant will be close to 1, so it'll be non 0, so it will be invertible. But even Though this guy is defined on all of V, we don't know that this guy is invertible everywhere on capital V. So there can exist V in V where x p star of V fails to be invertible to be an isomorphism. And because this is going from n dimensions to n dimensions, that's exactly saying there's something non trivial in the kernel. That is when the kernel is non trivial.
00:07:14.435 - 00:07:40.805, Speaker A: Okay. Such a V is called the critical point of xp. So it has to be in the domain of xp, obviously, but it's a point where the push forward has a kernel, has a non trivial kernel. Okay, so now with that. Yeah. Yes. I have a question.
00:07:40.805 - 00:08:09.053, Speaker A: It's just about the definition of the domain of xp. So this is, if I recall correctly, we defined the domain of the just general exponential as huge open set in TM and then we intersected with tpm. That's right. So these are just, if I recall correctly, these are just all the vectors whose geodesic with initial point P and velocity V. Yeah. Can flow for time one. Right? That's right.
00:08:09.053 - 00:08:58.215, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Just making sure, because we've done so the question was what, what is, what is this domain? This is the, is the domain of the exponential map intersect tpm. Okay, so it's all those vectors such that if you look at the init at the geodesic with initial point P and initial vector V, it's defined at least for time one. Okay, so now I can state the next result which will follow immediately from the definitions essentially. Oh, I need a definition first. Definition.
00:08:58.215 - 00:11:26.245, Speaker A: Let gamma be a geodesic. Strictly speaking, this is a geodesic segment because I've restricted the domain to some closed bounded interval. And for T naught, something which is bigger than zero but less than or equal to a, the point gamma of T naught in M is called a conjugate point. 2 gamma of zero along gamma if and only if there exists a non zero Jacobi field along gamma with j of zero equals zero and j of t naught equals zero. Okay? So to be a conjugate point, you can't just say is this point a conjugate point? You have to fix a geodesic and then with respect to that geodesic, a point on the image of the geodesic will be conjugate to the initial point of the geodesic if and only if There's a non 0 Jacobi field which vanishes at these two times time 0 and time t 0 and the maximum number of linearly independent of such linearly independent Jacobi fields is called the multiplicity of the conjugate point. Multiplicity of the conjugate point. It's easy to see, because the Jacobi equation is linear, that if I have two Jacobi Fields which vanish at time 0 and time t naught, then their linear combination, any linear combination of them, will be a Jacobi field which vanishes at zero and T naught, right? So that's a linear subspace of the space of Jacobi fields.
00:11:26.245 - 00:12:38.455, Speaker A: So that's the definition. We're going to see in a minute what this has to do with the discussion over there. But let me make two remarks and give an example of conjugate points before we come to this result. So, remarks. If gamma of T0 is conjugate to gamma of 0 along gamma, I'm not going to keep writing that there's only one geodesic in the problem. Then gamma of zero is conjugate to gamma T0 along gamma inverse restricted to zero T0. Okay? This goes from zero T0 to.
00:12:38.455 - 00:13:57.095, Speaker A: To M. So the picture that this is gamma, here's gamma of zero, there's gamma of A. So if I have some time T naught, which is bigger than 0 but less than or equal to A, where gamma T0 is a conjugate point, that means there exists a Jacobi field which vanishes at zero and at gamma of T naught at gamma of zero and gamma of t zero. And we don't know what it does after that. We don't care what it does after that. And you can see that if I look at J inverse of T, which is j of A minus T, this is a Jacobi field along gamma inverse of T, which is gamma of A minus T on zero A, you can just check that. And that's because of the linearity of the Jacobi equation and the chain rule.
00:13:57.095 - 00:14:36.675, Speaker A: And therefore. And this guy J inverse, if you restrict it now, if you restrict this curve to just going from here to here, then this gives you a Jacobi field which vanishes at this initial point of gamma inverse. What have I done here? If I put Gamma Inverse at 0. This is wrong. T naught. What am I doing? I didn't want to write this down at all. So gamma inverse at T naught is.
00:14:36.675 - 00:15:03.955, Speaker A: This is wrong. You can figure out what it has to be. I'll mess it up if I try to solve it now. So given a. If you have a geodesic and you have a point which is conjugate to the initial point of the geodesic, you can follow that geodesic in the opposite direction. And so the initial point of your original geodesic is now conjugate to the final point along the opposite geodesic. That was one remark.
00:15:03.955 - 00:15:53.011, Speaker A: Another remark, remark 2. Let n be the dimension of M. Recall that J, which is gamma prime and J equals T. Gamma prime are two Jacobi fields along gamma. These are the sort of uninteresting ones. The first never vanishes because gamma prime has constant length. We're looking only at non constant geodesics.
00:15:53.011 - 00:16:27.893, Speaker A: Right? So this one never vanishes and the second only vanishes at T equals zero. But this vector only vanishes at t equal to zero. I'll get your question in a second, Amanda. So hence the multiplicity of a conjugate point is less than or equal to n minus one. Okay. Because we know that the geodesics. We want to have a geodesic which vanishes at time zero.
00:16:27.893 - 00:16:50.725, Speaker A: And we know that the space of these. We're fixing the initial value, we're just not fixing the initial velocity. That's N dimensional. And we know there's already one in there which will never vanish after time zero. So that takes away one of them. So there's at most n minus one dimensional space of Jacobi fields which vanish at zero and at some T naught. Okay, but in practice it'll be less.
00:16:50.725 - 00:17:24.695, Speaker A: In practice it's less. The multiplicity will be less. Yes, question. Yeah, no, I didn't have to draw it like this. Besides, it's not just two dimensional, right? It could be, yeah. The space orthogonal to gamma prime is n minus one dimensional. And my picture looks.
00:17:24.695 - 00:17:53.225, Speaker A: Comment? The question. Sorry, the question was it looks like this. The, this Jacobi field which gives you a conjugate point which determines a conjugate point switches direction. But that's, it's an artifact of the fact that my blackboard is two dimensional. It's just. It's zero at gamma of gamma zero and zero at gamma of t zero. And it actually could be zero at other points as well.
00:17:53.225 - 00:18:07.385, Speaker A: Right. In this picture. I didn't, I didn't exclude that from the definition. And we're just saying It's a non zero Jacobi field. That means it's not identically zero and it vanishes a gamma of zero and a gamma of T0. It's the only conditions. Okay, just comment.
00:18:07.385 - 00:18:28.205, Speaker A: Yeah, I think on that board J inverse should be J of T, not minus T. So wherever you have an A, put a T naught. Yeah, that's better. I knew there was a. I Knew there was a problem. Yeah, so this is really. Thank you.
00:18:28.205 - 00:19:07.015, Speaker A: This is really. When I write gamma inverse, I take gamma restricted to zero T naught and I take the inverse of that curve. That's better. Okay. Okay, so let's do an example of conjugate points. Take SN with the round metric. Okay, so as I told you when we talked about curvature, this has constant sectional curvature plus one.
00:19:07.015 - 00:19:46.455, Speaker A: This is the unit sphere, right radius one. We didn't actually do that calculation. I told you, you can do that calculation. And we know from the assignment that the geodesics are great circles. Okay, so let's draw a picture and investigate the conjugate points. I'm going to look at geodesic, which is a meridian starting from the North Pole. So there's my picture of sn.
00:19:46.455 - 00:21:08.515, Speaker A: Let's look at a geodesic like this. It goes, goes in the back after and it closes up again. So this will be gamma of zero. So we saw when we talked about Jacobi fields, we proved that if you have constant sectional curvature and you only look for the Jacobi fields which vanish at the initial point, then we wrote down an explicit formula for the Jacobi field. So the normal. And we only care about normal because in this first remark we know that the ones that are not normal, that are tangential, will never give us conjugate points, right? Because they'll never vanish at a second point. The normal Jacobi fields J such that j of 0 equals 0 are given by J of T is sine of t W of T, where W of T is parallel along gamma and orthogonal to gamma prime.
00:21:08.515 - 00:21:33.851, Speaker A: Right? We had, we wrote down explicitly what the Jacobi equation is when you have constant sectional curvature. And we were able to solve it explicitly. And we had, you know, there was values of K here. It was like sine something over root k, but K is 1. So if I draw a picture of that, let's use blue. So I'm taking this is. This is gamma prime of zero, the initial velocity.
00:21:33.851 - 00:22:45.628, Speaker A: So I need a vector W which is orthogonal, let's say a non zero vector which is orthogonal to gamma prime of zero. Then I can parallel transport this vector W all along this geodesic W of T. I get a parallel vector field along this geodesic and the Jacobi field which vanishes and what? And a Jacobi field which vanishes at time 0 is given by multiplying this vector field by sine of T. So another color green. So sine of zero is zero. This is gamma of PI down here, right? Gamma PI sine of T vanishes at 0 and PI, so this bad starts decreasing again. You see this? This vector field will Vanish only at time 0 and time PI.
00:22:45.628 - 00:23:56.775, Speaker A: When it gets to time 2 PI, it's back to the same point again. So hence gamma of PI, which is the antipodal point to gamma of 0 is a conjugate point is conjugate to gamma of 0 along gamma. And the multiplicity in this case is exactly n minus 1, which is the most that it could be by that remark that we had a little earlier. And that's because there are exactly n minus one dimensional space of vectors orthogonal to gamma prime of zero, right? This orange vector, there's n minus one dimensional space of choices for that. And then I can do this and these will all be linearly independent. Okay, so this is, this is not typical. As I said in the remark, we know that a given conjugate point can have multiplicity at most n minus 1, but in general it won't be n minus 1.
00:23:56.775 - 00:25:10.305, Speaker A: Okay, let me make one more definition and then we'll prove the the last main result of this chapter. Okay, so definition. Let P be a point in M, the set of first conjugate points. I'll explain this in a second. First conjugate points to P. For all geodesics that started P is called the conjugate locus of P and it's denoted C of P. Okay, Just some set which could be empty.
00:25:10.305 - 00:26:16.835, Speaker A: Could be empty. So you take the point P, you look at all geodesics that start from P and you say, if I follow these geodesics, does there exist a conjugate point along there? In other words, is there some, some positive time after the initial time where there exists a non zero Jacobi field along that geodesic that vanished at the initial and that and that point? And when I say first conjugate points, remember the question that Amanda asked. I erased the picture. Now, that blue non zero Jacobi field, I had it vanishing at gamma of zero and a gamma of T naught. It could have vanished at some earlier point, right? And if that was true, then gamma of T0 would not be the first conjugate point along that, along that geodesic, right? You look for the first point, the first positive time after t 0, after, sorry, after 0, where there exists a non 0 Jacobi field that vanishes at gamma of 0 and gamma of that time. And that, that's going to be the first conjugate point. So in the example that we did on the, on the left hand side with the sphere.
00:26:16.835 - 00:27:06.985, Speaker A: So for this, for the round sphere, C of P is equal to minus P. This is the it consists of just one point. And again, this is not typical. So not only is it not necessary that every conjugate point has multiplicity n minus 1, it's also not true that the conjugate locus has to be one point. This is happening because the sphere has a lot of symmetry. Okay, so all the directions, all the geodesics coming out of one point, their first conjugate point is the antipodal points. The same for all of them.
00:27:06.985 - 00:27:36.235, Speaker A: And we'll see examples today where there's no conjugate. Maybe not today we will see it. We'll see examples where the conjugate locus is empty. There's no conjugate points. Okay, so here's the theorem. I don't know if it deserves to be called a theorem. It's proposition in my notes, but I upgraded it.
00:27:36.235 - 00:28:45.825, Speaker A: Let Gamma be a geodesic. Let P be the initial point. Then the point Q which is gamma of t naught for t0 strictly bigger than 0 and less than or equal to A is conjugate to P along gamma if and only if v0, which is t times t naught times gamma prime zero. This is in TPM is a critical point of XP. Okay, so I e x p star at t0. Gamma prime of zero is singular, not invertible. It has a non trivial kernel.
00:28:45.825 - 00:30:47.765, Speaker A: Okay, so in other words, the points where the exponential map fails to be a local diffeomorphism by the inverse function theorem are exactly conjugate points to geodesics emanating at P. So moreover, before we prove it, moreover, the multiplicity of Q as a conjugate point equals the dimension of the kernel of x p star T naught gamma prime zero. So these are the best kinds of proofs where they basically prove themselves from all the definitions. Let's just write out what we want to show. So Q is conjugate to P along gamma if and only if there exists a non zero Jacobi field J along gamma with J of zero equals zero and J of T naught equals zero. That's just the definition of conjugate point. Let's let V be Gamma prime of T0 just to simplify things, and let W be J prime at time 0, the initial covariant derivative of this Jacobi field.
00:30:47.765 - 00:31:36.555, Speaker A: So we proved earlier that J of T is X P star at TV applied to TW for all T in zero A. So what am I doing here? We had a formula that said if you had a Jacobi field whose initial value was 0, this is just for the Jacobi fields which vanish at time zero, and you know what j prime zero is, then you actually know what j is. We know that. We know that the initial value and initial derivative determine J. And it was given by this when I wrote it down before the break. This V was Gamma prime of 0 and this W was J prime of 0. That's the same formula.
00:31:36.555 - 00:34:19.303, Speaker A: Okay, so we see that j is non 0 if and only if w is non 0 by uniqueness of the Ode theorem, right? So if W was zero, if the initial velocity was also zero, we know the solution is zero. And you can see it here, right? And so if this is not zero, then the solution is not the zero solution. So this, this J is not identically zero. So hence Q is conjugate to P along gamma if and only if J of t naught is 0 and that's equal to x p star t 0 v of t 0, w for some w not equal to 0, which is equivalent to t 0, v is a critical point of x, right? Because t 0 is positive. So this gives us something non 0 in the kernel if and only if if W is not zero. So that that proves the first part and the multiplicity of Q as a conjugate point equals the number of linearly independent Jacobi fields J that vanish at 0 and t naught. But if, but j1 up to jk are linearly independent if and only if j1 prime at 0 up to jk prime at 0 are linearly independent, again by the Ode theorem.
00:34:19.303 - 00:35:23.945, Speaker A: So these are all Jacobi fields that vanish at zero. If they all vanish at zero, then their independence is measured by the independence of their initial covariant derivatives. And so the multiplicity of Q is equal to the dimension of the kernel of x p star at T0V. Because what do we want to know? We want to know what's the space of solutions, the space of W's which satisfy this, right? That's exactly the initial the. Yeah, you can see from here the kernel of this guy is exactly measuring the vanishing of J at T naught. Yep, it is, because this is a linear ode, right? And we said the. If there's a linear combination of these guys which is zero, then if you take.
00:35:23.945 - 00:35:52.315, Speaker A: Let's say there's an A1J1 prime of zero up to a K prime of zero is zero. And if you look at the Jacobi field A1J1 plus up to AKJK that will vanish at zero and its initial velocity will be zero at zero. Therefore, by uniqueness of the Ode theorem, this will be zero everywhere. It's the same thing. Yeah, the same thing. Okay. All right.
00:35:52.315 - 00:37:21.545, Speaker A: So that's the main, the final main result of the chapter on Jacobi fields. But we do have some bookkeeping to do it now. We're going to collect some very simple results about Jacobi fields properties which are going to be used later in the term. So some more properties of Jacobi fields, and the first one I've already done two lectures ago when we defined Jacobi fields, but it's worth doing again, especially because the next two properties are immediate corollaries of this one. Okay, so first proposition. Let J be a Jacobi field along a geodesic gamma. Then the inner product of j of T with gamma prime of T is equal to the inner product of j of 0 with gamma prime of 0 plus t times the inner product of j prime of 0 with gamma prime of 0.
00:37:21.545 - 00:37:49.607, Speaker A: Okay, as I said, we already did this. I may have not phrased it exactly in this way. I think I did actually, but let's just do it again. So, first of all, J gamma prime. If I look at this function, this is a. We know the Jacobi field is smooth and we know gamma, it's a geodesic. So the velocity is smooth.
00:37:49.607 - 00:38:26.409, Speaker A: So this is a smooth function of T. If I covariantly differentiate this function along T, take D by dt of it, then that's going to be J prime gamma prime. Because there's going to be another term which is J gamma double prime, but it's a geodesic, right? So gamma double prime is zero. And then if I do it again, I have to differentiate this with respect to time. And again, because gamma double prime is zero, I get this. And then by the Jacobi equation, this is going to be minus RJ gamma prime. Sorry.
00:38:26.409 - 00:38:56.531, Speaker A: Yeah. Gamma prime, gamma prime. And this is zero by the symmetries of the Riemann curvature tensor. Right, I have. The last two arguments are the same. So this function has second derivative equal to zero. So this function J of t gamma prime of T has to be some constant plus some constant times t.
00:38:56.531 - 00:39:54.870, Speaker A: And you can see that c0 is j of 0, gamma prime of 0 and c1 is the first derivative of this function at time 0, which is j prime of 0, gamma prime of 0. Okay, so why did I redo this? Because we have two surprising corollaries of this, which are the following. Could you ask the cameraman to move the frame. Can we move the. Like you're out of frame. Okay, sorry about that. Okay, so the first corollary, if J of If J inner product gamma prime at some time t1 is.
00:39:54.870 - 00:40:43.955, Speaker A: Is equal to j gamma prime at some time t2 for some t1 not equal to t2 in 0a, then j inner product gamma prime is independent of T. And in particular, if j at 0 and j at A are both 0, then j gamma prime is 0 for all t. So why is this? I'm not going to even write it down. It's immediate. Let's look at. Actually, maybe I'll write it down. So, proof.
00:40:43.955 - 00:41:34.115, Speaker A: We have j Gamma prime at T1 is equal to J Gamma prime at T2. And this is equal to C0 plus C1 T1, and this is C0 plus C2 T2. But T1 is not equal to T2. Right? The only way this can happen, Sorry, is that C1 is zero, and that implies that j gamma prime of T is C naught is independent of T. And we know what C naught is. It's J naught, gamma prime, naught. So if the initial value.
00:41:34.115 - 00:42:13.743, Speaker A: Sorry, what did I write down here? That's right. So. So if. If J at time 0 and J at time A is 0, then certainly this is going to hold when I put t1 is 0 and t2 is a. Right, because j at t1 is going to be 0 and j at t2 is going to be 0. So this will hold if. Sorry, if this holds, then the hypothesis holds, and therefore this holds for all T.
00:42:13.743 - 00:43:44.227, Speaker A: But this is zero. Okay, so what we've seen is that if we have a Jacobi field which vanishes at the two endpoints of the geodesic, then it's orthogonal to the velocity for all time. Let me write it over here. So If j of 0 equals j of a equals 0, then JT inner product gamma prime t is 0 for all t. Okay? And another corollary of this proposition, corollary 2. Suppose j of 0 equals 0, then j prime 0, gamma prime 0 is 0 if and only if J prime of t gamma prime of t is 0 for all t. Certainly, if J prime of T is orthogonal to gamma prime of T for all T, then this will hold at time zero.
00:43:44.227 - 00:44:05.565, Speaker A: But we're saying that as long as it holds at time zero, it's going to hold everywhere. And it follows from here. Right? Because if it holds a time zero, then this second term in the. In the expression. What did I write? Down. Sorry, this is. Sorry, sorry.
00:44:05.565 - 00:44:28.459, Speaker A: This should be a J. Right. If the initial. So we're looking only at Jacobi fields which vanish at time zero. If the initial velocity was orthogonal, if the initial covariant derivative of J was orthogonal to the initial velocity of the geodesic, then the Jacobi field is orthogonal to the. To the. To the velocity of the geodesic everywhere.
00:44:28.459 - 00:44:56.595, Speaker A: Okay? And it follows from here because if j prime of 0 dot gamma prime of 0 is 0, this term goes away and j of 0 is 0. So this is immediate. But the punchline of this guy is that if we only care about the normal Jacobi fields, the one. This is. This is repeating what I said earlier. The Jacobi fields which are everywhere orthogonal to gamma prime are exactly the ones. Sorry.
00:44:56.595 - 00:46:25.435, Speaker A: The Jacobi fields with initial value 0 which are everywhere orthogonal to gamma prime are exactly those whose initial covariant derivative is also orthogonal to the initial gamma prime. Okay, all right. One more result. Well, one more proposition and one more corollary. And we're done with Jacobi fields for the time being. So that gamma be a geodesic, let V1 be a tangent vector at the initial point of the geodesic and V2 be a tangent vector at the final point of the geodesic. Then if Gamma of A is not conjugate to gamma of 0 along gamma, then there exists a unique Jacobi field J along gamma with j of 0 is v1 and j of a is v2.
00:46:25.435 - 00:47:42.303, Speaker A: So if you go back to your background on odes, the ode theorem says that if you give initial conditions, there's always a solution. The initial value of J and the initial derivative of J, then there's going to be a unique solution. Here we're asking the boundary value problem. We're saying if we want to expressify not the initial value and the initial derivative, but the initial value and the value at some other point, can we find a Jacobi field which has this value v1 at time 0 and this value v2 at time 8? And we're saying that if Gamma is not conjugate to Gamma of zero, then there exists a unique one with this property. So let's see how that works. So let script J be the space of Jacobi fields along gamma with initial value zero. I guess I want.
00:47:42.303 - 00:48:40.675, Speaker A: Okay, so this is A is an N dimensional vector space. I'm not excluding the. The tangential one. Okay. And let's define a map capital F from this space to the tangent space at gamma of A of M by F of J is just evaluation at a evaluation map. Okay, so this is a linear map, a linear map between n dimensional vector spaces, right? If I evaluate J1 plus J2 at A, I get J1 at A plus J2 at A. Similarly for a multiple.
00:48:40.675 - 00:49:36.425, Speaker A: So since gamma of A is not conjugate to gamma of 0 along gamma, F is injective, hence an isomorphism, right? What, what does that mean? So this is a linear map between 2N dimensional vector spaces. So? So to know it's injective, I need to know the kernel is zero. Well, suppose I have something in the kernel that means j of a vanishes, right? J of 0 vanishes and j of a vanishes. So if there was some non0j which HAP which does this, then gamma of A would be conjugate to gamma of zero. But my hypothesis is gamma of A is not conjugate to gamma zero. So the only j's that are in the kernel is the zero j. So it's injective, hence an isomorphism.
00:49:36.425 - 00:50:20.943, Speaker A: So there exists some J1 hat in J such that J1 hat of A is V1. Because it's an isomorphism, that means it's on 2. So V1 is in V2. Sorry, V2. And now we do the same thing in the opposite direction. So gamma of zero is not conjugate to gamma of a along gamma inverse. Because if it was, then gamma of A would be conjugate to gamma of zero along gamma inverse.
00:50:20.943 - 00:51:40.635, Speaker A: So by the same argument, there exists a Jacobi field along gamma with j at A is 0. Let's call it Jacobi field. J2 hat along gamma with J2 hat at A is 0 and J2 hat at 0 is V1. So this guy has J1 hat at 0 is 0. Okay? So then J which is J1 hat plus J2 hat is a Jacobi field along gamma with J at 0 is V1 and J at A is V2 and the uniqueness is clear, right? Because if there was two of these, then their difference would be a Jacobi field which vanished at the two endpoints. But that would mean the points were conjugate, but they're not. Uniqueness is clear.
00:51:40.635 - 00:52:04.435, Speaker A: And I'll just say it again. You suppose you have two such Js. Look at their difference. It's a Jacobi field long gamma. It vanishes at 0 net A. Because those points are not conjugate, the difference has to be zero. Okay, last corollary of the section.
00:52:04.435 - 00:54:13.265, Speaker A: Let gamma be a geodesic. Let script j perp Be the space of Jacobi fields along gamma with a of 0 equals 0 and j prime of 0 orthogonal to gamma prime 0. So in particular by corollary 2, j of t is orthogonal to Gamma prime of T for all T. This is still the hypothesis. So we're looking at those Jacobi fields which are everywhere, which have initial value 0 and which are normal Jacobi fields. Let j1 up to jn minus 1 be a basis of j perp, because we know that this is n minus 1 dimensional. Then if gamma of T is not conjugate to gamma of 0 for all t in 0 up to a, then j 1 of t up to j of T is a basis for the orthogonal complement of gamma prime of T in TPM T gamma T of N.
00:54:13.265 - 00:55:14.477, Speaker A: Okay, so this guy is in here, all the Jacobi fields, all these guys, their values at time t are orthogonal to gamma prime of T. So at time T, these are certainly vectors in here. We're saying if they're. If there are basis for this space, then every time T their basis for the orthogonal complement of the velocity of the geodesic in the tangent space at that point. And this proof is exactly like the previous one. Let's define F from J perp to T Gamma T of M, which is F of J is just evaluate at time T. This is linear maps into the orthogonal orthogonal complement of gamma prime of t.
00:55:14.477 - 00:56:07.933, Speaker A: Because the value at time t is always orthogonal to gamma prime of T. So this is mapping from this n minus one dimensional space into the n minus one dimensional subspace of t gamma of T which is orthogonal to that guy. And F is an isomorphism if and only if F is not. If and only if F is injective because the dimensions are the same. And that's if and only if Gamma T is not conjugate to gamma zero. The same argument as before. Okay, so that was a bunch of sort of simple propositions and corollaries about Jacobi fields.
00:56:07.933 - 00:57:22.751, Speaker A: As I said, we're going to be using these things in the coming weeks. And I'll remind you, this is something we proved at the end of chapter five. So are there any questions about that before we completely switch gears? All right, so what comes next in docarmo we could have done several weeks ago? It's kind of strange how he chooses to order the topics, but we're going to follow basically his order. The next thing to do is to show that if you have a Riemannian metric on a manifold, you obtain a metric in the space of metric spaces. So every Riemannian manifold as a set, together with the distance function, which I'm going to define now, becomes a metric space, at least a connected Riemannian manifold. And then you can ask, well, if you have a metric space, you get a topology. How does that differ from the topology that M has as a manifold? And we'll see that it doesn't differ.
00:57:22.751 - 00:58:13.015, Speaker A: It's the same. And then you can ask, what nice properties do metric spaces have? A metric space, the best kind of metric space is a complete metric space. Okay, and what does that mean in terms of the Riemannian metric? For the metric space to be complete, it's going to be equivalent to what's called geodesically complete, which is equivalent to all the geodesics exist for all time. Okay, so this is not obvious, but it won't be hard to prove. So that's the Hopp Rhino theorem and various characterizations of completeness. So we'll start that now, we'll probably finish it sometime on Wednesday. And then we're going to get to what's called the Cartan Hadamard Theorem, which is our first sort of global result, right, where we assume some local information about the metric and we deduce a global topological consequence.
00:58:13.015 - 00:59:15.435, Speaker A: Okay, so this part is completeness and the Hopf Rhino theorem. I don't know how to pronounce Rhino. I'm assuming that's how to do it, but it's probably wrong. So let's start with the definition. I think I gave this definition earlier, but I'll do it again. Let MG be Riemannian. We say the metric G is geodesically complete if and only if for all P and M X P is defined on all of tpm.
00:59:15.435 - 01:00:33.525, Speaker A: Okay? So equivalently, for all P and M and for all V in TPM, the geodesic gamma V with gamma 0 is P and gamma V prime at 0 is V is defined on all of R. Remember, we know that given an initial point and initial velocity, the geodesic will be defined on some open interval containing the origin, and we can take the maximal open interval on which it's defined. But we've already seen examples that this doesn't have to be all of R. So if it's true that every geodesic with every initial point and every initial velocity is defined for all of R, we call that Riemannian metric geodesically complete. So, of course, on the same manifold, you can have different Riemannian metrics, and some of them might be geodesically complete and some of them might not be geodesically completed. Okay? So that's the definition. So from now on, unless I say otherwise, let's suppose M is connected.
01:00:33.525 - 01:01:22.909, Speaker A: If it's not, we just do this on every connected component. They don't see each other, they can't communicate. So then MG becomes a metric space as follows. So I have to define a distance function and prove that it's a distance function. Okay? So let's let P and Q be an M. There exists a piecewise smooth curve joining P to Q. So here I'm using the fact that it's connected.
01:01:22.909 - 01:02:21.535, Speaker A: So in fact you can do this with a smooth curve, right? Because if it's piecewise smooth, it has a finite number of possible sharp turns in its velocity vector. You can just sort of zoom in there with a coordinate chart and you can smooth it out easily. But I'm going to prefer to use piecewise smooth curves because I want to get the triangle inequality for a metric space, okay? So I really care about the set of piecewise smooth curves joining P to Q. And this uses the fact that M is connected. Uses M is connected. Okay, so let's define the distance from P to Q is going to be the distance from P to Q. It's going to be the infimum over all piecewise smooth curves.
01:02:21.535 - 01:02:57.061, Speaker A: Alpha joining P to Q of the length of alpha. Okay, we know there's at least one curve from P to Q. It has some length which is non negative. It might be zero if P equals Q. And then so there's a whole set, a non empty set of such curves. And these are all non negative real numbers. I'm taking the inf of a non empty set of non negative real numbers.
01:02:57.061 - 01:04:09.735, Speaker A: So this is non negative real number. Okay, so what we want to do is show that this makes M into a metric space. Lemma MD is a metric space and so it's clear. So we already know that D of PQ is greater than or equal to zero. And it's clear that D of P Q equals D of qp. It's symmetry symmetric because anytime we have a curve from P to Q, we can follow the inverse curve and get a curve from Q to P, and those have the same length. Okay, let's look at so remains to show the triangle inequality and that DPQ equals 0 if and only if P equals Q.
01:04:09.735 - 01:05:02.015, Speaker A: So we have to prove those two things. So let's let P, q and R be points in M. So I know that there exists some curve alpha 1 from P to Q piecewise smooth curve and there exists some curve Alpha 2 from Q to R. So if I follow first Alpha 1 and then Alpha 2. And this is why I want to use piecewise smooth curves. I get a piecewise smooth curve from P to R. So Alpha 1 followed by Alpha 2 is a piecewise smooth curve from P to R.
01:05:02.015 - 01:05:48.115, Speaker A: Okay? And it has a length equal to the length of alpha 1 plus the length of alpha 2. That's how we define length of piecewise smooth curves, by adding up the length of the pieces. So the distance from P to R is certainly less than or equal to the length of this curve, because this is a piecewise smooth curve from P to R. And that's equal to l of alpha one plus l of alpha two. Now let's take the infinite over all alpha ones from P to Q. And then the INF overall alpha 2s from Q to R. Take INF over all alpha 1 from P to Q.
01:05:48.115 - 01:06:47.735, Speaker A: We get that the distance from P to R is less than or equal to the distance From P to Q +L of Alpha 2. And now take the infinite overall Alpha 2 from Q to R. And we get that the distance from P to R is less than or equal to the distance From P to Q + the distance from Q to R. So that's the triangle inequality. One more thing to prove. So it's also clear, and I'll say in words, that D of P P equals zero. If you like having the constant curve as being one of your piecewise smooth curves, then there's no problem there, because the constant curve is a piecewise smooth curve from P to P and it has length zero.
01:06:47.735 - 01:07:41.275, Speaker A: If you don't like that, just take an open neighborhood of P, let's say a coordinate neighborhood, and just look at little loops going from P to P, and you can make those as small as you want, right? So the INF is zero. So it remains to show that the distance from P to q equals 0 implies p equals Q. And this is the only non trivial part of the argument. And this is where we're going to use some Riemannian geometry. So suppose that the distance from P to q was 0, but p is not equal to Q. We need to get a contradiction. Let B epsilon of P be a normal ball centered at P, centered at P that does not contain Q.
01:07:41.275 - 01:08:28.963, Speaker A: Right? We can do this because since P is not equal to Q, the manifold is Hausdorff. I can find an open neighborhood of P which doesn't contain Q. And within that open neighborhood I can shrink it to get a Normal ball centered at P that does not contain Q. Let's draw a picture. This is P and this is B epsilon of P. And Q is somewhere outside. So epsilon is some positive number.
01:08:28.963 - 01:09:47.165, Speaker A: Since DPQ is 0 is less than epsilon, there exists a piecewise smooth curve alpha joining P to Q with length less than epsilon. Because the the distance is the info for all such lengths. And since the inch is zero for any positive number, I can find a curve whose length is less than half. But the segment of alpha contained in B epsilon P has length at least epsilon. By the locally length minimizing property of geodesics. Well, by, let's say properties of normal balls. By properties of normal balls, I'll draw a picture and I'll explain it.
01:09:47.165 - 01:10:32.741, Speaker A: And that's our contradiction. So P equals Q. So what do I mean? Here we proved that if you're in a normal ball, and remember, for a normal ball, that means that the closure is also contained inside the image of a point of an open set on which the exponential map is a diffeomorphism. So this part of alpha is the part until it first hits the boundary of B epsilon P. That's a curve from P to some point R on the boundary. But we know that this curve is the unique minimizing geodesic from P to R, because this is a normal ball. And this curve has length epsilon, the radius of the ball.
01:10:32.741 - 01:11:51.425, Speaker A: So this orange, this green curve, which is the part of alpha until it hits the first hits the boundary, already has length bigger than it has length at least epsilon, because this one is the shortest one, and therefore alpha has length at least epsilon. But there's our contradiction. Okay, so we use the fact that that we know we can find a sufficiently small neighborhood of P, which is called a normal ball, where we know the distances that we know the length of the shortest curves between two points there, the unique minimizing geodesic. Okay, so this gives us a metric space. Now we can ask all the nice questions about metric spaces. So let's make a note. If there exists a minimizing geodesic gamma joining P to Q, then the distance from P to Q is the length of this minimizing geodesic.
01:11:51.425 - 01:13:17.195, Speaker A: But such a gamma need not exist. We haven't proven that any two points can be joined by minimizing geodesic. By the way, is a little bit of redundancy here, right? Because we proved a few weeks ago that if you had a minimizing curve joining two points, in other words, it's a piecewise smooth curve joining those two points, and its length is less than or equal to any other length of a piecewise smooth curve joining those two points, then it had to be a geodesic, right? So you can't have a minimizing curve that's not a geodesic. But of course, not every geodesic is a minimizing curve. And we also know that a geodesic is smooth, so it won't be piecewise smooth, it'll actually be smooth. So whenever we can join two points by minimizing geodesic, then it's easy to compute this inf it's just the length of that that geodesic. Hence, if epsilon positive is sufficiently small so that B epsilon of P is a normal ball centered at P, then the epsilon of P is exactly the set of all points in M such that the distance is less than epsilon.
01:13:17.195 - 01:14:20.465, Speaker A: Okay, so the notation is consistent with what you're used to using in metric space notation, right? You would like this to mean the set of all points in your metric space whose distance to P is less than epsilon. Okay, we already defined what this guy is a few weeks ago, and we only made sense of this for epsilon. Sufficiently small metric balls you can define for any positive radius. Okay? But what we're saying is that if the radius is small enough, then a metric ball is exactly a normal ball. And that's because we're in this setting, right? If you're, if you take any points, if you take any point outside of here, then the distance is bigger than epsilon to that point, because again, this argument, you're going to hit the ball at some point and that already has distance at least epsilon. So if you're outside of here, you're outside of here. And if you're in here because it's a normal ball, we know that the distance is exactly the length of the radial geodesics.
01:14:20.465 - 01:16:07.695, Speaker A: So what this says, so hence if epsilon is sufficiently small, a normal ball v epsilon P is a metric ball. And by metric ball, I mean this right hand side. Okay, so the corollary to this, and I think that's probably a good place to stop, is that the topology induced by this metric space metric is the same as the original topology. So let's see why that's true. Corollary, the topology induced on M by the metric space metric or the distance function D coincides with the original manifold topology. And I claim that's immediate from that remark, but let's put in the details. Okay, so what do we need to show that this coincides we need to show that if you have an open set in one, it's open in the other and vice versa.
01:16:07.695 - 01:17:23.625, Speaker A: Okay, so proof. Here's Let U be open in the metric space md. Okay? So then there exists let P being in U, There exists some epsilon positive, which I can take sufficiently small such that the metric ball, so this means the ball of radius epsilon with respect to the distance function is equal to the normal ball and is contained in U. So I know, I know, because it's open and this is a metric space. I know there's some metric ball centered at P containing U. And so I can take the radius of that metric ball smaller to make it the radius of a normal ball. And then it's contained in U, and hence, and this, this is open in M.
01:17:23.625 - 01:18:17.965, Speaker A: The ball of the normal ball is open in M, and therefore what I can do. So here's the picture. B epsilon P, which is B epsilon D of P is open in M. So for every point P, I can find an open set in M which contains P and which is contained in U. That means I can write U as a union of these guys, and they're all open in M. So U is open in M. And conversely, suppose V is open in M and let P be in V.
01:18:17.965 - 01:19:37.015, Speaker A: There exists some epsilon positive, again sufficiently small, such that B epsilon P, which is the same as B epsilon DP, is contained in V and this one is open in the metric space. Again, how do I know this? Because V is open in M, P is in V. So I can find an open neighborhood, I can shrink V, I can find a small enough open neighborhood of P in V, which is a normal ball, and then it's a metric ball. So again, by taking the union over all of these, so V is open in md, okay? And then the last thing to say corollary, by the way, you see that the original manifold topology was there before we put a metric on it, right? And there's lots of different metrics you can put on there. But what we're saying is that all these metrics, all these Riemannian metrics, they all give you different metric space metrics, different distance functions. But the topology that these distance functions gives you is always the same. It's the one from before.
01:19:37.015 - 01:20:36.679, Speaker A: Completeness is not a topological property, it's a metrics based property, right? So you can have two different distance functions coming from two different Romanian metrics on M. They're going to give you the same topology, but one might be complete, one might not, because that has to do with the metric distance. So, final corollary, let P0 be a point in M. The function F from M to R given by F of Q is the distance From P to P 0 to Q is continuous on M. And that's basic metric space theory, right? The distance function of a metric space is always continuous. Okay? So this function distance to a fixed point is a continuous function. We're going to stop here.
01:20:36.679 - 01:21:18.277, Speaker A: So next time we're going to. Now, now that we know that our manifold is a metric space, we can ask is it complete as a metric space? And we'll see the punchline. I'm spoiling it for you, but you should still show up on Wednesday. The punchline is the Hoff Rhino theorem, which says that as a metric space, it's complete if and only if that Riemannian metric is geodesically complete, which is not at all obvious, but it won't be that hard to prove. And after that, we're going to prove the Cartan Hadamard theorem. So I'm going to need to tell you some facts which you may or may not know about covering spaces and fundamental groups and deck transformations and all that stuff. So I'll probably prepare a handout and give it to you as sort of supplementary views.
01:21:18.277 - 01:21:26.485, Speaker A: There's a minimum amount of topology that from now on would be helpful, but I'm not assuming you all have it, so I'll just tell you what it is, okay?
