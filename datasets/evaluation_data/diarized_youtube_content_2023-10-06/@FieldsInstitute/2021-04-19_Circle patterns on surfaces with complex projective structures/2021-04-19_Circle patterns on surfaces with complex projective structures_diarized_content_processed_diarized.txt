00:00:00.600 - 00:00:37.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm going to talk about this CPM structure, circle patterns. And then, so this talk, I want to do it in a different way. So I want to focus on this potential opacity. And so one reason is because I have several discussion with my colleagues and then I have the feeling that. So this infinitesimal rigidity of circle packings and circle patterns. So for those questions you can use this quotangent apathy to do a thing. So I think, so I think I should take this chance to advertise how this codangeroll patient and also how this one is used in the proof also in my work.
00:00:37.320 - 00:01:28.552, Speaker A: So about this, about the conjecture by Kojima, Mister Shima and Tan. And then, yeah, okay, so let's see how this goes. So my goal is I really want to talk about how this cosengula pathian is used to study this CP one structures. So this is, and then, okay, and then more than that, it turns out this codename is not only useful for the torus and then it can be used in some other cases more than that. So, so okay let's, so let's let me say what is this circle pattern? So for me, a circle pattern is a realization of a pynar graph on the Riemann sphere such that the vertices of each face lie on a circle. And then more than that also require that the neighboring circles will intersect with the prescribed intersection angle. So let's say theta between CO2 PI.
00:01:28.552 - 00:02:45.894, Speaker A: And then, so one thing I want to say is, so this circle packing is a special case of circle pattern. So the way how I do this is the following. So if I have a circle packing like this, so what I'm going to do is, okay, I put the vertices for all the tangency points and then I can connect this neighboring vertices and then find edge. And then, now this one gives me a face, so this will give me one face, and then if I do it for the other circle, so I have this face and then here I also have one face and then I also have one face and then I do this the following, so here automatically for this face you have a circle already, and then for this phase you also have a circle passing going this way. So, okay, so altogether, so you will get a, so if you make a circle packing by taking the tangency points, then you get a realization of a pyramid graph such that the vertices of each face lie on a circle and then more than that. So if you look at kind of this circle and then, so this extra circle that, and then the original circle all these circles will intercept 90 degrees. So this theta, they all take value PI half.
00:02:45.894 - 00:03:12.960, Speaker A: So really intercept in a prescribed angle. And then if I do something more than that, because later on I prefer the triangle, I prefer the graph to be a triangulation. So I would just take, I just take the diagonal. So I just put more edges. And in this case, so if you measure the intersection angle for this, yeah. Okay, so for this circle you have this circle. And then for this triangle, you also have this circle.
00:03:12.960 - 00:03:46.494, Speaker A: So if you look at the intersection angle of these two circle, this is just exactly equal to zero. So, okay, so more or less. So whenever I have this circle packing, and then by looking at this dual circle packing, so these are the dual circle packing, then I will get a circle pack time with the prescribed intersection angle. And then it's always PI half. If I put more diagonal, then I will get this steel. So this thing can go backwards. So if you have this circle pattern in this way, then you can also separate into two parts this circle packing and also the dual packing so you don't lose anything.
00:03:46.494 - 00:04:20.038, Speaker A: So this circle pattern, that what I mean? So, yeah, it is, it might be different from what you heard of last few days. So, yes, yeah, so, yeah, okay. It is a little bit different from the talk by jeju. Okay, so this circle pattern for me. And then whenever you four points in the plane, then you can compute the cross visuals. So what I want to do the following is I want to parameterize my circle pattern using cross ratios. So if you give me a pynograph, then I can subdivide it into triangulations.
00:04:20.038 - 00:05:03.356, Speaker A: And then now we can assign a cross ratio for every interior edge. So, so if you give me one, one edge and then I have two neighboring triangles, now four vertices then, now I can compute the cross visual of these four vertices and then assign the compass number to this edge. And then this would define a function, compass value function over edges. And then now you ask, so what kind of equation would this cross visual satisfying? And then it turns out if you multiply all these crossvisual on one single vertice, then it is equal to one. And then, and then, and then if you take this, uh, this summation, then you get zero. So what does it mean? So if you, uh, yeah, actually, so this equation just tell you that. So the holonomy.
00:05:03.356 - 00:05:38.044, Speaker A: The holonomy I want each interior vertex is the identity map. So we call that if you give me some triangle. And then if you tell me what is the crossville of this edge, then I know how to figure out this triangle. And then if you tell me this, the cross ratio for this edge, I know how to lay out the second one. And then if you keep doing this one, then when you go backward, when you, when you go run around, the original triangle may differ from the last one by a mobile transformation. So this is the matrix in SL. So this is, you can regard it as a matrix sl two c.
00:05:38.044 - 00:06:03.852, Speaker A: And then, so the eigenvalues just lambda one over lambda. And then now you want to make it an identity. So you want to make this eigenvalue as equal to one. So this is, yeah, this one is really means the eigenvalue is equal to one. And then, and then now, yeah, you want to have this off diagonal entry to be zero. So this zero is really this zero. So altogether.
00:06:03.852 - 00:06:41.544, Speaker A: So this equation just tells you that the holonomy around each vertex is identity. Okay, so that means, yeah, you can just lay out all the circle. And then, okay, so now, so we focus on this cross ratios. So, yeah, okay, and then now I, so start with a triangulation of a closed surface. Then a cross racial system is just a map defined on the edges such that these two equations are satisfied. And then now we want to focus on this Delaunay circle pattern. So I say a deloni angle structure is an assignment, theta over edges.
00:06:41.544 - 00:07:21.322, Speaker A: And then now instead of zero to two PI. So now this angle is go from zero to PI only. And that's satisfying. So whenever you look at one vertex, the sum of all this angle around one vertex should be equal to two PI. And then if you take any closed loop on the dual graph bounding more than one vertice, then you, the summation of this angle should be larger than two PI. And then, yeah, so this equation, it's mysterious, but I'm pretty sure you have seen it in the last few days. So, okay, and then, so now what we are going to do is, so we want to consider the space of all these cross ratios satisfying these two equations.
00:07:21.322 - 00:08:01.908, Speaker A: And also the argument of x is equal to theta. And then, yeah, so this argument is, you can also write it as the same thing as the imaginary part of the log of x. Okay. And then it turns out, well, why we consider this, this argument of x is because, so if you look at this edge, so you have two circle and then you have the cross ratio over this edge. And then if you look at, yeah, this intersection angle, this is theta. So it is exactly given by this argument of x. So the argument, the crossvision is very convenience.
00:08:01.908 - 00:08:37.552, Speaker A: Okay. Okay so this p theta is the space of cross ratio x such that the imaginary path, the law of x is equal to theta. And another way to say this is, so these are the space of circle patterns with prescribed angle theta on compass projective surfaces. The reason why you have this cp one structure is the following because so you can imagine, so each, each circle. So actually each disc is your, is your chart. And then you know what is the cross ratio for this edge. Then you know how these two disks are grouped.
00:08:37.552 - 00:09:00.230, Speaker A: And then in particular these two disks are grouped by a mobile transformation. So yeah, altogether. So if you know this cross visuals and it's delaunay, then you get this, the charts and then you give you a cpu structure. So yeah, so this p theta. So you have everything. Okay. Okay.
00:09:00.230 - 00:09:36.572, Speaker A: Okay now I just come down to the, to the, to the main results that I'm going to explain. So, okay so this Pm are denoted as the space of cv one structure and then Pm is the tight Mueller space. And then the theorem a is the following. So if you fix any triangulations and any delonic angle structure on the torus, then I can tell you that this p theta is a real analytic surface homomorphic to r two. And then this p theta to the space of cp one structure is an embedding. And then in particular the holonomy map is also an embedding. And then the second, the theorem b is the following.
00:09:36.572 - 00:10:02.462, Speaker A: So if you consider this p theta projected to the tenure space, it is a homomorphism. So everything is about, about the torus case. So these two things theorem. So they are excited. So they, so they, they prove the conjecture, this quadrilateral schumer tan conjecture for the torus case. And then, so I'm going to explain you. So the proof and especially how this conjugate patient is used.
00:10:02.462 - 00:10:49.150, Speaker A: And then, so before that I want to mention that. So I really like this theorem is because, so this theorem just tells you that this discrete conformal structure can be very different from the classical conformal structure because whenever you pick two points in this space, you have these two circle patterns with the same intersection angle. So usually we will regard them as being the same discrete copper mole structure. But now if you look at the underlying classical Cogn structure and then this theorem just tell you that they can be very different. So I think this is the very nice thing about this conjecture. And then for the case, genius is larger than one steel conjecture. Okay, so these are, yeah, so the whole thing, this background has been explained very nicely by Philipp on Tuesday.
00:10:49.150 - 00:11:14.352, Speaker A: So I'm going to say much about this. So I'm just go to the proof directly and about this also this cotangela passion. Okay, so this is outline. So yeah, just so this outline is more or less the outline given by Ko chi, Mister Shima and Tan. So in their paper, when they make the conjecture, they already outlined. So what are the steps that you should take? And then, so these are the steps. So I'm going to say this.
00:11:14.352 - 00:11:38.288, Speaker A: So I'll show that this p theta is real and this surface and homomorphic to al two. And the projection to the tachymeter is proper map. And then this is local homomorphism. And in particular for that part, this cotangent of Palsyn is very important. And then I will, I will show you why is this the case. And then in the end I can, I will tell you that it is indeed a homomorphism. Okay, so more or less the plan.
00:11:38.288 - 00:11:58.760, Speaker A: Is there any question? Okay, so these are the statements. And then I'm going into the proof. So if everything's fine, then I'll just move on. Okay. Okay. Okay. So the first thing is, so this p theta is a real analytic surface.
00:11:58.760 - 00:12:38.810, Speaker A: So, you know, remember, so this p theta is defined by an algebraic system. So what we need to do is to study that algebraic system to show that it is a real analytic surface. So now I take a family of cross ratio that satisfies those algebraic equations. And then, now I take a lot of this cross ratio and I compute this derivative. And then I call it as q. So another way, again, is x dot divided by x. So, one thing, observe that this q is real value, because as I said, so when I look at this space, the imaginary part of the log of x t, they always equal to theta.
00:12:38.810 - 00:13:17.380, Speaker A: So this always equal to this design angle structure, it is independent of t. So when you differentiate this guy, the imaginary part, the derivative is zero. So that means only the real part is a five. So that means y, this q is real value. And then if you differentiate those algebraic equation, then you get the following, the summation of this qiji, uh, it's equal to zero. And then also have, uh, this, uh, this summation is equal to zero. So, so what is this q? So actually, so if you have, yeah, so this p theta is some, have, you have some algebraic equations equal to zero.
00:13:17.380 - 00:13:55.326, Speaker A: And then, now this q is just telling you, is telling you that. So this q is living inside the jacobian of this algebraic equations. So what we want to do is we want to study the kernel of this jacobian. And then it turns out, okay, so before that, so this q, we also call it as a discrete quadratic differentials. And then, so if you have heard of my talk at Isam last year when I talk about a topic on this, then I explained so how this relates to the cell stress. And in fact, this correct differential is really the cell stress in the setting of circle patterns. And then, okay, and then that's it.
00:13:55.326 - 00:14:37.096, Speaker A: Okay, and then now we, okay, so what we want to do is we want to study the kernel of this jacobian. And then it turns out that, as we will see, so this q is related to discrete harmonic function. And then from there we can use this investment principle to deduce what is the dimension of this space. And it turns out the dimension of the kernel of this jacobian is always equal to two whenever you are, whenever you have this belonging circle pattern. And then all together, if you have this constant rank theorem, then you can deduce that this p theta is a real analytic surface. So this part is very easy. You just want to, need to make sure the dimension is equal to two.
00:14:37.096 - 00:14:58.084, Speaker A: So we will see how to do this. Okay, and then now come to the second part. So if I know that it is a real analytic surface. So I want to know what is the topology. So it turns out it's homomorphic to r two. And then there we need to talk about the affine torrid. So, okay, so this compass, affine structures on Tori.
00:14:58.084 - 00:15:46.122, Speaker A: So affine structure is a maximum island of char to see such that the transition functions are affine maps. So these are the affine maps, ac plus b. And then, yeah, so if you have this conformal structure, then the transition function is a conformal map, you have a cp one structure, then these are the mobile transformations. But, okay, now in this case it is affine structure. So we just consider the transition functions as affine maps. Okay, and then, now what we are going to do is we want to promotize the affine structures on torus. So how can we do that? So how can we parameterize this affine structures on a torus? So, okay, first of all, if you want to, if you want to get a euclidean torus, so what can you, what can you do? What you can you do is just take a quotient.
00:15:46.122 - 00:16:20.936, Speaker A: So, uh, by a lattice, so generated by one and then by tau, and then tau is a compass number. Imagine plus larger than zero. Then if you look at this lattice, then each fundamental domain is a parallelogram. And then if you grew this opposite sign of the parallelogram. Then you get a torus. So, so this tau, so the message is this tau promontorize the conformal structure. So this parameterized the titular space, so different tau give you different points on the tachymeria space, okay, and then for the affine torus, so what can we do? So we know that.
00:16:20.936 - 00:17:22.847, Speaker A: So actually the developing map of all these affineauris can be given by this mapping. So you just take z and then you take an exponential map. So you take e to the maps to the Cc and then for some non zero number, and then if you do this, then you map your torus to do something, give it an exponential map. Then you might get something like, like this. So this is the origin and then, yeah, this is the origin and something like this, you just, yeah, just take the exponential map, then you get something like this and then, and then the message here is, so this affine structure on the torus are parameterized exactly by these two number tau and c. So in the case that c is equal to zero, then it will give you the euclidean torus, okay, okay, so a fine structure on the torus are parameterized by these two numbers, okay, so this is what we are going to look into. And then, so one more thing before moving on is so we can look at the holonomy of the affine structures.
00:17:22.847 - 00:18:07.452, Speaker A: So if I write this gamma one, gamma two, the generators of the fundamental group, then, yeah, so if you have the developing map, so you have the point and then you shift by gamma one, okay, so this gamma one is, this one, this is gamma one and then this is gamma two. So this dimensions, so if I have a point, I shift by gamma one. So it means I have just c plus one because it's the, on the lattice. And then if I apply the developing map, then I will get this constant, some multiple constant e to the power. Yeah, so this multiple constant and then, so this is, and I just write it as row one. So this is the fine holonomy. And then if I move it to gamma two then I'll just shift by, by tau.
00:18:07.452 - 00:18:55.344, Speaker A: And then if you put it in, into this formula, then you see that, so this const, this constant comes up, then this is my, yeah. Finally for this gamma two, okay, so we're going to use it, okay, and now you might ask so why we need this affine structure. And then the thing is for the torus. So we can always reduce cv one structure to affine structure and then it will make everything simpler. So the reason is very simple. So because you notice that this PI one torus, the fundamental group is abelian gamma one circle gamma two is equal to gamma two circle gamma one. And then you look at the holonomy of the cp one structure, this one theta and wo two theta.
00:18:55.344 - 00:19:33.254, Speaker A: So, so these two, you can regard them as two by two matrices. Yeah. So in particular they are sl two c. And then they also satisfy this relation. So if you remember in linear algebra, so if you have two matrices, so you have this ab equal to ba, then you can deduce that the eigenvalues are the same. Okay, they have the same, they share the same eigenvalues. So from linear algebra, and then, but then in terms of this mobile transformation, it just tells you that this, they share either one fixed point or two fixed points.
00:19:33.254 - 00:20:10.408, Speaker A: And then if they share one fixed point, then what we can do is we can make this point, we can take mobile transformations and then normalize this developing map such that that fixed point is at infinity. And then in that case this becomes, uh, translations. And then if you have two fixed point, then we can make one point at zero and then the other point at infinity. And then in that case, uh, yeah, we can get this non euclidean affine structure. Yeah, so, so this what you do. And then, and then it turns out. So this is the, yeah, uh, theorem by gunning.
00:20:10.408 - 00:20:36.876, Speaker A: So every theorem structure on the torus can be reduced to an affine structure. So one thing you should be careful is that whenever you have this CPU structure, you will give you some affine structures. So if you have one CPU structure, then you give you tau c or tau minus c. The reason is because of the following. So here you have this non euclidean albin structure. You have two fixed points. There's a choice.
00:20:36.876 - 00:21:12.238, Speaker A: So you can make this point as zero and at this point at infinity, or the other way. So you can make this point as zero and then this point as infinity. And then if you do this two different choices, it will give you two different affine structures. And then, because, yeah, the correspondence is exactly, you just interchange zero to infinity. So it's really just a mapping from c to one over z. So you, you will just make this, yeah, this affine parameter from plus c to minus c. So, but then, okay, but originally they represent the same cp one structure.
00:21:12.238 - 00:21:50.072, Speaker A: So that is the statement. So whenever you have one cp, one structures, you can get two different affine structures. So this is tau plus c or tau minus c. Yeah, but then the underlying CPU structures are the same. Okay, so now, so if you remember our theorem saying that this theorem B is saying that. So the, the space of circle patterns on CPU structure is homomorphic to the tabernacle space. So now instead, if you say instead of compact structure, you consider a fine structure, then you can also make a similar statement.
00:21:50.072 - 00:22:24.414, Speaker A: So the statement will become the following. So if you look at the space of circle patterns on a fine toleri, then the projection to the titular space is two to one mapping. The reason why you get this two to one mapping is because this CPU structures can give you two different affine structures. And then, yeah, okay, so here's a one remark. So if you just stick to the affine structure, then the projection, the tangential space will become a two to one mapping. Okay, but then if I want to make my life simpler, then I'll just stick to this cpu structure. Then it would be a homomorphism.
00:22:24.414 - 00:23:04.724, Speaker A: Okay, okay, so this is one thing. So we can reduce severe structures to affine structure, okay, and then, now here's a result. By, by, within, so within results will tell us the following. So this circle patterns on affine Tori, in fact they are parameterized by the scaling part of the hydronomy. So here's the precise statement. So here you have this theta, any delinquent angle structure and then a one, a two, there's just some real number. Then there will exist a unique affine structure with holonomy in this form, such that the scaling part of the holonomy which is given.
00:23:04.724 - 00:23:47.548, Speaker A: Okay, so usually the scaling part is the magnitude of alpha, but then if you take the log of alpha, that is just the real part. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, so if you look at the real part of the log of alpha, so this is scaling part and then, which is really kind of the how your circle from one fundamental domain get scaled to another circle. Okay, and then yeah, scaling time is this one. And then they will also exist a circle pattern. And the cross visuals will satisfy this. The argument is given by this theta.
00:23:47.548 - 00:24:12.164, Speaker A: And then it turns out, yeah, at the moment, if a one, a two, they are both zero, then. So this is, this, this are all equal to one. So these are all equal to one. And then, so you could just get translation. In that case you get the euclidean torus. Okay, so this is result by, within the way how he did is by looking at this original argument. So revisional method to do this.
00:24:12.164 - 00:24:55.554, Speaker A: And then, okay, so we can say a lot from this theorem, in fact, so, okay, so, okay, so for the non euclidean torus, so we just assume this beta equal to zero, and then the theorem by, within actually improves the rest of theorem. A actually. So first thing is p theta is homomorphic to al two. The reason is because, yeah, if you have, look at this circle patterns on affine tori. So, so these are parameterized by these two real number. So this is l two. And then if you look at this circle patterns on a fine tori and then you map it to circle patterns on compressed projective surface, it is a two to one mapping.
00:24:55.554 - 00:25:28.062, Speaker A: So if your upper one is homomorphic to al two then you know that the lower one is also homophobic to altru. So you know that this p theta is homomorphic to al two. And then, and then, now because, so this, uh. Yeah, this affine, yeah. So the affine tori that you get are parameterized uniquely by, by this, the scaling part of the holonomy. So, so what you, you can deduce the following. So the holonomy mapping of this p theta is an embedding.
00:25:28.062 - 00:26:09.714, Speaker A: It is because, yeah, so whenever you have this two, if you have two guys, the scaling part are the same then they must be the same circle pattern, the same affine structure. So you have, yeah, so you really have this embedding. And then here you have, you know, this horror map is embedding. Then you know that if you have this circle patterns, you forget a circle pattern. You look at the cp one structure then this mapping is also an embedding. And then so altogether you get the theorem a so very easily coming from this reserve by within. So the main difficulty is how to prove that the projection to the titanium space is the homomorphism.
00:26:09.714 - 00:26:21.714, Speaker A: Okay, so for the woman, is, is everything good? Okay, sounds.
00:26:22.734 - 00:26:24.714, Speaker B: Which paper of ribbon is that?
00:26:26.014 - 00:26:47.524, Speaker A: This in n of math. So he considered 1994, there's a paper annual mass. And then he considered the volume of ideal hyperbolic polyhedron. And then, yeah, if you have this critical point then you give you this super pattern. Yeah, that one.
00:26:47.864 - 00:26:54.866, Speaker C: And then is this Delaunay angle the same angle system that you set up?
00:26:55.010 - 00:26:57.394, Speaker A: Yes yes yes yes yes.
00:26:57.434 - 00:27:02.614, Speaker C: So there's an under, there's an underlying combinatorial pattern here in Riven's result.
00:27:03.514 - 00:27:11.654, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. So this, this theta is really the theta satisfied though. Yeah. Yeah. So this equation and also this one.
00:27:13.514 - 00:27:24.520, Speaker B: And one more quick question. I should have asked this earlier, but when you have the circle pattern that, and you described the charts, the cp one charts.
00:27:24.672 - 00:27:25.408, Speaker A: Yes.
00:27:25.576 - 00:27:28.324, Speaker B: How do you get the charts for the centers of the circles?
00:27:31.864 - 00:27:34.324, Speaker A: The center, you mean this one.
00:27:34.704 - 00:27:36.264, Speaker B: How do you get the chart for.
00:27:36.424 - 00:27:47.556, Speaker A: A chart around Zi, so you, yeah, so the thing is, because I know the holonomy around each vertice is identity. So that's the point.
00:27:47.660 - 00:27:50.588, Speaker B: So if you point, okay.
00:27:50.756 - 00:28:03.164, Speaker A: Yeah. So if it's not identity, then you don't get. Right? Yeah. The point is identity. Okay. And then, so, well, actually, you still.
00:28:03.244 - 00:28:06.900, Speaker C: You still do get charts. It's just like a cone point, though.
00:28:07.052 - 00:28:22.568, Speaker A: Yeah. Cone pop. Not a structure on a closed surface. Yeah. So I, yeah, I want to stick to closed surfaces. Okay. And then this affine structure.
00:28:22.568 - 00:28:32.424, Speaker A: Affine structure. Then. Now I want to tell you this proper map. The problem is very easy, this one. Slide. So, previously we look at the scaling part. Now we can look at the rotation part of the hierarchy.
00:28:32.424 - 00:29:12.214, Speaker A: The rotation part is the imaginary part of the log of Alpha I. So what is the geometric meaning for this guy? So if you look at this affine torus. So let's say this is the origin. Then you have this fundamental domain of your affine torus. Then you can measure what is this angle, more or less, you can measure what is this angle, this angle. It turns out if this is gamma, gamma one, then this angle is exactly the imaginable of the log of, uh, alpha, alpha one. So, so this, this, yeah, this number.
00:29:12.214 - 00:29:40.486, Speaker A: So tells you how, how one side is rotated to the other side. So this is given by this angle. And then, so generally. So if you want to tell this, this guy. So this, if you take the log and the imaginary part, it is determined up to a multiple of two PI. However, in our case. So we can just follow this gamma one to see really what is that multiple.
00:29:40.486 - 00:30:13.506, Speaker A: So we can really determine this number precisely. So, for example, if gamma one is like this, so then I know that this number is smaller than two PI. If I know that gamma one, the image of gamma one is like this one, then I know that it is more than two PI. So by following this gamma one, then you really can tell what is the imaginary part of the log of I. There's no ambiguity about this two part stuff. No, there's no. Okay.
00:30:13.506 - 00:30:54.210, Speaker A: And then the second thing is. So this number is very nice. So it is bounded by constant, depending on your triangulation only. So the reason, it's very simple. So you imagine if you have a torus, and then it only consists of three triangles, just something like, something like this, and only three triangles. And then, now can you have this fundamental domain, this fundamental domain, can this fundamental domain wrap around the origin, let's say, ten times? So here you think about this. It is impossible, because we want to have this circle pattern is Delaunay, this circle, the triangles are non degenerate.
00:30:54.210 - 00:31:45.908, Speaker A: And then if you have just three. Yeah, just three triangles, how can you walk around the origin? Yeah, ten times, so impossible. So in fact, so this is bounded by constant. So if you take, consider this guy, and then you take a path, this gamma, so this is your gamma and then, so, and then, yeah, so this number is, yeah, it's bounded by the kind of the modulus of gamma I times PI. And then this gamma I is the number of triangles, number of faces that you cross. So here, so yeah, because whenever you have this gamma I, you go from one phase to the other phase, this angle is at most PI. So if you have just, yeah, just, yeah, and this angle cannot be larger than n times PI.
00:31:46.036 - 00:31:52.644, Speaker D: Yes, so, so you're allowing an alpha and torus that they could wind many, many times around the world.
00:31:52.684 - 00:32:00.572, Speaker A: Yes, generally allow it. But then if I fix my triangulation, it can't be too many times, but.
00:32:00.588 - 00:32:01.452, Speaker D: It could be more than one, if.
00:32:01.468 - 00:32:46.384, Speaker A: It was a complicated, more than one, if you have many triangles. Yeah, it could be, but then the thing is, so this is imaging part is bounded by, by the, by the triangulations. And then, okay, so now the claim is, so we can prove using this result, we can prove the properness. So it's very easy. So you remember, so here you take a log of this alpha one, you get a fine parameter c, and then here you take the log of alpha two, then you get tau times c. So we see this here, so this too much. So we talk about this affine structure, okay, so here, so this is my alpha one.
00:32:46.384 - 00:33:42.948, Speaker A: So if I take the log, I'll get c and then for this, this is alpha two, if I take the log, I will get c tau. Okay, so this is what I need, okay, so, law of alpha one c, law of alpha two tau c and then you substitute this guy into c, then you get this relations. So now what we are going to do is we take the imaginary part of this equations. So if I take the imaginary part of this guy, I will get this one, and then if I take the imaginary part of this guy, I will get the imaginary part of this, times the real part of this, and then plus the real part of this times the immediate part of this. And then, now this equation is very useful because of the following. So I know that this guy is bounded, I know that this guy is also bounded. And then if I know my conformat structure in the technique, stay in the compass set, tau is bounded in a compact set.
00:33:42.948 - 00:34:24.089, Speaker A: And then I know that this is bounded and then this is bounded, and then this guy is bounded away from zero. So altogether I will know that this guy is also in the compass set. Okay. And then similarly, if I do this real part, then I can also deduce this guy is also encompassed. And then, so now it's very nice. So if I have a converging, converging sequence on the technical space, and then, yeah, so here are the circle patterns. And then if I look at the underlying convergence structure, and then if they have a converging sequence, then I can deduce that when you look at the holonomy, this holonomy also have a converging subsequence.
00:34:24.089 - 00:34:59.954, Speaker A: And then the limiting value. Then by result you get some two different number, and then by result by within, you know that for the corresponding limiting value you will have a circle pattern. And then, and then your claim is, yeah, okay, so anyway, so just say, yeah, so this mapping is a proper map just coming from this observations. So you, yeah, you can't wrap it too many times. So it's properness. Okay, now comes to the homomorphism. If everything is fine, is it? Okay, okay, okay, homomorphism.
00:34:59.954 - 00:35:52.144, Speaker A: Okay, so yeah, what I need is the cotangent opacity. So just because if I have a realization of a triangle mesh in the complex plane, then a function you define at the vertices is harmonic. If for every vertex I, you have this cij times u, g minus ui is equal to zero. So, so what is the summation? So you have, again, you have this one vertice I, and then you look at the neighboring, yeah, you look at the laboring vertices. So you just take this cij times utah minus ui over all these edges, and then, and then this cij is called potential rate. So what are these? So if you look at an edge ij, then you have two neighboring triangle k and then l. And then, now I want to compute the weights for this edge is the cotangent of this angle, this angle plus the cotangent of this angle.
00:35:52.144 - 00:36:35.772, Speaker A: Okay, but anyway, so cotangent, what I mean by cotangent is just one over tangent. So in case, just of confusion. So, okay, the cotangent rate of this for cij on this edge is the cotangent of this angle plus the cotangent of this angle. And then, so this cotangent weight. And then this just some simple observation is, so if this m is simply connected, then a function u is a harmonic if and only if there exists a conjugate harmonic function defined on faces such that for every edge, so you have this relation. So this is like the Cao chi Wiemann equations. So this is the real part of your holomotic function.
00:36:35.772 - 00:36:59.504, Speaker A: This is the imaginary part of your holomotic function. And then these two parts are related by some equation, the Cauchy Riemann equations. And then this is the Cauchy Riemann equations. Okay, so I jk, so the function u kind of, you can imagine. So it stay on the, live on the centers. And then, so this one live on the center. And then u j, u I did live on the, on the vertices.
00:36:59.504 - 00:37:23.732, Speaker A: And then this u star is called the conjugate harmonic function. And then you need up to an additive constant. Whenever you know u, then this is determined up to a constant. Okay, okay, so this cotangential passion. And then, okay, now comes to the funny thing. So how this harmonic function related to the circle pack, circle packing. Okay, so, so the claim is.
00:37:23.732 - 00:37:57.334, Speaker A: So whenever you have this, this one to one correspondence between this harmonic function and this infinitesimal deformation of circle patterns. So if you have this circle packing or circle patterns, you can permit it in many different ways. So one thing you can do is you just, you just prescribe the radii. And then if you know the radii, if the radii radius are very nice, then you can lay out your circles. And then, okay, so now you deform my circle packing, or circle patterns a little bit. Then you have the change of radius, and then you have this out. And then you consider this out divided by.
00:37:57.334 - 00:38:14.910, Speaker A: And then it turns out it will be a conjugate harmonic functions. So we call that. So for me, I have. So this, these are my vertices. And so this radius function, they live on the faces. And then this u star also live on the faces. So they are compatible.
00:38:14.910 - 00:38:26.954, Speaker A: So it turns out, yeah, if you have this deformation of your circle pattern, then you have this change of radius, and then divided by the original radius, then it would be the conjugate harmonic function. Yes. Some question.
00:38:27.534 - 00:38:30.514, Speaker D: What's the, what's the original function? What's the u?
00:38:32.054 - 00:38:36.286, Speaker A: No, u is. No, no. So this r is your original circle pattern.
00:38:36.430 - 00:38:42.246, Speaker D: Right. But, but I mean, u star is the con. You mean there is, there is some u. So this is the u star.
00:38:42.310 - 00:38:51.714, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually, so whenever you have, uh, then you get this u star, and then actually you can go backward. So whenever you have this u star, you can also get u.
00:38:51.754 - 00:38:55.682, Speaker D: So the deformation defines u star for you. And then you define u by the formula.
00:38:55.738 - 00:39:12.686, Speaker A: Yes, yes. Yes. Yeah. So this like you have one harmonic function, then you can always get the other one. Yeah, yeah. You also, by this formula, okay, so this is, uh, yeah, it's kind of the harmonic function on the dual graph. Yeah.
00:39:12.686 - 00:40:02.670, Speaker A: Just how many functions on the dual graph. And then you can also say, okay, instead of looking at the radius, so we can also look at how the vertices are deformed. So it's like this z, dot, CI, dot, and then if you look at this zi, dot and then, and then divided by c g I, then this, yeah, this determined by this formula. And then if you remember, if you have a linear with the, this averted scaling by fang law, then it might not be so surprising that you can see this term. So when you look at this rotation, it is given by the average of this u. And then actually it's like for this circle pattern, actually you have this vertice rotation, instead of vertices scaling, you have this vertex rotation. Okay, so this something is, yeah, here.
00:40:02.670 - 00:40:37.354, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, and then you can also promote this one by the change of the cross ratio. So you have this x dot divided by x. So as I said, you can, this is q and then, yeah, and then, yeah, the cross ratio of x, you have this multiple of cj minus CI and then blah, blah, blah. And then if you take the log and then you take the derivative, then you will just get this expression. And then, now if you substitute this formula into this one, then you can express this qij just in, in terms of this, uh, u star and then u. And then, so this is how, how they're related.
00:40:37.354 - 00:41:06.034, Speaker A: So if you are interested, then you can just work out the formula, but we are not going to use it. Okay, so this, these are the relations. So this harmonic function and then this deformation of circle patterns. Okay, and then, now what we are going to do is, so if you give me a developing map of an affine torus. So we want to consider the quotation of pathian. So, okay, see, developing map of affine torus. Then this cotangent part has the following nice properties.
00:41:06.034 - 00:41:46.424, Speaker A: The first thing is the cotangent rates are invariant under deck transformations. So you have this, you have one edge here in one fundamental domain. And then if you consider this edge in another fundamental domain, consider the edge way, they are just the same thing. So the reason is when you do this transformation, you just get an affine map, but then this CIj are defined in terms of the angle. So the angles are not changed. So that means this CIJ will not change at all. So this so this, yeah, so this really, the CIJ really live on the torus, but not just the universal cover really on the torus.
00:41:46.424 - 00:42:07.846, Speaker A: Okay. Anyway, and then this CIJ is also non negative. This comes from the delaunay condition. So because we assume our circle pattern is delaunay. So actually it will force this CIJ, they're all non negative. And then here you have this kind of graph Laplacian and then the edge, they are all non negative. Then you will have the maximum principle.
00:42:07.846 - 00:42:39.134, Speaker A: So, so that means you have this good harmonic function, you achieving some local minimum, the maximum as some interior vertices. Then it must be constant. Okay, so this maximum principle, surprising. Okay, so it is it. Okay, yeah, there is quite a lot of materials in the talk. So I, so yeah, just feel free to interrupt. Okay.
00:42:39.134 - 00:43:33.704, Speaker A: Yeah, because I just skip through all the background because I, yeah, because, yeah, so probably you have heard it on Tuesday already. Okay, and then, okay, now, so here we can, so if you have this deformation of circle patterns, then we can, we can consider what is the change in holonomy? And then, okay, so what is the change in holonomy? So we call that, so this is my holonomy representation of gamma one, gamma two. So if you go from a point and then apply this stack transformation gamma one, then you will just scale by Ec, and then for gamma two you get scale by c to the e to the power c tau. And then now you have this first order deformations, then this c and then tau would also change. You get a c dot and then tau dot. And then if you differentiate, then you get, yeah, you get the c dot times c dot here. And then for this guy, you'll get this c dot tau and then plus c tau dot.
00:43:33.704 - 00:44:20.936, Speaker A: And then, and then if you consider this woven dot divided by wo one, then another one, it turns out it is c dot independent of c and then divided by wo two. Then you get this c dot tau plus c tau dot. And then, okay, now we have this change in holonomy. And then, now you ask how this one is related to my harmonic functions. Okay, and then, turns out if you have this deformation of circle patterns and then you give me the change of harmonomy in this way, then the corresponding harmonic function will satisfy the following. So if you, okay, so originally you have a harmonic function u. And then, because I know that this cotangent rays, they're invariant under that transformation.
00:44:20.936 - 00:44:55.564, Speaker A: So if I look at this guy, it is again a harmonic function because the cotangent rays are invariant under that transformation. So if I take a function homogeneous, uh, and then I pre compose with a deck transformation. It is again a harmonic function. And then now you ask how this guy is related to the original one. And then it turns out they would differ by a constant. And then this constant is the imaginary part of c dot. So this guy, and then go to gamma two, then the difference would be the imaginary part of this guy.
00:44:55.564 - 00:45:46.614, Speaker A: Okay, and then now you ask, so only imaginary parts appears and then where are the real part? And then it turns out the real part appears in the conjugate harmonic functions. So if you consider the conjugate harmonic function again, so if you compare these two guys, they will differ by the real part of c dot and then these two guys will divide by the real part of this guy. So the way, how you imagine how you think about this harmonic function is, so these are the integral of a harmonic one form on the torus. So yeah, how many one form? And then we integrate and always differ by a constant. So this really, actually this, uh, yeah, like harmonic one form. Okay, so now, yeah, if everything is fine, every now we consider the divisionless energy. So, okay, just recall.
00:45:46.614 - 00:46:26.520, Speaker A: So our goal is to prove the local homomorphism. And then what we are going to do is we need to consider the division energy. So here's the game. So, okay, the first observation is, so if you have this, the harmonic function u, and then if you consider the difference of u, actually this is well defined on torus. It is because if I, I know that if I shift by gamma, then I'll differ by constant. Then if I have two adjacent vertices and have this uj and the ui, and if I compute the difference and then this constant will be gone. So, so that means this num, this, this value over address is well defined on the torus.
00:46:26.520 - 00:47:17.064, Speaker A: Okay, keep this in mind. Okay, so now we do the following game. So, okay, if I have. Yes, any question? Okay, okay, okay, so now we have this harmonic functions, and then what we say is it is related to the deformation of circle pattern. And then, now just now we relay this circle that we relate this harmonic function to the change of haronomy. Okay, by the way, this part is very useful because if I want to know whether my conformat structure change or not, I really need to look at this tau dot. So if, if the common structure is unchanged, then this tau dot is equal to zero.
00:47:17.064 - 00:47:56.952, Speaker A: So, so this really how this harmonic function capture the change in the conformal structure, really, really coming from this imaginary part that the period, okay, okay, now so let's consider the duration energy. So if you have this, so if I have this kind of harmonic function, this kind of functions. And then, so this lives on the universal kafa. And then, now it's defined as the vertices only. But now I can do this piecewise linear extension. So for each triangle I know the value of u, the three vertices. And then, now I can extend it piecewise linearly, I can extend it linearly over the phase.
00:47:56.952 - 00:48:53.674, Speaker A: And then altogether I'll get the, get piecewise linear functions. So I get this function u and then now I can compute the gradient of this u. And it turns out this guy is a piecewise constant function. So it's constant over each phase. But then there's a jump. So if you have one phase, go to another phase, you get a jump. But anyway, we can still compute, we can still define what's the, what is the derivative energy for this function? And then, yeah, and then, okay, and then, okay, so everything, if this, if this thing is well defined on the torus, then we can define this energy, and then in the effect, so, okay, um, yeah, and then by a formula, by pink out and putting, hey, if you start with a function, define at the vertices, and then do you do this peacewise linear extension, and then you do this gradient, and then you compare this energy, then you can express this energy in this form.
00:48:53.674 - 00:49:33.254, Speaker A: So you have this one half times the cotangent rays times the square, this u j minus ui. Okay, and then just observe. So this thing, this term, the quotient way is well defined on the torus. And then this term is well defined on the torus. Actually this whole energy is well defined on the torus. It is independent of the fundamental domain. Okay, so, okay, so actually I can really do this, I can do this integration over a fundamental domain and then I get something independent of which fundamental domain that I pick.
00:49:33.254 - 00:50:32.458, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, so this is important. And then, now, so if I know that this function u is harmonic with conjugate harmonic function u star, then this term can be expressed in this form. Yeah, because if you remember, so this, so yeah, yeah, so how this u, so this, what is the conjugate harmonic function? This, this guy is by definition the one half of this cotangent and then times the difference of U. So, so you can just write, yeah, so this, this term is just one half of this guy times this guy. And then, okay, now what? So this is funny. So what is it? So this is a closed one form and then this is a closed dual one form. And then now you have a one form and then times the dual one form, and then you integrate and then over a fundamental domain.
00:50:32.458 - 00:51:07.224, Speaker A: So now what can you do? You can apply Stokes theorem. You can apply Stokes theorem. So instead of integrating over a fundamental domain, you can just integrate along the boundary. So you have some boundary integral. So if you rearrange. So, okay, you have this fundamental domain is a tall, it's a parallelogram, and then you have two opposite side and then two opposite side. And then if you arrange these two opposite side together, these two opposite side together, then you can express so this, this guy, in terms of the periods of your harmonic functions.
00:51:07.224 - 00:52:01.274, Speaker A: So, as I said, so if you shift your harmonic function from one, from one vertex to the other vertex, then you get shift by constant, and then also get shift by constant. Constant. Get shift by constant. And then what I want to say is, if you have this integration over fundamental to domain, and then now you re arrange your boundary integral, and then now you can express everything in terms of the periods harmonic functions. And then it turns out it is given by this formula. So this formula is not so surprising, because in the smooth theory, you have this Riemann bilinear identity. So if you have two holomorphic one form, and then you just take the kind of the product, and then you do integration, then this product can be expressed by the previous of your holomotic one form.
00:52:01.274 - 00:52:17.562, Speaker A: So this is a Riemann bilinear identity. And then in a discrete case, it's also holes. Okay, so this, okay, this again. So this is the, uh. Yeah, so this is the energy. So if you have, if you have this, uh, harmonic function. Yeah.
00:52:17.562 - 00:52:27.742, Speaker A: Okay, circle patterns, you have this change in holonomy and you can get this kind of harmonic functions. Then when you compute the division energy, you have a very nice expression.
00:52:27.898 - 00:52:28.926, Speaker D: Wayne, I have a question.
00:52:29.070 - 00:52:29.794, Speaker A: Yes.
00:52:30.334 - 00:52:42.870, Speaker D: I mean, is this sort of like the vay Peterson metric on a, you know, like if you take a Riemann surface and you do a little deformation, it's like you have a quadratic differential, and then, and then you get this, you do this integrate, integral, whatever it is.
00:52:43.022 - 00:52:47.790, Speaker A: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. This will be related to the woppy symmetric.
00:52:47.822 - 00:52:49.374, Speaker D: It's like a discrete version.
00:52:49.534 - 00:53:20.858, Speaker A: Yes, yes, absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. Okay, and then, okay, now, okay, now finally we come back to this local homomorphism. So, okay, so now, now we're going to prove it. So, okay, now suppose there exists a first order deformations of my circle pattern that preserve the conformal structure. So that means tau dot is equal to zero. So from our previous discussion, so that means that exists a harmonic function u, the period is in this form.
00:53:20.858 - 00:53:46.374, Speaker A: So now this tau dot is equal to zero. So this PI is gone. So just this guy, this guy. And then the conjugate harmonic function will be this part and this part. And then now you substitute it into this be, which less energy then you have, oh, this expression. So this, the norm square of c dot times the imaginary part of tau. So this is the energy be, which is the energy associated to these deformations.
00:53:46.374 - 00:54:19.360, Speaker A: And then, now the question is, is this energy really achievable by discrete harmonic function? So can you really find such a harmonic function? And then it turns out it is not. You cannot find it. So the reason is the following. Okay, so if this c dot is non zero, then you can consider a smooth harmonic functions on the universal kappa of this c minus zero. So you just take these functions. So you have this log, c log of C. Take c dot divided by c, and then minus I take the real part.
00:54:19.360 - 00:55:17.124, Speaker A: So it looks mysterious. The reason why we pick this is the following. We can pull back this function back to the torus, to the affine torus by the developing map, and then over the affine torus. So if we consider this u dagger, circle gamma, and we look at what is the difference of these two, and then they are exactly differ by a constant, this imaginary part of C dot. So this is the reason why we can't reconstruct in this way. And then if you look at this, go to this gamma two, then you have this constant, and then, and then for this guy, you can also compute what is the derivatives energy. And then it turns out metrically, and then you realize suddenly, so this energy for this smooth harmonic function is equal to this one and then which is equal to your discrete harmonic functions, okay, but then it is impossible.
00:55:17.124 - 00:55:50.268, Speaker A: So the reason is, so, because this u star, u degr, have the same period of u, and then, so this has the same period. So this, this constants are the same as this constant for this, uh, and then, but then we know that this u dagger is a smooth harmonic function. It should be the unique minimizer of the derivatives energy. So it is the unique minimizer you need minimizer. And then this guy is moose. But then this guy, this u is piecewise linear. So definitely they are not equal.
00:55:50.268 - 00:56:20.294, Speaker A: So that means, so this energy must be, so this energy must be larger than this one. So that means, so, so that means, okay, so this energy must be larger than this one. So that means, so, so you cannot, okay, so that means this energy is not achievable by discrete harmonic function. Okay. Okay, so altogether, so that means this c dot must be zero. So if c dot is equal to zero, then so this c dot is equal to zero. C dot is equal to zero.
00:56:20.294 - 00:56:45.872, Speaker A: So that means, so this function u is a harmonic function over a torus. It's a compact torus. So you can apply the maximum principle. Then you can deduce that so this u and then u star must be constant by maximum principle. And so the deformation that you get is trivial. Okay? Yes. And then, okay, finally, so we have, so this, the following statement.
00:56:45.872 - 00:57:20.308, Speaker A: So this PI circle f from p theta to tangerine space is a local hobby morphism for non euclidean affine torus. And then, yeah, so this, everything we're looking at affine Taurus, non Euclidean. So we have this c and tau and altogether, so we have, this thing is a covering map with at most one branch point, the one most branch point and that's branch point maybe at Euclidean torus. So we don't know, we don't know whether it's a branch point. But then the claim is there's no such branch point. So I'm going to tell you. So there's no branch point.
00:57:20.308 - 00:57:55.076, Speaker A: Okay, so this the final slide. So the, so, okay, so there's no branch point at euclidean torus. So the, the way how you prove is by topology. So okay, so what I want to say is, okay, so if you have this circle patterns on a fine tori. So we know that all these circle patterns and also this affine structure are parameterized by the scaling part of the holonomy, a one, a two. So whenever you have this PI circle f, a one, a two, then you get, you get tau. So to map it, you get tau in the tenure space.
00:57:55.076 - 00:58:16.816, Speaker A: And then you can also write this as c tile divided by tau. And then you have this, this, the real part of the holonomy is a one. The imaginary part is this guy. And then for, for gamma one. So this a two. And then you have this kind, okay, so you have this expressions. And then, now what we want to do is we want to show that this part f is a degree one map.
00:58:16.816 - 00:58:50.420, Speaker A: So yeah, it only has one degree. So yeah, so yeah, you cannot if you, okay, so what we are going to do is, okay, so let me just make collocation. So this is my p theta. And then now I know that if I want to get the euclidean torus, so this a one, a two is, they're all equal to zero. And then now I have this projection PI circle f and then I get this tabernacle space tm. And then, so this euclidean tolerance may give me some conformal structure. This is tau zero.
00:58:50.420 - 00:59:38.846, Speaker A: So what I'm going to do is I want to draw a circle here. I want to draw a circle, I want to draw a circle and then I want to show that. So if I have a simple loop on p theta, when I project it, I will also get a simple loop. And then in this way I will make sure this is a, a degree one covering map. So this is homomorphism, okay, so what you need to do, okay, so you consider a loop, uh, you consider a loop here. So just, you just make a loop, okay? And then one thing you should be careful is so this parameter t go from co to PI, because on a fine structure, so this you have to, if you have tau c and then, and then, and then you, as a cp one structure, it will be the same as tau minus c. So, so that means you don't need to go a full one.
00:59:38.846 - 01:00:02.886, Speaker A: So you just get a half, then you will get the same cp one structure. Okay, so if you want to get a simple loop, then you just go from zero to PI. And then, so this is the generator for this p theta. So really fundamental group of this guy. And then, now what you're going to do is, so you have this upper half plane here. So you want to map it to the unitase. And then one observation is so you know that this guy is bounded and then this guy is bounded.
01:00:02.886 - 01:00:28.438, Speaker A: So if you look at this mapping, composition of this mapping, yeah. If you look at the composition of this mapping, then you can see something like this. And then you make this out, goes to, goes to infinite. So make it so large. Then these two terms will be gone. So what is left is this term. So what can we see is the following.
01:00:28.438 - 01:01:00.242, Speaker A: So if t go from co to co to PI, then on P theta I will get a simple loop. And then on the tenure space if I go from co to PI, I will also get a simple loop, I will also get a simple loop. So altogether I know that this mapping is a degree one map. And then, so in conclusion, so we know that it is a homomorphism. Okay, so this proof is due to tangy rule. So I learned it from him. Okay, so finally there's some pictures, some elements of P theta.
01:01:00.242 - 01:01:21.690, Speaker A: So yeah, so these are circumventers on affine torus and then some more pictures. Okay, okay, I know that this talk is pretty heavy, but anyway, so I, anyway, good discretization means it's rich in manual structures. Thank you very much for your attention. So thank you, wei, very nice talk.
01:01:21.842 - 01:01:24.654, Speaker C: And I'll open up the floor to questions.
01:01:26.164 - 01:01:27.980, Speaker B: Do you have a paper on this?
01:01:28.172 - 01:01:31.104, Speaker A: Yes. Yes. Yes. Ok. Here, this one.
01:01:32.284 - 01:01:38.964, Speaker B: Oh, there it is. Sorry, I didn't see it. Yeah, nice talk. I got to go teach.
01:01:39.124 - 01:01:48.184, Speaker A: Yeah. The good thing about this talk, I think everything is on YouTube so you can check it out. Yes.
01:01:48.924 - 01:01:50.060, Speaker C: Yeah. Question.
01:01:50.252 - 01:01:51.396, Speaker A: Yes. Tan.
01:01:51.580 - 01:02:02.844, Speaker C: Yeah. So the tan work, they talked about the double cover and so that's where the projective versus the affine structure comes in, right?
01:02:02.964 - 01:02:07.420, Speaker A: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So if you stick to cp one structure, you don't have this two to one.
01:02:07.612 - 01:02:58.954, Speaker C: Yeah. What I thought was of interest in the affine tori was sort of figuring out for a given combinatorics where that branch point occurred. Because if you have a symmetric torus sort of where you can interchange the two generators combinatorially, then there's sort of a natural point where you see the branching occur in the covering mat. And so it was interesting though if it's not a symmetrical thing, to sort of figure out where that, that branching occurs. In other words, where the flip between zero and infinity sort of coalesces at a single point.
01:03:02.054 - 01:03:12.282, Speaker A: Yeah. But it's probably related to euclidean torus. Yeah. It's the euclidean torque that you will.
01:03:12.298 - 01:03:46.644, Speaker C: Get also with regard to Phil's question about the patch at the local chart at a vertex. So in general you get a Riemann a conformal structure, whether or not things close up at that point you get sort of metrically cone points. But in terms of conformal structure that's fine. So you could put a branch structure in.
01:03:47.064 - 01:03:47.560, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:47.632 - 01:03:58.284, Speaker C: And so for example, you could put some branch points and consider modeling the virus stress function on your torus.
01:03:58.584 - 01:03:59.224, Speaker A: Yes.
01:03:59.344 - 01:04:01.524, Speaker C: And I wonder if you've considered this.
01:04:02.594 - 01:04:19.610, Speaker A: Yeah. So the thing is, if you have some close rimland surface and then you remove some points, and then if you look at the CP one structure, so that one, that space is huge infinitely, the dimension is infinite. And then. And then. So. Yeah. So I think.
01:04:19.610 - 01:04:32.416, Speaker A: I don't know. So usually. I don't know. So I think there should be some work categorizing what kind of cpu structure that will really arise from these circle patterns. I think. Yeah. Somehow I also don't know.
01:04:32.570 - 01:04:33.304, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:04:34.044 - 01:04:34.444, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:34.484 - 01:04:52.464, Speaker C: Well, I wish Phil were still here. I don't know if he can hear us, but he's going to class apparently. But yeah. These filling in these branch points. So you get infinitely many structures, I think, because you have sort of cusps yes. That you can put at those points.
01:04:52.764 - 01:04:53.544, Speaker A: Yes.
01:04:54.484 - 01:05:02.378, Speaker C: But then if you put particular branch structures there, you cut down the number of these.
01:05:02.426 - 01:05:04.934, Speaker A: Yeah, you can. Yeah.
01:05:05.474 - 01:05:29.134, Speaker C: And so the question is whether you can start getting cp structures from the torus as sort of mapping to other domains with this branch structure. I'm not sure how to formulate this right, but I just think that the branch structure, introducing a branch structure might be interesting here.
01:05:29.294 - 01:05:41.374, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so. Will be interesting that. So instead of saying this is the holonomy is identity. So you just prescribe. The holonomy is something else. You just prescribe the holonomy. I want each vertex.
01:05:41.374 - 01:06:02.194, Speaker A: So if you say a branch. So you just prescribe what is a holonomy? And then you look at what is this equation. So I think maybe it is a good starting point. Yeah. But I don't know, it seems quite difficult because even with, for this no bench point, I think it's already difficult enough. Elias has his hand up.
01:06:04.374 - 01:06:11.594, Speaker E: Let me say first that I'm impressed by the beauty of your formulas. And this indicates that you have the right setting.
01:06:12.054 - 01:06:13.194, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you.
01:06:15.014 - 01:06:47.304, Speaker E: This thing about conjugate harmonic functions, this is related to a problem which we were trying to solve some ten years ago, namely to find a discrete analog of the Hilbert transform. The difference is that we were working with packings inside the disk, say maximum packing. And we would like to find the conjugate function just from boundary information.
01:06:48.284 - 01:06:48.804, Speaker A: Yes.
01:06:48.884 - 01:07:39.864, Speaker E: Okay, so you can, for instance, you can take the radii. Then they model the function u by radii or by differentials of the radii. And then you get the function u star from the angles, more or less. And what we got is something which approximates the Hilbert transform. But it did not really have these nice properties. So for instance, the square is not the negative, but we were just working with the packing alone and not with this pattern. So you have this conjugate packing.
01:07:39.864 - 01:07:55.284, Speaker E: And this may be the right approach also to consider things like the Hilbert transform. Yeah, we are not working on affine drawers, but say in a disk and look at boundary I use.
01:07:55.744 - 01:08:17.376, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I want to say that. So if you have this circle packing and then you look at the change of radii. So you can also see this is a harmonic function. And then I think, I'm pretty sure this is not surprising to Ken because I just read the, that formula from, from Ken's book. And then. So you can also get this harmonic functions graph Laplacian on circle packing. But then I think.
01:08:17.376 - 01:08:43.775, Speaker A: So one main difference between this death harmonic, that graph Laplacean to the quotient is this property. So when you compute the division's energy. So then you can express very nicely in the. In terms of the potential potassium. But then if you consider the guavla patient on circle packing. Yeah, I don't know. So I don't know whether you have this nice expression.
01:08:43.959 - 01:08:51.727, Speaker E: Yeah. This formula on the bottom of this slide is also a wonderful thing. Thank you so much.
01:08:51.855 - 01:08:52.135, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:08:52.159 - 01:09:17.520, Speaker A: This is the magic of cotangent, of circle packing. Maybe, I think circle packing, there should be a formula like this. But I've never seen this. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Any other questions? Yes, Wayne?
01:09:17.592 - 01:09:23.204, Speaker D: Could I just see the picture, some of those pictures at the end. And where's the. Where's the taurus?
01:09:23.744 - 01:09:24.464, Speaker A: Oh, this.
01:09:24.584 - 01:09:30.541, Speaker D: No, next one. I mean, that one, of course. Yeah, I know that. Oh, I see. So. I see. So they're identified, like.
01:09:30.637 - 01:09:31.393, Speaker A: Okay.
01:09:32.173 - 01:09:32.485, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:09:32.509 - 01:09:41.113, Speaker A: Mobile transformations. Gotcha. Yes. Yeah, I hope you like it. Rich, I have talked to you about this for. For many hours.
01:09:41.853 - 01:09:42.565, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:09:42.709 - 01:09:46.165, Speaker A: If you remember, I also always went to your office to talk about this.
01:09:46.229 - 01:09:46.893, Speaker D: I remember.
01:09:47.013 - 01:09:48.781, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.
01:09:48.917 - 01:09:51.433, Speaker D: I don't think you had the cotangent Laplacian.
01:09:53.213 - 01:09:53.993, Speaker A: What?
01:09:54.173 - 01:09:57.026, Speaker D: I don't. I don't think you had the cotangent Laplacian.
01:09:57.170 - 01:10:03.570, Speaker A: I had, but I've never told you. Yeah, yeah, I had, but. Yeah.
01:10:03.602 - 01:10:04.274, Speaker D: You didn't tell me.
01:10:04.314 - 01:10:06.774, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I did. I didn't tell you.
01:10:09.394 - 01:10:11.054, Speaker D: That's really good. Yeah.
01:10:11.874 - 01:10:12.734, Speaker A: Thanks.
01:10:13.994 - 01:10:26.204, Speaker D: It's a surprisingly subtle. Like, it was sort of funny. I mean, the final contradiction is really subtle. I thought you were just going to say, well, this has non zero energy, so it's. No, not trivial. I mean.
01:10:27.864 - 01:10:29.176, Speaker A: Yeah, not quite. Yeah.
01:10:29.320 - 01:10:30.768, Speaker D: That was kind of surprising.
01:10:30.936 - 01:10:37.256, Speaker A: Yeah. This. This part. I. I stick to this part for a long time. So I. When I went to your office, I always have this question in my.
01:10:37.256 - 01:10:41.724, Speaker A: How to prove this. Yeah.
01:10:42.224 - 01:10:46.044, Speaker D: This result is more recent. I mean, how recent is the.
01:10:47.264 - 01:10:51.744, Speaker A: Almost, I think, after I left Bran. So I think on the way. On the way to Luxembourg.
