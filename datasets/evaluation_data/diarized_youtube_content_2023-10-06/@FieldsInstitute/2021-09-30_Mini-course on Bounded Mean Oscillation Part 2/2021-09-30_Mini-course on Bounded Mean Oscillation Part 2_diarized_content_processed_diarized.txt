00:00:00.240 - 00:00:08.674, Speaker A: Everybody, welcome to the second lecture of Daniel on BMO. Please.
00:00:09.854 - 00:01:03.020, Speaker B: Okay, thanks a lot. Well, first of all, I already uploaded in the chat the transparencies, revised version of the transparencies. And also I uploaded this paper that I wrote 20 years ago on vmos where you can find the proofs that I'm not going to speak about. And yesterday we finished the talk. When we were finishing the talk, we started speaking about the duality theory. You remember that we said that we know that for p between one and infinity, the dual of Hp can be identified with Hq, where q is a conjugate exponent. But this is no longer true for p one.
00:01:03.020 - 00:01:49.124, Speaker B: The dual of h one is not h infinity. BMOA shows up here. The dual of h one can be identified with BMoA analytic bmo and this is the so called Fefferman duality theorem. The precise statement is this. We have a function in bmo and function f in bmo and function g in h one. Then we can say that this limit, the limit of Sar, tends to one of the integral over the torus of the conjugate of f times g r eta exists. And then if we define for any g for any f in Bmo, we define tfg as this limit.
00:01:49.124 - 00:02:50.950, Speaker B: Then this tf is a bounded linear functional in h one. And actually the nor of this functional is comparable to the Bmo node of f. And conversely, any element of the dual of h one is of this four for Sangrev in the this is the Feverman duality theory, and I'm going to sketch a little bit the proof maybe. So let's see. Maybe let's start with what I say, the ac path. If we have a function in h in the dual a functional in the dual fh one, then we just use the Hambanach theorem to extend it to a function in l one. Since we know that l one, the dual of l one, is at infinity, then we obtain a function b in an infinity, so that tg is the integral over the torus of the conjugate of b times s.
00:02:50.950 - 00:03:45.104, Speaker B: Once that we have this, one has to do a little bit of work, and then we can prove it's not very difficult, actually more or less standard that t is going to be tf for a certain function f, which is of the four f one plus if two, where f one and f two are analytic indeed, and have bound the real part, since they have bound the real part. This function is in Dmo. So more or less this is basic. I will not get into the test. But maybe the more difficult part is the other implication. I'm going to present the proof, which is maybe not the most known proof, for instance, is different from the one that I presented in this, in this manuscript that I have uploaded. And this follows the.
00:03:45.104 - 00:05:08.910, Speaker B: Well, let me start recording something which we are going to need in the proof, which is the so called Hardy Stein identities, hardest time identities. While this is an expression of the hp normal of a function, in terms of the integral of this function over the period when p two, this reduces to the well known little pale identity. But for other values of p we have, this is a classical result, and actually it's not difficult to obtain. We just have to take the derivative with respect to error of the integrals mean for the p, and then more or less find out this anish not this equal to ten. And actually we are going to be interested in this hardy strain inequality identity for the case p one. So for the base p one, the identity that we are going to use is that the h one norm of a function f is essentially this, the integral over the list of the jacobian of f prime squared over the absolute value of f times log one over one minus. So this is one of the ingredients that we are going to use in the proof.
00:05:08.910 - 00:06:19.610, Speaker B: So I prefer to state it in the beginning. And let's see, more or less how goes the proof. We are going to use an approach by ness in a paper in the bull of London Mathematical Society, 1983. Maybe this is not the most standard way to prove this theory. And then actually what he proved is that using the harmonicity of the function log of absolute value of f squared, and we have an epsilon, a positive epsilon and green theorem, then we obtain a lemma which is due to uchijama, and this lemma due to uchijama is the first. If we, if we have a real value function which is of class two in the closed this and actually it's analytic, then if we integrate in the torus the absolute value of f times e to the raised to the power to f to five. Sorry, this is bigger than the Laplacian of phi times e to the phi times e.
00:06:19.610 - 00:07:23.650, Speaker B: And this is just a computation using the, using the, using Green's theorem and using the fact that this function log of mod f squared is a super harmonic function, and using this lemma, then we can, this is the basic result to obtain what I'm going to call the basic result for validity. The basic result for validity. Notice we have a function f in bmo a and a function h in h one. Then we can, we can obtain this one for the integral over d of the mod of f prime squared times the absolute value of f times the log of one over models, this is bounded by a constant which is e times the h node. The h one norm of phase times the bmo node of the function. So this is, this is the, what I call the basic duality result. And this is a consequence of the uchijama lemma.
00:07:23.650 - 00:08:23.598, Speaker B: And let's see, more or less, it's easy to obtain the residuality result, because what we did, we take this function f in bmo and this function h in h one, and then we construct this new function. We, we have the model f squared, and here we take the poisson integral of the function whose boundary values is mod of f squared, and then we divide by the naught. Then, trivially, this is, this is non positive, because this is a measurement of this and is bounded below by one. And a computation shows that the laplacian of phi is four times the model of f prime squared over the Bmr norm of f squared. Since this is positive, the Laplacian is positive. We have here this is positive. So we have that phi is harmonic.
00:08:23.598 - 00:09:05.990, Speaker B: Then using the harmonicity and the fat that is bounded below ion, we get that and we use the, the lemma, the previous lemma, the lemma that we had before. Then we have that the h one naught of f is bigger than this, simply because this is bigger, since this is non positive, this is more than one. So this inequality is trivial. And now, and now we use the lemma, the dilemma uchijama. Then we use here, and we obtain this inequality. And then, coming from here to here, this just to write things appropriately. And so we get a lemma.
00:09:05.990 - 00:09:37.456, Speaker B: This is what we call the basic lemma. So let's see, something happened here. This was, this is a stuck, let me see, this happened also yesterday. Let me see if I can, if I can get this again. Let's, yeah. Okay, so, so this is the dilemma that we basically solve. The integral of mod f prime squared times h.
00:09:37.456 - 00:10:19.620, Speaker B: The absolute value times this log is bounded by the h no h, one naught of f times the bm of big f. This is the basic. And then let's see how, how do we obtain the value? Well, the first thing we use the little pale identities, which can, this can be obtained either using green theorem or just using parseval identity. See, we have two functions, f and h in h two. And then, well, I have subtracted here f of theorem, al baby. Later on I forget about f of zero and I might think that f of zero equals zero. But anyway, this is simply the parseval identities.
00:10:19.620 - 00:10:56.016, Speaker B: Or if you prefer the by green theorem, we get this little with Paley inequality. Then using this, what I call the basic result for duality, because the inequality, what we guess is this. If we start with a function, this function, the big f is in bmo, h is in h one. Then we use this, let's forget about the f of zero and g of zero. So then we use this. From this we obtain this. And then we use, we just put absolute value inside.
00:10:56.016 - 00:12:05.344, Speaker B: And from here to here we simply use the Cochise first inequality, Cauchy Schwarz inequality. Writing this as h prime to the one half, times h prime to the one half, the one half to squared comes here and the other one comes here. So then what we get is the test that we have here is by the hardest thing, inequality that I stated in the beginning is marginalized by the h one of h. So we get this result, we put this and this together, and this gives the Bmo of f times the h one naught of h. This is what we wanted to. So we have proved the basis, what I call the basic result of the basic result that we have here about duality, which is this. Okay, but then, using the perceiver identity, then what we get is.
00:12:05.344 - 00:12:59.384, Speaker B: But now that once that we have obtain this for a function f in bmo and a function g in h two, then this is easy, because what we do, if we take a function f instead of being in h two, we take it, instead of being in h two, we take, we take, sorry, this here is a misprint. What I mean is that the function f is in bmo and the function g, we take the function g in h one. Then if we take the function g in h one, we approximate it by the function g, sub r of cell, which is g of r. We apply the previous lemma, and then we get this approximation. And then in this way we get the result that we wanted, that the limit before x. So. So using this, we get this.
00:12:59.384 - 00:13:55.474, Speaker B: Let's some remarks. The limit that we have said that it exists in the theory can be written, of course, in terms of the Taylor coefficient. If the function f is the sum of ancn and g is the sign of p and c n, then this limit is simply the limit of am bar bm times r. This is the first remark that I want to say, because, and the second remark is that the duality theorem says that this limit exists. But what if f is in bmo and g is in h one? I should remark that one could think that this integral actually converges. Or if you prefer, that this is, uh, this series converges. But this is not true.
00:13:55.474 - 00:14:36.420, Speaker B: This integral may not be converged, for effect is in bmo and g is in h one. Okay, so. So, actually, they. You remember that when we were speaking on hardware spaces, the dual of hp was hq and the duality padding was the integral of f times g. But actually, the integral of f times g I theta when r equal one. If we put r equal one here, this integral may not come back. Okay, this can be proved using, I don't know, closure of theorem.
00:14:36.420 - 00:15:20.064, Speaker B: But actually, it's possible to give an explicit example. Let's see. Example could be, if we take, let's say the simpler Dmo function will take this. This is mbmo. Maybe we can place as g. Let's see, if I take one minus z, and then I put here log of, say, two over one minus z squared, this function g is in h one. Sorry.
00:15:20.064 - 00:16:14.588, Speaker B: And for this function, one can more or less. I think it's not difficult to prove that if we take this integral fe I theta times g, e I theta. This integral does not understand. Okay, so, actually, the theorem says it's precise, and we cannot substitute this limit as hard as to un by the integral over the boundary. Okay, let's see. Let's come back here. Okay, let's go back to the, what I called the basic result for validity.
00:16:14.588 - 00:17:22.224, Speaker B: The basic result for validity, that what I call basic result for validity was that if we have a function f in bmo and a function h in h one, then we have that this integral is bounded by the product of the h one naught of f h and the Bmo. Not often. But let us look at to this inequality in this way. Consider the measure v mu of z equal log of one over absolute value of z times f prime of z squared da z. So this thing here, the f prime squared, and then this much. So, if we take a look at this, and then this inequality here can be seen in the follow up way that if we take any function h in h one, if we integrate h against this measure, then we get something which is finite. So this means that h one is contained in l one of d with.
00:17:22.224 - 00:18:00.950, Speaker B: And then we use the. If we use calison theory, we know that this inclusion holds if and only the measure is a carnation measure. Well, I guess I haven't defined where, what colors of measure is. But you know, you all know what colors of measure is. Okay, if we have a disk. I think that Nicolas Salmockes spoke yesterday about. If you have this, you have any interval I, and then you take the calison box, the calcium box.
00:18:00.950 - 00:18:27.354, Speaker B: I mean, that this length is comparable to the left of I. A measure, a positive measure in the wrist is a galoshone measure. We call this the Galison box. Let's say call it. This is si. Mu secalization measure means that mu of Si is smaller than the measure of phi for the absolute constant for any I in depth. So.
00:18:27.354 - 00:19:31.344, Speaker B: So, and then what we have, if we use Galison theorem, Calison invariant theorem, since we have that, that effect is in BMO, we have this inclusion, then this means that this measure is a careless. But now recall that log of one over an absolute value of z is comparable with one minus mod c squared as mod set tends to one. So, using this, what we get is that if is in VMO, then this measure, we can start with this logarithmic term by one minus mod c squared is a calculus. So we got this. If we use the duality theorem, we get the conversion. So, actually, what we have is that the function f is in bmo. A if and only the measure one minus mod c squared times absolute value of f prime of z squared DSL is equal.
00:19:31.344 - 00:20:35.166, Speaker B: Well, there is. I was very fast in, let's say, what I call the easy part of the duality theory. But I said that in the proof, what we did is, actually, we proved that the function f was in BMO could be written in this part. So, actually, if one uses the duality theory and look at the proof or the first part, then actually, what we obtain also that the function a function which is analytic in the list is in BMO, if only it can be written as f one plus if two with f one or f two with positive. So, more or less. This is an idea of the proof of the Fefferman's quality here. Well, I'm going to speak very quickly about VmO and VmoA.
00:20:35.166 - 00:21:38.140, Speaker B: I guess that Nicholas here, charm, spoke a little bit about them yesterday. I'm just going to define them, and I don't want to say much. Vmo and VmoA are the little old version of Vmo and vmoa. So, a function f, which is in BMo, is in VMo. V comes from vanishing minus. In addition, if BMO was at the supreme overloading or interval of these oscillations, was one so vm vanishing being oscillation means that if we take the limit as the length of I tends to zero, this oscillation that limits is c. And in a similar way, when we go to the analytic BMO space, recall that one of the characterization of BMO was that the family of the composition of f with all the conformal mappings of the disease into its cell.
00:21:38.140 - 00:22:39.910, Speaker B: And we should try the value of f of a, that this was a bounded subset in Hp. Well, if we substitute this being bounded by the limit as absolute value of a, then we get what we call Vmo, analytic vanishing mineral synthesis. Vmo is a closer space of Vmo, and actually it is the closer of the polynomials in Vmoa. Nicholas Salmon told us that Vmo was cytosol through the function f in vmoa is in Vmoa. If and only when we compose her inside with rotation, then we let that rotation tends to the identity that composition tends to. And this was solved by Sarasota. And in many ways, Bmoa plays the role with respect to Bmo as the little block space.
00:22:39.910 - 00:23:26.484, Speaker B: Play the role with respect to the little block space. Is the a function uses the literal space, is the limit as mod set tends to one of one minus mod c squared times the absolute value of f prime of z tends to zero. In the same way, the little block space is the closure of the polynomials in the block mode. And actually we have that this algebra is contained in VMOA and contained in the literal. I should say that the Featherman's duality theory that I stated that the dual of h one is BMO, can be complemented, saying that the dual of Vm is h. But I'm not going to get into detail. Let's see.
00:23:26.484 - 00:25:07.482, Speaker B: And then, now that we have more or less studied a little bit, the species BMOA, and we have approved it, two basic results that I said that are the connection of BMO with analytic functions, so that they substitute on the embryonic conjugation theorem for equal infinity. On this theorem, then what we try to do is to study a little bit the structure of the space. Well, whenever we have a space of analytic functions, one of the things that we try to do is to know a little bit, to know what are the setups, the zeros of function in this space, what are some operators on this space, and so on. If you remember, when we, in some of the courses that were given in this program, there was a course in Birmingham spaces, there was a course in this space. In those courses, you remember that one of the section was studying the zeros of functioning in other species. In both cases, the set of zeros were not the Vlascus sequence were different from the Vlasc sequence. However, if we can hear with VmO, what do we have here? We know that contains h infinity and is contained in all hardest places hp with p equal infinity.
00:25:07.482 - 00:26:06.224, Speaker B: Since the zero set of h infinity are the last case sequence are the zero set of any hard space p, where p is equal to infinity, is smaller than infinity, then what we have is that the zero sets of PmO are the Velasquez system. So in this case there is no difference with the serious set of cardio. And of course, any blast product is a member of BMO. It's a bounded analytic function. So any blascam one can prove, one can prove that the BMO. Note, if we take the conformal invariant of any blast, then one can compute it. And actually it's always, well, if we forget f of zero, all the blascap products have vm or not equal to one plus zero.
00:26:06.224 - 00:26:46.836, Speaker B: But this works when p is smaller than two. When p is actually, we have written here this for blasket product. Actually this can be extended, and it is. This is true for any inner function. If we have an inner function in a function, we call that this h infinity norm, whose boundary values have absolute value equal to one almost everywhere. For any inner function, we can prove that the vm of that inner function is exactly. But this works only for p smaller than or equal to two.
00:26:46.836 - 00:27:40.524, Speaker B: And I think that in June, I don't know, in June, July, stamatis polyasis gave a talk, I think, and he made a conjecture and that conjecture. And he was able to prove with the BMo ap, nor for p smaller than two. The question for p bigger than two was open. He conjectured a bit, but it's open. And then, I don't know, he, we spoke a little bit and I told him, there are a lot of questions in BMo where the things change when we consider this not for p smaller than two and for p bigger than two. Actually, this is one of those. If we, this is all that I write here is for p smaller than two.
00:27:40.524 - 00:28:48.264, Speaker B: But if we go for p bigger than two, the result is not true, because actually what we can is true, and it is not difficult to prove, is that we take large values of p. Then this Bmo, the conformal invariant p naught of I, is equal to this plus two when p is in the limit. In the limit when p this is trusova. This is one of those examples of questions we have to do with PMO work, and things are different. If we consider the conformal invariant norm corresponding to p two or to p bigger than two. We will find some other examples of this situation later. So the question about the series of functioning in Vmo is completely solved are simply, of course, all the blasc products are in Bmo.
00:28:48.264 - 00:29:37.806, Speaker B: However, if we consider Vmo, the vanishing venous relations, what happens is that only the final blasker product line, Vmoa, of course, any final blascker product belongs to Vmo, because final blasphemy in the disk algebra is continuous in the closed unit disk, but they are the only one. Actually, it's true, because if we have an infinite blascke product and these are the zeros of the blascare product, then we take b and we compose with the and we subtract. This is zero. So this is simply this. But if we compose a blasphemy with this, this is again an inner function. So the hp is. And then this 10th one.
00:29:37.806 - 00:30:13.056, Speaker B: So actually, so and so this does not tend to zero. If this does not tend to zero. So the. So we have that the product is not in the end. So the finite blascular product are the only one in Vm. Actually, this can be extended and saying that finite blascular product are the only in a function in Vm. What we need to use here is that if we have a non constant inner function, then it takes values arbitrarily small.
00:30:13.056 - 00:31:05.352, Speaker B: And so then using this, an argument more or less like this, then we can extend this result, considering not blascular products, but inner function defined. Blascular products are the only inner function which lies in. Anyway, there is some difference. I said that VMO and the litter block and the little blockage play a role similar. The relation between block and the literal block space and BMO and VMOA are very closely related. But I should remark that this result for the little rocket space is not true. Actually, it's a famous result of some that there are infinite blascke products in the litter block space.
00:31:05.352 - 00:31:40.788, Speaker B: So here we have a defense in the litter, while in VMOA we don't have any infinite blascular bladder. This is not true for the little block spreading. There are infinite blascia bladder in the literal blocks. Okay, so let's see. Well, let's speak a little bit about multiplayer. I have said that any blast product is in BMO because h infinity is contained in BMO. But what happens if we, let's start with this question.
00:31:40.788 - 00:32:42.516, Speaker B: What happens if we have a function in BMO and we multiply it by Ella's Kepler? Can we say something? Well, we can speak a little bit more, generally speaking, about multipliers. Well, this definition, you are not the definition. You have a Banach space analytic function. I'm not going to say, but whenever I say that x is a one expressive analytic function, I'm going to assume that is continuously embedded in the space for polymorphic function, I mean that convergence in node implies uniform convergence encompass. And I always will also assume that x contains all the polynomials, so that we don't get a trivial thing. So if we have a minor space of analytic function, a function analytic in the disk is going to set to be a multiplied. I could say point wise multiplied, because as you know, we can speak also of Kalaman multiplied.
00:32:42.516 - 00:33:53.034, Speaker B: So let's say point wise multiplies. If whenever we have a function g in x, the product fails and the space of four multipliers is usually denoted by x is something quite a standard that the space multipliers of a Vanah space, a Vanahe space satisfying those conditions that I have said that contains all the polynomials and is continually embedded in the space of automatic function in the disease. But for any space we have the multiplier, the space and multipliers is contained in native. And I think that in the courses given previously regarding hard spaces at Berman space, this question was considered over there. It was said that the multipliers of any hard space of also any of the Birdman spaces AP Alpha is exactly agency. And then we can think about BMO. This is what I said in the beginning.
00:33:53.034 - 00:34:38.633, Speaker B: More than considering the general question, let's start with Blazke Brother. We know that all Velasquez products lie in BMO. But if we multiply a function in BMO, my Vlasca brother, can we say something? But the thing is that we cannot say it. Let's work with a typical example of a BMO function, the function log of one over one minus. And let's try a quite simple product, the lacquer product, which have zeros at one minus two to the minus eight. So this is exponential sequence. So the Lasker product to zero six, which is an exponential.
00:34:38.633 - 00:35:17.070, Speaker B: And then we consider the product of b times the logos. So this function is with BMO. This is a blascke product. However, the product is not in BMO. Actually, it's not a block function. Why is this? This is easy, because since this is exponential sequence it is uniformly separated. I'm not going to explain it, but uniformly separated means that this, there exists a positive delta such that one minus a squared b prime of a n is bigger than the follow.
00:35:17.070 - 00:35:50.060, Speaker B: And then it's just a computation. If we take here, we take the derivative, the derivative of this times, this is b prime times log, b prime times log. But the other third that we get when we apply the rule for the product is v nan times the derivative of it. But since b of a n is zero, then the third disappear. So what we have is it. But since we have that this is bigger than the product of this times, this is bigger than delta. So this test is finished.
00:35:50.060 - 00:36:33.394, Speaker B: So in this way, we get that this is not a fast, actually, the idea here, the idea here, this idea, I guess, goes back to Lapan in the 1960s. The idea here can be generalized. And actually, one can prove easily the follow that if we have a function, any function f analytic in the distance, and which is not bounded, then we can find any interpolating blast. Interpolating blascular Prada means, I'm not going to get into detail. This has to do with the problem of carnation interpolation. But let's say in interpolating plascar Prada, this one will satisfy it. Maybe we can.
00:36:33.394 - 00:37:37.948, Speaker B: Okay, there exists an interpolated in brascare product such that the product of b times f is not a blood transfer. So unfortunately, with this kind of idea, one can prove that this. Okay, for some times. Well, I guess that the explicit examples of function in BMO, so that multiplying by a certain function is not in BMO. I guess the more simple example that I knew were of this kind, and actually an interpolate product times a function. Actually, I guess a couple of years ago or so, I think Joe Simmer sent me a message asking if we can do something similar. He was interested in something he needed the, he needed to estimate the product of a certain bmf function with a singular linear function, the one point in singular function.
00:37:37.948 - 00:38:37.584, Speaker B: And he asked me if I knew what can be said. I was thinking a little bit, and then I was able to prove that if we have the singular inner function with point mass here, so the s of, say, equal the exponential of minus one plus z over one minus z, and we take any function and we satisfy this form, and this is a, let's say that the function log of one over one minus s satisfy, of course, these two conditions. So, if we take the product of this function log of one over one minus eight times this singular inert function. Then we get also that this function is not log. So we have two kind of examples. Two kind of examples we have in the first example is interpolating blascma function, which is not abnormal function. And in this case, what we have is this singular inert function times abm function, which is not.
00:38:37.584 - 00:39:22.520, Speaker B: Maybe this is a result that I proved in collaboration with two colleagues from Malaga, Joseph and Christopher ronfal. Maybe this is a little bit not surprising, because here is a construction of the same kind that we have a blasca brother. But here we don't ask the blascada to be interpolated. The only thing that we ask is that the series is containing. In the ray, we take a function g, so that g of set tends to infinity as set to one. For instance, g can be again the function log of, of one over one minus f. Then in this situation, the product of b times g is not in vivo.
00:39:22.520 - 00:40:09.012, Speaker B: Actually, one can prove that it's not a block. Well, I should say a little bit. The example, the preceding example, this one and the ones, and the one involving the interpolating blascare product, we can prove something stronger than this. We can prove that dysfunction big f is not a normal function. But I know, I prefer not to introduce it and just say here. However, here in this theory, we are not able to prove that this product is not normal function. We simply prove in this case that we will have a blascke product with serious inner values, and an analytic function like this, which tends to infinity as we go to one.
00:40:09.012 - 00:41:00.074, Speaker B: This product is not. So, let's see anyway, we have obtained a number, a number of examples of functions which are blascked, or the singular inner function, so that they are not multiplies of Bm. But all these examples are, as I have said, either blascar product or either this singular intervention. They are, let's say, bar behave in the boundary. Okay, so this example that I have given so far are somewhat boundary of the boundary. They have some singularity. Either there is some sequence of zeros, which of course tends to the boundary, or this singular in the point mass inner function also has some similarity in the boundary.
00:41:00.074 - 00:42:15.624, Speaker B: What happens if we consider regular h infinity functions? Let's say we consider analytic function, which is in the design. Can we say something? Well, in the positive sense, we can say something. If we have, for instance, some function which has in the class lambda alpha. Let's say lambda alpha means that if it's analytic in the disk, say, continues in the closed unit disk, and so that the boundary values satisfy a Leipzig condition of algorithm alpha, or you prefer if it is in the mean ellipses space, lambda p alpha. This means that f is in HP and the modules continue to afford p satisfies that is satisfied a certain growth. So if we have this, maybe forget about this, if we, if we have some function in this lambda alpha. If one uses the characterization of GMO in terms of colors of measure that I gave a few minutes ago, then it is easy to prove that actually this function in this space are multiplied.
00:42:15.624 - 00:43:31.142, Speaker B: But let's see then, once that we notice this, then we try to see we have some not so much regularities, something a little bit less regular. Then I thought, what can we say? We consider lambda one? One lambda eleven is the space of an expansion so that f prime is in a sun, or even some space which is even smaller than this, the minimal, the minimal space we want. This is the space of expansion analytic in the list so that the second derivative is in the vermin space expansion so that the integral over the list of the absolute value of the second derivative of f is finite. This is a very small space. This is the minimalist space which is called minical because it is the minimal conformally invariant space among all the spaces of analytic function in the list which are conformally invariant. This is while, let's say natural, which has natural. This is the smallest one, the block function is the biggest one, and this is the smallest one.
00:43:31.142 - 00:44:33.216, Speaker B: So this is a very small. Then we were seeing. And then the question which came to my mind is, can we say if we have a function here, or maybe even here, can we say that it is multiplied of the space just as what happens with this function in this ellipse patient? Actually, the question, the answer was negative. Actually, we, I guess one year ago or so, I was able to prove that if we have a function which is a block function, a non bounded block function, then we can take a function which is in this minimal space, this minimal space, such that the product f times d is not so. In particular, these smaller minimalist basis contains a function which are known. But these are, let's say, constructive example. Anyway, what I should say is that the characterization of the multipliers of the Mo is known.
00:44:33.216 - 00:45:31.320, Speaker B: And I guess it was first obtained by Orthegan Fabrika. This is catalyst. And the thing is that the function g analytic in the list is a multiplied if only g is in h infinity. We know that a multiplier of BmoA has to be in h infinity in general, for any space x, the multiplies of x are containing h infinity, but it has to satisfy also this extra condition. So this is the character. I'm not going to get into the proof, but the thing is that anyway, this condition is not so completely easy to check on concrete examples. So, over the years that we have been working on seeing special classes of functions, so that we can say, and we have obtained a number of results like this, more or less in the negative, in the negative way, and someone with the positive one.
00:45:31.320 - 00:46:11.374, Speaker B: Okay, let's see. Well, let's see. I have said that the blasket product for our inner function are not, in general, are not multipliers. There are blasphemous, which are not multiplied. So BMO does not behave well when we multiply by a blascadas. However, we can think not about multiplying a function by elastic pattern, but dividing. And the thing is that blascare products are good devices of BMO.
00:46:11.374 - 00:47:41.374, Speaker B: Let me explain a little bit and introduce a little bit the terminology. In general, if we have a space x of h one, space x of h one, the terminology is the following is said to have the property of division by inner function is also the f property. If whenever we have a function, whenever we have a function f in x and I in a function, so that when we divide f by I, we add in h one, then actually we lie in x. So when this happens, we say, and when this happens, always for any inner function with this property, we say that f has the property of division by inner function. So let's say that if a function can be divided by inner function within a h one, then it can be divided by that inner function within x. And while the space is the hard h one or the hardest space is h two, of course, have this property, and there are a lot of spaces which have this property. And in fact, it is possible to prove that BMO and VMO have the property, and even a stronger one, that I'm not going to speak about one, which is called the k property.
00:47:41.374 - 00:48:32.754, Speaker B: But I notice, and this can be proven in several ways, it can be proved using duality, using the, the nor, the conformal invariant, nor, and so on. This is not difficult to prove, but I should mention that BmO and Bmo, however, since I said that there is a close relation between BMO and the block space, and vmo and the little block space, I should emphasize that. What happened with the block space? Well, I said before that Sarasota proved that there are infinite blasc in v zero. Then using that is relatively easy to prove that if we consider b zero, b zero. Well, b. Notice Bmo and Bmo, of course, are savage spaces of h one. B, the little block space, is not.
00:48:32.754 - 00:49:26.254, Speaker B: So, if we want to speak about this property of division by inner function, we have to consider the intersection with something. So, let's take the intersection of v zero with h. So, the intersection of enol with h infinity does not have the f property. Let's say this is cc. As I said, this is an easy consequence of the result by Saran. So we have a b, an infinite blast product in B, not then. And then take an as subsequent of the sequence of the sequence of silos, or the sequence of series of b.
00:49:26.254 - 00:50:22.906, Speaker B: And so that an is interpolated, say, for instance, exponential. And then let's take b. One is going to be the set of zeros, the blascker product, whose zero is equal, and b two, the complex, the b two, the blasc product with the other zero. Then of course, b is b one times b two. But if we take b over b two, this is b one, and this is an interpolating basket product. So this v one is not in the. So this is quite easy to prove, as I said, that the space, let's see, the space b zero intersection, h infinity does not have the property.
00:50:22.906 - 00:51:11.066, Speaker B: This was first proved by Milton Anderson sometime a few years ago. We were thinking, what happens if we don't consider here b zero, but we consider the block express. And actually, in a working collaboration with whom? Christobar Gonzalez Jose, who colleagues from the University of Malaga. Actually we were able to prove that if we take b intersection of any of the hardware spaces with p less than infinity, this also fails to have the. Probably just not have the. The property of division marine advance. Okay, so I guess, yeah, I guess I should.
00:51:11.066 - 00:51:19.642, Speaker B: 1652. So I guess I should quit here. So let's. Okay, thank you.
00:51:19.778 - 00:51:30.414, Speaker A: Thank you, Daniel. Let's thank this week, any question or comment for Ferdinand?
00:51:32.234 - 00:51:46.146, Speaker C: I have one. Bill Roth, you talked about multipliers of BMOA. Are there any known results about the multipliers of BMO without the a?
00:51:46.290 - 00:52:05.324, Speaker B: Yes, yes. There are the things that I hear, I always thinking on analytic expression, but there are the result, actually, the result that I have written Ortega fabric, as we saw that I have written about bmO. This can be rewritten for multiplies of bmO.
00:52:06.144 - 00:52:09.168, Speaker C: So there's a non analytic.
00:52:09.296 - 00:52:10.008, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:10.176 - 00:52:13.764, Speaker C: Oh, okay. What about VMO?
00:52:14.424 - 00:52:15.568, Speaker B: About VMO?
00:52:15.656 - 00:52:16.324, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:52:18.744 - 00:52:37.620, Speaker B: Well, the result I'm not sure. I guess that they are also known that there is a characterization. I guess that there is a characterism, but right now I cannot. But I guess there is a characteristic.
00:52:37.812 - 00:52:38.584, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:52:40.284 - 00:52:53.544, Speaker A: But then to, I mean, explore a bit the question of Bill. They are not of the geometric characterization in the sense of Carlson or Steganga, that.
00:52:54.224 - 00:52:54.936, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:55.080 - 00:52:56.888, Speaker A: Do we have any characterization of.
00:52:56.936 - 00:53:44.406, Speaker B: No, any of that kind is what I mean. Okay. But not. This is what I said. The characterization that one knows is a very nice characterization, but at the end, it's difficult to check whether a function is a multiplier or not. Then when we take this result that I have, that I have mentioned on blast, some of them would be difficult to check whether they satisfy this condition. So that this happens many times with this kind of characterization, which are good characterization, but at the end, it's difficult to try to check whether a concrete function satisfy that condition or not.
00:53:44.406 - 00:53:46.594, Speaker B: Okay, thank you.
00:53:47.954 - 00:53:52.134, Speaker A: Any further comment or question for Daniel?
00:53:53.514 - 00:54:04.338, Speaker D: Hi, sorry, I had a question about your proof for the duality. It was very nice that you said it's due to Knesset when.
00:54:04.426 - 00:54:05.098, Speaker B: Yes.
00:54:05.266 - 00:54:10.306, Speaker D: So this is not what you sent in the notes, right, this is a different proof?
00:54:10.370 - 00:54:26.636, Speaker B: No, no. In the notes, I have sent two files. One is a file of something that I wrote 20 years ago, but then I send also the transparency that I'm using, and then these transparencies, you can find that.
00:54:26.740 - 00:54:30.664, Speaker D: Oh, okay. How do we get the transparency?
00:54:30.964 - 00:54:36.704, Speaker B: It's in the chat. I uploaded them in the chat. But anyway, I can send you again.
00:54:37.204 - 00:54:40.424, Speaker D: Okay. I don't get any.
00:54:41.204 - 00:55:05.120, Speaker B: I didn't get it either. So maybe I have, I uploaded them in the beginning, so maybe, anyway, I would try to upload them again, because I guess that one month ago, it happens that if somebody enters into the reunion after I send, maybe they cannot. So I will upload them now. Okay. Okay.
00:55:05.232 - 00:55:19.168, Speaker D: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I thought it was very interesting because it's basically in the real hardy BMo cases, what's done in Febrment Stein, when they go into the upper half space and do the.
00:55:19.216 - 00:55:38.020, Speaker B: Sure, yeah, this can be, this can be. This can be done in the half a half plane also. This is more or less. Okay, thank you. So I will try to upload this again now. Okay. Let's see if I can do it, because I was able once.
00:55:38.020 - 00:55:39.004, Speaker B: I will take.
00:55:39.124 - 00:55:49.684, Speaker A: Okay, thank you, Daniel. So let's thank the speaker again, and we appreciate.
