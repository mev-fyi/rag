00:00:25.120 - 00:01:31.304, Speaker A: In the middle of proof, we saw up to here that gamma is defined from. Gamma initially was defined from h one plus h two to h. And then we made the restriction from n plus to h. And this is a bijective map. And the good thing about this is that now we can transfer the Hilbert space structure and in perp to h, and more explicitly for any f and g in h. Then we have the inner product of f and gene h. Note that f can be written as f one plus f two.
00:01:31.884 - 00:01:36.580, Speaker B: F one is in h one, f two is in h two.
00:01:36.732 - 00:01:38.424, Speaker A: The same for g.
00:01:41.884 - 00:01:47.364, Speaker B: G one is in h one, g two is in h two.
00:01:47.944 - 00:02:47.774, Speaker A: And well, we would like to usually to write here that this is the inner product of f one, g one and f. But due to non uniqueness we cannot do the same. But now we can do the projection. Consider p to be the projection of h one plus h two in n plus an n perp. So for example for f one and f two, which is a pair representing f. Possibly this is not the best one, but we can project it as obtain p of f one and f two. That's possibly another pair, but it's the best one.
00:02:47.774 - 00:02:54.810, Speaker A: In terms of the definition of norm and inner force, the same for g one and g two.
00:02:54.882 - 00:02:57.490, Speaker B: So g one and g two is.
00:02:57.522 - 00:03:03.634, Speaker A: A pair in h one plus h two. But we projected and obtained projection of.
00:03:03.674 - 00:03:05.098, Speaker B: G one and g two.
00:03:05.226 - 00:03:07.002, Speaker A: And the definition here.
00:03:07.098 - 00:03:08.734, Speaker B: So, definition.
00:03:11.034 - 00:03:49.006, Speaker A: Is the projection of doesn't matter. Any representation f one and f two for f, and the projection of any pair representing g. And this happens in n plus or in h one plus h two. So that's the way I said. We copy the structure of n perp and put it for h. That's precisely.
00:03:49.070 - 00:03:50.634, Speaker B: What I wrote here.
00:03:51.814 - 00:03:54.710, Speaker A: And also the norm.
00:03:54.782 - 00:03:55.554, Speaker B: Therefore.
00:03:57.334 - 00:04:20.624, Speaker A: The norm of f in h squared is the norm of p. Any representation f one and f two project n squared. And now we explore the properties of.
00:04:22.444 - 00:04:23.184, Speaker B: This.
00:04:25.184 - 00:05:28.044, Speaker A: Norm that we defined. First thing, in any space, the norm of the projection on m of x is the same thing as the minimum of all x plus or minus y when y is in the orthogonal space. That's very easy and standard. And therefore here I can write normal f in space h squared, which is defined by definition, is p. And note that p is the projection on n perp. Therefore this is equal to the minimum.
00:05:29.504 - 00:05:30.244, Speaker B: Of.
00:05:33.064 - 00:05:46.394, Speaker A: F one and f two plus any element to its orthogonal complement. So any g and minus g when.
00:05:46.694 - 00:06:00.994, Speaker B: G is in h one intersection h two. Here it is.
00:06:01.534 - 00:06:28.964, Speaker A: That's a realization of this identity. So, norm of projection of something squared is equal to the minimum of the norm of that element plus an arbitrary element of the kernel, the null space. But for all element in the null space, and you take the minimum.
00:06:30.704 - 00:06:31.064, Speaker B: Or.
00:06:31.104 - 00:06:33.488, Speaker A: If you wish, you can write it.
00:06:33.536 - 00:06:39.874, Speaker B: This way, so can write it the.
00:06:39.914 - 00:06:46.066, Speaker A: Minimum f one plus g f two.
00:06:46.130 - 00:06:57.294, Speaker B: Minus g. Forgot square here. For any g in h one intersection h two.
00:06:57.714 - 00:07:03.298, Speaker A: And remember it's up there. I don't want to go back. F one and f two are such.
00:07:03.346 - 00:07:06.534, Speaker B: That f is equal to f one plus f two.
00:07:09.074 - 00:08:16.276, Speaker A: But when you consider all these combinations, all this f one plus g and f two minus g. This is the same as saying that g one and g two such that g one is in h one, g two is in h two, and the sum is equal to f one plus f two, which is equal to f. So in other words, our variable, instead of being g, which is in the null space, we move it to the liberty on the choice of g one and g two, as long as the sum is equal to f. So now I can write it this way and the same minimum. It's just a matter of notation. And in all cases the the norm is in h one plus h two. And we know that the definition of the norm here is the norm of the first element in h one plus.
00:08:16.340 - 00:08:18.660, Speaker B: The norm of the second element in.
00:08:18.692 - 00:09:01.292, Speaker A: H two with the same condition. So that is the relation between the normal f and its representation. The representation which gives the minimal norm is the best one. But now there is a very important observation. And here is the observation. Consider as before, we write k one k y one for the kernel in.
00:09:01.308 - 00:09:12.024, Speaker B: The first space and the same for k. Twelve the kernel in the second space. So.
00:09:13.844 - 00:10:00.502, Speaker A: Here is the claim. The element ky one ky two, which is in. Of course h one plus h two is orthogonal to n all the time for any y. That's a very important observation. Proof is not that difficult, because an arbitrary element of n is like this. Let f minus f be in n.
00:10:00.598 - 00:10:05.554, Speaker B: Where f is in the intersection.
00:10:07.374 - 00:10:12.166, Speaker A: Then what is the inner product of these two elements?
00:10:12.310 - 00:10:18.858, Speaker B: F minus f ky one ky two.
00:10:18.946 - 00:10:31.774, Speaker A: That's another element. Both element in this space, h one plus h two, by definition stay in a product of the first two components.
00:10:32.314 - 00:10:35.882, Speaker B: So f and k y one in.
00:10:35.898 - 00:10:43.942, Speaker A: The first space plus inner product of the second two elements, which is this.
00:10:43.998 - 00:10:50.434, Speaker B: One and this one minus f and ky two in the second space.
00:10:52.374 - 00:11:07.946, Speaker A: And now use the fact that f is in both h one and h two, and that's the kernel function. So this is f evaluated at point. Yeah, in the space h one, but.
00:11:08.010 - 00:11:10.186, Speaker B: It'S a complex number, fy.
00:11:10.370 - 00:11:21.334, Speaker A: And for the second is minus fy. But in the second it's in h two. But at the end of the day, we have f of y, which is zero for any y.
00:11:23.834 - 00:11:30.374, Speaker B: And that is why ky one k y two.
00:11:31.374 - 00:11:35.790, Speaker A: This is orthogonal. Or to n, or it's an element.
00:11:35.862 - 00:11:41.594, Speaker B: Of n. Perp longs to enter.
00:11:45.654 - 00:11:50.294, Speaker A: Let's play that is going to play.
00:11:50.334 - 00:11:51.954, Speaker B: An important role now.
00:11:57.034 - 00:12:09.562, Speaker A: Knowing this, take any f in this space h. So f can be written as f one.
00:12:09.618 - 00:12:16.654, Speaker B: Plus f two, where f one is in h one. F two is in h two.
00:12:19.794 - 00:13:00.186, Speaker A: What can we say about the inner product of f and k y one plus ky two in this space h? You remember the definition above? This is, by definition, is equal to the projection of any representation of f. I take here f one and f two, and the projection of any representation of the second element.
00:13:00.370 - 00:13:05.066, Speaker B: Well, we have a natural choice, ky.
00:13:05.130 - 00:13:07.818, Speaker A: One and ky two in this space.
00:13:07.906 - 00:13:09.894, Speaker B: H one plus h two.
00:13:12.434 - 00:13:30.586, Speaker A: We had this definition of inner product in H. Well, and now use the fact that p is a projection. So I can take p to the other side. It becomes p two, but p two is equal to p. So here I.
00:13:30.610 - 00:13:46.154, Speaker B: Can write f one f two, k one, k one two. In h one plus h two.
00:13:47.254 - 00:13:51.350, Speaker A: I use the fact that p equal.
00:13:51.422 - 00:13:55.070, Speaker B: To p star equal to p two.
00:13:55.262 - 00:14:03.478, Speaker A: And also the fact that p is equal to identity on n perp, because.
00:14:03.526 - 00:14:05.474, Speaker B: It'S a projection on n perp.
00:14:07.694 - 00:14:24.652, Speaker A: And that element is in n perp. So these are all used here to remove p. And then we continue. By definition, this is f one inner.
00:14:24.708 - 00:14:41.664, Speaker B: Product of ky one. In h one plus f two. Inner product of ky two. In h two becomes f one of y plus f two y.
00:14:43.364 - 00:14:44.784, Speaker A: Which is f of y.
00:14:46.124 - 00:14:54.224, Speaker B: So for any y f of y is equal to.
00:14:56.524 - 00:15:04.616, Speaker A: F inner product in.
00:15:04.680 - 00:15:06.124, Speaker B: The space H.
00:15:07.864 - 00:15:25.592, Speaker A: So it's more than being a Hilbert space. So it's an rkhs, and its kernel ky in the space h is equal.
00:15:25.648 - 00:15:31.174, Speaker B: To ky one plus ky two.
00:15:32.994 - 00:15:41.234, Speaker A: Or if you want to evaluate, at point x, so k x and y.
00:15:41.354 - 00:15:56.322, Speaker B: But for the space h is equal to k x y in a space one or h one, k x y a point h two.
00:15:56.378 - 00:16:06.962, Speaker A: This is the same thing as here, what evaluated at x. Or put it simply, k equal to.
00:16:07.138 - 00:16:08.974, Speaker B: K one plus k two.
00:16:11.234 - 00:17:18.550, Speaker A: So the h that I constructed, it's. It's an rkhs khs with kernel k one plus k two. Most of this we knew before, the only thing which is rather new here is that the elements of this space are the sum of the element of the first space and the second space. And moreover, now we know how to evaluate the norm of each element. There are some, even some nice examples here in the finite dimensional case. But before that, let's have a corollary, which is a useful corollary. Then the intersection of h one and h two is just zero, and that's the easy case.
00:17:18.550 - 00:17:20.594, Speaker A: So h one.
00:17:24.694 - 00:17:37.714, Speaker B: What happened to me? So h one and h two are rkhs on x.
00:17:39.774 - 00:17:45.044, Speaker A: And the extra condition here is that.
00:17:46.784 - 00:17:54.524, Speaker B: H one intersection, h two is equal to zero. The trivial case.
00:17:55.864 - 00:17:56.604, Speaker A: Then.
00:18:01.024 - 00:18:14.340, Speaker B: H of k one plus k two is, well, simply can say, the.
00:18:14.372 - 00:18:20.068, Speaker A: Set of all f one plus f two.
00:18:20.156 - 00:18:26.064, Speaker B: F one is in h one, f two is in h two. We know this.
00:18:26.404 - 00:18:41.016, Speaker A: But moreover, with in this case, norm of f one plus f two in h squared is just normal f one.
00:18:41.200 - 00:18:47.008, Speaker B: In h one squared plus normal f two in h two squared.
00:18:47.056 - 00:19:02.664, Speaker A: Because there is just one representation, it is true that we should take the minimum, but there's just one of them. And well, this also implies that and.
00:19:07.044 - 00:19:10.996, Speaker B: H one and h two, because of.
00:19:11.020 - 00:19:14.544, Speaker A: This representation, are orthogonal.
00:19:19.644 - 00:19:21.984, Speaker B: Subspaces of H.
00:19:22.564 - 00:19:25.404, Speaker A: Most of them are in h, but they are orthogonal.
00:19:25.444 - 00:19:26.384, Speaker B: P chart.
00:19:29.224 - 00:19:36.928, Speaker A: It'S a special case, but interesting. And you see the only difference is.
00:19:36.976 - 00:19:42.644, Speaker B: Caused by the trigger intersection.
00:19:55.284 - 00:20:19.784, Speaker A: There is a section about finite dimensional rkhs, which is an application of this. And what happens, there's nothing delicate in it. I go to the next section, which is for pullback. And these consequences for restriction and composition, we will need this when we go to product and tensor production.
00:20:20.754 - 00:20:25.574, Speaker B: So, poll tax.
00:20:29.314 - 00:20:58.734, Speaker A: Well, assume that x is a set, and we consider a subset of x s. If k from x times x to c is given and it's a kernel function, then we may consider the restriction, the restriction of, let's call it.
00:20:58.774 - 00:21:00.634, Speaker B: K restricted to s.
00:21:06.054 - 00:21:21.666, Speaker A: What can we say about this? Can we claim that ks is k restricted to s is also positive, which I believe everybody, I mean, immediately say.
00:21:21.730 - 00:21:24.134, Speaker B: Yes, it is very natural to.
00:21:26.154 - 00:21:59.724, Speaker A: Consider and to prove, and the proof is not indeed that difficult. So I want to show this, and even I want to go a little bit more, because when I say restriction, it means that I consider the mapping inclusion s from x, and then, instead of considering k over x, which is indeed over x, time x. But we can use this abuse of.
00:21:59.764 - 00:22:00.504, Speaker B: Language.
00:22:04.144 - 00:22:40.120, Speaker A: And consider composition of k with I. And then this gives us the restriction over s. I emphasize again that it is true that it's defined over x times x, but I mean, you understand, and even in the book you write it that way. So why just the inclusion? Consider any mapping. So s is not necessarily now a subset of x. So we consider phi defined from s.
00:22:40.192 - 00:22:41.164, Speaker B: To x.
00:22:42.944 - 00:23:13.384, Speaker A: And k is defined from x times x towards c k positive. And now k compose with phi on s times s with values in c. By, I mean, again, abuse of notation.
00:23:14.044 - 00:23:33.164, Speaker B: It is indeed k composed phi times phi. But you understand what you mean. And as I said, even in the book, it's written that way.
00:23:39.504 - 00:23:44.704, Speaker A: Kofi at point s and t is.
00:23:44.744 - 00:23:52.144, Speaker B: Defined to be a k at point phi s and v t.
00:23:55.084 - 00:24:13.928, Speaker A: So what can we say about k composed with phi? The same thing that we expected for the restriction works for k composal three.
00:24:14.116 - 00:24:27.164, Speaker B: And here is the proposition k zero and s.
00:24:31.304 - 00:24:35.424, Speaker A: Proof is easy, but you need to be a little bit careful.
00:24:35.504 - 00:24:42.280, Speaker B: For the notations and the way you write the proof.
00:24:42.472 - 00:24:44.080, Speaker A: So I want to show that this.
00:24:44.112 - 00:24:55.616, Speaker B: Is positive on S. So let s one s two s ten be a.
00:24:55.640 - 00:24:59.472, Speaker A: Finite set in s and alpha one.
00:24:59.528 - 00:25:02.804, Speaker B: Alpha two alpha n complex numbers.
00:25:05.344 - 00:25:08.824, Speaker A: And now what can I say about.
00:25:08.984 - 00:25:18.764, Speaker B: Sum I and j from one up to n alpha I bar alpha j.
00:25:19.544 - 00:25:23.884, Speaker A: And k o v at the point.
00:25:24.264 - 00:25:37.244, Speaker B: S I s j. Well, by definition this is sum I j from one up to n alpha I bar alpha j.
00:25:37.864 - 00:25:48.604, Speaker A: By definition, this is k evaluated at point si if at point vsi and vsj.
00:25:50.504 - 00:25:51.284, Speaker B: True.
00:25:52.304 - 00:26:06.196, Speaker A: Now, even we usually do. Indeed, we assume that si up to s s n are distinct. So we usually add this even though.
00:26:06.220 - 00:26:07.492, Speaker B: It is not needed.
00:26:07.628 - 00:26:20.584, Speaker A: But even if we add that s one up to sn are distinct, phi s one, phi s two up to phi sn are not necessarily distinct.
00:26:21.844 - 00:26:24.584, Speaker B: There might be repetition among them.
00:26:24.884 - 00:26:34.470, Speaker A: And that is why I defined this set. Ak is the set of all indices.
00:26:34.582 - 00:26:39.714, Speaker B: I such that phi of si is.
00:26:40.334 - 00:26:49.034, Speaker A: X k. What is x k? In other words, I consider the set.
00:26:49.574 - 00:26:55.354, Speaker B: Phi s one v s two up to vsn.
00:26:56.134 - 00:27:00.998, Speaker A: These are element of x, but probably there are repetition between them.
00:27:01.166 - 00:27:03.678, Speaker B: So I can write x one x.
00:27:03.726 - 00:27:11.502, Speaker A: Two up to, say, index p x p p is not necessarily equal to.
00:27:11.558 - 00:27:13.794, Speaker B: N, which might be less.
00:27:15.054 - 00:27:23.844, Speaker A: And so I put those which create x one together, those which create x.
00:27:23.884 - 00:27:33.384, Speaker B: Two together, and so on. So I mean, you can imagine like this here is all.
00:27:35.244 - 00:27:37.228, Speaker A: Vsj which creates.
00:27:37.276 - 00:27:44.824, Speaker B: I mean, x one and the same for the last one is create xp. I mean, I put them in one basket.
00:27:46.884 - 00:27:53.084, Speaker A: And what is the advantage of this here?
00:27:55.104 - 00:27:58.360, Speaker B: I can write it this way instead.
00:27:58.392 - 00:28:05.688, Speaker A: Of sum over I and sum over j from one to n. I sum.
00:28:05.736 - 00:28:34.384, Speaker B: Over two other indices, sum if over k and l from one up to piece. And here is some I is in ak in one of them and j is in al. That's why thinking our partition is important.
00:28:36.364 - 00:28:53.760, Speaker A: And k evaluated at point vsi vsj. But now for all I in ak, this is a unique element.
00:28:53.832 - 00:29:00.724, Speaker B: It's, this is x k and this is xl.
00:29:03.384 - 00:29:05.604, Speaker A: So. Oh, I forgot something.
00:29:05.984 - 00:29:22.854, Speaker B: I forgot this. I forgot these coefficients. So I add them here. Alpha I bar alpha j. True.
00:29:25.634 - 00:29:30.014, Speaker A: So what remains is some.
00:29:32.754 - 00:29:34.004, Speaker B: K from.
00:29:34.154 - 00:29:45.616, Speaker A: K and l, both of them from one up to p. K, x, k xl doesn't depend on I and j.
00:29:45.800 - 00:30:03.184, Speaker B: So I would have some I in a k, alpha I bar, some j in l alpha j. Okay, xk xl.
00:30:05.564 - 00:30:07.436, Speaker A: And simply call this.
00:30:07.580 - 00:30:28.164, Speaker B: Beta l. Define this to be beta l. This would be better k bar. So it beta k bar beta l, k x k xl.
00:30:28.504 - 00:30:33.328, Speaker A: And we know by the properties of k, the kernel function.
00:30:33.376 - 00:30:40.364, Speaker B: This is positive. And therefore this implies that k composed with phi is positive.
00:30:41.224 - 00:30:45.044, Speaker A: It's not a difficult proof, but I mean a little bit of.
00:30:48.144 - 00:30:51.244, Speaker B: Attention in the middle.
00:30:52.324 - 00:30:57.344, Speaker A: Well, consequence of this, it's an easy theorem.
00:31:00.564 - 00:31:02.824, Speaker B: Which is called pull back theorem.
00:31:10.204 - 00:31:14.344, Speaker A: We have as before x and s sets.
00:31:16.244 - 00:31:19.360, Speaker B: Not necessarily one subset of the.
00:31:19.392 - 00:31:24.056, Speaker A: Other, but we have a phi which is defined from one of them to.
00:31:24.080 - 00:31:29.176, Speaker B: The other, from s to x, any function.
00:31:29.240 - 00:31:55.744, Speaker A: And k is a kernel on the second one. Then we saw about that. We can talk about k composed with phi, so we can talk about h.
00:31:56.724 - 00:32:01.264, Speaker B: Of k composed with phi. More trn.
00:32:02.044 - 00:32:04.956, Speaker A: And now we can say what is.
00:32:04.980 - 00:32:16.704, Speaker B: This space is the space or what you imagine it has to be f composed with phi. F is in Hk.
00:32:19.844 - 00:32:30.864, Speaker A: And something similar to what we had before for addition. What is the norm of.
00:32:32.564 - 00:32:37.576, Speaker B: Android for.
00:32:37.640 - 00:32:45.192, Speaker A: Any element, say u in h of.
00:32:45.248 - 00:32:46.244, Speaker B: K of.
00:32:48.064 - 00:32:52.164, Speaker A: We have what is the norm of u.
00:32:53.984 - 00:32:55.244, Speaker B: In this space?
00:33:01.604 - 00:33:14.172, Speaker A: Well, it is natural to say that u is of the form f of doesn't do that much. So it has to be practically the.
00:33:14.228 - 00:33:18.064, Speaker B: Norm of f in h of k.
00:33:20.204 - 00:33:23.660, Speaker A: Almost true, almost true.
00:33:23.852 - 00:33:31.514, Speaker B: Here I add u is equal to f. Compose with phi.
00:33:33.014 - 00:33:59.998, Speaker A: So if u is obtained from composition with phi, the normal u is. I mean, u would like to be the normal f. But the same problem as before. In the case of addition, f is not unique, different. F may compose with phi and give the same function u. And therefore now it is natural for.
00:34:00.046 - 00:34:03.078, Speaker B: U, based on what we saw before.
00:34:03.166 - 00:34:16.534, Speaker A: For addition, to add minimum here along all the possible representation, the one which gives the minimum norm is the right norm of.
00:34:16.694 - 00:34:19.064, Speaker B: Uh.
00:34:21.034 - 00:34:23.454, Speaker A: We have all the ingredients to.
00:34:24.034 - 00:34:26.494, Speaker B: For the proof we have developed them before.
00:34:32.034 - 00:34:48.837, Speaker A: So assume that f is in h of k. And for simplicity, write the norm of f in h k by the constant c. By the famous theorem.
00:34:48.885 - 00:34:53.313, Speaker B: 3.1 that we saw several times today.
00:34:55.333 - 00:34:59.233, Speaker A: F of x, f of y bar.
00:35:00.493 - 00:35:10.513, Speaker B: Is controlled by c two k of x y. This is one side of the theorem.
00:35:11.154 - 00:35:16.186, Speaker A: And now we can do the composition with phi.
00:35:16.290 - 00:35:17.694, Speaker B: As we saw before.
00:35:18.154 - 00:35:19.334, Speaker A: This implies.
00:35:21.034 - 00:35:27.850, Speaker B: Y is in x. This immediately implies, based on the proposition.
00:35:27.922 - 00:35:31.794, Speaker A: We saw before, that f at the.
00:35:31.834 - 00:35:56.684, Speaker B: Point v of s, f at the point phi of t bar is controlled by c two k pls t for any smt in s. That's by proposition.
00:36:00.664 - 00:36:08.792, Speaker A: Which I write as f composed with phi evaluated at s, f composed with.
00:36:08.848 - 00:36:13.752, Speaker B: Phi evaluated at t bar c two.
00:36:13.808 - 00:36:16.288, Speaker A: And instead of k at point v.
00:36:16.336 - 00:36:25.600, Speaker B: Svt, I write the kernel k of evaluated at point s and t. And.
00:36:25.632 - 00:36:27.544, Speaker A: One more time, the same theorem that.
00:36:27.584 - 00:36:31.344, Speaker B: I applied here, it's the same theorem, but.
00:36:33.364 - 00:36:42.148, Speaker A: From the other range it was an equivalent condition. So when I have this, it implies that f of phi is in this.
00:36:42.196 - 00:36:42.784, Speaker B: Space.
00:36:46.604 - 00:36:53.104, Speaker A: And moreover, the normal fo fe in this space.
00:36:57.184 - 00:37:08.684, Speaker B: Is controlled by this constant. In other words, in other words, norm of f of g.
00:37:12.544 - 00:37:13.336, Speaker A: Is less than.
00:37:13.360 - 00:37:18.964, Speaker B: Or equal to all the time. The normal f in h of k all the time.
00:37:21.404 - 00:37:41.332, Speaker A: This is one thing, but I want to show that for any f, if I consider all the possible representation for you and take the minimum, this inequality.
00:37:41.428 - 00:37:46.784, Speaker B: Becomes an identity inequality. And how can I do that?
00:37:47.114 - 00:37:54.654, Speaker A: And to do this, let l to be the kernel of instead of kofi.
00:37:56.394 - 00:38:06.774, Speaker B: I write L. It's simpler that way. So l of s and t is kvsvt.
00:38:07.634 - 00:38:11.974, Speaker A: And so it's the kernel. L is the kernel for the space.
00:38:12.334 - 00:38:27.494, Speaker B: Kernel of the space h of k composed with k, h of n. And.
00:38:27.534 - 00:38:53.374, Speaker A: Now if you consider u to be a finite sum alpha I l, little l at point, say ti, recall that when you have capital l, little l, s at point c is l of.
00:38:57.314 - 00:39:00.614, Speaker B: Tns. That's the convention we had before.
00:39:01.874 - 00:39:15.534, Speaker A: So this is a finite linear combination of kernel function. And for this we have an advantage. We can calculate the norm of u.
00:39:15.954 - 00:39:21.018, Speaker B: In this space h of l. Why?
00:39:21.186 - 00:39:29.570, Speaker A: Because when we do norm squared, it norm of u and u in the.
00:39:29.602 - 00:39:58.194, Speaker B: Space h of luck, it's sum I from one to n alpha I l t I sum alpha. But it doesn't matter which one I, which one j nti. And we have seen this many, many times before.
00:39:58.644 - 00:40:00.384, Speaker A: So it becomes some.
00:40:02.204 - 00:40:03.548, Speaker B: Alpha I bar.
00:40:03.676 - 00:40:17.980, Speaker A: Alpha j summation over in j and l of tj. Inner product with l of ti is l of tj at point ti, which.
00:40:18.012 - 00:40:30.874, Speaker B: Is l of ti and tj or PI mj from one to n alpha bar alpha j. This is k.
00:40:33.334 - 00:40:35.194, Speaker A: Evaluated at point.
00:40:37.894 - 00:40:38.614, Speaker B: J.
00:40:38.774 - 00:40:51.304, Speaker A: And now we do the same operation backward, but instead of hl we do it in hk. So if we do this operation backward, what we obtain?
00:40:51.724 - 00:40:53.064, Speaker B: Let me do this.
00:40:53.404 - 00:40:54.708, Speaker A: Since time is running.
00:40:54.756 - 00:40:57.820, Speaker B: I write the final result.
00:40:58.012 - 00:41:10.860, Speaker A: We obtain the norm of the sum I from one up to n alpha I little k at point x.
00:41:11.012 - 00:41:18.884, Speaker B: This is our xi nhk squared.
00:41:20.424 - 00:41:38.244, Speaker A: So I briefly I write the result if I remove the square. What I showed is that the norm of some alpha I l say ti.
00:41:39.264 - 00:41:56.944, Speaker B: Squared in h of l is equal to the sum alpha I k v t I in h k. We can.
00:41:57.244 - 00:42:04.184, Speaker A: We have an isometry. We have an isometry. So let me draw a diagram.
00:42:05.444 - 00:42:22.494, Speaker B: Here is h of L which is h of k composed with phi mapping. Here goes to h of l, which is h of k composed with phi.
00:42:24.234 - 00:42:36.872, Speaker A: This is our isometry which I established. I can call it gamma goes to h of k. These elements are dense.
00:42:36.928 - 00:42:40.004, Speaker B: In h of L. So I can.
00:42:40.424 - 00:43:08.002, Speaker A: I can, I can extend this from the finite sum to the whole space. So I have an isometry which goes from h of L to h of k. And here consider the composition with c of phi. What do I obtain? So if I start with l ti.
00:43:08.058 - 00:43:08.654, Speaker B: Here.
00:43:10.634 - 00:43:35.264, Speaker A: Gamma gives me lk at the point phi ti. And when I compose with c phi, note that c phi acts on this element on this argument. So it gives me k phi ti phi.
00:43:36.444 - 00:43:37.184, Speaker B: This.
00:43:40.724 - 00:43:43.620, Speaker A: True, which is, which is the.
00:43:43.652 - 00:43:48.380, Speaker B: Same as lti acting.
00:43:48.492 - 00:44:04.194, Speaker A: In other words, I obtained identity here and this observation help us to obtain the minimum that we had about. So c phi composed with.
00:44:06.574 - 00:44:07.582, Speaker B: Compose with.
00:44:07.638 - 00:44:12.374, Speaker A: Gamma is the identity on h of.
00:44:12.414 - 00:44:18.050, Speaker B: L, h of k composer with and.
00:44:18.082 - 00:44:27.694, Speaker A: Therefore for any u here is for any u in k in h of.
00:44:30.594 - 00:44:31.334, Speaker B: L.
00:44:35.874 - 00:45:12.728, Speaker A: There is an f among all the representation. You consider a u here, you can see there a u here, but u can be here too in the space. So u goes to an element f here and then compose it with phi.
00:45:12.816 - 00:45:16.896, Speaker B: Gives you the same u that we started with.
00:45:17.040 - 00:45:37.464, Speaker A: So u can be written as f composed with phi where f is gamma of u. The good thing about this specific representation is that normal f is equal to the norm of u.
00:45:38.884 - 00:45:42.624, Speaker B: This is in hk, this is in Hl.
00:45:43.444 - 00:45:49.104, Speaker A: So we obtain one representation for which the equality works.
00:45:49.604 - 00:45:51.584, Speaker B: Go back here. Go back.
00:45:53.124 - 00:46:15.380, Speaker A: Go back here all the time. Norm of u is less than or equal to the norm of f. But there is one specific representation for which the identity holds. And that is why I can write normal view is equal to the minimum.
00:46:15.452 - 00:46:29.844, Speaker B: Of all possible representation. All f such that u is equal to f compose with v. That's the end of the story.
00:46:32.704 - 00:46:36.884, Speaker A: Well, it's a good time to stop here.
00:46:37.664 - 00:46:40.344, Speaker B: Sorry, I went a little bit over time.
