00:00:00.360 - 00:00:02.674, Speaker A: On the richly spaces. Tom, please.
00:00:04.014 - 00:00:39.014, Speaker B: Thank you, Gerard. So I'll share my screen. Everyone can see that. Okay? Sure. So, hello, everybody. So it's going to be a continuation of the talk from yesterday. So yesterday we looked at some of the basics of the Dirichlet space, the definition, and we discussed boundary behavior, and in particular in terms of capacity.
00:00:39.014 - 00:01:44.154, Speaker B: And my goal today is to talk about questions concerning zeros and multipliers. So I'm going to start with zeros just as before. If you have a question, either feel free to button open your microphone and button, or you can ask in the chat. I'll try and keep an eye on the chat as we go along. So, first of all, let's make sure that we're talking about the same thing. So a sequence zn in unit disk, possibly with repetitions, is a zero set for Dirichlet space. If there is a function in the Dirichlet space that vanishes on this set, but is not identically zero, and if it's not a zero set, in other words, if every function vanishing on the set is identically zero, then we'll call it a uniqueness set.
00:01:44.154 - 00:02:37.754, Speaker B: This is perhaps a little controversial, because I don't insist that my function vanish precisely on the z end and nowhere else, merely that it's not identically zero. But actually, at least in the case we're looking at here, it doesn't make any difference, because if your function has unwanted zeros, then you can divide them out. And the trick is simply you. You form a Blaschke product containing the unwanted zeros you divide through by that. And that has the effect of actually reducing the Dirichlet integral of f. So the new function with the zeros removed will still be in the Dirichlet space if the original function was. So we can always reduce the case where the function vanishes precisely on the z ends.
00:02:37.754 - 00:03:40.940, Speaker B: Incidentally, the proof that dividing through Bioblasca product reduces the value of the Dewichi integral, it's like so many things, it's a consequence of this fantastic formula of Carlisle that I showed you last time. There are also more direct proofs of it. Okay, so the question is, what are these sets? So, obviously, if you have a function that vanishes on the z n holomotic function, then the z end must be a sequence that tends to the boundary just by the isolated zeros principle. And in the case of the hardy space, we know rather more. We know that if the z ends are a zero set, then they have to converge to the boundary fast enough for this series here to converge. In other words, the z ends form so called Blaschky sequence. And this condition is not only necessary, it's also sufficient.
00:03:40.940 - 00:04:25.636, Speaker B: Because if the z ends do satisfy that condition, well, you can just construct a Blaschke product that vanishes on those Zn's and nowhere else. And that will be in. In the Hardy space h two. It will even be in the Hardy space h infinity, which is smaller. So what about the duichlase space? Well, since the Duichley space is contained in the Hardy space, it's clear, I hope, that every function in the Dirichlet space will have zeros also satisfying this requirement. The problem is that the converse won't work anymore. You can't simply say, let's form a blasphemy product with the Z ends, because that blaschky product, in general, won't belong to the Douichlay space.
00:04:25.636 - 00:05:06.928, Speaker B: In fact, I mentioned last time that the only blaschky products are belong to the Duishluy space of finite blaschky products. Now, you could try and get around the problem by multiplying your infrared bashk product by a suitable out of factor and try to produce something that's in the Dirichlet space. And, well, that's where all the tricky arguments go. I mean, this is the real problem. So what's actually known about this problem? Well, it turns out there are three cases. So the first case is already. From what I said, I think it's obvious.
00:05:06.928 - 00:05:59.064, Speaker B: If the Z ends do not form a blaspheme sequence, then they're a uniqueness set for the hardy space and therefore also for the Dirichlet space. There's no function in the Dirichlet space that can vanish just on the Z ends. So that's. I think that's easy. There's a second case, and this is a theorem of Shapiro and shields improving an earlier result of Carlisle in the same direction. So they proved that if the z ends converge to the boundary sufficiently rapidly that this series you see here, one over mod log of one minus mod zn, if that series converges, then Zn is a zero set. So this is a sufficient condition for the zs to be a zero set.
00:05:59.064 - 00:06:36.624, Speaker B: Now, it's probably not immediately obvious what this. This condition here, this condition in the Shapiro Shields theorem. Same. But just think about the following example for a second. Suppose that zn is a distance e to the minus m from the boundary. Okay? So then one minus mod zn would be e to the minus n log of. That would be a mod log of that would be n, and so you would have the series sigma one over nice that diverges.
00:06:36.624 - 00:07:31.044, Speaker B: So even if the z ends ten to the unit circle at a rate so fast that the distance is e to the minus n, that still isn't fast enough to make this series converge. So that the convergence of this series is saying that the zn's converge to the unit circle really, really fast. So there's a big gap between this condition and the Blaschke condition. And the third case governs what happens in that gap. And there the answer is perhaps a bit surprising. So this is a result of Nagel, Rudin and Shapiro, again improving an earlier result of Carlisle. So suppose the z ends falling between the two regimes, so they don't satisfy either case one or case two.
00:07:31.044 - 00:08:28.804, Speaker B: Then you can find a zero set Zn prime and a uniqueness set Zn that has exactly the same moduli as Zn. In other words, just knowing mod Zn is not sufficient to tell you whether the zns are zero set or uniqueness set. And in this case, the arguments of the ZM matter. So this is completely different to what happens in the harder space, where just knowing mod ZM tells you everything about whether you have a zero set or not. Okay, so I'm going to return to the question of the arguments in a little while. But before doing that, it's convenient to look at another question. And this is the question of zero sets on the boundary.
00:08:28.804 - 00:09:30.546, Speaker B: So, remember, if we're in the, if you have a function in the Dirichlet space, then it has non tangential boundary values quasi everywhere, everywhere outside a set of capacity zero. And it makes sense to ask what subsets of the unit circle can be zero sets for this extended function. In other words, for f star. Now, if you compare the situation with the Hardy space, you might wonder, why doesn't this question even get asked in the case of the Hardy space? Well, for the Hardy space, it doesn't even make sense to talk about subsets of measure zero, because in any function in the Hardy space, there is always an ambiguity of a set of measure zero. A function is defined, the boundary function is defined almost everywhere. So you have this ambiguity of sets of measure zero, and immediately you have a set of positive measure. It's no longer a zero set of the hardest space.
00:09:30.546 - 00:10:20.164, Speaker B: It's a one line result that if f star vanishes on a set of positive measure in the circle, then f must be identically zero. And so the question of classifying the zero sets for functions in the hardy space, the boundary zero sets doesn't even arise, but in the Dirichlet space, it makes perfectly good sense. And in fact, it's a very interesting question. So, before diving into the Dirichlet space, I just want to mention one or two other spaces where this question can be answered. And the answer was known long ago. So, the first example is the disk algebra. So this is the function of polymorphic functions on the unit disk that extend to be continuous on the closed unit disk.
00:10:20.164 - 00:10:56.332, Speaker B: And there the answer is very simple and very nice. So, a boundary set is a zero set for a function in the disk algebra. If and only if it's of linear leben measure zero. So if you're given the subset of unit circle of lubeg measure zero closed subset, then there is a function in the disk algebra vanishing precisely on that set. And that condition is necessary and sufficient. If you look at the smaller algebra, a one of d. So that's the, this thing here.
00:10:56.332 - 00:11:51.890, Speaker B: So a one of d is the set of functions such that, that are holomorphic on the disk, such that both f and f, dashed, extend continuously to the boundary. In other words, f dash belongs to the disk algebra. And there, the answer for what are the boundary zero sets is a little bit different, because if f is in a one, then because the derivative of f is bounded, f itself must be ellipsis function. And it's not very difficult to deduce from that, that the zero set of f must satisfy another condition. And the condition is actually, what's the one that's written here. So, e is a certain closed subset of the unit circle. And what I'm saying is that if f is a function in a one and e is at zero set on the unit circle, then e must satisfy this condition.
00:11:51.890 - 00:12:34.694, Speaker B: This is actually very, very easy result to prove. And Carlison proved the converse. This is the theorem that I've stated here. So, he showed that if e satisfies this condition, then indeed there is a function in a one whose zero set is exactly equal to e. And because he did this, sets like this, and are commonly called Carlson sets. Just a word about what this condition is saying. It certainly implies that e is a set of measure zero, but it's saying more than that.
00:12:34.694 - 00:13:20.258, Speaker B: So because he is a closed subset of the circle, its complement is open. So it's a union of open arcs. And because e has measure zero, the sums of the lengths of these arcs has to be two PI. That's easy. And what this condition is saying in terms of the length of the arcs is that if you call the jth arc ij, then the sum of the lengths of the ij times the logs of their lengths. So mod I, log, mod I, some of those things has to converge. And so this is sort of saying not just, it's not a condition about the size of e, but more about how e is distributed on the unit circle.
00:13:20.258 - 00:14:19.370, Speaker B: So it's a kind of regularity condition. Okay, so what does all this have to do with the Dirichlet space? Well, if f is in a one, then it's certainly in the Dirichlet space. Because if f dashed is bounded, then the dual integral of f certainly converges. And so a corollary, instant corollary to Carlson's theorem is that if he is a Carlson set on the unit circle, then you can find a function in the Dirichlet space that has e as its zero set. Okay, so is that, that's certainly a sufficient condition. Is it necessary? It was necessary for a one, but is it necessary for the Dirichlet space? And the answer is no. And indeed, there is a second theorem that gives another source of zero sets, again due to Carlisle.
00:14:19.370 - 00:15:15.976, Speaker B: And later on, it was improved by Brown and Kern. So, if in this theorem, we assume that e is a closed subset of capacity zero, and then, once again, you can find a function in the Dirichlet space and continuous up to the boundary whose zero set is e. Now, at first sight, it's perhaps not quite clear what the relation between these two theorems is, but I want to emphasize that neither of these results implies the other. You can certainly have Carlson sets that are of positive capacity. So an example of such a thing would be the, the cantor middle third set. That's an example of a well wrapped around the circle. Of course, that's an example of a Carlasson set, and it's certainly not capacity zero.
00:15:15.976 - 00:16:16.840, Speaker B: The standard cantor middle third has positive capacity. In the other direction, you can even have a countable compact set, which will certainly be of capacity zero, which is not a Carlasson set. So really, the second theorem is a theorem about size. The constraint is a constraint on the size of e. And the first theorem, the hypothesis is really a hypothesis, not just on the size of e, because certainly e has to have measure zero, but on the way that e is distributed. And, well, that's kind of the still the state of the art. I'll just mention here that if e has positive, the bait measure, then e is a boundary uniqueness set for d, because it is even for the Hardy space.
00:16:16.840 - 00:17:09.890, Speaker B: That's almost obvious. If you have a set function in your, in the hardy space that vanishes its radial boundary limits vanish on a set of positive measure, then f must be zero. But what's perhaps a bit surprising is that there are uniqueness sets, closed uniqueness sets of measure zero for the dirichlet space, that doesn't happen for the hydra space. And an example of such a thing you can get by taking the cantor, I think the Cantor middle third set will do, and taking accountable number of rotating copies of that and forming their union. And the rotations have to be just the right angles. And that ends up being a closed. If your rotations tend to a limit, then the resulting set is closed measure zero, and you can do it in such a way that it's a uniqueness set for the differentiated space.
00:17:09.890 - 00:18:04.242, Speaker B: So this kind of hints that this is not an easy problem to solve in general. Okay, so now I want to return to the question of zero sets on the interior. And as I mentioned, arguments play a role. And here is a nice theorem from 1970 Cochrane. So, to try and put this in perspective, the theorems we saw earlier were attempting to categorize, classify zero sets, characterize zero sets, and judges their Moduli. So, trying to forget what Moduli will give rise to zero sets, irrespective of the choice of arguments. And this is kind of turning the situation on its head this year.
00:18:04.242 - 00:18:42.540, Speaker B: Here we're trying to find what arguments will give zero sets, irrespective of the Moduli. Well, that doesn't make sense because the Moduli must tend to one. Otherwise the set might even be discrete. And in fact, they have to turn to one fast enough for this series to converge, because we must satisfy the Blaschke condition. But subject to that, whenever we have a sequence of moduli that satisfy the Blaschke condition, suppose that the e to the I theta n give you a choice of arguments. That's always a zero set. When is that true? And Cochrane characterized such things.
00:18:42.540 - 00:19:19.124, Speaker B: And the answer is really beautiful. You look at the set of e to theta n, thought of as a subset of unit circle. Close it up. And the condition is that e should be one of these Coalescent sets. Once again, just to give an indication that the general problem is quite tricky, here's an example of a blaschki sequence. That's not a uniqueness, that is a uniqueness. Excuse me.
00:19:19.124 - 00:20:07.044, Speaker B: So the series sigma one minus mod zn is just sigma one over n log n squared, which converges. That's a Vladka sequence. But with this particular choice of arguments, you can show that the z ends are actually uniqueness separating. And, well, the end of the story, as far as I'm going to tell it, is that the problem is still open. This is a very difficult problem. It seems a lot of work has been done on it in various ways, but this is still an open problem, both zero sets in the interior and zero sets on the boundary. And, well, I just mentioned one other development that I think is interesting.
00:20:07.044 - 00:21:04.088, Speaker B: So I talked about a one of d. You might ask, what happens if you change a one for a two. So, functions whose first two derivatives belong to the disk algebra, what are their zero sets? It turns out that the answer doesn't change. Carlson proved that the Carlisle set condition is still necessary and sufficient, and that's actually not too difficult to see. And indeed, the same argument works for a n of d for any finite value of n. And the next step up is to go to a infinity of d, which is the set of functions holomorphic on d, such that all their derivatives extend continuously to the closure of the disk. And here it's much more subtle, because if you think about it, constructing functions with given zero sets means you need to find c infinity functions.
00:21:04.088 - 00:21:33.154, Speaker B: So a function all of whose derivatives vanish at a point which is not identically zero. So you're looking at functions on the unit circle that are not real analytic. And it turns out that the Carlos and set condition works even for this. This is a sufficient condition for zero sets. And this is. There are several papers that prove this, but the one that I know is a very interesting paper of Taylor and Williams from. From 1970.
00:21:33.154 - 00:22:31.910, Speaker B: Okay, so I think that's what I'm going to say about zero sense. Before I move on, are there any questions? I see there was one question in the chat which I've answered. Is there a conjecture for the zero set of Dirichlet spaces? Not that I know of. I think that's there's not even. Maybe someone else can correct me, but I'm not sure there's even a plausible candidate for what the right answer should be. Tom, I have a question. Yes? Did you say that a zero set for a infinity of d on the boundary, not only the function is zero, but all of its derivatives are zero? Yes, because if the function is set.
00:22:31.910 - 00:23:04.926, Speaker B: Okay, so suppose the set take a point in the set that's not an isolated point. Then obviously the function itself must vanish at this point. So take a point in that set that's not isolated. The function itself must vanish at that point. But since there's a sequence of other points tending to that point where the function vanishes, its derivative must vanish as well, and so on and so forth. So all the derivatives will vanish. I see.
00:23:04.926 - 00:23:41.278, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you, Tom. Okay, so let's head on to the next chapter. And this is on multipliers. So these were already mentioned in Jonathan's talk yesterday. So the very first remark to be made is that the Dirichlet space is not an algebra. So the product of two functions in the Dirichlet space need not, again, doesn't necessarily have to be in the Dirichlet space.
00:23:41.278 - 00:24:18.554, Speaker B: It's not that difficult to construct explicit examples. But I'm going to show you an abstract argument because it's useful for something else that will come later. So here's one of my very few proofs. So suppose it were an algebra. Then there's a fairly easy argument involving the closed graph theorem to show that multiplication has to be jointly continuous with respect to the norm. And so d would be isomorphic to a Banach algebra. The norm doesn't have to be sub multiplicative, but it would have to be sub multiplicative up to a constant.
00:24:18.554 - 00:25:05.544, Speaker B: And once you have something that's isomorphic to a Banach algebra, well, you can consider the spectrum of an element, and it will always be a compact set. And for each z in the open unit disk, evaluation that z is a character on this algebra. And so, just by the general theory of balanc algebras, the value of this character at f has to be in modulus bounded by the spectral radius of f. And that works for each and every character. So it works for all z in the unit disk. In other words, f itself must be a bounded function. And one of the very first things I showed you yesterday was that not every function in the Dirichlet space is bounded.
00:25:05.544 - 00:25:51.354, Speaker B: So there we go. But if you don't like that, it's actually a nice little exercise to construct an explicit f, who's in the disk algebra, whose square is not in the disk algebra. Okay, so it's not an algebra, but so once you have something that's not an algebra, it's sort of natural to look at so called multipliers. So a multiplier is a function, the property that multiplication by that function leaves you in the algebra. So whenever f lies in d phi, f also belongs to d. And it's easy to see that the family of multipliers forms an algebra. And in fact, it's a banner algebra.
00:25:51.354 - 00:26:33.976, Speaker B: With respect to the multiplier norm. I'm not sure if I've written that somewhere. But anyway, if you think of the operation of multiplication by phi as an operator on d by the closed graph theorem, it's a bounded linear operator, and the operator norm of that operator is the so called multiplier norm of phi. And with respect to that norm, the multipliers form a banner congebra. So you can do this, in fact, for any function space. And in the case of the Hardy space, it's very easy to identify what the multiplier algebra is. It's h infinity.
00:26:33.976 - 00:27:27.424, Speaker B: Multiplication by a bounded homomorphic function leaves you inside h two, and it's not very hard to convince yourself that these are the only possible multipliers. So what about the Dirichlet space? What are the multipliers there? Well, there's a necessary condition. Actually, there are two necessary conditions. First, one is very easy, because if phi is a multiplier, then in particular, multiplying the constant function one, which is certainly in the Dirichlet space by phi must leave you in the Dirichlet space. So phi itself has to be in the Dirichlet space, no choice. And not only that, but phi has to be bounded. And actually, it's almost the same argument that I gave you just a moment ago.
00:27:27.424 - 00:28:15.810, Speaker B: The algebra of multipliers is a Banach algebra, and evaluation at any point of the unit disk is a character on that algebra. And so if you evaluate phi at any point, the, the result has to be bounded by the, the spectral radius of phi in this multiplier algebra. And so phi itself must be a bounded function. So if I put these two conditions together, you get just one necessary condition, which is that phi, if it's a multiplier, it must belong to the intersection of the, of d with h infinity. And actually this d intersect h infinity. It is itself a Banach algorithm. It's quite easy to check, and you could be forgiven for thinking that this necessary condition is also sufficient.
00:28:15.810 - 00:28:59.074, Speaker B: It's a very plausible thing, but it's false. And I haven't included an example. But you can construct a very explicit example, a phi that lies in this intersection and an f in the derivative space with a property that when you multiply the two together, you're no longer in the Dirichlet space. It's a, it's a direct calculation, a rather messy one. But I just ask you to believe me that this necessary condition is actually not sufficient. There is a very easy sufficient condition, which is that phi prime should be bounded. That's just a very direct check.
00:28:59.074 - 00:29:30.044, Speaker B: But in order to characterize completely multipliers, we like to have a necessary and sufficient condition. I'm going to introduce another notion which turns out to be useful for all sorts of other things as well. So it's well worth doing. And it's that man CArlson again. Carlson measure. So, I'll explain on the next slide where Carlson himself comes into this. But here is the definition.
00:29:30.044 - 00:30:28.232, Speaker B: So, a measure on the unit disk is a positive measure, is a Carlasson measure for the Dirichlet space. If there exists a constant c with a property that for any function in the Dirichlet space, the l two norm of f with respect to this measure, is controlled by the Dirichlet norm of f. Another way, actually, an equivalent way of saying the same thing, which is probably even quicker to say, is quite simply that nu is a Carlasson measure for the douche leisure space if the Dirichlet space is contained in l two of mu. Because if the Dirichlet space is contained in L two of mu, then the inclusion map has to be continuous. This is a closed graph theorem, again. And to say that the inclusion map is continuous is exactly the statement that I've written here. But I think, in practice, what one really uses all the time is this inequality.
00:30:28.232 - 00:30:58.244, Speaker B: So I thought it was worth defining it that way. Okay, so I'll explain on the next slide what this has to do with Carlson. But just let me come back to the question of multipliers and explain why this helps us with the problem of characterizing multipliers. We have the following proposition. So, phi is a multiplier if and only if, satisfies two conditions. First of all, it should be an h infinity. We've already seen that that's a necessary condition.
00:30:58.244 - 00:31:39.162, Speaker B: And secondly, mod phi dash squared d area is a Carlson measure for the Derich layer space. And I didn't actually write out a proof of this proposition, but actually, you can do it in your head. It's very easy. How does one check that phi is a multiplier? Well, we need to take an f in the Dirichlet space and prove that phi f also belongs to the Dirichlet space. So, calculate the Dirichlet integral of phi f. What do you get? Well, if you do that calculation, you differentiate the product phi f, and, well, this is really deep stuff. The product, the derivative of the product, is phi dashed f plus f phi.
00:31:39.162 - 00:32:19.804, Speaker B: And so you need to check that both of these things, a square integral. So one of the integrals is very easy. The mod f mod phi squared. Mod f dash squared is integrable because mod phi squared is bounded and mod f dash squared is integral because f was originally in the derision space. That's easy. And the other term you get is the integral of mod f squared, mod phi dash squared da. And proving that that is bounded or finite boils down exactly to saying that if you plug d nu equals mod phi dash squared da in here, that you get something that's finite.
00:32:19.804 - 00:32:47.464, Speaker B: So, this is exactly the condition of being a colorless measure. So, I don't know, I probably should have written something out. But if you follow that, it really is easy. So hopefully solve the problem. Well, not really, because we're now left with the problem of how to characterize Carlisle measures. This is a question that's of interest not just for the problem of multipliers, but for other things as well. So, it's a worthwhile question to study.
00:32:47.464 - 00:33:26.884, Speaker B: Now, the Carlson measures are so called because they were originally introduced by Carlson in the context of hardy spaces as part of his proof of the Corona theorem. And in fact, what he showed was that. So if I. Sorry, I'm just going to go back one, one. Slide. So, a Carlos, a measure for h two would simply be the same condition. But instead of taking Dirichlet norm, you take the h two norm here.
00:33:26.884 - 00:34:13.824, Speaker B: And he showed that there was a nice geometric characterization of these colors and measures for h two. And here it is. So you look at so called colors and boxes. So, a coliseum box is a thing like I've drawn on this picture here. So you have a certain an arc I on the unit circle. And then you go in the part of the sector that I subtends, and you choose it so that this length here, this length here, the length you go in is either equal to or in some cases, just proportional to the length of I. So it's a sort of roughly a square.
00:34:13.824 - 00:35:12.926, Speaker B: And so the formal definition is what I've written here. And Carlson showed that nu satisfies this CArLSOn condition that we had on the previous slide for h two, if and only if mu of any Carlson box is bounded by some fixed constant times the length of the box, side length of the box. And actually, in many in the literature, often this characterization is taken as the definition of Carlisle measure. But I prefer to do it the way around I've done it because for our purposes, it's more appropriate. Okay, so that gives us a readily verifiable geometric condition to be a Carlasson measure. But that's for the Hardy space. What happens for the Dirichlet space? Well, there is a result that has the same general form.
00:35:12.926 - 00:36:01.714, Speaker B: And this is a theorem due to Andrew Wynn, who was a graduate student at Oxford at the time he did this. So, he looked at a similar type of condition. So, you look at a measure, mu, on the unit disk, and you look at the value of the measure on a Carlson box, and you suppose that it's controlled by some function, psi, of the length of I. And if you take Psi to be this function, one over log, one over x, that gives you a necessary condition for mu to be a Carlson measure for the Dirichlet space. And if you take Psi to be this more complicated thing, that is sufficient. It's probably not terribly clear, but the, the whole of this long expression here is in the denominator. So it's one over all this stuff.
00:36:01.714 - 00:36:36.098, Speaker B: And there is a gap between these two. Notice I've written alpha is greater than one. And it really is that. I mean, if you take psi to be equal to this function with some alpha between zero and one, then the condition is neither necessary nor sufficient. So there is a genuine gap here. So, this is a nice condition, or two nice conditions, but they don't tell the whole story. Maybe for certain purposes, they're good enough.
00:36:36.098 - 00:37:34.176, Speaker B: But if you want a result that actually gives you a complete characterization, well, you need to formulate the hypothesis a bit differently, and the situation becomes more complicated. So, I'm going to show you one such result, and then I'll mention a few others in passing. So, this is a characterization I think actually goes back 1980. So, he showed that mu is a Carlson measure for the Dirichlet space if and only if it satisfies the following condition. So, instead of looking at one, excuse me, instead of looking at one arc, you look at a finite number of disjoint arcs, I one up to in, and you form the corresponding galos and boxes. They'll be disjointed. And you look at Mu of the union of those things.
00:37:34.176 - 00:38:01.424, Speaker B: So that's not a problem, because they're destroyed. So Mu of the union is the sum of the MU's. That's, that's easy enough to handle. But where things get more complicated is on the other side of the inequality. So this has to be controlled by the logarithmic capacity of the union. And it's not true that the capacity of the union is the sum of the capacities. It's bounded above by that sum, but it's not equal to the sum.
00:38:01.424 - 00:39:08.914, Speaker B: And this makes this a very difficult condition to use, because you can compute the capacity of one arc there's a formula for that in terms of the length. But once you start looking at two or more arcs, the capacity depends not just on the lengths of the arcs, but on the way that they're distributed, and it becomes a very complicated story. So this is not the only such characterization. There are some others, and I'll come back and mention them at the end of the chapter. But rather than spending too long on that, I want to instead go back to multipliers, which was the motivating question and indicator. Another approach to multipliers, which I would say has been more fruitful in the recent past and doesn't depend on trying to characterize them explicitly. In order to do that, I need to explain a little bit the connection between multipliers and reproducing kernels.
00:39:08.914 - 00:40:32.674, Speaker B: So in general, reproducing kernel Hilbert space is just the space, Hilbert space of functions on some set with a property that evaluation at any point of that set is a continuous linear functional. And so in particular, this is true of the Dirichlet space, because if you take a function of Dirichlet space and look at evaluation at some point of the open unit disk that is continuous with respect to the Dirichlet norm, and just by the Ries representation theorem for Hilbert spaces continuously neo functionality is given by taking the inner product with some suitably chosen element of your Hilbert space. So in the case of the Dirichlet space, if I fix the w in the disk f of w, evaluating f of w is a linear functional of f, which is given by taking the inner product of f with some truths is a chosen element of the duh sheet space, which I'll denote by kw. And in the case of the initial space, you can actually compute exactly what this is. It's not very difficult, and it's this formula here. If I were in the hardy space, the reproducing kernel would simply be what's inside the bracket here, one over one minus w bar z. And the fact we were in the Duish lay space brings in, as always, a log.
00:40:32.674 - 00:41:39.944, Speaker B: At any rate, this function is called the reproducing kernel for the point w. And there's a very simple relation between multipliers and reproducing kernels given by the following proposition. I'm picking up some unwanted sound. Can you switch off your mic please? Thank you. So the proposition says that if phi is a multiplier, the divisional space, and we define the multiplication operator by this formula. I mentioned earlier that on a closed graph theorem, this is a bounded linear operator, then the for any w, the reproducing kernel a w, this is an element of our derivative space. It's an eigenvector of the adjoint of m phi, and the value of phi conjugated w is the corresponding eigenvalue.
00:41:39.944 - 00:42:19.484, Speaker B: And this is a proposition with a one line proof. So I'm going to show you the proof. Well, I guess two lines, but the essential part of the proof is one line. So take any f in the Dirichlet space and calculate its inner product with the adjoint of m phi applied to kw. So just letting m phi hop over to the other side of the inner product, we get m phi f, which is just phi times f. And then that's the first equality. The second equality comes from the property that the reproducing kernel has in a product.
00:42:19.484 - 00:42:56.874, Speaker B: Against that, evaluate the function at w. And now essentially I reverse all those steps, but leaving the phi of w at the beginning untouched. So I write f of w as the inner product of f with kw. And then finally the phi w I bring back into the second factor, which means I have to put a bar on top of it and I get this equality, and it holds for all f in the division space. So the two terms on the right of the inner product must coincide. And that's it. Okay, well, that's kind of cute.
00:42:56.874 - 00:43:55.004, Speaker B: And actually, if you think about it a bit, we haven't really used any complex analysis in this. It's, it would work. For an arbitrary reproducing Colonel Hilbert space, exactly the same argument would work. And what's really remarkable is that, in a sense, this characterizes multipliers, because if you start off with a bounded operator on your reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and this operator has the reproducing kernel as its eigenvectors, then there's just essentially about running the argument backwards. You can prove that this operator must be the adjoint of the multiplication by some multiplier. This gives a way of getting your hands on multipliers that's really rather simple and doesn't depend on being able to characterize them explicitly. This is an extremely powerful technique, and it's just based on this very simple proposition.
00:43:55.004 - 00:44:59.444, Speaker B: I want to show you some applications of these ideas. So the first one is to so called pick interpolation. So if we're given an interval of points and unit disk and an interval of target values. Well, in the classic pick theorem, you ask whether there is a holomorphic function mapping the disk to itself that interpolates the z so maps z j to wj. So you can think of this as being a sort of hardy space version, where instead of thinking of phi as a map from the unit disk to itself, think of it as being a map in h infinity with h infinity norm at most one. Of course, it's the same thing, but thought of that way, it allows a generalization to Dewish way space, where we replace h infinity, which, remember, was the multiplier algebra of the Hardy space. We replace it by the multiplier algebra of the Dewish way space.
00:44:59.444 - 00:46:03.734, Speaker B: And you end up with the following formulation. Can we find an interpolating function which is a multiplier of multiply null at most one? And. Excuse me, the answer lost my voice. Excuse me. So the theorem is that you can do this if and only if this matrix is positive, semi definite. And if I compare with what happens in the Hardy space case, where the reproducing kernel is particularly simple, this inner product would simply be the value of k of zi at the point z j, and would correspond to having a one minus z I bar zj in the denominator. You end up with a very familiar pick condition for being able to solve the classical pick problem.
00:46:03.734 - 00:47:07.138, Speaker B: And so, actor's theorem is a direct generalization of that. And, well, I certainly don't have time to go into the proof, but the necessity part actually is a very short argument using the proposition we had just on the previous slide about relating multipliers and reproducing kernels. The sufficiency depends on specific form of the Dirichlet kernel. And I think I'm right in sort of saying that originally Agla did this in the case of the Dirichlet space. It also appears in the paper of Marshall and Sundberg at around the same time. And then rather quickly it, it was realized that there was an abstract property of the kernel, so called complete pick property, which one can characterize in abstract terms, which allows you to do this in much greater generality. So the Dergishlake kernel is an example of a kernel with the pick property.
00:47:07.138 - 00:48:20.460, Speaker B: But there's a sort of general theory which allows you to do this for rather general families of reproducing Colonel Hilbert spaces. Let me just rather quickly mention the problem of interpolation, interpolating infinite interpolating sequences. So again, there's a famous theorem of Carliston that characterizes interpolating sequences in unit disks. Interpolating sequence is simply one such that given any bounded sequence of target values, you can interpolate by a bounded function on that interpolating sequence and the analog for the Dirichlet space do the same thing with replacing h infinity by the multiplier algebra. And there's a theorem that gives you, that characterizes these sequences. It was proved by Marshall and Sundberg, using ideas again very close to what I've been talking about. Bishop gave another proof, and neither of these people, neither of these two teams actually published their results.
00:48:20.460 - 00:49:06.924, Speaker B: And then there was a simpler published proof by Berwyn in 2005. So, the condition is, there are actually two conditions. There's a condition in terms of Carlson measure and a sort of separation condition. I'm running out of time, so I'm going to skip over rather quickly to the last slide. I just want to mention an application of these ideas to factorization theorems. So the say f is a cyclic function for the duration a space. If, when you look at, when you multiply f by all possible multipliers, then you get something that's dense in the jewish layer space.
00:49:06.924 - 00:49:50.784, Speaker B: I'm going to come back and discuss cyclic functions in more detail tomorrow, but just for the purposes of this statement of these theorems, I just need to define it here. It's sort of obvious that cyclic implies that the function is non vanishing everywhere. Because if ever f vanished at some point, then clearly whenever you multiply by something, the product would vanish at the same point, and there would be no hope of getting a dense sort of functions in the Dirichlet space. So, psychic implies nowhere vanishing. The converse is false. And as I said, I'm going to come back and discuss this in rather more detail tomorrow. And in fact, in the case of the Hardy space, cyclic functions are characterized exactly as being the outer functions.
00:49:50.784 - 00:50:46.274, Speaker B: So the, the two notions are interchangeable. In the Hardy space case, this is again a consequence of Berling's inner outer factorization. So, I just want to mention here two factorization results that are rather recent and that were proved using this general circle of ideas about reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and complete pick kernels. So, the first is a sort of rough analog of inner outer factorization that says that any function in the Dirichlet space can be factored as a product of a multiplier and a cyclic function. So, in the Hardy space, the cyclic would be outer multiplier doesn't quite correspond to inner, it corresponds to bounded. But at least the idea is the same. We're sort of separating out the zeros and the multiplier part.
00:50:46.274 - 00:51:58.244, Speaker B: And secondly, there's a theorem of these four people, Allemanharts, Picasso, Richter, that gives a different type of factorization. Also very interesting that in the Dirichlet space, you can write f as a quotient of two multipliers, with the denominator being cyclic. And the analogue to think of here is what happens in the Hardy space is that you can write any Hardy space function as the quotient of two h infinity functions, where the denominator is outer. This is so called Smirnov factorization, and the exact analog of this works in the Du space as well. And what I think is really remarkable about these results is that, I mean, they were not previously known, even for the very special case of the Dirichlet space. But the proofs go through for very general reproducing Colonel Hilbert spaces with this complete pick property and actually the jury Martin result. What they proved is vastly more general than what I've stated here.
00:51:58.244 - 00:52:43.250, Speaker B: You can do much more than what I've said, but I wanted to keep things simple, so I apologize to them for oversimplifying their results. And here is a nice corollary of this last factorization. This was also known before, but it's still. It comes out rather easily. If we're given a function in the Dirichlet space, then there is a multiplier that has exactly the same zero set. And it's obvious, because if you write f as a quotient of two multipliers, well, the numerator will have exactly the same zero set as that. And so that's something that wasn't altogether obvious at the beginning, but it has the consequence that the union of 20 sets is, again, a zero set.
00:52:43.250 - 00:53:39.034, Speaker B: What's the natural way to prove that? Well, you take a function that has 10 set. Is it zero set? You take another function, has the other one, and multiply them together, and the result is a function whose zero set is the union of the two. But to know that the product of the two functions again belongs to the Dirichlet space, you better know that one of them is a multiplier. And that's what this corollary gives you. And so, just to finish with, I didn't have time to discuss, there are other characterizations of multipliers and cows and measures using double integrals. These were investigated in detail by Arkatsi, Rochberg and Soyuz. I once remarked jokingly to someone that I was always getting the inequality the wrong way around for Garlson measures.
00:53:39.034 - 00:54:18.964, Speaker B: And I was told that, quite seriously, there are things, measures where the reverse inequality is interesting, and they're called reverse Carlisle measures. And there's an article on these in their applications, a survey article by and Ross. And finally, one other thing I didn't have time to discuss here, but again, by analogy with h infinity, you might wonder if there's an analogue of the corona problem theorem, I should say. And indeed there is, and these are the references for it. So I've overrun by five minutes. I'm sorry about that. But anyway, thank you for your attention.
00:54:20.904 - 00:54:35.474, Speaker A: Thank you, Tom. Let's thank the speaker. I think there are two remarks or question on the chat. We have a little bit of time.
00:54:37.934 - 00:54:42.958, Speaker B: So there's one. What is the motivation behind this problem? Which problem is that?
00:54:43.126 - 00:54:46.114, Speaker A: I think it's referring to the interpolation problem.
00:54:46.974 - 00:54:48.114, Speaker B: Oh, okay.
00:54:51.214 - 00:54:53.174, Speaker A: Well, there is a whole industry for that.
00:54:53.214 - 00:55:38.784, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, this is something that people have studied in detail for h infinity. And so the problem that I stated was the natural problem for the natural analog for the Dirichlet space. Naishenka has a characterization of interpolating sequences for the upper half plane. Well, I guess this is a Mobius invariant thing, so I guess you can just move it to the disk. I don't think there's much you have to rephrase the condition for Carlisle measures, but I don't think that it's any different in the upper half plane, because the whole question is, maybe it's invariant.
00:55:40.964 - 00:55:44.384, Speaker A: Tom, could you please share one more time your PDF file?
00:55:44.924 - 00:56:03.364, Speaker B: Yes, certainly. There it is. Any other questions?
00:56:06.304 - 00:56:22.874, Speaker C: I have just. I think that the two pre prints of Sandberg, Marcian and Sandberg and bishop are from the same year, aren't they? 1994, I think.
00:56:26.814 - 00:56:41.662, Speaker B: I was looking at this the other day, and Bishop is certainly 94. Marshall Sonberg I'm not too sure about. I kind of, for some reason, I had two dates. I mean, they would know better. They're the people who are important.
00:56:41.798 - 00:56:44.784, Speaker C: Yes, very beautiful preparing.
00:56:44.974 - 00:56:45.744, Speaker B: Yes.
00:56:47.604 - 00:56:49.824, Speaker C: Very different from.
00:56:51.164 - 00:56:53.024, Speaker D: I have a question, if I may.
00:56:53.404 - 00:56:54.144, Speaker B: Please.
00:56:55.724 - 00:57:34.484, Speaker D: You had the characterization of the multipliers in terms of being a Carlos, also being a carousel measure for the f prime squared, being a Carlos measure, in the case of the hardy space, these conditions means that phi is in bmO. So is in the dual of h one. Is there a description, a characterization of being phi, prime squared correspond as phi being the dual of d one or something?
00:57:39.044 - 00:57:41.024, Speaker B: I'm not sure I fully understand.
00:57:43.684 - 00:58:12.050, Speaker D: So here, suppose you take. You define d one as the space of function, as the derivative. Is the l one integrable? And then you take this dual. Then my question, if this condition on the colors of measure is equivalent saying the phi is in the dual d one. So the space so defined.
00:58:12.202 - 00:58:12.658, Speaker B: Right.
00:58:12.746 - 00:58:15.554, Speaker D: It's an analogy with the Hardy space situation.
00:58:15.714 - 00:58:23.802, Speaker B: Right. So the short answer to that is, I don't know, but there are probably people listening in who do. So.
00:58:23.818 - 00:58:29.810, Speaker C: I'm sorry, I don't know if I can try it. Is it Marco?
00:58:30.002 - 00:58:31.334, Speaker D: Yeah, this is me.
00:58:34.694 - 00:59:07.824, Speaker C: No, there is an analog. You can define a kind of h one space as the weak product of the Dirichlet space with itself. Weak product in the sense of Weiss and others. And then the doer can be identified with functions also that the derivative mod square is a carousel measure.
00:59:08.324 - 00:59:09.092, Speaker B: Okay.
00:59:09.228 - 00:59:11.904, Speaker C: And this is also related to ankle operators.
00:59:12.284 - 00:59:16.824, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah. So. Yeah, but you have to take those weak products space.
00:59:17.164 - 00:59:19.624, Speaker C: Right. Weak product and not product.
00:59:20.204 - 00:59:23.584, Speaker D: Okay, thank you.
00:59:24.964 - 00:59:51.640, Speaker B: I see this. We've sort of overrun our time, but there is a question in the chat that I could answer very quickly. So it was asked, do we have a similar factorization theorem for D mu? So I assume here. D mu. You mean the Mu is. These are the Dirichlet spaces with either harmonic or super harmonic weights. And the answer is yes, because these spaces are also examples of spaces that have the complete pick property.
00:59:51.640 - 00:59:57.284, Speaker B: So exactly the same technology will prove these factorization theorems.
01:00:01.784 - 01:00:08.624, Speaker A: Thank you, Tom. Let's thank Tom again. Sorry, you went a bit too.
