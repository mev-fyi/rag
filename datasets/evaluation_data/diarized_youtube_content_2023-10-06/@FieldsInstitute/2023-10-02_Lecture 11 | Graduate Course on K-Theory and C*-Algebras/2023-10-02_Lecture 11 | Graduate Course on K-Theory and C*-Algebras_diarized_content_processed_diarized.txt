00:00:00.560 - 00:00:54.194, Speaker A: Any, um, any question? Probably that. Probably that means there are lots of questions. This is, uh, there's a zero one law. There's a zero one law for questions. I think everyone familiar with probability theory. Do you know what the zero one law is? Okay, well, it says that typically your probability is either zero or one. Will you please remind me of your name? Let me just run through quickly, Houston, and jump.

00:03:50.658 - 00:04:49.904, Speaker A: Oh, hi. Yeah, he's an Ottawa, I believe. Could be on sometimes on the. Okay, well, one of the ideas in this course. Well, why doesn't someone. Does someone want to suggest what one of the ideas in the course is? Jack, what is one of the ideas in the course? Okay, yeah. And don't forget.
00:04:49.904 - 00:05:13.564, Speaker A: Don't forget this. This is k theory. Linear algebra is k theory. Right. But, um, Abu, this reminds me of your name. I'm sorry? Akha Prabha. Okay.
00:05:13.564 - 00:05:47.960, Speaker A: I get a boost when I call it out and someone answers. But I guess you just came. You just arrived. Good. So, Arka Prabha, what is the main fact. What's the way of stating the main fact in linear algebra closest to this course? Well, that. Right, okay.
00:05:47.960 - 00:06:20.566, Speaker A: Have a basis. Have a unique basis. Unique cardinality in the basis. But. And how is that related to the course? Yes. Okay, good. Okay, but you're making us bit of a song and dance out of it, which is good.
00:06:20.566 - 00:06:39.630, Speaker A: Okay, no, this is very good. But there's also a one word. There's a one word way of connecting the two. Okay, one word, one letter. One. Yes. Okay.
00:06:39.630 - 00:07:13.254, Speaker A: Larry or Lawrence. Okay. Okay, so what's the one word, one letter? What's the one letter? How does I come in? Capital I or small I? How does that come in? Okay, all right, good. Okay, good. But what I'm thinking of is two choices for the single letter, either k or Z. Okay, how does that. How does that sound, that's the.
00:07:13.254 - 00:08:12.474, Speaker A: Yeah, right. And what about the converse? Suppose you assume, just assume that zoom. Assume that K zero, however it's defined, well, properly defined of a field is Z as a group. Okay. But with no semi group in sight. Can you, can you prove what the, can you prove the semigroup is what you were going to say? What you were saying? That's an exercise I've been jumping up and down on, and I just sent an email right now, by the way, pointing out to people that if they want, they could do one every week, they could do one less of the exercises that Mister Lau was proposing from the book. His judgment for choosing exercises is extremely good.
00:08:12.474 - 00:08:33.378, Speaker A: Anyone want to know why? Anyone want to know why or how have we got such good judgment? Yes. Yes. Yeah. Okay. How did you know? You actually. Right, okay, okay, good. So I guess he's in as good a position as anyone to suggest individual problems.
00:08:33.378 - 00:10:30.794, Speaker A: Of course he would choose the ones he found the most difficult. Right, okay, but then what I'm suggesting is that you, instead of one of the ones in between difficulty, or maybe even one of the easy ones, if you want to make life more interesting, instead of do one of the ones that come up in class, like for instance, assume that you're talking about a field and that K zero group is, is isomorphic as a group, just as an abelian group to the group of integers Z. Okay, and can you approve from that? Can you approve the basic fact of a linear algebra in the form that the semigroup, what I like to think of as the Murray von Neumann semi group is of isomorphism classes and in Larry's approach, of finitely generated vector spaces, but that semigroup is just z plus. Once you know that, then you can prove that every basis, every finite basis for a vector space, a fixed vector space, has the same number of elements. Okay, but that's a good exercise, too. The whole business of linear algebra as a, as a spin off from the course, if you like, that would be good for either extended exercise or. So we figured that 14 times, 13 different sections for the exercise, right? Because it's the ordered pairs, a implies b, where a and b are arbitrary fundamental facts in linear algebra.
00:10:30.794 - 00:11:31.768, Speaker A: So of course, you just, what you do is you just stick a pin in, you write them all down. You could just do it, imagine them all and stick a pin and pick out one. Improve, do that and then maybe do the implications, both directions on that one, because. Because one of them might be easier than the other. Okay, so that's always fun if you want to prove two things are equivalent, then as a warm up, you try and choose which is the easiest implication, which is the easier of the two implications. Usually they're not equally difficult. Have I told the story about Alan Kahn's epoch making paper which proved classification for amenable feminine algebraically? Okay, so he was a very amenable two one factor.
00:11:31.768 - 00:12:19.856, Speaker A: That's a phonemon algebra with a trace where it's not finite dimensional, and a unique trace every two one factor, which is amenable in the sense of an amenable group. Don't worry too much. But that is approximately finite dimensional. You can approximate it by finite dimensional subalge in a natural way, very natural way. Okay, so this had been open for well over, for over 50 years. Open for 50 years time of marine, fundamentally. So, okay, so he, what he did is introduce a lot of new properties, okay? Because he wanted to do a tour de force.
00:12:19.856 - 00:12:38.368, Speaker A: Well, that's the only way he could prove the term. But I'm not even giving away too much from the story. Okay, so he had property number one, which was approximately finite dimensional. Okay, that was what the, that was what you wanted to end up with. But he started with it. So that implies property number two. That was easy.
00:12:38.368 - 00:12:54.828, Speaker A: Property number two implies number three. That's easy. It goes all the way down the list. I forget how many there were in this epoch making paper. Okay, that's terrible. I couldn't. So sometimes I say seven, sometimes I say 14, but it gets all the way down to the end.
00:12:54.828 - 00:13:24.632, Speaker A: Okay, easy, all the way. And then he says, well, now it's a difficult step to get from the end back to the beginning. That's difficult. But he's french, right? And the French have their own sense of humor. So he, in the paper, you can look it up. He proves number 14, if that's what it is. Number 14 implies number 13.
00:13:24.632 - 00:13:40.184, Speaker A: Difficult. Number 13 implies number twelve. Difficult. Number twelve implies number eleven. Okay? And now all the way back down to number one. Okay, that's how it goes. So.
00:13:40.184 - 00:14:40.064, Speaker A: And my point is, that's a good example of implications where one direction is easier than the other. Two equivalent statements. Well, repeat the name of the author. That's the same as the author of the fat book I'm carrying around all the time. Okay, Alan Con Connes. And it's, you know, I'm quite proud to mention that that paper was published, a paper of mine, for doing classification for af algebra, sort of the first step in classification of amenable c square algebra was published. Both papers were published in the same year, 1976.
00:14:40.064 - 00:16:07.004, Speaker A: And there was also another important paper in operator algebra published by, in that same year, 1976, by Brown Douglas and Fillmore. Fillmore being a canadian mathematician at Dalhousie University, Browning Purdue University. And Rowan Douglas recently died, but he was. That's Tony Brooke and then at Texas A and M as senior administrator. Well, okay, so that's. I'm suggesting that you would be good to do to work over the relationship between linear algebra and K theory and also in particular, prove that if you just know what k zero of a field is as a group, then you can deduce, you can get back to more familiar territory by describing, by establishing what the. Deducing, what the semi group is.
00:16:07.004 - 00:17:00.526, Speaker A: Okay, and another exercise, which I summarized again in my email, is the circle of ideas involving UHF algebra. And so this really is a circle. Supernatural category of supernatural numbers is form a counter set, by the way. Okay, that would be, that should be a natural part of the exercise. And then from there to UHF. Okay, this is, this is a, these are all categories from here to subgroups. Subgroups of the group of rational numbers containing the integers.
00:17:00.526 - 00:17:34.278, Speaker A: Okay, and then the function from here, back again through here. Okay, so these are three, these are three categories. They happen to be sets. And so, as it happens, the first two and the last two, it makes sense to say they're isomorphic because they're set, set by ejection. You have a set by ejection between them, preserving arrows and the arrows. What are the arrows in supernatural. Um, uh, Daniel, do.
00:17:34.278 - 00:17:57.354, Speaker A: Do you remember what the arrows are in super nas? Yeah, they have two. Suppose you have two supernatural numbers, n and n prime. And what's. How many arrows can you have between them? Sorry. Right. So there might be, uh. Might be one arrow, or there might be, um.
00:17:57.354 - 00:18:32.224, Speaker A: We might have an arrow in both directions, which means they would be equal. That's what isomorphic would mean. Okay, but you might have an arrow in just one direction, or you might not have any arrows at all. Okay, so that's what that category is. And this one, this category of subgroups of Q contain the integers. That's maybe even simpler. Think of, because it's just a bunch of subgroups and you assume that the integers are contained in them.
00:18:32.224 - 00:19:24.774, Speaker A: But then if you have subsets of a set, that's a subcategory, right, that's a category, because you can talk about inclusion, but have to check that those arrows are associative. Okay, you have a category, right. Okay. And then you have functors, maps, which preserve the homomorphisms, some respect to the arrow. Okay, arrows go into arrows and composition of arrows goes into composition of arrows and preserve in a way that preserves the composition. Just, just the way you have a map between two groups. Okay? Okay, so that's the twim classification term, okay, as formulated by Dixmere.
00:19:24.774 - 00:19:51.154, Speaker A: That's. And then Dixmere went farther. He said, look at, these are unito, UHFL. Well, I didn't say what the morphisms were here. Anyone want to recall that? Yes. Anyone? Yes. So morphisms a to a prime, taking the unit to the unit.
00:19:51.154 - 00:20:38.004, Speaker A: And so you have to construct. The assignment would be of. It's an essay, perhaps construct all of the arrows, all of the functions. Construct all the functions. Okay. And then, but then you're finished. Because if you have two UHF algebras and they give you the same and they're isomorphic, then they have the same supernatural number, which means that the.
00:20:38.004 - 00:21:04.226, Speaker A: And that which goes into the construction. Right? So two uHF algebra, they come from supernatural numbers. And what this does, you have to say, if you have, you have to say that going forwards and then coming back. Okay, that's the same, that's equal to the identity. It's equal to the identity here. So you start with a supernatural number. You construct the, uh, algebra.
00:21:04.226 - 00:21:23.278, Speaker A: You go down to the subgroup. And that's important how you get that. That was Dixba's trick. Going. Cleaning up what wim did. Okay, simplifying what wim did he got. And talking about the subject that once you have that, then it's just number three.
00:21:23.278 - 00:21:44.530, Speaker A: Completely elementary number three. To get a supernatural number. It turns out that if you wanted. This supernatural does have the property. It takes n to m sub n. And then the n, this mn goes into one over n times n. And then this goes back to n.
00:21:44.530 - 00:22:11.254, Speaker A: So that's the, that's the glim theorem. This would be a nice essay, I think. And that's before we even talk about the non unit location. Let's come back to the non unitful case later. So this is exercise one. I'll call them. I'll call them one e.
00:22:11.254 - 00:22:40.124, Speaker A: I'll put an e after them to distinguish them from Mister Lowe's exercises. E. E for me. Okay. And then the exercise two, e is the non unital case. Okay? Then exercise three, e. That's the af algebra case.
00:22:40.124 - 00:23:19.724, Speaker A: Okay? Which I'm going to talk about now. Af, standing for approximately finite dimensional. So of course a UHF algebra is approximately finite dimensional. Now this approximately business, um, in the. Completely in a purely algebraic setting that we've been talking about. There aren't any metrics, there aren't any approximations. What you say is that, well, it's algebraically, uh, uh, is algebraically Af, meaning it's just a union of finite dimensional, sub increasing union of finite dimensional.
00:23:19.724 - 00:24:13.464, Speaker A: And that's what the Af algebras were. The algebraic af algebra we'll talk about will be the union of increasing sequence of finite dimensional, finite direct sums of full matrix. Okay. Over the field in this setting, it doesn't matter what the field is in the algebraic setting, as long as you do say it's full matrix algebra. Okay, so we did touch on the Af function for the last time. I don't know if this is going to last. This one piece of chalk is going to last all four.
00:24:13.464 - 00:25:34.788, Speaker A: Okay. I always am worried when I come into a room that has things on the blackboard because I'm afraid that, I'm afraid to erase it because it might be useful. Okay, anyone see anything here that looks legally related? The circuit diagram. Okay, here's a circuit diagram. Must have been a computer science here, this room, because that's the closest thing I can think of in this building. But I didn't think that computer science dealt with actual down to earth electrical circuits. But when, when I was about nine years old, I had a piece of fiberboard which came in a set called brainiac, and you could wire up various following recipes in the set.
00:25:34.788 - 00:26:05.754, Speaker A: You could wire up various little things, circuits with light bulbs and stuff. It was quite fun. Okay. That's how I got to be able to recognize electrical circuit. A little later, I helped my father assemble a Heath kit amplifier. Okay. That, you can't get those anymore, but then later I assembled one myself.
00:26:05.754 - 00:27:03.464, Speaker A: The difference was first on the tubes and later when the fence didn't make any difference to me, I had just working with the soldering iron and the pliers. Okay. The first one is not operational anymore, but the second amplifier still is. So I had a, I had an accident with the FM section for the tuner, radial tuner. It's very delicate. You were warned about that. But the where you move the dial for the side back and forth between the tuning to a station.
00:27:03.464 - 00:27:25.600, Speaker A: There were a lot of light bulbs inside, and a couple of them or one or two of them were burned out. So I was sort of kicking the, I knew that would put the light back on again. So it did, but it blew out the FM receiver. Okay. But I. So I have a record player. I have a lot of records, too.
00:27:25.600 - 00:28:33.902, Speaker A: So almost good. Almost. Anyway, I mostly listen to the radio on my telephone now anyway, because it used to be on the television. But the latest upgrade of the television system doesn't include the PBS classical radio. Okay, so what do we want to talk about is what I'm suggesting we talk about now, the sequences, maybe we might as well assume they're increasing sequences of finite dimensional algebras, which are finite direct sums of matrix algebras. Over the, over the field will be the complex number. So for UHF algebra, remember, we could just draw a single point at each stage to represent the matrix algebra.
00:28:33.902 - 00:29:11.304, Speaker A: The spectrum of the algebra would be a single point. And here it's a finite sum spectrum is the union of the points. Don't worry what the spectrum is. This is just a schematic description of the representation of a dimensional output. You have this going to another one, going to another one, and so on. And these are different dots. Okay? All right.
00:29:11.304 - 00:29:54.252, Speaker A: And then I'm going into a. Well, you can't draw this one dramatically, as far as I know. An article in the AMS notice is one about two one factors that I was mentioning a while ago. Vaughn Jones, the late von Jones, drew a nice picture of a two one factor, okay? So this, this is a, um, this is a finite type one factor. That's what a full matrix algebra is. Finite type one factor. Type two factor means that has a trace, okay? I mean, it has infinite, infinite dimensional, but that has, it does have a trace.
00:29:54.252 - 00:31:16.444, Speaker A: Okay? So, um, because this has thoughtful faces of the funeral. Anyway, what drew with the circle, in other words, it's a black hole. Black hole in Zachary. And that was really quite accurate for his work, talking about, because what Kahn proved with this epoch making theorem was that if you have a sub factor, a subalgebra of a two one factor, which is also a factor, okay? Then it's the same one. It's isomorphic to the big one. If, in, in this amenable case, okay, in the amenable or approximately quantitative case, the sub algebra sub factor is always the same. But what von Jones set out to do then was look at how many different ways you could have this unique sub factor embedded in the big one, okay? And somehow working with this, he discovered what's now referred to as the Jones not polynomial.
00:31:16.444 - 00:32:34.444, Speaker A: And one thing led to another in particular. There was a, it was considered a field metal work. And also for Whitten, who adapted the, gave an explanation for the invariant in terms of point of view here. I guess I was probably not one day, okay? And these, these knot polynomials are really useful because you could, you could tell the difference between the knot tying up your left shoe and then not tying up your right shoe. Okay, the mirror images of each other, presumably that's how it should go, right? All right, but so we're talking about maybe it's solid a, you can think of it as the, maybe the layman algebra one should be a solid black. Maybe the, maybe the sister algebra one could just be like a newspaper. Like newspaper black.
00:32:34.444 - 00:33:55.898, Speaker A: Just a whole lot of dots. Okay? And what we want to do is classify these in the same way that, try to classify them in the same way that UHF algebra is classified. But those, the isomorphism classes are just cancer set, right? The supernatural numbers, they parameterize the isomorphism class of the VHF algebra. Now, when you go to the free floating algebra, which is what I meant by the non unitful case, okay, prediction, did another non unitful phase two. But you go to the free floating algebras, then the isomorphism classes are a little more complicated. You have to look at when two supernatural numbers give you the same floating algebra, you have the two algebras, mn and mn prime, okay? But then you let them float, meaning you put them inside infinite matrices. There's only finitely many non zero and they finitely many non zero entries.
00:33:55.898 - 00:34:16.534, Speaker A: So you can add and multiply them. We can always add them. Multiplying is a problem, general, but you don't, you don't look at the general case. If you took it to norm completion, then it's, it's, uh, you have all the attitudes, non zero. But, um. But that's, um. Matrices aren't necessarily the way to look at it then.
00:34:16.534 - 00:35:03.260, Speaker A: Okay, but, so that's a good exercise, too. That's the non unit case. How do you decide when to, when the two supernatural numbers, we just came up last time, I think so when do, um, when do this free free floating algebra give you the same. So mn and m time free floater, they're, they're isomorphic. Is equivalent to what relationship do n is equivalent to n prime? How. Okay, that's the equitable. It's an equivalent relation between n and m prime.
00:35:03.260 - 00:35:31.268, Speaker A: But the free floating algebra incident, matrix algebra are isomorphic as algebra. And of course, no unit gets preserved because we're not. You can't, it's cheating to keep track of the matrix description when you're looking at the abstract algebra. But there's a very simple relationship between ed and prime. Remind me of your name. I know it, but. Vincent.
00:35:31.268 - 00:36:00.700, Speaker A: Yeah. And, okay, but are you remembering from a previous discussion of which? Algebra. Okay, but you know, I didn't even mention that term, right? Okay, so. But that means you've been looking into it already by yourself? Yeah. Good. All right, maybe you can tell us. Well, two means.
00:36:00.700 - 00:36:39.686, Speaker A: Type two means that if it's two one, then that means it has an infinite dimensional. Okay, so. So if it's one sub n, where n is finite roman numeral one sub n, where n is finite, that's n by n matrices. Okay? And if it's one sub infinity, then that's infinite matrices, the matrix. The matrix of a bounded operator. Okay, on l two of the integer, maybe. But if you're wondering what the two one doctor is.
00:36:39.686 - 00:37:05.724, Speaker A: Well, to get an example, you may have. You could think about it. Okay, but Murray and von Neumann, when they were introducing. When they were introducing these, they first defined them before they knew there were any. And after a while, they found some. You might see if you can find one without looking it up. That means it has a trace and it's infinite dimensional.
00:37:05.724 - 00:37:54.364, Speaker A: And it's. And you can't break it up as the sum of two others. Like if you look at l infinity of the interval, then you can break that up as a sum of l infinity of the first half integral and the second half integral. And I mean, that does have a trace, infinite dimensional, it has a trace, namely just the vague integral, okay, not unique. So anyway, one. But important point is, how do you get such a t one factor? It turns out that you can get them from a UHF algebra, okay? And that's where Khan. Where Khan sort of, that's what he was doing.
00:37:54.364 - 00:39:08.452, Speaker A: Arbitrary, amenable one comes from a UHF in a natural way. So you can take a look at that, see if you can formulate that. But there are other constructions, too, completely independently of a UHF. Okay, so the question is, the next question to look at is, if you have two af algebras, a and a prime, then they're saying they're isomorphic. Is equivalent to what? Well, in one direction. One direction is easy. Okay, it's easy because we know what functors are, right? And the functor is something that takes any two isomorphic objects into isomorphic objects, right? Okay, so what's our favorite function? Yeah.
00:39:08.452 - 00:39:59.758, Speaker A: Okay, so take this is certainly implies the k naught a is isomorphic to a zero, a prime. And even as order groups, okay, order group means it's the enveloping group of a semigroup, which it is. Semigroup would be the positive cones. Positive. Only the order, order group. We don't have to know when something is positive? Because then something in general is less than or equal to something else. Charlie, do you know what that means in terms of the positive tone? You add something positive to something, you do anything, you get something larger.
00:39:59.758 - 00:40:47.676, Speaker A: Right? Okay, well, that's the definition of the order structure. So for order group, you only have to know what positive elements, or sometimes they call it partially ordered group. But the way I look at it, someone wants a group to be totally ordered, they'll say, so, okay? And there are a lot of other terms like pre ordered and subgroup. Ordered subgroup. So. And if you have to add the word partially, it very quickly becomes unwieldy. Anyway, when I was in first year, first year queen, maybe it was second year.
00:40:47.676 - 00:41:06.970, Speaker A: By that time, in those days, I learned that you had two kinds of relations. Two kinds of fundamental relations in mathematics. Equivalent relations and order relation. Okay? And they each had three axioms. Each had three. I can't hold it. Okay, three.
00:41:06.970 - 00:41:31.204, Speaker A: Three axioms. Okay, axiom one is the same for both. Everyone remember that. Well, just think about axiom two is the same for both, exactly the same. Axiom three is opposite, okay? One of them is symmetric, one of them is anti symmetric. And that's. And furthermore, you can go farther, because if you have the first two, that's called a pre order group.
00:41:31.204 - 00:42:08.804, Speaker A: But then if you simply tries it, you say something is related, x is related to y. If x is less than or equal to y, and y is less than or equal to x. Okay? Then look past. That's an equivalent solution, and it's an arbitrary equivalent relation. And you pass to the quotient, and that's an order, that's an order, order relation. Now on the quotient, and actually, I'm sorry, that's not an arbitrary. Before you pass to the quotient, it's not.
00:42:08.804 - 00:43:17.734, Speaker A: If you look at the quotient, it's an order relation. It's the thing that the symmetry is not arbitrary, not an arbitrary provincialization, because I have to think about that. But anyway. But this, this is, this is a really fundamental language in mathematics. Okay? You take, have, you have a pre order, pre order relation, then it gives you both an equivalent relation, which I think, instead of being arbitrary, and then the quotient improvements process, give you order relations is also arbitrary. And I don't know what started me on that, except every once in a while, someone corrects me according to their lexicon, you should say partially ordered. And I'm tempted to say, if I want it to be totally ordered, I'll say so.
00:43:17.734 - 00:43:53.264, Speaker A: But I may not even say so. It's irrelevant in a sense. Okay. But now I'm stalling because I'm waiting for someone to talk about the converse. Right? The converse is the classification theorem. It says that the functor on the category of Af algebra, say stable af algebra, it's pretty floating. You take a given af algebra and you float it, okay? Put it into the matrix, and the k zero group would be the same.
00:43:53.264 - 00:44:22.494, Speaker A: But now, if it had a unit, there's no special unit, no special element of the kg, so it's just an order group. Okay, and. All right, so it's not only a function. What kind of a function is it? Have a gil. Yeah, yeah. Classification function. This is, this is, you know, you can tell when I, when I start to wake up, that's where I, that's where I come in.
00:44:22.494 - 00:44:46.340, Speaker A: That's my cue. Okay. That's what I, that's what I like to talk about. I mean, it's not. I guess I could learn to talk about other things, too, but turns out that a lot of it's pretty hard to talk about anything. You know, this is my worldview. It's pretty hard to talk about anything which is not rather closely related to classification theory one way or another, so.
00:44:46.340 - 00:46:06.514, Speaker A: But by the way, I read non sifter algebra. Source that the main purpose of the human, the main function of the human brain is to sort things classify, okay? Usually in a good way, usually in a good way, useful way, important way. Okay? So the converse classification. Now, in the UHF setting, the proof, by the way, will be quite similar to the non unit UHF setting, the floating free floating uhf algebra. If you can, you can do those, then it'll be somewhat similar. Well, I'm speaking too soon maybe, but, um, let me, let me give you a short proof, summary of the proof, okay, of the. Quickly, proof that the k zeros are order isomorphic, isomorphic is order group.
00:46:06.514 - 00:47:21.274, Speaker A: Then the algebra isomorphic, okay, if you look at a one, a two, and so on, and you look at a one prime, a two prime, one prime, and you look at the k groups, by the way, the k zero preserves the limit, okay? Then you assume, you assume that there's an isomorphism between the k groups of a and a prime. So the first step is, you pull it back to an intertwining okay, of the k zero groups, finite stage k zero groups, you have to pass the subsequent. This is the first step. The second step is each one of these. For each one of these, up, down maps, down or up maps there's an algebra map, there's an algebra map that gives rise to it, okay? But it's not unique. Okay, it's not unique. That's the second step.
00:47:21.274 - 00:48:15.728, Speaker A: And you choose algebra maps to give you the k zero map. And for that you don't have to pass to, you don't have to pass to a subsequent. And at least, at least if you go unit, or if it's unit, or the unit gets preserved. Okay, well, then the third step is you modify, you're always free to modify any one of these maps by an inner automorphism, okay? So you do that using a uniqueness there. This was existence. You get the individual ups and downs, but to get the commutativity of the little triangles, you use uniqueness across and down. Up are two map between a one and a two.
00:48:15.728 - 00:48:58.110, Speaker A: They agree on k zero, so therefore they're unitarily equivalent. And the second triangle, you look at the new first, composing the whole up down, up by a single, with a single unitary, just changes this second arrow. Okay, so then you look at the second, so you don't change the first arrow. And then you look at this second triangle, and you go up the revised up arrow, and you go down, up down, and across. Those are, those are unitarian equivalent. You put in the second unitary and you're not changing the first. That only affects the second error.
00:48:58.110 - 00:49:40.624, Speaker A: The third error, it doesn't affect the up arrow. You just keep on going. That's the proof. Okay, so the third step was the third step. Third three is the exact step, and at the end you're finished, because you have a commutative diagram of homomorphism. It passes through, it's elementary, immediate, it passes through an isomorphism in the limit, okay, which is what we were looking for. And, okay, the only trouble with this, the reason I'm somewhat hesitant, I had to think twice before burning you, is this especially overtime.
00:49:40.624 - 00:50:34.544, Speaker A: Last time I did this at a meeting, not a class meeting, but international meeting, the late professor William B. Arverson, who has always been a supporter of mine, had always been a supporter of mine up to that point. He came up to me after the lecture and he said, if you do that again, I'm going to walk out. Okay, all right. So are we. Well, there's no one coming in right away, but I think, and, but we can, we can talk to anyone that has a few minutes and wants to talk for a bit. We can do that outside.
