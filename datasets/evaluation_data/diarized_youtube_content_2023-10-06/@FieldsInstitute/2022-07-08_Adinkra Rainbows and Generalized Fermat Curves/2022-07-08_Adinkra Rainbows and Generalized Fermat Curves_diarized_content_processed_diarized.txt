00:00:00.920 - 00:00:12.350, Speaker A: All right, our second and final speaker of the afternoon session is Ursula Witcher from math reviews, who will tell us about rainbows generalized chromophysics.
00:00:12.502 - 00:01:10.784, Speaker B: Hey, folks, it's so good to be here. Thanks for organizing, and thanks, everyone, for coming. I want to talk to you today about some work that I'm working on with Amanda Francis, who is also at math reviews with me. We kind of split up algebra and geometry between us, so you can see there's lots of different kinds of algebra, geometry, combinatorics flying into this, and this is a work in progress. What I'm really hoping to do is just sell you on these objects as cool things to play around with so that I can get more people in the community playing around with things called an ingrids. The motivation is from physics, and we're going to go physics to algebras, to combinatorics, and push all the way down to arithmetic geometry, then ask whether there's anything that we can lift back up the column again in any way. Adinkras were formalized as physics y mathematical objects by Michael Fox and Jim Gates.
00:01:10.784 - 00:01:48.164, Speaker B: And they take their name from an older symbol that are symbols used in artwork from Ghana. These are symbols that can very compactly convey, like, a large amount of information, a big idea. And so Gates and Fox said, this is exactly what we're doing. We're somehow, like, cramming all of this information into a pretty graphical object. So we should call them a dinkros, kind of, in honor of this older art form. So let's do a little bit of physics. In the standard model of particle physics, we got a bunch of bosons, things like photons, which convey light particles, gluons, which convey other kinds of forces.
00:01:48.164 - 00:02:37.734, Speaker B: The Higgs boson. I'm very proud that I have a non binary artist here illustrating my Higgs boson. And then we've also got a bunch of fermions, which might be things like electrons that you remember back in the day in chemistry class actually going into being components of matter, right? Supersymmetry is a symmetry in the sense of physical theories that should exchange bosons and fermions in particular. Every time you have a boson, you should have a fermion partner, and vice versa. This is not something that has been experimentally been observed. There's lots of fermions out there where, if they have a boson partner, it's, like, incredibly hard to find. We've been smashing atoms together in the supercollider.
00:02:37.734 - 00:03:03.254, Speaker B: Just have not located it. But on the other hand, nice symmetries we're mathematicians. We don't have to care if the physicists have found them. We can just enjoy the symmetry for its own sake. So that's what we're going to do, mathematicalize this a little bit. We're going to think of both our bosons and our fermions as depending on some, as being functions that depend on some kind of parameter t. And then we'll have operators.
00:03:03.254 - 00:03:49.180, Speaker B: Each supersymmetry operator can turn bosons into fermions, or fermions into bosons. We're going to use the anticommutator, which is just ab plus ba. This is clearly not a commutative geometry kind of thing, necessarily. And then a one dimensional supersymmetry algebra is going to have an anti commutator that's just two times the square root of negative one Dirac delta times the derivative with respect to t. So we're doing one dimensional supersymmetry here. That means we have one time dimension and nothing else. Usually you would think that if you're stuck in zero dimensions spatially, nothing happens.
00:03:49.180 - 00:04:20.042, Speaker B: But because this is quantum physics, weird stuff can still go on, and we're still going to see that we have all kinds of structure to play with here. So let's try to combinatorialize this. We're going to make a thing called a chromotypology, chromo for color. It's a finite simple graph. We're going to make a bipartite graph. In other words, we'll have half our vertices be bosons and our other half be fermions. We're going to assume that it is n regular.
00:04:20.042 - 00:05:13.874, Speaker B: So every single boson or fermion is going to have n different edges coming out of it, and they're going to be colored one of our n possible colors. We think of those colors as corresponding to the operator. So you think of moving along one of these edges as transforming boson to fermion, or fermion to boson. And then finally, we require that every square, or, you know, quasi square in this diagram, that we can have squares made by just taking a pair of colors. So this is a pretty complicated diagram, but you can see, for instance, if you want green, blue, and then green and blue again, you'd be back where you started. And this graph has that property for any pair of colors starting in any place. So that last property is what is going to correspond to one piece of our anticommutator condition.
00:05:13.874 - 00:06:08.224, Speaker B: To build a full adinkra, I also need to throw in an odd dashing. Essentially, if I do the same operator, you know, if I go green, blue, green, blue again and get back where I started, that picks me up a negative sign somewhere in here. The odd dashings tell me where to put the negative signs. They are not going to matter for the rest of this talk. What is going to matter for the rest of this talk is a height assignment. Now I've drawn this graph here already with a height assignment in the sense that I have some open vertices on one level and then the next level all has closed vertices and then the next level has open vertices again. And we're going to assume that for any Adinkra we can actually do that, that there's some consistent way to define the heights so that at each level we only have Fermont or we only have bosons.
00:06:08.224 - 00:07:08.084, Speaker B: And if you go from one level to another you're following a single edge. There's a classification theorem for chromotopologies, which is that every single one is going to be some kind of appropriate quotient of a hypercube. So what I have drawn here on my slide, this is, um, I think n equals four hypercube, um, in the sense of a chromo topology. And I could get anything else with this number of colors by taking appropriate quotients of it. I want to talk more about height functions. First of all, you can imagine sort of traveling around height functions by just grabbing a vertex and moving it up to the next possible level. So you take your fermion and you move it up to the next fermion level, or maybe you take your boson and you move it down to the next possible boson level, something like that.
00:07:08.084 - 00:07:57.844, Speaker B: There are a ton of these things. So here's a table that was worked out by Y x Zhang. You can see that already in dimension five we have 395 some thousand of these things. On the other hand, this is not a very sophisticated classification of height function. This table here would say, for instance, if I relabel my bosons or if I switch bosons and fermions, it would give me a distinct height function because I technically put a vertex in a different place. We want to geometrize, so we're going to take our chromatopology and we're going to throw in our rainbow. Got to use the rainbows.
00:07:57.844 - 00:08:25.524, Speaker B: A rainbow for us is going to be a cyclic rainbow. You go around the rainbow, you end up back at the beginning of the rainbow. If we've got that information, we're going to be able to build an algebraic curve and it's also going to come with a belly map, which means that we're going to have a map to p one that's ramified at three points. So let me draw a picture for you. Let's take the n equals three cubed. We're going to take our bisexual rainbow. That means we're doing magenta and violet and blue.
00:08:25.524 - 00:08:49.784, Speaker B: And I'm going to start. What I've got so far is just like something that's a graph. I want to imagine gluing in some squares to my graph. So I'm going to glue in the magenta violet squares. I'm going to glue in the violet blue squares. Then I'm going to loop around because we've got circular rainbows and glue in the blue magenta squares. And you can imagine that I'd get a curve here.
00:08:49.784 - 00:09:25.966, Speaker B: You're supposed to be imagining that the curve is a sphere. It's what we've got if we've just sort of spatialized and filled in all of the possible facets here on this sphere like object. Now if I wanted, I could have a sort of quotient map where I take all of my magenta edges and I glue them together. I take all of my blue edges and glue them together. I take all of my violet edges and glue them together. I would then get a new space which has only three colors of edges. It had a special point coming from all the fermions and it had special point coming from all of the bosons.
00:09:25.966 - 00:10:10.396, Speaker B: That is what we creatively call the beach ball. And then you can map your beach ball down to the Riemann sphere by then identifying all of the edges together and sending your two points to say, zero and infinity. So that's sort of, we get a value map. We also get a little extra structure because we always factor through the beach ball. Now there is a well defined map that starts with a height function and it gives you a divisor on this algebraic curve built in the manner I have just illustrated for you. But that algebraic curve, it might be really hygienist. In fact, it probably is really hygienous.
00:10:10.396 - 00:10:42.024, Speaker B: So we want to simplify a little bit so we can push further to the jacobian of this curve. You could try to do examples for the n equals one hypercube. The n equals two hypercube. We saw that the n equals three hypercube just gives us a sphere. So that tells us that, okay, we've got a genus zero curve and there isn't any information in the Jacobian. So although we could define corresponding points from height functions. They wouldn't really tell us a lot.
00:10:42.024 - 00:11:23.902, Speaker B: For n equals four, we get a non trivial jacobian, we get an elliptic curve. But unfortunately, all the height functions still map divisors to the identity of the elliptic curve. So we still don't have any exciting information. Now, this was worked out by Duran Iga Kostiak and Stefan Mendes Diaz that for the n equals five hypercube, if you do this map to divisors, you get one thing that is non trivial, at least. So that's where Amanda and I came in. In this process, we said, okay, there's 395,000 some height functions. We know that there is at least one non trivial thing.
00:11:23.902 - 00:12:18.414, Speaker B: Is there more than one non trivial thing? We didn't know when we started looking at this? Yeah, 395,000. So, first of all, you ask, okay, well, we map height functions to divisors. What kind of image can we have? What kind of points can we get on this jacobian? And then you hope that maybe you can do more. Maybe you can classify height functions in some sense using information that you gather by simplifying down to the divisor map, which we know simplifies a lot, because in the lower dimensions, it just basically throws everything away and identifies all of the height functions. And then you could hope that maybe you could even then start pulling that information back and see what it did on the algebra level instead of the graph theory level. How are we going to do this? We want to get more explicit about what our actual points are on curves and things like that. So we use a specific realization.
00:12:18.414 - 00:12:49.574, Speaker B: We're going to realize our Adinkra curve as a complete intersection in p four depends on a couple of parameters. It's an intersection of quadrics. Um, you can think of the parameters as depending on a fifth root of negative one, but maybe in this case, it's more fun to think of them as being related to the golden ratio. So one of our parameters is exactly the golden ratio, and then we've got one plus the golden ratio, and we're using those in our intersection of quadrics.
00:12:51.374 - 00:13:09.718, Speaker A: Yes, I am. Very well. As to how we're going from a digger curve. So are we literally thinking about it as a graph on the curve? And this is like the intersections of lines on a curve defining a bigger group, or are we defining the curvaceous position and a different way?
00:13:09.886 - 00:13:22.774, Speaker B: Right. So what we have is we have a sort of abstract Riemann surface, and then there is a map which would embed our abstract Riemann surface, which has our graph embedded into it, into this complete intersection.
00:13:23.314 - 00:13:26.818, Speaker A: Okay, so it's a Riemann surface with the adaptor embedded object.
00:13:26.866 - 00:13:27.494, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:46.334 - 00:13:47.074, Speaker A: Yes.
00:13:49.134 - 00:14:21.464, Speaker B: Yes. All right. So things are really special here, right? We built this beautiful intersectional quadrics. We use the golden ratio and the parameters in our quadrics. It turns out that the jacobian that we get is also a really special jacobian. It's a product of five isogenous elliptic curves, and they all have j invariant 2048. So we can get to 2048.
00:14:26.364 - 00:14:26.868, Speaker A: And.
00:14:26.956 - 00:15:12.124, Speaker B: We can talk about where individual pieces of the Adinkra go under this map. So if we want to know what is the subgroup that's generated by important points on the Adinkra, that is, that's generated by the images of fermion points generated by the images of boson points. And it turns out that when defining divisors corresponding to height functions, we also care about the centers of faces. So that's our third kind of point is centers of faces. We get a subgroup on each elliptic curve, and in each case, that subgroup is generated by one thing of infinite order. You can pick your favorite fermion or boson to do it. One face center of order four.
00:15:12.124 - 00:15:54.060, Speaker B: There's always a special face center that has order four. It's a different pair of colors for each of our five curves. And then we can pick another face center that's of order two that doesn't happen to be twice the one of order four we already picked. And that gives us a nice group. Now, if you care about elliptic curves, you probably care where these things are defined. So for three of our elliptic curves, the points are defined over q a, join that fifth root of negative one, and then I. In a couple of cases, things don't work out quite as prettily.
00:15:54.060 - 00:16:45.884, Speaker B: And we also need to throw in a square root of the golden ratio in order to define the centers of to show where our face centers go. Now, in the nice case, the group of rational points is exactly isomorphic on this curve to z plus z mod four plus z mod two. So for three of our curves, we're really sort of getting everything just by mapping in our face centers and picking our favorite fermion or boson point and the other two curves. Well, we threw in an extra square root of five. We get some more points on the elliptic curve, but we can kind of ignore them in what we're doing because we don't see them. Here's an example of what kinds of things could happen. You might start with the extended hypercube.
00:16:45.884 - 00:17:37.584, Speaker B: So all the way pulled out, the way I showed you in the pictures earlier, where you have one vertex at the top, one vertex at the bottom, the other one's in between. And we might take the lowest vertex and we might raise it up to the next place that we can put it and then say, okay, where does that go in each of these groups of this elliptic curve? So here are a couple of examples. There are 32 possible height functions that do this because you could pick anything to be your top vertex and then the opposite is the bottom vertex. And here's the kind of images that you get. So in this particular case you can see that there's some variation. We didn't know at first whether it would even matter, like which elliptic curve you mattered to, right, because they are all isogenous. But we do see variation from curve to curve.
00:17:37.584 - 00:18:36.476, Speaker B: Some things are slightly different, in this case, not very different, where it's essentially a question of, oh, does the generator that I'm mapping to of say, my infinite group match up with the generator that I picked when I coded this stuff? So for this particular type of pipe function, you really do get like a fingerprint you can see. All right, all of these are the same, up to choices of generators and some reordering reshuffling of our groups. But there are slightly weirder things that can happen. Even if you took height functions that you think are morally the same, in other words, that you thought were the same, up to relabeling your vertices in some way. That's partly because there are two possible signs for images of vertices. So depending on exactly which vertex you're working with, you might throw in a plus or a minus sign somewhere. And there's also kind of a fun relation between fermion vertices, vertices and boson vertices.
00:18:36.476 - 00:19:23.524, Speaker B: So even if you pick ones that are consistent in sign, if you add them together, you're going to get something that's two times the generator of order four. So if you're messing around and relabeling vertices, it could be that you get slightly different looking height functions. The ways that we would expect them to differ are by these sign changes and by appearances or disappearances of twice a generator of order four. But I should say that we have not yet explored all 395,000 some height functions. We've only done approximately 1000, I think. So there's still possibly room for weirder stuff to happen as well. Stay tuned, just to show you where things go.
00:19:23.524 - 00:20:30.634, Speaker B: So we've been working. Oh, sorry, let's go back again we've been working through by the number of sinks so fully extended you have a single sink. If you raise one vertex, all of a sudden you have two sinks and you can keep on going like that all the way down to, if you want 16 sinks, that means you made what we call the Valisa Dinkra, where you just squished everything and it's flat. So half your vertices are on the bottom. So lots of stuff to explore, lots of questions about how to organize these more complicated height functions. We're really hoping that algebra will be helpful here because once you get to like multiple kinds of different sinks in different places, it's hard to encapsulate what you're even talking about. And then of course we can hope to start pulling back up the ladder and asking can we maybe see the shadow of some supersymmetry algebra here down at the bottom where we've been mucking around in points on elliptic curves and arithmetic geometry? So let me end there.
