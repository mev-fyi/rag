00:00:00.280 - 00:00:12.542, Speaker A: Program, but I think it's on the homepage. Sorry, all the. There's no. The organizer is not written on any of the handout that you gave us. Oh, I see. The organizers. Yeah.
00:00:12.542 - 00:01:13.246, Speaker A: Oh, well, we're happy to do all this work for free. Okay. But it's written on the homepage. It is written on the home page. Yeah. Let me take a giver statement. All right.
00:01:13.246 - 00:02:07.914, Speaker A: Welcome back, everyone. Our next speaker is Lars Hasselt from Copenhagen and Nagoya, and he's talking about topological cyclic homology and the Fogfontein curve. Take it away. Yeah. So, thank you for the invitation to speak here. It has been a great joy to be at a real conference again with real people. And as Kate Poncer was saying at the beginning of the last talk, I mean, some of the older people among us have been at conferences before, but there's a new generation who has not known anything except for this COVID stuff, so it's very nice to be out of that.
00:02:07.914 - 00:03:15.844, Speaker A: And I'm the last speaker on this side of the ocean, so I think we should also thank the organizers, at least on this side, for so. So, in homosphobic theory, we're used to having a formal neighborhood of a rational point on a curve. And Quillen defined a formal group law on that in certain situations. And this is very useful. But, of course, it's better to have a whole curve instead of just having such a formal neighborhood. And so I will talk about how this appears in this situation of the facfun t curve. So, let me first say something about curves.
00:03:15.844 - 00:04:39.472, Speaker A: So, if we have a curve, and let's say regular and connected over a field, okay? Like this. So then how can we understand this? So we can choose a closed point. And when we remove this point, then the curve becomes affine. It could be affine to begin with, but as soon as we punch a hole in it, it certainly is. And this point here also gives us a line bundle like this. And then we can identify x as price of the graded ring p, where p is the sum of the global sections of all the tensor powers of this line bundle, like this. Okay? So we want to calculate these global sections here.
00:04:39.472 - 00:05:07.142, Speaker A: And so this we will do by Bivocalmont. So. So we have. We have this. This curve x. And now we remove a point. I think I'm going to take the japanese chalk instead.
00:05:07.142 - 00:06:01.674, Speaker A: So. And like Peter was explaining in his talk on Monday, we should really think of this as a closed inclusion. And the open complement is the formal completion of X along this point. Well, Gotendeck has told us that we should think of the formal completion of X at this point as a tubular neighborhood. And this behaves as if it's open. And then this open complement here behaves as if it's closed. So we will look at this cartesian diagram here.
00:06:01.674 - 00:08:06.074, Speaker A: And this, this philosophy is substantiated from looking at the stable infinity categories of quasi coherent sheaves on these pieces. Pieces. So, so this formal completion behaves as if it's open, and the open complement behaves as if it's closed. And Peter constructed this diagram in his talk on Monday. So now, the global sections of this line bundle, and also it's h one. There's only h zero and h one because it's a voice coherent sieve, are given by the limits and the column of the diagram where we take the global sections on x with the point removed. And then the restriction to here, this maps to the global sections of this punctured formal neighborhood, and also the restriction of the line bond group there and finally here.
00:08:06.074 - 00:09:03.423, Speaker A: Okay, so, so now let me take a very simple curve and show, and explain what this looks like. And we're going to see this diagram sometimes. So maybe I will give it such a star so we can refer to it. So what if we just take the predictive line over a field? For example, the complex numbers. Excuse me, Lars, there was a question in the chat, why is y without infinity non empty? Shane Kelly well, he should know. So, yeah, so, I mean, this will look as spurf of a complete discrete valuation ring. And then this will be spurf of its quotient field.
00:09:03.423 - 00:10:09.334, Speaker A: Okay? What? Yeah, maybe I shouldn't call it like that. So. But, yeah, and so then we choose a coordinate at infinity. I'm going to call that coordinate c inverse. And so then if we look at this diagram here, we get, here we get the polynomial algebra. Here we get the la Ronde polynomial algebra on c inverse. And then inside here we get t to the n times this power series ring on t inverse.
00:10:09.334 - 00:11:33.444, Speaker A: So now we can calculate the cohomology for n greater than or equal to zero. H zero is an n plus one dimensional c vector space generated by one t up to t to the n. And h one is zero. And for n less than zero, h zero is zero, and h one is a c vector space generated by, by these elements. In particular, if n is minus one, then minus one plus one is zero. And then this is interpreted as being the empty set. So it's one is zero.
00:11:33.444 - 00:12:08.674, Speaker A: And in your diagram, there is h. The map from, that's the composition. Okay, good. Yeah, yeah. Should I also write down what p is? I should watch this. Maybe I don't write down what p is. So instead let me do the twister projected line.
00:12:08.674 - 00:13:39.704, Speaker A: So the protective line over c has two real forms, the real protective line and the twister projective line which is the Rauis variety of the quaternions. So this has no real points. Every closed point has rest to field the complex numbers. But when we extend scalars up to c we get the predictive line over c. And so we choose again a coordinate at infinity at some closed point. And now this diagram then looks like this. So here we have the same as before and here this map is determined by saying that u plus iv is t and u minus iv is minus t inverse.
00:13:39.704 - 00:14:26.694, Speaker A: Yeah so there's this minus here. So this is defined over r. So, so these algebras here in the bottom are really only real algebras. And the reason that we have a c here is because if we have a complete discrete valuation ring with raised to field of characteristic zero then there exists a coefficient field. So there exists a splitting. But well in this case you can just write it down. But in general this only exists because of the axiom of choice and maybe it's not so useful.
00:14:26.694 - 00:16:03.324, Speaker A: However, what is completely canonical is the tiatic filtration. So the, the adic filtration is completely canonical and it induces a filtration on these cohomology groups. And let me just give the non zero pieces for that filtration. So for n greater than or equal to zero, the m th graded piece of h zero x o x n is, is r times one if m is zero and is c times t to the m if m is between one and m and there's no h one. And let me also say four n less than zero. Oops, one. So we have c times t to the m for n plus one less than or equal to m less than or equal to minus one.
00:16:03.324 - 00:17:34.386, Speaker A: And then finally c mod r times one when m is zero. So here when n is minus one where for the projective line we get zero here instead we get this c mod r which is the difference between the field of definition or the global sections and then the rest of field at close points. And, and so the, I know. And so the falk front ten curve is morally a periodic version of this twist. A predictive line. Yeah, I mean this is a, what can I say what the chiatic filtration is? Yeah, so I mean so if you have a curve and you take the completed local ring at a closed point. Then that is a complete discrete valuation ring when it's a regular point.
00:17:34.386 - 00:19:10.554, Speaker A: And that's so t is the generator of the maximal ideal. That was an answer, right? So, okay, so now the faculty curve. So, so this is a, this is, so this is associated with, let's say in this, an algebraically closed completely valued field of characteristic p. And closed points on this correspond to Frobenius orbits of isomorphism classes of characteristic zero on tilts of. If, if you understand that, that's fine. If you don't, then it doesn't really matter for this talk. So again, we choose a point and a coordinate at this closed point, and the residue field at this point is then such an algebraically closed completely valued field of characteristic zero.
00:19:10.554 - 00:20:17.554, Speaker A: And the perfect hardened nature of the situation also gives you this identification of the tilt of c with f. So in this situation, this diagram here. So instead of the polynomial ring, we get a ring which is called be. It's also a principal ideal domain. And instead of the complete discrete valuation field of Laurent theories, we get this field, which is called be the RoM. It's also a complete discrete evaluation field. And here we get.
00:20:17.554 - 00:21:50.414, Speaker A: Yeah, so it has a filtration where fill zero is the valuation ring, fill minus one is the maximal ideal in the valuation ring, and so on. And so this is what this diagram gives in the case of the facin curve. Let me also write down what, what the cohomology looks like. Oops. So again, we have like this. So for n greater than or equal to zero, the only non zero graded pieces of the cohomology are like this. So we get qp times one if m is zero, and c times t to the mirror if m is between one and n.
00:21:50.414 - 00:23:09.036, Speaker A: So in the same way as here, we had the real numbers and the complex numbers. Here we have qp and then this huge field. But now, of course, this is here c is two dimensional over r, but this is uncountably dimensional over qp. So, yeah, so it's different, but also much the same. And for n negative, again, we have c times t to the m if n plus one is less than or equal to m is less than or equal to minus one. And when m is zero, we get c mod qp. So again, this, this difference between the field of definition or the field of global sections and the rest of field at the closed point points shows up here as h one of.
00:23:09.036 - 00:24:02.462, Speaker A: Okay, so now how can we produce something like this from homotopy theory? Sorry, Lars, maybe you said it. But could you please say again, what is this field c? It's the residue field at the closed point. Is there some other description of that field? No. Okay. But there's a characterization of what fields appear in this way. And the fields that appear are all the characteristic zero. Until if is spherically complete, then they are all isomorphic in the same way.
00:24:02.462 - 00:24:33.374, Speaker A: So here for the twist of projective lines, all the residue fields at the closed points were all isomorphic to c here. This is not necessarily the case. It's the case if f is spherically complete, but otherwise it's not. Yeah. Okay. So how are we going to produce this? So maybe I will. Let me take a new board.
00:24:33.374 - 00:26:35.994, Speaker A: Maybe I can take this one. So let's begin by looking at the, let's begin by looking at the bottom line. So where we have these, these complete, this complete discrete valuation field, because that's the kind of thing that we are, that we are used to in homotopy theory. So how do we get that? Yeah, well, no, so we consider a commutative algebra in spectra with an action by the circle group and which have a bot element beta in PI two of the fixed points. So we'll see what part elementary is when we get there. So. So if we have that, then we obtain the lower line in here by doing the following.
00:26:35.994 - 00:27:44.056, Speaker A: Well, sorry, I should say from, we take the tape spectrum of this spectrum with a circle action, and then we do the following. We invert the bot elements. And so this Tate spectrum is the abutment of the Tate spectral sequence, which you get from the Poshnikov filtration of e. And so that spectral sequence gives a filtration on these homotopic groups, which I will call the nigot filtration. So. So this is, this is Nygaard complete. But now when we invert the bottom and it's no longer niggard complete.
00:27:44.056 - 00:28:30.724, Speaker A: So we niggard completed, and then finally we extract the ring of. So let me say the degree zero part. So after these two steps. So we begin with a graded ring. It's still graded, but now we take out just what we have in degree zero. Okay? And. Oops.
00:28:30.724 - 00:29:33.444, Speaker A: Maybe I can, maybe I can write here what this is going to. So let's see. So we, we have this change spectrum, then we invert the bot element, and then we nigh got completed, and then we take the degree zero apart. Okay. Okay. So now let's look at that in. So the classical situation in homotopy theory is that the circle action on e is trivial.
00:29:33.444 - 00:31:52.414, Speaker A: Or trivializable. And so, so if the u one action on e is, is trivializable, then that's trivialization. It gives a map from, from E, or rather it's, it's base changed to a point, to the fixed points, and then to the tate. So when the action is trivial, then the homotopic groups of the Tate spectrum become algebra over the homotopic groups of E. And so, so this identifies non canonically. This rings here we so take, take a homotopic group of the underlying ring, invert the broad elements, and take the degree zero part of that, and then its Laurant polynomials over this in some local parameter, which is of course non canonical. So let me call this ring here r.
00:31:52.414 - 00:32:56.110, Speaker A: So what this looks like is, it looks like the punctured formal neighborhood. Yeah, let me write that. I will write it. So, so let's see. So we have. So we have p u one, which projects down to a point, and then that has a section. And now on, on spectra, we then have like this.
00:32:56.110 - 00:34:37.664, Speaker A: So it's just the underlying spectrum. Okay, so this corresponds punctured formal neighborhood of an r rational point on, on a curve. So we don't have the curve. But if we had, if we had a curve and if we had an irrational point, then the punctured fallen neighborhood at that point would look like this. So, so, note here that the reason that we get a rational point corresponds to the fact that the u one action was trivial. Now, in the case of the Facfun sync curve and also the twist of predictive line, the points are not rational. So there are no rational points on those curves.
00:34:37.664 - 00:36:25.454, Speaker A: So de that we're looking for should not have a trivial circle axe. And so, so, as Kate Ponceau was also talking about in her lecture, we have a good spectrum with a non trivial circle action, namely voxel homology or topological voxel homology. Yeah, so, so for the foc curve here, we consider e, which is ch of. So we have picked this point, which has residue field c, and that has a valuation ring. Oc the value, this is not a discrete valuation ring. So the value group is dense in the real line. And.
00:36:25.454 - 00:37:28.014, Speaker A: Yeah, so we take this and then we p complete it. Okay, so this is a commutative algebra inspector with circle action. And now the circle action is non trivial. We also have a part element. For example, it comes from the image by the cyclo atomic trace of the broad element in algebraic k theory. And this lives in PI two of the homotopy fixed set of e. And this PI two, here is a rank one module over PI zero, but the bot element is not a generator.
00:37:28.014 - 00:39:50.254, Speaker A: So there's a generator u and then this is a non unit times that generator. And, and now the structure of the Tate spectrum is calculated in batmobile Scholzer's second paper. So by a bms two. So if we take this Tate spectrum, invert the bot elements nigot complete and take the degree zero parts, then we precisely get this complete discrete valuation field be the run which appeared in, so this fontene ring which appeared in the diagram, and the chiatic filtration of this valuation field, discrete valuation field corresponds to the Nigard filtration. So the filtration that comes from the spectral sequence. Okay, so, but this is what we're used to in, in homotopy theory to get this kind of thing. What about this affine piece? So, so this part, which was fun since ring pe.
00:39:50.254 - 00:42:01.274, Speaker A: So this we get from the palings on fiber square by pen antio Achille Matthew, Matthew Morrow and Thomas Nkolu. And let me just say that from what they do in that paper, there's a map from PI of k of Oc mod p completed at p bard element, inverted degree zero pod, and then to this thing here. And again from bms two. This is canonically identified with be. This is be the ROM and this crystalline turn character from the Baylinson fiber square paper gives this map that you need to build the curve. So yeah, it's not nice that we have to divide out by p here. So we would like to find a way where we can construct this homotopy type here from OC or from C.
00:42:01.274 - 00:43:33.544, Speaker A: Yeah, so this indicates that there's a localizing invariant missing that gives this homotopy type and also that map. Let me just, in the last minutes, say something about I have five minutes left. Okay. Then I can go slow. So what about the, yeah, so what about the, what about the twist or predictive line? So we choose some point. The residue field will then be isomorphic to the complex numbers. And so we might consider to take e to be t, h or h of C.
00:43:33.544 - 00:45:09.604, Speaker A: But the problem with this is that this has no body elements. If we take the homotopy fixed, so this is just seen, and if we take the homotopy fixed points, it only has homotopy groups in negative degrees. There's no body element. So. Yeah, but now from Dustin and Peter's development of liquid mathematics, they have, they describe the real numbers as a quotient of a ring of convergent power series. With integer coefficients. And if we use that as our base instead, then we get, then we get a part element what is too high.
00:45:09.604 - 00:46:52.768, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. So instead we take this to be eight, eight or t eight of C. And then relative to this, this ring here where t is mapped to some real number between zero and one. And so if we do that, then we get, then we get a bot element and this here becomes, it gives us this peace in what just commenting that this will be defined over the real numbers already. Yes, but my residue field is c. Well, but now there is the question about the f in piece.
00:46:52.768 - 00:47:53.732, Speaker A: So, and so this is a question of the same kind as the question over here. What is a reasonable dis, how can, what is the localizing invariance that gives us this term here applied to perfect OC modules or maybe nuclear C vector spaces. Nuclear solid C vector spaces. So first you have to find that. And maybe if you have a good idea there, that could give you a hint to how to define this. So there's a missing localizing invariance that we would like to find. So let me stop there.
00:47:53.732 - 00:47:54.124, Speaker A: It.
