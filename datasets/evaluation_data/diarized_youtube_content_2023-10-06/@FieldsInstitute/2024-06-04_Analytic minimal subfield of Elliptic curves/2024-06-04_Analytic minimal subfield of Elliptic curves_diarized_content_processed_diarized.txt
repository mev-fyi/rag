00:00:13.400 - 00:00:25.674, Speaker A: I'm not sure. We'll see. Maybe. I think I'll finish in 1415 minutes. Thank you.
00:01:34.994 - 00:01:40.454, Speaker B: Our next speaker is from pit, and he will be talking about analytic minimal subfields of elliptic.
00:01:41.834 - 00:02:29.643, Speaker A: Thank you, and thanks to the organizers for inviting me to give a talk with such an esteemed audience. I'll be talking about analytic minimal subfields, which is a recent paper that I published under the name of minimal subfields of elliptic curves. So, let k be a number field, and let e be an elliptic curve defined over k. We know that the model well theorem tells us that the k rational points of e is finitely generated. R is the rank of the elliptic curve. Kumar and Amir studied this very interesting object associated with it. So it's called the minimal subfield.
00:02:29.643 - 00:03:27.784, Speaker A: If you have a finite extension f over k, we are concerned about how far down can you push without changing the rank. So rank of e of m is same as the rank of e of f of the top field, and m is minimal. So they introduce this object, and they show that it exists. Such a field exists. It is unique. If you have, if you start with a Galois extension f over k, then the minimal sub field is a Galloway extension, and they give explicit description when the rank is small, one, two, or three. What are the possibilities of the gallo group? Now, in my paper I also study some algebraic questions, but today I'll focus more on the analytic side of things.
00:03:27.784 - 00:04:14.654, Speaker A: So, the famous Birch Swineton Dyer conjecture predicts that the rank is equal to the order of vanishing of the corresponding l function at is equal to one. So just like the minimal subfield, you can define an analytic minimal subfield in the following way. Suppose you take a zero of the l function, so omega is a zero of the l function of the top field. F over k is a finite extension. And then the analytic minimize the field f omega is defined as, in a very similar way, the order of vanishing is same as the top field. And if there is any other intermediate subfield for which the order is the same, then f omega is contained in k prime. In that sense, it's minimal.
00:04:14.654 - 00:05:09.024, Speaker A: So they shows. Let me go to the next slide. So from the work of so they show that the existence of the analytic minimal subtract in fact depend depends on the holomorphy of these twisted l functions, these twisted l functions, where chi is an irreducible character of the Galois group. So it exists only when the extension is Galois and the twisted l functions are holomorphic. At is equal to omega for all irreducible characters. The idea is the following. The idea of the construction is that you look at all those characters chi, for which it vanishes at Omega, and then you look at their kernel.
00:05:09.024 - 00:05:53.704, Speaker A: You take the intersection of all their kernels. Let's call that subgroup h omega. Then f omega is just given by the fixed field of this subgroup. Hmm. It's quite natural, but yet quite interesting. Then they so, as you can see, if we want to work with the analytic minimal subfield, we need to be concerned with when do these twisted l functions are? When are they holomorphic? So in that regard, they prove two results. Number one, suppose e satisfy the general taniyama conjecture over k and f be a solvable Galois extension.
00:05:53.704 - 00:06:39.704, Speaker A: Let chi be an irreducible character of the Galois group. Then these twisted l functions are holomorphic at s equal to omega. If omega is a simple zero of the l function of the top field, right? And then of course if they are holomorphic, then in this, under the same assumptions, the analytic minimalist of field exists. Moreover, they show that such an analytic minimal sub field is cyclic extension of k. If omega is a real number. Of course, for burch b is d, we care about what happens at s equals to one. So if omega is real, this is in fact degree at most a quadratic extension f omega over k is at most quadratic.
00:06:39.704 - 00:07:20.736, Speaker A: So there are some comments that needs to be made. Firstly, recall the general tanyama conjecture just says that for any number field k, the l function is that of a cuspidal automorphic representation of gl two ak. Now, of course, when k equal to q, that conjecture is now known. We know modularity due to amazing works of Conrad Taylor, et cetera. Secondly, if you go back to the first theorem that they show is reminiscent of a interesting theorem of stark. It's a classical theorem about Dedekind zeta function. If you have f over k is a galawa extension.
00:07:20.736 - 00:08:24.994, Speaker A: If zeta f has a simple zero at s equal to s naught, then the Arden l functions are holomorphic. Even the second theorem that they showed is also has a sort of classical counterpart. There's a classical result of Helborne and Stark which says that if beta is a real simple zero of the derigan zeta function of the top field, then it's probably coming from either k or a quadratic extension of k. So this was kind of what motivated me to look at this, and I thought to myself that maybe I would be able to prove some more elliptic analogs of similar theorems. And maybe I'll apply them to the analytic minimal sub field context. And that's what I do in this part of the paper. So here is a result of foot and whales, where they generalize the simple zero to a zero of order up to two.
00:08:24.994 - 00:09:17.134, Speaker A: So the result of woot and well says that if the Dedekind zeta function of the top field has a zero of order less than or equal to two, then the art nail functions are in fact holomorphic. So the elliptic analog of that is true. If e over k is an elliptic curve. Again, we are stating that k it satisfies the generalized tanyama conjecture. So if k is q, if your elliptic curve is over q, it's a unconditional theorem. If f is a Galois extension with solvable Galois group, and chi is an irreducible character. Similarly, if we have the l function of the elliptic curve over the top field, if it has a zero of order less than or equal to two, then all these twisted l functions by irreducible characters are holomonic.
00:09:17.134 - 00:10:07.444, Speaker A: Here is another similar result. There is a result. This is a result of footmurthy Murti is Kumar Murthy, where again it's sort of the same kind of idea. Rather than looking at the order of zero to be one or two, those are the two cases we addressed. This generalizes it a little bit more to where the order of vanishing are is p two minus two, p two being the second smallest prime factor of the order of the Galois group. A similar elliptic analog holds as well. If the l function of the elliptic curve vanishes up to the order p two minus two, then this twisted l functions are in fact holomorphic.
00:10:07.444 - 00:11:12.138, Speaker A: Now a small remark here. If the we are saying the second smallest prime factor, if the gala group has only one prime factor, that means it's a p group. So in fact it is nil potent, and we know that in nil potent cases it's null. And as I started with, if the twisted l functions are holomorphic, then the minimal sub field, the analytic minimal sub field, exists. So under the same assumption of these previous two theorems, the analytic minimal subfield exists. Now, if we focus on the case where the order of vanishing is two, what can we say about the analytic minimalist field? So here is a result we can actually describe the Galois group. So suppose the order of vanishing of this l function of the elliptic curve over the top field has a zero at omega of order two.
00:11:12.138 - 00:11:55.600, Speaker A: Then f omega exists, the analytic minimal sub field, and the Galois group is one of the following two. It is either cyclic or dihedral, or the center of the group is isomar peak two z mod two z and g mod. The center is dihedral, a four or s four. These are the possibilities. Perhaps a more interesting application of this analytic minimal subfield is the next result. So we know that over the rational numbers the BSD conjecture is known when the order of vanishing is up to one. Right.
00:11:55.600 - 00:12:54.384, Speaker A: It's due to amazing work of Zaghi and I was able to perhaps very slightly generalize polyvagging's result. So if e over q is an elliptic curve and k is a solvable extension, Galois extension if the rank increases by one. If rank of e of k is rank of e q plus one, then the order of vanishing increases by at least one bigger than or equal to that plus one. And for the other way for the converse, you will need the assumption of this holomorphy of the twisted L functions. If l u were q tensor chi comma s is holomorphic at s equal to one. For every reducible character chi, then if the order of vanishing at one increases by one, then the rank increases by at least. Now equality holds.
00:12:54.384 - 00:13:39.094, Speaker A: If the algebraic and the analytic minimal substitutes are equal, we define the analytic and the very first slide head. That's what we are referring to as the algebraic minimum. A corollary of this theorem is if in fact you, rather than taking k over k as a solvable Galois extension, if you restrict to a quadratic extension, then it's an if and only if. If k over q is a quadratic extension, then the rank increases by one. If and only if the order of vanishing increases by one. And just another small remark. If we assume e has cm, then this condition of holomorphy in part two, we can circumvent it.
00:13:39.094 - 00:14:31.014, Speaker A: By the way, for these solvable extensions and the second part, I heavily use results of professor amurthy from the base change and BSD paper and on rt nel functions paper. That's it. Thank you and happy birthday. I'm sorry, no, because. So that's the approach when we for solvable extension, we know the automorphy of the L function of the top field. So nothing beyond solvable so far.
00:14:36.274 - 00:14:37.418, Speaker B: Any more questions?
00:14:37.506 - 00:14:38.134, Speaker A: Comments?
00:14:41.514 - 00:14:53.154, Speaker B: Thank the speaker. Our next speaker is Walshmit, and we have few minutes, I think two minutes.
