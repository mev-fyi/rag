00:00:00.200 - 00:00:58.684, Speaker A: So today my plan is to talk about that is dimensional rigidity and the universal rigidity. So I talk about some stuff that read that, about the characterization of the universal virginity with connection to the stress matrix. And there's a theorem from Kanali, uh, which I will prove. So this is theorem I will, I want to prove in the end. So this is, this is the main theorem I want to prove. Okay. And uh, so, so we said the, we have a characterization of the university universal rigidity in terms of the PSD matrix.
00:00:58.684 - 00:01:56.862, Speaker A: PSD stress matrix. Okay, so this is basically from the Abdul's book, chapter ten. Yeah, chapter. Chapter ten of the Abdul's book. So let us first look at the definition. So what is universally rigid framework? So given that GP be an r dimensional bar framework with end nodes, then GP is said to be universally rigid. If for any integer s, as in any s between one and n minus one, there does not exist an estimation, no bar framework, such that each Hadama product DP and DP is not equal DP prime.
00:01:56.862 - 00:02:58.364, Speaker A: So this h is just the matrix adjacency matrix of the graph D. So it's the adjacency matrix of the graph G, and this one is the hardware product. So yeah, in other words, GP is a universal digit. If every bar framework GP prime that's equivalent to GP is actually congruent to it. So there's no dimensional requirement. So it means that in any dimension. So for any framework, in any dimension, if the framework, if another batch framework is equivalent to GP, then it must be congruent to it.
00:02:58.364 - 00:04:05.350, Speaker A: So university rigid means it's a global rigid in any dimension, right? So think about the global dimension. So, so if framework is a global rigid in dimension r, but it can be non rigid if you go, go higher dimension. So university said that this, this is impossible. So you cannot live it to any higher, any higher dimension, and you cannot live, actually find a lower, you cannot go to higher dimension and you cannot go to a lower dimension. So this is the definition of the universal universal rigid. Now here's a definition of the dimensional rigid. So the definition is that, again, given an r dimensional bar framework with end nodes, then this framework is said to be dimensional rigid.
00:04:05.350 - 00:05:41.174, Speaker A: If for any integer s, s is between s plus one and n minus one, and that does not exist, an x dimensional bar framework GP prime subset of each Hanami product DP prime is equal to h term each time dp and also, and also Dp is equal to dp prime. I've got this. So in other words, if an r dimensional framework, bar framework is dimensional rigid. And if GP prime is equivalent to Gp, then Gp is of dimensional r or less. Okay, that means that if the framework is, if r dimensional bar framework is dimensional rigid, then you cannot go up, you can only go, go to the lower dimension, but you cannot go to a lifted to higher dimension. So, so it's obvious that a universally rigid implies dimensional rigidity, but not the other way. The other way is not correct.
00:05:41.174 - 00:05:52.946, Speaker A: So, so to characterize this university rigidity, yes.
00:05:53.090 - 00:06:02.810, Speaker B: Can you give an example of the con that dimensional rigidity does not imply university rigidity? You have an example?
00:06:02.882 - 00:07:58.314, Speaker A: Yeah, let's see an example. So I have 1 second. So, yeah, so I have this, this framework, one, two, three. So there's, there's four, four nodes and have these vertices. So, so this, you see edge one, one, two is plus azure 23 is equal to azure 13. So, so this framework is not, it's not a universal rigid because you can rotate this to, to form, right? You can rotate it, but this dimensional widget in r two, no, it's accurate. Dimensional.
00:07:58.314 - 00:08:02.074, Speaker A: Yeah, it's dimensional in r two.
00:08:13.774 - 00:08:57.164, Speaker B: Okay, so dimensional rigidity doesn't imply rigidity at all, even. Right, okay, so, but universal rigidity does, of course, yeah. So dimensional rigidity is simply saying that all frameworks, so neither one is a generic property. But I guess there are, you can talk about graphs that are all generic realizations, are universally rigid and can probably also talk about. Can you do the same for dimensional rigidity? So what I'm trying to get at is this is a very highly non generic example, right?
00:08:57.704 - 00:09:07.344, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. For generic example. So you want a generic example?
00:09:07.504 - 00:09:20.018, Speaker B: Yeah, generic or at least general position. General position, that's okay, we can think about that. You don't, you can continue and then we can maybe talk about it later.
00:09:20.106 - 00:10:09.874, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, okay, so we continue. So here's the theorem about characterize this universal rigidity, which says if framework GP is universally rigid, if and only if the two following condition holds. The first one is that GP is a dimensional rigid, and the second one says that GP does not trivial affine flex. So I will explain this and then I'll show you flex later.
00:10:09.874 - 00:10:56.314, Speaker A: But this theorem basically says, you know, the first part says GP is not a dimensional rigid. That means that you cannot go higher, you cannot go higher. Second power B says you cannot go lower either. So you cannot go higher and you cannot go lower. Then this is the university region. Okay, so now I want to define what is the entry of n flex. So let's GP be an r dimensional bar framework.
00:10:56.314 - 00:12:19.960, Speaker A: So this framework is set to automate an untried affine flex if there exists an r dimensional bio framework GP prime, a different one GP prime, such that this GP prime is equivalent but not congruent to GP. And there is an effect transformation that transfers a PI to PI prime. So PI is equal to a times PI plus b, where a is r by r non singular matrix and b is a vector rr. So this r, of course r is for all the vertices, it's from one to n. So the only a part is obviously, you know, if, if GP is universally rigid. So this theorem, this I want to prove this theorem, this theorem, this only, only part is very obvious. So if GP is universally rigid, then of course then it is a nand, it's a dimensional rigid, and also it does not emit an n trivial affine flexibility.
00:12:19.960 - 00:14:19.074, Speaker A: So, so you cannot go like, you cannot move inside this, along this affine plane. So yeah, so the national widget says there's no, there's no equivalent framework, but not a concurrent framework of a dimensional greater or equal to r plus one. Gp does not admit an entry or fn flux, since there's no equivalent framework, but not a concurrent framework of dimension less than equal to rich. So, so the h part, h part, I want to say the proof is the following. I want to sketch the proof. So, so the condition I, so I want, condition I implies the zero is in the relative interior of the kda configuration spec had spectrohedron of this framework, because this is the condition, right? If Gp is dimensional rigid, then, then this implies zero is in the relative interior of the Klee configuration spectrum, whereas the Klee configuration spectrum is different as following basically this is, so you can think about this as y such and this y corresponding to the nar edges. So you can actually change the modified null edges, right? And still, you still get a PSD matrix.
00:14:19.074 - 00:15:40.264, Speaker A: So this, there are the kilometers back to hydrates, all these y such that x plus yid migration. The ij correspond to the nar edges. So you perturb the null edges of ni edges, you still get a PSD matrix and therefore EDM matrix. So, so this condition, so this framework is dimensional rigid, implies this is the right material of the helicopter spectrum. And, and hence the face of the KD configuration spectrum, which contains zero, must be equal to the spectrohedron itself. Why? Because zero is in the relative interior, right? So if a face consists something, the something, the relative material of the sphaghedral, then the face must be the spiritual itself. So, so you can see this is true for any convex set.
00:15:40.264 - 00:16:54.214, Speaker A: So by example, right? So here is a conveyor set. And so I have a, like this, this will be a face, this, this, this face, but this face, uh, because here all this point here, right at this point here, at this point, at this point, all this point in the face are not in the red interior. But if I have a point here in the red interior, like this point, the face of this convex set must, must be the, it must be the whole, the whole convex set. So that's ideal proof idea. And then the connection tool implies that the condition two says that GP does not admit an interior flex. So this says, this implies the alpha hall of the face of zero f. It's just zero.
00:16:54.214 - 00:17:52.524, Speaker A: Hence by combining these two things, by combining this two conditions that we obtain that f is just zero. So the, so the Klee configuration spectation of GP is zero. That means you cannot actually move, you cannot change the length of the nine edges. The only thing is zero. So therefore GP is a universal universally rigid. Okay, so this is the equivalent condition for universal Ugt. So I have now have a lemma which connects the, which uses the connection of the general partition.
00:17:52.524 - 00:18:39.334, Speaker A: This lemma is used for proving another theorem. But I just, let's see, let's talk about this lemma. This lemma says that let's GP be an r dimensional framework with end nodes and assume Gp is in general position. And that only got your stress matrix. So just stress, not PsD, around n minus r minus one. Then the degree I must be greater or equal to r plus one for every node in G. So this says, yeah, there's a connection between the stress matrix and the degree of the nodes.
00:18:39.334 - 00:19:25.434, Speaker A: And the assumption is that this Gp is the internal position. So the proof is by using the, the gale matrix. So by using this. So let omega be z times phi times z transpose. So omega is a stress matrix. And we know this stress matrix has had such a factorization. So if we assume on the contrary, that a degree I is less or equal to r, then without loss of genericity, we can assume this vertices is the end point ends point ends vertices.
00:19:25.434 - 00:20:21.654, Speaker A: And then we can conclude that the first n minus r minus y interest of this, of this matrix. So this is basically zn, z little n is the, the nth column of the nth row of z or the nth column of z transpose. So the first r minus one interest of this matrix are zero. And because vp is in general position, then the square sub matrix of z index by the first n minus r minus one rows and columns is non singular. And there, and by. And therefore you can draw a contradiction. And then here, and then you prove this lemma.
00:20:21.654 - 00:21:27.224, Speaker A: So with this lemma, yeah, there's a theorem by I park and yeah, like GpB and r dimensional bar framework with anodes and R is less or equal to n minus two. If Gp is in general position and Gp admits a stretch stress matrix of rank n minus one minus r, then Gp does not admit a non trivial affine flex. Okay, so, so there's a. So I know I can. So I have two, I have to connect two conditions for the universal rigidity, right? One is a dimensional rigid. The other one is it does not limit an untried flex. And now I have, there's a sufficient condition to make sure that there does not, the framework does not admit affine flex, which is very simple.
00:21:27.224 - 00:23:09.234, Speaker A: First is you assume this framework is in general position. And secondly, it has a, it means a stress matrix around minus one, minus r. So there's one sufficient condition. And there's also another characterization of this ntriv flex condition by Corneli, which says, if Gp is r dimensional bar framework, if GP is generic, and if the degree, the degree of the vertices is greater or equal to r for each node of the graph, then GP does not an entry or fan flags. So there's another, this is another sufficient condition. Of course, there are many, there are other conditions which you can see, you can find it on the book about this, about the condition that certificate that there does not admit an anterior flags. So, so I have a, now the second part I want to, so I have just talked, I just talked about the natural effect flex part, and now I want to talk about this dimensional rigidity.
00:23:09.234 - 00:24:59.314, Speaker A: So, first of all, we have this there using the PSD strikes. So we said if left Gp, left GP be an r dimensional bar framework with nodes, and r is less or equal to n minus two. If GP stress matrix omega n minus one minus r I, then Gp is the missile rigid. So this theorem, so it's actually, remember we put this, we talked about this theorem alternative in the previous lecture. So basically, the dimension of the stress matrix, the PSMA is from the dual problem, right? And this, the lifting of this, of this bar framework is primal. And if this Gp can be lifted to four dimensional, then there does not exist nonzero GSD. So in general, we have this dimension of the omega if plus the dimension of the plus r, sorry, plus r, which the embedded dimension of this framework, this is less or equal to n minus one.
00:24:59.314 - 00:25:26.564, Speaker A: Okay. So therefore, if. Yeah, excuse me, it's. Well, what do you mean by dimension of omega? Do you mean the rank? Oh, yeah, the rank, sorry, the rank. Okay, rank. Rank of the pst matrix. Yeah, thank you for correcting me.
00:25:26.564 - 00:26:43.028, Speaker A: So the rank of the omega plus the dimension r is less or equal to n minus one. So, so therefore, if my stress matrix, the rank is exactly r is less than n minus one minus rank of omega. So this is equal to n minus one minus n minus one minus r, which is r, that means that you cannot go any higher, right. The maximum upper bound is r, so your framework cannot go any higher. Therefore, this framework is dimensional region. Now, with this, with digital theorem, we can prove the following theorem which says, let gp be an r dimensional bio framework with n nodes and r less or equal to n minus two. Then if the, follow your two condition.
00:26:43.028 - 00:26:53.684, Speaker A: Host first, if GPU missed PSD, stress matrix or rank n minus one minus r, which implies that.
00:26:56.064 - 00:27:06.644, Speaker B: So I'm a little confused by all this. So don't we already know that one of these two conditions implies the other one? In the case of general position.
00:27:10.744 - 00:27:13.244, Speaker A: One of the, in the case which way?
00:27:14.384 - 00:27:34.644, Speaker B: I think two implies one, maybe. Or one implies two. Sorry, you had previously, if you scroll up, you had previously a theorem under some other condition. Maybe further up here, maybe. Yeah, yeah. This one.
00:27:37.344 - 00:27:38.016, Speaker A: Yeah, this one.
00:27:38.040 - 00:27:41.100, Speaker B: I have a general position condition.
00:27:41.272 - 00:27:44.132, Speaker A: Yeah, but then here I don't have the general position.
00:27:44.308 - 00:28:13.964, Speaker B: Ah, so in other words, I mean, this does seem to answer the question I asked before, which would be, that is, it does all the kind, the combination of results you put here doesn't imply the question I asked before, which is that if it is in general position, if a framework is in general position, then dimensional rigidity and universal rigidity are basically identical.
00:28:16.904 - 00:28:23.448, Speaker A: Yeah. Yes, yes. Okay, so, yeah, so if from this theorem, right?
00:28:23.576 - 00:28:24.284, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:26.224 - 00:28:32.484, Speaker A: If you do some prediction, then you have a stress matrix, then.
00:28:35.404 - 00:28:44.944, Speaker B: Yeah. But you had another theorem in between about dimensional rigidity and this condition. Maybe further down, this.
00:28:46.164 - 00:28:58.772, Speaker A: No, no, I think this is the only theorem. I think it's important. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so general position plus the stress stress matrix.
00:28:58.908 - 00:28:59.620, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:59.772 - 00:29:04.060, Speaker A: Implies the trivial app find flex, and.
00:29:04.092 - 00:29:07.224, Speaker B: That then gives you your.
00:29:07.924 - 00:29:31.704, Speaker A: Yeah, and dimensional rigid implies there is a dimensional implies. No, no, actually, dimensional rigid implies, well, if there is a PST mission of rank m minus y minus r implies dimensional rigid, but not the other way.
00:29:33.404 - 00:29:41.252, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you had. What? Yeah, what did you have just before this? Yeah, here.
00:29:41.428 - 00:30:05.764, Speaker A: Yeah, I said. So the PST matrix, rank and minus one mass r implies the measure rigid, but not the other way. If GP is dimensional rigid, you may have a matrix or rank minus one, minus r, but maybe lower. So it's not a, this, this is, this can be strictly less. Right.
00:30:08.064 - 00:30:08.568, Speaker B: Okay.
00:30:08.616 - 00:30:23.744, Speaker A: Yeah, I forgot this would be r bar. Yeah. So R Barbia and r bar. GP prime GP dimensional framework.
00:30:28.604 - 00:30:37.744, Speaker B: But I mean, I can't think of an example that's general position dimensionally rigid, but not universally rigid.
00:30:38.244 - 00:31:23.484, Speaker A: Yeah, you need for an example that there's a dimensional rigid framework. Yeah, but does not exist. Matrix of maximum rank. So this is accurate to a single angular degree of the PST program, which is quite hard to imagine. Yeah, yeah, this is, I know this is hard. It's hard to imagine if such an example, it depends on the structure of the PST and something like that. So, okay.
00:31:23.484 - 00:31:27.884, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe I should continue.
00:31:28.584 - 00:31:29.364, Speaker B: Yes.
00:31:30.544 - 00:33:13.974, Speaker A: So, yeah, so this theorem says if GP admits the stress matrix around m one r, then it means that implies r dimensional rigid, and then plus there's the non existence of natural affine flux. Then together they implies the universal region. And also this I have from using the previous theorem, you can have theorem which use the condition of the general position. So we said if gpb and r dimensional power framework with end nodes and r is less or equal to n minus two, if Gp is in general position in Rr, and the Gp means the p matrix of rank n minus one minus r, and then Gp is a universal rigid, which is, which is, again, the general position implies, implies the plus plus this Psd matrix of rank n minus n minus one implies that the non existence of the non trivial, of a non trivial flex. So you prove this theorem. Now I want to prove this, this term. So far, all these conditions are just sufficient condition, right? So sufficient condition for the universal rigidity.
00:33:13.974 - 00:34:23.526, Speaker A: So it turns out that if this framework is generic and then they are actually equivalent. So, so assume the framework GPA is generic. And then the following two statements, the following two statements are equivalent. So GPA is a universally rigid if and only if GP admits a PSD stress matrix, omega rank n minus one, minus r. So first, we already seen that implied two implies one. This is not hard, because if DP is a PST stress matrix, rank n minus r, and plus DP is generic. So generic is stronger than the general position, right? So, so therefore it's a gps.
00:34:23.526 - 00:35:41.374, Speaker A: In generic means Gp is in general position, plus it's PST stress matrix. And then implant, there is no affine, no non trivial affine flux. And also it says dimensional rigid from the, because of the lack of the PST, stress matrix. So it implies the universal rigid. So now the second, the second part that the one implies two. This is an interesting part. So to prove this, we need actually a theorem which color, what was the name of the theorem is called this stress circuit weight stressed with theorem.
00:35:41.374 - 00:36:23.786, Speaker A: I. I don't know. So this. So this theorem says what it says, it says that every. So the exposed point are dense in, in extreme point. So what does this mean? So what is the exposed point? So, exponent point. So let's draw a comma, except this is not a good example.
00:36:23.786 - 00:37:16.280, Speaker A: So let's draw two parallel line and, and then have a two half circle. So this circle here is tangent. This is a two half circle. So I have a. So here, these four points. So these four points, they are actually extreme point but not exposed point. So exposed point means there is a hyperplane such that if y is a exposed point on the convex at c, then c intersecting a hyperplane h is exactly.
00:37:16.280 - 00:37:51.240, Speaker A: This. Yeah. In my example is here, right? So at this point, then I have a hyperplane, you know, like this. So, and this is my. So the intersection is this exactly this point. So what is the extreme point? Y bar is a extreme point. Uh, if, uh.
00:37:51.240 - 00:38:09.204, Speaker A: Any, any land, any land segments. Uh, let's see. Uh. I'll continue. If there's no, there's no. If there's no line segment. There's no.
00:38:09.204 - 00:38:44.192, Speaker A: If there does not exist a line segment l of this conversant c that contains a y bar. Uh, okay, so for example, if I have at this point in the interior.
00:38:44.288 - 00:38:47.176, Speaker B: Yeah, well, yeah, you mean interior.
00:38:47.240 - 00:39:18.408, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Consider y as the interior. Yeah, as the interior. For example, this point, right? See if I have a nice segment that contains, uh, this point. That's also income asset. But here, this part, I don't have any. You know, if I have a last segment, then either it's like this or it's like this or it's like that.
00:39:18.408 - 00:39:56.410, Speaker A: But no matter what you do, you cannot. This last segment is nothing. Nothing. They come exceed. So, so basically it means the exposed point, exposed point. R extreme point, extreme point. But the extreme point may not be exposed point.
00:39:56.410 - 00:40:31.718, Speaker A: Okay, so exposed point implies a extreme point. But the extreme point may not be an exposed point. So this is not true. But this theorem says, uh, this, this theorem says, uh, although they may not be equal, but exposed point are dense in extreme point. Uh, so, so then this is a proof so how do you prove this? Uh, this, uh, this theorem is. So the proof sketch is the data. So you.
00:40:31.718 - 00:41:08.254, Speaker A: So first you have a, supposedly assume GP is universal, rigid, and then this GP, this, I prove that. I prove that it's a, it's an extreme point of the. In the projection of the, of the EDM cone. Of the EDM cone project to the graph.
00:41:12.314 - 00:41:33.554, Speaker B: Maybe you have the theorem written the opposite way. Maybe every, every exposed point is extreme. But every extreme point is not exposed. Right? Yeah, but so the other, that should be written the other way, that every extreme point. Extreme points are dense in the exposed points.
00:41:40.334 - 00:41:52.800, Speaker A: So I have this point. This, this point. It's this point. So this one picked up one of the four red points. Yeah. They are actually extreme point but not exposed point.
00:41:52.952 - 00:41:59.884, Speaker B: That's correct. Yeah. But the way you've written the theorem looks maybe should be switched.
00:42:00.704 - 00:42:20.294, Speaker A: That means extreme points are bigger. It's probably not smaller. Right. Because you can see that there's an example that these four points, red points are extreme point but not exposed point. So exposed pointer. It's smaller set.
00:42:20.634 - 00:42:21.534, Speaker B: I see.
00:42:23.434 - 00:42:39.078, Speaker A: So exposedness. Extremeness because expose. But it's like this definition of the exposedness. So from here is pointing to section of this kind. I said of the higher plane.
00:42:39.166 - 00:42:42.634, Speaker B: But the point in there is not exposed, right?
00:42:43.734 - 00:42:44.374, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:44.494 - 00:42:47.510, Speaker B: The point in here is not exposed. Okay.
00:42:47.622 - 00:42:57.634, Speaker A: Yeah, but actually it's extreme point. But the extreme. Because the definition is positive point.
00:42:59.214 - 00:43:06.114, Speaker B: All the points, all the points on interior points of the two circles are exposed. Right.
00:43:06.154 - 00:43:07.354, Speaker A: And also, and also extreme.
00:43:07.394 - 00:43:09.254, Speaker B: They're also extreme. Of course. Yeah.
00:43:10.154 - 00:43:16.014, Speaker A: Okay. These four points are not, they're not exposed.
00:43:17.034 - 00:43:19.734, Speaker B: In fact, all the points on the two line segments.
00:43:21.354 - 00:43:39.444, Speaker A: Yeah, well, this point I was point on are not exposed point. Because if I have a. If I have a plan, then, then it's gonna, you know, it's gonna. Intersecting this whole, this whole whole plan, this whole set.
00:43:40.064 - 00:43:48.632, Speaker B: That's correct. But that includes. So the non exposed points include all the points on the two line segments, right? Right, yeah.
00:43:48.768 - 00:44:14.744, Speaker A: Right, yeah. Uh, okay, so, so this, uh. And now, uh. Uh, I I want to prove this. Uh. What? Yeah.
00:44:16.884 - 00:44:22.224, Speaker B: So is it also the case that non exposed points are dense and the extreme points.
00:44:25.754 - 00:44:37.494, Speaker A: No, no. Like this four points. Right. These four points are not, not, they are not. You have a bunch of, like, extreme point. Many, but only four non exposed point. So they are certainly not this.
00:44:38.874 - 00:44:46.370, Speaker B: Why are there only four? That's what I can't figure out. It seems that every point on those lines, the two parallel lines.
00:44:46.562 - 00:44:55.148, Speaker A: Yeah. But, but they are not extreme point. I mean, I mean, the same size exposed one against, in extreme point. So they had this, they have to be.
00:44:55.196 - 00:45:07.224, Speaker B: Oh, they're not extreme. Why? Because uh, you can draw a line segment directly on, on there, on the boundary there you're talking about. Yeah, okay. Yeah.
00:45:07.564 - 00:46:40.644, Speaker A: They're not an extreme point. Okay. Yeah. So, so the sketch of the proof of this university rigidity theorem, you use this stress, stress theorem. So the idea is that you have a universally rigid framework and then uh, you, uh, this, this framework, uh, uh, uh, well let's say the, the corresponding, uh, I have the corresponding gram matrix. I said is the r r d, p is the gram matrix or the edi matrix of this, of jp. Then x is a drain point of the, of this, of this.
00:46:40.644 - 00:48:18.952, Speaker A: So you want to prove that this projection, d, which is the. So let's say d is the, is the projection of the, of the gram matrix and the EDM project to the corresponding uh, graph. And, uh, so, uh, so, uh, so then you want to show that uh, this face of d PI. Uh, so PI over kv s and sn minus one plus is actually exposed. Why this is exposed because Gp is generic and therefore the projection, the potential of GPu, this is equal to dp. So dp is kvx. Dp.
00:48:18.952 - 00:49:04.414, Speaker A: DP is the EDM of GP. So dp is certainly. So Dp is certainly a dream point. Now, they are actually generic. They are generic, which means d is also generic and d is also, this d is a, is also a string point. This is from the university region. So d is the d is a generic.
00:49:04.414 - 00:50:08.714, Speaker A: D is a extreme point of the, of this PI. The projection of all the projection of, projection of Dp project to the project to the graph g. So d. So the projection is because the universal widget, the projection this, of this, this framework, the EDMDP is a dream point, is actually a dream point of the projection of the whole EDM cone. Sorry. Yeah, this is, this would be the production of the EDM cone. So this means, yeah, this means that this is the projection of the projection of the ED and the cone on G.
00:50:08.714 - 00:51:34.734, Speaker A: So d is a dream point on this projection. And because they are generic and exposed point is generic and exposed point are dense in green point, that means d is also exposed point. And from exposed point you can put, and in fact, using the theorem from the, by the paper that's hungry this coral and shadows of the uh, cornicados of the. I wish the name paper by something I forgot by, by Dimitri and Henry so this is the messiah of this particular paper by Henry Walkowicz. We said if, if d is the exposed point of the production of the EDM cone. So I have this s plus n minus one. This is the PSD cone, and this is the EDM cone.
00:51:34.734 - 00:52:33.468, Speaker A: And here this is the projection of the EDM cone. So, production of the EDM cone. So, so if d is a exposedness of the projection of the m cone, then if you lift it up, then the corresponding gram matrix is also an extreme point of the PST cone. And then from there you can use the theorem of alternative to argue that there exists the PST search matrix of the omega of the rank. So that's the idea. Yeah. So, yeah, I think that's the talk.
00:52:33.468 - 00:52:34.204, Speaker A: That's the end of the talk.
