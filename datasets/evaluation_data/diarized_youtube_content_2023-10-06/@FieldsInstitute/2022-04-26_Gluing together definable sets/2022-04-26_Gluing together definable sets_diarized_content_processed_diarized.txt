00:00:02.120 - 00:00:18.354, Speaker A: Okay, so, good morning or good afternoon to everyone. Today's speaker for the seminar is Arthur Piekos from Krakow, and he will talk to us about gluing together definable sets.
00:00:19.294 - 00:00:32.304, Speaker B: Okay, thank you. So I want to thank the organizers for allowing me to present this talk and which.
00:00:39.644 - 00:00:40.384, Speaker C: No.
00:00:45.444 - 00:00:46.988, Speaker B: Can you see the second slide?
00:00:47.076 - 00:00:49.584, Speaker D: Yes, I think yes.
00:00:51.124 - 00:01:48.194, Speaker B: So. So, in the eighties, two german mathematicians, Dulce and Knebusch, showed how to glue together semi algebraic sets. So I want to extend this theory to a general setting. And for the beginning, just look at that. Definable and relatively open subsets are very important in other, also other contexts. So my first structure, which I want to define to somehow develop needed topology for gluing together definable sets, because usual topology is not enough.
00:01:48.534 - 00:01:52.394, Speaker D: So some kind of generalized topology will.
00:01:53.414 - 00:01:55.874, Speaker B: Okay, so a localismal space.
00:01:58.094 - 00:01:58.878, Speaker C: With some.
00:01:58.926 - 00:03:22.288, Speaker B: Family of subsets, such that the empty set is in this family, it is closed under finite units and intersections and is covering the set. So, members of this family Lx will be called smokes, because they are intended to be small open subsets. And Lx, if needed, will be denoted LSO small opens on x. So, for example, if we have a real line, we can consider several possibilities of defining a smoothology, right? For example, if we take the family of finite units of open intervals, it will give us the omnimal real line. But we can choose the family of finite unions of bounded open intervals. So those will be smokes. And so we get the localized or minimal real line, right? We can choose L slom, so the family of all locally finite unions of bounded open intervals.
00:03:22.288 - 00:04:34.934, Speaker B: Or we can restrict not only intervals, but with real endpoint, with rational outputs, for example. So there are several, many, many possibilities of defining smoothology, giving the same topology. It already was used, this symbol o. It's important because if I have asmopology, then I can produce the family of all open sets. Lxo are the sets which are compatible with smokes. A set B is open if its intersection with a smoke is a smop. Okay, so I have two families of subsets, and of course I can generate a usual topology, but those sets will be not important for me.
00:04:34.934 - 00:06:13.864, Speaker B: I call it weekly open and functions that are continuous in the traditional sense, I call only weekly continuous. But the idea is that they are not important as space is small if the whole x is a small. Okay, so for each topological space, for example, for a real line with natural topology on the all or real line with this silicon wave topology, I can produce many, giving the same topology. So as we see, the axioms are that we assume not all, but only some conditions needed for a topology. So it's a kind of generalized topology. But in fact, it's better to treat smootologies as topologies with additional structure. So, smoothologies not only give topology, but also give these open sets, in the strong sense, some basis of the topology distinguished basis, and also give pornology.
00:06:13.864 - 00:06:32.172, Speaker B: Okay, so I want to get a category. So what are morphisms? Morphisms are maps that are bounded. So, smoothology in the domain refines the pre image of the smokology in the.
00:06:32.188 - 00:06:36.064, Speaker D: Co domain and continues.
00:06:37.384 - 00:07:24.514, Speaker B: Which means that primitive of the smokology in the co domain is compatible with the smoothology in the domain. And I get the category lss earlier named sublat locally small spaces and bounded continuous maps. And it's a full subcategory of small spaces. Okay, I will need sometimes to restrict to t zero spaces. Somopology separates points as usual. If two points belong to the same elements of the smopology, they are equal, right? So this is t zero locally small spaces and t zero small spaces.
00:07:25.454 - 00:07:29.850, Speaker D: Give me such categories and I can.
00:07:29.922 - 00:07:41.994, Speaker B: Describe what it means to be admissible. An open family is admissible if it's locally essentially finite, right? So what this means, it means that.
00:07:42.034 - 00:07:44.890, Speaker D: For each member of the slopology, the.
00:07:44.922 - 00:08:47.294, Speaker B: Restriction admits a finite covering of its union. So I will say the restriction is essentially finite. Okay, one needs to be careful about admissibility. For example, if we have two families with the same union, and if we know that the larger is admissible, then the smaller may not be admissible. Also, if we take intersection of two admissible, the intersection may not be admissible. On the other hand, this larger family with the same union is always admissible. So they are cost under coarsening is not under refinements.
00:08:47.294 - 00:09:19.230, Speaker B: Okay, the example is the following. We have an increasing sequence of open intervals, the union of this family and an even larger set. So this families, union v and union w, are admissible because there is the largest set in each of the family. But if we take the intersection, it's.
00:09:19.262 - 00:09:26.674, Speaker D: Not admissible, it's not essentially finite. Okay?
00:09:29.894 - 00:10:09.824, Speaker B: So we can distinguish an important factor from local small spaces to, to small spaces. Take this LXO as a new and it appears that it is a reflector, right? So it's an important factor. It's wrong just to add x as a member of the smokology. This has wrong, this is bad categorical.
00:10:10.564 - 00:10:14.744, Speaker D: Properties, but this is the right way.
00:10:15.124 - 00:10:15.716, Speaker C: Okay?
00:10:15.780 - 00:11:57.488, Speaker B: And we have a theorem on concrete isomorphisms, because concrete isomorphism between local small spaces and the earlier category which was used by Nelson Knebusch, this category of generalist political spaces had eight axioms and also used indexed families of subsets. And so it was first simplified to five axioms. But now if we restrict our local small spaces, it's just the definitions which we have above that are enough. So maybe I will not describe this GT's, because it's a kind of monster. If time allows, I will do this. But okay, so if we have set with a smokology, we can produce a generalized topological space taking Alex O and this family subfamilies of Alex O. So open sets which are essentially finite.
00:11:57.576 - 00:12:02.232, Speaker D: On members of Alex, and vice versa.
00:12:02.368 - 00:12:17.264, Speaker B: If we have a GT's which is locally small, we just get the family of small open subsets of x.
00:12:20.044 - 00:12:20.784, Speaker C: And.
00:12:21.524 - 00:12:27.344, Speaker B: These two factors give the isomorphism, they are inverse to each other.
00:12:28.964 - 00:12:33.676, Speaker D: Okay, now we want to pass to.
00:12:33.740 - 00:14:06.954, Speaker B: The definable spaces, right? So we need some additional category, ambient category, in which the locally definable spaces will be contained. So I think that the function shift should stay in the definition to have a good definition, which is coordinate free. So a function shift over a set is a family of functions. Domains are open sets, and this family is closed under restrictions to open subsets and to closed underglowings of compatible families or functions defined on members of an admissible family. And for such function shifts I have the operation of taking image and preimage. So a localism of space over m is a local small space and a function shift over m, right? Morphisms are such functions that are bounded, continuous. So morphisms of local small spaces, and also the condition with the function shifts pre image of a function shift in the code domain should be contained in the function shift in the domain.
00:14:06.954 - 00:14:49.634, Speaker B: So I get this, this lss of m. Now we build locally definable spaces by pieces. One piece is a definable set. So the context is the following. I have any structure and any topology on the underlying set, even not contained, not connected somehow to structure, and I have a definable set d. So I can get all relatively sigma open m definable subsets as the snowpology and all sigma continues. M definable functions as the function sheath.
00:14:49.634 - 00:16:54.264, Speaker B: So this is an object of LSSM, and fine definable spaces are objects of this category, which are isomorphic to objects of this type. Now, definable spaces are such objects of lss of m, which admit an open finite covering by objects of the category of affine definable spaces and locally definable spaces is the category generated by object admitting an admissible covering by objects of the category of affine defined spaces, right? Okay, if sigma is somehow definably in the structure, we can omit sigma, we have just lds of m. And in the special case of omnium expansions of year clause fields, we have the theory of locally definable spaces, right? In particular, a homotopy theory for regular paracompact locally definable spaces. So this was developed in this monograph by Delft and Kleborsch, locally semi algebraic spaces in 85, and it was extended to locally definable omnimal expansions in this rocky mountain paper, right? And we can completely change the definition into this, the above definitions we don't need to use generalized topology at all. Okay, so let's pass to weekly definable spaces.
00:16:56.444 - 00:17:01.076, Speaker D: To define a weekly small space, which.
00:17:01.100 - 00:17:27.160, Speaker B: Is an analog of weekly definable, take an object of LSS. But now elements will be small closed, not small opens. Okay? Now we mimic the definition that was given in the monograph by Knebush. Weekly semi algebraic spaces and exhaustion is.
00:17:27.192 - 00:17:31.644, Speaker D: A family indexed by and partially adapted.
00:17:31.724 - 00:18:11.840, Speaker B: A such that the family covers x. It is increasing, each element has finite height, or infinitely many below it, the family is strongly downward directed, and the family of indexes is directed. If we have such an exhaustion, then members are called pieces. For a given exhaustion, we can define the induced lattice of closed sets, or.
00:18:11.912 - 00:18:17.784, Speaker D: On a piece, the closed sets, the.
00:18:17.824 - 00:18:42.644, Speaker B: Open sets, then admissible coverings or admissible families and small sets. And it appears that always x of x is an object of this this difficult category dt's.
00:18:48.104 - 00:18:49.004, Speaker C: Okay?
00:18:49.304 - 00:19:11.554, Speaker B: And this x of s of x of x will be called a reclusal space. But it's not not a nice category. Some problems may appear.
00:19:11.894 - 00:19:15.486, Speaker D: So, for example, if we have the.
00:19:15.510 - 00:20:21.924, Speaker B: Set of real numbers and the sympology is initial segments, then this gives us an exhaustion. But the whole set of real numbers of natural numbers is small closed and it's not a subset of any piece and also is small clause, but it's not a member of the smokology. So we need additional axiom. A weekly small space is called gneiss if it admits both esmopology and an exhaustion being basis of the bornology, right? Bornology. Remember, it is an ideal of subsets, right? Such that its union is the whole set. So we assume that the small sets.
00:20:23.984 - 00:20:24.724, Speaker C: Are.
00:20:28.304 - 00:20:37.324, Speaker B: Dominated somehow by the and by this exhaustion in p of x.
00:20:40.614 - 00:20:40.974, Speaker C: The.
00:20:41.014 - 00:21:23.814, Speaker B: Space is nice, then this mapology is just the collection of small closed sets, and the family of all closed sets is just the sets compatible with this topology. And this assumption of being nice is not very strong, because if we assume that the space is t one exactly strong dt one, but only strong duty one will be used here. It means that all singletons belong to this topology.
00:21:25.554 - 00:21:26.294, Speaker C: Then.
00:21:28.794 - 00:21:31.220, Speaker D: It is nice, and.
00:21:31.252 - 00:23:04.894, Speaker B: Then all the possible exhaustions are equivalent. Okay, so if we have, if you have very small spaces that are nice, and we want to make a category, right? So what are the amorphisms? It appears that f being bounded continuous, f being strictly continuous, and f being inverse bounded continuous, which means if we reinterpret as locally small spaces, it is bounded continuous. Those three properties are equivalent. So those are our, those are our morphisms. So on the wss we have bounded continuous mappings, but on this nice, really small spaces, right? Any of these definitions can be applied. And also we have wss one. Okay, and now the category of nice weekly small spaces admits a full embedding into locally small spaces.
00:23:04.894 - 00:23:06.454, Speaker B: So.
00:23:10.474 - 00:23:13.842, Speaker D: Again, it will be not needed.
00:23:13.938 - 00:23:38.534, Speaker B: To use genus topological spaces. So if we have a weakly small space defined using Lx and this exhaustion, we forget the exhaustion and reinterpret these elements of Lx from small close to small open. And it appears that the morphisms.
00:23:40.834 - 00:23:41.122, Speaker C: In.
00:23:41.138 - 00:23:43.834, Speaker B: The sense of nice weekly small spaces.
00:23:43.874 - 00:23:46.722, Speaker D: And locally small spaces are equivalent.
00:23:46.778 - 00:23:51.082, Speaker B: So it's good to have such an.
00:23:51.218 - 00:24:05.626, Speaker D: Theorem about for embedding. Okay, now we can come back to definable spaces and we glue together to.
00:24:05.650 - 00:24:10.214, Speaker B: Get rootly definable spaces, object emitting exhaustions.
00:24:10.674 - 00:24:11.414, Speaker C: Now.
00:24:14.874 - 00:24:51.894, Speaker B: A subcategory generated by nice objects and generated by strong duty one objects. And the corollary is that all the theorems from the monograph by Knebos, weekly semi algebraic spaces from 89, and also all the theorems from the Sloky mountain about weekly definable spaces are available using.
00:24:53.314 - 00:25:11.144, Speaker D: These definitions given here, without the use of general topology introduced by Danson Knebus. Okay, and also notice that there also.
00:25:12.204 - 00:26:15.218, Speaker B: An assumption of regularity was used in the definition of a weekly semi algebraic or weakly definable space. Okay, so I have covered this to monographs, and in the, in this third part I want to speak about space of types, let's say, but with the spectral topology. So I want to get appropriate versions of stone duality. So recall that a topological space is coherent. If the compact opens form a basis and are closed under finite non empty intersections, it is almost spectral, or some people call up spectral if it's coherent.
00:26:15.266 - 00:26:19.578, Speaker D: And sober, including t zero, it is.
00:26:19.626 - 00:26:28.982, Speaker B: Spectral if it is compact and almost spectral, and it's budsdringer, it is coherent.
00:26:29.038 - 00:26:34.254, Speaker D: T zero and satisfies a condition which.
00:26:34.294 - 00:27:10.872, Speaker B: Is called b reducibility. By Lorenzo Acosta and map between topological spaces is strongly continuous if it's continuous. And the prey image of fundamental set is always fundamental. But in the context of up spectral spaces, fundamental is equivalent to being compact, open. Okay, so what is the classical stone duality? The category of spectral spaces and spectral.
00:27:10.928 - 00:27:13.160, Speaker D: Maps, which is the same as strongly.
00:27:13.192 - 00:27:55.314, Speaker B: Continuous maps, and the category of bounded distributive lattices. And the homomorphisms are dually equivalent. So one is equivalent to opposite of the second. And here some notations are used. We use the set of prime filters, we use h ballet. Maybe this is important. If I have a homomorphism of bounded lattices, then the operation of taking the prey image of a prime filter is called h ballet.
00:27:55.314 - 00:29:08.194, Speaker B: And, okay, this, the rest is standard. So this was in the thirties of the 20th century and but also new versions of stone duality appear. So there is a colombian mathematician, Lorenzo Acosta, which has such versions define a homomorphism that is proper if the primage of a prime ideal is a prime ideal. And he has the following version. Bob's dwindle spaces and strongly continues maps. This category is dually equivalent to the category of distributive lattices and their proper homomorphisms. Okay, and in a paper with his student in 2019, the category of almost spectral spaces and strongly continuous maps is dual equivalent to the category of.
00:29:11.574 - 00:29:12.678, Speaker C: Distributed.
00:29:12.806 - 00:29:50.934, Speaker B: Lattices with zeros and proper homomorphism. Okay, so for me, it's nice to have my own versions for locally small spaces, which are t zero, small spaces which are t zero, and the local small spaces which are t zero and with special morphisms. So this last is the category of t zero localismal spaces and bounded, strongly continuous maps. Strongly continuous means pray image of a smoke is a smoke.
00:29:51.994 - 00:29:52.894, Speaker C: Okay.
00:29:57.634 - 00:30:51.174, Speaker B: So those categories are equivalent. We have those categories coming from the spectral spaces and coming from lattices. But let's first introduce bornology on a bounded lattice border. Bounded lattice is an ideal such that its subtle is just one. Okay, so what is this most complicated category? Spec Bd. It's AAAA spectral space. Then a bornology in the bounded lattice of compact opens, and a set called descent lamp, which satisfies those three conditions.
00:30:51.174 - 00:30:59.698, Speaker B: Right? Morphism is a spectral map between spectral.
00:30:59.746 - 00:31:04.202, Speaker D: Spaces, respecting the distant lump and satisfying.
00:31:04.258 - 00:31:35.034, Speaker B: A condition of boundedness. So image of some element of the bornology is contained in the bornology in this second space. I don't have enough time to consider what is the example. But the third condition is relevant, cannot be erased. Okay, those are.
00:31:40.734 - 00:31:46.530, Speaker C: Those are this easier.
00:31:46.642 - 00:31:53.294, Speaker D: Categories, just pairs, spectral space and a descent set.
00:31:54.994 - 00:32:48.024, Speaker B: Descent means different sets, different compact opens when restricted to this xd are still different, right? And morphisms are spectral mappings respecting the distance subset. By the way, distance subset is the same as patch dense, so the dense in the conflictable topology and this third category u sped ds is a category of pairs of up spectral space and the distance subset and morphism are bounded strongly continuous maps.
00:32:50.444 - 00:32:54.036, Speaker D: So again a condition of boundedness as.
00:32:54.060 - 00:33:35.304, Speaker B: Above and pre image of compact open is compact open respecting the distance subset and those categories coming from the lattices. Okay, so bounded distributive lattices with bornologies and decent lamps. So bundlestick lattice, bornology on this lattice and a set of planculiters satisfying the following conditions. Polymorphisms are homomorphism of bounded lattices.
00:33:37.004 - 00:33:37.744, Speaker C: Which.
00:33:38.084 - 00:33:50.944, Speaker B: Respect decent lumps and satisfy a condition of domination. And do we have.
00:33:53.104 - 00:33:53.844, Speaker C: The.
00:33:56.504 - 00:34:07.204, Speaker B: Other categories, just pairs, decent bandicoot lattice and distance of pipe filters morphisms.
00:34:09.144 - 00:34:10.520, Speaker D: Homomorphism of bounded.
00:34:10.552 - 00:34:15.604, Speaker B: Lattices respecting the descent set and here.
00:34:18.224 - 00:34:22.304, Speaker D: Distributive lattices with zeros and.
00:34:24.924 - 00:34:25.500, Speaker C: Set of.
00:34:25.532 - 00:35:36.434, Speaker B: Prime filters which is descent and morphism are dominating. This is analogous to this condition of domination dominating homomorphism of lattices with zeros respecting the decent set of primevators. So the proof, if you know what what to what you want to get is is not difficult. We have three three r is restriction factor. Then s is taking a spectrum and a is algebraization factor. So in the restriction factor we restrict to xd to the descent lamp, restrict also this family to d and mappings are restricted to descent sets. In the spectrum we take the set of prime filters with the usual topology.
00:35:40.394 - 00:35:47.534, Speaker D: And we produce ls tilde and take the same DL.
00:35:49.634 - 00:35:59.054, Speaker B: And the inverted homomorphism of lattices goes to this h ballet.
00:36:04.274 - 00:36:08.752, Speaker D: And algebraization involves lx zero.
00:36:08.808 - 00:37:08.454, Speaker B: It is important that we cannot stop at Lx. We need to produce Lx zero, right? Then we get equivalency. So Lx zero, the open set, the smops and x hat. Here is the operation of taking the pre image, which is easy and we have natural isomorphism. Okay, how much time do I have? So I have some bibliography here, but I don't know if it will be useful to say something about this monster category gt's, but it seems that I have some time, right?
00:37:10.314 - 00:37:10.762, Speaker A: Yes.
00:37:10.818 - 00:37:11.414, Speaker B: You.
00:37:14.554 - 00:37:21.734, Speaker A: Still have three minutes or depending or a bit more if you depending on the questions.
00:37:23.634 - 00:37:31.044, Speaker B: But I started ten past. Yes, so I have 13 minutes, right?
00:37:33.304 - 00:37:40.084, Speaker A: 15 minutes, so. Oh yes, sorry. So you are still ten minutes. Sorry.
00:37:41.184 - 00:37:52.116, Speaker B: Okay, so maybe I will tell sank. So what is the history? In the sixties, Grodendi introduced the brodendic topologies.
00:37:52.280 - 00:37:56.820, Speaker D: So maybe pre topologies are easier to.
00:37:56.852 - 00:38:51.964, Speaker B: Describe with such axioms, which is completely abstract. Then it is not stated in these monographs by death and Knebos, but in the 1984, in rigid analytic geometry, g topologies were used. G topologies are concrete versions of grodnik topologies. So we assume that we have some subset of the power set and inclusions amorphisms. And we assume that, that the covering families are families in the usual sense.
00:38:53.784 - 00:38:54.312, Speaker C: Right?
00:38:54.408 - 00:39:22.624, Speaker B: And the products are taken from, from this p of x. So this means that intersection of two opens, opens. So these members of this family operate category are called admissible open sets.
00:39:23.244 - 00:39:23.984, Speaker C: And.
00:39:26.524 - 00:39:31.916, Speaker B: We have admissible families on such.
00:39:31.980 - 00:39:36.024, Speaker D: Objects, admissible or covering families.
00:39:36.694 - 00:39:39.834, Speaker B: And usually g zero g one g two is added.
00:39:42.734 - 00:39:43.686, Speaker C: And we get a.
00:39:43.710 - 00:40:48.756, Speaker B: Continuous map between g topological spaces. So, primitive of open admissible set is open admissible and primitive of admissible families. And admissible families, right? Okay, so in 1985, those generalized topologies with eight axioms were introduced. But what is the difference between the previous one is that finite unions of open admissible sets are open admissible and all finite families are admissible. Right? So based on this, Delta and Knebosch produced this semi algebraic chromatopy theory. Now, I want to simplified definition, but I need some notation, right? So finance of family, yes? So a refinement with the same union. This is family intersection, right? Family intersection.
00:40:48.756 - 00:41:10.146, Speaker B: If I stay this with the set, it means it is singleton on the side. And also sometimes, for example, sometimes family of families operations are used and. Right, this is also an operation of.
00:41:10.170 - 00:41:13.402, Speaker D: Families of families union.
00:41:13.458 - 00:42:21.944, Speaker B: One is the family of unions. Okay, so what is this simplified definition with only five axioms? It's this. A generalized topological space is x set x with open subsets and admissible coverings or admissible families satisfying those actions. Right? Satisfying axioms which are quite complicated. Okay, then a map is strictly continuous. If the frame of admissible families, admissible family, we get a category of GT's, it is a larger version of the category of topological spaces, right? So, top fully embeds into category of.
00:42:22.064 - 00:42:38.312, Speaker D: Partially topological spaces, which is a full subcategory of just generalized topological spaces. And so many notions have several variants.
00:42:38.368 - 00:42:47.428, Speaker B: For example, the weakly and strongly t one spaces. And the key notion is smallness, right?
00:42:47.596 - 00:42:52.404, Speaker D: A set is small if for each.
00:42:52.444 - 00:44:01.304, Speaker B: Admissible family covering some open set u. If we restrict this u to k, it becomes essentially finite. So the family of small sets is a bornology, and each strictly, each strictly continuous mapping is a bounded mapping in these bornologies. And as space is small, if the cone x is a small set, which means that only essentially finite open families are admissible. So ss also can be described this way. Now we have a gluing principle. We can glue general topological spaces.
00:44:01.304 - 00:44:46.356, Speaker B: If we have a family of such spaces intersecting along open subsets, then on the union we can introduce only one generous topology such that those become open subspaces, and this family of your eyes becomes admissible. And you have. So we can write X is the admissible union of these pieces, right? A space is locally small if X is an admissible union of some family of small opens.
00:44:46.460 - 00:44:49.636, Speaker D: But also we can say of the.
00:44:49.660 - 00:45:03.124, Speaker B: Family all small opens. So we can get this Lss as a subcategory of GTS, right?
00:45:03.624 - 00:45:10.444, Speaker D: Lss in the old language. Okay, so this is.
00:45:19.644 - 00:45:42.744, Speaker B: Operates this first theorem and also appendix four. What is the use of locally definable spaces and weakly definable spaces? For example, a minimal homotopy theory. Okay, homotopy is a morphe from some space times unit interval to another space.
00:45:44.224 - 00:45:44.964, Speaker C: And.
00:45:46.704 - 00:46:29.156, Speaker B: What can we get? A large part of homotopy theory which can be transported from the reals. So if we consider regular para compact locally definable spaces, then it is the same as at least the homotypic categories are equivalent. So practically it is the same as regular local semi algebraic spaces. And even more homotopy theory is available if we pass to weakly definable spaces.
00:46:29.340 - 00:46:30.064, Speaker C: Because.
00:46:32.204 - 00:47:24.218, Speaker B: We have access to CW complexes. So the conclusion is that topological CW complexes, semi algebraic W complexes and definable CW complexes, all these homotopy categories are equivalent. Similar facts hold for decreasing system of CW complexes. So we can transport from the reals to other models, right? Actually from the real store real algebraic numbers and from real algebraic numbers to any other model. Okay, if we have models of some.
00:47:24.266 - 00:47:28.178, Speaker D: Theory which are called bounded, bounded means.
00:47:28.226 - 00:47:39.734, Speaker B: For me that if I take the prime model and an element which realizes plus infinity, then this p of a.
00:47:40.194 - 00:47:46.730, Speaker D: Has counter book of finality, then also CW complexes.
00:47:46.882 - 00:48:13.554, Speaker B: This category is equivalent to all weakly definable spaces over any model of T. So all the hamotopy theory agrees with the usual one. And also since we have CW complexes and pointed with polytopes.
00:48:16.934 - 00:48:17.974, Speaker C: So we can.
00:48:18.094 - 00:48:29.784, Speaker B: Have the generalized homology and homology theories. Which analogue goes to usual topological hemosby theory?
00:48:31.724 - 00:48:36.664, Speaker D: Okay, so those are my slides.
00:48:39.524 - 00:48:43.184, Speaker B: Thank you for listening, and I'm open to questions.
00:48:45.184 - 00:49:49.174, Speaker A: Thank you, Arthur. Are there any questions or comments? Well, maybe just a naive question from my partner. What is the difference between weekly small spaces and space with bornologies? I was not sure to get it at the beginning of your talk.
00:49:50.274 - 00:49:51.814, Speaker B: Weekly small space.
00:49:52.394 - 00:49:53.174, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:49:57.954 - 00:49:59.974, Speaker B: Do we mean this? Right.
00:50:02.154 - 00:50:04.998, Speaker A: So might be nice or not nice.
00:50:05.046 - 00:50:05.582, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:50:05.638 - 00:50:06.278, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:06.446 - 00:50:06.798, Speaker C: Yes.
00:50:06.846 - 00:50:17.034, Speaker B: Okay, so weekly small space is such a space that admits an exhaustion, right?
00:50:17.494 - 00:50:18.434, Speaker A: Okay.
00:50:19.494 - 00:50:20.554, Speaker D: Of course.
00:50:25.374 - 00:50:25.806, Speaker C: Right?
00:50:25.870 - 00:50:29.834, Speaker B: If we have such an exhaustion, then.
00:50:30.384 - 00:50:32.924, Speaker D: We have a GT's.
00:50:34.024 - 00:50:34.656, Speaker C: Okay.
00:50:34.720 - 00:50:56.284, Speaker B: And we have the notion of smallness. So smops, for example, for at the beginning, right, for localismal spaces are just such open sets that are small.
00:50:57.924 - 00:51:09.544, Speaker D: This somehow induces both open sets and small sets in the weekly, weekly small spaces.
00:51:09.844 - 00:51:39.864, Speaker B: Okay. You need this axiom of being nice. If you have nice, then small set is a subset of esmopology, this LX, or just a subset of some piece. So bodnology, the small sets, is somehow a part of the structure.
00:51:52.224 - 00:51:53.160, Speaker A: Okay, thank you.
00:51:53.232 - 00:51:58.444, Speaker B: We need to also say, what is open set? What is closed set?
00:51:59.384 - 00:51:59.832, Speaker C: Yes.
00:51:59.888 - 00:52:01.124, Speaker D: In the strong sense.
00:52:23.524 - 00:52:33.984, Speaker A: Are there other questions? Okay, well, let's thank Arthur again.
00:52:35.204 - 00:52:36.584, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
00:52:39.044 - 00:52:40.364, Speaker A: And I stopped the recording.
