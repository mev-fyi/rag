And a lot of that, there's been a lot of research done actually on how students are basically taught by learning whole numbers first, and then they start to think of these fractions and other relationships as parts of whole numbers instead of seeing them as numbers in and of themselves. I've seen some really good research and studies that have looked at really teaching these concepts on a number line in relationship to whole numbers. So even thinking of whole numbers as fractions, any whole number can be written as a fraction by simply putting it over one. And by looking at those types of things, students can start to develop a bit more understanding of how fractions relate to one another. And then if we start looking at how fractions relate to decimals, then we can start seeing how they relate to percentages and we can start looking at basically the patterns that start emerging between these different types of numbers.
