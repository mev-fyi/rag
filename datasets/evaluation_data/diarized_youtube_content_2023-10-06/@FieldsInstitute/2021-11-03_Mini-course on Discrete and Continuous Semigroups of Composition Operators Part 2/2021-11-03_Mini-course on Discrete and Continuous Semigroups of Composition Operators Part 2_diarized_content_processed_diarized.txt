00:00:00.160 - 00:00:12.394, Speaker A: Pleasure to announce our first speaker of the day, Isabel challender from Universita Leon, who will continue her mini course on semi groups of composition operators. Please.
00:00:12.694 - 00:02:17.036, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you very much. So, yesterday, in the last minutes, I mentioned that there are some well known, sufficient conditions to get a c zero semen group when you consider semigroups of composition operators on a banner space which embeds continuously in the fresh space here, provided that f with phi t is still in the space. And I also mentioned that I didn't write it, so I will write it carefully recently. So that's a paper was already mentioned by my student Eddie Bernard yesterday night. There's a paper due to Eva Gallardo, Siskakis and Jacobo. They proved that they generalized the result due to Blasco and other people, which says the provided you have an x satisfying those conditions and such that x is between h infinity and the blower space was mentioned yesterday, then the semigroup is not a c zero semigroup, so we lose the strong continuity.
00:02:17.036 - 00:03:15.184, Speaker B: So it means that this is not always the case. That's just a remark. Okay. And it was. This result was known for h infinity and b. And this was proved already known, or XT and XB, its work in 2013 by Glasgow and other people, Contreras, Jasmine, regal, Martinez, Papad, Dimitriakis and seskakis. Okay, so, as I mentioned yesterday, the aim is to understand the asymptotic behavior.
00:03:15.184 - 00:04:43.204, Speaker B: So we would like to understand the asymptotic behavior of simp, when t tends to infinity, in the case when our semigroup of composition is a c zero semigroup. And what we expect is a criteria involving the generator. So we are looking for a criteria on its generator. That's why we are interested in c zero group. And what we will do first is to study the discrete case. I mean, we just take one composition and we take its powers so that we have an idea of what may happen. So we first consider the discrete case.
00:04:43.204 - 00:06:20.374, Speaker B: So it means we have a c phi linear, unbounded, or a phi. And we just study. We first study the powers. And so there are many different way to consider this convergence. And what is interesting is that c phi n, in fact, is equal to c phi n, where phi n is phi composed with itself n types. So the powers of composition is still a composition operators. Okay, so we will consider today just the free mode of convergence, because we have many topologies on L.
00:06:20.374 - 00:07:52.838, Speaker B: The first one is the strongest one is the uniform convergence. So the convergency norm. So u means you are multiplying a p linear unbounded such that unknown, you have this, or you have something which is very natural and weaker, which is this strong convergence. So you have a p such that for any x c phi n of x minus px times 20, or you, you have even a weaker form of convergence, which is the weak convergence, saying that you have this. But for the weak topology, so you have a p, you expect a p such at rni x c phi n x tends weakly to p of x. Okay, so by definition you have those inclusions. There is also a notion of ergodicity.
00:07:52.838 - 00:09:30.094, Speaker B: I mean, so that's the convergence of the c zero sum of tn. But okay, today we will speak to these three types of convergence. And anyway, for any type of convergence, p is automatically the projection onto the fixed point of T. It means the x such that tx equal to x along the decomposition, the fixed point directs on the closure of the image of identity minus t. And I take the closure. Okay. And, okay, what happens is that the uniform convergence, so the strongest one, the U here, is in fact closely linked to spectral properties of T.
00:09:30.094 - 00:09:57.208, Speaker B: So that's a very important idea. Is that the uniform. Oh, sorry, I see a question. What is T? Oh, sorry. Thank you, thank you, Jevad. T is c five. I mean, when I.
00:09:57.208 - 00:10:57.704, Speaker B: Okay, thank you, Jeanne. When you consider the problem of convergence of the 80 rates, you can consider that problem for any kind of operator. So in our case, we take the composition, so t is c five. Thanks. Okay, the uniform convergence is closely linked to spectral properties of Rc five. Indeed. We will use the following results.
00:10:57.704 - 00:12:14.414, Speaker B: So I put the big theorem in red. So this theorem is in the book of Nigel, one parameter semigroups of positive operators. So it's in the appendix of this book, one parameter of semic groups of positive operator, and it says the following. So I take a t, not necessarily. So let t that's a real t is not the c five we have seen previously. So when you have a t in l and assume that t is power bounded, it means that the soup of the norm of t n is bounded. Okay, Ben, the following assertions are equivalent.
00:12:14.414 - 00:14:12.934, Speaker B: The first one is that the limit of tn exists for the norm operator, the strongest topology, and it is a finite rank operator. This is equivalent to the following conditions. The first one is that the essential radius of t is strictly less than one, plus the fact that the point spectrum of t intersected with the unit circle is included in one. So it may be empty, but it's at most one. And the third condition is that if one is in the spectrum of t. Then one is a pole of the resolvent of t. That is, it's a function of order one, and in this case p is the residue at one.
00:14:12.934 - 00:15:46.014, Speaker B: Okay, so you see that any lower bounded operator will have a convergence in the strongest topology, even only if you have those three conditions which are really spectral condition. So that's the essential spectral resource, okay, and that's what we will use in the cycle. But maybe because it's an important result in what follows, I will do the proof of that will give you an idea of the proof. Okay, so I have to change the page. Okay, so the proof, okay, it's, it's a pity that I can't have all the propositions. So remember, the first one is that the I means that p is the limit. Okay, so one implied two.
00:15:46.014 - 00:17:49.964, Speaker B: To do that, we take x one equal to the image of p. Next two is identified, apply to x and t I is t restricted to xi for, oh, sorry, I have a question. Do you mean that the rank of p is residue at one? No, I mean the resolvement is, is a vector valued mapping. So I really mean that when you decompose your resolvent, the coefficient is now an operator. Is it okay for you, shabbat? Okay, okay, so for I between one and two, okay, so then the norm of t two to the focal, nice. As an application on x two tends to zero as n tends to infinity. So the spectrum radius is strictly less than one.
00:17:49.964 - 00:19:14.574, Speaker B: And now since the spectrum of t is the spectrum of t one union, the spectrum of t two, because of this decomposition, and t one is projection. So you have one union the spectrum of t two. And when you look at the resolvent, you can check that it is in fact equal to one over lambda minus one, p on x one, and just lambda identity minus t two inverse on x two. Okay, so then two follows. And now I'll give you the main ideas of the reciprocal implications. So two implies one. So we have the free condition abc and we'd like to prove that we have convergence.
00:19:14.574 - 00:21:21.924, Speaker B: So let p be the residue at one x one equal to px x two is still identity minus p x and still ti is the restriction. Then the spectrum of t one is reduced to one, the spectrum of t two. This is just the spectrum of t minus one by hypothesis a and b. Okay, so it follows that the spectral radius of t two is strictly less than one. And so it follows, but t two to the n tends to zero. And then it follows from c 31 is diagonal, and that's td one with the identity, because this spectrum is one. So that's main idea of the proof.
00:21:21.924 - 00:23:03.160, Speaker B: And it will be essential in the cycle because. Well, so we have. I just go back to theorem. Okay, you can see that you have a criteria which are quite easy to check and not very complicated. I just would like to mention that there are other criteria with spectral conditions in order to characterize the strong convergence, not the uniform convergence due to arendt and baty in 88, they obtain criteria in order to get the strong convergence, but they are not so easy to check and not so simple, which is not surprising. But anyway, in our case, in the case of composition operators on our banner space embedding in old d, it happens that we will always have the equivalence between the strong convergence and the uniform convergence. So that's why we don't need this criteria.
00:23:03.160 - 00:24:36.662, Speaker B: And in our case, the criteria for the uniform convergence is enough. Okay, so now I will present a theorem in our context, it's more or less a collary of the criteria I have just presented. And so now the work I am presenting here is a joint work with Volkan Garand, Mahesh Kumar and Sachi Trivastava. Okay, so what happens is the following. Let phi be analytic. Assume that the composition, so we have an x, which is a banner space, and we assume that decomposition is well defined and linear continuous, which is a strong hypothesis. I mean, we have seen with the examples given on the h infinity or block space or other.
00:24:36.662 - 00:25:56.634, Speaker B: Well, no, sorry, sorry. For any phi, an arbitrary phi, it's not true that C phi is always well defined on x embedding all d. For example, when you take a fine, which is a Blaschke product of infinite degree, and you take directly space, the composition is not well defined on the directly space. So that's a strong hypothesis. But in this case, what we get, thanks to the previous one, is that c phi, nice, converges uniformly if and only if the essential spectral radius is strictly less than one. So if you remember in the previous theorem you had so, provided this is a power bounded, then the convergence to a finite rank operator, which is the case here, is equivalent to three conditions. And in fact, the two, b and c are automatic.
00:25:56.634 - 00:27:58.062, Speaker B: So now we have a very simple criteria to check the uniform convergence. It's just a matter of studying the essential spectrum of c phi. So it means that we, our problem is now reduced. To study the essential spectrum was essential spectrophratus of C phi. And as previously we denoted by, we denote by phi n is the composition of phi enzymes. Okay, and I remind you the tangible theory, which says the you take a phi which is analytic, and we exclude the case where phi is an elliptical diplomatism. We assume that phi is not conjugate to rotation.
00:27:58.062 - 00:30:02.654, Speaker B: So we assume that phi is not an elliptic automorphism, which says exactly for people who are not familiar with that phi, phi is an elliptic automatism if and only if phi as the form a certain function like that, it's PI. Alpha is defined like that which is in fact equal to its inverse. Alpha is in the open unit disk and r theta is the rotation. So in other words, elliptic automatism are the ones which are conjugate to rotation. So Dan Ralph theory says that provided phi is not analytic automotiveism, then it's iterates. Sorry, I changed the notation. Then this sequence in old D converges uniformly to a point in the closed unit disk.
00:30:02.654 - 00:31:44.154, Speaker B: So converges uniformly to an alpha, a unique alpha in the closed unit disk on every compact subset of D. And such alpha is called the dungeon wolf point associated with phi. Okay, so let's, let's first consider the case where, okay, so the first case which is easy to deal with is the case where the dangervalt point is on the boundary. So assume that we have a phi which is not analytic. At noxm there is a dangerous point. And assume that this Benjamin point is on the unit circle. Okay, and suppose moreover, quite natural hypothesis, which is satisfied in all the classical banner space we consider.
00:31:44.154 - 00:34:10.384, Speaker B: So suppose that the polynomial are in our panel space. And assume that provided we have, each time we have a linear form, an element of the dual of x satisfying that l of en, the en are the z to the n. Then, provided you have an element in the dual satisfying base, suppose that it is automatically an evaluation for some z zero in D, where we already use this notation. But okay then, so assume we have this kind of space, it contains the polynomial, and provided we have an element in the duals, despite inverts automatically, it's an evaluation. Then, when the tangible point is on the boundary, it happens that the sip of c phi nice is infinity. And the same thing is true for all subsequences of integers, and therefore we don't have the weak convergence. Therefore, even the weak convergence is not satisfied, is not true.
00:34:10.384 - 00:36:16.834, Speaker B: Okay, I just give you the proof of that. Indeed, if the slip of c phi m was bounded, you take in fact, f of alpha is obtained as the limit of f of phi and at zero, because the danger wall theory asserts that this guy tends to hit the deja wall point automatically, since zero is a compact, obviously, and because of the continuity of the function. So you have that, and this should be bounded by the norm of the evaluation at zero times m, the slip of c phi n times f. So the evaluation at alpha should be equal to delta z zero for some z zero in the opening disk. And this is not true. So you have a contradiction. Okay, so the case where the tangible point is on the boundary in many banner space we consider leaf implies that there is no convergence at all.
00:36:16.834 - 00:38:10.264, Speaker B: I mean no weak convergence, so no other kind of convergence. So to summarize, it means that if the dangerous point is one in many cases, no, no convergence at all. Okay, so the most interesting case is when the dodgebolt point is inside the disc. And in this case the good candidate for p is a rank one operator, which is the evaluation at alpha. And this is a rank one operator. And I will just first mention the result we obtained in the case of the hard space. So 1st 1st result we obtain, I will present it in a tableau like that.
00:38:10.264 - 00:39:56.364, Speaker B: So we have the uniform convergence, the strong convergence, or even the weak convergence. And here I put the space hp banner space. So for p between one and infinity. Okay, so what we get is that we get the uniform convergence if and only if r phi is not an inner function and with tanger volt point strictly less than one. The same is true for the strong convergence. There is no difference of for the class of functions for which we have the results and we have the weak convergence even on if the tangent wall point is in the opening disk. The way we do that is just as we mentioned previously is due to the fact that to get this, we proved that the essential spectral radius of c phi is strictly less than one on h two.
00:39:56.364 - 00:43:19.438, Speaker B: This is equivalent to the fact that file is not inner and alpha is in the open unit disk. And in fact, just to say that one application is abuse, because when, okay, which one is one application is obvious since, well, a well known fact on Hp is the following. When phi is inner and with Benjamin point in the opening disk, then it happens that this is a criteria to get that c phi is similar to an isometry. Okay, so that's result on h two. And the way we deduce the result on Hp once we have this for h two is due to result due to. So thanks to a result of Chapiro in 88, because he proved that the essential spectral radius on h two or c phi to the power two is in fact equal to the one on Hp or c phi to the p for p between one and infinity, and for p one, we lose the equality. But we have an inequality.
00:43:19.438 - 00:44:27.754, Speaker B: We have the inequality in the good way. So it follows that the essential spectral radius on h two or c five is less, three less than one. This implies the same for Hp. So from h two, we deduce the result for any Hp. Okay, so I presented the result on the famous hardy space. But we can also prove, we can also obtain criteria for other spaces, such as weighted background spaces. And maybe I will present all the results in a tableau.
00:44:27.754 - 00:45:30.158, Speaker B: So here is various spaces on which we can conclude the convergence and the complete criteria. So here is a column for the spaces, the uniform convergence, the strong convergence, and the weak convergence. So for hp, we already mentioned that, but that's maybe one of the most interesting case, because we have the following criteria. Phi is not an inner function, and the durable point is in the opening disk. The same criteria. This is not enough. And for the week it's automatic.
00:45:30.158 - 00:45:58.374, Speaker B: As soon as the. Well, it's equivalent to have a tangible point inside. For the weighted diagram space, a beta p. We'll give the definition later. For beta, strictly less greater than minus one, and p finite. The criteria is quite different. It's just the facts.
00:45:58.374 - 00:47:41.032, Speaker B: Okay, in all this story, we always assume that, because when I talk about tangent point, I always assume that phi is not an elliptic dimorphism, because in this case, we have no tanjaval point. Okay, so here it means that, okay, so the convergence, the uniform convergence is equivalent to all the convergence, all the modes of convergence. And it's just the method to check that the tangible point is inside. For the little b zero presented by Pascal yesterday, it's the same for b alpha, sorry, b alpha here, with alpha greater than one, we have the same criteria and also other spaces. Okay? I mean, the criteria is always the same. The tangible point must be inside. There is no difference between all the modes of convergence.
00:47:41.032 - 00:49:06.034, Speaker B: So here I will call the definition of what is b. That's a setup. Holomorphic function, search by the zip of this is finite, and this one is the same with the limit, and z tends to one, which is zero. And for b alpha, you just put an alpha here. Okay, so I am. Well, I should mention that on b and b alpha, it's not true that any kind of phi which is not elliptic automobilesm is well defined. So of course you need to have an extra condition on the phi, so that the composition is well defined here.
00:49:06.034 - 00:49:33.194, Speaker B: But for any kind of spaces, any phi which is not an elliptical tomatoism is well defined. The c five is well defined also. I see too much, too much alpha. Oh yes, yes. Okay. Yes. Alpha is really the worst notation.
00:49:33.194 - 00:49:58.124, Speaker B: Okay. Gamma maybe. Yeah. Thank you. Best kind. Okay. So Ghana, okay.
00:49:58.124 - 00:50:46.254, Speaker B: Okay. I think it's correct. Okay, thanks. Okay. And just to conclude, I would like to mention that as a byproduct of, of this study of the asymptotic behavior of a composition, it happens that we get automatically a description of what are the composition operators which are isometric or similar to an isometry. So I just finished with another concluded remarks. Concluding remark.
00:50:46.254 - 00:52:25.564, Speaker B: As a byproduct, we get on all the spaces where we can describe the asymptotic behavior. We get characterizations of isometric and similar to isometry. Composition of radius indeed. So here I put the spaces here I would like c five as a matrix or c five similarly. And we get the following result. For hv, we get phi inner and tensorflow point must be zero. Similarity to anozymetry is the fact that you have fixed point inside and you have an inner function for all the weighted background space.
00:52:25.564 - 00:54:07.364, Speaker B: You have to be an isometry is just to have rotation. Here you have an elliptic automotive, okay. On the blouse space for example, and maybe I will finish with this example, we get that PI of zero equal to zero and a certain quantity called infinity associated with phi equal to one. And to be similar to anozymetry is the fact that you have fixed point inside and the same where this quantity is the soup on the opening disk of one minus modulus of z squared over one minus phi of z squared times phi prime. Okay. Okay. So the way we do that is just that.
00:54:07.364 - 00:54:59.664, Speaker B: When we have convergence to rank one operator, obviously it can be an isometry, it can be similar to an isometric. And so we just have a look to the remaining case which are inner functions. And then it's well known fact that for inner functions fixing zero, that's exactly the charisation of the isometry. And due to Frederick Bailla, we know that the functions which are similar to an isometry are exactly the one associated with the phi inner with a fixed point inside. And here, if we avoid rotations or elliptic automobism, we have seen that c find n tends to rank one operator. So no way to be isometric or similar to an isometric. And for those one it's obvious.
00:54:59.664 - 00:55:20.034, Speaker B: Okay, so that's the way we get a full description on many spaces of isometry which are composition or similarity to isometry. Okay, thank you very much. Stop here.
00:55:21.974 - 00:55:36.194, Speaker A: Wonderful talk. Let's thank Isabel. Any questions, comments, suggestions? You can shout them out or type them in the chat.
00:55:38.694 - 00:55:50.768, Speaker C: Sorry, is that the part that I misunderstood? Do you mean that you do the expansion and just the principal part is your p at the very beginning?
00:55:50.936 - 00:55:59.004, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay.
00:56:13.184 - 00:56:20.004, Speaker C: Somewhere here that p was the. Maybe it was before the proof.
00:56:20.504 - 00:56:21.444, Speaker B: Okay.
00:56:31.024 - 00:56:35.724, Speaker C: Yes, here it is. P is the residue at one.
00:56:37.844 - 00:56:47.104, Speaker B: So you decompose this as a automatic function with coefficients in the space of linear and bounded operator.
00:56:47.444 - 00:56:57.544, Speaker C: Okay. And just you keep that part exactly. Okay, it's clear now. Thank you.
00:56:59.804 - 00:57:05.684, Speaker A: More questions? Well, if not, let's thank Isabel again.
00:57:06.784 - 00:57:07.724, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:57:08.384 - 00:57:11.704, Speaker A: And we have a very short break. Maybe about three minutes.
