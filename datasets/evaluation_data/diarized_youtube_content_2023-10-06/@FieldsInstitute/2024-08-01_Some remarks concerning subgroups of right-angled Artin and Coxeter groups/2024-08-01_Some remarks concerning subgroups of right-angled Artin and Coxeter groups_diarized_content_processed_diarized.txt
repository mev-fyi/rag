00:00:00.160 - 00:00:34.950, Speaker A: Our next speaker graciously agreed to move his talk to Tuesday to help us out. We got Ian Leary from University of Southampton who will talk about. I carry them some stuff. Yeah, some great mathematics. Thank you, Graham. Thank you, everybody, for allowing me to be here and for allowing me to give a talk. It's my first visit to the Fields institute.
00:00:34.950 - 00:01:26.296, Speaker A: Yeah, that looks a nice way to spend the afternoon. So I feel a bit of a fraud here, really. I don't really have anything new to say about polyhedral products and the new things I was hoping to talk about. I think we've decided there isn't enough new to be able to do anything with them anyway, but anyway, so I'm going to talk about. It's probably a good last thing in the afternoon talk anyway. Oh, yeah, there's sort of open problems but they're horrible, famous, notorious open problems so I didn't want to mention them in the problem session because they're not the sort of problem you should think about really. But anyway, polyhedral products do come in, so.
00:01:26.296 - 00:01:51.760, Speaker A: Yeah, polyhedral products. I mean, I'm a group theorist. My favorite polyhedral products are. I mean, again, taras Panoff mentioned them yesterday. So we've got the circle and a point. That's one. And this yields right angled arting groups.
00:01:51.760 - 00:03:14.800, Speaker A: Maybe I'll abbreviate that as rags. And the other one is, I guess I want an interval and its endpoints and maybe the interval is going to go from minus one to one because I'm going to swap the endpoints as well at some point and that just feels more natural to have an interval whose ends are. I don't know. Graham thinks it's a reasonable thing to do but maybe I shouldn't call it I. Because I usually goes from zero to one, doesn't it? It's still an interval. Still an interval, yeah, it's a more interval or something and this is going to give us right angled coccida groups and so we. Oh, time's passing quickly, isn't it? We've got either a graph, a simple equals simplicial graph, or its flag complex.
00:03:14.800 - 00:04:21.180, Speaker A: So a flag complex, its cleat complex and again, we know why we want to take flag complexes for from a group theoretic point of view, again, as Taras Panoff said yesterday, a family of elements of different groups commute if and only if any two of them commute. So if we've got the edges of a simplex, we're going to put the whole simplex in. So that's why we only want to consider flag complexes. So I'm going to write a sub gamma for a graph, but I'll probably have a sub l is my letter for a flag complex. I don't know. So this is the fundamental group of the polyhedral product for the circle and the flag complex l. Again, we could write out generators and relations.
00:04:21.180 - 00:05:21.414, Speaker A: We've got the generators v, the elements of the zero simplices of L. And the only relations we've got are the v and w commute if v w is an edge. Okay, and then the other one. Well, I'm going to write down the right angled Coxeter group. And I'm going to start with this. So we're going to have again just the vertices of L and then we're going to have that each vertex corresponds now to an element of order two and then this commutation relation. We could also think of that as vw squared.
00:05:21.414 - 00:06:52.750, Speaker A: But no, let's just stick with it being a commutation thing. Okay. And so obviously there's a subjective homomorphism from here to here where we sort of forget what the, you know, we add in the extra relations that's, that's given us a subjective homomorphism from this group to this group. I haven't told you how to interpret this group in terms of this thing here. So the thing is, we don't quite want the fundamental group of this thing. So cyclic two acts on the interval by x goes to minus x and that swaps the two ends. And so then if we've been, everybody's been using m for the number of vertices of the simplicial complex, haven't they? So cyclic two to the m acts on the polyhedral product by flipping the coordinates separately.
00:06:52.750 - 00:07:49.062, Speaker A: We've got as many generators as we've got coordinates and we swap the coordinates separately. So then that gives an action. Well, yeah, I guess I want to say then. So wl is the group of. So again, we could define the fundamental group. So, yeah, what I really want is we've got PI, one of this polyhedral product, and then we've got the cockstag and then we've got the quotient. Yeah, but I want to say that in a more accurate way.
00:07:49.062 - 00:08:53.490, Speaker A: So the way I'm going to say that is we have this gives us two to the m self maps of this space. The fundamental group is the group of deck transformations of the universal cover. So the group of all self maps of the universal cover, that map down to the identity map on this. So the whole Coxeter group is the group of. So it's the group of self maps of the universal cover. I don't know. I haven't got enough notation for anything, have I? So not just the ones that map down to the identity, but the ones that map down to the action of any one of these elements.
00:08:53.990 - 00:08:54.810, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:56.590 - 00:10:10.870, Speaker A: That project down to some elements of c two to the m acting on the polyhedral product. Right. So again, we could have gone through rp infinity relative to a point, and then we could have looked at the universal cover of that, and then we could have used this, this nice theorem about the infinity sphere and the two points, the infinity sphere and the pair of antipodal points. The infinity sphere is contractible and cyclic two acts freely on it. And again, as Tara said yesterday, we can replace that infinity sphere by any other contractible space. But the catch is if when we replaced it by a finite dimensional contractible space, cyclic two can't act freely on it anymore. We've got this fixed point in the middle by the Pa Smith theorem or something.
00:10:10.870 - 00:10:34.920, Speaker A: So we're not making an, a universal cover of a kg one. We've not started with a kg one. This universal cover gets is called the Davis complex. Same Davis as usual in these talks. So this group isn't torsion free. It's not a split extension in general. I mean, you can see when it's going to be split.
00:10:34.920 - 00:10:57.400, Speaker A: Let's do the two simplest examples. If we have just two points for l, then we've got two generators of order two and no relation. How am I going to get.
00:10:59.700 - 00:11:00.012, Speaker B: Where.
00:11:00.036 - 00:11:43.190, Speaker A: Do I get my. Oh yeah, my polyhedral product's a square. Isn't it great? My polyhedral product is the boundary of a square, and one of my two generators is acting like that. And one of my two generators is acting like that. And when I pass to the universal cover, I'm getting the line and one of the lifts of a is acting there and one of the lifts of b is acting there, and their composite is a translation. So this is the infant dihedral group. Notice that there was nothing in the middle of the square.
00:11:43.190 - 00:12:41.480, Speaker A: There's no cyclic two, cross cyclic two in this group. Whereas if we did, l equals two points joined by a line, the picture looks the same. But now I'm coloring in the square. Now it's its own universal cover and I've just got these four elements, and now we've got cyclic two, cross cyclex two instead of infinite dihedral. You want me to stop now, don't you? For various reasons. I mean, some things are known about Coxeter groups. So, for example, every right angled Coxeter group.
00:12:41.480 - 00:13:14.670, Speaker A: So one of these cox groups is linear over the integers so that it has a faithful finite dimensional. In fact, I think you need twice as big a dimension as the number of generators or something for the natural choice. I can't remember. It's either twice as many or exactly as many. Anyway, this group embeds in the general linear group over the integers. And you might want to know that the arten groups do as well. And one of the simplest ways to do that is to embed the arten group in the cockstag group.
00:13:14.670 - 00:13:59.010, Speaker A: So the one generator RTN group is the infinite cyclic group. We can embed the infinite cyclic group in the infinite dihedral group. Right, that's fine. And then we could. So the right angled arching group equals the graph product of infinite cyclic groups. We could embed that in the same graph product of infinite dihedral groups.
00:14:00.190 - 00:14:01.010, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:02.270 - 00:14:50.566, Speaker A: So here I'm thinking, you know, I guess I've got a third, a third instance, haven't I? Instead of just having cyclic two as my groups that I'm taking the graph product of, I'm now taking free product of two cyclic twos. Okay, so that's fine. That does. Oh, and so this is equals a right angled arting group, a right angled coccet group. But it's for a different complex. It's the right angled Coxeter group for a new complex. So if you think about it, this was the one generator, right angled arson group.
00:14:50.566 - 00:14:56.222, Speaker A: This is the two generator, right angled Cox to group where the two generators are not joined to each other.
00:14:56.366 - 00:14:57.158, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:57.334 - 00:15:48.430, Speaker A: So what we've done here is we've replaced our original, if we want to write this as a right angled Cox group, we've replaced our original lithe with something new that has two new vertices for every old vertex and the two new vertices. We're going to say we're going to replace v by v one and v two and then. Hang on, now let's call them v primed and v double primed. Yeah. And so then if we've got a simplex over here, v one, v I one up to vikanite span, a simplex, then that's going to be a simplex if and only if the same thing for any choice of primes or double primes.
00:15:54.730 - 00:15:55.066, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:55.098 - 00:16:21.008, Speaker A: You see what I mean? So you call this the octahedralization. We've replaced each vertex of our original l by two copies. We've replaced each edge by a square. Yeah. Maybe I should draw this more. So, we've got. We replace v by two copies v and v prime, v prime and v double prime.
00:16:21.008 - 00:16:32.830, Speaker A: We replace the edge vw by the square v prime, w w primed.
00:16:33.610 - 00:16:34.390, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:35.370 - 00:16:39.230, Speaker A: And each triangle will get replaced by an octahedron.
00:16:39.810 - 00:16:40.282, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:40.346 - 00:17:14.180, Speaker A: So we're making a new simplicial complex with twice as many vertices. That's essentially another way of looking at this. Embed the graph product of ZsD in the same graph product of d infinities. But this same graph product of d infinities, we can express it as a graph product of cyclic twos over this more complicated simplicial complex. Right. What's wrong with this? Come on. Oh, no, it's true.
00:17:14.180 - 00:17:20.930, Speaker A: It does embed. What's unsatisfactory about it? The problem is that it's not finite index.
00:17:21.870 - 00:17:22.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:22.702 - 00:17:40.690, Speaker A: I mean, it's. Well, in this example, it was finite index. It was index two. And if we do z squared in d, infinity squared, it's index four. Yeah, looks good. But it's not finite index in general. So let's think about what we're doing with the free group on two generators.
00:17:40.690 - 00:17:59.716, Speaker A: So the right angled arch for these two dots, we're going to embed it in the right angle coxster group for these four dots. I'm not sure which dot. Which two dots correspond to which one of these dots, but. Yeah, we've got.
00:17:59.908 - 00:18:00.724, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:00.892 - 00:18:13.450, Speaker A: So this is the free group on two generators. And this is the free product of four copies of cyclic two.
00:18:14.470 - 00:18:15.290, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:15.870 - 00:18:47.160, Speaker A: Now, if you think about. I mean, you don't. Well, you don't need to believe this argument, but what's the Euler characteristic of this group? It's. Well, yeah, it's one minus two. It's minus one is the Euler characteristic of this group. What's the Euler characteristic of this group? I'm afraid I'm going to have to do it as a star like that, with a c two at each end. Yeah.
00:18:47.160 - 00:19:03.540, Speaker A: So the Euler characteristically, through this group is one, two plus one, two plus one. Two plus one. Two plus one minus 1234. Right. So that. Correction. Everybody believe that calculation?
00:19:03.870 - 00:19:04.318, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:04.374 - 00:19:13.770, Speaker A: The Euler characteristic of this group is also minus one. Right. So there's no way that this can be a finite index subgroup of this group unless it's index one.
00:19:14.430 - 00:19:15.182, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:15.326 - 00:19:48.030, Speaker A: So either it's infinite index, which is what actually happens, or the groups are isomorphic, which, of course, doesn't happen. Right. So this is the wrong cockstag. So what? I mean, Davis, Yanukiewicz, found a finite index embedding. Right. So what did they do? Well, they went back to this polyhedral product again. I might not get time to say anything else, but if I've explained the Davis Yuniskiewicz embedding, I've done something good today, if I get it right.
00:19:48.030 - 00:20:30.956, Speaker A: Right. So that's our first. That's how, you know, that's the one that corresponds to the right angled arching group and. Oh, no, sorry. Yeah, I want. Somehow this with a reflection in the middle is what corresponds to the. Now what should I do? I want to put dots on the end to indicate that they're.
00:20:30.956 - 00:20:44.560, Speaker A: But somehow I've also got the reflection. Let's do the reflection. We should use red, couldn't we? No, no, let's do a dotted line for the reflection. That's the one for the right angled Coxeter group.
00:20:45.180 - 00:20:45.764, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:45.852 - 00:20:55.800, Speaker A: So what we're going to do is modify this slightly. We're going to have a reflection that way.
00:20:58.300 - 00:20:59.080, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:02.180 - 00:21:16.600, Speaker A: Right. So then when I've got that reflection, I can draw it like that. And I've got. I've got two ways to unfold this.
00:21:17.340 - 00:21:18.120, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:18.460 - 00:21:43.830, Speaker A: If I unfold it. Yeah. I think if I unfold it here, I'm going to get the. I'm going to get the circle back. But I can unfold it at one of the two ends. And I think I've messed up the picture because I want to put that end in the middle, I think. Yeah, I want to put that end in the middle.
00:21:43.830 - 00:22:20.986, Speaker A: So I want to unfold about this one but not about that one. Is that right? Votes? No, no, sorry. I want to unfold about this one but not about that one. And so I can either get to that picture by. And that's. Somehow I'm taking an index two subgroup where neither this reflection nor this reflection is in my subgroup. Or I can unfold this way and I can get a picture like this.
00:22:20.986 - 00:23:14.910, Speaker A: Now, unfortunately, I just chose to put my dots in the wrong place. I should have put my dots in the middle because that's where I want them now. But anyway. Okay, so what does this correspond to in. In polyhedral product land? So we've got cyclic two to the m acting on s, one point to the thing. And then I've got two homomorphisms from that onto c two to the m. And one of them is going to have kernel, the right angled.
00:23:14.910 - 00:23:51.460, Speaker A: The right angled arting group. The other one is going to have kernel a different cockstar group. Right. Now this cockster group, it's going to have two new generators for each old generator. So, as before, we're going to send v to two new generators, v prime and v double primed. And the relations, the commuting relations between the v primes are going to be just as they were. But the product of these points is going to be fixed by pretty much everything.
00:23:51.460 - 00:23:59.790, Speaker A: The only thing that won't fix this point is this reflection.
00:23:59.950 - 00:24:00.670, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:00.830 - 00:24:47.850, Speaker A: So what does that tell us? It tells us that the v double primes all commute. So v double primed, v double prime, w primed equals one for all v and w. And it also tells us that v double primed is going to commute with w primed, except if w equals v. Okay. And then the commutation relations between the v prime and the w primes are if and only if the same thing holds for the v and the w.
00:24:50.950 - 00:24:51.398, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:51.454 - 00:25:18.950, Speaker A: So this is a different Coxeter group. Let's see what we're getting for. Let's just sanity check whether we've got the right thing here. I think here we've got our. We've got our two original ones. We've got the two new ones that commute with each other, and each of the new ones commutes with one of the old ones, but different ones.
00:25:19.510 - 00:25:20.190, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:20.310 - 00:25:45.874, Speaker A: So I'm getting sort of cyclic two, cross cyclic two, free product over cyclic two, with an. On a cyclic two, cross cyclic two, free product over cyclic two, with an. On a cyclic two, cross cyclic two. Okay, so this cockstag. Now, the Euler characteristic is minus a quarter, minus a quarter. Minus a quarter. No, sorry, a quarter, quarter, quarter, minus one.
00:25:45.874 - 00:26:15.640, Speaker A: Two minus a half. That's one minus a quarter, isn't it? Which is a quarter of minus one. Right. So this group could contain this group and this group as index four subgroups. And it does. Right, so that's the Davis Yuniskiewicz embedding this picture with the circle and the. This picture isn't in their paper, but I'm sure this.
00:26:15.640 - 00:26:47.796, Speaker A: Anyway, anyway, okay, so I said I was going to talk about. Oh, the index is two to the m, the number of. Yeah. And they have the same index, so they're sort of commensurate groups. Commensurate of the same index, which sort of extra property. Yeah. So, yeah, sorry.
00:26:47.796 - 00:27:42.830, Speaker A: It's the right angle arching group. And the naive attempt at finding a good right angled Coxa group for it to embed in are both index two to the m, where m is the number of vertices in the correct right angled cots group to embed in yeah, I said I was going to try and talk about. Oh, this was the last board I wrote on, wasn't it? That's terrible style erasing that one. Next. Nevermind, I've done it now. I said I was going to try and talk about the two families of counterexamples to the Eileenburg genea conjecture. So the Eilenberg genea theorem, 1957.
00:27:42.830 - 00:29:13.240, Speaker A: If the chronological dimension of G is greater than or equal to three, then there exists a kg one of same dimension. And it tells you a little bit about the low dimensional cases as well. Stollings and Swan in the 1960s, late 1960s. CDG equals one implies G is free. So CD one is the same as having a one dimensional kg one. Okay, so putting this together plus a little bit that I didn't say, the only possible case where chromological dimension and the minimal dimension of a kg one might differ is when the minimal dimension is three and the chronological dimension is two. Now I haven't said anything about how you prove this, but in fact what you do is you look at the universal cover of a skeleton for any model for e g.
00:29:13.240 - 00:29:49.118, Speaker A: And then because you've taken a skeleton for e g, it's only got one non zero homology group, the top one. If you're close to the chromological dimension that top homology module is a projective module, you can change it to be a free module by some trick. And because you're in the range where chromological dimension minus one is at least two, you've then got the Horovitch theorem to say any homology class you want to kill you can do with by attaching a cell.
00:29:49.284 - 00:29:49.626, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:49.658 - 00:30:44.972, Speaker A: So the horovic theorem is what fails when you try and do this for two. And what you can say for two dimensional group, you know, CDG equals two or less than or equal, let's say. Yeah. To make it true, what I'm about to write is less than or equal to two if and only if g acts freely cellularly on some acyclic, acyclic two complex. Right? So you can't promise yourself that you've got the two skeleton of a kg one of the. Right. But I mean the thing is if you prepare to possibly add too many cells and then you're going to add some h two and you're going to have to add three cells, you can get the front.
00:30:44.972 - 00:30:58.892, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Sorry, it's a lot. No, it's definitely false. I mean, for example. Yeah, no, this is chronology with arbitrary coefficients. Yeah.
00:30:58.892 - 00:31:13.142, Speaker A: No, yeah, thanks Alex, for mentioning that. No, I mean, there are things like the Higman's group, four generators, four relators. It's ordinary homology is the same as homology of point. There are lots of acyclic groups.
00:31:13.246 - 00:31:13.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:13.622 - 00:31:29.646, Speaker A: Now this is homology with arbitrary coefficients. So even like the Klein bottle group is a two dimensional group because, you know, the top homology of the Klein bottle is zero. But if you use twisted coefficients, it's not.
00:31:29.798 - 00:31:30.262, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:30.326 - 00:32:08.960, Speaker A: So it's. No, you definitely need arbitrary coefficients to your cohomology. Now, trivial Khuog. Yeah, it's an interesting invariant, but again, it's nice for art in groups and things, but anyway. But, yeah, okay, so, okay, so now again, I might not be able, I might. Well, let's see how we get on. So suppose l is a cyclic but not contractable, too complex.
00:32:08.960 - 00:32:22.460, Speaker A: Oh, and of course it's a flag simplicial complex, as usual.
00:32:22.620 - 00:32:23.180, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:23.300 - 00:32:37.970, Speaker A: Do we want an example of such a thing? Yeah, we've got coccidus drawing of the sculpture outside the 120 cell.
00:32:38.550 - 00:32:39.070, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:39.150 - 00:33:32.340, Speaker A: So there's a subgroup of, there's a subgroup of s three of order 120. So it's the, you know, it's, it's a group of order. It's, it's got a five as a quotient and the kernel is cyclic two. The Coel of two subgroup is quaternion. I mean, you might prefer to think of it as the special linear group over, of two by two, sl two over the field of five elements. Anyway, there is a group of order 120 which is perfect and which is a subgroup of s three. If you look at the cosets of that space, you know, you just take the s three mod, the cosets, that is the Planckleri homology three sphere.
00:33:32.340 - 00:34:05.880, Speaker A: Okay, so then if we take a, I mean, yeah, let's go back to the sphere. We've got 120 points of subgroup elements. Take the Voronoi cells of them. They turn out to be dodecahedra. And so if you take, take out the interiors of the Voronoi cells and then quotient by the group, you're obviously getting something acyclic because you've taken something out of a homology three sphere. I don't know. I promise you it's right.
00:34:05.880 - 00:34:47.605, Speaker A: I mean, the other way you can make it is you can. And again, I think this is just coming from the same thing. If you think about, you can think of it as we've had done some identifications on the boundary of a dodecahedron. And so if you take the complete graph on five vertices. Now there are 24 five cycles, but the inverse of a five cycle. And a five cycle give the same way to attach a pentagon. So there are twelve ways to attach a pentagon.
00:34:47.605 - 00:35:15.820, Speaker A: To this they fall into. Oh, and a single conjugacy class under symmetric five, there are two conjugacy classes under a five. So if you take one of the two a five conjugacy classes and attach those six pentagons, that's a way to get this same space. The two, the primary homology sphere. Okay, so it's an acyclic two complex and it's not contractible. It's fundamental group is over 120. Right.
00:35:15.820 - 00:36:07.410, Speaker A: So then let's look again at this, this polyhedral product. Oh, and of course, what's the fundamental group of this? It's the commutator subgroup of the right angled Coxeter group. I mean, I guess we know it's the kernel of a map from the right angled coax to group to c two to the m. But of course there were only m generators and they each had order two. So that obviously has to be the complete abelianization. So the fundamental groove of this thing is the commutator subgroup. What does this thing look like locally? Well, again, if we do a simpler example, we do this sort of three where one vertex is not connected to anything and the other two are.
00:36:07.410 - 00:36:35.000, Speaker A: This looks like a sort of tea trolley. Yeah. So we've got the, where the, you know, the bit that we put the tea on and the bit we put the dirty cups on there. They're filled in, but the rest isn't a. Yeah. So we fill in the squares corresponding to this edge.
00:36:35.460 - 00:36:36.148, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:36.284 - 00:36:47.800, Speaker A: Okay, so the link of each vertex here is exactly a copy of this. So the neighborhood of this vertex is a cone on this.
00:36:48.460 - 00:36:49.004, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:49.092 - 00:37:07.500, Speaker A: And the vertices are all identical. There's two to the m of them. So the link of each vertex is a cone on this. Right. Oh, and this was one dimensional. This is two dimensional. Okay, so here we have a case where l is two dimensional.
00:37:07.500 - 00:37:39.980, Speaker A: So this thing is a three dimensional thing made out of cubes. Again, if we want, we could subdivide everything, subdivide everything into smaller ones so that we've got fixed points in the middle. Right. So then we could consider instead just the sub complex of things that are far from the vertices. Right, so in this case it falls apart.
00:37:40.480 - 00:37:40.880, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:40.920 - 00:38:01.990, Speaker A: When I do this one, I've fallen it apart by cutting out the neighborhoods of the vertices and pushing back onto the skeleton of the thing. But if this l is acyclic, it doesn't fall apart. In fact, it can't fall apart because when you attach a cone on an acyclic space, you don't change homology.
00:38:02.690 - 00:38:03.330, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:03.450 - 00:38:38.828, Speaker A: So when l is acyclic, if we just take the. The bit shaded in red, so you know the cubes of the subdivision where you cut each end cube into two to the m, that subdivision, if you just take the cubes that don't contain any vertices as the original. That's what I mean.
00:38:38.964 - 00:38:39.680, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:39.990 - 00:39:10.528, Speaker A: That space has to be acyclic and of course it's two dimensional. So the red bit is acyclic and two dimensional and it's universal cover. Of course, or not. It's universal cover. Sorry, it's pre image in the universal cover of the whole thing is also acyc. Oh, I said this one was acyclic. I was lying.
00:39:10.528 - 00:39:48.260, Speaker A: We should have taken the universal cover first. We should have taken the universal cover first. There we've got more vertices, but they all look like this. And each vertex, you know, each vertex is still a neighborhood of. It is a cone on any cyclic thing. Therefore, the red bit of the universal cover is a cyclic and two dimensional. Graham's frowning.
00:39:48.260 - 00:40:02.820, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. When l is a. L is two dimensional. L is two dimensional. So this cubey thing is three dimensional and. Yeah, so then this.
00:40:03.560 - 00:40:04.340, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:09.000 - 00:40:27.270, Speaker A: I would have done if I'd not been so slow. But I'm not going to say whitehead. No. So this group, Wl, has chronological dimension less than or equal to two, and in fact, it's obviously exactly two. It can't be lower.
00:40:27.400 - 00:40:27.874, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:27.962 - 00:41:01.830, Speaker A: So this group has colloquial dimension two, we don't know, a contractible two complex on which it acts freely. So this group is probably a counterexample. Right. There are better attempts at counterexamples or more complicated ones. So, yeah, if you want to mention Whitehead, we need the other family of counterexamples. And again, I wanted to say more about this. I haven't even mentioned Sarris fantastic theorem about the commutator subgroup.
00:41:01.830 - 00:42:14.340, Speaker A: But anyway, so take the same l. Oh, let's. No, let's move to another board, shall we? What time did I start? Slightly late five minutes. Great, okay, so take same l, and we're not going to take a. The thing is, we're not taking the group al this time, but we're going to look at that space. You know that. And again, I'm just repeating bits of taras Panas talk yesterday.
00:42:14.340 - 00:42:23.880, Speaker A: Really? But anyway, this is an abelian group. So there's a group operation from this to s one.
00:42:24.900 - 00:42:25.680, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:26.500 - 00:42:44.040, Speaker A: Where we just multiply all the coordinates together. And so that gives us a map from here to s one. So that gives us a homomorphism from the right angled arching group onto z. Or if you like, the right angle arcing group of a point.
00:42:44.900 - 00:42:45.684, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:45.852 - 00:43:10.250, Speaker A: Corresponding to the unique map from the simplest or complex l to your point. Or you just send all of the vertices to the one point. Right. If you take the universal covers, you've got the universal cover of this thing, which gets called xl mapping to the real line.
00:43:11.230 - 00:43:12.050, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:12.950 - 00:43:37.836, Speaker A: And it turns out this kernel is the group we want to look at now. Okay? And this is called the best Wiener Brady group associated to l. And again, you can look at other homomorphisms to z. And I think this might be some, the sort of thing that might come up in Alex's talk. Is it or. No? No. Okay.
00:43:37.836 - 00:44:30.752, Speaker A: It's something that lots of people have thought of, thought about, you know, cohomology and homology of these, these types of kernels. Anyway, it turns out for this same l for l with the same properties as before, although the right angle arting group here has got z cubes inside it, so it's definitely got chronological dimension three. And the cube complex is three dimensional. This thing is two dimensional again. But again, this whole space is a three dimensional contractible thing. It acts on. And again, there's some sort of argument involving the acyclicity that gives you a two dimensional acyclic space that this group acts on.
00:44:30.752 - 00:46:05.020, Speaker A: Again, maybe with BBL, again, looks like, well, acts freely on some a cyclic two complex. And again, the argument that best Fino and Brady give here you take the inverse image under this map of any point, and then that's a sub complex that the whole arting group moves things up and down. But this kernel doesn't move things up and down. By definition, it's the things that act trivially on arthem. So the kernel preserves this level set, and that's the AC that turns out that level set is acyclic by some more theoretical argument involving the fact that l was acyclic. So it's another group where we have an acyclic two complex, but is not known to act at any contractable two complex, act freely on any contractible two complex. Okay, this is the one that Bespino and Brady spent a long time trying to prove.
00:46:05.020 - 00:46:46.160, Speaker A: This was an I remember guinea counterexample. And the best they got was this theorem that if the Whitehead conjecture that every sub complex of any spherical two complex is aspherical, if that holds, then this group is a counterexample to the Ironberg Gannett conjecture. So one of the two big conjectures is false. I'm sure Eileenberg Ginnier is false. I've got no idea whether Whitehead is true or false. Oh yeah, I was going to say something about Taras's thing being used to show that somehow that example is more basic than this one. But maybe I'll.
00:46:46.160 - 00:46:48.340, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. I better stop now.
