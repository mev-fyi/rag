00:00:00.440 - 00:00:52.184, Speaker A: I haven't given the last run of lectures because of the nice guest lectures from Bob and Lewis. And so in my head, we're nearing the end of the course at least. So what I wanted to start with was just a little overview of what's to come, and get some input from you guys, if that's okay. So today I've prepared a lecture on frameworks in two dimensions that are have some very specific failure of genericness, but they're otherwise generic. And we'll talk about how that affects the sort of pollicheck Geringer le man kind of combinatorial characterization. But before that, as I say, I want to go through this. So on Monday we'll have a guest lecture from Brigitte Servatius on the rigidity of random regular graphs.
00:00:52.184 - 00:01:39.600, Speaker A: I hope there will be one more guest lecture, at least from Dior Grassiger. It's not quite fixed yet, and in the outline for the course I've put some specific topics for the remaining lectures. But I would like your input. So if you want to have a little think about what things I haven't covered or that hasn't been covered in the course that you think might be valuable, or say the postdocs here, if there's anything you would be willing to lecture on again, or for the first time as a another guest lecture, then that would be great. So after Brigitte's guest lecture on Monday, there will be a lecture on Wednesday. But then there's the long Easter weekend. So I have missed out Easter Friday and Easter Monday.
00:01:39.600 - 00:02:11.454, Speaker A: Hopefully I've got the dates right. And then there'll be a lecture on the 7th, Wednesday the 7th, and then on the Friday the 9th. And then that's the end of what I've scheduled. As I say, if lots of you have ideas and lots of enthusiasm, then we could add a few more lectures if necessary. But from my personal perspective, I'm a little bit tired. And so unless there's lots of willing guest lecturers, that might not go very far. So if we stop on Friday the 9th, we'll have done 26 lectures.
00:02:11.454 - 00:02:56.830, Speaker A: Plus the effectively, we tried to think of Bill Jackson's free lectures in the winter school as part of the the course, because that's a topic I deliberately didn't cover because he went into all the details there. And we had the rigidity workshop and the materials mini symposium. So I'm hoping any of you taking the course for credit can combine these things to get enough hours for what you need. But if that's not true for anyone who is taking the course for credit, let me know, and that would be a motivation to add however many extra hours are needed. Okay, so that's my sort of ramble about what's to come. So I'm going to open the floor in case anyone has any comments, wants to write anything in the chat. Are there any.
00:02:56.830 - 00:03:45.874, Speaker A: So some of the postdocs are here. So are there any experts in rigidity? Are there any topics that I have omitted to cover that you think really should be covered in the course? Tony, were you going to do a lecture on azure decompositions? SEO. Decompositions? So, yeah, it's in my. Oops. Decompositions in my planned outline. There would be some time spent on this. Is that something you think should be heard? It's something I don't know much about, so I'd be interested to hear about.
00:03:45.874 - 00:04:23.014, Speaker A: Okay, so, yeah, there is a plan to spend some time on this. What about, say, symmetry? Do people feel that we really should have some lectures on symmetric or periodic frameworks? I feel that it may be very interesting.
00:04:24.994 - 00:04:29.454, Speaker B: I'd also like to hear about that, if it's not too difficult.
00:04:31.934 - 00:04:40.314, Speaker C: I mean, I could speak about symmetry if people are interested. I don't know if you wanted a guest lecturer for that.
00:04:40.854 - 00:04:57.754, Speaker A: Lovely, lovely. Thanks, Daniel. Yeah, so it's quite a big topic, but. So it might be that we have two lectures on symmetry, but Daniel, if you could give one of them, certainly, that would be brilliant. Thanks.
00:04:58.134 - 00:05:06.902, Speaker C: And I'll do. I guess, I don't know if people want to do incidentals. I can do like symmetry forced, if anyone else. I don't know if symmetry.
00:05:06.998 - 00:05:07.486, Speaker A: What is it?
00:05:07.510 - 00:05:13.394, Speaker C: Incidental symmetry is also something that people want to see. Maybe someone else should do that. But I can do symmetry forced.
00:05:15.214 - 00:05:25.264, Speaker A: Would it be worth having a lecture on Rom spectrum? It's kind of like symmetry, like incident symmetry for periodic stuff.
00:05:27.284 - 00:05:29.692, Speaker C: Someone else wants to do that. That would be interesting.
00:05:29.828 - 00:05:42.344, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a topic actually I know nothing about. So I would quite like to listen to a lecture on that, but. Sean Olaf terrace. I guess that would be one of you two. So you might have volunteered yourself, Sean. I was hoping to volunteer lefty, but.
00:05:42.644 - 00:05:43.580, Speaker B: Yeah, I can do it.
00:05:43.612 - 00:06:20.598, Speaker A: I can do it. Nice. Cheers. Room spectrum lepteris. Okay, well, that's great, because that means I would. If I prepared one lecture myself, then we would fill these three and then I can see what else I have that I really wanted to cover and maybe do one or two more after that, if there's still the willing audience to listen and I've still got the energy. So I'll get started with the non generic stuff.
00:06:20.598 - 00:08:00.684, Speaker A: Unless anyone wants to make any further suggestions, you're very welcome to volunteer, or volunteer somebody else, or say, another topic still, is this symmetry? Discussions will situations where symmetry is broken or absent. So just very briefly. So the idea in symmetric rigidity is that instead of having generic structures where there's no symmetry whatsoever, you assume your graph has some non trivial automorphism group. And so for example, maybe it could be a four cycle, but it's clearly got a c four rotation symmetry, but it's also realized geometrically so that the points are nicely rotation about some center. And then you ask the standard questions we've been asking about is it rigid or is it flexible? And the various different combinatorial and matrix questions we've been asking. But given you have the symmetry, rather than being generic, but this is sort of a spoiler for those lectures. Okay, so maybe we'll get on with the topic for today.
00:08:00.684 - 00:09:05.904, Speaker A: So, yeah, so let's start at the beginning. So we've spent a lot of time talking about generic frameworks, and if you remember right back to the start, we talked about how if you don't make any assumption at all on the realization P in your framework GP, then it's a computationally difficult problem. Even just I give you a framework, determine if it's rigid. Of course we know for infinitesimal rigidity we can always use the, the rank of rigidity matrix, but in the non generic case, we don't know that's exactly equivalent to rigidity. So I want to weaken generic, but this is sort of a warning that I can't weaken it a lot. And in fact, what I'm going to basically show you in this lecture is, well, I hope two cases, but if I don't have time, just one case where weakening it a very, very small amount leads to difficult, interesting questions that have particular uses. So, as I say here, there's a wide space between generic and typical and sort of arbitrary realizations.
00:09:05.904 - 00:09:54.284, Speaker A: But I'm only going to go very, very slightly away from the generic situation, and we're going to do the usual thing we do. I'm only going to talk about rigidity, but both these problems that are both the situations I would like to cover, the global rigidity questions are sort of unstudied. Basically they look hard, and actually in one case I have notes on it, but I'd never managed to get sufficiently far. So if anyone's interested in doing global GDT in these contexts, then feel free to let me know after. So the first situation is about coincident points. So in fact. Well, I've told you this now, but so you can see that an obvious wage and genericity can fail is if you just have two vertices, u and v, that lie in exactly the same place.
00:09:54.284 - 00:10:30.724, Speaker A: So clearly they can't be generic because they've been realized in the, in the same place. But before we go into that, this made me curious when I was preparing this, so again, I'm going to open up the floor. What's a failure of genericness that. What's a simple failure of genericness that people might want to study? So as I say, coincidence points is one and I'm going to do a second one towards the end of the lecture if I have time. But I'm curious if anyone knows of any, or has any ideas of what might be a nice failure that you people might want to study.
00:10:37.824 - 00:10:42.924, Speaker B: Points in the span of some others, like one that lies on a line between two others.
00:10:45.904 - 00:10:52.640, Speaker A: So you're saying a point lying on the line between two of the points and having collinear points.
00:10:52.832 - 00:10:55.424, Speaker B: Yeah, I didn't, I didn't really.
00:10:55.464 - 00:12:00.954, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's, that's exactly, that's exactly the second situation that we'll get to at the end if I have time. But yes, that's definitely a good option. So while you're thinking another option is unit distance. This is a hard case. So we have generic coordinates for the vertices and so if you're minimally rigid this implies that you will have generic lengths for the edges. And so this is really the opposite of that where you have all the lengths of the edges are length the same length and so it might as well be one because it can dilate and so there is interest, for example from zeolites in the unit distance rigidity. But this seems to be a hard problem if anyone has any further kinds of non genericness we talked about symmetry already, then please say otherwise I'll start talking about coincident points.
00:12:03.574 - 00:12:10.924, Speaker D: What would it be if you required the vertices to have integer coordinates or lie on lattice points?
00:12:13.784 - 00:12:41.688, Speaker A: So yeah, this would be interesting too. So you would basically have a big grid, right? And so say it was the integer grid and your points have to lie like this. So there is results of. No. Is it just bokeh about grid bracing how to do this kind of question?
00:12:41.856 - 00:12:46.848, Speaker D: No, but not like the edges are also grid lines but rather.
00:12:46.936 - 00:12:51.684, Speaker A: Yes, in this situation the vertices like that, but you can have diagonals.
00:12:57.504 - 00:13:04.672, Speaker D: I just meant. So are you thinking that the red lines in your drawing are edges in the graph.
00:13:04.848 - 00:13:08.240, Speaker A: Yes. So that is not as general as maybe you were saying.
00:13:08.312 - 00:13:09.040, Speaker B: You're right.
00:13:09.192 - 00:13:22.684, Speaker D: Yeah. And you can skip, you could have, you know, grid points or lattice points that don't have a vertex at all, etcetera.
00:13:23.944 - 00:13:24.724, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:26.384 - 00:13:47.974, Speaker B: Is the unit distance one you mentioned earlier, right. Related to sphere packing at all, or there's this thing coming up with the sphere packing workshop. I thought maybe that's related to that somehow. I'm not sure, I'm just purely guessing.
00:13:49.114 - 00:14:06.092, Speaker A: Is it true? Yeah. If you have two spheres that distance of two. Yes. The sum of the two radii. And so if you, if you did have, if all your spheres were the same size, then. Yeah. Then it would be a unit distance problem.
00:14:06.092 - 00:14:19.664, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So I think unit distance for rigidity is hard even in two D. And so the circle packing rather than sphere packing, but I mean, sphere packing would just be too hard, I guess.
00:14:21.284 - 00:14:24.384, Speaker B: I don't know, I just guessed it might be related.
00:14:24.694 - 00:14:58.734, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. So you pack your spheres and then you make a graph by taking the centers and put edges when the two spheres are in contact. And then you can talk about the rigidity of the graph of the packing and relate that to the properties of the circle or sphere packing. I think that might be a step too far for asking someone to give a. A bit too disjoint from the course, but it is an interesting area.
00:14:59.394 - 00:15:02.334, Speaker B: Are we talking about suggestions for things to talk about?
00:15:02.994 - 00:15:13.226, Speaker A: No, no, no. I was just thinking out loud in my head back to the previous bit. So, I mean, you're right, this is just talking about non generic kinds of situations still.
00:15:13.370 - 00:15:14.094, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:15.714 - 00:15:58.194, Speaker A: So maybe I should get going with the coincident points, because I do have quite a bit, I want to say in this. So we're going to have. Well, let's just jump to here. So start with a graph and a particular pair of vertices u and v. And I'm going to have a framework in r two, which is called uv coincident, for this special pair of vertices u and v, if the locations of pu and pv are the same. But I want to study generic things subject to this condition. So I say that the framework is uv generic if, when I delete one of the pair of coincident points, everything is generic.
00:15:58.194 - 00:16:31.198, Speaker A: So in fact it's algebraically independent. So it's the usual generic we've had in the, in the course. So the two dimensions, by the way, is only because that's where I can make combinatorial things work. You can make the same ask the same questions in arbitrary dimensions. And you'll see we have a, an application of understanding coincident rigidity later, that it is valid in d dimensions. So I have a generic framework, and I add one extra vertex at exactly the same location as an existing one. And my special pair of coincident points will always be u and v.
00:16:31.198 - 00:17:28.253, Speaker A: So I'll use phrases like uv coincidence and uv generic to try and understand this. Okay, so since everything else is generic, there's certainly no other pointless coincidence. So we definitely do not have coincident triples, or we don't have multiple pairs of coincidence points. If you're interested in such extensions, then Hakangula's PhD thesis recently did look into this. But it just gets even harder than two coincidence points, is already quite hard. So it's challenging, challenging to go much further, even though hakam was able to do some nice results in this direction. Okay, so what do I want to say? So remember the, the idea of the, the rigidity matrix, the row matrix, the rigidity matrix, because it is just looking at the same, otherwise generic and the same matrix.
00:17:28.253 - 00:18:07.004, Speaker A: If I give you two different uv generic frameworks, then we have the, the same rigidity matriid. And so we'll think of this as the uv rigidity matriarch. The fact that coincident might affects what the possible ranks are for certain graphs, but otherwise it's the, the same object, and we're going to use r sub uv to denote it. And we're going to have the sort of usual thing, we have a rank function of this matriid, which is little R U V. And I'm only going to talk about infinitesimal rigidity. So the rank of the matrix. And so I'm going to define uv rigidity.
00:18:07.004 - 00:19:06.264, Speaker A: So my uv coincident framework is rigid in that special realization, if the rigidity matrix has the right rank, so if the rank of the matroid is two, v minus three. So we know that we're looking at, say, Leman graphs, two free tight graphs, because they're the ones that get hit this rank for generic. And we want to know, actually when one of these two free tight graphs actually drops rank because of the uv coincidence, and when it doesn't, okay? And so it's also going to be useful for us to define independence in this matrix. A uv independent just means that the set of edges is independent in the matrix. And I'll typically blur the lines between saying that a subset of edges is independent and just saying the graph induced by that subset is independent. So this is a standard notational blurring I've been doing in the course. And we talk about minimal uv rigidity.
00:19:06.264 - 00:20:08.258, Speaker A: So this is all kind of analogous to the standard things, some going quite fast, minimally uv rigid. If you're uv rigid, and the rows of the rigidity matrix are independent, so then you have uv independence as well. Okay, so I wanted to give one example to try and show you that this is a non trivial extension of the polijack Geringer theorem. So the example is this one. So this graph is just the complete bipartite graph, k two free, which is very definitely two free sparse. It's not two free tight. So it's, it's very easily seen to be independent in the two dimensional rigidity matriid, but with the coincidence of U and v, if you realize it is a uv coincident framework, then you end up with lots of collinearities.
00:20:08.258 - 00:21:05.094, Speaker A: And so it's not so hard. In fact, I think the best thing to do is just actually write down the rigidity matrix and see that it is dependent. This is a, a flexible circuit, if you like that notation. So k two two, with u and v as the part of size two, is uv independent. But a third one, a third degree two hanging off of the two coincident points is dependent. So this is saying that somehow the combinatorics has to be more subtle than just the, the two free tight condition, because there are two free sparse things that aren't even tight, which are dependent in this uv rigidity matriarch. Okay, so I'm not really going to tell you about how the combinatorics gets around it too much.
00:21:05.094 - 00:21:58.272, Speaker A: I'm going to sort of skip that, that complication. The answer is to think about actually the guest lecture Daniel gave very early on in the course about the Lovas Yemeni paper. So, Lovas Yemeni extended the polycheck Geringer theorem to, to characterize the rank function of the two dimensional rigidity matriid. And in it, they used one fin covers. And so the, the uv coincident rigidity matriid can be characterized in terms of such covers. If an additional complication, you have to worry about sets in the COVID that contain, whether the sets in the COVID contain u and v or not have contained both of them. And so the sort of technical term in the paper that I'm going to reference in a moment is uv compatible families.
00:21:58.272 - 00:23:00.482, Speaker A: But I'll let you look at the paper if you're really curious. It's, as I say, it's a more complicated combinatorial object than just a counting condition. Okay. On the other hand, sorry. On the other hand, while the matriarch that characterizes independence is more complicated combinatorial object, it still has a, we still have a very nice characterization in terms of a recursive construction of minimally uv rigid things, which is basically analogous to the characterization of minimally rigid bar joint things in 2d. So you see, we're going to use exactly the same operations. So first of all, we have to put this uv in in both cases, but otherwise we have zero extensions and one extensions to be slightly careful, because you can already see from this example that you can think of adding this vertex as doing a one extension, sorry, a zero extension on k 22, and that took us from independent to dependent.
00:23:00.482 - 00:23:58.084, Speaker A: So the zero extensions, even the easy zero extensions, you have to be more careful. So what does our zero extension look like? Well, if we do a zero extension adding z, so that's addition of a vertex of degree two adjacent to x and y, then what we have to be careful with is we have to set that the pair of neighbors of the new vertex is not the set of the two vertices that are coincident u and v, so it can include one of them but not both. And we make a similar assumption for our one extensions. So here we delete xy and we add a new vertex z, and z is adjacent to x and y and to one of a vertex w. And we have to be careful that the pair uv is not a subset of x, y and w. So let me draw. So we delete xy, add z and have w here.
00:23:58.084 - 00:24:44.312, Speaker A: So if uv was a subset of x, y z, then say oops, say this was u and this was v, then in effect we've done a zero extension in there that we were trying to avoid. And then we've also done obviously a little bit extra as well. And so maybe if you accept zero extensions, need to avoid this, then maybe it's sort of obvious that one extensions do as well. We certainly don't want to have an edge between u and v because they're coincidence, and we're talking about infinitesimal rigidity. So if u and v in the same place, then we'll have a zero row in the rigidity matrix. So that clearly is not going to be any good if we want to be a minimally rigid framework. So we never want to have an edge between u and v.
00:24:44.312 - 00:25:28.464, Speaker A: So it can't be that u is x and v is y, but we also don't want it to be a subset U of E. We don't want to be a subset of x, y, w in our one extension. So these conditions on zero and one extensions make proving that these operations get everything in the minimally uv rigid family harder. But it's doable. What's not so hard is to see that these extensions, as I've defined, preserve minimal uv rigidity. So this, because of the extra conditions. It is exactly what we did way back when we were proving the Polarcheck Geringer theorem.
00:25:28.464 - 00:26:18.174, Speaker A: So for zero extension, it was just adding. So you just had your rigidity matrix, and you add two rows and two columns, and you just worry about the fact that this little matrix in the bottom was independent because we have lots of zeros here. So it was an easy thing. And then we used the collinear triangle trick for the one uv extension. And so again, that works in the uv world because of the condition that uv is not a subset of xYw. Okay, so with all that, we can prove the theorem. So, everything I'm saying about uv coincident so far comes from this nice paper of Zolt Fecatur, Thibault Jordan and Victoria Kazanitsky.
00:26:18.174 - 00:26:58.906, Speaker A: And the theorem. Well, the first of two theorems from their paper I want to mention is. So, I take a graph that has two v minus three edges, which have our special pair versus u and v, which are going to be realized coincidentally. Then we can talk about uv independence if and only if you can be a recursive construction. So the graph is uv independent, if and only if it can be generated from k four minus uv. So k four minus uv is this graph with u and v here. We can't go smaller, because if we go smaller, we will become complete.
00:26:58.906 - 00:27:56.184, Speaker A: And we don't want u and v to be adjacent because they're coincident and we want to be independent. So, this is the smallest graph by a sequence of our zero, uv and one uv extension operations. And so, the combinatorial direction of this proof I've really told you nothing about. But in their paper that they work hard to characterize the, the rank function, the combinatorial, as a combinatorial matriarch. That's equivalent to the rigidity matriarch for uv coincident. And then this theorem falls out as a, basically, as a corollary, they also go a little bit further, improve what I think is a really nice extension which characterizes uv rigidity in terms of deletions and contractions. So again, I've got a graph with a special pair of vertices u and v.
00:27:56.184 - 00:28:49.258, Speaker A: The graph is uv rigid if and only if the graph you get from deleting the edge uv and the graph you get from contracting the edge uv are rigid. And notice that I was talking about uv rigidity here. So g had to be realized u and v coincident. But on the other side of the if and only if, I'm talking about just a graph and its rigidity, I'm not talking about uv rigid. So for the g to be uv rigid, it has to be true that generically, after I delete any edge between u and v, if it exists, I'm rigid. And after I contract the pair u and v into a single vertex, that has to be generically rigid as well. Okay, so one direction should be relatively easy.
00:28:49.258 - 00:29:43.334, Speaker A: So the direction that you go back follows as a corollary to the. To this, this theorem, basically, that I won't go into the, the details too much of, but the other direction should be relatively clear. So if we're rigid with u and v in the same place, then if there's an edge between u and v, it should have no effect on the rigidity. And when you move from the non generic to a more generic position, you should still be rigid. So it should certainly true that g minus uv should be rigid and g contract uv is also not so hard to, to see. It basically follows from this inequality. So if I look at the rigidity matrix of a generic framework Gp, and I look at the rigidity matrix of the.
00:29:43.334 - 00:30:35.212, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. No, let me start again. I look at the rigidity matrix of Gp, where p gp is uv, coincidentally, and I look at the rigidity matrix of the contracted framework g contractuv, where I obtain the generic realization p hat p bar by putting pu and pv in the same place and calling. And that place is the location of the new vertex, which I've called z when I contracted u and v, and I've put everything else generically, exactly as it was in Gp. So the only change between p and p v bar, essentially is the, the new vertex where the contraction of u and v is putting the location of the. Where the two coincident things were. So then, with that, you can really see that the matrix isn't changing all that much.
00:30:35.212 - 00:31:44.434, Speaker A: And so checking this inequality is, is not so hard to do. Okay, so one natural question might be why, why bother with coincident points? So I want to show you that coincident points have some interest in a completely disjoint rigidity problem to what we just discussed. And in fact, it's the general case of the problem I'm going to mention is still still open. So we're going to talk about the vertex splitting operation. So for anyone who doesn't remember what this means is you have some vertex and you split it into two vertices. So this vertex got split into these two, they become adjacent, and the neighbors of the first vertex, say v go into v dash, v double dash or something. So the neighbors of v are partitioned into n one, n two, and a special d minus one neighbors.
00:31:44.434 - 00:32:35.174, Speaker A: So d is the dimension. So in two dimensions, there's only one thing over here, etcetera. And what do the special neighbors mean? Well, these d minus one neighbors become adjacent to both of the new vertices. So v is split into v dash and v double dash, and these d minus one neighbors go to both of them, and then the remainder remaining neighbors were split into n one and n two. And n one goes to v dash and n two goes to v double dash. So n one and n two is just a way of partitioning the remaining neighbors of v one side or the other. Okay, so this is, this hopefully is revision from what we've seen this before, and we saw that Whiteley had proved that infinitesimal rigidity is preserved by vertex splitting.
00:32:35.174 - 00:33:08.682, Speaker A: But notice, first of all, I want to now talk about global rigidity, but it's trivially false without one additional assumption. So let's suppose we were working in two dimensions, then here's the vertex split. So d minus one was one. So there was one special neighbor up here. Here was v to v dash and v double dash. But I could choose for all of the remaining neighbors of v to put them all into n one and make n two the empty set. Then v has degree two.
00:33:08.682 - 00:34:11.434, Speaker A: And we know in two dimensions that if you have a degree two vertex, you can just flip over across the, the line through the two neighbors and find an equivalent but non congruent realization. So we have to make an assumption in our vertex splitting operation that both n one and n two are non empty. So where in this case, the three neighbors of v that are drew here have to go something like two one. Okay, so we, we assume our vertex splitting are non trivial in that sense. So n one and n two are both non empty. And so in this context, it was a conjecture, I believe, of Whiteley, that this operation preserves global rigidity. And there is a special case known that was proved by Connolly and a special case that I'm going to explain to you, that which was proved by Cruikshank and Jackson that uses coincident points.
00:34:11.434 - 00:34:56.040, Speaker A: So, yeah, and so this is again when the two sides are not empty, then the vertex is non trivial. And we want to show that non trivial vertex footing preserves global rigidity. This is in general is still a conjecture. Oh, and there's also a special case due to Jordan and Tanegauer that is probably the most general. So I definitely shouldn't have omitted to say that one. Okay, so what I want to do is use coincident realizations. So in particular, we're going to do our vertex split from g to to g, but for g, we're going to have a coincident realization.
00:34:56.040 - 00:35:29.104, Speaker A: So just like the idea in Whiteley's argument, we realize the new, two new vertices, v dash and v double dash, in the same place. So we put the locations of v and v double dash together. And so we're going to need some result. So basically what we're going to do is say if g is globally rigid, then g p, where p is not generic, but it's special. It has this, this special position of the coincidence. We're going to be able to show that this works. Global rigidity transfers to global rigidity.
00:35:29.104 - 00:36:19.744, Speaker A: But it's not obvious that if you're globally rigid at a special position, you're still globally rigid when you perturb to a generic position. So a simple example, and maybe I draw this a bit later on, but let me just say it now, is that this graph, you could realize it, so that these two vertices are coincident, and then, because there's an edge between them, u and v are locked together. So for, so this is actually basically a triangle, which is globally rigid. So this is a globally rigid realization of a graph that very definitely is not generically globally rigid. It's not even generically rigid. So when I want to take the special position and move to, say, a nearby generic position for this one, I would lose. The global rigidity would disappear as I perturbed nearby.
00:36:19.744 - 00:36:54.998, Speaker A: So I want to mention and prove a theorem of Connolly and Whiteley that allows us to do this. Okay? And so the assumption is infinitesimal rigidity, which this one didn't have. So that's why the example is not going to be a counter example. So suppose that GP is an infinitesimally rigid and globally rigid framework in RD. So p is not generic. So if p was generic, then global rigidity implies rigidity, which is equivalent to infinitesimal rigidity. But I'm not assuming p is generic.
00:36:54.998 - 00:37:41.324, Speaker A: So assuming infinitesimal rigidity and global rigidity are, it's not redundant to assume infinitesimal rigidity as well. Exactly. The example I just showed shows that. So I have my infinitesimally rigid and globally rigid framework. It's not necessarily generic, then. The theorem tells me there exists an open neighborhood np of p, such that for all q in this neighborhood of p, Gq is both infinitesimally rigid and globally rigid. We already know that if you're infinitesimally rigid, you can perturb to any nearby point without affecting the rank of the within a sufficiently small neighborhood without affecting the rank of the rigidity matrix.
00:37:41.324 - 00:38:25.094, Speaker A: So the infinitesimally rigid conclusion I'm going to take for granted in this, in the proof of the theorem, and we're going to prove that we can also perturb and get global rigidity as well. And the, the proof is going to be what I think Walter Whiteley calls the averaging technique. It's sort of a, maybe a sort of easy version of a pogorylov map technique. Yeah. So here's the example that I mentioned before, so I can skip over that. I mean, I could, since we don't have that long left, omit the proof of this. But I think it is quite instructive.
00:38:25.094 - 00:39:34.130, Speaker A: So I will give it, and that will mean I have to do the collinear points version, which the collinear point problem will be in another lecture, I think, as a result. But that's okay. So what we're proving that if you're infinitesimally rigid and globally rigid, then there's an open neighborhood NP of p, such that all genetic or all points in that neighborhood are also infinitesimally rigid and globally rigid. And so, in particular, you can take your special position, as long as it's both infinitesimally rigid and globally rigid, and perturbed to a nearby generic point, which is infinitesimally rigid and globally rigid. Okay, so we're globally rigid, so N is at least D plus two. And we're going to suppose that for any open neighborhood NP of P, there exists some realization p star in that neighborhood which is not globally rigid. So that would say we don't have this open neighborhood of globally rigid things, because it has to be true that for any open neighborhood, there is such a not globally rigid thing.
00:39:34.130 - 00:40:22.894, Speaker A: And we're going to basically contradict infinitesimal rigidity via developing the average of two frameworks and the infinitesimal motion being the difference. But let's go through it slowly. So there exists this p star, which is not globally rigid. This tells us that there exists some convergent sequence, because this is for any, however small, we want to pick the open neighborhood. There's a convergent sequence GPK of non globally rigid frameworks that converge to GP. Okay, for each of these gpks, we know it's not globally rigid. So there exists an equivalent but non congruent framework, GQK.
00:40:22.894 - 00:41:22.264, Speaker A: And if you remember, we often want to get rid of isometries and not worry about them. So we're going to assume that both GPk and GQk are in standard position. So we're going to put the first vertex at the origin, second vertex, we're going to have enough zeros to rule out some rotations, and we keep going for whatever dimension we're in. Just making sure we get rid of the D plus one, choose two isometries by zeroing out relevant coordinates. So we have our equivalent but non congruent realizations for the sequences GPk and GQk. By the compactness of our DVD, we have a convergent subsequence of Gqk GQm, which converges to some limit framework Gq. And since GP was the limit of the sequence of the pks, GQ will be equivalent to GP.
00:41:22.264 - 00:42:20.276, Speaker A: If it's not congruent, then we found that GQ is equivalent but non congruent to GP. But GP was globally rigid, so we would contradict global rigidity. Hence it must be that GQ is congruent to GP. But we've ruled out the continuous isometries by the standard position. So we know that GP is obtained from GQ by reflections, by some finite composition of the, some of the discrete isometries of this place. So this is composition of reflections in coordinate hyperplanes in RD. Okay, so if we now apply this composition of reflections, this discrete congruence to all of the sequence GQm, we obtain a different sequence GrM, which converges to GP.
00:42:20.276 - 00:43:17.954, Speaker A: Now, because we've done the reflections from GQ to GP for the limit, and we know that GrM is equivalent but not congruent to GPM for each m because it's the same property was true for the GQ sequence. Okay, so now we have this, this new sequence rm and we have our PM's. We're going to now look at the difference between these sequences pm and rm to get an infinitesimal motion of the averaged framework pm plus rm over two. So that's just a computation. So what we want, we're trying to check that this is an infinitesimal motion of this. So we have our p minus PJ. So that's pm of vi plus rm of Vi over two minus PJ.
00:43:17.954 - 00:43:46.912, Speaker A: So that's pmvj plus rmvj over two. And our infinitesimal motion is PM minus RM. So it's PM Vi minus RMVi minus PMVJ minus RMVJ. And we've took the dot product of these two things. And so now we just do some, some simple manipulations here. So the twos come out as a half that we combine the PMVI minus PMVJ. So it's this bit.
00:43:46.912 - 00:44:17.794, Speaker A: We take the RMVI minus RMVJ. That's that bit. And now we still do the dot product also, I think, simplify. Yeah. We take this and this, and we take that and that to get here. And then, now, hopefully, it's in a form that you can see that we get. When we do the dot product, we get this times this squared, this times this with a minus sign, so minus the square, and then the cross terms, one's a plus and one's a minus, so they cancel.
00:44:17.794 - 00:44:56.214, Speaker A: Okay? And so now if we go back, this is, we need, we should see that this is equal to zero. So this is Pm minus Rm minus Rm. But PM and RM, if we go back, are equivalent. So when we take the squares, we got the same, the same things. So this is zero. But we know that PM and RMW are equivalent. They weren't congruent.
00:44:56.214 - 00:46:05.006, Speaker A: So the difference gives us a non trivial infinitesimal motion, doesn't give us an isometry. Hence the, the rigidity matrix of g for pm plus rm. For the averaged framework, it has a non trivial infinitesimal motion, so it can't be maximal. However, both pm and rm provider, the way we set things up, converge to p. So the average of the two frameworks also converges to p, and hence these things that are less than maximal for each m, gives us a sequence of infinitesimally flexible frameworks, and GP is the limit of that sequence, and limit of a sequence of infinitesimally flexible frameworks is infinitesimally flexible. And so we contradict the infinitesimal rigidity of GDP, which we assumed in the statement of the whatever it was, lemma theorem or crawlery or whatever I called it. Okay, so I want to stop for questions, in case that's unclear, but I'm close to the end, and I do want to go through the proof of this theorem, so maybe I'll do that first.
00:46:05.006 - 00:46:50.634, Speaker A: And then, if there were any questions, we can go back. So, here's the coincident point vertex splitting result is very recent resulted. Cruikshank and Jackson, as I mentioned, before. There are other special cases of the general vertex splitting conjecture that are known particularly from Jordan and Tanigawa, who use the idea of non degenerate stressors. And Connolly has a special case as well. But I just want to give the proof of this one because it's quite a simple coincident point proof and it will just take us a few minutes. Okay, so the statement is I take a globally rigid graph in d dimensions and choose some vertex w.
00:46:50.634 - 00:47:40.352, Speaker A: I suppose that a new graph g is obtained from a non trivial vertex splitting operation which splits w into two vertices u and v. And I can't do in full generality, so I have to make an additional hypothesis, and that is that this new graph g has a uv coincidence, uv rigid realization. So this is the additional hypothesis that may not be necessary for the. In general, but it is needed for the proof technique. Then g is generically globally rigid in RD. Okay, so why is this? So I start with a generic framework, gp and rd. And so we know this is going to be a globally rigid framework.
00:47:40.352 - 00:48:37.360, Speaker A: We obtain g p by doing the vertex split at w, which splits w into u and v. Everything except for w just goes to the same place in this new realization p. And the two new vertices, u and v are realized, coincidentally at the same place where w was. Okay, we know that g has a uv coincident, uv rigid realization that tells us that every uv generic realization of g will be uv rigid. So this one where, because we've put everything else generically the same way it was in G, we've chosen a particular uv coincident, uv rigid framework, g p. Okay, so gp is globally rigid. So g p is globally rigid.
00:48:37.360 - 00:49:10.840, Speaker A: So why is that? So let's just draw the two dimensional case. We have a globally rigid thing and we split this vertex w into u and v, but we realize I'm in exactly the same place. So we have really, there's an edge between u and v, but that edge is zero length and locks u and v together. Everything else is realized as it was before. So all the other edges incident just look like they do in G. So in g they're globally rigid. And in g, with this special p, u and v are in the same place.
00:49:10.840 - 00:50:08.518, Speaker A: So all the edges into u and into v just look like they're into this one common vertex. Because the zero length edge forces the two vertices to stay exactly the same. And so all the edges into either of them look exactly the same constraint in g p as they were in Gp. So g p is globally rigid in RD again. Okay, and so now we do. The theorem that we went spent some time proving for Connelly and Whiteley that because we have g, p is globally rigid, and we have the infinitesimal rigidity property from the uv rigid realization g p, we can apply Conley and Whiteley's theorem to see that any q in a neighborhood of p, so any q sufficiently close to p, g q will be globally rigid. And hence, from there, we can get that the graph is globally rigid.
00:50:08.518 - 00:50:38.406, Speaker A: So, as you see, that's actually given the theorem before. It's a very simple proof of a nice result. So I think this was one I definitely wanted to mention. Okay, so you can see that there. I'm up to where I will continue the next time I give a lecture in the course. But I do want to give plenty of time for questions. So I will open up the floor if anyone has any questions.
00:50:38.406 - 00:50:43.854, Speaker A: I did go a little bit fast, especially through the Conley Whiteley theorem. So if you want to ask anything, please do.
