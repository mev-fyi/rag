00:00:01.640 - 00:00:48.114, Speaker A: Welcome back. So, we are continuing characterization of Bessel processes. And last time we defined q of x y, the probability that x and y are eaten together, they hit zero together. And we only consider from now on case a is less than one half. We proved everything for the case a is bigger than one half. And first we notice by scaling that to start this probability, we just need to study the probability that x over y and one hit it simultaneously. So, let's look at this q of r1.
00:00:48.114 - 00:01:32.844, Speaker A: And first thing first, let's note that for any a, the probability that one and error r hit zero simultaneously when r is very small. When r tend to zero, that should turn to zero. And the reason for this is the following. Tr has the same distribution as r squared t one. So probability that tr is bigger or equal than delta is the same as the probability that r squared t one is bigger equal than delta. So for each epsilon, we can find r delta size. The probabilities are, this is equals on delta is less or equal than epsilon over two.
00:01:32.844 - 00:02:16.560, Speaker A: And of course, well, t one also has some distribution. So probability that t one is less than delta is also less than epsilon two. So now the probability that both of these events happened is less equal than epsilon. So again, probabilities that are bigger equals than delta is the same as the probability that t one is bigger or equal than delta r squared. And by selecting first r and then delta small enough, we can make delta of r squared to be very small. But on the other hand, delta itself also to be very small. So this probability would be small.
00:02:16.560 - 00:03:15.374, Speaker A: And the probability that t one is bigger than delta r squared would also be less than epsilon, because this is, again, this almost show finite nonzero variable. So we have the probability that they agree to each other. It's less or equal than epsilon. And now let u be the supremum of the ratio before r hits zero. So, what am I saying here? We know that this is bigger than this. Strictly, we look at the ratio, and we want this supremum to be found bound. Well, let me be very specific.
00:03:15.374 - 00:04:30.492, Speaker A: Suppose that r hit zero before one, and then I claim that u is infinite, almost surely. So, to make it precise probability that tr is less than t one and u itself, the supreme of the ratio, is less than infinity. This is zero. On the other hand, probability that tr is equal to t one and the ratio has supreme infinity, this is also zero. So, in slightly less rigorous terms, these two events agree almost surely that tr is equal to t one and that u, the supreme, is less than infinity. Okay, so one direction is kind of easy. So if you know that u is less than infinity, then we know that x one is bounded by constant times xt for all times, in particular the moment.
00:04:30.492 - 00:04:58.564, Speaker A: Well, let me be careful here. Xr. So this is the same as xr. So I apologize, by the way, for flipping indexes of tivan and tr. So hope it's not too confusing. Sometimes it's more convenient for me to write it at the bottom, sometimes at the top. But okay, let's not concentrate too much on this.
00:04:58.564 - 00:05:47.094, Speaker A: So if this is bounded, then t one is equal to tar. So we prove this second is more interesting because nobody stops them from hitting zero together. But maybe this guy is like square root of the bottom guy. So the supreme would be infinite. Let's see why it doesn't happen. Let sigma n be the first time the ratio hits n. So again, we are looking at this event and we want to show that it has probability zero.
00:05:47.094 - 00:06:40.730, Speaker A: So if you use incident, this sigma n is finite. Okay, and then what happens? Probability that u big is equal to tr is the following. This is the bounded by the probability that t one equal to tr, given that sigma n is less than infinity, as we saw. So if u is less or equal than n, then this is finite. So we just look at this. So what does it mean that sigma n is fine, bounded. We can use Markov property to see that this is the same as we started at the moment, sigma m.
00:06:40.730 - 00:07:28.474, Speaker A: So we have two guys, they one then times the other, and they try to simultaneously reach zero. So this is the scale as q of one over n one, right. The first guy is n times smaller than the other guy. So by markov plus rescaling this q one over n one, which tends to zero. Well, we already saw that this exciting guy all tends to zero. So we are done that the probability that this would be bigger than n t one is equal to t r tends to zero when n times to infinity. So probability that u is equal to infinity and they equal, it doesn't happen.
00:07:28.474 - 00:08:47.394, Speaker A: Okay, so of course, now, instead of canciting this event, we would study this ratio and we will see how can it be about. And let us define lc to be logarithm of the bound minus one. So this is logarithm of the difference minus logarithm of xtr. Okay? And we can just use definition of Bessel and data formula to write down the differential equation for Lc. Now, so this is just lc satisfies this drift term plus one over xr minus one over xrt, dbt. Okay, so again, you can just take Bessel and plug everything. And now the standard trick, we want to study the behavior of this, right? We want to see when this thing is unbounded, it's the same as this thing going to infinity.
00:08:47.394 - 00:09:14.446, Speaker A: So we want to study the behavior of this. And for this, we'll make. So now I'll start heavily using theta calculus. Now, I want to make this into a standard brownian motion. So I want this term to be a standard brownian motion. And, well, the change of time. Remember the theorem, we should use quadratic variation.
00:09:14.446 - 00:10:24.124, Speaker A: Quadratic variation of e to integral is integral of the what? Well, what we integrate squared with respect to quadratic variation, in this case, just t. So this is our new change time. So sigma t is defined to be the time for which this integral is equal to t. Okay, so what does it mean that what happens at tx? So sigma inverse of tx is equal to infinity is the same as to say that this integral is infinite. Let's prove it. So, let us look at the first time, our process. Now we go down, so reaches two to the minus j, and y would be this integral.
00:10:24.124 - 00:11:18.874, Speaker A: So this is integral of xrs squared from tj minus one to tj. Now let's use Markov. It's the same as to say that we integrate this process started at two minus j over this tj minus tj minus one. So we start at two minus j and we want to reach two to the minus j minus one. And by scaling all of this y, because we can just change time, expectation is positive. And this integral is just some of this y js. So it's infinite.
00:11:18.874 - 00:12:12.012, Speaker A: So this time here, this is very important. This new time sigma, our old time ran up to tr here. Make my notation consistent. So we used to run up to time tr, but now we run up to infinity. This would be very important because in new time, I want to be able to say that something happens in infinite time. Okay? And so we change the time we need now to change our process. So this w of t would be just integral of just this part.
00:12:12.012 - 00:12:52.892, Speaker A: And again, we are using, we are, we are not using dds theorem here. We are just using krita calculus to see that this is brownian motion. Variation of this is the integral of this, which would be equal to t. So this w of t is indeed a brownian motion. And now let us define l t tilde to be l at time sigma t. And then look at satisfy this exciting differential equation here. So lots of things are simplified here.
00:12:52.892 - 00:13:44.704, Speaker A: In particular, it's great that this term went away. Okay, so now here things would change, start changing dramatically for a less than one quarter and more than one quarter. But let's first look at a less than one half. Okay? So if a is less than one half, then let's observe the following. You see, this thing is positive. So what we are scared of is when. So this is kind of a brownian motion.
00:13:44.704 - 00:14:40.312, Speaker A: So we want to have a drift of the same size. So if Lt Tilde is bigger than this k, just suppose that we know that Lt tilde is bigger than k. We know that this whole thing is bigger than some alpha, some positive alpha. So so far, again, this happens for all a less than one half. Okay, so suppose that at some moment your LC tilde was large. Remember, that's what we are trying to study, the moment when. So it's kind of maybe hard to follow now all these notations.
00:14:40.312 - 00:15:32.866, Speaker A: But let's remember that we are trying to study situations when this is life. So this is the same as to say that this is life. So suppose that at some moment just we are like Lt Tilde was bigger than k one. Then what happens is the following. Till we reach level k, this whole thing is like brownian motion. So this is brownian motion, but with drift, with drift alpha. And then again, just by what we know about brownian motion, so brownian motion with drift alpha tends to infinity, this positive probability, well, pranial motion with drift alpha always tends to infinity.
00:15:32.866 - 00:16:44.478, Speaker A: But you can compare probability that it hits k before hitting infinity. Again, this is just standard estimates on the maximum brownian motion layer. Already have those. So what does it mean that if Lt tilde at some moment became bigger than this k plus one, then Lt tilde would tend to infinity, which means that x tilde over xtr when you approach tr, would tend to infinity. So they hit it at different time. So the moment you are bigger than k plus one, life is great. Now if a is less than one quarter, less equals than one quarter.
00:16:44.478 - 00:17:15.553, Speaker A: Look at this. This is bounded by one two minus one quarter. Well, and this is at least another one quarter. So this is always positive. So Lt tilde is at least as small as brownian motion. So it's bigger than brownian motion. It's brownian motion, this positive drift.
00:17:15.553 - 00:17:52.186, Speaker A: Okay, so it would be bigger than usual brownian motion. And it means that limb soup is equal to infinity. So this LC tilde, well, it oscillates, it oscillates above brownian motion. So it tends to, well, it doesn't necessarily tend to infinity. It's just positive drift, but maybe arbitrary small. But what did we observe? We observed that if Lt. Tilde at some point became bigger than k one with positive probability, it went to infinity.
00:17:52.186 - 00:18:32.814, Speaker A: And the probability doesn't actually depend on time. But since this happens infinitely often, well, then this actually always tends to infinity. Tends to infinity with probability one. So it's like, you know, infinitely many trials, you hit k plus one. So sure, you have some probability p to not go to infinity, but then you would hit, you know, that you would hit k plus one again. And again you just have probability p. So the probability that after n such attempts, you didn't go to infinity, p to z is bounded by p to z.
00:18:32.814 - 00:19:18.464, Speaker A: And that clearly means that you would always go to infinity and then goes to infinity. So this implies six. So lt tilde goes to infinity. This goes to infinity t one is not equal to t r, this probability one for any pair of numbers. And again, it's enough to do it for rationals. And then extended to everything by montanicity. Okay, now the most technically difficult case, a is at least one quarter, but less than one half.
00:19:18.464 - 00:20:06.540, Speaker A: Okay, so here things become more interesting here. You can always find alpha and k such that if you are small, if Lt. Tilde is less or equal than negative k, then this difference is less than negative alpha. So let's return to the equation. So this is less than negative alpha. Mm hmm. Now we compare this bt minus alpha, t negative drift, and we see the opposite, that there is some case that if Lt.
00:20:06.540 - 00:20:59.080, Speaker A: Tilde was less or equal than minus k minus one, this positive probability u ten to minus infinity. And so this means that u is less than infinity, less than infinity, which implies that tr is equal to t one. But now let us see, if you start with anything, then probability that you would be less than minus k minus one, it's positive. So brownian motion, this positive drift. And here the maximum drift that you can have, well, a is bigger than one quarter. So you are maturated by one quarter plus t. So this is brownian motionless positive drift.
00:20:59.080 - 00:21:39.150, Speaker A: It's very interesting object. It, of course, tends to infinity almost surely. It almost surely, of course, has bounded infino. But again, you can just check that the probability that at time t, it becomes less than k minus one at any given time t is actually it's positive, which might be a very small one, but it's positive. So you became less than k minus one. But then another mode switches on. So at this moment, you can have a better bound on the drift, your drift suddenly becomes negative.
00:21:39.150 - 00:23:07.394, Speaker A: So again, you're bounded by this, but the moment you hit minus k minus one, your drift became negative and stays negative, this positive probability. So this positive probability on positive probability, this thing happens. And so, probability that u is less than infinity is positive. And so for every r, again, q of r1 is positive. And we are done with our estimate five. Okay, so here again, let me quickly summarize what we just did. We notice that for these Bessel processes defined by this equation, where is it? By this equation, we have a clear phase transition at one half, because when a is big or equal than one half, each point, no point would hit zero.
00:23:07.394 - 00:23:55.824, Speaker A: When a less than one half, every point would hit zero eventually. And when a is less or equal than one quarter, they actually would hit zero in different times. When a is between one four and one two, they sometimes stick together. Actually, with positive probabilities, they would all stick together. And another thing is this infimum is zero when a is less or equal than one half. And the Bessel process tends to infinity when a is bigger than one half. Okay, so that was the technical preparation for what would happen next.
00:23:55.824 - 00:24:58.034, Speaker A: And what would happen next is, well, we finally define rigorously the main object of our course, SLA. And remember how I introduced l evolution? I started with radial luven revolutions and I said, oh, okay. There is also this newer version, chordal Liovna revolution, which is essentially the same for SLA. It's actually convenient to start the other way around. I start with introducing chordal as a version of SLA, and then we'll talk about relation between low chordal and radial. So let me start with a bit of motivation. So what is what it is we want, what it is we are trying to introduce.
00:24:58.034 - 00:25:56.224, Speaker A: So, suppose that we have simply connected domain omega. So this is a simply connected domain omega here. And we want to create a random curve joining prime ends a and b in the boundary which satisfy the following conditions. First is conformal invariance. So what does it mean? Suppose that you have two domains, omega one and omega two, and you have two curves there. Well, two random curves defined this way. And now consider conformal map, which maps omega one two, omega two, and which would map a one to a two, b one to b two.
00:25:56.224 - 00:27:00.234, Speaker A: You can always find one and actually infinitely many ones. You will see, of course, if omega, both omega one and omega two are simply connected, then something like what happened with brownian motion should hold the law of the image of this curve here, of the random curve should be the same as the law of the random curve in the image. Okay, so this is conformal variance. And the other thing is Markov property. So suppose that I know that my curve starts with gamma prime. So I just know this, I condition on this. I say, okay, I know that my curve started going like this.
00:27:00.234 - 00:27:38.124, Speaker A: And suppose I keep going. So this blue thing here was my curve gamma prime, and then I keep going. Then the law of the keep going curve can be obtained the following Way. You look at the domain. So let me be slightly more precise here. You look at Gamma and Omega ab and this is Omega minus gamma prime. And you start at gamma prime of T.
00:27:38.124 - 00:28:27.254, Speaker A: So this is your gamma prime of t, and you go to b. Okay, so what's the difference between these two objects? Again, this is the law. Left hand side is the law in our domain omega. Right hand SIde is ActualLY the law in our new domain. You take domain Omega and you cut off the beginning curve and they should be the same. So this is called domain Markov property. Now, of course I want to define everything by Jovenir values.
00:28:27.254 - 00:30:35.994, Speaker A: So I want gamma to be curves, to be curves SUCH that, so let me actually write it. And so what do I mean by this? I mean that if you define omega t component of omega minus gamma of zero t containing b at the boundary, then this family omega t should form load chain, meaning that t to omega t should be continuous, omega t should be subset not equal to omegas. If t is less than. This is actually a very important condition. So if you have, so let me write, they form this chordal chain. So for example, brownian motion doesn't satisfy it, okay? And there will actually be additional conditions later. But for now, let us just assume this.
00:30:35.994 - 00:31:46.434, Speaker A: Now by conformal variance, of course, all we have to do, we have to define it in one domain. And as we discussed in the definition of chordal leomr, this domain should be h and define everything there. And then we can define our random curve in any other domain by the we just map our upper half plane to this domain, map zero to a, map infinity to b. Well, there are a few maps like this. So this process should be to be well defined, even to be well defined, it should already satisfy certain properties. But if we now know conformal invariance. So if you already know one, then actually we can replace two with the condition two prime.
00:31:46.434 - 00:32:45.038, Speaker A: This is called conformal Markov property. So for this what we do, we consider this map gt well, this is complement of the curve gamma up to time t v unzipped back to h. And we consider this hydrodynamic normalization. Now gt of gamma t. Remember, this was lambda t. And now we shift by lambda t to make sure that this thing goes to zero. Remember again how we define things.
00:32:45.038 - 00:33:48.974, Speaker A: We want a random curve. Forget about self stretching curves for now space filling curves. Just to simplify things, consider simple curve. So, like here. And we want then to say the following, that what happens after this can be obtained by conformal map from h to this domain and conform all map of water of this random curve in the half plane. So the law of the image of what is left and the Gt shifted back to zero. So that's why write this should be the same as law of the original curve, gamma.
00:33:48.974 - 00:34:49.544, Speaker A: Okay, so this is the condition. And now what can gamma be? Okay, so gamma is a random curve. It's a probability measured curve in h. Now, on curves going from zero to infinity, which satisfies this condition. When you unzip the beginning of the curve, what is left has the same law. So how could it be? And here comes theorem of schramm, which led to the introduction of facility. So, let gamma be a random Leonard curve, which satisfies conditions one and two prime.
00:34:49.544 - 00:35:40.502, Speaker A: Then I claim that its driving function is brownian motion run with some speed kappa for some kappa. And I need to assume something. I need to assume that this lambda of t, the image of the tip, has finite expectation. So what is tacitly assumed in this area? It's assumed that this law lives on Ljovnir curves. So, on curves which are generated by random function lambda of t. So, driving function should be lambda of t is gt of gamma of t, and that should generate a curve. And as we discussed, this means that the curve can be self touching, can be space feeling, but it cannot be self intersecting.
00:35:40.502 - 00:37:14.284, Speaker A: So again, brownian motion is not of this kind, which is good, because, well, clearly it's not in the class. But if you have a curve for which you can write brownian, for which you can write the equation chordal equation, and which satisfies conformal invariance and conformal Markov property, then this curve has to be brownian motion run with certain constant speed kappa. Again, technical condition, which we would have to prove when we would prove convergence later, is that the expectations should be bounded. Okay, so let us prove the theorem. This is not a difficult theorem, but it is revolutionary theorem, because again, it allowed to create this class of Strumlevner evolutions. So let lambda of t be this driving function of gamma. And the notation here is that Gt would be gt minus lambda of t is a shifted map and zp map.
00:37:14.284 - 00:38:16.794, Speaker A: And so let's see what it tells us. Suppose that we know GT. So suppose that we know how what was unzipped at time t, then at time t plus delta, what is unzipped should be obtained by the following. You run your random map up to time delta here and then you apply here. So gt plus delta conditional Gt is just composition of gt and g delta. And now again, as I said, things are easy, but let's try to what would happen here actually is a preview of what would happen when the proof conversions. So let's expand gt plus delta in infinity.
00:38:16.794 - 00:38:48.094, Speaker A: So z minus lambda t plus delta condition to gt. Now let's expand this. This is composition of this z minus lambda t. Remember, this is hydrodynamic randomization. This is z minus lambda delta composed with this. So just write composition. And the first term is z minus lambda t plus lambda delta plus higher order terms.
00:38:48.094 - 00:39:45.484, Speaker A: So if you know gt, then the law of lambda t plus delta minus lambda t is the same as the law of lambda delta. So what does it mean? It means that lambda t minus lambda t plus delta minus lambda t is stationary and it's dependent on lambda t o t and expectation of the difference. Well, this is expectation of lambda delta. More than that, you can write conditional expectation up to time t and you can see that expectation of lambda t plus delta is lambda t. Conditional expectation of lambda t plus delta. Given gt, it's lambda t. So it is martingale.
00:39:45.484 - 00:40:33.554, Speaker A: Aha, it is a martingale. And let's see what happens with expectations. I just took expectations of both sides and I see that it's increasing. So expectation of lambda t is alpha t for some alpha. Okay, now this is what I meant here. So expectation of lambda t plus del t plus delta minus conditional expectation of lambda t plus delta over gt. So we just expanded lambda t plus delta minus lambda t plus lambda t minus lambda t plus delta condition from gt.
00:40:33.554 - 00:41:25.036, Speaker A: This expectation of this thing, this is expected lambda t minus, expectation of lambda t. So lambda t minus expectation of lambda t is a martingal. Sorry, initially said that lambda t itself is a martingale. Kind of rushed a bit. What we know from this identity is only that expectation of conditional expectation lambda T plus delta minus expectation of lambda t plus delta. The conditional expectation of this is lambda t minus expectation lambda t. So lambda t minus expectation of lambda t is a martingale, and now this is a martingale, which is t independent.
00:41:25.036 - 00:42:03.794, Speaker A: Well, okay, with t independent increment. So quadratic variation of this exciting martingale, just a linear function. So which means that this lambda t minus alpha t. Remember, alpha t was defined such that expectation of lambda t is alpha t. This is brownian motion run with some constant speed. This is very important by Lewis area, because again, quadratic variation now is linear. Okay, now here's the key moment.
00:42:03.794 - 00:43:18.994, Speaker A: Remember, I kept telling you that there are more than one maps which would map h zero infinity to your domain and map zero to a b to infinity. Because you can always pre compose with multiplication in this plane, you can always pre compose with multiplication. So this is conformal map of h. And it should not change the law, because again, to even be able to define it, we need the law to be independent of this theory. But what happens with lambda? But we know what happens with lambda when we rescale. The rescale lambda becomes one over c lambda of c squared t. Remember, we had the scaling.
00:43:18.994 - 00:44:14.794, Speaker A: It's exactly scaling of the brownian motion. Now plug this in here so we know that lambda of t is brownian motion plus alpha t. You rescale, this satisfies. Rescaling this doesn't. So alpha is equal to zero. And that's it. So we just proved that if you have Leo curve, so curve, which is describable by Leovner equation with some random driving terminal, and you wanted to satisfy conformal invariance and Markov property, then it has to be brownian motion, which is run with certain speed kappa.
00:44:14.794 - 00:45:31.506, Speaker A: So this is theorem of shaman. And now we are ready for our main definition. So the main definition would be that opposite is true. Also true. This calculation essentially shows that if lambda of t is brownian motion run with some constant speed, the corresponding process satisfies two prime. So, acylic kappa in upper half plane from zero to infinity is the Leofner equation with the driving force b of kappa t, which is the same distribution square root of kappa b of t in brownian scale. Okay, so that's the definition of sle kappa in first here and then, well, again by brownian scaling and scaling of lieutenant revolution, we see that rescaled SLA.
00:45:31.506 - 00:46:41.734, Speaker A: So if you consider the curve gamma and you now multiply by c, you get the same thing. This is just scaling for both SLA and Lucas revolution. And second property is even stronger than conformal variance. If you have any stopping time tau and you look at your new process, which you define this way, you take your brownian motion, you move it to time tau, you apply g tau inverse. So, oh, f tau. Remember this notation? So you map to the curve, then you run Luovnir evolution starting at time tau, and you normalize. So this is, you normalize back.
00:46:41.734 - 00:47:59.394, Speaker A: This would be again sla kappa. This just follows from strong Markov property for brownian motion, because you can write down the driving function of this, and surprise, surprise, this would be so the driving function. So for gt tilde, the driving function, the driving function is lambda tilde t, which is by definition would be b of kappa t plus tau minus b of kappa tau. Again, you can just look at the evolution of t and this would be b of capital minus b of capital, which is in distribution is the same as b of capital. So the driving function for this time change thing is b of capital. So this is sla again. So let me reemphasize that.
00:47:59.394 - 00:49:09.584, Speaker A: Initially you just required that this would be true for any fixed time tau. So if you look carefully at what we were doing with Schram's theorem, condition two prime was essentially that this is true for any fixed time tau. But now will istrophonia stopping time. And finally, we can define slic up in any domain and simply connect the domain with two boundary prime ends. Remember, the cars are boundary by looking at the conformal map and define catholic just by image. And this is conformal map of a select up nh and by scaling covariance. It doesn't depend on choice of file, right? Because there are many maps like this which would map your domain with two boundary points to another domain with two boundary points, but they are different by scale.
00:49:09.584 - 00:50:01.144, Speaker A: And we know that SLA is scaling invariance. That's why, by the way, it was good to start with chordal situation. There is extra structure here which we can exploit. Okay, this is all nice and good, but it begs the question. I said that it should be generated by a curve and all this, but would the brownian motion generate a curve? It's totally not obvious. More than that. Remember that the best deterministic theorem that we have now is for one half older functions, not even for all of them.
00:50:01.144 - 00:50:43.924, Speaker A: And brownian curve, as we know, is not one half Garfunkel. So what happens here? And this, here comes a great theorem which will prove next time that Sle Kappa, at least in h, is generated by Ljevner curve. Actually, it's generated by a Ljovnir curve in any domain. But we will prove this later. And then you simply connected domain. And the proof that I would give interestingly works only for Kappa, not equal to eight. This is original proof of Rodentsram.
00:50:43.924 - 00:51:09.844, Speaker A: There is no proof that I know which directly works with the k scal to eight this. So the proof for Kappa equal to eight. The theorem is also true. But the proof is very indirect. It uses approximation of SLA eight by uniform spinning trees. Okay, so. But we'll do the proof next time.
00:51:09.844 - 00:51:11.404, Speaker A: Let me stop the recording for now.
