00:00:04.080 - 00:00:50.694, Speaker A: Hello everyone, welcome to our next lecture. And let me start today with a bit of recap of what happened at the end of last lecture. So, let me remind you of a setup that we have. We have what is called conformal triangle. So a domain in the complex plane, which we always envision to be simply connected. So this is our domain here, and we intersected with hexagonal lattice, which is very important here. What I discuss here works only for hexagonal lattice.
00:00:50.694 - 00:01:42.744, Speaker A: We have three points on the boundary a, b, c and c, and corresponding vertices of the A delta, B delta and C delta. The lattice is rescaled by a factor of delta. And we can see the percolation, meaning that we flip a fair coin and we assign blue or yellow color to each face. Rather physical probability. And so this is our setup. And last time we looked at these three absorbables, which were introduced by Smirnov and which are usually called Cardi Smirnov absorbables. So this is the following.
00:01:42.744 - 00:03:39.654, Speaker A: You look at a point in your conformal triangle and you look at the probability ha delta, that this point is separated by a blue crosscut from side bc together with a, so that the pair of points a and z are separated from Bc, and the same with hb delta Hc delta. And these events were called ea delta e b delta e c delta. And the main theorem that we'll finish proving today is this result that if you take combination of ha delta, HB delta and Hc delta with the factors of tau, where tau is cube root of unity, then this combination converges to the conformal map, from your conformal triangle to the honest to goodness equilateral triangle, and that the sum converge tolerance. So that's what we'll finish today. And as we discussed last time, because of the tightness that we already established, it's enough to just look at the subsequential limit of this function. So take some subsequence, delta n going to zero, for which both of these guys have sequences, have limits, and show that this limits have to be, this limit has to be this conformal map, this limit has to be one. And then again, by compactness, everything could follow.
00:03:39.654 - 00:05:26.876, Speaker A: And the main technical tool, which is the only tool available only for this particular kind of percolation, the percolation phase, percolation hexagonal lattice, is this derivative estimate of Smirnov. And then from this last calculation that we had last time, was that if you look at the face of your lattice and you integrate your function h delta, then you have this unveil the formula for the integral, val seems to be contemplating this very nice expression has to be written as this totally not nice expression. But hopefully it will become clear in the moment why it was necessary. Okay, so now let's continue the proof. So, how would we prove that this subsequential limit functions h and this one, that they are Vulcan, formal map or identity? The first thing to check is to show that they are analytic. And to check that they are analytic, we will use Marrero theorem. We'll take a smooth curve, take its discretization, and integrate our function h delta.
00:05:26.876 - 00:05:58.474, Speaker A: So this combination first over this curve, and then we'll combine this function, the approximation to, well, two units. So, h delta. Let me remind you, this combination of hb and c with correct factors, one tau tau squared and s delta is simply the sum. And we'll show that both of these integrals are, well, they're not actually zero. That's the problem. They're close to zero. So let me explain why.
00:05:58.474 - 00:07:11.200, Speaker A: So let us write this integrals. So, remember that the best thing about discrete integration is that we can, instead of integrating over quantum, we can just look at all the faces inside, integrate over them, and then sum up all the integrals over inside faces would just cancel out. So let's just write down what it would be. First term of this integral would be this sum, but with a factor without factor of one half. Why? Because we count each inside edge twice, once in the positive direction and once in the negative direction, but in the negative direction, it goes with the minus sign. So they actually sum up. So this is sum over all inside edges.
00:07:11.200 - 00:07:45.544, Speaker A: E star. Remember, this is a dual edge multiplied by this construct. Let's call it one. And then there are some edges which are on the boundary, which are not cancelled. So this would be simply. So for this, we resolve to this sum. Okay, and so now remember that I told you that it's very important to have this a priori elder bound, which we derived from rhutor Simon Welsh.
00:07:45.544 - 00:08:38.004, Speaker A: So this was an a priori bound that we derived last time. So here it plays very nicely. So, let's look at this second integral, and we just know that this is bounded by k delta to the beta. This is the bound on dh. Remember, dh is the difference of the values of h at the end of the f and h. So this is k delta to the beta. I don't know why I have extra factors here.
00:08:38.004 - 00:09:14.552, Speaker A: Let me correct it. Multiplied by length of delta. Well, here, by length of delta, gamma delta. I mean, of course, number of terms here, but the number of terms here. Well, it's bounded by constant over delta. It's a smooth curve. So when you approximate it by discrete curve, you have this bound one over delta.
00:09:14.552 - 00:09:59.756, Speaker A: So when you multiply this together, you get this and, oh, and I forgot that there is also a factor of delta which comes from here. So, all in all, it's like delta to the beta. The main thing for us, that it goes to zero is delta goes to zero. On the other hand, if you look at one, you can just write that this is the same as this sum e star. This is the same as pa. This is the same as tau squared. Pie.
00:09:59.756 - 00:10:23.514, Speaker A: This is the same as tau to the fourth pair. This is Beissmirnov theorem. That's why we finally use it. And we now use the fact that one plus tau squared plus tau to the four is equal to zero. That's the sum of all cubic roots of units zero. So price elementary. So this first integral is zero.
00:10:23.514 - 00:11:16.494, Speaker A: So again, this is the place which is not. Unfortunately, as far as I know, as of September 27, 2021, cannot be repeated for any other model. And so, first integral is zero. Second integral is bounded by constant times delta to the beta, which of course, happily means that this integral tends to zero. So we have Mariaro theorem, and so h for h, this integral is zero. Well, you would notice that there is a slight leap of faith when I write that the limit of this integral equal to this integral, the curves do change, and of course, lengths can change. But again, this is easy.
00:11:16.494 - 00:12:02.184, Speaker A: You can just use green theorem and again use similar priory bound to this one to show that actually this limit is equal to this limit and it's zero. So h is an analytic function, but the same computation for s. So here it would be exactly the same computation for s, except that, of course, there would be no tau, no tau squared here, so there would be a factor of tau here and tau squared here. So it's exactly the same. We get that s is analytic. Now, this is easy. So it's a real function because, well, it's a limit of absolutely real, guys.
00:12:02.184 - 00:12:26.324, Speaker A: So this is the sum of three probabilities. It's real. So s is real. Now, s at any vertex is equal to one, because again, at any vertex, this is equal to one, this is equal to zero. This is equal to zero. One plus zero plus zero. So s is identically one.
00:12:26.324 - 00:13:21.884, Speaker A: So what we have is that the sum of the probabilities that we are separated tends to one. Again, as I mentioned last time, by itself, this is a totally non trivial conclusion, but valid is correct. So we have it ss identical. Okay, so this was easy. Now, all we know about function h is that it's analytic. Again, at this moment, we need some sort of unique identifying information. We need to show that h is indeed conformal map to the triangle which maps the three boundary points to one tau tau squared.
00:13:21.884 - 00:14:13.564, Speaker A: Let's see what it does on each side. Let's see what it does on Bc. So let's return to our first picture with the definition we are on BC somewhere. Well, clearly this guy is just zero if you're on the side Bc you cannot separate from. So, which means that hb plus Hc is equal to one. Remember that the sum of all three guys is equal to one. So hb plus Hc on this side is equal to one.
00:14:13.564 - 00:15:18.524, Speaker A: So let's return back. So for the limiting functions, this would be the same. Hb plus Hc is equal to one. So h of z itself, it's tau, h of b plus tau squared, so h of C, that's just a point on tau tau squared. Okay, so now what happens? H maps bc to tau tau squared, as we just discovered by exactly same token, h maps ab to one tau, and h maps ca to tau squared one. Okay, so what else can we observe? H is also increasing on each side. So by increasing, I mean, when you go from b to c, you go from tau to tau squared.
00:15:18.524 - 00:15:54.812, Speaker A: A priori. You don't know that you're increasing one at only. Really, the closer you are to be, the higher the this and the lower is this. So you really, when you go from b to c, you consider this monoton. Again, I don't claim strict monotonous discrete analog, of course, they are strictly monotone, but here I don't yet know. I will know it in a moment. And here I will use a very simple lemma from complex analysis.
00:15:54.812 - 00:16:21.818, Speaker A: And the lemma is the following. Suppose that h is from omega one to omega two. It's analytic. Suppose that gamma is boundary of omega two. Suppose that it's a jog curve. And suppose that h maps boundary of omega one to gamma and preserves orientation. So it just maps boundary to boundary, preserving orientation.
00:16:21.818 - 00:17:25.634, Speaker A: That's all I know. Then h inside the domain is conformal. Okay, so we know that a priori, that it's analytic, extendable to boundary weight, preserves orientation. Okay? So for now, since we don't yet have machinery of prime ends, let me only prove this lemma for the case when the boundary of the dhammainomic one itself is a Jordan curve. So for this, let's take any a in omega two. So let us look at the number of solutions of this equation. H of z is equal to a.
00:17:25.634 - 00:18:12.234, Speaker A: But it's by the argument principle. This is equal to the winding number of the curve h of d omega one around a. Right, that's argument principle for it. But this winding number is one, because you map Jordan cure to this joining curve preserving orientation. So the winding number is one. Now let's look at this picture. Our h maps boundary of our conformal triangle ABC into boundary of equilateral triangle preserving orientation.
00:18:12.234 - 00:18:43.854, Speaker A: Again, nowhere. Here I need to know that h is one to one on the boundary. I don't even need that. All I care about is the winded number. So by this little lemma, we know that our h is the conformal map. Okay, so now let's assemble everything. We know that h is analytic function.
00:18:43.854 - 00:20:13.924, Speaker A: So we just proved that it's a conformal map which maps a, b and c to one tau tau squared. And h was arbitrary subsequential limit. Again, by compactness, we know that h is now the limit of the function h delta. That's exactly what we want to talk about, that this function h delta of z, this linear combination of our probabilities, tends to the conform moment. Okay, so before I move on, let me describe what just happened a bit. So what we did here, we established some conformally invariant property of hexagonal percolation on face percolation rather than hexagonal lattice. This, as we will see later, would allow us to prove that critical interface for exploration process convergence to one of the SLS, SLE six.
00:20:13.924 - 00:21:22.064, Speaker A: But this was the first crucial step and it essentially required just a bit of combinatorics and practically zero complex analysis. Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go without more advanced complex analysis and more advanced probability. So, to try to get further, to try to prove this element, other theorems which I mentioned before in this combinatorics part will need to really dig deep into both geometric functions, area and probability. And here I know that for some of you, this would be one of both of these parts would be very boring. So my apologies. In particular, the very common part about distortions theory for conformal maps. I will try to go through this very quickly and then we'll do it the calculus.
00:21:22.064 - 00:22:41.424, Speaker A: Again, I'll go very quickly through this and hopefully after that we can start discussing sle theory. And after that the convergence results. Any questions about Smirnov proof first? Okay, if not, let me move on and let me, as I promised, completely change the pace and the subject. So now I will very quickly go through distortion theory for conformal maps. This is a pretty standard subject. Again, I know that most of the people here should be very familiar with this, but I just wanted to know, make sure that we cover all the basics before proceeding. If you feel that, as usual, it's a small class, so if you feel that we are going too fast, too slow, just chat to me, mail me, and I'll adjust accordingly.
00:22:41.424 - 00:23:24.918, Speaker A: Okay, so with this set, let me start with the stuff which is usually now undergraduate courses, right? So let's look at Carl Schwartz. And I say what is told by Leonard Karlsson. It's very important not to use to spell Carl Schwarz correctly without t. You see, in Russian, both of the Schwarzes are spelled the same. So. Well, I didn't know. But of course, Lauren Schwartz, who is famous for inventing generalized function, and Carl Schwartz are two very different mathematicians.
00:23:24.918 - 00:24:16.254, Speaker A: And so this is Carl Schwartz, and again, very elementary result. Schwarz Lammer. Let me state it in the classical form. So suppose that you have an analytic function from the unit disk to itself, very important map zero to zero. Then f of z is bounded by z and the derivative at zero. Oops, I managed to misstate even this is bounded by one. And well, we all know the proof, it's just maximum principle.
00:24:16.254 - 00:25:32.474, Speaker A: Why am I stating this? Because now I will try to state it in a more invariant form, which may be not familiar to everybody here. Well, the first corollary is that all the self maps of the unit disk immobilismaps, which are ei theta z minus z zero divided by one minus z zero bar z. So this is all the conformal automorphisms of the unit disk. And then the invariant metric is called hyperbolic metric. You look at all the curves joining two points of the unit disk. You integrate this conformal metric, one minus absolute value of z squared, and the z axis there are as well no curves, which are circles, straight lines which are toggle to the unit circle. And it's given basis.
00:25:32.474 - 00:26:35.760, Speaker A: And what is much easier to write, this pseudo hyperbolic matrix, which is hyperbolic tanosis, which is just the one absolute value of the one minus z two divided by one minus the 1 bar the two. It's trivial to check that this matrix is invariant under the automorphisms. So if you phase out a morphism of the disk, then the distance is the same. And what does it apply? It implies that if you have a simply connected domain, then you can simply define hyperbolic matrix there, or quasi hyperbolic, pseudo hyperbolic resonant quasi hyperbolic. Quasi hyperbolic. In a moment, pseudo hyperbolic metrics. There, by simply taking preimages of these two points and looking at the distance between them, it is well defined, because again, this maps two of such maps.
00:26:35.760 - 00:27:44.854, Speaker A: If you take another map, the difference between them is an automorphism of the unit this. So, well, I even wrote down the proof here. But again, I promise to go very quickly through this part. And so, just a bit of, for notational things, a hyperbolic metric in the upper half plane is given by this metric element dz over vertical component over imaginary pattern. Okay, so schwarz lemma in invariant form, then becomes simply that any analytic map between two simply connected domains decreases. Hyperbolic metric, hyperbolic distance. So the distance, hyperbolic distance in the image between two points is less equal than distance between the points themselves.
00:27:44.854 - 00:28:14.414, Speaker A: If at one z one and z two, you get equality, you get equality everywhere. And so this is equivalent to the fact that f just conformed. So, conformal maps preserve hyperbolic metric, analytic maps decrease it. You manage to get a quality for any two points. That's it. And the proof is trivial. You just map everything back, map everything back to the unit disk.
00:28:14.414 - 00:29:22.462, Speaker A: And then you map, say, z one to zero, z two to some point, and the same here you post compose here, you mark f of z one to zero, f of z two to some other point, and you see that absolute value of the image of f two is less than absolute value of the image of the one, and you translate it. So that's easy. Another corollary of this, which is again slightly less common for at least undergraduate courses, is that if you have a conformal map, then the distance from image of a point to the boundary is bounded by the following construct. It's derivative at the point z multiplied by this distance to the boundary one minus absolute value of z squared. And the estimate of this is precise. So here, let me very quickly go through the proof. You just consider this exciting map.
00:29:22.462 - 00:30:08.014, Speaker A: You take f of z, you add w distance from z to the omega, and then you take inverse. So this is a well defined map from d to d, which maps zero to zero, because when you plug in zero here, it's f, inverse of f of z. So this, you cannot yet use Schwarz lemma. So for this, you consider self map, which maps z to zero. Then this h is now mapped from d to d, h of zero is equal to zero, and you can quickly compute the derivative at zero. To see, that's exactly what we need. This is distance divided by six.
00:30:08.014 - 00:30:51.834, Speaker A: Okay, so we have one sided estimate that the distance from the point to the boundary is bounded by this from above. As we'll see in a moment, there is a lower bound which is given by k one quarter theorem. So it's bounded. So this and this are essentially the same up to a factor of four. Again, we'll see it in a moment. Okay, so now let us quickly go through some standard theorems in conformal maps. And the first one is due to Adolf Hurlbit.
00:30:51.834 - 00:31:31.854, Speaker A: So, suppose that you have a family of conformal maps in a domain omega. And suppose that fn converges to some function f uniformly on compact. Then the limiting function is a constant or conformal. Well, first of all, by weirstrass theorem, uniform limit of compacts of analytic functions is analytic. Now suppose that it's not conformable. So what does it mean that it's not conformable? It's not one to one. So for two points f of z one is equal to f of z two.
00:31:31.854 - 00:32:29.764, Speaker A: And so let us consider new functions fn of z minus fn of z two. Then j of z. Simply, this is the limit of this jn of z. And there are two cases. Well, first case that could happen is z j is identically equal to zero. Then this means that f f is identically equal to f of z two, because the limit of this guy cos j of z is simply f of z minus f of zeta. Okay? But if it's not identically equal to zero, then you can find gamma, which surrounds z one, but not z two, such that j of z is not equal to zero on gamma.
00:32:29.764 - 00:33:16.212, Speaker A: And again, a standard application of Rocher argument principle would show you that g would have a zero inside of gamma z one. Well, you know, because of this. So Jn would have zero inside of gamma. But this is a contradiction because Gn could not have zero inside of gamma. Right, because Gn was conformal. That's it. Okay, so again, very quickly, but I assume that you saw this before.
00:33:16.212 - 00:34:11.494, Speaker A: Just wanted to give you a taste of things to come. There will be lots of argument principles in the future. And another theorem that I will use is theorem of french mathematician Paul mantal. And it's about normal families. So normal family of functions would be family which is pre compact in a of d, in general a of omega. So let me actually correct it here. So basically, precompact, let me remind you, it means that any sequence would have a subsequence which converges uniform compacts.
00:34:11.494 - 00:35:05.728, Speaker A: And an easy theorem is that any locally bounded family is pre compact. This is just Bayer, Sala, Scoli, and Cache estimates on the derivatives. Modifical theorem is a Mantau theorem, which says that if you have a subset of f omega, which emits two points, so they exist a and b in complex plane, such that there are no functions from this family, f takes them. Then f is normal. So you don't need to assume that you are bounded. Your family is uniformly bound at all. You have to assume that it emits two points.
00:35:05.728 - 00:36:09.004, Speaker A: And this is, again, this is pretty standard by standard modular function. There is this covering from unidisc to the complement of zero one. Quite beautiful thing with these triangles and all this. So you can define hyperbolic distance here and then, so I'm actually giving the proof of this, because usually people would just say, okay, so you usually, what you do, you lift Fm to the COVID You have maps gen, they're bounded because again, they go from COVID to cover. So they exist, a convergent subsequence. And then you project it down and things are great. What's wrong with this proof? I actually even seen this in a couple of textbooks.
00:36:09.004 - 00:37:17.234, Speaker A: The problem is that of course you don't know that you converge to something which you can move down. Suppose that you converge to some point at the boundary, that you suppose that your limit is actually just a constant, and this constant lies on the boundary. What do you do? You cannot push it back, so you need one more argument here. So let us consider the sequence of n, and then fn of zero converges again, you can just pass to a subsequence fn of zero would converge to some z in extended complex plane. If z is zero, one and infinity. We can use Schwarz lemma to show that actually fn converges to the same z for all w. Fn converges to the same z for all w, because again, hyperbolic distance is smaller than the distance.
00:37:17.234 - 00:38:24.634, Speaker A: So, and hyperbolic distance decreases. So we know that hyperbolic distance from fn of zero and fn is bounded by hyperbolic distance between z and w, which happily tends to, which means that euclidean distance tends to zero. So we just have to consider this additional case to make this proof complete. Okay, so this was again just my pet grief about textbooks. Now let us really talk about our object. And these are two classes, s and sigma. So both s and sigma would be classes of functions conformal.
00:38:24.634 - 00:39:38.356, Speaker A: Here, class s is class of the class of functions conformal in the unit disk, which map zero to zero and has derivative one at zero. So there of this form, f of z plus f of z is equal to z plus this form. And here this is not bigger than one, this is bigger than two, and sigma is closely related. Plus it's. Remember, d is exterior of the unit disk, absolute value of the bigger than one and this of the form. Let me write it nicer. Z plus b zero plus b minus one over z, plus extra terms near infinity.
00:39:38.356 - 00:40:34.444, Speaker A: So these are conformal maps outside of the new disk, with larana expansion at infinity being this. And connection between them is the following. F of z is a function in s if and only if one over f of one over z belongs to sigma. And on the other hand, it's not precise connection. Unfortunately, if j of z is in sigma and c is not in the image of j, then this function is an s one over j of one over z minus. So this is an easy computation, which is trivial to make. But essentially these are the same classes, one inside the disk.
00:40:34.444 - 00:41:23.154, Speaker A: Another is obtained by passing to outside of the disk. And let me look at a couple of examples first. Well, okay, I don't have picture of Kirby here, but I promise that it will appear very soon. This is probably the most important function in geometric functions. Kirby function z divided by one minus z squared. This has this extremal expansion, z plus two, z squared plus three, z cubed plus four, z to the four plus four. So this is, as we now know by the branches theorem, this is the maximum possible coefficients that a function from class s can have.
00:41:23.154 - 00:42:10.230, Speaker A: And this actually maps unidisc into the complement of negative real line run up to minus one quarter. Here I briefly sketched how this goes. And let me remark that, so you can of course, write curvy function as this one quarter one plus z squared minus one. So that's why it maps. Exactly why it maps. But if you look at z to the alpha for all alpha between zero and two, you still get a conformal map from classes. They are less important, but nevertheless very nice to have.
00:42:10.230 - 00:42:59.144, Speaker A: And so why alpha cannot be bigger than two? Well, because you see, even here, when alpha is equal to two, the angle is already two PI, you kind of opening the angle up to two PI. One alpha would be bigger than two. It will still be a locally conformal map, but it would not be one to one. Okay, so the next function is another extremal function, which is commonly known as Zhukovsky transform. And I don't know if Zhukovsky invented it, but that's the standard name. This is an extreme function from sigma. This is very easy function.
00:42:59.144 - 00:43:35.654, Speaker A: This is just z plus one over z. This maps outside of the unit disk to the complement of minus two. And again, typical function from sigma. Okay, let me start with some transforms which preserve f. They actually would be extremely important later, both in this easy part and then much later when we talk about sll. So, first, transform is nth root transform. This is the following.
00:43:35.654 - 00:44:14.416, Speaker A: You see, you observe that this exciting map f of z n over z to z. Well, it has removable singularity at zero. So it's extended to zero. It's never equal to zero. So it's defined in a simply connected domain, unit disk, never equal to zero. So you can take nth root and multiply back by z, and voila, you get a conformal map. Why? Because if g of z one is equal to g of z two.
00:44:14.416 - 00:44:47.644, Speaker A: So this is g g of z one is equal to g of z two. Nth power is the same. So it means that z one to the n is equal to z two to the n. But then you just plug it in here and you see that the one should be equal to z two. So that's proof that it's conformal. And again, why it is an s. It's a simple computation.
00:44:47.644 - 00:45:38.652, Speaker A: So what it does geometrically, remember that each function from s is a map to some simply connected domain. So geometrically, what it does is just take symmetries, the domain n times. So the next thing is not, is not geometrically significant. Okay, so this is. Okay, I need to rewrite it, because this. Let me try to. So what has it done? Yes.
00:45:38.652 - 00:46:41.964, Speaker A: So f tau is the following. So this is. So you take f compose with tau of z. Then you compose it with tau f of the inverse, and that, and then u divide by tau, prime of zero. So by tau f of z, I mean the map which would map f of z back to, back to the original thing. And in particular, if you have back to the zero, sorry. And tau f of zero.
00:46:41.964 - 00:47:21.728, Speaker A: Tau inverse f of tau zero. Now, this is correct. And you divided by tau, prime of c. And in particular, if tau is rotation, then f tau is simply a rotation of our map. Okay, so these things will also appear in our discussions. And finally, the symmetry that you can map f to bar of f of z bar. So you reflect twice.
00:47:21.728 - 00:47:52.764, Speaker A: This is very easy. So this symmetry would map f to the reflected domain. So this is just conformal map to the reflected domain. And now with these preliminaries, we are ready to state yet another theorem of Kirby. And why don't I have his picture? So, yeah, his picture will appear in a second. Okay, so here is his picture. And the theorem is that s is compact in AfD.
00:47:52.764 - 00:48:57.908, Speaker A: So not just pre compact, compact. So this says that all the quantities that we have for functions on s value at specific point z derivative at the point z, quantities, ratios and all this, they are all bounded by constant, both from above and from below. So let us prove it. Okay, so first of all, this is closed by Horville theory. So remember, in Horvey's theorem, what could happen is that the limit of conformal maps could be a constant, but here it cannot be a constant because derivatives also converge. So limit of any sequence of Maps from s is back mf from s, because again, it has derivative one at zero. Now we need to establish normality.
00:48:57.908 - 00:49:56.376, Speaker A: So let us try to prove that this is normal. So by Schwarz Lemma, for every f in S, you can find two points which are not in f of d such that a of f is equal to one and b of f is equal to two. Okay, how do I know this? Because by Schwarz Lemma, if no such point would exist. So if any point of the disk of radius one would be in the image of the unit disk, then you look at the inverse map. The derivative of the inverse map would be strictly less than one by Schwarz lemma, so the derivative of Mapf would be strictly greater than one. That's, that's contradiction. Okay.
00:49:56.376 - 00:50:09.704, Speaker A: And then, now there is a big trick to discuss, which I will do after a ten minute break. Okay, so let me stop recording for now.
