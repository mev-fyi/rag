00:00:07.840 - 00:00:26.434, Speaker A: Welcome back, everybody. And so the next speaker is Turge Captainogloo from Bilkent University, and he will talk about shift operators on harmonic Hilbert's function spaces and van nequality.
00:00:28.884 - 00:00:59.282, Speaker B: Thank you. And thank you for the opportunity. I hope my voice is loud enough. Okay, I should have also said here phonomen inequality with harmonic polynomials. But anyway, we'll see during the talk. Okay, I'll start with the usual phone inequality in one dimension. First, if you have a contraction or a Hilbert space, and if you polynomial, usual polynomial, I mean hollow marker polynomial.
00:00:59.282 - 00:02:09.764, Speaker B: And then if we substitute in the operator t in place of the variable of the polynomial and obtain the operator, the norm of that is less than or equal to the supremum of polynomial on the unit disk. Well, of course, it is well known that the supreme here is actually equal to the norm of the shift operator or the multiplication operator by the polynomial on the hardest phase of the unit disk. And this equivalence actually allows for the generalization of this inequality to several variables. For that, one hard space is not good enough. We have to look at another space through re harvest space, let's call it by a. And it's a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. With reproducing kernel equal to this, you know, it reduces to the usual hard space when n is equal to one.
00:02:09.764 - 00:02:59.044, Speaker B: When we are working with the unit disk, but now we have the unit ball. It's a Hilbert space. Harmonic hormone polymer functions on the unit wall with this kernel. This is the inner product of Cn. And this theorem goes as follows. If you have a commuting tuple of operators, which is a row contraction, whatever row contraction is, we'll make it clear later on. Whenever space, and these are now polymer polynomial and complex variables, then the polynomial of the entropy, the norm of that is less than or equal to norm of the polynomial of the shift operators on the drillery arm space.
00:02:59.044 - 00:03:44.324, Speaker B: These are all well known. And after the work of Druyer and Arvason, the space got quite well known in operator theory. Now, our aim is actually to replace the polynomial in the last theorem with a harmonic polynomial rather than Holomon polynomial. Okay. And if for the proof to go on, we have to, we need several. We need to answer several questions, like what is the shift operator really? In holomorphic polymer functions, you just multiply by the coordinates variables. But that kind of multiplication does not preserve harmonicity.
00:03:44.324 - 00:04:31.964, Speaker B: We have to look at, we have to consider projections on harmonic spaces. And the next question would be, what is the equivalent of the durability space, we have to create a space out of the similarity between the holomorphic spaces and harmonic spaces. And also it turns out that later on, after you consider, we cannot really prove phone number inequality for general row contractions, and we have to reduce to a specific subclass of them. So let's answer these questions one by one. But it's going to take a quite a roundabout way. We have to look at spherical harmonics and global harmonics. These are building blocks of harmonic functions.
00:04:31.964 - 00:05:48.472, Speaker B: We look at homogeneous polynomials of degree m, called mpm, the harmonic subclass of them, and call them Hm. And if you look at the, if you restrict them to the sphere, the last ladder space, they are called spherical harmonics, okay? Because these are finite dimensional operating spaces, of course, and therefore any operator on them is bounded. So point evaluation is also a boundary near functional. And therefore the harmonic homogeneous polynomials of the gram is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Its reproducing kernel is with respect to the alto, inner product on the sphere is called the zonal harmonic, and sigma represents the surface measure. So this zm is a positive definite function, okay, this can be generalized to or extended to the unit ball by homogeneity. And the reproducing property of the zonal harmonics is this equality.
00:05:48.472 - 00:06:26.024, Speaker B: If use a harmonic homogeneous polynomial of degree m, then we recreate their values by multiplying by zm and integrating. There are a couple of inequalities like this. The ZMs are bounded above by the dimension of the space. Anyway, these are basic properties, and you can find them in the Axler Bourdin Raimi book. All these information come from there, actually. Of course, these are also classical. I mean, you can find them in further classical books as well.
00:06:26.024 - 00:07:23.774, Speaker B: There's an explicit formula for the zonal harmonics, which looks quite ugly and messy, but we will make use of it here. Am is the coefficient of the leading term, let's say, okay, we take, we write it in this form, which is we use make use of the pohamer symbol, which is a ratio to gamma. Functions do not turn out to be just as good as the exomes I'm defining here. Having a leading coefficient to one here makes things a little easier. But of course, this is not the only term. There are a lot of other terms here as well, coming from this sum here, and exams are bounded by one. That's a good thing to have.
00:07:23.774 - 00:08:15.656, Speaker B: In the holomorphic setting, the equivalent of this Xm is actually the inner product of z and w to the empty power it turns out, and these are up to a scalar multiple. These are the reproducing kernels of polymorphic homogeneous polynomials. Okay, we form this analogy. Okay, we have to define shift operators. We define them in a funny way. First, we just make note of this for the holomorphic, in the holomorphic setting, if we have this inner product, and if you differentiate it with respect to Wj conjugate, it's actually multiplication. It turns out to be multiplication by Zj.
00:08:15.656 - 00:09:12.584, Speaker B: And so we look at one higher dimensional dimension here, and this turns out to be a shift operator on the n dimensional reproducing kernel here. So we look at the, remember z ends are represent kernels, therefore xm. They're also represent kernel up constant multiple. So we take the xm plus one rather than xm differentiated with respect to the second variable, but multiply by a suitable constant and call it the shift operator. In the first variable. Sjs are assumed to be acting on x here, and we extend it by linearity and density of the xms to all of harmonic homogeneous polynomials like this. Oops.
00:09:12.584 - 00:10:28.914, Speaker B: Okay, we can further extend it later on. We will further extend later on using the fact that the l two space can actually be written as a direct sum of the HMS. Okay, so we will also make use of the inner product of the l two and we can obtain the adjoints of these shift operators like this. It turns out that adjoints are actually derivatives. This is the differentiation with respect to the jth variable. Maybe I should have written as explicit derivatives, but anyway, they are the derivatives like this, since the derivatives commute with each other sj stars and therefore the sj commute with each other. Okay, next we need to look at the projection onto the harmonic subspace from the polynomials harmonic, I mean, sorry, from the polynomials of degree harmonic.
00:10:28.914 - 00:11:17.834, Speaker B: Sorry. From the polynomials of homogeneous polynomials of degree m, we project down to the harmonic homogeneous polynomials of the gram from pm to hm. Okay, there's a formula for that. Again, I take this from the book by Aksir, Burdon and Raimi. Again, this is a complicated formula, but it works out pretty nice in practice. We replace the variable of the polynomial by the differential operator, apply the differential operator on a suitable function which is different for n equal to two and higher dimensions, and then apply the Kelvin transform. Kelvin transform is this transform.
00:11:17.834 - 00:11:58.162, Speaker B: Here it is a transform. It takes a function on in the unit disk and gives us a harmonic function on the exterior of the unit disk. It is very simple. When n is equal to two and on the unisphere, it's the identity operator and it's inverse, is itself function is harmonic if and only if it's Kelvin transport. With our mind, it's a useful tool. Okay, here's a major theorem. You know, shift operators should shift to a one higher dimensional harmonic space.
00:11:58.162 - 00:12:52.904, Speaker B: In fact, they do. I mean, the shift operators I defined here using this strange formula turns out to be, turns out to project, turns out to be multiplication by the coordinate variables and then projection onto the harmonic counterpart. Okay, so we take, they take harmonic homogeneous polynomials of degree m, two harmonic homogeneous polynomials of degree m plus one. Okay, in the, this is a, this term is pretty long. It's a very computational theorem. And, okay, it involves a lemma, which I'm not going to talk about at all, but it's this lemma that makes this theorem work out. But also this lemma gives us an interesting corollary.
00:12:52.904 - 00:13:48.204, Speaker B: It gives us a new identity, seemingly new identity, for the Gaganbauer polynomials. And Gagan power polynomials are no surprise because zonal harmonics are essentially Gaganbauer polynomials or ultra small variatal polynomials. But this identity seems to be new. I couldn't find it in standard references on special functions. For example, so the Gagambaur polynomial can be obtained from Kelvin transform. And an operator like this, when n is equal to two, instead of the Gagammar polynomials, we look at the Chebyshev polynomials, but that these two formulas are more or less equivalent. Okay, I should also define some harmonic Hilbert punching spaces, because I need an equivalent of drury harvesting space.
00:13:48.204 - 00:14:36.414, Speaker B: So by taking suitable beta amps, which guarantee that the series converges absolutely uniformly on complex subsets of the ball, we can define positive definite functions. You know, xms are essentially zonal harmonics. They are positive definite. And if I take positive coefficients and make an infinite sum like that, which is convergent, they turn out to be positive definite functions as well. Therefore, they define a replacing kernel Hilbert space. Every positive definite functions on the unit pole defines a new reproducing kernel hover space. And I call it script g beta.
00:14:36.414 - 00:16:12.364, Speaker B: And their norm and their inner product are related to the norm and inner product of l, two of the unit sphere like this, using all these new constants and polynomials, harmonic polynomials and linear combinations of the reproductive kernels are all dense in the, in every G script g beta space. Okay, looking at general beta is not good enough. You have to really look at a more specific coefficient sequence, okay, with, you know, this is a slightly generalized version of the reproducing kernel of the space when this power is one, it's the current of the durability. We can look at other like Hilbert Bergman spaces or hard space. By varying this power here, it is an expansion of this form. So, but in harmonic case, instead of this power here we have the x, we have the x ms, but instead of the beta m's here, we use the same beta m that come from the harmonic holomorphic counterpart. And of course, because complex dimensions are always even to look at the general rn, we divide by two.
00:16:12.364 - 00:16:53.070, Speaker B: And of course, we also have the extension to negative, deeply negative queues. So this is true for any q whatsoever. Okay, when the, when we look at these beta m's, we label the spaces gq and script gq, the kernels gq and the spaces script gq. Now, one q is very special. When q is equal to minus n over two, all these coefficients are one. And that happens actually here as well. When q is equal to minus n, the coefficients are here are always one, and that actually corresponds to the rearing space.
00:16:53.070 - 00:17:42.866, Speaker B: So when we take all the coefficients equal to one, this is the kernel we have. But there are other terms here. But this is the corresponding space is our candidate for the harmonic derivation space. And we label it with the g cop and script g cup. Okay, there's another family spaces that we considered earlier that contains the kernels. If I take different coefficient sequence, we can obtain the Poisson kernel and the corresponding space, the harmonic hard space, and also the Bergmann vessel spaces and the rishta space. But it turns out that this is a totally different family.
00:17:42.866 - 00:18:45.274, Speaker B: And in this talk, they are not of any interest to us. So I'm not going to spend much time on this. We can, different coefficient sequences give different interesting spaces. Okay, why these shifts or why are these spaces are more basic for operators in the other spaces are as follows. Okay. When we look at the shifts on the more specific spaces, not these, but these, okay, these are the ones that I'm going to be working on from now on. Okay? When I look at the candidate space for the space and look at the adjoint with respect to the norm and inner product of that space, I also obtain a formula like this.
00:18:45.274 - 00:19:42.532, Speaker B: And this formula turns out to be exactly the same formula used by alpine, Shapiro and Volok to define a backward shift. Well, a joint on a duration space in a quaternion setting. By the way, I forgot to tell at the very beginning, this is a talk. It's a joint work by Daniel Alpei. Okay, now for tuples of operators, I have a notation here, and it turns out that, well, it's a notation that is more important here. And I can do a lot of calculations like this. And when the coefficient sequence is special, which holds true for all the beta m's that depend on a queue, the shift operators are bounded.
00:19:42.532 - 00:20:57.014, Speaker B: And I can find, I can look at this combination here and obtain an explicit formula like that, which will be useful on the next slide. And in particular, if I look at the candidate space for duraiers and look at the candidate space for the derivative space and look at its shift operator, this combination turns out to be very simple, which is true for the shift on the, for the holomorphic period in space as well. Okay, I need to look at row contractions, which is the, this is basically a, okay, if t is a commuting tuple of operators on Hilbert space, a row contraction is really a contraction. As a tuple equivalent, a row contraction, t is a row contraction, if and only if. This combination, which I considered right here, actually for the shift operator, is actually a positive operator. And when this is positive, its square root is called defect operator by arvidstone. I follow the same steps here.
00:20:57.014 - 00:22:23.860, Speaker B: Defect operator for the shift on the candidate space for the derivative space is just something very simple. And the s betas are rho contractions when the beta m sequence is actually an increasing sequence, because we're trying to get the coefficient sequence here positive. And for the q space, when we look at the more these barams, in particular, we get positive operators here. Positive coefficient sequence here, when q is greater than or equal to minus n over two and the q equal to minus n over two is actually the candidate space for space. Okay, I have to still look at some maps on bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space. So these are operators on operators. This particular operator turned out to be proved to be useful in operator theory, in using holomorphic acting, I mean, operator theory for holomorphic function spaces, but we have harmonic function spaces.
00:22:23.860 - 00:23:34.500, Speaker B: And you see, when I look at the, when I use b equal to identity map, it turns out to be t, t to the power l. It sounds like the z inner product of z and w to the l power. And for the harmonic version of that, I go all the way back to the xsens and replace the z and w by tnt. Actually, I had this ugly formula for the zonal harmonics, but that turns out to be useful here. This is a harmonic version of this quantity, which is used more commonly on holomorphic function spaces. Okay, when b is equal to identity. This turns out to be taking the x end and replacing z by t and w by t on the other end.
00:23:34.500 - 00:24:25.632, Speaker B: This formula is too complicated to use, or this formula too complicated to use alone. I have to do a small restriction here. Now let's look at the s beta conjugate, dot it cell. It turns out that because the conjugates are derivatives, partial derivatives, if I apply partial derivative twice, I get the second order partial derivative added up. This is a Laplacian, actually. And if I use it on harmonic functions, that Laplacian obviously equal to zero. So when I have an operator tuple, and if it satisfies this identity, if this dot product turns out to be zero, I call it harmonic type, the operator tuple.
00:24:25.632 - 00:25:22.836, Speaker B: Equivalently, instead of working on the adjoint, we can work on the operator itself. Okay? Then this Vm operator, this operator simplifies. For a harmonic type operator, Vm turns out to be the same as Jm, the equivalent thing for the holomorphic version. Okay? And it turns out that if I were a contraction, and if I take empty, if I apply Vm to the identity operator and take m to infinity for a row contraction and harmonic type, it's same as the Jm of t. And this limit exists in a strong operator topology and satisfies this identity. When t infinity is zero. T is called pure.
00:25:22.836 - 00:26:32.644, Speaker B: These are standard definitions. And sq is pure when q is greater than or equal to this and minus n over three. This is exactly, actually, when it is a row contraction, same identity here. And with the s cup, we shift on the derivatives in space, we get a very simple, very simple identity here. Actually, in other spaces, the sum is not that simple, really. Okay, we have to pass from a tuple of operators, bounded operators on a Hilbert space, to the specific, the shift operator on the, actually, this shift operator on the dual ribosome type space, and this is a dilation type result. I'm not going to, it's very similar to the holomorphic version of this, but I'm not going to discuss it here.
00:26:32.644 - 00:27:16.594, Speaker B: We can actually have a version of this result here, the limit result for self regenerative operators as well. But I don't have a version of this for self adjoint operator tuples yet. Maybe we will have in the future. No, I'm sorry, I do have this one, but not the next one. Okay, this is my final result, final slide. Let me just discuss it. A norm one harmonic polynomial is called contractor.
00:27:16.594 - 00:28:01.564, Speaker B: If the shift operator is the row contraction of that. Okay, it's an. It has to be also a non drive from product that respects the orbit banality in the l two space. It turns out that the norm of the on the candidate is largest among all contractor norms on harmonic polynomials. And my final result is this. If t is a harmonic type row contraction, not just row contraction, but a harmonic type row contraction of Hilbert twice H. And if U is a harmonic polynomial, then I have the von Neumann inequality promised on the first slide.
00:28:01.564 - 00:28:23.184, Speaker B: And it turns out that the space here is not really related to the harmonic harder space. I don't know why, but it turns out to be that way. And I finished my references, and this talk is based on this red reference here. Thank you for your attention. I'll stop here.
00:28:25.004 - 00:28:31.744, Speaker A: Thanks the speaker. So, any question?
00:28:35.204 - 00:28:43.524, Speaker C: Thank you for a very nice talk. Very interesting results. Would you be willing to share your slides and deposit them in the chat box?
00:28:43.864 - 00:28:56.164, Speaker B: Okay, sure. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Is the field. Instead of sharing the slides, or. What is it again? Could you.
00:28:56.784 - 00:29:04.752, Speaker A: Yeah. In fact, you can share the slides with everyone in the chat. So if you go in the chat.
00:29:04.888 - 00:29:07.280, Speaker B: How do I do that? I don't know. Is it.
00:29:07.472 - 00:29:32.024, Speaker A: So, uh, at the bottom of your windows, you can see. In the middle of the bottom, you can see the chat. You have. You have a sheet where you can share your.
00:29:32.604 - 00:29:34.300, Speaker B: Okay, I don't know how to do it.
00:29:34.452 - 00:29:40.978, Speaker C: I think you have to click on. On the bottom of the chat, there's a little icon that looks like a file.
00:29:41.106 - 00:29:42.426, Speaker B: Okay. Okay, now. All right.
00:29:42.450 - 00:29:45.154, Speaker C: Now I click on that and then select the file.
00:29:45.314 - 00:29:47.314, Speaker B: Okay, I'm trying to do it.
00:29:47.354 - 00:29:50.614, Speaker C: Put it in the chat box, and we can all see it. Very nice.
00:29:52.114 - 00:30:02.814, Speaker B: Let's see. What is that? Okay, let's see.
00:30:04.014 - 00:30:27.942, Speaker C: While you're looking for that, let me just comment that it's interesting that the reproducing kernel for the harmonic Bergman space is considerably more complicated than the reproducing kernel for the analytic Bergman space. They both have explicit formulas, but it's just more complicated for the harmonic Bergman space. But it does become a little simpler if you express it in terms of the zonal harmonics.
00:30:28.118 - 00:30:44.510, Speaker B: Yes, it is simpler. The Bergman space thing is simpler. In fact, I took the Bergman space from your book. I mean, it's just when you write it in terms of those xms, it becomes more complicated.
00:30:44.662 - 00:30:45.394, Speaker C: Yes.
00:30:46.814 - 00:31:05.414, Speaker B: Here in this talk, I'm basing everything on XMS. Yes. That's why it looks more complicated. I'm still trying to find this file. I'm sorry for this. This is something I have not done before. Where is it? Really? I.
00:31:05.414 - 00:31:09.874, Speaker B: Oh, here it is. Okay.
00:31:09.994 - 00:31:11.234, Speaker A: Okay. It's okay.
00:31:11.394 - 00:31:12.682, Speaker B: Okay. I think that's the.
00:31:12.858 - 00:31:13.514, Speaker A: Yeah, got it.
00:31:13.554 - 00:31:14.570, Speaker C: Thank you so much.
00:31:14.722 - 00:31:46.994, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Any other question or comments? Okay, so I have just one naive question. In the analytic case, and in your harmonic case, you have a bound with the norm of the polynomial applicated to the shift.
00:31:47.574 - 00:31:49.074, Speaker B: That's what you mean.
00:31:49.654 - 00:32:01.454, Speaker A: Yeah. For example, but in the von Neman inequalities or the original one, you have this supremum of the polynomial.
00:32:02.034 - 00:32:49.158, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. Well, yeah, in one dimension, it turns out that, I mean, I don't remember the details of the proof right now, but the supremum is actually the norm of the polynomial of the shift operator. So, I mean, to the several variable versions, this doesn't generalize. I mean, you can it also for, I think, dimension two, but there are counter examples in dimension three or maybe four. I mean, so the, to generalize it to higher dimensions first considered shift operate, try to generalize this version here rather than subversion. And it worked out that way.
00:32:49.326 - 00:32:54.214, Speaker A: Okay. Okay, thank you. So the super version is not true in any dimension.
00:32:54.294 - 00:33:22.514, Speaker B: I think there's a counter example in dimension three. I mean, it's true for dimension two, but dimension three, it fails. And, you know, for harmonic functions, we need at least two variables. I don't think, I mean, I didn't try the subversion, actually, maybe I should try this. Whether the subversion is true in the harmonic setting. Also, I don't know, another idea for future research maybe.
00:33:23.334 - 00:33:24.274, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:33:24.894 - 00:33:25.794, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:33:26.534 - 00:33:35.074, Speaker A: Any other questions or comments? If not, let's thank the speaker again.
00:33:36.054 - 00:33:36.534, Speaker B: Thank you very.
