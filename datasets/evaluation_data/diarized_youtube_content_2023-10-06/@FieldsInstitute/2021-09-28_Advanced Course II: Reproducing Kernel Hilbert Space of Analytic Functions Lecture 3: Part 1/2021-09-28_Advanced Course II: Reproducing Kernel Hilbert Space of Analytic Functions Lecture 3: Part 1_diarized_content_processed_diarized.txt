00:00:04.240 - 00:00:08.794, Speaker A: We continue our set of examples by the Paleo venar space.
00:00:17.934 - 00:00:21.274, Speaker B: Javit, it looks to me like the wrong file was shared.
00:00:23.974 - 00:00:26.826, Speaker A: Let me see. Maybe I wrong.
00:00:26.890 - 00:00:31.014, Speaker B: I think you shared the handwritten one. I sent a typed one.
00:00:31.954 - 00:00:47.698, Speaker A: Okay, there is another one. Yes. Okay. There is another one in the break. I will look for it and share it again. That's the first one. There is a second one too.
00:00:47.698 - 00:00:48.370, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:00:48.482 - 00:00:50.554, Speaker B: I can post it if you want. If I can find it.
00:00:50.594 - 00:00:51.866, Speaker A: Yes, please. Please go.
00:00:52.010 - 00:00:53.850, Speaker B: Go ahead and try and do that, please.
00:00:53.922 - 00:01:31.252, Speaker A: Thank you. How I want to see my file. What's happened to. Okay, do you see the one note where I wrote the Paley winner space? Yes. Okay. That's a very nice space. Because we use several tools.
00:01:31.252 - 00:02:14.198, Speaker A: In this one, we need some knowledge of complex analysis and also some knowledge of Fourier analysis. And then it was a wonderful observation by Paley and winner. There is a theorem by them which I will mention. And this theorem is like a bridge between the two subjects and open the road even. They both have one book which precisely the same title. I mean, it's about Fourier analysis in complex domain and the theorem I will mention. It's just one of the many theorems they found.
00:02:14.198 - 00:03:26.706, Speaker A: And you will see, even with this theorem, we can get a lot. So, to prepare for that theorem, let's review some concepts from complex analysis and then from Fourier analysis. Complex analysis, we consider functions which are defined on a complex plane to see and holomorphic, so that these functions are are called entire. But we put a restriction on the growth of this function. I mean this, an entire function can go to infinity arbitrarily fast. The restriction we put is this one restriction. We assume that there are constants c and a such that absolute value of f of z is less than or equal to ce to the a absolute value of z for each z in c, or at least for large values of z.
00:03:26.706 - 00:04:20.522, Speaker A: The constant c is not that important. A is important. And that is why I said, if this is true for arbitrarily large values of z, then we can make another c which is bigger and for this bigger c. The inequality works everywhere. So our main concern is this a here, if a function satisfies this property, we call it a functional exponential type. Entire function of exponential type. Indeed, in your work before, for sure you have seen many such functions.
00:04:20.522 - 00:05:41.534, Speaker A: For example, f of z is equal to sine z or cosine z. In this way, it is not clear why it is of exponential type, but if you write it as e to the iz minus e to the minus iz divided by two I. You immediately see that f of z is less than or equal to e to the absolute value of z. So both c and a, you can, you can take it equal to one. And, well, if you will study the function on the real line, you see that this is not a good estimation, because on the real line f of z is bounded and our estimation is like e to the mod x. It goes very fast. But on the other hand, if you go on the imaginary axis, you see that f is equal to sine of iy or I sine hyperbolic y.
00:05:41.534 - 00:06:57.424, Speaker A: Or if you directly use this formula is e to the y minus e to the minus y divided by two. And you see that now, either in the positive direction or in the negative direction, it behaves precisely like e to the mod z. So the constant a here is optimal and we cannot do better than that. So this is an example of the entire function of exponential type. And this example also suggests that to, to look for the best value of a here, and this is called the type of a. So, definition, definition of type, we use sigma or sigma f, for this is the infimum over all a's, where a is the constant, which we use here. I can call it star a in star.
00:06:57.424 - 00:07:53.604, Speaker A: That's not a good way to write it, but you understand what I mean. The, in a sense it's, it's the best exponent that we can put over there. But you need to be very careful with the, if you pay attention to the meaning of infimo, this doesn't mean that there is a constant c such that mod f of z is less than or equal to c e to the sigma z. No, in general, no. Of course, if a function satisfies this, it is entire function of exponential type, type at most sigma. But if it is of type sigma, it doesn't mean that it satisfies this, this property. What we can say is that given any epsilon positive, now there is a c.
00:07:53.604 - 00:09:12.514, Speaker A: And if you wish, c, epsilon depends on epsilon such that f of z less than or equal to c e to the sigma plus epsilon mindset. This distinction is sometimes important and should be, I mean, keep keeping your mind for our application. Indeed, for our, the precise form of the paleo viner that we want to study. Uh, two, uh, you can call it semi type or two growth rate is also important for us. I call them sigma plus and sigma minus. And they are, uh, the, the rate of the growth of sigma on the positive imaginary axis and the negative imaginary axis indeed. Before giving the definition of sigma plus and sigma minus is a good point to give you an exercise.
00:09:12.514 - 00:09:49.894, Speaker A: And then you will see why I define sigma plus and sigma minus like that. So exercise how to find sigma. Uh, show that sigma is given by this formula. It's lim soup. Uh, z goes to infinity and that's the point. Z goes to infinity with no restriction on the direction and any direction it can go to infinity. A watt of a log of mod f z over modset.
00:09:49.894 - 00:11:29.064, Speaker A: This is the formula for the best exponent that we can use, and it gives us the type. Now I use this to give the definition of sigma plus and sigma minus, and it's almost the same definition. It instead of letting z go to infinity to any direction or any arbitrary manner that we like, I restrict it on z equal to iy and z equal to minus iy. So the first one is slim swoop y goes to plus infinity log of f iy over y, and the other one is limp swoop y goes to infinity log of f of minus iy over y. So can say in this direction and the other one is in this direction. The growth of f in post direction. You will see a little bit later why sigma plus and sigma minus come into picture.
00:11:29.064 - 00:12:37.356, Speaker A: While there is a whole theory very rich in the theory of entire function, in particular entire functional exponential type, I don't go into detail. You do not need more than that for the paleoline theorem. But if you are interested, there are many interesting books like the book by Boas, the book by Levin and many others, a very classical subject. The other one which is probably less familiar for some of the students is the Fourier analysis on R. This is usually a graduate course that we give in master or PhD level. It's called harmonic analysis and we studied this topic. And in particular I need the Planche rail theory which is a part of it.
00:12:37.356 - 00:13:59.874, Speaker A: Again, very briefly, I want to give you a course which is covered over one semester. So please be patient with what I write here. You start with a function f which is integrable on R. In L1 of R, I mean more explicitly integral of mod f dx is finite. And then we have the definition of the Fourier transform. Definition of Fourier transform is f hat of x defined by integral from minus infinity to infinity f of t e to the minus I two PI xt dt some comments here. The definition I used here I it's used in Polsonbut and also in the book by Elias Stein about Fourier analysis.
00:13:59.874 - 00:15:40.590, Speaker A: That's not the only way that we can define f hat in some other textbooks they define it. So you have to, I mean, bear with PI. Somewhere it appears some authors define it f of x equal to integral from minus infinity to infinity f of t e to the minus I x t dt. You do not see PI here, but when they show or they present the inverse formula, it is there some others to have a better formula for the parcel identity, they put one over two PI root square of two PI in front ft e to the minus x dvt. And to make the life more complicated even there are books in which f hat of x is defined one over two PI of the same things. So when you study any book on harmonic analysis, wavelet theory or the application, one of the first things that you have to verify is what is the definition of the Fourier transform? And the definition has some consequences. And if you compare two books, for example, you may see it today, even in a few minutes.
00:15:40.590 - 00:16:22.274, Speaker A: Indeed, you will see that in some books they write f inner product with g is equal to inner product of f hat and g hat. And in other books they write it is equal to one over two PI in a product. Both are correct. It depends what definition you adopt. So be careful with the definition is used. I like the definition that is used in pulse and or elias stain, which is mentioned here. It makes many formulas meter very clean.
00:16:22.274 - 00:17:19.126, Speaker A: So that's our definition. What we can say about f hat. This is again an easy exercise to show that f hat is a continuous and even more uniformly continuous function is uniformly continuous on r. That's, that's very easy. You just calculate f hato x minus f hato y and you put it inside and use this fact and the dominated convergence theorem to obtain the final result. This is really easy. What needs a little bit of more work is to show that, and this is called the Riemann lobelieml.
00:17:19.126 - 00:18:03.578, Speaker A: I don't need it in this. Still, I mentioned this. So it's Lima Lubeck lemma. It says that lim x tan goes to plus or minus infinity in both direction of f hat of x is equal to zero. That needs a bit of work. It's not that difficult to prove it, but you need some results from measured theory. For example, knowing that function of compact support are dense in L1, so you approximate f by something of compact support.
00:18:03.578 - 00:19:26.746, Speaker A: And then you continue. I don't need it in our studies today. But still, I mentioned another interesting formula, which I will need indeed. It is called the multiplication formula. It says that for every f and g in L, one of r integral from minus infinity plus infinity. Therefore, x g hat of x dx is equal to f hat x gx dx, even in one book, which I saw indeed two, three days ago, whose book was that? Instead of the multiplication formula they used, I mean, kind of nicer name, they call it change of roof formula. So you look, you can look at hat as a roof, and the roof is changed, it goes from f to g, or from g to f.
00:19:26.746 - 00:20:11.220, Speaker A: So we can call it change of roof formula too. And it is again an easy exercise, this one. First, note that there is no problem with both integrals, because here f is in L1 g hat is a bounded function, even though I did not mention here. But it is clear from the formula that f hat is a uniformly bounded function, and the same here. So both integrals are well defined. And if you plug the definition of g hat here and change the order of integration, which is justified. Piphobini tonelli theorem.
00:20:11.220 - 00:20:59.168, Speaker A: Then you obtain the other one. Let me, let me explain. This is not difficult to show. So a sketch of proof. Integral from minus infinity plus infinity f g hat of x dx is equal to integral from minus infinity plus infinity f. And for g hat, I write it this way, integral from minus infinity plus infinity g of t e to the minus I two PI xt dt and then dx. And now I change the order of integration.
00:20:59.168 - 00:22:08.370, Speaker A: I will show you why this is true, and this is an important identity. But y, we'll see momentarily. I can write it as minus infinity to plus infinity g of t and then integral of f of x e to the minus I two PI x t dx and then dt. In other words, I was able to change the order of the integration. And what remains is, I mean, this is integral from minus infinity to infinity g of t, and the other one is simply f hat of t. This is what I wanted to arrive at. And the reason, the reason I can do this, I can do this change of ordering is that if you put absolute value everywhere, what do you, what do you obtain integral from minus infinity.
00:22:08.370 - 00:23:03.592, Speaker A: I mean, it's not integral from minus infinity to plus infinity. Again, minus infinity to plus infinity, absolute value f of x g of t e to the minus I two PI xt. That's our function, which is a function of x and t dx dt. Everything is positive tonality or m tells us that this is equal to integral of f dx gt dt with absolute value finite. And so, if this is finite, then Fubini tells us that we can change the order of integration. Indeed, both of them are needed here. So it's a very simple identity to prove.
00:23:03.592 - 00:23:48.612, Speaker A: But on one hand it's a nice one. On the other hand, it's very useful. We'll see some applications of this in our discussion today. So up to now, it's for l one. Is there a formula for f in terms of f hat? The formula we have here gives f hat in terms of f. Probably you have seen a formula like this before. Integral from minus infinity to plus infinity f hat of t e to the I two PI x t tt.
00:23:48.612 - 00:24:17.332, Speaker A: The construction formula which is equal to f of x. Some comments here. First, the integral should be well defined. And if you take the absolute value here, absolute value of the exponential part is equal to one. What remains is absolute value of f hat. We saw that f hat is in l infinity. It's bounded, but not necessarily integrable.
00:24:17.332 - 00:25:15.694, Speaker A: So one thing we need to add here is that f hat is in l one. That's an assumption to add here. And secondly, when we do this integral, as in the case of the Fourier transform, the function that we obtain here is a continuous function, but f that we started with is not necessarily continuous. So the right interpretation of this identity is that it holds, but almost everywhere on r. In other words, the function that we started with at the very beginning. If f hat is in l one, the function is not far from being continuous, or even uniformly continuous. We can modify it on the set of measure zero and obtain something which is which is very nice.
00:25:15.694 - 00:26:40.660, Speaker A: So that's the inversion formula. But don't forget that we have an assumption, extra assumption on it, otherwise it has absolutely no meaning. So this is the beginning for the theory of Fourier analysis of Fourier transform on l one of are in the course I mentioned that we give at the graduate level. We start with Fourier series, indeed with l one of t, and either interpret t as the unit circle on the complex plane, or equivalent to that, the interval zero two PI finite interval. So that when we develop the Fourier series or Fourier analysis on l one, one good thing is that for other lp spaces, for p bigger than one, less than or equal to infinity, lp of t is inside l one of t. So when we develop a theory for l one, a priori, it works for lp two. We don't need to develop a separate theory.
00:26:40.660 - 00:27:04.432, Speaker A: For example, for l two, it's already done. But this is not the case for l one of r. These are not nested spaces. You can imagine, for example, the relation between l one and l two, like this. This is l one of r. This is l two of r. Of course, they have some intersection.
00:27:04.432 - 00:27:45.990, Speaker A: But there are functions which are in l one, not in l two, and vice versa. Function in l two which are not in l one. So, but we have developed the theory here. We have developed the Fourier analysis on l one, so it works on the intersection, too. What can we say about the function which are not in the intersection? And that is the very profound observation of Plancherel, which means the starting point of his theory. But that's the most important observation, and everything else comes after this one. Here is his observation.
00:27:45.990 - 00:28:53.614, Speaker A: Consider a function which is here f. So plancheural observation, or if you wish, fundamental observation, really fundamental. For each f in the intersection, f hat is also in l two over. And moreover, the norm of f in l two is equal to the norm of f hat in l two. Recall that when we are in l one, f hat is in l infinity. But here it maps this part into itself. It maps l two into l two.
00:28:53.614 - 00:30:08.188, Speaker A: And that's the most important part of his observation. And the rest comes pretty much automatically. The rest is work like this for any function f. I mean, not necessarily in the intersection. For example, for a function f here we know from measure theory, so fact, major theory. In a sense, this intersection, we can say that it is big. What do I mean by saying that this intersection is big? L1, intersection l one of r, intersection l two of r is dense in l two with respect to l two norm, and also in l one with respect to l one.
00:30:08.188 - 00:31:03.068, Speaker A: But what I need is just the first one is dense in l two of r. Of course, when I said in l two of r, it's not needed. But to emphasize with respect to. So, knowing this, we start with an arbitrary function f here. So let f be in l two. Then by the bowel observation, there is a sequence fn. Fn is in l one, intersection, l two, one property.
00:31:03.068 - 00:31:44.164, Speaker A: And the second property, fn, converges to f in l two. Norm. True. And. And so fn. Now we come back here knowing this, we see that fn hat, since fn converges to f in l two, we conclude that fn is l two. Cauchy.
00:31:44.164 - 00:32:21.676, Speaker A: Therefore, by, let me call this. I already used a star. Let me use this dag. By dag. Fn hat is also l two, Cauchy. And we know l two is complete. Therefore, there is a function, therefore l two is complete.
00:32:21.676 - 00:33:23.544, Speaker A: So there is a function g in l two, such that fn hat converges to g in l two. And now we define. Now we define f hat to bg. That's the way we define the Fourier transform on l two. Of course, there are some steps to be taken. One very immediate question which comes to our mind, is that why this limit g doesn't depend on the sequence we choose? Yes, it is true that there is a sequence which converges to f, but this sequence is not unique. There are other sequences in l two intersection l one which converge to f.
00:33:23.544 - 00:34:08.738, Speaker A: And when we take the hat, do we get the same function g? This is the case. I leave it again as an exercise. I said, I do not want to cover the course on harmonic analysis. Just give you a general picture of it. Yes, it goes to the same function. So I add here, g does not depend on the choice of fn. As long as fn is in l one, intersection l two, and converges to f, we obtain the same limit.
00:34:08.738 - 00:34:51.624, Speaker A: Otherwise the theory doesn't work. Otherwise, this definition I gave here is meaningless, because with different sequences, you have to obtain different limits. So f hat is not well defined. And also, if you write this identity for fn instead of f, normal fn. Also. Moreover, for each n, normal fn is norm two is equal to normal fn hat two. And now let n goes to infinity.
00:34:51.624 - 00:35:54.828, Speaker A: We know that fn goes to f. So this one goes to the normal f in l two, equal to. And this one goes to the norm of g, which we called it f hat. So in other words, the Fourier transform is an isometry on l two, one and two over. Well, you can look at, up to here, you can look at the Fourier transform like this. I mean, this is our l two, l two. From l two, we know that it maps l two into l two in one to one and isometric manner.
00:35:54.828 - 00:37:04.294, Speaker A: But is it possible that we miss some part of l two? For example, it maps it into here, but there is a part which are not mapped into it. And again, this is excluded. And the reason is that if you look at the formulas we had before for f and f, this one for the inverse transform, and the one for transform, they work in l two with the right interpretation. I will explain what the right interpretation means. And if you, you repeat these two eyes, because now when you have f in l two, you can take the transform f hat, it stays in l two. So you can go ahead and do two transform another time. The second time you apply the Fourier transform, still it stays in l two.
00:37:04.294 - 00:37:36.916, Speaker A: And you can go, I mean, as many times as you wish. Note that in l one we cannot do that, because when we are in l one, f in l one. F hat is in l infinity. We cannot continue. But here we can continue. It seems at the very beginning we have a chain, but the chain very rapidly turns into a loop. And the reason is that, based on the inversion formula that I just showed you, it was here.
00:37:36.916 - 00:38:21.974, Speaker A: It was here. You immediately see that if you apply two wise, the Fourier transform f hat hat of x is equal to f minus x. And I mean, putting hats over hat is not that interesting. Sometimes, instead of hat, they use f like this for the Fourier transform. So if you apply two ice Fourier transform of f at point x, you obtain f of minus x. So you apply it two more times. You see that f four is equal to the identity.
00:38:21.974 - 00:39:02.994, Speaker A: In other words, the Fourier transform is invertible and its inverse is f three, three times. And so something like this is. No English, no, not french, no. Uh. So, uh, our Fourier Fourier transformer transform is more than being an isometry. It's a surjective isometry. So f is onto being, uh, isometric and also onto, uh.
00:39:02.994 - 00:40:01.954, Speaker A: In short, conclusion, f is a unitary operator on l two. Or this is the most beautiful possibility that we can have. And this is not true. For on L1, on l two, we have a very nice structure. We have something which is one to one unto, and moreover, isometric. To finish this part, let me explain what I mean by this. In some, in many books, indeed, they write, if f is in l two, then f hat of x is defined by the formula that we saw before, f of t e to the minus I two PI xt dt.
00:40:01.954 - 00:40:43.342, Speaker A: This is for a specialist. You have to understand what this means. If you look at this from I, from measure theory, it doesn't make sense because f is in l two. If you put absolute value here, you obtain absolute value of f. Absolute value of the exponential is one. And possibly, possibly, this is plus infinity. So if it is easy to provide function in l two, for which the integral explode is not in l one.
00:40:43.342 - 00:41:39.242, Speaker A: And so what is the meaning of this? We go back to the definition of l two. We said that you choose a sequence in the intersection of l one and l two, which goes to f. One of the possibility, not the only possibility, one of them is to chop, is to consider a function fm, which is equal to f. Say x is less than or equal to m and zero bigger than. That's a chopping in the domain. So, in other words, our function could be like this. We consider m here and minus m there.
00:41:39.242 - 00:42:17.484, Speaker A: We keep this part, and then the rest, we put it equal to zero. That's chopping on the domain. Sometimes we also need to have functions which are bounded. So if, if that is needed two, we can chop on the y axis too. We consider a big n here. Here is minus n and here is our n. If the function goes above this, we chop here to, and I mean, put it equal to n here, and the same for minus n.
00:42:17.484 - 00:43:25.654, Speaker A: But for the time being, suppose that I chop just on the on the x axis, so I don't enter into this now. And this function fm is in l one intersection l two, and fm goes to f in l two law. Then m goes to infinity. Therefore, based on the plancheural theory, Plancherelle theory, fm hat goes to f hat in l two. But what is fm hat? Fm hat. We know precise formula for it, because it is in l one fm hat of x is equal to integral from minus infinity infinity. The original definition fm of t e to the minus I two PI xt dt.
00:43:25.654 - 00:44:29.794, Speaker A: And then, because of the way we chopped, it's integral from minus m to m f of t e minus I two PI x t dt. That's fm hat. And this goes to f hat that. A better way is to write like this. F hat of x is lim, which means limit in the mean or limiting l two of f hat. F m hat of x or limb in mean integral minus m to m f of t e to the minus I two PI x t dt. That's the correct way, or more precise way of writing this.
00:44:29.794 - 00:45:17.460, Speaker A: That's at the beginning. But I mean mostly, I mean, the specialists forget about this precise way of writing, lean in mean and they simply write f hat of x equal to integral from minus infinity to infinity. So you should keep in mind what, what this means. This means a limit is hidden here in this formula. And the same for its inversion. I mean, f of x equal to integral minus infinity plus infinity f hat of t e to the I two PI x t dt. It has precisely the same meaning as before.
00:45:17.460 - 00:46:28.354, Speaker A: This is a limit in l two limit in min. If you keep this in mind, everything goes well. Another consequence of indeed, I mean, I should go at the very beginning, so I stay here. You remember the multiplication formula, or the change of roof formula, which was for l one. So I repeat the formula here. Multiplication. It was integral from minus infinity plus infinity f of x g hat of x dx equal to integral from minus infinity to plus infinity change of the roof x dx for every f and g in l one.
00:46:28.354 - 00:47:54.124, Speaker A: So in particular, you can pick, you can pick if you start with f and g in l two of r, you can pick fn is in l one intersection l two. F n goes to f in l two and the same for g g n in l one intersection g two. Gn goes to g in l two. And this formula is working for fn and gn. And then let n go to infinity. When n goes to infinity, we know that when fn goes to f, as a consequence, consequence of this, fn hat also goes to f hat in l two, the same for gn hat. So from this, by taking a limit, we immediately the same formula works, but this time, change of the hat, change of the roof formula this times for all f and g in l two.
00:47:54.124 - 00:48:38.582, Speaker A: And again by. There is no problem with the integrals, because on the left side, for example, f and g hat both are in l two. By Cauchy Schwartz, f times g hat is in l one, the same for for the right side. So absolutely, absolutely no problem. What is the consequence of this, which I need after the break, is instead of g. Here, this works for all f and g and l two. Instead of g, write g hat.
00:48:38.582 - 00:49:18.752, Speaker A: So it becomes f g hat hat twice. And here it will be f hat g hat. And we saw that g hat hat twice is g of minus x. So it will become integral f of x. G of minus x dx is equal to integral from minus infinity plus infinity f hat of x g hat of x dx. Again, this is by itself an interesting identity which works in l two. We cannot do this in l one.
00:49:18.752 - 00:50:16.650, Speaker A: What I did, I simply replaced g here by g hat and obtain this. And if you want to go one step further, if you don't like g minus x on the left side, still, it is possible to replace it by by g of x, or call it a function, an ise formula. Define h of x to be g of minus x bar. This is better. And you see that this formula immediately transforms to integral from minus infinity infinity and f of x h of x bar dx equal to integral minus infinity plus infinity f hat of x h hat of x bar dx. It's more symmetric this way. If.
00:50:16.650 - 00:51:32.924, Speaker A: If you define this change of function, and that's the parcel one version of parcel identity, usually we write it as f h inner product in l two is the same as f hat h hat inner product in l two. And if f is equal to g, we saw it before. Indeed, that's one way to arrive into this identity. Another one is to start from this and use the polarization identity to give the previous one. These two are equivalent so it depends which way you want to adopt. But at the end of the day we have something symmetric and very interesting and it plays an important role in our application. After the break, any question up to now? Well, if, if not, let's see what is in the chat.
00:51:32.924 - 00:52:05.344, Speaker A: Okay. There is a book by Sheldon, very interesting one and the link is provided in the chat. I think it's for free too, that you can download. It was one of the springer offers to the students and researcher. So is it true, Sheldon, that the book is for free now?
00:52:05.724 - 00:52:14.852, Speaker B: Yes, the electronic version is in. It's an open access book so the electronic version is legally free. So feel free to download it.
00:52:15.028 - 00:52:34.764, Speaker A: Sure. And all discuss here the l one theory and the two theory is there. Everything is there and you can go and see the details of it. Thanks again, chairman. So we have a break now, a break of about ten minutes and we come back.
