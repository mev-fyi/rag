00:00:00.840 - 00:00:22.394, Speaker A: Okay, good morning, good afternoon. Good evening, everybody. Welcome to week twelve, our focus program, and we start with lectures of Isabel Shalanda on discrete and continuous semi groups of composition operators. Isa, please.
00:00:24.254 - 00:02:25.524, Speaker B: Many thanks, Levat, many thanks for this invitation, and many thanks to the people, very courageous, who are behind their screen today. So, first, I will present a sort of introduction and motivation for studying composition operators on the only space h two. So, in the fifties, Rota introduced the notion of universal operator. Okay, and here is the definition. So we are in the context of complex and separable Hilbert space. And the definition, I will put it in green in this course. So, a u which is linear and bounded on h is universal.
00:02:25.524 - 00:04:45.254, Speaker B: If for all t linear and bounded on h, we can find a closed subspace m of h and not zero, and provided that t is not the zero operator, and lambda a constant which is not zero, such that the restriction of u, so m is also invariant by u. So, um, is in m, and the restriction of u to this closer space is equal to is, in fact is similar to lambda times t. So it's equal to an isomorphism denoted by a j, where j is from m to h is an isomorphism. So in other words, the u versitic to n is similar to a constant times t. So in other words, it means that u is a kind of model for all tea. So at first glance, such operators may be very difficult to find, but actually it's not the case. There are many universal operators.
00:04:45.254 - 00:06:01.674, Speaker B: So there are many such operators. And to be convinced of that, we have a theorem due to carrados. So theorem will be in red. So it's an old result in the fifties. Can I just prove that if u satisfies the two following conditions, namely the dimension of the kernel of, uh, is infinite, and this is in fact a necessary condition. And provided that u is subjective, this is not necessary. So we can find other criteria.
00:06:01.674 - 00:07:01.204, Speaker B: But at least with this criteria, the proof is easy. So provided you have those two hypotheses, then u is universal. So it's quite surprising that, okay, it's hypotheses which are not so difficult to satisfy. And then you get a model for all the linear unbounded operator on a clever space which is complex and separable. Okay, we will do the proof, because it's a course. So I thought I should do some proofs with all the details. So, let's k be the kernel of u.
00:07:01.204 - 00:08:53.883, Speaker B: Then we have the composition of h, like that, the kernel and the kernel probe. So with our notation, it's k direct sum. It's orthogonal. And then when we look at u tilde defined to be the restriction of u to k perb, which is invariant by definition. This is a bijection from k verb onto h, since u is supposed to be subjective. Now let v be defined to be u tilde minus one. So from h to k third, and let w from h to k be an isometric isomorphism because all the infinite dimensional superb hill space are isometrically isomorphic.
00:08:53.883 - 00:11:14.674, Speaker B: So observe that in this case what we have is that uv is equal to the identity and uw is equal to zero by construction. Okay, now what we do is that we pick lambda such that the modulus of lambda, the lambda in c, not zero such that the modulus of lambda times the norm of v, the norm of t is strictly less than one. And define j as follows. So j is equal to the sum infinite sum of lambda to the k v k w t k. Thanks to this hypothesis, this converges in norm and we can separate the terms for k equal to zero. That is, j is in fact equal to w plus lambda v jt. Okay, once we have this trick, we observe that then uj is equal to uw plus lambda v jt, and this is in fact equal to lambda jt.
00:11:14.674 - 00:12:41.884, Speaker B: Since construction, uw is equal to zero and uv is equal to the identity. Okay, so now the norm of j minus w is in fact equal to the modulus of lambda norm of v j t, which is strictly less than one and w is inosymmetry. Okay, so this is an isometry of norm one and this is strictly less than one. So it implies that in fact j is bounded below. So we can find an alpha such that the norm of j of x is greater than alpha, the norm of x. So j is bounded below. It means that it's injective and close branch.
00:12:41.884 - 00:13:34.984, Speaker B: So finally, j, defined from h to its image, which is closed, is an isomorphism. And we have found half of space m and j. Do the job. That's the job. Okay, so as you see, it's a quite easy proof. We have a trick which is very nice, which consists in considering this series. Okay, so why is it interesting? So from this we get the following proposition.
00:13:34.984 - 00:16:36.474, Speaker B: Let you in l be a universal orator. So if all the minimal for the inclusion invariance space I out u and not reduced to zero r of finite dimension, then every t would have invariance of space, non trivial invariance of space, a non trivial invariant subspace. And if one minimal invariant space of this universal is infinite dimensional than we have found. We have found a t which will be t is in fact u restricted to this m is similar to lambda t, where lambda is not zero. And we have found a t with no invariance of space, with no non trivial invariant space. Okay, so this proposition, if you have never seen that, it takes a few minutes to understand what it means, but it's an obvious scolary of the concept of universal operator. And so it means that studying the universal operators is a way to attack the famous open problem, which is the invariant space problem.
00:16:36.474 - 00:18:24.094, Speaker B: And the link with composition operators and semi group of composition operators is coming. Now we consider now the application from d to d defined by phi of r equal to z plus r over one plus rz, where r is between zero and one. So such application is an automobile of the open unit disk, which is called a hyperbolic because it has two fixed points which are one and minus one. So hyperblade means that you have two distinct fixed points under boundary, which are those ones. And now we consider the composition operators defined on the hardest base h two. So, which is isometric to h two of the unit circle. Okay, h two, just remind you that it's the sum of the anzn where the an are in l two.
00:18:24.094 - 00:19:35.744, Speaker B: Okay. And we look at the composition c phi r. Define on h two, taking values in h two. And. Okay, thanks to the little theorem, we have this. We have something which is not so obvious. We can prove that c phi applied to h two is still in h two.
00:19:35.744 - 00:20:26.644, Speaker B: Indeed, this phenomenon is true for any phi. Well, in fact, for all phi, which are allomatic. It is true that the composition on h two is still in h two. Okay, it's not obvious from the definition of h two. There is a trick, but I think it's, most of the people here are quite familiar with that. So I will not give the details of the proof. Okay, so we had that.
00:20:26.644 - 00:22:13.704, Speaker B: Let's keep the proof. And another remark which is very useful is that in fact such composition on the h two is linear and bounded. In fact, the linearity is obvious, but it's also bounded. And this allows from the closed graph theorem and the fact that c phi of h two is included in h two. So this is a consequence of the closed graph theorem that we can apply, because in fact h two is inject continuously in the set of allomatic function on d. It means that for any point in d, the evaluation is continuous. Okay.
00:22:13.704 - 00:23:59.094, Speaker B: Okay. So we have a linear unbounded operator on h two, and it happens that c phi r minus identity satisfies the hypothesis of carrados theorem. Okay, it's not obvious that it is the case. It was proved first by Noughen, Rosenthal and Wintrop in 97. And the key of the proof of their proof, because there was another one given by Eva Gallardo and in a joint by way of Carl Cohen, with another approach, using same groups of tablets operators. But so, this proof relies on the fact that they construct. Uh, sorry, problem with my.
00:23:59.094 - 00:25:40.534, Speaker B: Okay. Um. They consider the composition of the space h two with model spaces, kb, direction a kb, and so on, where b is the plasky product associated with phi n, sorry, phi, and at zero with the notation this is phi compose n times with itself. So it happens that this is, in fact, interpolation sequence. So in particular, a Blaschki sequence. Then you construct the Blaschke product associated with that. And then you consider the kb, which is in fact h two minus ph two.
00:25:40.534 - 00:27:33.704, Speaker B: And then you can prove that c phi, the composition is minus identity, is, in fact, similar to weighted shift on this with each component in this decomposition. So, there are many other tools to get to the conclusion that this operator c identity satisfies the hypothesis of carado's theorem. Okay, and just note that the invariant spaces of this guy and c fire are the same. So, regarding the problem of invariant spaces, it's equivalent to study c five r. Okay, so there were. So, the big challenge is to understand c five r, so invariant, and not all the invariant, but the minimal invariant subspace of C far r. So, it happens to be quite difficult problem.
00:27:33.704 - 00:29:15.534, Speaker B: And there were many others who obtained some contribution. I would like to talk about valentin matage, Raymond Martigny, but also the joint work of Eva Gallardo. And together with Pamela Gorkin, they were interested in the invariant spaces of fisc one generated by a function. And they obtain conditions on the regularity of the function at one and minus one, which are precisely the point where phi is as fixed point. And they obtain condition to get. To guarantee that the span of condition on f, to guarantee that the span of C far r and f, and you take the closure, is not minimal. Okay, so it's not the end of the story.
00:29:15.534 - 00:30:51.094, Speaker B: Otherwise you would have. That would be a big event to explain the solution of the invariance of space problem coming from this description of minimal invariance spaces of c phi r. So, that's the way I was interested in composition operators. It's related to a big problem in operator theory. And moreover, it happens that c phi r can be embedded in the semi groups, and in fact in the groups. So this operator is also injecting for the following, from the following point of view, phi l is in fact equal. For a well chosen t, it's the same as z plus one minus e minus t over one plus exponential minus t the same, which is denoted naive by phi t for an appropriate t.
00:30:51.094 - 00:32:24.384, Speaker B: Okay? So just solve this equation, okay? And if you see fine error like that, note that phi t plus s is phi t composed with phi s. Phi zero is the identity. And moreover, for all z, the mapping from t to phi t of z is continuous. Okay, so it happens that the composition by c phi t is a semigroup of operators on the hardest base h two. Okay? In fact, it's a group, because phi t is invertible. In fact, it's even more it is a group. So, it's time to give definition of the semi group of separators.
00:32:24.384 - 00:35:10.156, Speaker B: We define the notion of c zero semi groups of composition operators. Okay? So a semi group, which is not necessarily c zero. So we say that a family like that indexes by r plus. And here we take the banner space and we take linear embedded operators, is a semigroup if we have the following algebraic condition, or all snt positive, and we say that it's a c zero semigroup, is a c zero semigroup if moreover, or we say also strongly continuous semgroup. If moreover, we had a topological condition, that is, for any x, the limit when t tends to zero is x. Okay? Which is equivalent to say that for any x, the application from t to tt of x is continuous. Okay? And in this case, it's a nice context, because when we have semigroup, we have a generator.
00:35:10.156 - 00:36:48.164, Speaker B: And in the case where we have a c zero semigroup, the generator is densely defined. So then if tt is a c zero semigroup, we consider d of a to be the vector for which the limit of tt such that this limit exists. And we consider a to be equal to this limit if x is in the domain. And because we have a c zero semi group, it happens that p of a is dense mix. And moreover, when we have two semi groups, they are identical. They are the same even only if the generator is the same. So the generator characterizes completely c zero semigroups.
00:36:48.164 - 00:39:31.754, Speaker B: And the generator, if you look at definition, it's data at zero in some way. So the aim of the talk today is to look at the asymptotic behavior of the equation we start with today is try to characterize the asymptotic behavior. So it means 20 tends to infinity of this in terms of its generator. So, can you read on the generator the asymptotic behavior when t tends to infinity of t of t. So in the most general context, it's not. There is no, no easy answer, but we will restrict ourselves to the following context. So in the cycle, we will consider x balance phase, which embeds continuously in all dark the set of functions from d to c which are allomorphic.
00:39:31.754 - 00:41:24.214, Speaker B: I already mentioned that, but I write it again. It means that for all point in D, the evaluation is continuous. So regarding the topology on x. So this condition is very natural, since when we have the convergence in x, we have the convergence in the fresh space od, since provided we have. So when we had this limit, it implies automatically that for all k compact in D, the norm, the infinity norm of k of fn minus f k tends to zero. So this topology is compatible with the topology on the fleshy space, which is characterized by the uniform convergence on every compact subset of D. Okay, so we work with bonus space for which we have this.
00:41:24.214 - 00:43:17.964, Speaker B: Moreover, we consider analytics semifluent D. So I will precise what it is. It's something we the definition is, as previously, we have the identity mathematical. All the phi t are from d to d, and they are allomorphic or analytic. And we have this for all s and t greater than zero, and an extra topological condition, which is that for all seed, the application t to it of seed is continuous on r plus. Okay, now we assume, we assume, moreover, because it's not something which is obvious, we assume that phi t of x is when we compose phi t with the function x. No, sorry, c phi t of x.
00:43:17.964 - 00:44:25.024, Speaker B: So we assume that once we compose with phi t, if f is in x is composed, this composition is still in x. And what I have mentioned previously is that this is true. Oh, sorry. I have seen something in discussion. Okay, so there is a question from Paul Gauthier. It's about the definition of the generator. So we consider a subspace of x, that is the vector for which this limit exists.
00:44:25.024 - 00:45:15.494, Speaker B: And for certain, x a is defined because we have c zero semicroups. It happens, but it's not. I didn't, I haven't, I haven't done the proof. It happens that this subspace is dense in x, but this is a consequence of having a c zero, of having this topological condition. Okay, so the generator is the couple ada. It's well defined. This domain is precisely the biggest phase on which this limit exists.
00:45:15.494 - 00:46:32.824, Speaker B: So it's densely defined and bounded in general, it's not a bounded operator. That's the problem. Okay, so assume that we have a special banner space satisfying this condition. I have mentioned that using little wood subordination principle, which I didn't prove, but just trust me, this is true. For example, for x equal to h two and many other species. But it's not true in general. I will mention, okay, there is no, there are some spaces for which you, you can't apply any such subordination principle, but at least for our favorite hill of space, this is the case.
00:46:32.824 - 00:49:25.374, Speaker B: And then when you have a semi flow, you can consider c five t, which is, it happens that because we have taken banner space, which embeds continuously in the fresh space, because we have f composed with phi t in x. For f in x, using the closed graph theorem, it sits, it is automatic that c phi t is now linear and bounded, okay? And automatically, because we here we have a semi flow, it happens that c phi t is a semigroup or any banner space with our property. Okay, but we would like more, because we would like the existence of a generator densely defined, which contains all the information about the semigroup. So in other words, we would like more of an semigroup, would like c zero semigroup. And here is a lemma, which provides sufficient conditions to get a c zero semi group, which provides sufficient conditions to get a c zero semicolon. Assume that hex band of space. Assume that tt is a semi group on x.
00:49:25.374 - 00:51:47.784, Speaker B: So rx embeds in all the assume that the polynomials are dense in x, and assume moreover, that the norm of tt or t smooth here is uniformly bounded. That is, assume that we can find a delta such that the soup of the norm of ct is bounded. Then our equivalent, the fact that tt is a c zero semigroup, and the fact that you just need to check it on z to the n. That is, it's enough to prove that distance to zero for om, where en equal to z to the n. Okay, that's the way we can prove that, provided we have a semi flow on h two of d. The composition operators, which are well defined on h two, are in fact c zero semi group, because so that's exactly what we do in many cases to check that we have a c zero semigroup. Okay, the proof, the proof is just obvious.
00:51:47.784 - 00:53:20.410, Speaker B: I write it rapidly. So a implies b is obvious, follows from the definition. And the other one is not difficult. It just the method to check that this norm is bounded by ttf my t t times the polynomial, and we take a polynomial close enough to f in the cycle plus ttp, b plus f minus p. Okay. And for t small enough, here you have the soup of tt plus one times the norm of f minus p plus ttp minus p. If t is small enough, if t is less than delta, you have this.
00:53:20.410 - 00:53:56.704, Speaker B: And now you use the density of the polynomial. And so this is small. This can be small by a and this is small by b. Okay. And in the case of. I just need to. I will just finish this with a our examples and tomorrow we will go further.
00:53:56.704 - 00:55:55.116, Speaker B: When we have the Honda space and tt is the composition by semiflow, it works very well, because we have, we can prove that c phi t, the norm, is in fact bounded by one plus phi, t at zero over one minus phi, t of zero, one over two. And because phi t of zero tends to zero, as t tends to zero, you can see that we have a uniform bound for the norm of c phi t. And moreover, the polynomial dense. So we have, we have everything. And moreover, when we look at phi t n, which is in fact tte n minus en, when you look at the very definition, just an integral, and using the dominated convergence theorem, extends to zero. So here you have, we have seen in detail why the way we can prove that we have c zero. Semicroups.
00:55:55.116 - 00:56:21.434, Speaker B: Each time you have a control of the norm or t small of the family, and each time you can use the dominated convergence theorem. So each time you have a definition of space, considering based on integral and the density of the polynomial, you will get a c zero. Sin groups. Okay, maybe I should stop now. Sorry for being a little longer.
00:56:22.774 - 00:56:42.964, Speaker A: Thanks a lot, Isa. Let's. Thanks to speaker first. Any question or comments for Isabel? I have one comment in the proof you, you gave. I mean, if you go up a little bit.
00:56:43.264 - 00:56:44.084, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:45.664 - 00:57:06.064, Speaker A: I mean. Yes, here, precisely here. I think f minus p small is not by a, is by assumption. It's this. It's the assumption that the polynomials are dense in, because we want to prove it.
00:57:08.124 - 00:57:16.904, Speaker B: Sorry. Oh, yes, sorry. Sorry. Okay. Yes, absolutely. It's my assumption. So.
00:57:16.904 - 00:57:27.094, Speaker B: Okay. Sorry. I. Yes, you're right. So it's the density of the polynomial. It's not a at all. Sorry.
00:57:28.954 - 00:57:45.054, Speaker A: Indeed. My main question is that, I mean, usually we stick to polynomials because we are on the open unit test. But is there, I mean, in research article, other sets which are dense, have they been considered not just polynomials?
00:57:53.094 - 00:57:57.486, Speaker B: Yes, I think you mean if you, you have other spaces which are not.
00:57:57.510 - 00:58:04.994, Speaker A: Polynomial, then yeah, the theorem is true. If we, instead of polynomials, we consider something else. Which is dense.
00:58:05.294 - 00:58:07.878, Speaker B: Yes. And provided. Yes, yes, of course.
00:58:08.046 - 00:58:19.180, Speaker A: And I'm just wondering in application I haven't seen. Have you seen in application applications where you have something else which is dense.
00:58:19.292 - 00:59:07.994, Speaker B: Without the density of the polynomial? Well, the problem that the examples I have in mind. That's the thing I wanted to. I will start to mention tomorrow morning. Okay, great. That there are very natural spaces such that h infinity or blow spaces or. Recently Eva Jacobovich and Siskakis proved that for any banner space between h infinity and blur space, you have no c zero semi group. But in both cases they are much bigger and you lose the density of the polynomial.
00:59:07.994 - 00:59:12.414, Speaker B: So I have no.
00:59:15.394 - 00:59:30.014, Speaker A: Well, thanks a lot. Sorry. We are close to the next talk, so if there is any question, you can directly ask Isabel or wait until tomorrow. Let's thank the speaker again.
00:59:30.314 - 00:59:30.794, Speaker B: Thank you.
