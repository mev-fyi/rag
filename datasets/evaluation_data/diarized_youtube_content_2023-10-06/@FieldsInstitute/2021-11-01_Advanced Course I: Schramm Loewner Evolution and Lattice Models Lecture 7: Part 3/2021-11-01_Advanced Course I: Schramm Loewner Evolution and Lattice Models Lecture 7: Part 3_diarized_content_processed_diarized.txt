00:00:01.760 - 00:01:15.758, Speaker A: Okay, welcome back. So here we are now establishing this corollary that the stochastic integral can be defined as the limit of Riemann sums. Proof is very easy. Now, all we do, we consider the step functions, which are just, you know, we cut our process and take the values. Then, of course, by continuity, kn k tends to 0.5. Now, what bounces it? Well, that's easy. Let's just take maximum of our process ks up to time t and denote this by hT.
00:01:15.758 - 00:01:56.234, Speaker A: This is absolutely progressively bounded process which bounds is from above. So this integral of KNDM tends to convergence to integral of. Well, I should write km dx. Sorry, the integral of KM Dx. Let's write k. On one hand, this integral converges to this. On the other hand, we already computed this integral.
00:01:56.234 - 00:03:03.284, Speaker A: This is just the Riemann sum, end of story. So we have our Riemann sum representations, and that's actually the standard definition of the integral. So usually, if you look any financial mathematics textbook, for example, that's how they would define it integral. But then, of course, there is a great question why the limit exists in probability. And that's why we already build it up. The limit is actually unique process which satisfy this duality. Okay, so now, the main thing which people usually know about calculus is, is eta integral formula.
00:03:03.284 - 00:04:18.874, Speaker A: And the motivation for what would happen next is this and kind of explanation. And the main point of the proof is the following formula for stochastic integration by parts, which is, well, sometimes called pre eta formula. And you'll see an unusual thing here. So, okay, let x and y be continuous semi martingales. So again, local Martingale plus the process of bound deferation. Then x t y t is equal to x naught y naught plus the integral from zero to t xs d y s plus integral from zero to t y d x s. That's no standard integration by parts, right? But then there is an x return quadratic variation of x and y.
00:04:18.874 - 00:05:18.804, Speaker A: So, in particular, if you take x equal to y, what would happen? Let's see, this is x t squared is equal to x naught squared plus y is integral x s dxs continuous with respect to. Sam Martingale can do it. Plus quadratic variation of xt. And sub example to this is that, of course, the integral of brownian motion with respect to itself is nothing more than our old friend bt squared minus t, as we know this. Martin. Okay, so this is a statement. Again, an unusual part here is that you also have to add quadratic variation.
00:05:18.804 - 00:06:01.184, Speaker A: Why is it logical? Forget about semi martingale. Think about local Martin. Now let's try to look at this picture. This is not quite a local Martingale, right? The product of two local martingales is not local Martingale. On the other hand, by definition, if y and x are local martingales, integrals with respect to them are gain local martingales. So this whole thing is a local martingale. This is not.
00:06:01.184 - 00:07:14.464, Speaker A: But do you remember what makes this product a local martingale? Of course, subtraction of exactly the correlation, the quadratic correlation. So that's one of the reasons why this appears here. Okay, so now this is a very simple statement. Of course, it's enough to prove it for x y, right? Because then you can use polarization, because both sides are happily polarized. Now let's take a subdivision as usual, and notice that this sum which converges to quadratic equiliation. Remember, when size of the subdivision tends to zero, it can be rewritten as this x t squared minus x naught squared. And then, you know, you just open the brackets.
00:07:14.464 - 00:07:58.184, Speaker A: This is just sum of xti times xti plus one minus xti. And now we can happily let delta go to zero. This thing, so now tends to quadratic variation. This thing is just this. And finally, this thing, by what we just proved, converges to twice the integral of excess Dxs. We are done. Okay, again, so this was just from convergence of Riemann sums and definition of quadratic variation.
00:07:58.184 - 00:08:48.004, Speaker A: But we get this integration by parts. Notice another thing. So let me, well, I already made this point, but I want to repeat that we know here that this thing, bt squared minus t, is a Martin L. We already proved. But if you just look at this integral, all it tells us that this integral of something with respect to martingale, but not square integral martingale. So this thing is actually not necessarily martingale. A priori, is just a local martic.
00:08:48.004 - 00:09:28.714, Speaker A: But again, here we know that this particular integral is Martin. Okay, so now we solve this preparation. We are ready to prove it is formal. And let me state it quite generally. Let us look at n continuous and marthingales. So we think about it as a process in rn. And f is function from rn to r or from rn to c doesn't matter.
00:09:28.714 - 00:10:46.964, Speaker A: Then the claim is that f of x, t is equal to f of x naught plus some of the integrals of the first derivatives of f with respect to xj integrated with respect to xj. So this would be, if you forget about stochastic integrals, this would be the identity that f of x t is equal to f of x naught plus some of all the integrals of partial derivatives. But we are talking about stochastic integral. And here, what else happens? So you take all the derivatives of f with respect to any I and j, x I and j, and you integrate it with respect to corresponding stochastic correlation. Or maybe stochastic variation of I is equal to j. And then you sum it up and you take one half. Okay, so this is the thing, and this is the famous satisfaction.
00:10:46.964 - 00:11:49.744, Speaker A: So again, this assumption can be weakened significantly. We wouldn't need it in this course, but there are various ways to deal with it, even if f is not c two, if it's just second vex function. But again, this is the formula. So the main unusual thing, if you haven't seen it before, is this integral of the second derivatives. Again, so what we will do, we first assume that each xj is bounded. How do we do it? Well, very easily. We just introduce stopping times, which makes them bounded, and then let everything go to infinity.
00:11:49.744 - 00:12:45.404, Speaker A: All of the sides converge. So there is no question here about this. So, we can assume that each xj is bound. Now, uf is a function which is c two on the closure of the range of x. It's a compact set. So by stoneweirstrass theorem, polynomial sedans there in and well, for slightly by slightly more sophisticated version of stoneware Strauss, they also sedans in situ of this, of this compact set. So, we just need to prove this statement for polynomials and then pass to the limit.
00:12:45.404 - 00:13:57.950, Speaker A: Again, laminated convergence would help us. Not a problem here. By the way, here I notice that I lied to you slightly, because this is not true, that polynomial identity in the space of c two functions on any close set. There are some considerations here. So let's just use the fact that they are dense in the closed ball of radius r for range of x lying inside this box. So this is definitely true. Okay, so now let's prove this for polynomials, and we do it by induction degree.
00:13:57.950 - 00:14:57.806, Speaker A: Well, when degree is f and you talk about constants, nothing to prove. And now for induction step, all you need to show that if it's the statement is true for f, it's true for xj times f. And here, well, I actually called it xk. So let me correct it here. Xk times f. So we just write down that this is equal to this. This is x naught k f x naught plus integral of this df plus f dxj plus xj f evaluated at time t.
00:14:57.806 - 00:16:08.254, Speaker A: So this is just integration by parts. And now we simply value, again, this is x naught k f of x naught plus sum over all j not equal to k x k s df dx jxs plus xa xk df dxk plus f. Right. I simply combined only this, guys. And then you do this stochastic. Well, so you just, this is also xk. So my next case here.
00:16:08.254 - 00:17:07.694, Speaker A: So you just integrate second derivative of x k f with respect to x I j. And that's exactly what we wanted to get. So again, I'm not doing computations of why this is equal to this, but it's very easy to see using again, the fact that the corresponding integral is isometry in h two. Okay, so that's the proof of the formula. So again, as I promised you, everything was already contained in the integration by parts. And then it's just standard things. First you reduce to bounded, then you reduce to polynomial, then you reduce to multiplication by x.
00:17:07.694 - 00:18:03.094, Speaker A: And then you just check that everything works out. Now, sometimes it's very convenient to use differential notation. So if you look at this formula df of xt. So this is a process. This is sum of first derivatives dxj plus one half sum of the second derivative d x I xj. Again, it's possible to make all of this regress and all this. But for us, let us just assume that when I write this, you just know that it means that when you integrate left hand side and right hand side, you get the same.
00:18:03.094 - 00:19:23.286, Speaker A: Another thing here, which would be clear in a moment, and this would be the following corollary. Suppose that f is a function on the plane c two different, twice differentiable continuously, and which satisfies this exciting, well, heat equation d of dy plus one half second derivative of f is equal to zero. And suppose that m is a local martingale. Then I claim that f of m and quadratic variation. So, if you plug in the martingale m instead of x and its quadratic equations, therefore, you get a local Martingale. Okay, so let's see why it is true. Let's look at the formula f of m and quadratic variation.
00:19:23.286 - 00:20:00.090, Speaker A: First of all, there will be an integral with respect to dm. This integral is a local martingale. Remember, integral of anything with respect to local martingale. By definition, by the way we defined it, is a local martingale. So the only, there will be two interesting terms here, which potentially not mercy. This is the first one. This is the integral of Df.
00:20:00.090 - 00:20:47.792, Speaker A: Dy with respect to quadratic variation, because this is the second variable, this is y. There will be no correlations of this with anything. This is a process of bounded variation itself. So correlation of it with anything, just zero. So second term, the term with second derivative, you only need to take second derivative with respect to x. And this would be one half second derivative with respect to x, the same integral with respect to quadratic variation of the same thing. Look here, there is only one possible I or j.
00:20:47.792 - 00:22:08.114, Speaker A: So this is just m, because again, the part which is coming from second variable is just zero. Then this non martingale term is equal to, well, df, dy plus one half second derivative of x is zero. So this is automatically local martingale. Again, because this part drift term, what is called is equal to zero. That's how we would use it formula a lot, while we'll of course, do other computations with this. But one of the things which would be important for us is to see, well, just to look at the drift term, to look at the term which involves steelse integration and sees that it disappears, or maybe not, then we have to subtract it. Okay, so let me give you some applications of this corollary, some examples.
00:22:08.114 - 00:22:48.474, Speaker A: And so this, the first example is x squared minus y. Z, of course, satisfies this exciting problem in the equation. And this is our old friend. If m is a local martingale, then mt squared minus quadratic equation. Well, it's again, a local Martin object, which easily satisfies this is e to the lambda x minus lambda squared over two y, while lambda can be any complex number. Again, plug it in. Easy to see that it satisfies it.
00:22:48.474 - 00:23:46.110, Speaker A: And you get this local martingale, which is called exponential transfer. If, for example, you can see that for certain lambda and for certain m, it's bounded, then you automatically get that it's a martingale, not just a local martingale. So you can look at very nice things, expectation of exponents of m, which is very nice. It would give you Fourier transforms, and the Laplace transforms, things like that. So, exponential transform is extremely important. Okay, so next, emphasize this. Next, I want to look at another relatively down to earth example.
00:23:46.110 - 00:25:04.374, Speaker A: This is a d dimensional brownian motion. So you look, take d, independent copies of no standard brownian motion. And we consider now a function f, which is twice differentiable in r cross RD. So r plus is the time, rd is this space variables. And then the claim is that if you look at this f transform of brownian motion, so by definition, this is the, you take f at the point t and then random point b of t and subtract integral of the half Laplacian plus df dt over the trajectory. So you integrate this over the trajectory of brownian motion. Then the claim is that this is local martingale.
00:25:04.374 - 00:26:10.844, Speaker A: In particular, when this is equal to zero, when f satisfies heat equation, then this is a local martingale. So this is generalization of what happens here. Another thing is, if f is t independent and harmonic in Rd, then f of Bt. Now, it's also a local marten. So, harmonic function of brownian motion is marten is, well, local marten. The proof is exactly the same as the proof of previous corollary. You just apply eta and you see that the drift term is this because the only.
00:26:10.844 - 00:27:41.364, Speaker A: So let me actually comment on this. For d dimensional brownian motion, if you take the quadratic relation of the two, it, well, it could be zero if I is not equal to j because they are independent, or it could be t if they are equal to each other. So the quadratic correlation is delta ij times t. So this drift term in the ether formula would just become Laplacian Dt. That's why we have just ds integral here. And then this part, of course comes from first term in zetas formula when we take it with respect to DT. So they, they combine together to get this.
00:27:41.364 - 00:29:39.434, Speaker A: Okay, so if you apply harmonic function to brownian motion, that's what would be important for me later. Then you at least get local marten, if you manage to see that in certain up to stopping time something, your harmonic function is bounded in certain domain way, you stopped your brownian motion, then this would be honest to goodness, Martin, and then you would take in values. This actually would be very useful in proving conformal variance. Okay, now since we'll be talking a lot about two dimensions, we definitely need to talk a lot about complex notations. So, let us look at process, which is just xt plus iyt real and imaginary part, then zt. Well, you just take the quadratic variation, then you open the brackets and you get that it's quadratic correlation of xx minus quadratic correlation of yy plus y quadratic correlation of xy. In particular, if f is the usual twice differentiable function on the complex plane, then f of zt.
00:29:39.434 - 00:30:57.374, Speaker A: Let's look at the iter's formula. It's f of z zero plus the integral d of dz plus the integral d of dz bar. And here is the integral of laplacian of f at the point dt, which you integrate with respect z correlated with z bar. Again, it's very easy to see just using the latest formula. This is just a complex way to write it. Now, what does it mean if z is a local martingale, just local martingale, not brownian Martin f is harmonic. Then f of zt is also a local martian.
00:30:57.374 - 00:31:44.528, Speaker A: Right, because this part just disappears. And what is left is. Oops, there is a misprint here, because this is of course, integral with respect to z bar. This part definitely that. And what is left is constant plus integral df dz or function with respect to local martingale plus another integral with respect to another local martingale. Just conjugate of it and emphasize it. So that's it.
00:31:44.528 - 00:32:52.734, Speaker A: That's our complex form of iter's formula. Now let us move a bit further and let us try to use Iter's formula to characterize brownian motion among all d dimensional processes. So well. And then I will try to convince you that any at least one dimensional continuous local Martin L is time change of brownian motion. And any nice two dimensional martingale or complex martingale, also prana motion, just time changed. But let's start slowly. So, let's start with the statement of the theorem of Paul Levy.
00:32:52.734 - 00:33:30.684, Speaker A: So we start with d dimensional adapted process. Let's start it at zero. Then the following. First is that x is d dimensional brownian motion. Okay, so that's what we want to characterize. Second is that it's a continuous local martingale with the following quadratic relations. So two guys are just uncorrelated.
00:33:30.684 - 00:34:39.594, Speaker A: If I is not equal to j, quadratic correlation is zero. And if I is equal to j, quadratic correlation should be the same as for brownian motion. And the third process is that when you look at your continuous local martingale so condition, and you take it any function, and then l two function, and you look at the exponential transform. This is an exponent of I sum of integrals from zero to tfk dxk. So you kind of integrate fk and then you integrate f k squared with respect, with what would be quadratic variation ds, except that you don't know it yet, that it would be quadratic relation of x. So you look at this process. So this I, this sum plus one half sum of the integrals from zero to tf k squared of sds.
00:34:39.594 - 00:35:36.044, Speaker A: I want it to be Martin G. So if you know this or this, then you are dealing with brown envelope. Of course, third condition is not very easy to check. Usually it's much easier to check this, but the way the proof would go, of course, one implies two, two implies three, three would imply one. Now, what does it mean for one dimensional brownian motion? It means that any continuous one dimensional local martingale, this quadratic variation equal to t, is just standard brownian motion. Okay, so I believe that's how actually Livy stated that this is a later generalization. Okay, so now let's prove it.
00:35:36.044 - 00:36:31.434, Speaker A: Well, d dimensional brownian motion has this correlation that we already discussed. That's by definition, because different components are just independent of each other. So one definitely implies two. That's very, very easy. Okay, so now let's see what is e to the if. So, let me be slightly more careful. So we start with continuous local martingale with this thing.
00:36:31.434 - 00:37:13.524, Speaker A: Now, if you look at this martingale, which is defined to be just integral I sum of fk dxk, its quadratic variation is written here. And remember that integration is isometry. So quadratic variation of x k s of each component of x ks. Oh, sorry. Of x k s, it's already component. Sorry, it's in. It's just s.
00:37:13.524 - 00:38:07.364, Speaker A: So here it would become integral of f k squared ds. And then you sum them up, they are uncorrelated with each other. So the mixed terms just die. And so let me actually write it down that MMT is just equal to sum of f k squared integral from zero to t f k squared. Yes. And then we look at the exponential transform. So let's remember the exponential transform.
00:38:07.364 - 00:38:49.844, Speaker A: This is this one, we take lambda equal to one. Oh, well, if you don't add I there, we can take lambda equal to I, doesn't matter. And, oh, okay. And then here I should add minus. Okay, so, okay, let me correct this. Okay, so we take this local martingale, we take it transform. We know that it's a local martingale.
00:38:49.844 - 00:39:19.424, Speaker A: But let's look at the absolute value of it. It's just this part has its exponent of I times. Something real has absolute value, zero absolute value, rather than. So we are left with this. So this integral from zero to tf k squared. But we can integrate up to infinity. We will make it even more.
00:39:19.424 - 00:39:57.664, Speaker A: And we know that what we assume that each of k belongs to l two. So this is a bounded local martingale. So it is a martingale, not just local martingale. This is very important. It's a martingale. And finally, so this of course, proves that two implies three. And the most interesting part of this is to prove that three implies one.
00:39:57.664 - 00:41:08.104, Speaker A: But again, remember I told you that exponential transform would allow us to easily compute freer transforms? And that's what would happen here. So we fix psi in RD. We fix any t which can be stopping time or can be just time. And let's take f to be psi multiplied by characteristic function of zero t. So if t is just a number or expectation of t is bounded, then this function f, remember, it has d component size, energy. It belongs to l two. And let's look at the exponential transform of a t, which we know is a martingale.
00:41:08.104 - 00:42:00.774, Speaker A: So this is exponent of I times psi multiplied by x at time. What? So, since we multiply by this, this is minimum of t and tau. So this is just in a product. So, look at what we have to do. So we just integrate from zero to capital t, and we again add quadratic equation up to t, again, up to minimum of t and t capital. Okay, so this is. We know that this is a martingale.
00:42:00.774 - 00:43:31.924, Speaker A: So if a belongs to fs and s is smaller while less or equal than t and less than t, then everything which is written here, well, there is no mu, just t. So, expectation of our characteristic function of I with respect to, well, characteristic function of I multiplied by exponent of this inner product I x I xt minus success, what would it be? Well, let's look here. You know that expectation of this guy at time t with respect to fs would be eiff's. So the integrals with respect to one a, of this guy, 40 time t and time s should be the same. So now we recombine it and this. So. Oh, okay.
00:43:31.924 - 00:44:46.254, Speaker A: Already, this would become, well, conditional expectation of one a with respect to this is just probability of a multiplied by exponent well, of the difference xi squared over two t minus s. And now we know that this identity is true for any xi in r. So, what we get, we get two things. First, that Fourier transform of x t minus x s is normal, variable is min, t minus s, and it is independent of fs. Because, again, when you integrate with respect to characteristic function, you get back probability times this. So XT minus success is actually normal, independent of the previous times with this quadrilateral quadrant. So this means that it is a brownian motion.
00:44:46.254 - 00:45:17.754, Speaker A: That's it. So, just by cleverly using integral transform. Oh, sorry. Exponential transform, we are able to get the fact that this is just brownian motion. That's it. That proves LVC. And now, this leads to something already alluded to.
00:45:17.754 - 00:46:23.346, Speaker A: Suppose that you have a one dimensional continuous local martingale. And suppose that you know that it starts at zero and its quadratic variation is equal to t. Then implication two implies one in this theorem tells us that it is a brownian motion, just a standard brownian motion. Okay, let us do another thing. Let us do a complex form, a two dimensional motion process. So suppose that Ziy is a local martingale, and suppose that Zz is actually zero and excess is t. Then I claim that z is a two dimensional primary motion.
00:46:23.346 - 00:47:01.824, Speaker A: It's if and only if statement. So remember, for real things, this would be the decimal point. This would be constant. But it's complex. So there are correlations involved. Okay, so proof is very easy. Let's remember that zz relation of z with itself, it's the correlation of real part, or rather variance of real part minus variance of imaginary part minus twice the correlation.
00:47:01.824 - 00:47:46.784, Speaker A: So what does it mean that z is equal to zero and xx is equal to t? Let's see what it means. It's equivalent to the fact that both real and imaginary part of this are dead. So they are equal to each other. So they are equal to t. On the other hand, xy is equal to zero. So x and y are not correlated. And quadratic variation of x is the same as the quadratic variation of y is just t.
00:47:46.784 - 00:48:23.494, Speaker A: So we can use two dimensional lv. This is exactly two dimensional Lv. And it will tell us that this is a two dimensional brownian motion. Now, realize that I forgot to mention one more condition, that of course, it should start at zero. Otherwise it's simply not true. Okay, so this is a two dimensional brownian motion. Okay, so this is all nice and fun, but I promised you more.
00:48:23.494 - 00:49:03.424, Speaker A: I promised you that any one dimensional local martingale which has continuous trajectory is a brownian motion reparametrized. And that's what I will prove next time. So, in a week, this is ethereum of dambins and Dubin Schwartz. And this is a very different Schwarz from the ones I mentioned before. This is Gideon Schwartz and Lester Dubins. I couldn't find a picture of dambets. He was a soviet mathematician.
00:49:03.424 - 00:50:08.734, Speaker A: Probably his photo exists somewhere, but I couldn't find one which clearly states that it was him. Anyway, the theorem states that if you have a local martingale which starts at zero and which almost surely goes to infinity in quadratic variants with quadratic variations, sorry, not quadrant quadratic variation, then you can change time such that in this new time, it becomes a brownian motion. Or equivalently this process is re parametrized brownian motion. So you can obtain any continuous local martin from this. But before we do this, we, of course, will need to carefully study change of time. This will we will do next time. Okay, let me stop the recording.
