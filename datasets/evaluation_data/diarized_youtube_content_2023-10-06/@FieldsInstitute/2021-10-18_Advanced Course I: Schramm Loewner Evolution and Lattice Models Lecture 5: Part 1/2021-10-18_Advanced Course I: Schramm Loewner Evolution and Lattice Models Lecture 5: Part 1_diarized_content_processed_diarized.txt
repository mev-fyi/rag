00:00:03.280 - 00:00:29.256, Speaker A: Good morning, afternoon, or evening, depending on where you are. Welcome, everybody. Okay, sorry. I have a niche problem. Hopefully I fixed it. So today we will continue talking about Leovner differential equation. And let me remind you, this general equation.
00:00:29.256 - 00:01:58.268, Speaker A: So here it is that if you have a growing family of compact subsets in the disk. So where is it? Yeah, so you have a collection growing subsets. Or equivalently, you have a chain of conformal maps subordinate to each other. Then you can describe these conformal maps by these differential equations. And this was if and only statement, meaning that if you if your family of conformal map satisfies the differential equation, then it should generate these growing holes. And last time, we looked at this example of chain generated by curves. And notice here that the curve could be self touching, and our domain is a component of zero of the complement of the curve.
00:01:58.268 - 00:02:54.692, Speaker A: Gamma ran up to time t, and kt is just. Well, this curve is everything that it ate up, filled in. Now, today we'll look at the question of what happens with the Liovner differential equation with this equation when your Liovner family is indeed generated by these curves. And, well, this is also called slit domains. So let me be very specific here. So let gamma of t be a curve. And as usual, it's from zero infinity to Zenu disk.
00:02:54.692 - 00:03:43.532, Speaker A: Gamma of zero is on the boundary. Gamma of infinity is zero, and the curve itself is a simple curve, or maybe self touching curve. What will be very important for us, that we don't want something like this. So this is something we really don't want. We really don't want curves which are self crossing. Okay? So let us normalize everything as usual, so that this maps to the complement to omega t. So let me remind that omega t component of zero in d minus gamma of zero t.
00:03:43.532 - 00:04:39.184, Speaker A: So, like in our example last time, let's normalize it by making derivative at zero at time t to be e to the minus t. And then we have this normalized Leonard chain. And what I will try to convince you is that actually the differential equation becomes much simpler in this case. But let's first look at some observations. So, first of all, by car sedori, for each t f t extends continuously to the whole closure of d. While in the case when the curve is simple, when the curve is self touching, it just extends to the closure of omega T. So let me write that closure of omega T for self touching.
00:04:39.184 - 00:05:27.234, Speaker A: And now what it means is that we can look at the preimage of the tip of the curve. That would be apparently lambda of T. Okay, so this lambda of t would play crucial role in what goes on next. Now, let me remind you some notations. So, inverse two, the map of t would be denoted by gt. And we'll also have this transfer maps phi st, which is a first inverse component with ft. This is what happens when S is less or equal than T.
00:05:27.234 - 00:06:18.380, Speaker A: Okay, so this is well defined when s less or equal than T. And it played crucial role. Remember, in the proof of LJOvNer differential equation in general case. Okay, so here comes the theorem that actually, in this case, the inverse map satisfies ordinary differential equation. Well, that's exactly like in general case. But look what happens here. We have just lambda of t plus gt of z, lambda of t minus gt of z instead of this integral, and the same with f.
00:06:18.380 - 00:07:07.224, Speaker A: So we have pd as before, because there is a derivative with respect to t, there is a derivative with respect to z. But again, what we multiply at is not integral with respect to measure, just lambda of t plus d, lambda of t minus z. And so again, for general equation, this one looks like this. And if you look at it carefully, it means that in the case of the slit domains, the measure mu of t is very special, just delta mass at the point lambda of t. And more than that, this would be part of the theorem. Lambda of t would be a continuous function. And this is all initially not very obvious.
00:07:07.224 - 00:08:18.964, Speaker A: So, as compared to general laudner evolution, there is a significant simplification. Again, mu is a very special measure, and the image of the tip of the curve under ft changes continuously. So, just a piece of notation. Lambda of t is the driving function of the Leonard. Okay, now, one more difference with General Leonard theorem is that this remark in general, remember, the derivative existed almost everywhere, and we just relied on the fact that the map t to ft is absolutely continuous for every ft. So if you knew the derivative of it in almost every point, well, you could restore the map from this derivative. Here we actually would claim slightly more that this time derivative exists faulty.
00:08:18.964 - 00:09:40.794, Speaker A: And this time derivative also exists faulty. Okay, so that's general setup another thing for in my task, remember that in general theorem, if you have a solution to this differential equation, it's more or less automatic scale. If you have. Now, the logical question is, if you have a solution to this equation, would it be automatically generated by a slit domain? The answer is no, unfortunately. What we'll do later today, we'll give a precise statement about what can be generated by Ljovnir's chains from continuous curves. Okay? So for now, let us first prove that if you have a slit domain, then it's actually generated by this, by a solution of this Leonard differential equation. Okay, so proof will of course rely on the same components as before, but they will this.
00:09:40.794 - 00:11:10.804, Speaker A: So let me remind you of this little thing, of this little key trick that we had before. So we define this function Pst of z, which is just this combination of transfer function phi st of z n twelve correspondingly normalized. And it belonged to class p, meaning that Pst of zero was one and real, part of p was positive. And then we had this hair gloss representation that this is d mu st of z, where mu st of z is a probability measure supported on the closure of the set where phi st is not one. So this is precise formulation of this, since we don't know if this limit exists, if the map five is extendable up to the boundary, in our case it will be. Of course, we are talking about the mind generated by curves, but in general, this is a correct description of the support of this measure. So what will be extremely useful for us will show that when s approaches t, in our case, support of this measure shrinks to a point.
00:11:10.804 - 00:11:55.730, Speaker A: So this measure would automatically weakly converge to delta measure at this point. So that's the idea of what would happen next. We'll show that the support of mu St shrinks to a point and that what lambda of s? Well, it's the kind of center of support of this measure. It would be close to lambda of t. Okay, let's do the details. So here's a precise description of what would happen. So let the node by Wst the following.
00:11:55.730 - 00:12:53.454, Speaker A: So let us run our curve up to time s, that the blue thing here, and then run it for a little bit up to time t. Now, if we take the preimage of this whole construct and ft this part from gamma s to gamma t. Well, remember ft is now extendable up to the boundary. So the pre image of this part would be wst and pre image of the tip. Remember, lambda of t is ft, inverse of gamma of t. So pre image of the tip lies inside this wst. So again, now notation is gt of gamma St.
00:12:53.454 - 00:13:55.194, Speaker A: But we also push this thing forward under j's of s inverse. So let ssst be the push forward of this little green piece goes here. So under map fire st, if you look at the composition, wst move to ssst. Okay, so this is our main setup. Now we can use Schwarz reflection to expand it. So we reflect over circle here and we expand phi st and we look at it as a map from complement of wst to the complement st and what I called ssst star. Well, this is just reflection of Sst with respect to the unit circle.
00:13:55.194 - 00:15:36.084, Speaker A: So we have a grade map. Okay, so now let's look at diameters of this curve, and let's be very careful here. So why would I know that, for example, when t approached s, diameter of sst tends to zero? Well, we just know that there is a short crosscut here which separates this part of the curve from gamma s to gamma t from zero. Remember, by Lavrentyev theorem, the length of the image of the short crosscut? Well, the diameter of the image of the short crosscut cannot be more than square root of the diameter of crosscut. So when t approaches twice, diameter of ss of t goes to zero. Similar when s grows to t, the diameter here goes to zero. And we can again use map fs inverse to see that again by Lavrentiv, diameter of ss goes to zero.
00:15:36.084 - 00:16:43.664, Speaker A: Now, let me emphasize that all we used to establish this so far was the fact that there is a short crosscut which separates what is so rather omega s minus omega t. Sorry, it's in sprint here from zero. Right? Because here, again, imagine that the picture. So let me draw slightly different picture. So this is my now self touching curve. And this is a new guy. So this would be gamma of s and this is gamma of t.
00:16:43.664 - 00:17:36.534, Speaker A: So here, between time s and t, you added this whole thing. You added a lot. Yet in terms of the diameter, the initial foot would still be small. How do I know this? Because there is a short cross cut here separating what we added from zero. So we just use Lavrentiv theorem to establish that diameter of SST tends to zero when s approach t o t approaches us. Exactly the same happens with WsT. You apply Lavrentiv theorem, but not to the map gt instead of j's.
00:17:36.534 - 00:18:38.280, Speaker A: So to establish that SST goes to zero, you apply Lavrentiv theorem to the map g's. When you want to establish a diameter wst goes to zero, you apply Labradive theorem to the map gt. Again, all we used here is there is a small crosscut sigma separating omega s minus omega t from zero. That would be crucial for permian k theorem. Remember I told you that domain generated by rather Leonard chain generated by continuous curves are not necessarily the one generated by curves. And that's exactly the condition. I will state it more precisely.
00:18:38.280 - 00:19:30.124, Speaker A: But essentially, when you grow your compact hole, what grows, essentially grows at one prime end. That's the meaning of. But again, let's return to what we are proving now. And the rest of the proof only relies on the fact that this goes to zero and this goes to zero. We will not now extend anything up to the boundary that we really don't need here. We won't use the fact that we are generated by the curve. All we use diameter of WsT and diameter of SST goes to zero.
00:19:30.124 - 00:20:42.526, Speaker A: And the first thing to prove is that this thing converges to z everywhere on C, where it is defined. So, in compact subsets of the points well outside of where phi is defined. And phi St, remember, is defined outside of WST. When? Now we know that when s goes to t, this set where it defines to lambda of t, because the diameter tends to zero. So what we really proving is that phi st converges to z uniformly outside of lambda of t. Okay? So to do this, we consider this ratio phi c of z divided by z. It's analytic in the whole c, because singularity at zero is clearly removable.
00:20:42.526 - 00:21:18.968, Speaker A: Phi st of zero is zero. That was one of the main properties that we had. Now, as long as we stop our process by fixed time t phi, this psi is also bounded at infinity. Let's check it, because what is this? It's size t of z. It's the limit phi c of z over z. Now let's remember that phi c was defined as by reflection. So this limit is the same as limit when z goes to zero of z.
00:21:18.968 - 00:22:11.264, Speaker A: Well, one over z here. So z here over phi bar of z bar. So this is really one over psi bar over psi st prime bar. So since this was real anyway, this is just e to the t minus s. So it's bounded e to the t. Okay, now by kirby one four theorem. Since we know that derivative of phi st of zero is e to the t minus s, rather e to the s minus t, we have that for every z in st sst, absolute value of z is at least e to the s minus t over four z.
00:22:11.264 - 00:23:22.790, Speaker A: On sstar, absolute value of z is bounded reflection four e to the t minus s. Okay, so now let's notice that it means that on wst, or when you approach wst, if you don't want to really define your map on the set, it's not uniquely defined there anyway, because there are approaches from here, from inside and from outside. But when you approach wst, your psi is bounded by four e to the t minus s. Okay? So by maximum principle size t is actually uniformly bounded as long as s less or equal to s, less than t, less or equal to capital. So what do you have this psi t at least for s, and t less than some capital t. That's standard assumption here they form a normal family. Form a normal family.
00:23:22.790 - 00:24:00.454, Speaker A: Now to show that, they just need to consider a subsequential limit point. So here it is, and we'll show that this is one. So what do we know about psych? It's bounded by e to the t analytic outside of lambda t, since diameter, remember, diameter of wst goes to zero. So lambda of t is removable. And we have exciting function which is analytic in the plane and bounded. So it's constant by Louisville theorem. Very soft argument here.
00:24:00.454 - 00:25:08.194, Speaker A: So psi of z is constant, which is the same as psi of zero. Well, so it's one. So by standard normality argument, since the family was normal m, sequential limit is one, psi converts to one, which means that phi converges to z. Okay, now take s close enough to t so that w s t is inside of ball centered at lambda of t of radius epsilon. Such thing exists because the diameter again shrinks to zero. Then on the boundary of this ball, phi of z minus z is less than epsilon when s is close enough to t. Because remember, we are convergent uniformly on all compact subsets of the complement of lambda of t, including this boundary.
00:25:08.194 - 00:26:01.444, Speaker A: So the image of this ball is subset of ball of radius two epsilon centered at lambda of t, right? Because phi st is not far from z, so v can be at distance at most two epsilon. But lambda of s is there. Lambda of s belongs to phi s t of w s t. So lambda of s minus lambda of t is less than two epsilon. And we have that limit when s increases to t, lambda of s is equal to lambda of t. What about this limit? So we already established left continuity of the function lambda. What about right continuity? Well, this is the same.
00:26:01.444 - 00:26:41.782, Speaker A: We apply exactly the same argument, but to the function phi s t inverse of z. So we consider psi phi s t inverse over z. We show that it also converges to z and everything is exactly the same. Now we establish that our lambda of t is continuous function. Let us prove that it satisfy. Nice form of leod differential equation. So let me remind you our main identity.
00:26:41.782 - 00:27:38.254, Speaker A: So this is preloveder. I would say that what would be the time derivative of f can be rewritten as this using transfer function. And so this is our mu st, which we already discussed. And again, mu st is supported on the set where phi st doesn't belong to the circle right so this is exactly wst. Okay, now, as s goes to t, mu, st has to go to delta function at lambda t. Why? Because there is only one probability measure which is supported at the point lambda t. And support of this shrinks to support of this.
00:27:38.254 - 00:28:56.304, Speaker A: So limit, when s goes to t of this part is just equal to integral of the same thing with respect to delta function at lambda t, which is, surprise, surprise, lambda of t minus z, lambda of t plus z. So the main difference, again, this previous situation that this, what I just said, works for every table, not just for some t. It works for everything, not for almost everything. And now, as before, this part, when s goes to t, this part happily converge to the derivative, to the space derivative. This part, again, always converges to just minus z, because this converges to minus two. This is converges minus one half. This converges to two z and, well, this one.
00:28:56.304 - 00:30:10.792, Speaker A: Okay, so we see that Dft Dt exists for all z and fold t and equal to this. And we are done, because from this, we see that the same is true for the inverse function in this already by the usual theorem. Okay, so this was actually the classical setup. This is how luvna revisioned it. So the more general theorem, which we talked about this was already later work of Kufariv. So what was important for Leonard is that if you have a slit family, if you have a slit Leonard chain, then it's generated by this differential equation. Thus, direction was not too interesting for him, but it is very interesting for us, because for us, what would happen when we compare, we want to define our random curves, our random objects using random driving function, using brownian motion.
00:30:10.792 - 00:31:11.094, Speaker A: So we wouldn't want to make this lambda of t brownian motion, what we now know by General Kufriff theorem, that we would indeed create a ljovnr chain this way. And it would be very nice just to say, okay, since lambda of t is continuous, then the resulting curve is really generated. What will happen? The results in Klopp chain is indeed generated by a curve. Unfortunately, in general, this is absolutely not true. I'll give you a counter example in a moment. So, there is a full characterization of the l chains, which can be generated by this equation for general continuous function lambda of t. And it's due to Christian Kamerenky.
00:31:11.094 - 00:32:06.054, Speaker A: So my pleasure to show a picture of him. And I already hinted at what it would be. So, Pomeranki theorem says that normalized ljovnor chain, or just ljovnor chain omega t, has a continuous driving function lambda of t. If the following is true for every t. So remember, we need to stop somewhere far from zero. And for every epsilon there exists delta such that you can separate. And again here, it's a misprint.
00:32:06.054 - 00:32:45.514, Speaker A: Omega of t plus delta minus omega t. So you should be able. No, no, this was not a misprint. Yeah, omega t is bigger here. Sorry. So I wonder how many seismic sprints I still have. You see, in I mentioned that in classical setup, they consider slightly different things where domains omega actually became bigger.
00:32:45.514 - 00:33:28.114, Speaker A: So for us, duma and sonic are smaller. There is one to one correspondence between them. Easy. One to one correspondence. But anyway, in our setup, we want a cross cut gamma, this small diameter, which is very important, which separates what is grown from so new part from zero. Okay? And so let me give you an example of bad things. So let me give you an example of something which is not generated by a curve, but which still satisfies pomeranian Catherine.
00:33:28.114 - 00:34:23.628, Speaker A: And this is the spiral. So imagine that you have this circle and you have an infinite spiral which goes on this circle. So it does it up to some fixed time t. And then there is another infinite spiral which goes from the circle to infinity overall, rather to zero in our center. So you start somewhere on the boundary of the domain, you do infinite spiraling on this little circle, and you do it at finite time. Why? Because when you take the union of all this, it's still. And you unzip it, it's still, the corresponding map has some positive derivative at zero, still doesn't include zero.
00:34:23.628 - 00:35:33.004, Speaker A: And then you can continue this curve. So what you created here is actually not a curve, it's two curves. But at the time t, there is no continuity because there is no gamma of t when you wind around this circle. Okay, so here, it's one of the bad examples. And unfortunately, when we talk about Shramne, one of the first questions which you would have to answer is why this does not happen when lambda of t is brownian motion. Okay, so now let us prove the theory. So again, this is a complete characterization of what ljovnir chains can be generated by continuous driving functions.
00:35:33.004 - 00:36:30.352, Speaker A: And let me remark that one direction is that when Liovner chain satisfies this primaryanke condition. I already gave the proof, and the remark that I gave during the proof for slit domains, purports are exactly this, like, specifically selected among many proofs. The proof which immediately gives this part of Pymirian caesarium two. So what really happens? Remember, we just use Lavrentiv theorem, and Lavrentiv theorem didn't care about what this crosscut did Lavrentiev theorem just said. Well, okay, there is a small crosscut separating what has grown from zero. Great. Then wst goes to the zero in diameter.
00:36:30.352 - 00:37:15.564, Speaker A: Sst gross goes to zero in diameter. So we have everything. Now. Other direction, of course, is somewhat more interesting. So we now know that our l chain is created by just continuous driving function, which means that in luke our measure mu t is delta function at lambda of t, where lambda of t is continuous. And here we'll need a few technical claims. So here the proof gets somewhat technical, but that's to be expected.
00:37:15.564 - 00:38:38.394, Speaker A: Okay, so let's prepare carefully. Fix an eta which will let them go to zero delta less than eta squared over 16, and such that if t minus s is less or equal than delta, then lambda of t minus lambda of s is less than et over four. Indeed, everywhere. Here we assume that s and t less or equal than some capital t, because otherwise, well, it's hard even to say that we know that function lambda is continuous, but it doesn't need to be continuous or uniformly continuous up to infinity. That's not needed. We just use it up to time t. Okay, the first claim is that suppose that z is far away from lambda of s at time s, and then let us look at the evolution of z under the map phi st.
00:38:38.394 - 00:39:39.074, Speaker A: And then what? I claim that up to time delta s plus delta, we are still far away, relatively far away from lambda. So it cannot happen that z was far away from lambda of s. And then in this time delta, which was specifically selected, again like this, we suddenly grew very close. And more than that, z is actually close to phi st of z. That's, of course, this implies. This implies, sorry, this and meaning of this is again the following. Z was far away from lambda office.
00:39:39.074 - 00:40:42.064, Speaker A: It is for some time delta. It still stays far away. That's important, because, remember, short crosscuts which we would need to create would rely on the fact that we don't suck in things from far away. Okay, so let t one be the first time. When u of t is at over two between s and t, one u of t is actually bigger, equals the net over top overall, strictly bigger. Then let us look at this so we know that lambda of t minus t is bigger equals than lambda of s minus lambda of t minus lambda of s. Well, this is bigger equals the net over four.
00:40:42.064 - 00:41:26.314, Speaker A: Remember, lambda of t minus lambda of s up to time delta, at least if t one minus s is less than delta, then it's big or equal to net over. Okay, again, so let me be, let me be slightly more precise in what I'm doing here. I assume that t one minus s is less than delta. And I want to arrive to contradiction, which would prove this. And then this. Okay, so if I assume that t one minus s is less than delta, then I know that lambda of t minus phi s t of z is bigger than et over four. Let's differentiate ut.
00:41:26.314 - 00:42:09.834, Speaker A: Well, this is just derivative of this. And now, well, this is derivative of absolute value. It's less bigger equals than absolute value of the derivative. So we know that this derivative is at least this. So this is by Luovner differential equation. The d dt of phi st is just this, which is bigger equal than eight over eight. Because the only thing which was suspicious is bigger equal than that over four.
00:42:09.834 - 00:43:11.284, Speaker A: So this has become bigger equal than eight over eight. Okay, so, and I forgot the minus sign here, minus eight over eta, right? Because there is minus here. So, which means that u of t u of s is bigger equals than minus eight over et, one minus s, and it's minus eight over minus eight, delta over eight. And then we remember that how we select delta and we get that this is bigger than minus eight over two. Contradiction. Now, exactly the same way we can do this inequality. So I just skipping writing it, but we again, just look at the first time, we are bigger than et over two.
00:43:11.284 - 00:44:10.154, Speaker A: And then since this inequality implies this inequality, we can just repeat these steps. And again, see that this is just impossible to jump up in this time delta. So, okay, we know again that if we stayed far away from lambda of s, we are guaranteed to stay far away. Okay, second claim is very similar. It says that if we are staying far away, so the same condition, then actually phi st of z is at least absolute value of z squared. So it cannot just become very, very small by absolute value. Again, the proof is very similar.
00:44:10.154 - 00:44:41.778, Speaker A: We look at t two. This is the first time we become absolute value of z squared. And then we look at the logarithm of phi st of z. So we jumped from log z at time s to two log. Let's look at the derivative. So again, value of the differential equation. This is just real part of one over five.
00:44:41.778 - 00:45:33.264, Speaker A: So this is not yet. So this is not yet, Leonard. This is just standard derivative of the logarithm. Remember, logarithm is a real part of the complex logarithm. So which is whose derivative is d phi over phi. And then here we use differential equation, and we have this, and we already know that lambda of t minus phi in this setting is bigger than eight over four. So we plug everything in and then, exactly like here, before we see the log phi just cannot jump from log epsilon value to two log epsilon value of z in time delta.
00:45:33.264 - 00:46:07.494, Speaker A: Okay, so now we are ready to prove memory theory. Okay, so let us look at our standard setup. So wst sst. So here we wouldn't even need reflection. So this is sst is d minus phi st of d. So this is phs inverse of omega s minus omega t as before. Exactly.
00:46:07.494 - 00:47:16.234, Speaker A: So I claim that by claims one and two, if t is between s and s plus delta, then ssst is actually lying inside the disk centered lambdas of radius to eta. Okay, so why? Because if w belongs to sst, then w is just some phi st of z. And then we see that w is less than absolute value of z squared, because absolute value of z squared is here, w is. So it's one. W is here. And here I'm lying to you, because actually phi is not defined up to the boundary here. We don't know if it's extendable and in most cases it won't be.
00:47:16.234 - 00:48:13.264, Speaker A: So, strictly speaking, what we need, we need to select sequence wns. Conversion to w. Z then would converge. Well, absolute value of zen would converge to one, of course. And then we see that for large n at least wn is less than zn squared. So if I counter positive two, claim two, this implies that z minus lambda s is less or equal than eta, because zn minus lambda s is less or equal than eta. So if w is in necessity, then z at least is close theta.
00:48:13.264 - 00:49:15.754, Speaker A: And now let's look at the complement of this. So d eta would be z such that z minus lambda s is bigger than eta. Then by what we just established, phi st of dt doesn't intersect with sst. But on the other hand, by claim one. Now since lambda s minus lambda t is less than at over four, phi st of d contains complement of this disk. Because if you are far away from eta, you are far away from, sorry, from lambda t, you're far away from lambda S. And so by, so this is phi st of z minus lambda s.
00:49:15.754 - 00:49:46.362, Speaker A: And so by claim one, you were far away from lambda s to begin with. So if w was two away from lambda t, z itself is at a way, at least at a way from lambda S. So this is exactly it. And so, which means that SSt is actually inside this. I can't. Now we finally can use wolf lemma. So they exist.
00:49:46.362 - 00:50:16.514, Speaker A: I wouldn't write the details, but they exist. A short crosscut in ohm gas which separates omega fs of SST from zero. Again, the bound on this is again one over square root of logarithm of the length. That's horrible. But it tends to zero when eta tends to zero. And that's what is important to us. And that finishes the proof.
00:50:16.514 - 00:50:48.434, Speaker A: So the final step is application of full flema, because we know that SST is inside this little disk. So one of the images of the crosscuts here by our discussion in Wolflemmer would have a small diameter and would satisfy all the properties. Okay, so this is a good time for a break, so let me stop recording.
