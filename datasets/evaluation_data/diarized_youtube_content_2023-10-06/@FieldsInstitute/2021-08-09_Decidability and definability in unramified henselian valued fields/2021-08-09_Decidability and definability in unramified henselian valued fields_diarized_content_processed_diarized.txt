00:00:05.880 - 00:00:25.748, Speaker A: It's my pleasure to introduce today's first speaker, Fraziska Yonkoff from Munster, who will speak on decidability and definability in unramified henceilian valued fields. Remember, if you have questions you can put them in chat and I'll try to relate them to the speaker.
00:00:25.766 - 00:00:26.404, Speaker B: Speaker.
00:00:28.264 - 00:01:09.892, Speaker C: Thank you, thank you very much. And thanks to the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak today. So I will tell you some very classical and some slightly newer results about decidability and definability in unrammified henceilian valued fields. And so the first I want to do today is to recall something I guess most of you will know or all of you will have heard of. So this is the classical results for unremified henceilian valued fields. So throughout the talk I will use the following notation. K v is a valued field.
00:01:09.892 - 00:03:08.014, Speaker C: I will write Kv for the residue field and vk for the valued group. And now we call a valued field k v of mixed characteristic characteristic unremified if the value of p. So of course if the characteristic is mixed, that means p is in the maximal ideal and the value of p is something strictly positive. So if the value of p is in fact the minimum positive element in the value group. And of course for example, the periodics with a periodic valuation are an example of an unremified valued field, but also the rationals with a periodic valuation. Now the very classical theorem by excursion and Yashov says that if you have two unremified henceilian valued fields, kv and lw with perfect residue fields, and let me call so the residue fields are kv respectively lw, then this theorem says that the valued fields are elementarily equivalent. Kv is elementarily equivalent to lw if and only if the residue fields are elementarily equivalent and the value groups are elementarily equivalent.
00:03:08.014 - 00:04:32.256, Speaker C: And here I mean the elementary equivalence in the language of valued fields, which for me for the sake of this talk is the language of rings, together with the unary predicate interpreted as evaluation ring. And for the residue fields I just mean as rings, and for the value group I mean in the language of auditributing groups. So I'm going to sketch the proof, even though I assume that most of you will have seen it, because I want to point to you somehow. One method to prove it, and very explicitly point to you where the assumption of perfectness of the residue field comes in so well. The direction from left to right is fairly obvious because the residue field and the value group are interpretable in the valued field and they're uniformly interpretable, of course. I mean. Okay, so the other direction, how does it go? So we are assuming the residue fields are elementarily equivalent in the language of rings and the value groups are elementarily equivalent in the language of order to be in groups.
00:04:32.256 - 00:05:57.168, Speaker C: And so we take ultra products of these valued fields. I mean, so we have two valued fields satisfying these site conditions and we take two ultra products to ensure that, well, first of all, by valued fields are aleph one saturated, and secondly, the residue fields are actually isomorphic and so are the value groups. And we can do that using the keylach theorem. Okay, so now what does, what do I learn from my evaluation being unremified, right? This means v of p is the smallest positive element in the value group. And this means the convex subgroup generated by the value of p is isomorphic to the integers. And whenever I have a convex subgroup of my value group, I have a corresponding cosine. So in this case let the hat respectively w hat denote, well the coarsening corresponding to the value group to the convex subgroups of the integers.
00:05:57.168 - 00:07:32.476, Speaker C: Namely you can also say this is the finest proper coarsening of v respectively w. So then I get a picture like this. Here I have my fields k and l with residue fields kv and lw, and by assumption the residue fields are isomorphic. And now the residue field of the finest proper coarsening sits in the middle somehow, right? Where this from k to kv hat is the place where v hat with residue field kv hat here variation w hat with residue field lw hat. And here I get an induced valuation here, sorry. Here I get an induced valuation v bar and w bar on the respective valuation which v bar induces on the coarsening v hat. And now what happens is that these middle fields kv hat with the induced valuation v bar and the same for lw hat, is still unramified, right? The value group is z in this, I mean, really is z, because that's the convex subgroup I've taken.
00:07:32.476 - 00:09:08.363, Speaker C: So value group isomorphic to z with, well, the v bar value of p still being one and is complete. Why is it complete? Well, that's just because by Aleph one saturation for this value group, for the valuation v bar, I get spherically completeness, namely that every countable intersection of balls contains an element which implies completeness. Okay, so now a very classical fact, I guess originally claimed by Hasse and Schmidt, though apparently their proof didn't quite work and needed a remedy by Maclean and alternatively proved by Teichmuller and Witt in the same journal. So in the same issue of the same journal. So it says that there is a unique such object. So given a perfect field little k of characteristic p, there is an unremified complete discrete. By discrete I just mean value group isomorphic to z valued field.
00:09:08.363 - 00:10:05.204, Speaker C: The width rings the field of width w of k. Let me denote the valuation on it by v index k. Now with residue field little k. And in fact. So this construction was done by Haasen Schmidt. And what and Witt more or less simultaneously proved is that this field, this valued field is unique up to unique isomorphism. So back in my picture, this tells me because the middle layer, this middle layer is just something of rank one discretely valued over the corresponding residue fields.
00:10:05.204 - 00:11:37.254, Speaker C: And it's complete by saturation. I get that there's also an isomorphism between the middle layers. Okay, and so what am I left with? Well, because the convex subgroup I've divided out by, I want to say the middle layer, which is now marked in whatever turquoise that has characteristic zero, because what I've divided out by is exactly the convex subgroup generated by p. So with respect to the v hat valuation, the value of p is zero. So what I'm saying is the characteristic of k comma kv hat is the same as the characteristic of a comma lw hat is zero, zero. And what do I know? Well, I know the residue fields lw hat and kv hat are isomorphic. But I also know that the value groups are isomorphic, because I've started with two big isomorphic groups, vl and wl, and I've quotiented the same z out of both of them.
00:11:37.254 - 00:13:13.774, Speaker C: So I still get v hat k, it's isomorphic to w hat link. So the excursion Yaschov principle in characteristics zero zero, as we know and love it tells us that these valued fields k with a v hat valuation and l with a double hat, your hat valuation, are elementarily equivalent. So write this proof method going via, that's the proof method somehow going via costening and I believe was first done by Cochin. So am I done now? No, not quite right, because the conclusion I want is that kv is elementarily equivalent to l w. So what you still need to do is to use sort of the following standard trick by Julia Robinson to define an unramified henceilian valuation. So if k v is henceilian and unremified, then the valuation ring ov is already definable in the language of rings, namely via the formula phi of x is there is a y such that y squared is equal to one plus px squared. Well, really, this formula only works for p not equal to two.
00:13:13.774 - 00:15:22.714, Speaker C: For p equals to two, you need to do something slightly different. For example, you can do y squared minus y is equal to two x squared, I think. Okay, so now write this excursion Yershoff principle up here tells me what I'm highlighting now tells me in particular, the fields are elementarily equivalent as fields in the language of rings. And now with Julia Robinson's definition, I get immediately that k v is elementarily equivalent to l w, and with similar versions of, but with similar arguments, you also get the following versions of this, namely what I call the ake relative model completeness, or ake with elementary equivalence as a subscript, namely that you have if you have an embedding of unremified, henceilian valued fields with perfect residue fields, such that this embedding, this embedding induces an embedding of residue fields such which and if that's an elementary embedding and the same for the value groups vk is elementary and wl, then the embedding of valued fields is already elementary. So I want to say you can prove this in a similar way, though it's but the argument is more complicated, but you can also use it, prove it using this coarsening method. Then I guess I'm attributing this to pars. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
00:15:22.714 - 00:17:18.674, Speaker C: I think you can deduce this from Pars's work and from no one before him, but maybe you can deduce it from excursion yajov in a way that I'm not aware of, namely that the residue field kv is stably embedded in the value field k comma v as a pure field. So any subset of kv to the n which is definable in the valued field structure in the valued fields language, is already definable in the language of rings as a subset field of kv. And finally a result by Belair which says that if KV, the residue field is nip, then also the valued field is nip. In a similar way to write Delon's proof of the same fact for equity characteristic zero. Okay, so throughout all this we've had the assumption that the residue field be perfect. So what I want to go through with you today, or what I want to discuss today, is how about imperfect residue fields? Any questions so far still unmunified? Yes, yes, I want to sort of ask the same questions for unramified, but now with imperfect residue fields.
00:17:21.414 - 00:17:26.434, Speaker B: But does this change if you only allow finite qualification.
00:17:27.804 - 00:18:29.146, Speaker C: Well, I'll also talk about finite ramification at the end. So I'll first talk about unramified and imperfect residue field, and then I'll talk about arbitrary residue field and finite ramification at least a bit. Okay, so. And what I'm presenting is joint work with civianschim, unless I'm crediting it otherwise, of course. So the key ingredient somehow was this. In the previous proof was the fact that there is this unique object for this unique complete valuation ring with a given unramified with a given residue field. So the existence of such an object again was claimed by Hase and Schmidt.
00:18:29.146 - 00:19:31.030, Speaker C: And I believe you need something from Maclean to actually make it work. But it says that given a field k of characteristic positive, there is in an unremified, discretely valued field. Let me for now call it c of k, comma vk with residue field letter k. And we call this, this is called a Cohen field over lk. So the existence is just the same as for perfect residue fields. And in fact, also. So that's something which Cohen showed in 46, namely any two Cohen fields, which of course he didn't call Cohen fields, but they've been called.
00:19:31.030 - 00:21:25.944, Speaker C: So since over little k are isomorphic. The big difference to the perfect residue field case is that they're not isomorphic via a unique isomorphism anymore. However, when you look up to our proof, the proof I sketched at the beginning, we only needed the existence of a, I mean, given a isomorphism of the residue fields, we needed the existence of an isomorphism between the corresponding sort of turquoise part, the complete valued fields in the middle. So what I'm saying is the excursion Yazhev principle for imperfect residue fields, just go through with the proof I presented above as before. So if you have two henceilian unremified valued fields, and you get immediately that the valued fields are elementarily equivalent in the language of valued fields, if and only if the residue fields are elementarily equivalent in the language of rings, and the value groups are elementarily equivalent in the language of auditorium groups. So, yeah, great, right. So for this we really needed just uniqueness up to isomorphism of the corresponding discrete, unramified complete valued fields.
00:21:25.944 - 00:22:11.254, Speaker C: Note though, I've written this in a functorial way, c of k v k. That's no longer functorial. I mean, this is no longer rigid by what I, what I mean by rigid is for the construction with perfect residue fields. You actually have that, right? Yeah. For a given copy of your residue field, there is only one, I mean, canonically, there's only one object over it. So there is only one automorphism of the valued field which fixes the residue field. Point wise, this is not true anymore over imperfect residue fields.
00:22:11.254 - 00:24:07.430, Speaker C: So if you want to, in order to reproof these other classical results, which I mentioned, namely excursion, yes, of elementary embedding or stable embeddedness of the residue field, or nip transfer. So in order to understand the other classical results, we need to understand, well, the automorphisms of ck fixing little k, right? I mean, somehow the way I've written I've denoted this is to write it c of k. That's misleading a bit, because it looks as if there was a canonical object. So from now on I'm just going to talk about complete, discrete, unramified valued fields with a given residue field, and I'm going to call them c comma v, where v is always a valuation with my specified residue field. So what do I need to fix in order to make things rigid? Well, I mean, somehow, in an obvious manner, we need to think about p basis of the residue field. So, well, if I have a p basis of my residue field, I can of course pull it by taking a section of the residue map. Basically, I can pull it up into my complete discrete valued field.
00:24:07.430 - 00:26:10.990, Speaker C: So what I want to say is, if I take a p basis, beta of my field, little k, then I call a map s from beta to circle such that if I apply s to an element of b, so I get something in the cone field and then take the residue of it, it's b again. So such a map. So for all b in beta, what is called a map of representatives in an obvious way. Okay? And the secret is that's what we need to know. So Cohen proved in his 46 paper, building on what he calls the teichmuller embedding process, that once you know a map of representatives, you can build the entire cone ring from it, or the entire cone field. When I say cone ring, I mean the valuation ring of that field for the valuation ring, for the valuation with residue. So what Cohen's theorem says that if, assume again I have a field, little k of positive characteristic, and take c one and c two, two cohen fields over this residue field.
00:26:10.990 - 00:27:40.318, Speaker C: Little kid, let beta subset of k be a p basis and Si from beta into CI for I equals one two b maps of representative. Then there is a unique isomorphism of volute fields phi from c one to c two, which commutes with these maps of representatives. So that means which way round is it if I do s one first and then phi. Yeah, it's the same as s two on the resume. Yeah.
00:27:40.486 - 00:27:44.354, Speaker B: What is the edit information when the register is perfect?
00:27:45.094 - 00:28:44.448, Speaker C: Yeah, nothing, right. Then it's nothing, right, because a p basis is just, well, however you want to define a p basis, but maybe a p basis is just given by one. So then really, if the residue field is perfect, right, there are, I mean, these maps of representatives are trivial. So you recreate the uniqueness up to unique isomorphism. I mean, you get the uniqueness up to unique isomorphism. Okay, so using Cohen, I mean, using this Cohen structure theorem as we call it, you can now get, well, you can't quite do the, let me check what the chat says, whether there's a question. Yeah, when the field is perfect, the p basis is empty.
00:28:44.448 - 00:30:18.510, Speaker C: I never know whether the p basis is empty or whether it consists of one element. I. So you can't quite, I mean for, for ake elementary embedding, I guess depending, I mean, as long as you do a proof along the lines of the ake elementary equivalence. Yeah, you need to work harder than for then for the perfect residue field case because you need to take slightly more care. But I mean, you just get the same result as before. So if you have two unramified henceilian valued fields such that the induced embedding of, I mean, one contained in the other such that the induced embedding of residue fields is elementary and the induced embedding of value groups is elementary, then kv is in fact elementary in LW. And so, I mean, in order to prove that, right, what you need to do is to make sure that this elementary embedding statement is you can turn it into something about automorphisms, but you can, you also get stable embeddedness.
00:30:18.510 - 00:31:57.810, Speaker C: So KV is stably embedded in k v as a pure field. So previously, right, when I said stable embeddedness followed from Parse's theorem and none of you has yet given me a better reference than Parse, it was about relative quantifier elimination. Now here you don't have relative quantity, you don't necessarily have relative quantifier elimination anymore, or I don't, I don't want to claim it, at least not today. Let's put it like this. So, but still you can, I mean, you can show stable embeddedness of the residue fields as via an automorphism argument in an right, showing that in a sufficiently saturated model of your theory, automorphisms from the residue field lift to automorphisms on the valued field and you show that more or less using exactly the same trick as before, namely you lift them up by rank one and then, well, maybe you lift them up by stable embeddedness in equi characteristic zero, although that doesn't quite work because you're not necessarily saturated anymore.
00:31:57.842 - 00:32:04.784, Speaker A: But there's a question in the chat of do you also have stable embeddedness of the value group?
00:32:05.324 - 00:33:15.744, Speaker C: So yes, you do. And it's, I mean, I think what works is that, I mean, the statement is, yeah, for any, certainly VK is stably embedded as a pure audit debating group. But in order to prove that, I mean, if you give an automorphism argument of that, that's no different for imperfect or perfect, I mean, that doesn't depend on the residue field at all. That's what I want to say. But yes, so that's also true. And we also get the nip transfer statement. And this is, maybe I should say this is really why Sylvia and I started looking at the model theory of cone fields at all, because we wanted to get, well, we wanted to find out whether there are henceilian valued nip fields with imperfect residue fields.
00:33:15.744 - 00:34:41.148, Speaker C: And we thought, well, there should be. But in order to prove that, we need some kind of nip transfer theorem. And of course for, right in for a nip field of positive characteristics, since we know it to be Rt and Schreier closed, unless it's finite, the residue fields of all henceilian valuations on it, well, of all valuations on it in fact are perfect. So the only examples of imperfect residue fields are exactly of those kinds. Hence fields unremified or finitely ramified with imperfect residue fields which are nip. So what I want to say is kv, nip implies k comma v nip. And here you very much can't use the Belair argument anymore, but you want to prove it using the proof methods done first by Chernikov and hills, where they prove NTP, two transfer via sort of properties they call understanding immediate extensions and stable embeddedness.
00:34:41.148 - 00:35:41.544, Speaker C: So that's exactly so, stable embeddedness, right? Is the point beforehand. This is why I was, why we were interested in stable embeddedness and controlling immediate extensions is very easy in complete, or is entirely possible in complete discrete valued fields. And that's again at the heart of it. So an example for this, now that I talked about Nip fields with nip and syrian valued fields with imperfect residue fields. So you take somehow kv a separately closed field which is not perfect. So whatever FPT zip, that's of course nip. And so any, now I write it in the functorial way again, but any Cohen field over that is nip.
00:35:41.544 - 00:36:07.160, Speaker C: Of course, also with evaluation, because the valuation is zero. Definable. By the Julia Robinson trick I showed you at the beginning of the talk. Okay. That's what I wanted to say about unremified ancillary and valued fields. Do you want. I mean, are there questions, before I go on to finitely ramified ancillary invalid fields?
00:36:07.352 - 00:36:08.624, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a question.
00:36:08.744 - 00:36:09.444, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:10.664 - 00:36:27.914, Speaker B: What about doing all this after you name a substructure? Because this should be, I don't know, more equivalent to the elimination of quantifiers. I mean, take a substructure and name it, then do this axe cultural shock.
00:36:31.174 - 00:36:58.814, Speaker C: I mean. Yeah. The question is what precisely? I mean, do you want to name any substructure? Yeah. You want to add constants? Yeah. Adding constants is something which doesn't go well with decidability in general. Right. There are decidable fields which have a finite extension which is undecidable.
00:37:02.674 - 00:37:03.774, Speaker B: No, but I'm.
00:37:04.914 - 00:37:15.324, Speaker C: Maybe I didn't understand the question. Also, I can't hear you very well yet here. Oh, sorry. I mean, okay, I hear you're cutting in and out, so I'm. I'm vaguely guessing what you said.
00:37:19.864 - 00:37:26.084, Speaker B: Oh, no, I'm saying that we can discuss it later, but I'm saying naming a substructure, not.
00:37:27.784 - 00:37:41.452, Speaker C: Naming constants. And, yeah, I don't think there is anything wrong. I mean, yeah, that something will go wrong if you name the substructure.
00:37:41.508 - 00:37:48.504, Speaker B: All I'm saying, this should be at least somehow equivalent to what we said before, that wanted to eliminate field quantifiers.
00:37:51.444 - 00:38:36.364, Speaker C: Yes. Yes, you can name substructure and eliminate field quantifiers. Yeah, I think you're right. Sylvia and I are still trying to understand what the best language is to eliminate field quantifiers. And let's put it like this, and we've had many languages, but still we are not satisfied to having found the right one with a capital r somehow. So that's why I'm not talking about quantify elimination, because we still feel we've not yet reached what we want to prove. So let me say something about finite ramification.
00:38:36.364 - 00:39:54.664, Speaker C: Let me define first what finite ramification means, although I assume that most of you will know it. So, a valued field of mixed characteristic is called finitely ramified if the interval between zero and the value of p in the value group is finite. So there's only finitely many elements which positive value, but value less or equal to p. So in order to describe the theory of a finitely ramified field, we will certainly need to fix the degree, I mean, the number of elements which are between zero and the value of p. So that's called the degree. I mean, that's the degree of ramification e, which is a positive natural number. And what I mean by is that is the value between z zero and the value of p.
00:39:54.664 - 00:41:23.910, Speaker C: This interval has e many elements. So what's well known, without any further assumptions, is that elementary equivalence, the excursion Jeschev theorem for elementary equivalence fails. So, eg, you take two quadratic extensions of q three. Say these two, they are distinct, they have different algebraic part, right? They have it. They have different theories as well. They're both extensions of qp or of q three, sorry, with e equals to two in obvious ways, the residue field, because the value group, they're quadratic extensions. So if I, by the fundamental equality in discrete valued fields, I get the relative fields must still be f three.
00:41:23.910 - 00:42:40.210, Speaker C: But you can also very easily check it. And of course the value group is isomorphic to zoom because it's a finite extension of q three. But of course, I mean, as I said, they have different algebraic parts, right? So q three, joint square root of three is not elementary equivalent to q three, joint square root of six. So in order to, to understand elementary equivalence, you need to talk about, you need to add constants. What I want to show you now is that also for finite ramification, stable embeddedness of the residue field fails, or may fail. So in order to do that, I take, for what I find the easiest example, I take an extension of fp by two algebraically independent elements, alpha one and alpha two, algebraically independent. And this is my residue, I mean this I will take as my residue field.
00:42:40.210 - 00:43:36.702, Speaker C: And of course now there exists a sigma. I write sigma bar because it's an automorphism on the residue field in odd k, which exchanges alpha one and alpha two. Sigma of sigma bar of alpha one is equal to alpha two. We also write sigma bar of alpha two is equal to alpha one. So now I take an unramified, hence volume kv with that given residue field, and I take an a one in k with residue field with residue, exactly. This first element, say alpha one. And now I look at the finite extension of k, which is finitely ramified.
00:43:36.702 - 00:45:11.062, Speaker C: Namely, I adjoin the square root of pa one. So this gives me, right, this gives me an extension of ramification degree two, because pa one is an element of value one and it now has a root and of course. So v is ancillary evaluation, so it extends uniquely. So this is in a canonical way, a valued field two l l v is finitely ramified. The residue field is still k, and the extension of the value groups, no value groups is of degree two. So the ramification degree is two. And then you check, then a contains no square root of p, of a one of p times a, sorry, of p times a two, where a two is any lift of alpha two.
00:45:11.062 - 00:46:07.884, Speaker C: And that's because alpha one and alpha two are algebraically independent. You can deduce that from alpha one and alpha two being algebraically independent, what you need them to be is into two different square classes in little kitchen. So I claim that hence sigma bar does not lift to sigma to an automorphism sigma of l. I guess in the interest of time, right, you just work it out. I mean, otherwise, if you take a sigma which would lift sigma bar, then, well, in fact, it would send pa one to, it would send the square root of pa one to a square root of pa two. You just work it out. And note that, I mean, this example works just as well with perfect residue fields.
00:46:07.884 - 00:46:35.554, Speaker C: I mean, you can give a similar example with perfect residue fields. So you think all is lost. However, we can still prove that if you can still prove nip transfer. So if kv is finitely ramified.
00:46:39.414 - 00:46:39.782, Speaker B: There'S.
00:46:39.798 - 00:46:42.678, Speaker A: A question of whether it would suffice to add constants.
00:46:42.846 - 00:47:28.520, Speaker C: Yes. I mean, yes, I think it suffices to add constants. Yes. Sorry, I didn't see the question. No, you need to add constants for a. Yeah, for, I guess for the coefficients of an Eisenstein polynomial. So for nip transfer, we can prove nonetheless that if you have a finitely ramified henceilian valued field, then if kv is nip, then the valued field is nip.
00:47:28.520 - 00:48:43.654, Speaker C: That's just because, well, a complete, discretely valued, finitely ramified valued field is always a finite extension of a complete unremified, hence the invalid field over the same residue field. And now of course, if the smaller field is nip by the nip transfer theorem for unremified, hence the value fields, then the bigger field which is interpretable in the smaller field is still nip. And, well, I guess that's really why we tried to, why we tried for quite a while to prove stable embeddedness of the residue field as a pure field. And when we failed, we realized, well, it's because it doesn't hold. But the nip transfer, which we're interested in, still holds. And interestingly, the ake model completeness or elementary equivalence also still holds. And I'm sure someone must have recorded that for perfect residue field somewhere.
00:48:43.654 - 00:49:47.594, Speaker C: I just don't know where. So I can't, yeah, I guess I can't correctly attribute it. So if you have two finitely ramified, henceilian valued fields of the same ramification degree, e positive, then, well, you get what you think. If the residue fields sit elementarily in each other and the value groups do two, then the same works for the valued field. Okay, that's what I wanted to tell you. I welcome any questions?
00:49:49.694 - 00:49:54.034, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Are there any questions?
00:50:04.374 - 00:50:12.474, Speaker D: Oh, I was wondering, maybe this is a dumb question. Are there simple examples of imperfect nip fields other than separately closed fields?
00:50:15.514 - 00:50:47.934, Speaker C: Yeah, because I mean, you can start, I mean, I guess you start with a separately closed field and you turn it, you take this as your, you take this as your residue field, often algebraically maximal Kaplansky field. Right? So you take whatever a power series field over it with p divisible value group, and then you can still insert that as your residue field. And I guess we believe that should be all.
00:50:48.554 - 00:50:50.154, Speaker D: I mean, wait, I thought you said.
00:50:50.234 - 00:50:52.234, Speaker C: Conjectures tells us that should be all.
00:50:52.394 - 00:51:05.614, Speaker D: I thought that you said that if a field is positive characteristic, then if it's like echo characteristic p, then the residue in its alien, then the residue field is not, is not as perfect.
00:51:06.054 - 00:51:41.054, Speaker C: Yes, I, yeah, you're right. I said that and. Yeah, so I know, but. Sorry, I said that and, but they are sorry, they are separately algebraically maxima non. Yeah, okay, I. You're right and I said it wrong. So they are separately algebraically maxima non perfect valued fields which are not separately closed with then algebraically closed residue field.
00:51:41.054 - 00:52:09.726, Speaker C: Can I give an example? I'm not sure. I guess, yeah, but they exist. I think about an example. There.
00:52:09.750 - 00:52:10.994, Speaker A: Any other questions?
00:52:16.934 - 00:52:42.474, Speaker C: Somehow, the point is, by this they can at most, I mean on an nip field that can at most be one henceilian valuation with imperfect residue field. And in this case it must be the cautious one of mixed characteristic. And it must come out of a cosming with value group Z. I mean it must come out of a middle part with value group Z.
00:52:55.134 - 00:52:58.474, Speaker A: So let's thank Francisco again for a wonderful talk.
00:52:58.934 - 00:52:59.734, Speaker C: Thank you for listening.
