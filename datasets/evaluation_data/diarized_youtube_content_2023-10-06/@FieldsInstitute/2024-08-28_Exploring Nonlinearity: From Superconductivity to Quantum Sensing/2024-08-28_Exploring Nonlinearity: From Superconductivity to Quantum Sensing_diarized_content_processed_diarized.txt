00:00:00.320 - 00:00:25.953, Speaker A: Hi everyone. The first talk after lunch. It's nothing better than combining microwave and in optical systems. I mean you can see it from the title quite broad. So I will not talk about all of those areas. The quantum sensing is just a sort of motivation for you to convince you why quantum mechanics is actually very important. So in my team we do a lot of research in different areas.
00:00:25.953 - 00:01:07.795, Speaker A: As you can see it quite broad. In principle. I'm working the boundary of micro and optic in my team. Meaning that if you build quantum computers using superconducting technology, how can you connect to future quantum computers using optical link? That's extremely challenging task, but I will not talk about that. But it's a verification to explain why I'm working on both optic and superconducting system. Because you want to develop both structures and then connecting the two wavelengths is like the two subsystems in the quantum structures. So if you're looking at these topics today, I'll talk about the red boxes here.
00:01:07.795 - 00:01:42.805, Speaker A: The green one as I mentioned is the motivation mainly. But all four boxes we are working on. I think technology is based on something which is extremely important. That's not any new quantum mechanics. A lot of technology we're developing is based on the nonlinearity and they're really important because nonlinearity you can consider as a quantum resource. And in principle of the quantum optic description. Sometimes we can bring up examples of four wave mixing and two wave mixing as the quite well known types of nonlinearity in quantum optic.
00:01:42.805 - 00:02:29.891, Speaker A: So where the quantumness really can coming out from this in terms of application is really generating entanglement. Non classical emission is one of the examples of using nonlinearity in quantum systems. So what I will do today for the four wave mixing I focus on optical domain, meaning that my talk will be in the few hundred terahertz. And then for the two wave mixing I'll switch the gear and go for superconducting system, which you can develop amplifiers much easier than optical domain. So let's start with four wave mixing. And what is the application? Again this is I just very briefly explain about one of the main applications of this. And in fact we trying to build what we call quantum microscope.
00:02:29.891 - 00:03:16.749, Speaker A: I do not talk about that. So in principle you can use Nandini in quantum optic to develop microscope and new types of imaging system to somehow and maybe in future you can compete with existing a very advanced classical imaging system, which typically they have some challenges like they're invasive. For example, if you're using X ray for imaging, they have sometimes low resolution, they slow and Quite expensive. So in one of the effort we do, it's taking one of the crystals, we buy them and then we inject light pump to this. Using the four wave mixing, you can generate what we call iodine. There were some talks about that today in principles. You can see this bulk crystal is bulky.
00:03:16.749 - 00:03:42.107, Speaker A: So when you dealing with bulk, there are some good and bad things about the bulk. One of the big challenges about bulkiness is the CNID you generate. The photon pair generation is not so efficient. You pump the system with, I don't know, 60 milliwatt power. What you, whatever you get out is not really. You don't generate a lot of photons, not efficient at all. So that will impact the future application.
00:03:42.107 - 00:04:22.333, Speaker A: For example, if you want to develop what we call quantum CT scan system and try to make some images, the image is quite blurry if you're using single photon and coincidences in the hydrogen signal. So there are some ways to resolve this problem. Again, one of the main problem coming from the inefficient the process you have. Because the crystal you have is a bulk material, it has defect and a lot of imperfection. You can solve some of the problems, for example by using the machine learning technique that we are developing in terms of the commercial aspect of this. But that's just a remedy. We don't solve the problem.
00:04:22.333 - 00:04:55.285, Speaker A: We just have the data coming from the photon pairs we generated, which we don't have enough of them. We try to solve some of the problems using the machine learning postprocess, but that's not the solution. So what is the solution? That's where now I'm talking about integration. So if you have the bulk and bring it down, make it smaller and smaller. You do the integration like you make things smaller. So you have a lot of energy concentrate in a very small point. So based on that, most likely you can make the emission and photon pair generation way more efficient.
00:04:55.285 - 00:05:18.649, Speaker A: So I'll talk about two topics. Nonlinearity in topological photonic insulators and in superconducting system. Again, both of them are. We have motivations for them future you want to combine both of them for photon transaction. Let's start with the first part. For now just I only talk about optical domain 15 nanometer. Everything is telecom, so no superconducting system.
00:05:18.649 - 00:05:56.843, Speaker A: Please don't be confused for now. So what is a topological system? Sometimes people are confused with topology versus geometry. If you're starting with that dot here A, you're starting to deform it and you have ABCD different geometries you can see the geometry is changing when you deform the system. But then the topology of the system stays the same for all of them, except for D. When you make a hole in the structure, you change the topology of the system. And the way topology changes is just really. I said in a discrete manner.
00:05:56.843 - 00:06:37.085, Speaker A: So you make a jump in the topology of the system when you're making hole. I do not go through the entire topic of the topology versus geometry. We don't really needed, but we can really look at this property in optical domain topological system, for example, they have this sort of periodic band gap structure. And you can build them using different types of photonic system, integrated photonic system, using coupled ring resonators, photonic crystals, waveguides and fiber. Often if they are coupled, you can building this band gap structure and you can have topology consistent. Again, I do not go through the details. We don't really need this for now.
00:06:37.085 - 00:07:06.295, Speaker A: So what is the important thing about this? Don't forget the problem. We have nonlinearity. We want to make photon pair generation or whatever we try to use more efficient. So we decided to have the bulk make it smaller. We do the integration right. That was a target. But then when you make the sample smaller and smaller microscales, you become way more sensitive to a lot of imperfection you might have in the system.
00:07:06.295 - 00:07:40.085, Speaker A: Cracks, dust, fabrication imperfection. All of them can affect the performance of your chip. How can you resolve that? So one of the properties of the topological system you have, they are robust against some sort of defects in the chip. Like if you have you build a photonic system, if you have a crack, most probably doesn't see the crack. It can just pass over. And then you still have the good efficiency in the system. That's where we want to now combine nonlinearity in the chip.
00:07:40.085 - 00:08:14.775, Speaker A: We have a topological system. And then based on that, designing something a chip which can give you better performance in terms of the photon pair generation. How can we do that? So the main goal here for me is combining topology with nonlinearity. Material nonlinearity we have like in silicon, for example. So what is the system we try to build? Just consider some micro ring resonator, 1550 nanometer. We have those resonators all coupled. I call this a unit cell.
00:08:14.775 - 00:08:35.717, Speaker A: This unit cell doesn't have any band gap system. If you just copy them and then scaling up, you don't see any bandgap structure. So something way more interesting happened. If you say to rotate one of them, making a kind of defect in sort of the coupling. Now you can See it, you have two types of coupling in this unit cell. You have this coupling. I showed that with theta A is right.
00:08:35.717 - 00:09:00.081, Speaker A: And then now you make this coupling different from the other three. So what happened? When you do this and do the simulation, you can immediately figure out the structure has this band gap system periodically. And then I wrote some numbers here. Those are the churn number, winding number, Chern number is zero. So winding number is not zero. We call this flickered topological system. But it has topological property.
00:09:00.081 - 00:09:29.919, Speaker A: Forget about the flick, it forget about winding number, chern number. What you have to learn here is, I mean you have to learn here is the unit cell has some topological property. Okay, so then when you're looking at this band gap, you can see I have two black lines. Those are what I call them edge state. Those edges say they don't talk to each other, but they exist in the band gap of the system. What are they? So I call this edge state. So there should be some edge that state.
00:09:29.919 - 00:10:02.769, Speaker A: It's existing that edge for the system. Where is that edge? So if I do the simulation, scaling up the unit cell, just copy and pasting and do the simulation. So if I now inject light in this corner, the light can propagate the edge of the chip. As you can see, that's one of the modes we had two edged states, two crossing. So where is the other one? If I inject the light here, depends on the direction you inject. You can activating this edge state. That's where you have two edge states.
00:10:02.769 - 00:10:25.647, Speaker A: So what was the promise? The topological property allows me to really have some protection against some defect in the system. Can we see that in experiment? The answer is yes. So now let's consider I can remove one of the resonators. That's a defect. Let's say, I don't know, accidentally the chip is broken. That section can like propagates over. The answer is yes.
00:10:25.647 - 00:10:47.745, Speaker A: So you can see a simulation predicts it's go over, it goes over and then propagates again. So it seems like simulation somehow predicts this behavior. Can we do this experiment against. Yes, this is the unit cell of the system. You can see it. We don't. In order to have this sort of defect in the coupling, we remove one of the resonators.
00:10:47.745 - 00:11:08.863, Speaker A: But you don't need to remove it. In principle, it's enough to not having the same coupling. So what you see is a silicon chip including 300 ring resonators. All of them are coupled. It has a band gap system structure. And you can looking at the Topological property of this. So how can we verify that? If I inject light here, it's only propagate the edge of the chip, indicating of having edges in the system.
00:11:08.863 - 00:11:29.487, Speaker A: But then we notice about something way more interesting. You see that section? We have those lines here that says zoom in. That's a heater we have in the system. So when heating up one local point, what happened? You change in the refractive index of the system. So when you change the refractive index, that's a defect. It acts like a defect. You want to simulate existing defect.
00:11:29.487 - 00:11:54.787, Speaker A: So we notice about something very interesting. If you change the property of this heater, this heater enough, then you can trap light in a loop. So trapping light in a loop, that reminds you of something. That's a resonator. In a resonator, like a fabric pro cavity, you have two mirrors. You can trap light inside. So now the topological property of this system allows you to trap light in a loop.
00:11:54.787 - 00:12:26.935, Speaker A: So what happened? You create a local node, a resonator in the system using topological property. That's interesting. I can turn off and on this I can switch the sweep the resonant frequency. And depends where do you have the heater. You can activate multiple type of resonators, resonant modes in modes in the system. So we call that flickered defect mode resonator fdmr. So remember the FDMR because I'll use this a lot.
00:12:26.935 - 00:12:47.763, Speaker A: Let's look at this. This is the camera we have. We looked at the chip in a very dark area. You can see the age state exists. When we turn on the heater, we can trap light in the chip. So it seems like the experiment also immediately proved the existing of this fdmr. How can we look at the transmission? The transmission you can see for red line.
00:12:47.763 - 00:13:17.455, Speaker A: We don't have the heater on. If the heater is off. When we turn on the heater, we have very nice mode appear. Actually the quality factor for this mode is better than bare resonator like secant resonator. If you just have a ring resonator, copper to waveguide, we have better quality factor approaching 10 to 5 for this chip. So can we see this like clearly? The answer is yes. This point is where I shine the laser.
00:13:17.455 - 00:13:51.057, Speaker A: This is the wavelength and this is the chip. Under the CCD camera we have what I do, I sweep the laser. When I hit the bulk, the middle of the chip shining up. When I hit the edge, the light only stays at the edge of the chip. Let's see if that really is the Case So you can see I'm moving the lol. Now we hit the bulk. The entire bulk will shining up and then when you go to the edge of the chip, it will stay at the edge of the chip.
00:13:51.057 - 00:14:17.499, Speaker A: So clearly has topological property including the edge state. So this is the chip. Now we looked at the emission from the system. The main goal was combining 98 system 4 wave mixing. And I'm combining all of the what we talked about. We had four wave mixing the system. We have topology property.
00:14:17.499 - 00:14:45.779, Speaker A: Now we want to combine them and have testing if the system really acts as it should. So how do we do that? We have the FDMR in the system. We pump the system in the middle. You can see it. We pump the system in the middle and then look at the signal and either in different FSR and figure out if we can measure the coincidence in the system. This is the result. You can see this is gsi, the second order correlation function with respect to time.
00:14:45.779 - 00:15:15.973, Speaker A: We have a huge peak appears in the system due to this the four wave mixing process and the chip. If this is a non classic or not. We can define or violating Cauchy Schwarzenegger inequality. Using this equation. You can see Gamma is way bigger than the age state alone. So it's a kind of indication of Gamma is bigger than one indicating non classicality. What about coin card Coincident to accidental rate is a huge improvement compared to edge state.
00:15:15.973 - 00:15:53.939, Speaker A: Seems like it works. But is this really non classical entangled? We looked at the entanglement emission from the system using front scene tetrometry. And you can immediately see it when you split the emission to long and short passes. Depends on the phase you inject in the system. You can make the middle peak almost fully disappear with 97% almost visibility indicating of having entanglement perfect. So that was silicon optic silicon is great. But the nanotin silicon is weak.
00:15:53.939 - 00:16:12.987, Speaker A: You don't have a lot of nanometers. That's a big challenge for optical domain. We don't have this problem in microwave system superconducting system. What's the reason? Again my field is photon. It's a microwave optical transfection. We work in both areas. We want to have some defect free microwave transducer for future.
00:16:12.987 - 00:16:44.595, Speaker A: So that's where now we have to also learn a little bit about the superconducting section. My background in fact is superconducting coming from mainly superconducting world. So that's where now you can talk about amplifiers, amplifications and if we have some sort of types of physics. Also here the answer is yes. In superconducting system you can get nonlinearity. Again, I love nonlinearity. You can get nonlinearity using artificial atoms you might build.
00:16:44.595 - 00:17:17.553, Speaker A: So you can call that Joseph junction has huge nonlinearity. Or you can get it from the materials itself. Like. Like silicon for example, has some nonlinearity. In superconducting system you might have some materials which they have nonlinearity. So in principle, why this the entire concept here it's really around amplification. Why do you need amplifiers in quantum systems and superconducting structures? That's mainly due to the fact that in micro domain is low frequency, you have a lot of thermal noise in the system.
00:17:17.553 - 00:17:52.793, Speaker A: And when you're dealing with those dilution refrigerator, you put your sample here, you have a lot of attenuators in the past. Like those are the attenuators. Because you want to really get rid of things interagency noise coming in and suppress entire noise to not reaching you qubit here down there. So but then why do you need amplifiers? Because the emission coming from the system, it's extremely weak. Like let's say from whatever microwave qubit you might have superconducting qubit you might have. So you have to amplify the system using quantum limited amplifiers. So I call that quantum limited amplifiers.
00:17:52.793 - 00:18:22.261, Speaker A: And amplification is quite central there. It's just not about amplifiers. Amplifiers in principle, you can split them down in two types in general. Degenerate and non degenerate amplifiers and quantum optic. And for non degenerate amplifier you're dealing with two modes. This can lead to phase insensitive amplifier or two modes squeezing or generating entanglement for many other applications. Or you can pick degenerate amplifiers, which both signal idlers, they have exactly similar mode.
00:18:22.261 - 00:18:58.609, Speaker A: That's what you call single mode. So this is a general definition. You can categorizing amplifiers based on those two. So for example degenerate amplifier, they can give you phase sensitive amplification or single mode squeezing applications can be for example in ligo. So learning from that, how can we do this? In using Joseph injunction, I just bring some examples. You can use single Jolson junction, for example, you have in the system to generate squeeze light and also amplify the signal. You can use the ring of the chain of the Joseph injunctions.
00:18:58.609 - 00:19:23.135, Speaker A: Or you can using traveling wave amplifier as a concept. Actually we borrowed that from optic, which you have edfa, Airbnb doped fibers. You have a fiber, you dope it with erbium. And then when light propagates or you can get amplification. Similar concept exists in the tupa. You have a chain of the junctions. Then when light propagates over them, you can building up the amplification.
00:19:23.135 - 00:19:54.405, Speaker A: You have gain. This are perfect. But they are very sensitive to a lot of imperfection. You might have a lot of heating, a lot of isolation. A lot of heating can in fact so affecting the performance of this Josephine based systems. But similar to silicon. Can we use nanometine superconducting system in gigahertz frequency and get amplification by squeezing? The answer is yes.
00:19:54.405 - 00:20:19.063, Speaker A: How can you do that? You can use materials like nadine, titanium, nitride. It's a kinetic inductance amp materials. And then you can build something very simple out of this. So what is the system? This is the resonator. You can see this ring. It's my resonator working at 8 GHz for example. So now frequency I shifted from telecom to frequency, microwave frequency.
00:20:19.063 - 00:20:43.657, Speaker A: And then when you have photons inside the system, you can get amplification because of the nonlinear property of this material. You have. So we also have another resonator coupled capacitively. You can see that zoom in resonator. So we have two resonators in the system. The ring is one of them. And then we have a L shaped resonator in this side that says zoom in.
00:20:43.657 - 00:20:59.285, Speaker A: So we have two modes. For now I just focus on one of the resonators. For now. The first thing is you can tune the resonant frequency of this. That's a resonant frequency by applying just current in the system. So it's really tunable resonator. And you can use this to get amplification.
00:20:59.285 - 00:21:25.819, Speaker A: How do you do that? If you're looking at by solving the equations of motion and then looking at the full output of the system depends on two terms like two brackets. You can see it. You have the A and a dagger. That's like a single mode squeezing the system. And some noise appear in the system. And those are the gain factors for this amplifiers. Can we confirm the existing amplification? The answer is yes.
00:21:25.819 - 00:21:49.173, Speaker A: This is the gain with respect to detuning. You can get up to near 50dB gain the system of course the very narrow band structure. And you can change the property of this with respect to the phase. When you change the looking at the gain which depends on the phase. That's the indication of the squeezing in the system. But it's not exactly squeezing. For now we have to prove the existence of the squeezing.
00:21:49.173 - 00:22:12.595, Speaker A: So now the good thing about this is the gain with respect to the power. The saturation is way better than just injection. For Joseph Junction. Typically the saturation happens around this point. But you can see it, we have near 30dB improvement in terms of the saturation. That's perfect for the amplifiers actually you can use. So this was a single mode squeezing, but then we have more advanced.
00:22:12.595 - 00:22:29.675, Speaker A: So for the single mode squeezing we're using three wave mixing in principle. Now you have two cavities. We had two resonators, if you remember the ring resonator and the L shape. They are coupled. One of them doesn't have nonlinearity. The other one it does actually contains nonlinearity. Three wave.
00:22:29.675 - 00:23:02.443, Speaker A: So what happens if you couple the two systems together and they can hop photons? Can you have two modes squeezing or two mode amplification? The answer is yes. Let's consider one of the resonators has this nonlinearity. That's a three wave mixing process. You have the pump in the system and then you can generate Eigen signal at the same frequency. That degenerates situation I talked about. But then the photons can hop back and forth between the two resonators. Can we now see the amplification in both of the modes which they are separate from each other? The answer is yes.
00:23:02.443 - 00:23:40.711, Speaker A: So we look at this behavior. One of them is not tunable, the other one is tunable. We bring this mode in the anti crossing point. When you park it in the anti crossing point you can exchange energy between the two resonators. Again one of them is just nonlinear in the system. If you go into the collective like the effective Hamiltonian you can see the effective Hamiltonian for this system contains the single mode squeezing and actually some cross terms which is two modes squeezing the system. So it's very interesting this coupled nonlinear coupled resonators, they can give you both single mode and two mode squeezing.
00:23:40.711 - 00:24:05.031, Speaker A: Depends on the detuning you have in this chart. So and when you're looking at the amplification you can see four bubbles appear in the anti crossing point. You have two modes, both of them showing the amplification. Bingo. The theory perfectly match with the experimental side we have. What about noise compared to Joseph Injunction systems? We are really doing a very good job. We're adding near 0.3
00:24:05.031 - 00:24:39.027, Speaker A: quantum noise to the system. But the difference here is we can operate the system up to near five Kelvin. So that's something you cannot do with JOSE injection. So it's a really high temperature. The system is resilient against the like noise is Coming from the temperature in the cryogenic system. So all of them, whatever I talked about for superconducting system, there is no indication of non classicality. Where is the non classicality in the system? We apply the system into like try to looking at the squeezing and entanglement, this quantum system.
00:24:39.027 - 00:25:09.933, Speaker A: So what we have here in principle we have again the ring resonator. That was where we can have the amplification. We have the magnetic system is the result really whatever we get, is it squeezing or not? So squeezing here means we don't inject anything to the ports. We are now almost near vacuum, meaning that we cool down the system to 7 millikelvin. 7 millikelvin. If you're working at 8 gigahertz, you almost don't have any population left in the system. So he's really starting from vacuum.
00:25:09.933 - 00:25:43.553, Speaker A: I mean it's approximately vacuum, meaning that there is no input to the system, is just vacuum coming in. So you're activating the system. You pump the system twice of the frequency because that's a phase matching condition you have to fulfill. And then you're looking at the resonant frequency of this resonator and figure out if you have the squeezing or not. So effectively this is a fabric pro cavity. Effectively you can have a Chi2 material as a three wave mixing process. As I said, you can pump the system twice the frequency.
00:25:43.553 - 00:26:13.679, Speaker A: Looking at the output of the system and figure out if it's squeezed or if they're entangled. How do we do this? We put the sample in a cryogenic environment. As you can see it, we operate this at 7 millikelvin. And looking at the emission coming out from this, so we do vacuum noise amplification. So the vacuum noise amplification, if you don't have a lot of noise in the chip, it can show you the squeezing wearing time. So we have two modes. You can see it from both ports we have the resonant frequencies.
00:26:13.679 - 00:26:37.089, Speaker A: We can measure them so we notice about something. We developed the theory for this. Look at the quadratures for the system. We have this quadrature squeezing appears for a just simple example. If the coupling to both port are symmetric, meaning that if the etas are exactly half, we can ending up to this quadrature in the system C. Here is the cooperativity. We define the cooperativity.
00:26:37.089 - 00:27:07.819, Speaker A: And if C is one, then you can reach one over four below half. That's smaller than half. When you go below half, that means you have squeezing in the system. Let's see if that experiment can prove that we looked at the this, this the violation of the Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen. Based on this, meaning that you have two quadratures. You're looking at the variances between two. If that's smaller than one, that's an indication of not only squeezing, but also the entanglement.
00:27:07.819 - 00:27:40.815, Speaker A: So first of all, we looked at the quadrature for both of them. You can see that we can go below half by near 2 dB. Squeezing is not a lot with respect to the power. Is this entanglement density? Yes, we can go below 1, indicating of existing entanglement in the system. And also we looked at the logarithm negativity, another figure that you can really calculate. And based on that you can verify if the state you have is it's entangled. So it seems like it really works.
00:27:40.815 - 00:28:17.081, Speaker A: So what did we learn so far? I really tried to explain. And it is a very important resource in quantum optics in general, in quantum mechanics. You can use it for quantum sensing. It's like imaging is one potential applications. But how do you really play with this N to make it more efficient? That's something you can do a lot of work on it. I talked about the topological system for more efficient photon generation. And also amplification and squeezing the micro domain using superconducting structure, mainly kinetic inductance amplifiers.
00:28:17.081 - 00:28:40.225, Speaker A: So with that, thank you very much and amazing work by my student often really they did a good job to do this combining experiment from micronautic. And then we slowly using those two systems for microwave optical transaction at high temperature. More than like higher than one Kelvin principle for quantum communication. Future quantum communication applications. Thank you very much.
