00:00:00.400 - 00:00:10.954, Speaker A: Chantal David from Concordia University, Montreal. She will talk to us about one level density of families of Heke alpha. Go ahead, Chantal.
00:00:11.654 - 00:00:21.470, Speaker B: So I'll try to speak loud. Sorry for the people on Zoom. I hope you can hear me. If you really can't hear me, you should tell me because it's kind of silly that I talk and nobody hears me. So first.
00:00:21.542 - 00:00:22.902, Speaker A: But now we can hear you.
00:00:22.998 - 00:00:43.574, Speaker B: Okay? So I'd like to thank the organizer. It's a very nice event. I'm sorry I had to cancel at the last moment. And thank you for allowing me to speak on Zoom. And of course, happy birthday, Ram. So the work I'm going to talk about is joint work with Lucind Devi and Ezra Waxman. So now I cannot move the slides.
00:00:43.574 - 00:00:49.734, Speaker B: Okay, there's a little problem that I don't control.
00:00:50.434 - 00:00:52.130, Speaker A: Okay, this is again our fault.
00:00:52.242 - 00:01:01.614, Speaker B: No, no, this is me. It's just because I don't remember how to do that. Okay, it's like that. There's a little button here. It's a long time I didn't give a talk on Zoom. I'm sorry. I forgot how they were.
00:01:01.614 - 00:01:35.636, Speaker B: Okay, I want to talk. The one level density of families of L function. So my families of L function will be l function of a grossing character c over z of I. So it's the summation over all. The ideal c of a divided by the norm of e to the s and by unit factorization is the product over prime. So the one level density will measure the density of the zero on the critical line one half plus I t around s equal one two. So the low lying zero, and of course on average over the family.
00:01:35.636 - 00:02:39.200, Speaker B: The only way to get a statistic is to average over the family. So from the random model statistics on the zeros of L function, they will correspond to statistics on the eigenvalue of random matrices in symmetry group, and the group can be unitary, symplectic, or orthogonal. So maybe a better way to say that actually is that if the zeros correspond to the eigenvalue, then the l function will correspond to the characteristic polynomial of the matrix, because the eigenvalues are a zero of the characteristic polynomial, and the characteristic polynomial is a very easy object to understand. If I take a matrix, and by the way, those matrix are matrix with complex coefficient, if I take a unitary matrix over c, then I can write the characteristic polynomial, which is the determinant of one minus. Um, and now this is a unitary matrix. So all the eigenvalues have size one. So here's the characteristic polynomial, one minus u to the I theta j of m, I denote the eigenvalue by I theta j of m and n is the size of the matrix.
00:02:39.200 - 00:03:00.064, Speaker B: So, if the characteristic polynomial of random matrix correspond to l function, they should have a functional equation. And of course, their functional equation is very easy. If I replace u by one minus u in this equation, by the fact that all the roots are the same size, so I replace u by one minus u. I get here, can you see my mouse when I do that?
00:03:01.644 - 00:03:04.308, Speaker A: Yes, no, yes, we can see your mouse.
00:03:04.396 - 00:03:45.408, Speaker B: Okay, thank you. If I replace this u that I'm pointing with the little m by one over u, well, I'm going to take the u out, do a couple of elementary transformation. Everybody can do that. And I'm going to get something which looks very much like what I started, except I have the roots which are conjugate and I forgot to write square root of m. But this is me, that's not a difference. So what does it give? It gives that if I do the functional equation of this characteristic polynomial, I'm going to get a sign of a functional equation, some factor u to the minus n times the same function conjugate evaluated at the point u. And of course, with the customary notation that u is q to the minus s, I have a functional equation.
00:03:45.456 - 00:03:47.404, Speaker A: I'm not sure we see all the slide.
00:03:47.924 - 00:03:48.824, Speaker B: Okay.
00:03:51.044 - 00:03:55.084, Speaker A: We just see the upper part of the slide, I think so.
00:03:55.164 - 00:03:57.104, Speaker B: I don't know what I can do about that.
00:03:59.644 - 00:04:04.104, Speaker A: It's a problem on our end. Okay, let's, let's get Shane.
00:04:05.684 - 00:04:09.340, Speaker B: Okay, my last line, that was a song of a functional equation. I wanted to.
00:04:09.412 - 00:04:10.584, Speaker A: Beautiful equation.
00:04:16.824 - 00:04:21.284, Speaker B: Oh, you're missing a lot. You're missing like one third of the slide, right?
00:04:22.784 - 00:04:24.648, Speaker A: The functional equation, actually.
00:04:24.816 - 00:04:32.760, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I said you can all do all those manipulations and you can do them during the little pause.
00:04:32.912 - 00:04:34.444, Speaker A: Yes, we are all doing that.
00:04:35.784 - 00:04:40.484, Speaker B: Thank you. Okay, let me know when I should speak.
00:05:03.364 - 00:05:04.464, Speaker A: Thank you, Shane.
00:05:05.824 - 00:05:11.964, Speaker B: So the last line shows that a wm in blue. Do you see a wm in blue?
00:05:12.504 - 00:05:13.216, Speaker A: Yes.
00:05:13.360 - 00:05:49.178, Speaker B: Okay, thank you Francesco, for noticing it. Okay, so then pm of one minus u is some sign of functional equation, and then pm conjugate of u. And if u is q to the minus s, you have a functional equation which relates s to one minus s, as usual. Why am I saying that? Because when people ask, oh, I can I guess the group of symmetry while you have assign a functional equation. So if your matrix is unitary, the root can be anything. The sign of the functional equation can be anything but. If your matrix is symplectic, for example, the symplectic pairing will cause the sign of the functional equation to be one.
00:05:49.178 - 00:06:33.134, Speaker B: So if you're matching with a family, you have to match it with a family which has sign of the functional equation one. So that could be a way to answer this question. How do I determine the symmetry? You look at objects and they should have the same property, the sign of the function equation being an important one. So, given that I have an L function Ls C, where xi is a Dirichlet character in some family, I'll define before a smooth test function with compact support. So, I'm going to do the sum over all the zeros on the critical line of my function L is c, which is what I wrote here. Rho is one half plus I Gamma L rho C is equal to zero. If you don't assume the Riemann hypothesis, you can still do that, but then you don't know that gamma is real, and I'm going to delete it later.
00:06:33.134 - 00:07:04.948, Speaker B: You don't do Phi of Gamma. You do Phi of Gamma at, where you have to normalize. So this counts the low lying zero, because phi has compact support. And if now the one level density will be. Well, you count the low lying zero of each L function, which I'm circling with my mouse, and now you're summing over all the l functions. So maybe usually you're used to say, oh, I'm going to sum by characters ordered by the conductor, but here I'm going to sum the power of my character. So it's a different type of family of l function.
00:07:04.948 - 00:07:59.252, Speaker B: I'm going to take my character c, and I'm going to sum c to the k, and taking the k limit, I get the one level density. So what do we know about that? The Katzlernak conjecture tells us that the one level density, when you take the limit of counting the zeros of each l function in a small interval, averaging over all the l function, it should be the integral of your test function with some kernel and this kernel. It's the limit one level density of a group of random matrices. Why do I say limit? There's no n anymore. So you have to take your random matrix statistics and do a limit when n goes to infinity to get this kernel wg of x. And then this kernel will be either unitary, symplectic, or terminal. So the evidence for the Katz and Sarnak trajectory is it can be proven in many contexts for test function with limited support of their Fourier transform, where the Fourier transform phi of that is defined here.
00:07:59.252 - 00:08:28.808, Speaker B: So when phi of at has limited support, we can show this equation. That's what started by the work of Montgomery on the pair correlation. That's where the connection with the random matrix come from. He computed the statistics for limited support of the fourier transform, namely the pair correlation, and it fitted a similar statistics on random matrices. So, okay, so the one level density is the integral of phi of x times this kernel. And what is this kernel wg of x. So here I wrote it for all the group.
00:08:28.808 - 00:08:50.362, Speaker B: So for unitary matrices, it gives one. So this is what I call a good normalization. Okay, things are really properly normalized. You just get one. So if you counted a window of size n, you have n zero, everything is good. So for symplectic, you get something which is slightly different than one, and mostly it's different than one at the, .0 because at the .0
00:08:50.362 - 00:09:21.174, Speaker B: this thing is zero, which means that symbolic matrices, they really don't like to vanish. You know this, you know, if you look at this test function at the point, sorry, this kernel at the, .0 it's not one, it's equal to zero. And how can you explain that? Well, syntactic matrix, the sign of the functional equation is one. By differentiating, it means that the advantage of even order, so vanishing is a bit commitment. You have to get two zeros. You can also explain the so od and this SOE in the same way.
00:09:21.174 - 00:09:46.988, Speaker B: So notice that for SOE, you also have no vanishing. You also have, I'm very sorry, sine of the functional equation equal one. But you get a plus. And I would say this is caused by the Sor, because in the Sor, the sine of the functional equation is minus one. If you just look at those matrices, so you get a direction function, because there's force vanishing, and this is the extra vanishing. And the extra vanishing is very rare. You just vanish of order one.
00:09:46.988 - 00:10:19.654, Speaker B: And the effort would be to vanish of order three. So that's how you can see those, you know, make sense of those wg of x. And also, you know, if you want to define them with the Fourier transform, because the integral, this integral by percival is equal to this integral. And we usually use the integral in the, with the fourier transform domain. So here are the formula for the wg of t, which is the one I'm going to use. So those are just the Fourier transform of one is the Dirac function, etcetera. So this is what you get.
00:10:19.654 - 00:10:59.738, Speaker B: So, some example of computing the one level density, which are not what I want to do. So those are two gl one function. So for gl one function, the trivial support is minus one one. So under the Grh, everything here is under the GrH. So the Grh trivial support, where you just do the explicit formula apply GrH, is minus one one. So for quadratic character, Asliuk and Schneider managed to get to -22 and they got the correct simple, the correct symplectic kernel, because if you take quadratic character, the sign of the functional equation is always one. So that points to symplectic symmetry and disproves it, because this is the symplectic kernel.
00:10:59.738 - 00:11:39.416, Speaker B: You will notice I wrote minus one one here, even if the support is -22 because for the formula in the Fourier domain, everything is concentrated at minus eleven. So even if your support is -22 you should get minus eleven, which is actually a difficulty. How to do it for cubic character? Again, for cubic character, the trivial support is minus one one. So, recently, with Ahmed Guluglu, we extended, we broke the trivial support to -13 over 1113 over eleven. And this is for cubic character. So the difference with the second result is this is for cubic character. And then, of course, you don't get symplectic symmetry.
00:11:39.416 - 00:12:19.676, Speaker B: You get unitary symmetry, so you just get phi out of zero. Okay. Why do people want to do that? Why do you want to extend the support as much as possible? Of course, to give evidence for the cats are not conjecture, but also for one of the main application of the one level density, the proportion of non vanishing. So people always choose the same test function. So here's a test function, phi, v, of x, which has the property that at the, .0 it gives one, and it's positive for every real number. So this wing that the one level density will be an upper bound for the average rank, because every vanishing is counted for weight one, and the rest is counted for positive weight.
00:12:19.676 - 00:12:40.630, Speaker B: So with this function, the one level density is an upper bound for the average rank, and then the lower bound for the proportion of non vanishing. Notice also that for this function, the Fourier transform has support between minus v and v. So which v do you need to get a proportion which is not zero? This depends on the symmetry.
00:12:40.702 - 00:12:48.758, Speaker A: Sorry. Hang on, Chantal, we have the problem again. Your slides, they become larger here.
00:12:48.926 - 00:12:51.774, Speaker B: You mean, as I speak, they become larger and larger and larger?
00:12:51.814 - 00:12:52.862, Speaker A: Yes, something like that.
00:12:52.958 - 00:12:56.014, Speaker B: Must be very interesting. Very interesting.
00:12:58.114 - 00:13:01.090, Speaker A: Okay, just 1 second. Sorry.
00:13:01.162 - 00:13:02.134, Speaker B: That's okay.
00:13:29.454 - 00:13:37.822, Speaker A: Maybe we should leave it like that. Okay. Okay. Go ahead, Chantal. Thank you.
00:13:37.998 - 00:14:14.884, Speaker B: Okay, so this makes that the proportion of non vanishing, we can compute for the function does not vanish in a central point in a family. If you compute the one level density, you'll get a proportion of vanishing for unitary of one minus one over v. And of course this is only good when v is bigger than one. So that's why for cubic, you needed to break minus one one to get a positive proportion. For symplectic, you only need to break minus two over five, two over five. So when you get to minus one one, you get a very good proportion. So this is the value of v that you would need to get a positive proportion in each of the symmetry.
00:14:14.884 - 00:14:45.862, Speaker B: Okay, I want to take a family of cm elliptic curve. My family of cm elliptic curve will be the family ed y squared equal x cubed minus dx d is an integer which is square free. And here I wrote the l function. So, this slide for the l function has nothing to do with the fact that the curve is cm. Any elliptic curve would have this l function. It's a gl two object. So I can write it as this polynomial of degree two in p to the s, or I can write it as two factor of degree one in p to the s.
00:14:45.862 - 00:14:46.718, Speaker B: That's my.
00:14:46.886 - 00:15:23.778, Speaker A: I don't know how to tell you, but we need. Sorry, it's very strange. Sorry. Shane is here again. Maybe, Shane, you could keep us company from here today. Okay, you can go ahead, Chantal.
00:15:23.866 - 00:15:26.934, Speaker B: Sir, I think you're still missing a little corner, but.
00:15:27.714 - 00:15:32.014, Speaker A: Oh, yes. Okay.
00:15:32.054 - 00:16:00.130, Speaker B: Okay, so this is the l function of any elliptic curve. It's a gl two object. You have the alpha p, which eval psi square root of p. And, you know, I wrote it, you know, where does ap and alpha p coming from? Well, this is the number of point of the curve over fp. It's going to be p plus one minus ap, or ap is in fact the sum of alpha p and alpha p bar. So, and the acid bound then is two square root of p. So this is the l function of any elliptic curve.
00:16:00.130 - 00:16:27.160, Speaker B: But now we don't have any elliptic curve, we have a cm elliptic curve. So when you have a cm elliptic curve, a miracle occurs. Oh, I think I pressed twice. A miracle occurred. So, Ed is a cm elliptic curve. So this gl two object ls of Ed, it's actually the l function of Ek character over q of I, because it does complex multiplication by q of I. So, a gl two over q becomes a gl one over q of I.
00:16:27.160 - 00:16:56.740, Speaker B: So things are greatly simplified, though from the point of view of the one level density. This is still a gl two object in the sense that the trivial support is still minus one half, minus one two. So from that point of view, it behaves like a gl two object. But the l function is a way simpler object. So it's the l function of the Ecchi character of a q of I, well evaluated as a slightly different point. And I'm going to write explicitly this Ek character. Okay, so what is my family? D is fixed.
00:16:56.740 - 00:17:28.844, Speaker B: D does not run. My family is running over k. I'm taking, you know, the, one of those elliptic curves for a fixed d. And I'm considering the family where I take powers of the character cd. So I didn't wrote Cd to the k, because Cd, you don't need to take Cd to the k. You want to take the primitive character inducing Cd to the k, which actually will be the same character, except in one case where it becomes a trivial character. But you need to take the primitive character inducing it, which is to say the conductor needs to be correct.
00:17:28.844 - 00:18:05.102, Speaker B: But CDk is almost just cd to the k. Okay, what happened with this l function? It's AKL function. So if I look at ls Cdk, I can do the completed l function, which is going to be this. Okay, there's the conductor to the s two, there's a two PI to the minus s, there's a gamma factor. And the gamma factor is very important because I'm varying k. So my conductor actually is just k over two. You know, if you compute the analytic conductor, there'll be, of course, this part, the conductor fDk, which is basically the conductor fd.
00:18:05.102 - 00:18:45.924, Speaker B: It only depends on a congruence modulo a. So basically, this is this k over two, which is the conductor. So this completed l function will be, well, a sign of a functional equation times, you know, the completed l function of the conjugate. But the conjugate of, well, I'm not saying that the conjugate of this character is a cell. I'm saying that if you do the l function of the conjugate or the l function of the character, they're going to be the same because things are flip. You know, p and p bar are flip. So you're going to get exactly the same l function and the sign of the functional equation, which is given by a complicated formula with Gauss sum, because we computed all of them, is always plus or minus one.
00:18:45.924 - 00:19:25.354, Speaker B: So what are the sign of the functional equation when k is even, the sign of the functional equation is always one for any d so when k is odd, in the case where d is congruent to one mod four, then the sine of the functional equation is given by the formula that I wrote that. It's a. Well, it's not a difficult computation, but it's kind of a painful one. You have to keep track of everything. So when k is odd, what you can say is half of the time, the sine of the functional equation is minus one half of the time plus one. And there will be a very similar formula for d is congruent to one three. So half of the time is going to be plus one, half of the time is going to be minus one.
00:19:25.354 - 00:19:53.418, Speaker B: So in all cases, you have that the. Well, I wanted to write that. Yeah. The proportion where the sign of the functional equation is minus one is one four, which is very bizarre, because if you have an orthogonal family, it's going to be one half. If you have a symplectic family, it's going to be one. So, so this indicates that this family is probably two families together. So which is what we're going to find in two minutes.
00:19:53.418 - 00:20:55.694, Speaker B: So I'm going to take my family, fd alpha to be the set of those l function associated to those power of the character cd when k is congruent to a given value mod eight, because we saw that the sign of the functional equation depends on the value mod eight. And my one level density will be, well, summing that over all possible k congruent to alpha mod eight, there's of course, k over eight of them. And then this is for every l function, I'm counting the low lying zero. So in the case where d is equal to one and alpha is zero or four, this was already done, because in those cases, only the character at infinity stays, the Dirichlet character disappears. And those cases were done by Waxman in 2001, and those were symplectic symmetry. So there's eight things, we don't know what's the symmetry, but at least two of them have symplectic symmetry. I guess if you're trying to guess what's happening, maybe it's pretty clear now, but at the beginning we were not here.
00:20:55.694 - 00:21:36.744, Speaker B: Okay, what's happening? So suppose that the support of phi is contained in minus one one. As I said, the trivial support for gl two is minus one two, minus one two. And here we get to minus one one. But maybe some people would also call it the trivial support, because the computation need to extend are not so difficult. They're kind of part of doing things intelligently, because maybe it's a gl two object, but it's also given by a gl one over z of I. So when the support is between minus one and one and alpha is even, you get here symplectic symmetry. If you remember, when it's a minus, it's symplectic symmetry.
00:21:36.744 - 00:22:26.108, Speaker B: So when alpha is even, which means the sign of the functional equation is always plus one, well, you get symplectic symmetry. Now, when alpha is odd, and the sign of the functional equation is half of the time one or minus one, you get. Well, so even, this is what I wrote. Okay, so you could say, well, it's a bit bizarre that I always get so even when alpha is odd, because the sign of the functional equation sometimes is minus and sometimes is plus, which is certainly not a characteristic of so even. But one thing which is happening here is that inside minus one one, you cannot differentiate so even or so odd. If I had written the so odd, it would be written differently, but it will always take the same value between minus one. 1 second observation, why did I write minus infinity to infinity? Because my support is only in minus eleven.
00:22:26.108 - 00:23:20.954, Speaker B: So I could have written minus eleven, because this is always the answer given by the inert prime minus infinity to infinity. But when the support passed minus one, one, this is the wrong answer, which explain one of the difficulty of passing minus one. One, not only you need to bound what you call the error term, you need to go in the error term and find something which would, you know, cancel the wrong contribution of the inert prime. So there's a big difficulty in passing that. And I think here I just have the remark that I just said that the contribution and or third remark, when k is odd, actually you can associate the character, which is an atomographic form of weight, k plus one, the level will be related to the level of the character. And those family, you know, not all such forms are like that. This is a subfamily, but the family of all such form have orthogonal symmetry.
00:23:20.954 - 00:24:17.234, Speaker B: So it makes sense that the subfamily would have orthogonal symmetry. Okay, so what proportion of non vanishing do we get for alpha, even because we have symplectic symmetry, even with a support of minus one one symplectic symmetry gives very good result when you do the computation. So you have a 75% of non vanishing when alpha is even, when alpha is odd and you have the sign of the functional equation is plus one, you get 25% of non vanishing, because orthogonal symmetry gives a less percentage when you do the math. And when alpha is one, and it already vanishes at the central point, the sign of the functional equation is minus one. The chances to have not having additional vanishing is 75%. So that's what you get with those things with one minus v that I wrote at the beginning. And if we had unitary symmetry, it would give nothing because we don't pass minus one.
00:24:17.234 - 00:24:53.432, Speaker B: Okay, what are the Ecce character? Actually the Ecce character, they depend on what is the number of points of the reduced curve. And you can compute that by elementary technique, by writing the number of points with a character and evaluating the character sum. And you would get that when p is congruent to one mod tree, the number of points would be p plus one. Okay. Just by counting the number of points on this Cm curve over. You know, the fact that it's a Cm curve means that it will write in a way that character sum would work very well. And here you would get p plus one point.
00:24:53.432 - 00:25:26.596, Speaker B: When p is congruent to one four, you write p as the product of two primes. Okay? I don't write it as a product of two ideals. I'm choosing my generator, and you're choosing your generator to be congruent to one times one plus I to the cube. Okay? And this is called primary. So if I'm choosing my PI p primary, the number of points will be given by this expression where, what is this thing? This is just the cubic residue symbol over z of I, which is always defined for any prime. And this thing is my PI p. Well, I wrote it as to be a primary element.
00:25:26.596 - 00:25:52.794, Speaker B: So you just prove this formula by using character sum over finite field. And then you write the l function with that. So if you can see the bottom of my slide, I'd like to discuss that a bit. So, okay, your l function is written like that. Whoops, it disappeared. Your l function is written like that because I just plugged the formula above. But don't forget that it's supposed to be s minus one half cd.
00:25:52.794 - 00:26:35.866, Speaker B: So if I replace l by s minus one two, here I get one plus p to the minus two, s to the minus one, which is very good because those are inert prime and their norm is p to the two. So this indicates that the value of the character is one. Here, if I do s minus one half, I would divide by square root of p, and this will become an infinite character at infinity. You have that for Ek character. And this thing will be a character with a finite part, which is something mod d, or in fact mod two plus id and a part at infinity, which is what I wrote in the next slide. The Ek character are just given by this formula. So for every ideal p, you pick a primary generator.
00:26:35.866 - 00:26:52.182, Speaker B: You have PI p divided by the norm of PI p. This has norm one. And you can take any power of that. It never disappeared. That's a character of infinite order. And you have your character of finite order. And of course, when you take fourth power of your character, a finite order, it becomes the principal character.
00:26:52.182 - 00:27:13.454, Speaker B: And those are the k's done by Waxman. When k is congruent to zero or four mod eight, so k is divisible by four. So this is my character and this is zero. When PI p is not, well, two plus I is. I could have written one plus I or two, you know. So four, sorry. So PI p is co prime to two plus I.
00:27:13.454 - 00:27:54.020, Speaker B: And you can write this thing by. Okay, choosing the generator. You can write this thing for any generator by saying, okay, choosing the generator means to multiply any generator by a character of order two plus two I. That's also another way to write your ek character, which gives this conductor. Okay, and what happens when p is congruent to three mod four? Well, I want something which is congruent to one plus two plus two I, and two plus two I is, you know, divides four. So I need to take minus p. If p is congruent to three, mod four minus p will be congruent to one plus plus two I, and also this thing will be one.
00:27:54.020 - 00:28:14.466, Speaker B: Okay. You're going to say, well, if p is congruent to three mod four, this character does not exist over q. Completely agree. But that's not a character over q. That's a character over z of I. You're seeing p as a prime over z of I, which is a prime of norm p squared, which is congruent to one mod four. So when p is congruent to one mod four, you get that, and indeed, the character is minus one.
00:28:14.466 - 00:28:27.194, Speaker B: Okay, so this formula here gives you minus one. Okay. So when people do the one level density, let me look at the time. So I. How much time do I have left? I'm very sorry.
00:28:29.974 - 00:28:32.126, Speaker A: Chantal. You have about five minutes.
00:28:32.230 - 00:28:58.358, Speaker B: Okay, so when you want to compute the one level density. So the starting point is that this is the explicit formula. So you want to write a summation over the zeros. Well, the zeros are the pole of the logarithmic derivative. So you integrate the logarithmic derivative, you use the functional equation, you catch the poles, and you're going to get this formula. So this is my properly normalized zero. The important thing in that is the k square.
00:28:58.358 - 00:29:12.444, Speaker B: So you can see that's a gl two object. There's a k square. So this is a sign of a very good normalization. I just get phi out of zero on the nose. Those are the primes, the inner. Sorry, the split primes. And those are the inner primes.
00:29:12.444 - 00:29:32.404, Speaker B: So any paper on the one level density? Well, this is where you start. You know, all the rest before is, you know, completely classical. So I'm starting from the explicit formula. They're properly normalized. I just get phi out of zero, which you get all the time. If it's unitary, you don't get anything else. And for the other, you know, symmetry, you get other stuff.
00:29:32.404 - 00:30:01.426, Speaker B: So how do you get the other stuff? Well, now I want to compute the one level density. So I'm just going to sum this formula. So I'm going to do this first one that I think everybody can do. When I sum the phi out of zero, on average, of course, I get the phi out of zero. This is very good. And accommodation, which is not really difficult because the character at inert prime is very easy, is. So I copied exactly the formula that I have at inert prime.
00:30:01.426 - 00:30:44.072, Speaker B: And I told you the value of the character is minus one. But here I'm raising to the kth power, and I'm raising to the nth power because I have powers of prime in the logarithmic derivative. And it's easy to see that this gives that, which means that if you pass minus one one, this is the wrong answer. So if you pass minus one one, you have from this split prime, find a contribution which is equal to minus that, which explained the difficulty of passing minus eleven. And this is what I wrote again, I would say maybe the paper starts here. All the rest is very classical. So now you need to show that if I do the sum over the split prime, averaging.
00:30:44.072 - 00:31:09.082, Speaker B: So I'm averaging over all the family. So this was just something that comes from a change of variable. And now this is the sum over split prime of those character. I want to pick association of those character. So for support inside minus eleven, this should be small o of one. And if you break the support, well, you have to find that thing that cancel the wrong answer and do small o of one. Okay.
00:31:09.082 - 00:31:43.352, Speaker B: And I think I'm just gonna, I'm gonna stay inside my five minutes. So let me just explain the minus 1212 support. So my value of my character, well, I can write them as e to the I theta, e to the I times an angle. So this is the value of my character at p, the value of my character at p bar, they're just, you know, things of norm one. I don't know which one is p or p bar. So I don't know which one is theta or minus theta, but I'm summing them. Okay? So, and if I have powers of character, it's going to be the same formula with summing the angle.
00:31:43.352 - 00:32:09.228, Speaker B: So if I just replace that, okay, the value of my character here, I'm going to write as e to the ik. There's even an n and theta dp. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring the sum over k inside. Okay? You know, this is what you always do. You reverse the sum over prime to the sum over your family. That's always the first step. And when I bring the sum over k inside, I get sum of exponential of e to the chi theta.
00:32:09.228 - 00:32:35.432, Speaker B: Well, that's a very, very classical function. That's the Dirichlet kernel. Okay, so the Dirichlet kernel, if you never saw a picture of the Dieverschle kernel on the Wikipedia page, when k goes to infinity, it tends to the Dirac function. And they have something that move describing that. And you see the sine wave feeding the Dirac function in the middle. It's very pretty. So they do something dynamical by increasing big k.
00:32:35.432 - 00:33:02.996, Speaker B: So this is the Dirichlet kernel, this function, and while at zero, you're gonna get sine of zero in the denominator. So, and my function that I'm going to take, it's not exactly the Dirichlet kernel because I have this congruence mod alpha. Okay, so this is what I have to evaluate. But this is this Dirichlet kernel. So it is equal to that. The sign on the top is bounded by one and the sign on the denominator. Well, this is what I have here.
00:33:02.996 - 00:33:46.184, Speaker B: So I have to multiply by four, which, you know, for the formula to be true, it creates some difficulty that you have to split in cases, but it's the same proof. So what's the smallest value that can be taken by sine of four? M Delta dp is the question. Or what's the smallest value of the angle that can be taken? But this is an easy question to answer because don't forget that zp is an integer. You know, p is a prime. So p is a plus bi. So this zp here is an algebraic integer. So if you have an algebraic integer, and you look the smallest angle that can be obtained for an algebraic integer, of a certain radius, it's not going to be too small because the points have to be integer, which is exactly what I wrote.
00:33:46.184 - 00:34:11.584, Speaker B: If I have an algebraic integer like that, well, the sign, which is going to be this is a Pythagoras theorem. So the angle theorem is going to be the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse. Well, this thing cannot be too small because d cannot be too small. So d is bigger than one. And if I just replace that in my formula, that's what I call the trivial bound. V is smaller than one half. Okay, I just replaced that in my formula.
00:34:11.584 - 00:34:43.944, Speaker B: I replace that by one over p to the n over two, so the p to the n gets cancelled. And now if I sum that I got k to the two v minus one divided by log k, and again, v is always the support of the Fourier transform, and you need v smaller than one two. So let me pass for the other slide explaining how we do the general case and go to my last slide. Thank you very much. Oh, Anne. I cannot hear anybody. I'm sorry.
