00:00:00.200 - 00:00:08.534, Speaker A: All right, welcome back, everybody. So we have Hal Schenck from Auburn joining us virtually. Hi, Hal.
00:00:08.694 - 00:00:11.274, Speaker B: Hi, guys. And gals.
00:00:11.774 - 00:00:18.398, Speaker A: And gals. And he will tell us about free curves, eigenschemes and pencils of curves. Take it away, Hal.
00:00:18.526 - 00:00:52.222, Speaker B: So thanks very much for the invitation. I'm really, really sad that I'm not there in such a nice venue with such a nice group of people. And especially I'm sad not to be there to harass Frank. So I am harassing him a little bit. So instead of having a shirt from Churchill College, which was where Frank was, at Cambridge, I'm wearing Fitzwilliam. So that's my minor act of harassment. So this is joint work with Roberto Gcinero and Giovanna Allardi, who are both at Napoli, Rosamiro Royg, who's in Barcelona, and Jean Valles, who is at Po.
00:00:52.222 - 00:01:25.706, Speaker B: So it's a italian, spanish, french and us team. So before I start going, let me say just a little bit of background on what the problem is. So the big picture to keep in mind here is the following. We're going to have some variety, and that variety will be smooth. And in fact we're going to be interested in projector affine space. So there's a tangent bundle on that variety. And then if I take a hyper surface, I can take the sub bundle of the tangent bundle, where if I take a tangent vector, then, and it's tangent to that hyper surface.
00:01:25.706 - 00:02:19.986, Speaker B: So this is going to be a sub bundle of the tangent bundle. So these are usually called, this is called the logarithmic tangent bundle. And so there's a dual bundle which is called the sheaf well, or vector bundle if your hyper surface is smooth, but it's the bundle of logarithmic or the logarithmic cotangent bundle. And here you're going to have one forms which are allowed to have a simple pole along that hypersurface. So these are geometric objects that appear in Grotendijk's algebraic durand theorem. And so the question that we're going to be asking is when about the behavior of this logarithmic tangent bundle or its dual is when does it split as a sum of line bundles? And so this sounds like a very abstract algebra or geometric question, but the jumping off point is when our hypersurface is an arrangement of hyperplanes. So this turns into a problem in combinatorial discrete geometry.
00:02:19.986 - 00:02:49.744, Speaker B: And the takeaway from the talk is that there's a big question in the field, which we'll come to shortly which is still open. So this talk will not solve a big open conjecture, but everybody here will learn about a very nice conjecture in enumerative geometry, which is open. And it's also something that is very amenable to computation and experiment. So it's a fun thing to play with. So if you zone out during my talk, impossible. That would never happen. But you can start coding right away.
00:02:49.744 - 00:03:10.892, Speaker B: It takes three lines, ten lines of code, and you can start experimenting. So that's the background in the big picture. And so let's get moving. So here's some definitions. We're going to be working in an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. You can do this in a finite field and it turns. There's lots of interesting number theoretic problems that are connected to this.
00:03:10.892 - 00:03:40.036, Speaker B: But we're going to stay in characteristic zero. We're going to be working in projective space and projective n space. So underlying projective space, that's proj of the usual polynomial ring in n plus one variables. And here's the central player in our investigation. Well, the start is that this is the algebra. The algebraic version of the tangent bundle is just the module of derivations. So this is r is our polynomial ring.
00:03:40.036 - 00:04:13.294, Speaker B: And this module dir k of r k is our field. This is just a free module whose basis is given by d dxi. And so these are, these, we think of these as polynomial differential operators, right? These are the d Dxi is a differential operator. And then it has polynomial coefficients. So of course this dare k of r can be fed a polynomial and it will spit out a polynomial. So this is a free module of rank n plus one. And so then, so what are we looking at here? Let me get this stuff out of the way so I can see the bottom of my slide.
00:04:13.294 - 00:04:40.504, Speaker B: Collapse that. Okay. And then this is what I defined was this. I have a hypersurface defined by, in this case, because we're thinking projectively, f is going to be some homogeneous form. And then I want these logarithmic vector fields. So these are going to be. And algebraically, I have this polynomial differential operator which when I feed it the defining polynomial of my height.
00:04:40.504 - 00:04:41.756, Speaker B: Yes.
00:04:41.940 - 00:04:42.984, Speaker A: What's x?
00:04:44.444 - 00:05:02.404, Speaker B: X is the ambient space. So I said right now this is x for us, x is going to be projective space. But this applies more generally. So great question. In general, this is a general definition for this logarithmic tangent bundle. But for us, x will be projective space.
00:05:02.944 - 00:05:03.560, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:05:03.672 - 00:05:34.308, Speaker B: Okay. And so then this algebraic operation is very easy. The elements of this, and you can bounce back and forth between sheaves on projective space or graded modules over the polynomial ring are. So these are just going to be these polynomial differential operators which when we feed it are defining polynomial for the hypersurface, it just spits out a multiple of f. So this is a very simple algebraic condition. The other thing I want to point out is f is going to be reduced. So this we don't have sort of f can factor.
00:05:34.308 - 00:06:23.576, Speaker B: And in fact, like I said, the jumping off point will be where f is a product of linear forms, but there won't be any repeats in that. So this is a reduced, but it doesn't have to be irreducible divisor. So this is the setup or the, I guess, dramatis Persona. And so, and here's a definition. We say that a divisor is free if this is a free r module, and we'll see examples of this in just a second. So the first thing to point out is that there's an easy, it's obvious that this dare of f is non empty and it's because we have the Euler relation. So if we have a homogeneous polynomial f and I apply the Euler derivation which is this delta sub e to f, we know that we just get out f again with multiplied by its degree.
00:06:23.576 - 00:07:14.544, Speaker B: So that's Euler's relation. So, and in fact it turns out that Euler operator is going to generate a free summed of the module dare of f. And so any derivation can be written as some delta prime plus a multiple of the Euler derivation. And the idea is basically this delta prime will be a polynomial differential operator which eats f and spits out zero. So again, that's only because the Euler operator returns a multiple of F. And so if we rip that Euler operator off of some arbitrary derivation, we get a derivation which vanishes on f. And this is going to be important because it gives us an easier way to think about this module dir of f.
00:07:14.544 - 00:08:16.224, Speaker B: The point is so this is what we just said, that this Euler operator generates a free sum end of the module and then the dir zero of f are these derivations which eat f and spit out zero. And this is a familiar object to those of us who work in commutative algebra, or computational commutative algebra, or computational commutative algebra and combinatorics. It's simply the syzygies on the jacobian ideal. And the reason that this is the case is, if you think about it, what's a syzygy on the jacobian ideal? Well, the jacobian ideal is exactly partial f partial x naught up through partial f partial xn. And then a syzygy is some polynomial g zero up through gn, which dots to zero with the jacobian ideal. And that's exactly, if we just sort of think of those gi's as being the coefficients of our derivation, that's exactly something which eats f and spits out zero. So the syzygies of the jacobian ideal correspond to this module zero of f.
00:08:16.224 - 00:08:53.421, Speaker B: And so then we say that this hypersurface is a free hypersurface. Exactly. When this module of derivations is a free module, it splits as a direct sum of copies of r. We'll see, as I mentioned, if this is, if it's terrible to have abstract definitions without, without examples. So we'll see an example in a second. And it's an easy observation that the sum of these shifts, these are simply, these are the r of minus a one through a n. Those are simply going to be the degrees of the polynomials that appear in this syzygy.
00:08:53.421 - 00:09:48.804, Speaker B: And since it's a syzygy on the jacobian ideal f was degree d, then the sum of these AI's has to add up to the degree of the jacobian ideal minus one. So what? So this is what we just said. We've got this jacobian ideal and our dara zero of f is simply the kernel of that. So think of this again. This is linear algebra with polynomials. So I have an n plus one by one matrix given by the partials of our hypersurface and the kernel of that n plus one by one matrix is our module derivations. So this is the first, this is the reason that this talk should, you should stay awake in this talk is that there's a beautiful paper from 45 years ago in inventionis by Orlich and Solomon where they computed the cohomology ring of the complement of a hyperplane arrangement.
00:09:48.804 - 00:10:44.984, Speaker B: So I have some hyperplane arrangement in projective space and then I take its complement that has a comology ring and it has a beautiful presentation. So for those of you who like Stanley Reasoner rings, which are rings associated to simplicial complexes, the Orlich Solomon algebra is very similar in flavor to the Stanley reasoner ring. It is a quotient of an exterior algebra with the number of generators equal to the number of hyperplanes. And the ideal that you quotient by to get this comology ring is determined only by the intersection lattice of the arrangement. So what's the intersection lattice? I'm using lattice, not in the sense of a free z module, but as a graded poset. And that intersection lattice has as its rank one elements, the hyperplanes themselves as its rank two elements, the co dimension, two intersections of the hyperplanes and so on. So this is a very combinatorial object.
00:10:44.984 - 00:11:26.192, Speaker B: And this orlox Solomon algebra or the cohomology ring is given in in terms of the lattice. And then the next year, hero tarao and another inventionist paper showed that if the arrangement is free, the Betty numbers are determined by the exponents. What are the exponents? Remember, the exponents are exactly. If it's a free module, it's these AI's where it splits. And so there's these two inventiones papers about kolmology, ring of an arrangement complement and this module of derivations. And here is the conjecture. So this is an open conjecture and that is that the freeness of the arrangement depends only on the intersection lattice.
00:11:26.192 - 00:12:28.354, Speaker B: And that means that the idea that the picture you should keep in mind is if you have some hyperplane arrangement and you wiggle it without changing the intersection, so you don't change some place where say three hyperplanes meet in a codimension two space to breaking that codimension to intersection, then if it's free or not, depends only on that combinatoric. So this is a conjecture that's been open, as you can see, for well over 40 years. And what we're going to do is investigate this conjecture in the most concrete setting. So what would be the easiest sort of arrangement? Well, that would be a configuration either of lines in p two, or you might try to generalize and say, well, maybe we'll get some insight on what happens to a line arrangement in p two. Or if you like, affine things, an arrangement of planes in c three that all pass through the origin. Maybe we can obtain some insight into freeness by looking at freeness just for curves in p two. So that's where we're going to go is talk about freeness for curves in p two.
00:12:28.354 - 00:12:43.314, Speaker B: Any questions so far? Let me pause and see if anybody, I don't see any hands. Maybe Tyler or somebody can yell at me if there's a question from the audience. So that's the problem is to understand.
00:12:44.374 - 00:12:46.454, Speaker A: Say again, no questions, you're good.
00:12:46.494 - 00:13:31.984, Speaker B: No questions. Okay, so, big open question, which we won't solve. So again, you should stay interested because this is a fun problem to play with. So here's some easy combinatorics and we're going to focus on curves in the plane. So right now we're specializing to just curves in p two, sort of almost the most concrete objects you could imagine. Of course, if you pick up Briskorn's book on singularities, which is about basically curves in the plane, that's, I don't know, 800 page book, and nobody likes 800 page books, right? So if our curve arrangement is free, so we have a curve f in the plane of degree d, these two, and the arrangement is free, there'll be two generators. Remember, these are syzygies.
00:13:31.984 - 00:14:13.508, Speaker B: These are relations on our jacobian ideal. The sum of those syzygys which are homogeneous, these are vectors of homogeneous polynomials, would be d minus one. And then the product of that is going to be d minus one. Choose two minus the sum of the multiplicities of the singularities. And I should say that for a line arrangement, the multiplicity of the singularity is simply the number of points per passing number of lines passing through the points minus one. That's not the case for general arrangements. And this is going to, we're going to talk about the behavior of singularities in a second, but for line arrangements, and it turns out that the arrange that the singularities are always something called quasi homogeneous, which.
00:14:13.508 - 00:14:53.604, Speaker B: And we'll see, there's a very nice description of what that condition is. So here's some examples. So two lines are free, and the module, the syzygy module splits this way. Three lines through a point are free. The syzygies, one of them is degree zero, one is degree two, a line tangent to a conic, or three lines that all meet sort of generically, those are both free. What are non free things? So this might make you think that lots of arrangements are free. So, first off, a smooth, irreducible curve is always going to be non free.
00:14:53.604 - 00:15:34.704, Speaker B: And even if you allow nodes or cusps, this also will not be free. More sort of concretely, if I take an arrangement of lines which is generic. So this is where we take our, you know, pickup sticks and drop them all, and all the intersections are normal crossing. So all the. If it's generic, that means that lines should intersect in only two points. As soon as, even though in this case with three lines, that arrangement was three, as soon as you have four or more lines, and it's a generic arrangement, it will not be a free arrangement. So the upshot is that if you're doing computational experiments, you should think of free arrangements as being very non generic.
00:15:34.704 - 00:16:23.366, Speaker B: So those are some examples. Here's two interesting examples, I think. So the first one, these are this arrangement of six lines in p two. You can think of as the reflecting hyperplane. If you thought sort of affinely in c three, these are the reflecting hyperplanes for the a three reflection arrangement. So I have six planes in c three, which we're going to draw as six lines in p two. And you can see that this arrangement, this is not rigid in the sense that if I wiggle the positions of these vertices, but keep the combinatorics fixed, I'll still have four triple intersections, so that the intersections that are marked with dots or triple intersections, and then I have these three normal crossing points marked with stars.
00:16:23.366 - 00:17:13.934, Speaker B: So this is a free arrangement. There's a reason this is a free arrangement, and that is, I'll mention this in a bit when I talk about history. The intersection lattice of this is a super solvable lattice. So super solvable basically means either combinatorially that you have a maximum chain of modular elements, but it has a beautiful combinatorial picture, or sorry, topological picture, which is, if we think of the arrangement complement. What super solvable means is that there's actually a chain of vibrations where each fiber is simply a complex line punctured in a certain number of points. The number of punctures actually corresponds to these exponents. So there's a fibration here where we have one fiber that is a c punctured in three points, and another fiber that is a c punctured in two points.
00:17:13.934 - 00:17:58.594, Speaker B: Now if we perturb this arrangement though, and change the combinatorics. So here what I'm going to do is I'm going to take one of these lines, for example, this line right here, and move it off, holding all the other lines fixed, and that breaks the breaks, that middle symmetry. So now instead of having four triple points, I have three triple points. And it's an easy exercise. You don't have to do anything except use the little observation that we had a few pages ago right here, which was that if your arrangement is free, we have two numerical conditions, and in this case, those numerical conditions aren't satisfied. So this perturbation is not a free arrangement. And so of course we've changed the combinatorics.
00:17:58.594 - 00:18:37.830, Speaker B: Right, we've changed the combinatorics. So here is one of the earliest theorems. This is due to Sato, and this is more general, I'm stating it here for a curve, but it applies more generally to any hyper surface. And it says that basically for a curve, the arrangement is free. Exactly. If I take the two, if there's two derivations, remember we think of these derivations as syzygies such that if we stack those two syzygies in a matrix and then add on the variables, we get a multiple of our defining polynomial f. So this is called Satos criterion.
00:18:37.830 - 00:19:33.032, Speaker B: The proof of this, which I think was not sort of, the early folks who were working in hyperplane arrangements, were oftentimes coming from topology. This is really an instance of something called the Hilbert Virch theorem, which tells you about codimension two, Cohen McCauley's, Cohen McCauley ideals and Euler's relation. And so from an algebraic standpoint, this is an easy sort of criterion for freeness. And it really is just translating this freeness condition into saying that the module of derivations is a free module. That means you only have, if this was an arrangement in pn, we have exactly n linearly independent syzygies which have no relations on them. So this is Satos theorem, and we're going to switch gears in a bit. And essentially the whole point of this talk is that there's an object which has appeared recently in analysis of tensors called eigenschemes.
00:19:33.032 - 00:20:26.032, Speaker B: And eigenschemes will have a role to play, and we're essentially going to translate Satos criterion into something related to eigenschemes. But this is a nice, easy to, sort of easy to use criteria to check on freeness. So what? So here's our history. So the first results on hyperplane arrangements were Saito, who proved this Grotendiq algebraic duram, which relates, if you have a, if you have a divisor in a variety and want to know the cohomology of the complement of that, this is a result of grotendiq, which is basically, if the divisor has normal crossings, there's a very nice recipe for it. And delineated, approved some results on reflection arrangements. So arrangements that come from the reflecting hyperplanes of some of the reflection groups. Then I mentioned this result of Orlick Solomon, who proved a result on the comology ring.
00:20:26.032 - 00:21:08.774, Speaker B: Sato. There's an lcs formula. This relates the fundamental group of the arrangement complement to the comology ring. And then there's a wonderful slew of results in the eighties that are combinatorially or about the common torics due to some of these names here, as well as this formula that I mentioned of Tarao and trows freeness formula formulas about super solvability and lcs formulas. There's a bunch of these papers, I should mention that are in Vanciena. So this was a very, very active area in the eighties. And then more recently, there's work of Dan Cohen and Fred Cohen, Abe DiCancino, porcelain, Demke denim, Vikner.
00:21:08.774 - 00:22:00.050, Speaker B: June, of course, famously approved, wrote his conjecture using graphic arrangements. So if you take a graph, you can create an arrangement where your hyperplanes are simply basically xi minus xj, if vij is an edge of the graph. So you have graphic arrangements. And Jun proved this conjecture on unimodality via graphic arrangements, and then a whole slew of other names here. And so these are all, everything I'm talking about up till up to this bottom thing was all focused on hyperplane arrangements. And you could say, very reasonably, well, there's still lots of open questions on hyperplanear arrangements. Why would you look at hypersurfaces instead? And of course, the point is that perhaps by looking at a more general class of objects, you can obtain insight into these hyperplane arrangements.
00:22:00.050 - 00:22:11.934, Speaker B: So, let me pause again for a second and ask everybody, okay, or any questions. So, this has all just been the background and history part of the talk. And now we're going to start to move into some new things. All good?
00:22:12.434 - 00:22:13.474, Speaker A: I think you're good to go.
00:22:13.554 - 00:22:15.498, Speaker B: Everybody has coffee, right? So, okay.
00:22:15.586 - 00:22:16.254, Speaker A: Yes.
00:22:17.674 - 00:23:00.996, Speaker B: Okay. So now let's talk about hyper surface arrangements, but we're going to stay in the setting of the simplest hyper surface arrangements, which are curves in p two. So it turns out, with one of my students, Stefan Toaneu, who's now at Idaho, we looked at, what's the simplest generalization? Well, how about arrangements of smooth, rational curves? Well, a rational curve in p two is either a line or a conic. And so we could say, let's look at line and conic arrangements. And so what was surprising to us is that even in this rather simple extension of hyperplane arrangements or line arrangements, freeness is not combinatorial. So you can have combinatorial equivalent arrangements of lines and conics. That is, the intersections all look the same.
00:23:00.996 - 00:23:53.568, Speaker B: And even if the, even if the singularities are all normal crossing, so that if you zoom, or not normal crossing, sorry, ordinary singularity. So if you have, say, d branches passing through some singular point, when you zoom in, you see d distinct tangent lines. So I'm not allowing things like two conics touching it, which meet at a single point. So, but, but things where all the singularities are ordinary. So even there, prenis is not combinatorial. And then with hiroturao and Masahiko Yoshinaga, we came up with a deletion restriction theorem for curves. So the thing you might think about in the setting of a line arrangement or even a hyperplane arrangement is, there's a very natural sort of inductive operation, which is if I have an arrangement of k hyperplanes, I could either remove one hyperplane and have another hyperplane arrangement with one fewer hyperplanes.
00:23:53.568 - 00:24:36.044, Speaker B: But I could also restrict the hyperplane arrangement to that distinguished hyperplane. And that gives you essentially a exact, it's not always true, but it gives you sometimes a sequence which is either left or right exact and which is sometimes exact. And so this gives you a way to relate to simpler objects. The deletion throw away a hyperplane or the restriction restrict to a hyperplane to an arrangement. And so we were able to prove a deletion restriction arrangement for curves with a caveat that I'll mention later. And then John had some beautiful results on pencils of curves. So a pencil, if you're not, it's an algebra geometric concept.
00:24:36.044 - 00:25:46.590, Speaker B: But all a pencil is when somebody says a pencil, it is a family of objects that is parameterized by a p one. And so the reason it's called a pencil is you have this line, a projective line has two parameters, a and b. So when someone talks about a pencil of curves, they mean basically you take a variable a times some defining polynomial for a curve plus another variable b times the defining polynomial for another curve. And then you let a and b vary and that gives you a pencil of curves. And so a lot of the results on curve arrangements and understanding freeness for curve arrangements require that your singularities are something called quasi homogeneous. So I want to talk about this quasi homogeneity conjecture, sorry, not conjecture, condition, because the main result that I'm going to talk about today is a construction for free arrangements where we can dispense with this quasi homogeneity. So ideally what you walk away from, from this talk is, number one, with the knowledge that there's some very interesting conjecture and hyperplane arrangements, which is combinatorial, but also that there's a useful construction of something called eigenschemes.
00:25:46.590 - 00:26:23.394, Speaker B: So eigenschemes are the tool that I hope we walk away with. So here's the definition of quasihomogeneity. And we're only going to do this for curve singularities. So we look at a point, suppose our curve is singular at that point that is going to be quasihomogeneous if there's basically a holomorphic change of coordinates so that the corresponding polynomial at that point is homogeneous. Now that might not speak to you. It doesn't really speak to me. So let's talk about some other ways to view this quasihomogeneity condition, because it's actually, there's a much nicer way to define quasi homogeneity than this.
00:26:23.394 - 00:27:03.664, Speaker B: Again, we're staying in the case of a singular point, of a plane curve. At a singular point, we can localize and look at the ring of power series. And there's two numbers that are associated with that singularity, which are called the Milner and charina numbers. So the Milner number is simply this formal power series ring modded out by the two partials of our defining polynomial. And the Churina number is the dimension. These are both going to be finite dimensional vector spaces, I should say, because it's a singularity. And the Churina number is where we take the two partials of our defining polynomial and throw in the defining polynomial itself.
00:27:03.664 - 00:27:36.236, Speaker B: So, obviously, the Turina number is going to be less than the Milner number, because I've thrown in an extra equation. And for curves, Riefen proved in 1967 that you're a singular, that you're a quasi, quasi homogeneous singularity. Exactly. When the Milner and sherena numbers are equal. And Sato generalized this to higher dimensional hyper surfaces. So these Milner and Trina numbers give us a way to understand quasi homogeneity. So what? So let's see something.
00:27:36.236 - 00:28:11.744, Speaker B: So, here's an example. This surprised me. I think this is indicating the subtlety of the quasi homogeneous condition. So if we take this configuration, this is a line conic configuration, we can see that there's five singular points, four ordinary singularities, which are normal crossing. And then I also have an ordinary singularity at the origin, where I have, where I have all five branches of the curve meeting. But you can see this is an ordinary singularity. I have five distinct tangent directions there.
00:28:11.744 - 00:28:45.942, Speaker B: And so it's easy to check that this is not quasi homogeneous. And the reason is that the degree of the jacobian ideal is the sum of the church numbers. Now, the nice thing is you can compute the degree of the jacobian ideal purely algebraically without doing anything. You can type it in the computer, and we'll spit it back out. And in this case, we get that the degree of the jacobian ideal is 19. So the Milner number of an ordinary singularity is just the n. If I have n branches, it's just n minus one squared.
00:28:45.942 - 00:29:24.606, Speaker B: So the sum of the Milner numbers here would be 1234 plus four squared, because five minus one squared is 16. So the sum of the Miller numbers is 20. But you can compute using any computer algebra system that the degree of the jacobian ideal is 19. Which means in particular that even though the Milner number at that singularity is 16, the Turina number is 15. So this singular, this point right here is not a quasihomogeneous singularity. Again, what's the takeaway? You cannot understand this quasi homogeneous condition just by looking at the singularity. It's quite a.
00:29:24.606 - 00:29:41.910, Speaker B: It's a subtle, it's a very subtle point. Okay, so what? So here's some more examples of free line arrangements. And I. There's a reason I've got these free line arrangements up here. So of course, I should really have a picture. This one, we've already seen that. We've seen this line arrangement before.
00:29:41.910 - 00:30:02.534, Speaker B: This is a very interesting arrangement. This hessian arrangement. It consists of. It doesn't appear to be the case, but each of these cubics factors. So this is a configuration of twelve lines. And then there's this fermat arrangement. So why do I have these things here? Well, it turns out.
00:30:02.534 - 00:30:23.290, Speaker B: So this is another ingredient that we're going to discuss. I'm doing a zoom talk. Sorry, sorry. Just got someone knocking. So these are actually the union of singular members of certain pencils. And I want to say one thing about this hessian arrangement. So if you take any smooth cubic curve, it's going to have nine inflection points.
00:30:23.290 - 00:30:53.794, Speaker B: And those nine inflection points, if you. There's triples of them that are actually collinear. There's twelve of them that are. You have twelve sets of, uh, triple inflection points that are. And those twelve lines are exactly the twelve lines that make up this hessian arrangement. So this is a, this is a sort of related to very, very classical geometry. But what's the takeaway? The takeaway is that these free arrangements somehow are corresponding to singular fibers of certain pencils.
00:30:53.794 - 00:31:20.930, Speaker B: So that's another ingredient that's going to appear later in the talk. All right, so here's the first theorem. So this is a beautiful theorem, in my opinion, of valles. So if we take a pair of reduced polynomials and look at their intersection. So this is a complete intersection. I have D squared distinct points. I take two homogeneous polynomials and three variables such that they're a complete intersection.
00:31:20.930 - 00:32:01.714, Speaker B: I have not just a complete intersection, but a reduced complete intersection. So I have d squared distinct points and then I take. I'm sorry, I'll be right back. I just have to. Yes, I am. I'm doing a zoom top. So this theorem of Jean's from about eight years ago says that if we take the singular curves in this pencil, right? So I have, the pencil here is going to be, I take some a parameter a times f and another parameter b times g, and I let a and b variable, I'm using s and t as my parameters here.
00:32:01.714 - 00:32:41.540, Speaker B: And I take k elements of this pencil. So I'm just taking k arbitrary curves. So I'm taking some k points s and t, and I take that union of those curves. Then that corresponding curve is free with these exponents two d minus two and d times k minus two plus one. Exactly. When f times d, remember d was this set of all the singular curves, and f is one of these defining polynomials. It could as well be g, that the union of those singular points is contained in this dk, which is the union of the curves making the pencil.
00:32:41.540 - 00:33:29.134, Speaker B: And, but notice we still have this, this hypothesis about the singularities being quasi homogeneous and that quasi homogeneous. For the addition deletion theorem that I proved with tarao and Yostranaga, we also required the singularities to be quasi homogeneous. And basically the idea is that when the singularities are quasi homogeneous, that meant the Milner and charina numbers are equal. And that means you can actually understand the multiplicity of a singularity just by looking at what's going on at it. So now we're ready for our new player. So we want to dispense with this quasihomogeneous condition, and this is the definition of an eigenscheme. And again, I'm only going to do this for polynomials that are polynomials and three variables.
00:33:29.134 - 00:33:50.504, Speaker B: Yes, your last slide. Go back. Yeah, I see a condition with f on the last line, but the pencil is defined by f and g. So what happened to g in that? That's what I was saying, Frank. So I said it could as well be, you could use g instead. So this is equally applicable with g. So you could say FD is contained in this, or GD is contained in this.
00:33:50.504 - 00:34:38.678, Speaker B: So here's the definition of the eigenscheme. So I have three homogeneous polynomials of the same degree, and then I do this weird construction where I take a matrix, I make them one column of the matrix, I take my variables x, y and z. Again, we're in polynomial mean three variables, and I take this, the two by two minors of this matrix, and that's going to define what we call the eigenscheme. So what are some properties of the eigenscheme? The first one is that if I have a curve that's contained in this. So p one, p two, p three. Could there's multiple things that could happen there. If p one, p two, and p three share a common factor, right? They could share a common factor, and I have some curve that.
00:34:38.678 - 00:35:15.294, Speaker B: Or even if they don't share a common factor, they could just define a bunch of points. If I have a curve that's sitting inside the corresponding variety. Well, if the curve sits inside this variety, that would mean exactly that. P one, p two, and p three are sharing a common factor, then c is in the eigenscheme. So if your eigenscheme contains a curve, that's actually going to mean that these polynomials all shared a common factor. So what if they don't share a common factor? So, suppose that you've got a finite set of points, or even an empty point. Empty set of points.
00:35:15.294 - 00:35:47.326, Speaker B: You could still have your eigenscheme being codimension one. So this is a little counterintuitive, because you're thinking, okay, here's a set of polynomials that defines a zero scheme. And then I take this, the two by two is this matrix. And you might think, well, x, y, z define the irrelevant ideal. This is probably also going to be a zero dimensional scheme, but that's not the case. And here's an example of what could fail. And I want to talk through this just so we develop a little bit of dexterity with eigenschemes, is if my p one, p two, and p three are, as we've written down here.
00:35:47.326 - 00:36:09.244, Speaker B: Well, you can see that. Just let's look at one of these two by two minors. X times p one minus, sorry, x times p two minus y times p one. Well, I have x times p two. That's going to give me an XYF factor. And then I'm subtracting y times p one. That's going to give me a y xf factor.
00:36:09.244 - 00:36:39.662, Speaker B: So those two pieces will cancel, and I get g. Well, I get something times a gq. I get y times gq one and x times gq two. So clearly that two by two minor, given by the top two by two, sorry, will have a factor of g. But that's a symmetric condition. So the eigenscheme will have v of g in it. So the behavior of this eigenscheme seems perhaps a little mysterious.
00:36:39.662 - 00:37:25.754, Speaker B: So let's look at eigenschemes a little more. So, the first thing is that this is an easy exercise, that if the eigenscheme is actually finite, so when we say finite, we mean zero dimensional, then the ideal sheath of the eigenscheme is defined by exactly that the syzygies of the eigenscheme are exactly given by this matrix. So, and the length is the second churn class. Let's ignore that second churn class. This is just, it's given as a number where, remember, n was the degree of the defining polynomial. So these all, p one, p two, p three were degree n. And so when we do have a zero scheme, the degree of that zero scheme is given this way.
00:37:25.754 - 00:38:05.144, Speaker B: So what? So this is where I said eigenschemes are going to be related to that Sato criterion. So when. So suppose that we do have a zero dimensional scheme, and I'm going to take some polynomial of degree n plus one such that. And this is, I shouldn't have had written it this way. This is just all that this is saying is that f is a polynomial which goes through that scheme and is of degree n. So we think of this as, I guess one could think of this as saying that f is a degree n polynomial, which lies in the ideal of that scheme. Exactly.
00:38:05.144 - 00:38:48.594, Speaker B: When we have three polynomials, q one, q two, q three of an appropriate degree, such that the determinant of this matrix is cf. And if you remember, this is exactly Sato's criterion. So we're sort of translating Satos criterion into some condition related to eigenschemes. So that's the first step. And this is somehow the raison d'tre, so to speak, for the eigenscheme. The eigenscheme, remember, is just these sort of the first two columns of this matrix. And that is if, I mean, if you were just doing pattern matching and you knew Satos criterion, you'd say, oh, maybe eigenschemes are related to this Satos criterion because of this, of this sort of dilemma.
00:38:48.594 - 00:39:30.926, Speaker B: All right, so here's the first theorem, and it's giving us a theorem about freeness. So the result of this is freeness, but it's related to this eigenscheme condition. And really what this is is just taking Satos condition and then marrying it up with the definition of an eigenscheme. So what's the theorem? Suppose that we have derivation, and when we say the degree is a, that means the degree of these polynomials is a. And this derivation has an eigenscheme because I have these three polynomials, p one, p two, p three. And we're going to suppose that the eigenscheme is finite. Then if we take some polynomials, which is eaten by this derivation.
00:39:30.926 - 00:40:24.388, Speaker B: So if I have some polynomial that the derivation eats and spits out zero, when is it free? It's free exactly when it is an element of the eigenscheme ideal. And again, this is really using Satos criterion and translating it into eigenschemes. The one thing that is important, and I'm going to kind of gloss over this, is that these exponents being fixed is important. If you have a free curve of degree five with two, two exponents, remember that exponents sum to the degree of the curve minus one. But if you take generators for dare two, the two generators for the module of derivations, because of this condition, these are both degree two. You could take one of those derivations, or you can take linear forms and multiply it. This is a derivation because these are, these mu and nu are generators.
00:40:24.388 - 00:40:55.590, Speaker B: So if I take some multiple of each of them, it's still a derivation. And v of f was free already, but it certainly doesn't have these exponents, three one, because, well, we've already said it had exponents two two. So one does have to be a little bit careful with the bookkeeping. But that's sort of an aside. All right, so here's another interesting player. Oops, sorry, my bad. So here's another interesting player, and it's kind of almost trivial observation.
00:40:55.590 - 00:41:39.402, Speaker B: And so suppose that we take, and this is headed towards our construction of free curves, a construction of free curves that is new. And so if we take a pair of polynomials with no common factors. So this is going to define a complete intersection, right? So f and g are two polynomials which define a complete intersection. Then there is actually a canonical derivation associated to the pencil that these things generate. And so the canonical derivation is this matrix that we've written down here. And so if I take, and you might say, well, this is kind of b's, because the DXf and the dxG, these are polynomials. And then I have these differential operators.
00:41:39.402 - 00:43:21.344, Speaker B: But obviously if I take the determinant of this matrix, what I'm going to get is a polynomial differential operator. So I'll have the coefficients of these partials, and then I'll have Dx, dy and DZ. And so why is this a derivation on the eigenscheme? Well, it's basically because when I plug in some, any multiple, if I plug in an AF plus BG and put that in with my DxDy Dz, those are obviously linear combinations of these dxfs and dxgs, right? So if you sort of plug into this, these Dx's an element of the pencil, this determinant's going to vanish simply because when you plug it in to this matrix, you're getting three columns that are linearly, by construction, linearly dependent. So we have this sort of canonical derivation that's associated to a pencil, and then we have an eigenscheme that's going to be related to this, this canonical derivation, because this derivation has coefficients that are, now that, what is the, what are the coefficients? The p I's are going to be the two by two minors of this, of this matrix over here. So if I take this submatrix, take the two by two minors, those give me an eigenscheme, and then what we, what turns out to be the case is that that eigenscheme can be written as the base locus, right? So f and g were a complete intersection. So this b is going to be zero dimensional subscheme. And that again is because f and g had no common factor union with the union with this v of f v.
00:43:21.344 - 00:44:06.682, Speaker B: The, this is, this is the p one, p two and p three that define our eigenscheme. It doesn't have to be finite, but when the case that's most of interesting to us is when n and m are equal. And then we define a curve exactly when the pencil contains a non reduced curve. This is all preparation for the following proposition. So here's the first construction. This is not our main construction. So if I take a pair of reduced polynomials such that this corresponding variety, which is our eigenscheme, is finite, and we take integers such that the LCM is written this way, an and BMW.
00:44:06.682 - 00:44:35.924, Speaker B: And we have, because of this, b of our eigenscheme is finite. We look at the associated eigenscheme. This was a finite scheme. Remember, this is just the two by two minors. This is p one, p two, p three. And then we look at the eigenscheme of that, which is, remember a different object, because that's the miners of this matrix. The eigenscheme was the miners of this matrix of the x's and the p's.
00:44:35.924 - 00:45:05.034, Speaker B: Then we have a finite number of curves that are singular outside the base locus. Remember, the base locus is just where f and g, both the common zeros of f and g. So v of f g. So we have a finite number of singular curves, and then our scheme gamma and gamma is the eigenscheme. So this is describing the eigenscheme. So this is really nice. This is a very concrete description of what this eigenscheme is.
00:45:05.034 - 00:45:28.786, Speaker B: It's simply the union of the base locus. So the v of f g, and this z, and z was exactly the z was the two by two minors of the p one, p two, and p three. So what? So, I want to talk now. We're going to have the main theorem in a second, but I want to have an example. So here's an example. Suppose I have a pencil of conic. So here's two conics.
00:45:28.786 - 00:45:59.318, Speaker B: I'm going to take some scalar multiple of xc, some other scalar multiple of z squared minus xy. Then we can compute the canonical derivate. All these things are very eminently computable. We compute the canonical derivation. We find its eigenscheme has length seven, which is one plus two plus four, which we knew. And here's the ideal of the eigenscheme. And our previous proposition shows that this is a free curve.
00:45:59.318 - 00:46:18.024, Speaker B: So this is something new we haven't seen. This is in the sort of the free divisor literature. This is a new beast. And I want to take a little pause for a minute here. So what do we have? I want to convince you that these things are also, one of the things in the title of the conference is computational. Let's do this computation. So, we've got xZ.
00:46:18.024 - 00:46:45.690, Speaker B: I'm paying homage to the fact that the conference is in Canada, and we have z squared minus xy. So let me get out of here for a second. Let's go pull up a terminal window and do this in Macaulay too, for 2 seconds here. Let's see. Got to make that bigger. Oops. Okay, let's do this.
00:46:45.690 - 00:47:18.780, Speaker B: So here, let's do this computation in m two, and we'll call it two. Let's do. Our ring is, we'll just work in a finite characteristic. We could, if you wanted to be pedantic, we could work over Q. What were our polynomials? Our polynomials were f was xz, and g was equal to z squared minus xy. Let's take the corresponding arrangement, f times g. So there's our arrangement.
00:47:18.780 - 00:47:45.756, Speaker B: This is, that's the defining, defining equation for our curve. Let's take the jacobian ideal of that. And now let's compute the kernel of this. So, I want to do mingens of the kernel of the transpose of this matrix. These are our syzygies. These are our three partial derivatives. I flip it.
00:47:45.756 - 00:48:16.124, Speaker B: So I have a three by one matrix. And I want to compute the minimal generators. What are the minimal generators? Oh, one minimal generator of degree one and one minimal generator of degree two. And there's two generators. This exactly says, this is a prearrangement whose exponents are one and two. So let's go back to this one and get back to our slideshow. All right, so this is what we just did this computation.
00:48:16.124 - 00:48:59.214, Speaker B: So that's an example. And now, following on with this, if we instead take three smooth curves of the pencil, our theorem says that this thing's going to be free with exponents two and three. And so what's an example of three elements of the pencil? I would have something like f and g were our two defining quadrics. I take those three things and multiply them out. And notice this is bad notation over here. I was going to write, I'm going to write, this is the eigenscheme. So the eigenscheme of that thing is going to be, remember, what are we doing for the eigenscheme? This is, we're taking that, the xyz and the p one, p two, p three, and we're writing these as u, v and w.
00:48:59.214 - 00:49:32.928, Speaker B: So if you do the same construction instead of with two osculating conics, the theorem says that those are not free. But if we take three osculating conics, which I've tried drawn below here, then this is an example. What's nice about this three osculating conics, this has the same behavior as our bad non quasi homogeneous singularity. And in fact, this singularity right here at the point, well, p is supposed to. P is this. Oh, I see. It's in my figure.
00:49:32.928 - 00:50:36.426, Speaker B: The point where I'm hovering where there's the three conics are all tangent is a non quasi homogeneous singularity. But in fact, this is also a free curve arrangement that is illustrated by. This is the punchline. This is our main theorem, which is that if we take a pair of reduced polynomials with no common factors, and we take the two by two minors of that matrix of the Jacobians of those, sorry. We take the jacobian ideal of those two polynomials, that gives us a two by three matrix, then take the minors of that, and that's a finite scheme. Then we have this construction that says, if we take a union of a bunch of the curves in the corresponding pencil with a certain condition on the lcMs, and we take a polynomial of a certain degree, which divides this product, then that's a free curve, and it's a free curve, sorry. It's a free curve with certain exponents, exactly when f is in the eigenscheme.
00:50:36.426 - 00:51:24.022, Speaker B: So this gives us a construction of free curves, which is independent of the behavior, the singularity. So this is the first general construction of free curves, where you don't have any hypothesis on the singular points. So I think I'll close with this little example. So we were doing this example of a pair of conics. So when is a pair of conics going to be give us a free thing, and it's going to be free exactly when you contain the eigenscheme. And so here's some more behavior of unions of conics. If we have conics which intersect in only two points.
00:51:24.022 - 00:52:09.870, Speaker B: So obviously you could have two conics where you have a triple point and a single point of intersection, then you need three members of that corresponding pencil to contain the eigenscheme. And if you take three, so three members of the pencil, then that gives you a free arrangement with exponents two, three. And if you have the two curves meeting in a quadruple point, so there's only one point where they meet, but it meets with multiplicity four. Then the union of two smooth members of the pencil has the eigenscheme. And that means that two smooth members of the pencil give you a free arrangement with exponents one and two. So I should have had a little slide that said, thanks a lot and happy birthday to Frank, but I don't. So that's the end of the talk.
00:52:09.870 - 00:53:43.784, Speaker B: What's the takeaway? The takeaway really is that there's this, as I said, there's an interesting problem in combinatorial, I guess I'd say combinatorial discrete geometry on, if you think of hyperplane arrangements as falling into that class, which is still an open question, which is when is an arrangement free? You can generalize that to hyper surfaces, which, if you're sort of a member of the broader algebraic geometry community and interested in Grotendijk's algebraic Durham theorem, then this is essentially saying, when does a certain sheaf, when is a certain sheath a vector bundle? So in general, this module of logarithmic forms is not a vector bundle. Saito proved that when you have normal crossings, it's a vector bundle. Here we have non normal crossings. And yet this freeness condition is that it's not just a vector bundle, it's a vector bundle which splits as a sum of line bundles. So you could ask more generally for a hypersurface. When is this? When it, when is the sheath of logarithmic tangent vectors a vector bundle? Or you could ask the finer question, which is what we've been talking about here, which is when does that, when is this a, either a free module, if you're a commutative algebraist, or when does the corresponding vector bundle split as a sum of lines bundles? And this is even in this very simple case of curves in p two, there's lots of, lots of subtle points, and it's something that's also easy to compute billions of examples of. And I'll close with a personal conjecture, which is Tarao's conjecture is false.
00:53:43.784 - 00:54:19.304, Speaker B: And the evidence for this is that there are examples of combinatorially equivalent line arrangements. Neither of them are free, but the degrees of the syzygies changes. So basically what that says is even if you're non free, you don't have the same degree generators for combinatorial equivalent arrangements. And so there's probably a way, I would think, to push that up and find a counterexample to Degrao's conjecture. So good place to stop, I think I was supposed to be 50 minutes and that was 54. So thanks, guys. Let me kill this and stop sharing screen.
00:54:25.964 - 00:54:29.104, Speaker A: Thank you very much, Hal. Are there any questions?
00:54:35.204 - 00:55:03.774, Speaker C: So, I have a question about the, about sort of genericity in the choice of your curves. I was noticing that in the examples you were able to with conics and lines and so on, it didn't seem to matter, which, like what the slope of the lines were. When you had several lines passing through the conic and your theorem was just any, you would have a pencil and you take any points you want. So are there theorems where you have some collection of curve arrangements and maybe for a general choice you get something that's free?
00:55:03.894 - 00:55:26.740, Speaker B: This is a great question. So even for lines and conics, what I think would be an interesting question. I actually asked some folks who are in the singularities community about this. So forget about the freeness, right? Just talk about behavior at a singular point of a line in conic. So lines and conics. And so what are the invariants there? Well, we certainly have, and let's even make this an ordinary singularity. Right.
00:55:26.740 - 00:56:12.462, Speaker B: So I certainly have the list of my slopes, but I also would have the curvatures of the various conics. Right. So I have this list of two invariants, the slopes of my tangent lines, the curvatures of the conics. And so is there some condition? And it's certainly true that there is, I think at least from experiment, I should say. But it's true that there's basically, I mean, you could imagine that there's sort of a Zyriski closed set where some interesting behavior occurs there. And that's a very sort of, kind of in the circle of the questions you're asking. But even for that example of the, let me go back to, well, I'll just say it.
00:56:12.462 - 00:57:18.750, Speaker B: So there was the example of, the first example of a non quasi homogeneous singularity where we had a nice conic and then four lines that were going through a point of that. 412345 lines, four lines. Four lines going through a point. There are configurations of lines in special position where you actually lose the, you turn into a quasihomogeneous singularity. That singularity was not quasihomogeneous, but for certain special positions, you get quasihomogeneity. So this quasihomogeneity, I think is almost certainly, well, just from the definition of Milner number and Sherina number being equal, that's basically going to be a Zyriski closed condition, because quasihomogeneity says that f is in the ideal generated by the two partials, right? That's what that condition of reef intersects it. And so I think that you generally do see interesting behavior happening, but analyzing that just sort of in the singularities thing, even for lines and conics, the singularity, it doesn't seem to be done.
00:57:18.750 - 00:58:18.484, Speaker B: And I think it'd be a fun project to say, okay, you know, here's my list of slopes and curvatures. What's the, what's the behavior for something like this? Al, do you know any irreducible hypersurface? And I had a mention of degree three or more that's free. Irreducible hypersurface of degree three or more that is free. So obviously, so the first thing to say is, obviously, if your hypersurface is smooth, it never will be free, for the obvious reason that if you're smooth, the jacobian ideal is going to be empty. Right? And so you're never going to have a sort of a, that freeness is saying that the jacobian ideal can be written as that. It's, the jacobian ideal is for, if it's a singular hypersurface, the jacobian ideal being, or the hypersurface being. Free says that the jacobian ideal is, is given by a Hilbert birch matrix.
00:58:18.484 - 00:58:54.104, Speaker B: That is the syzage. The, the Jacobian can be written as the maximal minors of an n by one by n minus one by n matrix. I think it should be fairly easy to find irreducible hyper surfaces which are free with some interesting behavior for the singular locus. I don't know one off the top of my head, though, so, but I don't think, I think that would be an easy question to answer. In fact, you know what? I'll send you one by the. If it exists, I'll send you one by the end of the day.
00:58:56.604 - 00:58:58.664, Speaker A: Thank you. One more.
00:59:00.004 - 00:59:14.480, Speaker C: One other question from the picture. The early one you showed, that was basically a braid arrangement in the plane with the coordinate lines. And the other, what about, like the braid or the projected braid arrangement in PN? Is that.
00:59:14.612 - 00:59:20.804, Speaker B: Yeah, those are all free. So those are reflection arrangements. So that the. Yeah. So those are free arrangements. Yeah.
00:59:24.944 - 00:59:27.724, Speaker A: Okay. So let's thank Hal once more.
00:59:29.864 - 00:59:57.302, Speaker B: So again, thanks. Thanks for the invitation. Happy birthday, Frank. And amusingly enough, I'm about to go talk about the logarithmic cotangent bundle for a bunch, for toric varieties to a bunch of physicists. So, you know, the logarithmic tangent bundle, even though you might think, think it's an esoteric object, does pop up in lots of places. So thanks again. Happy birthday, Frank and I got to give another talk somewhere else, so I'm sorry I won't be at the next talk.
00:59:57.302 - 00:59:58.274, Speaker B: See you guys.
00:59:58.574 - 00:59:58.974, Speaker A: Bye. Help.
