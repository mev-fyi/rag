00:00:00.320 - 00:00:00.664, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:00:00.686 - 00:00:10.354, Speaker B: Thanks, Dima. Also, Ben is Jacob's postdoc something. Anyways, it's not so relevant, but anyways, not necessary knowledge for the talk, but still important.
00:00:12.054 - 00:00:12.798, Speaker A: Great.
00:00:12.966 - 00:00:23.526, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, Dima, for the introduction. Yeah, I have a talk prepared, but maybe not all the dates on the citations and things. So if there's something wrong with the.
00:00:23.550 - 00:00:26.110, Speaker A: Citation history here, feel free to correct.
00:00:26.142 - 00:00:33.134, Speaker B: Me, but try to be nice about it. So, no, I was going to add the years.
00:00:35.274 - 00:00:36.454, Speaker A: Come on, Brent.
00:00:36.754 - 00:00:40.294, Speaker B: All right, so I'm going to be speaking on consequences.
00:00:42.794 - 00:00:43.586, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:00:43.650 - 00:00:49.414, Speaker B: Yeah, this is actually a plus. So I'm going to talk about consequences of the random matrix.
00:00:52.374 - 00:00:57.514, Speaker A: Resolution of the.
00:00:59.734 - 00:01:02.834, Speaker B: Abbreviated PT Pierce and Tom conjecture.
00:01:05.094 - 00:01:12.374, Speaker A: This is joint work with David Jekyll.
00:01:12.414 - 00:01:50.614, Speaker B: Who'S here virtually, you know, up to, up to finite index and tree. Yeah, exactly. Who's always here. And so, okay, I will recall the conjecture which was stated in Murray's talk, because unlike Murray's talk, mine is going to be focused on the actual operator algebra's structural implications and not as much on the random matrices.
00:01:51.954 - 00:01:55.090, Speaker A: So, you know, she focused, you know.
00:01:55.122 - 00:01:56.666, Speaker B: In a nice way on the random.
00:01:56.690 - 00:02:02.634, Speaker A: Matrix part of it, and I would have sort of focus on the operator operator algebra.
00:02:02.674 - 00:02:07.774, Speaker B: So this is a, was a conjecture. Now, a theorem. I never know how to address these things.
00:02:09.434 - 00:02:15.200, Speaker A: By Peterson, Tom in 2011, uh, which.
00:02:15.232 - 00:02:38.096, Speaker B: Was, suppose that I have a diffuse, an amenable von Neumann subalgebra of, uh, say interpolated free group factor. If you know what that is, then you know what that is. If not, just think that t is an integer here, and this is the free group factor on t letters. And when I say less than or equal to, I mean that it's a.
00:02:38.120 - 00:02:40.566, Speaker A: Unital von Neumann subalgebra, okay?
00:02:40.590 - 00:02:54.754, Speaker B: It shares the same mutant and it's closed in the appropriate topology. So suppose that we have this. Then there is a unique maximal amenable p.
00:02:56.974 - 00:02:58.174, Speaker A: Inside of l of f t.
00:02:58.254 - 00:03:09.806, Speaker B: So it's maximal amenable as a subalgebra of l. Every proper super algebra of it is not amenable. Uh, so that, uh, q is contained.
00:03:09.830 - 00:03:10.554, Speaker A: In p.
00:03:12.814 - 00:03:23.254, Speaker B: Again, some of you have seen this talk, or versions of it, uh, a bit. So, so you'll, you'll already know the caution I'm going to provide you. Uh, but let me nevertheless give it.
00:03:23.374 - 00:03:25.606, Speaker A: Which is that, um, you know, the.
00:03:25.630 - 00:03:33.906, Speaker B: Existence here is not really an issue. That's, that's more or less Zorn's lemma. It's not maybe trivial from that, but it's a good exercise. But the uniqueness is really the crucial.
00:03:33.930 - 00:03:36.374, Speaker A: Point here, that there's only one.
00:03:36.674 - 00:03:40.934, Speaker B: So a priori, there could be several Zorn's lemba doesn't give you any kind of uniqueness.
00:03:42.794 - 00:03:43.674, Speaker A: And I'll give a different.
00:03:43.714 - 00:03:53.282, Speaker B: Reformulation of this later. I want to sort of briefly mention the history, but there's sort of lots of results in this direction. So I'm just going to throw a.
00:03:53.298 - 00:03:55.330, Speaker A: Bunch of names on the board and.
00:03:55.362 - 00:04:06.794, Speaker B: Not sort of fully explain the results. But Popa in 1983 proved maximal amenability.
00:04:08.774 - 00:04:12.486, Speaker A: Of the generator masa.
00:04:12.510 - 00:04:21.798, Speaker B: And this is the first example of a maximal amenable subalgebra of something that wasn't a factor.
00:04:21.926 - 00:04:22.214, Speaker C: Right?
00:04:22.254 - 00:04:24.282, Speaker A: So this is an abelian algebra, but.
00:04:24.298 - 00:04:43.514, Speaker B: It'S still maximal amenable. And up until then, people thought maybe that all maximal amenable things inside factors were also factors. And then there's lots of other results in this direction. Certainly Wojkolescu's foundational work.
00:04:43.554 - 00:04:46.162, Speaker A: Again, I forgot the precise dates, but.
00:04:46.178 - 00:05:03.128, Speaker B: In the nineties on absence of cortan is sort of pointing in this direction, as is goes, results on primeness. And then there are lots of others. There's like, this sparked a whole area of research on just sort of figuring out what are examples of maximal amenable.
00:05:03.176 - 00:05:05.792, Speaker A: Subalgebras of, well, things in general, but.
00:05:05.808 - 00:05:10.856, Speaker B: In particular for free group factors. A lot of these papers are focused on proving that a specific subalgebra of.
00:05:10.880 - 00:05:15.694, Speaker A: A free group factor is maximal immunity. Okay, um.
00:05:22.354 - 00:05:45.316, Speaker B: I'm going to tell you that this conjecture is true. So all of them. But, but, yes, very good question. Uh, but, but, okay, I will actually, in a more serious manner, address this in a bit. Uh, in previous work, they, they sort of investigated as formulated like this. This is not something you can test example by example in a very easy manner, but there's a reformulation where you.
00:05:45.340 - 00:05:46.796, Speaker A: Can, and a lot of work was.
00:05:46.820 - 00:05:49.108, Speaker B: Done in that direction. So I'll talk about that in a bit.
00:05:49.276 - 00:05:50.744, Speaker A: Yeah, but good question.
00:05:52.644 - 00:06:28.386, Speaker B: And so these all sort of in some sense motivate this conjecture, but a lot of the motivation came from the Peters and Tom paper itself, where, okay, they prove this not for the algebra, but for the group. Now, if I say it that way, it's kind of silly. Amenable sub algebras of free group, or amenable subgroups of free groups are just cyclic. And it's not hard from the combinatorics of free groups to figure out that the only way you can be contained in another cyclic group is one of you to be a power of the other and et cetera, and work with non canceling words. But they didn't just prove it for.
00:06:28.410 - 00:06:30.530, Speaker A: Free groups, they proved it for things.
00:06:30.562 - 00:06:34.946, Speaker B: Like hyperbolic groups or things which are measure equivalent to free groups, if you know what that means, or lots of.
00:06:34.970 - 00:06:37.454, Speaker A: Sort of things that are analytically similar to free groups.
00:06:37.854 - 00:06:40.566, Speaker B: And once you have sort of, and they proved it using l two betting.
00:06:40.590 - 00:06:43.222, Speaker A: Numbers, which is okay if you don't.
00:06:43.238 - 00:06:55.902, Speaker B: Know what that is, that's some analytic tool. So if you have sort of analytic reasons for this fact, you start to expect that you have some shot of proving it on the von Neumann algebraic level, instead of just having this purely algebraic proof of, well, all the amenable subgroups are cyclic.
00:06:55.958 - 00:06:57.714, Speaker A: And think about that.
00:06:59.574 - 00:07:10.264, Speaker B: So there was a separate reformulation of this conjecture in terms of what's known as the absorbing amenability property. And what it says is.
00:07:12.844 - 00:07:13.228, Speaker C: So let.
00:07:13.236 - 00:07:14.264, Speaker B: Me say it like this.
00:07:14.964 - 00:07:18.436, Speaker A: So we'll say that a subalgebra of.
00:07:18.460 - 00:07:41.496, Speaker B: A von Neumann algebra, this is just some von Neumann algebra, has the absorbing amenability property. If whenever I take a subalgebra which.
00:07:41.520 - 00:07:44.496, Speaker A: Is diffuse, and let's say this is.
00:07:44.520 - 00:07:53.176, Speaker B: A, this is a finite von Neumann algebra, if you don't know what it is, don't worry about it. But basically, I just want to avoid some potential issues that I don't want to talk about.
00:07:53.200 - 00:07:55.144, Speaker A: So if you have a diffuse amenable.
00:07:55.184 - 00:08:15.334, Speaker B: Subalgebra whose intersection with p is diffuse, then it's actually contained in P. I guess I should mention diffuse means no non zero minimal projections. But in the finite case, you can just think that it means that you have an isomorphic copy of l infinity.
00:08:15.374 - 00:08:21.110, Speaker A: Functions on the unit interval as a subalgebra. Okay?
00:08:21.262 - 00:08:27.922, Speaker B: And so what this is saying is that in some sense, if you have large intersection with something amenable, you have.
00:08:27.938 - 00:08:30.834, Speaker A: To actually contain it, right?
00:08:30.874 - 00:08:42.994, Speaker B: So for instance, on the free groups themselves, if you have a cyclic subgroup which is sort of maximal cyclic, which is not a power of any other.
00:08:43.034 - 00:08:49.654, Speaker A: Word, if it intersects infinitely another cyclic subgroup, it has to actually contain it.
00:08:50.294 - 00:09:09.742, Speaker B: And again, Peterson, Tom proved this for other things that are like free groups, like hyperbolic groups and stuff like that. And now sort of to address George's question, this is something that you can test sort of example by example, you can try to take p to be, say this, this generator Masa, this l.
00:09:09.758 - 00:09:11.982, Speaker A: Of z, free product, one inside of.
00:09:11.998 - 00:09:19.004, Speaker B: L of z, free product z. And you can try to prove that it has this property. And this was done.
00:09:20.984 - 00:09:23.896, Speaker A: Surreal routier proved.
00:09:23.920 - 00:09:30.484, Speaker B: This, and then this was also proved. This again sparked a lot of research. Again, I'm just going to throw names on the board.
00:09:32.864 - 00:09:33.600, Speaker A: In the interest of.
00:09:33.632 - 00:09:38.576, Speaker B: Time, but I will say sort of a bit about this. So Ozawa had a paper in this.
00:09:38.600 - 00:09:42.592, Speaker A: Direction, Brotier Wen had a paper in.
00:09:42.608 - 00:09:54.404, Speaker B: This direction, Boutonnier Courier had a sort of a very general paper about this absorption for free products.
00:09:57.264 - 00:10:00.884, Speaker A: Prak Shimada when.
00:10:01.824 - 00:10:21.784, Speaker B: And then sort of. One thing that's, that's important for my talk in a self serving manner is this paper of myself, David Brent and Thomas Sinclair. And so again, I don't want to go into a whole bunch of details in this direction.
00:10:21.944 - 00:10:26.604, Speaker A: I'll also mention some work of David just by himself.
00:10:26.944 - 00:10:30.192, Speaker B: I don't want to go into a whole bunch of details, but basically what I want to say about sort of.
00:10:30.208 - 00:10:33.712, Speaker A: The first, I'm not good at combatoric.
00:10:33.728 - 00:10:34.760, Speaker B: So I can't count.
00:10:34.952 - 00:10:39.088, Speaker A: But the first, I think five, yeah, five.
00:10:39.216 - 00:10:40.272, Speaker B: Cool, I got it.
00:10:40.368 - 00:10:43.496, Speaker A: Um, the first five examples is that.
00:10:43.520 - 00:10:45.656, Speaker B: These are all focused on specific maximal.
00:10:45.680 - 00:10:47.624, Speaker A: Amenable sub algebras, right?
00:10:47.664 - 00:10:57.832, Speaker B: So something like the generator masa or the sloplossian masa or something like that. It's just proving that this example has this property. Now, the conjecture itself is equivalent to.
00:10:57.848 - 00:11:01.744, Speaker A: Saying that every maximal amenable subalgebra has this property, right?
00:11:01.784 - 00:11:05.834, Speaker B: So there were sort of just entire papers that just proved specifically specific examples.
00:11:05.994 - 00:11:10.254, Speaker A: But the conjecture is about all of them, right? It's about all maximal amenable subalge.
00:11:12.354 - 00:11:20.174, Speaker B: And, you know, these proofs that did these specific examples, they used some strengthening of Popa's asymptotic orthogonality property.
00:11:22.034 - 00:11:25.490, Speaker A: Which is nice, but sort of doesn't give you.
00:11:25.522 - 00:11:39.910, Speaker B: Sort of a path to solving the full conjecture, at least as of yet. I mean, maybe there's some modification, because in order to apply it, you need to know something about the precise structure of the subalgebra. It's hard to do something in this total generality where you don't really know.
00:11:39.942 - 00:11:43.914, Speaker A: What a maximal amenable subalgebra of the figure factor looks like.
00:11:44.654 - 00:12:32.162, Speaker B: And so the significance I want to say of these two papers is that in this, me and my co authors give sort of a free probability proof, sort of similar to, you know, in spirit, following, you know, Voikulescu's foundational result on absence of cartons, we give free probability proof, based on some random matrix models and concentration of measure that this algebra has this property. And then David. Well, it's sort of related, but mostly important work that I want to highlight that, you know, he proves for a lot of these perturbations in the sense of sort of q Gaussians and things like that, of free group factor properties that actually sort of the masa you would create turns out to be conjugate to the generator masa itself, which is.
00:12:32.178 - 00:12:34.554, Speaker A: An extremely surprising result.
00:12:34.714 - 00:12:39.530, Speaker B: When he told me that, I did not believe it was true, but it's true. And that sort of says that these.
00:12:39.562 - 00:12:41.374, Speaker A: Subalgebras also have this property.
00:12:43.434 - 00:12:52.198, Speaker C: Yes. Right.
00:12:52.246 - 00:12:55.718, Speaker B: So, yeah, it is an open problem.
00:12:55.886 - 00:12:58.110, Speaker A: If this is sort of the frustration.
00:12:58.182 - 00:13:12.554, Speaker B: With this, with this, with this Peterson Tom problem, which is that it's still an open problem if a maximal, if an abelian subalgebra, which is also maximal, amenable in the free group factor, if that's conjugate to the generator masa.
00:13:16.474 - 00:13:16.786, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:16.810 - 00:13:35.014, Speaker B: It could be prince. It could be true in principle, because they're all freely complemented. And then you do this. However, I don't currently see any route to actually proving that. I don't necessarily think that it's true. There's not really much evidence that it's true other than you can't do it.
00:13:35.554 - 00:13:38.266, Speaker A: But you know, I mean, we do.
00:13:38.370 - 00:13:42.792, Speaker B: David's work is probably the best evidence that it would be true. But I think trying to extend that.
00:13:42.808 - 00:13:46.004, Speaker A: To a very general setting is not likely.
00:13:46.944 - 00:14:01.124, Speaker B: And, you know, it's the same sort of objection you could make about a lot of these absence of cartoon results that show up that say if such and such a thing has positive first total ready number, then it has, then the generated algebra has no cartoon. I mean, those things could also be free products.
00:14:03.904 - 00:14:05.484, Speaker A: I think that's not even known.
00:14:09.804 - 00:14:10.428, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:10.556 - 00:14:12.024, Speaker B: So, uh.
00:14:13.124 - 00:14:13.628, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:13.716 - 00:14:14.164, Speaker A: Um.
00:14:14.244 - 00:14:18.900, Speaker B: So that is certainly a question flowing in the background, which I think is an important direction for future research, uh.
00:14:18.932 - 00:14:21.100, Speaker A: But is not what this addresses.
00:14:21.172 - 00:14:23.932, Speaker B: So, uh, as Murray already talked about.
00:14:24.028 - 00:14:27.908, Speaker A: Uh, this morning, um, I'm not going.
00:14:27.916 - 00:14:29.264, Speaker B: To restate the whole thing.
00:14:30.044 - 00:14:33.180, Speaker A: Uh, uh, but there's a theorem of.
00:14:33.212 - 00:14:52.992, Speaker B: Mine that, uh, this unnatural random matrix conjecture on strong convergence implies the Peterson Tom conjecture. The conjecture is what Marey stated in her talk, either for gues or har unitaries. And so this was proved in the.
00:14:53.008 - 00:14:59.364, Speaker A: Gue setting by Blinsky Kapiton, and this.
00:14:59.944 - 00:15:10.884, Speaker B: April Bordenov Collins gave a solution for the har unitary case. Each of these papers by themselves are enough to resolve the conjecture.
00:15:11.704 - 00:15:14.872, Speaker A: And you know, this, they proved on.
00:15:14.888 - 00:15:17.832, Speaker B: The nose what I ask. And then Bornoff Collins proved it for.
00:15:17.848 - 00:15:21.456, Speaker A: Harunitaries, along with like lots of questions.
00:15:21.480 - 00:15:26.468, Speaker B: That not only did I not ask, but nobody asked, and are extremely general.
00:15:26.616 - 00:15:29.756, Speaker A: Uh, so kind of, you know, they.
00:15:29.780 - 00:15:42.544, Speaker B: Have lots of fun statements like they can prove some nice estimate on LP norms when p is the most exponential size of the matrix to some power. Whereas for my conjecture you need this.
00:15:44.764 - 00:15:47.104, Speaker A: And this is much bigger than this.
00:15:48.724 - 00:15:54.296, Speaker B: So it's uh, it's, it's rather impressive work. Uh, and um.
00:15:54.440 - 00:15:57.084, Speaker C: Yeah, okay.
00:15:57.744 - 00:16:00.368, Speaker A: Um, I don't, again, I don't want.
00:16:00.376 - 00:16:37.242, Speaker B: To say much about this. This has already been sort of mentioned in, in Marie's talk. I'll mention a few things that sort of what goes into this is, is essentially sort of uh, a couple of different tools. Uh, one is again, uh, some concentration of measure argument, uh, to basically say that, well, I'll get to it in a bit. Uh, but behind this there's this notion of this entropy, this sort of measure of finite models. Uh, and so what you say is that if we're sub algebra, if that's small, then basically when you try to choose models of the subalgebra at random, you can run a concentration of measure argument to say that those models have to, have to be conjugate on this.
00:16:37.258 - 00:16:40.174, Speaker A: Subalge with very high probability.
00:16:40.914 - 00:17:04.530, Speaker B: And then you run sort of well known, uh, characterizations of non amenability in terms of getting you a spectral gap set to basically say that that can occur if you have strong convergence. And hiding in the background here is an important sister algebraic property, which is local reflexivity of, say, the siesta algebra, gender by free semicirculars or sea star.
00:17:04.562 - 00:17:09.018, Speaker A: Algebra, say, of the free group, just.
00:17:09.066 - 00:17:17.542, Speaker B: Any sort of free product of the billion things, which is true because they're exact by work of dicama and by work of Kirkberg.
00:17:17.598 - 00:17:19.434, Speaker A: Exact implies local reflexes.
00:17:21.294 - 00:17:21.998, Speaker C: Okay.
00:17:22.126 - 00:17:24.694, Speaker A: All right, so let me briefly get.
00:17:24.734 - 00:17:34.046, Speaker B: Into what's under the hood here to some degree. And so I'm going to mention very briefly, I'm not really going to even define it.
00:17:34.070 - 00:17:38.354, Speaker A: I'm just going to sort of wave at it and watch it go by.
00:17:40.474 - 00:17:42.614, Speaker B: This one bounded entropy.
00:17:48.194 - 00:17:49.738, Speaker A: So you have this, if you have.
00:17:49.746 - 00:18:01.694, Speaker B: A tracial von Eumann algebra, so that means I have a von Eumann algebra, and tau is a faithful normal tracial state. Then there's this quantity which we call the one bounded entropy.
00:18:04.104 - 00:18:04.704, Speaker C: Which is either.
00:18:04.744 - 00:18:08.104, Speaker A: Minus infinity or a non negative real.
00:18:08.144 - 00:18:09.604, Speaker B: Number or plus infinity.
00:18:10.464 - 00:18:13.656, Speaker A: Um, and instead of giving you the.
00:18:13.680 - 00:18:15.136, Speaker B: Precise definition, I'm just going to tell.
00:18:15.160 - 00:18:17.632, Speaker A: You what it does. So, I mean, there's one thing I.
00:18:17.648 - 00:18:51.304, Speaker B: Want to mention, which is that it's a modification of Woikowescu's important microstates free entropy dimension, you know, from, from a series of papers from 94 to 96. And it's, it's implicitly defined in a paper of Kenley Jung. He doesn't actually write down this constant, but I can point you to a specific part of a specific proof of a specific theorem.
00:18:53.204 - 00:18:54.532, Speaker A: That, you know, if.
00:18:54.548 - 00:19:04.644, Speaker B: You look at it, tells you this constant is there. And so observing this, I wrote down an explicit definition, and I probably got the publication date wrong.
00:19:05.744 - 00:19:06.604, Speaker C: Okay.
00:19:08.624 - 00:19:30.772, Speaker B: And so again, without going into technicalities here, it's some sort of measurement of how many finitary models you have. So, you know, you look at your matrix algebra, it's generated by some tuple of, say, self adjoints. You try to find tuples of n by n matrices of self adjoints which have the same size tuple, and so that traces of polynomials of them sort of approximately match up, and you try.
00:19:30.788 - 00:19:36.184, Speaker A: To measure how many you have. Yes, that's right.
00:19:36.844 - 00:19:50.204, Speaker B: Yeah, there's also, yeah, I believe, again, this is done last minute, so I don't have the dates, but shen and Shen Hadwin, which do, again, more or less computes the, defines the same constant.
00:19:51.344 - 00:19:52.204, Speaker C: Okay?
00:19:59.304 - 00:20:02.528, Speaker B: And so, instead of giving you the definition, mathematicians like to work with axioms.
00:20:02.576 - 00:20:04.324, Speaker A: So I'm just going to give you the property.
00:20:06.824 - 00:20:23.244, Speaker B: The first one I already mentioned, it's minus infinity, or a non negative real number plus infinity. Uh, it's non negative if and only if m em, em, embeds into an ultra power of the hyperfinite to one factor.
00:20:23.284 - 00:20:23.916, Speaker A: Okay?
00:20:24.060 - 00:20:58.304, Speaker B: Basically, if and only if m has finite approximations at every level, you know, given some degree of approximation, I can find large enough matrices which satisfy it. It's zero if, say, m is hyperfinite. And so, right by Kahn's work, this is equivalent to being amenable. We're at the fields institute, so I have to mention the fields winning work of Kant.
00:20:59.124 - 00:20:59.864, Speaker C: Great.
00:21:06.614 - 00:21:10.350, Speaker B: It's plus infinity for all the interpolated free group factors with index bigger than.
00:21:10.382 - 00:21:15.318, Speaker A: One, or just more generally, if I.
00:21:15.326 - 00:21:45.290, Speaker B: Can generate x by some tuple of, say, self adjoints whose microstates free and three dimension is bigger than one. Um, it's sub additive under joins, uh, with diffuse intersection. Uh, it's not sub additive under joins in general. Otherwise, uh, it would be zero for.
00:21:45.322 - 00:21:48.154, Speaker A: Every finite free product of abelian things.
00:21:48.194 - 00:21:50.134, Speaker B: And it's not zero for l two.
00:21:50.714 - 00:21:53.654, Speaker A: Um, oh, if they're diffuse.
00:21:55.834 - 00:21:56.402, Speaker C: Uh, so.
00:21:56.418 - 00:21:58.026, Speaker B: This, this by definition is the von.
00:21:58.050 - 00:22:02.404, Speaker A: Neumann algebra generated by the union, okay?
00:22:02.564 - 00:22:14.156, Speaker B: And so the point is, is if somehow, you know, you have large intersection between these two subalgebras and you're trying to find finitary models of both of them together, you're sort of constraint by.
00:22:14.340 - 00:22:16.044, Speaker A: You know, forcing them to sort of.
00:22:16.084 - 00:22:27.344, Speaker B: Agree on this large piece. And that gives you enough information to get this estimate. And one thing that I'm going to.
00:22:29.564 - 00:22:33.224, Speaker A: Immediately generalize, I'll list a few more.
00:22:34.404 - 00:22:36.024, Speaker B: And then give some exercises.
00:22:42.164 - 00:22:42.708, Speaker A: Is that.
00:22:42.756 - 00:23:06.724, Speaker B: If I take the normalizer of a diffuse subalgebra, so this is the unitary normalizer, um, then the entropy doesn't increase when I take the normalizer of anything diffuse. And there's one last property which, okay, if you don't know about ultra powers, just safely ignore this. If you do, maybe think about this for a bit.
00:23:07.504 - 00:23:08.244, Speaker C: If.
00:23:13.384 - 00:23:20.304, Speaker A: So, I don't say, right, if m is inside nice, is at most.
00:23:21.564 - 00:23:26.156, Speaker B: M omega, then h of m is.
00:23:26.180 - 00:23:29.824, Speaker A: At most h of m. Okay?
00:23:30.924 - 00:23:34.064, Speaker B: So here I'm embedding m into m omega diagonally.
00:23:35.484 - 00:23:36.304, Speaker C: Okay?
00:23:37.164 - 00:23:50.142, Speaker B: So for example, just from these axioms themselves, you can immediately prove that any free group factor, or interpolated free group factor does not have any cartoons of algebra. In fact, does not have any diffuse.
00:23:50.198 - 00:23:53.518, Speaker A: Regular hyper finites of algebra, right?
00:23:53.566 - 00:24:07.274, Speaker B: Because regular means that the von Neumann algebra of the normalizer is the whole thing. If that were to happen, the entropy of the free group factor would be at most the entropy of the hyperfinite thing, which is zero, but the entropy of the free group factor is plus infinity.
00:24:08.694 - 00:24:11.468, Speaker A: By a slightly more complicated argument, you.
00:24:11.476 - 00:24:16.620, Speaker B: Can recover ghuz results on primeness of free group factors. You can prove that anything for which.
00:24:16.652 - 00:24:20.692, Speaker A: This is positive cannot be generated is prime.
00:24:20.748 - 00:24:37.836, Speaker B: So to say it in a slightly simpler term cannot be generated by two commuting diffuse subalgebras. You can also prove from these properties, particularly using the last one, that it has to have property gamma. If it's a factor, say so, meaning.
00:24:37.860 - 00:24:45.106, Speaker A: That it doesn't have, you know, basically the central sequence is that the commutant.
00:24:45.130 - 00:24:48.094, Speaker B: Of m inside m omega is not diffuse.
00:24:50.434 - 00:24:54.106, Speaker A: Okay, so those are all exercises, right?
00:24:54.130 - 00:25:03.414, Speaker B: And so that's sort of the point of these axiomatic properties. It turns, you know, once you establish these, it turns some of these important theorems into sort of exercises from the axioms.
00:25:04.334 - 00:25:07.182, Speaker A: Okay, and before I get to sort.
00:25:07.198 - 00:25:08.674, Speaker B: Of fun time.
00:25:11.374 - 00:25:14.182, Speaker A: Mentioning applications, I should.
00:25:14.198 - 00:25:33.824, Speaker B: Just mention sort of what goes in between the random matrix conjecture and the Peterson Tom conjecture. Which is the following. This random matrix conjecture that Maria talked about implies.
00:25:35.724 - 00:25:38.772, Speaker A: That the statement that if.
00:25:38.788 - 00:25:45.704, Speaker B: I take diffuse, if I take a subalgebra of a figure factor.
00:25:49.924 - 00:25:50.860, Speaker A: Then the.
00:25:50.892 - 00:25:53.436, Speaker B: Statement that it has entropy zero is.
00:25:53.460 - 00:25:55.464, Speaker A: Equivalent to the statement that it's amenable.
00:25:59.384 - 00:26:24.476, Speaker B: So in other words, establishing this random matrix conjecture, which is proved now by Chauban and Murray, as well as Charles and Benoit, establishes that whenever you take a subalgebra with entropy zero, it has to be amenable. Now, this immediately implies this absorbing amenability property, because if I take something which.
00:26:24.500 - 00:26:27.396, Speaker A: Has diffuse intersection with it, right?
00:26:27.540 - 00:26:41.036, Speaker B: Then if I look at their join that has entropy zero, by this condition, if they're both amenable, and so because of that, their join has to also eventually be zero, has to therefore also be amenable, and then my maximality has.
00:26:41.060 - 00:26:42.744, Speaker A: To be contained in the maximal thing.
00:26:43.644 - 00:27:06.994, Speaker B: So establishing this easily proves the Peterson Tom conjecture and this hard work I mentioned about, like, concentration of measure and local reflexivity. And this con hygrop characterization of amenability goes into sort of this implication.
00:27:08.894 - 00:27:11.794, Speaker C: Okay, great.
00:27:13.414 - 00:27:26.692, Speaker B: Sorry, Dima. Do we go for 50 minutes or 1 hour? Right, but do I have 50 minutes.
00:27:26.708 - 00:27:27.744, Speaker A: Or do I have an hour?
00:27:31.324 - 00:27:32.932, Speaker B: All right, we'll keep it to 50 minutes, then.
00:27:32.988 - 00:27:34.104, Speaker A: Okay, good.
00:27:34.444 - 00:27:45.282, Speaker B: Let's not test people's stomachs. That's a bad, bad strategy. Otherwise, I might be lunch. Okay.
00:27:45.418 - 00:27:46.826, Speaker A: Um, so the.
00:27:46.850 - 00:27:48.690, Speaker B: The first thing that I want want.
00:27:48.722 - 00:27:52.682, Speaker A: To discuss here, uh, is, um, some.
00:27:52.738 - 00:28:06.674, Speaker B: Sort of generalization of this. Uh, so this requires some. Some siest algebra background. So if I have a siesta algebra, let's say unital, because I just don't want to make mistakes.
00:28:06.834 - 00:28:07.654, Speaker A: Um.
00:28:11.454 - 00:28:34.714, Speaker B: And I have two unital representations, okay, of the Cser algebra, then I say that they're disjoint. If the space.
00:28:36.904 - 00:28:41.384, Speaker A: Of bounded linear a.
00:28:41.464 - 00:28:45.232, Speaker B: Modular maps from h one to h two is zero.
00:28:45.328 - 00:28:49.440, Speaker A: So basically, if I take a linear.
00:28:49.472 - 00:28:56.844, Speaker B: Map from h one to h two, which is continuous and a equivariant.
00:28:58.704 - 00:28:59.016, Speaker C: Then.
00:28:59.040 - 00:29:00.124, Speaker A: It has to be zero.
00:29:02.044 - 00:29:02.796, Speaker C: Okay?
00:29:02.940 - 00:29:41.452, Speaker B: So if this is completely, uh, obtuse to you, here's a good exercise. I could take this, you know, I could take continuous functions on some compact house or space, and I could take some nice, say, Borel probability measure on that space, and I could define the multiplication representation. And then these being disjoint for two measures, mu and nu, is the same as the measures being singular. So this is like a non commutative harmonic analysis notion. It's some way of sort of abstracting singularity of measures to just algebras where.
00:29:41.468 - 00:29:42.584, Speaker A: You don't have measures.
00:29:50.524 - 00:29:53.804, Speaker B: Yes, I believe that's equivalent to what I stated.
00:29:54.824 - 00:29:55.604, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:56.144 - 00:30:05.224, Speaker A: So yeah, a linear bounded maps, alinear continuous maps, those are what they call intertwiner.
00:30:05.264 - 00:30:05.904, Speaker B: I think so.
00:30:06.024 - 00:30:06.804, Speaker A: Okay.
00:30:09.704 - 00:30:32.194, Speaker B: And so I'll use this to define, given an inclusion n inside m of subalgebras, I'll use this to define what is now called the anti coarse space. So I look at all vectors in l two of m.
00:30:33.974 - 00:30:40.710, Speaker A: And I take the mm bimodule, which I'll denote l.
00:30:40.742 - 00:30:43.794, Speaker B: Two m psi m generated by xi.
00:30:46.354 - 00:30:48.618, Speaker A: So you just, you know, multiply on.
00:30:48.626 - 00:30:57.378, Speaker B: The left and the right by elements of m, and you take one of your combinations of those and you close that in the two norm, and that's some mm. Bimodule inside l two of m. So.
00:30:57.386 - 00:31:00.694, Speaker A: I'm going to ask that those are.
00:31:02.354 - 00:31:23.714, Speaker B: So that, that bimodule is disjoint from the correspond module. And disjoint in what sense? I have to produce some sea star algebra as say, a representation of the Max tensor product of these two sea star algebras.
00:31:26.254 - 00:31:32.094, Speaker A: Okay, you can actually define this disjointness for just representations of star algebras, but.
00:31:32.134 - 00:32:00.484, Speaker B: Okay, fine. And so, to give a bit of intuition as to how sort of why you would consider this, it's sort of a chain. You have to compose analogies, essentially. So, in sort of the Kahn sort of correspondences picture, you're supposed to think of bimodules over von Neumann algebra as analogous to representations of groups.
00:32:00.784 - 00:32:07.512, Speaker A: Under that analogy. Um, the correspond module corresponds to sort.
00:32:07.528 - 00:32:19.284, Speaker B: Of the left regular representation of the group. If the group were abelian, the left regular representation of the group. Representations of the group correspond to measures on, on the dual. And the left regular representation corresponds to the har measure.
00:32:20.264 - 00:32:20.600, Speaker C: Right?
00:32:20.632 - 00:32:25.764, Speaker B: So this is some sort of singularity with respect to some, you know, non commutative har measure.
00:32:26.264 - 00:32:28.284, Speaker A: And that's why you, you consider it.
00:32:31.814 - 00:32:33.550, Speaker B: And so sort of another thing that's.
00:32:33.582 - 00:32:39.286, Speaker A: That'S important here is that this space.
00:32:39.430 - 00:32:41.074, Speaker B: Contains the normalizer.
00:32:44.534 - 00:32:45.274, Speaker C: But.
00:32:49.654 - 00:32:54.194, Speaker B: Oh, n, yeah, you're right, you're right. Yeah. I want the nn by module. Yeah, you're right.
00:32:56.004 - 00:32:56.332, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:56.348 - 00:32:56.904, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:57.364 - 00:32:58.984, Speaker B: All the m's should be n's.
00:33:04.684 - 00:33:09.084, Speaker A: Yeah, my bad. Thanks. Great.
00:33:09.204 - 00:33:11.428, Speaker B: So, okay, now, now this proposition is true.
00:33:11.596 - 00:33:12.424, Speaker C: Okay?
00:33:13.644 - 00:33:32.480, Speaker B: But it also contains various other things. And so, you know, what happens in von Neumann algebra is in sort of considerations like cohomology theory or sub factor theory, or things like this is lots of other sort of wacky normalizers pop out.
00:33:32.512 - 00:33:33.084, Speaker A: So.
00:33:38.104 - 00:33:57.814, Speaker B: This whacking normalizer is the unitaries in m so that u n U star intersected with n is diffuse. And so now sort of in this picture that we're thinking of just sort of considering things up to sort of having large intersection. I'm now not saying that, you know, this conjugate is equal, but that they.
00:33:58.114 - 00:33:59.534, Speaker A: See a lot of each other.
00:34:01.634 - 00:34:02.026, Speaker C: Okay?
00:34:02.050 - 00:34:24.777, Speaker B: And there's a natural group theoretic analog of this. You know, you consider conjugates of a subgroup whose intersection with the subgroup is infinite. And this one sided quasi normalizer would be the set of x and m, so that there exists x one to xk in m with xm contained in.
00:34:24.785 - 00:34:27.933, Speaker A: The sum of mxj.
00:34:29.673 - 00:34:30.533, Speaker C: Okay?
00:34:32.073 - 00:34:35.973, Speaker A: And so, right.
00:34:37.894 - 00:34:44.674, Speaker B: So the point of this is that, okay, if you had, if you had a genuine normalizer, you could do this with k equals one.
00:34:44.974 - 00:34:49.394, Speaker A: It would just mean that, well, this is n. Sorry, why do I keep doing that?
00:34:50.454 - 00:34:51.270, Speaker C: Great.
00:34:51.462 - 00:35:04.862, Speaker B: It would mean you could do this with k equals one. A normalized would be un is nu, right. But now you allow yourself some, some summation. And so like a different way to say this is that the nn bimodule this generates is, is finally generated as.
00:35:04.878 - 00:35:06.234, Speaker A: A write n module.
00:35:13.174 - 00:35:13.914, Speaker C: What?
00:35:16.214 - 00:35:28.158, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's x and m. So there exists some things in m so that xn. And so this says, for instance, that the nn by module generated by x.
00:35:28.206 - 00:35:32.524, Speaker A: Is finally generated as a left end module.
00:35:33.904 - 00:35:34.764, Speaker C: Okay?
00:35:36.184 - 00:35:46.164, Speaker B: Which is actually some, you know, there's some various ways to think about this. This is kind of, again, if you think of bimodules as analogous to group representations, it's like saying you have a compact representation of a group.
00:35:47.064 - 00:35:48.352, Speaker A: And again, if you did this for.
00:35:48.408 - 00:35:56.738, Speaker B: Inclusions of groups, this would boil down to what's known as the one sided commensurator, which is again, an important thing in geometric group theory.
00:35:56.856 - 00:35:58.274, Speaker A: Okay, let me not get that.
00:35:58.574 - 00:36:00.798, Speaker B: So in the remaining, I guess, 15.
00:36:00.886 - 00:36:04.422, Speaker A: Minutes that I have, I want to.
00:36:04.438 - 00:36:57.746, Speaker B: Again, talk about more applications. And so the sort of, I would say, actually, you know, the significance, I would say, of this paper where I sort of write down the definition of the one bounded entropy is not, to me at least, is not actually the definition. Indeed, it was sort of already implicitly in like three other papers. It's the following theorem, which is that if I amp up, so if I take an inclusion of algebra as n inside m, and I look at some subset of the singular subspace, now in my paper, this can really be any subset, it doesn't have to consist of bounded things. But just to sort of make life easy, let's intersect with the bounded elements. Then the entropy of the algebra that.
00:36:57.770 - 00:37:00.294, Speaker A: Generates is at most the entropy event.
00:37:05.354 - 00:37:13.130, Speaker B: So for instance, you automatically get the result for the normalizer, but you also get it for this WQ normalizer and this one sided quasi normalizer.
00:37:13.242 - 00:37:14.818, Speaker A: And let me sort of more or.
00:37:14.826 - 00:37:16.810, Speaker B: Less promise you any kind of normalizer.
00:37:16.842 - 00:37:18.214, Speaker A: You would actually write down.
00:37:20.094 - 00:37:23.278, Speaker B: And also because of these abstract properties, you can also just immediately do it.
00:37:23.286 - 00:37:24.874, Speaker A: In an ultra power if you want.
00:37:25.254 - 00:37:26.154, Speaker C: Why not?
00:37:27.734 - 00:37:39.542, Speaker B: Okay, and you know, I should mention that for the case of the normalizer where the subalgebra is abelian, this is actually essentially just Wojcielescu's proof of absence.
00:37:39.558 - 00:37:42.558, Speaker A: Of Cartanza algebras is, you know, he.
00:37:42.566 - 00:37:45.902, Speaker B: Didn'T write it in this way, but basically, you know, he more or less.
00:37:45.918 - 00:37:48.720, Speaker A: Just directly used disjointness of two different.
00:37:48.752 - 00:38:13.004, Speaker B: Bimodules to analyze things, but in the special case where one of them is abelian. And so you can actually write down measures in this. And so this led me to the following conjecture in the same paper.
00:38:14.644 - 00:38:17.144, Speaker A: Actually, I really think it was 17.
00:38:18.884 - 00:38:21.624, Speaker C: Which is, if.
00:38:24.804 - 00:38:36.292, Speaker B: I have a diffuse and amenable subalgebra of a free group factor, maturity free group factor, then when.
00:38:36.308 - 00:38:39.244, Speaker A: I look at the ortho complement bi.
00:38:39.284 - 00:39:13.856, Speaker B: Module as an NnBI module, this embeds into an infinite direct sum of the course. And one immediate corollary of that theorem and the this intermediate theorem, that entropy zero means amenable in figure factor. Uh, you get that, if you get.
00:39:13.880 - 00:39:23.240, Speaker A: That this is true, great. Okay, um, let me sort of mention a special case of this.
00:39:23.312 - 00:39:25.560, Speaker B: Uh, you, you could imagine the case.
00:39:25.752 - 00:39:30.600, Speaker A: Where n is abelian, let's call it a, right?
00:39:30.632 - 00:39:34.444, Speaker B: So now we have an abelian subalgebra, which is also maximal amenable.
00:39:35.494 - 00:39:37.670, Speaker A: And then what I can do is.
00:39:37.702 - 00:39:40.274, Speaker B: I can say that a is, say.
00:39:40.974 - 00:39:48.046, Speaker A: Some l infinity of x mu, and I can consider the representation I get.
00:39:48.070 - 00:39:58.514, Speaker B: Of c of x times x on bounded operators of l two of m intersect l two of a orthogonal complement. I get by again just sort of.
00:39:58.934 - 00:40:01.364, Speaker A: Left and right multiplying.
00:40:06.384 - 00:40:07.816, Speaker B: So here I'm just literally thinking that.
00:40:07.840 - 00:40:09.684, Speaker A: A is is l infinity of x.
00:40:10.984 - 00:40:34.568, Speaker B: And while this is a representation of some, you know, continuous functions on some compact house or space, so it corresponds to some measure, right? That's what we learn in the spectral theorem. So this gives us a measure on x times x. And the rephrasing of this conjecture is that this measure is always absolutely continuous.
00:40:34.616 - 00:40:39.160, Speaker A: With respect to the product measure. Okay, so in the case of abelian.
00:40:39.192 - 00:40:54.712, Speaker B: Things, this analogy with singularity is not purely an analogy. It has an actual explicit corollary. And this was done by sort of previous work in this direction. It's basically folklore. For the generator Masa, we can probably.
00:40:54.768 - 00:40:59.242, Speaker A: Just attribute that to voikulescu, but sort.
00:40:59.258 - 00:41:05.534, Speaker B: Of some work in this direction was done by Dykama and Mercury 2012.
00:41:05.874 - 00:41:10.574, Speaker A: Radulescu, I think, had this for the laplacian masa.
00:41:11.194 - 00:41:13.922, Speaker B: It is sort of strongly used in.
00:41:13.938 - 00:41:24.782, Speaker A: The paper of Dima and Cyril in 2011, and also in one of these.
00:41:24.878 - 00:41:26.554, Speaker B: Other papers I mentioned before.
00:41:28.094 - 00:41:28.954, Speaker C: Okay.
00:41:33.014 - 00:41:33.790, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, sorry.
00:41:33.822 - 00:41:34.878, Speaker B: Diffuse and maximum mean.
00:41:34.926 - 00:41:35.550, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks.
00:41:35.622 - 00:41:39.470, Speaker B: Yeah. Otherwise it's not true. Otherwise it's definitely not true.
00:41:39.502 - 00:41:42.314, Speaker A: Yeah, great.
00:41:44.294 - 00:41:45.114, Speaker C: Okay.
00:41:45.534 - 00:42:06.196, Speaker B: And of course, you know, if you're, if you're fun and wacky, which we like to be, sometimes we have fun sometimes, then you can do this. You know, you can do this in an ultra power with no problem. Why be serious when you can be fun?
00:42:06.340 - 00:42:07.024, Speaker C: Ah.
00:42:11.324 - 00:42:14.064, Speaker B: I choose an item, potent ultra filter. So it's fun.
00:42:16.114 - 00:42:17.094, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:42:17.474 - 00:42:19.374, Speaker B: You know, I could take.
00:42:23.954 - 00:42:24.674, Speaker A: Some finite.
00:42:24.714 - 00:42:30.974, Speaker B: List of things where QJ is. Say we say q one is diffuse.
00:42:32.594 - 00:42:37.694, Speaker A: And amenable, and each qj plus one.
00:42:38.114 - 00:42:53.154, Speaker B: Is generated by qj and some xj, where xj is inside the singular subspace of Qj, inside qj plus one, joyously, inside M inside M omega.
00:42:56.094 - 00:42:58.622, Speaker A: And okay, as written, k is a.
00:42:58.638 - 00:42:59.622, Speaker B: Finite number, but it could be an.
00:42:59.638 - 00:43:02.234, Speaker A: Ordinal, if you know what that means.
00:43:04.534 - 00:43:21.374, Speaker B: Then whenever I intersect this with the diagonal copy of m, this is always immutable. So, for instance, it implies this gamma stability that, like, if you have a diffuse subalgebra of a free group factor, whose central sequences inside the free group factor are diffuse, then actually that subalgebra is amenable, et cetera.
00:43:25.114 - 00:43:34.806, Speaker A: Great. We also get. So if I did this without the.
00:43:34.830 - 00:44:05.726, Speaker B: Omega, uh, this is by itself already a generalization of strong solidity. So let's call it, let's call it mega solidity. So, generalization of the strong solidity theorem with the omega, it's, it's, it's ultrasound. Without the omega, it's just, you know, I can do all sorts of weird normalizers. And, you know, so what Ozawa and Pobo proved is that if you take an amenable thing and you take the von Eumann algebra generated by its normalizer.
00:44:05.750 - 00:44:08.422, Speaker A: Then it stays amenable. But now I can do this with.
00:44:08.438 - 00:44:12.510, Speaker B: All these other wacky normalizers. So it's mega solidity, but I can.
00:44:12.542 - 00:44:14.774, Speaker A: Do it in m omega.
00:44:14.814 - 00:44:16.594, Speaker B: So this is omega mega solidity.
00:44:17.614 - 00:44:18.474, Speaker C: Okay.
00:44:21.334 - 00:44:22.942, Speaker A: I told you we would have fun.
00:44:23.118 - 00:44:23.954, Speaker C: Okay.
00:44:28.594 - 00:44:29.534, Speaker A: Let'S see.
00:44:36.714 - 00:44:39.494, Speaker B: Does that include five minutes with questions or.
00:44:40.634 - 00:44:41.434, Speaker C: Okay.
00:44:41.594 - 00:45:07.104, Speaker B: All right, I want to mention just one last application. Again, there's lots you can actually do with this. We're already sort of starting other projects where we have lots of applications. SRI has a nice paper with Greg Pachel that talks about sequential commutation of unitaries inside an ultra power. And he gets lots of nice applications for frequent factors from this.
00:45:11.004 - 00:45:13.428, Speaker A: I think this is maybe going to.
00:45:13.436 - 00:45:23.324, Speaker B: Be hit a sort of small subset of the audience. But I do want to say something about the relevance of this for this deformation rigidity program.
00:45:24.024 - 00:45:27.680, Speaker A: So I'll say that q intertwines into.
00:45:27.712 - 00:45:29.984, Speaker B: P if I have sub algebra of.
00:45:30.024 - 00:45:34.656, Speaker A: M. If there's sort of projections in.
00:45:34.680 - 00:45:42.204, Speaker B: Q, projections in p, and a unital.
00:45:44.304 - 00:45:47.784, Speaker A: Homomorphism from these corners.
00:45:49.564 - 00:45:50.484, Speaker B: And some v.
00:45:50.564 - 00:45:56.724, Speaker A: In m, so that xv is v.
00:45:56.764 - 00:46:35.620, Speaker B: Theta x for all x and fqf, vv is an FQF prime intersect fmf and v is in theta f q f prime intersect e and e. And I guess this should be a partial isometry. Admittedly, this is sort of bit to parse if, you know, this is your first time seeing it, or even if not your first time seeing it, and you just don't work with this that often. But you should sort of imagine the situation where f and e, this would be not zero. You should imagine the situation where these.
00:46:35.652 - 00:46:40.404, Speaker A: Non zero projections are just one and that v is a unitary.
00:46:41.464 - 00:47:02.284, Speaker B: In which case you're saying that basically these subalgebras are unitarily conjugate. But this notion is slightly more flexible. You can not just have, you know, unitary conjugacy, you can take sort of corners of things and have those be unitarily conjugate, etcetera. And in fact, often the way you get that things are unitarily conjugate is to start from this and then sort of start patching things together.
00:47:05.684 - 00:47:09.340, Speaker A: Uh, and so what we get from.
00:47:09.372 - 00:47:55.624, Speaker B: This is this dichotomy for maximal amenable sub algebras of free group factors, which is that if I take two subalgebras of a free group factor which are maximal amenable, then exactly one of the following occurs. So it's a strict dichotomy.
00:47:56.674 - 00:48:03.854, Speaker A: Either there are non zero projections in.
00:48:06.714 - 00:48:08.014, Speaker B: P and q.
00:48:09.714 - 00:48:14.374, Speaker A: And some unitary in m. M is my free group factor.
00:48:17.594 - 00:48:20.634, Speaker B: So that these corners are conjugate.
00:48:20.714 - 00:48:23.904, Speaker A: So either they have unitarily conjugate corners.
00:48:25.364 - 00:48:26.104, Speaker C: Or.
00:48:29.924 - 00:48:35.624, Speaker A: For every diffuse subalgebra of q.
00:48:39.164 - 00:48:42.704, Speaker B: I cannot intertwine it into p.
00:48:44.524 - 00:48:44.860, Speaker C: So.
00:48:44.892 - 00:48:59.470, Speaker B: Either they don't see each other at all. Right, anytime I take any sort of large piece of it, I can't move it into the other whatsoever, or in fact up to cutting by corners they're actually unitary conjugate. For instance, if q and p are sub factors, the first item automatically implies.
00:48:59.502 - 00:49:00.834, Speaker A: That they are conjugate.
00:49:02.014 - 00:49:24.936, Speaker B: If they're not sub factors then we sort of investigate this analysis more. So I guess in short, you might wonder whether the resolution of the Peterson Tom conjecture solves the problem but is otherwise useless. Maybe it doesn't get you closer to solving the frequent factor problem or something, but as we've shown, and as is.
00:49:24.960 - 00:49:28.824, Speaker A: Sort of further work we're developing, that's not the case.
00:49:28.864 - 00:49:37.744, Speaker B: We get lots of interesting applications to the structure of free group factors beyond just solving the Peterson tom conjecture. So I'll stop here so that you can eat.
