00:00:07.680 - 00:00:31.294, Speaker A: Hello everybody. Let's continue the next section of chapter four, which was about kernels created by either polynomials or power series with positive coefficients. So either either we have p of.
00:00:31.334 - 00:00:31.914, Speaker B: Z.
00:00:34.054 - 00:00:36.554, Speaker A: P of z equals to sum.
00:00:37.894 - 00:00:41.166, Speaker B: N from zero up to n a.
00:00:41.230 - 00:01:19.304, Speaker A: N z n in which an are positive bigger than or equal to zero, in which case there is, there is no convergence problem. And we can create kp, the kernel created by p. We can discuss it on the complex plane, or I mean, a little bit later we'll see. We can go even further. So, kp from c times c to c was defined by.
00:01:27.884 - 00:01:35.944, Speaker B: Zero to infinity. And here zw bar exponent.
00:01:36.484 - 00:01:50.152, Speaker A: We showed that this is positive. We even talked about h of kp and discussed about its elements. The next step was to consider power series.
00:01:50.328 - 00:01:53.376, Speaker B: So instead of a polynomial p of.
00:01:53.400 - 00:02:02.392, Speaker A: Z is sum n from zero to infinity. Here a n z n, or a.
00:02:02.408 - 00:02:06.604, Speaker B: N x n doesn't matter what is the variable here.
00:02:07.104 - 00:02:12.564, Speaker A: And we assume that the radius of convergence here is r. Two.
00:02:20.424 - 00:02:23.764, Speaker B: Radius of convergence.
00:02:24.224 - 00:02:38.496, Speaker A: And the reason is that we can define now, yes, we can define kp as before on z w and from.
00:02:38.560 - 00:02:43.782, Speaker B: Zero to infinity infinity anzw bar exponent.
00:02:43.838 - 00:02:47.270, Speaker A: N. And this is defined on z.
00:02:47.342 - 00:02:52.654, Speaker B: W belongs to discard radius r times.
00:02:52.734 - 00:03:09.690, Speaker A: Discard radius r. That is why we put two reals up there to have doctor here. And we also talked about the elements of h of kp. In this case, they are analytic functions.
00:03:09.762 - 00:03:11.294, Speaker B: On, on the disk.
00:03:11.594 - 00:03:21.586, Speaker A: And if n of z equal to root a n, z n are in hp.
00:03:21.650 - 00:03:24.762, Speaker B: Of course, even hkp.
00:03:24.898 - 00:03:43.586, Speaker A: Of course, even if a n is zero, they are there. But it doesn't give us any information. If an is not zero, then these are norm of norm one and orthogonal to each other.
00:03:43.770 - 00:03:48.894, Speaker B: So this set is an orthogonal set.
00:03:52.554 - 00:04:09.656, Speaker A: In our space. We can, we can go more, and I mean explore more properties of this, but instead, let's assure you that you have seen examples of this before, and important examples.
00:04:09.720 - 00:04:10.160, Speaker B: Indeed.
00:04:10.232 - 00:04:19.096, Speaker A: Without looking at the problem from this angle, we looked from a different point of view. But let's remember those examples.
00:04:19.200 - 00:04:20.084, Speaker B: Example.
00:04:21.144 - 00:04:24.764, Speaker A: First example, we consider the power series.
00:04:28.064 - 00:04:31.416, Speaker B: Z equal to some n from zero.
00:04:31.480 - 00:04:35.536, Speaker A: To infinity, just z. All a n are equal to one.
00:04:35.600 - 00:04:38.564, Speaker B: Or if you wish, one over one minus z.
00:04:39.184 - 00:05:05.970, Speaker A: This case r is equal to one. And indeed we have two interesting cases. Or we can change everything into two cases. Either r is finite, where we can normalize it such that r is equal to one, and talk about functions on the open unit disk, or r is infinity, in which case we talk about.
00:05:06.042 - 00:05:10.334, Speaker B: Functions on the whole complex plane. So both those happen.
00:05:10.794 - 00:05:14.994, Speaker A: In this case, you have this. And what is our kernel?
00:05:15.154 - 00:05:17.290, Speaker B: I mean, we have seen this kernel before.
00:05:17.362 - 00:05:18.334, Speaker A: In this case.
00:05:21.534 - 00:05:32.606, Speaker B: Kp z w is just one or one minus z w bar. We saw this before under the name.
00:05:32.630 - 00:05:44.454, Speaker A: Of Cauchy kernel, sometimes called also Gigo kernel and h of kp. This is precisely what we had before.
00:05:44.534 - 00:05:50.814, Speaker B: Under the domain h two, the hardy space with p equal to two.
00:05:51.954 - 00:05:57.974, Speaker A: So, either you start from the kernel and you end up with this space, or vice versa.
00:05:59.354 - 00:06:10.254, Speaker B: Another example, example two is p of z, so n from zero to infinity.
00:06:11.554 - 00:06:13.618, Speaker A: Not one n plus one.
00:06:13.666 - 00:06:25.304, Speaker B: Here, n plus one, one zn, which is one over one minus z.
00:06:28.084 - 00:06:28.660, Speaker A: No.
00:06:28.772 - 00:06:31.344, Speaker B: So let me write it correctly.
00:06:33.644 - 00:06:40.944, Speaker A: Yes, that's true. If we take an, it becomes this one, and in this case h of kp.
00:06:44.464 - 00:06:54.804, Speaker B: If kp z w is one over one minus z w r squared.
00:06:55.144 - 00:07:07.600, Speaker A: And h of kp in this case is precisely what we called a two, a two of the Bergman space. And in some books, as I said.
00:07:07.712 - 00:07:30.754, Speaker B: They call it also b two of the annotation. It depends on the taste, on the author. So it's Bergman space and the development is hardy space.
00:07:32.414 - 00:07:58.484, Speaker A: Both cases are on the open unit disk. Another one which we did not discuss at the very beginning, but in indeed several talks in the focus program, they talked about it. It's case a n equal to one.
00:07:58.524 - 00:08:05.884, Speaker B: Over n factorial zn, or e to the z.
00:08:07.464 - 00:08:13.504, Speaker A: And in this case, we obtain a.
00:08:13.544 - 00:08:24.684, Speaker B: Space with k of bzw is zw bar.
00:08:27.764 - 00:08:46.184, Speaker A: And in this case r is equal to infinity. The functions are defined on the whole complex plane, and we obtain a space which is very important in sampling and interpolation. It's called Sigel Bergman space.
00:08:46.844 - 00:09:03.244, Speaker B: So, Markman space.
00:09:05.744 - 00:09:09.584, Speaker A: I mean, I stay with our annotation hkp.
00:09:09.664 - 00:09:12.952, Speaker B: But for Sigel Bergman, there are, I.
00:09:12.968 - 00:09:26.652, Speaker A: Mean, I didn't introduce in chapter one, when we discussed about several examples, but that's indeed a good example to add at the very beginning, by introducing, by.
00:09:26.748 - 00:09:31.236, Speaker B: I mean, some integrals to define its norm.
00:09:31.380 - 00:09:35.980, Speaker A: But I mean, in chapter four, we arrive at the same space from a.
00:09:36.012 - 00:09:45.924, Speaker B: Different route by considering coefficients. So here, one over n factorial, previous.
00:09:46.044 - 00:09:51.360, Speaker A: One, n plus one, and the first one is one here.
00:09:51.392 - 00:09:56.164, Speaker B: Indeed that. Well, yes, I can add one if you wish.
00:09:57.104 - 00:10:12.600, Speaker A: So, the good thing about this approach is its simplicity. Anything positive, any an positive gives you a kernel, and based on that kernel.
00:10:12.672 - 00:10:16.004, Speaker B: You can construct your space.
00:10:20.834 - 00:10:26.818, Speaker A: Now we generalize this construction a little bit more.
00:10:26.866 - 00:10:31.414, Speaker B: Now, our series on balls.
00:10:40.394 - 00:11:37.654, Speaker A: In. In the previous setting. Our setting was either the complex plane when we considered polynomials, and when we go to series, because of the convergence, we sometimes we had to consider something smaller. So it's, it was a disk, sometimes a disc radius one, or a disco radius r. How can we generalize this? In this general setting, I consider x to be Hilbert space L. So, and it works for, again for the polynomial case. And sometimes when we go further and consider series, it doesn't work on the, on l, we have to consider something small, smaller.
00:11:37.654 - 00:12:16.172, Speaker A: And that is why we talk about balls. So, balls in R. In L. Sorry. So it's a generalization of the previous step in which we just consider that C. And. Doctor, now we go for L and prime here is, I mean, by this proposition, which is not difficult to prove, we can generalize the previous proposition.
00:12:16.172 - 00:12:32.304, Speaker A: Previous, I mean from last week here on that the, I'm sorry. On C, the inner product is z.
00:12:32.424 - 00:12:37.724, Speaker B: Times w bar, just z w bar.
00:12:38.144 - 00:13:16.340, Speaker A: And when we have a nzn, we have the combination anzw bar n, which is well defined in Hilbert's. The inner product is z w in l. And we can do the same, I mean, it's a complex number, we can do exponent n and multiply by a n. And if you have a polynomial with positive coefficients. So if p of z or p.
00:13:16.372 - 00:13:25.152, Speaker B: Of x is given n from zero up to Nanzn, the only restriction is.
00:13:25.168 - 00:13:26.604, Speaker A: That these are positive.
00:13:27.264 - 00:13:43.554, Speaker B: Well, we can, we can define k z w to be n from zero up to. Nice.
00:13:45.204 - 00:13:51.644, Speaker A: A n inner product of z w exponent n, where here z and w.
00:13:51.764 - 00:13:55.344, Speaker B: Are elements of a Hilbert space f.
00:13:57.204 - 00:14:29.226, Speaker A: Well defined. We want to prove this is positive, but it's kind of trivial, because we saw before that the mapping, it sends the pair zw to the inner product of zw. This is positive. It gives us the gramion matrix, and the gramion is positive.
00:14:29.290 - 00:14:30.534, Speaker B: We saw this before.
00:14:31.074 - 00:15:10.564, Speaker A: And then the short product comes. If you have two positive matrices and you multiply them by short product or component wise product, what you obtain is also positive. So as soon as we see that this mapping is positive, we immediately conclude that z w exponent two exponent three exponent k, any k is positive. And then we multiply by positive coefficients and add them up. So immediately we get the sum, or kp.
00:15:13.184 - 00:15:14.336, Speaker B: Is positive.
00:15:14.520 - 00:15:43.756, Speaker A: Nothing new in it, except that when we compare with the previous case, the reasoning is the same. The difference is that we replaced c, which is a Hilbert space, by an arbitrary Hilbert space. So on an arbitrary Hilbert space, we can define kp by this formula, which is something positive, appealing to more theorem.
00:15:43.900 - 00:15:49.236, Speaker B: So we can talk about h of kp.
00:15:49.420 - 00:16:12.518, Speaker A: So this rkhs exists, and what can we say about its element? So the next proposition, most of them we know what happened. Do you see my screen?
00:16:12.566 - 00:16:13.834, Speaker B: I don't see myself.
00:16:22.774 - 00:16:24.974, Speaker A: Okay, you should see it now.
00:16:27.514 - 00:16:29.498, Speaker B: Looks good. I can see this. Yeah.
00:16:29.666 - 00:16:53.462, Speaker A: Yes. So this proposition, we know most of it, but there is one ingredient in it, which is probably new. L Hilbert space n is a positive.
00:16:53.598 - 00:16:56.314, Speaker B: Integer bigger than or equal to one.
00:17:02.814 - 00:17:11.834, Speaker A: And kn defined on l times l.
00:17:12.294 - 00:17:27.305, Speaker B: With values in complex number by the formula we saw before, kn z m w is z w exponent n. In.
00:17:27.329 - 00:17:29.745, Speaker A: Other words, we just consider the monomial.
00:17:29.849 - 00:17:35.013, Speaker B: X to the power n. These are our assumption. Then.
00:17:42.134 - 00:17:55.634, Speaker A: Rkhs created by this contains, that's the purpose of this proposition contains all functions.
00:18:00.814 - 00:18:08.744, Speaker B: G from l to c that.
00:18:12.644 - 00:18:14.064, Speaker A: Can be written.
00:18:17.044 - 00:18:17.784, Speaker B: As.
00:18:21.404 - 00:18:23.024, Speaker A: A linear combination.
00:18:29.684 - 00:18:30.424, Speaker B: Of.
00:18:33.384 - 00:18:38.244, Speaker A: Products of n.
00:18:39.984 - 00:18:41.164, Speaker B: Functionals.
00:18:42.904 - 00:18:49.280, Speaker A: Of course, when we talk functionals, we, when everything is bounded, maybe, maybe I.
00:18:49.312 - 00:18:51.204, Speaker B: Add here bounded functionals.
00:18:55.944 - 00:19:28.078, Speaker A: So any, you consider the dual space. So you have, you have l this way. So you have, it's dual, two. So, dual consists of elements. F is in L star. So f is defined on L with values in C. You consider any n.
00:19:28.166 - 00:19:33.634, Speaker B: Of this f one, f two f.
00:19:35.534 - 00:19:37.806, Speaker A: You multiply them together so they are.
00:19:37.830 - 00:19:43.742, Speaker B: Arbitrary f one, f two up to fn.
00:19:43.838 - 00:20:12.470, Speaker A: That's a function, call it f. This is in h of k. And of course, I mean, I talked about linear combination, because if, if a combination like this is in hkn and you form another combination, then the sum with bitoric coefficient is also is in this space. So the important part is this one, why you multiply n functionals is in.
00:20:12.582 - 00:20:14.674, Speaker B: This space to prove.
00:20:20.714 - 00:21:27.958, Speaker A: Well, what are these f one and f two. Remember, fist theorem says that if f is in dual, then there is, and indeed it's unique. But uniqueness is not immediate. Here there is a unique w in such that f at each point z is the inner product of z and w. And sometimes we denote this by fw of z. So it's a conjugate linear isomorphism between l and l star in this way. So it is enough to show that if omega one up to omega n in L are given, then f omega one, f omega two up to f omega n.
00:21:27.958 - 00:21:30.550, Speaker A: We multiply them together using.
00:21:30.662 - 00:21:35.394, Speaker B: H of k. This is our goal. We want to show this.
00:21:40.074 - 00:21:57.738, Speaker A: How do we do that? This is again another occasion. We have used theorem 3.11 several times, but that's another point that use it. It gives us a criteria, indeed two.
00:21:57.786 - 00:21:58.694, Speaker B: Criteria.
00:22:00.434 - 00:22:04.186, Speaker A: To see when a function given is in this space.
00:22:04.370 - 00:22:09.124, Speaker B: So, in primetime, call Nicole.
00:22:11.144 - 00:22:17.288, Speaker A: Very important result. F is in H if and only.
00:22:17.376 - 00:22:20.336, Speaker B: If there is a constant c such.
00:22:20.400 - 00:22:21.004, Speaker A: That.
00:22:23.064 - 00:22:32.084, Speaker B: F of x, f of y is less than or equal to c or c two k, x and y.
00:22:34.034 - 00:23:09.504, Speaker A: And even we had some more explanation about the minimum C that we can put there. But now this is enough for us. And this is one thing that we used before, but we use it again here. Another fact is that if you have zero less than or equal to, say, matrices a one less than two, and also.
00:23:13.204 - 00:23:16.420, Speaker B: Matrices b, one less than b two.
00:23:16.452 - 00:23:31.336, Speaker A: But this is in the relation partial relation that we defined before. A one less than a two means that the difference is a positive matrix a two minus a one is positive.
00:23:31.400 - 00:23:35.616, Speaker B: The same, the same for b one less than or equal to b two.
00:23:35.680 - 00:23:36.804, Speaker A: This implies.
00:23:38.504 - 00:23:50.324, Speaker B: That zero is less than or equal to a one b one. That's the short product, less than or equal to a two.
00:23:58.194 - 00:24:01.394, Speaker A: It's very easy to prove, and I.
00:24:01.434 - 00:24:04.374, Speaker B: Leave it as an exercise for the students.
00:24:06.314 - 00:24:11.334, Speaker A: Of course, the main ingredient of the proof is.
00:24:11.754 - 00:24:14.574, Speaker B: So I give you a hint.
00:24:15.634 - 00:24:24.904, Speaker A: The main ingredient of the proof proof is short theorem, which says that if s is positive and t is positive.
00:24:25.324 - 00:24:36.144, Speaker B: Then so t is positive. And you can use this to prove this inequality.
00:24:40.644 - 00:25:11.950, Speaker A: So why? Why do we need this? Because we know this is a special case that we studied before, we saw before. And so it was one of the proposition that I proved that f one is in h of k one, k one means capital n is equal to one.
00:25:11.982 - 00:25:14.114, Speaker B: And here, when we go back.
00:25:17.654 - 00:25:35.714, Speaker A: It'S a very special case, but important. When we studied before here, n equal to one, just k z, and w is the inner product of z and w. We saw that this is positive, and also each functional is there.
00:25:39.914 - 00:25:41.854, Speaker B: So we saw this before.
00:25:42.194 - 00:26:09.844, Speaker A: And the same for the same for f two, the same for fn, using h of k n. And so it's time to use our theorem, the theorem I mentioned here as a recall. If a function is in the space, there is a constant such that this works. So there is a constant c one.
00:26:10.544 - 00:26:19.564, Speaker B: Such that f one x f one y bar less than or equal.
00:26:23.304 - 00:26:23.760, Speaker A: C.
00:26:23.832 - 00:26:32.546, Speaker B: One k, which is k one. We can write kick x and y.
00:26:32.610 - 00:26:35.134, Speaker A: The same for f two and the same.
00:26:36.874 - 00:26:37.614, Speaker B: For.
00:26:40.234 - 00:26:41.214, Speaker A: Fn.
00:26:42.274 - 00:26:56.254, Speaker B: And of course, this is part of the fny, r is less than or equal to cn, kx and y.
00:27:00.934 - 00:28:03.104, Speaker A: And these inequalities means that if you remove this to the other side, you obtain a function of x, and y is a kernel function. It means for all matrices one by one, two by two, three by three, all sizes. When you form the graph, the gramion at any connection of endpoint, it's positive. It's a kind of huge restriction which is hidden in this little inequality here. But knowing this, now it's time to to apply the park's formula here. If a one is less than or equal to a two, all of them positive, the same for b one and p two, then you can do the Schuberth product and do the sure product to this, to the second one, and up to the last one.
00:28:08.164 - 00:28:14.424, Speaker B: If you do the sure product, you immediately see that by exercise.
00:28:16.424 - 00:28:17.048, Speaker A: We have.
00:28:17.096 - 00:28:19.124, Speaker B: Zero less than or equal to.
00:28:21.144 - 00:28:52.514, Speaker A: Component by component. So f one x f two x fnx, which I called f of x, and then f one y f two y f n y. This is f of y bar less than or equal to c one c two c. And I think about I wrote c one squared. So let's keep the same notation. It really doesn't matter. But when we talk about the optimal value, it is important.
00:28:52.514 - 00:28:55.894, Speaker A: So here we have c squared, where.
00:28:55.974 - 00:28:59.518, Speaker B: C is c one, c two times.
00:28:59.606 - 00:29:05.518, Speaker A: Cn and k xy times k xy.
00:29:05.606 - 00:29:07.754, Speaker B: Times x, k y n times.
00:29:09.514 - 00:30:22.218, Speaker A: So we obtain this. Still in the language of kernel functions, this is less than or equal to this one more time. But that famous theorem, by the theorem 3.11, we conclude that f is in the space h created by Kree, and also something about its norm, which is controlled by c. But I don't need that here. What I needed, I just wanted to show that if you multiply n functionals, you obtain an element of hkn spatial case when your l is cm. In this case, two elements of l z is equal to z one z two up to zm and w w.
00:30:22.346 - 00:30:24.666, Speaker B: One w two up to the value.
00:30:24.770 - 00:30:51.376, Speaker A: M. It's okay to write it this way, but if you want to remove the bars later on, you can put the bar here and fw f index w at point z was the inner product of z and w. In cn it's just w one times z one.
00:30:51.440 - 00:30:57.404, Speaker B: Plus w two z two plus wm.
00:30:58.224 - 00:31:03.184, Speaker A: Z m. It's a polynomial homage of.
00:31:03.224 - 00:31:04.244, Speaker B: Degree one.
00:31:06.024 - 00:32:17.544, Speaker A: True, and therefore k n z and w when you form the multiple of this would be w one z one up to wnzn to the power n. And now what does the proposition tells us? What are the elements, some of the elements of h kn. It says that consider n bounded functional on cm you do not consider here all the functionals. I just consider some of them. But then, thanks to the linear combination, we will see that we obtain at the end all the elements we are looking for. Just consider these elements Fei. Ei is the canonical basis.
00:32:17.544 - 00:32:21.556, Speaker A: So Fei evaluated at z is just.
00:32:21.620 - 00:32:32.464, Speaker B: Zi ei is zero zero one. And this is just the ice place.
00:32:35.084 - 00:32:41.904, Speaker A: So just fei. And then you can see the n of this.
00:32:42.644 - 00:32:51.544, Speaker B: So f is equal to f e I one f e I two.
00:32:52.724 - 00:33:45.564, Speaker A: Fein repetition is of course allowed. In the theorem, we didn't say that f one, f two, f are distinct. No, it can be repeated. And when you evaluate f at the point z, you see that it's of this form, z one to some power, z two to some power, and the power is the number of times that e two is repeated here up to zm to another power with the restriction, of course, how many times n times.
00:33:46.264 - 00:33:54.232, Speaker B: With the restriction that j one plus j two plus jm is equal to.
00:33:54.288 - 00:34:26.410, Speaker A: N. That is because theorem tells us that multiply n of them together. And therefore we see that this is a monomial of degree n. And when we consider all combinations, we see that polynomial degree precisely equal to n belongs.
00:34:26.442 - 00:34:29.674, Speaker B: To h of k. In this case.
00:34:29.834 - 00:34:52.864, Speaker A: This special case, this is a finite dimensional case. We can go further and do a bit of work to show that there is no more. These are all of them. And now we go one further, uh, one step. Furthermore, as before, we can see the power series.
00:34:57.004 - 00:35:12.984, Speaker B: So p of x sum and from zero to infinity an extent.
00:35:13.384 - 00:35:18.512, Speaker A: An positive and radius of convergence.
00:35:18.568 - 00:35:21.924, Speaker B: As before, two reals strictly bigger than.
00:35:22.224 - 00:35:31.344, Speaker A: Zero r can be plus infinity too, but it can be finite. And as I said before, usually we.
00:35:31.384 - 00:35:33.840, Speaker B: Normalize it such that either r is.
00:35:33.872 - 00:35:37.728, Speaker A: Equal to one or r is equal to plus infinity.
00:35:37.776 - 00:35:40.544, Speaker B: It can be transformed to these two.
00:35:40.844 - 00:35:55.492, Speaker A: Cases and kp that we consider here in this ball. Not that in previous case, something that I should have highlighted, I highlighted at.
00:35:55.508 - 00:36:14.204, Speaker B: The very beginning of the talk today. This is the special case. Where is the t?
00:36:16.704 - 00:36:42.914, Speaker A: Here it is here. As you see, x is equal to l, the whole space. When we have a cover series like this, we cannot do that. In this case, Kp, which is defined to be the sum in from zero to infinity an.
00:36:43.614 - 00:36:49.154, Speaker B: Well, I should have add two points z and w is z.
00:36:51.734 - 00:37:23.438, Speaker A: In L exponent L. Our x is a ball of radius r inside L, because otherwise, otherwise Kp is not well defined. The series is not convergent. Br is considered to ensure that this series is convergent. That is why our set x is.
00:37:23.486 - 00:37:27.264, Speaker B: Different in this case. So this we need to keep in mind.
00:37:27.804 - 00:37:30.900, Speaker A: So as before we can, it's easy.
00:37:30.932 - 00:37:33.892, Speaker B: To see, we have seen this several times before.
00:37:33.988 - 00:37:43.132, Speaker A: KP bigger than or equal to zero. And what are the elements? Now it's easy for us to see.
00:37:43.228 - 00:37:44.012, Speaker B: What are the elements.
00:37:44.068 - 00:38:34.648, Speaker A: It depends if an is zero or not zero. If it's zero, then it kills, it kills this part, and we cannot say anything about it. But if it is not zero, then we see that we have, I mean, the term zw exponent n a n, I mean, is v form it leaves there it's not, not that, and it's less than or equal to our kpz w. So all elements which are in this space are in this space too. Or it's better to say all elements which are created by this kernel are.
00:38:34.696 - 00:38:37.360, Speaker B: In the space created by this space.
00:38:37.432 - 00:39:00.298, Speaker A: Too, because of the product that we saw before. And therefore previous preposition tells us that the elements of this are polynomials of degree precisely equal to the n. So this one would have all polynomials of degree n, provided that a n is.
00:39:00.346 - 00:39:01.894, Speaker B: Not equal to zero.
00:39:03.714 - 00:39:28.300, Speaker A: So we can say, I mean, I write the theorem as this, I mean the hypothesis, you know what it is? I mean, it's asked before as, as, as in proposition. And we assume the convergence. The important part is here for each n such that a n is not.
00:39:28.372 - 00:39:39.784, Speaker B: Zero strictly bigger than zero h of kp contains. So we distinguish.
00:39:41.624 - 00:39:44.564, Speaker A: Some elements, every function.
00:39:48.904 - 00:39:49.884, Speaker B: On Br.
00:39:52.904 - 00:39:54.444, Speaker A: That can be written.
00:40:01.904 - 00:40:02.644, Speaker B: As.
00:40:04.784 - 00:40:06.048, Speaker A: Linear combination.
00:40:06.176 - 00:40:09.720, Speaker B: Again, this is, this part is trivial linear combination.
00:40:09.872 - 00:40:24.204, Speaker A: It's a special, the part which is non trivial and it's based on the previous proposition, is this part combination of what? Of n product products.
00:40:25.944 - 00:40:36.324, Speaker B: Of n bounded linear functions, which we call them polynomial.
00:40:38.054 - 00:41:16.474, Speaker A: On c. So any product of n bounded linear functional, and then you sum them up with different coefficients, but restrict them to the ball to avoid any divergence problems. Then this is an element of our space. So it's a direct generalization of the.
00:41:16.514 - 00:41:20.374, Speaker B: Case that we saw before for c.
00:41:20.674 - 00:41:29.854, Speaker A: We can go a little bit further, consider on Cm, and even still go a little bit further, and consider on an arbitrary.
00:41:32.114 - 00:41:33.494, Speaker B: Hilbert space.
00:41:37.474 - 00:41:53.098, Speaker A: For the most general case that we consider here, an example which is very important, and it's indeed the topic of this week of the focus program. Again, consider p of x is equal.
00:41:53.146 - 00:42:00.390, Speaker B: To one over one minus x n from zero to infinity x n. In.
00:42:00.422 - 00:42:02.702, Speaker A: This case, am is equal to one.
00:42:02.758 - 00:42:05.034, Speaker B: For n bigger than or equal to zero.
00:42:05.574 - 00:42:17.154, Speaker A: So it satisfies the condition of the theorem and the radius of convergence is equal to one. So kp.
00:42:18.894 - 00:42:22.454, Speaker B: Of z w is simply.
00:42:25.034 - 00:42:29.346, Speaker A: Z inner product w exponent n, or.
00:42:29.530 - 00:42:33.094, Speaker B: One over one minus z w.
00:42:37.234 - 00:42:57.620, Speaker A: If we hadn't talked for two, three weeks about this topic, and somebody comes and tells you, okay, I defined k by this formula, then show, even show. Just show. Just show that Kp is bigger than.
00:42:57.652 - 00:42:58.828, Speaker B: Or equal to zero.
00:42:58.956 - 00:43:32.692, Speaker A: It's not that easy. I invite you to try. Just forget about what we have discussed up to now and directly proceed and show that one over one minus z inner product w is positive. Just this. We did a lot. We did short theorem and then we consider polynomial. We have the TRm 3.11
00:43:32.692 - 00:43:42.374, Speaker A: for the membership inclusion and then series. And finally we could show something like. So it's kind of long journey to.
00:43:42.494 - 00:43:45.270, Speaker B: Arrive at this simple looking result, but.
00:43:45.302 - 00:43:50.766, Speaker A: It'S a precious one. And this is, this kernel gives us.
00:43:50.790 - 00:44:07.658, Speaker B: A space Hkp and it's called Tory Addison space. And one, let me emphasize on b one.
00:44:07.746 - 00:44:44.616, Speaker A: It's on the unit ball of l. And this is something that Michael will talk about it tomorrow in further detail. The only thing which we can immediately extract from the previous theorem, because a n is not zero for all values of n, we can immediately have this code immediately. You have a corollary that it contains the product of all functional, because all.
00:44:44.680 - 00:44:59.644, Speaker B: An are non zero, the same space on v, one.
00:45:02.384 - 00:45:15.524, Speaker A: Contains every function that can be.
00:45:17.464 - 00:45:19.644, Speaker B: Expressed or can be written.
00:45:21.984 - 00:45:23.204, Speaker A: As a sum.
00:45:23.764 - 00:45:25.804, Speaker B: This is trivial.
00:45:25.884 - 00:45:29.660, Speaker A: We are in a vector space. So this doesn't matter, but sum of.
00:45:29.692 - 00:45:32.584, Speaker B: What sum of product.
00:45:34.444 - 00:45:56.724, Speaker A: Of instead of n. Now I say finitely many, because it doesn't matter if you consider one 2310 all of them, all of the coefficient a n are equal to one non zero. So finitely many bounded linear functions.
00:46:06.624 - 00:46:08.644, Speaker B: Right? So.
00:46:10.384 - 00:46:20.384, Speaker A: Product doesn't matter how many, but finitely many of functional. And of course we can sum them up.
00:46:25.644 - 00:46:26.904, Speaker B: What happened?
00:46:36.484 - 00:46:46.564, Speaker A: Special case, if l is equal to cm.
00:46:48.344 - 00:47:02.844, Speaker B: So our kp z w is one over one minus z, one w 1 bar up to zmwm bar.
00:47:05.464 - 00:47:12.914, Speaker A: This is the inner product of z and W. In this case, h of kp.
00:47:16.654 - 00:47:23.434, Speaker B: Contains what all polynomials.
00:47:26.414 - 00:48:07.814, Speaker A: Because bounded linear functionals, you consider Fej. It gives you zj when you evaluate that set, and it doesn't matter how many of them you multiply together, you can create any monomial that you wish and then sum them up. So it's all polynomials. All of the polynomials are there. And this is another difference between finite and infinite dimensional case. I didn't prove here, but I mentioned that in this case, in the finite case.
00:48:09.794 - 00:48:10.306, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:10.370 - 00:49:05.480, Speaker A: Here when we consider n, it is true that I just showed that these multiples are in kn. But it's indeed both ways. There is nothing else, I mean, just these products and then their sum. But when we go to infinite dimensional case, it contains. But there are more. In other words, all polynomials called in P is in Hkp, but not equal in this case. So that's an important space, which is the topic of this week.
00:49:05.480 - 00:49:17.784, Speaker A: And we saw Sigelbergman space. We can consider the general savings of Sigelbergman either on L or on mean.
00:49:18.724 - 00:49:22.980, Speaker B: If you, if you have l, you.
00:49:23.012 - 00:49:31.244, Speaker A: Consider a n to be one over n factorial. And then p of z is sum.
00:49:31.324 - 00:49:39.692, Speaker B: N from a n z n is.
00:49:39.748 - 00:49:53.648, Speaker A: E to the z. And so your kernel here, kp, zw, is just e to the inner product.
00:49:53.736 - 00:49:58.000, Speaker B: Of z and W. And that gives.
00:49:58.032 - 00:50:05.768, Speaker A: You a kernel which we know it's positive. And it gives because r is equal to infinity.
00:50:05.936 - 00:50:08.652, Speaker B: It gives guess sigal bar minus p.
00:50:08.688 - 00:50:13.260, Speaker A: Based on l and on cm, we.
00:50:13.292 - 00:50:31.704, Speaker B: Already saw it before, so it's h of kp is sigma on l. Remember, r is infinity.
00:50:32.764 - 00:50:38.294, Speaker A: And if l is cm, we saw.
00:50:41.754 - 00:50:59.614, Speaker B: The kernel has an interesting property, kp of z and w. In this case, z one w one r up to z m w r m.
00:51:01.494 - 00:51:09.822, Speaker A: We can write it as the product of easy z one w 1 bar e z.
00:51:09.878 - 00:51:16.566, Speaker B: Two w two bar e zn w and bar.
00:51:16.630 - 00:51:22.246, Speaker A: We can separate the variables. Not usually the case.
00:51:22.310 - 00:51:24.790, Speaker B: We can just do it in this case.
00:51:24.942 - 00:51:39.088, Speaker A: And this is the kernel for the Sigel Bergman space on C one dimensional case, the same as this one. So it's a product of one dimensional.
00:51:39.176 - 00:51:41.564, Speaker B: Sigal barg band kernels.
00:51:42.304 - 00:51:50.204, Speaker A: I repeat, not usually this is not the case. But thanks to the properties of exponential.
00:51:50.864 - 00:51:54.424, Speaker B: We can do it. We can do it in this case.
00:51:55.044 - 00:52:08.076, Speaker A: So this finishes chapter four. Lots of interesting results in this chapter. And I mean, we take a break.
00:52:08.140 - 00:52:11.516, Speaker B: And I continue with chapter five in.
00:52:11.620 - 00:52:17.612, Speaker A: Which we talk about operations on kernels, how we can add them together, multiply.
00:52:17.668 - 00:52:25.844, Speaker B: Together, or maybe then do tensor product. And we see a lot of results comes out of this.
