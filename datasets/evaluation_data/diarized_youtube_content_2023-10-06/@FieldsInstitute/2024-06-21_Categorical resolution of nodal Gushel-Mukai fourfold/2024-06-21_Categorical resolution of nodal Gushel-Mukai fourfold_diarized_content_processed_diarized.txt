00:00:00.840 - 00:00:28.364, Speaker A: Okay, so thank you, thank you. Thank you, everyone, for organizing the safe space. And I really mean that. It's amazing to be here. And also, I would just like to start with a very, very short story how the goal of this. So the visibility is already improving because whenever I apply to go to a conference at my faculty, there's all those questions. So why are there categories important and why do you want to go there? What's so fun about it? And for the first time ever, there were no questions about maths.
00:00:28.364 - 00:01:09.932, Speaker A: Honest to God, my boss asked me, so what's important about this queer stuff? What is fun about this queer stuff? And I said I would gladly draw some commutative diagrams. What's fun about queer stuff? And apparently it worked because he let me come here. Okay, so I would like to start by inspiration because it's. Oh, sorry. This is joint work with Marker and Pazzo with Marco Rampazzo from University of Bologna at the moment, like, I think for a while at least. Okay, so I'm going to start by inspiration. And this is like very down to earth talk.
00:01:09.932 - 00:01:47.926, Speaker A: Like, I mean, I'm going to be talking about very, very specific object here. So it's not really general. So inspiration is as follows. So if y is an honest to God resolution of singularities, like honest to God, we know it exists by Hironaka and so on, then we have the following factors. Yes, we have. So this is PI, obviously. So we have the push forward from dby to dby.
00:01:47.926 - 00:02:11.994, Speaker A: And the derived stuff was mentioned so many times that I don't feel forced to define it during this conference. And the pullback from d perf y tilde y. Sorry. To dby filled up. We have the following factors which are mutually adjoint. Yes. Where perf means perfect complexes.
00:02:11.994 - 00:02:59.444, Speaker A: And if the singularities are rational, then the composition of those two factors is the isomorphic to identity factor, and so on and so on. And this is like coming from geometry. And then, like, for example, Kuznetsov says, okay, so, like, we always have resolution, but for example, we not always have a crepon resolution or whatever. And maybe instead of looking at geometry, let's stick to level of categories. Yes. And so we have this definition of a categorical resolution of singularities. And a categorical resolution of singularities is a smooth, triangulated category.
00:02:59.444 - 00:03:40.642, Speaker A: Fancy D and the pair of factors. And as I have not much time, I will, you know, wave hands a little bit that emulate the behavior above. Yeah. So instead of looking at the geometry, well, like honest to guide geometry resolution of singularities and see what happens at the level of categories. So let's say, okay, let's turn this around. Yeah, the resolution of singularities will be a, some other smooth category, whatever the hell a smooth category is, and the pair of factors that emulates this. Yes.
00:03:40.642 - 00:05:02.608, Speaker A: So in that way we can look at the resolution of singularities from the higher point of view and we get some nice results. For example, we can define, well, Kozhniatsovka and some other smart people smarter than I am can define like crepend resolution of singularities and so on and so on. And for example, there are situations when we do not have the geometric crepend resolution of singularities, but yet we can find the categorical ones. So there is like some nice natural generalization and continuing with the inspiration, in zero eight, Kuznetsov stated the following conjecture that if y is a cubic fourfold, then y is rational. If and only if the ay, the, well, we can call it Kuznetsov component because he's not here. Then the Kuznetsov component defined, which I will define in a moment, if Kuznetsov component is equivalent to a derived category of a k free surface. So this is his conjecture from his wonderful paper from zero eight.
00:05:02.608 - 00:05:39.036, Speaker A: And he like goes through the examples of that, you know, support this conjecture. What is ay? So if we have a, so basically this is, okay, so maybe what is ay? So if Dpy is the semi orthogonal decomposition of the category of cubic fourfold, then ay is defined. Well, as usual. Yes. Yeah. As the guy that's orthogonal to the rest. Yeah.
00:05:39.036 - 00:06:13.274, Speaker A: So there are no arrows going from a y to the, sorry, from the right stuff to the left. Yeah, there are no arrows going from right to the left. So yeah, so conjecture. Cubic forefold is rational. If and only if this guy, yeah, this guy is equivalent to the direct category of a k free surface. And okay, this is visible. And for example there is a case of nodal cubic fourfold, wonderfully worked out.
00:06:13.274 - 00:07:12.168, Speaker A: So maybe more drawing. Okay, so if we take another cubic fourfold and we blow up the singular point. So like in a, you know, standard thing, we blow up the singular point over it, we get a smooth quadric of dimension three. Yeah, this is fourfold, this dimension free. Yeah. And so this is the exceptional divisor over the singular point. This lives nicely in the, in the blown up nodal cubic forefold.
00:07:12.168 - 00:07:35.820, Speaker A: Then we can actually take the other projection. Yes, we can think of the, we can look at this resolution of singularities. We can project it to before. And what it turns out, actually, we see that this guy is the blow up of a p four in a k free surface. Yes. This is a blow up of a p four in a k free surface. This k free surface.
00:07:35.820 - 00:08:05.974, Speaker A: Okay, so like if I have a nodal, this is zero, f two plus f three. So if my variables go from z zero to z, blah, blah, blah, I mean before, I mean p five. Yeah. So if my variables go from z zero to z five, then I can think about a nodal cubic fourfold defined like that. Yes. So in f two and in f three, z zero does not exist. Yes.
00:08:05.974 - 00:08:39.454, Speaker A: Locally this is smooth degree two, something. So basically s s would be the intersection of f two and f three in p four. Yeah. So this is a k free surface by the a junction formula, for example. And so we have two blow ups of, well, two ways of describe the y tilde. Yes. And like, you know, taking a cue from John Mitchell, we look at y from both sides now and we, you know, we, we look at the direct category of y tilde, sorry.
00:08:39.454 - 00:09:02.144, Speaker A: In two ways. Yeah. So very quickly, very quickly. Okay, PI, this, I'm just projecting, I'm projecting, it's projection from the node. Well, after, you know, blow up and. Yeah, and projection. Yeah.
00:09:02.144 - 00:10:21.054, Speaker A: So we can look at the category, the right category of Y into A. So on one hand, dby Tilde is this. Yeah, so this is left hand side. This is, this is stuff coming from the exceptional divisor. And this is, well, this is basically coming from it, from this guy. But from the right hand side by Olaf blow up formula, for example, we know that DBy is this, sorry, of course this is p four. Yeah, yeah, of course.
00:10:21.054 - 00:11:09.244, Speaker A: And the answers will reveal the depths of my ignorance. So it's, what is this symbol? Oh, so this is when we, this is the semi orthogonal decomposition of the drive category. This how we write that. Okay, so like someone mentioned some, it was mentioned a few times already, so I assumed if they got away with it, I would, without defining what the semi orthogonal decomposition is like, basically we take the drive category of something and, you know, like the arrows only go one way. So you can think about this like this generates the triangulate category. These are like full triangulate subcategories. And the arrows go only one way.
00:11:09.244 - 00:11:41.124, Speaker A: Yes. And also the arrows only go one way and there's, yeah, the order matters. Well, because it's already there. Yes, it's there. We can just, you know, can we take, because this will take long. Can we like move it to the after. After party.
00:11:41.124 - 00:11:49.424, Speaker A: Yeah. Like it is there. Like, these are standard results. Yes. Like, standard for people who do that. Yeah. Okay, so.
00:11:49.424 - 00:12:30.304, Speaker A: Okay, let me get back to. So we can look at this direct category in two ways, because. And the wonderful part of this paper, the wonderful result, the inspiring one, is that actually, ay, is equivalent to this phi of DBS. So this is not obvious. Yes. But when we have the two semi orthogonal decompositions of the same category, we hope to find, like, for example, mutation that takes us from one to the other. And in this work, there are explicitly given mutations that show that this guy is this guy.
00:12:30.304 - 00:12:51.986, Speaker A: Well, they are equivalent. This guy is this guy. So in this case, we know what this component, which up to yesterday, but as Tyler nicely pointed out to me, like, this is known, and this is computable just in other ways that we've been trying to do it. But up to yesterday, I believe it was difficult to find. So thank you, Tyler. This. Well, knowing what this component is.
00:12:51.986 - 00:13:00.754, Speaker A: Is a big part of fun. Yes. So we don't know what this. We know this component exists. Yes. Because this component is, like, defined in a very, you know, non explicit way. Yes.
00:13:00.754 - 00:13:12.746, Speaker A: I want it to be orthogonal to the rest. Yeah. So, like, this is. This is given by sort of, by definition. And here we can find it, like, very, very geometrically. Yes. So we can find it that this is the derives category.
00:13:12.746 - 00:14:06.412, Speaker A: Well, this is equivalent to the rice category of the Cape resurface. And so that was the Kuznetsov's work from 2008, and then a few years later, it was even more precisely refined. So, 23. And I'm extremely sorry if I mispronounce names of the people. So, Kapani, Giovanzana, Liu, Magni, Martivali, Petrusi and song, they have this wonderful theorem that the kernel of dbs to ay no tilde involved. Yes, because DBS and ay Tilde. This is sort of the same guy.
00:14:06.412 - 00:14:35.880, Speaker A: But then the. This guy goes to a. Yes. This is the resolution of singularities at the level of a y. So there is some kernel. And the kernel of this is classically generated by t pushed forward of queer s, where t straight s. So this is straight s.
00:14:35.880 - 00:15:16.680, Speaker A: Sorry. Is the inclusion of k three into q, and queer s is the spinner bundle on Q. So not only we know what this Kuznetsov component looks like, we also know what. Well, thanks to them, we also know what dies. Yes. What dies from the resolution of singularities to the singular guy. So this is like a very, very nice, explicit geometric description of what's happening there.
00:15:16.680 - 00:15:25.056, Speaker A: Yes. This is pure magic. Right. You can see the geometry underneath it. Not behind it, but underneath it. Yes. So this is the inspiration.
00:15:25.056 - 00:15:46.084, Speaker A: And so what's the next step after cubic fourfold? As, of course, not all Ghushal Makai fourfold. Right. This is out of the question. Yeah. So we are trying to do. And we are like close to finishing it. We are trying to do similar stuff for nodal Gushul Mukai forefold.
00:15:46.084 - 00:16:04.866, Speaker A: So let's say our case. Okay. Title, title. Yes. No, no. Q is the quadricep. Is there a quadric? Yeah, it's the exceptional divisor.
00:16:04.866 - 00:16:48.014, Speaker A: Yeah. So on the quadrix we have spinner bundles. This is three dimensional quadric. So one spinner bundle, we know which one it is. Okay, so let XP be a nodal. So what is it? Okay, so we can think of XP as the intersection of a G 25 with a hyperplane with a nodal quadricep. So this, everything lives in P.
00:16:48.014 - 00:17:10.370, Speaker A: Well, P nine. Yes, this lives in P nine. G two five lives in P nine. Intersect with a hyperplane, intersect with a nodal quadrig. Of course we want this node to live on this hyperplane and live on this Grassmannian. So this node is. Well, it doesn't appear because of tangency or whatever, this node, like, honest to God, we put a nodal quadric there and the node survives on the x.
00:17:10.370 - 00:17:28.724, Speaker A: Of course. Then we have a following diagram. Yes. Okay, so now the picture is gonna be huge. I should squeeze it here. Okay, so. Or maybe not.
00:17:28.724 - 00:18:45.910, Speaker A: Oh, I will first draw a picture, then I will explain what is what. Okay, so we have a following picture. Maybe instead of writing what is what, I will explain it a little bit and then prove some stuff. So this is our nodal gushol mokai four fold. So this is the equivalent of Yp. Now we blow it up. Honest to God, we blow it up.
00:18:45.910 - 00:19:03.690, Speaker A: We have something with a quadric living inside. And now we have another projection. So now we're projecting to p seven. Why p seven? Because of course, this lives in p nine. But since we're intersecting with h, h is a p eight in p nine. So we can think about Xp as living in p eight. Yes.
00:19:03.690 - 00:19:29.476, Speaker A: So we're projecting from p eight to p seven. Now t, and you have to believe me on that, is the intersection of three quadrics. And by abuse of notation, by abusive notation, I will write this as intersection of Qp. Qp is the guy living upstairs. But again, this is another quadric. So I can ignore nodal quadric can be written as something without one variable. After projection, the equation is exactly the same.
00:19:29.476 - 00:19:45.984, Speaker A: But now it's a smooth quadric downstairs. Yes. So t is an intersection of three quadrics and. Oh, I'm out of time. Geez. So inside that there is a p four. Inside that there is a p four.
00:19:45.984 - 00:20:16.120, Speaker A: So those first of first two quadrics like intersection slightly more than they should. And now what are we doing? We are blowing p seven and p four. We are blowing up the p seven and p four and we're getting a p five vibration over p two. That's where we're getting a p five vibration over p two. Each p five is basically geometrically responsible. Oh, and by the way, this construction is inspired by kapustka. Kapustka beanie.
00:20:16.120 - 00:20:35.744, Speaker A: This is from day pepper. So this is inspired by their work. So now we blow up the p seven and p four. We get p five vibration over p two. And each fiber is like a p five containing this p four. Sort of. And now what happens with those quadrics? Those quadrics contain this p four.
00:20:35.744 - 00:20:50.346, Speaker A: So if a quad, so I intersect this quadrig with p five, I get a four dimensional quadric, a four dimensional quadric containing p four. So there is only one option. This quadric is reducible. Right. So those quadrics become an intersection of two p four s. Yes. So one p four is the one that we're projecting from.
00:20:50.346 - 00:21:15.398, Speaker A: The other p four survives in the fiber just as a p four. So intersection of those two guys in the fiber is intersection of p four and p four and p five, which is a p three. So we have a p three vibration over p two. And then we intersect with one more quadric. This quadric now intersects it nicely. So we have a quadric vibration over p two. So r quadricep vibration over p two.
00:21:15.398 - 00:21:34.918, Speaker A: Yes. R now is a quadratic vibration over p two. And this guy. And this guy are birational. Yes, they are birational. So we have. So this is like one step further, one step more difficult than this, because here we have two descriptions of the same guy.
00:21:34.918 - 00:21:46.846, Speaker A: Of the same guy. Here we don't have two descriptions of the same guy. We have birationality between two guys. Yes. And this is quadric vibration. Fibers are two dimensional quadrics. Yes.
00:21:46.846 - 00:22:17.944, Speaker A: So now what is this? S is the. Well, basically, s is a cone over p one, cross p two intersected with hyperplane section intersected with q. So this is a surface. And this is what we see. These are basically the lines passing through the nodes that are contracted. This is, well, you can think about some surface. This is a p one vibration over gamma.
00:22:17.944 - 00:22:39.974, Speaker A: Here s hat is another p one vibration over gamma. Gamma is a degree six curve. Degree six curve. So you probably see where it's going. Where it's going to. Yeah. So now what is this? What is the upper part of the picture? So the upper part of the picture is the Makai flop.
00:22:39.974 - 00:23:39.720, Speaker A: And let's say lemma. Oh, thanks, lemma. This guy is a simple k equivalence in particular. So with, yeah, in particular it is, well, it is a resolution of this, you know, of the intermency locus of this birationality. Right. And f is p one bundle over s and over hat and locally trivial p one cross p one vibration over gamma. Yes.
00:23:39.720 - 00:24:09.658, Speaker A: So we have a p one vibration over gamma, p one vibration the other way over gamma. So this is a p one cross p one vibration over gamma. We contract one p one. So we get s, we contract other p one. S, we get s hat. So this is basically the whole story on the exceptional divisor, so to say. And now the only thing that's left is actually, see, you know, how the derived category of this and this relate to each other? Because like if this is a k equivalence and this stuff is birational, in this case, in this case, this implies the derived equivalence.
00:24:09.658 - 00:25:47.830, Speaker A: So from this we know that dbx tilde is equivalent to DBR and. Okay, okay, sorry, too many boards in particular. Okay, I have, oh, I'm over time already. So maybe just quickly so we can write dBR. This is again from Kuznetsov because this is quadric vibration. This is, I promise this is the last board and dbx tilde as quite similarly to the cubic fourfold case. So u dual is the dual to the universe is coming from the Grassmannian.
00:25:47.830 - 00:26:06.092, Speaker A: Yes. Universal bundle of the Grassmannian. H's are hyperplane sections. Zeta is the, sorry, Psi. Psi is the relative of one of the vibration. And b, okay, b is the monster. B is a dbp two, b zero.
00:26:06.092 - 00:26:45.112, Speaker A: So this is derived category of b zero modules of a Clifford algebra. And please don't ask me what it is. And these are the derived categories of those guys. And we have explicit mutation as a subcategories of this, of this bigger x, of this common, of the guy living over them. And so we have this, so we have this, we have equivalents of this, but, and we can show that they are equivalent. Everything works. But we, so far we are unable to see where this guy goes.
00:26:45.112 - 00:27:09.092, Speaker A: Exactly. And our hope, and our hope goal is this. That b is actually equivalent to ay tilde. Yes, that would be the, that would be the equivalent statement to this one. Yeah, this is, this we're trying to get. We're trying to. Whatever.
00:27:09.092 - 00:27:36.746, Speaker A: We're trying to show that this guy goes to this guy. But actually this is slightly more complicated because first, in this case, because first of all, we have this equivalence, which we would have, but then also after that, we should see the mutations inside one of the categories. Yes. So there's like more work to be done. But actually yesterday's talk with Taylor got me hopeful about, you know, other approach to that problem or like equivalent approach to the problem. So maybe this will, this will happen. But yeah, basically this is what we're trying to do.
00:27:36.746 - 00:28:08.964, Speaker A: Yes. We are trying to mimic or, you know, like find analogous thing to this, to this wonderful geometric description of the, of the cosine, of component of this resolution of singularities and maybe even find the kernel. There is some more stuff happening on fibers, but honestly, I have no time to talk about it. But basically this is where we are and this is wonderful birational thing and this is what we're trying to get. And hopefully it's like we're five minutes away from it. Just the correct five minutes away from it. Okay, so thank you very much.
