00:00:00.200 - 00:00:12.113, Speaker A: Or wait, did we wait for 230? Yeah. Oh really? It was 2:32.
00:00:12.169 - 00:00:16.209, Speaker B: I said if you would have been late then we could have shifted it back.
00:00:16.257 - 00:00:30.389, Speaker A: Oh, I'm so sorry for making you. Because I was upstair and I. I felt that is 2:30. I was. Okay, okay. Thank you. And I'm so sorry.
00:00:30.389 - 00:01:40.509, Speaker A: So the topic of the talk is the understanding the pandemic dynamics through the lens of the human behavior. It's not exactly related to the mathematics for oncology, but I hope that we can find some implications that apply to the mathematics of the oncology. Because I find some similarities between the containment policies that investigated here and the treatment of the cancer and the people response. So we can apply this approach to the treatment modeling. So first I will review the research motivation and then I will review the behavior epidemiological framework that's familiar to you. Most of you are familiar with this concept. And we will talk about further about transmission dynamics that I expanded SIR model here and then we will discuss the result and I hope that we can find some solution for applications.
00:01:40.509 - 00:02:41.375, Speaker A: So the main question of this research is that how the interaction of the people response to containment policies and the containment policies affect the dynamics of the dynamics of the pandemic. And also the other question is that how do the people decide to respond to containment policies? You know that how the SIR models applied. And these models are mostly applied to predict the dynamics of the pandemic and different disease, infectious diseases mostly since the COVID 19 as well. It was different version of these models. I mean the SIR model is a family of models. You are familiar with this concept, susceptible, infectious and recovered people. So these models and its variations are applied to forecast a disease transmission.
00:02:41.375 - 00:03:38.699, Speaker A: And these models are good tools and powerful tools to predict the disease. And also they have good insights for the decision making as well. So. But these models have some simple assumptions. Although there are some papers that revised these basic assumptions recently, especially during the COVID 19. They assume that the transmission of the disease between the different compartments is such that the contact rate is stationary and is constant. And this theory assumes that people contact each other randomly, like the particles of the perfect gas colliding within the box.
00:03:38.699 - 00:04:23.945, Speaker A: And then it will be happen that the disease transmitted from infectious to susceptible people. So in fact this, the limitation or the restriction of this approach is that it ignores the behavior of the individuals. The most important part of the phenomenon that's related to the human being is the human response to any phenomenon. Okay, so. And then also the basic versions of the Model these models they didn't. They didn't study the government policies. But recently the government policies are integrated.
00:04:23.945 - 00:05:55.835, Speaker A: Although some version of the models are applied, for example, for vaccination in and studied the long term of the behavior of some disease, for example, for the vaccination as a policy. But for infectious diseases there are limited number of studies that they have studied the government policies. So bringing these two aspects into the model, we assume that interaction between the containment policies, a set of measures that the government uses to control the disease and also the people response impacts and determines the outcome of the outbreak over time. And as you know, since the COVID 19 the governments imposed a set of restrictions or policy measures like the school closures, social distancing, workplace closure and mask wearing. And a set of this that in different countries, depending on the structure of political structure they could use. And there are some indices that they determine the government policy. Strange as well that we use one of them in this study to calibrate the model as well.
00:05:55.835 - 00:07:31.035, Speaker A: So these policies investigations statistical investigation shows that these policies in fact had effective impact on the disease control. But what is important is that how the mechanism can be explained mathematically. Okay, so here I mentioned to some in pre call studies that some, for example Anderson and ll they utilize mobility data to examine the effect of physical distancing annihilation and showed that the contact rate in British Columbia in Canada decreased by so it means that the government policies had positive impact on the number of contacts. So the decrease in number of contact resulted in the decrease in the number of infections. And also another study here they use the age stratified models and compartment model to study the transmission of COVID within Ontario under alternative scenarios. And the results also shows that the policies have positive impact on the number of contacts. So as I mentioned, in these models, statistically we can show that these policies have positive impact on the number of contact and the number of infection.
00:07:31.035 - 00:08:37.273, Speaker A: So but when we release the restrictions or we remove the restrictions, we see that there is a sharp increase in the number of infections. And it happened during the COVID 19. So here we want to model what is the reason behind of this different behavior. So to have a more realistic perspective on pandemic, we developed a mathematical model that incorporates behavior aspects of the disease into the model. So but as I mentioned that behavioral epidemiology is not in use since 1990. Some researchers use this approach to study the behavior of the families with respect to the kids vaccinations in some disease. So it's not new.
00:08:37.273 - 00:09:39.417, Speaker A: But also some studies As I mentioned here, the most pioneering one is Capasso and Serio. It belongs to 1978 that they studied that contact rates are decreasing function of disease prevalence and then the force of infection as well. So it will be a nonlinear procedure. So, based on this idea, we developed a framework I will show in the next slide. But first I will mention to the assumptions behind this framework. We assume that the government has and also the people they have a set of information to decide. Both the government decides to design and conduct the containment policies and the people decide to respond to these policies and to disease in general.
00:09:39.417 - 00:10:33.839, Speaker A: Okay, so, but the government uses in this model that I I didn't bring to this slide. But there is a mechanism, you are familiar to your Markov decision process. And we assume that the government has a set of limited number of the actions that can decide, for example, to open or to close, to allow schools to be closed or to be open. So we have a set of actions that the government decides it's binary decision. And then the government optimize or maximize for example, a utility function or minimize the cost function. In this paper we assume that it minimizes the cost of the actions. And on the other side, the people respond to these policies.
00:10:33.839 - 00:11:39.575, Speaker A: So the people response depends on their risk perception first of all, and they analyze the costs and benefits of different attitudes to the containment policies. Here we assume that people have two alternatives, the low and high compliance to the policies. So then they will compare the cost of different level of compliance. And then they will decide to switch between different alternatives. So and here the pandemic outcome depends on the interaction of these policies and response of the people. And then we assume that the set of information, which is a function integration of the number of infectious and also a kernel function will be updated over time. And then the government revised the policies dynamically and also the people response will be changed over time.
00:11:39.575 - 00:12:44.879, Speaker A: So this framework shows that how the interaction works. As you see, M is a set of information and Z is a set of policies could be indexed like this model that we assumed. But we can extend it to different policy measures. And the bet is the behavior of the people in response to policies and how the people simple response and receive given the set of information will affect to its the outbreak outcome. So can you see? I don't know what is the problem? The title is not clear. Okay, so as I mentioned, the government and also the people have a set of information. We assume this index for the set of information is integration of H is an increasing function of I t minus tau and the kernel function.
00:12:44.879 - 00:13:36.653, Speaker A: Here we assume two scale kernel function because of the information is a quiz. And also and the second is assumed for the fading of the memory. You know that the information is collected regarding the infections. Here we mean the confirmed number of infections. So and also as you know that the people when consider the information, then the recent information has a higher way in their decisions. So the old information way in the decision will be much lower. So this is because of that we assume that we have a two scale kernel function.
00:13:36.653 - 00:14:26.533, Speaker A: The T2 is for fading memory. That it means that the importance of the information will decrease over time and people use recent information in the decision. So based on that, we can have to this ODE and we can integrate them into our system of equations. So, next step is that to explain how the people behavior is formed. So I call behavior of the individuals. You know that the people response to pandemic generally and policies also can be grouped in two parts. The first part is the natural response.
00:14:26.533 - 00:15:06.253, Speaker A: And the other section or the other part of the behavior is imitation. Behavior by imitation, I mean that the pupil in fact sample other people. So if you assume that each individual can be at a low or a high level of compliance. So the low level compliant people will sample other people and will switch to the high level if there is a benefit. Okay. Regarding the cost benefit analysis, I will discuss and also the high level compliance people also will sample other the. The other people.
00:15:06.253 - 00:15:49.451, Speaker A: So the imitation means that the people look at other people. If they for example, use mask or they. They do not go to the workplace, so they close their workplace, they will do the same. Sorry. So this behavior, I I call it imitation behavior. So, and also the extent to which the people accept the restriction depends on their perception of the risk. The perception of the risk is important part of this analysis because when you assume that if you for example, wear the mask, the risk of infection will decrease, so it affects your behavior.
00:15:49.451 - 00:17:00.535, Speaker A: So it can affect the level of compliance to the policies. So and at the end, the level of the or the response of the people to the policies depends on the two forces, the natural response and imitation response as well. So here, as I explained, the people will choose between two level of compliance. And also I explained, I think there is no need to go further. So here I assume that the payoff to each level of compliance can be considered as P Low is the payoff to the low level of the compliance, which depends on the information set that the people have access to and also the policies. Z is the policy index. So the an ML&MH both of them are the response to the set of information that the people receive.
00:17:00.535 - 00:18:02.255, Speaker A: So as you see, the payoff to the higher level of compliance is more expensive because the higher compliance force you to pay more. For example, the people, if, for example, restrict themselves from going to shopping so their utility will decrease. And also in terms of the, you can calculate in term of monetary costs and also the. When they restrict themselves from, they're going to the workplace, so it costs them, okay. In term of decreasing the wages as well, if they wanted to wear masks and use some sanitizers and something like that, so it will cost them. Okay, so generally MT is information index that I explained in previous slides. Here I explained that M is the information index that we integrate into our model.
00:18:02.255 - 00:18:22.141, Speaker A: Yeah, the information is integration of the H, which is increasing function of the number of infections I and also the kernel function that is because of the, you know, the acquisition of the information and the, the fading information.
00:18:22.253 - 00:18:25.397, Speaker C: Information comes from the government policies.
00:18:25.501 - 00:18:30.665, Speaker A: Yeah, and also the people. Okay, So.
00:18:34.245 - 00:18:42.551, Speaker C: I would say that's what they're saying for their purpose. It's not for my purpose.
00:18:42.743 - 00:19:16.167, Speaker A: Exactly. Here we assume that there is one set of information that's officially published, okay? But the people can receive information from different sources. So we can assume different set of information. So that will be an extension to this model. And we can assume that people have their own set of information, the government has its own set of information. Then the decision of government depends on, for example, their own information. And as well the people response depends on the set of information that they receive, for example, from social media and other.
00:19:16.167 - 00:20:10.273, Speaker A: But here we assume that the information is those information that officially published. And as I mentioned, by the infections, I mean the confirmed cases. So and also there is a delay in the confirmed cases because the information should be collected and purified and then published officially. So these are the extension in the model that we can assume as well. So, and I talk about the fading memory and also this mechanism in fact modifies the perception of the infection risk. Okay. Based on the number of cases and that the number of cases that published officially.
00:20:10.273 - 00:21:17.725, Speaker A: Okay, And I think that there is no need to talk about this slide. I have explained on that previous slide, but let me go to the mechanism that we have, as I mentioned, that we have two level of compliance and we have two payoff for, for each level. And then delta P is the difference between the low level and high level of compliance. So based on that, the delta P is higher or greater than 0 or less than 0, there will be a switch or the between two level of the compliance. So as I mentioned, the people will sample the other groups and then we respond to the policies. So if for example delta p is greater than zero, then change in behavior is governed by the equation 8 which shows that the delta is the rate of the sampling of other people. Gamma B is the response.
00:21:17.725 - 00:22:05.963, Speaker A: It means that the response is in fact the elasticity to the change in the cost or the benefits. Here we mean the payoff. So not all people will respond in the same structure. So this means that when delta P is greater than zero, this equation will derive the change in the behavior. Also if delta P is less than zero, then the change in the behavior will be will be expressed by the equation number nine that shows that how the people sample. So as you see that bt is the response to the policy. So 1 minus p means the not to response.
00:22:05.963 - 00:22:40.775, Speaker A: Okay, so and we can assume that eta is the average or the. And also we combine them. Then the deriving equation is DB dt that shows the change of the behavior over time in response to change in the delta P positive or negative. So it depends. So this structure between risk negatives. I will talk about the other. This is the imitation part of the behavior.
00:22:40.775 - 00:23:30.035, Speaker A: Yeah, but the natural I call the natural response. The second part is the natural response that Q is the perception of the risk. That is the probability of decrease in the infection when the people follow the rules of the policies. So this means the decrease in the number of infection. This perception of the risk in fact drives the natural behavior of the people with respect to the policies and the disease. So here we combine the second part shows the natural or response in fact to the disease. So here Q is a driving factor.
00:23:30.035 - 00:24:12.435, Speaker A: And it also depends on the infection rate and the number of infections. So it will be. It's called natural response. So we can combine them. Then we will have this equation that integrates both part the imitation behavior as well as the natural response to the disease. So here, as you see, the set of information determines the and also the policies play a critical role in the behavior. And the perception of the risk as well has critical point.
00:24:12.775 - 00:24:21.955, Speaker C: So people are influenced by number of infections infected people or number of people who died.
00:24:24.935 - 00:24:56.153, Speaker A: Here we assume that the people decide to respond to the policies based on the risk perception. If for example, they assume that following the rules will decrease their risk of infection, then they they increase the level of the compliance, okay? So naturally by regarding of the behavior, regardless of the behavior of the other people. Okay, this is the natural. I call the natural behavior but if.
00:24:56.169 - 00:25:00.951, Speaker C: You die, it's matter of behavior, it's a matter of freedom.
00:25:01.063 - 00:25:21.275, Speaker A: Yeah, it. It depends that you're right. That's a good question. You know, basically the severity of. You mean the severity of the disease. How much is severe or how. How much is the probability of death? But here we consider the probability, the decrease in the probability of the infection.
00:25:21.275 - 00:25:46.557, Speaker A: But yeah, we can assume that, you know, as an extension that we can consider this aspect that the people. The probability of death is. You mean that depends on the rate of the death or the probability of this.
00:25:46.661 - 00:25:55.545, Speaker C: How it's not. At some point the government here said on the radio how many people died today.
00:25:56.125 - 00:26:05.021, Speaker A: But also they published the information about the number of infection. Everything depends on the number of infection here, not the number of death.
00:26:05.173 - 00:26:38.115, Speaker C: People who are really scared death. They calculate the probability that they will die if they. If I can take you further to use a mask or not use. So there was a lot of debate and there was a lot of misinformation like with V. Oh, the mask is only protecting other people, not yourself.
00:26:38.815 - 00:26:39.591, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:26:39.703 - 00:26:51.405, Speaker C: And then some people say the mask is really redundant and actually blocks your breathing. So the perception now is very difficult to.
00:26:51.905 - 00:27:16.853, Speaker A: Yeah. In our result we show that your point is very important because when the people perception is high at the beginning of the pandemic, okay. And they expect that they will be less infected. Okay. So the probability of infection bit much less. So they will comply more. Okay.
00:27:16.853 - 00:27:41.843, Speaker A: So but over time their behaviors will change. You know, basically why? Because when the people see that other people are wearing the mask, they say oh, it's not necessary because they are covering themselves. They. They wear the mask. So I'm protected because they. The same that you mentioned that the misinformation. You call it as a misinformation.
00:27:41.843 - 00:28:36.941, Speaker A: But this is again another side of the coin that the people decide on the perception of this when the others. So we have two parts of the behavior, the natural and imitation. I sample others and also naturally I decide based on my perception of the. The diseases. So this is a set of the equations that as you see, this is an extended version of the SIR model. The first integrates the policy and the behavior into the model as well. And also we have the driving equation and the motion of the behavior and also the set of information that's here we have new.
00:28:36.941 - 00:29:36.245, Speaker A: It shows the decrease in the information over time as well. It depends on the behavior of the people as well and the policy and the response of the people to the policies as well. So here I didn't mention to how to do decision of the government. But as briefly, I said that the government decides to set the policies. You know, basically the government received the information set, okay? And then set a level of the optimum information and then converge it if the information is greater than level. So the policy will be conducted, otherwise it will be released. So here, for simplicity, I just assume that the change in the government policy is a function of the set of information.
00:29:36.245 - 00:30:35.415, Speaker A: So the gamma Z is in fact the response of the government to that set of information that the government has access to. So another point in this paper is that we assume that theta the rate of transmission is a function of a number of contacts. So here we assume an updating function, this algebraic function for the number of contacts. The number of contacts is average number of contacts each age group has with other age groups on average. Okay, so we have a matrix in fact that represent the number of contacts of each age group. Here we average because the model is the aggregate model. We can in fact stratify the model to different age groups.
00:30:35.415 - 00:31:22.361, Speaker A: But here we have updating level of the contact shows that the policies will affect the the level of contacts on average. C note, is the number of contact before the pandemic or initial number of contacts. And Z bar is the maximum level of the policies which converge to 1 or 100. That is represented in two indices. And we normalize that. And also Z0 is the initial level of the policies that the government was witnessing and deciding collecting collecting the information. And at that time there was no serious policy conduct.
00:31:22.361 - 00:32:02.913, Speaker A: I will show the index for that. And RZ is the rate of decreasing the policy over time. Here, as you see, the contact number CIJ is the number of contacts at the house, the the school, the workplace. And the last one should be the community. Sorry, that is the community that was the mistake number 21. I should correct that. So this is the number of contact at the house means that how you know the the number of contacts at the home and also school and workplace.
00:32:02.913 - 00:32:52.579, Speaker A: So CIJ is the average weighted average of the number of contacts in the community. So to track and model the government policies, we applied ox. CGRT is an index developed by Oxford University. This index shows the weighted average of the different indices. So they assume sub measures for that index and they calculated the weighted average. Also we can study also different policy measures because the data is available. And also we fit the kernel function here.
00:32:52.579 - 00:33:30.591, Speaker A: This shows the scatter ground between commutative number of cases and the oxyt. As you see that with increasing the cumulative Number of cases. The level of the policies has been increased. The maximum level for The Ontario was 77, I think, as I remember. But it could be maximum 100. It means that everything is closed and the mass gathering is restricted. There is no transaction, there is no the schools are all closed.
00:33:30.591 - 00:34:38.154, Speaker A: Workplaces or unnecessary workplaces are closed. So the first version of the simulation of the model, the system of equation shows that under two alternative scenarios we see that the number of infection with the policy regarding the in fact the response of the people how can affect the peak of the infection number. And also it will postpone the date of the peak as well. So the dash line shows the infected number with the policy. And the solid red one is the number of infection without the policy. So the policy integrating the policy and the response of the people into the policies can impact the number of infections over time and the maximum level of the number of infections. Here we also simulated for different level of the information.
00:34:38.154 - 00:35:45.837, Speaker A: We assumed that the initial level of information plays a critical role in the government decision. As I mentioned, how the government decides and also the individual's response to the policies. So I simulated the model for different level of the information. As you see here, if the initial level of information is low, so there will not be much impact on the maximum number of infections. But it will postpone the peak because there is some information and it's different from when you have no information about the thesis. And if we increase the level of the information we will see that there will be not only the maximum number of infection will decrease also the it will impact the date of the maximum. And if we increase to M0 to 0.5
00:35:45.837 - 00:35:53.485, Speaker A: then there will be a sharp decrease in the number of infections. So it means that how important is the information?
00:35:53.605 - 00:36:03.625, Speaker C: In our model quite similar shape occur, especially the upper one.
00:36:04.365 - 00:36:09.325, Speaker A: So the solid red is without delay.
00:36:09.625 - 00:36:12.769, Speaker C: Between the dash one and the red one.
00:36:12.937 - 00:36:13.725, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:14.065 - 00:36:16.765, Speaker C: What about this delay? What's causing this?
00:36:18.065 - 00:37:03.515, Speaker A: You know, this is because the people response also depends on the information that they receive and the government decision. As I mentioned, the information should be collected, purified and then published legally. There is a delay. Yeah. So also the response of the people to policies, the gamma B is the parameter for different level of the response. We also see that how it affects the number of infections over time and also the maximum number of the infections. And also the last simulation is your point that you mentioned the perception of the risk.
00:37:03.515 - 00:37:37.473, Speaker A: Here we simulated for 3 level of Q the perception of the risk. We assume it's parametric, but it could be Modeled as an extension. But here we assume parametric. We assume three levels. As you see, the first level of Q is the minimum level. So when we, at the beginning of the pandemic, when the, the, the people perception is that, okay, the probability of the infection decreasing, the probability of infection is low. So the response which will be much lower.
00:37:37.473 - 00:38:02.577, Speaker A: So the level of compliance will be lower. Okay. So here as you see, the first peak will be much higher than the others. Okay. So in comparison to other level. And if we compare that when the perception is high, then the level of the compliance will increase and the number of infection will decrease. But over time there will be a change in the behavior.
00:38:02.577 - 00:38:49.137, Speaker A: As you see that although at the beginning the people perceived that if they follow and comply with the policies, they will be less impacted. But over time the imitation behavior will impact. So they will sample other people over time and they say okay, other people are for example, they wearing masks, they close their businesses, they, they less travel. So they will increase their level of the consumption, the level of the activity. So as you see, the second peak is much higher for the higher level of the risk perception. And it, it happened during the pandemic, over the pandemic. And I fall so sharply because people.
00:38:49.201 - 00:38:52.525, Speaker C: May be tired of obeying the.
00:38:54.225 - 00:38:56.561, Speaker D: Right, Tired.
00:38:56.633 - 00:38:58.005, Speaker A: Oh, tired. Yeah.
00:38:58.345 - 00:39:01.481, Speaker C: I get how many, how many days.
00:39:01.513 - 00:39:23.705, Speaker A: You, yeah, but still you see some people are wearing the mask in the street and you see, even they are alone in their car and they are wearing the mask. That is another. Yeah, yeah. This is the perception of the risk and it shows that how people are risk averse or risk taker. Exactly. Yes.
00:39:34.525 - 00:39:47.875, Speaker C: Look at the accumulated numbers of infections. You look into that. Is that, is that sort of a relationship?
00:39:49.015 - 00:39:52.615, Speaker A: You mean that the accumulated number of infections is the same?
00:39:52.735 - 00:39:54.471, Speaker C: No, that's what I'm asking.
00:39:54.623 - 00:40:02.199, Speaker A: I, I, I didn't calculate it, but I, I can, I can do it. Yeah. With the, yeah.
00:40:02.367 - 00:40:15.959, Speaker C: So just in the eyeball one, the integral over the red and the blue might be about the same, right? The yellow one might be. But I, I what I wonder, is there a relationship?
00:40:16.047 - 00:40:27.515, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's interesting. Yeah, that goes. Good question. Yeah, I will do it to see how is the calculation we are. But it seems that they are not equal.
00:40:27.855 - 00:40:29.475, Speaker C: I wouldn't expect them to be.
00:40:30.345 - 00:40:30.745, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:30.785 - 00:40:32.645, Speaker A: Which one is much higher? Yeah.
00:40:40.785 - 00:40:41.805, Speaker C: Do you get some.
00:40:43.105 - 00:40:43.885, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:45.185 - 00:40:45.785, Speaker C: Yes.
00:40:45.865 - 00:41:16.279, Speaker A: Yeah. If for example, assume a spectrum for Q and then simulate for a hundred or more than. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then we can figure out the relation between accumulated number and the level of the Risk perception. The first pick is too close to each other. Yeah. The peaks are close to each other, but the level.
00:41:16.367 - 00:41:18.063, Speaker C: Yes. So I just wonder.
00:41:18.239 - 00:41:18.955, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:21.935 - 00:41:23.075, Speaker C: Relationships.
00:41:23.455 - 00:41:36.985, Speaker A: Great, Great. Good idea. I will simulate for that. Thank you. Thank you for this comment. I will simulate for spectrum of the queue and then how will be the results? And. Yeah.
00:41:36.985 - 00:41:40.505, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, thank you.
00:41:41.245 - 00:41:53.073, Speaker D: If you want to look at infection infections, you can just look at the final number of recovery or susceptible because you have no death in your model. So all the people that are infected eventually becomes recovery.
00:41:53.169 - 00:41:53.805, Speaker C: Right?
00:41:54.305 - 00:42:17.011, Speaker A: Yeah, that is another version of that. Yeah. Mentioned to this. Yeah. But I will. This is a good comment to simulate for Q and see how much is the maximum level or the cumulative number of infections for under different level of the risk perception. Okay, thank you.
00:42:17.011 - 00:43:04.525, Speaker A: So, in conclusion, our study in fact highlights the complex interplay between the policy and also the response to policies. So it means that the government should incorporate the response of the people into the policy. How the people respond and should be aware of that and consider as well when they set the policy and conduct them. Okay, so. But the. The most important part of this talk could be here and we can discuss this part. You know, basically, my idea is that the cancer treatment and also the containment policies have something in common.
00:43:04.525 - 00:44:04.435, Speaker A: It could be considered. My idea is that. And at least my question from you our group of researchers, that can we study this treatment and all the decision on treatment, because as you know, that the most of the treatment model assume that there is a treatment and they integrate the treatment in the model. And the study the treatment on the progression of the cancer tumor level. But how the treatment is decided, how the provider decide on the treatment. And also another and most important question is that do the pupil accept or reject? And how do they decide to accept and reject the treatment? My idea is that first of all the providers has a set of information. We can formulate the decision by the providers.
00:44:04.435 - 00:44:36.595, Speaker A: For example, in Markov decision process that they decide to conduct or to implement this treatment or not. Or a meat a combination of the treatment. As you know that in some type of cancer there are a mix of the treatments and that can be applied. And you have. You are more experienced than me. This is an idea that I wanted to share. And did you want to use?
00:44:37.055 - 00:45:02.285, Speaker B: I think that she was talking about like how much severe diseases, how much is the probability of death? Because cancer the probability of death increases. It is mostly the decision of the doctor that the patients follow through. Like the say of people in making a decision, I feel is very less because people Are not much informed and it's like high risk.
00:45:02.445 - 00:45:03.861, Speaker A: It's more severe.
00:45:04.013 - 00:45:05.741, Speaker B: So I feel the choice.
00:45:05.853 - 00:45:22.705, Speaker A: Exactly. The level of the information. The level of information set the decision by the provider. Okay. But on the other side, people decide to accept or reject. You mean that they have to accept it when it is so severe?
00:45:23.435 - 00:45:32.255, Speaker E: Much more different than respect to the COVID like rules that we have to follow. There was much more freedom in that sense.
00:45:33.075 - 00:45:33.539, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:45:33.587 - 00:45:41.603, Speaker E: When you have a cancer, it's less likely that you don't accept treatment that the doctor advised.
00:45:41.699 - 00:45:46.155, Speaker D: I mean, if they don't accept, it's just because you've gone through rounds of treatment and you're safe. I can't.
00:45:46.315 - 00:45:55.095, Speaker A: But you know what determines the decision of the people? How do the people decide on that it is sports or not.
00:45:56.595 - 00:45:57.499, Speaker E: When it's.
00:45:57.627 - 00:46:24.733, Speaker B: I mean, the thing is how here you can segregate the people based on high compliance or low compliance based on how people imitate each other versus the normal reaction in terms of cancer to decide that it is. What we are trying to say is people usually accept what the doctor says. The choice of.
00:46:24.829 - 00:46:26.485, Speaker A: Do they trust the doctors?
00:46:26.605 - 00:46:27.265, Speaker B: Yes.
00:46:28.205 - 00:46:33.877, Speaker A: How did you. Is there any investigation that shows that 100% people trust the doctors?
00:46:33.981 - 00:46:37.125, Speaker D: Some of them say no because they don't want to go through the treatment.
00:46:37.285 - 00:46:52.405, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. That is the. Anyway like they know, they accept, you know. Exactly, exactly. The people know that they will eventually die. But what is important is the maximum length of the survival. Okay.
00:46:52.485 - 00:47:05.285, Speaker D: But if I don't want to treatment myself, I decide that I know that I can increase my life of a year, but I don't want to live for a year. And they really have treatment. And so I decide, well, no, it's.
00:47:05.325 - 00:47:13.733, Speaker A: Not for a year. You know, the treatment is not one shot or one time the policy. Okay. People that are.
00:47:13.829 - 00:47:15.365, Speaker D: Know they have terminal cancer.
00:47:15.445 - 00:47:15.917, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:16.021 - 00:47:47.081, Speaker A: Just one more thing to ask you all of this. I just think that one thing that is very different apart from. So I mean, you know, it's different. I mean our reaction as the different versus because it's not contagious. You know, basically, when there is an improvement, for example, okay. When there is an improvement, the doctor informed the patient, isn't it so. And they will follow the.
00:47:47.081 - 00:47:54.605, Speaker A: The doctors. Okay. They will be more convenient to accept the treatment for the next step. Isn't Am I right or not?
00:47:54.945 - 00:48:11.199, Speaker D: Yeah, but I think I would look at that. I mean, I don't know. But my understanding this is important. There are like really few people that don't follow. Maybe one Thing that would be interested in is in terms of prevention. Yes, that's what I was going to say. Like in terms of modeling prevention and.
00:48:11.247 - 00:48:14.687, Speaker A: How like information change the behavior in.
00:48:14.711 - 00:48:20.103, Speaker C: Response to information about. About cancer regenes and stuff like this.
00:48:20.159 - 00:48:20.631, Speaker E: Yes.
00:48:20.743 - 00:48:35.969, Speaker D: Like once, once you know you have cancer, like there's not many way. Like no, we know that the recovery. There's no recovery. Basically you just have what they give you is a probability that you're going to respond to treatment, not a probability that you're going to survive. Like it's a probability that you're going.
00:48:35.977 - 00:48:46.137, Speaker B: To survive accept treatment survival is very less. Like if you look at the survival rates also it's not like very encouraging.
00:48:46.241 - 00:48:56.753, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like I think but in. In your way, in all of these dynamics, it's. It's a lot about prevention. Maybe like before like how much like.
00:48:56.809 - 00:49:18.449, Speaker A: Going the prevention is good idea but I mean the treatment. Because I. I assume that you know basically the providers at each level of the cancer. Okay. State of the cancer decide to use different treatment packages. Isn't.
00:49:18.617 - 00:49:21.401, Speaker D: Do you agree when you talk about.
00:49:21.473 - 00:49:35.719, Speaker C: Providers you probably also have to talk about healthcare systems because not in all healthcare systems is the provider's interest the best interest of the patient provider. If I'm a company, I have other interests in the patient.
00:49:35.807 - 00:50:01.919, Speaker A: Oh yeah, exactly. But we can assume that. We can assume there is objective function for the provider as well to maximize the survival period or to minimize the level of the tumor. This is the objective function that we can assume. And the provider if is problem or it means that to be honest not to seek the profit. I mean. Yeah, you are right.
00:50:01.919 - 00:50:08.247, Speaker A: We can consider this health system or the, the hospital health system that's completely.
00:50:08.311 - 00:50:15.479, Speaker C: Based on financial profit maximizing that you cannot, you cannot assume that they.
00:50:15.647 - 00:50:20.075, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly. These are the. The assumptions that we can discuss.
00:50:21.155 - 00:50:22.611, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:50:22.683 - 00:50:59.373, Speaker A: So one point is that regarding the providers we should assume that the health system or healthcare system not the individual companies or private companies that they. So the other is that you mentioned that the cancer is not contingent that you mean that either the providers and the people have no choice and they should be treated regardless of the level of the cancer.
00:50:59.509 - 00:51:38.249, Speaker D: I think like once if you start looking at treatment people do lots of modeling of treatment optimization to reduce side effects, reduce cost and it's. You know, that's been done and I'm not sure like the information that the patients have as much influence on their decision if not that you need to accept their decision and if I don't want to live Maximize my life. But I'm ready. I've already gone through lots of treatment and now I want to stop. It's just your decision. But I guess if you look at prevention then you have lots of misinformation transfer. You have lots.
00:51:38.249 - 00:52:03.101, Speaker D: And then you can like still optimize for like at the population scale which is the type of model that you do at a population level, you can look at cancer as an epidemic. You can see the prevention can affect the long term behavior which is in terms of also policy of the government in terms of spreading information about.
00:52:03.213 - 00:52:07.747, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. That's a great idea to work on the prevention. Yeah.
00:52:07.941 - 00:52:21.559, Speaker B: Searchable sir models. Have they. Have they been extended to cancer? Yes, they're not much because they're mostly used in infections. But there are like a few papers where.
00:52:21.607 - 00:52:22.235, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:24.095 - 00:52:25.223, Speaker B: Models in cancer.
00:52:25.279 - 00:52:35.953, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I reviewed the literature. There is not too much papers about the epidemiologic approach to the cancer.
00:52:36.079 - 00:52:39.509, Speaker D: But I guess when they do that. Yeah.
00:52:39.597 - 00:52:46.933, Speaker A: Why? Oh no infectious. I mean there are some cases in.
00:52:46.949 - 00:52:48.357, Speaker D: Which I think they.
00:52:48.501 - 00:52:53.105, Speaker A: Because it's infectious. It's transmutable. Transmitted to other people.
00:52:54.725 - 00:52:59.805, Speaker D: Yeah, there's some cancer that are associated with infection.
00:52:59.925 - 00:53:01.397, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, there are some.
00:53:01.501 - 00:53:02.045, Speaker D: But like.
00:53:02.125 - 00:53:02.437, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:02.501 - 00:53:07.005, Speaker D: At the population scale prevention and like people talk about this.
00:53:07.125 - 00:53:09.181, Speaker C: I would agree with that. Behavioral changes.
00:53:09.253 - 00:53:13.821, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. And the government change my lifestyle based.
00:53:13.853 - 00:53:16.117, Speaker A: On information that I have based on.
00:53:16.141 - 00:53:17.445, Speaker C: Policy that might support this.
00:53:17.525 - 00:53:26.605, Speaker A: Yeah. So we can consider those type of cancer that are infectious like the. That relate to the sexual relations and.
00:53:26.645 - 00:53:29.287, Speaker D: Those just like a ovarian cancer.
00:53:29.351 - 00:53:29.887, Speaker A: Hp.
00:53:29.991 - 00:53:31.195, Speaker D: We have a vaccine.
00:53:31.495 - 00:53:32.983, Speaker B: People have been looking at it.
00:53:33.039 - 00:53:42.315, Speaker A: But do the people accept the vaccine? How the people respond to the vaccine. This is the same that the people. Yeah, but the response of people.
00:53:43.415 - 00:53:54.933, Speaker E: I mean if you. If you're modeling the prevention and that is. Makes sense. But then for any type of virus or cancer, it doesn't have to be a cancer that can be.
00:53:55.029 - 00:54:20.475, Speaker A: Yeah, that was one topic that we can work on prevention and how does it work and how we can take into account the behavior, the policy, the information and publication of the information. So that's generally. But since it's not infectious disease, we should reconsider or reformulate it. How can we. We can say the level of the cancer.
00:54:20.565 - 00:54:21.287, Speaker C: Yes.
00:54:21.471 - 00:54:31.383, Speaker A: Not. Yeah, progression. Progression. Yeah. In the society. So then we can integrate the behavior and the policy. Yeah, exactly.
00:54:31.383 - 00:54:44.435, Speaker A: Thank you for this point. The next is that we can focus on those type of cancer that are somehow infectious. In that case, your comment is that the vaccine.
00:54:45.015 - 00:55:04.275, Speaker D: I mean the only One I know but there might be others is hpv. But then you have to model the actual A virus. Okay and then that there's like also the probability. But that's why so but the effectiveness.
00:55:04.315 - 00:55:09.435, Speaker A: Of the vaccines are important and the perception of the risk that type of.
00:55:09.475 - 00:55:20.413, Speaker E: Cancer that you can get from an infection then the vaccine is a matter of preventing it. It's anime that you can cure it with vaccine after you get it. So yeah comes back to the like.
00:55:20.549 - 00:55:37.981, Speaker A: Exactly. It's the same that vaccine in the. You know the vaccine response of the people to vaccine in the co was the same because the people misunderstood somehow that some of them that that was misinformation that if you vaccinated you will. You will not be infected. But you. You. You know.
00:55:37.981 - 00:55:39.465, Speaker A: But it means that.
00:55:41.455 - 00:55:55.035, Speaker D: Like. Like you might like it's not just about being infected. It's like in order to develop cancer long term like the level of like it just. It reduces a long way that you're probably developing cancer not to get infected.
00:55:55.735 - 00:55:59.959, Speaker E: Certain point about infection based the cancer that can come from the infection that is prevented.
00:56:00.047 - 00:56:02.679, Speaker A: Okay so three points we.
00:56:02.847 - 00:56:03.703, Speaker E: I guess they're like.
00:56:03.719 - 00:56:06.235, Speaker B: There are no cancer which is contagious.
00:56:11.235 - 00:56:19.203, Speaker A: You mean that they can. Yeah, if someone infected and transmit to others. So why not you can.
00:56:19.259 - 00:56:23.495, Speaker E: You cannot get a cancer by an infection from another person.
00:56:24.075 - 00:56:38.055, Speaker A: No no, no. But there are the. The vector born. You mean that it's. Yeah, the virus is. Is transmitted to others and it could be resolved in the cancer long term. Yeah it's like a vector born disease.
00:56:38.055 - 00:56:42.395, Speaker A: But is not. You know that.
00:56:43.255 - 00:57:03.057, Speaker E: Oh I mean it can come. I mean you can. You can develop some type of cancer if you have a certain infection. But there's like also. So there's probability of getting infected and then if you get that infection you could increase the probability of having certain type of cancer. But doesn't come as an infected eyes as a vector disease. There's no way.
00:57:03.161 - 00:57:07.041, Speaker A: No, I mean that like. No no no.
00:57:07.073 - 00:57:17.241, Speaker D: Most of the time in this case like most of the sexual part don't develop cancer themselves. It's like is like delayed of years.
00:57:17.313 - 00:57:32.805, Speaker A: And years like can be transmitted to other sexual. I mean the virus that can be transmitted and result in cancer can so exactly. I mean that it's by vector word. I mean that like that there is.
00:57:34.425 - 00:57:42.633, Speaker B: Possibility of developing is not that high. That's what she. The virus can be transmitted but.
00:57:42.769 - 00:57:50.177, Speaker A: But the probability is not be to be considered. You mean that because it's a low probability to transmit it from the Sexual.
00:57:50.241 - 00:57:59.377, Speaker D: Interesting because it gets so like later on. It's not that you get the back like it's not like coffee that you get this. It's not the response to the virus that drives the cancer.
00:57:59.441 - 00:58:01.121, Speaker B: It's lots of things.
00:58:01.233 - 00:58:04.857, Speaker A: Okay. So the most important enzymes are still.
00:58:04.921 - 00:58:06.345, Speaker D: Develop in the treatment side.
00:58:06.425 - 00:58:43.655, Speaker A: Okay. So we can consider the prevention and model the prevention and the pro. Progression of the cancer in the society like the. In that framework. And then we can consider the government policy regarding the information publication and the response of the people to accept a lifestyle or something like that. Because also there are some studies that there are a positive correlation between the life asylum the probability of the cancer. So that's the.
00:58:46.125 - 00:58:49.265, Speaker B: How obesity is related.
00:58:51.485 - 00:58:54.225, Speaker D: How much sport you do everything.
00:58:56.645 - 00:59:02.485, Speaker C: You can model the stress response once a provider tells you the bad news.
00:59:02.645 - 00:59:06.621, Speaker A: Yeah. The stress determines the level of the. Exactly.
00:59:06.813 - 00:59:09.861, Speaker C: Yeah. Stress.
00:59:10.053 - 00:59:24.311, Speaker A: That was the next step that I I wanted to explain that how stress can determine the level of the risk person perception. And the risk perception is a driving factor in the response to the treatment as well.
00:59:24.503 - 00:59:29.795, Speaker D: I think like if you think about stress and stress affected treatment.
00:59:30.215 - 00:59:33.367, Speaker A: No, no, no, no. The stress means that how the people.
00:59:33.431 - 00:59:38.367, Speaker D: Are stressful that will influence like responsible treatment.
00:59:38.511 - 00:59:39.055, Speaker A: Yeah, it's.
00:59:39.095 - 00:59:46.255, Speaker D: It's not going to influence like whether you take the treatment or not. Influence directly the biology. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:59:46.375 - 00:59:49.471, Speaker A: But the response to the treatment is in.
00:59:49.583 - 01:00:07.335, Speaker C: But this is a different situation where it's a stress source that is major. Once a person gets a bad news, regardless whether they go with a doctor or not, they're still stressed out.
01:00:07.415 - 01:00:11.245, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's a different type of modeling.
01:00:12.105 - 01:00:36.405, Speaker C: It's different from here because this kind of modeling is as you say, it's population. And you can put a huge question mark on the conclusions of this guy. Although it was perpetuated locally here during COVID Yeah. There's some good reason because there was a big one.
01:00:38.115 - 01:00:38.611, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
01:00:38.643 - 01:00:43.251, Speaker D: It makes sense when you speak. That's why I said immunology level.
01:00:43.323 - 01:01:17.915, Speaker A: No, no. But my idea. My idea was not to use the SIR model at this level. I wanted to use the. The progression cancer and treatment model. And as you mentioned that the treatment is modeled how the treatment is decided. But to optimize, for example, my idea was to apply Markov decision process to in fact model the decision on the treatment and also the response of the people to the treatment.
01:01:22.775 - 01:01:24.719, Speaker C: It's a nice modeling tool.
01:01:24.847 - 01:01:28.525, Speaker A: Yeah. MDP can be for the treatment there.
01:01:29.785 - 01:01:33.125, Speaker C: How Really I have to believe.
01:01:34.905 - 01:01:37.165, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Thank you for your Comments.
01:01:40.305 - 01:02:03.889, Speaker D: I guess something that would be really interesting if you can introduce also the economical side. So policy making economical side and then like trying to build something that is. Is giving the the government something to say like oh yeah, this is a good policy to do. It's going to be expensive to invest in prevention but it's going to have a huge impact on.
01:02:03.977 - 01:02:13.785, Speaker A: And also the from the point of economics, you know the, the people response to accept or to reject depends on how much does it cost them.
01:02:13.905 - 01:02:21.015, Speaker D: But that's just in the US and it's still like as. I don't think. I'm not talking about treatment, I'm talking about prevention. I don't.
01:02:21.055 - 01:02:21.911, Speaker A: Yeah, you're right.
01:02:22.023 - 01:02:25.895, Speaker D: Like if you can't afford it, you just can't afford it. But then it's not like.
01:02:26.055 - 01:02:29.663, Speaker A: No, I mean the cost benefit analysis that we have here doctor Is going.
01:02:29.679 - 01:02:33.623, Speaker D: To give you the best that they can even a certain point I think.
01:02:33.719 - 01:02:34.047, Speaker A: Right.
01:02:34.111 - 01:02:34.423, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:02:34.479 - 01:02:46.333, Speaker B: Without being like outside India. Do you guys have a concept of generic medicine? Like so there are founder companies who.
01:02:46.479 - 01:02:49.445, Speaker D: Oh yeah, it's cheaper. The generic is cheaper.
01:02:49.865 - 01:03:43.775, Speaker B: You can actually model this people's behavior like the response towards choosing a generic medicine over a prescribed drug. Yeah. They exist for certain treatments of cancer. But the thing is even with genetic medicines are available people tend to choose medicine which have the similar composition as by big pharma companies. People should some people they make the decision to go for the big names or big brand companies and not choose generic medicine just because they feel you know, just because it's cheaper it might not work. So those sort of modeling could like it's treatment but like the choice between which ends the same composition. I don't know if like it makes sense or not, but something that it makes.
01:03:43.775 - 01:03:49.443, Speaker B: So if you want to choose if.
01:03:49.459 - 01:03:50.411, Speaker A: You get a prescription.
01:03:50.443 - 01:03:57.135, Speaker B: I mean if you get a prescription you go to the generic medicine. Yeah, you get. You go to the generic.
01:03:59.275 - 01:04:04.455, Speaker A: So also the prescription depends on the. The. The state of the cancer is it.
01:04:04.795 - 01:04:08.935, Speaker D: That depends whether your cancer as drug which has been.
01:04:09.275 - 01:04:10.495, Speaker E: Which is not about.
01:04:12.635 - 01:04:13.415, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:17.795 - 01:04:20.003, Speaker B: That'S something that just hit me. Could be just.
01:04:20.139 - 01:05:17.905, Speaker A: But if we assume that the whole period that the treatment could be not only the, you know the. I mean the aggressive treatments from the medicines too aggressive. There is a wide range of the treatments if we consider them and then can we assume that it could be a state contingent. That depends on the level of the cancer and how there may be some providers. I mean the doctors they prescribe aggressive intervention at the beginning to Prevent any progress. But they said some of them post postponed it in and say, okay, let's try this medicine and then wait for a while and then we will try the aggressive intervention. What's your idea about this? Can we, this is.
01:05:17.905 - 01:05:41.611, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I mean that what, how the doctors decide. Because it depends on the state. Yeah, exactly. You know, there is one point that everything depends on the state of the cancer. So the set of information is important. So if we assume that we have a horizon of time.
01:05:41.611 - 01:06:03.905, Speaker A: Okay, then within this. Yeah, exactly, exactly. I mean I, I mentioned that the treatment is not one time and one shot action. It's dynamic. And so I want your model to. I wanted to model that how the provider decides first. Okay.
01:06:03.905 - 01:06:35.925, Speaker A: The behavior of the provider is important. No, no, it is that actually they what can we model it? You know, all modeling, you know, you know, when you for example, you, you know the question, for example, you see that the prices go up. Okay. When there is an increase in demand in market. Okay. So but you see, you observe that the, the prices have gone up. Okay, but how do you explain that? What is behind it? So the utilitarian comes to modeling that.
01:06:37.505 - 01:06:46.001, Speaker E: You want to then ask yourself why is happening? Why is this happening? So what's it, what's the, what did the problem you want to address?
01:06:46.073 - 01:07:04.491, Speaker A: So what is, you know, basically the decision. I, I, I mean that from the behavioral point of view, the decision on any treatment is not mechanical. I think that this is a human decision and there should be a mechanism to explain how the providers even decide.
01:07:04.563 - 01:07:08.371, Speaker D: But there are, there's already standard of care. There is like, there are like set.
01:07:08.443 - 01:07:20.139, Speaker A: Policies, but the policies. How, how do you decide on the set of policies? Is there any variation?
01:07:20.307 - 01:07:21.095, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:07:24.445 - 01:07:35.229, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for coming. Okay, thank you everybody.
01:07:35.397 - 01:07:58.995, Speaker E: I was just saying for cancer doctor, doctor can, can just do whatever he feels is better. So they stand there to follow at each stage. Like dimension, certain level, I don't know, depending on the cancer, certain type of blood test they have to do, certain range they have to be into to decide which type of treatment they can use or not. So it's not really like.
01:08:00.975 - 01:08:23.717, Speaker A: But it is a decision at the end of the moment is a decision, you know, a standard. Everything is standardized. You know, even in the economy, you know, there is a set of policies available to the government, but the government decides and they are economists here. The government policies, the measures, the measures that government in epidemiology can. Okay, thank you for coming.
01:08:23.821 - 01:08:25.205, Speaker B: Should we close the online thing?
