00:00:00.680 - 00:00:00.768, Speaker A: Or.
00:00:00.768 - 00:00:24.114, Speaker B: Good afternoon, does everyone know where the functor is? That the yes or no? Okay, good. And now.
00:00:26.794 - 00:00:27.574, Speaker A: Oh.
00:00:36.154 - 00:01:27.124, Speaker B: Okay, we're gonna get a camera. Okay, but for the blackboard. Good morning. We have to lose. Okay, so I didn't invent functions, right? And by the way, one of the mysteries about categories is that they're not set, okay? But they might as well be. I mean, for practical purposes, we could restrict to a subset, if you like, of the, of the. Of the class, which is the category, makes up the category.
00:01:27.124 - 00:02:08.984, Speaker B: But then we don't really have to. We don't really have to. But if you do, if you, if you think of a category as a, as a set, then you have maps between the objects, and the objects are just points in the general vote, or points. And then the arrows, every arrow goes between two points. And you can compose two arrows. If the point, if the head of the first point, at the head of the first one coincides with the point at the tail of the second one, then you have a socitivity. So it's a bit like a semigroup, if it were.
00:02:08.984 - 00:03:13.488, Speaker B: By the way, there's something which generalizes the notion of group, semi group or group, it's called a groupoid. We won't be talking especially about groupoids, but the definition of a groupoid is quite simple. It's a category which is a set, okay? And furthermore, periphery arrow, there's an arrow going in the opposite direction, which is. Deserves to be called the inverse. If you go forwards and backwards, you get the identity arrow. Objects, they can be identified with identity arrow, I mean arrows which are equal to their square and one. If you have any arrow, then there's an identity arrow which acts on the left on that, that's the identity.
00:03:13.488 - 00:04:01.894, Speaker B: And then there's another arrow that acts on the right, on the photo main side, that's the identity. Okay, but so if you go forwards and backwards and get the identity, and you go backwards and forwards and get the identity, those such arrows, always, such inverse arrows always exist. Then it's called a groupoid. And it's quite important to look at some maps. Well, in that case, it's a map that's just called, it's just called a homomorphism, preserves the product operation. And general, if you have a map between two categories, if it. If it's a functor, that just means that just the same as saying it's a homomorphism, preserved products.
00:04:01.894 - 00:04:54.792, Speaker B: Okay, so you have two arrows in the given categories, then in the domain category, and then you look at the. Then you look at the image of the tooth, images of the two arrows in the second category. Well, then, if the first arrow goes into the first arrow, the second arrow goes into the second arrow. Then if the first two arrows are composable, if they match, then it should be true for the images. Okay, then the product, the product goes into the product. I guess that's not too much of a stretch of the imagination to call a homomorphism, right?
00:04:54.888 - 00:04:55.644, Speaker A: Okay.
00:04:57.104 - 00:05:57.164, Speaker B: And maybe the only reason it's not called a homomorphism is that it's not assumed that the category is a set. But that's, in our case, we might as well, we can always reduced to the case that it's a set. Look at this suitable subject. Okay, and so, but this is standard, what you might call naive category theory. But it's very helpful because I would, I like to build on top of it, the notion that I called the classification category. Sorry, well, the classifying category and a classification function. Okay, so what do you suppose a classification functor is? Anyone want to throw their hat in the ring? Yes, remind me of your name, please.
00:05:58.624 - 00:05:59.484, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:05:59.984 - 00:07:16.068, Speaker B: Yeah, Vincent, and what's the, okay, so roughly speaking, pretty well, pretty accurately, a functor is a homomorphism between the two categories. And what makes it a classification function, by the way, let me just review. If you have a homomorphism between two categories, it makes sense for an arrow upstairs to be an isomorphism, right? If you have an arrow, we discussed that something going backwards and forwards, and you get forwards and backwards, and you get the identities either in, and that's defined to be an isomorphism. Okay, well, a functor will take, any functor will take identity maps into identity maps, that's part of it. And then it'll take an isomorphism into an isomorphism, right? Forwards map will go into a forward map, backwards to back. And so isomorphisms go into isomorphism, so isomorphic. If you have isomorphic objects upstairs, then the images downstairs will be isomorphic.
00:07:16.116 - 00:07:16.704, Speaker A: Right?
00:07:17.684 - 00:08:06.694, Speaker B: Okay, so what's, Vincent, what, what's the classification category? And then it's a classification function. I call it the classifying. So this would be the, if this is a classification function, then this would be the classifying category. Okay, you're being very special, okay, I'm not talking about algebra, I'm just talking about abstract category. But you've got the right idea. An example of a class, in fact, a good answer to the question, what's an example of a classification function? But we just, Vincent just said what an example was, I think, Elon.
00:08:09.594 - 00:08:09.906, Speaker A: So.
00:08:09.930 - 00:08:22.650, Speaker B: What'S an example of. Just speaking roughly, what's an example of a classification functor? And what was Vincent suggested? Sort of slipped out. We weren't talking about algebra. We weren't talking about sister algebras.
00:08:22.682 - 00:08:23.282, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:23.458 - 00:08:47.634, Speaker B: But he said something. What did he say, Justin? Yeah, yeah, the word k zero slipped out. Right. Well, this is very good, because that's exactly what I'm talking about. Okay, that's an example. In a certain context, yes. Charlie, if you have a commutative algebra, then the top of the spectrum would be a.
00:08:47.634 - 00:09:16.720, Speaker B: Would be a classification function. Is that what you said? No, because, well, for very special classes of topological space. Very special classes. But that's a good example that if it's special enough that it determines the space, then going. If it. And if it is a function going from the. They have to check it's a function.
00:09:16.752 - 00:09:17.280, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:17.432 - 00:09:51.426, Speaker B: But I suppose maybe it is. Okay, so, yeah, so, very special basis. Yes. And please remind me of your name. Okay, well, we were just corresponding. Yeah, good. But what were you going to say? Well, that's a bit of a mouthful, roughly speaking.
00:09:51.426 - 00:10:15.894, Speaker B: If you have this category on the left, which you want to classify, and if it's true that this is a classification function, then this is called the classifying category. But we have to elucidate, we have to get it straight, what it means to be, um. To be, um. Uh, classification. Classification function. But, um. Uh.
00:10:15.894 - 00:10:30.954, Speaker B: Vincent, were you going to finish what you were saying? Would you? Anyway, you, you made a big contribution by saying in a certain context, k zero is a. Is a classification functor. And what one context is uHF algebra.
00:10:31.374 - 00:10:32.038, Speaker A: Okay?
00:10:32.126 - 00:11:10.422, Speaker B: And even, uh, what I call, what you should call, what I started to call stabilized uHF algebra last time when you tensor it with the compact operator. Now that's a sister algebra construction. You want to look at just the algebra construction, because for UHF algebra, we're not bothering about. We don't need to bother about the CSPA algebra structure. But then this tensioning with the compacts can be done in a purely algebraic way, in terms of matrices. So, um, you take any algebra and you have finite matrices over the algebra, okay? But if it's infinite matrices, pose. It's infinite matrices.
00:11:10.422 - 00:12:35.164, Speaker B: And you just look at the union of all the finite, you just look at all the finite matrices sitting in the upper left hand corner with zero everywhere else, okay? You can call it the free flowing. Just the. It's just the algebra itself is sitting freely in all the, all the entries of the matrix of the infinite matrix, except that only finitely many are non zero at a given time. But then you can multiply those, add them and multiply them in the, just like finite matrices. And that's called the stabilized algorithm, okay? And for the stabilized uhf algebras, so, so for the, um, so last time I let the cat out of the bag. The map to the supernatural number is if you look at the corresponding subgroup with rational numbers containing the number one, then, um, then that's the k zero group, and then identified in such a way that the number one is the class of the, uh, of the unit, or it's the class of the canonical thing, regenerated free module, the algebra itself. So in the unit, okay, so that's the invariant.
00:12:35.164 - 00:13:18.314, Speaker B: And in the case where you just have the free floating matrices, infinite matrices, there's no unit, okay? There's no unit because you don't, you can't keep track of the entries. You just got the algebra of matrices, but you still have the k zero group, and that will be isomorphic to what it is for the algebra you started with. Okay, that's an exercise. Just look at this algebra event. Of the entries in the upper left, very simple, upper, upper left hand corner, the k zero group of that would be the same as the k zero group of the whole thing. But now the class of the unit, you have to keep track of that anymore. You just have a group.
00:13:18.314 - 00:14:02.018, Speaker B: Well, that's for these stabilized UHF algebra, the infinite free floating algebra with entries in the UHF algebra. The k zero group is a classification function. Still, okay, but now you can't say equals for two values. For two of the groups, you can't say equals because they're just abstract groups. You can say they're isomorphic. Now for the unit of UHF algebra, you can talk about the abstract group with the special element, but then that's just the subgroup of the q containing the number one. And if two of those things and the two of those things are isomorphic in a way preserving the number one, then they're equal.
00:14:02.018 - 00:15:10.516, Speaker B: Okay, so that's, but in both cases you get the classification function for the UHF algebras, for the UHF, and then for the free floating one based on UHF. And so let's, let's formulate carefully what it means in terms of the, of the, of the diagrams, of the schematic diagrams. So any functor takes isomorphism upstairs, takes the isomorphism to an isomorphism. Okay, but what do we require? What do we actually require in addition to call it the special kind of function, classification puncture. Charlie, were you going to say something about that? Well, I can't quite. They're sort of unique. Anyway, this is a map, right? If these are sets, then this is just a function.
00:15:10.620 - 00:15:11.428, Speaker A: Okay?
00:15:11.596 - 00:15:33.624, Speaker B: And so every object here goes to an object here, and every map goes to a map between the appropriate objects. That's what a function does. So I didn't quite catch what you were saying. You want to come in? I mean, it's a. You know, there's a difference between. If you. If you say something that's.
00:15:33.624 - 00:15:42.280, Speaker B: Which is half right, it's hard to tell whether it's 90% right, actually or only 40% right.
00:15:42.312 - 00:15:42.984, Speaker A: Okay.
00:15:43.144 - 00:15:48.312, Speaker B: And I think that you're. I'll give you. I'll give you the optimistic interpretation.
00:15:48.368 - 00:15:49.774, Speaker A: Okay. Sorry.
00:15:49.944 - 00:16:13.534, Speaker B: In fact. Yeah, but. No, of course. We're just. We're just talking. But do you want to come and follow up on what you said? Well, okay, but remember, we're interested in when two objects upstairs are isomorphic, right? And if. Certainly for any functor, if they're isomorphic upstairs, they're isomorphic downstairs.
00:16:13.534 - 00:16:21.524, Speaker B: Yes. I think you're. I can see the light bulb. Even if it's banned? Even if it's banned.
00:16:22.704 - 00:16:24.004, Speaker A: Isomorphic.
00:16:25.144 - 00:16:59.316, Speaker B: Okay, but don't always avoid contrapositive. Say something in a direct way. If they are isomorphic downstairs, then. Then what? Okay, Rishi, I know you know it, because we might have talked. We might have touched on it in the past when you were doing the special. What was it called? Anyway? It was. It was a summer.
00:16:59.316 - 00:17:23.512, Speaker B: It was during the summer, right? A year ago. And it was. No, but anyway, we talked about all kinds of things, but, yes, now I forgot, all right? That's what's automatic.
00:17:23.568 - 00:17:24.324, Speaker A: Okay?
00:17:24.664 - 00:17:37.124, Speaker B: But now I was too brittle. I mean, I jumped on Charlie when he was going to say the correct thing, and I just said, you should say it the opposite way.
00:17:37.864 - 00:17:38.696, Speaker A: Okay?
00:17:38.840 - 00:18:02.720, Speaker B: Which is instead of saying, so p. What? Well, all right, well, that's kind of cheating. Okay? I mean, what I was hoping you'd say is just suppose that they are isomorphic and separate out the two implications. Like, that's the clearest way.
00:18:02.752 - 00:18:03.472, Speaker A: Okay.
00:18:03.648 - 00:18:21.576, Speaker B: Um. Well, I mean. So. Well, I'm just being silly, but if you. So what you're coming down on is if they're. If they're isomorphic, the two objects upstairs without. Without any map between the priori, if they're.
00:18:21.576 - 00:18:43.526, Speaker B: If they're object. If they're isomorphic downstairs, then in fact they are. There's some isomorphism upstairs. So we don't even require that this. The isomorphism is supposed to give you this isomorphism by the functor. Okay, if that happens, and that's usually what you prove. When you prove it, that's usually what you prove.
00:18:43.526 - 00:19:37.040, Speaker B: And then you could call it a strong classification something. And that's, but the idea, and it's slightly tricky because we're just saying isomorphic upstairs and they're isomorphic downstairs. Well, you were going to say if and only if, but I think it's better to separate. It's clearer to separate because one is completely automatic and the other is highly special. And I'd like to get credit for calling it a classification function because if it's UHF, then the unitil UHF, then you don't really have to use that language, okay, because it's just the, it's the, like, it's the range of the trace, normal, unique, normalized trace on idempotent. That's a bunch of numbers between zero and one, rational numbers. And you look at the, where that's the intersection of a group of rational numbers.
00:19:37.040 - 00:20:17.314, Speaker B: That's the integral zero one, which is the k zero group. But it's just a computation. You're not talking about anything being isomorphic. Don't say two groups of rational numbers containing the number one, two subgroups of two which contain the integers. It's not important that they're isomorphic. What's important is they're equal. But, but in the, well, if you tend, if you go past from the UHF to the free floating algebra, the free floating matrix algebra, then the.
00:20:19.414 - 00:20:19.702, Speaker A: You.
00:20:19.718 - 00:21:52.114, Speaker B: Can, you can say that you're, you still have the k zero functor and you can say that you compute it by just looking at the upper left hand corner, because that is an isomorphism. But it's, it's not an actual isomorphism. You're not, you don't really, you don't, you don't, you don't, you're not entitled to keep track of this except for computational purposes. But when you're finished, you just have a concrete group which is isomorphic to the, and so the best you can say, if you have two UHF algebras which are stabilized and you look at the corresponding k zero groups, the most you can say is, are they isomorphic, not equal. And if they're isomorphic, and it's true, dixme was able to prove, this is a good exercise. Okay, this is a, this is today one of today's exercises. Prove zero is a classification function or the free floating matrix algebra over UHF algebra.
00:21:52.114 - 00:23:03.344, Speaker B: By the UHF algebra I mean the algebraic infinite algebraic tensor product. Okay? So that's a very good exercise. Of course, it's taking for granted that in the unital case where you take the, where you take the, you want to know that the, you have the k zero and then the class of the unit. And this is a subgroup. It's a subgroup of, containing the integers. It's in a very natural way. It's a subgroup, actually a subgroup of irrational numbers, okay? And this should be a function with regard to homomorphisms, unit of homomorphisms here.
00:23:03.344 - 00:23:09.452, Speaker B: And what is it? Well, it captures the supernatural numbers.
00:23:09.548 - 00:23:10.504, Speaker A: Okay? So.
00:23:12.924 - 00:24:53.406, Speaker B: I'll write my own little essay on an email outlining what the, this essay project is, okay? I think it's a very good essay project to work with the unit of UHF algebra, defined as the algebraic infinite tensor products, or finite or infinite tensor products, the matrix algebra. And then that you get, if you, if you recall the supernatural number, you get by looking at the abstract, you look at the abstract algebra and you can recover the supernatural number, okay, either as k zero with the unit keeping track of the unit, or as just the trace values of the normalized trace, unique, normalized trace on item, and then the free, in the free floating case, you don't get a concrete proof unless you start with the particular, with the matrix, represent the matrix description, but you're not really allowed to classifying the algebra. But that'll give you one way of computing the k zero group. But you have to remember that that's not natural. You're only computing what the k zero group is, what's natural. But that's not concrete. You're giving a concrete description of the K zero group.
00:24:53.406 - 00:25:42.354, Speaker B: It's isomorphic. K zero group is isomorphic to the group that you get from the unit. Okay, so you started with, involves the choice of unit, which is when you don't apriori, if you're just given the free floating algebra, you don't know whether to choose the unit for this algebra or further two by two out, which would be, would have twice the, it would be the number two rather than. Okay, well, that's, maybe I, we don't want to jump up and down on something so much that it squashes it. Right. So, so I think there's a given sitting, you should just look at something so much. Have we looked at this enough? For the time being.
00:25:42.354 - 00:26:25.404, Speaker B: But anyway, I would really suggest this. I mean, we're not assigning either homework or, I mean, either exercises or essays, but it was recommended, the homework and things I'm suggesting in class recommended too. Well, this is, this is a. It's one exercise which could be a homework, or it could be part of a more all encompassing essay. All right, but that's the UHF algebra. Any, um. Any questions? Well, that's.
00:26:25.404 - 00:26:51.708, Speaker B: I always laugh a bit. Talk, like, talk a little bit when someone says, are there any questions? Because if someone has to ask the fair question, then there are probably questions. But that doesn't mean they're going to get them. Yes. Yourself. I mean, what is the k zero group of a few?
00:26:51.756 - 00:26:52.944, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:26:55.054 - 00:27:46.848, Speaker B: Well, yeah, but look, the reason that's a bit funny answer is if you. The k zero group is a group, right? If we talk about a field, then there are two groups, lots of two groups. You have to have to say which one. Look, it's always the same for every field, okay? But that's one thing that's notable. If you look at k zero of the field, it's always the same. It's a certain group and it's always the same. Look, it just happens that k zero of a field is a ring.
00:27:46.848 - 00:27:50.604, Speaker B: So you could take k zero of that. But I would say that, that.
00:27:52.664 - 00:27:52.952, Speaker A: In.
00:27:52.968 - 00:28:28.208, Speaker B: Fact, if you look at the ring that you get from, in natural way, from k zero of a field. I'm talking in circles now, but don't. But I think it makes sense. And Jared is making sense, too, except the question is a bit too. I'm not sure if it's the question he means to ask. But anyway, if you look at k zero over field, it happens that in a natural way, it's a ring, okay? And with unit. And if you take the k zero group of that ring, it turns out that you get, the group that you get is the additive group of that ring.
00:28:28.208 - 00:28:34.816, Speaker B: That's happening. But that's already true for the given field. If you look at the. Well, no, it's not.
00:28:34.840 - 00:28:35.604, Speaker A: It's not.
00:28:36.384 - 00:29:00.660, Speaker B: The given field has two groups. It has the group, it has the additive group, and then it has the multiplicative group of nonzero elements. But in fact, neither of those is the right group, as it happens. Don't worry. So just think about it. But also think of. Think of ordinary linear algebra.
00:29:00.660 - 00:29:29.284, Speaker B: What? And the definition of k zero, where you have finitely generated the module. Sorry. Well, okay, but, yeah, but then, now, you know, I say now you're remembering what we've discussed, and that's so it's always the same semi group, and so you're always going to get the same group.
00:29:29.584 - 00:29:31.272, Speaker A: Right? Okay?
00:29:31.448 - 00:29:45.064, Speaker B: And one exercise was to go backwards. If you know that the, you know that the k zero group of a field is the. Is what it is, just as a group.
00:29:45.404 - 00:29:45.740, Speaker A: Good.
00:29:45.772 - 00:30:01.136, Speaker B: About the semi group, then, can you deduce what the semi group must be, which is the same as proving linear basic facts of linear algebra dimension exists? Pretty elementary then? Yes. Everyone.
00:30:01.280 - 00:30:08.124, Speaker A: I think I was like. I was defined.
00:30:10.384 - 00:30:34.604, Speaker B: Yes, but. Yeah, well, sure, but once you do that, you don't. You don't, and then you pass to the group. Once you have the semi group, you can pass to the group. But suppose you. Then you throw away the semi group and you're just left with the group, then can you. The question is, can you recover the semigroup? No, as it happens, there's only one.
00:30:34.604 - 00:30:43.904, Speaker B: If you keep in. If you keep in track of very elementary properties of the semi group that you follow from their trivial facts in linear algebra.
00:30:46.804 - 00:30:47.584, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:30:50.524 - 00:31:10.112, Speaker B: I can't quite follow, like, all the easily. Well, look, when we say the k one group is z, we just mean. Sorry. When we say the k zero group is that we just mean it's isomorphic to z. Okay, good question.
00:31:10.168 - 00:31:10.764, Speaker A: But.
00:31:13.304 - 00:31:30.376, Speaker B: Then the. So the exercise is this, and it's not that difficult. You have to remember trivial facts from linear algebra. And then you end up. If you can prove that the semigroup is the isomorphic to the positive integer, then that's the deep fact about linear algebra.
00:31:30.400 - 00:31:31.040, Speaker A: Okay?
00:31:31.192 - 00:32:12.964, Speaker B: You get that every dimension is well defined. Okay, so that's the exercise. But it's only a question of up to isomorphism. Good. But that's good track of possible confusion. You know, half the time, half the time, getting held up by something, an exercise or something, is just not doing all the chores ahead of time, expressing things, reviewing the expression of things, how things should be expressed in a clear way. Removing the underbrush, if you like.
00:32:12.964 - 00:32:32.314, Speaker B: Yes, Darren, look, there was a guy, the late rattlesnake, who was blind. And whenever someone said what you just said, he said, what are you pointing at? And I was looking in the opposite direction.
00:32:32.354 - 00:32:32.934, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:35.314 - 00:33:16.724, Speaker B: Look, we're not. Don't stand on ceremony, but we should have. What I'm trying to say is clarity. Okay, so what are you concerned about? Okay, look, this is. I keep asking people to ask questions, okay, greatest questions, but sometimes maybe we could have a break with. Can we have a break without questions for a little while? Okay, any questions?
00:33:18.784 - 00:33:19.684, Speaker A: Okay.
00:33:22.184 - 00:33:33.684, Speaker B: But. But by the way, I'm always free to be. I don't know how today is Friday. No, it's not. It is. It is. Yeah, today's Friday.
00:33:33.684 - 00:33:36.128, Speaker B: You can see I'm not a TGIf.
00:33:36.216 - 00:33:36.844, Speaker A: Person.
00:33:39.224 - 00:34:21.864, Speaker B: Maybe I'm tgim, how about that? But there is a tutorial and I'm sure that any question that I don't rise to I think Mister Lau might be a little more sympathetic to have a little more time for because after all he will have fewer people fewer people will fit in that room than will fit in this room but doesn't have to be since it doesn't have to be the same it probably isn't the same people every week everyone should think about pretending for a while.
00:34:24.364 - 00:34:24.652, Speaker A: I.
00:34:24.668 - 00:36:59.794, Speaker B: Remember when I was the organizer of a fields institute program 30 years ago in Waterloo one of the early programs in the field institute it was at Waterloo for a year we had a very successful, we were very successful in getting visitors okay, and even in spite of this as much, almost as much difficulty then getting visitors as now or financing people so it was a slightly smaller place than here but the director, John Chatham now at University of Pittsburgh chairman of the department he once, much later when I was talking with him he said I was always very happy to, to approve your visitors to see them come to a field institute program even if they had to lean out the window for office space for first accommodation okay, but so the first interesting case where you should, where you want to talk about the functor and a classification function it's just a formality in the case of the UHF algebras themselves in the upper left hand corner but for the free floating matrices you don't get. There's no natural concrete description of the k zero group, okay? It's only up to isomorphism that it's a subgroup of the rational. It's what? Abstractly it's a torsion free countable boolean group of rank one torsion free rank one which means that it's isomorphic to some subgroup of the rational numbers, okay? And using that and the fact that the isomorphisms in the unit preserve the class of the unit then you get a supernatural number exactly. It will the exercise I'm suggesting is for the free floating one if the k zero groups are just isomorphic and civilian group then you have the two supernatural numbers and n prime what's the relationship going to be between them?
00:36:59.954 - 00:37:00.774, Speaker A: Okay.
00:37:04.674 - 00:37:32.190, Speaker B: Sorry one is twice did you say you're getting a concrete approach which is very, very good it needs to be corrected okay I mean I remember when speaks may came to Queen's University when I was a master's student he gave a beautiful lecture but several times during the lecture he said something and then he said well now I have to correct that. Say it a little more correctly.
00:37:32.292 - 00:37:33.054, Speaker A: Okay.
00:37:33.434 - 00:38:00.622, Speaker B: And that, that was his pedagogical device, so I appreciate your pedagogy. So the point is, you look at the arithmetic, okay? You look at the supernatural numbers and arithmetic, and the arithmetic, you can't, adding them is not natural. But multiplying by two supernatural numbers, or especially, even including natural numbers, that's, um, that's natural.
00:38:00.678 - 00:38:01.434, Speaker A: Okay.
00:38:01.894 - 00:38:34.068, Speaker B: And um, so suppose you, um, and by the way, it's almost your, the, um, it's, you're 50 50%, right, I would say. Okay, but, um. Anyone want to make a slightly more refined approximation? Yes, everyone? Well, okay, but you're not careful. You'll get the definition that they're equal.
00:38:34.116 - 00:38:35.484, Speaker A: Okay? Yeah.
00:38:35.604 - 00:40:31.504, Speaker B: And so, and don't forget, and I think you're, it's a little too complicated. We've got two, think of them as natural, as super, think of as just like natural numbers you can add and model. Also always go to special cases, like if you have one of them, if you have one supernatural number and then you multiply it by two, that's the simplest thing you could do, right? The question is that going to give you the same free floating algebra or a different one? Well, roughly speaking, obviously the same, because if you take two by two matrices over a free floating algebra, it's the same thing, right? So that's a lightning, that's what I like to think of as a lightning computation. Why not just think about it? Let's leave it as an exercise. Okay, but if you have two supernatural numbers, n and n prime and the free floaters are equal, free floaters are you, then what does this imply? And of course, the way to decide what something implies is to go backwards. But what are some simple cases that do imply that the algebra, so check, if you, well, just check exactly that. If you take, by the way, one special case where you'll get exactly the same thing is if you take two to the infinity and you multiply that by two, that's too special, right? But obviously, since the number is the same, you're going to get the same algebra even before you do the free floating, the unital ones, I mean two to the infinity, two to the infinity, they give you the same unital, uh, algebra.
00:40:31.504 - 00:41:24.164, Speaker B: That's not even a good joke, right? If, if, um, if, if I can't, if I can't find a joke, it's time to go on to the next item. So the, um, um, the free floaters are the first case where you have classification functors really coming into their own. Okay, but what's the next case? Next is general af algebra. Look at general Af algebra. Then you still have k zero, right? And they have the semi group. You don't need the group. Just look at the semigroup, boolean semigroup or the considerate image inside the group.
00:41:24.164 - 00:41:58.486, Speaker B: Consider the group together with the image of the semi group, and that gives you what's called an order group. Well, turns out that the order group k zero for an af algebra. What's an af algebra? Well, uhf was a limit of single and full matrix algebra, right. You take the finite. Um, you take more and more. Where do they go? Did I erase them? What happened to the. Oh, here.
00:41:58.486 - 00:42:28.386, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Couldn't see an angle. Always there's the first 1 second one. That's a single matrix algorithm, right? Tensor of two other. Keep on going. Except that if this is infinite, then it's already limit. But if you, if you take the finite matrix algebras, then that's called the UHF algebra.
00:42:28.386 - 00:42:38.114, Speaker B: And within the af algebra, instead of a single full matrix algebra, you look at just the arbitrary finite direct sum of full matrix algebra.
00:42:38.154 - 00:42:38.854, Speaker A: Okay?
00:42:39.354 - 00:43:04.334, Speaker B: You have maps and they look at the algebraic. Look at the algebraic limit as an algebra. And those can be classified again just by k zero. That's a. K zero is a classification function for these so called aflsible. So it's in the book. In the book.
00:43:04.334 - 00:43:13.634, Speaker B: But maybe you could try working it out. Anyway, when I was doing it.
00:43:15.774 - 00:43:16.134, Speaker A: Which.
00:43:16.174 - 00:43:26.434, Speaker B: Was how long ago was it? Anyone want to guess? It was exactly 50 years.
00:43:27.214 - 00:43:28.034, Speaker A: Okay.
00:43:28.574 - 00:43:51.254, Speaker B: When I was doing it, it took me a while. The one thing. One thing. I was older than you people already, and you always slow down, I guess. Okay, you can tell, right? All right, but I should be finished by now. Okay, maybe. But.
00:43:51.254 - 00:44:37.024, Speaker B: So, but if. If something has already been done, you know it's been done, then that's supposed to help? That's believed to help? Well, there's one way in which it might not help, right? One way in which it might help to know it's not. Hasn't been done. If you know it hasn't been done, then there's the. It's a prize, right? Whereas if you know it has been done, then you might just shrug it off. Or anyone can do it and maybe. No need to spend my time on that.
00:44:37.024 - 00:44:58.284, Speaker B: Well, it's a question of how much you like assigning exercises to yourself. Okay, well, I recommend it as an exercise. You can peek in the book after a while, see what, see what gets done. But the cat is already out of the bag. It's the ordered k zero group.
00:44:58.324 - 00:44:59.024, Speaker A: Okay?
00:44:59.964 - 00:45:38.604, Speaker B: And now you have to know why it works for af and not for an arbitrary sister algebra. It works more generally, works more generally than Af, but then you have to combine it with k one, okay? Which we haven't even talked about too much yet. I can tell you what k one is. Very simply, you take the suspension of an algebra, the Banach algebra, and take k zero, okay? And that's. That's k one suspension. What's the suspension of a. You see, of a Banach algebra, where you take the real line, look at functions from the real line into your Banach algebra.
00:45:38.604 - 00:46:09.334, Speaker B: Banach algebra is b. B for banner, Banach faces were invented also by Banach. I guess he didn't invent Banach algorithms, but of course, Banach didn't call them Banach spaces. I say, of course. What do you suppose he called them? I wish he. No, no. This is.
00:46:09.334 - 00:47:13.270, Speaker B: His life was ended tragically, I believe, but, okay, but I won't do so I say it, okay? It's meant as an admiring comment. Okay, he called them b spaces. So here's b, and you look at b valued functions on the real line, which vanish at infinity. They get arbitrarily small and norm. And the norm is the sup norm, okay? You take the sup norm, and that point wise multiplication, in addition, multiplying by the Vanek algebra, called the suspension of b, written s of b. And for any complex Banach algebra, any real or complex manic algebra, k zero of s, b is, by definition, that's k one of B.
00:47:13.342 - 00:47:14.114, Speaker A: Okay.
00:47:18.294 - 00:47:50.674, Speaker B: And what you suppose k two of b is? Well, it's the k one of s of b. But what do you suppose it is? But just we're talking. If we're talking about complex spanish algebra, what do you suppose that k two would be? Who said that? Yeah, okay. You've been thinking either that or you. Either that, or you don't need to take this course. Okay, good.
00:47:50.714 - 00:47:52.534, Speaker A: Yeah, good.
00:47:53.434 - 00:48:12.716, Speaker B: But that's. Maybe we should be talking more about that. That's the. What you might say is the. In terms of overall case theory, that's almost the be all and the end all of the course.
00:48:12.780 - 00:48:13.504, Speaker A: Okay.
00:48:15.804 - 00:48:49.154, Speaker B: Well, it's. You know what it's called? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's, um. That's a grade A theorem, okay? Fully in terms. And it's a sort of a general theorem. It's not. You don't need to know, you don't need over the sister algebra prove for Banach algebra.
00:48:49.154 - 00:49:16.970, Speaker B: And in fact, to prove it for sister algebra, which is done in the textbook, you have to prove that the k zero group of a sister algebra is the k zero group of a Banach algebra of it considered as the Banach algebra. Banach algebra doesn't have, has idemposing, but it doesn't have star operation.
00:49:17.042 - 00:49:17.610, Speaker A: Right.
00:49:17.762 - 00:49:30.674, Speaker B: And for seastar algebra, the whole setup for k zero is defined, is expressed in terms of self adjoint I impose, this is a minor thing, but, okay.
00:49:30.714 - 00:49:33.334, Speaker A: But it's.
00:49:36.314 - 00:51:06.328, Speaker B: And sister algebra are a, I think it's better to give a course on sister algebras rather than bionic algebra. Because the one thing, the seast algebra theory, the case of amenable phenomenon algebra and amenable sea star algebra. What happened? Complete classification to the classification function. Most settings, these are considered major theorems nowadays, just like in group theory, you have the classification of finite simple groups, right? This is probably, well, it's still being checked, but in fact, just the fact that it's still being checked means I guess people think that's important. You might, you might look up the, look up on Amazon sometime, see if you can order the, if it's possible to order the atlas or find that simple group. Oh, it would probably, probably, it would say what it costs and how long it would take to do deliver. And you might get some reviews.
00:51:06.376 - 00:51:07.040, Speaker A: Right.
00:51:07.232 - 00:52:48.714, Speaker B: Interesting to see a review of the atlas of finite simple group. Okay, so the question is what, what is special about af algebra for more general CSP algebras, like if it's at algebra, say simple at algebra, whereas t is a circle, okay? So instead of points, you have little circles, okay? And that means you look at matrix algebra, some matrix valued functions on the circle. And if you look at the, look at at algebras, and there's no nice classification of them in general like there is for af algebra. But if you take, if you take simple ones, then there is a nice classification, no, no non trivial two sided ideals. And that requires, that requires k one. And, but there's a, there's a discrete number of steps, just one. If you add one more invariant in the tracial complex of states, which are traces to keep track of that and a natural pairing with k zero, then you, then you do get a classification theorem, general class of algebra.
00:52:48.714 - 00:53:09.238, Speaker B: And you might ask, is there an atlas of classifiable simple sea structure? Well, the reason there isn't is that with the finite simple groups, you can just number them. Number one, finite simple group. Number one, finite simple group number two.
00:53:09.286 - 00:53:13.106, Speaker A: And so on sequence that has just.
00:53:13.130 - 00:53:29.138, Speaker B: Checked that you got all of them there and none of them are repeated. Then you publish that in a, in a big book with the siesta algebras, UHF ones are parameterized by a counter middle third.
00:53:29.226 - 00:53:29.974, Speaker A: Okay?
00:53:30.954 - 00:53:52.104, Speaker B: And that's the isomorphism classification too. But if you tensor them, that's an exercise. If you tensor them with the, if you look at the free floating UHS algebras, then we don't know what the isomorphism classes are parameterized by. But that's still an exercise. It's just a, it's still a gleam in people's eyes.
00:53:53.164 - 00:53:54.024, Speaker A: Okay?
00:53:54.804 - 00:54:15.534, Speaker B: So I hope to see people, I hope to see people coming up with the answer. And we've agreed. I hope you've agreed. We've agreed. You multiply the supernatural number by two, you're going to get the same free floating alpha. And actually the general answer is just piled a little higher and deeper.
00:54:15.574 - 00:54:16.134, Speaker A: Right.
00:54:16.294 - 00:54:38.674, Speaker B: Okay, maybe that's okay. Well, let's move into the second half of the afternoon. Some questions maybe. I'll be glad to try, if I can answer a question, and I'm sure Mr. Val will. 6180.
