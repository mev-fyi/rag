00:00:02.160 - 00:01:39.934, Speaker A: Okay, thank you so much. Let's continue. We, by now we have the material needed from completional and also when a sketch of materials we need from Fourier analysis. Now, the bridge. The bridge, which is the, the theorem by Paley and Wiener. So it's, let f be an entire function of exponential type, at most sigma, so it can be smaller than sigma. Indeed, as you when we restrict f on the real line, so entire is defined on the whole complex plane, and the real line is in l two.
00:01:39.934 - 00:02:24.927, Speaker A: So a square integrable on the real one, then that's the magic of this theorem. Based on what we saw before the break. If a function is in l two, then it has a Fourier transpose planche oral theory. So f here restricted on the real line. Just, just on this line is in l two. Therefore there is, we can talk about f hat. F hat exists and is.
00:02:24.927 - 00:03:26.078, Speaker A: It's in l two. We know that. But more than that, then f hat is identically equal to zero on minus infinity up to minus sigma union sigma plus infinity. Well, I wrote identically equal to zero. If you want to use the language of measured theory, you can say almost everywhere, because the function is in l two, but still saying that identically equal to zero, it's okay. So f hat, it is true that it is a function in l two of r, but on two big intervals, it's identically equal to zero. And therefore, when we use the formula that we saw for the inversion, that's something more than that.
00:03:26.078 - 00:04:18.340, Speaker A: F of z is given by this integral from minus sigma to plus sigma f hat of t e to the I two PI z t dt. For z in C, this is more than the inversion formula. The inversion formula gives us the function on the real axis, but here it's on the whole complex plane. And the identity holds everywhere. Because the function, it is continuous. There is no need to mention almost everywhere. And we also know that by, again by Plancheur, that f nor two.
00:04:18.340 - 00:05:39.254, Speaker A: And to say what we mean by norm two, I write l two, two of minus infinity, plus infinity is equal to normal f hat on l two, I can write here from minus infinity to infinity. But if I write minus sigma to plus sigma, it's also correct. Briefly speaking, they usually write normal f. In normal f, just index two is equal to normal f hat index two, both correct. But, I mean, this is in more detail. So the, the most important message of the theorem is here that f hat is zero on the union of these two intervals, and that the rest comes from the clangerial inversion formula. And also, the uniqueness theorem for analytic function, because if two analytic functions coincide almost everywhere, I mean, they coincide everywhere, even when there are more strong uniqueness theorems than this.
00:05:39.254 - 00:06:07.354, Speaker A: But every part of it is important. This is important. This is important. But the most important message is here. Of course, it's a if and only if theorem. I just wrote it in one direction, because the other direction is not that difficult. If a function f hat in l two is given and you define f by this formula, then, I mean, f is in l two and it's an entire function.
00:06:07.354 - 00:06:30.174, Speaker A: And this holds. I mean, the other direction is kind of easy. The, the difficult part. I wrote it as the pale winder theorem. So you see, this is why it's called bridge. You start from entire functional exponential type. I mean, in the complex analysis territory, you add a restriction from measure theory.
00:06:30.174 - 00:07:35.434, Speaker A: F is in l two of r, and then the Fourier transform come into picture and says that f has a particular representation, this representation. And moreover, you have this isometry. That's. I mean, as Shelton mentioned just before the break, one of the main reason we use this is to have this identity without the coefficient. Normal f is equal to normal f hat identity, no coefficient. So now we want to use this theorem to, to define a space which is called pw sigma. But before that, if you remember, in the first part, I also defined sigma plus and sigma minus, the growth of f on the direction of positive imaginary axis and negative imaginary axis.
00:07:35.434 - 00:08:56.513, Speaker A: They are needed here for a deeper version of this theorem. The version I wrote here is enough for our application. But there is another version which says more, more than this. Of course, if it's of type, at most sigma, then f hat is zero and minus infinity up to minus sigma, and from sigma up to plus infinity. So here is zero, here is minus sigma, here is plus sigma. And this version that I mentioned says that f hat is zero on the yellow part, but possibly it's zero a bit further, but zero up to here and zero up to them. And what are these points? And if I call this point a at this point b, what is the precise value of a and b? Is there a formula for that? And here is where sigma plus and sigma minus come into picture.
00:08:56.513 - 00:10:07.384, Speaker A: And if you look at the book by Paul Kusis, this is precisely equal to sigma plus. And this is equal to, Paul called this minus a, not a minus a equal to sigma minus. But if I call it a, is minus sigma minus, depends how to, how to define it. So we know precisely, based on a deeper version, which I did not write we do not precisely, it's zero from minus infinity to which point and from which point up to plus infinity. A and b are precisely given by the formula sigma plus and sigma minus given before. Again, what happened? Do you see the screen? No, it has gone now. Okay, thank you.
00:10:07.384 - 00:10:33.144, Speaker A: But I mean, I mentioned this version because, I mean, this is precisely what I need. The other version I do not. And the book by Paley Wiener. I mentioned Fourier analysis on the complex plane. There are many, many other versions with different combinations of hypotheses and many beauty. Beautiful result of this study. Now, the definition of space.
00:10:33.144 - 00:12:02.484, Speaker A: It's when we talk about 1 hour 15 minutes to to arrive at this point. What is p w sigma w? Sigma is the space of function f such that f is entire of exponential at most sigma and two. If restriction on r is in l two and the inner product and this space still part of the definition f and g in pw, sigma is defined to be integral from minus infinity plus infinity f of x g of x bar dx. Well, there are several steps to be taken. We need to show that this is a vector space. Very easy to do that. Also, this f times G is an inner product.
00:12:02.484 - 00:12:59.054, Speaker A: Still not difficult. The only part which needs the uniqueness theorem is that if normal f is equal to zero, this means that integral of f squared is zero. So f is zero almost everywhere on R. And now you need a uniqueness theorem for analytic functions. Analyticity comes into picture here to show that to conclude that f is identically zero for all zinc, I mean, everywhere. That's the only part which is a bit more result or needed. But the, the point that you face some trouble is when you want to prove the completeness.
00:12:59.054 - 00:13:38.954, Speaker A: How do we do that? What does it mean complete? I mean, normal f is normal f as an element of l two of R. That's good. L two of r is complete. If you consider a Cauchy sequence, then it's Cauchy in l two of r. Let me write it. F Cauchy in pw sigma implies that fn, sorry, fn restricted on R. Cauchy in l two.
00:13:38.954 - 00:14:26.784, Speaker A: Or that's good. We know that l two r is complete. So there is an f in l two of r such that fn goes to f in l two. Pretty much. We stop here because there is no clue from this point on why f, which is the limit of fn, is indeed the restriction of an entire function of exponential type at most sigma. And, well, the convergences are evident. Absolutely no clue.
00:14:26.784 - 00:15:44.842, Speaker A: And the Paley Wiener theorem is the key to the solution of this problem. So up to here it's correct. But you cannot conclude that f is entire indeed of exponential. It's better to say the restriction our entire function of exponential less than or equal to sigma. To do this, we need to go back to the Paleo vener theorem. Pale vener theorem tells us so pw theorem tells us that f g in pw, which is integral from minus infinity to plus infinity f of x g of x bar dx is also equal to minus infinity plus infinity, which I will change the transform of f transform of g bar dx. But these, they do not leave on minus infinity to plus infinity.
00:15:44.842 - 00:17:03.654, Speaker A: They live on the interval minus sigma plus sigma. In other words, we can say that it's equal to f hat g hat inner product, but in l two of minus sigma sigma. And so for a specific f normal f in pw, sigma is equal to normal f hat in l two minus sigma sigma. This is what we saw before. And now if pretty much similar to the calculation we had here, but we do it in the other domain. We start with let fn be be a Cauchy sequence in pwc. What does this identity tell us immediately then fn hat is a Cauchy sequence in l two of minus sigma sigma.
00:17:03.654 - 00:18:13.804, Speaker A: Because instead of f, simply write f minus fm. And you see that fn hat minus fm hat is small in norm. If the normal fn minus fm is small. So immediately we see that fn hat is co she so we went from one domain to another. We know also that l two of minus sigma, sigma is complete, l two minus sigma, and sigma is also complete. Therefore, there is a function, which I mean temporarily, I'll call it phi in l two minus sigma sigma such that fn hat goes to phi in l two. Now I define, that's my definition.
00:18:13.804 - 00:20:12.574, Speaker A: Define f by this formula f of z to be integral minus sigma to plus sigma phi of t e two PI I z t I copy paste the formula which is in the paleo vener theorem. But for function phi, I call the resulting function f. Now, knowing that phi is in l two, l two of a bounded interval, it is also in l one. Therefore, the function f defined this way very easily. Entire function of exponential type at most sigma. So it is easy or straightforward to see that f is an entire function of exponential type. And then again, based on the Planche oral theory, if z here is in c, if I restrict z to the x axis, what do I get? Take z to be minus x and x be in r f of minus x integral minus sigma to plus sigma phi of te to the minus two PI I x t dt.
00:20:12.574 - 00:21:23.684, Speaker A: In this format, you immediately see the Fourier transform. So f of minus x is the Fourier transform of x. This therefore phi hat at point x is equal to f at point minus x. And if you apply the Fourier transform one more time, you remember that if phi had had twice gives you the phi of minus x. From this you you conclude that phi of x is equal to f hat of x almost. So the phi, which I show here exists m phi, without knowing what it is, is indeed the Fourier partial transform of a function f. So I can rewrite the formula which is here the formula in my definition.
00:21:23.684 - 00:22:26.874, Speaker A: Rewrite the definition f of z is equal to integral from minus sigma sigma. Instead of phi, I write f hat e to the I two PI z tv it's the same formula. But write it in this way. Why I write it this way? You see that f n hat minus phi in l two of minus sigma and sigma goes to zero. Instead of phi, I write f hat. And now again, I use the Planche royal theory. I know that this l two norm is equal to the norm of fn minus f in l two of r.
00:22:26.874 - 00:23:09.056, Speaker A: So this one also goes to zero. And this is precisely definition of norm in pw. So this is the normal f in space pw sigma, which goes to zero. So that is why with the use of that theorem, we see that therefore pw sigma is complete. Without that theorem, we cannot do that. More than that, it's not just, I mean complete. What it means means a Hilbert space.
00:23:09.056 - 00:24:20.010, Speaker A: More than that, I show that the evaluation functionals are continuous. Why so? More than that, claim e z is bounded. Why recall that it's the formula is here. Take, take the absolute value of both sides of this formula. Absolute value of f of z is equal to absolute value minus sigma sigma f hat t e to the I two PI z t dt. Did I write it correctly? Yes. And then take the absolute value inside standard trick absolute value of an exponential.
00:24:20.010 - 00:25:23.934, Speaker A: So it's e to the real part, and the real part is minus two PI y t. And we have here an interval which is symmetric. T goes from minus sigma to sigma. If y is positive, the negative part is important. And at the point minus sigma times minus y, that's the biggest part. And if y is negative, minus y is positive, for t close to sigma is the biggest one. Generally speaking, we can say that this is less than or equal to e two PI absolute value of y times sigma and the rest is minus sigma sigma f hat of t dt.
00:25:23.934 - 00:26:22.844, Speaker A: Not yet the end of story, because to show that ez is bounded or continuous, we need to show that absolute value of f is less than a constant time normal f in l two. First of all, this is normal f hat and second is in l one. So to go from l one to l two, we can do that because here the interval is bounded. We can apply the Cauchy Schwarz. So it's two PI y sigma integral from minus sigma to sigma. Consider this as one times this. So one squared dt root square and the other one f hat t squared dt root square.
00:26:22.844 - 00:27:09.994, Speaker A: So this is the Cauchy Schwartz that I apply here. And what remains is here is two sigma with root square is root square of two sigma e to the two PI absolute value of y. And what remains here, it's the norm of f hat in l two of minus sigma and sigma. Almost done, because we saw about that the normal f hat in l two is equal to the norm of f in l two. This is precisely equal to the normal f. We can write here l two of r. Let me write.
00:27:09.994 - 00:28:24.664, Speaker A: But l two of r, it's not the normal two of r is the same as sigma is here. Sigma is missing here. This is normal f in pwc. Now, if I compare this from the beginning, this part to this one, I can conclude now that hence it is continuous or bounded. And normal is that as a functional from pw to c is at most this constant, not that z is fixed. So up to now it's very good. We have Hilbert space evaluation.
00:28:24.664 - 00:29:37.504, Speaker A: Functional are all continuous. So we have and r khs, the topic of our course. We obtain a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. And as in the previous cases of the four spaces we saw before, in each case we obtain the kernel function. Here we also want to find the kernel function. So, next question, what is kz? Well, what is the property of kz? We know that it has to satisfy this property f of z should be the inner product of f and k z in pw sigma. Very good.
00:29:37.504 - 00:30:37.366, Speaker A: Remember the extended form of the possible identity. We can say that the normal f is equal to the normal f hat, or the inner product of f and g g. Here is kz is equal to the inner product of the transform of h in the other space, which is l two more explicitly, this is also equal to integral from minus sigma to sigma. If hat of t k z hat of t, the whole thing bar dt. So kz is a kernel function which has to satisfy this property. On the other hand, we had a formula. I just used this formula.
00:30:37.366 - 00:31:47.084, Speaker A: It's up here. Here it is. F of z is also given by this formula in terms of the Fourier transform. I write it below again. So f of Z. We also know that also f of z is integral from minus sigma to sigma f hat of t e to the I two PI z t dt. So if I compare these two, I immediately see that as k z t bar has to be e to the I two PI z t if t is in between minus sigma and sigma, and if not is equal to zero.
00:31:47.084 - 00:32:16.544, Speaker A: That's a formula for k. There is a hat here. It's important. There is a hat, which I forgot. Kz hat bar. Well, take the bar of both sides. So k z hat at point t is given by zero here, and the bar of this is e to the minus I two PI z bar t.
00:32:16.544 - 00:33:32.524, Speaker A: And we know that we saw the relation between a function and its Fourier transform. So we apply it here. Let me write the formula before using episode in the pale vener theorem that f of z is given by integral minus sigma sigma f hat of t e to the I two PI z t dt. I want to replace f by k z here, but there will be two z. We will mix this z with the other one. So I change z here to w to avoid any confusion. So f of w is equal to this integral for any w in c in particular, I put f equal to kz.
00:33:32.524 - 00:34:42.698, Speaker A: So for f equal to k index z, k z of w is equal to integral from minus sigma to sigma. The transform, the transform is here, e to the minus I two PI z bar t times e to the I two PI w t dt. And that's a very easy integral. To calculate it's exponential function, we make it one exponential. It becomes one over two PI I w minus z bar e two PI I w minus z bar t from minus sigma to sigma. Of course, if w is equal to z bar, I mean, we need to be careful. It's easier in that case.
00:34:42.698 - 00:35:52.140, Speaker A: But let's find this case first. If we apply t equal to sigma and t equal to minus sigma, so e to the two PI I w minus z bar, sigma minus e to the minus two PI I divided by two PI I omega minus z bar. And you know the formula for sine, this is sine of two PI sigma omega minus z bar. And in denominator we have PI omega minus z bar. It's good. We can, we can keep it this way. But in engineering they use a function which is called sink sink of z is defined to be sine of PI z over PI z if z is not zero and equal to one if z equal to zero.
00:35:52.140 - 00:36:41.504, Speaker A: In some books, they also write sine of z over z. Be careful which version of sink you use. I use this version, and therefore, based on this version, we started with kz w. So, okay, z w, it becomes sink of. I mean, it's good we have PI times z, but it, we, we don't have two sigma. I can write two sigma here and two sigma there. So it becomes two sigma sinch of two sigma omega minus z bar.
00:36:41.504 - 00:37:43.692, Speaker A: The good thing about this version is that if I want to be very precise for this calculation, from this point on, I have to assume that omega is not equal to z bar. But if omega is equal to z bar, these two factors cancel each other, and the result is simply two sigma. And here, based on this definition, if omega is equal to z bar, it becomes sink of zero, which is one times two Sigma. So this one I can say for any z and for any w. So I obtained my reproducing candidate. You see, at the end we have two sigma, sink of two sigma, omega minus z bar. Absolutely no problem.
00:37:43.692 - 00:38:37.376, Speaker A: I mean, we can live with that. But again, it's like in ordinary courses when they want to verify the limit of something some authors and even some professors would like to reach at epsilon at the end, not two epsilon or five epsilon. So in those cases, you can go back and replace Epsilon by epsilon over five to arrive at epsilon at the end. And this is the case here, too. I mean, it was natural for us to start with interval minus sigma sigma. And at the end, you obtain this boxed formula for kz. If you want to have sigma sink of sigma omega minus z bar, you should go back from the very beginning and replace Sigma by sigma over two.
00:38:37.376 - 00:39:17.660, Speaker A: And indeed, some books they do at the beginning. It's not clear why they do that, but they consider functions such that f hat. You can see the function such that f hat is in. No, yes, is in l two of minus sigma over two, or sigma over two like this, and consequences that here, instead of two sigma, we have sigma. It's not a big deal. Up to you which version you like. Well, pretty much.
00:39:17.660 - 00:40:31.634, Speaker A: At the end, we obtained kz. The last advantage of this formula is here is this sharp, this estimation. It's a good estimation to conclude that ez is bounded, but what is precisely the norm of e z? Again, that's a point. We appreciate the power of this theory based on the formula we had on the first week. So recall, norm of ise is equal to the root of kz of z, or if you prefer the other version with two variables, k of z. Now, we have an explicit formula here. Let's compute the k of z at the point set, or in other words, on the diagonal.
00:40:31.634 - 00:41:21.378, Speaker A: It's an easy calculation. K z of z is equal to two sigma sink of two sigma z minus z bar is equal to two sigma. Think this is four sigma imaginary part of z. And we have I two. So it's two z minus z bar is two I imaginary part of the z. With two sigma, it becomes four sigma. We can leave it at it is.
00:41:21.378 - 00:42:26.620, Speaker A: But remember c, it was sine of PI z over PI z. And the whole thing is over z here. So it becomes two sigma times sine of PI times. Our argument again, argument. And you know that sine of ix is sine hyperbolic. I comes out. So this becomes two sigma I sine hyperbolic I times four sigma imaginary part of z over PI times four sigma imaginary part of z.
00:42:26.620 - 00:43:07.684, Speaker A: And there is an I here. It simplifies with that. So we have sine hyperbolic of an argument called w sine hyperbolic w over w. We can leave it as it is, can simplify if you wish. And even again, the way we defined sink, we can say that this is sine hyperbolic c of four sigma imaginary part, etcetera. That's precisely the way we, we define the sink. We can define the sign hyperbolic c two.
00:43:07.684 - 00:44:28.704, Speaker A: But I mean, this version is absolutely fine, too. The good thing about this, we can plug it here and obtain ez. So based on this, we immediately see that the norm of e z as a functional from pale vener space to c is root of two sigma times root of four sigma imaginary part of z. It's the estimation we obtained is not that bad. Let's see the estimation we obtained. It was here, root two sigma is already there, and e to the two PI sigma times imaginary part of z. So down there, instead of this, you can think of e to the exponent two PI sigma absolute value y as root of e to the four PI sigma imaginary part of z.
00:44:28.704 - 00:45:26.040, Speaker A: And now compare with this. What is this? It's precisely the combination I wrote about, plus the same combination with imaginary part replaced by minus imaginary part divided by two. True. So pretty much we obtain the same thing, but this one is a little bit better. In other words, if I want to simplify up there, we have e to the a and here. Here we have e to the two a plus e to the absolute value, minus two a divided by two root square. That's the difference between what we have up there and what we have here.
00:45:26.040 - 00:46:00.796, Speaker A: It's. It's more precise here, but not far away, so our estimation is not optimal, but it's not bad, too. It's a good one. So this finishes our study of pale living earth spaces. Nothing else to add? It. It took me a bit of time to prepare all these notes about pale vin spaces. In different books, they write it differently.
00:46:00.796 - 00:46:46.834, Speaker A: Even if you look at the Vern Paulson book, he explained a little bit different from what I said, but I mean, all of them are the same. I found this presentation, I mean, more direct, and we understand what's going on. Any question before we switch to the next space or family of spaces we want to consider? Well, if there is no question, we have another break. Again. Ten minutes, and then we come back to talk about hardy spaces. Hardy jewish land, Bergman spaces.
