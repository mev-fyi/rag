00:00:00.120 - 00:00:49.294, Speaker A: Today it's a combinatorial rigidity talk, or even graph theory if you want. So I don't think I have to define the basics on the fourth day of this meeting. Just let me recall that rigidity and global rigidity of frameworks in RD is a generic property. So there exists a rigid or globally rigid generic framework if and only if every generic framework is in RD is rigid or globally rigid. These are basic results. And therefore we can define two families of graphs for every fixed D. We can define rigid graphs.
00:00:49.294 - 00:01:31.028, Speaker A: They are the graphs for which some or equivalently every generic framework in RD is rigid. And we can define globally rigid graphs in a similar manner. And you know very well that. So it is one of the major targets to characterize rigid and globally rigid graphs in RD for every D. But so far, combinatorial characterizations are known only for D equals one and two. Okay, and in case you are really new to the subject, here is a figure for you. Two dimensional generic frameworks.
00:01:31.028 - 00:02:25.874, Speaker A: The first one on the left is not rigid. The second one is rigid, but not globally rigid. You can see the third one is an equivalent but non congruent realization of the second one. And the fourth one on the right is globally rigid in two reals. Okay, now let's start the warm up observations for today's topic. So first of all, you know, it's a very old observation, probably due to Maxwell, that if g is rigid in the plane, then the number of edges is at least two times the number of vertices minus three. And also well known that we can attain equality.
00:02:25.874 - 00:03:19.222, Speaker A: The minimally rigid graphs in the plane satisfy that the number of edges is equal to 2 volts three. Okay, but now let's increase the redundancy of the graph with respect to edge deletions. So it's also a well known concept. So a graph is said to be redundantly rigid, or today two edge rigid in RD, if g minus e is rigid for every edge. So if we remove any edge from the graph, then it is still rigid. Now, from the previous inequality, the second observation is obvious that if we have a two edged rigid graph in r two in the plane, then the number of edges is at least two v minus two. We may ask whether we can have equality.
00:03:19.222 - 00:04:44.920, Speaker A: And of course, we do have equality for every rigidity circuit in the plane. In particular, if we consider the wheel graphs on at least four vertices, then they are two edge rigid in the plane, easy to see, and they have exactly two v minus two edges. So we can conclude that for two edge rigid graphs in the plane, the smallest number of edges in terms of the number of vertices is 2 volts minus two, and this is tight for every v at least four. Now it's more interesting if we becomes more interesting if we consider vertex deletions, so we can define two vertex rigidity. The graph is two vertex rigid in rd if g minus v is rigid for all vertices v of the graph. So the next question in this sequence to ask is how about what is a tight lower bound? So if g is too vertex rigid in two reals, then we would like to have a lower bound that we can attain by an infinite family of graphs. So it's not so obvious.
00:04:44.920 - 00:05:22.414, Speaker A: It's not so obvious. It might be the case that we have even minimally rigid graphs which are too vertex rigid, or maybe redundantly rigid graphs which are too vertex rigid. For example, this is not one of them. It's a two edge rigid graph, the same veal graph, but it is not too vertex rigid. If we remove the center vertex, then we obtain a cycle. So it's not too vertex rigid. So, well, 1 may think about this, and it is possible to determine the tight bound.
00:05:22.414 - 00:06:46.336, Speaker A: And this is the first theorem in this context, and it's due to Brigitte 1989. So she proved that if we have a two vertex digit graph in the plane on at least seven vertices, then it has at least two n minus one edges, and this bound is tight for every n at least seven. She constructed a graph with two n minus one edges, which is two vertex rigid. You can see some, you can see two graphs which attain this number. Okay, so then I think it is quite natural to increase the redundancy, edge or vertex redundancy, and ask similar questions. So in order to ask these similar questions, let me introduce the corresponding definitions that you may guess. So we call a graph k vertex rigid or k vertex globally rigid in Rd, if g minus x is rigid or globally rigid for every subset of vertices of cardinality at most k minus one, right? So this is consistent with the previous notation.
00:06:46.336 - 00:07:27.468, Speaker A: So two, remember the two edge rigid, okay. Two vertex rigid means that we can remove one vertex and maintain rigidity. So k vertex rigid means that we can remove up to k minus one vertices the same for global rigidity. And then we can introduce the same definition for edge removal. We call a graph k edge rigid or k edge globally rigid, if this is satisfied for edge sets. So we can remove up to k minus one edges and maintain rigidity. And the xtml problem that we obtain here is this.
00:07:27.468 - 00:08:36.142, Speaker A: So we would like to determine the minimum number of edges of a k vertex or k edge rigid or globally rigid graph on n vertices in Rd given k, n and d. So k is the level of redundancy and the number of vertices, and d is the dimension. So Brigitte solved this special case when k is two, n is n and d is also two, and she solved the vertex rigid version. So you can see that here we have actually four different versions, vertex or edge deletion and rigidity or global rigidity. And we shall call the extremal graphs, graphs with the smallest size for a given n, k and d strongly minimal. So we shall talk about strongly minimal k vertex rigid, say now. So after Brigitte, as a result, actually nothing happened for 20 years.
00:08:36.142 - 00:09:59.684, Speaker A: Probably nobody wanted to solve this external problem. But then 20 years later, a group in Australia started looking at this external problem because they identified two motivations. The first motivation is a so called formation control problem. Imagine that we have a group of UAV's flying together in three space, and if they want to maintain a given formation, then they do that by preserving some pairwise distances. And you can see that the formation is stable if and only if the graph of these distances that they maintain is rigid. And if you want a formation which remains rigid even after the removal or loss of one of the vehicles, then clearly then you need a two vertex rigid formation. And since it seems to be useful to have smallest possible number of distances to manage or to maintain this axsimilar problem is quite natural.
00:09:59.684 - 00:11:04.364, Speaker A: Design a formation which is say, two vertex rigid in three space, and has the smallest number of connections or distances. So I think it's really a valid motivation, of course. And then there is another similar motivation, where instead of rigidity, we may talk about global rigidity. So most of you know that in the sensor network localization problem, global rigidity plays an important role. A network is localizable given some pairwise distances, if and only if the graph of these distances is globally rigid. And again, we may lose some sensors, battery dies or something happens. And then if we still want a localizable network, then we should design a highly redundantly globally rigid configuration.
00:11:04.364 - 00:11:50.194, Speaker A: So based on this motivation, this group, this group in Australia, you can see the authors of their papers, they published three papers, and they determined a few more extremal results, I mean, a few more tight bounds. So in this table, in this matrix, it's an infinite matrix. It has four rows. So you can see the rows correspond to vertex rigidity, edge rigidity, and so on. Columns correspond to the level of redundancy 1234 and so on. And now if you look at this matrix, let's have a look. So this is the two dimensional story.
00:11:50.194 - 00:12:22.554, Speaker A: So the first column is easy, because it's either easy or it follows easy, or it is folklore. So two n minus three is just a number of edges of a minimally rigid graph. Same the second row, and so on. So the first column is easy. The second entry in the first row is brigitte. As a result, two n -1 second entry in the second row is again folklore. It's two n minus two.
00:12:22.554 - 00:13:16.944, Speaker A: These are the rigidity circuits, minimal, redundantly rigid graphs of minimum size. And the remaining three entries had been found by this australian group. So they extended this matrix. And so in 2009, we had these nine entries of this big, big matrix, and I wanted to see what was going on. So why is it so that we only know nine entries of this infinite matrix? And then actually you can see, so the first table is the same, it's just a copy of the previous one. And then I managed to fill in this matrix. You can see all the entries, these bounds are all tight.
00:13:16.944 - 00:14:02.226, Speaker A: So you can see from the title of my talk that I like to talk about the three dimensional case, because it is a bit more interesting. So I will do that. But first, let's have a look at the two dimensional matrix. So here you can see these bounds, and there's one interesting phenomenon to observe. So if you look at the second table, which is field, then the first few entries in every row, they are numbers. They are given in the following form, two nice, plus, minus some constant. And then after a certain point, it's much bigger.
00:14:02.226 - 00:14:46.602, Speaker A: And also in the second row, two n plus minus a constant. And then suddenly it becomes much bigger. So we shall see the same, observe the same phenomenon also in the three dimensional case. So this is sort of the complete story about the two dimensional extremal problem. And now let's move to the three dimensional case. So the three dimensional case was almost never really touched, with one exception. So here at the top, you can see a somewhat discouraging sentence from one of the papers by this australian group.
00:14:46.602 - 00:15:36.694, Speaker A: So they thought that since we do not have a three dimensional Laman theorem, then it's probably hopeless to solve these problems in three dimensions. And in this new table, which shows the three dimensional story, you can see of course, in three d, the size of a minimally rigid graph. The number of edges is three, n minus six. So this is actually the first entry in the first row. So of course this is the absolute minimum. To have a rigid graph, we need three or minus six edges. So again, the first column is folklore, and so is the second entry in the second row.
00:15:36.694 - 00:16:31.674, Speaker A: And then, a few years after this remark, there was a paper by Viktoria Kosany. And Chobakirai was the first sign that maybe the three dimensional version, or some three dimensional versions, are tractable, even though we do not have a three dimensional Laman theorem. So they are responsible for the second and third term. In the first row, three n minus three and three n. But still, we have seven entries in this big matrix. So how about the three dimensional case? And this is the main message in this talk that actually it's not too bad. So we can do a lot without Laman theorem in 3d.
00:16:31.674 - 00:17:33.029, Speaker A: So the first table is a copy of the previous one, and the second table is what we could do. So, we could fill in this infinite matrix and we could determine the tight bounds for all but four entries in a paper, in a joint paper with Chris Poston and Ryan Roach. They are undergraduate students from the US. So we looked at this problem, and with these four exceptions, where we have an almost tight bound, I will mention these four exceptions, maybe later. So, with the exception of these four entries, we have all the entries. And you can see the same phenomenon that in the first few entries, three n plus minus something constant. And then from a certain point, it will grow.
00:17:33.029 - 00:18:28.746, Speaker A: And as you will see, it's the minimum d degree bound, will be the tight bound. But it turns out that in the first couple of columns, in some sense, every entry is a different story. So today I will talk about just one entry in detail, which is three n minus four in the second row. So, three edge rigidity in three space. And in this talk, I won't have time, of course, to talk about all the other entries, but the matrix now is almost completely filled. What do these epsilons mean? A good point. Thank you.
00:18:28.746 - 00:19:06.110, Speaker A: I wanted to mention that we have almost tied bounds, meaning that for each of these epsilon. So, okay, so, for example, we know that epsilon one. We know that. Okay, so the tight bound is between three n plus five and three n plus 20. So epsilon one is an integer between five and 20, and actually, epsilon two and epsilon four. Uh, in. In those cases, uh, the gap is.
00:19:06.110 - 00:19:32.034, Speaker A: Is just one. We have an really. An almost tight bound. So it means that. Yeah, this is what it means that, uh. Uh, we have a bound which is almost tight, tied up to a constant. Now, before I start talking about three and minus four, I chose the three and minus four because it has connections to other, uh, um, results in rigidity theory, which may be interesting.
00:19:32.034 - 00:20:44.644, Speaker A: But before I turn to this particular entry in this matrix, let me show you a few general observations. Oh no, before I show the general observations, okay, let me convince you that this problem or these problems are actually interesting or non trivial. At least they turned out to be more interesting than I expected. Because if you want to solve your favorite extremal problem, or to determine your favorite entry in this matrix, then first you have to come up with a strong enough lower bound on the number of edges. It is sometimes easy, sometimes not so obvious. And after determining a strong enough lower bound, then you have to construct an extremal family, candidate family. So graphs that match this size lower bound, and you have to construct an infinite family, so at least one graph for all sufficiently large n.
00:20:44.644 - 00:21:43.744, Speaker A: And then in order to show that it is indeed an extremal family, then you have to prove for every graph in this infinite family, and for every subset of vertices or edges of size at most k minus one, that if you remove this set, then what you get is still rigid or globally rigid. Now, if k is large, then it's not easy. Then you have lots of cases to worry about, and in particular in three dimensions. In some sense, we don't know. We have no, yeah, we don't know the characterization of rigid graphs. So you have to, you have to solve item three without knowing which graphs are rigid. So it's a challenging, in some sense graph theoretical problem.
00:21:43.744 - 00:22:37.904, Speaker A: So it turns out actually that for if k is small, then the first two items are more difficult, and then the third one is not too bad. And if k is large, then the lower bounds are typically straightforward. But then showing this for every x and for every graph is the tricky part. Now let's see some warm up observations. So some useful lemmas first. So there are some implications that help fill in this matrix. So sometimes if we determine one entry, then it implies a few more other entries in this matrix.
00:22:37.904 - 00:23:51.880, Speaker A: So this observation, so these lemmas, actually they are valid in Rd for all diagram, and the low dimensional versions had been proved earlier, but it's nice that they work for every d. So k vertex rigid implies k edge rigid, k vertex globally rigid implies k edge globally rigid, and k edge globally rigid implies k plus one edge rigid. Not very surprising if you know the, if you are familiar with the basic theorems in rigidity theory, but you can deuse and use these lemmas. And finally, a k vertex rigid implies k minus one vertex globally rigid. So we also have implications between these different rows in this infinite matrix. Okay, this is one, just a useful fact. And here is another statement, another lemma.
00:23:51.880 - 00:24:48.854, Speaker A: It's kind of interesting. It was not that useful, but still it's also valid for old. It shows that the cooling operation, which I'm sure you are familiar with, the fundamental corning theorems of Walter Whiteley and also Bob Connelly and Walter Whiteley. And there is also a version for high redundancy. Interesting thing is that if you have a k vertex rigid graph and we look at the cone, then we obtain a k edge rigid graph in Rd plus one. Similarly, coning transfers, or, I mean slightly changes the redundancy. It transfers k vertex, say, global rigidity to k edge global rigidity in RD plus one.
00:24:48.854 - 00:25:58.250, Speaker A: But sometimes this general cooling lemma can be used to find constructions and maybe one more observation. It's really easy. This is one family of lower bounds, which is the simplest one, and it was also found by other people in the previous papers. It's simply a minimum degree bound. So every rigid graph in Rd on at least d plus one vertices has minimum degree at least d. Globally rigid graphs have minimum degree at least d plus one. So if we have a k vertex or k edge rigid graph, for example, then since it must stay rigid even if we remove up to k minus one edges or vertices, then if we just focus on the neighborhood of a vertex, then we can deduce that the minimum degree of such a graph must be at least d plus k minus one, obviously.
00:25:58.250 - 00:26:43.104, Speaker A: And this gives the, this lower bound for the edge number. And the same, there is a similar bound for, for global rigidity. Okay, but so in some cases the degree lower bounds can be attained, but in some other cases they are, they are too weak. And then we have to determine other lower bounds. All right, so from now on we shall focus on this particular entry. This is our goal in the rest of the talk. Determine the smallest number of edges in a three edge rigid graph on n vertices in r three.
00:26:43.104 - 00:27:51.764, Speaker A: And of course, there is another trivial lower bound here, because rigid graphs have at least three and minus six edges, and hence three edge rigid graphs. So remember that we can delete up to two edges and maintain rigidity. So obviously every three edge rigid graph must have at least three and minus four edges. It's a different, even more obvious lower bound. And you will see, you have already seen from in this table that we can attain this bound. So we have to construct a family of graphs with this property that every graph in this family has only two extra edges beyond the three and minus six lower bound for minimal rigidity. But it must satisfy this property that we can remove any pair of edges and preserve rigidity.
00:27:51.764 - 00:28:55.944, Speaker A: Now, what can we do about this? One strategy uses results about triangulated convex polydra. So here you can see a few examples and a real one as well. So these are triangulated convex polydra. And famous result by Cauchy from 1813 says that every triangulated convex polyhedron is rigid in three space. And there is also the stronger version. I think it's due to Dehn that every triangulated strictly convex polyhedron is infinitesimally rigid in three reals, which implies that the graph of such a polyhedron is rigid, is minimally rigid in three reals. So the graphs of these polydra will be called triangulations.
00:28:55.944 - 00:30:03.064, Speaker A: So we could also define triangulations by saying that a triangulation is a maximal planar graph and maximal planar graphs. So, planar graph, maximal means that every face is a triangle. And basic facts about these graphs, they are three connected, and they satisfy that the number of edges is equal to three, n minus six. Okay, so this old result, and the modern version, it gives us a nice family of minimally rigid graphs, the maximal planar graphs. And then, well, since we want redundant rigidity or three edge rigidity, we have to add more edges to our triangulation. And the triangulations with extra added edges, they are called braced triangulations. So if you look at this figure, then you can see one bracing edge in the middle.
00:30:03.064 - 00:31:04.676, Speaker A: So it's simply, it's a super graph of a maximal planar graph triangulation plus some extra edges. And now we are 1 May 1 may observe that there is a nice conjecture by Walter from 88, which gives a, I mean, the truth of this conjecture would imply or desired, three n minus four bound. Because the conjecture says that every five connected braced triangulation with at least two bracing edges is three edge rigid. So if you have a five connected braced triangulation with exactly two bracing edges, then it has three n minus four edges in total, and it is three edge rigid. So then it's an extreme graph. It's an extreme graph. So it's kind of encouraging.
00:31:04.676 - 00:31:56.014, Speaker A: But this conjecture is still open. It's still open. We don't know. But the nice, I mean, the good news is that in order to solve this XDML problem, we don't have to solve this conjecture. We have to verify this conjecture for an infinite family of five connected brace triangulations. That will do. Okay, so, related result that we shall also use is a theorem that we proved with Shinichi tanigawa two years ago, that every four connected braced triangulation with at least one bracing edge is globally rigid, and hence two edge rigid, because globally rigid graphs are too edge rigid.
00:31:56.014 - 00:32:47.264, Speaker A: So here it's not what we want, it's just too edge rigid. But at least it may be useful. So four connectivity instead of five connectivity, but only two edge rigidity. So let me mention that actually we have an even stronger conjecture, stronger than Walter's conjecture, not related to this talk, but just wanted to mention that, in fact, we believe that every five connected braced triangulation with at least two bracing edges is two edge globally rigid. But we don't need this. Okay, so our goal, our goal, as I said, is to verify Walters conjecture for an infinite family. And then we can, we can use another interesting set of results.
00:32:47.264 - 00:33:44.592, Speaker A: Namely, we turn to triangulated polyhedra with blocks and holes. So, instead of the formal definition here, you can see on the left you have a triangulation, and on the right you have a triangulation with two holes and two blocks. So we obtain the holes by removing edges. So in this case, we have removed two edges, and we obtain blocks by adding edges so that we make the union of some neighboring faces rigid. In this case, we have two blocks of size four. And another interesting story here is whether one can characterize the rigidity of polydra or triangulations with blocks and holes. And the complete answer is still not known.
00:33:44.592 - 00:34:37.414, Speaker A: But luckily, Jim, Derek and Steve, they solved an interesting special case. Namely, they considered block and hole graphs, block and hole graphs with a single block. And in this case, they characterized minimal rigidity. They proved that such a single block many hole graph is minimally rigid if and only if it satisfies the so called girth inequalities that I will not define. And this result, the theorem, is an extension of the some basic first results by Wendy and Walter. So, they solved the one block, one hole case. And now we have a result for the single block many hole case.
00:34:37.414 - 00:35:13.094, Speaker A: Okay, so this is what we can use. And now let me show you the construction. So this is what we do. We pick a five connected triangulation and then add two edges so that we create a five block. You can see in the middle that after adding the dotted edges, we have a k five minus an edge subgraph, which is rigid in three space. So we have a five block and no holes. So triangles are not considered holes.
00:35:13.094 - 00:35:54.004, Speaker A: Okay, so it's a one block, no hole configuration. It's obviously rigid because triangulations are rigid. So we call this extended graph g. And we proved with Chris and Ryan that this g is a three edge digit for every five connected triangulation. We can do this construction and obtain a three edge rigid graph. Why is that? The proof is not so short, but let me briefly give you a proof sketch. So we have to show that g, the extended graph minus e minus f, is minimally rigid for all pairs of edges.
00:35:54.004 - 00:36:49.348, Speaker A: So for every edge pair, g minus e f is minimally rigid. Now, case one. This is the lucky case. So if the edges are disjoint from this five block that we have created, then you can observe that if we remove two edges which are disjoint from the five block, then we create a one five hole, if e and e f belong to the same face, or two four holes. So then we have a single block two hole configuration. And then we can apply the block and whole theorem and use five connectivity to to argue that g plus minus EF is minimally rigid is rigid. Now, the second case is a bigger problem, because if these edges are not disjoint from the five block, then what we get.
00:36:49.348 - 00:37:26.914, Speaker A: So then g plus minus ef is no longer a block and hole graph or a triangulation or whatever. Then it is a bit messy. But in this case, we can perform some local reduction operations near the block. And then we can apply the braced triangulation theorem or the block and hole theorem to show that the reduced smaller structure or graph is rigid. And then we restore the rigidity. We obtain g plus minus ef by using local operations. Vertex additional edge splitting.
00:37:26.914 - 00:38:15.646, Speaker A: So here, indeed, we need every tool that we have. Even x replacement, of course, special cases of x replacement that work, and vertex splittings. Even Voltaire's second type of vertex splitting is used. But with all these local operations, we can show that g minus EF is indeed rigid. So this is the conclusion here. If g is a strongly minimal three edge rigid graph on at least ten vertices, then the number of edges is 3 volts minus four. And the lower bound on n is due to the fact that the smallest five connected triangulation is the graph of the icosahedron.
00:38:15.646 - 00:39:01.398, Speaker A: But for every n at least ten, there is a five connected triangulation. So this leads to one single entry in this infinite matrix. But luckily one can. Yeah, one can fill in the matrix by solving finitely many subproblems so quickly open problems. So remember we had four epsilons in this matrix, four vertex rigidity and so on. Three vertex globality, two vertex global rigidity. These are the almost tight numbers, and the most difficult one seems to be the first one.
00:39:01.398 - 00:39:43.734, Speaker A: So four vertex rigidity in three space. This is probably the tough one. For the third and fourth item we have. I mean, we have a conjectured optimum and corresponding family of graphs, but the first one is tough. And here you can see this bonus item that actually, from the algorithmic point of view, these problems are also open. So even in the plane, we do not know the status of this optimization problem. How to compute the edge or vertex redundancy of a graph in the plane.
00:39:43.734 - 00:39:53.814, Speaker A: There is no known polynomial time algorithm. Okay, sorry for the extra time. I think I should stop. Thank you.
00:39:55.514 - 00:40:16.134, Speaker B: Thank you, Thibault. It's a really interesting talk. Does anyone have a question for tbor? So while people are thinking, Alice, the obvious question. If you go up to arbitrary dimension, how much of the table or the matrix that you have can you fill in just for free?
00:40:17.634 - 00:40:38.214, Speaker A: Yeah, good point. Good point. So in so Victoria and Chaba, they have considered the d dimensional case and they determined the. What is it? Okay. Two vertex rigidity. Two vertex rigidity in RD. This is the solved special case.
00:40:38.214 - 00:40:41.144, Speaker A: No other results are known.
00:40:41.764 - 00:40:43.464, Speaker C: I have some other results.
00:40:45.204 - 00:40:50.484, Speaker A: Chaba thinks that he has some further results. Working progress. Yes.
00:40:50.524 - 00:41:23.124, Speaker C: So I know that this lower band, which was mentioned by Tiber for large values of k, is the optimum. So it's, it's, it's tight when k is at least about d square. So. Yeah, sorry, I can prove it for such large values of k.
00:41:24.944 - 00:41:31.144, Speaker A: So the right side of the matrix, the infinite part, is probably field. Yeah.
