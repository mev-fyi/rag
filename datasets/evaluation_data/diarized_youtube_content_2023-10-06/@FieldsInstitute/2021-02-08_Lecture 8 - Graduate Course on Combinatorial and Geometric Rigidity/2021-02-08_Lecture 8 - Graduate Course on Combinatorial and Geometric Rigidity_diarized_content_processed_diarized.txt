00:00:00.120 - 00:01:06.784, Speaker A: Do you remember two lectures ago I talked about at the end about three dimensional rigidity in higher dimensions and showed these examples like the double bananas, where a graph that is d tied, but it's not minimally rigid, or not rigid in d dimensional space. I want to do similar things today in terms of telling you about higher than two dimensions and, but I want to tell you sort of the good direction. So, classes of graphs for which we do understand rigidity, in particular classes of graphs for which the D type condition is sufficient to guarantee d rigidity. And so we'll focus on three dimensions. And then an advert that on Wednesday, Sean Dewar will give the lecture in this course, and he will talk about complete bipartite graphs. So complete bipartite graphs is one class of graphs where we, we do understand a lot in d dimensional rigidity. And the first class of grasping that I'm really going to talk about today are triangulations.
00:01:06.784 - 00:01:36.604, Speaker A: And they're another class where we have a really good understanding. And then in between those two classes, there is lots of complicated things that can happen. Okay, so as I say, we're going to talk about rigidity when d is greater than or equal to two. Yes, it is recording, I believe. Thanks, William. So a simple observation to get started is that we can check small graphs by hand. We can just calculate the rank of the rigidity matrix.
00:01:36.604 - 00:02:28.848, Speaker A: So for example, k four complete graph and four vertices is a free tight graph, which we can easily check, has the right rank of the rigidity matrix to be rigid in three dimensions. And we've already seen that the zero extension operation and the one extension operation. And then two lectures ago, we talked about vertex splitting. So we know certain operations preserve rigidity in three dimensions. So we can use the three dimensional versions of these three operations to generate many, many examples of free tight graphs that are minimally rigid. So sort of, in some sense, typical graph that is free type will be rigid because you can get lots and lots of such graphs for this, these operations. And so one exercise, if you like, and this is kind of open ended, because I don't really know what the answer is in nice closed form.
00:02:28.848 - 00:03:34.752, Speaker A: But try and understand what graphs you actually get just from these operations, and try and give some sort of understanding of what you get and think about what graphs you can't get. So it's easier to decide particular graphs that are free type that you can't get from these operations because you can look at the minimum degree, you can look at the girth of the graph, for example. But understanding what the class of graphs you get from these operations, I think, would be a nice thing to do if anyone wants an open ended exercise. As I said, I want to talk about triangulations in particular. There's a really general result, which I won't go into, but it's a really nice result obtained by Vogelsanger in the eighties. And what he did, essentially, he proved that you take any surface you like, any closed two dimensional manifold with no boundary, and you triangulate that surface. What you get is the graph of the triangulation is rigid in three dimensional space.
00:03:34.752 - 00:04:06.334, Speaker A: And so there's a couple of comments to make here. So, first of all, the triangulation of the surface itself, the topology you get, doesn't play any real role in the rigidity. So all I really mean by saying the graph of a triangulation of a surface is rigid, is that the triangulation of the surface gives me a graph, the graph of that triangulation. And then I take that graph, and I realize it generically in three dimensional euclidean space. And then I ask if that graph, generically realized, is rigid, and the Vogelswanger proves that it always is.
00:04:07.154 - 00:04:08.626, Speaker B: Okay, Tony?
00:04:08.770 - 00:04:10.370, Speaker A: Yes, go ahead, Al.
00:04:10.562 - 00:04:15.810, Speaker B: Oh, sorry. You wrote arbitrary, but then you said it closed without boundary.
00:04:15.962 - 00:04:26.294, Speaker A: Yeah, by arbitrary, I meant arbitrary genus, I guess. So, orientable or non orientable genus, whatever you like. But I don't want to worry about ones with boundaries.
00:04:26.714 - 00:04:27.614, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:28.794 - 00:04:52.614, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe arbitrary was a bit misleading. Sorry. And does the surface have to be embeddable in three reals or not? I'd have to check Fogelsang as proof, but I think that's the context he was working. Yes. Okay, cool. I'm not 100% sure on that, though.
00:04:54.554 - 00:05:04.604, Speaker B: So you could take the Klein bottle immersed in r three, triangulate it, and see if it's rigid. Okay. That's not covered by this.
00:05:07.824 - 00:05:34.304, Speaker A: Yeah. To be honest, I'm not 100% sure of the exact generality that Vogel Sanger did it. But, I mean, I bet the answer is true, is that it is rigid. But whether it was quite covered by his theorem or not, I'm not 100% sure. I think. Yes, I think that complete that was talking about all surfaces oriented, non oriented was giving just rigidity. Non minimal rigidity.
00:05:34.304 - 00:06:42.530, Speaker A: Yes. Okay, so let's just think about the counts. We were in three dimensional space, so that the D type count tells us that the number of edges should be free, v minus six. But it's easy to check, using the Euler's formula, what the number of edges you will get in a triangulation of a surface, depending on the genus, and as long as it's not the sphere, it's definitely going to be more than 3 volts minus six. So Fogelsang, as result, if the genus is high, it tells you rigidity, but it doesn't really tell you anything about minimal rigidity because you can have many, many more edges than you need for the the minimal rigidity count. And it doesn't tell you anything about how you would delete edges to find a basis, to find a base in the matriarch, or to find a minimally rigid spanning subgraph. Though I can point out that I left Harris, who made a comment in Steve Power and Jim Cruickshank and Derek Kitson, and previously Walter Whiteley and Alyssa Ross and Wendy Fimbo Singh.
00:06:42.530 - 00:07:48.552, Speaker A: The groups, several groups of people have started looking at taking triangulations of surfaces that aren't the sphere, and then cutting out some edges, making some holes, or adding some edges in, and trying to head towards a more minimal rigidity kind of result for specific small genus surfaces. I don't want to say anything more really, about arbitrary surfaces. I just mentioned this generality to really focus on triangulations of the sphere, just planar graphs, in particular, maximal planar graphs. So what we're going to show is that every planar graph is independent in the three dimensional rigidity matriid. And the way we're going to do it is by showing that maximal planar graphs, graphs in which adding any edge will destroy the planarity, are exactly all minimally rigid, so that there are free v minus six graphs that happen to be be minimally rigid and provably minimally rigid. Okay, so again, it is not a difficult exercise to show that every maximal planar graph has three v minus six edges. You can also show they're all free connected.
00:07:48.552 - 00:08:38.248, Speaker A: You show that every face in the graph is a triangle. There's several easy properties of maximal planar graphs that are sort of relevant, but I'm just going to take them all for granted. And our proof is really going to be very short. It's going to be the consequence of what we've already talked about with vertex splitting and this proposition that's here. So remember two lectures ago, we were doing vertex splitting in two d, and we had to care about when you split. So in 2d, you had this move where you took u and you split it into u dash and u double dash, say, and this and v went to here, and you had to care about how the edges over here were split amongst these two vertices, because you might destroy planarity if you don't. So you have exactly the same condition in 3D when your vertex split really has a w here and a second vertex split into two.
00:08:38.248 - 00:09:48.406, Speaker A: So in the three dimensional case, what, for example, when you're doing reductions, you want to pick two edge sharing triangles where the two triangles are both faces and contract that edge that was common to the two triangles and go down. And when you're doing the extension, you have to be careful to be careful with how you apply the, how you mix the edges instant to u with edges instant to u and u double dash. But you can do that, and I won't go into any, any more detail with that. And so let me just say the proposition and then really the, the rigidity corollary. So Steinitzen Rademacher proved that every maximal planar graph can be obtained from k four by vertex splitting operations. So they showed in any maximal planar graph, you have two edge sharing triangles like this, and you can contract an edge and you can roughly, you can contract most edges in a, in a maximal planar graph. Okay, so then Gluck's theorem, although I wasn't quite sure who to reference here.
00:09:48.406 - 00:10:29.960, Speaker A: So someone might shout if they think, I should have appropriated this to someone else, but I'm assigning it to Gluck for now. He proved that every maximal planar graph, equivalently every triangulation of the sphere, is minimally rigid in three dimensional space. Gluck's proof. I'm not going to present, I'm going to present a sort of a four line proof, which is basically a corollary to the theorem we just, the proposition we just had and the theorem of Whiteley we had a couple of lectures ago on vertex splitting. So it's a very simple inductive argument. We already talked about k four being rigid in three dimensions. That's the basis of our, of our construction.
00:10:29.960 - 00:11:08.876, Speaker A: And vertex splitting preserves rigidity. That's Walter's theorem. And the proposition says every maximal planar graph is obtained from k four by vertex splittings. So this is a very simple induction argument. And there's a question, can we not get triangulations from k two and zero extensions? Yes. So, so what I wanted to start with was a free six type graph with e equals three, v minus six. So k two is a weird graph because it has the wrong count.
00:11:08.876 - 00:11:47.264, Speaker A: And so you sort of ignore it when you, it's a subgraph of things. So I don't want to start there. And then I guess, as Sean says, if you're just doing, doing zero extensions, well, if you're doing three dimensional zero extensions on a triangle, you can get k four. So maybe I. Yeah, okay. It seems that William's happy with my answer. Daniel says, are the set of all planar graphs the independent sets of a matroid? That's.
00:11:47.264 - 00:12:36.972, Speaker A: Hadn't thought of that before. A subset of a planar graph is still planar. So you want to do the swapping axiom, I guess if you want to check the independent sets, maybe someone knows the answer to this and can answer Daniel in the chat. Probably you take, take two planar graphs of different sizes. Is there something in one you can add to the other? I'll let someone else either answer that, or Daniel, I can talk with you if you like, afterwards. So this is saying that the planar graphs are nice. And so in particular, if you have a free tight graph, which is not free rigid, that then it contains a non planar subgraph.
00:12:36.972 - 00:13:20.674, Speaker A: So that's sort of an interesting topological aspect to where the bad problems are in three dimensional rigidity. But I thought it's nice to extend this. And so this is kind of a result that I think is not as well known as maybe it should be, because it's an improvement on the result we just said. So Aaron Navo proved that k five minor free graphs are actually all independent in the free dimensional rigidity matriarch as well. So we've just shown that every planar graph is independent. And remember that. So actually, maybe I should first remind, in case anyone doesn't know, if you have a graph g, then another graph, h, is called a minor of g.
00:13:20.674 - 00:14:13.448, Speaker A: If you can obtain h from g by three operations, you're allowed to delete edges, you're allowed to delete isolated vertices, and you're allowed to contract edges. So, for example, any sub graph is a minor of a graph, but also you can have a minor like a triangle lives inside c four. So this is not minus, is not usually something that's so related to rigidity, because obviously in 2d, this would. This one is rigid, this one is flexible, so one's a minor at the other, so it can change. But minors are relate definitely related to planar graphs because of Kuritowski's theorem. So Kuritowski showed that a graph is planar if and only if it has no k five and no k three, free minor. And so the result of gluc that we just talked about is saying that every graph with no k five, or k three free minor is independent in the three dimensional rigidity.
00:14:13.448 - 00:15:00.392, Speaker A: Matriid and Navo basically showed that you can delete this part, so you can just say you have no k five minus. So you widen your class of graphs to include things like k three free. Okay, so I do want to go through how naval did his proof, but the thing that I guess is more interesting to me about is not just that the, the extension, but that k five minor free graphs can naturally, you can naturally think of a similar question in arbitrary dimension. You could think of KD plus two minor free graphs in RD, whereas planar graphs don't easily generalize to our arbitrary dimension. Okay, so I need, I'm going to use vertex splitting in the proof, as navo did. So I need one thing to say about the vertex splitting operation. So what we did.
00:15:00.392 - 00:15:31.540, Speaker A: So here's a three dimensional vertex split again. So this was, say, u, and this is u and u double dash, that's split in two. So this operation, Walter Whiteley showed, preserves rigidity, but it, it also preserves independence. It preserves minimal rigidity, but it still preserves independence if I take away some of the edges here. So if I only did say that it would still preserve independence because it preserved minimal rigidity with that edge. So throw the edge away. They're still linearly independent rows.
00:15:31.540 - 00:15:59.234, Speaker A: So these edges that I put in in the middle, I could have less than or all of them if I wanted to. So that's what I say in this paragraph. So instead of splitting, I've called it x here. Sorry. And joining the two new vertices to d minus one common neighbors, we can join them to at most d minus one common neighbors. So as I say, we don't preserve rigidity anymore unless the atmost is actually equal to. But we still do preserve independence.
00:15:59.234 - 00:16:45.018, Speaker A: Okay, so let's prove navo's theorem. So you showed that every k five minor free graph is independent in free dimensions. Okay, so suppose I give you a graph with no k five minor. If g contains an edge e in at most two triangles, then we can do a contraction of that edge e. Here it's in two triangles, but it could be in at most, we contract e. That's one of the operations in your definition of what a minor is. So we know that if this has no k five minor, then the graph we get from contracting e will have no k five minor.
00:16:45.018 - 00:17:29.804, Speaker A: So we're still in the same class. So if g contagion edge in at most two triangles, then g contract d is k five minor, three, and obviously it has less vertices. So we're set up to do an induction argument. So the fact that vertex splitting preserves rigidity, and this version where we don't have some of these, these edges may not exist, then preserves independence, so would be done by induction. So all we have to do to prove the theorem is show that g contains an edge e in at most two triangles. So as soon as we've done that, we'll be done just by the properties of minors and the vertex splitting theorem. Okay, so how do we show that g contains an edge in at most two triangles? And this must be this.
00:17:29.804 - 00:18:05.308, Speaker A: This is the, the hard part, but it's also the part that goes wrong in higher dimensions. So, so it is worth checking why it's why it's true. So let's go through that, a bit of detail. We're going to need one theorem. So the theorem we'll make use of is due to Maeda in 1968. So he proved that if a graph has no kt plus two minor, then the edges are at most what exactly what you expect in the d type count. So we know if g has no k five minor, then e is at most three, v minus six.
00:18:05.308 - 00:18:40.284, Speaker A: So we're definitely all sparse, so we have a chance. But actually he, he showed this. Damn, I haven't written it here. He did not show this in general, so this is not true in general, so it's true when t is less than or equal to, oh, there might be a lower bound as well. But don't worry about the lower bound, because we only really care about dimensions free and up, so we'll assume t is at least one. Yeah, so if it know k three minor is e is at most one, v minus one. So that's fine.
00:18:40.284 - 00:19:07.034, Speaker A: But the upper bound, I believe it works up to t is five, it might be four. So this number here is either five or four. And we could look it up quickly, but I just forgot to note it down. So it definitely doesn't work for k eight minor free graphs. I've forgotten if it works for k seven, but it definitely works for k five and k six minor free graphs. Okay. Anyway, so let me continue.
00:19:07.034 - 00:19:09.694, Speaker A: So question real quick.
00:19:09.854 - 00:19:23.314, Speaker C: Yeah, that's okay, so is this basically saying that if you don't have a k t plus two minor, then you're independent in the some sparsity matriid.
00:19:24.414 - 00:19:47.696, Speaker A: Well, so it's the d comma, it's the d comma, D plus one. Choose two sparsity, which is not matroidal, but you're independent you're sparse in this count sense. Yes. Okay, so if you just add, change this number, so you are in the matridal range that will have even more edges. So yeah, you would be independent in that sparsity matrix. Yes.
00:19:47.840 - 00:19:49.084, Speaker C: Okay, thanks.
00:19:49.784 - 00:20:24.306, Speaker A: I guess I can say while we're here that this result is nice for these small values, modular me forgetting quite which one, it fixes that. But if I take t to be large, then this result is very far from true. So for t large enough, you can have random graphs where the number of edges is more like average degree is more like two t rather than what we get here. So the average degree can be quite a lot bigger than the count here. So it's no chance of being true generally. Okay, so, hey, Tony.
00:20:24.450 - 00:20:33.094, Speaker B: Yes, sorry, can you explain what sparsity matroid means? Okay, your answer, you, you mentioned that.
00:20:34.354 - 00:21:12.816, Speaker A: Yeah. So see if this. Yeah, okay, good. So we have a little bit of space. So let's say e is equal to kv minus l, so kn are natural numbers and zero is less than l is less than two k. And let's say I of x is at most kx minus l for all x and v such that x is size at least k. So this is the definition of a kl tight graph.
00:21:12.816 - 00:21:47.318, Speaker A: So it's a graph with this count such that this sparsity condition happens for all subsets of the vertex set. That's a kl type graph. It's for this range of natural numbers, l and k. These are the bases of a matriid on the complete graph. So you can think of the independence condition as being this sparsity condition. And then the bases also have this equality. But you notice that, say in 3d, you'd want 3 volts minus six, and this fails.
00:21:47.318 - 00:21:54.874, Speaker A: So you don't quite get a nice matrix all the time, but you do within this sort of sparsity range.
00:21:56.374 - 00:21:58.390, Speaker B: Okay, that was really helpful, thank you.
00:21:58.502 - 00:22:28.156, Speaker A: Okay, so I guess in this course the k will always be d and the l will always be this thing. So it's not in the nice matriidal range, but they are, except when d is one and two. But they are nice graphs. Okay, so remember what we're trying to do. We're taking a k five minor free graph, and we want to show that there is an edge in at most two triangles. So the use of maid is theorem. We're going to use it twice.
00:22:28.156 - 00:23:01.842, Speaker A: The first is because it tells us that e is at most free v minus six. We can apply the handshaking lemma to imply that that guarantees us a vertex of degree at most five. The average degree is close to six, but because of this minus, it's strictly less than six. So that must have a minimum degree at most five. Now we want to show that there's an edge in at most two triangles. So we're going to suppose that every edge belongs to at least three triangles and find a contradiction. Now, contradiction will be to show that g has a k five minor.
00:23:01.842 - 00:23:25.324, Speaker A: Okay, so pick a vertex of minimum degree. Now let's. Let's look straight to here. So I pick a vertex u of minimum degree, every edge incident to u. In fact, every edge in the graph is in at least three triangles. So if I pick an edge e, it's in one triangle, two triangles, three triangles. So that already says there's four incident edges here.
00:23:25.324 - 00:23:55.494, Speaker A: So we know the degree is at least four, minimum degree vertex is at least four and it's at most five from before. So we have two cases to deal with. If u has degree four or degree five, suppose it has degree four. Then I can keep looking at this picture. Now, it's true that every edge is in at least three triangles. So pick an edge incident to you that haven't picked not e. So if I look at this f, then it must be in three triangles.
00:23:55.494 - 00:24:33.032, Speaker A: But if it was in a triangle that went to some other vertex other than the five I've drawn, then that would give another edge to u and would contradict the fact that u was degree four. So it must be that f has some edge to some of the vertex in here, which creates a second triangle, and some edge to another vertex in here, which creates a third triangle. So that gives me the two blue edges you can see and then you can play the same game again on another edge. So let's take g and that forces the edge to this one and you get k five. But k five is clearly not possible in a k five minor free graph. So we're done in the case when the degree of u was four, why.
00:24:33.048 - 00:24:34.712, Speaker B: Did the second red edge have to.
00:24:34.728 - 00:25:12.164, Speaker A: Go to u second red? Oh, so it doesn't. So over here. So what I said was this f here has to be in at least three triangles. That's our assumption. So this edge has to be in a triangle, which means it has to be this vertex, this vertex, and some of the vertex that are all edges. So either it looks like that or these two didn't exist and it looks like that or it looks like that. If it went to some of the vertex outside that I've scribbled out, then the degree of u would go higher, so it has to be the other case.
00:25:12.164 - 00:25:16.092, Speaker A: And it gives me the blue edges like this. Is that okay?
00:25:16.228 - 00:25:17.220, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes sense.
00:25:17.292 - 00:25:17.948, Speaker D: Thanks.
00:25:18.116 - 00:25:37.164, Speaker A: Thanks. Okay, so that's what happens if the degree was four. You get this k five just as a sub graph, and it just sits there. Hence we can assume that our minimum degree vertex has degree five. So it's got five neighbors, x, y, z, w, v. Say, pick one of them arbitrarily. We know the edge between them.
00:25:37.164 - 00:26:13.694, Speaker A: This edge ux is in at least three triangles for the same reason as what we just talked about when Alex, it can't be that there's a triangle like this. So the triangles must include three of the vertices yz, wv. So x has at least three neighbors in this set. But x was arbitrary among those five vertices. So the number of edges induced by xyzw and v is at least three for each of the five. So three times five, but I've double counted, so I divide by two. But obviously I have to round up to get a natural number.
00:26:13.694 - 00:26:51.712, Speaker A: So what I get is that there must be at least eight edges on that five vertex subgraph on the neighbors of u. But on the other hand, we'll show that there can't be eight. So the other hand, we use the minor property. So suppose you had a k four minor on the vertices x, y, z, v, w, then all five of them are adjacent to u. So the k four minor on that subset would give us a k five minor when we include u. So we know there can be no k four minor on the neighbors of u. And so we can apply mater's result from before about k four minors.
00:26:51.712 - 00:27:28.944, Speaker A: So that's the case when t equal two in there. So we said if there's no k four minus at most two v minus three edges, to say that the number of edges induced by the neighbors is at most two v minus three, but two v minus three when v is five is seven. And we just found it had to be at least eight if there were at least three three triangles per edge. So we've got a contradiction, and the contradiction tells us there's an edge in most two triangles. And hence we can apply the simple inductive argument and Whiteley's vertex splitting, and we've completed the proof. Okay, any questions on that proof?
00:27:29.484 - 00:27:31.664, Speaker B: Can you scroll back up to Mater's result?
00:27:32.234 - 00:27:45.814, Speaker A: Yes, here it is. So it's been scribbled all over, but it says, if g has no kt plus two minor and t is in some range, then the number of edges is at most t mod v minus t plus one. Choose two.
00:27:47.674 - 00:27:48.894, Speaker B: Okay, thanks.
00:27:52.474 - 00:28:37.448, Speaker A: Okay, so let me briefly remark that Navo didn't just prove three dimensional result. He also looked at k six minor free graphs in four reals. And it occurs to me that this is telling me the bound, what the bounded material must be, because I also say here that Albar and Gonsalves, in 2017, they dealt with k seven minor free graphs in r five. So k seven minor free graphs must be. Okay, so that tells us what the t was above, but in general. And so Alboro and Gonzalvas work on k eight minor free graphs, and they show, um, there's some, some nice structure to them. But these graphs don't have to be sparse, so it's harder to work out which ones are independent.
00:28:37.448 - 00:28:59.214, Speaker A: So it's harder to work out when the sparsity condition gives you independence more generally. So they, and by the way, both navos proof fit in four reals. It used the same idea, but it was a bit harder. And Alba and Gonzalez did a computer assistance. And so theirs was a bit tricky to proofs. It wasn't. It doesn't continue to be as easy as though the proof I explained.
00:28:59.214 - 00:29:48.732, Speaker A: Okay, so the third and final main aim of this lecture is to give another characterization, but this time for graphs where we control a degree in a certain way. So this time I'm not going to be talking about rigidity, I'm going to be talking about independence. Okay, so this is due to Bill Jackson and T boy Jordan. In 2005, they proved that a connected graph, and the word connected is important here, with maximum degree at most D plus two and minimum degree at most d plus one, if such a graph is independent. In the d dimensional rigidity matroid, if and only if it's d spars. So they showed that the double banana kind of things can't happen if your degrees are nice. So the degrees are quite small.
00:29:48.732 - 00:30:32.970, Speaker A: Notice that this is not a rigidity result. I said this already, but if you're d tight, then the average degree is close to. So saying all the vertices have these degrees. If you were d tight would tell you you were a very, very small graph. But because they're interested in independence and sparsity, you can have as many vertices as you like, as long as they're quite small degrees. The one key point here, as I said, was the word connected, because it is an open problem to extend this to improve the minimum degree to d plus two. So if you want to replace d plus one with d plus two, then that seems to be challenging.
00:30:32.970 - 00:31:08.954, Speaker A: And the reason why connected is needed is for that reason, I think. So if you were disconnected, you could imagine you satisfied all the other conditions by having a, a d plus two regular graph here and a graph here with a vertex of degree d plus one. And then you'd have to understand the complication of this component to get anywhere. So they need the word connected in there. Okay, so hopefully the theorem is understandable for the proof. I want just to make things a little bit easier notationally, but I'm not making any simplification in terms of the actual proof technique. It's just for notation.
00:31:08.954 - 00:31:47.176, Speaker A: I'm going to focus only on the case when d equals free. So what does that theorem say in dimension three? It says if you're a connected graph with maximum degree at most five, minimum degree at most four, then independent if and only if free sparse. Okay, so we know that independent graphs in the 3d rigidity matriarch are free sparse. So all we have to do is look at the sufficiency. But it'll need a couple of lemmas to do this. I think I've got two easy lemmas and one non trivial lemma. So to make this theorem work, okay, so you might remember when we were talking about Lemans theorem, we had critical sets.
00:31:47.176 - 00:32:33.750, Speaker A: So we have the three dimensional version of critical sets. So this is a subset of the vertex set that either it's a small complete graph. So either it's k two, k three, or k four, or it's a set and at least five vertices with I of x is three, x minus six. So these are basically, these are the sets of vertices that induce tight subgraphs of your sparse graph. Okay? Yeah. And I guess, just in case anyone's confused, if you take the size of x to be three or four, then you satisfy both terms in the definition. So I could have just said, talked about k two s here, but this was because they worked with general dimension D.
00:32:33.750 - 00:33:01.160, Speaker A: It was easier. Just what they did was this split. And so I just kept the same notation as in the paper. Okay, so what we care about, we know the minimum degree is at most four. If there's a vertex of degree at most three, we can do zero reductions, or we can add edges and do zero reductions. And so they're kind of easy. So what we really want to worry about is vertices of degree exactly four.
00:33:01.160 - 00:34:10.578, Speaker A: So suppose v is such a vertex, then we're going to think about one reductions at v so remember this is we delete the vertex v and add one edge among the four neighbors of v. And if we delete v and add the edge xy, then we're going to use g, sub v superscript xy to denote the resulting graph. And if we do a one reduction at v in a free sparse graph g, then the one reduction, we call it admissible if this graph gv xy is also free sparse. So this is admissible is when the one reduction actually worked and kept us within the class of free sparse graphs that we want to be in. So we're going to look for admissible one reductions. Okay, so here's a lemma that I'm not going to prove, but it's basically the same argument as we talked about in the two dimensional case. So a one reduction at v adding an edge xy is non admissible if and only if there is a critical set where the end vertices of the edge we want to add are already present in x minus v.
00:34:10.578 - 00:34:53.640, Speaker A: So what we're doing, we're saying here's our vertex v, here's x y, and say the other neighbors are zw. If the edge was already there, this was one of the complete graph cases, then clearly we can't reduce v and add xy because we'll have parallel edges. So let's suppose this edge is not there. Then we need to break the sparsity condition. So there must be a critical set. And this time it's a bit more complicated than the 2d version because in the 2d version, when we were reducing v and we added an edge, we knew that if it was blocking x y, it did not contain the third neighbor z. But this time it could contain one of the neighbors z or w.
00:34:53.640 - 00:35:04.360, Speaker A: So I'm not going to loop it around. It could contain z, it could contain w, it can't contain both, as we'll see, but it could contain one of the two. So there's a bit of an extra complication there.
00:35:04.512 - 00:35:09.240, Speaker B: Does it contain v? Because you write x minus v. Yeah.
00:35:09.312 - 00:36:14.404, Speaker A: So it doesn't contain v. So the critical set lives inside the, basically it lives inside this smaller graph because it's when we delete v, v goes away and we add the edge in, then it causes the problem. So the critical set, sorry, the critical set lives in g, but it lives in this part of g because it's what's going to affect the graph where you've not got v anymore. So yes, it definitely should be an x minus vlog. Okay, so here's a lemma and this is really a very simple lemma, but this is the reason that the degree is going to help us because we can apply this. So if I take a critical set in a free sparse graph, and let's suppose we're taking a critical set with three b minus six edges, not a complete one, then the degree of, of every vertex in x is at least free in the subgraph induced by x. So x is a free type graph itself.
00:36:14.404 - 00:36:52.974, Speaker A: So its degree minimum degree is free. So every vertex in it has degree at least three. So that's easy. But I just do a very short proof anyway, and this is going to be useful because we have maximum degree five. So you can imagine it doesn't take much to turn a degree free vertex into a degree six by looking what else is incident to it in g outside of g induced by x, to find the extra vertices that help you to get a contradiction. And that's what we're going to do in a bit. Okay, so suppose we have a critical set and there's a vertex whose degree induced by that critical set is less than three.
00:36:52.974 - 00:37:36.642, Speaker A: Then we know that I of x is three x minus six. So we just work out what I of X minus X is. Well, it's equal to the number of edges in x minus the number of edges incident to x I of x is three x minus six. This just comes along. But since this is strictly less than three, when we move from x to x minus x and take this away, we get a strict inequality and we have a contradiction of sparsity because we have this set x minus x with too many edges in it. So this is just a very quick computation. But that's really is what we're going to use a lot, and it's used in conjunction with this complicated lemma.
00:37:36.642 - 00:38:13.990, Speaker A: But it's not so complicated. But I don't want to go through the details of the proof of this one. So here we take a free sparse graph with a vertex of degree four, and we look and notice this does not have any other degree conditions. This is a bit more generally. It doesn't need to be quite so general for our application, but this is the statement that they did in the paper. So here we don't have degree risk constraints, but we do have constraints on this particular set. So v is the set of x in the neighborhood of our degree four vertex b, which have large degree.
00:38:13.990 - 00:39:02.824, Speaker A: Okay, and the constraint we put on v is, we suppose that the subgraph induced by v dash is a complete graph, so it could be empty. So there could be no vertices of degree at least six adjacent to v. Or it could be that there are vertices of degree six, but they form a complete graph themselves. Under that assumption, Jackson and Jordan proved there is an admissible one reduction at v. Okay, so I wanted to give some indication for their argument, even though not doing the proof, because it sort of gives you the idea, I think. So you start with your vertex of degree four and let's suppose that it's not admissible. If it is, then we're going to be happy because we'll be done.
00:39:02.824 - 00:39:41.814, Speaker A: But suppose it's not, then GvXY is not free sparse for some reduction. So we couldn't add this edge, which gives us a critical set x in v minus v containing x y, and we have to think about where to go from there. So if, first of all, if z and w are both in this critical set, then we would add four edges and one vertex. And so we'd find that I of x union v is strictly greater than three x union v minus six. So that tells us that at least one of these two vertices, z and w, is not in x. Suppose it's. It's w.
00:39:41.814 - 00:40:14.238, Speaker A: So since w is not in x, we can consider the an alternative one reduction at v which deletes v and adds w y. So we could look at that one instead. Okay, but remember what I said about the degree in a, in subgraph induced by a critical set is at least three. So the degree of y is at least three neighbours. Over here it's got one neighbor to v, so it's got degree four already. And now there's some other thing that's got to happen. It's going to have either an edge to w or it's going to be in another critical set.
00:40:14.238 - 00:40:45.694, Speaker A: So suppose it was in another critical set like that. Then it might have free here, or you might have to worry about how many of these ones were actually in the intersection of these two sets, etcetera. But you can see that it's sort of heading towards having degree greater than five. If they were disjoint, it would be three, six, seven already, and you'd be done. So somehow Jackson and Jordan were in a half, a half a page. Force it to be true that this is not critical. This critical set is an edge like this, or a small complete graph which pushes that edge there.
00:40:45.694 - 00:41:19.836, Speaker A: So let's get rid of a bit of blue. So now we know that edge is there and I've got a count of, what, three, four, five already. So now there's no more. But in this case they force z outside of x and hence they look at the, the one reduction, deleting v and adding z y instead. And again you get an extra edge there that pushes the degree of v of y up to six, which gives you a contradiction. So it's this kind of just locally looking at the degree that they do, I think. I don't want to say any more about that.
00:41:19.836 - 00:41:51.312, Speaker A: So sort of a sketch was written here, but it's really what I said. So you consider the one reduction for this y w, for the one vertex you had outside of the, you knew was outside of the critical set X. This gives you another critical set. You use a maximality argument to force this set Y to be a complete graph. And then you use an argument there to force Z to also be outside. And hence you end up with the degree of Y being too high. But I've said that a bit quickly.
00:41:51.312 - 00:42:28.302, Speaker A: But I just recommend, if you're interested, to look at that paper, because it is a readable proof. I just decided for time reasons not to include all the details. So now I want to go through the proof of the theorem. So we know that every independent graph is free sparse. So we take a free sparse graph, we know it has maximum degree five, minimum degree four, and it's connected. And obviously it's free sparse as well. So we have one of these graphs with all these conditions and we want to show it's independent in three dimensions.
00:42:28.302 - 00:43:03.274, Speaker A: We're going to use induction on b again. We're going to use the zero and one extensions. But because there were several conditions here as well as free sparsity, we have to continue to be connected, continue to have minimum, maximum degree condition. So to apply the induction we have to check several things at each step. Okay, so it's easy to check graphs on the most four vertices they all have degree free. So you can just do zero extensions, say, to show their they're independent. So we can assume that the graph has at least five vertices and choose a vertex of minimum degree.
00:43:03.274 - 00:43:44.374, Speaker A: So we need to know that when we do a reduction, we get a connected graph. So first of all, let's show that if we delete this vertex, then we get a connected graph. So suppose that's not true. Suppose we delete a vertex of minimum degree and we get a disconnected graph. Then it's true that each component is connected, obviously, but the minimum and maximum degree requirements apply to g, so they apply to the components. And because we deleted a, g was connected and we had to delete a vertex to get disconnected. We do get the minimum degree in both or however many parts we have, and we get the maximum degree for free.
00:43:44.374 - 00:44:14.954, Speaker A: So each component is connected with the minimum maximum degree conditions. So it's independent by our induction hypothesis. So that's good. We deleted a vertex of minimum degree, so it had degree at most four. Hence it has degree at most free in any one component. So if I add v to any one of my components, hi the degree of v will be at most three. And hence we can use zero extension to show that hi plus v is independent as well as just hi being independent.
00:44:14.954 - 00:45:07.904, Speaker A: Now we can say g is independent because I take take several somewhere from two up to however many you like independent graphs and intersect them in a single vertex v, then that union will be independent. And again, that's relatively easy. So we know the answer is true if g minus v is disconnected. So we can assume that g minus v is connected. Hence, if the degree of v, our minimum degree vertex was at most free, then g minus v is a connected graph with minimum degree at most four, maximum degree at most five. So it's independent by the induction hypothesis, and hence g is independent by applying a zero extension operation, which we already have seen preserves rigidity. Hence we only have the one case to deal with, the degree four case, which is what the lemmas were for.
00:45:07.904 - 00:45:47.788, Speaker A: So the previous lemma told us that there is an admissible one reduction at v, which will give us a smaller, free, sparse graph. G and g is connected because g minus v was connected and g had maximum degree d plus two. So there is. Notice when we do a one reduction, we add an edge over here. So the vertex, the degree of, say, that vertex goes down from d plus two at most d plus two to at most d plus one. So we do have minimum degree at most d plus one. We clearly have maximum degree at most d plus two.
00:45:47.788 - 00:46:28.264, Speaker A: So again, by our induction hypothesis, g is independent, and hence g is independent by our one extension preserves independence result. So that will complete the. The proof. Okay, I guess I went relatively fast through that. If anyone has any questions. Okay, so then, just to finish off, let me again advertise that next week. Sorry, next week on Wednesday, Sean Dew will talk about complete bipartite graphs.
00:46:28.264 - 00:46:54.344, Speaker A: And then I believe on Friday I will switch focus to global rigidity. Later in the course, we'll come back and talk about frameworks on the sphere and other things related to higher dimensions. But after Shaun's talk, I'm going to switch the focus to global rigidity instead of rigidity to give you a number of lectures on that topic. So I will stop there and happy to answer any questions if you have them.
00:47:00.284 - 00:47:06.460, Speaker E: By the way, we resolved some, some of us resolve that question of planar graphs being a matroid.
00:47:06.572 - 00:47:08.564, Speaker A: It's not, it's not.
00:47:08.724 - 00:47:09.396, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:47:09.540 - 00:47:11.024, Speaker A: So what's an example?
00:47:11.564 - 00:47:33.170, Speaker E: Yeah, so Sean noticed that if you have two triangulations, or one triangulation and you remove an edge, there are only two edges you can move back to get a triangulation, either that same edge or the opposite one in the four cycle that you created, and then you can construct. I mean, it's pretty. I can just send you the file with an example. But, um. Yeah, and that was Sean's idea.
00:47:33.322 - 00:47:44.330, Speaker D: But, yeah, you, you. Yeah, you basically make sure that those four vertices are not connected by any edges in the other triangulation. And then there's no way you could do the basis exchange axiom. That's it.
00:47:44.362 - 00:47:46.434, Speaker A: That's a shame. Would have been a nice matriarch.
00:47:46.514 - 00:47:47.682, Speaker E: Oh, yeah, would have been.
00:47:47.738 - 00:47:52.690, Speaker D: My first hint was I just googled planar graphs as matriarch and nothing came up. So.
00:47:52.802 - 00:47:53.330, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:47:53.442 - 00:47:53.778, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:53.826 - 00:47:55.690, Speaker E: If it worked, someone would have figured that out, right?
00:47:55.762 - 00:47:56.634, Speaker D: Yeah, I feel like.
00:47:56.674 - 00:47:57.294, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:00.834 - 00:48:20.794, Speaker C: Well, I guess since we already know that they're not matriids, this pointless. But I was just wondering, how would you even phrase the basis exchange question in that setting? Because you'd have, what, a smaller triangulation and a larger triangulation, and I wouldn't understand what you would be adding in the first place.
00:48:20.954 - 00:48:43.254, Speaker E: I mean, it's like the same as with a rigidity matriarch, right? Like your ground set is just the edges of some, some complete graph. And so you would take two triangulations on the same vertex set and remove an edge from one and then ask, is there an edge from the other that you can add back into this triangulation minus an edge to get another triangulation?
00:48:44.554 - 00:48:44.890, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:44.922 - 00:48:59.324, Speaker D: So the smaller triangulation wouldn't be a basis, a base in this, because you can always just that you'll have one vertex that's not connected to the rest by edges. So you need to throw those extra edges in some way to triangulate it.
00:49:00.104 - 00:49:03.884, Speaker C: Okay, I see. Yeah, that makes sense.
00:49:04.224 - 00:49:11.968, Speaker A: So there are generalizations of matrix, right? So what, one is either they don't work either.
00:49:12.136 - 00:49:21.408, Speaker E: No, because the thing that makes a greedoid, not a matriid is not the exchange axiom. It's the second axiom. And this satisfies the second axiom.
00:49:21.456 - 00:49:44.144, Speaker A: Yeah. But there's more than just greedoids, right? So there's also delta matroids, which don't work because they, that generalization is saying bases can have different cardinalities, but that's not going to work. And there's polymatroids, but that's not going to work either. So I guess I was going to say maybe we can come up with some generalization of matrix that does work for planar graphs and then play with that object, whatever it is.
00:49:44.264 - 00:49:46.216, Speaker D: But I think the basis exchange axiom.
00:49:46.240 - 00:49:48.234, Speaker A: Is like the important part of it.
00:49:48.384 - 00:49:49.302, Speaker D: If you just have a load of.
00:49:49.318 - 00:49:50.638, Speaker A: Sets that are the same size and.
00:49:50.726 - 00:49:53.550, Speaker D: You don't really have anything, I don't.
00:49:53.582 - 00:49:54.154, Speaker B: Think.
00:49:55.854 - 00:50:02.714, Speaker D: Unless you can weaken it somehow. But I don't. You weaken it quite a bit because you're saying that sometimes you can, but usually you can't.
00:50:03.174 - 00:50:04.594, Speaker A: Simplicial complex.
00:50:06.294 - 00:50:07.838, Speaker D: Maybe, maybe go for something like that.
00:50:07.886 - 00:50:23.852, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean it is, but it is a simplicial complex. But I mean, that's a pretty weak, I mean, yeah, it's a pure d dimensional, or a pure three n minus six dimensional simplicial complex.
00:50:24.028 - 00:50:28.476, Speaker B: Maybe you could say interesting things about the geometry of that complex.
00:50:28.620 - 00:50:36.500, Speaker D: Yeah, so someone's saying triangulations of marked surfaces could be cluster algebras of finite type, but I don't know what they are.
00:50:36.572 - 00:50:50.534, Speaker A: But no, sorry, I don't know what cluster algebras are in any good sense to answer that one. Maybe if any of the algebraics could jump in and comment there.
00:50:55.554 - 00:50:57.494, Speaker E: Oh, I don't really know anything about.
00:50:57.874 - 00:50:59.374, Speaker A: Beyond my scope.
00:51:02.194 - 00:51:24.394, Speaker C: So I'm curious now. So your independent sets are planar graphs in this potential matroid? Yes, yes. Okay, so you take a independent set and then you take a subset of that. You're saying that there isn't always an edge we can add to the subset that would preserve independence.
00:51:25.934 - 00:51:32.190, Speaker A: So I think Daniel put a picture in the chat. Yeah.
00:51:32.222 - 00:51:54.852, Speaker E: So this is with basis exchange. So there are two graphs on the same set of vertices, both of which are planar. And if you were to remove the edge down the center in the first graph, then there were only two edges that you could add back to make it still maximal. Planar that edge and then the other edge across that square.
00:51:54.948 - 00:51:55.468, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:55.596 - 00:52:03.304, Speaker E: Neither edge is a member of or. Yeah, neither edge is a member of the other graph.
00:52:07.994 - 00:52:09.494, Speaker A: That's a nice example.
00:52:10.714 - 00:52:23.454, Speaker C: Oh, so you've just, you've relabeled the. Oh, I was thinking one had to be a subset of the other. Okay, I'm combining two axioms here. Okay.
00:52:25.274 - 00:52:25.698, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:25.746 - 00:52:31.714, Speaker E: And this was, this was Sean's idea in generality. I just wrote up a specific example.
00:52:34.014 - 00:52:35.734, Speaker C: Right, okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
00:52:35.894 - 00:52:52.366, Speaker D: You've done it on four vertices. Six vertices. So maybe it's true for like four or five vertices. I mean, it's gonna be true for four, just trivially. So maybe five is not a problem either.
00:52:52.510 - 00:52:52.766, Speaker A: But.
00:52:52.790 - 00:52:56.114, Speaker D: Yeah, you'd have to pick very small triangulations to make it true.
00:52:56.674 - 00:53:07.890, Speaker C: Yeah, it makes sense, though. You can take like just two radically different triangulations of a point set, delete one edge, and, like, you'll most likely not be able to add any other edge from the other triangulation.
00:53:07.962 - 00:53:10.734, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, that's the, yeah, that's the idea.
00:53:14.834 - 00:53:19.226, Speaker F: I can explain what I meant by cluster algebras, if you're interested.
00:53:19.370 - 00:53:20.334, Speaker A: That would be.
00:53:21.034 - 00:54:29.604, Speaker F: So there is some algebra, and in order to construct sort of a generating set for it, you write down a collection of seeds. And there's a nice combinatorial collection of cluster algebras where the seeds are these triangulations of a surface with marked points on. So for instance, if you've got this I know sphere and you've marked points on it and you triangulate it, which are, I guess this same as triangulation, like these maximal planar graphs. Then there's this nice mutation thing that's defined in cluster algebra, where you go from one seed to another by you take the quadrilateral inside your triangulations with one line through it, and then you swap where that line is. So each line in your triangulation defines a quadrilateral, and you just swap it to get a new triangulation. You go through and, and all those, all those seeds generate the same cluster algebra, you know, some way.
00:54:30.784 - 00:54:34.044, Speaker D: So they're, I think is what Bob calls them.
00:54:35.304 - 00:54:46.964, Speaker C: They're generally called diagonal flips or diagram flips. Yeah, but so you're saying, uh, the cluster algebra, there's like a relation between that and the flip graph of a.
00:54:48.844 - 00:55:12.984, Speaker F: Well, in order to find the generating set of your, like, cluster algebra has a potentially huge generating set. In order to find a generating set for it, you have to do all possible flips. If you've got a marked surface, though, there's only finitely many flips that you can do or only finitely many triangulations. So you get a finitely generated cluster algebra.
00:55:13.164 - 00:55:18.804, Speaker B: Um, so do different marked surfaces correspond to deign diagrams?
00:55:19.144 - 00:55:40.762, Speaker F: Yeah, you, well, you can start off with a dinking diagram and start doing flips. Uh, and start doing sort of, yeah. Yeah. This is. This is like one of the main things. There's like a classification of, uh, cluster algebras that have finitely many generators and finitely many relation. Yeah, finitely many relations.
00:55:40.762 - 00:55:48.298, Speaker F: I'm not sure of the best way to say that. Is that. Oh, yeah, you go for it.
00:55:48.386 - 00:55:52.494, Speaker E: I was gonna say, is there a clean way in which a cluster algebra is a generalization of a matroid?
00:55:52.954 - 00:55:59.734, Speaker F: Not that I'm aware of, but it would be really cool if there was a link, I think. I've never heard of any link between them.
00:56:00.634 - 00:56:25.002, Speaker E: I've heard. I've heard someone say once, and this is a while ago, so maybe details wrong that, like, the elements in, like, a basis for a cluster algebra are all algebraically independent. So it seems like maybe there's this larger matriid lurking. And then your generators are like certain bases, but not all bases. I mean, I don't know.
00:56:25.058 - 00:56:45.494, Speaker F: Yeah, that's it. So you start off with some, like, algebraic generators, and they're all in algebraically independent. And to get the other ones you do there, the rest of the generators are all Laron polynomials in those set of generators. And. Yeah.
00:56:47.994 - 00:56:59.814, Speaker B: If you google planar graph cluster algebra, you get a lot of things about cluster algebras that definitely say planar graphs in them. So it seems like there are connections.
00:57:03.654 - 00:57:04.434, Speaker E: Oh.
00:57:11.854 - 00:57:26.914, Speaker C: This is, I guess, now very unrelated to the lecture, but I have a question then. Do you know if there's, like, any relation between triangulations of lattice points and cluster algebras?
00:57:35.504 - 00:57:38.924, Speaker F: You mean by just z?
00:57:39.384 - 00:57:51.804, Speaker C: Yeah, you could take like, z two or. Or like the triangular lattice or something like that. I guess you're talking about of surfaces. So I don't know how related it would be, but.
00:57:53.484 - 00:58:12.076, Speaker F: Yeah, I'm not too sure. Surfaces are nice because your triangulation, each edge is like a diagonal of a quadrilateral. So there's a. The important thing for a cluster algebra is the mutation. It should be something that takes you from one seed and applying the same mutation should take you back and.
00:58:12.220 - 00:58:13.244, Speaker C: Right, okay.
