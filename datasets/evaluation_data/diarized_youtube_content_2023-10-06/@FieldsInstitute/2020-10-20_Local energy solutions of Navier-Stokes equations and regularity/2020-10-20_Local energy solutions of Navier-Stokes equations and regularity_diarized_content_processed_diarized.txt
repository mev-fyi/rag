00:00:02.040 - 00:00:56.450, Speaker A: So now the first slide is my collaborators Zach, Igor, Kyung Geun and Hanju. So it's a summary of several works, but all of them are considered with local energy solutions. So there are four parts of my talk. The first part is the introduction, local energy solutions. And the second part is on global existence between Ao two and a zero, two uniform local. And the third part is for global existence beyond Ao two uniforms will decay, and the last part will be unstudy of regular regions for local energy solutions. Introduction so we study Nafier stuff equations.
00:00:56.450 - 00:01:37.516, Speaker A: So we do everything in the whole space, three reals, and the time is from zero to infinity. We have an integer theta v zero, and we know that its cost system if we drop this nonlinear term, two properties of NAFTA Stokes. The first one is the applied bump. We test the equation by 2 volts this global energy inequality. And this is the same estimates as the stock system. So the near term drops out because of this anti symmetry property. And we don't have equality because equality is not preserved under weak limits.
00:01:37.516 - 00:02:12.542, Speaker A: We only get the inequality after weak limits. And then here's a local version. It's a local energy inequality. So we multiply, we take the equation by two v times the cardinal function, and phi should be non negative. And then we get this localized version and we still have inequality. And this is very essential because this allows us to localize energy estimates. And then we have, we are able to do regularity criteria.
00:02:12.542 - 00:03:04.114, Speaker A: And this was originated by the, by Schaeffer and then perfected by cavalry Cole. And remember, the second property is the scaling invariance. So we define this rescue function v lambda by this formula. Then if v is a solution, this guy is also a solution. And then look at the change of electrocute law under scaling, and the l three norm is only scaling inferior norm. And so related to the scaling property is self similarity. A function is so similar if it equals to its scaled version for any lambda and then its value decided by its value at any time moment.
00:03:04.114 - 00:04:04.552, Speaker A: And I would say this discretely, is so similar if v equals v lambda for one particular choice of lambda bigger than one. And there are three kinds of self similar and discrete self similar solutions. One is backward from mass infinity to zero. So this was proposed by the ray. And then we have forward self same solutions for positive time up to infinity, and then stationary solutions is no time and natural bounds for the solution is c over one plus x. And then our v solution should be infinity in time and the uniform bounded in x and x should be scaling in variant spaces containing this function, like l three weak, and the molar space m 21, etcetera. Now we review what is known about existence.
00:04:04.552 - 00:04:25.964, Speaker A: We do everything in three reals. The first one is the lowest weak solution. So for any v zero and lo two, there's a global weak solution. It's based on the energy inequality. The second thing is a strong solution. We have a higher regularity and the solution is better. And it is also used energy inequality.
00:04:25.964 - 00:04:57.754, Speaker A: The third is a mild solution. So this is either in h one half or in q q bigger than or equal to three. Then there's a solution in finite time, t I will take t to be infinity if it's l zero three and l three no is small. So loq has less special decay, but has a higher regularity. And we treat language term as a source terminal. The structure is not important. It's different from energy in quality.
00:04:57.754 - 00:05:34.484, Speaker A: And there are many extensions. So we can consider Lorenzo spaces. And we have global solutions for small data in the scaling inference. So this one is the basal space, this is the emo mass one local tata space. And then another extension is in Lq info local. So locus local is defined by this norm. We look at Lq norm over unit ball and we take a super over the center exercise, any point under three reals.
00:05:34.484 - 00:06:14.112, Speaker A: And then Simone is needed for if q is one three. But then we don't have global solution because we don't have any decay in this norm for the heat, for the heat evolution. So this thing is always local time. And then there's cardone's global solution. So he considered v zero to be loq q between two and three. So his idea is to compose b zero as two parts, where a zero is small in l three and b zero is large, but it's in L two. So it is localized in a sense.
00:06:14.112 - 00:06:47.884, Speaker A: And then the solution v is equal to the sum, where a is the amount of solution is a small mass solution for this small initial data. And bt is a weak solution, but it's over a per turbulence. So this idea was essentially used to control local energy solution. So it was pioneered by the Mahi lucia. The details given by Kiguchi and Seruki. So their results are the following. So first, if v zero is in l two, informed local, then there's a.
00:06:47.884 - 00:07:39.652, Speaker A: There's a local in time solution. Second, if v zero is in e two, so e two. So eq is the subspace of loq in local, like the locue finishes as the center goes to infinity. So if this has this decay there's a global in time solution. That strategy is similar to C catalog. So we first we use this solution to control local solution, and then we choose a good time q one and then decompose via t one to two parts. And a zero will be small but it's small in l three uniform local, and then b zero will be large but b zero, it will be l two.
00:07:39.652 - 00:08:07.824, Speaker A: And then this allows us to do finite time extension. And when we repeat this process. So this is the, this is the strategy. So now I give more details about local energy solution. So there are six conditions. So v has to be l two local in space time, and then the initial data is l two info local. And sigma means divergence free.
00:08:07.824 - 00:08:59.836, Speaker A: So first we have this bond. So we look at the local energy over any power by sinker center x zero for time between zero and r squared, and they will take soup over x naught. And this thing will be uniform bounded in x naught. So this is the first applied bound assumption. And second is that there's some pressure term which is also you have local and satisfied equation distribution sense. And second, a third one is convergence to integer data in any complex set. Number four is the local energy inequality, and number five is that it's the weak continuity against any complex supporting function continuity.
00:08:59.836 - 00:09:49.414, Speaker A: Number six is the pressure decomposition. So for any x naught and any radius r, we can find a function of time only and we can decompose the pressure as this, this terms. So here, this node space dependence, and this part is basically a local part. So this is computed over the ball center x naught. This one is the far fewer part is outside the ball. But then when we do this computation, we have to subtract the k at x naught, mass y. And here the whole thing, this equality makes sense in l three, in this parabolic center, and this k here is the kernel.
00:09:49.414 - 00:10:37.932, Speaker A: It's the gradient squared of the fundamental solution. So here are a few comments. So the class local energy solution is useful because it contains both arrow two and arrow three weak. So it's a space where both weak solutions and mass solutions deep. And second is that the local engineering quality is valid and it allows us to do local analysis. And third, we have applied bond, so it's number one here, and right hand side depends on a number depending on intel data. In that case, we had to have a put a lambda here, lambda here, and lambda has some limit.
00:10:37.932 - 00:11:13.904, Speaker A: So it's not all time, but we have some, some applied control. And then the project composition is useful because when we do this l two uv local theory. We either has no decay or it has a not decay rate. So we want to be able to define this in a meaningful way. We need to do this. So this is introduction and now a second part. The global distance between l two and l two inform local.
00:11:13.904 - 00:11:56.052, Speaker A: The goal is to contract global solutions in space between e two and l two with some explicit decay. The motivation is that e two is too large. We want a smaller solution class which is large enough to contain forward self similar solution. And the second solution is that the smaller class only in smaller class. We may have eventual regularity. So special means that solutions which is regular after a certain time. I will say more about this in part four, but this is the idea.
00:11:56.052 - 00:12:22.014, Speaker A: Solution is regular after a certain time. And so the non global result, the first one is the calculus result in LLQ q. Between all this should be q, but in 23. And the second result is biserating and spheric. So it's not do everything arrow three. But this is large data, it's not small data. And idea is to decompose solution as the.
00:12:22.014 - 00:12:55.554, Speaker A: This is the profile and plus the tail and tail will be in the energy class. And the third one is Bucker Syracuse rack. We do l three infinity. So this is important because this space contains zero sigma solutions. The first result is by Britain and Barker. They do this in basal space. And so I want to talk about the winner basis e to q.
00:12:55.554 - 00:13:23.946, Speaker A: The loan is defined by this. So we compute l two loan over a unit ball as set k, and k is the lattice point. And we compute little q loan over all lattice point k. This is the definition of this. E two q norm. The motivation for this is to decouple the local regularity and the global decay of a function. So we are going to do an e two q.
00:13:23.946 - 00:14:03.914, Speaker A: We can talk about e p q, but for us one locally one arrow two, because that's enough for our local energy inequality. And then e two q cubed should be bigger than two, but less than six less than infinity. So we have some decay, but not water has some decay, but not as weak as l two. So, here are a few theories by Zach and me. So v two is e two q. So first we establish global existence for all q between two and infinity. And second we prove apply estimates.
00:14:03.914 - 00:14:33.126, Speaker A: So here this is local energy I set rk and the scale is r. And then there's a time tr. So this is the local energy I set k. And then we do this ll over two, because idea takes gradle here but this lq over two. And this thing is bounded by the initial size in e two cube. But this is scale one. So this at a scale r.
00:14:33.126 - 00:15:03.714, Speaker A: And this is this r factor here. And this time tr goes to infinity. If q between two and six, six is not included. So this give us a second way to contract global solutions. I will say more about this in part three. But the so, so the part one here use the strategy of the Mahi reset is by repeated finite time extension. And this one would be by a sequence of applied bonds.
00:15:03.714 - 00:15:36.804, Speaker A: The third result, eventual regularity is q is between two and three. We don't include three. We do include three, but we don't include l three. Weak. So this is related to the conjecture of a singular discretely self similar solution. If we have a singular discretely self solution, then solution will not have eventual regularity and it will not have initial regularity either. But then it is at the bottom line of these three here.
00:15:36.804 - 00:16:40.084, Speaker A: So this give us a primary of solution. Spaces between l two and l two evolve local. Do you increase your so far? I don't at the moment. So the pre print I've uploaded. So this is pretty new, but. So I think we are going to have some follow up, but we don't quite know at this moment. Okay, now part three, there's a global existence beyond l two in local.
00:16:40.084 - 00:17:25.104, Speaker A: So we first recall what is wrong. So if v zero is in l two info local, then we have local entire existence. But if v zero is in e two, so it has some decay phase law, but some decay, then we have global in time existence. And the open question is like do we have global existence for v zero, which is l two infant local, but not in e two. So v two has no decay. And there are many natural solutions. They don't have spatial decay.
00:17:25.104 - 00:18:12.104, Speaker A: So first we have constant flows and then we may have time dependent, especially periodic flows. And then we have a two and a half dimensional flows. So we first look at the two dimensional flows in two reals and then we add a third component and to match the equation and the four is that we can also consider the perturbations of these things. So this solution, we already know they exist, but then wipes evil to perturbation. Presumably we still have a solution, but at this moment we don't have a theory for this. So this is motivation. So want to want to find a theory which at least give us perturbation of this.
00:18:12.104 - 00:18:55.904, Speaker A: But okay, this is the main thing in this part. And there are many part of results so far. But I want to first mention two approaches, so, which I mentioned earlier. The first one is to decompose the flow as a profile cross the tail, and where the tail should be, should have some decay. So either it is in some localized place like infinity loq. So this was considered in part two, for example, q arrow three or l zero three width. And the second is that this tail is not in Lq, but maybe it's in e two.
00:18:55.904 - 00:19:42.696, Speaker A: So and instead of this better field, we can consider some other quantities, maybe not e two itself, but these quantities has some arbitrary slow decay. But then this will still allow us to construct solutions locally in time. And then we can then do this repeated finite time extension. So this is the first strategy. And the third strategy is to find a sequence for finite time, the price bounce for t raise tk and such that tk goes to infinity as k goes to infinity. And then we can do, we can touch and solutions in one week limit. We don't need to do this repeatedly.
00:19:42.696 - 00:20:11.714, Speaker A: We just do this in one week limit. We do solutions in finite space time. But then the space time is enlarging, it's occupying the entire spacetime. So far, these are two approaches. So the first result is in this category. Okay, global results for non decaying data is by the Mahi lucet. So she considers v zero in m 21.
00:20:11.714 - 00:20:41.096, Speaker A: So this is by a sequence applied bounce, because this is more space. And then you have, you already have applied bounds in l two inverter for this v zero. But then you visualize m two one. You can look at is rescale version. But for the rescale version we also have a prior bounds. And then we can, we can rescale those applied bounds back to v zero. And then the tk will converge to infinity.
00:20:41.096 - 00:21:38.514, Speaker A: So this is the first such result, more space and second result is more recent by Marie Monty and Simuzu. So the result is that the condition is that v zero should be infinity and gradient physio should be able to the whole space and q is between three and infinity. And the strategy is to decompose v as a sum. This sum is a profile plus tail, which is w. And this vk, this, this sequence, this, this summing here, vk plus one should solve vk per turb non historic equations with the first term vk. And this, this ghost thing here, this boss term here should have beta and beta decay. When k increases in the end, w will be in the energy class.
00:21:38.514 - 00:22:14.084, Speaker A: So vk is getting better and better in terms of decay. And the third result is by Hangzhou and me last year. So our condition is that v zero should be e two sigma plus l three, even local. So this part here has no decay, but we require enough regularity. So it's at least l three. So l three for local. And then this guy plus a decaying part in e two sigma.
00:22:14.084 - 00:23:08.210, Speaker A: And this part is okay and this is a new part and it will require oscillation decay. So we look at the, this integral here over four one and naught and v zero minus is average in this ball. So this, this interval here measures the oscillation of v zero in this ball. And then when the, when the center goes infinity, this oscillation goes to zero. So in this case, v zero does not need to be, does not need to have finite limit at the spatial infinity. The VCL can have many weird behavior at spatial infinity. The only thing we require is this oscillation decay.
00:23:08.210 - 00:23:56.036, Speaker A: And this is useful because this oscillatory decay implies that the gradient of the solution of heat equation with this intro data has spatial decay. That's because of smoothing effect of the heat evolution. And then this oxygen decay becomes the gradient decay. So this is the first condition. And the second, the second thing is that if VCO is a perturbation of a global solution, so v is a global solution and infinity, you know, Q infant local, q pick and three. So v has to be a solution of Navier stocks, another of stocks. It's a solution rapid stocks.
00:23:56.036 - 00:24:35.314, Speaker A: And then we do a perturbation in e two. So this guy has a special decay and then we have global solution. So this is a perturbation. So this answers the question number four here, perturbation of global solutions. We have global existence. So two and three Msc. So this use repeated fine height extension.
00:24:35.314 - 00:25:28.420, Speaker A: Number four is more recent, uh, by Zach and me. So b zero in auto info. But then this interval here over four x naught, if I divided by over r squared should finish at a special infinity. So, uh, so this is two, this is now one. So this, uh, this makes this finishing easier, right? Because we have a bigger denominator, so it's easier to finish. And then if we have this, we can have a sequence of applied bonds. And the fixed result is by Fernandes cargo and Lemahi bucet.
00:25:28.420 - 00:26:07.838, Speaker A: So initial result, the condition is that b zero, this weighting integral of v zero should be finite. It's important to note that this condition does not require v zero to be no two uniform local. So this is something beyond l two uniform local. And this theory gives a new construction of this created self similar solutions for data in l two local. And we have to compare these two conditions, they don't imply each other. So these two results are disjoint. And this is the most recent result.
00:26:07.838 - 00:26:52.784, Speaker A: So it's accepted, but not published yet by Zach and Igor and myself. So we now look at the integral, but now the integral, this is similar to this integral here, but the center is zero. We are not taking text loop of x naught here, we are just doing this thing at zero. And if this thing is vanishing, then we have a global solution. And the idea of all this, I'm sorry, the idea of four and six is by a sequence of applied energy bounds over. And for this particular one it will be over dilated cubes. Say that more in later.
00:26:52.784 - 00:27:35.556, Speaker A: But this result contains both four and five. So so far, this is so far is the best result. So now I want to explain what we have here. So this condition, we look at the diatic cubes. So here my xy is the set of diode cubes of sn is diode cube of side two n. So this ring of cubes is s one. And this ring of cubes is s two.
00:27:35.556 - 00:28:18.146, Speaker A: So this is a 2d picture, but you have, you can look synthesis 3d picture similarly, and this ruin of cubes are h three. And then we have the middle guy here. And so this entire thing is my c zero. So cn is the union of all sn for k bigger than or equal to n and including the middle guy. And then this is basically the rescaled version of c zero. So this is my family of cubes. So you can see that this is a decreasing family of cubes, not counting this guy, don't count this guy.
00:28:18.146 - 00:28:53.710, Speaker A: Then this part is decreasing family. So basically we're just gluing the inner guys together at each step. And then we look at this norm v zero m two cn. So this nimitz here, this node is the soup or all cubes in this cm family. And then this integral here. So this is nonre type integral. And this two here correspond to this two here.
00:28:53.710 - 00:29:25.904, Speaker A: And these two here correspond to this two here. So we can define similar things for other exponents here. But for us two, two is is correct. We can show that the limit of this node here as n goes to infinity. So we are looking at decreasing family of cubes. This limit is zero, if only, if our condition here is zero. And then for this, over these families of cubes, we have this applied bound.
00:29:25.904 - 00:30:31.592, Speaker A: So this is energy bound and we are doing this. So we do. So this part is, this, this l two norm over these cubes in cn and, but we are taking this and then we do the soup over every, every time is up to time tn and then the same part is the gradient part. We compute this integral over q up time tnt and we have a correct thing here, the power of the size and then the q offered in this family. And this is bounded by the initial size. So this is, this is a energy bound, but the place, this is the scale of the cubes here depends on the distance of the center to the, to the origin. So this is not a uniform space estimator.
00:30:31.592 - 00:31:06.404, Speaker A: This is, this is a center in this thing here. And then, uh, the tn here can be computing this way. And, and then this guy is going to zero by assumption. And so the entire scene is going to infinity. So I think this applied is quite interesting. So do you have any question? There is nothing in chat, but if anybody has a question, you can unmute yourself. Okay, so.
00:31:06.404 - 00:32:03.694, Speaker A: Comments so the global residence problem for general data in electric new voltage is still open. But then selsima solution may live outside of l two local. So we have several previous results by Dong Ho Chi and the Wolf, by Zuck and myself and by FD and LR. And then third comments that local energy associates are also contracted in the hype space by Mykawa, Mura and branch related to this question here we want to look at the equivalence of local energy solutions. And the mild solutions will be zero in this space without decay. And this is quite delicate. So dark and meat proof is under some regulatory conditions and the difficulty to analyze the pressure decomposition in the distributional sense.
00:32:03.694 - 00:32:47.884, Speaker A: So that's the comment for this part. And the final part is regular regions. So we are also doing this for the local energy solutions. So first, what is life? The study of regular regions is to identify the regions, like any solution of a given data must be regular. So this regular region depends on your data and the solution class. But does that depend on the choice of solution? So in principle, the solutions may not be unique. So we are saying that the solution, all solutions for the same data should be regular in these solutions.
00:32:47.884 - 00:33:34.856, Speaker A: So there are many examples. The first one is eventually grati in the race original paper. So there's a time t depending on your data, such that any the very whole solution with this data must be regular for t bigger than capital t. And the second result is in the serum d of Calvary called r. So the most famous result of the paper of Caravari Cooper is their serum b, one dimensional terabyte household measure of a singular set is zero. But. But we have also series c and D here, series.
00:33:34.856 - 00:34:10.622, Speaker A: That is existence is not any solution. So there's a suitable, suitable means satisfying local energy in quality. There's a suitable rate of big solution, which is regular above this surface. So here is this. I made this ugly picture, but it's basically is a set, is a abstract. But before, above this surface, if this weighted norm is finite, so this is x. On the other hand, if we put x in a denominator, we have.
00:34:10.622 - 00:34:42.834, Speaker A: We have solution in above this paraboloid. And then this is under assumption that this is small. And then also this is existence. And the fourth result is the far field regularity. He says that there's a radius r such that any suitable solution is regular. If x is bigger than r, I actually put epsilon value here. And this is for any t.
00:34:42.834 - 00:35:20.034, Speaker A: So I think this is also true for local energy solutions. But then, uh, but then, uh, this r will have to depend on capital t, and this t has to be less than capital t. So we have such results. So. So you can see, like, maybe it's not something new, but it's a. But there's only one extension of this theory. I forgot to include the difference.
00:35:20.034 - 00:35:43.318, Speaker A: And so now I want to mention the result. So, first one is work with Zach. So we have a small parameter, epsilon one. So if v is a local energy solution. And then if this soup here is less than epsilon one. So now this. What is this soup? We look at this scale the too long.
00:35:43.318 - 00:36:13.100, Speaker A: So this is getting inference. We can look at this scale, no, over radius r, I will take soup of x naught. But then if I look at only a large radius. So if this thing for some, uh, for a larger nerve is less than epsilon one, then v is regular. For t bigger than r one squared. So this is eventually regularity result. On the other hand, suppose our condition is that this is true for r, this is zero reals.
00:36:13.100 - 00:36:37.520, Speaker A: This is only for small scales. If this thing here is small for small scales, then phi is regular. For t, this is r zero squared. So this is initial regularity. And the following is the localized version. So this extends secant c and d. So.
00:36:37.520 - 00:36:53.568, Speaker A: So now we assume visa is l two info local. And then we have this weight here, x to power alpha. This is finite. And there are several cases. The first case, alpha is minus one. And then v is regular in this region here. This.
00:36:53.568 - 00:37:13.544, Speaker A: This. This upper part here, because we are doing this for local energy solutions. It's not the real weak solution. We have very weak control. But then we don't require, we don't require simonis. And this is any solution. It's not existence is any solution.
00:37:13.544 - 00:37:41.752, Speaker A: And the second condition is up between minus one and zero. It's negative but not up mass one. And we also need to have some magnetic at large scales. So then v is regular for t bigger than something like this. So it's similar to. I didn't draw a picture. It's a purpose something which is like a paraboloid.
00:37:41.752 - 00:38:18.678, Speaker A: But then it doesn't, it does not touch the origin. So this thing is spatial because it touches origin, but this shape does not touch the origin. And the number three is that if alpha is bigger than zero, it's regular above this singular surface. So this extends sequence theory. Again, this is for any solution and then this is for local energy solutions. And then the previous theory is based under the gradient criterion here. So this reliability criterion extends this result.
00:38:18.678 - 00:38:44.124, Speaker A: I will mention this later, but here's a statement. So here we assume that some usual energy bounds of velocity and the pressure is finite. And this is a key assumption. Look at this scale norm centered at zero. For up between zero and one. One seems to be small. So if NGO is small, so this is center at origin.
00:38:44.124 - 00:39:30.824, Speaker A: Then there's a time t such that v is bounded in this region. So it's in this straight region. So the lower bound is perpendoid, the upper bound is a finite time t. And then this is regular solution is regular inside here. So again, it's important that this region touches the origin and we suppress. So this similar theory was done earlier, but this data, this condition is different. So it was first time you visual in arrow three plus in four, two by giants forec and extended by ourselves in arrow three and by Barker and branch in arrow three week.
00:39:30.824 - 00:39:53.714, Speaker A: I see any here. I think they also need smallness here. So this is, this. Can this include all the previous result? And then this is pretty. Okay, this, this is, this is new. And we're still trying to understand this thing here. But it's a.
00:39:53.714 - 00:40:33.034, Speaker A: This is localized version. And another consequence of this theory is the. The study of a singular time. So assume we have a singular solution, single solution and the t is the singular time, the first singular time. And then the first result is that we have this thing here, this scale long, this scale long over ball of radius proportional to t by t and then divided by this. Take soup of x. Now this has to bigger than a small constant for all time.
00:40:33.034 - 00:41:07.330, Speaker A: Slightly less than the singular time. This is about a low bound of probabilities. And this thing here is the localized version. So we have to look at a singular point. Suppose the singularity at the origin, and we assume that the singularity is type one in this sense, then we can, this thing here, we can do this at center, at the origin. We don't need to text through, just do this at the origin. And then this thing had to be function below.
00:41:07.330 - 00:41:19.114, Speaker A: So this says early result of B. Ozawa one and Parker branch. And so that's the end of my talk. Thank you very much.
