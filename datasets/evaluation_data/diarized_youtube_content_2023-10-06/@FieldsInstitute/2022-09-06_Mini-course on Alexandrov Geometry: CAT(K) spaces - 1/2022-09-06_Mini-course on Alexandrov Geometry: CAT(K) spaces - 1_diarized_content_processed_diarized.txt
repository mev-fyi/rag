00:00:00.360 - 00:00:33.192, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Okay, let's start. All right. It's my pleasure to introduce Alexander Licheck from Karl's Roy Institute of Technology, who give a mini course consisting of three lectures on Alexandra from geometry cat k spaces. And so this is in preparation for the. For the workshop on geometry of spaces with upper and lower heritage bounds, which will take place next week.
00:00:33.192 - 00:00:59.794, Speaker A: I hope everybody attending is aware of that. So, thank you very much, Alexander, for agreeing to do this. Please go ahead. Yeah, thank you very much for the introduction and for the opportunity to give this series of lectures. So, I'm sorry, I could not. So very unfortunately, I could not come to Toronto and to do this in present. So I.
00:00:59.794 - 00:01:20.314, Speaker A: Yeah, I do what I can. So I also apologize to the experts. So there will be nothing new in these lectures. So, yeah, so let us start. So let's start. Okay. So, yeah, we start with the plan.
00:01:20.314 - 00:02:16.356, Speaker A: So, the plan is very simple. So, the first two lectures will be about very general definition, basic properties, characterizations and a few basic tools used in the theory of spaces with curvature bounded above. And the last talk will be about spaces with upper curvature bound at extendable geodesics. So, Vitaly has asked me to talk about this. So, the whole lecture series is a kind of advertisement for two books by Stephen Alexander Vitalikapovich and Anton Petronin on Alexandria geometry and particularly on Kaziro spaces. The second book and two papers by myself and Koichi Nagano. So I should also say that I don't see many of you now, so if you have questions, questions are very welcome.
00:02:16.356 - 00:02:48.294, Speaker A: You should better interrupt me. Yeah, somehow. So otherwise. So Vitaly is monitoring the chat, so he will interrupt me, but you can also do it on your own. So let us proceed according to the plan. So the very short history of the subject. So I think Anton, who is giving the larger and the second part of this lecture on Alexander of geometry, he will.
00:02:48.294 - 00:03:19.056, Speaker A: One of his lectures will be about history of Alexandria geometry. So I just call a few names. So there was a kind of prehistory. So before Alexander, before the definition we will work with was given. So it started with Kaus, in my opinion. So who studied surfaces and who recognized. So that curvature has a lot to do with angles on the surfaces of triangles.
00:03:19.056 - 00:04:08.634, Speaker A: Then Riemann, Qatar and Hadama, they have proved what one can call in the terminology. I will introduce kind of globalization theorem in riemannian geometry, non positive curvature. And then there were other developments in metric geometry, generalizing non positively curved manifolds. So in particular. So Bozeman and why it should be called here. So then the foundations of their theory were laid by Alexandrov shortly after second world War. And then, so the so called russian school Rezy Tnyak and many, many students of Alexandrov or Nikolayev Blastowski.
00:04:08.634 - 00:04:55.594, Speaker A: So they have, so they have laid the basics of the theory. But yeah, it was not. Yeah, there were not many people working on this theory and it was kind of used for. Yeah, the theory for, for its own sake. So it has not been used very much outside. And then, so the modern period started with Mitzgramov, so who popularized the subject and showed lots of directions where this theory could go. So, and then there are so many names after him, so that I have not listed them.
00:04:55.594 - 00:05:38.856, Speaker A: So, on the theory of non positive curvature, papa, curvature, balance. So it has a very broad range of applications, so to name a few. So these algebraic groups regroups, or this, these applications, they were already known to catan group theory. So it's a very flourishing part of algebra and geometry. There, non postilicov spaces play a very important role, but also. So in PDE's, in topology and other subjects. So even in applications, non positive curvature plays some role.
00:05:38.856 - 00:06:26.308, Speaker A: But I will not. So, yeah, I will not talk about applications. So actually, originally four talks were planned, but then due to holidays or to some other talk, so the fourth was canceled. So would be about applications, but now it's not here. So let us start with mathematics. So we start with euclidean geometry, the so called Alexandrov silemma, which is at the very basic of, at the basement of all theory of non positive curvature. So it's a rather elementary statement in euclidean geometry.
00:06:26.308 - 00:06:54.504, Speaker A: So we have a euclidean quadrangle, which is concave at the point p. So I will draw it now. So it looks like, you know, I hope you can see it. Can you see it? Yeah. Okay, so if you don't see the quadrangle and. Okay, so I think it's this. Yeah.
00:06:54.504 - 00:08:12.464, Speaker A: Okay, so that's the quadrangle, concave at the point p. And now we draw a triangle with the same side length as that one. It's also in the euclidean plane. So what you should think of you, just so that this first picture is movable, and you take the point p and move, and you move it so downwards, until the connection between x and p and p and z becomes straight. So, and now Alexandrov Slemmer can be formulated. So the easiest statement is that the distance, so f here, distance between y and p and y prime and p prime. And on the right hand side statement, it's larger and on the left hand side is shorter.
00:08:12.464 - 00:08:58.294, Speaker A: So it's kind of obvious if you think about it. But if, yeah, but, yeah. So the correct proof, so it really needs some lines. Now there is a strengthening of the statement and that's the following part. So we have a canonical map from the, the degenerate quadrangle on the right to the general rectangle quadrangle on the left. So and here by quadrangle I just mean the boundary. So we have the map which sends x x bar to x y bar to y and so on.
00:08:58.294 - 00:09:32.534, Speaker A: And the connections, the segments to the segments. And the statement is that this map is one dipshit. So if we take two points on the side. So I write. So maybe that's not so good here. There, here. So then the distance on the right is not less than the distance on the left.
00:09:32.534 - 00:11:13.904, Speaker A: That's again not so obvious. But this and even the stronger statement which I will state now they, so the strongest version of Alexander's lemma is the following statement that you can enlarge this map so which sends x bar to x y bar to y, z bar to z, p bar to p to one lipschitz map from the Jordan domain of the quadrangle on the right. So I will put the quadrangle on the left. So it's not so straight now. But now I have called this cuba and here skew and I have this map and this map is one dipshit, so it does not increase distances. So the first statement is the special case of second, the third special, the second special case of third. So is other questions so far.
00:11:13.904 - 00:11:49.454, Speaker A: Can you take I hat to be an extension of I? Does it coincide with I on the boundary? Yes. Yes, it has to be, it has to be an extension. So just because the distance between x and y, it equals the distance between x bar and y bar. So this part of the boundary has to go isometrically. So the boundary has to go the same way. Yes. So I bar it in stack, it extends I exactly.
00:11:49.454 - 00:12:32.254, Speaker A: Further questions? Okay then some comments. So on the last slide, so there are three statements. So the first one was that the distance between y and p is not larger than between y bar and p bar. Then the second one was that on the whole boundary the distances are shorter, are not larger. And the third one that you can extend it to the interior. So it's obvious that three implies two implies one. In fact, there are other implications.
00:12:32.254 - 00:13:31.336, Speaker A: So also the fact that from that proving so this more stronger statement so that you can extend it to one. Leibniz map from the whole Jordan domain. It follows from the so called Kirchbrown's theorem, again, the euclidean version of it. We will see another version of it later. And it tells you the following, so that whenever you have any subset of the euclidean space, you have a one Lipschitz map from this subset, again, to the euclidean space. Then this map extends to a one Leipschitz map of the whole euclidean space. And to get an implication one to three, we just consider the map from the three points for the four points x bar, y bar, z bar, p bar to x, y z.
00:13:31.336 - 00:14:09.094, Speaker A: The statement one, in just a statement that this is a one lipstick map, and then the only one Leibniz extension must do what we need. So in this sense. So if you try to prove three directly, it's a little bit delicate, but. So if you believe in Kirsch Brown's theorem, then this is a way around. Okay, is it. Other questions to this, to this slide. So, until now, it is just euclidean geometry.
00:14:09.094 - 00:15:00.248, Speaker A: So not, there are no. Sorry, did you say what a is? A is any subset. So for any subset of rn and any one Leipzig's map, you can extend it to the whole line. Thanks. Okay, so here we apply it to the four point space consistent of x bar, y bar, z bar and p bar. Okay, so now we come to cut two definitions of spaces with curvature bounded above. So again, I apologize, probably most in the room know what I'm talking about, but nevertheless, I, I give the definition.
00:15:00.248 - 00:15:30.928, Speaker A: So we start with the complete geodesic metric space. So the completeness is definitely known. And geodesic means that you can connect every pair of points by a segment isometric to an interval. So the segment is called the geodesic by a curve isometric. So a triangle in a metric space, three geodesics. So, which I denote by x. Y is a drodesic between x and y.
00:15:30.928 - 00:15:58.560, Speaker A: Y. Z is y and z and zx. So this is not, this may be confusing. So the geodesic might not be unique, but. Yeah, we just. So a triangle is a choice of three geodesics between three points. And then for any triangle, we have a comparison triangle in the surface of constant, which couple.
00:15:58.560 - 00:16:22.364, Speaker A: So I make. I'm sorry, I make here, drawing. So here is. This is x, y z here. So. And if you have never seen it, so then always think that kappa is equal to zero. And then the m two kappa is r two.
00:16:22.364 - 00:16:58.844, Speaker A: Otherwise. So for other copper, it's the surface of constant curvature, copper. And for positive copper, you need a little bit of care, because then large triangles are not defined. So we have, so for any triangle, we have a comparison triangle. This is a triangle with the same side length. And this is uniquely determined up to, up to an isometry of m two. So, and we say that.
00:16:58.844 - 00:17:29.368, Speaker A: So when we have a canonical map here, there. And this is called. Yeah, we call it I delta. Yeah. So it sends the segment between x bar and why to the chosen geodesic between x and y and so on. And now they call this triangle on the left, we call it Kappa, called kappa thin. If this triangle is one Diepsch.
00:17:29.368 - 00:18:32.584, Speaker A: So, meaning again, so that if we take any pair of points on the left, on the right, and take the corresponding pair of points on the left, then here we have a distance that is on the right. So in the plane, the distance is not shorter than in our triangle. And we say that our space, now this is the main object about which the lecture school say that the complete geodesic space is cut Kappa. So it has curvature globally bounded above by kappa. If, if all triangles are kappa thin, so if any triple of geodesic. So going this way. So from x to y, from y to z, from z to x, so cyclically, the corresponding triangle is kappa thin.
00:18:32.584 - 00:19:24.626, Speaker A: Are there questions? Okay, can I ask a question? Yes, sure. If the condition is satisfied for all three points and the shortest zone, is it satisfied? Sorry. Yeah, that's a very good question. So, for me, geodesics are always minimizing. So here it's not geodesics in the sense of romanian geometry, where you see that the geodesic is a locally distance minimizing map. So here the geodesics are always minimizing. Okay.
00:19:24.626 - 00:19:52.280, Speaker A: If it's satisfied for one. So that's another very good question. So it's not true that if you have, for any triple of points, you have three geodesics connecting them, so that the triangle is thin, then your space does not need to be cut. Kappa doesn't need to be cut Kappa. So don't need to be cut. Zero. If you compare it with your glide on plane, that's a non obvious statement.
00:19:52.280 - 00:20:09.270, Speaker A: So a count example, if you would try to do it by hand. Yeah, it would take a while, but. So if you know what the space is, then it's easier to see that it is a count example. If you don't know what it is. It's. Yeah, yeah, you. Yeah, it will be fun.
00:20:09.270 - 00:20:43.390, Speaker A: Will be fun to learn what it is. Was it the question? Yeah. Does it answer the question? Hi, I. Okay, yes, that question has been answered. I have another one typically, really concerning the basic definition. So typically I see the definition of cut k space, where one of these two points that you pick on the triangle coincides with the vertex. Something like the median is short.
00:20:43.390 - 00:21:01.390, Speaker A: I wonder whether it's equivalent or it is. Yes, it's equivalent. I think I will, I will also say that, yeah, I hope. Yeah, yeah, I think, yeah. So maybe I forget to say it later. So I say it now. Yes.
00:21:01.390 - 00:21:53.616, Speaker A: So that's true. So you don't need to. So it's equivalent to saying that all triangles are thin in the sense I have stated, or to say that for any triangle, just the distance between a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side is not a larger in the triangle. Yeah. Other questions? Comments? So very basic examples and very basic comments. So we will see much more examples later today. So the most basic example are the three spaces of constant curvature, constant curvature minus one, of curvature one curvature zero.
00:21:53.616 - 00:22:16.944, Speaker A: So the hyperbolic space, it cut minus one and cut zero. Sorry. Yes, cut minus one, cut zero and cut one. So the eugradian space is cut zero, so it has curvature zero. It is also cut one, not cut minus one. Finally, the sphere is cut one and not cut zero, not cut minus. So in general, cut kappa.
00:22:16.944 - 00:22:45.648, Speaker A: So the condition of being cut kappa becomes stronger and stronger if kappa becomes smaller and smaller. So says curvature is not larger kappa globally. So if you just believe this formulation, then it becomes clear. So, and this is, yeah, this is not very, yeah, so this is very easy to see. And this is in coincidence with the picture you usually draw. If you draw a spherical triangle. So it looks like this.
00:22:45.648 - 00:23:57.540, Speaker A: So this is an sn and the hyperbolic triangle looks like this. So an hn, this is much thinner. So the euclidean, the hyperbolic triangle is thinner than the euclidean triangle and this is thinner than the spherical. So then another basic observation is that just because if you rescale the surface of constant curvature, Kappa, you become this surface of constant curvature, one over lambda square times kappa. So there, so that if you take a space, then it is cut kappa, if not only if there is scaled space, if you take the same set and all distances, you just rescale by the factor lambda is a cut one over lambda square times kappa space. So, and by this rescaling, it's clear that only three values of kappa meta, namely kappa plus minus one and kappa equal to zero. So the final comment is the following.
00:23:57.540 - 00:24:46.310, Speaker A: So that most of the theory does not depend on Kappa. However, there is one very important exception. So due to this exception. So most of people who are doing cut spaces, they work on cut zero spaces on non positive curology. And this important exception is the fact that there is a globalization theorem we are going to talk about, and there is a version of it for positive kappa, but it's not very powerful. So, unlike the Lauer curvature bounds, as you will learn by Anton. So there, the globalization theorem holds equilibrium well for all kappa.
00:24:46.310 - 00:25:38.172, Speaker A: So in upper curvature bounds, there's a very large distinction between positive kappa and kappa zero or non zero. So. And due to this fact, so the cat one spaces, they play only, they often play just an auxiliary role. So if one wants to understand something about CaD zero, so then one is sometimes forced to use one spaces. So, basic properties. So we stick to the case kappa equal to zero. So other cases are very similar, just so the conditions become slightly more complicated.
00:25:38.172 - 00:26:22.626, Speaker A: And one very important distinction is that for kappa equal to one. So, any conclusion you draw is only about distances which are at most PI. Yeah, which at most PI. So for distance larger than PI, you have no condition. So, the very basic statement about cut zero is that the geodesics are unique and that they depend continuously on the end point. So they are unique in the sense that they are uniquely defined by the endpoints. And this is very easy to see.
00:26:22.626 - 00:27:28.794, Speaker A: So, if we add two points, and if they are connected by two geodesics, we just take the following configuration. So we take the midpoint z of one geodesic at the midpoint p of the other. And so we assume that they really look like this, so that p and z do not coincide. So otherwise we continue this process and we find such a picture. And here we have a direct contradiction, because if you take the comparison triangle, then the comparison triangle is degenerate. So here z bar is equal to p bar, and so the distance on the left must be not larger, so it must be c. So the say so essentially very similar argument proves that geodesics depend continuously on the endpoint.
00:27:28.794 - 00:28:26.484, Speaker A: So, if you take two points, x and x one which are close, y and y and y one which are closed, then the statement is at the whole design between x and y and x, one and y one are close. And this we do in two steps. So, we first consider the triangle xy x y one. And we see that the geodesic x y one is very close to the geodesic xy, just because it is the case in the comparison triangle, where one side has a definite length and the other side is small. And then they compare this middle with the geodesic on the right and see that they are also close. And so this implies also that the whole space is contractible. And also.
00:28:26.484 - 00:29:05.332, Speaker A: Okay, we will also see in a second, also balls in the space are contrast. So this is a very strong topological restriction on this space. And this happens only in the case of non positive curvature. In the case of curvature one there, of upper curvature one. So for cut one spaces, there are essentially no global restriction on the topology. So you can, I will mention it also later, but I can also say it now. So due to result of Berestowski and Gromov, any simplistial complex carries a metric.
00:29:05.332 - 00:29:46.356, Speaker A: So carries a cat one metric. So globally, the cat one property doesn't have any topological implications. Are there questions? Sorry, I'm just trying to sort this out. So, for example, if I look at the flat torus, it's cat zero, I suppose. No, no, no. So the circle is not cat zero. So that's.
00:29:46.356 - 00:30:04.008, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is, yeah, this is a little bit. So this is confusing. So this is, this. So this lecture is about upper curvature bound. So we are now talking about upper curvature bound zero, but. So it's about global curvature bound zero. So we are.
00:30:04.008 - 00:30:51.522, Speaker A: So here. Yeah, we will. So I will state this theorem of Qatar in a few seconds. So in, in this language, it will say that riemannian manifold is cut zero if and only if it has non positive curvature and is simply connected. So the torus, and even so, the circle, the circle is not cut zero, just because, just because geodesics are not unique. So if you take a point and it's antipode, then they are connected by two geodetic. So in the circle and also on the torus, so the circle and the torus, they are non positive.
00:30:51.522 - 00:31:19.644, Speaker A: They are locally non positively curved. So the small, small triangles there are thin, but large triangles are thick. So for instance. So maybe for such a degenerate case, it's maybe less obvious, but if you take. So it's maybe more visible. It's better visible for this triangle. If you take here x, y and z.
00:31:19.644 - 00:32:30.864, Speaker A: So then the triangle looks like a spherical triangle. So it's very thick. Does it answer the question? Thank you. So this is the first basic property, second kind of basic properties. It concerns angles, which were also at very origin of Alexander's theory of non positive curvature. So in order to see what, sorry, what the angle is, so we take three points in our space, x, y, z, and if they assume they are connected by geodesics, and so we take the comparison triangle. So three points in the space of constant curvature zero.
00:32:30.864 - 00:33:35.414, Speaker A: And there we take this angle and equality, the Kappa comparison between the points x, y and z. And now we define what the real angle is between the geolesics xy and yz, namely. So yeah, we run on the geodesics xy towards y, on the geodesics zy towards y as well. So we take here point, say x t, here point zs. And we consider the comparison triangle of this smaller triangle. And here again we have an angle. So we can, we can in fact write this, this comparison angle.
00:33:35.414 - 00:34:26.246, Speaker A: So this is this angle. So we can write this angle just by the, by the cosine formula. So if we do it in, in the plane and for other kappas, then they use the plane, the trigonometric formulas in the sphere or in the hyperbolic plane. And now we let the distances t and s go to zero. So we take small and small triangle and look what the angle converge to. If it converges or something, then we call it the angle between these two geodesics y, x and yz. And now, so the observation is that in a Kadkata space, first of all, the kappa compression angles, they are monotone.
00:34:26.246 - 00:35:01.320, Speaker A: So if we consider this compression angles, and if we go towards y, then the angles become smaller and smaller. Sorry, I'm confused by the notation. So you have a kappa superscript on one of the angles and not the other one, is that. Yeah, this is a very good question. So yeah, on the other side, it is independent of kappa on the left hand side. So this angle, if it's defined for one kappa, it's independent, then it's defined for other kappa. So it's independent of the kappa.
00:35:01.320 - 00:35:50.164, Speaker A: And the point is that if you take small triangles in a surface of constant curvature, then for, if they, if you take a very small triangle on the plane and the triangle with the same side lengths on the sphere, then they have almost the same angles. So the defect of a triangle, it is measured by the area, by the gaussian formula, by the area of this triangle. So it becomes smaller and smaller. So here we just, so yeah, at the end. So we know that the angle is defined for all copper. But so using the kappa from the curvature bound, it is more natural. Yeah.
00:35:50.164 - 00:36:43.452, Speaker A: So now the Kappa comparison angles, they are monotone. This is rather clear because just by very definition of, of cut kappa, say the distance between x, xt hat and. Oh, sorry. This is z and z and z as head. This is larger than that. And here this is equal to that. And so both triangles on the right they are triangles in the constant curvature.
00:36:43.452 - 00:37:16.954, Speaker A: So here we have two small triangles with two equal sides and the third side is larger. So the angle is larger. So if we go as we see it on the picture. So if we go from x to y and from z to y on this trodesic. So then, statement that this triangle is thin tells you that the comparison angles become smaller and smaller. So this is monotone and the angle in particular. So the angle exists and is always not larger than the comparison angle.
00:37:16.954 - 00:37:59.354, Speaker A: Questions about angles, comparison angles and line? No more questions. Okay. Then the third. Ah, so. Ah, okay, so I should say, so the angles, they exist. And we have the first variation formula. So the first variation formula tells us how.
00:37:59.354 - 00:39:05.848, Speaker A: So if we take one point x, another point y, and we start on the point y running on a geodesic towards the point z. And now we want to understand what is the distance between x and a point which is close to y and which goes on this trio descript, then we have the same formula as in the euclidean space. So the distance between x and y s is equal to the distance between x and y plus the angle is alpha. So it's given by the angle. So here is minus plus so minus osilis alpha times s plus s. So we have the first formula of variation. So this makes the angles important.
00:39:05.848 - 00:40:01.354, Speaker A: So in particular, so it tells you that if the angle, so if you have a right angle or if the angle is at least PI over two, then going in such a direction, you increase the distance. This is related to the third, what they have called basic property and which is probably, which I maybe should have called first. So this is the most important property of cut zero spaces. This is convexity. So, and the, the very, so the meta statement is that, so in any sense, the cut zero spaces are as convex. So they're distance. So whenever you have something which you can express in terms of convexity of the distance in the euclidean space, you can the same expression in any cad zero space.
00:40:01.354 - 00:41:38.414, Speaker A: For instance, closed balls are convex. Why this? So this just tells you if you have a point, if you have two other points, and if this is, if this distance is smaller than r, this distance smaller than r, then on any point on the geodesic the distance is also not larger than r. Yeah, this is because just you take the same comparison picture and you know that the distance from, yeah, I should call, I should have called this not y. So from any point on the geodesics, x z is not larger than the corresponding distance in the comparison triangle. So slightly, so slightly more advanced statement is that the whole distance function is convex. So this you can restate in a more down earth term just by saying if you have two geodesics, xy and xy x one, y one, x two, y two, you take the midpoints, then the distance between the midpoints is at most one half of the distances between the boundaries. And this is also very easy to prove.
00:41:38.414 - 00:42:04.262, Speaker A: So we just connect xy and y two. Sorry, again just a notational comment. So you're using absolute value as the distance function in an arbitrary space. Yes, yes. Sorry, I should have. Right, yeah, yeah, thank you. Yeah.
00:42:04.262 - 00:43:06.854, Speaker A: So we take the midpoint, now this is not really the midpoint. So try to let us see, we take the midpoint of the schlodesic and then they consider this one, my m one, m and m two. And we consider the triangle x one, y two, x two. And in this triangle we see that the connection between the midpoints is not larger than the connection between the midpoints in the comparison triangle. The comparison euclidean triangle connection between the two midpoints has exactly length one half of the third side. So it tells you that mmy two, the distance from m to m two is at most one half of the distance between x one and x two. Similarly, from m and m one.
00:43:06.854 - 00:44:11.486, Speaker A: And then we use triangle, just the triangle inequality to estimate m one. This is from m one to m two by the sum of m one to m and m two. M two, m two. Okay, any questions so far? Then another version of convexity, and this is really, this is an equivalent statement to being cut zero, is that the distance function is what is called too convex. So here the meaning is, if you restrict the square distance function to any point, you restrict it to any geodesic, then its second derivative in the weak sense is at least two. Okay, but if you have never seen sort of what lambda convexity is, just say so. The distance function is s convex is an r two.
00:44:11.486 - 00:45:25.934, Speaker A: And this is by the very definition of what thin triangles are. Another very important convexity property, which is very widely used in cut zero geometry, is that the distance function to a convex subset is itself a convex function. And whenever we have convex subset, then the footpoint projection. So for any point there is a unique point on this convex subset, which is the closest point to the point x. And the distance between x and y is not less than the distance between x y x one and y one. And this is, this is very easy to see also by the, by the, using the first variation formula and the convexity statement, I just have said. So you consider this connection.
00:45:25.934 - 00:46:20.496, Speaker A: Then, this connection line segment is in the convex set by the definition of convexity. So since y one is the closest point going on this geodesic, we cannot come closer. So it tells you that this angle, alpha one here, beta one, so tells it alpha one and beta one are at least PI over two. Otherwise the first variation formula would contradiction. So. And now we use another version of the first variation formula. And we consider the distance function between the geodesics x one and x and y one and y, where they parameterize them with constant velocity on the interval from zero to one.
00:46:20.496 - 00:46:53.262, Speaker A: Now, the convexity tells us that this distance function is convex, and the assumption on the angles tells us that the derivative at the origin is non negative. This is the first variation formula again. And then the convex function which starts with positive derivative and grows. So it tells us distance between x and y is at least as large as the distance between xy x one and y one. So, yeah, I should say so. I hope it's not too confusing. So I.
00:46:53.262 - 00:47:09.606, Speaker A: So I prove. Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to prove some things which can be proved. Yeah. In a very short time, and I just keep others. So, yeah, I hope it's not confusing that I. Yeah, that I am.
00:47:09.606 - 00:47:43.646, Speaker A: Just prove what? Yeah, just something more artificially chosen. Okay, other questions so far. So this convexity, the convexity of cut zero. So this is the most, the most important property of cut space. So, and then this convexity, so it has a. Yeah, so there's a form of it in cut minus one and cut one spaces, but they are more complicated in cut one spaces. They.
00:47:43.646 - 00:48:20.884, Speaker A: Yeah, very much less useful. Okay, so I would like to end today's lecture with an important theorem, the Scheidt next theorem. Then discussing a couple of examples. So, gluing theorem of the shedneck. So it starts. So before I'm saying what a theorem is, I start with the lemma. Ah, so, yeah, it all appears on the same side.
00:48:20.884 - 00:48:53.912, Speaker A: Okay, so first disregard the theorem. So the statement is. The statement of dilemma is very simple. So we take a triangle in a metric space. So here, uh, the only. Yeah, so mostly our spaces. So all x which appear will be cut zero, unless I say explicitly that it is not the case.
00:48:53.912 - 00:49:29.994, Speaker A: So here it's in general space. So we don't know at this moment that it is zero. So it's a statement about arbitrary triangles. So, and here's the statement. So if we assume we have triangle and a point on the side, and we assume we have a connection between y and this point, the opposite side. The assumption is that the small triangles, that these two small triangles are kappa thin. Then the statement is that the whole triangle is kappa thin as well.
00:49:29.994 - 00:49:52.294, Speaker A: So the connection of the triangles, if the connection. So if the connection happens like this. So that. So that the point may become. Is on the geodesic. So. And the proof is very, very easy.
00:49:52.294 - 00:50:17.334, Speaker A: So here it is. So we take. So here we see Alexandrov's for the first time. Most important time. Yes. So we consider the comparison triangle of the. Of this ion.
00:50:17.334 - 00:51:09.914, Speaker A: I have drawn it too large of the small triangle. And we take another comparison triangle and put them. Yeah, and put them together along the common side. Now we make the following observations. So that the triangle on the right, that it must be concave at the point B bar. So otherwise we would find a point on the side on the geodesic y bar, p bars on the euclidean plane, such that the connection between x. So, such that the.
00:51:09.914 - 00:52:03.774, Speaker A: So, otherwise, the segment between x bar and z bar would intersect with the other diagonal. And then using the assumption that the small triangles are thin, we would find a point on yp such that the distance from x to this point plus the distance of z to this point is shorter than distance from x to p plus z to p. And this would contradict the fact that this is a geodesic. So the picture is really like this, the comparison. So if you put the two comparison triangles together, then we see a quadrangle, which is concave at p bar. And now we use Alexander of Slemmer. So the two pictures on the right, so they are in the euclidean plane.
00:52:03.774 - 00:52:36.772, Speaker A: So we have one lipstick map here. Here's one Lipschtz. And the fact that we have here one lipstick map from the whole. So from the whole Jordan domain. So it implies that then we combine this map with the two maps. So with the map. So with the one Lipschitz map from the Nayan.
00:52:36.772 - 00:53:14.854, Speaker A: So from the small triangle in the middle to the small triangle on the left and from the other one. And this gives us the one Lipschitz map from the right to the left and proves that the large triangle is one lipschitz is thin. So maybe it was too fast, I hope. Yeah, it was at least a bit understandable. So where the Alexander of slema appears here. Sorry, I have a question. Is there a kappa here is positive or is there any.
00:53:14.854 - 00:53:28.096, Speaker A: So there's no difference. So there's no difference. So it works equally for all kappas. The only difference is that for. So for kappa positive. So for. Okay, so there are three kappa.
00:53:28.096 - 00:53:59.894, Speaker A: So zero, one minus one from zero and minus one, it works completely the same. From kappa equal to one, the same works. Unless your triangles are not too large once they become large. So in the sphere, triangles of perimeter larger than two, PI do not exist. And this is a technical problem, so you should prepare. But otherwise it works equally for all colors. So, a bit confused.
00:53:59.894 - 00:54:22.698, Speaker A: If the picture on the left is, say, also on the euclidean plane, then the triangles. No, no, no, sorry. So, yeah, the picture on the left is in the metric space. So this one is in a metric space. So this is a triangle in the metric space. And we want to say if it's thin or not. So thinness.
00:54:22.698 - 00:54:38.762, Speaker A: We want to understand. So we want to. How do we. Yeah, so we want to. So we want to. We have a triangle x, y, z in the metric space. And it consists of two triangles.
00:54:38.762 - 00:55:08.728, Speaker A: So it's subdivided by a chord in two triangles. So what I'm saying is, suppose it is. Suppose the metric space is the flat r two. So those triangles would be zero, thin. Yeah. How can we conclude that it's a concave point, P. Okay, so, yeah, this would be.
00:55:08.728 - 00:55:39.704, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So I always, so I very often say something is shorter, something is concave, something is larger than PI over two. So it's always non sharp. So here by concave, I mean concave or straight. So if it's in the euclidean plane, then this middle triangle would just be the same picture and also the third one. So. And the whole map would be the identity and it would be one lipschitz.
00:55:39.704 - 00:55:57.088, Speaker A: And nothing goes wrong. If it's, if it's on, say, the sphere. No. So on the sphere. So the following goes wrong. So on the sphere, no triangle is kappa thin. Okay.
00:55:57.088 - 00:56:15.442, Speaker A: Oh, no. So. Oh, you mean for kappa equal to one. Yes. So if we do, for kappa equal to one. Ah, sorry. Okay, so for kappa equal to one, the picture, the two pictures on the right, they are in the constant, in the surface of constant curvature.
00:56:15.442 - 00:56:42.750, Speaker A: So they are in the sphere. So for kappa equal to zero, we compare with the euclidean plane. For kappa equal to minus one, we compare with the hyperbolic plane. So all the comparison triangles, we draw them in the hyperbolic plane for the. So there is Alexandrov's theorem for sphere. Yes, yes, yes. So there is exactly the same Alexander.
00:56:42.750 - 00:57:13.412, Speaker A: So exactly the same statement holds true for all kappas. For all kappa. So Alexander of slemma, in the free, in the three versions I have stated, holds true for all kappas. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so, and now we use this lemma to prove the following theorem. So that if, following gluing theorem of the chicken, it tells us the following.
00:57:13.412 - 00:57:56.844, Speaker A: So if we take two cut zero spaces or cut kappa spaces, and assume that they share, so that they have. Sorry. Yeah, I have drawn it. Yeah. So, yeah, so that they have, that each of them has a subset which is convex. So here's a one, here's a two, and they are isometric each other. And then assume we have chosen isometry, then we can, if we glue two spaces along this isometry, then we obtain something like.
00:57:56.844 - 00:58:57.444, Speaker A: And the statement is that this space is that this space is itself cut couple. And the proof, the proof is very easy. Namely, how do triangles look in this glued space? Now, they look like this. So they, so either the three points sit on one side and then the corresponding triangle is thin anyway, or two points are on one side and one point is on the other side. Here's x, here's y, here's z. And then we can subdivide this triangle into three triangles. So p one, p two.
00:58:57.444 - 00:59:44.394, Speaker A: And then first we see the triangle p one, p two. Z is thin because it sits in the cut kappa space x two. The triangle p one, x, p two is thin because it sits in the, in the other half. So the whole triangle, by the, by this lemma sits in the. So the whole triangle x, p one, z is thin. And then we apply this gluing glamour again and see that the triangle x, y, z, that the whole triangle is thin. And so, from the thinness of the triangle on each side of the picture, we conclude that all triangles in the whole space are thinners.
00:59:44.394 - 01:00:09.450, Speaker A: So, yeah, I'm very sorry, but also, my time is over and I postpone the picture the examples to the next time. There is a question here, somebody asking me if AI's are closed. Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah. So the subsets should be closed. Yeah, sorry. Okay.
01:00:09.450 - 01:00:27.344, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry. So the examples. Yeah, okay. Yeah, next time. Yeah, other questions, more questions, please. So, in the proof of the lemma, you said that e bar, the comparison point e bar will be convex. Why do you say that? Can you just.
01:00:27.344 - 01:00:49.150, Speaker A: Sorry, it's, it's difficult. Could you please repeat it? It's about the lemma, or it's about the theorem. It's about the lemma. It's about the lemma. You said that the, the comparison point p bar will be convex, right? In the comparison triangle. So why is that? You just repeat that. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:00:49.150 - 01:01:05.494, Speaker A: It's, uh. So here is x, y z. Here's p. So. And here we have x. So assume it is not convex. So assume it does not concave it here.
01:01:05.494 - 01:01:43.964, Speaker A: Then it looks like this then. Okay. So we also assume it's not concave at Y bar, but, you know, so we don't care about this. So then we have these two diagonals and they intersect at this point, m bar. We have the corresponding point m on the geodesic yp. And by assumption, the two small triangles are thin. So we have that this is not larger than.
01:01:43.964 - 01:02:24.590, Speaker A: Sorry? Yeah. That this is not larger than that. And this is not larger than that. And so the sum of the distance from x, m and m, z is not larger than the distance from x bar minus m bar plus m bar, minus z bar. And this is, again, strictly smaller than the distance from x. So this is a. This is a shorter segment.
01:02:24.590 - 01:02:35.664, Speaker A: So it's shorter than this. This. Yeah. Okay. This strict inequality is key. So this strict inequality. Yes, yes.
01:02:35.664 - 01:03:10.716, Speaker A: So on the right. So this is in the euclidean space or on the sphere. This is a strict inequality on the right. So here on the right, is this a strict inequality? And so we get here. So we have two non strict inequalities. And this is equal to x minus p plus p minus z, because p is on the geodesic. And this is a contradiction we have because of the choice.
01:03:10.716 - 01:03:33.204, Speaker A: So this is a comparison. So this is equal to this and this is equal to that. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Are there other questions? Comments? No, it doesn't seem to be the case. Okay.
01:03:33.204 - 01:03:51.634, Speaker A: I thank you for your attention. I apologize for being a bit slow. Can I ask a question? Yeah. Are you assuming metric space is complete when you define cad. Copper spaces? Yeah. With this condition? Yeah. So, in fact it's.
01:03:51.634 - 01:04:11.994, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, one can do without. So actually. Yeah. So the point is that here it's not so important. So if you make reasonable definitions. So, for instance, if you use the definition we made, then we have used.
01:04:11.994 - 01:04:33.574, Speaker A: So then you can. You can. So then you can. You don't have to assume that your space is complete, but then the completion will also be zero. So. And then you. You can, you can restrict here to complete spaces.
01:04:33.574 - 01:04:53.614, Speaker A: Thank you. Are there other questions? Maybe we can just thank the speaker. Yes. Okay. I was waiting for my question. Thank you, sir.
