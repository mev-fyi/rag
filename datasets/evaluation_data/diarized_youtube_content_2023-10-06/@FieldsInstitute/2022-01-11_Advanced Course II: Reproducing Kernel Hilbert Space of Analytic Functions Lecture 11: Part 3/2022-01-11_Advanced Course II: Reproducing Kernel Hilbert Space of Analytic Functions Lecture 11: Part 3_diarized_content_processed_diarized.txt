00:00:16.840 - 00:01:14.790, Speaker A: Well, welcome back, everybody. Let's talk about some more specific spaces. The one I want to discuss a little bit are h two Bergman space. Sometimes we write a two, sometimes b two, depending on the taste on the author, and more importantly, the Dirichlet space. In all of these spaces, all of them are rkhs. In all of them they are defined, defined on the open unit disk, disk. And at each point there are functions which are not zero at that point.
00:01:14.790 - 00:02:41.554, Speaker A: Therefore, for every zoo in d, we are sure that kz is not equal to zero in all cases. Case h two, I mean, I don't use different notation, but in h two, a two, and d k z is not equal to zero. So we immediately deduce that if f is a multiplier, doesn't matter for which space, then the absolute value of f at point z is majorized by the norm of the multiplier for any z. Indeed so. And since in each case one is in this space, one is in h two, one is in a two, and one is also in the direction space, we conclude that the the multiplier space, they are not the same. In each case they are different, but in each case, the multiplier of the space, let's say multiplier of the space x. We will mix with this x multiplier of h is inside in h in all cases.
00:02:41.554 - 00:03:55.614, Speaker A: And therefore, note that h is also seats in hole d, so they are holomorphic functions. In this case, there is, I mean, no danger to say that the multiplier of each space is in h infinity. They are analytic and also bounded. So, in each case, for the Hardy, for Dirichlet, and for the Bergmann, they are bounded functions. Naturally, we ask, do we have equality? And this is a point where the type of the representation we consider is important. If you remember, I mean, I don't know if you were. In my lectures in July about hardy spaces, I gave four or five equivalent definitions for h two, and not all of them are good here.
00:03:55.614 - 00:05:03.538, Speaker A: For example, if we stay with the definition by coefficients, f is in h two if it has the series representation with coefficients which are square summable. And now you want to show that every element of h infinity is also a multiplier. So you need to consider an f, which is, I mean, in h infinity you don't have a specific information about its coefficient, except that h infinity by itself is also in h two. So something like this holds, but it doesn't help that much. And g is in h two. And then you do the multiplication, and this is a holomorphic function. It has its own Taylor representation.
00:05:03.538 - 00:06:03.104, Speaker A: You have to find the coefficients of this and show that the coefficients are square sum of all to conclude that it's in h two. Well, it's not a good method to do it. So here we stick to another representation. So another definition, equivalent definition of h two. The norm of an element f in h two squared was defined to be integral from zero to pfre to the I theta squared d theta divided by two p. And here, either you take limit or supremum, they are the same, in this case, between zero and one. So, functions such that this quantity is finite.
00:06:03.104 - 00:08:04.870, Speaker A: It's in this space h two. And now it's easy to show that every easy, now I have to say, now easy to show that h infinity is in multiplier space of h two. Because if f is in h infinity and g is in h two, then integral from zero to PI f r e to the I theta gr e to the I theta squared. We replace f here by the largest possible value, so it's less than or equal to the norm infinity squared, zero two PI gr e to the I theta squared. And then take the supremum with respect to r. So, sup? Zero two PI f r e to the I theta g r e to the I theta squared d theta two PI less than or equal to supremum here over integral of g. And this suprema is the norm of g in h two squared, we have normal f infinity squared.
00:08:04.870 - 00:08:56.878, Speaker A: And this, by definition, is the norm of f g into squared. So, in short, norm of fg in h two is less than or equal to norm infinity of f normal g in h two. Conclusion is that f is in the multiplier algebra of h two. And moreover, the norm of mf is bounded by the norm of f in h infinity. But we already know the other way around. So we already know no the same thing bigger than or equal to that. So, conclusion is that.
00:08:56.878 - 00:10:05.414, Speaker A: Conclusion the multiplier algebra of H two is precisely equal to h infinity. And moreover, for every element of that algebra, the norm coincide with h infinity norm. Very interesting results. And I invite you to do the same type of calculation in this space a two in the Bergman space. The only difference is that instead of doing integral over t, we do integral over over d, we do integral over d. It's a two dimensional integral, but the rest is the same. And indeed, all the calculation I did here, you can modify it a little bit and replace the integral from zero to PI by integral over d.
00:10:05.414 - 00:11:27.724, Speaker A: And pretty much do the same thing up to the end and conclude that the multiplier algebra of a two is also h infinity with the same norm. That's good. So it's here a two, and we obtain the same thing. But interestingly, now the story for D is different, for the Dirichlet's pay is different. Of course, of course, the, the multiplier algebra of d is inside h infinity, also inside d. So it's inside the intersection. And also, what happened? And also, we know that for any f is in, no, not this d, the other d in mold d norm f infinity is less than or equal to norm f in m.
00:11:27.724 - 00:12:20.994, Speaker A: We know that based on the general theory that we developed before and in the previous two cases. Indeed, when we do, the intersection, the intersection of, say, for example, h two with h infinity is h infinity. But here it's not the case, it's a bit smaller. So, I mean, you can imagine like that this is d, this is h infinity, and this is the intersection. And this intersection by itself is, is an algebra. I mean, the intersection h infinity is an algebra. This is very easy to, to show.
00:12:20.994 - 00:13:39.714, Speaker A: And we naturally wonder, is it the multiplier algebra? I want to show that this is not the case. Indeed, the multiplier algebra is smaller, is inside, but smaller. So this is malt t. And to show that this is smaller, I do it, I mean, in the, I mean, straightforward case, I give you an element, an f here, which is in the intersection h infinity. But it is not a multiplier. I mean, very, very direct proof. So, theorem, there exists an element f in d intersection h infinity, such that f is not an element of multiplier.
00:13:39.714 - 00:14:18.854, Speaker A: Just a matter of thinking, finding the right Taylor coefficient for the function f, and to show that it satisfied the required properties. And this is done before. I forgot who did this, but I have the answer. Proof for the definition of f. I do it this way. F of z as defined by a Taylor series. But the coefficient an are defined in this way.
00:14:18.854 - 00:15:19.414, Speaker A: A highly lacquenary series. I mean, sequence nk is defined to be two exponent two to the k for k equal to one, two, three, and so on. And in between n k minus one and n k, I defined an to be constant one over k squared times nk bigger than or equal to one. If I put one, you have zero. But it's okay. I can start from zero here. 0123.
00:15:19.414 - 00:16:24.774, Speaker A: So, in, in very large gaps, an is fixed. It's given by this fixed number, but it's, it's defined well in the following sense. I don't give all the details because they are simple calculations, but I invite to fill the gaps. The first thing is that the sum over n of a n is finite, so it's more than being in h infinity. Indeed, it's in the wener algebra, so it's in l one and second. And the way to do this is to break the sum into two sums. I mean, just as a hint, we can start from two two, to avoid difficulties at the very beginning.
00:16:24.774 - 00:17:15.314, Speaker A: And this is the sum from k from one up to infinity of the indices which are between nk minus one and nk a n. And for this we have an explicit formula. Just plug it, very simple calculation. You'll see that it's like one over k squared, which is finite. And second one, to show that it's in the Dirichlet space, we have to calculate the Dirichlet integral. And this is the sum of nan squared. Precisely the same strategy as above.
00:17:15.314 - 00:17:50.846, Speaker A: And this is even better. When you do this strategy and apply to the second series, it will be like the sum of one over k to the power four. This one is one over k two. This is one over k four, and it's even the minimum. Better conversion, but faster. So this one is also infinity. So one and two together show that f is in the Dirichlet space intersection.
00:17:50.846 - 00:18:55.704, Speaker A: Indeed. I mean, I write h infinity here, but you can replace h infinity even by the w, which is a notation for the vener algebra. I don't need this is here. But I mean, h infinity is enough. So it's a very, very nice function. But still, that's kind of half of the proof I need to show that it's not a multiplier. How to show that it's not a multiplier? Well, to show that it's not a multiplier, I need, say, a function h in d, such that when I do h time f, this is not in t.
00:18:55.704 - 00:19:56.594, Speaker A: I need to find a good h. And this is again done by this definition. So, definition h of z is defined as the sum n bigger than or equal to two, one over n log n to the power three, four z. The rest is the matter. I mean, the important part is to guess this edge. The rest is a matter of calculation to show that it's in d. And when you multiply, it's not in d, it's.
00:19:56.594 - 00:20:52.834, Speaker A: I mean, I leave it as an exercise for the student, but nothing delicate in that. The important part of the proof is to think of these big gaps and define a function in the way I explained and also to come up with the definition of a function such that when you multiply, it kicks out and go out of the space. And I mean the rest. I leave it to you. So, back to this diagram. Mod t is really smaller than the intersection of d and h infinity. And I give you a little bit of more information about that.
00:20:52.834 - 00:22:24.932, Speaker A: But still, even though we have a complete characterization by Steganga, which I will mention as the last theorem of our course, but still, we'll see that it's not, it's not a handy characterization. One characterization, which in a sense is a reformulation of the problem and makes the connection to the Carlson measures and show the importance of the Carlson mention, is this theorem. Theorem. Let h be d and mu measure mu, a finite measure on d given by this formula, and d mu defined to be h prime. That's the prime, makes the difference in Dirichlet spaces. H prime mod squared d a z da is dx dy and divided by PI. It doesn't matter.
00:22:24.932 - 00:23:46.712, Speaker A: It's just a normalization factor. So this is our measure defined via the function h. And then h is in the multiplier space, or multiplier algebra of the theoretical space, if and only if mu is a Carlasson measure. This means, more explicitly, this means that, I mean, h is bounded, or h is in h infinity. And there is a constant circle such that integral over d mod f squared d mu is controlled by the normal f in the Dirichlet space squared. And wait, this is not Dirichlet space. That's the open unit disk.
00:23:46.712 - 00:24:27.552, Speaker A: They are not the same. Maybe even I give less tail to it to make it distinct. So that's the definition of a Carlasson measure for the Dirichlet space. Of course, it has to be bound, too. So we have a characterization for multipliers. And even though it sounds a bit strange, but I give the proof. And when you look at the proof, you see that, well, this is just a reformulation of the problem.
00:24:27.552 - 00:25:06.304, Speaker A: It's not a solution to the problem, but still, it's good, because then we go and seek which measures satisfy this property independent of thinking about multipliers. These are called the Carlson measures for the, for the Dirichlet space. And a lot of people, a lot of prominent mathematicians have worked on this topic. And then, based on that, we can even give a complete characterization of multipliers. Even though it's not a handy characterization. The proof is easy. Let me, let me give the proof.
00:25:06.304 - 00:26:43.774, Speaker A: First, suppose that h is a multiplier. Then let f is in the Dirichlet space. And I mean, this formula that we see even in, I mean, maybe even high school, the formula for hf prime, h prime, f plus sf prime. But let me, let me write it this way. Let me write it as f h prime is equal to this minus minus hf prime. And then why I wrote it that way because now the integral that we try to estimate is one over PI integral over d d mu was. I mean, the definition is here, d mu is mod h prime squared.
00:26:43.774 - 00:28:37.544, Speaker A: So it will be mod f h prime squared and the area measure. And now I use this, I take the absolute value of both sides, and to take this square, absolute value f h prime squared is, is less than or equal to two. I keep prime. So I obtain from here, from here I obtain integral over d mod f squared, d mu is less than or equal to two over PI, integral over d absolute value hf together, prime squared da plus two over PI, integral over d h f prime squared da. How's that? I know that h is bounded. So this h, I can take it out, and this one, this integral is just the definition of the norm. So for this one I have equal, equal of two y's.
00:28:37.544 - 00:29:25.132, Speaker A: I write less than or equal, but for this part is just equality, twice the norm of hf in the territory. Indeed, even for that one is less than, because there is a constant term. So forget my comment. And for the other one I write plus norm of h infinity squared. And what remains is majorized by the normal f in t squared. It's a very rough estimation, and that's the point I used. My assumption.
00:29:25.132 - 00:30:09.244, Speaker A: My assumption was that h is a multiplier. So I use it here, I use it here. This is less than or equal to two wise. The norm of the multiplier squared times the norm of f squared, plus the same thing. I factorize everything times normal fd squared. What remains for this calculation, it really doesn't matter. What matters is that from the beginning we have the normal f squared with respect to d mu.
00:30:09.244 - 00:30:56.404, Speaker A: And on the other side there is a constant normal f ing space, d squared. This is what I wanted to show, one direction. So that's one direction done, and the other direction is pretty much the same thing. The argument is reversible. And this time I don't need to twist the formula. I really use the fact that hf prime is hf h prime, f plus hf prime. And my assumption here is that this star holds.
00:30:56.404 - 00:32:21.084, Speaker A: That's my assumption. And now, what can I say about d of hf? Well, by definition, it's one over PI integral over d h f prime point z daz. And well, I use this as before. When I square it, I have twice the square of the first one, plus twice the square of the second one. So it will be less than or equal. Two over PI integral over d, h prime f squared, da plus two over PI, h f prime, da z and, well, less than or equal. For this one, I write it as two one over PI, h prime squared daz.
00:32:21.084 - 00:33:23.744, Speaker A: I write it as integral over d f 2d mu. The whole thing is d mu. And for the other one, one more time, I use the fact that h is in h infinity. So two y's norm of h infinity squared over PI integral over d, f prime squared, da and by assumption, the star formula, by assumption, this is less than or equal to two, a constant normal f in d squared. And that's also dof. So plus two norm h infinity squared, normal f d squared. So which is again a constant times normal f d squared.
00:33:23.744 - 00:33:53.132, Speaker A: So we are done. We are done because this says that df is less than constant times normal f. So it means that h is a multiplier. I think you're missing an absolute value squared in the first line. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Thank you, thank you. Yes.
00:33:53.132 - 00:34:35.592, Speaker A: Thank you. So h is a multiplier and we are done. So as you see, there is nothing special about this theorem. It just make a connection bridge between two subjects. One of them is Carlson measures this one and the other is the multipliers. And now there is an independent study for characterizing the Carlson measure for the Dirichlet spaces. This is successful.
00:34:35.592 - 00:35:14.134, Speaker A: And again, not something as easy as the Carlson measures for the Hardy space or even for the Bergman space. We have a very nice and beautiful characterization for those spaces. I mentioned them below. But again, for Diraclet spaces is much more complicated. But it's still useful. Still, it helps in some results. So my concluding remarks is about Carlson measure.
00:35:14.134 - 00:35:59.006, Speaker A: For this, we need to know what is a Carlson window Carlson box. I'm sure you have seen many, many times. In particular in our focus program, in several talks, we saw the Carlson box. Here is the boundary, boundary arc I. And we go inside. And the way we go inside sometimes is equal to the length of I, sometimes length divided by two PI. It depends how we want to normalize.
00:35:59.006 - 00:36:55.604, Speaker A: And this is called s of I. Hardly for Hardy spaces. That's a result of Carlson and says that the measure is a Carlson measure if and only if the measure of this box is controlled by constant the length of the boundary arc very nice geometric characterization. And for the Bergman space, it's by hasting show that. Very similar, except that we need a square. Here. Two observations about this result.
00:36:55.604 - 00:37:22.564, Speaker A: These two result. In each case, we have just one box. Sy. Just one box. And also on the other side, we have the Lebeg measure. The Lebeg measure is easy to handle. And now let's see what is the characterization by Stinger of the Carliston measures for the Dirichlet space.
00:37:22.564 - 00:38:20.172, Speaker A: First difference is that you don't, you have to consider a finite number of the windows. I mean, not just one. Say one here, one here, and so on. So I call this I one, I, two in. And the second difference is that. So disjoint n disjoint boxes. And there is no restriction on n.
00:38:20.172 - 00:38:56.408, Speaker A: That's the first thing. And the second is that the. The measure of the union of these boxes. Measure of the union. The status one k from one up to n s. This is controlled by a constant. Say I write a for the constant.
00:38:56.408 - 00:39:51.424, Speaker A: Now, not, not to mix with what we have here. C. The capacity, logarithmic capacity of the union k from one up to nik. So that's the second difference with the previous one. Instead of low back measure, we have here logarithmic capacity, which is another way to measure the length of sets. But it's a very difficult tool. Difficult in the sense that the capacity is not additive.
00:39:51.424 - 00:40:21.504, Speaker A: Here on the left side, of course, we can write some k from one up to n mu of Sik. That's okay, because they are disjoint. And we have a measure, we have. Have this identity. But whoever even, don't think about it. Some c of KK from one thing, it's. Yeah, I mean, I even say absolutely not.
00:40:21.504 - 00:41:23.744, Speaker A: Even for two arcs, the capacity, the capacity of one arc, we know that it's asymptotically almost equal to one over log of its length. But even for two, I one union, I two, even for this, we have difficulty, and there are many, many technical problems. The distance between them is important. And it's a characterization by a stygangia. It has been used in studying multipliers of the Dirichlet space. But this is difficult to handle. It's not an easy way to measure the thickness of, I mean, arcs on the boundary.
00:41:23.744 - 00:42:02.802, Speaker A: Well, I think it's a good time to stop and thank you all for bearing with me in this semester and following our courses. I really profoundly thank each one of you. I hope you have enjoyed the lectures. Thank you. Thank you for a brilliant set of talks. It was just absolutely terrific. Thank you.
00:42:02.802 - 00:42:14.314, Speaker A: Thank you indeed. Anatolia, everyone, and as we mentioned in the break, hope to see you all, I mean, very soon, in person.
