00:00:00.160 - 00:01:06.755, Speaker A: Setting where you might be able to achieve cures potentially or in the kind of setting where patients might be expected to live for a long time. So this is more kind of a proof of principle around scheduling in a setting in which the patients die like a few months after treatment starts. But yeah, beyond this particular project, we are doing exactly the kind of thing and that you're talking about. So first I should say there's a follow up study which is uses agent based modeling and looks at combination chemo radiation in gbm. And then which was also done in Francisca's lab with some other other people that I was involved in. And then, yeah, my own lab are trying to understand the molecular mechanisms of resistance and in particular the dynamic molecular response and use that knowledge to try and develop new strategies which we hope will lead to more durable responses. And in that setting, yeah, the strategy would likely be very different than the kind of approach employed here.
00:01:09.535 - 00:01:12.475, Speaker B: All right, thanks Jamie. Let's thank our speaker again.
00:01:17.375 - 00:01:18.195, Speaker C: Okay.
00:01:27.305 - 00:01:28.765, Speaker B: I guess full screen.
00:01:37.345 - 00:01:37.721, Speaker C: All right.
00:01:37.753 - 00:01:48.525, Speaker B: As I get set up, I'll introduce her. So next up we have Jonah Gertz Mitigating non genetic resistance to checkpoint inhibition based on multiple states of exhaustion.
00:01:53.805 - 00:02:11.785, Speaker C: Okay. Yes, I was. All right, well, good morning everyone. It's been great to be here. So this talk is going to be about resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. We've heard about these on and off throughout the meeting. But I did want to start with a primer of what checkpoint inhibition actually is.
00:02:11.785 - 00:02:47.633, Speaker C: So T cells, a type of immune cell, express these checkpoint molecules like PD1. When PD1 binds to its native ligand, PD L1, it says don't kill signal to the immune system, telling the immune system to tolerate the presence of that cell. The problem is that tumor cells express these PD L1 ligands. Therefore T cells often will not kill them. So what immune checkpoint inhibitors do is come in and disrupt this native signaling either by binding to PD L1 or binding to the ligand. Once that sick problem, we have to share screens. Ah, go for it.
00:02:47.633 - 00:03:37.497, Speaker C: All right, thank you. Okay, so here. Okay, so once that signal is disrupted, what then happens is the immune system is able to get the message to target the tumor cells for destruction. Put this another way, what immune checkpoint inhibitors do is reverse the state of immune cell exhaustion. It used to be thought that that was it with T cells. They could be exhausted or they could be active. But we now understand that actually T cells can exist in multiple states of exhaustion, one of which is reversible and the other which is irreversible and very Importantly, it's only the reversibly exhausted T cells that are targetable by immune checkpoint inhibitors.
00:03:37.497 - 00:04:13.365, Speaker C: Our interest was really in studying the implications of this framework for response to immune checkpoint inhibition. I'm going to go through more details of the assumptions underlying the model than the actual equations. The equations are available in the paper, if you're interested in seeing them. But the underlying assumption here is that it's inflammation that drives the transition to exhaustion. This is based on an understanding of autoimmunity and chronic infection. I'll come back to that a little bit at the end of the talk. But we start by assuming that inflammation is going to increase at a rate proportional to the rate at which the tumor is killed and has some natural clearance.
00:04:13.365 - 00:05:11.969, Speaker C: If a tumor is not eliminated by the cytotoxic T cells that are there, and if inflammation passes some primary threshold, the T cells will transition to its first exhaustion state. This is a targetable state of exhaustion and it is reversible. If inflammation first further increases beyond a secondary threshold, then the T cells will enter this terminal state of exhaustion where they're no longer targetable. They are cytotoxic there, but they're not targetable. As a result of this, you could imagine that it's possible that what inflammation can do is deplete the pool of targetable T cells, the targetable exhausted T cells. If you don't wait long enough to give your next dose of the immune checkpoint inhibitor, what can happen is these cells, the therapy might fail, not because of some inherent resistance to the therapy, but because of improperly timed therapy. That's what we want to explore if you're interested in the equations.
00:05:11.969 - 00:06:01.267, Speaker C: It's a single equation for tumor growth, one for each of the T cell populations, Y1 through Y3, and a single term for inflammation. And there is a two compartment PK model for the immune checkpoint inhibitor. Let's just start with some real simple baseline behavior of this model. In the control case, the tumor will calibrate to some size below carrying capacity because of the effects of the immune system. The second case is just showing that there are schedules of the drug in which you could actually eradicate the tumor. According to the model, there's nothing particularly realistic about that schedule except to simply say that at the parameters we're looking at right now, there's no intrinsic resistance to the therapy. However, if we take the same protocol and just spread the drugs out by a day more in our model, we've lost control of the tumor.
00:06:01.267 - 00:06:43.111, Speaker C: This just demonstrates the sensitivity to how you're scheduling under the assumptions of the model, then we want to take this further. What we did was a full dose fractionation sweep. We fixed the total cumulative dose and we vary both the number of doses we divided over and the spacing between the doses. When the number of doses is very low, you're getting a very high dose. And reverse on the other side, we found three regions of space colored and green, where the model predicts that you're going to have a complete responder to the therapy. The first is in the upper left hand corner where you're giving very high dose of the drug and you're giving very far apart from each other. And that we'll call an MTD like strategy.
00:06:43.111 - 00:07:13.365, Speaker C: There's an intermediate dose and frequency case as well. And then there's a region in the bottom right where you give a large number of doses close together, which we'd call more a metronomic like strategy. All three of these are effective according to the model. We wanted to understand the difference between these effective and ineffective protocols. Here what you're looking at is three very similar protocols and the dynamics of the tumor volume in those cases. In this case, it happens to be eight doses administered. But that detail is not important.
00:07:13.365 - 00:08:13.225, Speaker C: We're going to look at giving a dose of three and space it out by either one, three or four days. What I want to point out here is that when you space out by four days or by one day, you have an ineffective protocol. But in between, at day three, when you space them out by three days, your protocol is effective. So why is this happening? So if we actually track the dynamics of the different T cell populations, what you'll notice is it's that yellow population which are the terminally exhausted T cells that are dominating. In the case of failure, these are non targetable, but in the case of treatment success, that population's not dominating. There's a pool of targetable cells there. If we also track the inflammation levels over time, what we notice for the failure cases, inflammation is staying above the secondary threshold F2, whereas in the middle case, in the case of treatment success, information might cross that threshold a bit, but it doesn't sustain at those high levels.
00:08:13.225 - 00:09:04.635, Speaker C: We observe this across all of protocol space. If we just track area above that secondary threshold, what we find is it's very large areas above that threshold that correspond to failure and smaller but not necessarily insignificant values that correspond to success. So right now this has been a fairly theoretical exercise. So then we wanted to ask, is there evidence of this happening in patients? So this is Unpublished work led by Irina and her postdoc, Clara Pevelet. And if you cannot take pictures because they haven't published yet, that was her request. So what they did is they analyzed single cell RNA sequencing data of patients who are being treated with different immune checkpoint inhibitors in a phase 2tr of head and neck squamous cell cancer. And they were interested in finding gene signatures associated with different states of exhaustion.
00:09:04.635 - 00:10:06.285, Speaker C: Here's the first question they asked. They asked, are there differences between responders and non responders when it comes to states of exhaustion? The answer ended up being yes. If you look at the dark blue region, that is the region of the terminally exhausted T cells, and you do see a significantly larger percent of terminally exhausted T cells in those non responders, the next thing they asked, is this an intrinsic property of a patient or is this composition mitigated by the treatment itself? And in an admittedly small sample of patients, they did find a difference pre treatment and post treatment in terms of the immune cell composition. So it is something being modulated by treatment. Okay, so with that said, the next thing we want to do is say we had these sort of three regions of protocol space where we said, well, we could treat patients are nominal patients with any one of these protocols. Then we want to do a small robustness study and say, given the sensitivity to that secondary inflammatory threshold.
00:10:09.425 - 00:10:09.897, Speaker B: How would.
00:10:09.921 - 00:11:14.581, Speaker C: We find the robustness of treatment response across a virtual patient cohort where we vary that inflammation threshold? The way to see the data here is anything in bright yellow would be 100% responders down to dark blue, which is none. What was really interesting, it was only the metronomic region of protocol space where we found responders across the parameter sets we were looking at. The recommendation would be to give a large number of doses close together. If we go to higher cumulative doses, we could push the yellow region back up to the others. But that would of course be giving more drug. Then the follow up question is, are there any clinical trials where people have given lower doses of immune checkpoint inhibitors? If so, what have they found? The answer is, while no trials have been designed this way, there are some retrospective studies where the people actually did take lower doses simply for financial reasons. Interestingly, these studies have shown that lower doses can be just as effective as higher doses and have fewer side effects.
00:11:14.581 - 00:11:59.299, Speaker C: There's not anything out there where they're given closer together, but at least indicating that lower doses may be possible. So the challenge of the protocol we're suggesting it's not only lower doses, but it's giving them really close together, more frequent hospital visits, more hospital resources. That could be a problem. So then we asked, can we use the model to try to identify a combination partner so maybe we don't have to use this full schedule? And what would that combination partner be? So this slide has a lot on it, so let me try to explain it quickly. So in the upper right hand corner, you see the entirety analysis of protocol space from before. So number of doses on the horizontal axis, spacing in the vertical, and you see response at the nominal parameter. Step.
00:11:59.299 - 00:12:29.325, Speaker C: The question we're going to ask for every non PK model parameter is then the following. By what fraction can I change that parameter and flip the outcome of the therapy? The model only has two outcomes. So if you see dark blue like you see in the top left, that's a very sensitive parameter. You change it a little, you flip the outcome. If you see bright yellow, that means you can change it by 100%. We didn't go beyond that and not flip the outcome of the therapy. We did that across the entirety of protocol space, one parameter at a time.
00:12:29.325 - 00:13:04.715, Speaker C: And four parameters stood out to us. I picked these four because what's interesting is the yellow overlaps with a lot of the responders. So you're not likely to flip a responder, but you are likely to flip some of the non responders to responders. Then let's look at what these parameters are. The two in the upper right hand corner relate to the killing capacity of the exhausted T cells. There's no reason we think we can target this, so we're going to move on from that. Then in bottom right, this parameter relates to the death rate of exhausted T cells, not necessarily something we can extend.
00:13:04.715 - 00:13:49.051, Speaker C: We move to this parameter. This parameter is the rate that inflammation drives the transition to exhaustion. Now, even if we can't control the rate, you can control inflammation. So what this is indicating, somewhat counterintuitively, is that you want to actually bring down inflammation if you want to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Now, this is just a theoretical prediction, but this is definitely my favorite slide of the talk. So in June of this year, about six months after our paper came out, two separate clinical trials came out that found a very significant increase in the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors if you combine them with a JAK inhibitor, which brings down inflammation. Let's look at the two response rates because they're really interesting.
00:13:49.051 - 00:14:48.305, Speaker C: In the metastatic non small cell lung cancer study, they went from a monotherapy response rate of less than 50% and a median survival of a few months. Add in the inflammation damper, you increase the response rate to 67% and you increase the median recurrence rate to over two years. The Hodgkin's lymphoma one is arguably even more interesting than that because in enrollment criteria is you failed the monotherapy, add in the JAK inhibitor and about half respond and show no progression after two years. This was really exciting to see. What was really interesting is they also attributed the success of the combination therapy to being able to reinvigorate those exhausted T cells, which is exactly what we were trying to do with the model. And also validated the underlying assumption of the model, which honestly was theoretical, grounded in biology, but theoretical when we started it. And they also found, like we're finding, that the timing of this really matters.
00:14:48.305 - 00:15:09.005, Speaker C: So it's not just you have to give an anti inflammatory, but when you give, it matters in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor. So that was a story I want to tell. Let me just thank Irina for being an amazing collaborator and so much fun to work with this project with her. If you're interested, the paper is available online. Thank you all for your time and attention.
00:15:14.245 - 00:15:14.885, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
