00:00:00.560 - 00:00:55.730, Speaker A: Are there any questions? How many people have checked the proof of injectivity? What I'm talking. You know what I'm referring to, Daniel. What am I referring to if I say injectivity? Yeah. I'm sure you're speaking loudly and clearly enough for people within a certain radius to hear, but there's a fair amount of noise, and we need to have that now and. Okay. Anyway, is that a yes or no? I guess. Qualified.
00:00:55.730 - 00:01:14.962, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah. Okay. But then are you. Are you familiar with how that goes? Is that a yes? No. No. Okay, but have I.
00:01:14.962 - 00:01:39.430, Speaker A: But have I indicated my. My take on that? That it's a corollary of surjectivity? Okay. Yeah. Okay. And the idea is that surjectivity applied to a different algebra. Right. And what's the different algebra? Well, I'm going like this, right? It's.
00:01:39.430 - 00:01:58.614, Speaker A: It's the. It's. I have to be a little careful, because there's paths. So this is paths of paths. In the first instance, the paths are closed paths. But if you have what we. What we have is maybe.
00:01:58.614 - 00:02:31.164, Speaker A: Yeah. You have to show if something in k zero is zero. No, you have to show if it's. If it maps into zero, then it's zero. Okay, so k zero is a difference of two things, right? Which are positive, which come from projections in matrix algorithms. Okay. Well, I mean, since it's a group, you only have to prove it's injective at zero somehow.
00:02:31.164 - 00:03:01.680, Speaker A: But this is convenient, because it means that if you have the difference of two things, you want to prove that's equal to zero. That means we have two positive. Two positive things. Two projections, and we want to prove that they are. That they are the same in K zero. Right. And for what? And what does that mean? Are you Justin? Justin.
00:03:01.680 - 00:03:21.108, Speaker A: Okay. And so, you know, if someone gives me half a minute, I can maybe remember the name. So what are you? Jalal? Yes. Okay, good. That took me half a minute, I guess. Okay. And I like to feel a good talk.
00:03:21.108 - 00:03:48.224, Speaker A: In the meantime, I can stall. Okay. All right. But then what if you have two projections or item potence, just say production, which are equivalent, in case zero morphinome. No, they're not primary phenomenon equivalent. But how do we get something which is marine phenomenon? How do we reduce that to Mary? Phenomenal equivalents. Well.
00:03:48.224 - 00:04:49.014, Speaker A: Well, it's a general question. Suppose you have a semigroup, and you have two elements of the semigroup that are equal in the. In the developing group. Then how can you restate that in terms of an equation in the semi group. How many people remember that from just calculating with some universal and developing groups? Vincent, it may be hard to remember because in many, many cases you look at two elements of the semigroup. If they're equal in the group, they're equal in the semi group. But that's not always true.
00:04:49.014 - 00:05:28.994, Speaker A: Maybe it's not that easy to think of an example. Okay, well, actually I think it is. I mean, there are some semi groups it's easy to think of. Here's an extremely grand semi group such that. Anyone want to think of an example or two? Elements of a semi group are not equal, but they're equal in the evolving group. Here's a. Remember, Professor Helmoss says, always go for the simplest thing, at least until you can handle it.
00:05:28.994 - 00:06:32.060, Speaker A: And yes, I think if we, or at least we've done this exercise before, if we take the semi group to be the positive integers within. Yeah, okay, well, then. Yeah, so. And so what then what's the answer to the first question? If two integers, say three and six, the positive integers and things in the semi group that are equal in the group, then what do you have to. How can you patch things up so that. How can you patch them up so they're equal in the semi group? Anyone want to suggest we have three and six are equal and the semi group is the integer? The positive integers and actual numbers together with plus infinity. Okay, that's.
00:06:32.060 - 00:06:45.924, Speaker A: The addition is obviously. Yes. Three plus infinity is. Sorry. Like three plus infinity equals six plus infinity. That's true. Yeah.
00:06:45.924 - 00:07:26.752, Speaker A: And maybe that's the, maybe that's the best you can do because certainly three is not equal to six, right? And if you add any other single element to both, then you're not. Still not going to be. Okay, but. All right, this is called, this is called failure or cancellation. Normally if you're in a safe setting, reasonably safe setting, you can assume that the cancellation rules, right? It says that the two elements in a semigroup are equal. They're equal, but in general, you can add. It's enough to add something.
00:07:26.752 - 00:07:46.124, Speaker A: You can add something and get to me. So, um. And in case you're all. That means we can add some other production, right? The class that we had. The class of some other production to both of them. And since that's. And once we do that, if we add any larger one, because the larger one would be this plus something else, right? Because, um.
00:07:46.124 - 00:08:12.364, Speaker A: Um. Add any larger one, then they would still be. Well, then you're. The point is that you can. What you're adding, you can assume it's a multiple of the unit. Why is that important? I'll give you. It's not important.
00:08:12.364 - 00:08:52.844, Speaker A: But anyway, if you have two projections and they're equal in phase zero, you can add single projection to both. And since every projection is less than some multiple of the unit, you can add the difference. And so I think that's adding a single additional thing to both. You can assume that you're just adding. But maybe that's, maybe we don't need that. We did need that when we were, when we had the c minus f, so on. We were trying to prove half.
00:08:52.844 - 00:10:03.414, Speaker A: Exactly. Okay, so we want to show that after we add some production may be multiple units, but enough to. Well, I guess the point is it's enough to add some production get very bad. We want to just prove that there are more corresponding closed loops in the suspension. But. Okay, so the idea is you look at paths, elements of the element, not close paths now just path, just paths of elements. So what we would like to do is get the two projections, say e and f, at least after we've added something to them.
00:10:03.414 - 00:11:04.784, Speaker A: We'd like them to be like connected by a path. Like connected by a path. Because then they'll certainly do same in, because it'll be the same in k zero. But the conclusion we want is in the same as k zero. I think that we proved we're going to get that they're in the same homo topic then actually connected by a path. But that won't be true until we add something. There got to be some point where in the proof we had something to go.
00:11:04.784 - 00:12:13.354, Speaker A: But anyway, we have a point. As you look at the algebra of paths in a just path parameterized by t, going from zero to one, nothing to do with circling. And so this is algebra. And so you want to like we know surjectivity. So you apply surjectivity for the bacteria, for this. Now we're first, we're assuming that. And what does subjectivity say? Is that something? If you have a closed path of variables, then it comes from the homotopy, it comes in a standard way from production.
00:12:13.354 - 00:13:34.194, Speaker A: Okay, but we're assuming when we have two paths, two productions, we have, we're assuming those patterns are homotopy, some major job. And, but then we know that this means that this, we have a, that means there exists a single path, a pass. And this is my surat activity. Then this comes from a path of projections. So it comes by, it comes from path of production. And the, and it comes from, what I'm trying to do is to get everyone in the room except me in the work. Okay.
00:13:34.194 - 00:14:09.954, Speaker A: I could, I could have written a little essay about it. In fact, I probably did at some point in the last week or so, at least roughly. And then I could have projected it onto the screen or following the old system, copied it out on the platform. But what I like to do is proceed in such a limping way that you rush in to help. Okay. Anyway, think about it. Of course, you can always peek in the book.
00:14:09.954 - 00:16:20.352, Speaker A: There's a key observation, technical observation, that is, if you look at the, we have, the two knows their homotopy, but then, so we have a homotopy of this, we have a homotopy of those past, but then we apply the, it makes sense that this is actually homotopic to a matrix algebra to a standard path, path connecting to path connecting two. The point is that at the end, at the very beginning, what you have at the end is the two given paths. Do you know the two given paths? Paths starting from the two productions enf. And if you operate in the whole business operation, row operations. The point is that you give it to the, you do that to something which is linear to begin with. If you do it, then it generally reduces the degree and then you end up with the standard path. But suppose that your path, suppose you do proof of surject activity.
00:16:20.352 - 00:17:27.972, Speaker A: Suppose you're given a path which is linear, already you apply the procedure to it. Well, that's kind of stupid, because if it's linear, then apply the procedure to it, then nothing happens. But suppose it's the two ends of the whole path, close path of work. Then the two, um, at the two end point, in the middle there, there are very high polynomial paths, two endpoints. You have these two linear paths that you started with. Okay, the assumption is they're homotopy. You want to prove injectivity, but, um, but then these two endpoints of this path, of those paths, the degree is not going to get any larger for them.
00:17:27.972 - 00:19:14.524, Speaker A: The endpoints are degree one when you start, and they're going to be degree n when you're finished. And by the way, where did this adding multiples of the identity to the enf come from? Well, remember when we changed the trigonometric polynomial, the regular column multiplied by the power of z plus the same as taking e and f and adding multiples of the identity to it every time you have a unit, if you start with a, the unit of the altitude in the closed path that's located to the, okay, so that, so multiplying the path, modifying that path by that first point is taking the heading multiples, adding copies of the unit to go. So that's why you get. And that may be necessary because the semi group of very well known semigroup may not map injectively into the galaxy group. That's called having cancellation. That makes sense, right? Because you can cancel. Okay, well, what else, what were some other.
00:19:14.524 - 00:20:50.054, Speaker A: I said, I still said we can read again tomorrow at the same time, same place. I have a little printer that says we have the room, based on the incident. By the way, was there going to be a tutorial this Friday? Maybe not. Maybe that's it. Okay, well, something I didn't say we would discuss the spectrum of theorem. You can still do that more. We started talking about it, remember there's this nice paper from about 60 years ago, american mathematical, explaining how to prove the spectral theorem without using the fundamental theorem of algebraic.
00:20:50.054 - 00:21:57.964, Speaker A: Also you have to prove that applies equally well not only to the case of a real Hilbert space, but to the case of a turning only for it sometimes quaternions. Very useful in mathematics. Very useful in Phoenix, too. There's a proof using paternians, I think something about. And when an integer can be expressed as a sum of four squares, look it up. Depends on the fact. It's quite easy to prove appropriate statement using the fact that by complex complex numbers, the absolute value squares sum of the squares.
00:21:57.964 - 00:23:55.164, Speaker A: Real profanes attorneys, you have four things, and for the, for that one, for that proof, you don't need to know the real case of proof and the fruit already in the real case. It's not quite trivial. You say you want to avoid the fundamental theorem. No reason not to use it, maybe, but it's not an elementary, not quite an elementary theorem in principle. That's a good exercise to, before you look up, I think there is a relatively standard proof in terms of what's called numerical range. You look at the operator times vector, and then take unit product with the vector, and then you look at the absolute value vector frame of, that's called the numerical radius. That's.
00:23:55.164 - 00:25:43.514, Speaker A: And if you look at the supremum, just like the environment, not because may not be positive. And what I recall is we look at the upper right endpoint, lower end point, and one of those must be both a little bit more. But it's easier to work with one. You might as well assume that the operator part of your added scale. So anyway, there's a, there's a. You just work inner products proof. It's an eigenvalue dimension what does it use about finite dimensions? I would say what it uses is compound.
00:25:43.514 - 00:26:40.204, Speaker A: And if you look at the number I mentioned, you take the operator acting on a vector and take the inner product with the same vector. And that's continuous function. It's two. In infinite dimensions, the unit falls contact in what's called weak space of twelve. But this function is not, I don't think it's continuous. My recollection is not continuous. In the weekly space development.
00:26:40.204 - 00:27:21.842, Speaker A: The unit powers are compact in the normal. This is, this has to be, this. This is the way things have to be because we have examples. Everyone had an example handy of a selfie joint operator doesn't have any eigenvalues. Bounded selfie joint operator function. I'm talking about your continuance on the human ball. The maximum absolute value or faith positive value, maximum maximum or the minimum would be attained.
00:27:21.842 - 00:28:09.494, Speaker A: And this is the consequence of kosher short. Sometimes I'm hoping, I'm hoping that sometime someone will remind me of the third fundamental fact used in mathematics every day. One of them is scorching Schwartz and one of them is integration by parts. Okay. Okay. And why am I jumping up and down on the, on a dimensional case. The.
00:28:09.494 - 00:28:36.164, Speaker A: Professor Halpern's late. Professor Halpern's going to the finite dimension of. Look at that and see there's a proof of spectral theorem for finite dimensions. Real complex. It doesn't use. Brennan doesn't use. Well, good question.
00:28:36.164 - 00:29:54.746, Speaker A: Does it use cosy? Schwarz does any of the funny business applies to the group I just referred to, the artist supreme? I don't think it would because that proof doesn't work in infinite venues, right? You get an eigenvalue. The operator is a, x is the vector ax in the PI over x. You take the largest absolute value of that that exists in the finite way. Okay? It doesn't exist in infinite dimensional case. So if you have a proof in the infinite dimensional case, it can't be the same as the proof which uses that, uses that supreme. But the reason, one reason I'm talking about that right now is so that we don't have to. I guess it's a little tricky.
00:29:54.746 - 00:30:37.048, Speaker A: It's a little tricky. You want to know the polynomial is small from the integral from minus the normal operator to the normal operator. Polynomial is smaller. The operator you get by plugging in the operator into the polynomial. There's also small dengue trick involves instead of saying small, just say less than or equal to epsilon or equivalently greater than or equal to zero in terms of positivity. And you know what? You know, if you're greater than or equal to zero, we operate. If the polynomial is greater than or equal to zero on the interval, then the polynomial in the operator is also positive.
00:30:37.048 - 00:32:22.680, Speaker A: When you coordinate that, which, as a corollary, that would say. And what does this use about operators? I guess it uses it because it uses it give them little pipes to smoke and then remind people of the picture. The cat with the title, painting with the title, this is not a pipe. This is not an official occasion, so I don't have to expect you. Well, unfortunately. Okay, so what was I, what was like, what did I want to write on the board? Sorry. Oh, yeah.
00:32:22.680 - 00:32:42.474, Speaker A: Thank you. Why did I erase it? That's because nobody could see. You could see it. That's like. Or maybe you just read my mind. All right, suppose that we have minus epsilon is less than or equal to your self adjoint operator. And since this epsilon is self adjoint, you say a is greater than or equal to that epsilon.
00:32:42.474 - 00:33:35.114, Speaker A: Why is that? Because it means that if you take the inner product, a, x with x, and same it. And that. And that's what we're saying, that that squared. Any real? Any real, yes. For the left hand side, is it minus for the left hand side? Oh, thank you. Thank you. Pretty restrictive.
00:33:35.114 - 00:34:21.554, Speaker A: I put this inside or outside? I've got another in the middle. Okay, so, okay, but so this in particular relevant, because we're assuming ASLF. But if it is real, if this is real, then, and it's a complex in the real. For a real Hilbert space, it's always real for any operator. But for a complex, we're supposed to be dealing with something relevant, because we're supposed to be dealing with the color scheme. But if this complex of the space a has to be self employed. That's a good exercise.
00:34:21.554 - 00:35:03.922, Speaker A: The point is that the a is self adjoint, and this holds. And it's equivalent to saying that the normal invasion will step on the same. This is true in infinite dimensions, too. So it's got nothing to do with continuity. Yeah. And so that's why you can show that if the polynomial is positive. That's why you can show if polynomial is small.
00:35:03.922 - 00:35:38.154, Speaker A: Then you plug in. Plug in your screen. Something that's small, you do get that it's greater than minus epsilon. Instead of zero, you can put epsilon. Right. Okay. But then that's what we use about self adjoint operator.
00:35:38.154 - 00:37:01.584, Speaker A: That's all that comes into the proof of the spectral theorem, because the spectral theorem says you can plug an operator in, plug a self avoiding operator into a continuous function, and in a way more quickly, it's a homomorphism continuous function to the operator, to the new operator, but the operator plugging in the speaker, plugging the given one into the continuous pump. That should be a homework. And also it should agree with polynomials, the obvious plugging in when you have a polynomial, then it should. If the continuous function varies continuously in the supe norm, then the protein. That's what the spectral theorem says. That's one statement of the spectral theorem. And this approach yields that directly.
00:37:01.584 - 00:38:43.924, Speaker A: As a consequence of that you can get, if you want to, given operators unitarian equivalent to a multiplication operator on a measure space, an l two, we have l two in the measure space we have a bounded measurable function, real value function multiplied by that. L two functions part by measure space by that. And that's the bounded operator phase one. And that's. That's one form of an easy consequence. There's an exercise easy consequence annoying you have. If you know that, then it's pretty easy to find the open space.
00:38:43.924 - 00:40:07.770, Speaker A: It's a bit of a trick, and technically very easy. You don't need fundamental theorem, but you have to be awake, not for late at night. Something that's supposed to be easy like this, and you find it's slowing down, maybe fall asleep, you could pinch or something. It's very commercial. And by the way, it's. If anyone else, this is also what you do if you use the girl from the nightmare. The sea strawberry generated by the community of sea straw seastrout are generated by a self adjoint operator isomorphic.
00:40:07.770 - 00:40:51.204, Speaker A: To continue, that's a statement very close to this. It leads to the Hilbert space formulation. But I thought it was going. One reason I mentioned beyond you look at the theorem forum for general CPR. They sit on the. The proof of that involves producing a Hilbert space. Right.
00:40:51.204 - 00:41:34.544, Speaker A: That's what we want to do here. Given Hilbert space is not an l two space. We want to construct an l two space. But basically we california helper expanse. Well, if you look at the construction, it looks a lot like a. It looks a lot like a hill. If it were commuters in sea, Belgium that you applied to the Gelfat and landmark theorem for non communities geography, then the.
00:41:34.544 - 00:42:13.194, Speaker A: And then the give you an l two, the Hilbert space would be an l two. Okay, well, just a few minutes. What I. Maybe then look at some more tomorrow. If we don't finish it today, that could be this business of lifting productions. Okay, well, you can't do it in general. How many people have seen, I've done an exercise in the textbook that says you can't always.
00:42:13.194 - 00:43:06.444, Speaker A: Okay, that's like, that's single figures, single digits. Well, projections is simpler. Yeah. Suppose you take the c string algebra, continuous functions on a closed interval, which is sort of what we're talking about here. That is what we're talking about. And what's a quotient of that which has any quotient will have a single, at least one production, at least one non zero production, namely the class of the unit, if it's a non zero group, not the class, they caught the image. Well, quotient is always classes, and that matters, almost anything is classes.
00:43:06.444 - 00:45:06.914, Speaker A: That's what case theories, case stands for. Classes. What's an example? So is there a, is there a quotient? Two orthogonal, non zero, four, any quotient have zero projection, and if it's non zero, it will have the non zero one non. Can you express the press let unit? This is sum of two other, sorry, I'm asking you to search out the zero. You don't want to divide by everything. You don't want to divide by zero. What's something in between? You could divide it by what's, what's an example of? I give, how do you get an idea looking at the interval, how do you get an idea? Well, okay, but by the way, you take a single point, and then you get what's called a maximum property.
00:45:06.914 - 00:47:08.560, Speaker A: Just look at the functions that are zero at that point. What happens if you take the quotient by line? I guess it's not going to happen. Maybe it's not going to have very many derivatives. Instead of throwing away a single point, I guess what's left would be drag sum of two things which are 0.1, half, and then we drag some continuous functions on the upper half, breaking the zero in one half, and then of course finding things coupled out to the lower half, the sum of two. Was that a correct calculation? Well, did I even say what I was talking? Anyway, if it looks like clowning around, that's a good way of saying single non zero prediction. What happens when I was a portion? And by the way, if there were a quotient and they couldn't both live correct, they were non equal.
00:47:08.560 - 00:48:12.490, Speaker A: Downstairs you can only have one, can't have two non equal non zero. And for sure there are lots of quotients, may address some of two things, you know, but there's not much time left. Well, you have another month. I just found out today that speaking to the microphone. I just found out today that marks aren't due until the 11 January. Now we were asked not to wait until then because someone has to look at the marks. But if we say the 10th.
00:48:12.490 - 00:49:04.342, Speaker A: Say the 10th. I suppose not everyone waits until the 10th. Some people hand in the 10th. On the 9th. Can we just wait and see how it goes or should I? Of course it's not just someone has to produce one. That takes time, I guess. Anyway, there's lots of time to still play with the ideas.
00:49:04.342 - 00:49:41.454, Speaker A: And of course in the meantime, homework doesn't have to be suggested homework. It can be. What could be? Why? I just right now that probably is an exercise in the textbook. There are all kinds of good exercise to do. Is um. Well, I guess that um. Most people have missed taking 424 or 36 is a very good exercise in computers.
00:49:41.454 - 00:49:58.134, Speaker A: On index. On the um on the um. Um. Index theorem templates. That's very good idea to do better. Okay, I think we're.
