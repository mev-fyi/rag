00:00:00.160 - 00:00:52.264, Speaker A: I think that's very new. If you want to go to mathematical biology model, this should be a new one and a second order differential equation and GDE and the theory. So usually the nonlinearity in logical models, we continue with such kind of function. So, first one. So this is everybody, I think are familiar with. And there's, if you consider there is a phi and a long here, the true function, but maybe not a continuous. So usually the model is continuous function, but we allow the necessary function, not continuous.
00:00:52.264 - 00:01:29.786, Speaker A: And usually you think about the function in Lp. So in this case, the function so difficult is function taking negative value. So for positive case. That's why I am interested in the new model there. So, right hand side is positive, and we have a classic theory we can use. But if taken negative, that's a difficult, major challenge. So, so therefore, more general, one is g and h, so they function.
00:01:29.786 - 00:02:06.644, Speaker A: So we consider omega is zero one or zero t or whatever in one dimension. And omega is in rm, so m greater than equals two. So that means we'll go to PDE. In that case. So, ghost and I satisfy character orderly function. So in x, there's a measurable and in u second one, u is a continuous function. So if they're function independent of x, so this function must be continuous.
00:02:06.644 - 00:02:44.204, Speaker A: And also they can control by lp function. So, so, here is some kind of model. Here is usually people consider. So we can replace naphthrocyte as several operators. So, first one is a fractional, and this one is very new right now. So, pm here is polynomials, polynomials, and n equals one. So this is similar to first order ordinary differential equations.
00:02:44.204 - 00:03:35.130, Speaker A: And the second order is in general, so ABC is some kind of function, so maybe continuous, maybe not continuous. So we need to decide it. And the new whale and differential operator p code. So, recently we solve this linear case. So give a condition p code and satisfy sorting condition. So this is a linear case, have a unique solution. So in the textbook, and you can check the differential equation textbook, it suppose p code such that the linear case has a unique solution.
00:03:35.130 - 00:04:24.186, Speaker A: They never tell you what's the p and a code. So therefore, right now we solve this problem, and we give the condition for p code. So there's a uniqueness you can satisfy. So general cases, PDE, so they contain a lot of things. So usually right now, people work on the Laplace case. So, but there's a first derivative here, and there's a convention case, so they do not start a lot for general case. Now for the system, so there's several type for system, including predator pre model.
00:04:24.186 - 00:04:57.392, Speaker A: So I just write down and some of this. So we need to know the function b one, b two, or poisson phi stands for what can condition. So the system has a solution, at least one positive solution and a non zero. Okay, non zero. So zero solution that's already, sometimes zero already solution. So therefore, we want to know if there's a non zero positive solution. That means that you satisfy always positive, but not equals zero.
00:04:57.392 - 00:05:20.582, Speaker A: Some, some point and or everywhere positive. In. In omega, omega is the open set. So therefore we. This we study. So we psychological model here. So this one is more general and some author already did this kind of model.
00:05:20.582 - 00:05:48.032, Speaker A: But in l is capital l here as Laplace equation. So they're looking for number one, lambda two, and they only got a sum for number one, number two. That's not optimal. So that's not a very good result. But they already published in JDE and there's several paper there. So a lot of people started that. So right now we have a fixed point index theory.
00:05:48.032 - 00:06:18.506, Speaker A: So I myself and my collaborator set up this one. So this is. I think this should be very powerful method to deal with existence of a solution, nonzero positive solution for such kind of a model. So there's, of course, there's a difficulty. So here. So very challenged. So you have to overcome some kind of difficulty here.
00:06:18.506 - 00:06:47.924, Speaker A: Otherwise you cannot do it. So you cannot use a theorem to fix point theorem to solve the problem. Now, there's things even right now, this theorem we cannot use to solve the model. You can see here. So usually you can add some term here, first one in the first part. So it's early effect. I think Professor Chen yesterday mentioned that's a first order.
00:06:47.924 - 00:07:05.992, Speaker A: So they have such kind of things. So right now, I don't know how to do that for this case. If you have any effect here. So. And there's no idea, but maybe very challenged uses theorem fixed. .0 so you can go into that.
00:07:05.992 - 00:07:46.000, Speaker A: But how to do it, we don't know. Okay, so our main purpose will go to study existence and the uniqueness for non existence of nonzero non negative. So this is non zero, non negative means this and strictly positive. So we can justify the solution and strictly greater than zero everywhere. So sometimes then f. So I would give you f before the right hand side, the terms as continuous. But this is a.
00:07:46.000 - 00:08:03.404, Speaker A: Be careful. And some fractional differential equation and the PDE, the low solution. Okay. The function f is phi precise continuous. Sorry. So there. There are no sound wishing.
00:08:03.404 - 00:09:05.018, Speaker A: So this is a how did I go back? Oh, finish. Not a lot of us. How they handle. Back. This is back. Okay, so here, so the function here you can see the function and five and a mu and continues, even continuous, there's no solution in the theory. We can prove that.
00:09:05.018 - 00:09:29.902, Speaker A: So therefore, if you set up the model, you're just going to do it. They have trouble. So you have a problem here. But I think a numerical method, they can whatever, even those solution they can go into got a solution. So, so, therefore, but in theory, and we cannot do that, there's no solution. So we can justify. So therefore we need a search for which kind of a function and what kind of lambda.
00:09:29.902 - 00:09:52.226, Speaker A: We have a solution. So for example for this one here. So we need to go to decide and put sign the norm and alpha. So how you can justify the self solution. So I know what's the number. So there's no solution. Sometimes of five side, there's no solution.
00:09:52.226 - 00:10:37.194, Speaker A: So if the load continues, there's more challenge as well. So usually method, what we do, we're changing the differential equation into the water or Hammerstein equation or some kind of operator equations. So you use this PDE, we will use this one. So, because we cannot find a curl or green function, it's not difficult to find a green function in that case. So therefore, for PDE. So we were going to, and there's some general operator there. Now we can use a theory here.
00:10:37.194 - 00:11:29.404, Speaker A: So to first one is the fixed point theorem. Let's use it to find a non zero solution. Non negative, okay, degree theory, of course, but it's not zero or not a non negative. And fixed point theory usually ball something like that and a variation in quality. So this one and last one is within u as well. So how you can use very inequality theory to go to non zero, non negative positive solution. Okay, the challenge thing is if you want to go to good optimal lambda and a function and the nonlinear routine, so there's some kind of things you have to go to solve.
00:11:29.404 - 00:12:02.094, Speaker A: So you will need to set up some kind of theory, u theory. That's why right now that people cannot got a good lambda, the eigenvalue, the lambda one, lambda two, because there's some theory we need, they cannot follow. So, so therefore there's a first line is compactness. So nonlinear mamp. And you have to go to show this is compactness. You want to use a fixed point index theory. The big difference is the problems the green function in the kernel and have a singularity.
00:12:02.094 - 00:12:27.214, Speaker A: So let predominate convergence theory. You cannot use it. So that is a cause trouble. So. And in the fractional differential equation, a lot of people made a mistake. We have solving papers wrong paper because they treated a singularity as a continuous function. So therefore, there's so many wrong paper right now for the fractional differential equation.
00:12:27.214 - 00:12:57.280, Speaker A: And also how to show the map is lower loam out map. So for the fixed point theory, if you want to use. And another one, everybody familiar with limited in frame or supreme function. So you know the definition usually in r1. But if you go to product balance space, there's a challenge. Okay, that's challenging how you can use that. So you only made a mistake.
00:12:57.280 - 00:13:36.106, Speaker A: Okay, use the idea from one dimension, you'll make a mistake. So how to compute the subframe and then limit the subframe or limit in frame in product space. So, for example, you have a population model in the system predator pre model. So right hand side, the term how you can go to computer input in frame or sub frame. So such kind of theory we need to go to setup. So otherwise you cannot work on it. Okay, so this is, I don't think I can finish everything.
00:13:36.106 - 00:14:17.624, Speaker A: So there's a first order, I want to mention this. And there's a mode. There's a new one, actually. So, although so many people work on this, so, and this is similar to first order differential equation. If you take n equals one and this boundary condition. So here, and you not require as a derivative everywhere on ab. So usually first order, you started the model and you have suppose the function u is d defined everywhere, right? Appendices and belongs to absolute continuous function.
00:14:17.624 - 00:14:46.778, Speaker A: So therefore, this is a challenge part. What's the meaning of mathematical biology in this case? Because this really weak u is not has a derivative everywhere. So this is some kind of information about what integrated operator. And that's the challenges. You can say here, say x equals y. That's a singularity. It's unbounded.
00:14:46.778 - 00:15:24.130, Speaker A: You cannot use regular Leibniz dominant convergence theory. So therefore, here for compactness and continuity operator. This also causes trouble. So the people you go load this, they treat this as a continuous function. That's why they cause a lot of round paper here. So there are several type fractional differential operator here. So we interesting one is a capital, you can see here.
00:15:24.130 - 00:16:00.164, Speaker A: Suppose if n equals one. So they have a first derivative, the first derivative pattern rotor everywhere divide. And this together with the integral minus e equals right hand side. So right hand side can be your logistical model. And so therefore, it's contained in a first order differential equation. So therefore, some of you, if you study the first order or system. So, maybe you can consider setup your theory to the fractional and differential equation here.
00:16:00.164 - 00:16:46.340, Speaker A: So, this is a difference length order and mean value theorem. So, recently I solved this mean value theorem. Everybody understand what's the mean value theorem? And you can say you are going to require. And function continues and has a derivative everywhere. So, but right now this we don't only need that. So, derivative maybe exists everywhere. So mean modest thing is, everybody's, if you know the calculus, right? So you want the f prime has a derivative everywhere inside, okay, inside ab.
00:16:46.340 - 00:17:10.754, Speaker A: But right now it's not necessary. So we will have that. So that's first things. And the second things is we have non constant equilibria you never made. So non constant equilibrium. So, if you start a first order system of a first order differential equation, only constant equilibria there. So, this is a difference.
00:17:10.754 - 00:17:40.962, Speaker A: So you be careful. So, if you go to study system of first order fractional differential equation. So, that's the case. So, we have an example here to show you. And there's a long constant equilibrium here. So, this mean value theorem, okay, so that's a classic one. So, f exists everywhere on ab, inside of ab.
00:17:40.962 - 00:18:13.484, Speaker A: So we got this. So, everybody familiar with this one? So you exist one number between ab. So, for the fractional one, so there some change, but they neuro require f has derivative. And everywhere in ab, they just suppose if absolute continuous function. So, absolute continuous function has derivative and everywhere, almost everywhere. So therefore, they cannot have everywhere in this case. So therefore, this is the more general case.
00:18:13.484 - 00:18:52.724, Speaker A: Okay, this example show you and the classic mean value theorem cannot apply here, because the derivative does not exist here. This function derivative does not exist. So, therefore, mean value theorem for classic one, it cannot be used here. And so, for fractional one, we can use it here. So therefore. And this is something new here. Okay, so this method, I think no more time.
00:18:52.724 - 00:19:27.400, Speaker A: And the challenge here is singularity. I already mentioned that as saudi paper. So if you want to search wrong paper, you should go to the fractional case rational calculus. This is tunnel for paper run. So very recently I got a tool paper that's a correct motion. So if you want to do the first order and assisting, I wish you go to study this paper and make sure your everything correct the second one. So gde this one.
00:19:27.400 - 00:19:58.586, Speaker A: So this higher order, this is the first order. So, this is a nonlinear and large vein equations from physics. And almost all the result, I saw this wrong. So, so many people work on this equation here. But none of them. I saw this correct. Okay, so, and therefore, we have to go into redo this.
00:19:58.586 - 00:20:32.198, Speaker A: They always suppose f is continuous, but unfortunately, this, transfer this one to integral equation. That's not equivalent. That's not equivalent. So differential equation, go to integral equation, two equations, not equivalent. So therefore, what they're doing, they actually, they're looking for the solution for the integral equation, not original equation. So therefore, all this part right now, we need to redo right now. So, therefore, we should have students interested in this part or go to work on it.
00:20:32.198 - 00:20:57.788, Speaker A: And for example, here, I gave you two recent paper. So this kind of a paper is all round paper. So this is here. So potential topics in fractional calculus. So theory and application. So even first order. And we need to go into set up the basic theory.
00:20:57.788 - 00:21:30.578, Speaker A: So, basic theory, existence, uniqueness, local solution. So everybody familiar with this one for ordinary. So first order differential equation. But right now for the fractional and what we're going to do, and also the nonlinearity f, right hand side is not continuous. How to do that? So, usually first order, the theory, you can see the function suppose if it's continuous. So that's why I'm looking for the result, even for the first order. So, right hand side is not continuous.
00:21:30.578 - 00:22:05.220, Speaker A: What's the theory here? So, for the existence. So, of course, nonlinear, non driving equation, we need to redo it. And a biological interpretation, because there's a fractional reason from physics. Okay, originally from physics. So right now, how about a biological interpretation? First derivative, what's its meaning from there? And modeling and how to do that? Use a fractional to model. So not only rate of change. So first order, the derivative.
00:22:05.220 - 00:22:35.504, Speaker A: I would explain that. So therefore, I think it's quite interesting. So I wish some researcher and grad students and wish them go there to work on it. And also canadian mathematician, so many work on the mathematical biology. So I think if all together, we can go to good things from here, this part. So, because original model from physics, how they can use this one to the mathematical biology. So that's interesting.
00:22:35.504 - 00:23:44.118, Speaker A: So, what time? I finish? How much time? Okay, now we go to second order and equation. So this kind of equation for the first order. And basically, and if it's not, continues, we set up a result with my student here, and we can show first one, the second one, and first one can derive to stir Lioville equation. So, this is a boundary condition, contained several boundary conditions here. Newman boundary condition, and the Robin boundary condition here. So for this one, so they contain several. So this we work on this case.
00:23:44.118 - 00:24:33.382, Speaker A: So usually the boundary condition, the parameter here is always positive. And so many people work on that is positive. But very recently and we with Professor Wu and Xiaoyi, our previous postal and we solve the problems parameter the boundaries parameter taking negative value. And we derive the green function and also some kind of function we can transfer to this case. So, which contain negative value. So we gave you example there. So after this, so how you can find solution and then non zero solution.
00:24:33.382 - 00:24:57.524, Speaker A: And if f negative. So the mathematical biology model how we can go to existence for the solution. So there's quite a new nobody do it right now. And also I do not have time to work on that. Maybe in the future my students can work on that. Ask them to do that. So the parameter taken negative and how to do this kind of existence.
00:24:57.524 - 00:25:39.800, Speaker A: And so I said a first order and stereo newware differential equation I with my students. And so there's a part how to use the fixed point theory for nowhere outcome map to solve such an equation. So we did something. And because of the challenge how to show the operator is nowhere outcome map. So that's a difficulty. And also how you can show your solution is strictly positive solution. That's a very very challenging the two things very challenging.
00:25:39.800 - 00:26:18.594, Speaker A: So if you overcome that too. So you can go to the paper. So. So right now my students once Zaiyi in the Waterloo, I think with the engineering to supervisor and Chong Ming and go to Queen's university, I think with the professor days. So there. So potential topics system. So and even one first in one dimension.
00:26:18.594 - 00:26:44.874, Speaker A: So system how not do it. So we want to go to one equation. So for the system that means you can use to predict model. So this is how to do this kind of predator model. So this in the future topics. So how to do the first order in one dimension. So how to do that and for the system, so always difficult here and also.
00:26:44.874 - 00:27:04.646, Speaker A: And D part negative here how to do this case D negative. So you can move this one to right hand side. So you can treat this as D is negative. Go to right hand side. This is positive, right. So minus D is positive. So this term we can explain this as stalking.
00:27:04.646 - 00:27:39.384, Speaker A: So in the application that's how to deal with the stalking. So what's green function? And how to go to. How to go to existence of solutions. So this is a topic we are working on it right now with my future grand students. So. So second PDE. So this is more general right now, say in the two dimension at least and the boundary condition here.
00:27:39.384 - 00:28:06.750, Speaker A: And so this is more challenge for this case. So right now, this is a special case. So Laplace equation, diffusion motivation. And this case for the first page. So, boundary condition contain an altinista. We know there's three cases. And Derek and Newman.
00:28:06.750 - 00:28:36.914, Speaker A: Usually people work on the Newman boundary conditioning. A lot of paper, they do that because it's a little bit easier. So recent paper. So we did this one only for direct boundary condition. I did this one with professor in Fudan University. So this paper already published. And the second one is system.
00:28:36.914 - 00:29:19.214, Speaker A: So this paper load published. So the challenge is how you can show the green function where the operator and there is nowhere out one dimension. So how to show this is nonlinear ramp is a lower normal outward ramp if you want to use a fixed point index theory. So this is this theory how you can go to lambda, very good. Lambda. So right now, the people only work on the Laplace equation. And so Laplace equation and lambda, just take some of them.
00:29:19.214 - 00:29:36.334, Speaker A: Some of them depends on the x. That's not very good. So. So therefore, we want to go to improve such kind of results and got an optimum interval for eigenvalues. Okay, thank you.
