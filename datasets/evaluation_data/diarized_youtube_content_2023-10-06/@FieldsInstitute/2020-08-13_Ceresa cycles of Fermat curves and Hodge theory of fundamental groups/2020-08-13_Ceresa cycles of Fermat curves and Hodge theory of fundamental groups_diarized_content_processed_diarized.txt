00:00:00.160 - 00:00:12.554, Speaker A: Okay, very good. Welcome everyone to the fields number theory seminar. Delighted to introduce Paimon scandaly from University of Toronto. He'll speak about Chirisa cycles of fermat curves and Hodge theory.
00:00:13.134 - 00:00:40.602, Speaker B: Yes, Hodge theory of fundamental curves. Let me share my screen. Okay. Okay. Hi everyone. Can everyone see my screen now?
00:00:40.778 - 00:00:41.322, Speaker A: Yes.
00:00:41.418 - 00:01:38.642, Speaker B: Okay, perfect. So thanks for, thanks the organizers for the opportunity to speak here. So today I'm going to be speaking, speaking about there is the cycles of Fermi curves and Hodge theory of the fundamental group. So recall that on a projected variety, on a smooth projected variety, there are different notions of equivalence on algebraic cycle. So remember, an algebraic cycle is a z linear formal linear z linear combination of the set of closed, irritable closed up schemes of the variety. And so we're actually going to often in this talk, well, actually for most of the talk, we're going to look at algebraic cycles with coefficients in Q. So we look at q linear combinations of these.
00:01:38.642 - 00:02:20.862, Speaker B: But there are different notions of equivalence on these things. And among these are rational, algebraic and homological equivalents. So rough definitions, rationally trivial cycles are, these are subgroup of rational trivial cycles is generated by differences of cycles that can be deformed to one another along p. One algebraic equivalence would be along an algebraic curve. And then homologically trivial cycles are those that are in the kernel of the class map. So remember, there's a class map going from algebraic cycles to cohomology. So co dimension p algebraic cycles to h upper two p.
00:02:20.862 - 00:03:04.544, Speaker B: And the kernel of those things are homologically treated algebraic cycles. So these homological treated ones would be the boundaries of topological chain. So topological singular chain. So here we're looking at the variety as analytical space and topology is the analytic topology. Now, so throughout the start, I'm going to be using this notation by script Znxq I would mean the space of algebraic n cycles for dimension NRX with coefficients in Q. I will be using superscripts Rita ALG and H O M for rationally, algebraically and homological homologically trivial subspaces. And then so one has these inclusions.
00:03:04.544 - 00:03:49.202, Speaker B: So a rational trivial cycle is algebraically trivial and algebraically trivial cycle is homologically trivial, but it is inclusive, are in general straight. And we're going to say a little more about that now. So for zero cycles, algebraic and homological trivial are the same for divisors. So these are co dimension one cycles. There's a theorem of Ayamatsu Saka that says that after tensoring with q, these things will be the same. So actually yeah, so, so this will be zero if you work with divisors. So if you're trying to find an example where homological and algebraical trivial cycles really are, those notions are really different.
00:03:49.202 - 00:04:29.106, Speaker B: You have to go to look at varieties that at least have dimension three. And there's a theorem of prefetch in 1969. It says that if you take a general quintic in p four, then the rational Griffiths group is a non zero. So in other words, there's an algebra. There are homologically trivial cycles that are infinite order modulo algebraic equivalents. And then Clemens in 1983 has shown that actually this thing is not even finitely generated, even though it's count. So now let x be a curve.
00:04:29.106 - 00:05:10.672, Speaker B: And so this notation is actually, it's going to be sort of stay in the talk. So it's important to try to remember this. So if x is a curve by Jack you in the jacobian of X, and then if you take a point e in x by x, sub e, it would mean the image of x under the embedding of x into its jacobian using the base point e. So it sends any point x to x minus e, and that's going to give you an embedding of x into the jacobian. So the genus has to be bigger than or equal to one there, and then xe minus. By that we mean the image of Xe under the inversion map. So multiplication by minus one on the jacobian.
00:05:10.672 - 00:05:55.584, Speaker B: And it's easy to see that this difference is homologically trivial. It's homologically trivial. One cycle under Jacobia and the theorem of Seresa asserts that if you take a generic curve of gene is at least three, by the way, again, so if you're trying to say that this is not, you want to distinguish between homological algebraic triviality. So again, that first observation that you want to go to dimension at least three. So you want to at least look at some, something that has genus three here for the curve. And Theresa, proof that for a generic curve of genus at least three, that cycle is not algebraically trivial. And then, so by this difference.
00:05:55.584 - 00:06:40.150, Speaker B: So this difference we're going to call, we're going to refer to it the Sereso cycle of x with base point e. In this stuff, there are also higher Seriza cycles, but I'm only going to be discussing this one. Now. One thing to keep in mind is that this is for a generic curve. But up until this point, there weren't any explicit examples that would distinguish between homological and algebraic equivalents. The first explicit example of a homologically trivial cycle which is not algebraically trivial, was given by Bruno Harrison in 1983. So he showed that the Serena cycle of the Fermat curve of degree four is not homologically trivial.
00:06:40.150 - 00:07:29.918, Speaker B: And the way this was done was as follows. And this is going to, these ideas are going to appear later on in this talk, too. So he showed that he was able to express the Abel Jacobi image of the Serezo cycle in terms of iterated integrals, and therefore thermal curves. These things become really, really nice. And then by using that, exploiting that, he was able to show that for a thermal curve of degree four, the Seresi cycle is not algebraically triggered. Shortly after, Harris Bloch, by using an elaborate argument, was able to show that Seresa cycle of f four, of degree four is in fact of infinite order modular algebraic equivalence. Now, more recently, so these results are all.
00:07:29.918 - 00:08:30.868, Speaker B: In 2010, Osbo and Tadakoro have been able to generalize Harris's method. So they've obtained non triviality results, modular algebraic for series cycles of some other examples. So the point is that they really build on Harris's idea. So you find sufficient conditions for non triviality of the serendipity cycle module, hydrobriking pool lens in terms of non integrality of some integrals. And in those integrals, you know, in the case you're dealing with the Fermat curve or quotient, so on and so forth, those integrals, there are special values of very nice functions, like hypergamy functions, actually. And so basically, you have a sufficient condition to prove this type of result. Non triviality, modular algebraical glands, if you could show that those integrals are not integers, and then you can do that numerically when you're dealing with specific examples.
00:08:30.868 - 00:09:14.128, Speaker B: And that's exactly what they did. That's what Harris does, and that's what Tadakora and Otsubo do in these examples. And that's why, you know, there's like thermal curves of degree up to a thousand. So this sort of argument, we're going to come back to this. I'm going to, in the last style, I'm going to say more about this technique, but you're always limited by, you know, you have to, in the end, always, there's a numerical calculation. But now, the purpose of this talk is to prove the following theorem, which is a joint work with Kumar Martini, that the series of cycles of thermocerves of prime degree greater than seven are of infinite order modular rational equation. So it's not algebraic it's rational, it's weaker than that.
00:09:14.128 - 00:10:04.956, Speaker B: But at least you're getting an infinite family and you're saying they actually have infinite order, not just non trivial. And the proof combines several results on harsh theory. So basically several transcendental algebraic geometry results, harsh theory of a quadratic integral occurred. And then on the other hand, two results of gross and Rohrlich, which are more number theoretic. It combines these results. So the goal would be to basically go over this proof. Any, any questions up to this point? Okay, so the plan for the rest of the talk is the following.
00:10:04.956 - 00:10:54.114, Speaker B: I'm going to start by a brief review of the definition of the Abel Jacob, and then we're going to talk a little bit about x groups in the category of mixed hodge structures. And by the way, so for essentially all of this talk, every time I talk about Hodge structures, these are all rational. We're forgetting the integral structure. And then we're going to talk a little bit about harsh theory of fundamental groups, and then we're going to go over the proof and then there's going to be some final remarks. So, as I said, so our result is about rational equivalence. And I'm going to make some final remarks on algebraic equivalence, results for algebraic equivalence. And then we're going to actually go back to the results of Harris and argument of Harris, basically, take another look at that.
00:10:54.114 - 00:11:35.826, Speaker B: Now, some of these things, the first two items were also in the pre talk slides in much more detail, but I just want to go over them very briefly here. So some sort of shorter version of this, what we had in the pre top. So let's start with a brief review of apple Jacobi maps. So, first, notation, some notation. Suppose you have a hard structure of a odd weight, two n minus one. Then the intermediate Jacobian of the ad is defined to be this quotient. So you take the, so this is the underlying complex vector space and you mod that out by fn.
00:11:35.826 - 00:12:42.204, Speaker B: So remember the weight is two, n minus one, and you're modding out by fn of that, and then plus the underlying rational vector space. Now for a second, suppose h was an integral hard structure, actually. Then you're talking, when you take the intermediate Jacobian, instead of modding out by hq, you can mod out by hz, the integral lattice. And then what you're going to get in that case is that because you took, you know, exactly the middle ones here I put in where the weight is two n minus one, what you're going to get is. So if you have the underlying ability group here, you would actually get a compact complex torus. So, you know, in the case that you're working with h, one of the curve, for example, this would be exactly the classical Jacobian basically after curve. Again, if you have a, if you're taking HZ here and then, so working and then modding up by hq would be like taking that complex, compact complex torus and actually modding it out by its torsion.
00:12:42.204 - 00:13:42.836, Speaker B: Sub one thing that I want to say about that compact complex torus is that in general, so even if you're dealing with a cohomology of a smooth projected variety, still in general, this compact complex torus that you're going to get is not going to be an abelian variety. It's not going to be, it's not going to be algebraic. So for basically the lowest degree and highest degree, it is going to be, you're going to get Albanese and Picard varieties and then everything in the middle, all weights in the middle, you're probably not going to get anything algebraic. So by JH, we mean this quotient here. And now the Griffiths about Jacobi Map and everything here up until the very, very last slide is tensor with Q. The Griffiths above Jacob map, tensor with q is a map denoted by aj. So it's going to go with, from homologically trivial cycles, modular rationally trivial cycles.
00:13:42.836 - 00:14:54.624, Speaker B: So this is the homologically trivial subgroup of, of the chagrin of n cycles goes from there to this intermediate Jacobian, and it's defined as follows. So first thing to note is that this guy here, so this intermediate jacobian, actually it can be identified with this quotient here. And the point is that, see, h lower to n plus one has weight minus two, n minus one. So going back to the previous a slide where we define this intermediate Jacobian, you have to mod out by f minus n of that. And if minus n of that would be. So, thinking about homology as dual of cohomology, would be those maps that vanish on fn plus one. So this quotient is now, you know, all the dual of cohomology functional on cohomology modded out by those that vanish off in plus one and then plus this q lattice.
00:14:54.624 - 00:15:41.544, Speaker B: So that becomes now functional on fn plus one of h two, n plus one, but the dual of that modded out by integral by rational homology. So there's a bit of abusive notation here. So we're taking here by this, I mean the image of this in this dual space, of course. So this intermediate jacobian can be identified with this quotient. And I've given a cycle, a homologically trivial n cycle. There you pick a rational topological two n plus 1 second so that it has complex dimension n, so real dimension two n. So that's why you have here two n plus one cycle gamma, whose boundary is z.
00:15:41.544 - 00:16:37.228, Speaker B: And then, and then given a smooth, so take given an element of a of this space, you can represent it by something, by a closed twent smooth closed twin plus one form omega, which is fn plus one. So it's got at least n plus one. Dzis. And then you said, let's make this definition the integral over a gamma of the cohomology class of omega is defined to be just the integral of omega over gamma. So now, because you took a representative in fn plus one, one can easily see that this is actually well defined, doesn't depend on the, on the choice of omega. It's actually a well defined element of this dual, of this dual space. And then, but of course, there's a dependence on gamma.
00:16:37.228 - 00:17:32.334, Speaker B: And to get rid of that dependence on gamma, you have to out by rational homology. So the abol Jacobi of z, by definition, is the class of that functional integration over gamma in this quotient, which is now well defined because you modeled that by homology. And that is just this intermediate jacobian that was the Jacobi map. And now a word about extensions of mixed hard structures. Now, okay, so given a mixed height structure age, for simplicity, we're going to assume that it has a positive weight two n plus one. And there's a theorem of Carlson, which is much more general than this. But in this case, it's going to tell us that there's a functorial isomorphism between extensions.
00:17:32.334 - 00:18:22.294, Speaker B: So this x groups, all x groups that appear in the talk are extensions in the category of rational hodgepodge structures, extensions of a by q minus n. This is canonically isomorphic to this intermediate Jacobia of a dual. And the isomorphism is as follows. So take an extension like this, and then you're going to send this to the following element of the intermediate Jacobia. You're going to pick a, a section of this map PI defined over C, which is compatible with the Hodge filtration. So let's call such a thing s. And then you also are going to choose a retraction of the map I order, which is defined over q.
00:18:22.294 - 00:19:21.354, Speaker B: Let r be such a retraction. And then you look at Ros, and now that's going to be map from Ac to c as an amount of a dual complex underlying complex fixtures based upon a dual. And you're going to send the extension to the class of Ros, that's Carlson's isomorphs. As I said, it's more general than this. You know, the condition and the weight being positive, we can get rid of that. It's a general result about extensions of massage. Now, if you take a to be h two n plus one of x, expanding a smooth projected variety, then what we get is that we can identify the extensions of h two n plus one by q minus n with the intermediate Jacobian of H of homology of two n plus one degree homology.
00:19:21.354 - 00:20:12.964, Speaker B: So, you know, the reason this is important, interesting, it shows up here is that, you know, we're gonna, the Abel Jacobi map takes algebraic cycles to an intermediate jacobian like this. And then what? This can be identified and extended with x group of massage structures. And then, so you get from algebraic cycles to x groups of massage structures. Okay, any questions up to this point? So now let's spend a couple of slides on harsh theory of PI. So, I didn't put anything in the pre talk on this. Let's go over this a little more carefully. So, let x be a smooth but not necessarily projective complex variety.
00:20:12.964 - 00:20:52.396, Speaker B: So, it's important to keep in mind here for this picture here, you're not assuming that your variety, your complex variety is actually projected. And let's take e to the point in x. This e is going to be our base point. And then you can consider the map from this group, algebra, the fundamental group. So, fundamental group here is the topological fundamental group. You're thinking of x as, as a complex manifold. And this is the classical fundamental group from this algebra group, algebra to q, which sends every element of PI one to one.
00:20:52.396 - 00:21:34.772, Speaker B: The kernel of that is called I. And then by some old works of very nice works of Chan Kt Chan, one knows that the elements of this quotient of this guy. So these are, you know, these are functionals on I that vanish on n plus one power of r. These functionals can be, can be described using a homotopy invariant. So close means homotopy invariant using homotopy invariant, iterated integral. So iterated integral. These are, these are integrals over simplicity.
00:21:34.772 - 00:22:13.932, Speaker B: And close means that, you know, the value that they produce is not going to depend on the homotopy class of them. But the point is that the elements here can be written as some iterated integrals. And then Hain has used this description to define a mix hall structure on this space. So we're going to denote this massage structures by ln. So, and the l I'm using because it's like length, because these are integrated integrals of length at most n. That sort of explains the notation we're using here. Now, this mixture structure.
00:22:13.932 - 00:22:39.840, Speaker B: So I'm going to take it basically as a black box here. The only things I want to mention about is that it's functorial with respect to the pointed variety. And also these inclusions that you have, these are morphism. So really you're getting end objects in the category of a thought structure. And then h. See, as I said, so these are iterated integrals. So, you know, just sort of, to give us some sort of rough idea here, you know, each of these things can be written as an integral.
00:22:39.840 - 00:23:28.944, Speaker B: And then, you know, there's differential forms that show up there. The filtrations, weight and hard is defined sort of, you know, in the way that you would expect, building on, you know, how those filtrations are, can be described for cohomology, basically. So you look at. So first thing is that, you know, one shows that all these iterator integrals will be obtained if we just focus out, just restrict ourselves to working with differential forms that have at most logarithmic, most differential forms that have at most logarithmic different singularity at infinity. And then the weight filtration is defined in terms of, you know, the order of the poles, basically. And the harsh filtration is defined in terms of how many polymorphic differentials you're using. And now one thing that I want to mention is that l one.
00:23:28.944 - 00:24:18.124, Speaker B: So this length one one, this is just, you know, h one h upper one. And this is independent of e. But then if you look at higher length, what happens in higher lengths? These mixed hard structures actually do depend on the base point. So now in this talk we're particularly, well, we're only interested in the case that n is two. So quadratic integrated integrals and then one. So these are, you know, these are functionals on the augmentation idea that vanishes on I cubed. Now, one has amorphous from l two of xe to h one of x tensor h one of x.
00:24:18.124 - 00:24:57.054, Speaker B: So how is the smorphism defined? So, you know, take an element of l two. So that's class of some f if being a function on I, which vanishes on iq. And then the element that you're going to correspond to that here is as follows. So h one tensor h one upper one is the dual of h lower one tensor, h lower one. And so given an element of h, one tends to h. So class of gamma one, class of gamma two, gamma one, gamma two, being elements of the fundamental group of x base point e. You're going to send this to a.
00:24:57.054 - 00:25:33.366, Speaker B: So gamma one minus one, gamma two minus one. So these guys, this is in I and this is in I. This whole thing is going to be in I squared, and then you valued f on that element. And now this is actually going to be well defined. So if I change, you know, if I take a different representative, different representative, it's going to be well defined because this f vanishes on IQ. Now the kernel of this map. So what's the kernel of this map? The kernel of this map, so as we can see from the definition would be those f classes of those f's which vanish on I squared.
00:25:33.366 - 00:26:12.394, Speaker B: I'm gonna get I squared here with each vanish on I squared. So the kernel is just a. Well, those that vanish on I squared, that's just h one. H upper one, it's l lower one, say those are length one. So it's first cohomology. Any, any question about these two slides maybe? Okay, so now, so now we're going to go back. So from this point on we're going to go really about talking about the case that we're interested in.
00:26:12.394 - 00:26:58.544, Speaker B: So from this point on, x is going to be smooth projected a curve over c, and we're going to take two distinct point e and infinity in x. And we're going to identify first cohomology of x, first cohomology of the puncture curve x minus infinity through the inclusion of the open curve into the compact curve. And then we're just going to abbreviate that. I'm just going to write h one for that to simplify the notation a little bit. And by the previous slide, see, in the previous slide, we had these maps going from a. Did I think there was something here in this? Oh yeah. So there is also this thing in.
00:26:58.544 - 00:27:24.732, Speaker B: Right, there's also, yeah, so there's something here that I forgot to mention. Good thing that I did put in slides. So the kernel is h one. But what's the image of this map? The image of this map, one can show that it's the kernel of the cop product. So the cop product going from h upper one to h upper h upper one, h upper two. And the kernel of that is denoted by h one, tends to h one. The whole thing prime.
00:27:24.732 - 00:28:07.414, Speaker B: And the image of this map is the kernel of the cop product. Now, right. So by what we just said, going back to the case of interest with x is a smooth curve, and these two distinct points are taken. So l two of x, so maps into. Okay, so now, you know, for the punctured curve, the kernel of the cow product is all of h one tensor, h one, because h upper two is zero. So the bottom row here is the image. So this map is the map of the previous slide.
00:28:07.414 - 00:28:57.008, Speaker B: So this map is the map of the previous slide. Now it's going to be surjective because car product vanishes on that, and that's the kernel. So you get this sequence for the open curve and for the compact curve, you get this sequence here, and that's the kernel of the car product. Now, so we get these two extensions that are going to play a crucial role in the rest of the talk. So let's give these two extensions names. I'm going to refer to the extension top extension by e, sub e, and in the bottom extension by e, sub e infinity. So this is an extension that you're getting from quadratic integrals on a punctured curve, x minus infinity, taking e as the base point.
00:28:57.008 - 00:29:46.104, Speaker B: And this is the extension that you're just getting on the compact curve with e as the base point. So you get these two extensions and you know, okay, so ee is an extension of a current of the cop product by h one. And we're going to use concorde duality to bring this h one to the side. So identify this with extensions of a h one tensor kind of car product by q minus one. And then similarly, again, describing an extension of h one tensor h one by h one. And you're going to use car product to break h one to the other side and get extension of a, the third tensile power of h one by q minus one. Okay, so now we are ready to go and talk about the proof of the theorem.
00:29:46.104 - 00:30:27.908, Speaker B: So the proof is an application of the combination of the following results. So as I said, there are several results on the hodge theory side, transcendental algebraic theoretic results. And then there's a, there's a couple of number theoretic results that appear here. So the trans and the harsh theoretical results are these three, at least two. Well, so the works of Harris, these two items. So, Bruno, Harris and paltry on the relation between sereso cycle and extension ee. We're going to talk about the, in detail in a bit, in a few minutes.
00:30:27.908 - 00:30:51.424, Speaker B: So these are results from eighties. There are works of Canders and Roger. Sowell much more recent. 2000 120. Twelve. These are the extension corresponding to the punctured curve. So the extension corresponding to the puncture curve includes more information.
00:30:51.424 - 00:31:43.254, Speaker B: Then the extension corresponding to the compact curve, the one for compact, sits inside the one for the puncture curve. And then, so these are the harsh theoretic results. And then the number theoretic results are results of gross and Rohrlech on points of infinite order. On the jacobian of thermal curves. Then there's, and then the other one is the well known result of Rohrlech that says that on thermal curves, if you take a point on the Jacobian of a thermal curve which is supported on the, on the cusps. So cusps, meaning the points where, you know, one of the three core, well, one of the coordinates is zero. If you take a point on the Jacobian which is supported on the set of cusps, then this point is a torsion point of the Jacobian.
00:31:43.254 - 00:32:15.554, Speaker B: So now remember what we're trying to prove. We're trying to prove that the series cycle of fermat curves of a prime degree p greater than seven is a, is a. Well, is often in order module rational equivalence. But because you're working with the Abel Jacobi map is tensor with q. So that amounts to. Well, so it's enough if you show that the Abel Jacobi image of it, remember this is the rational Jacobi image, is actually non zero. So now let's start the proof.
00:32:15.554 - 00:33:06.838, Speaker B: So the way I've sort of organized this argument is that, you know, anytime we need one of these results, I'm gonna, anytime we need one of these results, I'm gonna remind us of that result first. And then I'm gonna use it to get what we want. So the first thing to recall is a theorem of a Darman and Roger sols. So here's the theorem. So let's take x. So x is the smooth projective curve over c, and e and infinity are distinct points here, as usual. So let's take, let z be a one cycle on x, cross x and the delta be the diagonal of x, now intersecting z with the dia.
00:33:06.838 - 00:33:31.336, Speaker B: So z twelve. By that I mean the intersection of z with the diagonal. But we want to think of that as something being in. So that's going to be a zero cycle, zero cycle. It's on the diagonal. And we're going to think of that as an element of a zero cycle on x itself by identifying x with the diagonal. So that's a zero cycle on x.
00:33:31.336 - 00:34:26.702, Speaker B: And then so by pz we mean z twelve minus its degree times e. So that's now a point on the Jacobian. Now, this point is related to this extension as follows. So let, let's see that h one tensor h one kuneth component of the class of z. Now, if you go from, so tensoring with cz is a Hodge class. So tensoring with that is going to give us a map from h one twisted h one to h one tensor q. And then, so pulling back along that is going to give us a map which I'm going to denote.
00:34:26.702 - 00:35:20.154, Speaker B: This is the inverse, going from extensions of h one tensor cubed by q minus one to extensions of h one minus one by q minus one. But then, you know, tensor everything with q one, make it extensions of h one by q zero. And now this guy here is a, well, by Carlson's theorem, it's the intermediate jacobian of h lower one, or the dual of h upper one. And then, like the classical Abel Jacobi map, this is a, can be this isomorphic to the points on the jacobian tensor with Q. So homologically, right, so this is divisors, modular principal divisors. And then you tensor that with Q everything, because this was tensor by q. That's why they are also.
00:35:20.154 - 00:35:47.432, Speaker B: So you get a map from here to here, which we're going to call it Caesar inverse. And then, theorem of Diamond Roger souls asserts that, asserts that if you take so in here, you have this extension e infinity. There's too many e's here, which is hard to say. I should have thought of that. But every time I speak about this thing, I think that I should change the notation. But then I ended up, I end up writing the same thing. But there's a.
00:35:47.432 - 00:36:43.152, Speaker B: So this extension is an element here. And so the image of that is now an element of the, of this, of this child group, considered two rational child group, subgroup of the child group. And so what the theorem asserts is that this point is just the integral of Cz over the diagonal times infinity minus e. So that's now a point on jacobian then minus P Z. So that's how pz is related to this extension here. Now let's use this result and try to prove that when x is thermal curve of degree prime p greater than seven and e infinity and e, this should be e. My apologies.
00:36:43.152 - 00:37:32.698, Speaker B: Infinity and e are costs. Then this extension is non zero as an extension of rational mixtot structure. So this infinity and e, we're taking them to be cusps here and now. Okay, so what you're going to take as z is the graph of the automorphism of Fp, which, which this automorphism and this automorphism, it has a two fixed points, a little calculation show that has two fixed points. The fixed points are these two where eta is a primitive six foot affinity. So pz, remember what pz was? Pz was z twelve. So when you intersect with this delta, you're exactly, you know, picking up the fixed points and then minus the minus degree times e.
00:37:32.698 - 00:38:18.114, Speaker B: So p z is just q q plus q bar minus two e. So this is the point that we get. And then there's this theorem of gross and Rohr from the seventies that says that if p is a prime greater than seven, this point is a point of infinite order on the jacobian of FP. And now on the other hand. Okay, so Rohr tells us that infinity minus e is torsion and jacobian because these two are, because infinity, and here taken to be costs. So, going back to the formula of Darman Roger Sols, so this guy is a, you know, because things are tensor with q here. So this is now zero.
00:38:18.114 - 00:39:04.274, Speaker B: And then this one here is something non zero. So this is non zero. And so our extension is non zero. So that's the. So, so far, what we've proved by combining Darwin, Roger Salt and gross roller is that if you take vermiculite degree prime grade seven, if infinity and e are cost, then this extension is non zero. So now the next step is now to use some results of Harrison and Palti and canders. So now we're going to be using results again, these are theoretical results.
00:39:04.274 - 00:39:30.976, Speaker B: So now let's recall these two results. I'm going to go back to the generality of, you know, just a small projective curve. And then we're going to apply to thermal curve in top of slides. But in the general, in a more general scenario, again, let's. Right. So C delta is the same as before. And then we got, we have the decomposition of rational hard structures.
00:39:30.976 - 00:40:17.848, Speaker B: So h one things are h one decomposes as the kernel of the car product plus plus, you know, q times c delta, that one dimensional hard structure. So this triple product decomposes like this. And now remember our extension e infinity, instead of calling it e infinity, if you don't mind, I'm just calling e infinity for now. So our extension e infinity is an extension of this guy by q minus one. So now, you know, you can restrict that to these two summons. And these, these results are going to describe those two restrictions to us. So the first is the theorem of Harrison and palty.
00:40:17.848 - 00:41:15.872, Speaker B: This is from the eighties. It says that the restriction of infinity to this component, well, that is simply just, you know, the extension e from earlier. This is the extension that quadratic integrals coming from the projective curve. Now this is half of, of the image of the steris cycle based at e under this composition. So this is, now what you're doing is that you're first taking the, so this is taking the apple Jacobi map. Apple Jacobi on the, on the, on the Jacobian on the jacobian variety is going to take us from a homologous one cycles on the jacobian to this intermediate jacobian of a h, lower three of the Jacobian. But now, okay, so you can identify cohomology of the Jacobian with the exterior algebra and the cohomology of the curve to compact curved cell.
00:41:15.872 - 00:42:11.242, Speaker B: And so now this guy is the intermediate jacobian of the dwell of the third exterior power of h one. And so now this guy here, there's a natural injection from this intermediate jacobian into the, into this intermediate jacobia. Now how does this work? See, it's easy. A small little calculation would show that the map that goes from, so you've got the natural quotient map going from this tensor product to which the third exterior power of h one and one. Easily you can see that that's actually surjective. So dualizing that, you're going to get an injection of this and then you're taking Jacobins. You're going to get an injection of the disintermediate Jacobian into this intermediate jacobian.
00:42:11.242 - 00:43:02.610, Speaker B: And now by call some disintermediated jacobian can be identified with this X group. And what Harrison and paltry says is that, so ee, which is here is the, is half Abel Jacobi of the Seresa cycle. So that's a, that's the restriction to this component. And then the restriction to this component, that's the result of Candace from 2001. It says that the restriction of e infinity. Now this component, okay, so the restriction to this component. So that's now going to be a point in extensions of h one tensors c delta by q minus one, which, well, can be identified with just a.
00:43:02.610 - 00:43:49.780, Speaker B: So this is like h one twisted by minus one. So it can be identified with this. And so it can be, yeah, so CARLSon and then Apple Jacobi, Matt, you can identify it with this guy here. So there should be a subscript, a q here, tensor with q there. So as a point, the restriction to this component as a point in here is this point g being the genus and k being the canonical divisor of the curve. Okay, now we're going to combine, we're going to apply these two result to. Our results are setting again, x is the Fermi curve of degree p prime p and infinity and e.
00:43:49.780 - 00:44:34.676, Speaker B: We're going to take them to be cusps again. So now we know that p being greater than seven, we now know that this extension is non zero. But then, so looking at these restriction of that extension to this component and to this component, the restriction to this component by the result of candles is. Sorry, my apologies. Yeah, so infinity is zero. So we're going to look at restrictions to this component and this component. The restriction to this component is zero by the result of a candidate combined with rolle, actually.
00:44:34.676 - 00:45:09.280, Speaker B: Right. Because so candidates would say that, you know, that that restriction is this, but this is going to be supported on the cost infinity and into b costs. And then, and then, so that that component is zero. And, well, the whole thing being non zero, the whole extension being non zero shows that the restriction to this side is non to this component is non zero. And then by the result of. Harrison, get that, the apple Jacobi of the Seresa cycle has to be non zero. So that is, that is what we do.
00:45:09.280 - 00:45:43.324, Speaker B: So up until this point, what we've shown, well, we've shown our result, except that the base point is not arbitrary. Up until this point, this e has been a, has been a, has been a cusp. But now, okay, so we want to get rid of that, that hypothesis and improve the result for. Get the result for arbitrary base point. Now for arbitrary. So here's what does. Now, again, you know, there's another theorem of a half that we're going to use again.
00:45:43.324 - 00:46:18.456, Speaker B: So again, I'm going to go to the general picture here. Now, arbitrary curve. Now, exterior power of h one. So this is, you know, this is like the third cohomology of the jacobian. It decomposes as the primitive part, primitive cohomology of a of the jacobian. And then a. And then plus, plus this guy here, where this bar, what it's doing is that, remember this c delta was the class of delta in h one tensor h one.
00:46:18.456 - 00:47:01.274, Speaker B: And the bar is taking it to h two of h one. So you get this decomposition in the category of rational hard structures. And then, and then the theorem of Harris tells us that the Abel Jacobi. So, so the apple Jacobi is an Abel Jacobi of the Sereso cycle is an element of the intermediate jacobian of the sky. So now you can restrict that to this component and this component. And what Harris shows, this is his acta paper, actually. He shows that the restriction to the primitive cohomology is independent of the base point.
00:47:01.274 - 00:47:52.340, Speaker B: And then, and then for the restriction into this other component, that's the result of a paltry that says that the restriction of this Abu Jacobi of the Seresi cycle to this component. Now, again, just similar identity as before. You know, you can, you can identify, you can describe the image as something in the jacobian tensor with q. There's a q, and it's going to be this point here and now. Okay, so again, back to the case of interest for us, firmware curve. But for now, so we're trying to get rid of the independence and the, get rid of the hyperinflation. So so far we've shown that, you know, Abol Jacobi of the stereosa cycle is non zero if the base point is a cusp.
00:47:52.340 - 00:48:33.604, Speaker B: And we're trying to get rid of that, that can, that hypothesis of e being a cusp, but for the moment still assume that e is a cusp. So if e is a cusp, then this guy here being supported on the cusp, this is going to be torsion point of the jacobia. So, you know, tensor root q, that just goes away. And then what we get is that. So, no, here, the image of the Abel Jacobi here was non zero. So its restriction to this portion is non zero. But now, well, the restriction to this portion is actually independent of the base point by Harris.
00:48:33.604 - 00:49:12.662, Speaker B: So now we get that actually. So that component is actually non zero for whatever, for any base point. And hence the seresus, the abal Jacobi of the seresocycle is nonzero for any base action. So I'm almost done basically. But because there is time also, I'm going to also go over this slide that I promised. So here, see, what we did here is that we talked about a rational equation equivalents, not algebraic equivalents. And now let's talk a little bit about algebraic equivalence here.
00:49:12.662 - 00:49:43.894, Speaker B: So how would one, you know, users get results about non triviality with respect to algebraic equivalence using this line of thought? So here's sort of general observation. Let y a smooth projected variety and that homologic trivial end cycle. And now in this slide, I'm actually going to take the integral objective Jacobi map. So this is now modding out by integral homology. Now. Now this guy here. So that's the apple Jacobi image of z.
00:49:43.894 - 00:50:43.766, Speaker B: But now this is the main, simple main and very simple observation that if z is actually algebraically trivial, then this guy here, this will vanish on fn two, h two, n plus one. And the point basically is that if z is algebraically trivial, then you know, this, this boundary. So this is something whose boundary is z. You could, you could basically choose that so that it lies in a complex manifold of dimension n plus one. Now, and then so, and then so, you know, and then, and then fn plus two, there will just be zeros. That's why, you know, this apple JAcobi up there is going to vanish on that subspace, and that's going to give us a sufficient condition for non triviality modular algebraic equivalence. And this is what Harris exploited in his original paper.
00:50:43.766 - 00:51:26.260, Speaker B: So Harris expresses the Abel Jacobi image of the seresu cycle in terms of, well, yeah, for any curve in terms of iterated integrals. So that basically, you know, this identity that we looked at before. And then in the case of thermal curve degree four, using the idea that we just discussed, you know, and then the fact that these integrals become integral becomes really nice. Integrals become nice, yeah. Obtains a sufficient condition for algebraic nontriviality in terms of a non integrality of an iterated integral, which involves holomorphic force. Now, because you try to show that something is not an integer, some explicit integral is not an integer. Now you can just do it numerically, approximate it.
00:51:26.260 - 00:52:17.454, Speaker B: And that's what he does, shows that it's not an integer and hence not triviality modulo algebraically. Now, similar line of thought has been more explored by Otsubo and Tadakura recently in the two thousands, more recently in two thousands. And what they, so again, they get results about thermal curves and quotients of thermal occurs in the case of Tadakoro. But the last step of these arguments is always a numerical calculation. So you get a sufficient condition, which is not a numerical thing, but to verify that, now you have to approximate it numerically. And that's what they do. And that's why you don't get results that, you know, for like infinite families, things like that, you, they're not getting definitive results.
00:52:17.454 - 00:53:04.186, Speaker B: Also, this line of thought here, you know, wouldn't tell us, wouldn't say, you know, it's hard to get something about, you know, non torsion ness because now, you know, very simply, sort of like, roughly speaking, now it's like trying to show that something is not rational number. And you can't do that. You can't do that numerically, obviously. But now what you've done here is that, you know, we've used the result of diamond larger salt and then grows Rohrlich. By using those, we've avoided numerical verifications. And in fact, we've been able to show that, you know, there is a cycle as infinite order. But the cause is that we only get it modular rationally equivalents and not algebraic equivalents.
00:53:04.186 - 00:53:26.454, Speaker B: And so, you know, one very interesting question, which I'm going to end my talk with this question, is whether one can somehow strengthen this and, you know, maybe somehow exploit this idea in some way to actually get a result regarding algebraic equivalents. Okay, so thank you. Thanks everyone for listening.
00:53:27.034 - 00:53:58.432, Speaker A: Thank you. You can't hear everybody applauding, but I'm showing. Thank you for. That was a really clear talk. Do we have any questions from the audience? I think you sort of answered everybody's questions already. So the question still remains what we, I mean, what we can do about the infinite order modulo algebraic equivalence, right?
00:53:58.568 - 00:53:59.764, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:54:00.224 - 00:54:13.764, Speaker A: This really seems to require some new idea that would be very interesting. Okay, does anybody else have any other questions? You're all very silent today.
00:54:15.584 - 00:54:28.544, Speaker B: So one thing that I forgot to mention is that actually. So same thing actually gives a. Because the result of a gross. And Rohrlich is actually about the points and quotients of these Jacobians.
00:54:28.624 - 00:54:29.144, Speaker A: That's right.
00:54:29.224 - 00:54:32.124, Speaker B: One can one get the same thing actually about quotients of.
00:54:36.504 - 00:54:54.424, Speaker A: Okay, very good. So if I don't see any hands up or any questions in the chat. So I'm assuming that everybody is really happy with the presentation and is busy working on trying to prove the theorem for algebraic equivalents. So. Okay, thanks again. Thanks again to Pembroke.
00:54:54.804 - 00:54:55.744, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:54:56.084 - 00:55:10.596, Speaker A: Next week, our speaker is Clifton Cunningham from Calgary. He'll speak about automorphic forms on g two. Good. Okay, thank you. See everybody next week. Bye. Thanks, Berman.
00:55:10.740 - 00:55:11.084, Speaker B: Thank you.
