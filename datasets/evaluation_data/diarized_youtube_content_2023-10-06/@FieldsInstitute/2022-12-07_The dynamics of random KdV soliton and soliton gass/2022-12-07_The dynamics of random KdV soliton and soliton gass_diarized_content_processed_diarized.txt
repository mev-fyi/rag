00:00:00.760 - 00:00:36.182, Speaker A: So let me thank first the organizers of this colloquium for inviting me. I'm very happy to be back here at Fields after the pandemic, so it's very nice for me to be here in Toronto. So what I'm going to talk about today, it's a collection of results that they started back when I was in Colorado in 2018. And so far, we have two papers, possibly at the one coming up soon. And it's a joint work with, uh, different subgroups of this, of this list. So it's a work with Tamara Grava from CS and Bristol, and Bob Jenkins in Florida, Ken McLaughlin, who is, who.
00:00:36.238 - 00:00:39.086, Speaker B: Just recently moved to Tulane in New.
00:00:39.110 - 00:01:11.680, Speaker A: Orleans, and Alexander Minakoff from Prague. And so my. Okay, the, the topic of, of today, I'm actually going to jump back and forth between two integrable models. So, one is a very well known quarterback de Vries equation. And we all know about this picture where they're recreating this, this solitary wave in the Union Canal in Edinburgh, which is a single bump that just propagates, and it maintains the shape and the velocity for a long time. Well, the theory tells us forever. And then I'm also going to switch.
00:01:11.680 - 00:01:51.098, Speaker A: And while KDv equation is very well known, it appears for shallow waterways, but also acoustic waves in plasma, acoustic waves on crystal lattice, internal waves in the ocean, and many other models. And then I'm also going to switch temporarily, especially in the middle part of my talk. And I'm going to talk about modified kDv. So you can see that it looks like KDV just as a square here. And that also, it's been introduced much more recently in the sixties, and that also has applications in physics. So electric circuits, again, plasmas and so on. So we all know that both of these models are examples, very famous examples, of integrable PDE's.
00:01:51.098 - 00:02:17.950, Speaker A: And by integrable, it means that they have a lax there. So they have two operators. The l is usually, as you can see there, the Schrodinger operator, and the b is the other operator. That sort of dictates how the solution should evolve and their compatibility condition, which is written over there. So the time derivative of the l operator is equal to the commutator between the two operators. Well, this is equivalent. Solving this compatibility condition is equivalent of finding a solution for either KDV or MKDV.
00:02:17.950 - 00:02:28.700, Speaker A: And this is just one example of one solution for MKDV with two solitons. Okay? And you can see already here. So there are these two bumps. One goes through the others and I.
00:02:28.732 - 00:02:31.364, Speaker B: Like to do this little demonstration.
00:02:31.444 - 00:02:35.116, Speaker A: So what happens? So their height and their velocity does not change, but there is one thing.
00:02:35.140 - 00:02:37.204, Speaker B: That change, which is the phase.
00:02:37.324 - 00:02:50.864, Speaker A: So here, I'm putting my cursor there and you can see that after the solitons has passed, the peak has shifted a little bit. This is going to be a fundamental intuition that we're going to exploit to actually study soliton gases, which is our next.
00:02:51.564 - 00:02:59.212, Speaker C: The moving eye also experiences a delay or an advance. Sorry, does the moving eye also get delayed or advanced in the same way?
00:02:59.348 - 00:03:21.100, Speaker A: The big one? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They both get a shift. Yeah. And it's, uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna say more about that. But yeah, they both get some sort of, it's an elastic interaction, but then they get this shift. And so standard solutions, you can just make these ans that's of a traveling wave. And either you impose decaying initial conditions, sorry, decaying condition at the boundary, which is plus and minus infinity.
00:03:21.100 - 00:03:45.336, Speaker A: Then what you get is the bump, the soliton, this is the soliton for the MKDV. So you can recognize here you have a hyperbolic secant. For KDV, you have hyperbolic secant squares, but they're similar. And the main parameters here in the, in the game are this kappa and the kappa naught. So kappa naught is just initial position. But then the kappa is what is very important. That tells us both the velocity of the soliton and the height.
00:03:45.336 - 00:04:10.040, Speaker A: So height solitons travel faster and they all travel in one direction towards the right. And then if in post periodic boundary conditions, well, then you have the periodic traveling wave or conoidal solution. And this looks like this Jacobi elliptic function, this dn function with a certain parameter, again, which is a velocity, another rescaling there, the height, and then a modulus that goes between zero and one velocity.
00:04:10.192 - 00:04:11.316, Speaker C: More parameters.
00:04:11.480 - 00:04:11.756, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:11.780 - 00:04:55.960, Speaker A: No, they're all interrelated. So also in this case, the v one and the a are connectors of the a one is going to be clear in our solution where you're going to see again this sort of kappa value that appears everywhere. So how do you find general solution? Well, the idea is that, okay, you have your initial condition, q of x naught, and you want to go from q of x naught to q of x six to the evolved solution. And what you do, you kind of calculate your lax spirit initial condition. So you calculate what they're called the scattering data, which are the l, two eigenvalues of the Schrodinger operator, the Norman constant, the reflection coefficients. It is just standard practice in the realm of scattering theory. And so you shift your problem into this, what I call hyper uranium.
00:04:55.960 - 00:05:22.660, Speaker A: So in this scattering world, you evolve them. And the evolution is actually very simple. It's actually linear. So you can think of the scattering transform as some sort of non linear Fourier transform when you want to solve PD's. And once you know the vault scattering data, you get back. You get back to your solution q of XD. And the way you get back is originally where the classical ways you solve this Marchenko integral equation and modern approaches, you use the Riemann Hilbert problem.
00:05:22.660 - 00:05:25.544, Speaker A: And I'm going to tell you what is the Riemann Hilbert problem?
00:05:26.164 - 00:05:29.104, Speaker C: What's the word? Hyperinion.
00:05:29.684 - 00:05:30.584, Speaker B: Rh.
00:05:30.884 - 00:05:32.180, Speaker C: Hypermeuran.
00:05:32.292 - 00:05:55.110, Speaker A: Hyperanium. Oh, okay. So this is just a reference to my background as an italian or as classical education. So this is the world of ideas that Plato was suggesting. So there is a real world that is a lot of lies. And then there is the truth that lies in the hyper uranium. So what is a soliton gas? So it turns out this bump.
00:05:55.110 - 00:06:16.758, Speaker A: What is a soliton gas? So, let's just give a very informal definition first. It's just a collection of a lot of solids. They can be random. They can be not random. They can be deterministic. But the idea is that you have a lot, a big number of solitons, possibly an infinite number of them. This is just some numerical simulations where the height of the soliton, all of these little peaks are sampled by uniform distribution between one and three.
00:06:16.758 - 00:06:34.964, Speaker A: And this is the numerical simulation of the evolution of the solution. This is just one experiment from 2016, but there are many more. And I think these are kdv solitons. But there were many more experiments also for NLS, MKDV and so other integrable models.
00:06:35.054 - 00:06:40.804, Speaker C: Sorry, the right hand picture, the lines we see are the wave.
00:06:41.984 - 00:06:48.964, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And here is not so clear, but they kind of interact pairwise, only pairwise periodically.
00:06:51.344 - 00:06:52.644, Speaker B: So here.
00:06:52.944 - 00:07:06.504, Speaker A: Here they set. So here, I think they have 200 solitons. It's not written there, but I think they have 200 of these solitons and it's zero. But the idea is that they look at this small window. So I guess they impose zero boundary condition in their numerical domain.
00:07:07.564 - 00:07:09.984, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:07:10.324 - 00:07:37.658, Speaker A: So I think these were some early works, I think. I'm not mentioning all the papers, but there is a lot of new papers where they actually study, even with boundary conditions. As far as I remember especially so Gennadiel and his group, they're really working hard on numerical simulation and theoretical approach. So why Soliton gases? Well, they also appear experimentally, so they can be created in a lab. So these are two pictures.
00:07:37.746 - 00:07:40.746, Speaker B: This is the slide from Pierre Suret's.
00:07:40.770 - 00:08:13.036, Speaker A: Talk at ini this past October, where he was actually explaining that in his lab, he managed to create Soyton gases, both in a tank. So, water, waste, or in some other. I'm not sure what that machinery is, but it creates some soliton gases in optics, in an optics scenario. And these are just some measurements that they had. This is one of their papers. So, definitely there is also an interest from the physical point of view, that indeed soliton gases can explain some physical phenomena. Here is getting back to just two solitons that interact.
00:08:13.036 - 00:08:31.984, Speaker A: Now we have a bigger picture. The first one, the first on the left is just the two solitons. One passes through each other. The second one looks like a line, is just deposition of one of the peaks. And it looks like a straight line. There is actually discontinuities. This is the velocity that has a jump, and this is the acceleration.
00:08:31.984 - 00:08:58.382, Speaker A: Okay, so the idea is exactly. Is exactly the fact that there is this phase shift. And it is of this logarithmic shape for both the big soliton and the small solitons. So, this is the first intuition of how we construct a soliton gas. There is some shift that happens if there are two solitons. Of course, if there are many, there are going to be more logarithmic interactions that just accumulates. And so, indeed, the second intuition is that, suppose that you have a lot of little Lilliputian over there.
00:08:58.382 - 00:09:00.630, Speaker A: That's our gas. And you send a big soliton just.
00:09:00.662 - 00:09:02.742, Speaker B: Passing through that already.
00:09:02.838 - 00:09:29.774, Speaker A: Well, this is numerics, but already in the intuition, the idea is that you accumulate so many phase ships that eventually that effectively, you are adding a velocity. So the Soliton gets accelerated. So this is how we can, let's say. So the red one is the soliton as it's passing through the gas. The black one is the soliton without the gas. So it's just a comparison that shows that, indeed, the black one evolves linearly. The red one has acceleration.
00:09:29.774 - 00:10:03.254, Speaker A: Okay, so this was actually the original idea of Zakharov. So, Zakharov, already back in 71, was the one that actually started theorizing the idea of a Soyton gas. And what he was, his argument was that supposedly gas is dilute what basically means that you can tell all the peaks apart, like in the previous pictures that I was showing you. Then you send a large soil to pass through that. And then the effective velocity of the soliton can be calculated in this form. So you have the four Kappa squared, which is the velocity of the soil in the vacuum if there is no gas. And then there are all these logarithmic shifts that they're accumulating.
00:10:03.254 - 00:10:14.174, Speaker A: And the role is basically the density of the tiny solitons that are kicking the big salt. And there is an extra continuity equation that needs to. That needs to be satisfied by.
00:10:14.294 - 00:10:15.806, Speaker B: By the density of the gas.
00:10:15.990 - 00:10:35.994, Speaker A: So, fast forward into 2003, Gennady actually generalized it to a dense soil gas. So when you cannot see the peaks, they're not so distant, they're not so spread around on the Hori line. So the gas is dense. Then what you have is not really a formula to calculate the velocity, but it's an implicit equation to calculate the velocity of the gas, the soliton, as it travels through the gas.
00:10:36.534 - 00:10:37.494, Speaker B: So this was.
00:10:37.614 - 00:10:54.462, Speaker A: This was originally suggested for KDV in this paper by Gennady. But then, as you can see, again, there has been much more development for NLS in particular. Especially this paper here generalizes to NLS and to other integral models. This paper by Gennady and Alex.
00:10:54.598 - 00:10:55.314, Speaker B: Yes.
00:10:55.814 - 00:10:59.638, Speaker C: So, I mean, I'm just trying to understand the replacement of minterms.
00:10:59.726 - 00:10:59.990, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:00.022 - 00:11:06.670, Speaker C: So, somehow, is it that if I tailor it scans via Kappa and the dilute regime, then I get Kappa squared?
00:11:06.822 - 00:11:30.816, Speaker A: Yeah. The intuition is precisely that if. If you do some approximation, then first order approximation would be that one. Indeed, they claim that they're rigorous. I am still working on their papers, but they have some theories, especially in the newest papers. Especially this paper has been pretty fundamental, where they actually derive the whole equations.
00:11:30.880 - 00:11:34.964, Speaker B: And they have some hypothesis improves.
00:11:35.304 - 00:11:41.952, Speaker A: And so it is rigorous. But is this approach of Soyton gas that I am still learning about.
00:11:42.128 - 00:11:43.320, Speaker B: So, this is their approach.
00:11:43.432 - 00:12:20.164, Speaker A: And we're going to have our approach in the next slides. And they do coincide, which is nice, but they're approaching the Soyton gas from the point of view of kinetic theory. So, indeed, definitely starts from some physics background that could be a little bit wavy. But then they develop a mathematical theory. So, in this. Well, I know that here, they were making some assumptions. So, especially in the previous.
00:12:20.164 - 00:12:39.358, Speaker A: In the original papers. But in 2003, I think they were making some assumptions that it was not clear whether these equations, for example, have solutions. So they were just deriving equations. But, for example, there is a. I haven't mentioned it here. There is a paper by Alex Tobis and Arnold Kohlers, when they actually prove that there are solutions to these equations, for example. That's already rigorous.
00:12:39.358 - 00:12:41.474, Speaker A: Yeah, there's already something rigorous.
00:12:41.774 - 00:12:56.064, Speaker C: Rigorous is something that can be read in architecture. Can they prove that there's some regimen actually go.
00:12:57.764 - 00:13:03.148, Speaker A: That'S our paper. In our paper, we show that our construction actually solves these equations.
00:13:03.316 - 00:13:04.064, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:05.884 - 00:13:32.286, Speaker A: And we, and we proved more than that. I'm going to get to that. So this is the first approach for Soyton gases. You just look at what's the interaction with a big soliton. The second approach is the intuitive approach. So gas is just a collection of a lot of solitude. There were already some results in the eighties by Zeiss and Wytham and Boyd, where they show that if you just take a sum of secant squared, and this basically is, coincides with elliptic solution of kDv.
00:13:32.286 - 00:13:34.326, Speaker A: And then this other paper in 92.
00:13:34.390 - 00:13:36.590, Speaker B: They show that indeed, like there exists.
00:13:36.622 - 00:13:44.102, Speaker A: A solution with infinite soliton for kdv. As long as you have some conditions on the Norman constants and the whole line.
00:13:44.198 - 00:13:46.834, Speaker B: The first one, yes.
00:13:47.694 - 00:13:50.034, Speaker C: What does it even mean to solve a.
00:13:51.774 - 00:14:35.146, Speaker A: No, I think, I think it just coincides with the elliptic solution. So if you notice there, there is no t dependence. So I guess they just want to show that, that initial condition, that's a valid initial condition, but I'm not sure. Yeah, I haven't read those paper very carefully. I just wanted to mention that there has been some interest, but there's been a huge interest in these past ten years, and before there were just some, some sparse results. So what is the Soyton gas? Let me give you now a definition. So we came up with what is the natural definition, which is basically saying that Soyton gas, it's a regular Soyton gas, is a solution of KDV or MKDV, as long as it can be written as a limit of infinite solitons.
00:14:35.146 - 00:15:16.924, Speaker A: So you have an purely soliton solution, no reflection coefficient, you take into infinity, you find a soliton gas, and if you look the interactive behavior of your solution with a soliton, then it satisfies the kinetic equation proposed by Zakharov and L. So this is our working environment. So, here are the results. So, first, we construct a soliton gas, and the idea is that we take n solitons, we take the limit, and what we're going to find is the solution which can be written in terms of Fredon determinant this is an exact expression. But of course, using like working with fernandeterminants is not very convenient for certain. For certain things. First of all, numerically, it's very hard to plot a friend of the terminal.
00:15:16.924 - 00:16:06.718, Speaker A: And secondly, if we want to study long term behavior, which is our main interest, and definitely studying friendly determinants is not so straightforward. So that's when we're going to move on into the Riemann Hilbert technology, which we study long time behavior. This is the profile of the Soyton gas. And I will say a little bit more about this profile and then we will study what happens if we add an extra soliton that just interacts with the gas. It will turn out that the solution will actually split linearly between a background soliton, sorry, a background wave, which is like a canoidal wave, and then a soliton contribution, which does not really look like a secant, like a hyperbolic secant, except in certain regimes. Otherwise it's just a contribution from the solicitor that just passes through the gas and then some error terms. And finally, these are the dynamic interactions.
00:16:06.718 - 00:16:29.466, Speaker A: So we managed to prove that indeed this construction is an instance of a soliton gas. So it does satisfy the kinetic equations by Gennady. So. Oh, so I should rush because I really want to get to the last part. So this is the idea. So this is our Riemann Hilbert problem. This is how you usually construct a solution for n soliton for and soliton.
00:16:29.466 - 00:16:42.842, Speaker A: No reflection coefficient. You just have some poles in the upper half plane and some poles in the lower half plane. And let's assume that they're bounded between these two intervals. Theta one eta two. Sorry, I eta one I two and minus I eta one, minus I two. That's your answer for the solution.
00:16:42.898 - 00:16:45.378, Speaker B: And that's how we recover the solution.
00:16:45.426 - 00:17:08.604, Speaker A: Of the KDV or MKDV. Here I'm focusing on MKDV just because it's a little bit simpler for the exposition. So it's a two by two matrix. Yeah. So the Riemann Hilbert technique tells you that suppose that you are on a complex plane, you have some poles. You want to find a function that is metamorphic everywhere except at this poles. And then you make the downside and it's identity at infinity.
00:17:08.604 - 00:17:20.232, Speaker A: So that's your answer. You have one, one on the diagonal. And then you have some poles with some coefficients, alpha and betas. And it's just a linear algebra. Calculations to impose this residue conditions so.
00:17:20.248 - 00:17:23.616, Speaker B: That you get your alpha and betas explicitly.
00:17:23.640 - 00:17:27.515, Speaker A: And then you calculate this limit, you get solution of KDv. Kdv.
00:17:27.539 - 00:17:29.251, Speaker B: In this case, for Kdv, you have.
00:17:29.267 - 00:17:31.263, Speaker A: A vector solution, not a matrix.
00:17:31.683 - 00:17:32.491, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:17:32.667 - 00:17:34.063, Speaker C: It's the opt add on.
00:17:36.003 - 00:17:39.907, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. Yeah. So basically is the sum of the data over there.
00:17:39.955 - 00:17:40.583, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:41.363 - 00:18:02.794, Speaker A: The sum of the alphas as a meaning basically is connected to the q of n squared. Okay, so we are here, uh, it's just a matter of like some, again, linear algebra, because now everything is fine at n. It's just a linear algebra trick that we can write it as a, as a logarithmic determinant of an n by n matrix.
00:18:03.254 - 00:18:04.846, Speaker B: And this is still finite n. And.
00:18:04.870 - 00:18:41.222, Speaker A: Now the idea is that add more and more poles always in this interval, rescale this norming constant chi appropriately and take the limit. And then what we find is a freight on the terminal. So of course it's not so obvious that a finite terminal becomes a Freddon determinant, but this is the solution is exact and it's the Freddy determinant of an integral operator of that form. And the sigma one is just the interval, the bounded interval where all the poles are accumulating. So here, just an idea of the proof that the trick is that you realize that I alpha is a composition of two Hilbert Schmitt operator and you just flip them and now you have a friend determinant, you can take the.
00:18:41.238 - 00:18:46.754, Speaker C: Limit and you fix equals, stay away from the real axis, right?
00:18:46.794 - 00:18:47.786, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:18:47.850 - 00:18:49.986, Speaker C: So the notion convergence is uniform or.
00:18:50.010 - 00:18:51.802, Speaker A: Combat sensor, correct, exactly.
00:18:51.858 - 00:18:55.122, Speaker B: Yeah, that's precisely, precisely that.
00:18:55.298 - 00:19:22.984, Speaker A: And so why do we like this expression very much is because. Well, first of all, already tracing window in 96 derived a similar expression for the defocusing MKDV. So there is a minus in front of the nonlinearity. And then similar expressions were derived in this past few years for studying the KPZ equations. So weak noise solution of the KPZ equation. And then it was also studied by Thomas Bottner to study some class of Hancock operators. So they're kind of ubiquitous, this type of kernels.
00:19:22.984 - 00:20:09.780, Speaker A: So here we are, right? So we have the solution, we have the french determinant. We don't like the french determinant. So we would like to have a Riemann Heber problem that we can work on. And so what is a Rhea Hebrew problem? Just to show you again, so we are in a complex plane, you have a bunch of contours that can be, they're all oriented, so they all have an orientation they can extend to plus infinity, they can be a loop, they can be poles and they have some plus and minus direction. The idea is that you want to find a solution of this problem. So you want to find, in general, a matrix function that is metamorphic everywhere except on these jumps. And you have finite limit both on the left and on the right of the jumps of the contours, where the function is not defined and the two limits are related according to a jump matrix, what we call a jam matrix.
00:20:09.780 - 00:20:34.080, Speaker A: In general, it's extremely hard to find an exact solution. If you give me a random contour on the plane, I probably will not be able to give you a solution. The best that we can do is to find an approximate solution. So that's what we're going to use to study the solution of the solitary gas. So this is the Riemann Huber problem for the soil gas. So instead of having a lot of poles in that band, we have a band. We have a full band, full interval.
00:20:34.080 - 00:20:34.976, Speaker A: And those are the jumps.
00:20:35.000 - 00:20:37.856, Speaker B: And this is the standard evolution.
00:20:37.960 - 00:21:11.430, Speaker A: This is the standard phase that appears in the evolution of the KDV equation on the level of the scattering data. So, just a quick remark. So again, we can reconstruct the solution by just solving the Riemann Hibber problem and taking that limit. This is what Zakarov and Gennady, mostly Gennady, call a condensate soitom gas. So, according to their theory, this is the densest Soyton gas that we can obtain. And so you cannot tell the peaks apart. It's smooth because we were sort of risking the norming constants appropriately so that we would get something nice and is deterministic.
00:21:11.430 - 00:21:33.896, Speaker A: So no randomness so far. We were prescribing the positions of the poles as we were taking n to infinity. And this is a little. A little extra. So this actually is an instance. Also, something is called a primitive or Bergman potential, where we have a jump matrix that is like that. It has this r two, this extra, the extra coefficient, this extra function that appears there.
00:21:33.896 - 00:21:44.804, Speaker A: And there are still open problems. We're still working on that to kind of prove that. Also, this new, completely new class of Riemann Hilbert actually describes a sodium gas, a certain type of sodium gas.
00:21:45.344 - 00:21:50.124, Speaker C: Why not? It's all deterministic. Why don't you just say the initial condition is this?
00:21:52.184 - 00:21:59.964, Speaker A: Well, we studied initial. We're always living on the scattering data. Eventually, we study also the initial conditions. Still with the Riemann Hibber problem. Still just asymptotically.
00:22:00.004 - 00:22:01.180, Speaker C: Okay, so that's a hard problem.
00:22:01.252 - 00:22:03.380, Speaker A: It's a hard problem. It's hard to go back. Yeah.
00:22:03.452 - 00:22:06.228, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:22:06.276 - 00:22:08.984, Speaker A: So this is the best that we can do, studying asymptotics.
00:22:12.764 - 00:22:14.140, Speaker C: Were they uniform?
00:22:14.332 - 00:22:31.000, Speaker A: Yeah. We assume them to be uniformly distributed, because basically the underlying trick is just you have a summation of all these poles, like in the. In our ansets, if you rescale them as one over n, you have a con. You have con. We have basically the convergence of the Riemann sums to the Riemann integral.
00:22:31.152 - 00:22:31.416, Speaker B: Right?
00:22:31.440 - 00:22:48.152, Speaker A: So you have an integral, and then you eventually you do some tricks where you get. Yes, yeah, yeah. So that, that's, that's nice. And so, yeah, so this is what we got.
00:22:48.208 - 00:22:48.406, Speaker B: So.
00:22:48.440 - 00:22:59.730, Speaker A: So at time t equals zero, what we can do is we have our immunohibit problem. We cannot solve it. Exactly, but at least we can check what happens at the boundary. So at minus infinity plus infinity. And it turns out that it's a step like initial condition.
00:22:59.842 - 00:23:02.986, Speaker B: So on the left, at minus infinity.
00:23:03.050 - 00:23:17.780, Speaker A: It goes to zero. On the right, it goes like a canoidal wave. And what happens for t large? Well, this is the picture. So again, on the left goes to zero. On the right, it oscillates. And there is a. A middle region that is this modulating region that evolves in time, and it's.
00:23:17.780 - 00:23:21.884, Speaker A: It's expanding in time, and the whole, the whole wave moves on the, on the right.
00:23:22.044 - 00:23:22.316, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:22.340 - 00:23:38.424, Speaker A: So, so the parts where it's not trivial looks like. Like a canoidal wave. Again, you can see this DN and you can see that what I was writing, the a one and b, they're all interconnected, so they have. I have this alpha plus eta one also here and here it's a squared. So they still depend on the scattering data.
00:23:39.244 - 00:23:42.054, Speaker B: So how do I do that?
00:23:42.174 - 00:24:10.160, Speaker A: How do we, how do we get the t, the long time behavior? Well, the tricks are basically two. Once you have the rheumatoid problem, use either small norm theorem, which is the idea that if your jumps are basically the identity, then your solution is basically the identity. And the second one is that if your jump are not basically the identity, then you massage your problems so that you get to the. To having jumps to be equal to the identity or almost identity. Okay, so these are the two, the.
00:24:10.192 - 00:24:15.192, Speaker B: Two big methods that we're using, the two big theorems.
00:24:15.368 - 00:24:53.386, Speaker A: So this is just to give you, like, a very general definition. So very general idea that you can see here the bands, and depending on the value of x over t, in our phase theta, we are either in the case where we have the jumps that are almost identity. So no contribution from these bands, or if we move x and theta appropriately. So if we increase x over t, then we get, this is the case where no contribution, and then at some point there is going to be a little contribution that pops up from our bands. And that's where we're going to have this starting of the modulating region. And then eventually, and then eventually we recover the full band over here, full contribution from the jumps.
00:24:53.410 - 00:24:55.570, Speaker B: And that's where we have the canoidal.
00:24:55.602 - 00:25:27.624, Speaker A: Wave at plus infinity on the right. So this is just how we managed to find this critical value here, the critical value that moves along the jumps. This is just a little bit technical, so I'm not going to focus too much on that. And this is our technique. The idea is that when you have contribution, what you have to do is, again, massage the problem. And by massages, we use something that is called the g function that is very explicit. And you see here the logarithm term that is popping up, that sort of.
00:25:28.764 - 00:25:30.612, Speaker B: It'S sort of a hint that the.
00:25:30.628 - 00:25:58.470, Speaker A: Kinetic equation probably are gonna, are gonna be satisfied. And once we, once we do that, once we find the g function, then we know how to solve the problem approximately. And so we can actually estimate this error very explicitly. It's not just, it's not just a guess. And we have a first order term, this expression that I showed you in the picture before. So if I add the soliton, same thing. The only difference is that I have this Riemannhiba problem with the two bands.
00:25:58.502 - 00:26:00.446, Speaker B: And then I add two big two.
00:26:00.470 - 00:26:27.368, Speaker A: Poles up on top, on the bottom. Why on top? Simply because this kappa naught is the height of the soliton. So I want it to be very tall and very fast so that it catches up with the gas and it passes through. So this is our Riemannhiba problem. We use the same techniques. So the idea is that in the background, so the bands will still have these three behavior, so there will still be a quiescent region, a modulating region, and an oscillatory region that is fixed. And then the soliton is passing through it.
00:26:27.368 - 00:26:42.320, Speaker A: And the fact that it's passing through it is going to create some shift, some phase shift. So here's what happens. So now the soliton is very far on the right. So there is actually nothing really exciting happening. Just the soliton is traveling linearly.
00:26:42.512 - 00:26:46.216, Speaker B: But then if we start entering the.
00:26:46.320 - 00:27:21.424, Speaker A: Modulating region, so there is more contribution than we need to keep into account. Basically, the idea is that we still have the modulated analytic region. But we have this s minus and s plus, depending whether the soliton has passed already or it hasn't passed yet. And this is just some very technical construction on how we approximate our Riemann Hibber problem. So we need to use Arieman surface of genus, one that is constructed with that prescription, some Jacobi theta function. Everything is fairly explicit, just very long formula. And this is what happens.
00:27:21.424 - 00:27:40.544, Speaker A: The solicon enters and is starting to interact. And very surprisingly, it's also, the height is also shrinking and expanding. So definitely the interaction is not trivial. So, can we say more about this peak that is traveling through the gas? Non trivial. It's just.
00:27:40.624 - 00:27:42.776, Speaker B: Yeah, I will say, I will say.
00:27:42.800 - 00:27:45.284, Speaker A: More, something more precise about the non triviality.
00:27:46.064 - 00:27:47.504, Speaker B: So the first, so the first result.
00:27:47.544 - 00:28:31.072, Speaker A: That we have is that if we want to write explicitly the solution, at least for the large time, this looks like this is the sum of the background wave, which is this dn that we see in it. Also in the case of the free gas without a soliton. And then there is this contribution that we call it q sol, simply because it is still localized in compact subsets. But it's very complicated. It involves all these theta three functions combined altogether. On the other hand, we can still recover the hyperbolic secant here if we assume kappa naught to be huge. So that's why I call it giant turbo soliton, because it's really tall, really big, really fast, then it really looks like a hyperbolic secant the way we would expect from a soliton.
00:28:31.072 - 00:29:18.906, Speaker A: Oh, and we managed to calculate also the phase shift in the gas. So it's not only that the soliton gets accelerated and we're going to get there, but also the gas gets shifted because the interaction is mutual. And this is just a little remark that in our theorem, the error term was over one over t. That was like a pessimistic estimate. So if we impose more condition on this factor r that appears in the jump, and if we assume that vanishes like a square root or blows up like a square root at the end points the bands, then actually we get better estimate, we get exponentially small estimate. Okay, and this is the general picture. So this is the yellow line is the soliton as a gas compared with the green dashed line, which is the free soliton without the gas.
00:29:18.906 - 00:29:26.090, Speaker A: So we have a general description. You can see here that there's the modulating region over there in the middle, and this one is already just elliptic.
00:29:26.162 - 00:29:29.074, Speaker B: Canoidal wave on the right.
00:29:30.374 - 00:30:01.564, Speaker A: So velocity so the last thing I want to check is, okay, we, can we say more about the. Can we look at the solitude a little bit more and track its behavior as it passes through the gas? Well, we need to use a bunch of physics terminology. We're going to define a lot of velocities. So this is the phase velocity, which is frequency over wave number. And this is going to give us the elliptic wave velocity, which is the velocity on the envelope of the gas. And it's calculated here. And the average sultan velocity, which you can think of it as the average sultan velocity as it travels through the gas.
00:30:01.564 - 00:30:10.764, Speaker A: You've seen that it's highly oscillating. This is the average. And we also define the group velocity, which is the velocity of the weight packet.
00:30:11.104 - 00:30:13.284, Speaker B: So, the first theorem is that indeed.
00:30:13.704 - 00:30:19.964, Speaker A: We recover the kinetic equations, and those are satisfied both by the soliton, at least on average.
00:30:20.364 - 00:30:21.748, Speaker B: It turns out that there are extra.
00:30:21.796 - 00:30:38.604, Speaker A: Terms, highly oscillatory, that were not. That kind of gets washed out if you try to recover the kinetic equation by Gennady and Zakharov. And also, it turns out that even the gas satisfies the velocity of the group. The group velocity of the gas satisfies.
00:30:38.644 - 00:30:47.588, Speaker B: The same kinetic equations. And for the peak itself, we can actually track the peak up to order.
00:30:47.636 - 00:30:49.996, Speaker A: One over term, up to error over.
00:30:50.020 - 00:30:55.212, Speaker B: Order one over t. The position of the peak can be fairly explicitly calculated.
00:30:55.268 - 00:31:26.282, Speaker A: As an implicit solution of this equation. And again, I just want to emphasize, these are all explicit quantities, just very. They do not fit in the slide. And the last thing is, what about the velocity? So we know the position. So we can find that every time where the peak is. And the velocity is even more important, because then we recognize all the oscillations that we would see that we were seeing in the movie. So this is the exact expression for the velocity of the peak as it travels through the gas.
00:31:26.418 - 00:31:29.346, Speaker B: You can recognize the v naught, the.
00:31:29.370 - 00:31:32.922, Speaker A: V bar, solve the average, which is just the first two terms over there.
00:31:32.938 - 00:31:35.906, Speaker B: And then we have this derivative, logarithmic.
00:31:35.930 - 00:31:37.826, Speaker A: Derivative of psi, which is these highly.
00:31:37.850 - 00:31:42.698, Speaker B: Oscillatory extra terms that get, that disappear.
00:31:42.746 - 00:31:51.522, Speaker A: When you average over one period. And this is the comparison. The black line is the v bar, not the v bar sol, of kappa naught.
00:31:51.618 - 00:31:58.898, Speaker B: And the blue is the oscillatory velocity of the peak. Okay, I am going to skip the.
00:31:58.906 - 00:31:59.658, Speaker A: Idea of the proof.
00:31:59.746 - 00:32:02.094, Speaker C: It looks like it was actually.
00:32:03.674 - 00:32:06.088, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, what do you mean?
00:32:06.136 - 00:32:06.864, Speaker A: Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:32:06.904 - 00:32:11.244, Speaker C: In the simulation, you didn't have sense to just keep it up in the same diary.
00:32:13.104 - 00:32:14.144, Speaker A: Right? Yes.
00:32:14.264 - 00:32:14.964, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:17.104 - 00:32:42.274, Speaker A: So, I'm going to skip the proof, because I want to. I want to get to the last part of my talk. So, what are. What have we learned so far? So, we've learned how to construct a soyton gas. We've learned how the Soyton gas interacts with a particle, the soliton. And the solitary gas is like a medium, and the particle is traction problem through the medium. This gas is deterministic, but it solves these kinetic equations that were posed by canadian collaborators where they consider some sort of randomness over there.
00:32:42.734 - 00:32:43.390, Speaker B: But our.
00:32:43.462 - 00:33:05.056, Speaker A: Our gas is deterministic because we press. We. We construct what they say, one realization at every single step, n, and then we take the limit. So, where do we add randomness? Where. Where can we add randomness? And so, this is a new. This is our new work with me and Ken McLaughlin, where we assume random initial data. So that's where we add our randomness.
00:33:05.056 - 00:33:14.164, Speaker A: We don't put random initial data in the initial condition. We actually assume. We actually go back again to our Riemann Hilbert problem, and we're assuming that the poles over there are random.
00:33:14.624 - 00:33:18.484, Speaker B: Okay, so, I'm getting back to kdv.
00:33:18.864 - 00:33:28.324, Speaker A: So, this is. That's why it's little m. It's not big m, it's just a vector with some prescribed conditions on the. At the poles. So these are all random. So what we have is a random Riemann Hilbert problem.
00:33:29.664 - 00:33:30.764, Speaker C: What's random?
00:33:31.264 - 00:33:40.984, Speaker A: What is random? Is this the position? So the position. And. Okay, by. By. By this expression, then also the value of the residue.
00:33:41.064 - 00:33:43.604, Speaker C: Sorry, what is the RMT?
00:33:44.704 - 00:33:54.842, Speaker A: Yes, so, RMT is going to be random matrix theory. So we're gonna. We're gonna. Yes. Yeah. So, for now, it's just d. Some distribution.
00:33:54.842 - 00:34:08.134, Speaker A: The randomness is the position of the. Of the poles. But then as a byproduct, we're going to get that random. The randomness also translates into the value of the normal constant, the kai j, and then the rest.
00:34:09.674 - 00:34:10.218, Speaker B: Yes.
00:34:10.306 - 00:34:11.762, Speaker A: The height and the velocity.
00:34:11.898 - 00:34:14.994, Speaker C: But this is not. This is just for illustration purposes, right?
00:34:15.074 - 00:34:15.674, Speaker B: Yes.
00:34:15.834 - 00:34:17.054, Speaker C: It's periodical.
00:34:17.644 - 00:34:33.260, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, that's right. I should have ran a simulation for just. Yeah, I apologize. This is one very hand cherry picked realizations of random solitude. Yeah. So, yeah.
00:34:33.260 - 00:35:07.950, Speaker A: So what sort of distribution can we put here? Of course we can put any distribution we like. The idea is that we want to use very, very classical and foolproof tools from random matrix theory. So why did we thought about that? It's mostly because when we are in kDv, the poles tend to repel each other, so we don't have a double pole that collides. So then it makes sense to get back to something that is like a determinantal point process, a fermionic point process, where points kind of repel each other. And the easy, the easiest, like the number one thing that you think, number one example that you think of is this lager wish.
00:35:08.102 - 00:35:10.462, Speaker B: So you have this absolute value of.
00:35:10.478 - 00:35:24.338, Speaker A: Psi minus x j to the beta. That's the term that is going to push the points apart. And then this e to the minus, and then you have the summation. That's the potential that kind of keeps them together so that it stops them from just running away to infinity.
00:35:24.506 - 00:35:24.978, Speaker B: Okay.
00:35:25.026 - 00:35:53.022, Speaker A: So there is a lot of theory behind it, but what we really need to know is that let's assume that the poles are distributed according to this distribution. There is a random matrix model just that lies behind it. These are the distribution of the eigenvalues of something, of the sample matrices. So we thought about Poisson. We also thought about uniform. That seems like the trivial thing. So the idea is that.
00:35:53.022 - 00:36:27.084, Speaker A: So we can calculate a lot of things once we have a random matrix model behind, because we can evaluate, for example, how when you take n to infinity, you can calculate the macroscopic density. You have estimates on the lower order terms, or you have estimates on. Well, you have the microscopic behavior, you have Tracy Whedon on one side, you have sign kernel in the middle. So that's our first attempt. I'm sure that we can put other distributions. It's just that we are very familiar with this distribution. Sorry, they don't.
00:36:27.084 - 00:36:34.196, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But in general, like, our idea is that it has to be a determinant.
00:36:34.220 - 00:36:36.892, Speaker B: Table process, because then with that, you.
00:36:36.908 - 00:37:03.634, Speaker A: Have an integral kernel attached to it, and then you can use, again, Riemann Hilbert techniques to study their behavior in the large n regime. So, for example, it could be a beta model. Beta ensembles are also related to random matrices in some sense. But it can be. Yeah, it can be more general here. I just mentioned beta equal one and two. That's when you have complex or real matrices, full matrices with normal zero one entries.
00:37:03.634 - 00:37:31.974, Speaker A: So we're assuming that our poles are distributed according to this specific distribution, but again, it can be generalized. And so what happens when n goes to infinity? That's when we want to get our soliton gas eventually. So the idea. So we know what happens for the poles, at least. And this is the Marchenko Pasteur distribution. It looks a little bit it looks like this. This is for one specific parameter equal to gamma equals one half.
00:37:31.974 - 00:37:52.174, Speaker A: But if gamma is between zero and one, we get a macroscopic density that looks pretty much like this. It's compactly supported. This vanishes like a square root of the endpoints. You can calculate the endpoints explicitly. And this is actually the groundbreaking results from the sixties by Marchenko and Pasteur. And this is how the Marchenko Pasteur distribution looks like.
00:37:53.634 - 00:37:56.946, Speaker B: Okay, so we have that, and this.
00:37:56.970 - 00:38:28.038, Speaker A: Is our first result. So what we're proving is that actually the. Take the finite n purely solitonic solution with random solitons, random according to the random matrix theory distribution. Then what happens that if you take n to infinity, then the solution converges improbability to our Soyton gas, the one that we were studying before. This is what I call Q naught. And this is a rendering of the soliton gas for KDB. So, the previous I was focusing previously on MKDB, simply because the pictures were nicer and the analysis were a little bit simpler.
00:38:28.038 - 00:38:42.422, Speaker A: But we can do the same for KDV. This is the expression for the KDV. So this is just 200 solitons, and this is soliton gas. So infinite solutions. So this is the first result, but then we want to know more. So then the same thing when we.
00:38:42.438 - 00:38:49.334, Speaker C: Started with, you said it's the same solar gap as before.
00:38:49.674 - 00:38:58.094, Speaker A: Yeah, in the sense that. So this solution converges in probability to the solution of the, of the Riemann Hiba problem with a full band.
00:39:01.754 - 00:39:02.534, Speaker B: Yes.
00:39:04.234 - 00:39:05.574, Speaker A: Yes, yes.
00:39:06.314 - 00:39:07.214, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:39:07.954 - 00:39:37.306, Speaker A: Makes sense. So, so this is the first result. But then what we want to know next is, for example, can we do some law of large number type of results or some central limit theorem type of results? So this is KDV before I was doing NKVDV, just because the exposition is nicer. So that's why it looks like all flipped out, all flipped upside down. And also, yes, I apologize that the, these parameters here are a little bit.
00:39:37.330 - 00:39:40.162, Speaker B: Different between this and this, but the.
00:39:40.178 - 00:39:56.978, Speaker A: Idea is that if you. These are 200 solitons, that's how the solution looks like on compact, on compactly supported sets. Next and t. And that should converge to something like this. So again, you have on the, on the left, you have the zero, so the quiescent region, you have the modulated region, and you have the cloidal region.
00:39:57.026 - 00:40:04.406, Speaker B: There, the elliptic region on the, on the right. This time for KDV, just because of.
00:40:04.430 - 00:40:06.038, Speaker A: How we rescale the phases.
00:40:06.126 - 00:40:11.954, Speaker C: Is this just because the eigenvalues propel each other. They basically work. They are.
00:40:16.814 - 00:40:19.966, Speaker B: Let me think. Yeah, probably.
00:40:20.030 - 00:40:26.518, Speaker A: Yes, because. Yeah, that's how we, that's, that's why we chose this distribution. Yeah. Precisely because we want them to be kind of.
00:40:26.606 - 00:40:27.274, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:27.654 - 00:40:31.400, Speaker A: Uniform is not the right word, but. Yeah, like kind of spaced between each other.
00:40:31.472 - 00:40:32.124, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:32.904 - 00:40:40.800, Speaker A: So that's why I think that maybe for uniform is not going to be as simple because then they can be very close to each other and then we will, we will need other techniques to study there.
00:40:40.912 - 00:40:47.568, Speaker C: So earlier you took your bands away from the real axis, but when you do this random thing.
00:40:47.736 - 00:41:05.516, Speaker A: Yeah. So that was also something that we had to look. So in the limit you have something is completely supported away from zero. We had to estimate how close to zero you get. Yeah, exactly. Small tails and large tail. We really had to estimate, have explicit estimates so that we knew that.
00:41:05.516 - 00:41:08.092, Speaker A: Yeah. We weren't getting close to the dangerous zone.
00:41:08.148 - 00:41:08.784, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:10.044 - 00:41:43.094, Speaker A: So, yeah, convergence in probability. The next step is can we have a law of large number type of result? The answer is yes. So if we take the average of the end solid on solutions, the average converges to our soil gas and actually every moment. So here I just wrote the variance, the variance goes to zero, but every other, every higher moments find a number moment of order. K also vanishes if we take the average square minus the square of the average that goes to zero. So in the limit, this random converges to a deterministic.
00:41:44.914 - 00:41:45.314, Speaker B: Shape.
00:41:45.354 - 00:41:52.264, Speaker A: So a deterministic profile, average over realization. So realization of the, of the solitude.
00:41:52.304 - 00:41:54.484, Speaker B: Of the poles and.
00:41:56.904 - 00:42:02.724, Speaker A: Anytime. So this is done for compact compact subsets of space and time.
00:42:03.144 - 00:42:03.736, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:03.840 - 00:42:23.584, Speaker A: So, yeah, unfortunately we cannot, we did not yet extend it to the whole real line. That's going to be, that's one of the things that we want to work on. What happens if you have non compact subset of space and time? We didn't check the kinetic equations here.
00:42:24.244 - 00:42:24.620, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:24.652 - 00:43:01.636, Speaker A: Now here we were just wondering if we could add randomness in the solution and what's the relation between our Soyton gas and a random solution? Yes. So this law of large number is, does not follow so easily from the convergence in probability. We had to do some estimate. And what really helped us was the fact that the end solitone solution of KDV never explodes. So if you have multiple solitons, the solution always remains bounded and you have an explicit bound. This does not happen, for example, for NLS or MKDV. So the implementation of our idea for.
00:43:01.700 - 00:43:04.420, Speaker B: Other integrable system would be, would need.
00:43:04.452 - 00:43:13.966, Speaker A: Some other techniques, but for KDV works really nicely. And what about local fluctuations? That's the next step. So, once we have low large numbers, can we do CLT?
00:43:14.110 - 00:43:14.606, Speaker B: And.
00:43:14.710 - 00:43:38.904, Speaker A: Well, we have a CLT results from the random matrix side that tells us precisely that if you have a linear statistics like the summation of f of lambda J, lambda J, think of your eigenvalues. Then in the limit this convert, it converges to a Gaussian, a Gaussian that has zero, zero mean. And this very explicit, although very long type of variation variance.
00:43:39.204 - 00:43:39.724, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:43:39.804 - 00:44:12.142, Speaker A: So, we want to use this result. And the idea is that we have a linear statistics that basically is what appears in the jump of our Riemann Hubert problem. And by just using the CLT theorem by Litova, pasture and sherbina, we managed to recover some complex version of the CLT. This is on the level of Riemann Hibber problem. Now, the last question is, can we go back to the solution of the KDV? And this is this last piece of the puzzle. Very important that we're still working on. This is our claim.
00:44:12.142 - 00:44:20.558, Speaker A: So what we have, like our claim, is that indeed the local fluctuation. So you take the N Soyton solution, you subtract the Soyton gas, multiply by.
00:44:20.606 - 00:44:22.534, Speaker B: N, then what you get is local.
00:44:22.574 - 00:44:49.184, Speaker A: Fluctuation, which are gaussian. This is just that, this is just one simulation that we have, one of the many simulations. And the Gaussian is given, it's a gaussian field because it depends on x and t on space and time, and is prescribed by these expressions. So you need to integrate. You have this complex integral to integrate. And this is going to give you eventually a normal real gaussian area gaussian with mean zero and possibly different variance. Well, possibly also, the mean varies depending on XMP.
00:44:49.644 - 00:44:51.424, Speaker B: We. We haven't.
00:44:55.824 - 00:45:10.200, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, sorry. That's the, that's the jump of the Soliton gas Riemann Hilbert problem conjugated with some matrices. But yes. So this is all deterministic and explicit. And that's. And that's the source of randomness this side.
00:45:10.272 - 00:45:11.512, Speaker B: That depends.
00:45:11.568 - 00:45:15.564, Speaker A: Basically, it's a version of these linear statistics. It comes from there.
00:45:17.304 - 00:45:17.776, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:17.840 - 00:45:19.482, Speaker A: So, so far, we found that we.
00:45:19.498 - 00:45:20.734, Speaker B: Still need to prove.
00:45:21.754 - 00:45:36.906, Speaker A: We are still missing some little parts in this proof. So that's why I cannot write theorem. It's still a claim. But that completes the picture. Then we have a lot of large numbers. We know that the planet ten Soyton converges to the Soyton gas. And the next step, the local fluctuations.
00:45:36.930 - 00:45:40.174, Speaker B: Are Gaussians as we were expecting.
00:45:40.474 - 00:45:46.250, Speaker A: So the updated overlook is that even though our sodium gas was deterministic, you can think of it as a universal.
00:45:46.282 - 00:45:51.538, Speaker B: Limit for a large class of purely.
00:45:51.586 - 00:45:59.866, Speaker A: And so solutions with random initial data. And in this case we just focus on some random matrix type of random initial data, but we're confident it can.
00:45:59.890 - 00:46:04.346, Speaker B: Be extended to other distributions and future direction.
00:46:04.410 - 00:46:41.556, Speaker A: As I was saying clearly, what happens in the non asymptotic analysis? What happens for non compact XMT? What happens for N? Very large but still finite. So there should be some tails in the far field that maybe something interesting happens. What happens if the solitons are bleeding out again in this finite but large regime? One of the applications, not really for KDV, but for NKDV and nls will be certainly rogue waves. There is some simulations by Perinosky and Shurgalina where they show that actually this random interaction generates big peaks, and the distribution of the height of the peaks.
00:46:41.580 - 00:46:44.768, Speaker B: Gets changes in time, and so the.
00:46:44.856 - 00:47:18.274, Speaker A: High peaks becomes more and more possible with high probability. And then of course other types of gases. What happens if you have two gas that interacts with each other and other other geometry that you can plug into your rheumatoid problem and then study? And with this I'm on time. I just wanted to just wish you sanicola Effie San Nicolas this is something that I did my postdoc in Belgium, and this is the traditional holiday where kids received cookies and gift on this day. So I just wanted to wish you happy holidays. Thank you.
